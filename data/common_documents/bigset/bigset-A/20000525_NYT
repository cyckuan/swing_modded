PATAKI BALKING AT CIGARETTE FIRE-SAFETY BILL 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ With just hours left for him to act, Gov. George
Pataki made a series of demands before he would sign a bill that
would make New York the first state to require that cigarettes meet
fire-safety standards.
</P>
<P>
   Legislators from both parties predicted that he would sign the
measure by the midnight deadline on Wednesday. The governor's
office said it would not reveal what he had done until Thursday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which has been hailed as a landmark measure by
anti-tobacco groups, passed the Assembly and the Senate more than a
month ago, without a single dissenting vote. But the governor has
repeatedly refused to give his views of it, and he did not inform
the Legislature of his conditions until Wednesday, the last day he
had, by law, to act on it.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans and Democrats in both houses expressed frustration
with Pataki's handling of the bill, saying that he was trying to
use it as leverage to win concessions on issues not directly
related to it.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki asked the Legislature to delay the fire-safety standards
by several months to make it easier for tobacco companies to
comply, and to impose fines on retailers that violate the law.
Officials in both parties, in both houses of the Legislature, said
they agreed on Wednesday to those demands, which would be addressed
in a follow-up bill.
</P>
<P>
   But the governor also imposed a second set of conditions,
seeking tough new criminal penalties for tobacco ``bootleggers''
who try to import or sell cigarettes without paying New York's
$1.11-per-pack tax, the highest in the nation; and restricting
Internet sales, which are now used to avoid payment of state taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmakers in both houses said that they did not necessarily
object to his demands, but that such complex issues should not have
been raised at the last minute and should not hold up the bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue of fire safety should stand on its own,'' said Sen.
Frank Padavan, a Queens Republican who sponsored the bill in his
house. ``We don't think that is something that has to be done as
part of this process. The governor has indicated that he supports
the general thrust of our bill, which is welcome news, and we hope
he'll sign it.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Grannis, a Manhattan Democrat who sponsored the
Assembly bill, said, ``I'm very confident we will reach an
agreement and the governor will approve the bill.''
</P>
<P>
   Cigarettes have long been made so that once lighted, they keep
burning, even when they are not being smoked. Anti-tobacco
advocates and some firefighters' groups have called for laws that
would require cigarettes to go out if they were not puffed on for a
few minutes, so that they would pose less of a fire risk. That
requirement, they contend, would prevent hundreds of fire deaths
nationally each year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill passed by the Legislature instructs the State Office of
Fire Prevention and Control to come up with flammability standards
by Nov. 1, 2001, after which cigarette makers would have 30 days to
comply. Lawmakers said that in response to the governor, they
agreed to change that provision to six months and impose a $1,000
fine on retailers found selling cigarettes violating the standards.
</P>
<P>
   Several brands of self-extinguishing cigarettes are already on
the market, including More, Merit, Virginia Slims, Capri Light and
Eve Lights. Some are based on the use of thicker paper, others on
altered chemical composition of the paper. Internal industry
reports that have been leaked say that making cigarettes less
flammable does not significantly raise the cost of making them or
affect their taste.
</P>
<P>
   But the law would result in lower sales, because a smoker who
walked away from a lighted cigarette for a few minutes would find
not ashes, but a stub that could be relighted.
</P>
<P>
   The tobacco industry waged a muted lobbying campaign against the
bill, arguing that it should be subject to a single national
standard rather than state-by-state rules. Such a standard, in
fact, is also the hope of anti-tobacco advocates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our basic thrust is not only to do something in New York
state, but also to motivate the Congress to act, which they've
spent years and years not doing,'' Padavan said. ``If we can do it
in New York, I think that would have an awful lot of impact
nationally.''

LAW PARTNER CHARGED IN DEATH OF KANSAS CITY ATTORNEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE LAMBE AND CHRISTINE VENDEL  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Kansas City lawyer was accused Wednesday of beating his law
partner to death.
</P>
<P>
   The charges are the latest development in an ongoing mystery
that started May 5 when a daylight attack mortally wounded the
victim in his downtown office.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Jackson County prosecutors charged Richard Buchli,
49, with second-degree murder and armed criminal action in the
death of Richard Armitage.
</P>
<P>
   Charges are mainly based on blood-splatter evidence on Buchli's
clothes. Authorities said there are still many unanswered questions
in Armitage's death, including a motive and a murder weapon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Evidence was sufficient to bring the charges,'' said County
Prosecutor Bob Beaird, but ``this investigation is ongoing.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchli posted $250,000 bond and was released Wednesday night.
Police said Buchli contends he is innocent but cannot explain the
victim's blood splatter on his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who answered the phone at Buchli's home Wednesday
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Buchli and a secretary for the two lawyers found Armitage, 49,
in his downtown office on May 5, a Friday afternoon. Armitage died
the following Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   At first, even the cause of death was unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Initially police and hospital officials thought Armitage died of
a gunshot wound, but the medical examiner found he died of head
trauma.
</P>
<P>
   Police arrested Buchli in his office around 4 p.m. Tuesday. On
Wednesday afternoon, they searched his house.
</P>
<P>
   According to court papers filed Wednesday:
</P>
<P>
   Lab tests found Armitage's blood _ ``high-velocity blood
splatter'' _ on Buchli's pants, shoes and shirt. Blood forms a
pattern of small drops and fine mist as it gets farther from a
victim's body. The blood pattern on Buchli's clothes matched that
on a lamp found near the victim.
</P>
<P>
   Buchli told police he left their law office on the 13th floor in
the Power &AMP; Light Building at 1:50 p.m. and went to lunch.
Surveillance video cameras showed him leaving at 2:10 p.m. They
also show Buchli returned at 2:40 p.m., waited outside for the
secretary to arrive and entered the building with her. They both
found the victim a short time later.
</P>
<P>
   Phone records show that Armitage received a California phone
call at 1:46 p.m. and it ended at 2:03 p.m. _ seven minutes before
the cameras recorded Buchli leaving.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, Buchli graduated from the University of Missouri-Kansas
City School of Law.
</P>
<P>
   He worked for the law firm Gould &AMP; Moore before joining the
Popham law firm as an associate in 1988. He did civil litigation.
Later he met Armitage when they worked together on a case, said
Dennis Egan, a director at the Popham law firm.
</P>
<P>
   Egan said Armitage and Buchli decided to form a partnership.
</P>
<P>
   ``It didn't look like (Buchli) was going to become a partner
here,'' Egan said. ``I think that is something he wanted to do, so
he left here to form a partnership with Richard Armitage.''
</P>
<P>
   Armitage and Buchli opened a 13th-floor office in 1995 at the
Power &AMP; Light Building.
</P>
<P>
   Besides being law partners, the two were friends, said Kathy
Armitage, the victim's widow. She said she and her husband often
socialized and had dinner with Buchli and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   At their firm, Buchli continued civil litigation work. Three
years ago, he represented Pamela Causey in a personal injury case,
and she was impressed with him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He seemed like a very nice person,'' Causey recalled.
</P>
<P>
   And around the office the two lawyers never gave a hint that
anything was amiss between them, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never saw anything that would lead me to believe they didn't
get along,'' Causey said. ``They were friendly and worked well
together.''
</P>
<P>
   The Buchlis live in a two-story house in the 900 block of W.
120th Terrace in an upper-middle class neighborhood. Neighbors said
Buchli and his wife had lived in the home since it was built about
14 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   They recalled seeing Buchli each morning smoking a cigarette as
he sat on a bench on his front porch, reading the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
   Beaird said prosecutors don't know of any other time a lawyer
was charged with murder in Jackson County.
</P>
<P>
   But ``the law profession is like anything else,'' he said.
``It's made up of human beings, so nothing is ever a surprise.''
</P>

DEMOCRATS RAISE RECORD $26.5 MILLION TO COME TO AID OF PARTY
</HEADLINE>
 
(Eds.: Rewrites with details thruout; adds 400 words) By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Most people shelled out just 50 bucks, but some
could not help giving or gathering $500,000. So there were
different ``tiers'' of donors in kind of a class system sprayed
throughout the giant MCI Sports Center Wednesday night, but all of
them were part of a history-making event: the biggest political
fund-raiser ever, raising $26.5 million in three hours for the
Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats billed the event as a tribute to President
Clinton, and the donors, from those in black tie to those in blue
jeans, were beckoned by the Midas of fund-raisers, Terry McAuliffe,
who, in the end, squeezed 13,625 people into a space designed for
12,000.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the designated beneficiary of the
party's treasure chest, hailed McAuliffe as ``the greatest
fund-raiser in the history of the universe.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore, dressed in a sage polo shirt with his Palm Pilot clipped
to his blue jeans, also declared that he would make reform of the
campaign finance system a top priority if elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those who had come up with half a million dollars for
the party included representatives of organized labor, fresh from
their defeat on Capitol Hill at the hands of the Clinton
administration on the China trade bill.
</P>
<P>
   But that battle seemed distant as many in the arena emitted
rock-concert-like shrieks when Clinton was introduced and Tina
Turner's pulsating hit, ``You're Simply the Best,'' blared through
the loud speakers.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Gore, this is the tune that his campaign has
been road testing as his campaign theme song. And it underscored a
sad reality for Gore: As at some of the other joint appearances of
the Clintons and Gores in the past, while Gore is meant to be the
star, Clinton steals the show. ``Four more years!'' was shouted
from the crowd as he spoke.
</P>
<P>
   Al DiRienzo, 68, a bricklayer from Maryland, reflected the
sentiment. He said that he was supporting Gore but that his
affection was for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the greatest president we've ever had,'' DiRienzo
said, ``and it's a shame we can't vote for him again.''
</P>
<P>
   After Tipper Gore and Hillary Rodham Clinton spoke, the arena
fell dark for a lengthy video tribute to Clinton and his eight-year
administration. It was a paean to overcoming adversity and was
awash in sentimentality.
</P>
<P>
   And when Clinton took the stage, he opened with a fiery, if
defensive challenge, to an unspoken suggestion that the vast sums
of money the party was raking in was inappropriate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe that it's corruption to take money to pass the
Brady Bill instead of beat it,'' he said, ``to pass the family and
medical leave bill so 21 million ordinary working people can take
some time off when their babies are born and their parents are sick
instead of beat it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he offered what appeared to be unrehearsed lines, including
bemused commentary on his advancing age.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to the video that had just unfolded, Clinton told the
audience: ``I had sort of mixed feelings looking at that film,
actually. I watched myself get grayer and grayer and grayer, and I
thought to myself, before I got into my second term here, I was
always the youngest person who did everything. Now I'm up here in
my old boots and my old jeans, and I'm just kind of an old
gray-haired red neck trying to put in some good months here.''
</P>
<P>
   McAuliffe accomplished his task: to beat the Republicans, who
raised a mere $21.3 million at their gala a month ago. He let them
gloat at their treasure chest and low-balled his estimates of what
the Democrats could raise, only to be able to trumpet his success
later.
</P>
<P>
   The money goes to the Democratic National Committee and will be
used to help Gore pay for commercials for his presidential
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Richardson, the secretary of energy, was on hand Wednesday
night and acknowledged that the money would come in handy,
especially when the advertising wars begin on television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think neither party is going to unilaterally disarm,''
Richardson said, going on to explain, as he stood by a table of
donors who had raised up to $500,000, ``We're the party of the
small donors, the grass roots.''
</P>
<P>
   Tables for dignitaries were spread across the floor of the
sports arena, where guests were served barbecue from restaurants in
Arkansas and Tennessee, home states of the president and vice
president, along with bottles of merlot and chardonnay. John
Vergos, whose family owns the popular barbecue restaurant
Rendezvous in Memphis, flew in 800 pounds of barbecued chicken and
beef ribs Wednesday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Up in the bleachers, guests had to buy their food at the regular
arena prices, for example, $3.75 for a cup of cola.
</P>
<P>
   John Bunting, 56, who works in social services in Baltimore,
paid $50 to attend Wednesday night's party. The Republicans are
trying to cast the presidential race as a ``personality contest,''
Bunting said, ``and that's a much tougher race for Gore.''
</P>
<P>
   Surveying the arena, he said that much of the crowd probably
came to pay tribute to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that Vice President Gore falls short,'' he said,
``it's that we're talking about the king.''

TAPES TELL FLIGHT 261'S FINAL MOMENTS 
FIRST RESEND; ORIGINAL WAS GARBLED
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the final terrifying minutes of doomed Alaska
Airlines Flight 261, the pilots told flight controllers of their
desperate struggle to stabilize the plane as it dived, leveled off
and finally plunged into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The last transmission was the words ``thank you,'' after the
crew was given permission to fly out over the ocean to make sure
there was no risk of ground casualties if the plane crashed on its
way to Los Angeles International Airport for an emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   Just two minutes later, the pilot of a private aircraft relayed
the tragedy: ``That plane has just started to do a big, huge
plunge.'' A commercial pilot flying nearby reported the plane had
``hit the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Audio tapes of the final minutes of Flight 261, which crashed
off the Ventura Coast on Jan. 31, killing all 88 aboard, were
released Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes reveal in vivid detail the efforts of Capt. Ted
Thompson, 53, and First Officer William Tansky, 57, to keep the
MD-83 airborne as they fought to overcome problems with the plane's
stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's crash off the coast of Port Hueneme ended what began
as a routine flight from Puerto Vallarta

DEMOCRATS SET RECORD BY RAISING $26 MILLION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Editors: adds detail in 2nd graph, expands quote in 5th graph) 
 
 
By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Even as presidential candidate Al Gore is vowing to
work for campaign finance reform, the Democratic Party Wednesday
shattered fund-raising records by raking in $26 million at a ``blue
jeans and barbecue'' gala.
</P>
<P>
   The take surpassed a single-day record for political
fund-raising set earlier this spring by the Republicans, who
collected $21 million in a tribute to their presidential candidate,
Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   The event Wednesday, billed as a tribute to President Clinton,
attracted more than 12,000 supporters to the MCI sports arena,
where they were entertained by such stars as Robin Williams, Stevie
Wonder, LeAnn Rimes and Darius Rucker of Hootie and the Blowfish.
</P>
<P>
   The guest of honor appeared in a video touting achievements of
his administration, then spoke to the gathering. He was
unapologetic about the prodigious fund-raising, saying money from
supporters helps the party accomplish its goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it's corruption to take money to pass the Brady
Bill (for background checks of firearms purchases), to pass the
family and medical leave bill, to pass the patients' bill of
rights, to reduce the deficit and get rid of the debt instead of
giving big breaks to special interests,'' Clinton said. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Vice President Gore said, if elected, his first goal will be to
pass campaign finance reform. ``If you elect me, the good news is
when we all come back here in four years, it won't cost as much,''
Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore also addressed gun control, noting that Charlton Heston,
just elected to a third term as president of the National Rifle
Association, called Gore ``the No. 1 foe of the gun lobby.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said, ``I wear that as a badge of honor.''
</P>
<P>
   He alluded to Heston's role as Moses in ``The Ten Commandments''
in a reference to his likely Republican opponent, Texas Gov. George
Bush. ``The last time Moses listened to a bush, the people wandered
in the desert for 40 years,'' Gore said.
</P>
<P>
   The gala underscored the growing fund-raising prowess of the
Democrats, who for years trailed significantly behind Republicans
in their ability to generate campaign cash.
</P>
<P>
   The competition was vividly on display in the nation's capital
Wednesday evening, as Republicans held their own event several
blocks from the Democratic gala and expected to raise $11 million
for House and Senate candidates. That fund-raiser featured former
President Bush.
</P>
<P>
   In the first 15 months of the 1999-2000 cycle, the Democrats
have raised $76 million in unrestricted ``soft money'' compared
with $84 million for the Republicans. That is a smaller gap than at
a similar point in the 1996 presidential election cycle, when the
Democrats raised $36 million and the Republicans collected $48
million in soft money.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans continue to be far ahead in collecting
restricted ``hard money '' contributions, raising $180 million to
the Democrats' $100 million in the first 15 months of the cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic officials sought to deflate any suggestion that they
were catering to wealthy contributors by stressing that
three-quarters of the attendees paid $50 to attend the event. The
menu included pork ribs and cole slaw flown in from the Rendezvous
Restaurant in Memphis, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the down-home theme, the event still drew its share of
influential donors who had either given or raised between $100,000
and $500,000. These donors were seated in prime front row tables on
the floor of the vast arena, while the $50 ticket holders sat up in
the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans noted the presence of these top donors as they
dismissed Democrats' claim that they were throwing a grass-roots
rally.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Paulitz, a spokesman for the Republican National
Committee, said that if everyone had paid $50 apiece the
fund-raiser would have had to attract 520,000 people to raise $26
million.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are trying to bill this thing tonight as a common folk
fund-raiser. But if you had common sense you would know this is a
sham,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Paulitz said that the fund-raiser also showed the weakness of
Gore because he had to rely on Clinton to help generate campaign
funds.
</P>
<P>
   While Clinton has been a tireless fund-raiser for his party,
much of the money he has helped bring in is intended to help his
vice president win the White House. The Gore campaign has proposed
that the party run $30 million in ads promoting his presidential
campaign in coming weeks.
</P>
<P>
   These party-financed issue ads have been criticized by campaign
finance advocates because they are viewed as a way of circumventing
contribution limits imposed on candidates.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has called for the elimination of the soft money to the
political parties and vowed not to let the Democratic Party run
such ads on his behalf unless the GOP did so first. Gore spokesman
Chris Lehane said that the Democrats are now justified in running
such ads because a series of conservative organizations have begun
airing ads against Gore.

Latino actors routinely overlooked 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hollywood provides few opportunities for Latino
performers and targets few productions to what is America's
fastest-growing minority with a $10 billion-a-year entertainment
appetite, a new study conducted for the Screen Actors Guild said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``Still Missing: Latinos In and Out of Hollywood,''
found that entertainment executives doubted the economic viability
of Latino-theme productions. It also showed that the industry
tended to revert to racial biases as the periodic outcries for
minority representation died down.
</P>
<P>
   While Latinos make up 11.5 percent of the population, they
``rarely occupy more than 2 percent of the available jobs in the
film and television industry,'' according to the study. Last week,
broadcast networks announced their new shows for the fall, with
virtually no starring roles given to Latino performers.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute for
SAG, gave TV and studio executives, producers, writers and
directors a chance to speak anonymously about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Several blamed the bottom line as a key reason there are few
Latino roles, pointing specifically to difficulties in marketing to
the geographically and culturally broad group, to the box office
failures of several Latino-theme movies since 1987's ``La Bamba,''
and to the fact that few Latino actors are recognized in foreign
markets.
</P>
<P>
   One studio executive said advocates have built a good ``social
case'' for minority inclusion but they have not effectively
addressed the business side.

   ``Studio executives will lend half an ear to a social case, but
the bottom line is that the corporate suites are running a
business, and business is about profits and potential profits,''
the executive said. ``Develop a business case and you will bring
about change.''
</P>
<P>
   The same individual said the industry tends to get fired up
about minority issues, starting internships after organizations
apply pressure, ``but as time passes, these programs fade away.''
</P>
<P>
   Actress Anne-Marie Johnson, national chairwoman of the guild's
Ethnic Employment Opportunity Committee, said part of the problem
is that producers and executives tend to make the whole genre of
Latino-theme movies pay the price for the failure of one film.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have minority-themed or minority-cast films and they
don't do well, the assumption is `Let's not do another one.'''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the guild has not yet examined all the supporting
players in the networks' fall shows, but she called the dearth of
Latinos in leads ``reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   She sounded a note of cautious optimism about Showtime's new
series, ``Resurrection Blvd.,'' which will debut June 26. Set in
East Los Angeles, it centers on a working-class Mexican-American
family.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that many of our members of color are very excited when
projects are created for specific ethnic groups,'' she said, happy
about the many jobs a large-cast series like ``Resurrection Blvd.''
creates.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to be very careful,'' Johnson added. ``We can't be
content just with employment. We have to make sure that images
progress with the progressions of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,200 actors responded to the mailed questionnaire,
out of 4,800 Latino guild members _ an extremely strong response
level and a good indication that this is a significant concern to
them, said Harry Pachon, TRPI president, who led the research team.

WEATHER CAUSING PROBLEMS IN MALIBU

<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ The NCAA women's tennis championships logo
includes an ocean wave and a sandy beach, but what stands out is
the bright yellow tennis ball shaped like the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Around Pepperdine these days, the logo seems misguided. Someone
forgot to include the mist cloud which is over everything.
</P>
<P>
   For the second consecutive day, the early-morning marine layer
led to misty conditions that delayed the start of play. Tuesday,
there were supposed to be two rounds of singles matches, but the
weather pushed that back to Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   When the same conditions prevailed Wednesday, tournament
officials had no choice but to delay the start, then play both
rounds.
</P>
<P>
   The third round of singles, which was supposed to start at 10
a.m. PDT, began around noon. The quarterfinals, supposed to start
at 1:30 p.m., didn't start until between 3:10 and 4 p.m. Then
another round of mist delayed three quarterfinals unt97u

TAPES TELL FLIGHT 261'S FINAL MOMENTS 
SECOND RESEND; FIRST TWO WERE GARBLED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOMINIC BERBEO 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the final terrifying minutes of doomed Alaska
Airlines Flight 261, the pilots told flight controllers of their
desperate struggle to stabilize the plane as it dived, leveled off
and finally plunged into the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
   The last transmission was the words ``thank you,'' after the
crew was given permission to fly out over the ocean to make sure
there was no risk of ground casualties if the plane crashed on its
way to Los Angeles International Airport for an emergency landing.
</P>
<P>
   Just two minutes later, the pilot of a private aircraft relayed
the tragedy: ``That plane has just started to do a big, huge
plunge.'' A commercial pilot flying nearby reported the plane had
``hit the water.''
</P>
<P>
   Audio tapes of the final minutes of Flight 261, which crashed
off the Ventura Coast on Jan. 31, killing all 88 aboard, were
released Wednesday by the Federal Aviation Administration.
</P>
<P>
   The tapes reveal in vivid detail the efforts of Capt. Ted
Thompson, 53, and First Officer William Tansky, 57, to keep the
MD-83 airborne as they fought to overcome problems with the plane's
stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   The plane's crash off the coast of Port Hueneme ended what began
as a routine flight from Puerto Vallarta, Mexico, to San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:09 p.m., more than three hours into the four-hour flight,
one of the pilots radioed controllers in Los Angeles that the plane
was in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Center, Alaska 261, we are, uh, in a dive here,'' said the
trembling voice from the cockpit, which the FAA did not identify.
``Yeah, we're out of 26,000 feet, we're in a vertical dive - not a
dive yet - but, uh, we've lost vertical control of our airplane.''
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, the pilot - growing breathless - radioed the
plane had dropped 2,300 feet. ``We've got it back under control
there - no we don't.''
</P>
<P>
   One minute later, the Alaska crew indicated they have ``kinda
stabilized'' the craft and climbed back up to 24,000 feet. ``We're
slowing down here and, uh, we're going, uh, to do a little
troubleshooting.''
</P>
<P>
   At 4:15, the crew said it had found the source of the trouble,
and had descended to 22,500 feet. ``We're with you ... we have a
jammed stabilizer and we're maintaining altitude with difficulty,
uh, but, uh, we can maintain altitude, we think, and our intention
is to land at Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Controllers gave the pilots some bearings and the OK to land at
Los Angeles International Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Center, Alaska 261, I need to, uh, get down (to 10,000 feet),
change my configuration, make sure I can control the jet, and I'd
like to do that out here over the bay if I may.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the go-ahead at 4:17 p.m., the pilot calmly responded,
``Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   Those were the last two words heard from Flight 261.
</P>
<P>
   At 4:19, the first report of imminent trouble came from the
private pilot who saw the jet in a nose dive. The controller
contacted a Sky West pilot in the area.
</P>
<P>
   ``Another pilot reports he's really looking pretty bad there
ahead and to your right. Do you see him?''
</P>
<P>
   The Sky West pilot responded: ``Yes sir, ah, I concur he is, uh,
definitely in a nose-down, uh, position, descending quite
rapidly.''
</P>
<P>
   The pilots of the private craft and the Sky West plane monitored
the doomed Alaska jet, and at 4:20 p.m., reported the impact in
solemn voices.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's just hit the water,'' the private pilot told
controllers, followed seconds later by the Sky West pilot saying,
``Ah, yes sir, he, ah, he, ah, hit the water. He's, ah, down.''
</P>
<P>
   Four months after the crash, the National Transportation Safety
Board is still investigating the cause.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't know when the probe will be completed,'' said NTSB
spokesman Phil Frame. ``Investigations like this usually take at
least a year.''
</P>
<P>
   The investigation has focused on the jet's vertical stabilizer,
a winglike portion of the tail used to keep the plane level. Early
evidence points to a worn jackscrew mechanism, which would have
given the pilots less control of the stabilizer.
</P>
<P>
   Alaska Airlines, one of the 10 largest airlines in the country,
has been under federal investigation of its Oakland maintenance
facility since 1998 for maintenance issues.

 Latino actors routinely overlooked 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VALERIE KUKLENSKI 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hollywood provides few opportunities for Latino
performers and targets few productions to what is America's
fastest-growing minority with a $10 billion-a-year entertainment
appetite, a new study conducted for the Screen Actors Guild said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study, ``Still Missing: Latinos In and Out of Hollywood,''
found that entertainment executives doubted the economic viability
of Latino-theme productions. It also showed that the industry
tended to revert to racial biases as the periodic outcries for
minority representation died down.
</P>
<P>
   While Latinos make up 11.5 percent of the population, they
``rarely occupy more than 2 percent of the available jobs in the
film and television industry,'' according to the study. Last week,
broadcast networks announced their new shows for the fall, with
virtually no starring roles given to Latino performers.
</P>
<P>
   The study, conducted by the Tomas Rivera Policy Institute for
SAG, gave TV and studio executives, producers, writers and
directors a chance to speak anonymously about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Several blamed the bottom line as a key reason there are few
Latino roles, pointing specifically to difficulties in marketing to
the geographically and culturally broad group, to the box office
failures of several Latino-theme movies since 1987's ``La Bamba,''
and to the fact that few Latino actors are recognized in foreign
markets.
</P>
<P>
   One studio executive said advocates have built a good ``social
case'' for minority inclusion but they have not effectively
addressed the business side.
</P>
<P>
   ``Studio executives will lend half an ear to a social case, but
the bottom line is that the corporate suites are running a
business, and business is about profits and potential profits,''
the executive said. ``Develop a business case and you will bring
about change.''
</P>
<P>
   The same individual said the industry tends to get fired up
about minority issues, starting internships after organizations
apply pressure, ``but as time passes, these programs fade away.''
</P>
<P>
   Actress Anne-Marie Johnson, national chairwoman of the guild's
Ethnic Employment Opportunity Committee, said part of the problem
is that producers and executives tend to make the whole genre of
Latino-theme movies pay the price for the failure of one film.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have minority-themed or minority-cast films and they
don't do well, the assumption is `Let's not do another one.'''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson said the guild has not yet examined all the supporting
players in the networks' fall shows, but she called the dearth of
Latinos in leads ``reprehensible.''
</P>
<P>
   She sounded a note of cautious optimism about Showtime's new
series, ``Resurrection Blvd.,'' which will debut June 26. Set in
East Los Angeles, it centers on a working-class Mexican-American
family.

creates.
</P>
<P>
   ``But we have to be very careful,'' Johnson added. ``We can't be
content just with employment. We have to make sure that images
progress with the progressions of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,200 actors responded to the mailed questionnaire,
out of 4,800 Latino guild members _ an extremely strong response
level and a good indication that this is a significant concern to
them, said Harry Pachon, TRPI president, who led the research team.
</P>
<P>
   The Latino actors who responded worked an average of 12 days
last year on SAG projects, for an annual income of about $12,000,
compared with about $17,000 for their non-Latino, white colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Pachon said Latino actors said they are consistently passed over
for ethnically nondescript ``crossover'' roles, such as a lawyer, a
doctor, a teacher, a cop. They also are locked out of jobs if they
don't look or sound ``Latino,'' yet if they (ital)do(off) fit
directors' and writers' molds, they are given stereotypical
characters to play.
</P>
<P>
   ``Forty-six percent of our respondents say that stereotype
includes Mestizo features ... meaning a blend of European and
Indian characteristics,'' Pachon told a news conference. ``So if
you're too dark, you won't get cast as a Latino. If you're too
white, you won't get cast as a Latino. You have to pick that magic
midpoint to be cast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secondly and very disturbingly, 30 percent of our respondents
say that to be cast as a Latino, you have to have a Spanish
accent,'' he said. ``Because of those two characteristics, perhaps
because of the darker color of skin and the accent, they are cast
in serving-class roles - Jose the busboy, Maria the maid, the
carwash attendant.''
</P>
<P>
   He said an additional 20 percent complained about too many
criminal roles.
</P>
<P>
   Pachon said Hollywood has continued to underestimate the income
traced to Latino consumers. He said in 1998, Latinos spent about
$500 million on movie tickets, enough to ensure the success of five
blockbusters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a giant market out there just waiting to be tapped,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   It also is growing at a faster rate than other market segments.
From 1994 to 1998, according to U.S. Bureau of Labor figures,
Latino families increased their entertainment spending by 5.6
percent while non-Latino, white families actually decreased their
entertainment expenditures by 5.3 percent. In the same time span,
African-American spending remained flat overall.
</P>
<P>
   Bel Hernandez, editor and publisher of the entertainment trade
magazine Latin Heat, said studios have failed to reach the Latino
market because they are relying on the same old marketing firms
that use outmoded approaches to the bilingual, urban and suburban
audiences.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez said the success of Ricky Martin and other Latino
music stars seems to have awakened entertainment executives to the
potential market, and that could trigger changes in the movie and
TV segments.
</P>
<P>
   As for solutions, many SAG members asked their union to play a
more aggressive role, whether it is through affirmative action
measures or advocating its minorities with casting directors and
writers.
</P>
<P>
   On the industry side, the consensus was that such changes would
have to come from the top down. But progress isn't likely to happen
overnight. One TV executive, asked how to bring about change,
replied: ``I don't know.''

ROYALS END RANGERS' WINNING STREAK AT 7
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Kenny Rogers pitched pretty well last night
for a guy who has been sitting around 12 days nursing a sore
shoulder and poked eye.
</P>
<P>
   But Kansas City's Jeff Suppan was a little better. His pitching
and a seventh-inning defensive breakdown by the Rangers brought
their seven-game winning streak to end with a 3-0 loss to the
Royals at Kauffman Stadium last night.
</P>
<P>
   Suppan held the Rangers scoreless on six hits and three walks
through eight innings before Jerry Spradlin retired the side in
order in the ninth to complete the shutout. It's the second time
the Rangers have been shut out this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppan pitched a great game,'' Rangers designated hitter
Rafael Palmeiro said. ``He had good movement on his ball, changed
speeds and hit his spots. See, it doesn't matter if the ball is
juiced or the bat is juiced. If a guy hits his spots, throws
strikes and changes speeds, he can still win, and that's what
Suppan did tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Three of the hits and two of the walks came in the first three
innings, but the Rangers went 0-for-4 with runners in scoring
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he gave us some pitches to hit in the early
innings,'' left fielder Chad Curtis said. ``Mid-game to late he
started making good pitches, but we had some opportunities early in
the game and didn't take advantage of them.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers, for all their firepower lately, still have some
players in hitting funks. Palmeiro is in a 12-for-60 skid, Ruben
Mateo has two hits in 23 at-bats and Royce Clayton is hitless in 14
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers allowed three runs in 6 1/3 innings but couldn't shake
the physical misfortune that has dogged him through May. After
straining his shoulder on a little flip to first base in his
previous start May 11 and having his right eye poked while playing
with his 3-year-old son, Trevor, on Friday, Rogers had to leave
last night's game in the seventh inning after taking a groundball
off his right knee.
</P>
<P>
   That was one of several plays not made that inning that allowed
the Royals to give Suppan two extra unearned runs of support. The
Rangers' meltdown started with one out when Clayton fumbled Rey
Sanchez's grounder for an error.
</P>
<P>
   ``He kind of cued it, and it took a weird hop,'' said Clayton,
who went 0-for-3. ``I went to get my hop, and the ball stayed down.
It's just the way my game is going lately.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Damon followed with a grounder back to Rogers, who did
his best Eddie Belfour ``butterfly'' stop to keep the ball from
going through. Instead, it caromed off Rogers' right knee and
toward third baseman Mike Lamb, who made a diving stop but threw
too late to get Damon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried to get a little extra on my fastball, and that gave me
less time to react,'' said Rogers, who made a tougher catch on Joe
Randa's line drive in the second. ``Less effort and I would have
had it.''
</P>
<P>
   With runners at first and second, Francisco Cordero took over
for Rogers and got Carlos Febles to hit a double-play grounder
right at Lamb. But second baseman Luis Alicea had trouble on the
turn, and the Rangers got only one out.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't get a hold of it; I couldn't get it out my glove
quickly,'' Alicea said.
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers paid dearly for that when Mike Sweeney doubled to
left-center field, bringing home two runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't play well defensively that inning,'' Rangers manager
Johnny Oates said. ``When you play a low-scoring game, defense is
imperative. One run is a lot easier to come back from than three.''
</P>
<P>
   Rogers had ice on his right] knee after the game, but the
Rangers don't expect it to be a problem. Rogers was also feeling
better about his shoulder, which gave him no trouble through the
night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad to go out there and not feel anything,'' Rogers
said. nn

 PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH APPROVES `HOLY UNIONS' FOR GAYS, LESBIANS  &HT;     By DON LATTIN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a ruling that could spark a conservative backlash, the
highest court of the Presbyterian Church ruled Wednesday that its
ministers may perform ``holy union'' ceremonies for gay and lesbian
couples _ as long as they don't call it ``marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   And in another victory for gay rights advocates, the
denomination's Permanent Judicial Commission ruled that the church
may accept a young gay man in New Jersey as a candidate for
ordained ministry.
</P>
<P>
   The two cases were the first serious challenges to a 1996 church
law requiring all Presbyterian ministers and elders to ``practice
fidelity in marriage and chastity in singleness.''
</P>
<P>
   Church marriage, however, is limited to heterosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Pam Byers, executive director of San Francisco-based Covenant
Network of Presbyterians, a national advocacy group seeking a more
tolerant attitude toward gays and lesbians, welcomed the two
rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Byers noted that neither ruling actually changes church law, but
gives Presbyterians more latitude in ministering to gays and
lesbians.
</P>
<P>
   The church court did not overturn the ban on the ordination of
noncelibate homosexuals, but it chose not to extend the prohibition
to seminarians and candidates for ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, the 16-member judicial commission did not clear the
way for gay ``marriage,'' but gave qualified support to church
ceremonies that bless the union of gay and lesbian couples.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can bless boats and pets and retirements, you can ask
for God's blessings on significant relationships,'' Byers said.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, conservatives argued the opposite before the high
court, which was considering a 1998 ``holy union'' ceremony for two
gay men at South Presbyterian Church in Dobbs Ferry, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney Gordon Fish of Montclair, N.J., told the court that
``holy union'' ceremonies are a ``sham'' and ``a case of semantic
hair-splitting.''
</P>
<P>
   Fish said the two men being blessed ``didn't talk about being
holy-unioned, but about being married. They didn't order a holy
union cake, but a wedding cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Presbyterian Church spokesman Jerry Van Marter predicted the
controversy over ``holy union'' ceremonies will dominate a General
Assembly that convenes from June 24 to July 1 in Long Beach to set
national policy for the 2.6 million-member denomination.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were already expected to talk about holy unions, but this
will rachet up the debate to the level of hysteria,'' Van Marter
said.
</P>
<P>
   Three regional church bodies, including the conservative
Presbytery of San Joaquin in California's Central Valley, already
had introduced legislation seeking an outright ban on holy union
ceremonies for gay and lesbian couples.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned about an uproar in the pews, the two top leaders of
the Presbyterian Church Wednesday issued an unusual ``pastoral
letter'' about the court rulings.
</P>
<P>
   Presbyterian Church Moderator Freda Gardner and Stated Clerk
Clifton Kirkpatrick acknowledged in the letter that the gay rights
debate has revealed ``deep, and often conflicting, convictions
among Presbyterians.''
</P>
<P>
   They stressed that the court ruling on ordination involved a gay
man in New Jersey ``who is currently celibate but who intends to
participate in a fully sexual way in a future monogamous same-sex
relationship.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the decision on ``holy union'' ceremonies, they stressed
the commission's warning that ministers must still ``take special
care to avoid any confusion of (same sex) services with services of
Christian marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, they said pastors should be given ``wide
latitude'' for ``blessing people in a variety of relationships,
life situations and endeavors, including those that might involve
two persons of the same gender.''
</P>
<P>
   Bob Davis, executive director of the Presbyterian Forum, a
conservative evangelical group, said the church should prohibit
same-sex ``blessings,'' along with gay marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Citing Biblical condemnations of homosexuality, Davis said,
``God calls homosexual behavior sinful. We should not bless what
God has called sinful.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis' organization, based in San Marcos (San Diego County),
describes itself as ``mired in a battle for the soul and
structure'' of the Presbyterian Church. It's one of several
conservative Presbyterian groups expected to play an active role at
next month's national convention.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month, the United Methodist Church held its
quadrennial convention in Cleveland, where it overwhelmingly voted
to retain its ban on ``holy union'' services and homosexual clergy.
Those issues are also expected to spark lively debate at a national
convention of Episcopalians to be held July 5-14 in Denver.

   CHINA-TRADE-ASSESS (Washington) _ With his narrow victory on
trade with China, President Clinton has finally defined his imprint
on U.S. foreign policy: As the president who conducted the
post-Cold War experiment of using American economic power to foster
political change among America's neighbors and its potential
adversaries. It is a path he set out on in 1993, when 10 months
into his presidency he defied his own party and pushed through the
North American Free Trade agreement with Mexico and Canada. A news

   SRILANKA-INDIA (New Delhi, India) _ India, chastened by its
disastrous intervention more than a decade ago in the brutish war
that has long plagued Sri Lanka, its island neighbor to the south,
is nonetheless gingerly stepping back into a conflict that has once
again reached a crisis stage. Officials here continue to say India
will not send in its own troops or supply arms to Sri Lanka, which
is battling separatist ethnic Tamil rebels. But the defense
minister and the national security adviser have suggested in recent
days that the Indian Navy is prepared to evacuate 30,000 Sri Lankan
troops at the request of the Sri Lankan government under certain
conditions. By Celia W. Dugger.

the entrance. One had a long graying beard and a brown fedora; the
other was missing some teeth and wore a fisherman's hat. Like them,
Westbeth is showing its age. The buildings look a little seedy: the
Corbusian curved balconies seem to be rusting away; the industrial

 PLEASE PUT YOUR RINGER ON VIBRATE  &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The cell phone user is on the lam.
</P>
<P>
   He has been driven out of restaurants and bars and into back
alleys and bathrooms, like a junkie.
</P>
<P>
   He (or she) is being flipped off on the highways, scorned on the
sidewalks, shushed on buses and trains.
</P>
<P>
   A leper for our times.
</P>
<P>
   And why? The poor guy is just making a telephone call. It's not
like he's smoking or picking his nose or trimming his toenails.
</P>
<P>
   I admit it, the cell people annoy me at times. I'm in the market
selecting a watermelon when a man walks toward me, looks me in the
eye, smiles, says with much enthusiasm, ``Hey, what's going on, how
you doin'?''
</P>
<P>
   I start to reply, but the man brushes past me, and I notice he's
talking on his cell.
</P>
<P>
   And volume? Based purely on observation, I'd say that 75 percent
of cell phone users are talking to their deaf grandmothers.
</P>
<P>
   But what if we could get a little courtesy going? Would it
really be so terrible if the guy at the next restaurant table is
quietly checking in with his stockbroker or baby sitter, as long as
he's not roaring and swearing and pounding the table like a drunken
pirate?
</P>
<P>
   Jim Brandt, who owns the Gold Coast restaurant on California
St., has made a stunning discovery: Scorn and ridicule aren't going
to make cell phones go away.
</P>
<P>
   Brandt went to the top of Mount Sutro and returned with the Ten
Commandments of Cell Phoning, which I herewith edit to the most
vital seven:
</P>
<P>
   When driving, pull over ... When walking, watch out ...
Remember: Even punks have cell phones ... Indoors, put ringer on
``vibrate''... Speak SOFTLY ... Excuse yourself (one-sided
conversations are so dull).
</P>
<P>
   HOW COME New York gets the good stuff?
</P>
<P>
   Steve Beck reports from the Apple: ``Low-tech New York subways
have high-tech ticket machines _ big, shiny consoles with
multilingual screen, color video, they accept bills, coins, credit
cards, ATM cards, IOUs ... And dispense thin plastic magnetic cards
good on subways, buses, ferries. ...''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, our BART ticket machines are so old, they accept gold
dust.
</P>
<P>
   YOU DIRTY RAT: Nicole Bilotti was reading the spring issue of
``Calling,'' the newsletter in your Pac Bell phone bill. An article
titled ``It's an Inside Wire Job'' reveals a common cause of phone
wire problems:

<P>
   ``When pesky rodents get too cozy with your wiring ...''
</P>
<P>
   Now we have to worry about kinky rats. Used to be they'd be
happy playing with a hunk of moldy cheese.
</P>
<P>
   MORE EVIDENCE that S.F. is the center of the hip universe: Oscar
de la Renta jetted into town to receive an honorary doctorate from
the Academy of Art College, which is gaining a worldwide rep for
its design school.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Oscar handed out two scholarships to work with his fashion
design people in New York and Paris.
</P>
<P>
   For two days this week, Willie Brown was the second-best-dressed
dude in town. And George Hamilton had the second-best tan.
</P>
<P>
   RESCUED from the scrap heap: The Washington Square Penny Pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Moose started the event in '76 at the Washington Square Bar &AMP;
Grill, to raise money for St. Anthony's Dining Room. Ed moved on,
and this year, the Washbag abandoned the pitch.
</P>
<P>
   So Moose took it back, will hold it Monday at 1 p.m. on the
sidewalk in front of his restaurant on Stockton, facing Washington
Square Park. Celebrities, politicians, athletes, chefs, tossing
pennies against a wall.
</P>
<P>
   THE NEW RULES of grammar, as observed by Molly Ditmore of
listen.com, a music downloading biz where the kids also send in
their thoughts:
</P>
<P>
   ``You can never have enough exclamation marks ... It is
apparently acceptable in high school to replace `s' with `z' ...
Asterisks replace vowels to slip naughty words past the profanity
filter ... Forget grammar, and spellcheck is a total waste of time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The innernet (cq)  &LR; sure is making kids learn smarter.''
</P>
<P>
   A YOUNG single mother disappeared from the Monterey area more
than a month ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The local merchants have managed to scrape up $4,000 in reward
money to help find her,'' says Carma Allen. ``It's too bad she
didn't have a dog with her.''
</P>
<P>
   MAYBE GETTING bounced off his longtime gig on radio KNBR has
sent Rush Limbaugh reeling.
</P>
<P>
   Rush confessed that he auditioned for ABC's Monday Night
Football. Insiders tell me Limbaugh won't get the job as announcer
Al Michaels' sidekick, but has a good shot at being offered a
high-profile spot if the Goodyear Blimp decides to retire.
</P>
<P>
   I'M SURPRISED that Chuck Quackenbush was so upset. You'd think
he would have ambush insurance.

INDIAN TRIBES FLEX MONEY MUSCLES
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KEVIN FAGAN 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Flush with gambling revenue, California's Indian tribes have
paid out about $114 million for political campaigns since 1998, far
surpassing any other interest group to become the nearly invisible
giant of state campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   And though most of that money was spent on their own two
gambling ballot measures _ including Proposition 1A, the initiative
overwhelmingly passed in March to allow an explosion of
Nevada-style gaming on Indian lands _ the cash also went flying in
sizable wads toward politicians.
</P>
<P>
   The state's top 22 Indian gambling tribes or organizations
collectively donated more than $7 million to legislative or
statewide candidates in 1997 and 1998, dwarfing all other interest
groups, according to statistics being compiled by California Common
Cause.
</P>
<P>
   The second-biggest spender in that period was the state prison
guard union, the California Correctional Peace Officers
Association, which gave $1.9 million to candidates. And though
donations from similarly minded law enforcement organizations would
raise that total if added in, ``There is no way they could all come
close to the tribal spending,'' said Common Cause Executive
Director Jim Knox.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an extraordinary amount of money, and it makes Native
Americans the biggest political campaign contributors in the
state,'' said Knox, who expects to issue a report detailing the
expenditures early next month. ``What this shows is that the
state's tribes have very quickly come from relative obscurity to
become the No. 1 political power (in terms of political money) in
the state.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1995 and 1996, for example, the same tribal interests spent
only $950,000. And if you go back to the late 1980s, before
reservation casino gambling became a cash fountain, Indians spent
virtually nothing _ mostly because they didn't have much to spend.
</P>
<P>
   The irony is that there isn't a single self-described Indian
legislator in the state Capitol. That makes the need to have a
voice through campaign donations all the more crucial, Indians say.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody took notice of us before, and our issues were never
addressed in Sacramento because we were not able to lobby before,''
said Barbara Gonzales Lyons, tribal council vice chairwoman of the
Agua Caliente Band of Cahuilla Indians, which runs a booming casino
near Palm Springs. ``Ten years ago, we didn't even have the funds
to take care of our own people, let alone donate to campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``But now that we have gaming, we can move forward and protect
not just our gaming interests, but our people's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   &LR; sh1  &LR; Lots of Issues
</P>
<P>
   That means everything from tribal-vs.-state rights on child
custody cases to environmental and fire control issues on local
lands bordering her reservation, Lyons said. It would be nice if
everyone could be heard in Sacramento, regardless of their funding
heft, ``but that would be an idealistic world,'' she said. ``We
have to deal with the way things are.''
</P>
<P>
   From 1995 to 1998, Lyons' tribe gave $1.6 million to statewide
and legislative candidates _ second only, among California gaming
tribes, to the donations from the Morongo Band of Mission Indians,
which gave $1.7 million.
</P>
<P>
   In propelling money toward Sacramento power brokers, the Agua
Caliente and other tribes were merely doing what has always been
done by doctors, lawyers, police officers and every other group
with a vested interest in legislation, Lyons and others said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're only playing by the existing rules, and it's hard to
fault the Indians, or the prison guards, or anyone else who is
spending their money legally,'' said Tony Miller, a former
secretary of state. ``Clearly, money talks, and these are wise
investments.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said the sheer magnitude of donations, Indian and
otherwise, is an example of why campaign reform is badly needed in
California. And he noted that beyond political circles, the growing
spending muscle of Indian tribes seems to have gone largely
unnoticed, outside of brief attention paid to gaming initiative
spending.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will change,'' he said. ``Most people don't have a clue
about what's happened, but they will soon. We are on our way to
becoming ` &LR; Nevada West,' &LR;  and when people see full-blown gambling
all over the place, they will understand that the Indians have
become real forces.''
</P>
<P>
   That recognition will sit just fine with Dave Baron, spokesman
for the Barona Band of Mission Indians in San Diego County, which
donated $588,300 to candidates in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are active members of society and in Sacramento, that's all
this really shows,'' said Baron. ``We support good government, and
so we help people who want to do good government. ''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tribal spending is being directed at Democrats, not
surprising considering the traditional alliance between the party
and Indians. And the tribes seem to be getting results.
</P>
<P>
   Knox said that other than the nearly universal legislative
support for Indian gaming, one ``blatant example'' of tribal cash
appearing to buy influence came in the positioning of Proposition
1A on the ballot.
</P>
<P>
   It should have been Proposition 12, ``since propositions are
assigned numbers in order based on when they qualify,'' Knox
pointed out. ``But in this case the Legislature passed a special
bill to put it first on the ballot. This could not happen for just
anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The significance of the positioning is that the farther down the
ballot voters go, the more prone they are to either vote no or
simply not mark off a vote at all, Knox said. Legislators said they
put it first on the ballot because they considered it a high
priority, just as they did when they accorded similar positioning
to another Proposition 1A, the 1998 measure that authorized $9.2
billion in school bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The one politician tribes spent the most on in recent years is
the top man in state government, Gov. Gray Davis, who also was the
architect of the state-tribal gaming compact that formed the heart
of Proposition 1A. Indian gaming interests ponied up $902,605 for
his 1998 campaign in cash, in-kind and independent expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, Democratic Lt. Gov. Cruz Bustamante took in
$603,250 in tribal gaming donations. Rounding out the top three
recipients of tribal attention that year, with $832,250 in
donations, was Dave Stirling, the failed Republican candidate for
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   Stirling, a rare Republican to be backed by tribes, was not a
surprising pick considering that his opponent was Democrat Bill
Lockyer _ who, having crafted many of the existing gambling control
laws, was considered only tepidly friendly to tribal gaming
interests.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer received only $185,350 in 1998, placing him ninth on the
tribal donations list, but since then, he has worked to firm up
relations with tribes. He has taken a gentle hand in setting up
joint tribe-state oversight regulations under Proposition 1A, and
just last month he allowed the Barona tribe to hold a golfing
fund-raiser in his name.
</P>
<P>
   Lockyer donated the $10,000 raised at the event to charity after
critics gored him for getting too cozy with the very industry he
will have a role in regulating.
</P>
<P>
   But that flap was just a speed bump in the Indian nations'
headlong rush toward political power through campaign cash. Now
that Proposition 1A has opened the doors to megabucks Nevada-style
gambling at reservations, tribal money power will continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of money spent on the two gaming initiatives is the
clearest indicator of that heft. The $67 million tribes poured onto
Proposition 5 in 1998 _ which overwhelmingly passed but was
overturned by the state Supreme Court _ was a state record for
initiative spending. And the $40 million spent on Proposition 1A
dwarfed the $44,000 raised and spent by the measure's opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Barring future initiatives, it remains to be seen whether the
tribes will continue opening their wallets to candidates. But the
money certainly will be there.
</P>
<P>
   The state's tribes already pull down $1.4 billion a year in
revenue, but because of newly allowed slot machines, the figure is
expected to blossom to $4.4 billion by 2004 _ making California the
biggest gambling state outside Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Davis, whose support for the Indians' gaming venture puts him in
marked contrast to his predecessor, Pete Wilson, makes no apologies
for taking tribal money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's put it in perspective,'' said the governor's senior
political adviser, Garry South. ``In 1998, remember, we spent about
$35 million on the primary and general elections, and when you
raise and spend that kind of money, no one group of donors has
disproportionate standing. We have a very broad base.''
</P>
<P>
   That said, he acknowledged that gaming tribes ``are very
important political players now'' and as such, they deserve
respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``And luckily,'' he said with a chuckle, ``they tend to be
Democratic. It helps counterbalance all the money the Republicans
get from the National Rifle Association and the tobacco
companies.''

DAVIS VETOES BILL PERMITTING FAMILY LEAVE FOR PARTNERS 
</HEADLINE>
   By GREG LUCAS 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO _ Bowing to business group opposition, Gov. Gray
Davis vetoed a bill Wednesday that would have allowed employees to
use family leave to care for a domestic partner.
</P>
<P>
   The veto brought sharp criticism from the author of the bill,
which also would have expanded family leave to include care for
siblings, adult children and grandparents.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty cruel news for working people with loved
ones who are dying at home,'' said Sen. Tom Hayden, D-Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   The bill was opposed by the California Manufacturing and
Technology Association, which said the bill would be an
``administrative nightmare'' for employers, and the Committee on
Moral Concerns.
</P>
<P>
   One supporter of the bill heaped criticism on Davis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm outraged,'' said Jeff Sheehy, director of Equal Benefits
Advocates and an activist who helped draft San Francisco's
domestic-partners benefits law. ``He's denying us our basic
humanity. He's saying our partners aren't as important as his
wife.''
</P>
<P>
   In his veto message, the Democratic governor said the bill
broadens family leave ``far beyond what any other state has
permitted to a relationship outside the family _ specifically to
individuals who live together to share expenses if one of those
individuals subsequently becomes seriously ill.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden criticized Davis for what he said was kowtowing to
business groups, which complained that such a law would more than
double the number of people qualifying for family leave and create
administrative headaches because employees could take time off in
one 12-week block or an hour at a time.
</P>
<P>
   ``The governor's position is that any bill affecting business
has to be signed off by business,'' Hayden said. ``By that point of
view, family leave never would have become law in California or the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's family leave law requires employers to allow family
leave for a birth, adoption or serious illness of a child. Family
leave can also be used to care for a sick parent or spouse or
because of the employee's health.
</P>
<P>
   &LR; COL. 1 of VETO25 () &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &LR;  Hayden's bill would have added domestic partners, grandparents,
adult children and siblings who depend on the employee for care and
who share a residence with the employee.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Davis) agrees with family leave law for husbands and wives
and their children, but he doesn't want it extended to
grandparents, siblings and domestic partners,' Hayden said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Davis signed a bill creating a statewide
domestic-partner registry and extended health benefits to domestic
partners of state workers.
</P>
<P>
   But he opposed other bills and, since then, has been reluctant
to expand the rights given to domestic partners further.
</P>
<P>
   He will be tested this year. There are bills which, among other
things, allow domestic partners to inherit property, make funeral
arrangements and sue for wrongful death.
</P>
<P>
   Hayden said the genesis for the bill came from a gay member of
his staff whose partner was dying.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw very clearly he had to choose between his job and taking
care of a loved one. I could see what he was going through and how
his morale on the job was very strained. We worked it out. But not
every employee can get that kind of arrangement.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayden, who is leaving the Legislature next year, said he has
not decided whether to work with Davis this year on a compromise or
let future lawmakers tackle the issue.

 PROVISIONS ON RIGHTS DISPLEASE BEIJING  &HT;     By ROBERT COLLIER 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   By most accounts, the margin of victory in Wednesday's historic
trade vote was provided by measures that would increase monitoring
of China's human rights record _ and may create new friction
between Washington and Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials reacted angrily early Thursday to human rights
provisions in the bill, calling them ``unacceptable to the Chinese
government'' and indicating that they may be blocked outright _ as
Beijing has done with similar, more limited measures in the past.
</P>
<P>
   At best, many experts say, the measures will produce slow,
bureaucratic baby steps toward reform.
</P>
<P>
   The human-rights provisions were added in the last days of
furious lobbying to pass the bill for permanent normal trade
relations, or PNTR.
</P>
<P>
   The measures' authors, Rep. Sander Levin, D-Michigan, and Rep.
Doug Bereuter, R-Neb., touted them as a formula for two-track
change for China _ bringing human-rights pressure on Beijing at the
same time as American corporations open the way for capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   The vision worked like magic, winning the votes of dozens of
undecided Democrats and Republicans who had feared that by ending
the annual vote on Chinese trade benefits, Congress would lose its
leverage over Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without (the additions), chances are PNTR will not pass,''
warned Commerce Secretary William Daley on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The provisions would do the following:
</P>
<P>
   -- Create a commission appointed by the White House and Congress
to monitor a broad range human rights and make recommendations each
year to Congress. The panel would be similar to the so-called
Helsinki Commission, which watched for human-rights abuses in
Eastern Europe during the latter years of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   -- Create a task force for monitoring prison labor in China, and
authorize U.S. Customs officials to visit alleged convict labor
sites.
</P>
<P>
   -- Help China rewrite its laws to include internationally
recognized labor rights; train Chinese government officials;
educate workers about their legal rights; and fund Chinese and
foreign nongovernmental organizations to work on these issues.
</P>
<P>
   In Beijing Thursday, Chinese officials praised the U.S. approval
of PNTR but blasted the bill's human-rights provisions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Chinese government strongly opposes any use of human
rights and other issues as an excuse to interfere in China's
internal affairs or to damage China's interests,'' said Foreign
Trade Ministry spokesman Hu Chusheng. ``We urge the U.S. side to
correct its wrongdoing and guarantee the healthy and smooth
development of China-U.S. economic cooperation and trade.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the Chinese have grudgingly tolerated U.S. criticism
of rights abuses, as long as it was mere talk. But never before
have they allowed direct American human-rights advocacy on Chinese
territory.
</P>
<P>
   American human-rights groups said Wednesday that the new
monitoring and advisory groups created by PNTR will have a tall
order.
</P>
<P>
   ``It all depends on whether these commissions intend to press on
the more core human rights,'' said Mike Jendrzejczyk,
(cq) &LR; Washington director for Asia at Human Rights Watch.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this program is used to help defend the rights of workers
to assert their own grievances, China will clearly draw a tough
line and not allow any of it. It's going to be a long, difficult
uphill struggle.''
</P>
<P>
   The prison labor initiative, for example, is not new, said Bama
Athreya, director for Asia programs at International Labor Rights
Fund, a Washington-based organization that carries out training
programs in several Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a 1992 U.S.-China agreement to allow visits by American
officials to alleged prison labor, China has routinely refused U.S.
requests. No such visits have been permitted since 1997, despite
constant U.S. pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``This legislation does nothing to further the existing
agreement, which is simply being ignored,'' Athreya said.
</P>
<P>
   Even major corporations have been blocked in attempts to coax
the government to loosen its iron hold.
</P>
<P>
   In the past year, for example, Beijing has given the cold
shoulder to repeated attempts by three of the largest U.S.
manufacturers in China _ Levi Strauss, Phillips-Van Heusen and
Reebok _ to open a diplomatic back channel to Beijing. The three
firms have been under fire from U.S. activist groups and labor
unions for contracting huge amounts of clothes and footwear
production in China despite the communist government's ban on
independent unions and its jailing of union organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The three firms' CEOs pleaded with Chinese officials to ``work
together'' with them to improve labor rights _ but were given a
series of icy rebuffs this spring. The initiative is now ``dead,''
one company executive told The Chronicle this week.
</P>
<P>
   A broad initiative since 1998 by the International Labor
Organization, a U.N. agency, has resulted in a few high-level
meetings but little else.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, Beijing has quietly allowed some Western
nongovernmental organizations to start work on development
projects, often including advanced Western environmental
technology. And a new State Department aid program, started last
year, is giving $250,000 annually to help China relocate laid-off
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights and other political themes, however, are strictly
forbidden.
</P>
<P>
   ``PNTR is a political gamble, and could create more tension with
the Chinese,'' said Jendrzejczyk. ``It all depends on how much the
United States tries to carry out (the rights provisions) and how
much China feels it needs to cooperate.''

 HOUSE OKS CHINA PACT BY WIDER THAN EXPECTED MARGIN  &HT;     By CAROLYN LOCHHEAD 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration and its free-trade
allies won a huge economic and foreign policy victory Wednesday as
the House approved normalizing trade with China, 237 to 197.
</P>
<P>
   The 19-vote margin was more comfortable than either side had
anticipated, dealing a hard blow to unions, who had made defeat of
the China measure their Rubicon.
</P>
<P>
   A solid minority of 73 Democrats joined 164 Republicans in
voting to end a current annual review of China trade, clearing the
way for U.S. participation in a huge trade pact signed by the
administration last December that will open telecommunications and
other key markets in China in return for China's entry to the World
Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   The vote was a huge victory for Silicon Valley high-tech
companies and farmers in the San Joaquin Valley, who insisted that
defeat would have been equivalent to shutting U.S. firms out of
China's vast and fast-growing market, while inviting competitors in
Europe and Japan to fill the void.
</P>
<P>
   The hard-fought China measure marked the first big win in recent
years for the pro-trade bloc, which beat back a loose coalition of
organized labor, environmentalists, human rights activists and
opponents of globalization that helped torpedo WTO talks in Seattle
in December.
</P>
<P>
   For President Clinton, who threw everything in his political
arsenal into the fight, winning permanent normal trade relations
for China capped two terms of narrow and often controversial
free-trade victories, from passage of the North American Free Trade
Agreement with Mexico and Canada in 1993 to approval of a global
trade pact known as the Uruguay Round in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Since those victories, however, Clinton had stumbled on trade
issues, failing to win ``fast track'' negotiating authority for new
trade agreements in 1998. And after the violent protests in
Seattle, it appeared that unions and environmentalists were gaining
a decisive upper hand.
</P>
<P>
   In a Rose Garden statement after the victory, Clinton called the
vote ``a historic step toward continued prosperity in America,
reform in China and peace in the world.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton acknowledged the vote was difficult for many members,
but said it gives China ``a chance _ not a guarantee, but a chance
_ to build a future in the Asia Pacific region for the next 50
years very different from the last 50.''
</P>
<P>
   Emphasizing as he has the past week that the United States
``fought three wars'' in Asia in the past half century, Clinton
said of China, ``We owe it to them, to their children, and to our
children and grandchildren to give the world a chance to build a
better and different future.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and other supporters said that commerce with the outside
world will allow new ideas to seep into Chinese society and empower
reformers and undermine hardliners. Its detractors argued that only
by retaining the annual threat of revoking trade privileges could
can  &LR; the U.S. force China to ease its internal repression.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Pelosi, a San Francisco Democrat who battled
ferociously to defeat the China measure, conceded that the vote
``was disappointing, I'll tell you that.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi said China trade ``challenged the conscience of this
Congress, and Congress responded with a cash register.'' She warned
that the ``burden is now on the members of Congress who voted for
this legislation and the president of the United States to produce
some results.''
</P>
<P>
   Pelosi predicted the U.S. trade deficit with China will continue
to soar and that conditions in China will deteriorate.
</P>
<P>
   ``More people will be arrested,'' she said. `We have given them
carte blanche. We have demonstrated there is nothing they can do,
including threatening Taiwan, and we will not think of revoking
(trade privileges).''
</P>
<P>
   But Sacramento's Rep. Bob Matsui, who led Democratic supporters,
insisted that rejecting China's overtures could make ``China an
enemy of the U.S. for the next 40, 50 years, so we can have another
Cold War.''
</P>
<P>
   Matsui argued it would be folly to spurn China's market and that
workers should not fear China's opening its markets to U.S. goods.
``One of every five people on Earth is Chinese,'' he declared. ``We
are by far the most powerful economy in the world. We are second to
none. We shouldn't fear anyone.''
</P>
<P>
   Emotions ran high as the late-afternoon vote neared, forging
bizarre alliances between the House's most ardent liberals and
conservatives on both sides of the China debate.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Norwood, R-Ga., brought Democrats to their feet with a
rousing denunciation of what he called a ``jobs, bombs and Bibles''
appeasement of China by free traders, who Norwood said argue year
after year that more Chinese commerce will increase U.S. jobs, make
Beijing's communist dictatorship less dangerous and improve
religious freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Accusing proponents of being more concerned with profits than
values, Norwood implored, ``Show that liberty still shines brighter
than gold.''
</P>
<P>
   Gravelly-voiced Harlem liberal Charles Rangel responded that the
United States dare not risk shutting its own industries out of
China's vast market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who can we afford to ignore over a billion people, knowing
that if we do, the Asians and Europeans will not?'' Rangel asked.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to denunciations of China's treatment of its
citizens, Rangel declared that America was ``not without blemishes.
... We have descendants of slaves that sit in this body. ... We
have people living here without education, without hope, without
running water.''
</P>
<P>
   Rangel brought cheers from Republicans, insisting that ``cutting
off communication did not work with that communist, Castro _ he
outlived close to 10 presidents. Don't let it happen in China.''
</P>
<P>
   East Bay Democrat Pete Stark, who managed the debate for
opponents, introduced each speaker with barbed comments on China
trade.
</P>
<P>
   ``Slave labor is not the American way to get T-shirts at
Wal-Mart,'' Stark said. ``The slogan, `We bring good things to
life,' won't help female murdered children in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Silicon Valley had been terrified of a defeat, especially after
House minority leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., announced the he
would oppose the measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were very nervous when Gephardt came out against it,'' said
Jeff Modisett, vice president of TechNet, a lobbying group of 200
high-tech executives. ``I think that caused us to redouble our
efforts and motivated a lot of CEOs to get actively engaged in a
way they haven't been before.''
</P>
<P>
   Unions fought just as hard, threatening to withhold political
support from wavering Democrats in the November elections, when
Democrats hope to recapture the House majority with union backing.
</P>
<P>
   The Chamber of Commerce countered with its own threats to deny
political aid to any member who crossed business on China.
</P>
<P>
   The issue has put Vice President Al Gore, the presumptive
Democratic presidential nominee, in an awkward position where he
has managed to infuriate both sides. Proponents accused Gore of
doing only the most perfunctory lobbying for the measure, while
unions blasted him for speaking out in its favor.
</P>
<P>
   United Auto Workers President Stephen Yokich issued a scathing
letter against Gore, urging union support for third-party candidate
Ralph Nader _ whose attacks on the auto industry have made him the
bane of Detroit _ because Nader ``will take a stand based on what
is right, not what big money dictates.''
</P>
<P>
   Texas Gov. George W. Bush, who has long supported the China
trade measure, issued a statement congratulating the House.
``Passage of this legislation will mean a stronger American
economy,'' Bush said, ``as well as more opportunity for liberty and
freedom in China.''
</P>
<P>
   Business had learned a lesson from its hard-line stands on
previous trade measures, this time embracing a key amendment by
Sander Levin, D-Mich., that would set up a process to monitor human
rights and trade violations.
</P>
<P>
   The Levin amendment, derided by opponents as a ``fig leaf,''
provided political cover for Democrats to support the overall bill.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Maibach, vice president of government relations for Santa
Clara chipmaker Intel, said votes began breaking supporters' way in
the last few days leading up to the vote, noting South Bay
Republican Tom Campbell's switch to the ``yes'' column on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Intel employees sent out 5,000 e-mails, letters and faxes to
members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   High-tech companies lobbying members ``made the case for the
role of technology in opening up China,'' added TechNet's Modisset.
``It's obviously very difficult to have a totalitarian regime when
you can freely receive and transmit over the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   But David Bonior, the Democrat whip who led the charge against
China trade, predicted that ``the grand coalition'' of labor,
environmentalists and others who protested trade and globalization
in Seattle has ``only just begun.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This issue of globalization is not disappearing,'' Bonior
said. ``These issues of human rights and religious rights and labor
rights and the environment _ we will win this.''
</P>
<P>
   The China trade measure next goes to the Senate, where support
is stronger than in the House. The bill has already cleared the
Senate Finance Committee 18 to 1.

 AMERICA'S HIGH-TECH INDUSTRIES CHEER HOUSE VOTE ON TRADE BILL  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Calling it their most important political victory to date,
America's high-tech companies heartily celebrated Wednesday's House
of Representatives vote to give China trade access to the U.S.
market.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech companies see the hotly contested vote as a key
step toward opening China's vast consumer market to billions of
dollars worth of American computers, software, semiconductors and
telecommunications equipment.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. High-Tech Industry Coalition on China, an
ad-hoc group formed to lobby for permanent normal trade relations,
the revenues at stake are already huge, even though technology has
barely scratched the surface in China:
</P>
<P>
   -- The $8 billion annual semiconductor market in China is
expected become the world's third largest by 2001 and the second
largest by 2010. Annual sales of related equipment and materials
should hit $4 billion by 2003.
</P>
<P>
   -- Exports of U.S. computer and office equipment increased 500
percent in the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   -- Internet users are expected to jump from 9 million people
last year to 20 million this year.
</P>
<P>
   -- With 40 million cellular phone subscribers, China is close to
becoming the world's second-largest cellular market.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are one step closer to securing (permanent normal trade
relations) that promise to yield a significant boost to every
sector of the high-tech industry,'' said Jim Whittaker, the
coalition's chairman and director of International Public Policy
for Hewlett-Packard Co. of Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   ``The high-tech industry has been a driving force behind the
booming U.S. economy ... our ability to sustain that growth is
dependent upon fair and open access to world markets, including
China,'' Whittaker said in a news release.
</P>
<P>
   The House vote was yet another demonstration of the growing
political muscle U.S. technology companies have in Washington. And
trade with China has generated far broader support than previous
hot button high-tech topics such as raising limits on foreign
worker visas or limiting liabilities for Year 2000 computer
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have big smiles on our faces,'' said Tim Bennett, senior
vice president for international affairs for the American
Electronics Association, which was part of a broad coalition of
high-tech companies that has been applying a full-court press on
Capitol Hill since January.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a statement for our sector that U.S. industries will be
a player in the Chinese market,'' Bennett said. ``It's also a
broader political statement about the leadership role the U.S. will
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said about 60 percent of the
company's sales come from outside the U.S. But in China, Intel has
to pay tariffs, must sell through a Chinese trading company and has
difficulty investing in Chinese companies.
</P>
<P>
   If approved by the Senate, the trade bill ``gives us access to
the Chinese market on the same terms that the Chinese have had
access to our market,'' Mulloy said. ``We belive that by removing
the barriers, we are stimulating market growth in China. That bodes
well for us and for the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   China represents about 10 percent of Motorola Inc.'s annual
global sales of $30 billion, said Norm Sandler, the Schaumburg,
Ill., company's director of global strategic issues.
</P>
<P>
   Future revenues are hard to predict, but the lure of burgeoning
markets for cell phone, pager and other telecommunication equipment
will draw competition from companies all over the world, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd like to be in there competing on a level playing field,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But firms and farmers who lobbied for normal trade with China
should not be ``under the illusion that now they can pop the
champagne corks and watch the money roll in,'' warned Richard
Margolis, senior economist with Merrill Lynch in Hong Kong.

   ``American companies have to be realistic,'' cautioned Dong Tao,
senior Asia economist at Credit Suisse First Boston. ``Genuine
market access in China will take years _ probably decades.''

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
The people at Ripley's Believe It Or Not are bound to be clearing
out space for an exhibit. If not, ABC surely must be in the
planning stages for a return of the logic-defying series That's
Incredible.
<TEXT>
<P>
   How else can you explain what continues to happen to the Astros,
who mystified even themselves in Wednesday's 9-7 loss to the
Philadelphia Phillies at Enron Field?
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner, who blew only three saves in 42 chances last
season, botched his fourth opportunity in a row and his fifth in
nine tries this season. The Astros led by seven runs after five
innings, marking the second seven-run lead they have surrendered in
a span of four days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazing,'' said Astros first baseman Jeff Bagwell, struggling
to find the right words. ``It's unbelievable. It's not that easy to
lose games the way we're losing them. It's gut-wrenching. But Billy
is my man. I'd want him right back out there tomorrow if we had a
lead.''
</P>
<P>
   After snapping a seven-game losing streak Tuesday, the Astros
reverted to their old ways Wednesday night before a not-so-pleasant
crowd of 32,665. The bullpen has a 6.07 ERA over the last nine
games, and Wagner _ virtually a sure thing throughout his career _
has been one of the biggest culprits.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the team plays hard and scores seven runs, we deserve to
win,'' Wagner said. ``It's not easy to walk into the clubhouse and
look at your teammates when you're the guy who's giving it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a shame that we're playing good baseball and I (stink)
right now. All I can do is keep going out there and trying to
battle through it.''
</P>
<P>
   After a one-day hiatus, the Astros can once again claim the
worst record (16-29) in the National League. The Phillies (16-28)
have the second-worst mark.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been a part of good teams, and this is a good
team, too,'' Astros outfielder Moises Alou said. ``We're just not
playing very well right now. This is new for me, and it's new for a
lot of guys. Sometimes you go through periods like this, but we
know we're better than this.''
</P>
<P>
   Games like Wednesday's make you wonder.
</P>
<P>
   Facing the bottom of the Phillies' lineup and needing three outs
to notch his first save since May 4, Wagner allowed four
ninth-inning runs on five hits, including a two-run homer by former
Astro Bob Abreu, who delivered what would be the decisive blow. It
was Abreu's second homer of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've run out of ideas,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
``When you bring in a guy who throws 97, 98 mph, you don't think
they'll score four runs. You have to give the Phillies credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anyone in the league would like to have Wagner on the
mound in that situation. He's just in a slump right now. The only
alternative we have is to keep bringing him in there.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when an assignment against Phillies ace Curt
Schilling was another way of saying ``better luck next time.'' But
he was easy pickings Wednesday, as the Astros ripped the three-time
All-Star for seven runs on eight hits in 4 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Schilling, who began the season on the disabled list while
recovering from shoulder surgery, has an 8.68 ERA over his past
three starts, proving few pitchers are safe from the offensive
explosion throughout the majors this season.
</P>
<P>
   The Phillies barely touched Astros starter Octavio Dotel over
the first five innings. He retired the first seven batters he faced
and didn't allow a hit until Kevin Jordan led off the fifth with a
single to left. Dotel, who allowed four runs on seven hits in 6
innings, has a 3.26 ERA over his past three starts.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously paying no attention to reputation and credentials, the
Astros jumped on Schilling from the opening bell, stringing
together four hits after he retired Craig Biggio to lead off the
game.
</P>
<P>
   Five of the next six batters reached, including Richard Hidalgo,
who blasted a two-run homer over the fence in left-center field.
Bagwell, Ken Caminiti and Daryle Ward each drove in a run in the
inning. Hidalgo ranks among the league leaders in home runs (14)
and RBIs (39).
</P>
<P>
   Bagwell and Ward, two of Hidalgo's prime competitors for the
club homer lead, piled onto Schilling's misery with a pair of solo
homers in the fifth. Bagwell has 11 homers, and Ward has 10 in just
93 at-bats, the best ratio on the team.
</P>
<P>
   Having fallen behind 7-0, the Phillies finally got something
going in the sixth inning. Doug Glanville reached on a leadoff
infield single and scored on the first hit of Pat Burrell's
big-league career, a single to left. Jordan's sacrifice fly pulled
Philadelphia within five.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker ended Dotel's night in the seventh after the
righthander's 117th pitch sailed over the Crawford Boxes for a
two-run homer courtesy of Glanville. Abreu's first home run of the
night, a solo shot off Astros reliever Doug Henry, trimmed the
Astros' lead to two. Henry has allowed seven home runs, tops in the
Astros' bullpen, in 20 appearances this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing I look back on and think I might have done
differently is have someone start the seventh inning instead of
Dotel,'' Dierker said. ``He had thrown a lot of pitches, and he
came to the end energy-wise.''

PLENTY OF HEROES IN ANGELS VICTORY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The Angels got 18 hits, including five from Mo
Vaughn and a game-winning home run from Troy Glaus in their 6-5,
10-inning victory over the Minnesota Twins Wednesday night before
8,633 at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   But the play that ultimately won it for the Angels came from the
right arm of Edgard Clemente.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels held a 5-3 lead with two out in the bottom of the
ninth inning, but the Twins had the bases loaded with Jay Canizaro
at bat. Canizaro hit a line drive to right field over the head of
Clemente, who played it off the fence.
</P>
<P>
   Two runs scored and it appeared Corey Koskie, running from first
base, also would score to win the game for the Twins.
</P>
<P>
   Clemente, the nephew of Hall of Famer Roberto Clemente, threw
the ball from deep right field on two hops to catcher Bengie
Molina, who tagged out Koskie and send the game into extra innings.
</P>
<P>
   Glaus' leadoff homer in the 10th off Bob Wells gave the Angels a
6-5 lead, and Al Levine pitched the bottom of the inning for his
first career save, but it was Clemente's throw that had the Angels
talking in the clubhouse after the game.
</P>
<P>
   When Angels manager Mike Scioscia was asked who he thought of
when the throw was made, he said:
</P>
<P>
   ``Take your pick. The other (Roberto) Clemente or (Raul)
Mondesi. I can't believe from where he threw that ball and how
accurate it was and how much he threw him out by. I was looking for
the relay man, but there was no need for one. That was on a plumb
line.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn was the cutoff man on the play, but there was no way a
relay would get there in time to nail the runner.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't cut his throws anyway,'' Vaughn said. ``Did you see
that throw he made from center field last week? When it went by me
it was picking up velocity. He has that type of arm.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemente, 24, said once he knew he couldn't catch the ball, he
had to throw it home himself without the help of a cutoff man.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew I just had to throw it to home plate,'' he said. ``I
threw it with everything I've got. That was all that was on my
mind. I didn't see the cutoff anyway. I didn't have time to see
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Clemente started in right field to give Tim Salmon a day in the
designated hitter spot. He never saw his famous uncle play, but
he's been told by others his arm reminds them of Roberto's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people who had a father or family who played, if they
used to hit good or throw good, then they do it too,'' Clemente
said. ``It's good to have that.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides Vaughn's five hits, the Angels got four hits from Molina
and three each from Darin Erstad and Glaus. Glaus saved his best
for last, leading off the 10th with his 15th homer of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's got a natural path through the ball that will result in a
lot of home runs,'' Scioscia said. ``He gets the ball in the air
and drives the ball. This guy's been something.''
</P>
<P>
   Early in the game it seemed the Angels would have to do better
than their six runs. Starter Jarrod Washburn gave up three runs in
the first inning before recording an out. But after a visit to the
mound from Scioscia, Washburn calmed down and went seven innings
without giving up another run.
</P>
<P>
   Washburn was a little too excited about his start because his
parents and other family and friends made the trip from Wisconsin
to see him pitch.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what (Scioscia) told me, I was too excited,'' Washburn
said. ``I was getting the ball up but the problem was more mental.
I just got myself under control and stopped the bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival (2-2) blew a chance to increase his league-leading save
total to 14, but got the win instead. The Twins' two-run ninth
wasn't all his fault, though, as shortstop Benji Gil's throwing
error allowed Midre Cummings to reach base leading off the inning.
Percival struck out two, but also walked two to load the bases for
Canizaro.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team is a mentally tough team,'' Vaughn said. ``The guys
come to battle, and it starts with the manager. Funny things happen
in this game, but we have the type of players to get through it.'' &QL;

BLAZERS WON'T ENGAGE IN WORDPLAY WITH JACKSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ As usual, coach Phil Jackson has set the
agenda for the war of words in the Lakers' playoff series against
the Portland Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, he derisively referred to the Blazers as ``jackals''
for laughing on the bench during their Game 2 rout of the Lakers at
Staples Center.
</P>
<P>
   It didn't take long for the Blazers to take the bait.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any team that gets a win on the road is going to be happy
about it,'' Portland coach Mike Dunleavy said. ``We can't all sit
stoically like he does and not react to things. Our guys were
showing a positive emotion. I don't think it was an
over-celebration on our part in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Rasheed Wallace brushed off the comments as ``tricks and
mudslinging'' and added: ``We don't worry about that, man, because
it's all going to be answered out there on the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   Blazers forward Scottie Pippen, a Jackson disciple, was wise to
his old coach's methods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Phil's not on the court. He's only a piece of the game,'' he
said. ``The players have to go out there and do our job and not
focus on all the distractions.''
</P>
<P>
   That also includes Jackson's assertion that Pippen is playing
illegal zone defense as he roams the floor, helping to guard
Shaquille O'Neal and Kobe Bryant.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to play the way we feel we can defend this team,''
Pippen said. ``We don't think by any means we're illegal, and we're
not going to focus on that.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Dunleavy: ``If they want to make it retroactive, I'd be
willing to call all our illegal defenses against us and call all of
Shaq's against him and let's shoot it off after the game. That's
fine by me.''
</P>
<P>
   FEELING ROSEY: The Lakers have already survived the NBA's
loudest court Sacramento's Arco Arena, where they went 0-2 in the
playoffs and Jackson said he's not concerned with the hostile
environs of Portland's Rose Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never felt the Portland fans are hostile,'' he said.
``I've always felt they're loud, they're vociferous, they're
boisterous, good fans. But I never felt that they've been hostile.
Many times with the Bulls when we played them in '92 (in the
Finals), they were a very gracious crowd and knew that we were a
better team than they were, and at the end of it felt relatively
comfortable congratulating us as we went on home.''
</P>
<P>
   REQUIRED READING: Usually, it's Jackson who hands out books to
players. But Wednesday, it was veteran John Salley who felt the
Lakers needed some inspirational words. So he brought in his copy
of Sun Tzu's ``The Art of War.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Three guys said they read it. I don't know how and when,''
Salley said, ``because it tells you when you're superior, you're
supposed to attack. And if we're going to believe and think we're
superior, we attack. And today in practice, some guys were kind of
pacing themselves. And we don't have time to pace.''
</P>
<P>
   OUCH REPORT: Glen Rice, bothered by tendinitis in his right
knee, practiced Wednesday, and Jackson said he ``seemed to be OK.
Better today. Not OK, but better today, and he seems to be
improving.'' &QL;

TWO WAYS TO LOOK AT DODGERS SUSPENSIONS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hang onto your hat. And keep your shirt on. The
celebration can wait until October.
</P>
<P>
   But did you hear what happened Wednesday?
</P>
<P>
   Baseball handed the Dodgers the pennant.
</P>
<P>
   On paper _ the fax listing 16 players and three coaches
suspended and fined for their roles in the Dodgers' brawl with
Chicago fans last week _ it looks as if Frank Robinson, the
commissioner's vice president for on-field operations (in plainer
terms: judge, jury and executioner), just choked the life out of a
ballclub.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way of handicapping the Dodgers, you might say,''
manager Davey Johnson said a couple of hours after the punishments
were handed down by Robinson.
</P>
<P>
   Or ... you might say exactly the opposite.
</P>
<P>
   You might say this is the development that will make _ not break
_ a championship team.
</P>
<P>
   You might even say this is the greatest thing to happen on
account of a Dodgers cap since a prankster put eye black in Kirk
Gibson's, and Gibson declared that would be the last of the
tomfoolery in 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Why should 60 games worth of player suspensions be a good thing
for the Dodgers? Here's why.
</P>
<P>
   Teams wait all spring and summer _ and fall, if they get that
far _ for rallying points like the one that just came to them
through the fax machine.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes a long, hard, winning road trip brings a team
together. Sometimes it takes a brawl to create that
us-against-the-world feeling.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have had two such road trips already in 2000. In the
midst of the second trip, they had the brawl, which began when a
fan at Wrigley Field hit Chad Kreuter in the head and snatched the
catcher's cap as he sat in the right-field bullpen during the ninth
inning of a May 16 game against the Cubs.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, the Dodgers won six games in a row after
that incident in the Friendly Confines.
</P>
<P>
   Now they have the unusually harsh suspensions to make them feel
picked upon.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, petty injustices lead to revolutions. This one can
lead to the World Series.
</P>
<P>
   If this doesn't kill the Dodgers, it will make them stronger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told players to channel all their frustrations out on that
(Cincinnati Reds) pitcher,'' Dodgers chairman Bob Daly said before
Wednesday night's game at Dodger Stadium. ``I think they feel more
motivation to stay together.''
</P>
<P>
   Because it must feel as if the commissioner's office is trying
to bust them apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have a right to be fighting mad. They knew a few of
them would be punished for going over the line that separates
players and fans. It didn't matter that they were provoked. A
front-page photograph of a player with his fingers around a fan's
throat is not something baseball wishes to encourage.
</P>
<P>
   But suspensions for 19 Dodgers? Even the ones who appeared to
reach into the stands to break up, not inflame, the violence? When,
had they backed off, players would have been ridiculed for failing
to support a teammate? A suspension for the bullpen catcher, for
God's sake?
</P>
<P>
   Baseball seems to be going out of its way to send a message: The
paying customer comes first (except in matters of strikes,
lockouts, ticket prices, World Series starting times ...).
</P>
<P>
   It's an overreaction.
</P>
<P>
   Which is different from saying it's the end of the Dodgers'
pennant hopes, as the house men on talk radio were predicting
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Forget about the three coaches, suspended eight days each.
That's an inconvenience, not a calamity. Then, forget about
starting pitchers Darren Dreifort, Eric Gagne and Chan Ho Park,
suspended three days each. Rearrange the rotation and they needn't
miss a turn.
</P>
<P>
   Now you're talking about 51 games worth of suspensions. Think
about this: If Gary Sheffield's ankle injury had been serious
enough to sideline him for 51 games, would we be saying the season
is over? No.
</P>
<P>
   The Major League Players' Association is challenging the
suspensions, and the Dodgers have requested an appeal. Maybe
they'll be reduced.
</P>
<P>
   If not, look at the bright side.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, as ever a club in search of a personality, have
just acquired one by decree of Major League Baseball. They are the
big, bad Dodgers. A motorcycle gang in doubleknits. Tough guys,
scrappers, public enemies.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly they have the look and sound of winners. Instead of
cursing Frank Robinson, they should doff their caps and say,
``Thanks.'' &QL;

JERMAINE O'NEAL WAITS FOR HIS SHOT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The youngest prodigy to play in the NBA feels old
enough to be John Salley.
</P>
<P>
   Jermaine O'Neal, Portland's reserve forward/center, was 43 days
removed from his 18th birthday when he appeared in his first
regular-season game with the Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, O'Neal and Kobe Bryant were the only two high school
players to make the quantum leap to the NBA. Bryant's trajectory
has been plotted and tracked and gasped at, while O'Neal's has been
harder to trace, his luminous tale obscured by all the other
heavenly bodies in Portland's frontcourt.
</P>
<P>
   Once, 51 days (Bryant, an August baby, is the older of the two
by almost two months) and four places in the 1996 draft were
virtually all that separated the precocious pair. But before the
paths crossed again in the ongoing Western Conference Finals, their
careers would go off in different directions.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks after the 1996 draft, Bryant was traded from Charlotte
to the Lakers and in Hollywood's glare his wondrous talent rose
like yeast dough in a greased bowl.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant, a month older than O'Neal when he made his NBA debut,
became (three months later) the youngest player in league history
to start a regular-season game.
</P>
<P>
   From there, it was a straight shot into the public's
consciousness for Bryant, the youngest player to earn second team
All-Rookie honors, the youngest player to start an All-Star game
and the youngest player to be molded into Michael Jordan's image.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, O'Neal sat on the Trail Blazers' bench growing older
behind Rasheed Wallace and Brian Grant and Arvydas Sabonis, too. In
four seasons, he has started fewer than 20 games while appearing in
over 200.
</P>
<P>
   What O'Neal has learned by watching so much time go by he could
turn into a doctoral dissertation on the space-time continuum.
</P>
<P>
   In his world, it is a state where time doesn't fly, it crawls.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm 35,'' O'Neal, a world-weary 21, said the other
day.
</P>
<P>
   It was 75 minutes until the opening tipoff of Game 2 of the
best-of-seven series between the Lakers and Portland and O'Neal was
slouched in front of the locker next to Scottie Pippen's, mentally
preparing for a game in which he figured to have, at best, a cameo
role.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal is good enough to have dropped 14 points and eight
rebounds on Utah in a Portland win in January. His promise remains
sufficiently seductive that the Trail Blazers signed him to a
four-year, $24 million deal last summer.
</P>
<P>
   He believes in his XXL heart that he has the game to go up just
about anybody except for maybe the Lakers' Shaquille O'Neal (no
relation), who gives everybody fits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm kind of getting edgy about playing more,'' said O'Neal,
who has logged 12 minutes and scored eight points (on 2-for-6
shooting) in two playoff games against the Lakers. ``I got my four
years in, just like if I had gone to college.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody knows I have a lot of talent. But we do have really
good forwards here that I'm playing behind. I'm learning a lot from
them. They keep telling me I just have to keep working hard and be
ready when my time comes.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes O'Neal feels like those baby shrubs sheathed in wiring
so they'll grow into specific shapes. The Trail Blazers are trying
to mold O'Neal into a defensively responsible player and O'Neal's
untamed side just wants to start and put up shots and be free, like
he was at Eau Claire High in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   He sees what his buddy, Bryant, is accomplishing with the Lakers
and the urge to spread his own wings becomes almost as hard to
suppress as a reflex.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously Kobe's role on his team is a lot bigger than my
role,'' O'Neal said, a little wistfully.
</P>
<P>
   In his many quiet moments, a thought occasionally creeps into
O'Neal's head. He wonders if maybe things would have been a little
different if he has attended one year of college before striking
out on his own for the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if I had one year of college, I'd have done better
with the mental part,'' he said. ``You don't really notice how
tough it is on you mentally (playing in the NBA) until you see
everything. Just being away from home and everything was hard, at
first. But I never doubted myself.''
</P>
<P>
   The city of Portland has adopted O'Neal and so, apparently, have
Bryant's parents. When the Trail Blazers played in L.A. during the
regular season, Bryant's family had O'Neal over for dinner. It was
a chance for the two prodigies to compare notes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jermaine hasn't had the opportunity to kind of grow in the
battlefield like I have,'' Bryant said. ``The timing for him is a
little different. But he'll get there. He just has to remain
persistent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a quality ballplayer. I think it's great he's playing
with guys like Scottie, Rasheed Wallace, Brian Grant. He has a
chance to learn some good things.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant is a big believer in the big picture so that's how he
tries to frame things for O'Neal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the only way you're going to stay sane,'' Bryant said.
``Trust me. I know.''
</P>
<P>
   Bryant laughed, ruefully, and at that moment he sound 35, not
21.
</P>
<P>
   The human impulse is to freeze the young in a single snapshot
that never gets yellowed or faded. That's why, for a good many
people, the most jarring thing about Bryant's recent engagement was
that the Lakers' favorite kid brother was all of a sudden grown up
enough to be one of the country's most eligible bachelors.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, too, is maturing in ways we maybe can't see on the court
or in the statistics. But soon enough we'll know. His development
will become big news. &QL;

DODGERS CAP ROUGH DAY WITH LOSS TO REDS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The order came from Dodgers general managing
partner and CEO Bob Daly, who urged his players in a pregame
meeting to take out their frustrations out on their opponents, the
Cincinnati Reds.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later, there was still plenty of frustration to go
around.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored three runs in the first inning, then
collapsed in a 10-3 loss Wednesday night to the Reds in front of
31,740 at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The day had already been ruined when the commissioner's office
announced that 16 Dodger players and three coaches were fined and
suspended for their actions in last week's brawl at Wrigley Field.
</P>
<P>
   Matters only got worse when the Reds scored eight runs over the
final three innings to bust open what once looked to be a pitchers'
duel. Dante Bichette went 5 for 6 with four RBI and Michael Tucker
scored four times.
</P>
<P>
   The Reds bombed the Dodgers bullpen, which wasn't all that much
of a surprise considering all the Dodgers touched turned to rust.
</P>
<P>
   Chan Ho Park pitched four strong innings then fell apart and
former Dodger Juan Castro hit a crucial two-run double after the
Dodgers intentionally walked Hal Morris to load the bases.
</P>
<P>
   And, for the third consecutive game, the Dodgers scored early
and slumbered late.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going OK for a while, and then things kind of went
cold for us,'' manager Davey Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers went up early again, just as they did in Monday's
14-inning 4-3 victory and Tuesday's 3-1 loss. With one out, Mark
Grudzielanek singled and Shawn Green walked.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Karros flew out to left, and the Reds seemed to be out of
the inning when Todd Hollandsworth grounded a ball to the right
side of the infield. Pokey Reese got in position, but the ball
bounced past his glove and Grudzielanek scored from second.
</P>
<P>
   Adrian Beltre followed with a two-run double to give the Dodgers
a 3-0 lead, but there would be little good cheer to follow.
</P>
<P>
   Park (4-4) struggled slightly with his control early, but
allowed just one hit through four innings. He retired the first two
runs in the fifth, then struggled. Tucker singled, Ken Griffey Jr.
walked, and both scored when Bichette doubled into the left-field
corner.
</P>
<P>
   Park walked the first two batters in the sixth and got out of a
jam with a double play, but was pulled after Reese led off the
seventh with a home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought Chan Ho was great through four innings, but in the
fifth he got a little defensive and the sixth was the same way,''
Johnson said. ``He said he felt fine going back out in the sixth,
but he was a little tentative.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough one to let get away.''
</P>
<P>
   The game did get away from the Dodgers after Park's departure.
Matt Herges relieved but didn't fare much better. He walked the
first batter he faced, hit the second and gave up three more runs
in the seventh.
</P>
<P>
   The big hit came courtesy of Castro, a former little-used
infielder with the Dodgers. With the bases loaded and two outs, he
lined a double to right-center field and scored Griffey Jr. and
Bichette to put the Reds up 6-3.
</P>
<P>
   Trever Miller made his Dodger debut to start the eighth inning
but could get just one out. The Reds hit Miller hard and added two
more runs in the eighth.
</P>
<P>
   That was more than enough on a night when the Dodgers' offense
fell silent after the first inning. Starter Steve Parris pitched
five solid innings and retired 12 of the 14 batters he faced after
the first inning. Scott Sullivan (1-2) allowed two hits in three
innings of relief. &QL;

KOBE LEARNING HIS LESSONS WELL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EL SEGUNDO, Calif. _ There are no mistakes in Kobe Bryant's
world, only lessons. Each misstep just leads to a new mission.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-point airballs he shot as a rookie against Utah in the
Western Conference finals? Shrugged off.
</P>
<P>
   The missed free throws that could have won a crucial Game 2 of
the semifinals at San Antonio in 1999? Bryant smiled as he walked
off the court.
</P>
<P>
   Others pout. Bryant accepts the failure, learns and atones.
</P>
<P>
   And so months after that playoff loss at Utah, he hit the
winning free throws in another game at Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   And a few weeks ago, one year after missing those foul shots in
San Antonio, Bryant made the game-winning jumper in Game 2 of the
semis against Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   There isn't a single failure to point to in the current Western
Conference finals, no demons to exorcise. But there are certainly
lessons to be learned as Bryant and the Lakers head to Portland,
tied 1-1 with the Trail Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Bryant has been held to 13 and 12 points, respectively, in Games
1 and 2 _ his lowest-scoring consecutive games of the season, and
well below the 24.4 points he averaged in the first two rounds of
the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Blazers, determined to shut down both Bryant and Shaquille
O'Neal, are sending waves of defenders at both. And it's working.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's just another lesson for the 21-year-old All-Star. And a
difficult one.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's trying to adjust, but it's hard,'' said teammate
Derek Fisher. ``I think this is the first time where a team has
consistently, when he touches the ball, (sent a double-team). And
now he's Shaquille _ every time he touches the ball, here comes
Scottie (Pippen). Or here comes Rasheed (Wallace). Or here comes
someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``And I think for Kobe, it's definitely a big-time adjustment.
Because he's used to having the ability to be able to create off
the dribble and do different things. And they've kind of taken that
away. So it's a process for him, as well as our team, in terms of
getting better and learning more how to be great, regardless of
what the situation is.''
</P>
<P>
   To his credit, Bryant hasn't reverted to bad old habits.
</P>
<P>
   He isn't forcing plays _ he's committed just three turnovers in
two games. And he isn't forcing shots _ to the contrary, he's taken
nine attempts in each game after averaging 19.7 in the first two
rounds of the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, Bryant's own newfound patience is working
against him.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys are actually asking me to shoot the ball?'' Bryant
said with a laugh, after a reporter suggested he should take more
than nine shots per game.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just haven't really been as aggressive, as far as going to
the hoop. I've kind of been settling, instead of keeping guys on
the perimeter and when they double, just kicking it out for open
shots instead of trying to break them down. ... I just have to go
through about two or three guys.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bryant shied away from the notion that this was a personal
challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a huge challenge from a lot of areas _ losing
home-court advantage, the momentum of the series shifting. Scottie.
Bonzi (Wells). Steve Smith. And their whole team defense collapsing
on guys,'' he said. ``I think it's a challenge, because you kind of
have to beat five guys. You don't have to beat one.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost literally, in Bryant's case.
</P>
<P>
   He's been defended by almost every player on the Blazers'
roster. And at the other end of the floor, he's had to guard an
endless string of them, adjusting from the quickness of tiny Damon
Stoudamire to the big hops of Wells to the physical post play and
shooting range of Smith.
</P>
<P>
   All of it was made more difficult by Bryant's early foul trouble
in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just tough from a fouls standpoint, because Shaq was
obviously in foul trouble. I didn't want to pick up my fourth and
get in foul trouble as well, and ... lose all of our offensive
firepower,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, that happened in Game 2 anyway. Bryant, prevented
from driving, tried the jumper and went 2 for 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just think he's not shooting well,'' coach Phil Jackson
said. ``I just think that's a slump that he's in right now,
shooting-wise, that dates back maybe a couple weeks. But once he
gets back and shoots the ball well, he'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the extra bodies blanketing Bryant, Jackson said: ``It's
not a problem. He just has to go ahead, play his game and take his
shots where he gets them.''
</P>
<P>
   So the lesson unfolds, and the reassuring part for the Lakers
is, Bryant is a quick learner.
</P>
<P>
   As veteran teammate John Salley said, ``He'll get it.'' &QL;

SANTANGELO ISN'T COMPLAINING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ F.P. Santangelo might be stuck in a center-field
platoon with Todd Hollandsworth for the next few weeks, but the
sixth-year veteran isn't about to bemoan his status with the
Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to be playing feels good and to get the opportunity to
contribute,'' Santangelo said. ``Any time you know what your role
is, no matter what it is, it makes things easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo started in center and hit leadoff Wednesday night
against Cincinnati. Santangelo would normally sit in favor of
Hollandsworth against a right-handed pitcher such as Steve Parris,
but Gary Sheffield's sprained ankle forced both players into
action.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo, signed as a free agent in January, entered the game
hitting just .111 but said he feels more comfortable with regular
at-bats.
</P>
<P>
   Regular center fielder Devon White has been sidelined since May
5 with a partial tear of his rotator cuff, allowing Santangelo more
time at the plate. White will not be back for at least a month.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're not playing all the time, it's harder to feel
comfortable out there,'' Santangelo said. ``I'm just trying to see
a lot of pitches, so that when (White) comes back or when
Hollandsworth is playing, I can still go strong.''
</P>
<P>
   DODGER SHUFFLE: On an already chaotic day, Johnson shuffled his
starting lineup slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Santangelo started in left field, in place of Geronimo Berroa,
who went 0 for 4 Tuesday night. Chad Kreuter started in favor of
Todd Hundley and batted seventh, and Hollandsworth moved from his
traditional leadoff spot in the batter order to No.5.
</P>
<P>
   DAY OF REST: The Dodgers have an off day today and open a
three-game series with the Philadelphia Phillies at 7:10 p.m.
Friday. Kevin Brown (3-1, 2.41 ERA) will face the Phillies' Paul
Byrd (1-3, 7.75 ERA) in the series opener. &QL;

VAUGHN WARMING UP
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Mo Vaughn is on a roll, but he likes to think of
it as simply doing what he is supposed to do.
</P>
<P>
   After playing all of last season on a badly sprained left ankle
and starting this season slowly, Vaughn now is hitting the way the
Angels hoped he would when he signed a six-year, $80 million
contract before the 1999 season.
</P>
<P>
   He went 5 for 5 Wednesday and now has hit in 11 consecutive
games and 13 of his past 14. During those 14 games, Vaughn is
hitting .448 (26 for 58) with nine homers and 21 RBI. He's hitting
.335 on the season, and with 16 homers and 45 RBI _ on pace to set
Angels records in homers (56) and RBI (158).
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't get too excited about different stats because I've
done that before,'' Vaughn said. ``My big thing is waking up every
day strong and healthy and able to play the way I want to play.
That's what I'm most excited about.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn also said it helps to have a good approach at the plate _
``Hopefully I'll keep swinging at strikes'' _ and bat with runners
on base.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not so much who's hitting behind you, but who's in front
of you,'' he said. ``Adam (Kennedy) and Darin (Erstad) are getting
on base. I can do a lot more damage. They can't pitch around me
with guys on base. That's the biggest thing.''
</P>
<P>
   FILL-IN: Ex-USC standout Seth Etherton will make his
major-league debut Friday for the Angels against the Royals in
Kansas City. The Angels need a starting pitcher for the spot
because of numerous injuries and illness to the pitching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton, 2-2 with a 4.43 ERA in seven starts for Triple-A
Edmonton this season, was selected ahead of a number of other
candidates, including Brett Hinchliffe and Mike Fyhrie, who are
currently pitching for the Angels out of the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Mike Scioscia and pitching coach Bud Black had to
determine whether it was too soon to put Etherton, 23, on a
big-league mound considering this is only his second full season in
professional baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these guys are poised beyond their years,'' Scioscia
said. ``Their youth isn't something that we're going to be
tentative about. Some guys get opportunities out of necessity, but
if we don't think they're ready, we don't want to bring them up in
a situation they're not ready for.''
</P>
<P>
   NOTHING'S CHANGED: It was 8 months ago here at the Metrodome
when interim manager Joe Maddon kept Vaughn, Jim Edmonds, Tim
Salmon and several other starters on the bench in the ninth inning
of Twins pitcher Eric Milton's no-hitter.
</P>
<P>
   But Maddon, back in his seat as the club's bench coach, said he
would do it again, allowing Trent Durrington, Andy Sheets and Jeff
DaVanon to hit in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, the game means a lot to Eric Milton and nothing to
everybody else,'' Maddon said. ``I pre-plan when I do things and I
liked the way things were going. I wanted to give the young guys an
opportunity to play under the duress of trying to break up a
no-hitter. If DaVanon breaks it up, it's going to impact him more
in the long run.''
</P>
<P>
   DANGER ZONES: The dugouts were danger zones at the Metrodome
Wednesday. Twins pitcher Joe Mays got hit on the wrist by a foul
ball and had to go to the hospital. Angels pitching coach Bud Black
got hit on the neck but was OK. &QL;

<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ One day after being released from the hospital,
Angels pitcher Kent Mercker was in good spirits Wednesday as he
talked about the cerebral hemorrhage he suffered May 11.
</P>
<P>
   ``I defied death,'' Mercker said during a conference call with
reporters. ``It's scary to say, but that's what happened. I'm
living to tell about it.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news is what happened to Mercker on the Edison Field
mound that night against the Texas Rangers has been determined to
be an isolated incident. There was no aneurysm and there is no
malformation of blood vessels in the brain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had every test _ which actually did prove I have a brain, by
the way _ and it showed no structural problems and nothing that
would indicate it would happen again. (Doctors) described it as the
odds of being struck by lightning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a blood vessel that burst in the brain and it
disintegrated. It's gone. So it's not like there's a weakened
vessel that can rupture again.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker said doctors told him there are no long-term effects of
the hemorrhage, and the only short-term effects are reactions to
the medication he is taking. He had been on a steroid that reduces
swelling in the brain and is taking a medication that prevents
spasms from occurring.
</P>
<P>
   He'll be on the anti-spasm medication for another eight days and
has been told to take it easy. The medication has made him
extremely weak and fatigued, but once he's off it, he hopes to
begin to slowly regain his strength and stamina.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he says he has ``no idea'' when or if he'll be able to
pitch again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball is very important to me and I believe I will play
baseball again,'' he said. ``But if I'm not allowed to have it
anymore, it's not the end of the world. I have a wife and two
daughters. I hope to live 60 more years.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercker will see doctors today at USC Medical Center, then fly
home with his wife Julie to Dublin, Ohio, tonight. If he's feeling
up to it, Mercker plans to drive to Cleveland to visit his Angels
teammates Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call me unlucky to have (the hemorrhage), but I'm very
fortunate,'' Mercker said. ``The percentage of people who have
this, only a minute percentage don't have an aneurysm or long-term
effects or surgery. It's amazing. ... It's not like we're talking
about a torn ligament in your elbow. I'm bleeding.''
</P>
<P>
   The bleeding in his brain stopped that night, but Mercker knows
he was in danger of losing his life.
</P>
<P>
   After Mercker threw a pitch to strike out Ruben Mateo in the
second inning, ``It felt like my head filled up,'' he said. ``Like
when you're taking off in an airplane. Both my ears popped and I
felt pressure. I could hear, but it was muffled.''
</P>
<P>
   Four pitches later, with Royce Clayton at the plate, Mercker
fell to his knees in pain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt pain in the back of my neck to my forehead,'' Mercker
said. ``That's when I realized it wasn't normal.''
</P>
<P>
   Once at the hospital, Mercker was told by Angels physician Dr.
Lewis Yocum that his condition was serious.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said, `I'm going to cut to the chase, you've got a
problem,''' Mercker said. ``My whole life, I've never had a medical
problem. To hear I have internal bleeding, especially in my brain,
was tough to hear.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Mercker admits, the experience of the past two weeks has
been beneficial in that it has helped him put his life in
perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``You prioritize a little bit,'' he said. ``I remember in spring
training talking about whether I was going to be in the rotation or
the bullpen. Who cares? Now I look back and I can't even imagine
arguing about being in the bullpen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've had a good career. I've won a World Series, I saw Mark
McGwire hit 70 home runs, I threw a no-hitter. But the one thing
I'll take away from the game is the friends that I've met over the
years. ... Every (Angels) player came to see me in the hospital.
(Troy) Percival brought me lunch every day, him and Darin Erstad.
That's what makes this game great.'' &QL;

DODGERS HIT HARD BY BASEBALL
</HEADLINE>

By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Major League Baseball fined and suspended 16
Dodgers players and three coaches Wednesday for their actions in a
bizarre brawl with fans last week at Chicago's Wrigley Field, a
decision that stunned and angered players and team management.
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions, which were immediately appealed, range from
three to eight games and the fines from $3,000 to $5,000. The
punishment involves four regular starting position players and
totals 84 games and $72,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am totally in shock,'' said Bob Daly, the Dodgers' general
managing partner and CEO, as his team prepared to face the
Cincinnati Reds at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Backup catcher Chad Kreuter was the only player to receive the
maximum penalties of eight games and a $5,000 fine. The incident,
which took place May 16, began when Kreuter went into the stands
after a fan allegedly struck him. Coaches Rick Dempsey, Glenn
Hoffman and John Shelby also received the stiffest penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Others punished included left fielder Gary Sheffield, pitcher
Carlos Perez and outfielder F.P. Santangelo (five games, $5,000),
and pitcher Mike Fetters (four games, $4,000). Dealt three-game
suspensions and $3,000 fines were right fielder Shawn Green;
catcher Todd Hundley; first baseman Eric Karros; pitchers Terry
Adams, Darren Dreifort, Eric Gagne, Alan Mills, Antonio Osuna and
Chan Ho Park; and outfielder Geronimo Berroa.
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Onan Masaoka, sent to the minor leagues Monday, also
received the smallest punishment, and bullpen catcher Travis
Barbary, not an official member of the coaching staff, received
five games and a $5,000 fine, which the team will pay.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner's office told The Associated Press that the 19
suspensions were the most ever in baseball from one incident.
</P>
<P>
   Dodgers officials unanimously condemned the decision _ manager
Davey Johnson called it ``a way of handicapping the Dodgers'' _ and
expressed confidence that the massive number of suspensions would
be reduced through appeal.
</P>
<P>
   The team insisted that the majority of the players and coaches
acted as peacekeepers or out of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   In the ninth inning of the game in Chicago, a fan allegedly
reached over the wall next to the Dodgers bullpen, struck Kreuter
in the head and took his cap. Kreuter charged into the stands after
the fan, and other Dodgers followed. The game continued after a
10-minute delay.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question,'' Johnson said when asked about the
innocence of many Dodgers. ``My whole coaching staff was trying to
pull people out of there. Todd Hundley, he loves Chicago, and he
was trying to keep people from attacking other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Frank Robinson, baseball's vice president of on-field operations
and a former teammate of Johnson's with the Baltimore Orioles,
handed down the punishment and is expected to be in Los Angeles
later this week or early next week.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Beeston, who serves as CEO of Major League Baseball, will
handle the appeals. The players association will represent the
players, and the Dodgers will assist the coaches in the appeals.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am surprised at the severity of (the punishment),'' Dodgers
general manager Kevin Malone said. ``I'm not sure how (Robinson)
came to this decision, or who influenced him, but I have a lot of
confidence in Paul and his ability to make judgments. I think he
will make some adjustments.''
</P>
<P>
   Malone and other team officials were perhaps most upset that
Robinson decided the specific games that each player would miss.
The suspensions were scheduled to begin Wednesday, and Johnson said
he would have been without ``a couple starters'' without the
appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's way out of line,'' Johnson said. ``(Robinson is)
dictating who my players can play against and who they can't. He's
managing my ballclub for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anybody who has ever managed, and Frank has managed in the big
leagues, knows what it means to have even one player out of the
lineup,'' Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   A team spokesman said the players decided in a team meeting
prior to the game not to speak with the media regarding the
suspensions, even though they had been instructed to remain silent
only about the specifics of the incident, since civil litigation is
still possible.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson and Malone confirmed, however, that the players were
upset, surprised and confused, and they weren't alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we found out this morning, I couldn't believe it,'' Daly
said. ``I looked at the video, and I was shocked (at the severity
of the punishment). I thought there would be a couple suspensions
and some fines, but it's easier for me to tell you the people who
weren't suspended.''
</P>
<P>
   Daly expressed concern about the distraction the punishment
would cause to his team, which is battling the Arizona Diamondbacks
for first place in the National League West, and suggested that
baseball officials were making an example out of the Dodgers and
setting a bad precedent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the message is clear ... Players shouldn't be in the
stands,'' Daly said. ``That's OK (with me), but does that allow
fans to decide a pennant race?''
</P>
<P>
   Dempsey has been through this before. He received a 17-game
suspension last year for an on-field incident with the Seattle
Mariners, but defended his actions in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came face to face with some guys who'd had a lot to drink
and wanted to fight,'' Dempsey said, ``and I didn't accommodate
them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel this punishment is way, way too harsh, and it just
doesn't balance out,'' he said. &QL;

(Eds: Embargoed until May 28.) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jon Downing started using computers when he was about 11, typing
up homework and reports, playing solitaire in his Ventura home. But
it wasn't until he joined the Army and trained on massive tank
simulators at Fort Knox that he really got into gaming on computer
networks with and against his buddies in the barracks.
</P>
<P>
   Now 22, Downing and his brother, Will, spend up to 35 hours a
week taking on opponents from just about anywhere there's an
Internet connection, in online versions of computer games such as
StarCraft and Unreal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can jump on and play people all over the world,'' Downing
said. ``There's millions of people out there playing (online), and
nobody knows about this. I think it's so great.''
</P>
<P>
   Millions indeed. The Interactive Digital Software Association
estimates Americans spent $500 million last year just on online
electronic gaming.
</P>
<P>
   And the numbers are only going to increase, says IDSA president
Doug Lowenstein, because of two factors: the Internet and
next-generation videogame consoles that can connect players to the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see online continuing to grow and companies continuing to
gradually figure out how to make the online-games sector a
consistently profitable business,'' Lowenstein said. ``The key, in
my mind, is broadband. The sooner we get to a broadband world, the
more likely the game industry will be at the center of that.''
</P>
<P>
   As more people get connected to superfast cable and DSL phone
connections to the Internet, Lowenstein said, the nature of
electronic games will change dramatically. Faster connections mean
better sound, faster reaction times, more compelling visuals and
the possibility of new kinds of immersive entertainment. It's all
part of a curious sort of reverse revolution that will send us back
to where we started.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think games have come full circle,'' said Gary Carlin of
Hasbro Interactive's soon-to-launch online gaming site, Games.com.
``There were board games where you played each other, then next was
CD-ROM games that mirrored how a human would play. Now that we have
online games, we're going back to the human opponent.'' For
thousands of years, games were at the center of man's social life.
People played each other, and other people watched them play, and
talked and partied together as they did.
</P>
<P>
   Then came Pong, and all the videogaming consoles of the past 25
years. Instead of man against man, with others enjoying the
competition as spectacle, videogaming machines really only allowed
man (or more likely, teen) against box.
</P>
<P>
   The box's hegemony first cracked with the rise of high-end,
Windows- based PCs, tweaked to cutting-edge performance. Such
!ital!uber- machines were favorites of a relatively small band of
hard-core gaming fanatics who jumped on titles such as Doom and
Quake that let them blast each other over computer networks,
typically in offices, college dorms or Downing's barracks.
</P>
<P>
   As the Internet became more broadly available, so, too, did PC
games with Internet capabilities. Those Net-savvy titles have
proven enduringly attractive, even spawning ``clans'' of players
who take on other groups online.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hard-core gamer in a club, his three best friends may be in
Finland, in Texas and in Brazil, and he's in San Francisco, and
they've never met face to face,'' said Frank Rogan, a producer with
the online service GameSpy.com.
</P>
<P>
   Two recent best-selling sequels _ Quake III Arena and Unreal
Tournament _ explicitly ditched their single-player roots to be
played mostly over networks.
</P>
<P>
   Online gamers typically rely on matchmaking and game-hosting
services such as GameSpy and Mplayer.com, which make it easy to
find and play opponents.
</P>
<P>
   GameSpy's Rogan says 5 million people now use its services
regularly. It is branching out in June with GameSpy Arcade, which
targets so-called ``casual'' gamers, who tend to prefer the pace of
backgammon or bridge online to the mayhem of a first-person
shooter.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we're looking for is people who don't want to play
`Quake' every day, but want to play a strategy game or a
role-playing game or a card game,'' Rogan said. ``As the computer
becomes a standard part of the equipment in the house, people are
going to seek out these sorts of entertainment.''
</P>
<P>
   Hasbro's soon-to-launch Games.com also offers regular-guy games
such as bridge, Stratego and Battleship among 50 or so planned
titles, along with chat areas and a one-to-one capability similar
to AOL's Instant Message capabilities, said Carlin.
</P>
<P>
   The Groove Alliance, a Toluca Lake company, has a smash hit
online with Real Pool, its remarkable 3-D pool game, available at
Shockwave.com. More than 2 million people a month play the game,
said CEO Chris Kantrowitz.
</P>
<P>
   The company has recently released two other online games, Sky
Racer and TankWars, and plans to add multiplayer versions of all
three as soon as partners Intel and Macromedia are set up, probably
by late June, to run the games.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think multiplayer is the killer (application),''
Kantrowitz said. ``Multiplayer is the thing. What is AOL? It is a
big chat company. Most of the traffic going through AOL is just
people talking to each other. Now that people are comfortable with
virtual conversation, how about virtual competition? That's the
next step, I think.''
</P>
<P>
   Online games can create a wide variety of social interactions,
such as with Rainbow Six and its sequel, Rogue Spear, which require
players to figure out a smart team strategy in a commando
operation, then carry it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``In Rainbow Six, people really love the cooperative aspect,''
said Carl Schnurr, the games' producer and designer. ``It's an
important distinction. In Quake, the social aspect may just be
trash-talking to an opponent. In Rainbow Six, there's a very
complex social interaction. Every player has a role, they've often
worked with each other for a long time, they know what to expect
from each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the most remarkable online experiences have been among
so- called massively multiplayer games, such as Origin's Ultima
Online, Sony's Everquest and Microsoft's Asheron's Call.
</P>
<P>
   All three are role-playing games set in huge fantasy worlds,
where a player chooses a character with certain abilities and
slowly builds up belongings and wealth through a series of
adventures. Each has its own distinctive subcultures, such as
Ultima's ``player killers'' and Asheron's Call's sophisticated
player guilds.
</P>
<P>
   Everquest is so addictive that it's been nicknamed
``Evercrack,'' with 300,000 subscribers paying $10 a month to play,
said Clint Worley, a game producer with Verant Interactive, which
developed and runs Everquest for Sony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We call it the marriage killer,'' said Worley. ``That social
aspect is what makes the game work. The community that we build up,
it's almost like a chat room.''
</P>
<P>
   As many as 60,000 people will play Everquest at one time, with
and against each other in a series of quests. People may spenpYz

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: A fork on the road
 &HT;    (For release Sunday, May 28.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ I am sitting in a Paris restaurant watching American
tourists (and myself) fumbling with how to hold a knife and fork
while eating. We don't do it the same way as Europeans but we make
fools of ourselves trying.
</P>
<P>
   There's a brief poem that I have long attributed to the late
Ogden Nash but perhaps he didn't write it. In its totality, more or
less, it's this:
</P>
<P>
   ``Use a spoon when eating peas,
</P>
<P>
   If you use a fork,
</P>
<P>
   they will fall on your knees.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's how it is with us Americans trying to eat European
style. We see them balancing all types of food on the curved backs
of their forks (in their left hands, no less!), and we try it, only
to have the food flop back onto the plate, or worse, into our laps.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, according to stereotypical American movies,
we always could separate the Nazi infiltrators from the Americans
simply by asking them Joe DiMaggio's batting average; which they
could not provide, so, BLAM!, one dead Nazi. But I'm sure the Nazis
could discover our infiltrators just by inviting them to dinner;
``Ah, zoh, you move der fork beck to your right hand, mein Herr,
auf Wiedersehen.'' BLAM!
</P>
<P>
   I have given Euroeating a good try, but where I fail is when I
try to emulate that dining habit by using my knife and fork to
assemble multiple foods onto a single forkful (upside down no
less!).
</P>
<P>
   It absolutely bewilders me to see Europeans diddling with their
food, cutting this piece into tiny pieces, adding them to something
else already balancing on the fork, pushing it up against another
type of food _ all with the object of getting the entire load into
the mouth without any foul-up.
</P>
<P>
   This reminds me of my childhood _ and, likely, yours. When we
were kids and we scrambled the food around the plate as do
Europeans in preparation for a swallow, our mothers would slap the
backs of our hands, chastising us: ``Don't play with your food!''
</P>
<P>
   My grandmother's active chastening verb was ``potchkeh,''
defined by the late Yiddish lexicographer Leo Rosten as ``messing
around inefficiently and inexpertly.''
</P>
<P>
   That's what the Europeans do with their food. They play with it;
potchkeh with it. We Americans, however, we just go about our
business and gobble it up, a chunk of meat now, a forkful of mashed
potatoes next, maybe a spear of asparagus on yet another effort.
</P>
<P>
   But not snippets of all at once!
</P>
<P>
   We try too hard to be like others but we cannot. It's the same
thing in Japanese, Chinese and Thai restaurants back in the States.
Usually, there is that foreboding set of chopsticks that indicates
what should be our primary effort.
</P>
<P>
   So we who have grown up with a spearing fork fumble with rounded
sticks and hope to keep the food balanced between the two. I don't
know about you, but I'm so tense when I try it, I get cramps at the
base of my thumb. Mercifully, forks and spoons are provided for
backup.
</P>
<P>
   Our Asian friends make no pretense of accumulating multiple
morsels of food as do the Europeans. A couple of grains of rice
will do for one mouthful; the bok choy comes up with the next load,
then the shrimp _ and so on.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I admire the Europeans for their ability to hold forks
upside down in the wrong hand and still manage to get food to their
mouths without accidents. Lately, I have noticed that my wife has
taken to handling her silverware and food in that deliberate,
seemingly stylish manner.
</P>
<P>
   You might say that while I eat, she dines.
</P>
<P>
   I have given up trying and forever will be easily identifiable
as an American. Even if I had mastered the upside-down fork trick,
I still would have been exposed for who I am when I had the
audacity to ask for my coffee to be served (italic)with(enditalic)
my dessert. Mon Dieu!

 &HT;    TRAVEL: A breezy way to explore big cities
 &HT;    (With photo.)
 &HT;    By Howard Kleinberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As the bright green and yellow double-decker bus rounded
the circle at the Trocadero, the impressive full view of the Eiffel
Tower hit us flush in the face. It loomed immediately across the
Seine, its many lights emblazoning ``2000'' across its second
platform.
</P>
<P>
   In minutes, the bus _ having crossed the river _ pulled directly
in front of the massive structure. It was time to exercise an
option: either remain on the open-air upper deck of the bus and
move on to another site, or get off, visit the tower then pick up
another green and yellow bus later at the same corner, and continue
on with the guided tour of Paris.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris, it is called L'OpenTour; in Vienna, it's the Hop-On
Hop-Off; in London, it's The Big Bus. What they all are are
inexpensive, accommodating ways to tour cities on your own time, at
your own pace. You'll find similar tours in U.S. cities such as
Boston and New York, the Canadian cities of Toronto and Ottawa, in
the upcoming Olympic city of Sydney, Australia. Likely, there are
dozens more. Two years ago, we saw Dublin that way. Before then, it
was Glasgow.
</P>
<P>
   Tourists have diverse options when they arrive in a major city.
They can view the sights on foot, an exhausting practice. They can
hire a private car, an extravagant endeavor. They can go in one of
those pre-packaged tours; five minutes here, two there, quick,
everyone back on the bus!
</P>
<P>
   Or they can take the Hop-On Hop-Off system, which is kind to the
feet, gentle to the pocketbook and uninhibited by the tick of a
clock.
</P>
<P>
   It works this way: In cities with the service, identifiable
signs are posted at bus stops, notably near major attractions. You
climb aboard, pay the driver for the ticket (more about that later)
and take a seat. Aboard you will find a brochure and map explaining
the various stops, and the frequency of the buses. On the 21-stop
tour we took in Paris, the buses arrived every 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   You could get off wherever you wanted (at a designated stop, of
course), visit an attraction, eat lunch, do shopping, take a nap on
a park bench _ whatever you want. Then show up at any designated
stop, flash your ticket, climb aboard and continue on.
</P>
<P>
   On the tours, explanations of the sights are given in several
languages _ including English _ either through earphones or from
the microphone of an on-board guide.
</P>
<P>
   In some cities, such as Paris, the tickets are good for two full
days. What you didn't stop and see today, you could do tomorrow.
The cost was 150 francs apiece for the two days, or approximately
$22. Considering the cost of individual cabs to a full city tour,
or that of a private car (about $600 a day), the price of Hop-On
Hop-Off is quite good. Certainly, the city can be explored by
subway or city bus at a lower price, but it's just not the same _
no guide, no great view from above, but blocks-long underground
treks to make connections and, of course, the jammed rush hours.
</P>
<P>
   During our two days of the Paris L'OpenTour, we circled the
principal sites twice, got off at the Musee D'orsay for a lengthy
visit, again at the Arc DeTriomphe, at the massive Le Printemps
department store, at the area just below the Montmartre (from where
we took the funiculaire, a tram-like cable car, to the top). Had we
not been to Paris multiple times before, we likely would have
disembarked more often.
</P>
<P>
   A second Paris company, Les Cars Rouges, operates similarly with
red double-decker buses but has fewer stops.
</P>
<P>
   Several days earlier, we took advantage of a corresponding
system in Vienna. This time, the bus was single-level, enclosed and
air-conditioned. Also good for two days, the Vienna Line Hop-On
Hop-Off cost 250 schillings each, or about $17.

   Unlike the audiotaped Paris tour, this had a human guide who
spoke in German, English and Italian. This made it easy to ask
questions _ and get answers. On the two days of this tour, we made
far more stops as we had never before been to Vienna. Always, the
bus was within a few minutes of the promised arrival time at each
easily recognized stop. The brochure included approximate arrival
times for each of the 15 stops on the Vienna tour.
</P>
<P>
   The far-ranging Vienna tour took us from the park with the giant
ferris wheel of ``The Third Man'' movie fame, down to the
Schonbrunn Palace to the absolutely intriguing Hundertwasserhaus
museum alongside the Danube Canal.

   Inasmuch as no two city tour systems seem to have the same name,
check with your hotel clerk or concierge for information; they
likely will have brochures.

   If your time is short, if you are part of the
If-It's-Tuesday-It-Must-Be-Belgium derangement, and if your
pocketbook is already deeply dented by the cost of eating in
European restaurants and staying at European hotels, then Hop-On
Hop-Off is a moving oasis of information, transportation and
economic moderation.

<TEXT>
<P>
   News item: The National Rifle Association has announced that it
will open a family-oriented multimedia center on Times Square in
New York City, the ``NRA Sports Blast.'' It will feature a virtual
shooting gallery, a store for shooting accessories such as
ammunition belts and a restaurant offering wild game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Good evening, folks. My name is LaPierre. I'll be your hunter
and gatherer this evening. Have you dined at Chez NRA before?
</P>
<P>
   ``No? Well, first let me welcome you. I see you've already been
to our store. May I say, madam, that that Gucci ammo belt is just
stunning on you. I don't think enough shooters pay all the
attention they should to accessorizing.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the lad here, I see, has his Eddie Eagle cap. Learning how
to blast away already, are you, son? That's terrific. Here at the
center, we always say, 'The family that blasts together lasts
together.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, before we talk about the menu, let me recommend that
after dinner you visit our virtual shooting gallery. There are
games there for every member of the family.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boy might enjoy 'Columbine 2.' In that one, all the kids
in the cafeteria and library are armed and get to shoot Klebold and
Harris before they can shoot them. It's real fun watching them get
theirs, I can tell you. And watch out for those virtual ricochets,
son!
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom and Dad, you'd get a kick out of 'Spouse Hunt.' We have
his and hers versions. The game is built around a household
argument and I don't want to give away the ending but this one
argument each one of you gets to win, and how.
</P>
<P>
   ``And there are several different versions of 'Postal' for,
well, just all sorts of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The arcade's a hoot. And you know what we always say: `The
family that shoots together hoots together.'
</P>
<P>
   ``What's that, sir? 'Gangbanger'? No, that game's shut down
temporarily for reprogramming so we can add some token white
criminals. The NAACP. You know what they're like.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, how about dinner? In addition to our menu items _ the
bear, duck, boar and so on _ the chef has prepared a special this
evening. It's Venison Bambi, a tender roast of young fawn. I can
highly recommend it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Young man, if you're like most of the kids who come in here,
you'll love our Bunny Burger. And Mom and Dad, let me assure you
that all the burgers have been carefully checked to make sure no
shot remains in the meat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should mention that all of our entrees come with potatoes
that are grown especially for Chez NRA on a secret militia farm in
Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here at the center, we believe in family shooting for fun. So
let me give you a few minutes to look over the menu. You might want
to put your heads together and sort of STALK through the choices.
Heh-heh. A little shooting humor there.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what we always say. 'The family that preys together
stays together.' ``

   WASHINGTON _ Is the Cold War still over?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone rummaging through the strategic attics of the United
States and Russia might well wonder.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United
States and Russia still have more than 14,000 nuclear warheads in
their arsenals. Together, these weapons could deliver the explosive
equivalent of a ton of dynamite for every man, woman and child on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   The point of it all, analysts contend, is deterrence. If each
side understands the other's capability, the reasoning goes,
neither would see a nuclear attack on the other as a viable option.
Often criticized, the approach has helped to hold the two nuclear
powers in check for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton journeys to Moscow this week(CQ), though,
he'll take up the issue of how to reduce those weapons, in his
first summit with Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who leaves Washington on Monday for a week-long swing
that will take him to Portugal, Germany, Russia and the Ukraine, is
to meet with Putin in Moscow June 4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders have much to discuss:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  cooperation on peace efforts in the Middle East and the
Balkans;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the upcoming summit between leaders of North Korea and South
Korea;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  terms of continuing multilateral aid for Russia's beleaguered
economy;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the safeguarding of Russia's advanced weapons technology from
states such as Iran;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and continuing fallout from Russia's brutal war against
Islamic separatists in the southern republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the crowded agenda, however, will be a complex set of
nuclear questions that have divided the former Cold War foes for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important summit,'' Senate Armed Services Committee
Chairman John Warner, R-Va., said at a hearing on the subject
Tuesday. ``I look upon this summit as a building block laying a
foundation for the next president of the United States to build on,
especially in the area of arms control.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Putin and Clinton say they hope to reduce their respective
nuclear arsenals over time. They differ, though, over how deeply to
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of a pair of existing Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaties (START I and START II), both countries have agreed to cut
the number of strategic warheads they have deployed _ perched atop
intercontinental ballistic missiles, for example, loaded into
submarines or tucked in the bomb bay of giant long-range bombers _
to between 3,000 and 3,500 by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin's predecessor, former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, agreed three years ago in Helsinki to seek further
reductions by that time, in cuts that would trim each country's
active warhead inventory to between 2,000 and 2,500 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The further cuts, though, are the subject of a third round of
START talks on which Yeltsin and Clinton made little progress.
Those talks have only gotten underway in earnest, in fact, over the
past several weeks, as Putin has put his new government into place.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining a nuclear arsenal isn't cheap. It costs U.S.
taxpayers anywhere between $20 billion and $33 billion a year,
depending on how costs are allocated.
</P>
<P>
   Russia still employs some 127,000 physicists, nuclear
technicians and weapons experts to maintain its strategic arsenal,
though thousands of them regularly go without pay. The government
is, by some estimates, US$400 million in arrears to these skilled
workers, and the country's poor economy makes a near-term solution
improbable.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the Russians have proposed cutting their
deployed warheads to 1,500. Clinton's opening position is that such
cuts would be too deep. He'd prefer to stick with the Helsinki
formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the risk of large-scale nuclear war is now very low, our
nuclear forces continue to serve as an important hedge against an
uncertain future,'' Defense Department undersecretary for policy,
Walter Slocombe, told Warner's committee. ``They are also a
guarantee of our security commitment to our allies, and a
disincentive to those who would contemplate developing, acquiring
or using their own nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia are even further apart on a
controversial U.S. proposal to set up a defensive shield against
incoming missiles. Clinton is weighing a system that would rely on
roughly 100 interceptor missiles, based in Alaska, on the theory
that such a system could have a strong likelihood of knocking down
a missile coming in across the Pacific Ocean or over the North
Pole.
</P>
<P>
   If a planned July test goes well, Pentagon officials will
present Clinton with cost estimates _ currently they range anywhere
from $20 billion to $60 billion _ and strategic analysis for the
system. It could be September before Clinton gets the Pentagon's
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon claims such a national missile defense system would
be built not to defend against a Russian missile launch, but rather
as protection from attacks by so-called rogue states, such as North
Korea, Iran or Iraq. All three are believed to be well along in
their effort to acquire nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a system that is designed to deal with the Russian
strategic deterrence,'' Deputy Defense Secretary Rudy De Leon told
Pentagon reporters earlier this month. ``It is designed to be a
limited defense, largely against the potential proliferation of
missile technologies in the next decade and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, though, is troubled by the proposal. The Russian
government fears that such a system would negate at least some of
the deterrent effect of its own nuclear arsenal, forcing Russia to
compensate somehow _ likely by deploying more weapons than it would
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds them of Star Wars,'' a White House official said,
referring to the space-based laser defensive shield President
Reagan proposed, and a Democratic Congress killed, during the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing aggressive defense systems from further fueling the
Cold War arms race was the aim of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Nixon in 1972.
The treaty has been amended since then, but essentially it
restricts the ability of either side to deploy more than a limited
number of defensive missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians contend, and the White House agrees, that the ABM
prohibits the United States from building a national missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin agreed last summer, though, at the Group of
Eight meeting in Cologne, Germany, to take up possible amendments
meant to ``strengthen the treaty, to enhance its viability and
effectiveness in the future,'' according to a joint statement the
two leaders signed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes Putin will agree to amend the ABM treaty such that
it would allow a limited national missile defense system, but
Putin's government has yet to warm to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Cologne agreement also called for moving forward with START
III talks, in effect packaging U.S. hopes for ABM treaty
modifications with Russia's plea for further cuts in deployed
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   It's by no means clear that Clinton will be able to complete
those complicated negotiations before he leaves office in January.
White House officials have been especially careful not to predict
any breakthroughs for this summit.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Clinton are scheduled to meet at least three more
times this year, and U.S. officials have stressed the importance of
establishing a working relationship _ perhaps even some trust _
before pressing too hard on difficult nuclear arms issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first face-to-face meeting with Putin, this is a
tough issue, and we've been slogging it out for months now,'' one
White House official said on background.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this official said, ``There's some hope that all of this
will fall together,'' before Clinton leaves office. The summit ``is
not the end of the process,'' this official said, ``but the
beginning.''

   HERZILYA, Israel _ For Hanan Achsaf, president of Motorola
Israel Ltd., the country's occasional ``minor disagreements with
its neighbors'' are not enough to blunt the business attraction of
its brain power.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has worked for Motorola. The company came here first in
the 1960s with an investment of less than $20 million and now
controls assets worth more than $20 billion and 4,100 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's semiconductor design center, with 600 workers in
this suburb of Tel Aviv, is its largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Israel has become famous for its boom
in software start-up companies. But, Motorola is one of about a
dozen major U.S. firms that have invested here to make or develop
microprocessors, or chips _ the hardware brains to computers,
cellular phones and even anti-lock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite a worrisome shortage of engineers to feed such
growth, the list of firms with development centers here reads like
a hi-tech Who's Who: Intel, which has two manufacturing plants
here; along with Texas Instruments; National Semiconductor; IBM;
3COM and Microsoft. Applied Materials, developing and producing
equipment for semiconductor makers, came here in 1991 and now
employs 650 in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good match. Israel, a country of about 6 million people,
has little natural resources _ no oil like its Arab neighbors. It
has few markets available on its borders, either because its
neighbors are hostile or have small economies.
</P>
<P>
   What it can do is produce knowledge and that's what draws the
big chip firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of things that come from being a country
where existential problems are permanent,'' said Orna Berry, who,
until she stepped down this month, oversaw government support for
hi-tech development as Israel's chief scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Berry sees Israel's battles for survival and need to look for
support beyond its own region as helping foster the boom. Israeli
hi-tech workers are considered innovative, competitive and
hardworking. Though Israel's first language is Hebrew, English, the
first language of technology, is commonly spoken.
</P>
<P>
   And, most Israelis have to spend at least a couple of years in
their lives in what has become a hi-tech incubator _ the army.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the army, you have been exposed to the most sophisticated
technology,'' said Achsaf, once an instructor in the air force's
technical school. The army even has a so-called ``genius unit,'' a
special intelligence branch specializing in hi-tech.
</P>
<P>
   The government also kicks in its share, giving about $400
million in grants to industry _ mostly hi-tech _ each year. It gave
Intel $600 million to build a semiconductor plant that opened last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The results have changed the economy. Of Israel's total $35
billion in exports last year, about one-third, or $12 billion were
in hi-tech.
</P>
<P>
   Figures were not available for electronics specifically, but
consider that Intel alone expects to export more than $1 billion
from its chip plant this year. Motorola last year exported about
$257 million from its mostly-communications facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that the American firms have not only helped the
electronics industry here grow, but have professionalized Israeli
marketing and managerial skills. The American influence, they say,
has also smoothed some of the rough edges on Israeli workers, known
to be gruff and undisciplined.
</P>
<P>
   There is some hype in Israel's selling of itself. Government
ministries frequently promote a graph showing that Israel has the
highest number of engineers and scientists per capita in the world.
Those figures come from 1984 and, according to one researcher, were
statistically flawed.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israel is indeed well-educated; third in the world in
percentage of residents with a university degree. That is the
lifeblood in the industry, where firms lose precious time to their
competitors if they have trouble finding labor.
</P>
<P>
   The big question hanging over hi-tech firms here is what will
happen now that Israel is starting to see a shortage of engineers.
It's not yet as acute as it is in the United States, but the labor
market is tightening.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli engineers still earn about 80 percent of what their
counterparts do in the United States, but salaries are climbing and
many workers are simply moving to America. Economists say the
hi-tech sector is at full employment at about 50,000. Berry said
there is actually a shortage of about 5,000 electronics workers.
</P>
<P>
   The crunch would be worse, had it not been for the highly
educated influx of 1 million immigrants from the former Soviet
Union. Motorola officials say about 20 percent of the workers at
their semiconductor center are from there.
</P>
<P>
   The market was still so tight that, two years ago, a corporate
association asked the government to grant visas to about 1,500
engineers from Asia, mostly India. It was an idea that would not
fly in the Jewish state, as some feared it would cause an influx of
largely non-Jewish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shortage, major newcomers still arrive. Last year,
Dallas-based Texas Instruments spent about $415 million to buy two
Israeli companies that develop DSP technology _ specialized chips
for things like cable television systems.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bernier, TI European manager for communications, said the
company still sees Israel as a ``vibrant center of high-level
expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of Israel's electronics firms may depend on whether
the country can maintain its effort to increase the number of
engineering graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while Israel's got a hi-tech boost in the past from its
army technology, it may rely more in the future on it's peacemaking
abilities. Israel Kashat, vice president at Motorola's design
center, said peace talks could enable Israel to use the engineering
pools in the countries on its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, for example, show avid computer affinity and some
already work for Israeli firms. Egypt, with 55 million people, has
a large supply of engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real untapped potential,'' Kashat said, ``is our
neighbors.''

   KIRYAT GAT, Israel _ This meadowland in central Israel was once
the domain of the Philistines and their warrior, Goliath. Now it is
the land of Intel, a much more welcome giant.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's boxy semiconductor plant on the edge of this depressed
town dominates the rural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Arab shepherds still bring their livestock to graze.
Inside, workers in the dust-free ``clean room'' produce advanced
microprocessors _ chips _ for computers all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The company's might seems to stretch the boundaries of this
small country.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.6 billion plant was the largest ever private investment
here. The government chipped in $600 million, the biggest such
corporate subsidy in the country's history. And, last year, Intel
bought Israel's DSP Communications for $1.6 billion, the largest
such acquisition in Israeli history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Intel is pitching its boldest move here yet with the
proposed construction of another semiconductor plant. At a cost of
maybe $3 billion, it would be, of course, the biggest investment
the country has seen.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israel now has its own firm footing as a high technology
center. It is not as needy and almost certainly will not agree to
hand out as much money for another plant as it did in the
mid-1990s, when the deal was made for the last one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole conditions in 1994-95 were different. The whole
circumstances have changed,'' said Israeli Minister for Industry
and Trade Ran Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel is an example of the advantages that have been offered,
and will not be offered to the same extent any longer,'' said
Yaacov Yisraeli, president of the Israel-American Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Cohen met in New York with Intel executives to
discuss the plan. He and Finance Minister Avraham Shochat formed a
commission to decide what Israel can offer. The commission will
take several weeks to make recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Intel's track record here, which goes back nearly 30
years, will be in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The link between the world's biggest make of computer chips and
the tiny Jewish state started with Dov Frohman, an
American-educated Israeli. He joined Intel in 1969 and developed
the EPROM semiconductors, the first devices that allowed computers
to store information even after power was turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Frohman, now a 61-year-old Intel vice president, is known for
his long gray beard and a style that is casual even by Israel's
informal standards.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Frohman wanted to move to Israel from the
United States in 1974. The company appeased him by sending him to
establish its first overseas design center. He put it in Haifa with
just a $300,000 investment.
</P>
<P>
   Intel would add its first overseas manufacturing plant in 1985
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the government of late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin made the deal for the Kiryat Gat plant.
</P>
<P>
   Israel was just starting to realize the great potential the
hi-tech industry could offer a country low on natural resources,
and friendly neighbors. Rabin wanted to steer prosperity toward
depressed towns like Kiryat Gat, about an hour's drive south of Tel
Aviv. With just 20,000 residents, the town has little industry and
unemployment that hovers around 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The plant opened in June 1999 and projects exports exceeding $1
billion a year. Intel employs about 1,700 workers and uses another
1,700 as contract workers from local firms.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of five Intel producers of processors in the advanced
.18 micron technology _ a figure measuring the tiniest distances
possible between components on processors.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, there are few severe Intel detractors. The $600
million government incentive has nearly all been doled out.
</P>
<P>
   Amos Samuel, monitoring Intel's activities for the government,
gives a mixed, but generally positive, review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too bad,'' he says. ``We were hoping it would do better,
but all in all the progress is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel, while refusing to discuss specific terms, said Intel has
not done enough to work with local universities or share knowledge
with local companies.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the company high marks, though, for its involvement in
community projects, such as work with schools, and for establishing
teams to work on its other commitments.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a company big enough to make the locals play by its
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli workers, known for being as unruly as they are
innovative, are getting used to Intel's tight safety and security
regimes. Government inspectors grudgingly let Intel employ Jewish
workers on the Sabbath, a violation of Israel's laws _ albeit
inconsistently enforced _ to preserve country's Jewish nature.
</P>
<P>
   Amit Anter Kertes, Intel's Israel spokesman, said the Kiryat Gat
plant has already added more than $790 million to the Israeli
economy. Nearly 60 percent of that was for construction of the
plant. Intel also claims it helped Israeli firms market $132
million in products, and paid $69 million for goods Intel bought
from local suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The figures do not include salaries for its workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company also graduated and hired 90 Israelis from its own
nine-month course aimed at bringing local residents up to the
skills level needed in the plant. The course will soon start again.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's arrival raised higher hopes among local
residents. Anter Kertes acknowledges, ``They have a lot of
expectations and many of them we can't meet.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Kiryat Gat, a town largely of small tenements
filled with working-class Israeli natives and Russian and
Uzbekistani immigrants, employment at Intel is a dream few count
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good the government gave the money. But a lot of people
here thought that it would mean work for people who live in Kiryat
Gat,'' said Maya Azirov, a 40-year-old native of Uzbekistan who
runs a delicatessen with her husband. ``You need a lot of training
to work there.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Kiryat Gat lacks English speakers. Though the
sign outside the plant spells Intel in English and Hebrew, inside
it is largely an English world.
</P>
<P>
   Koko Fahima, a member of the Kiryat Gat City Council, estimates
that less than 15 percent of workers at the plant are from Kiryat
Gat. Company figures do not dispute that, but note that 60 percent
of the workers are from the larger region around the small town.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a $600 million investment the government could have gotten
a lot more,'' Fahima said, calling Intel a ``superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he's quick to note that Intel has lead to the creation of
50 new companies in the town.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   It's had other effects. Benny Uzinskau, a 25-year-old laborer
who worked for an insulation contractor at Intel, said he was
surprised that the company fined workers for not wearing their
helmets on the job or for smoking where they shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was difficult. But you get used to it.'' Uzinskau
said.
</P>
<P>
   Near the plant, the town's fire station commander Tzion Saban
said he's learned a lot from Intel's fire control experts. A
hotline connects the plant directly to the station.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   But, whether another Intel plant will soon be nearby depends on
how much Intel and Israel still feel they need each other.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Israeli parliament lowered the amount the
government can pitch into a project to 24 percent. That's down from
the nearly 38 percent it gave Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also has other chip makers competing for government
grants. They include Tower Semiconductors, which is offering to
build a new plant in a consortium with Toshiba Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Intel officials say they are evaluating sites near
other plants in Ireland as well as in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon
and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Industry and Trade Minister Cohen said he considers Intel a good
corporate citizen, but notes that he talks to companies all the
time that want to come here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is one of the advanced economies all over the world,''
he said. ``We do not need one project to change Israel.''

<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Just to stay in business, Chuba Egolum must
cope with daily annoyances most Americans would confront only
during a natural catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, people who know Nigeria like to sum things up with a
joke: ``What's the difference between Nigeria and a disaster
area?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``In a disaster area, the Red Cross will come to help
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Egolum isn't laughing. His time in the United States _ including
three years obtaining an MBA in Atlanta _ taught him to appreciate
basic things longed for in a place like Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I have to deal with whether I'm going to have
electricity,'' he says, sitting at his desk in a striped golf shirt
and tan Dockers trousers. His company drills wells and builds water
distribution systems. ``I have to make sure to pump enough water
into the tank on top of the building so we will be able to flush
the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic in this immense swirling city is impassable at most
hours. ``It is bedeviling,'' Egolum says. ``When I pick up the
phone, most often it is dead,'' he says. ``This is what it is to do
business in Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite it all, Egolum is hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in nearly two decades, Nigeria has a civilian
government. Africa's most populous nation, with 123 million people,
now can carry on without the crushing weight of the corrupt
military regimes that have saddled it for most of its 40 years of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   While the end of military rule is universally praised, a year of
living democratically has been sobering, even disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is a new experience for us,'' says Egolum, who still
considers genuine representative government a distant destination _
a Promised Land. ``We haven't gotten there yet, but we have a
pretty good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This sentiment is widespread in Nigeria, but it is accompanied
by an uneasy belief that the window of opportunity may shut at any
time. People worry in particular that too much may be riding on the
powers of one man: President Olusegan Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday(5/29), Obasanjo will celebrate the anniversary of his
inauguration as Nigeria's first civilian leader since 1983. A man
who counts among his friends Bill Clinton and former President
Jimmy Carter, Obasanjo, 63, is regarded widely as an honest,
intelligent and dedicated leader. Among his credentials is a period
as chairman of Transparency International, a Berlin-based
organization that promotes honest government.
</P>
<P>
   And by most measures, Obasanjo, a former general who ruled
between 1976 and 1979 before handing power to a doomed civilian
government, has made an auspicious start. He summarily retired from
government crooked military officers, pushed an ethics agenda and
has labored to repair the country's dreadful reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the problems confronting Obasanjo and Nigeria remain both
broad and deep, a perilous combination in a country whose people
have high expectations and little patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigerians are about getting Nigeria fixed,'' said John Muibi
Amoda, the head of the pro-democracy Africa Peace Support
Initiative. Yet, Amoda cautions that people expect too much and
understand too little. ``Just because you have an internationally
monitored so-called democratic election doesn't mean that you have
a democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While reformers demand that Obasanjo do more, the robber barons
who dominated for so long are working to obstruct him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is walking a tightrope with people at both ends
shaking the rope,'' Amoda said.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders are aware of the president's plight but are
eager for him to succeed because they believe Africa's future may
depend heavily on the success of a healthy and democratic Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration identified Nigeria as one of four
''key democracies'' along with Colombia, Indonesia and Ukraine. It
ended the country's pariah status, and is seeking $100 million in
aid. In January, the administration said it would end its ban on
direct flights from the United States to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Obasanjo has pledged to deploy his disused but
still potent military to help bring stability to west Africa. He
offered to send peacekeepers to Sierra Leone, so long as Nigeria
receives foreign support _ particularly from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also has responded favorably, if vaguely, to
Obasanjo's anxious pleas for relief from the country's estimated
$35 billion in international debt, which consumes more than a third
of Nigeria's federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers take particular note of Obasanjo's
ambitions of doubling Nigeria's oil output to 4 million barrels a
day. The country already produces about twice as much crude oil as
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Obasanjo embraces the free market and has embarked
on a drive to privatize major industries.
</P>
<P>
   And while Obasanjo's momentum has been stalled by an assertive
Legislature _ which will be a year old in June _ many observers
believe the government is at least learning the deliberative,
power-sharing process.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Nigeria was poised to assume the role of an
African superpower. Today it is a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years this vast country _ which is about the size of
Texas, Georgia and Florida combined _ was ravaged by military
juntas that wrecked the economy, impoverished the people and
depleted the national treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of neglect are everywhere. In the primary city Lagos,
skyscrapers stand with broken windows and weedy sidewalks like the
ruins of some flourishing but bygone metropolis. Without reliable
electricity, elevators rarely run in the buildings made stifling by
the lack of air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the commerce in this sprawling urban jumble of 11
million is what economists call ``informal,'' meaning individuals
and small businesses hawk whatever they can for whatever they can
get. In many ways, Nigeria is a nation of hardy and hard-bitten
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   In today's world of e-commerce and automated everything, Nigeria
seems primitive. Banks don't issue credit cards and, with the
exception of the two or three hotels that specialize in fleecing
foreigners, no one accepts them. There are no automated teller
machines and, perhaps most startling, no McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is a constant companion. Hotel doormen panic when foreign
guests suggest taking a stroll. For a fee, heavily armed soldiers
at the airport will stand guard over newly arrived visitors and
their bags until a taxi or friend comes to gather them up.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking any public transport and little traffic enforcement,
roads in Lagos are choked in a hopeless, chaotic gridlock _ known
here as ``slow-go.'' To keep things moving, whip-bearing policeman
apprehend laggardly drivers and administer lashes on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   And even with its vast oil resources, Nigeria must import
gasoline, creating frequent shortages and a thriving black market.
Without the luxury of being able to worry about the environment,
the air has become brown with dust and pollution and roadsides are
covered with layers of litter. Much of the country's hardwood
forests are gone and the oil-rich Niger Delta is a disaster in the
view of many environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to get the impression that nothing works.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians blame the mess on the run of dictators who were inept,
dishonest or both. Over the past two decades, Nigeria developed the
reputation of being perhaps the world's most corrupt country. (In
1998, Transparency International rated Nigeria No. 2 among corrupt
countries,
</P>
<P>
   trailing only neighboring Cameroon.)
</P>
<P>
   To many outsiders, it often seemed as if the entire nation was
on the take. From passport officers to traffic cops, just about any
problem could be resolved with a ``dash'' _ a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian leaders now consider regaining credibility paramount.
``If there is one single thing that has retarded economic
development, it is the issue of corruption,'' said Farouk Lawan,
the chairman of the ethics committee of the Nigerian House of
Representatives. ``We are talking about a situation where the
previous head of state looted vast amounts of money and stifled
</P>
<P>
   the entire economic system of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruled from 1993 until he died in office in
1998, is accused of personally stealing more than $4 billion. With
the assistance of friendly governments _ including the United
States _ Obasanjo has located several hundred million. But much of
the money may never be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many small victories, the economy remains in critical
but at least stable condition. Last weekend, Obasanjo announced
that Nigeria was had caught up with $1.5 billion in back payments
to the government's private partners in oil joint ventures,
including Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon-Mobil and Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, economists worry that a recovery may be impossible
given the poor state of the nation's infrastructure, particularly
the power grid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence in the Nigerian economy cannot be restored
until these basic infrastructure needs are met,'' said Chike
Uchime, the editor of the Nigerian magazine Business &AMP; Finance
Digest. Additionally, the country needs to diversify its economy,
he said. Nearly 90 percent of the country's export revenues and
virtually all its tax income comes from oil.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest internal threat is the continued strife
between Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The flashpoint has been the attempt by leaders in the heavily
Muslim northern states to impose Sharia, conservative Islamic law.
Since February the conflict has claimed thousands of lives in
brutal clashes with machetes the weapon of choice. Obasanjo has
been criticized for reacting too slowly and indecisively.
Politicians from both religions express concerns that
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria will disintegrate if Obasanjo cannot gain control of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With all the problems, most people seem to believe that the
change toward democracy is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   On a particularly hot day recently, T. Bimbo Akande sought
refuge in the breeze made by a fan in his office on the 18th floor
in one of the weary old skyscrapers that haunt downtown Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Akande believes his import-export business will improve only if
Obasanjo can win the trust of foreign investors. He's skeptical but
modestly hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   However, Akande counts his loss to the years of chaos in
personal terms. In November, his 21-year-old son Dapo Akande came
home in the evening to a dark house. As usual, the power was out,
so he cranked up the diesel-powered generator. It burst flames that
engulfed the young man.
</P>
<P>
   Akande found his son and rushed him to the poorly equipped and
scantily staffed hospital. Four days later, he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my loss to the conditions in Nigeria,'' Akande said.
``He was a huge investment for me that I will never be able to
recover. How many souls have been wasted just this way?''
</P>
<P>
   Akande, whose brother lives in the suburban Atlanta community of
Powder Springs, expressed deep frustration at the wasted potential
_ both in his son and his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've traveled around the world and I know what this country
has to offer, what its people are capable of,'' he said. ``With
good leadership. We should be among the first in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all too obvious, isn't it. There's no going back from
democracy.''

<P>
   History: First inhabted in about 500 B.C, but Nok people; many
tribes followed. Islam was introduced in the 13th century. The
British annexed Lagos in 1851 and seized control of the rest of the
region by 1886. Britain created Nigeria and made it a colony in
1914. Nigeria gained independence in 1960. Rioting broke out in
1966, and military leaders seized control. In July, a second
military coup put Col. Yakubu Gowon in power. Also in that year,
Muslim Hausas in the north massacred Christian Ibos in the east,
many of whom had been driven from the north. Thousands of Ibos took
refuge in the eastern region, which declared its independence as
Biafra in 1967. In 1970, Biafra surrendered to the federal
government. Gowon's nine-year rule ended in 1975 with a bloodless
coup that made Gen. Muritala Rufai Mohammed chief of state. Gen.
Olesugan Obasanjo assumed power in 1976 and in 1979 handed control
to civilian government of Alhaji Shehu Shagari. An oil boom in the
1970s buoyed the economy, and by the 1980s Nigeria was considered
an exemplary of African democracy. In 1984, the military seized
power, only to be followed by a coup in 1985. Gen. Ibrahim
Babangida said the country would be returned to civilian rule, but
in 1993 he voided the results of election and Babangida resigned.
In November 1993, Gen. Sani Abacha led a coup to restore military
rule. Abacha's regime was condemned for corruption and inefficiency
as well as a harshly repressive methods. Abacha's rule turned
Nigeria into an international pariah. The hanging of writer Ken
Saro-Wiwa in 1995 was condemned around the world. Abacha died of a
heart attack in June 1998, and was succeeded by another military
ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar. He pledged to step aside for an
elected leader by May 1999. In February 1999, Obasanjo won an
overwhelming victory. He was inaugurated May 29, 1999.

   WASHINGTON _ Is the Cold War still over?
</P>
<P>
   Anyone rummaging through the strategic attics of the United
States and Russia might well wonder.
</P>
<P>
   A decade after the collapse of the Soviet Union, the United
States and Russia still have more than 14,000 nuclear warheads in
their arsenals. Together, these weapons could deliver the explosive
equivalent of a ton of dynamite for every man, woman and child on
earth.
</P>
<P>
   The point of it all, analysts contend, is deterrence. If each
side understands the other's capability, the reasoning goes,
neither would see a nuclear attack on the other as a viable option.
Often criticized, the approach has helped to hold the two nuclear
powers in check for half a century.
</P>
<P>
   When President Clinton journeys to Moscow this week(CQ), though,
he'll take up the issue of how to reduce those weapons, in his
first summit with Russia's new president, Vladimir Putin.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who leaves Washington on Monday for a week-long swing
that will take him to Portugal, Germany, Russia and the Ukraine, is
to meet with Putin in Moscow June 4 and 5.
</P>
<P>
   The two leaders have much to discuss:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  cooperation on peace efforts in the Middle East and the
Balkans;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the upcoming summit between leaders of North Korea and South
Korea;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  terms of continuing multilateral aid for Russia's beleaguered
economy;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  the safeguarding of Russia's advanced weapons technology from
states such as Iran;
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  and continuing fallout from Russia's brutal war against
Islamic separatists in the southern republic of Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Topping the crowded agenda, however, will be a complex set of
nuclear questions that have divided the former Cold War foes for
decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an important summit,'' Senate Armed Services Committee
Chairman John Warner, R-Va., said at a hearing on the subject
Tuesday. ``I look upon this summit as a building block laying a
foundation for the next president of the United States to build on,
especially in the area of arms control.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Putin and Clinton say they hope to reduce their respective
nuclear arsenals over time. They differ, though, over how deeply to
cut.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of a pair of existing Strategic Arms Reduction
Treaties (START I and START II), both countries have agreed to cut
the number of strategic warheads they have deployed _ perched atop
intercontinental ballistic missiles, for example, loaded into
submarines or tucked in the bomb bay of giant long-range bombers _
to between 3,000 and 3,500 by the year 2008.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Putin's predecessor, former Russian President Boris
Yeltsin, agreed three years ago in Helsinki to seek further
reductions by that time, in cuts that would trim each country's
active warhead inventory to between 2,000 and 2,500 warheads.
</P>
<P>
   The further cuts, though, are the subject of a third round of
START talks on which Yeltsin and Clinton made little progress.
Those talks have only gotten underway in earnest, in fact, over the
past several weeks, as Putin has put his new government into place.
</P>
<P>
   Maintaining a nuclear arsenal isn't cheap. It costs U.S.
taxpayers anywhere between $20 billion and $33 billion a year,
depending on how costs are allocated.
</P>
<P>
   Russia still employs some 127,000 physicists, nuclear
technicians and weapons experts to maintain its strategic arsenal,
though thousands of them regularly go without pay. The government
is, by some estimates, US$400 million in arrears to these skilled
workers, and the country's poor economy makes a near-term solution
improbable.
</P>
<P>
   With that in mind, the Russians have proposed cutting their
deployed warheads to 1,500. Clinton's opening position is that such
cuts would be too deep. He'd prefer to stick with the Helsinki
formula.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the risk of large-scale nuclear war is now very low, our
nuclear forces continue to serve as an important hedge against an
uncertain future,'' Defense Department undersecretary for policy,
Walter Slocombe, told Warner's committee. ``They are also a
guarantee of our security commitment to our allies, and a
disincentive to those who would contemplate developing, acquiring
or using their own nuclear weapons.''
</P>
<P>
   The United States and Russia are even further apart on a
controversial U.S. proposal to set up a defensive shield against
incoming missiles. Clinton is weighing a system that would rely on
roughly 100 interceptor missiles, based in Alaska, on the theory
that such a system could have a strong likelihood of knocking down
a missile coming in across the Pacific Ocean or over the North
Pole.
</P>
<P>
   If a planned July test goes well, Pentagon officials will
present Clinton with cost estimates _ currently they range anywhere
from $20 billion to $60 billion _ and strategic analysis for the
system. It could be September before Clinton gets the Pentagon's
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon claims such a national missile defense system would
be built not to defend against a Russian missile launch, but rather
as protection from attacks by so-called rogue states, such as North
Korea, Iran or Iraq. All three are believed to be well along in
their effort to acquire nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a system that is designed to deal with the Russian
strategic deterrence,'' Deputy Defense Secretary Rudy De Leon told
Pentagon reporters earlier this month. ``It is designed to be a
limited defense, largely against the potential proliferation of
missile technologies in the next decade and beyond.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscow, though, is troubled by the proposal. The Russian
government fears that such a system would negate at least some of
the deterrent effect of its own nuclear arsenal, forcing Russia to
compensate somehow _ likely by deploying more weapons than it would
otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   ``It reminds them of Star Wars,'' a White House official said,
referring to the space-based laser defensive shield President
Reagan proposed, and a Democratic Congress killed, during the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Preventing aggressive defense systems from further fueling the
Cold War arms race was the aim of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM)
treaty negotiated with the Soviet Union by President Nixon in 1972.
The treaty has been amended since then, but essentially it
restricts the ability of either side to deploy more than a limited
number of defensive missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians contend, and the White House agrees, that the ABM
prohibits the United States from building a national missile
defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Yeltsin agreed last summer, though, at the Group of
Eight meeting in Cologne, Germany, to take up possible amendments
meant to ``strengthen the treaty, to enhance its viability and
effectiveness in the future,'' according to a joint statement the
two leaders signed.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton hopes Putin will agree to amend the ABM treaty such that
it would allow a limited national missile defense system, but
Putin's government has yet to warm to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Cologne agreement also called for moving forward with START
III talks, in effect packaging U.S. hopes for ABM treaty
modifications with Russia's plea for further cuts in deployed
warheads.
</P>
<P>
   It's by no means clear that Clinton will be able to complete
those complicated negotiations before he leaves office in January.
White House officials have been especially careful not to predict
any breakthroughs for this summit.
</P>
<P>
   Putin and Clinton are scheduled to meet at least three more
times this year, and U.S. officials have stressed the importance of
establishing a working relationship _ perhaps even some trust _
before pressing too hard on difficult nuclear arms issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first face-to-face meeting with Putin, this is a
tough issue, and we've been slogging it out for months now,'' one
White House official said on background.
</P>
<P>
   Still, this official said, ``There's some hope that all of this
will fall together,'' before Clinton leaves office. The summit ``is
not the end of the process,'' this official said, ``but the
beginning.''

HARD TO WEED OUT

<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Just to stay in business, Chuba Egolum must
cope with daily annoyances most Americans would confront only
during a natural catastrophe.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, people who know Nigeria like to sum things up with a
joke: ``What's the difference between Nigeria and a disaster
area?''
</P>
<P>
   Answer: ``In a disaster area, the Red Cross will come to help
you.''
</P>
<P>
   Egolum isn't laughing. His time in the United States _ including
three years obtaining an MBA in Atlanta _ taught him to appreciate
basic things longed for in a place like Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day I have to deal with whether I'm going to have
electricity,'' he says, sitting at his desk in a striped golf shirt
and tan Dockers trousers. His company drills wells and builds water
distribution systems. ``I have to make sure to pump enough water
into the tank on top of the building so we will be able to flush
the toilet.''
</P>
<P>
   Traffic in this immense swirling city is impassable at most
hours. ``It is bedeviling,'' Egolum says. ``When I pick up the
phone, most often it is dead,'' he says. ``This is what it is to do
business in Nigeria.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, despite it all, Egolum is hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in nearly two decades, Nigeria has a civilian
government. Africa's most populous nation, with 123 million people,
now can carry on without the crushing weight of the corrupt
military regimes that have saddled it for most of its 40 years of
independence.
</P>
<P>
   While the end of military rule is universally praised, a year of
living democratically has been sobering, even disappointing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democracy is a new experience for us,'' says Egolum, who still
considers genuine representative government a distant destination _
a Promised Land. ``We haven't gotten there yet, but we have a
pretty good chance.''
</P>
<P>
   This sentiment is widespread in Nigeria, but it is accompanied
by an uneasy belief that the window of opportunity may shut at any
time. People worry in particular that too much may be riding on the
powers of one man: President Olusegan Obasanjo.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday(5/29), Obasanjo will celebrate the anniversary of his
inauguration as Nigeria's first civilian leader since 1983. A man
who counts among his friends Bill Clinton and former President
Jimmy Carter, Obasanjo, 63, is regarded widely as an honest,
intelligent and dedicated leader. Among his credentials is a period
as chairman of Transparency International, a Berlin-based
organization that promotes honest government.
</P>
<P>
   And by most measures, Obasanjo, a former general who ruled
between 1976 and 1979 before handing power to a doomed civilian
government, has made an auspicious start. He summarily retired from
government crooked military officers, pushed an ethics agenda and
has labored to repair the country's dreadful reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the problems confronting Obasanjo and Nigeria remain both
broad and deep, a perilous combination in a country whose people
have high expectations and little patience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nigerians are about getting Nigeria fixed,'' said John Muibi
Amoda, the head of the pro-democracy Africa Peace Support
Initiative. Yet, Amoda cautions that people expect too much and
understand too little. ``Just because you have an internationally
monitored so-called democratic election doesn't mean that you have
a democracy,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   While reformers demand that Obasanjo do more, the robber barons
who dominated for so long are working to obstruct him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is walking a tightrope with people at both ends
shaking the rope,'' Amoda said.
</P>
<P>
   Western leaders are aware of the president's plight but are
eager for him to succeed because they believe Africa's future may
depend heavily on the success of a healthy and democratic Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration identified Nigeria as one of four
''key democracies'' along with Colombia, Indonesia and Ukraine. It
ended the country's pariah status, and is seeking $100 million in
aid. In January, the administration said it would end its ban on
direct flights from the United States to Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Obasanjo has pledged to deploy his disused but
still potent military to help bring stability to west Africa. He
offered to send peacekeepers to Sierra Leone, so long as Nigeria
receives foreign support _ particularly from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The White House also has responded favorably, if vaguely, to
Obasanjo's anxious pleas for relief from the country's estimated
$35 billion in international debt, which consumes more than a third
of Nigeria's federal budget.
</P>
<P>
   American policymakers take particular note of Obasanjo's
ambitions of doubling Nigeria's oil output to 4 million barrels a
day. The country already produces about twice as much crude oil as
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, Obasanjo embraces the free market and has embarked
on a drive to privatize major industries.
</P>
<P>
   And while Obasanjo's momentum has been stalled by an assertive
Legislature _ which will be a year old in June _ many observers
believe the government is at least learning the deliberative,
power-sharing process.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, Nigeria was poised to assume the role of an
African superpower. Today it is a shambles.
</P>
<P>
   For 17 years this vast country _ which is about the size of
Texas, Georgia and Florida combined _ was ravaged by military
juntas that wrecked the economy, impoverished the people and
depleted the national treasury.
</P>
<P>
   Signs of neglect are everywhere. In the primary city Lagos,
skyscrapers stand with broken windows and weedy sidewalks like the
ruins of some flourishing but bygone metropolis. Without reliable
electricity, elevators rarely run in the buildings made stifling by
the lack of air-conditioning.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the commerce in this sprawling urban jumble of 11
million is what economists call ``informal,'' meaning individuals
and small businesses hawk whatever they can for whatever they can
get. In many ways, Nigeria is a nation of hardy and hard-bitten
entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
   In today's world of e-commerce and automated everything, Nigeria
seems primitive. Banks don't issue credit cards and, with the
exception of the two or three hotels that specialize in fleecing
foreigners, no one accepts them. There are no automated teller
machines and, perhaps most startling, no McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   Crime is a constant companion. Hotel doormen panic when foreign
guests suggest taking a stroll. For a fee, heavily armed soldiers
at the airport will stand guard over newly arrived visitors and
their bags until a taxi or friend comes to gather them up.
</P>
<P>
   Lacking any public transport and little traffic enforcement,
roads in Lagos are choked in a hopeless, chaotic gridlock _ known
here as ``slow-go.'' To keep things moving, whip-bearing policeman
apprehend laggardly drivers and administer lashes on the spot.
</P>
<P>
   And even with its vast oil resources, Nigeria must import
gasoline, creating frequent shortages and a thriving black market.
Without the luxury of being able to worry about the environment,
the air has become brown with dust and pollution and roadsides are
covered with layers of litter. Much of the country's hardwood
forests are gone and the oil-rich Niger Delta is a disaster in the
view of many environmentalists.
</P>
<P>
   It is hard not to get the impression that nothing works.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians blame the mess on the run of dictators who were inept,
dishonest or both. Over the past two decades, Nigeria developed the
reputation of being perhaps the world's most corrupt country. (In
1998, Transparency International rated Nigeria No. 2 among corrupt
countries,
</P>
<P>
   trailing only neighboring Cameroon.)
</P>
<P>
   To many outsiders, it often seemed as if the entire nation was
on the take. From passport officers to traffic cops, just about any
problem could be resolved with a ``dash'' _ a bribe.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerian leaders now consider regaining credibility paramount.
``If there is one single thing that has retarded economic
development, it is the issue of corruption,'' said Farouk Lawan,
the chairman of the ethics committee of the Nigerian House of
Representatives. ``We are talking about a situation where the
previous head of state looted vast amounts of money and stifled
</P>
<P>
   the entire economic system of this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Gen. Sani Abacha, who ruled from 1993 until he died in office in
1998, is accused of personally stealing more than $4 billion. With
the assistance of friendly governments _ including the United
States _ Obasanjo has located several hundred million. But much of
the money may never be recovered.
</P>
<P>
   Despite many small victories, the economy remains in critical
but at least stable condition. Last weekend, Obasanjo announced
that Nigeria was had caught up with $1.5 billion in back payments
to the government's private partners in oil joint ventures,
including Royal Dutch Shell, Exxon-Mobil and Chevron.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, economists worry that a recovery may be impossible
given the poor state of the nation's infrastructure, particularly
the power grid.
</P>
<P>
   ``The confidence in the Nigerian economy cannot be restored
until these basic infrastructure needs are met,'' said Chike
Uchime, the editor of the Nigerian magazine Business &AMP; Finance
Digest. Additionally, the country needs to diversify its economy,
he said. Nearly 90 percent of the country's export revenues and
virtually all its tax income comes from oil.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the greatest internal threat is the continued strife
between Muslims and Christians.
</P>
<P>
   The flashpoint has been the attempt by leaders in the heavily
Muslim northern states to impose Sharia, conservative Islamic law.
Since February the conflict has claimed thousands of lives in
brutal clashes with machetes the weapon of choice. Obasanjo has
been criticized for reacting too slowly and indecisively.
Politicians from both religions express concerns that
</P>
<P>
   Nigeria will disintegrate if Obasanjo cannot gain control of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
   With all the problems, most people seem to believe that the
change toward democracy is irreversible.
</P>
<P>
   On a particularly hot day recently, T. Bimbo Akande sought
refuge in the breeze made by a fan in his office on the 18th floor
in one of the weary old skyscrapers that haunt downtown Lagos.
</P>
<P>
   Akande believes his import-export business will improve only if
Obasanjo can win the trust of foreign investors. He's skeptical but
modestly hopeful.
</P>
<P>
   However, Akande counts his loss to the years of chaos in
personal terms. In November, his 21-year-old son Dapo Akande came
home in the evening to a dark house. As usual, the power was out,
so he cranked up the diesel-powered generator. It burst flames that
engulfed the young man.
</P>
<P>
   Akande found his son and rushed him to the poorly equipped and
scantily staffed hospital. Four days later, he died.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was my loss to the conditions in Nigeria,'' Akande said.
``He was a huge investment for me that I will never be able to
recover. How many souls have been wasted just this way?''
</P>
<P>
   Akande, whose brother lives in the suburban Atlanta community of
Powder Springs, expressed deep frustration at the wasted potential
_ both in his son and his country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've traveled around the world and I know what this country
has to offer, what its people are capable of,'' he said. ``With
good leadership. We should be among the first in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all too obvious, isn't it. There's no going back from
democracy.''

   History: First inhabted in about 500 B.C, but Nok people; many
tribes followed. Islam was introduced in the 13th century. The
British annexed Lagos in 1851 and seized control of the rest of the
region by 1886. Britain created Nigeria and made it a colony in
1914. Nigeria gained independence in 1960. Rioting broke out in
1966, and military leaders seized control. In July, a second
military coup put Col. Yakubu Gowon in power. Also in that year,
Muslim Hausas in the north massacred Christian Ibos in the east,
many of whom had been driven from the north. Thousands of Ibos took
refuge in the eastern region, which declared its independence as
Biafra in 1967. In 1970, Biafra surrendered to the federal
government. Gowon's nine-year rule ended in 1975 with a bloodless
coup that made Gen. Muritala Rufai Mohammed chief of state. Gen.
Olesugan Obasanjo assumed power in 1976 and in 1979 handed control
to civilian government of Alhaji Shehu Shagari. An oil boom in the
1970s buoyed the economy, and by the 1980s Nigeria was considered
an exemplary of African democracy. In 1984, the military seized
power, only to be followed by a coup in 1985. Gen. Ibrahim
Babangida said the country would be returned to civilian rule, but
in 1993 he voided the results of election and Babangida resigned.
In November 1993, Gen. Sani Abacha led a coup to restore military
rule. Abacha's regime was condemned for corruption and inefficiency
as well as a harshly repressive methods. Abacha's rule turned
Nigeria into an international pariah. The hanging of writer Ken
Saro-Wiwa in 1995 was condemned around the world. Abacha died of a
heart attack in June 1998, and was succeeded by another military
ruler, Gen. Abdulsalam Abubakar. He pledged to step aside for an
elected leader by May 1999. In February 1999, Obasanjo won an
overwhelming victory. He was inaugurated May 29, 1999.

   HERZILYA, Israel _ For Hanan Achsaf, president of Motorola
Israel Ltd., the country's occasional ``minor disagreements with
its neighbors'' are not enough to blunt the business attraction of
its brain power.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has worked for Motorola. The company came here first in
the 1960s with an investment of less than $20 million and now
controls assets worth more than $20 billion and 4,100 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's semiconductor design center, with 600 workers in
this suburb of Tel Aviv, is its largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Israel has become famous for its boom
in software start-up companies. But, Motorola is one of about a
dozen major U.S. firms that have invested here to make or develop
microprocessors, or chips _ the hardware brains to computers,
cellular phones and even anti-lock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite a worrisome shortage of engineers to feed such
growth, the list of firms with development centers here reads like
a hi-tech Who's Who: Intel, which has two manufacturing plants
here; along with Texas Instruments; National Semiconductor; IBM;
3COM and Microsoft. Applied Materials, developing and producing
equipment for semiconductor makers, came here in 1991 and now
employs 650 in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good match. Israel, a country of about 6 million people,
has little natural resources _ no oil like its Arab neighbors. It
has few markets available on its borders, either because its
neighbors are hostile or have small economies.
</P>
<P>
   What it can do is produce knowledge and that's what draws the
big chip firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of things that come from being a country
where existential problems are permanent,'' said Orna Berry, who,
until she stepped down this month, oversaw government support for
hi-tech development as Israel's chief scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Berry sees Israel's battles for survival and need to look for
support beyond its own region as helping foster the boom. Israeli
hi-tech workers are considered innovative, competitive and
hardworking. Though Israel's first language is Hebrew, English, the
first language of technology, is commonly spoken.
</P>
<P>
   And, most Israelis have to spend at least a couple of years in
their lives in what has become a hi-tech incubatom there.
</P>
<P>
   The market was still so tight that, two years ago, a corporate
association asked the government to grant visas to about 1,500
engineers from Asia, mostly India. It was an idea that would not
fly in the Jewish state, as some feared it would cause an influx of
largely non-Jewish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shortage, major newcomers still arrive. Last year,
Dallas-based Texas Instruments spent about $415 million to buy two
Israeli companies that develop DSP technology _ specialized chips
for things like cable television systems.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bernier, TI European manager for communications, said the
company still sees Israel as a ``vibrant center of high-level
expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of Israel's electronics firms may depend on whether
the country can maintain its effort to increase the number of
engineering graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while Israel's got a hi-tech boost in the past from its
army technology, it may rely more in the future on it's peacemaking
abilities. Israel Kashat, vice president at Motorola's design
center, said peace talks could enable Israel to use the engineering
pools in the countries on its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, for example, show avid computer affinity and some
already work for Israeli firms. Egypt, with 55 million people, has
a large supply of engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real untapped potential,'' Kashat said, ``is our
neighbors.''

<P>
   KIRYAT GAT, Israel _ This meadowland in central Israel was once
the domain of the Philistines and their warrior, Goliath. Now it is
the land of Intel, a much more welcome giant.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's boxy semiconductor plant on the edge of this depressed
town dominates the rural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Arab shepherds still bring their livestock to graze.
Inside, workers in the dust-free ``clean room'' produce advanced
microprocessors _ chips _ for computers all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The company's might seems to stretch the boundaries of this
small country.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.6 billion plant was the largest ever private investment
here. The government chipped in $600 million, the biggest such
corporate subsidy in the country's history. And, last year, Intel
bought Israel's DSP Communications for $1.6 billion, the largest
such acquisition in Israeli history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Intel is pitching its boldest move here yet with the
proposed construction of another semiconductor plant. At a cost of
maybe $3 billion, it would be, of course, the biggest investment
the country has seen.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israel now has its own firm footing as a high technology
center. It is not as needy and almost certainly will not agree to
hand out as much money for another plant as it did in the
mid-1990s, when the deal was made for the last one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole conditions in 1994-95 were different. The whole
circumstances have changed,'' said Israeli Minister for Industry
and Trade Ran Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel is an example of the advantages that have been offered,
and will not be offered to the same extent any longer,'' said
Yaacov Yisraeli, president of the Israel-American Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Cohen met in New York with Intel executives to
discuss the plan. He and Finance Minister Avraham Shochat formed a
commission to decide what Israel can offer. The commission will
take several weeks to make recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Intel's track record here, which goes back nearly 30
years, will be in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The link between the world's biggest make of computer chips and
the tiny Jewish state started with Dov Frohman, an
American-educated Israeli. He joined Intel in 1969 and developed
the EPROM semiconductors, the first devices that allowed computers
to store information even after power was turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Frohman, now a 61-year-old Intel vice president, is known for
his long gray beard and a style that is casual even by Israel's
informal standards.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Frohman wanted to move to Israel from the
United States in 1974. The company appeased him by sending him to
establish its first overseas design center. He put it in Haifa with
just a $300,000 investment.
</P>
<P>
   Intel would add its first overseas manufacturing plant in 1985
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the government of late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin made the deal for the Kiryat Gat plant.
</P>
<P>
   Israel was just starting to realize the great potential the
hi-tech industry could offer a country low on natural resources,
and friendly neighbors. Rabin wanted to steer prosperity toward
depressed towns like Kiryat Gat, about an hour's drive south of Tel
Aviv. With just 20,000 residents, the town has little industry and
unemployment that hovers around 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The plant opened in June 1999 and projects exports exceeding $1
billion a year. Intel employs about 1,700 workers and uses another
1,700 as contract workers from local firms.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of five Intel producers of processors in the advanced
.18 micron technology _ a figure measuring the tiniest distances
possible between components on processors.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, there are few severe Intel detractors. The $600
million government incentive has nearly all been doled out.
</P>
<P>
   Amos Samuel, monitoring Intel's activities for the government,
gives a mixed, but generally positive, review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too bad,'' he says. ``We were hoping it would do better,
but all in all the progress is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel, while refusing to discuss specific terms, said Intel has
not done enough to work with local universities or share knowledge
with local companies.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the company high marks, though, for its involvement in
community projects, such as work with schools, and for establishing
teams to work on its other commitments.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a company big enough to make the locals play by its
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli workers, known for being as unruly as they are
innovative, are getting used to Intel's tight safety and security
regimes. Government inspectors grudgingly let Intel employ Jewish
workers on the Sabbath, a violation of Israel's laws _ albeit
inconsistently enforced _ to preserve country's Jewish nature.
</P>
<P>
   Amit Anter Kertes, Intel's Israel spokesman, said the Kiryat Gat
plant has already added more than $790 million to the Israeli
economy. Nearly 60 percent of that was for construction of the
plant. Intel also claims it helped Israeli firms market $132
million in products, and paid $69 million for goods Intel bought
from local suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The figures do not include salaries for its workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company also graduated and hired 90 Israelis from its own
nine-month course aimed at bringing local residents up to the
skills level needed in the plant. The course will soon start again.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's arrival raised higher hopes among local
residents. Anter Kertes acknowledges, ``They have a lot of
expectations and many of them we can't meet.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Kiryat Gat, a town largely of small tenements
filled with working-class Israeli natives and Russian and
Uzbekistani immigrants, employment at Intel is a dream few count
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good the government gave the money. But a lot of people
here thought that it would mean work for people who live in Kiryat
Gat,'' said Maya Azirov, a 40-year-old native of Uzbekistan who
runs a delicatessen with her husband. ``You need a lot of training
to work there.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Kiryat Gat lacks English speakers. Though the
sign outside the plant spells Intel in English and Hebrew, inside
it is largely an English world.
</P>
<P>
   Koko Fahima, a member of the Kiryat Gat City Council, estimates
that less than 15 percent of workers at the plant are from Kiryat
Gat. Company figures do not dispute that, but note that 60 percent
of the workers are from the larger region around the small town.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a $600 million investment the government could have gotten
a lot more,'' Fahima said, calling Intel a ``superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he's quick to note that Intel has lead to the creation of
50 new companies in the town.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   It's had other effects. Benny Uzinskau, a 25-year-old laborer
who worked for an insulation contractor at Intel, said he was
surprised that the company fined workers for not wearing their
helmets on the job or for smoking where they shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was difficult. But you get used to it.'' Uzinskau
said.
</P>
<P>
   Near the plant, the town's fire station commander Tzion Saban
said he's learned a lot from Intel's fire control experts. A
hotline connects the plant directly to the station.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   But, whether another Intel plant will soon be nearby depends on
how much Intel and Israel still feel they need each other.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Israeli parliament lowered the amount the
government can pitch into a project to 24 percent. That's down from
the nearly 38 percent it gave Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also has other chip makers competing for government
grants. They include Tower Semiconductors, which is offering to
build a new plant in a consortium with Toshiba Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Intel officials say they are evaluating sites near
other plants in Ireland as well as in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon
and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Industry and Trade Minister Cohen said he considers Intel a good
corporate citizen, but notes that he talks to companies all the
time that want to come here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is one of the advanced economies all over the world,''
he said. ``We do not need one project to change Israel.''

 &HT;    Found it in `The Movies': Seminal `2001'
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ The first four volumes of Modern Library's
``The Movies'' have appeared. Three of them are reprints: ``Agee on
Film,'' by the best movie critic who ever lived (yes, better than
Pauline Kael, because Agee had better taste; you never caught him
writing panegyrics to the 1948 equivalent of Brian De Palma); Rudy
Behlmer's ``Memo From David O. Selznick,'' a truly invaluable
volume that gives us access to one of the few men able to hold the
entire equation of motion pictures in his head; and Vachel
Lindsay's very early (1915) and very interesting ``The Art of the
Moving Picture.''
</P>
<P>
   The Agee and the Behlmer were in print for years before falling
out comparatively recently, and are not hard to find in used book
shops. The Lindsay was last in print nearly 30 years ago, so it is
a most welcome addition.
</P>
<P>
   But the most interesting book is ``The Making of 2001: A Space
Odyssey.'' Initially, I thought it was another reprint, of a book
edited by Jerome Agel that came out when Kubrick's film did.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a new compilation that reprints a few things from
Agel's book and adds a lot of new material about one of the seminal
movies of the last half century. Kubrick's friend Alexander Walker
contributes a piece, as does critic Jay Cocks, who spent a lot of
time with Kubrick as the film was nearing release.
</P>
<P>
   The piece I found most interesting was an interview Kubrick did
with the ``Village Voice'' when the film opened: ``There is a
distant relationship between chess and making a film,'' says
Kubrick. ``With chess you have to explore different lines of play,
and think of different possible outcomes. In films you're always
juggling more than you can ever think about at one time, and trying
to analyze as many moves as deeply into the consequences as you
can. Films are a peculiar combination of the worst circumstances
imaginable for an artist to work in, and the most powerful art form
ever devised. And finding the resultant of those forces is the key
to getting the film done.''
</P>
<P>
   The older books have all been reset and cost between $14.95 and
$16.95. The series, edited by Martin Scorsese, is off to an
auspicious start.

 &HT;    Novelist paints features onto slate-gray spy
 &HT;    By Tom Blackburn
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Harry Gold's name is a nuclear blast from the
national past. He was one of the ``atom spies,'' always identified
in news accounts as a ``chemist,'' who never got close to a
military secret in his job. He was the conduit, the courier, the
guy who picked up and delivered for a real atomic physicist, Klaus
Fuchs, and the Soviet KGB.
</P>
<P>
   Millicent Dillon, an established biographer (of Jane Bowles,
Isadora Duncan and others) was attracted to him as a subject. But
there's hardly anything documented about Gold, and he said little
about himself. He was as reflective as a black boot in a coal mine.
So scratch the biography?
</P>
<P>
   No. Dillon turned it into a novel, improvising freely on the
scant record. And here's the pleasant surprise: ``Harry Gold''
works both as an affecting novel and as a portrait of at least one
secret agent.
</P>
<P>
   Gold didn't do it for ideology. He never joined the Communist
Party. He didn't do it for money. He didn't get any. He was once
shown a Soviet medal and was told it was his. But he couldn't keep
it. It would have been too dangerous.
</P>
<P>
   So why did he do it? To answer that question, Dillon has to
breathe life into an airless and boring existence. Raised in
Philadelphia by refugees from czarist Russia, Harry was a bookish
loner. But he was dutiful and methodical, which later would make
him an ideal steward of chemical experiments that require time,
method and patience.
</P>
<P>
   The Golds were never well-off, and the Depression made things
worse. Harry dropped out of school to support his family. When he
was laid off from his job, a friend of a friend found him another.
The friend's friend was a communist.
</P>
<P>
   The benefactor asked Harry for a favor. Harry, who never said no
to anyone, could hardly say no to the man who had saved his family.
Step by step, he was drawn into being a courier for Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   As Dillon sees him, Harry knew he was being used but didn't
mind. High politics didn't interest him. The hapless, helpless
Philadelphia Phillies were his main outside interest, but he spent
most of his days and nights in the lab, doing consumer chemistry.
He simply liked feeling useful.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Harry, imagined by Dillon, at the time when he was
nearing what would become the high point of his later notoriety:''
As he gets off the train in New York, he slips easily into being
one of a crowd, unseen. He does not delude himself that he is a
special kind of man. Klaus _ now there is someone different. But he
himself is ordinary, one of many. Yet by some strange chance he has
been chosen for a destiny, not at all ordinary. With Klaus he is
caught up in the forces of history, at a critical juncture of life
and matter.''
</P>
<P>
   Contrast that public appearance with the last picture of the
bomb-planting protagonist of Joseph Conrad's ``The Secret Agent'' :
``And the incorruptible Professor walked, too, averting his eyes
from the odious multitude of mankind. He had no future. He
disdained it. He was a force. His thoughts caressed the images of
ruin and destruction.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the difference between doing or being done-to. When Hannah
Arendt coined the phrase ``the banality of evil,'' she had in mind
Adolf Eichmann, the organizer of the Nazis' ``final solution.'' But
Eichmann was a skilled bureaucrat and a true believer. Gold, in his
spy role, was neither, merely a trained mule, but one who delivered
information that materially sped up Russia's attainment of the
atomic bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Near the end of her novel, Dillon does a daring thing. She
weaves into the story the most detailed part of the recorded
factual record she had to work from. The reader can compare it to
the rest of the novel to see how she did. The factual material
seems to flow from the novel, instead of the other way around. So
one could say she did very well.

 &HT;    ``Pure Poetry'' offers up an enjoyable rant and rave
 &HT;    By Scott Eyman
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Lila Moscowitz is the only poet of her
generation who's been featured in People magazine. Her poem, ``At
the Baby Doll Lounge Salome Dances;'' ``The Baptist Tips Her a Ten
Spot,'' gave her a brief flurry of renown as the Camille Paglia of
pentameter, but it's been a struggle ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Lila is a born-again Jew, whose father changed the family name
to Morse, only to have her change it back to Moscowitz. She's had
an unfinished book of poems on her desk for three years. If only
she didn't have to teach for a living, she tells herself, she'd
have the time to complete it.
</P>
<P>
   She likes to think that the problem might be a lingering tsuris
over a disastrous marriage to a relative of Albert Speer's.
Contributing factors might be her therapist, who is a
cross-dresser, or her at-sword's-points relationship with her
family _ because one sister-in-law is named Regan, she insists on
referring to the other sister-in-law as Goneril.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't like her brothers any better than their wives: ``If
modern medicine could reattach the foreskin the way they are now
able to stitch back an arm severed at the elbow, my brothers would
go for the procedure in a skinny minute.''
</P>
<P>
   The Moscowitz tribe has an . . . ambivalent attitude toward
Lila, as is indicated by their neglecting to inform her that her
mother had died.
</P>
<P>
   Did I mention the ghosts? Lila lives with a couple of ghosts,
great-aunts who didn't like her mother any better than she did.
</P>
<P>
   Lila is the sort of brilliant, sexual, funny woman that
self-destructive men oblivious to hostility often fall in love
with. (The male equivalent is the narcissism that manifests itself
as either manic controlling or infantile selfishness.)
</P>
<P>
   Binnie Kirshenbaum's ``Pure Poetry'' works better as character
study than it does as narrative, mainly because there really isn't
any narrative. Lila narrates the story, so we're deep inside her
version of people and events, which is not to say you can't hear
alarm bells in the distance.
</P>
<P>
   For all of her anti-Teutonic rants, she did marry Max, who,
other than an unfortunately anal disposition _ not only is he
German, he's a cartographer _ doesn't seem all that bad.
</P>
<P>
   What gradually becomes apparent over the novel's duration is
that Lila is the classic unreliable narrator, is, in fact,
something of a wack job, albeit a highly engaging one with a
fabulous voice, a distaff Jerry Lewis:
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel about children as I do about dogs. They deserve to have
a warm bed in which to sleep. They have an inalienable right to be
fed tasty and nutritious meals. I want for each of them to have a
chew toy of their own, and it's best for all concerned if they
attend obedience school. Children and dogs deserve to be loved, but
not by me.''
</P>
<P>
   Lila is the female equivalent of one of Philip Roth's Jewish
misanthropes, dragging their rage around as if it were an
overloaded dog sled.
</P>
<P>
   Which is to say she's frequently hilarious company in a novel,
but she would compel you to quietly move to the other side of the
living room were you to encounter her at a party, or eat your gun
were you to marry her.
</P>
<P>
   Notwithstanding that, ``Pure Poetry'' is an exceedingly
enjoyable rant by a severely damaged character until a
disappointingly conventional ending _ let's just say that
enlightenment for characters who have spent their lives being
impossible occurs much more frequently in fiction than it does in
real life.

 &HT;    An e-mail list full of questions
 &HT;    By Gary Borders
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   NACOGDOCHES, Tx _ I'm on an e-mailing list of a group of friends
who love to chat electronically. Most every day, I get a batch of
messages from this group, which is scattered from Austin to Houston
to Seattle and points in between. They argue philosophy, the
virtues of Macintosh computers vs. IBM-compatible machines, tell
bad jokes, submit poetry and anything else that might amuse or
provoke discussion.
</P>
<P>
   I don't contribute much to the discussion, mainly because I
spend so much time in front of a computer that it's hard to
willingly sit in front of one for grins. But I enjoy reading the
messages, and e-mailing is a great and inexpensive way to keep in
touch with this group of college and high school buddies.
</P>
<P>
   One of the participants sent out the other day a list of
questions to which he wanted answers. He's an attorney, so he's
good at asking questions to which there are no answers. I suspect
somebody is getting billed somewhere for the time he spent
composing this e-mail contribution. Here it is:
</P>
<P>
   _ After eating, do amphibians have to wait one hour before
getting out of the water?
</P>
<P>
   _ How can there be self-help ''groups''?
</P>
<P>
   _ If white wine goes with fish, do white grapes go with sushi?
</P>
<P>
   _ If someone with multiple personalities threatens to kill
himself, is it considered a hostage situation?
</P>
<P>
   _ If instead of talking to your plants you yelled at them, would
they still grow, only to be troubled and insecure?
</P>
<P>
   _ Is there another word for ''synonym''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Isn't it a bit unnerving that doctors call what they do
''practice''? (So do attorneys, I might add.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Just before someone gets nervous, do they experience cocoons
in their stomach?
</P>
<P>
   _ When sign makers go on strike, is anything written on their
picket signs?
</P>
<P>
   _ When you open a new bag of cotton balls, is the top one meant
to be thrown away?
</P>
<P>
   _ When your pet bird sees you reading the newspaper, does he
wonder why you're just sitting there looking at carpeting?
</P>
<P>
   _ Where do forest rangers go to ''get away from it all''?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why isn't there mouse-flavored cat food?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why do they report power outages on TV?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why are builders afraid to have a 13th floor, but book
publishers aren't afraid to have a Chapter 11?
</P>
<P>
   I have a few questions of my own, compiled over the years.
</P>
<P>
   _ How can you tell when sour cream goes bad?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why do the instructions on shampoo bottles urge you to
''lather, rinse and repeat''? Why isn't once enough?
</P>
<P>
   _ Why do businesses always qualify ''No Dogs Allowed'' signs by
adding a line that says ''Except for Seeing-Eye Dogs''? Seems like
if you're blind, you can't read the sign anyway. Maybe the dog can.
</P>
<P>
   If you have any answers, or better yet, if you have some more
questions, drop me a line. You can even e-mail me if that type of
thing floats your boat.

 &HT;    Checking the winds on gun control
 &HT;    By Dave McNeely
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Sometimes the weight on a political seesaw
shifts very gradually. But once public opinion shifts solidly in
one direction, it accelerates.
</P>
<P>
   In the 2000 election, gun control may be such an issue. The
presumptive Republican nominee, Texas Gov. George W. Bush, has
mostly opposed more controls on guns. He is taking campaign heat
for, among other things, having signed in 1995 a bill allowing
licensed Texans to pack pistols.
</P>
<P>
   His predecessor, Democrat Ann Richards, in 1993 vetoed a bill to
allow a non-binding referendum on the issue. Some think that veto,
and the reaction of the gun lobby and gun owners, contributed
heavily to her loss to Bush in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   More than half a decade later, Bush is running nationally, not
just in gun-friendly Texas. And after a series of school and church
massacres involving guns and a Million Mom March on Mother's Day
pushing for stricter gun control, things are different.
</P>
<P>
   Or they may be. Politically, the question is whether supporting
stricter regulation of guns is more popular than sticking with the
National Rifle Association and others who contend their right to
keep handguns is protected by the Second Amendment to the U.S.
Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   As with many hot issues, Bush has moved toward his opposition.
His Democratic opponent, Vice President Al Gore, is calling for
having gun manufacturers put trigger locks on handguns. Bush
responded by setting up a Texas program, the ChildSafe Project, to
offer free trigger locks for gun owners who want one.
</P>
<P>
   (Texas taxpayers will pay for the $10 locks, which will be
distributed through police and fire departments and other agencies,
Bush says. He'll earmark $1 million a year for five years from the
governor's Criminal Justice Planning Fund to do it, says press aide
Mike Jones. If elected president, Bush says he'll ask for $75
million a year for five years for a national distribution program.)
</P>
<P>
   Bush acknowledged it was no coincidence he announced the program
two days before the Million Mom March. ``As a matter of fact, it's
timed that way,'' Bush said on NBC's ``Today'' show, noting that
gun safety is getting a lot of attention.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has signed legislation blocking cities from suing
manufacturers for damages from gun violence and refused to back a
Texas bill to require instant background checks at gun shows
because he said it required national rather than state attention,
He also has called for stricter enforcement of existing gun laws.
</P>
<P>
   And indeed, while national polls indicate a majority of
Americans want more gun regulation, it ranks midway down the scale
of their concerns.
</P>
<P>
   In some polls, more people favor stiffer enforcement of existing
laws than passing new ones _ which echoes Bush's stance. And while
Democrats polled strongly tend to favor stricter control,
Republicans tend just as strongly not to.
</P>
<P>
   While Bush is responding somewhat to those seeking more gun
safety, he doesn't hesitate to charge that Gore's position on gun
control has shifted during his political career.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's staffers show an NRA analysis that says Gore voted with
them three-fourths of the time from 1985 to 1990, when he was a
senator from Tennessee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it was convenient politically, he voted one way and when
it was convenient politically, he changed his tune,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore acknowledges he often voted with the NRA during his
early years in Congress, he says he changed after seeing ``the
flood of cheap handguns and the wave of gun violence sweep across
our country.'' Gore aide Doug Hattaway says Gore ``is standing up
to the NRA and its extreme agenda, while George Bush is carrying
their ammo bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Strong words _ which Bush strongly disputes. Even though an
independent gun control group has been running ads featuring a
videotape of NRA first vice president Kayne Robinson saying if Bush
is elected, ``We'll have a president . . . where we work out of
their office,'' Bush says he's never belonged to the NRA and will
call his own shots in the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   And so it heads for November. The questions: Do those who want
more gun control finally outnumber politically those who don't? Do
they feel strongly enough to let that determine their vote? And
either way, how much will that affect the election? Too soon to
know.

   COXNET BOOKS 0523 -- In Hamilton Jordan's new book, ``No Such
Thing as a Bad Day,'' the architect of Jimmy Carter's improbable

fade to irrelevance and how one's sense of proportion can change
between his 30s and his 50s. (Skube, Atlanta Journal-Constitution)

 &HT;    COMMENTARY: No refuge for freedom fighters
 &HT;    By Mahnaz Samadi
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We had just returned from my aunt's one night when the
Revolutionary Guards burst into our home in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Shoving my little sister and me up against the wall, they
threatened to execute us right there. My mother and 11-year-old
brother were crying. The guards searched every corner of our house,
looking for evidence that we were cooperating with the Mojahedin
opposition, which seeks the overthrow of Iran's Islamic government.
</P>
<P>
   All the while, the guards were shouting and swearing,
threatening to kill us all if we did not cooperate. Finally, we
were dragged outside and driven to Evin Political Prison, where the
horrors never cease. I was 17.
</P>
<P>
   They never did find the evidence, but I spent the next four
years of my life in that jail. They kept my little sister for 10
years. Two of my brothers were executed, and my parents died of
broken hearts.
</P>
<P>
   Now, once again, I am locked up, not in Iran, but in the United
States of America, where I took refuge from the mullahs and was
granted political asylum in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   I call out to you for justice, from my cell in a rural Alabama
prison. I call out to you as a woman who has been tortured and
humiliated by the forces of darkness. I call out to you as someone
who, despite it all, never, not even for a minute, regretted taking
the path of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   Is it a coincidence that after six years of living in this
country, I find myself in a cell just when the U.S. government is
seeking to improve relations with the terrorist rulers of Iran? Or
am I a pawn in a political game?
</P>
<P>
   The Immigration and Naturalization Service has charged me with
trying to ``liberate Iran.'' The INS intends to terminate my
asylum, and deport me to Iran, where I will certainly suffer more
torture and would be executed.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is my affiliation with the Iranian opposition movement
before I came to the United States. The U.S. State Department has
classified the Mojahedin as a terrorist group.
</P>
<P>
   If the INS considers it a crime to strive for freedom, I freely
admit my guilt. I am proud to have done whatever I could to
liberate my country and my people.
</P>
<P>
   I will continue to strive to free the women of Iran, who are
denied their most rudimentary rights and considered not as
second-class citizens, but as subhuman. That is a grouping I
experienced firsthand, as a woman political prisoner in Iran.
</P>
<P>
   The events of the past six weeks have brought back many memories
of that horrific ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   On April 3, I was arrested by INS agents on my return from
Canada. I was not allowed to speak to my lawyer, who was at the
border. I was secreted away to an unknown location.
</P>
<P>
   Several hours later, I found myself in Buffalo, N.Y. Since then,
I have been transferred from one jail to another: Decatur and south
Fulton County in metro Atlanta, and finally to Gadsden, Ala.
</P>
<P>
   I have been subjected to all kinds of humiliation,
strip-searched following a visit from my attorney, shackled during
the transfer between jails, taunted by guards as a ``terrorist,''
and then locked up in a crowded cell.
</P>
<P>
   At Evin Prison in Tehran, the cells were so crowded we had to
take turns sleeping. As I was tortured, abused and assaulted, the
guards laughed and taunted me, telling me that justice had been
done. I could not fight back, so my cry for justice became my
resistance against tortures I never thought I could bear.
</P>
<P>
   And now I find myself crying out for justice in this country,
where freedom of political belief is supposed to be sacred. I
thought I had found shelter, but I find instead that I have been
betrayed.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past weeks, my only source of encouragement has been
the support I have received from you, the American people, from
scores of your representatives in Congress, from women's and human
rights organizations, and the Iranian-American community. And so it
is to you that I cry out for justice.
</P>
<P>
   The INS and those who would sacrifice me to their political
agenda have closed their ears to my cry, but perhaps they will
listen to you, and honor the principles upon which this country was
founded. In all fairness, is that too much to ask?
</P>
<P>
   Mahnaz Samadi is an inmate at the Etowah County Jail in Gadsden,
Ala. The INS is seeking to deport her, alleging that in her
application for asylum, she failed to acknowledge her prior
membership in the Iranian opposition movement.

WASSERSTEIN TURNS REAL LIFE INTO INTRIGUING MOVIE

 Includes black-and-white photos and color slides of Christine Lahti
(alone and with Tom Skerritt) in scenes from ``American
Daughter.'' 
 By IVOR DAVIS   
 c.2000 Ivor Davis  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stage plays that actually improve when transposed to television
are rarer than ethics in a political campaign _ which makes ``An
American Daughter,'' airing June 5 on Lifetime, a particular
pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   The subject of Wendy Wasserstein's original play _ and now TV
movie _ couldn't be more topical. The real life resonances ring so
true that when you watch it you keep hearing snatches from recent
history's political discourse.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Lahti (``Chicago Hope'') plays Lyssa Dent Hughes, a
prominent physician and head of a cancer hospital. She is also
daughter of a Republican senator, a fifth generation descendant of
Ulysses S. Grant, wife of a prominent sociology professor and, last
but not least, a concerned and caring mother.
</P>
<P>
   Through a combination of hard work, brilliance and genuine
concern for the nation's health, she has reached the absolute
pinnacle of her profession. So it seems only fitting that the
president should nominate her for the surgeon general's job.
</P>
<P>
   It should be a slam dunk until the manipulative host of a TV
news magazine _ one Timber Tucker (Jay Thomas), shooting a
behind-the-scenes profile of the candidate at a family brunch in
her home, takes a piece of carelessly revealed information _ that
the busy Dent Hughes once neglected to respond to a jury summons _
and blows it up until it becomes a campaign ``issue.''
</P>
<P>
   Hughes' nomination is now fodder for the TV mill. She compounds
her original misdemeanor in a public relations disaster by making a
slighting reference to her late mother's famous icebox cakes, and
stands accused of elitism by soccer moms across America.
</P>
<P>
   In the final denouement, groomed and dressed by political
consultants for mass acceptance, wearing a Hillary-like headband
and with her father by her side, she submits to a televised
in-depth interview by Tucker. He promises to help salvage her
political career and instead subjects her to a final horrible
attack.
</P>
<P>
   Will Lyssa play media games to salvage her career or decide that
ultimately she cannot be someone she is not, even for the job that
her entire life has been preparing her for?
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons I wrote this play,'' explains playwright
Wendy Wasserstein, ``was because I was taken by the `Hillary
Clinton in a headband' interview on `60 Minutes.' She had
previously said she was not someone who was going to bake cookies,
and then she was retracting it in this interview. I thought `God
it's so hard to be a woman. You have to suddenly change who you
are.'''
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to shows like NBC's sharply penned ``The West Wing'' _
and well-documented attempts by the Clinton administration to name
women to high political posts suffering death by media _ this story
is familiar territory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It also sprang from my interest in what happened to Zoe Baird,
President Clinton's first nominee for attorney general,''
Wasserstein says. ``It was thought to be a good idea and then this
information came out about her nanny. There were hearings and that
was the end of Zoe Baird. Then came Kimba Wood and Lani Guinier. I
was interested in what happens to the best and the brightest people
in this country and why they don't go into public office. Why would
you put yourself and your family through this?''
</P>
<P>
   Wasserstein's screenplay makes clear that Lyssa Dent Hughes
would be a superb surgeon general because she believes in service,
she is smart, dedicated, honest and hardworking, but she has one
overriding problem: Her brand of intelligence doesn't work on TV.
And when she's attacked she naively believes honesty is the best
policy.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's more important,'' Wasserstein asks, ``that these people
are good at public relations or that they're good at their jobs? Do
you want the person who's going to be surgeon general to come on
television and be charming or would you rather have a good health
care system? I'd rather have the health care.''
</P>
<P>
   Wasserstein's movie states the obvious: Women in public life are
subject to different rules than men, especially in the media.
They've got to have something called likeability and they must not
commit the cardinal sin of appearing smarter than the average
person.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at the U.S. Senate race for New York,'' Wasserstein
notes, ``Women have specific opinions about Hillary Clinton. What's
interesting is they have very strong opinions about someone they
don't know. So you're dealing with people who should excel at their
jobs, be able to win a beauty contest, then be professional,
competent and a wonderful hostess. Who can do that?
</P>
<P>
   ``Lyssa Dent Hughes is a good, serious person. Is she
immediately likeable? Would you meet this girl and say, `Gee I wish
she was hosting my talk show? She really should take over from
Kathie Lee.' Do you really want a surgeon general who could take
over from Kathie Lee?''
</P>
<P>
   Two interesting sub plots _ illustrating the ways two different
kinds of women view success _ frame Lyssa's story. Her marriage is
in jeopardy from one of them. Quincy Quince (Blake Lindsley) is
Lyssa's husband's most promising student. She is also a wannabe
pundit _ (sort of Arianna Huffington crossed with Camille Paglia)
who uses Lyssa's difficulties to seduce her husband (``Picket
Fence's'' Tom Skerritt) and launch her own TV career.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's another woman of achievement, Lyssa's best friend
Judith Kaufman, played by the wonderful Lynn Thigpen (``Law and
Order''), who won a Tony for the same role on Broadway as a black,
Jewish oncologist whose difficulty having children almost drives
her to suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Lyssa is appalled: ``What gives you the audacity to believe
you've failed if you can't make life or stop death?'' she demands
of Judith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because I was taught if I was a good girl and worked hard, I
could,'' Judith answers.
</P>
<P>
   Wasserstein says that is the crux of her story.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a story about the good girls who worked hard and what
happens when you come up against something where working hard and
being a good girl isn't enough.''

 INSIDE TREK &AMP; SCI-FI 
 CARTER REVEALS NEW IDEAS FOR ``X-FILES'' NEXT SEASON 
</HEADLINE>

 (FOR RELEASE AS OF MON., JUNE 5, 2000) 
 (Includes a color photo of Chris Carter, the executive producer of
``The X-Files.'') 
 By IAN SPELLING  
 c.2000 Ian Spelling  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features.)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After weeks of intense intrigue and even fading hopes, Fox
finally announced that ``The X-Files'' will return for an eighth
season in the fall. And so, too, will series creator Chris Carter
and stars Gillian Anderson and David Duchovny. However, Duchovny
signed on for only 11 episodes, or half a season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know `The X-Files' is a show that still has plenty of
mileage left on it,'' Carter says by telephone from his production
office in Los Angeles. ``There are lots of stories to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you don't want to do is go forward with people who are
uninterested in doing the work. I wanted to make sure that, if we
went forward, everybody was excited about continuing to do good
work, that it wasn't just a payday and a trip to the bank.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter and company were prepared, albeit reluctantly, to carry
on without Duchovny. The actor's compromise deal _ which also
settles his acrimonious lawsuit with Fox over syndication revenues
_ creates both challenges and opportunities.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it will certainly throw an emphasis on Scully,''
Carter says, referring to Anderson's character. ``I think we'll get
to explore the paranormal in a way we haven't before. I think you
got a hint of that in Gillian's episode, `All Things' (which she
wrote and directed).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're going to look at mythological and perhaps
fantasy and magic realism in ways we hadn't really explored before.
There are other areas I think the show can expand into
beautifully.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as he was fighting for the future of ``The X-Files,''
Carter was looking to its past _ literally. Carter spent a great
deal of time readying all 24 first-season episodes of ``The
X-Files'' for release on DVD.
</P>
<P>
   Just now in stores from 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment,
``The X-Files'' Season One DVD Gift Pack sells for $149.98 and
features seven disks that serve up the series pilot and all
subsequent freshman year episodes, as well as Carter interviews,
episode teasers, ``Behind the Truth'' segments, deleted footage and
an 11-minute documentary dubbed ``The Truth About Season One.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been such sticklers for quality and the thing I'm happy
about is that the effort and the attention to detail are now
rewarded because we've got a format that lets us really showcase
all that hard work,'' Carter says. ``Our philosophy was, `We're
making a little movie each week.'''
</P>
<P>
   Carter describes screening the old episodes again as a ``walk
down Memory Lane.'' As for the best stops along the way, he picks
``Beyond the Sea,'' ``Deep Throat,'' ``The Erlenmeyer Flask,''
``Squeeze,'' ``Darkness Falls'' and ``Miracle Man.''
</P>
<P>
   Two other top-notch episodes from the first season are
``Tooms,'' a classic creepfest that introduced Skinner (Mitch
Pileggi), and ``E.B.E.,'' a conspiracy episode that marked the
arrival of that intrepid trio of paranoids, the Lone Gunmen (Tom
Braidwood, Bruce Hardwood and Dean Haglund). Come the fall, Carter
and Fox will unleash the boys in their very own spin-off series
entitled _ what else? _ ``The Lone Gunmen,'' with the pilot
directed by ``X-Files'' veteran Rob Bowman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had done episodes devoted to them and they were all
successful,'' Carter says. ``They were fun to do. This was a chance
to take our enthusiasm and turn it into another storytelling
vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be very different from `The X-Files.' It
will be kooky and fun. It's a chance to develop (the characters of)
three completely unlikely heroes who are kind of postmodern nerds.
Something I think people are very familiar with now, in this age of
technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Carter intends to be ``super-involved'' in the day-to-day
production of ``The Lone Gunmen,'' which will film in Vancouver,
British Columbia, while also overseeing ``The X-Files'' in Los
Angeles and prepping the script for ``The World of Ted Serios,'' a
film he'll direct.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, admits Carter _ who also pulled double and triple
duty in recent years by guiding ``The X-Files'' feature and the
quickly axed series ``Harsh Realm'' _ he wishes there were two of
him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tease people that I'm like a chicken,'' he says, laughing.
``There's no part of me they don't use.''  &QL;

FEAR OF DROWNING LEADS TO DOUBLE ENGAGEMENT

 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh man. Oh come on. That's really not fair.
</P>
<P>
   How could these women do that to those guys, making them agree
to marriage when their lives were in danger! Talk about
manipulative.
</P>
<P>
   Two couples got engaged April 20th _ but it wasn't one of those
deals involving rings dropped in champagne glasses or guys dropping
to their knees or a surprise message showing up on a baseball
scoreboard.
</P>
<P>
   It was fear of drowning that set up this double engagement.
</P>
<P>
   The scene: Bryan Henegar and five friends were bobbing in the
Gulf of Mexico, about 14 miles offshore, after Henegar's boat sank.
For 11 hours, they fought off hypothermia and fatigue.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to die tonight, aren't I?'' said Mary Jane Grau,
Henegar's girlfriend.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not going to die tonight!'' proclaimed Henegar, just
like Leonardo DiCaprio's Jack said in ``Titanic.''
</P>
<P>
   But Grau played a card that even Rose didn't try with Jack in
that most romantic of movies, saying, ``If I don't die tonight,
we're going to get married.''
</P>
<P>
   I would have tried to change the subject. Something like, ``Boy,
that little Elian really was a tough cookie to survive in this
stuff, you know?''
</P>
<P>
   Henegar's a better man than I am. He may have been literally
treading water but he stopped treading water, relationship-wise.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK!'' he said. ``When we get out, we'll get married.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, like Jerry Seinfeld getting engaged because George
Costanza got engaged, Henegar's buddy Bill Daughtery made the same
pledge to his girlfriend: ``You know what, Kathy? I'll marry you.
We're all going to get married.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course they were rescued a few hours later. The caption in
the Chicago Sun-Times under a picture of Grau and Henegar: ``Mary
Jane Grau is comforted by fiance Bryan Henegar at a Florida Coast
Guard Station ...''
</P>
<P>
   See that dude, now you're labeled. Now you're a fiance.
</P>
<P>
   A double wedding ceremony is planned for Labor Day weekend and I
wish everyone the best, but can you imagine the scene if things
don't work out down the line?
</P>
<P>
   Grau: ``I wish I never married you in the first place, you
jerk!''
</P>
<P>
   Henegar: ``Well whose idea was it to get engaged? I'm clinging
to a freakin' life preserver and you're talking commitment!''
</P>
<P>
   Grau: ``You didn't have to say yes!''
</P>
<P>
   Henegar: ``I thought I was going to DIE. Who knew?''
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic engagement does not guarantee wedded bliss. Not
that I have any expertise in this area other than two decades of
spectating, but I'm more partial to what I've always called the
Chicago Irish Guy Wedding Proposal, though the scenario translates
to many other ethnic and cultural backgrounds. It goes something
like this:
</P>
<P>
   Guy meets gal in neighborhood hood pub, a few months after
they've both graduated college. They start dating.
</P>
<P>
   He lives with four buddies, who really don't care if their pal
has a girlfriend, as long as he can still play on the softball,
rugby and flag football teams. And show up for darts on Thurdays at
McHiccupy's.
</P>
<P>
   She has a roommate who doesn't like him. He doesn't care for the
roommate, often making insulting jokes about the fact that she's a
volleyball coach who doesn't shave her legs and listens to Melissa
Etheridge all the time.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the romance blooms. Flowers and dinners and kisses
and hand-holding and happy attendance at family functions.
</P>
<P>
   After that the relationship settles into a comfortable groove.
Bathroom doors are left open and Blockbuster nights outnumber
dinner dates at places with names like Trattoria Expensiva, and
when she asks if he'd like to attend a Mother's Day brunch at 10
a.m., he laughs and says, ``Did you just forget about the Mark
O'Meara putting special on ESPN-26? Like I'm going to miss that.''
</P>
<P>
   His buddies ride him about missing the annual Western Avenue Pub
Crawl. Her roommate asks if he could please not put his feet on the
coffee table.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of year two, she asks how long they're going to
continue as boyfriend and girlfriend. He says, ``Um, six to nine
years?''
</P>
<P>
   Wrong answer. Breakup time.
</P>
<P>
   Her roommate rejoices. His buddies say stuff like, ``You're not
seeing what's-her-name any more? Great, the Bears are home Sunday
and we've got an extra ticket.''
</P>
<P>
   About six months later, he's at McHiccupy's when she walks in
with a date _ a nice lawyer with a BMW parked outside.
</P>
<P>
   He makes a scene. She storms off. He calls her 57 times. After
much drama and lots of crying _ mostly on his part _ they reunite.
</P>
<P>
   A year goes by. And then one morning, after, well, you know, she
says: ``Hope you enjoyed that, buster, because it's the last time
we're doing it unless we get engaged.''
</P>
<P>
   He considers his options and says, says, ``OK, OK, pick out a
ring.''
</P>
<P>
   And that's the right way to get engaged.

   FLY-FISHING (Albany, N.Y.) _ Even for the most experienced
dry-fly fisherman, the timer starts ticking and the Adrenalin kicks
in when the hatch materializes. The angler has little time to
determine which mayfly or caddis fly it is that's rising; more
importantly, which is particularly interesting to those dimpling
trout. The strategy has to be settled, and fast. At which phase of
the mayfly's well-known cycle will the fisherman attempt to imitate
the natural? On the bottom, under the surface, on the surface, or
falling from the sky after mating? Each phase has its own patterns
of artificial imitations of fur and feathers, threads and snippets.

rages from left to right. One side marches on Washington. The other

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dear Bob: I recently purchased a 1996 Buick Roadmaster station
wagon. A month after I bought it, I saw an article in Consumer
Reports' April 2000 issue that lists the 1996 Buick Roadmaster as
one of its ``Used Cars To Avoid.'' Just my luck.
</P>
<P>
   Since I bought it, maybe you can tell me what I should be
concerned about. Thank you. I.H. Conroy, Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   A. Well, if you had looked a little further in that same issue
you'd have come across its ``Used-Car Reliability'' section, which
features Frequency-of-Repair charts. According to Consumer Reports,
the 1996 Roadmaster shows above average repairs on its cooling and
electrical systems and above average problems with its hardware
(door handles, knobs etc.)
</P>
<P>
   However its engine, exhaust and body rust ratings are tops,
followed closely by a good rating for its A/C system. It rates
average in fuel, ignition, transmission, suspension, brakes,
paint/trim and integrity categories.
</P>
<P>
   So its overall rating may not be as bad as it seems. Remember
the ``Used Cars To Avoid'' list is compiled from reader responses
to Consumer Reports' 1999 Annual Questionnaire, the same source
that the Frequency-of-Repair data was taken from. While these lists
can be helpful when you're in the market for a used car, they are
not the opinion of experts nor are they infallible.
</P>
<P>
   Let me put it this way: I have driven a vehicle that was and
still is rated poor by Consumer Reports. Turns out that it's one of
the most trouble-free, dependable vehicles I have ever owned.
Bottom line, keep an eye on the areas that are singled out as
problem areas, otherwise, just enjoy your Buick.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Bob: I own a 1985 Chevy that has 50,000 miles on it. My
problem is a whining sound that is more pronounced in colder
weather. The whining is also much louder when I turn the steering
wheel.
</P>
<P>
   I have been told that it has nothing to do with the power
steering. Steve Sciani, East Rockaway, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   A. On the contrary, my friend, it IS the power steering unit
that is doing all the whining. GM has had problems with the power
steering units on early and mid-'80s vehicles and has even issued a
recall on many of them to have the problem fixed.
</P>
<P>
   Your vehicle's symptoms are classic: whining, exacerbated by
cold weather and increasing when the power steering unit is put to
work (that is, when the steering wheel is turned). Check with your
GM dealer to see if you can still have your vehice repaired under
the conditions of the original recall.
</P>
<P>
   Dear Bob: I've heard so many conflicting stories on what an
oxygen sensor does. I've even heard that it isn't really necessary
and one can disconnect it and still get good performance from a
vehicle. Can you please give me the real dope on oxygen sensors?
Wayne Pratt, Longview, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   A. An oxygen sensor is a feedback sensor usually located at some
point in the exhaust manifold or exhaust pipe. It continuously
samples the amount of oxygen (that's why it's called an oxygen or
O2 sensor!) in the exhaust stream. Its job is to relay timely
(microsecond to microsecond) information to the engine control
module (computer) about the condition of the air/fuel ratio being
supplied to the engine. On receipt of this information the engine's
computer makes adjustments of the air/fuel ratio to keep it at
maximum efficiency.
</P>
<P>
   Because the engine depends on the O2 sensor's feedback for the
most efficient air/fuel setting, it is vital to the car's overall
performance, efficiency and emissions control. Without it,
emissions would soar, fuel economy would drop and engine
performance would be reduced. Disconnecting the O2 sensor is like
messing with the air supply of a deep sea diver _ who may still be
able to operate, but at much lower efficiency than with a constant
supply of fresh air.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of On Board Diagnostics II, or OBDII, the most
up-to-date emissions control and engine management system, an
additional oxygen sensor has been added on the downstream side of
the catalytic converter. It monitors the efficiency of the
catalytic converter by comparing the amount of oxygen in the inlet
and exhaust sides of the converter. This information also is
relayed to the engine control module for further processing.
</P>
<P>
   Amazing stuff all of this, and to think we take it all for
granted. &QL;

LEARN THE ESSENTIALS BEFORE YOU AIM FOR A JOB AT MICROSOFT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ANDREA AHLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Do you want a job at Microsoft, the software giant in Seattle?
Even though the company might be broken up by the federal
government?
</P>
<P>
   If you answered ``yes'' to the above questions, then pick up a
copy of Rebecca Smith's new book, ``The Unofficial Guide to Getting
a Job at Microsoft'' (McGraw-Hill, 192 pages, $16.95).
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft gets about 12,000 resumes a month, with 70 percent
arriving electronically, so making yours stand out from the crowd
is difficult.
</P>
<P>
   But don't despair if you are not a computer programmer, because
Microsoft has hundreds of jobs _ in areas such as finance,
accounting and furniture design _ that are not directly related to
writing software coding, Smith wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has about 33,000 employees worldwide, but at any given
time there are between 1,000 to 2,000 unfilled positions.
</P>
<P>
   Although Smith gives some generic tips on how to submit a
top-notch resume, the strength of the book is its details about
Microsoft and what sort of workers it is looking for.
</P>
<P>
   Smith spends several chapters describing the ``culture of
Microsoft,'' clearly to help job seekers decide if Microsoft is the
right company for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact is, there is only one Microsoft,'' Smith writes.
``There is no other company on par with Microsoft in the world.
Joining the Microsoft culture is clearly not a task for the
uninformed or for those content with scoring less than 100 on a
scale of 0 to 100.''
</P>
<P>
   There is enough history about Microsoft to give readers a sense
of where the company came from and where it is headed with its new
mission to ``empower people through great software, anytime, any
place, on any device.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith discusses six core competencies that Microsoft believes
are essential for all job positions: passion for products and
technology; smarts; drive; ability to adapt to change; ability to
get the right things done; and ability to learn and apply new
knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The author lists top executives and describes business units
within Microsoft where a potential applicant may find a position.
She also provides brief summaries of the business divisions, such
as the Worldwide Enterprise Group, the Business Solutions Group and
the Education Customer Unit.
</P>
<P>
   But like any print book about Microsoft, ``The Unofficial
Guide'' is not up-to-date with the recent Microsoft news. It still
lists Bill Gates as chief executive, even though he gave the title
to Microsoft President Steve Ballmer in January.
</P>
<P>
   The book lists several Web sites where job seekers can find
positions posted and mailing addresses of Microsoft's regional
offices where resumes may be sent.
</P>
<P>
   Smith suggests updating education or training by enrolling in
Microsoft programs, including the Microsoft Sales Specialist
program or the Microsoft Certified Professional credential. The
author briefly discusses internships at Microsoft and how the
company uses contingent staffing.
</P>
<P>
   Smith spends a portion of the text on how to get through a
Microsoft interview, noting that there is no right or wrong answer
to most of the open-ended questions Microsoft poses, such as, ``How
do you test a toaster?''
</P>
<P>
   She lists the types of questions Microsoft asks by category and
how to possibly answer those types of questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real truth is, Microsoft is not looking for your ability
to memorize hundreds of answers to technical questions,'' Smith
wrote. ``Microsoft interviewers are there to see how smart you are,
what excites you, and how you solve problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith also discusses some of the company's employee compensation
plans, including its new ``Compensation 2000,'' which offers 65
percent higher compensation to employees than what other software
companies are offering.
</P>
<P>
   The book is a quick read, one time through, but will best serve
the Microsoft job seeker who reads it multiple times and takes
notes in relevant sections.
</P>
<P>
   Smith is direct and to the point in describing Microsoft,
offering up her book as a primer for getting hired at the No. 1
software company in the world.

&HT;     GUN CONTROL? WHAT ABOUT DRUNKEN-DRIVER CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Enough already.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it?
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it time to stop the killing?
</P>
<P>
   The debate rages from left to right. Gun control. The right to
bear arms. One side marches on Washington. The other side blitzes
the airwaves with ads. The networks, the newspapers, the news
magazines all feed on the frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   So much killing, killing and more killing. Senseless killing.
Somebody has to do something about it.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad the national dialogue is about the set of somethings.
But then, why let facts get in the way of a story that doesn't
further enough agendas?
</P>
<P>
   Malik Sealy _ Bronx native, one-time Mr. Basketball of New York,
former St. John's star, starting forward for the Minnesota
Timberwolves _ made the tragic transformation from
husband/father/teammate to cold statistic early Saturday morning.
He died just as surely and violently as if somebody had pointed a
gun in his face and pulled the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   Sealy was on his way home from a celebration of teammate Kevin
Garnett's 24th birthday when his 1993 Range Rover collided head-on
with a pickup truck. The driver of the pickup, 43-year-old
Souksangouane Phengsene, was going the wrong way on Highway 100 in
suburban Minneapolis at the time. The Minnesota State Patrol
arrested Phengsene in his hospital room Monday on charges of
criminal vehicular homicide.
</P>
<P>
   A rescue worker reported smelling alcohol on Phengsene at the
scene. Investigators have not yet received the results of blood
tests on Phengsene, who already has a 1997 conviction for drunken
driving. He paid a $500 fine and spent one year on probation and
...
</P>
<P>
   That's it. That's all. If convicted of vehicular homicide,
Phengsene would face a maximum penalty of 10 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   That's it. That's all.
</P>
<P>
   For abruptly ending the life of a 30-year-old man who had so
much going for him. Father of a 3-year-old son, Remi. Newlywed
husband to a former St. John's cheerleader. Popular, respected
teammate on an NBA playoff team. Businessman who had just opened a
recording studio, Baseline Records, in New York. Family man who
operated a tie-designing business with a brother and sister.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Sealy left St. John's, he was the school's No. 2
all-time scorer (behind Chris Mullin). Sealy drifted through three
NBA cities in six seasons before finding a comfortable niche in
Minnesota. He averaged 11.3 points this past season on a
career-high 47.6-percent shooting, helping the Timberwolves to a
franchise-best 50-32 record. The franchise player, Garnett, wore
No. 21 because he idolized Sealy from the St. John's days.
</P>
<P>
   The trip home from Garnett's birthday celebration ended at 4:07
a.m. The skid marks at the scene of the accident were so short,
investigators suspect neither driver had time to veer out of the
way. Sealy probably never knew what hit him.
</P>
<P>
   He died alone, at the scene. But he has way, way too much
company. There were 15,935 alcohol-related traffic fatalities in
1998. One out of every nine intoxicated drivers involved in those
fatal crashes had a prior conviction for driving while under the
influence of alcohol within the previous three years. The FBI
reports that in that same year, there were 14,088 murders. Of those
homicides, 9,143 involved firearms.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, the debate of the day is about gun control. What about
drunks-behind-the-wheel-of-a-car control?
</P>
<P>
   Only 23 states classify driving under the influence as a felony.
In some of those states, it takes as many as four DWI convictions
before the offender heads into felony territory. New York
classifies the second and subsequent offenses within 10 years as a
felony.
</P>
<P>
   Enough already.
</P>
<P>
   Isn't it? Isn't it time to do more to stop the killing?
</P>
<P>
   On Oct. 19, 1998, St. Louis Rams linebacker Leonard Little was
out on the town celebrating his 24th birthday. He slammed into a
car driven by a 47-year-old St. Louis woman, Susan Gutweiler,
leaving a husband without a wife and a 15-year-old son without a
mother. Little pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and
received a sentence of 90 days in jail, four years of probation and
1,000 hours of community service.
</P>
<P>
   That's not enough. Why, Little even played in the Super Bowl
this past January. It's long past time to start taking drunken
driving as seriously as it should be. Public service announcements
_ ``Friends don't let friends drive drunk'' _ aren't going to get
the job done.
</P>
<P>
   Anybody who climbs behind the wheel drunk is playing Russian
Roulette with the lives of others. Just because it's legal to
drink, and just because it's legal to drive, doesn't mean the laws
should nod and wink at anybody who drinks and drives at the same
time.
</P>
<P>
   Enough already. Isn't it? Isn't it time to quit getting caught
up in the wrong debate and do something to stop the killing? Isn't
it time to fight back against the DrunkDrivingDefense.com forces?
</P>
<P>
   Stop giving drunken drivers third and fourth chances. Treat the
combination of a drunk and a car as a lethal weapon, not an
accident. Revoke a license for 10 years on the first conviction for
driving drunk. Tack on a felony conviction _ and stiff prison
sentence _ to anybody caught trying to drive with a revoked
license.
</P>
<P>
   Get tough. Get serious. Either that, or learn to live with the
possibility of becoming a cold body and colder statistic.

&HT;     CALIFORNIA POLITICS SUFFERS A GREAT LOSS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     Commentary  
 &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ROB MORSE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's hard to think of a more appropriate tribute
to the life of John Jacobs than a moment of silence in the
California Legislature, a moment of silence called Wednesday
morning by a choked-up John Burton.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that Jacobs wrote the definitive book, ``A Rage
for Justice,'' on Burton's late brother, Rep. Phillip Burton, who
saved the landscape of the Bay Area and remade the political
landscape of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that Jacobs wrote the definitive piece, ``The
Making of a Comeback,'' on the struggle that went into John Burton
becoming president pro tem of the state Senate, among Jacobs' many
definitive political columns.
</P>
<P>
   It's not just that Jacobs, the political editor of McClatchy
Newspapers and former political writer for the San Francisco
Examiner, was one of the best in the business, respected by
everyone he wrote about. That is, with the exception of Clint
Reilly and a few other political consultants.
</P>
<P>
   The fact is, the Legislature desperately needed a moment of
silence.
</P>
<P>
   After Tuesday's embarrassing uproar about Insurance Commissioner
Chuck Quackenbush, everybody in Sacramento could use a week of
silence to reflect on the humane and democratic values Jacobs stood
for.
</P>
<P>
   I don't know what Jacobs would have written about Quackenbush's
strange showdown with state Sen. Jackie Speier's insurance
committee, but that was one of the great things about his column.
You never knew what he'd write, except it would be insightful.
</P>
<P>
   He understood the nuances and nastiness of personality conflict,
ambush and counter-ambush. But he also never forgot what insurance
commissioners and legislators are paid to do. Namely, serve the
people.
</P>
<P>
   He wouldn't forget that politicians are as flawed as the people
they represent, but he wouldn't sink into cynicism and write them
off as an innately comical or criminal class.
</P>
<P>
   In times like this, the times of Gore and Bush, Davis and
Quackenbush, I wish John were around to call.
</P>
<P>
   There I was, an ordinary guy, watching the television news and a
political pro wrestling match, perhaps called ``The Quackster
Strikes Back.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Quackster'' _ that's what they call Quackenbush in
Sacramento. It's the kind of cheap nickname that would never make
it into a column by John Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush walked into Speier's committee battered by charges
of misusing his office and being cozy with the insurance companies
he's supposed to regulate. Then, in a quick turnaround, he
pile-drived his tormentors with an incriminating e-mail,
triumphantly escaping the arena until the rematch.
</P>
<P>
   Pro wrestling _ that's the way many of us see politics. Jacobs
saw politics as baseball, as something complicated, real and
elegant in its slow way.
</P>
<P>
   Television is where most Americans learn what little they know
about politics. There are diminishing numbers of political writers
like Jacobs capable of understanding it as a human process, and
describing it in understandable ways.
</P>
<P>
   The Quackenbush fiasco, as shown on the news, seemed designed to
drive Californians into deeper political withdrawal. Without a
political writer to explain the drama, all TV showed was the flash
and shouting of WWF performed in suits.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush, who bears a striking resemblance to Niedermeier,
the ROTC commander in the movie ``Animal House'' (again, Jacobs
wouldn't say that), flummoxed Speier by reading a year-old e-mail
to her chief aide filled with advice about how to ``ambush'' the
insurance commissioner.
</P>
<P>
   One word is all it takes sometimes _ and when will people stop
using e-mail? That's what the average TV viewer, unaided by good
political analysis, came away with. As well as a bad taste in the
mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Speier told reporters she knew what an ambush really was, and
the TV showed footage of the airstrip ambush in which Speier was
wounded by Jim Jones' henchmen.
</P>
<P>
   Quackenbush's lawyer answered a question by saying, ``In the
immortal words of Teddy Kennedy, we'll cross that bridge when we
come to it.''
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, there was no tape of the Chappaquiddick bridge.
Still, this was sound bite journalism at its least toothsome.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs would have dug deeper than the distasteful surface of
this one.
</P>
<P>
   But Jacobs was never afraid to tell uncomfortable truths
straight out. In re-reading old columns of his, I found one from
three years ago about a public fiasco more notorious than anything
involving Chuck Quackenbush _ Jack Davis' birthday party with its
sadomasochistic sex show.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the reportage that followed focused, predictably, on
the raunch and the sleaze, on who attended and when they left,''
Jacobs wrote. ``But there are deeper questions here that haven't
been raised: How did Jack Davis, a political thug, accumulate so
much power? Why was an invitation to his party so eagerly sought?''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs then described the political vacuum created in the
mid-1980s as strong San Francisco politicians ``died off or
disengaged,'' and consultants like Davis, ``answerable to no one,''
filled the vacuum.
</P>
<P>
   Being answerable to someone. That's the essence of our system of
government. Davis was at least answerable to Jacobs, and for the
sake of Jacobs' native city.
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs ended his column, ``Davis is a living example of Lord
Acton's adage that power corrupts. But that doesn't mean an entire
city has to mirror his corruption.''
</P>
<P>
   Jacobs was a tough guy, but a fair guy and usually right. I will
miss him terribly.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ On the surface, it looks like a simple equation:
Women play sports, and they like to shop.
</P>
<P>
   But selling activewear to women and getting it right is
something that retailers _ especially sporting goods and athletic
specialty stores _ have wrestled with for years.
</P>
<P>
   There's no disputing women's activewear represents a growth
opportunity. But tackling the issue continues to plague focus
groups and executives alike. Some say the challenge stems from
increased competition from nonathletic brands and stores, the
popularity of sharp-priced private-label goods, lack of innovation
and old stereotypes in the male-dominated sporting goods industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The athletic area is a very tough business on the women's side
because of the fashion component,'' said John Shanley, senior vice
president of First Security Van Kasper. ``A lot of women are buying
perfectly fine private-label exercise apparel at lower price
points. On the upper end, they're buying performance-oriented
apparel. But it's hard to tell if they're buying it for their
performance characteristics or fashion ones. If it's for fashion,
they're dealing with so many other options.''
</P>
<P>
   No longer snickering at the likes of The Gap, Old Navy and
Abercrombie &AMP; Fitch for their inauthentic athletic looks, sporting
goods stores recognize them as serious competitors. Making matters
more complicated is the influx of e-tailers going after the women's
business. Lucy.com, womenoutdoors.com, venussports.com and
geargoddess.com are among the new players that aim to steal more
market share from traditional retailers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We used to have a running joke with my friends who work in the
sporting goods industry. We couldn't understand why women's is
listed as a category. It's not a category _ it's half the
population,'' said Vicki Reed, marketing director of Lucy.com. ``If
you start off lumping too many things into one basket, you can't
reach all women. And you can't talk to them with the most relevant
message.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that, it's not surprising that retailers are not sold on
any particular strategy; they're trying them as they go.
</P>
<P>
   Having tried two different formats for women's stores, The
Athlete's Foot now plans to test a third prototype with next
month's opening of a 2,000-square-foot store in Nashville, Tenn.
Robert Corliss, president and chief executive officer of the
company, said the new one was developed because the other two
concepts are not doing that well. Being located in malls with a
traditional Athlete's Foot store has detracted from the business,
he said. The women's stores are called The Athlete's Foot for Her,
and the new prototype will also carry that banner.
</P>
<P>
   The chain has invested hundreds of thousands of dollars in the
new store type. Designed to be more of a lifestyle store, there
will be added seating, nutritional products and sports-related
literature, a few new labels, more technical-oriented products and
head-to-toe displays. Fit Print, a proprietary foot-scanning
technique that measures a shopper's size and gait, will also be
offered in the new store.
</P>
<P>
   The Athlete's Foot is also rolling out a pilot program for
training supplied by Knowoyourstuff.com. With the use of the
Internet, employees will be able to measure their performance,
check their compensation and obtain product information.
</P>
<P>
   Corliss noted that women's sales, which account for 25 percent
of the company's volume, have increased slightly in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is looking at the women's business. Women are about
51 percent of the population, they make 70 to 80 percent of the
buying decisions and they represent 30 percent of [sporting goods]
stores' sales,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corliss praised Lady Foot Locker ``for making a market out of
the women's business,'' and he also gave kudos to Nordstrom for its
merchandising and customer service. The Gap, The Limited and
Talbots have done a good job of serving women, he said, but
sporting goods stores don't make the grade yet.
</P>
<P>
   According to Corliss, sporting goods stores have been such a
male-oriented business for so long that they haven't been able to
give women a real voice.
</P>
<P>
   Now that more high schools and colleges are enforcing Title IX _
1972 legislation that guaranteed equal opportunity for federally
funded athletic programs _ demand for women's activewear and
athletic footwear will only increase. Corliss' daughter, who is now
a Division I field hockey player in college, made him more aware of
the need for stores that cater to women.
</P>
<P>
   Reed of Lucy.com noted how funny it is that retailers don't
single out the challenge of selling to men as they do with women.
Many sporting goods and athletic specialty e-tailers list various
sports and women's as separate categories online instead of
including women's products within the various sports, she said. For
example, the options might include ``tennis,'' ``golf,''
``running'' and ``women's.''
</P>
<P>
   The fact that women tend to be more sophisticated shoppers than
men and are ``harder to please'' has challenged some stores, Reed
said. In addition, many sporting goods stores and athletic
specialty stores have limited floor space and real estate.
Nevertheless, Lucy.com is considering opening freestanding stores,
even though that is an ``incredibly huge undertaking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now we can reach women nationally so much faster than we
would if we were to open a chain of stores. Building a Web site is
certainly not cheap, but it's much more reasonable to do it in a
short period of time,'' Reed said. ``It's also accessible all the
time, and you can get it from any place. With the way life is now,
that's a huge bonus.''
</P>
<P>
   Even MacySport stepped into the women's business somewhat
cautiously. When the sports-oriented concept shop bowed last summer
at Macy's flagship store at New York's Herald Square, women's
activewear was offered on a limited basis.
</P>
<P>
   Now the retailer is working to develop that component with
additional labels and special events aimed at women. An Adidas
fashion show, athlete appearances and panel discussions are some of
the strategies being used.
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Sailor, buyer for branded women's and kids' apparel for
The Finish Line, said female customers require more attention than
their male counterparts. ``They want to talk to someone who has
used the product. Providing knowledge on the sales floor is very
important.''
</P>
<P>
   As performance-oriented products continue to become more
popular, having well-informed sales help will only become more
important, she said. Given that, The Finish Line has been
distributing more printed material about high-tech merchandise to
its sales associates and via its divisional managers.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Kelleher, director of marketing for Blades, a specialty
store chain that caters to snowboarders, skateboarders and other
nontraditional athletes, said asking women what they want and
following through with the appropriate product are essential to
building sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our area, the clothing is so closely tied to the sports.
We've been catering to women's needs, not saying, `This T-shirt is
good enough _ it's got the same skateboard brand on it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Reorganizing sales floors and trying new fixtures and new
displays sometimes on a weekly basis are some of the ways Blades
aims to attract more women.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way we look at it, we're in a constant state of
improvement,'' Kelleher said. ``We try to cater to the customer as
much as possible to the level they expect. Customer service is such
an important part of our business _ that's been one of our biggest
challenges.'' &QL;

ONLINE HELP FOR RAPE VICTIMS

<P>
   Even though its name contains the word ``rape'' and the
emergency code 911, this newly launched Web site is meant to be a
safe harbor for victims of sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   Officials from the Rape Treatment Center (RTC) at Santa
Monica-UCLA Medical Center are hoping the Web site,
www.911rape.org, will be comforting and useful to rape victims _
both locally and throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most rapes are never reported and most victims never tell
anyone,'' said Gail Abarbanel, director of the 26-year-old RTC.
``And the reason they don't tell anyone is because, to get any kind
of help, you have to really expose your identity. Some of them are
so ashamed they can't even speak about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an opportunity that never existed before because now
they can access the information with total anonymity.''
</P>
<P>
   The sub-sections of the site contain information specially
geared toward teens and a section for college students _ one of the
groups at highest risk of sexual assault. Site visitors can learn
about ``rape drugs,'' hear survivor stories, order information
materials and learn about treatment and their legal and medical
options.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting the site is a first step, says Abarbanel. After looking
over the information, a rape victim can decide whether to contact a
local crisis center or hotline, go to the police, or not take
further action. The site is designed to be a resource for victims
even if the assault took place years in the past.
</P>
<P>
   The Web site received a launch party last week at the Bel Air
home of Paramount Motion Pictures Chairman Sherry Lansing. Lansing,
who produced the 1988 movie ``The Accused'' about a rape victim,
has long been a friend of the RTC. Appearing with Abarbanel at the
launch party was actor David Schwimmer, who has filmed a number of
rape awareness promos for NBC and who is on the RTC's board of
directors.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents look at the 'Net as an incomprehensible and
terrifying monster, and that's true,'' said Schwimmer, wearing a
white www.911rape.org T-shirt. ``We can also utilize it as a new
and powerful tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``This new site offers hopefully what people need _ a safe,
anonymous first step.''
</P>
<P>
   Schwimmer agreed to do the promos after Abarbanel visited the
set of his sitcom ``Friends'' and asked if any of the cast members
would be willing to help with outreach efforts. He later learned
his parents had been supporters of the organization for years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I admire Gail's commitment and her work so much, and in the
past several years, I've come to know that some of my former
girlfriends and friends have been victims of rape,'' said Schwimmer
who has helped with RTC outreach programs that target college
students.
</P>
<P>
   Liability restrictions prohibit site operators from making
www.911rape.org an interactive site. Legally, all RTC officials can
do is post the number and address for their organization and for
rape crisis resources such as the Rape, Abuse and Incest National
Network (RAINN, 800-656-4673). Site visitors can then choose to
contact the RTC, RAINN or local resources directly. &QL;

YOUNG LIVES TAKING SOME TWISTS AND TURNS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It almost sounds like the punch line of a New Yorker cartoon:
``Sorry, I'm afraid little Johnny can't come over to play after
school tomorrow. His sun salutations are weak, and I've grounded
him until he masters the up dog stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   But yoga for the young is no joke; nor is it strictly a matter
of new age parents schlepping their wee ones along to twice weekly
meditation sessions hoping some good karma will rub off. Claiming
the activities hold numerous benefits for growth and development,
instructors are teaching various forms of yoga _ including poses,
stretches and guided imagery _ to children of pre-school,
elementary school age and and even to those in the teen years.
</P>
<P>
   Programs based on the principles of Iyengar yoga _ one of the
oldest forms of the craft in existence _ have been incorporated
into an after-school program at the Gardener Avenue School in Los
Angeles. Once a week, students ages 7 to 12 of all ethnic
backgrounds are bending, stretching and contorting, often at a pace
adults couldn't handle.
</P>
<P>
   And they're loving every minute of it.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, what the kids are doing is not the type of yoga that
you'll see in a traditional adult session. Often the pace will be
faster. Depending on the age range, an instructor may mix in
pretend games or play activities. The program, invented by Encino
pre-school instructor Leah Kalish, is called Imaginazium, which the
kids shorten to ``Imagics.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the name, you can guess which part of a child is getting a
workout.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's creative dramatics, it's physical play, imaginative play
and it's storytelling. The goal is to really support them in their
creative expression,'' says Kalish, a former actor and dancer who
teaches at three Neighborhood preschools in the San Fernando
Valley. ``They have unbelievable resources inside them. I just try
to create the environment.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoga is often perceived as a meditative activity _ something we
don't often associate as being necessary for energy-stocked
children. But as both yoga instructors and child psychologists
point out, childhood can be a stressful time, and even the younger
set can often use a little bit of centering and focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have seen tremendous change in kids' bodies as well as in
their psyches,'' says Sue Garfield who has taught a weekly class
for ages 7 to 12 through the Iyengar Institute of Los Angeles since
1994. ``I've had several boys on Ritalin and it seems the yoga
absolutely calms them. The faster I can move them, the better they
do.'' New York-based instructor Lisa Trivell says yoga can help you
with other favorite activities. Both in her classes and her book
``I Can't Believe It's Yoga for Kids'' (Hatherleigh, $16.95),
Trivell links yoga stretches to sports activities. Into basketball?
Exercises like the down dog and warrior back stretches will help
get you ready to start crashing the boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember taking gym class in school, and they never
emphasized stretching enough. Everything was always very
competitive.'' says Trivell. ``My kids are into all sorts of
sports, and it's important for them to take time out and work on
their posture and breathing, to tune into the muscles that are
tight.''
</P>
<P>
   Yoga can also offer other benefits _ anything from helping
children overcome shyness, to improving physical coordination to
simply giving them a relaxation technique to build upon throughout
their lives. With yoga, Garfield says, the teen years may become
less stressful.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're losing their mind with the amount of homework they
get, and their parents have them totally overscheduled,'' says
Garfield. ``With the older kids, yoga is wonderful.''
</P>
<P>
   !folo!``Rooaaaarrr!!!''
</P>
<P>
   It's Monday morning, shortly before lunch, at Imagics class at
The Neighborhood School in Studio City. Starting from a crouched
sphinx-like position, with their arms flat and palms down on the
floor, nine small lions spring forward toward the center of a
circle, cutting loose with an energetic growl. As they move into
the roaring position, their backs arch and they're up on their
hands as their legs stay flat behind them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rooaaaarrr!!!''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly a favorite among the 5- and 6-year-olds at the
Neighborhood School, the lion pose, spring and roar is repeated,
although not before one student tells his instructor he nearly
bumped his head on the last lunge.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, you'll have to be a lion that's a little more
coordinated than that,'' Leah Kalish says with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   Lion is popular. So are Shark, Octopus, Frog and
Do-Nothing-Doll. Most activities aren't quite so noisy. A few
minutes after lion, Kalish's is the only voice that can be heard as
she guides her students _ eyes closed _ in pursuit of a butterfly
through a magic doorway and into a magic forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``And you wonder,'' Kalish tells the children, ``what's going to
happen today.''
</P>
<P>
   A 45-minute Imaginazium class will contain, at most, 20 minutes
of pure yoga, says Kalish. The rest is a mixture of imaginative
play, charades-like games and working with imagery. Everything
needs a context, and it needs to be playful to engage a child's
attention.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish's students will talk to her about what they experienced
during meditative exercises. Another popular activity is sending
rainbows, in which the children concentrate on sending positive
energy to a friend or loved one, energy which, Kalish says, will
invariably be felt by the recipient. Our thoughts, the lesson goes,
can affect the way other people feel.
</P>
<P>
   The children take the language and activities of Imaginazium
back home. Kalish is constantly hearing from parents who want to
know about the imaginative stories their children are asking to
hear. Children are now instructing their parents to center
themselves, breathe out or use finesse instead of force.
</P>
<P>
   Kalish teaches only a handful of classes, but her Imaginazium
program and the Yoga Kit for Kids has found its way into numerous
school. Guided imagery may be used by a teacher as part of a
special education class, or in the home as a favorite pre bedtime
activity to be used by a parent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd like to create more products that teachers can use,'' says
Kalish who has produced a video and hopes eventually to do a TV
show. ``That's really much more my goal than having my own school.
I envision Imagics and the tools I create to build structures that
teachers and kids can use in the ways they need to and when they
need to.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Charlotte Reznick, an educational psychologist who works
with imagery says she has seen the therapeutic benefits of
activities that keep children in touch with their minds, bodies and
spirit. She recognizes the benefits of the kids who uses yoga
techniques.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a kid has basic self-esteem, he can become even more
confident,'' says Reznick, an assistant professor of clinical
psychology at UCLA's graduate program. ``Even Einstein used imagery
to create the theory of relativity. He pictured himself floating on
a light wave.''
</P>
<P>
   Here's betting he would have made a killer octopus. &QL;

GOOD BUSINESS FOR COMPANIES TO HELP EMPLOYEE CARETAKERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By EVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For most of us, balancing a professional life and family is
challenging enough. But how can we be expected to keep all the
balls in the air when we must also add the responsibility of taking
care of a parent or elderly relative?
</P>
<P>
   There won't be any quick fix answers offered at the Work, Family
and Eldercare Conference on Friday in Sherman Oaks. But the
gathering will give working caregivers and employers the
opportunity to meet and discuss common obstacles and goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll have a mixed audience, primarily from employee
assistance programs (EAPs) within large companies,'' said Steven
Barlam, a social worker and the chief professional officer of
LivHOME, an L.A. based elder care management company. ``But the
community is absolutely invited.''
</P>
<P>
   Barlam will be one of 13 speakers at the conference. He'll share
the stage with _ among others _ Dr. Paula Dromi from the City of
Los Angeles Department of Aging; Irene Wechsler of Eldercare; Dr.
Terry Eagan, medical director of Sherman Oaks Hospital's Premier
program and L.A. City Councilman Michael Feur.
</P>
<P>
   Barlam, who will discuss his company's model of elder care, says
people 85 and older make up the fastest growing segment of the
population. By the end of the year, the one third of the nation's
work force is expected to be between the ages of 40 and 54. It is
people in this age range who will quickly be facing decisions
regarding elder care.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our society has never really been geared toward how to address
this,'' said Barlam. ``Some companies are taking a leadership role
by coming up with meaningful benefits and services that add value
to caregivers.''
</P>
<P>
   Many large companies have employee assistance programs that
offer information and referral services. It is then up to the
employee to seek out his or her own resources.
</P>
<P>
   But until recently, an average business's assistance program
probably was better equipped to provide information relating to
issues such as substance abuse and/or child care rather than elder
care matters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The elder care area is growing now. More and more EAP's are
getting requests for information,'' said Barlam. ``Some companies
are offering informal brown bag lunches as a way to provide
information. It can be very cost effective.''
</P>
<P>
   EAP related matters become part of a company's balancing act.
With the state unemployment and national unemployment rate at a low
point, company administrators need to keep their employees happy or
they risk losing them. Strong resources to help an employee address
child care or elder care matters can make a difference, according
to Barlam.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they invest money in terms of taking care of and nurturing
their employees, it can positively impact their bottom line,'' he
said. The Work, Family and Eldercare conference will be held Friday
from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m. at the Radisson Valley Center Hotel, 15433
Ventura Blvd. in Sherman Oaks. Registration is $38 in advance and
$45 at the door. For information, call (800) 266-9406.

FROM MACABRE TO MELODRAMATIC
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
By ROB LOWMAN 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Apart from their odd and occasionally macabre sensibilities, Tim
Burton and Neil Jordan have little in common as filmmakers. Burton
has a baroque visual style inspired by everything from D.C. Comics
to Edward Gorey drawings to sci-fi fantasies to B-movies, a style
that often carries his films. Jordan, who is also a novelist, draws
his style more from his storytelling abilities (he is Irish, after
all), and being that they are not simple tales, light and shadows
often play a big part in the way his films are shot. These
contrasting styles are on display in Burton's and Jordan's latest
films, now out on video and DVD.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleepy Hollow,'' an oddly reimagined telling of the classic
Washington Irving story starring Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci,
is like a gothic dream _ er, nightmare. Its narrative operates much
like a dream, with each bizarre occurrence catapulting the
characters into another equally strange reality, with only a thread
of logic holding them together.
</P>
<P>
   Despite a number of lopped-off heads at the hands of the
Headless Horseman (played with deranged glee by Christopher
Walken), ``Hollow'' is not about abject terror. There is a gentle
ghoulishness to Burton's films, including ``Beetlejuice'' (1988),
``Edward Scissorhands (1990) and ``The Nightmare Before Christmas''
(1993). ``Hollow'' is darker, though, with a more sinister edge.
Even Depp's Ichabod Crane, with the scientific contraptions he
straps on, looks more frightening than the gentle Scissorhands with
his razor-sharp appendages. It's as if Burton is giving us a
grotesque vision of ourselves 20 years later, attached to our own
contraptions. It's with images like these that Burton succeeds, but
there is something lackluster about the storytelling. Still, the
movie is fascinating at times, such as in the scene of a revolving
lantern lit for a small boy that sends shadows of witches and
goblins swirling on the walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``End of the Affair,'' Jordan's adaptation of Graham Greene's
novel, is an exquisite balancing act between the metaphysical and
the sensual. The film chronicles the breakup of a novelist (Ralph
Fiennes) and the wife of a high-ranking civil servant (Julianne
Moore), with whom he's having an affair in London during World War
II. This could all seem rather pedestrian, and in lesser hands than
Jordan's, Greene's delicate story undoubtedly would fall apart.
``Affair'' is like an intricate jigsaw puzzle, with multiple voices
and perspectives that Jordan deftly orchestrates. And when the
pieces finally fit together, the final picture resonates beyond the
film's surprising end.
</P>
<P>
   A new DVD version of one of Jordan's voyages into the macabre,
``Interview With the Vampire''(1994), is also being released with
commentary by the director. Despite being saddled with having to
adapt Anne Rice's best seller, Jordan managed to keep fans of the
novel happy while making a film that has some bite for the rest of
us. It's a film that deserves a second look. &QL; 
__ ``Sleepy Hollow'' (Paramount) is $106.99 for VHS (priced for
rental) and $29.99 for DVD, which includes commentary by Tim
Burton, cast and crew interviews and a behind-the-scenes
featurette. ``End of the Affair'' (Sony) is $104.99 for VHS (priced
for rental) and $27.95 for DVD, which includes commentary by Neil
Jordan and Julianne Moore and a making-of featurette. The new DVD
version of ``Interview With the Vampire'' (Warners) is $24.98 and
includes commentary by Jordan and a behind-the-scenes featurette
and introduction by Jordan and Anne Rice. &QL;

NEW SPIN ON AN OLD TALE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Eds: Fact box below) 
Our rating: 3 stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Takeshi Kitano, the Japanese Renaissance tough guy who writes,
directs, edits and even makes animated drawings for the films he
stars in, says that he wanted to upset people's expectations with
his latest movie, ``Kikujiro.''
</P>
<P>
   Mission sort of accomplished. While this is certainly a gentler
effort than the bloody, absurdist gangster films, ``Hana-Bi'' and
``Sonatine,'' that have made his international reputation,
``Kikujiro'' has all the now recognizable, eccentric hallmarks of
Kitano's unique filmmaking style. It also sticks quite stubbornly
to the conventions of its sentimental genre, the grumpy old
coot/cute kid on-the-road movie.
</P>
<P>
   Kitano does pull some nice, unexpected riffs out of the
tried-and-true situation, and he manages to keep the tone nicely
hard-boiled until the final, inevitably oversweetened stretch. The
too-long film does get repetitive in places, but it has a large
enough supply of oddball ideas to remain engaging even at its most
predictable.
</P>
<P>
   Kitano's gruff title character is an irresponsible bum whose
fed-up wife essentially orders him to escort a sullen 9-year-old
neighbor, Masao (Yusuke Sekiguchi), to a faraway town. It's summer,
all the chubby kid's friends have left for family vacations, and
he's determined to meet the mother he's never known (Masao lives
with his well-meaning but boring grandmother).
</P>
<P>
   Kikujiro instantly blows Masao's travel money at the race track,
forcing the mismatched duo to make their way across Japan by any
means necessary. This means lots of hitchhiking encounters with
assorted colorful wanderers, including a hippie-like writer, a
pleasant young couple who go out of their way to entertain the boy,
and two unusually timid and manipulable bikers.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout their adventures, Kikujiro wheedles, browbeats,
deceives and otherwise annoys people into helping them out. Some of
the film's best comedy involves properly behaved people's quizzical
reactions to this aggressively vulgar man. He's not very sensitive
toward the kid, either, but of course they bond over time and
Kikujiro presumably grows into a better person while teaching Masao
useful, if rude, survival skills.
</P>
<P>
   You've seen it all before, in every combination and language,
starting somewhere around Chaplin and, for a recent example, in
``Central Station's'' Brazil, with a few thousand of those Japanese
Tora-San movies sandwiched in between (for a genuinely alarming
take on the genre, try to find radical Japanese director Nagisa
Oshima's 1969 ``Boy'').
</P>
<P>
   But you've never seen it quite the way Kitano films it, against
austerely framed, spatially intriguing landscapes and through
numerous trick shots (from inside a champagne glass, reflected in a
spinning hubcap, through a dragonfly's multifaceted point-of-view,
etc.).
</P>
<P>
   If we didn't know where all of this was going from the first
frame, ``Kikujiro'' would be an expectation confounder of the first
order. As it is, it's a good, fresh gloss on reassuring cliches. &QL;

The film: ``Kikujiro'' (PG-13; language, mild violence, nudity). &QL;

Greenaway's latest exercise in tedium, ``8 1/2 Women.'' A dry
meditation on sexual fantasies, ego and, yes, Fellini, this movie
is such a cold dish that it makes Kubrick's last movie look like a
bawdy trip through Amsterdam's red-light district.
</P>
<P>
   Greenaway's films have always been studies in structure, symbols
and formalism, making up for what they lack in humor with an
overabundance of elitist malarkey. Still, in the case of, say,
``The Cook, the Thief, His Wife and Her Lover,'' Greenaway's
obsessions can be diverting and his visual presentation can be
strikingly inventive. But there's little in ``8 1/2 Women'' that
rises above the banal; Greenaway seems largely to be trying to see
just how much time he can spend either talking about or showing
male genitalia. (Answer: a lot.)
</P>
<P>
   The movie follows a self-absorbed businessman, Philip Emmenthal
(John Standing) and his equally shallow son, Storey (Matthew
Delamere). When Philip's wife dies, Storey goads his father on a
voyage of sexual self-discovery. This comes after Philip's rather
strange way of coping with his grief (``You've never slept with a
corpse, I take it?'' he asks Storey) and an episode of father-son
incest, something that seems to fascinate Greenaway simply because
there isn't a word in the English language for it.
</P>
<P>
   After watching Fellini's ``8 1/2,'' the Emmenthals ponder the
nature of cinema. ``Do all directors make films to satisfy their
sexual fantasies?'' Philip asks. If you're Greenaway, it's a
rhetorical question, and he soon has father and son collecting a
mansion full of libidinous playthings, women that run the gamut of
sexual fantasy figures. There's a sexually talented, gold-hearted
whore (Polly Walker), a nun (Toni Collette), a subservient
housekeeper (Barbara Sarafian), a passive Japanese porcelain doll
(Kirina Mano) and an earth mother who grooves on being perpetually
pregnant (Natacha Amal).
</P>
<P>
   And lest Greenaway be accused of mellowing, he also includes a
paraplegic (Amanda Plummer) who enjoys an intimate relationship
with a pig and a mysterious legless woman, Giulietta (Manna
Fujiwara, playing a character seemingly named after Fellini's wife,
an odd homage indeed).
</P>
<P>
   Philip muses that ``most films are about what people haven't got
_ sex and money _ and we have them both,'' but it's obvious that
this happiness will be short-lived and that the Emmenthals will
receive their comeuppance. But what passes for female empowerment
in Greenaway's misogynistic world is really just male self-pity,
dressed up in pseudo-intellectual claptrap. As the friendly
prostitute says, ``Men love women, women love children, and
children love hamsters.''
</P>
<P>
   And if you find deep meaning in that, you certainly won't agree
when Philip admits to Storey that ``all this narcissism is rather
boring.'' But for Greenaway, it's less a self-conscious confession
than a mission statement, as much a badge of honor as all the
genitalia he keeps purposelessly waving in the audience's face. &QL;

&HT;     BISCOTTO, A SWEET TREAT, CAN BE JUST AS SAVORY 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By BONNIE WALKER  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Biscotti, those crunchy, twice-baked cookies,
usually appeal to our sweet tooth. We dip them into our dessert
wine or espresso and enjoy them flavored with cinnamon or cardamom,
or flecked with candied ginger.
</P>
<P>
   But, they have their savory side as well. Think, for instance,
of a crisp Parmesan and sun-dried tomato biscotto (the singular of
biscotti) served for dipping into a bowl of homemade minestrone. A
romano cheese and black pepper biscotto would certainly upstage
crackers on an appetizer table with the bowl of green olive
tapenade. Or, a few slices, made with fresh rosemary, might
accompany a bowl of chilly gazpacho, a few slices of hard cheese
and a brisk white Italian wine _ a warm-weather supper worth
setting the table for.
</P>
<P>
   The savory biscotto is almost certainly an American innovation,
and one that opens up a whole new world of possibilities.
</P>
<P>
   But, the original biscotto is quintessentially Italian.
</P>
<P>
   ``The derivation of the word is from cotto which means cooked,
and bis, which means twice,'' says Carol Field, Italian food expert
and author, whose books include ``The Italian Baker,'' ``Italy in
Small Bites'' and ``Celebrating Italy.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the cookies we know as biscotti have been cooked twice.
The dough is first shaped into a loaf and baked, then it is sliced
and the individual slices are baked again.
</P>
<P>
   In Italy, the word biscotto is also used as a general term to
apply to all cookies, says Field, who spoke from her home in San
Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most famous biscotti are from Prato,'' says Field. This
cookie, made with almonds, vanilla and a little orange zest, are
the shape and taste we have come to associate with biscotti.
</P>
<P>
   ``They'll keep for a long time. As they're traditionally made,
there is no shortening, not butter or oil. A lot of them now are
being made with shortening, though, to make them softer,'' Field
says.
</P>
<P>
   Biscotti, she noted, also tend to be regional, being far more
common in Northern Italy (where Prato is) than in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Ezio de Rosa, chef and owner of Grissini Ristorante Italiano in
San Antonio, says he knows the particularly hard, sliced biscotti,
usually studded with almonds, as ghiottini. (He also notes that the
practice of dipping the cookie into a cup of espresso or coffee
seems to be more common in other parts of Europe than it is in his
own region of the country.)
</P>
<P>
   As an avid biscotti maker, I can say this about the cookie: Yes,
the dough is hard to stir and it has to be baked, sliced, then
baked again, which takes some time.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, making this cookie, sweet or savory, is an
uncomplicated task.
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``The Il Fornia Baking Book,'' author Franco Galli
describes his solution for working with the stiffness of biscotti
dough. He uses a hand-held mixer set at medium speed until the
dough is a ``rough, shaggy mass.'' Then he kneads it with
flour-dusted hands in the bowl until all the ingredients are well
mixed, turns it out onto a pastry board and kneads for another
minute or so.
</P>
<P>
   Two other cookie makers, authors Barry Bluestein and Kevin
Morrissey, who wrote ``The Complete Cookie'' (Doubleday, $25),
recommend using a sturdy, wooden spoon and we assume, a muscular
stirring arm.
</P>
<P>
   Field says, ``I use a stand mixer _ it's easier.''
</P>
<P>
   Another discovery I've made about biscotti: If you've made them
once or twice, beware the urge to make them again _ and again.
</P>
<P>
   Last Christmas, after deciding homemade biscotti would be just
the thing to give my wine- and coffee-loving friends as gifts, I
made a batch or two of almond biscotti. Then, I thought toasted
hazelnut and dark chocolate would be a good combination and looked
up a recipe to adapt for these.
</P>
<P>
   When I was through, I didn't like the texture and so made
another batch varying the amounts of ingredients. Then, it occurred
to me that gingerbread biscotti would be appropriate for the
holidays and ... you get the picture. I was hooked.
</P>
<P>
   Now, as the oregano and basil are thriving in the garden, as
fresh tomatoes and other vegetables begin to grow on the vine,
biscotti beckons again. This time, savory is the way to go.
</P>
<P>
   Here are a few other tips for making biscotti:
</P>
<P>
   For sweet or savory biscotti, use parchment paper on your baking
sheets. While greasing the pans with butter works fine, parchment
paper makes handling and cleanup easier.
</P>
<P>
   Bluestein and Morrissey recommend doing the second baking with
the biscotti slices standing up for crisp cookies _ lay the slices
down and bake the second time for really brittle results.
</P>
<P>
   Others fresh herbs, such as oregano or sage (use sparingly), can
replace the rosemary. Other hard cheeses, such as romano, might
replace Parmesan. Spices such as cracked black pepper or red pepper
are good, too.

&HT;     ONE WAY TO IMPROVISE IN THE KITCHEN

<P>
   A good cook, like the U.S. Marine Rangers in the Clint Eastwood
movie ``Heartbreak Ridge,'' has to be able to ``adapt, improvise
and overcome'' when faced with a cooking surprise.
</P>
<P>
   I recently defrosted a package of meat labeled ``feral hog
backstrap'' only to find that venison steaks were inside the
freezer wrap.
</P>
<P>
   Plans for a pork-chop dinner had to be scrapped, and I went
searching through the kitchen pantry to find ingredients to salvage
the meal.
</P>
<P>
   The following recipe is what I created in about the time I would
have needed to grill the pork chops.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to stir the mixture once or twice while it is simmering
to keep it from sticking to the skillet.
</P>
<P>

<P>
   MAKE THE BEST OF IT SKILLET
</P>
<P>
   2 pounds venison round steak
</P>
<P>
   Ralph's Spice Mix, to taste
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned flour
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup cooking oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup chopped onion
</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, minced

   1 teaspoon sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 can cream of mushroom soup
</P>
<P>
   1/2 soup-can milk
</P>
<P>
   Cut the steaks into one-inch cubes and season with spice mix
(use your own combination of salt, black pepper, etc., if you
like). Place seasoned meat cubes and seasoned flour in a plastic
bag and shake well to coat. Heat oil in a cast-iron skillet over
medium heat. Brown floured cubes on all sides and remove to a warm
platter. Add onion, garlic, spaghetti (broken into pieces about an
inch long) and sugar to skillet. Cook, turning often until onion is
transparent and spaghetti is slightly browned. Add soup and milk to
skillet, stir well and then add browned meat. Reduce heat, cover
and simmer about 15 to 20 minutes.

&HT;     HISPANICS SEE CISNEROS AS GOOD CHOICE TO HEAD L.A. SCHOOLS

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The only Hispanic member of the Los Angeles Board
of Education cannot hide her glee at the possibility of recruiting
former Housing Secretary Henry Cisneros to run the nation's
second-largest school system.
</P>
<P>
   But Cisneros says he does not want to be recruited.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, who now heads the Univision, the nation's largest
Spanish-language television network, has been considered for what
many see as an impossible job. He admits he may have the perfect
background to salvage the Los Angeles Unified School District, a
poor inner-city system so large it spans four telephone area codes.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros repeated Wednesday that he was flattered but
uninterested.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief interview outside the hotel where Univision
shareholders were gathered for a meeting, Cisneros said he twice
had asked school district officials to remove him from their short
list. Maybe he needed to ask them again, he mused.
</P>
<P>
   He then pointed out why he might excel at the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've got a big school district with huge problems,''
Cisneros said. ``They've got a man who was mayor of a big city, a
former Cabinet officer, who has shown he can solve problems of
poverty issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, was the mayor of San Antonio before he became
secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development in
1993, a post he held during President Clinton's first term in
office.
</P>
<P>
   During his seemingly unstoppable political rise, Cisneros was
the first Hispanic seriously considered as a vice presidential
candidate, but a costly and messy independent counsel investigation
into his payments to a former mistress derailed that ascent.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros pleaded guilty on Sept. 8, 1999, to a single
misdemeanor charge of lying to the FBI about the payments during
routine background checks on nominees for Cabinet posts. Cisneros
paid a $10,000 fine. In exchange for the guilty plea, a federal
judge dropped 18 felony counts that could have sent him to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros opted for a lucrative and relatively private life as a
Southern California business executive. As Univision's public face,
however, Cisneros has charmed Los Angeles and is no stranger at
school board meetings, said Victoria Castro, a former junior high
school principal and the only Hispanic on the school board.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can just speak from my perspective and that of the Latino
community,'' she said. ``He is revered.''
</P>
<P>
   Some who know Cisneros well say he remains tempted by the allure
of working to solve massive social problems. He might even see a
risky public service challenge as a route toward political
redemption, they say.
</P>
<P>
   The Los Angeles school district is now undertaking a
reorganization into 11 smaller units under interim Superintendent
Ramon Cortines.
</P>
<P>
   With 711,000 students, the Los Angeles district ranks second
behind New York City schools in size.
</P>
<P>
   More than 70 percent of its students are Hispanic, and the
Latino community remains wary about the ouster by a newly elected
board majority of popular Superintendent Ruben Zacarias in
November, Castro said.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros is seen as someone who can also appeal to the business
interests that backed the new board members.
</P>
<P>
   Several other potential candidates, including Houston
Superintendent Rod Paige, have said they are not interested in the
Los Angeles job. Only one candidate on the list has lobbied for the
job: former Colorado Gov. Roy Romer.
</P>
<P>
   The L.A. school system wants to pay its new superintendent in
the $190,000 to $250,000 range.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros, through his position at Univision, has been involved
in parental participation and literacy initiatives with the L.A.
schools.
</P>
<P>
   But after earning $600,000 in bonuses and $3.3 million off the
sale of stock options on top of his $600,000 base salary at
Univision for a total of $4.5 million in 1999, taking the school
job would be a considerable step down financially.
</P>
<P>
   Cisneros can cash in additional stock options for about $5.2
million, according to the Univision proxy statement filed with the
U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. If he were to stay at the
company, other stock options, now worth $15.4 million, would mature
in the next few years.

   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   During recent San Antonio stops, Cisneros' comments about
returning to his hometown and some type of public service have had
the effect of tossing kerosene on one of the city's favorite
political campfires: speculation about what he might do next.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Cisneros has steadfastly insisted he has not
fulfilled his obligation to Univision, but also has said he and his
wife, Mary Alice, would like to return to San Antonio in time for
his son John Paul, now in the sixth grade, to attend high school.
</P>
<P>
   Those who believe Cisneros is perhaps the lone Texas Democrat
capable of recapturing major statewide offices have urged the
charismatic favorite son to run for governor or U.S. senator.
</P>
<P>
   But Cisneros has said he is interested in education, perhaps
contributing to recent rumors that he might be a candidate for
chancellor of the University of Texas System.

&HT;     PAMELA KNIGHT MINNAMON, BROWNIE CAMERA GIRL, DIES AT 68 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By CARMINA DANINI  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pamela Knight Minnamon, whose photo as a young girl appeared on
packages of Kodak's popular Brownie cameras, died May 16 at her
home in Tucson, Ariz. Minnamon, who was 68, died at her home of
cancer, said her husband, Paul Minnamon.
</P>
<P>
   Born Dec. 30, 1931, in Rochester, N.Y., she was the daughter of
an Eastman Kodak executive and a homemaker.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1930s and 1940s, boxes containing the Brownie camera
were adorned with her photo. Introduced in 1900, the camera sold
for $1 and used film that cost 15 cents per roll.
</P>
<P>
   The Brownie's low price made it accessible to everyone. Found in
many homes in the early part of the 20th century, the Brownie led
many famous photographers, including the late Ansel Adams, to take
up photography.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was in high school, we had a Brownie that we all used
and her picture was on the cardboard box,'' said her son, Timothy
Hanke of Newburyport, Mass. ``She was a very pretty little blond
girl and her photo appeared on the boxes for several years.''
</P>
<P>
   As an adult, Minnamon worked as an artist's model, her son said.
She also sang and, after graduating from Oberlin College in Ohio,
Minnamon auditioned at the Juilliard School of Music in New York.
</P>
<P>
   In 1980, she moved to San Antonio and got a job at the Witte
Museum. She worked as secretary to Mark Lane, director emeritus of
the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a real unassuming person and very reflective of
herself and the world,'' Lane said.
</P>
<P>
   She was cremated, and her ashes will be taken to the family
estate in upstate New York, her son said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her son, she is survived by her husband, Paul
Minnamon of Tucson; her first husband, Peter Hanke of Austin,
Texas; three daughters, Maria Hanke and Jennifer Moore, both of
Austin, and Nora Hanke of Southampton, Mass.; two grandchildren,
John and Benjamin Hanke of Newburyport; two brothers, Francis R.
Knight III of Brainardsville, N.Y., and Lane Knight of Onchiota,
N.Y.; and one sister, Patricia Knight of Snyder, Colo.

   EUROPE-TAKEOVERS (Paris) _ The cutthroat tactics of the 1980s,
with vulture investors scouring the landscape for takeover prey,
didn't die out, they just found a new home: Europe. In the thick of
this trend is one of the brashest and most feared of the old-style
raiders, Asher B. Edelman, who is trying to outwit a venerable
French family institution, Taittinger, the champagne maker. There's
one big difference, though. While raiders used to slash and burn,
Adelman is staging a prolonged siege, having stalked the Taittinger
family since 1996. Beyond the clash of French provincialism and
American bluntness, larger stakes are in play. Old French family
companies are under pressure to perform or be taken over. And the
way companies protect themselves is a hot topic of corporate and
political debate. Moreover, luxury products are hot now, and the

   MICROSOFT _ WASHINGTON _ Washington _ To a beset Microsoft Corp,
it is the trial that should be, one that puts top honchos Bill
Gates and Steve Ballmer on the witness stand to show why a
corporate breakup fails to fit its purported antitrust crimes and
would likely not only ruin its business but also set back the New
Economy. For Microsoft critics, it was the trial that should have
been, the moment missed when Gates instead came across in the
courtroom on videotape as an ignorant lout. But for judge who tried
the case, now ready to bring down a heavy hammer on the software

OUTSTANDING EFFORT PUTS NIXON IN WITH FANS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Trot Nixon was a star high school quarterback in North Carolina
who was wooed by North Carolina State before signing with the Red
Sox, and sometimes it looks as if he's playing football on the
diamond. There is no more relentless player in Major League
Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday night's performance was extreme even by Nixon's
rugged standards. In the fifth inning, he seemed hellbent for
self-destruction when he somersaulted into the right-field stands
at Fenway Park in a vain attempt to grab a foul by Blue Jays
designated hitter Marty Cordova.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon disappeared into the crowd for almost a minute before
resurfacing clutching his sternum. After being examined by physical
therapist Rich Zawacki, he remained in the game, receiving a
resounding ovation from the crowd of 31,250. The 3,000 or so
survivors in the stands were even more appreciative several hours
later when Nixon's two-out, 11th-inning single set up Brian
Daubach's three-run homer that gave Boston a vital 6-3 victory. ``A
lot of people will think that was ridiculous, but I really thought
I had a bead on the ball,'' said Nixon. ``I get in the outfield and
I'm in a zone. It felt like I was playing football again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nixon could have used the home-field advantage on this play. But
the fan nearest where he landed was more interested in dining than
helping the Red Sox' cause. ``The guy was eating his hot dog,''
said Nixon. ``He never moved.''
</P>
<P>
   That didn't please Jeff Frye, who started at second base as part
of a lineup shuffle that manager Jimy Williams employed while
giving first baseman-DH Mike Stanley the night off.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frito (Frye) yelled to the guy, `Don't you know you're
supposed to put the ball in his glove?' '' said Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   The right fielder almost came up with it on his own. ``I looked
at the film, and it looked like it went off the end of my glove,''
said Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon wasn't aware of that at the time because he was
preoccupied with the pain he was feeling in his chest. ``I hit a
cast-iron seat that's been there since the turn of the century,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But the antique did no damage, though it did leave a couple of
red welts just below Nixon's neck. He would have preferred another
souvenir for his efforts.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Thrown for a loss
</P>
<P>
   Carl Everett took offense when he was hit in the back by Toronto
reliever Pedro Borbon with two out in the seventh and the score,
3-3. Everett took a step toward the mound as he headed up the
baseline and, after being restrained, glared at Borbon all the way
to first.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the lefthander came off the mound with his arms
extended and upraised, as if to say, ``Why on earth would I try to
hit you in the seventh inning of a tie game?''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Injury update
</P>
<P>
   There was no immediate word on the condition of Jose Offerman,
who left limping after drawing the 11th-inning walk that launched
the decisive rally.
</P>
<P>
   Williams believes shortstop Nomar Garciaparra (hamstring) is on
target to be activated Saturday in New York, the first day he is
eligible to come off the disabled list. ``Just me hitting grounders
out there, he's making plays to his right, plays to his left,''
said the manager, ``so I think he's feeling pretty darn good.''
</P>
<P>
   Center fielder Darren Lewis, who was on a 10-for-16 tear before
straining his left hamstring a week ago in Toronto, has been
available the past two games. ``It feels fine,'' said Lewis. ``I'm
ready to go. I'm the type of person who heals fast _ five or six
days and I'm ready to go.''
</P>
<P>
   Reliever Rod Beck (neck) threw 15 pitches in one inning of work,
striking out one, during extended spring training Tuesday in Fort
Myers, Fla. ``He threw better,'' said Williams, reviewing a report
from Florida. ``He's improving each outing.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Get in the swing
</P>
<P>
   With interleague play on the horizon, Red Sox pitchers hit for
the first time since spring training. ``Bunt, slash, swing,'' said
Williams. ``I don't know about hit. Some of those guys can hit.''
The relievers hit better than the starters. With pitching coach Joe
Kerrigan throwing in simulated game situations, the bullpen beat
the rotation by an indeterminate margin. Ramon Martinez said
Kerrigan wasn't taking it easy despite his staff's rust at the
plate: ``He was trying to get everybody out. He didn't want anybody
to get a hit. He got hit hard.''

   FOXBOROUGH _ After four losing seasons, the Revolution seem to
have found a winning touch. They have a 5-3-4 record and are in
first place in the Eastern Division after a 2-1 win Thursday night
over Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   ``Winning is contagious and not too many guys have experienced
it here,'' goalkeeper Jeff Causey said. ``Last year, we might have
gone down a goal and said, `Here we go again.' I'm not surprised by
how we are doing because we have the talent, just like any team in
the league. Maybe we have shocked everybody because we are winning.
But being in first place in the first third of the season doesn't
mean much. Now it is a matter of getting points, and it's important
to try to be in first place in the final third of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Colorado game (a 4-3 loss May 17) is always in the back of
our minds and we want to make up for it. When we get the lead, we
don't want to lose it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leonel Alvarez made a difference with a tireless performance in
midfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``He sits in the middle and organizes things,'' Causey said.
``Whether he speaks the language or not, you understand him with
his finger-pointing and he gets guys into position.''
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder John Harkes, who has missed two games with a calf
injury, is expected to return for Monday's visit to Colorado.

   Success story

   Colombia coach Chiqui Garcia has had success in the CONCACAF
region. Garcia guided Saprissa of Costa Rica to the 1995 CONCACAF
Champions Cup title with players such as Roy Myers of the
MetroStars and Paulo Wanchope of West Ham United. Garcia also
helped launch the career of Johnnier Montano, who is expected to
become the next Colombian phenomenon, while coaching America de
Cali. Montano was sent to Quilmes in Argentina and then to Parma in
Italy. Montano, 17, was prevented from joining either Colombia's
national team on this tour or the junior team in Toulon, France, to
remain with Parma for its playoff game against Inter . . . Benfica,
which was concluding a two-game tour of the US  &UR; last night &LR; , is the
most popular and historically successful club in Portugal, but the
team has struggled in recent seasons. Now, Benfica could be on the
verge of losing coach Jupp Heynckes, who may join the German
Federation as a coach, possibly of the national team. Possible
successors include Carlos Queiros, who guided Portugal to two
junior world championships and coached Sporting and the MetroStars.

WOODS FULLY IN CONTROL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ The press conference was about to begin, but an
anxious technician spotted a problem. He sprung into action, nearly
knocking over several cameras, and moved to adjust a microphone in
front of the player.
</P>
<P>
   In doing so, there was even more confusion, so Tiger Woods took
it upon himself to adjust the instrument. The technician offered
instructions, seemingly fearful that something would be destroyed.
</P>
<P>
   Woods merely smiled. ``Trust me,'' he said, ``I've done this
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, it has become such a routine for Woods. So much so
that during these past few days of lead-up to the Memorial
Tournament, an event that is the life and blood of none other than
Jack Nicklaus, it is Woods who still commands most of the
attention. Almost every time he tees it up, he appears to be the
defending champion and that is the case here at Muirfield Village
Golf Club, where Round 1 begins Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago when he came to Nicklaus Country, Woods was still
tuning up a swing that had been reworked from those wild days of
1996-1998, when wedges would sometimes fly 120 yards, other times
165. The distance control was OK at The Memorial a year ago, but
his direction was slightly off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was pretty neat,'' said Woods, flashing back to last year
when he held off Vijay Singh to win. ``I'm over there in the
jungles or the rough or the bunker or the trees, slashing it out,
on top of roots. It was fun to be that creative.''
</P>
<P>
   Fun because he closed with a 69_273, held off Singh by two
shots, and worked out the kinks in his radar enough to set in
motion a stretch of golf at which even the greatest player of our
time marvels.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody has ever played a game as well as he's
played it in the last year,'' said Nicklaus. ``I had my stretches
where I never finished out of the top 10, but (considering) the
number of good players today, to do what he has done is probably
more astounding than my record.''
</P>
<P>
   Astounding is as good an adjective as any, for Woods, counting
last year's Memorial, has won 10 of the last 19 PGA Tour events in
which he has played. Three times he has been second, four other
times top 10, and only once has he been outside the top 20. The
expression ``raising the bar'' has been tossed about so often, but
truthfully Woods has pushed it so high most of his colleagues would
need an elevator to find it.
</P>
<P>
   Does he sense that many players are not looking to win, just
cash a check when they see that Woods has entered? He smiled and
nodded his head in the affirmative.
</P>
<P>
   Does that bother him? Another wide smile. ``No. I like it.''
</P>
<P>
   What's not to like? There is more money than he will ever have
the chance to spend _ and he's still just 24. There is fame. There
is enough raw talent to lend legitimacy to the notion that he could
surpass all of Nicklaus's records, a thought that just a few years
ago could have gotten you locked up on a charge of lunacy. And
there are awards, the latest of which fell into his hands
Wednesday, something called the Laureus Award World Sportsman of
the Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It kind of blows your mind away, to have your peers all over
the world choose you,'' said Woods, carefully choosing all the
correct words, though no athlete has dominated a sport quite like
he has in the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   So efficient has he been that the mere switch of a golf ball is
headline news. Woods confirmed that he played a Nike ball in last
week's Deutsch Bank tournament in Germany (he tied for third) and
will do so again this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just testing it out,'' said Woods, who has had a business
arrangement with Titleist since he turned pro in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In professional golf circles, such a switch is an eye-opener.
Why mess with success as rich as Woods's, some colleagues wonder.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be an adjustment period. I don't care how good a
player you are,'' said Hal Sutton, whose switch to the Strata ball
has been credited with a resurgence in his career.
</P>
<P>
   Woods harbors no such fear, which shouldn't come as a surprise
to anyone who has watched him shape a 6-iron out of rough, around a
tree, and onto a green some 210 yards away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something I've always believed in is if you're going to try
something out, try it when you're playing well because then you
will actually know what's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing well? Woods certainly qualifies on that account.

`SIGNATURE' HOLD TAKES NEW MEANING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JIM MCCABE  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The closing hole at Presidents Golf Course in Quincy is a par 3
that plays uphill, anywhere from 120 to 135 yards. Like the 17
holes that precede it, the 18th is short but difficult because of a
multitude of dastardly pin placements on a green with severe slopes
that don't allow you to get your tee shot close.
</P>
<P>
   Many a good player has made bogey there. A double bogey isn't
out of the question, and chances are on any given day, golfers are
spraying tee shots right, down a hill, and scoring 7s and 8s. Never
in your wildest dreams, however, could you envision taking 43
strokes to navigate the hole.
</P>
<P>
   But it happened to one unfortunate golfer Saturday in the first
round of the Norfolk County Classic. At least according to his
scorecard, that is.
</P>
<P>
   The player actually bogeyed the 18th to complete a backside 43
for a respectable 84, which would have made the cut into Sunday's
final round. But the 43 was penciled into the box where the 18th
hole score should have been, which so far as the scorekeeper was
concerned, meant a backside 82 and 123 total.
</P>
<P>
   The misfortune occurred because the player in question, in a
rush to get to his son's Little League game, quickly looked through
his hole-by-hole scores, saw they were correct, and signed the
card. He asked his marker to submit the card, which he did _ after
adding the ``43'' backside split into the wrong box. As a result,
the player did not make it into the second round.
</P>
<P>
   An innocent mistake in a small, unheralded amateur tournament?
Absolutely.
</P>
<P>
   An unfair punishment? Not at all. For as cruel as it seems, your
signature on a scorecard is your word that that is what you shot
for the day. Remember, the game for the most part is officiated by
the players themselves, which makes it the most honorable of all
sports. There is a long-established code of conduct for tournament
golf _ professional and amateur _ and paramount is the player's
responsibility to check his or her scorecard, make sure everything
adds up, and submit as their word of honor that everything is
correct.
</P>
<P>
   Sounds simple, doesn't it?
</P>
<P>
   So why are there golfing hearts aching all over the world
because of inadvertent gaffes?
</P>
<P>
   You know by now about Padraig Harrington failing to sign his
scorecard after the first round of the Benson &AMP; Hedges
International Open two weeks ago. He shot a third-round 64 to open
a five-shot lead, but was disqualified before the final 18 because
of that first-day oversight. Instead of winning $284,000 Harrington
got nothing _ except for the humbling lesson of a lifetime.
</P>
<P>
   It was a lesson Roberto de Vicenzo learned at Augusta in 1968,
as did Jackie Pung in 1957 at the US Women's Open. And as painful
as that lesson is, at least the fellow at Presidents GC and
Harrington _ not to mention de Vicenzo and Pung _ only hurt
themselves with their carelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Which is more than we can say about Carl Pettersson, a senior at
North Carolina State, and Phil Gehring of Skidmore. Scorecard
snafus this past week robbed them of more than individual glory,
because teammates got hurt, too.
</P>
<P>
   Pettersson appeared to have shot a final-round 70 to finish at
5-under 208 during the East Regional at Glenmaura National GC in
Moosic, Pa. Not only was he medalist, but his great performance had
pushed his Wolfpack into the top 11, good for a berth in the NCAA
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Then came the terrible realization that he had goofed.
Pettersson had made a double-bogey 6 at the eighth hole, but had
signed for a bogey. He told his coach, who told tournament
officials, who did what they must do, cold-hearted as it seems _
they bid Pettersson farewell from the competition.
</P>
<P>
   Had they counted the 6, Pettersson would still have been
medalist, but no matter. You sign for a higher score than you
actually shot (such as the NCC contestant and you keep the score;
you sign for a lower score than you actually shot and you get to
wear ``DQ'' next to your name. And in team competition that means
taking down your teammates, which is what happened to Pettersson
and NC State.
</P>
<P>
   The Wolfpack could not count Pettersson's score of 70; instead,
they had to take another player's 81. Instead of 860 and a
sixth-place finish, NC State fell to 901 and 14th, meaning there
would be no NCAA tournament play this year.
</P>
<P>
   If you are wondering how Pettersson feels, you may want to ask
Gehring. He was equally careless in the third and final round of
the NCAA Division 3 championship in Michigan. He marched to the
scorer's table with his scorecard in hand, signed for a 70, and
waited with teammates to celebrate the title.
</P>
<P>
   It barely got going when horror engulfed Gehring, but not so bad
that he couldn't show that he was a player of character. Gehring
told officials he had made a bogey-5 at the seventh, not the par
that he had penciled in.
</P>
<P>
   Gehring's name went from the leaderboard to the circular bin. He
was disqualified, and his team had to instead take its fifth
player's score of 79. That pushed Skidmore from first to third, but
in one man's eyes, Gehring may have been the winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He showed a lot of integrity to come back and correct the
error,'' said John Ervin, director of events at Bedford Valley GC
in Battle Creek, Mich.
</P>
<P>
   Integrity. Golf is one of the sports that still embraces it.
It's just painful to be reminded of it through instances such as
these.

&HT;     NATION'S HIGHEST CIGARETTE TAX PUTS CRIMP ON SALES IN NEW
YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By JAMES ODATO  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ State statistics show that cigarette sales have
fallen drastically since an additional 55-cent-per-pack excise tax
made New York smokers the most heavily taxed in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   As sales dropped, state reports show that revenues from the
higher tax grew slightly to $64.6 million in April, compared with
$63.1 million in April 1999. If that pace of growth continues,
according to some observers, the state would run short of revenue
needs to finance a new health care program.
</P>
<P>
   Carton sales in April, the second month that the state was
collecting a record $11.10 in tax per carton, took a whopping 48.4
percent drop over the year before. Retailers sold 5.8 million
cartons this April compared with 11.26 million in April 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The 98 percent increase in the tax on cigarettes, which created
a per-pack tax of $1.11, took effect March 1. In March, sales
dropped 29.6 percent compared with March 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The tax increase was a controversial ingredient in the Health
Care Reform Act negotiated late last year by leaders of the
Legislature and Republican Gov. George Pataki. The tobacco revenues
are supposed to help pay for a new state health care program that
would benefit up to 1 million more people needing medical
insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``This seems to follow the pattern in the rest of the country:
Any time there is a major price hike there's a major drop off,''
said Blair Horner, legislative director for New York Public
Interest Research Group, which supported the tax boost. By year's
end, he said, after smokers adjust to the prices, the drop in sales
won't be as large.
</P>
<P>
   However, industry officials and lobbyists for retailers say they
fear the trend will be constant as purchases from Indian smoke
shops, the Internet and border states _ particularly Pennsylvania _
become habits. At the same time, smuggling is probably happening,
said Mark Smith, a spokesman for the Brown &AMP; Williamson Tobacco
Company.
</P>
<P>
   State Division of Budget spokesman Joseph Conway said the modest
growth in collections is in line with forecasts. He also said it is
too early to determine the trend.
</P>
<P>
   The state expected an additional $400 million in annual revenues
from the extra 55 cents added to each pack of cigarettes sold.
Before the increase, the state took in about $680 million in
revenues from a 56-cent excise tax.
</P>
<P>
   According to James Calvin, president of the New York Association
of Convenience Stores, the state needs to collect $33 million more
each month from the cigarette taxes to meet its objective. In
April, additional revenues were only $1.5 million higher than the
year before.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to cost taxpayers of New York hundreds of millions
of dollars to subsidize the health care programs that were supposed
to be funded by this tax increase,'' he said. He said local
governments are losing millions of dollars in sales tax revenue and
hundreds of jobs and businesses are threatened.
</P>
<P>
   Assemblyman William Parment, a Democrat from Jamestown, said
retailers in his district say they are losing business to
Pennsylvania, where the tax rate is much more favorable to smokers,
and to two American Indian reservations where a carton is $12
cheaper than off-reservation stores.

CHECHEN WAR LEAVES AIR OF HATRED, MISTRUST IN VILLAGE

<TEXT>
<P>
   MEKENSKAYA, Russia _ The makeshift cemetery in a field of
wildflowers in northern Chechnya looks unremarkable enough, just
another place of death in a republic where sudden and violent death
is everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   But the ethnic Russians who live in the village of Mekenskaya
say the 40 graves are a stark reminder of why there can never be
peace with Chechens, even now, when the Russian military's claims
of victory over separatist rebel forces.
</P>

   The people buried here died in October, when Russian warplanes
were conducting daily raids on Chechen rebel positions. During a
break in the bombing, Akhmad Ibragimov, a Chechen bus driver,
snapped. He took his rifle and went door to door, calling Russians
out into the street and gunning them down. The only people he
spared were Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Ibragimov was later apprehended by the rebels and handed over to
the victims' families, who beat him to death with metal rods. But
that brutal act of retribution did not cool the atmosphere of
hatred and mistrust.
</P>
<P>
   For Russians in Chechnya, Ibragimov's shooting spree has
symbolized the hardships they suffered after separatists declared
independence from Moscow in 1991. And although Moscow's forces
control most of Chechnya now, ethnic Russians are worried about
their future if the army ever leaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can we ever live together after what the Chechens did to
us here?'' said Valentina Furman, standing near the graves. ``The
Chechens tell us, don't get too happy with things the way they are
now. If the army goes away, we'll show you.''
</P>
<P>
   This part of Chechnya is supposed to be the success story of
Russia's campaign in restoring control over the rebellious
republic. Mekenskaya, 30 miles northwest of the capital, Grozny, is
in the heart of the region along the Terek River. People here never
supported the radical Islamic militias that make up a large part of
rebel forces still fighting in the mountains south of Grozny. If
there were ever a place where Russians and Chechens could coexist,
it was here.
</P>
<P>
   But if the Russian military's presence has brought a shaky
peace, it has not brought peace of mind to the hundreds of ethnic
Russians whose families have lived here for generations.
</P>
<P>
   Their point of view sheds light on a part of the Chechen
campaign that Moscow charges has received little attention in the
West, where most reports focus on looting, killing, and
indiscriminate bombing by Russian forces.
</P>
<P>
   The Kremlin's military offensive has certainly caused
considerable suffering among ordinary Chechens and Russians. But
Russians here say they suffered no less under the rebels: everyone
among Russian families here has a relative who was forced to leave
his apartment, or robbed, or kidnapped and held for ransom, or
murdered. Though few of the crimes have been solved, Russians blame
the Chechens.
</P>
<P>
   Most Russians have fled. In the Naur district where Mekenskaya
is located, ethnic Russians in 1991 made up 40 percent of the
population. Now only 3,000, or 10 percent, are left.
</P>
<P>
   Some Russians tried to leave, but could not find refuge outside
of Chechnya. Last October, Galina Grebtsova, whose husband was
killed during fighting in Grozny in 1995, tried to flee with her
24-year-old daughter, Sveta, to a neighboring Russian province. But
no one there wanted to give refuge to people who were born in
Chechnya, whether they were Russians or not. The Grebtsovas gave up
and returned to Grozny in December. Sveta was killed when a Russian
bomb hit their shelter as Galina was out searching for firewood
</P>
<P>
   Now, Grebtsova and several other Russian women live in the ruins
of Grozny's only Russian Orthodox Church, whose walls were
destroyed by Russian bombs and whose priest was kidnapped and
murdered by a Chechen gang. Grebtsova says not all Chechens treated
her badly, and she says there was a big difference between the
regular rebel units and Chechen outlaw gangs who thrived during the
chaos of war. But not everyone makes that distinction.
</P>
<P>
   Another family that stayed in Mekenskaya, with nowhere else to
go, was Tatyana Kukushina's. Last October, her brother, Fyodor
Minayev disappeared. He was not found until the Russian troops came
in. His body was headless, his torso had been mutilated, his hands
had been bound behind his back. His head was found later. The
murderers were never found, although Kukushina suspects they were
her next-door neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only reason they did this was because my brother was
Russian,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Russian forces withdrew from Chechnya in 1996 after a failed
two-year war against the rebels that killed tens of thousands and
turned many Chechens against Moscow forever. But when the Russian
troops returned to Chechnya last fall, ethnic Russians saw them as
saviors.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was as though we had been delivered from occupation,'' said
Maria Anasenko, 76. ``Living under the Chechens was like living
under Hitler.''
</P>
<P>
   For Chechens who live in Naur, such attitudes cause concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't tell them we are all murderers!'' one Chechen woman
passing through the graveyard shouted at Kukushina and a few
reporters. ``They'll write about it and the soldiers will take it
out on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere has dampened Moscow's efforts to bring life to
normal in Naur by restoring utilities and reopening schools and
factories. Edik Dzhemalidinov, the Chechen head of the Naur branch
of Russia's State Savings Bank, said 94 businesses had reopened
under the Russians. ``People are happier now, because they are
getting paid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Soviet Russia winery has reopened, recovering after the
still unsolved brutal killing last year of its director. The
winery's chief agronomist, Makhmat Sulayev, served a sample of its
light, white wine and raised a toast to peace.
</P>
<P>
   But peace has been fragile in Russian-controlled Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   Rebel forces have attacked Chechen civilians who sought to
negotiate with the Russian military to prevent the fighting from
harming their villages, according to reports collected by the New
York-based Human Rights Watch. Last month, a pro-Moscow
administration official in southern Chechnya was pulled out of his
car and killed.
</P>
<P>
   Nina Vasilyeva, the ethnic Russian mayor of Mekenskaya, said
signs of tension were everywhere. Her Chechen driver has refused to
work anymore because he had been threatened. Someone set fire to
the wreaths villagers hung on the graves of World War II veterans.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow says rebels are posing as civilians and waiting for a
chance to attack. ``Even the Chechens who say they are for Moscow
are often secretly against us,'' said Colonel Alexei Salyshev, an
officer at Russian police headquarters in Naur.
</P>
<P>
   Vasilyeva has asked for an increased police presence for
Mekenskaya, where 375 ethnic Russians live among 2,000 Chechens,
but she was told there were not enough men to go around.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, patrols occasionally drive by. Some Chechens clearly
see them as an occupying army, such as the woman at a market in
Naur who said: ``Things were better before the Russians came, and
they will be good again as soon as the military leaves.''

GOVERNMENT SAYS IT WILL CORRECT ECONOMIC REPORT 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: This early version will be updated as needed.) 
 By STEPHANIE STROM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ The government said Thursday that it would correct its
deliberate omission of data in its revision of statistics on
economic growth for the fourth quarter of last year when it
releases new economic figures on June 10.
</P>
<P>
   The Economic Planning Agency, which computes the gross domestic
product figures, denied that it had left data out of its
calculations because its inclusion might have shown that the
decline in economic activity in the October to December quarter was
steeper than originally reported.
</P>
<P>
   But it did say that when the data is included, the gross
domestic product in that quarter will have fallen 1.6 percent
rather than 1.43 percent, which was the figure the agency derived
in May by using an estimate rather than using available survey data
when it compiled its first revision of the figure.
</P>
<P>
   A sharper decline in the gross domestic product figure for that
period would likely make it more difficult for the government to
achieve its target of 0.6 percent economic growth in the fiscal
year that ended March 31, at a time when the ruling party is facing
an election and is keen to demonstrate its firm control of an
economy on the mend.
</P>
<P>
   The agency called a special press conference in response to
questions about a story on the omission that appeared in the New
York Times and on the paper's Web site on Tuesday. Prior to that
time, the press had not questioned the omission, although agency
officials insisted on Thursday that EPA Vice Minister Takashi
Nakanomyo had mentioned a problem with the data on capital spending
at a press conference held after the preliminary economic figures
for the fourth quarter were released on Mar. 13.
</P>
<P>
   ``The report was wrong,'' said Akira Sadahiro, head of the
agency's Economic Research Institute, according to Bloomberg News.
``There is absolutely no connection with political intentions. Our
handling of the data was rational.''
</P>
<P>
   The New York Times was not invited to the press conference. In
its original story, however, the Times quoted Masaaki Maruyama,
head of the national expenditures division of the agency, denying
any political motivation for the decision to omit data.
</P>
<P>
   Maruyama made a decision to omit information that showed that
capital spending by financial institutions had fallen far more
sharply than the agency estimated when it compiled its first
revision to the gross domestic product figure released in March.
</P>
<P>
   In its initial compilation of the gross domestic product, the
agency used an estimate of how much investment by banks, securities
houses and insurance companies had declined in the fourth quarter
by 3 percent. Based on that estimate as well as many other
components, the agency said in March that the gross domestic
product fell by 1.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, the agency replaces that estimate with data collected
in a survey it conducts when it compiles its first revision to the
gross domestic product figure.
</P>
<P>
   But the revision announced on May 11 did not include the survey
data, which showed that capital spending by financial institutions
had slid by 37.3 percent, far more than the 3 percent the agency
had anticipated and more in line with data collected by the Bank of
Japan.
</P>
<P>
   Maruyama said the agency had decided not to use the survey data
because there was no easy way to explain the discrepancy between it
and the estimate used in the original calculation. He repeated that
explanation Thursday, as did Sadahiro.

GORE'S FOREIGN POLICY ADVANTAGE APPEARS TO WANE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL KRANISH AND ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A few months ago, it was widely perceived that one
of Vice President Al Gore's biggest advantages over George W. Bush
was his foreign policy experience. Gore has spent years
globe-trotting and helping to frame Clinton administration
policies, while Bush has been portrayed as knowing little beyond
Mexico, and he famously flunked a quiz about foreign leaders.
</P>
<P>
   But Gore's foreign policy advantage may be waning. Bush went to
Capitol Hill to fight for the China bill, which passed in the House
on Wednesday, while Gore maintained a relatively low profile on the
issue because an ally, organized labor, opposes the trade measure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was glad to see the vice president finally emerge and make a
statement'' on China, Bush said Tuesday in Washington, showing
confidence in trying to turn the foreign policy issue against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   At the same forum, Bush also unveiled a national security policy
that would reduce the number of US nuclear weapons while creating a
costly new missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Flanked by a host of Republican foreign policy luminaries,
including Colin L. Powell, former chairman of the joint chiefs of
staff, and former secretaries of state George P. Shultz and Henry
A. Kissinger, Bush said: ``We should not keep weapons that our
military planners do not need.''
</P>
<P>
   All of this followed what many analysts described as a Gore
blunder on foreign policy. Last month, after much waffling, Gore
distanced himself from the administration's position on the Elian
Gonzalez case, suggesting that the custody of the Cuban boy, then
in the hands of Miami relatives, be determined by a family court.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after Gore announced his position, the Clinton
administration used force to seize the boy and return him to his
father.
</P>
<P>
   The message behind these moves, analysts said, is that Bush is
no longer shrinking from the debate over foreign policy. He has
made a tactical decision to engage Gore on numerous fronts from
missile defense to China to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``There seemed to be this notion that Bush wasn't ready on
foreign affairs,'' said William Hyland, a former editor of Foreign
Affairs magazine. ``But it is probably less an advantage then
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyland also proposed some perspective, saying the Bush-Gore
differences cannot compare to Cold War clashes, when Republicans
and Democrats debated who was soft on communism. Now, Hyland said,
the candidates agree on key foreign policy issues, and differ
mostly in ``nuances that are a little esoteric for the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Barring the outbreak of a war that involves the United States or
some other international crisis, foreign policy may turn out to be
a relatively minor campaign issue, as it was in 1996. That could
work to Bush's advantage.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore both know well that foreign policy is a fickle
campaign issue. In 1991, just before the start of the 1992
presidential campaign, Bush's father soared in public opinion polls
after winning the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Gore then repeatedly accused President Bush of
focusing too much on foreign matters and not enough on domestic
concerns, particularly the economy. That strategy played a major
role in the election of the Clinton-Gore team. This makes it
especially difficult for Gore to argue that foreign policy should
be a vital issue in this campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and Gore do have foreign policy differences. Bush wants to
build anti-ballistic missiles even if Moscow considers it a
violation of the ABM treaty; Gore wants to work with the Russians
on the issue. Bush also says he would use the US military much more
sparingly on humanitarian missions.
</P>
<P>
   But the two candidates generally share the philosophy of
internationalism that was the hallmark of President Bush and that
has animated President Clinton's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
   Governor Bush, for example, supported the Clinton
administration's use of force in Kosovo last year. And last week,
when some congressional Republicans wanted to establish a deadline
for removing US troops from Kosovo, Bush used his clout as leader
of the party's ticket to question the move, saying it would tie his
hands if he became president. Bush's action was gratefully received
by the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   If voters are looking for a distinctly different foreign policy
philosophy, they may have to turn to the likely Reform Party
candidate, Patrick J. Buchanan, an isolationist who opposes many
free-trade deals, or the Green Party candidate, Ralph Nader,
another opponent of measures such as the China deal.
</P>
<P>
   For months, foreign policy seemed to be Bush's weakest point.
Bush looked uncomfortable discussing some international matters in
early debates, and he made headlines when, asked by a television
interviewer, he was unable to name four foreign heads of state.
Since then, Bush has stepped up his foreign policy briefings.
</P>
<P>
   Nearly a year ago, retired General Brent Scowcroft, the national
security adviser for President Bush, acknowledged that the Texas
governor has little foreign policy experience. ``Is he comfortable
with foreign policy? I would say not,'' Scowcroft said last June.
But in an interview, Scowcroft said Bush has done a turnaround.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he is a little more comfortable with the shape of the
world. As he gets more comfortable, Gore's advantage does
diminish,'' said Scowcroft, who talks regularly with Bush's
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Gore is knowledgeable about international affairs, and his
experience in foreign policy could still help him in the campaign,
especially if a major issue or crisis comes up before Election Day.
But there is risk in that as well: While Gore might get credit for
a successful foreign policy decision or military action by the
administration, he also could share the blame for an unpopular move
beyond his control.
</P>
<P>
   The stylistic differences between Bush and Gore were on vivid
display this week in Washington. On Monday, Gore found himself in
the awkward position of speaking before a union group that _ like
much of organized labor _ opposes permanent trade relations with
China. So Gore mentioned his support of the China measure in a
couple of sentences and quickly moved to other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I respect your view,'' Gore said at a political conference of
the 1.4 million-member United Food and Commercial Workers. ``You
know I do not share that view. I respect the fact we have agreed to
disagree on this issue.'' Separately, United Auto Worker officials
said they may consider backing Nader this fall because both Bush
and Gore backed the China measure.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of hours later, Bush appeared before the
American-Israel Public Affairs Committee and seemed comfortable
delivering a tough, well-received foreign policy speech. On
Tuesday, Bush spelled out his missile defense plan.
</P>
<P>
   That same day, Gore, speaking to the same organization, rejected
a charge made by Bush that the Clinton administration had taken
sides in the last Israeli election. To the contrary, Gore said, it
was the administration of Bush's father that tried ``to bully
Israel'' into a peace agreement by using US loan guarantees as
leverage.

 &HT;    Prosecutors scolded for not turning over new evidence
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Bill Torpy
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Fulton County judge scolded prosecutors today for
not turning over to defendants a statement by a witness who changed
part of his story in the Buckhead stabbings case.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner ruled that prosecutors
violated the law by not turning over the new evidence, but she
denied a motion by one of the defendants for a mistrial and to
exclude the testimony of prosecution witness Jeff Gwen.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen had originally told police that NFL star Ray Lewis had
punched Richard Lollar, one of the two men stabbed to death Jan. 31
after a night of post-Super Bowl partying. Gwen later amended his
statement to say Lewis and Lollar were merely ``tussling.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Clint Rucker said there was no foul
committed by prosecutors because ``we did not hide it, conceal it
and we made the witness available to the defense for interview.''
</P>
<P>
   The law requires that any evidence favorable to a defendant must
be turned over by prosecutors to the defense. Lewis attorney Ed
Garland said the state never made Gwen available to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through a lot of hoops to get him,'' Garland told
Bonner. ``Never were we made aware of that mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Harvey, lawyer for Lewis' co-defendant, Joseph Sweeting,
said he never was informed of Gwen's change either.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 25; Sweeting, 34, of Miami; and Reginald Oakley, 31, of
Baltimore are charged with murder in the stabbing deaths of Lollar,
24, and Jacinth Baker, 21, both of Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge's ruling, Oakley's other lawyer, David Wolfe,
started the morning cross-examining Gwen, an Akron, Ohio, man who
was a friend of the victims and who has cut a rap CD, using the
stage name Chino Nino. Gwen, the victims, who were natives of
Akron, and several other Ohio friends were leaving the Cobalt
lounge minutes before the deadly fight occurred. Lewis and his
friends also were leaving the club.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe waded in on Gwen, reciting lyrics in the CD, trying to
portray Gwen as both a man who revels in violence and who lives a
split personality.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer asked Gwen, dressed in a blue jean jacket, what does,
``We're strapped'' mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a pistol,'' Gwen responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does `We're strapped and ready to tear up the club mean'
?'' Wolfe asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean I do that,'' Gwen responded.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen had testified on Wednesday that his initial account of
Lewis striking Lollar was ``a mistake.'' Instead, he said Lewis and
Lollar both grabbed at each other's shoulders and pulled each other
back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen is one of only two witnesses who have told police they saw
Lewis throwing punches during the melee. Lewis' limousine driver,
Duane Fassett, is the other.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen is a key figure in the case because his words caused a
misunderstanding that led to the deadly melee. Gwen said he left
the Cobalt lounge and discovered his ride had left him but saw
Akron friend Chris Shinholster, who said he'd give him a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen complained to Shinholster, using a profanity-laced racial
epithet.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, who was walking by, overhead Gwen and rushed back at
them, Gwen and Shinholster testified.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis walked up and grabbed Oakley around the waist, pulling him
toward the limousine parked on East Paces Ferry Road. Gwen said he
saw Oakley holding a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Another man told them to stay back. That man held a knife but
was not a defendant, the two men testified. The two Akron men
testified this man was dressed in black, although Gwen said he wore
a leather jacket and Shinholster said he wore a mink coat. Gwen
also said that, during the ensuing fight, this man swung at him
with the knife.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, both Gwen and Shinholster admitted they
were drinking and smoking cigar-sized marijuana ``blunts.''
</P>
<P>
   After court adjourned, Rucker, when asked about this
unidentified man, said, ``We're still dealing with that,'' and
indicated that the state's investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Lollar were walking behind Gwen and Shinholster. As
they passed the limo, Gwen said he heard Lollar say, ``(Expletive)
them, (racial epithet), this is OH-10,'' a reference to their
native Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley then came out of the limo and Baker smashed a champagne
bottle over his head, Gwen said, noting that he later saw Oakley
pull Baker's coat over his head and punch him four or five times in
the chest area. Baker died of stab wounds to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Shinholster, a stocky construction worker, testified that after
Baker popped Oakley with the champagne bottle, he ran up and
appealed to the football star to control Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when Ray Lewis ran up'' to the fight, Shinholster said.
Lewis did not have a knife, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him to grab his dude; I asked him two or three
times,'' Shinholster testified. Lewis did not break up the fight,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He then heard Lollar scream, ``Get your hands off my cousin,''
referring to Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Shinholster said he then saw Oakley shaking Baker, who appeared
to be unconscious. Shinholster ran over to Baker and grabbed him by
the foot. ``I tried to get a reaction,'' he said, adding that he
did not get one.
</P>
<P>
   He then saw Lollar walk over with his hand over his chest saying
he had been cut. ``It was in a calm manner like it was a small
cut,'' he said. But Lollar fell to the ground oozing blood and
Shinholster ran.

<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A Fulton County judge scolded prosecutors today for
not turning over to defendants a statement by a witness who changed
part of his story in the Buckhead stabbings case.
</P>
<P>
   Superior Court Judge Alice D. Bonner ruled that prosecutors
violated the law by not turning over the new evidence, but she
denied a motion by one of the defendants for a mistrial and to
exclude the testimony of prosecution witness Jeff Gwen.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen had originally told police that NFL star Ray Lewis had
punched Richard Lollar, one of the two men stabbed to death Jan. 31
after a night of post-Super Bowl partying. Gwen later amended his
statement to say Lewis and Lollar were merely ``tussling.''
</P>
<P>
   Assistant District Attorney Clint Rucker said there was no foul
committed by prosecutors because ``we did not hide it, conceal it
and we made the witness available to the defense for interview.''
</P>
<P>
   The law requires that any evidence favorable to a defendant must
be turned over by prosecutors to the defense. Lewis attorney Ed
Garland said the state never made Gwen available to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``We went through a lot of hoops to get him,'' Garland told
Bonner. ``Never were we made aware of that mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Harvey, lawyer for Lewis' co-defendant, Joseph Sweeting,
said he never was informed of Gwen's change either.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis, 25; Sweeting, 34, of Miami; and Reginald Oakley, 31, of
Baltimore are charged with murder in the stabbing deaths of Lollar,
24, and Jacinth Baker, 21, both of Decatur.
</P>
<P>
   After the judge's ruling, Oakley's other lawyer, David Wolfe,
started the morning cross-examining Gwen, an Akron, Ohio, man who
was a friend of the victims and who has cut a rap CD, using the
stage name Chino Nino. Gwen, the victims, who were natives of
Akron, and several other Ohio friends were leaving the Cobalt
lounge minutes before the deadly fight occurred. Lewis and his
friends also were leaving the club.
</P>
<P>
   Wolfe waded in on Gwen, reciting lyrics in the CD, trying to
portray Gwen as both a man who revels in violence and who lives a
split personality.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer asked Gwen, dressed in a blue jean jacket, what does,
``We're strapped'' mean?
</P>
<P>
   ``Having a pistol,'' Gwen responded.
</P>
<P>
   ``What does `We're strapped and ready to tear up the club mean'
?'' Wolfe asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't mean I do that,'' Gwen responded.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen had testified on Wednesday that his initial account of
Lewis striking Lollar was ``a mistake.'' Instead, he said Lewis and
Lollar both grabbed at each other's shoulders and pulled each other
back and forth.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen is one of only two witnesses who have told police they saw
Lewis throwing punches during the melee. Lewis' limousine driver,
Duane Fassett, is the other.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen is a key figure in the case because his words caused a
misunderstanding that led to the deadly melee. Gwen said he left
the Cobalt lounge and discovered his ride had left him but saw
Akron friend Chris Shinholster, who said he'd give him a ride.
</P>
<P>
   Gwen complained to Shinholster, using a profanity-laced racial
epithet.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley, who was walking by, overhead Gwen and rushed back at
them, Gwen and Shinholster testified.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis walked up and grabbed Oakley around the waist, pulling him
toward the limousine parked on East Paces Ferry Road. Gwen said he
saw Oakley holding a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Another man told them to stay back. That man held a knife but
was not a defendant, the two men testified. The two Akron men
testified this man was dressed in black, although Gwen said he wore
a leather jacket and Shinholster said he wore a mink coat. Gwen
also said that, during the ensuing fight, this man swung at him
with the knife.
</P>
<P>
   Under cross-examination, both Gwen and Shinholster admitted they
were drinking and smoking cigar-sized marijuana ``blunts.''
</P>
<P>
   After court adjourned, Rucker, when asked about this
unidentified man, said, ``We're still dealing with that,'' and
indicated that the state's investigation is continuing.
</P>
<P>
   Baker and Lollar were walking behind Gwen and Shinholster. As
they passed the limo, Gwen said he heard Lollar say, ``(Expletive)
them, (racial epithet), this is OH-10,'' a reference to their
native Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   Oakley then came out of the limo and Baker smashed a champagne
bottle over his head, Gwen said, noting that he later saw Oakley
pull Baker's coat over his head and punch him four or five times in
the chest area. Baker died of stab wounds to the chest.
</P>
<P>
   Shinholster, a stocky construction worker, testified that after
Baker popped Oakley with the champagne bottle, he ran up and
appealed to the football star to control Oakley.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's when Ray Lewis ran up'' to the fight, Shinholster said.
Lewis did not have a knife, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I asked him to grab his dude; I asked him two or three
times,'' Shinholster testified. Lewis did not break up the fight,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   He then heard Lollar scream, ``Get your hands off my cousin,''
referring to Baker.
</P>
<P>
   Shinholster said he then saw Oakley shaking Baker, who appeared
to be unconscious. Shinholster ran over to Baker and grabbed him by
the foot. ``I tried to get a reaction,'' he said, adding that he
did not get one.
</P>
<P>
   He then saw Lollar walk over with his hand over his chest saying
he had been cut. ``It was in a calm manner like it was a small
cut,'' he said. But Lollar fell to the ground oozing blood and
Shinholster ran.

<P>
   BOSTON _ As six TV crews, three photographers and a bevy of
others eagerly recorded the event, state biologist Tom French
lifted a cardboard lid and introduced the world to the newest
residents of Boston's historic Custom House: four downy peregrine
falcon chicks, tiny symbols of one of the most unlikely wildlife
recoveries in history.
</P>
<P>
   The squawking three-week-old chicks, the largest clutch of
falcons born in Massachusetts this year, underscored the majestic
hunters' return from the edge of extinction, thanks in part to
their fondness for urban living. The parents can provide a steady
diet of pigeons and other city birds for their young perched 30
floors up. And by all accounts earlier this week, these chicks were
thriving.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras loved them. As French, assistant director with the
state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, attached identification
bands to the birds and their parents angrily waited outside, the
chicks became fledgling media stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been around,'' said French of the frantic parents, who
have been nesting longer than any other peregrine falcon pair in
New England. ``They know what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been almost a year since peregrine falcons were taken off
the national Endangered Species List as they rebounded from the
devastating effects of pesticides such as DDT, and destruction of
their habitat. And while the birds remain on MassWildlife's
endangered list after only five pair have nested in the state,
that's a big improvement over 45 years ago, when there were no
falcons at all.
</P>
<P>
   Under the watchful eye of people such as French, who have built
falcon nests on top of skyscrapers from Boston to Chicago, the
birds have found that tall buildings make excellent hunting posts.
Of the 1,650 pairs of peregrine falcons in the nation last year,
experts estimate that 10 percent live in cities, including all of
the Massachusetts falcons.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a banner spring for Boston's falcons, in particular.
One pair sits atop the Custom House and two pair are nesting atop
the landmark Christian Science Church. Springfield and Fall River
are home to the other pairs.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the fastest flying bird in the world, the peregrine
falcon reaches speeds of up to 200 miles per hour while diving for
prey, which is often snagged in mid-flight. French said he has
found the remnants of 85 bird species discarded around the Custom
House nest site. The leg of a red winged blackbird, found on the
building's observatory deck Wednesday, probably came from the
marshes surrounding Logan International Airport, a favorite hunting
ground, French said.
</P>
<P>
   Switching homes between the Post Office Building and the Custom
House, Boston's peregrine falcons have been coming here since 1986,
when the enclosed nest at the Custom House was built. A year later,
another female falcon attacked and killed the female in the nest,
taking over both her mate and domain. The unique pair _ a
14-year-old male and a 9-year-old female _ have been coming back
here ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Boston's reaction to the ongoing falcon soap opera in its
midst has been tame compared to other places in Massachusetts. In
Springfield, live coverage of a similar peregrine falcon nest is
broadcast citywide. In Turner's Falls, they broadcast an eagle's
nest.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists say media attention helps raise awareness about such
birds, which have thrived in other urban environments like New York
City and Chicago. But adoring humans can become a problem if they
start to think of the falcons as pets rather than the wild animals
they are.
</P>
<P>
   In Springfield, which named its minor league hockey franchise
after the falcons, local school children have named them, and one
of the birds was stuffed after it dive-bombed into the side of the
building. When the pair didn't show up one year, their absence made
news.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, after one of the Springfield chicks became sick,
French said the phone calls never stopped as viewers demanded that
the bird be rescued. When the chick died, cable programmers had to
run a disclaimer along the bottom of the broadcast reminding people
to change the channel if disturbed by the carcass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people calling for two days,'' French said, adding that
he and other biologists tending the nest chose not to remove the
carcass. ``All the other years were great. And, here we had a
death, and people suddenly realized it's not Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk of similar broadcasts in Boston, but it has
never caught on here, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowded top of the Custom House tower, French was asked
if the birds have names _ they don't _ while officials from
Marriott, which owns the building, got some pictures with the
chicks.
</P>
<P>
   But before the chicks were brought down to be tagged, a strange
thing happened. Outside, sitting on the narrow ledge outside one of
the windows, the chick's mother perched and, for more than two
minutes, checked out what was going on inside.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras whirred, and as the stare-off continued, it suddenly
was hard to tell who was watching who.

THE NEW BLACKLISTERS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You can hear arguments for and against same-sex marriage. You
can hear arguments for and against gays in the military. You can
hear arguments for and against taking the Bible's condemnation of
homosexuality literally.
</P>
<P>
   Should openly gay scoutmasters be allowed in the Boy Scouts?
Should ``gay pride'' be celebrated with flamboyant parades? Should
churches ordain gay and lesbian clergy? You can hear arguments for
and against each proposition.
</P>
<P>
   Or can you?
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, gay activists are insisting that you not be
allowed to hear the arguments for and against. Instead of trying to
refute opinions they don't share, the new strategy is to label them
``hateful'' or ``dangerous'' and to silence the people making them.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign to kill the ``Dr. Laura'' TV show before it debuts
this fall is an alarming case in point.
</P>
<P>
   Laura Schlessinger's views are anathema to many. A moral
traditionalist, she makes it clear that she disapproves of
homosexuality. It is a form of ``deviant sexual behavior,'' she
says _ the result of a ``biological error'' that impedes gays and
lesbians from being attracted to the opposite sex.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuality is hardly the only practice Schlessinger
disapproves of, as anyone who listens to her knows. She opposes
premarital sex, abortion, single motherhood, serial marriage,
people who cheat on their spouses, working parents who put their
children in day care, and most divorce. She is rigid and censorious
and blunt. She is also stunningly popular, far and away the most
successful woman in radio history and the author of four
bestselling books. In the marketplace of ideas, she has found many
takers.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, she also has many detractors, who denounce her
views as ``homophobia'' and bigotry. But rather than debate those
views, her opponents aim to suppress them. They are aggressively
lobbying Paramount to cancel ``Dr. Laura,'' flooding TV stations
that have signed up to carry it with letters and calls of protest,
and putting pressure on advertisers to shun not only the TV show
but the radio program as well. Last week Procter &AMP; Gamble yielded
to the pressure, dropping its plan to sponsor the new program. A
few days earlier United Airlines announced it would no longer run
ads for Schlessinger's radio show in its in-flight magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, activists on the left hated blacklists and
loved free speech. They embraced the classic position attributed to
Voltaire: I disagree with what you say, but I will defend to the
death your right to say it. Gay-rights advocates especially
appealed for tolerance. Live and let live, they said. To each his
own. Be open-minded.
</P>
<P>
   No more. ``Tolerance'' now means no tolerance for speakers whose
opinions on homosexuality are politically incorrect. We don't like
what Dr. Laura says; therefore, she may not say it.
</P>
<P>
   It isn't only Dr. Laura.
</P>
<P>
   On a growing number of college campuses, evangelical student
groups are being punished for adhering to traditional Christian
views on homosexuality. When the Christian Fellowship at Tufts
University would not allow a lesbian member to run for a leadership
post _ not because of her sexual orientation, but because she
rejected the group's belief that homosexual activity is wrong _ it
was stripped of its status as a legitimate campus organization.
That meant it lost its student government funding and the right to
use ``Tufts'' in its name, and was barred from communicating
through university channels.)
</P>
<P>
   The ruling was later overturned on due process grounds, but may
be reimposed in the fall. Meanwhile, there has been no reprieve for
the Christian Fellowship at Grinnell College in Iowa, which was
``derecognized'' in 1997. Similar campaigns to penalize
evangelicals are underway at Middlebury College in Vermont, Whitman
College in Washington, and Ball State University in Indiana.
</P>
<P>
   Those leading the assault on the Christian groups claim they
simply want to stop discrimination against gays. But the religious
fellowships don't discriminate against gays; they welcome members
of any sexual identity. The groups do, however, insist on the right
to decide what they believe, and that is what the campus
inquisitors cannot abide. Like the protesters trying to get the
plug pulled on Dr. Laura, they demand outward ideological
conformity. No one may dissent from their particular gay agenda,
and those who do must be stifled. As this intolerant ``tolerance''
spreads, so does the chill it generates.
</P>
<P>
   Last month The New York Times reported on three religious
scholars _ ``respected Protestant theologians'' and ``thoughtful
conservatives'' all _ who had been invited to join a televised
discussion of same-sex marriage and the ordination of gay
ministers. Each refused, afraid of being vilified as ``antigay and
anticompassion'' if he deviated from the liberal line. None of the
three would even allow the Times to quote him by name. One said he
worried about family members who ``had felt the `heat' for his
previous public statements.''
</P>
<P>
   Intimidation, censorship, blacklisting, ``derecognition'' _
these are the coward's ways to win an argument. Those who believe
in gay rights used to also believe in reason, persuasion, and the
free exchange of ideas. What happened?

   BOSTON _ A rare opportunity to time-travel into Boston's
Edwardian era will be offered in a series of events sponsored by
Beacon Hill's Church of the Advent, at the corner of Mt. Vernon and
Brimmer streets on Beacon Hill, and the International Design
Symposium, an organization that hosts flower-arranging exhibitions
and study tours and that is celebrating its 25th anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   The Advent 2000 committee of the church will host an Edwardian
Tea June 14 at 5:30 and 8 p.m., with actress Jessa Piaia playing
the role of Isabella Stewart Gardner, a congregation member at the
turn of the century. Founded in 1844, the Church of the Advent was
the first Anglo-Catholic parish in the United States, and the
notable 1880 building, designed by Boston architect John Hubbard
Sturgis, is a jewel-like version of early English Gothic style.
Advance reservations at $20 per person are required.
</P>
<P>
   Floral designers from many countries will participate in an
International Festival of Flowers, which will be previewed June 16
at 6:45 p.m. at the church. Seldom-seen sacred vessels inspired by
the the Gothic Revival and Arts &AMP; Crafts movements will be on
display, along with scores of arrangements, including a Victorian
carpet of flowers. A 7:30 p.m. concert of voices and instruments
from several historic periods will include the Choir of the Church
of the Advent with Mark Dwyer on the Aeolian-Skinner organ, the
Renaissonics, and the New England Spiritual Ensemble. A reception
will follow. Tickets are $10-$35. Call 617-523-2377 for
information.
</P>
<P>
   The International Festival of Flowers will continue June 17 from
10 a.m. to 5 p.m. and June 18 from 1 to 5 p.m. (admission $5-$8).
On June 17, from 3 to 5 p.m., Gilda de Garcia of Mexico, Yasuko
Manako of Japan, Kirk Pamper of Tennessee, and Andreas Verhejien of
the Netherlands will create flower arrangements employing lighting
and music at the Copley Theatre, 225 Clarendon St., across from
Copley Square. Tickets at $25, or combined tickets at $29, include
free parking in the Boston Common Garage (stickers available at the
church). Call the IDA at 781-326-8906.

   Last week, the Garden Club of America awarded John Wheaton
Trexler the Mrs. Oakleigh Thorne Medal for outstanding achievement
in garden design at its annual meeting in Cleveland. As executive
director of the Worcester County Horticultural Society since 1984,
Trexler has been instrumental in the development of the society's
132-acre Tower Hill Botanic Garden in Boylston, including building
a 25,000-square-foot Education and Visitors Center and
14,000-square-foot Orangerie complex. Under his leadership, capital
campaigns raised $14.2 million and membership climbed from 1,000 to
4,300. He also instigated a cooperative venture with Clark
University that offers college credit courses in horticulture at
Tower Hill. He was nominated by the Worcester Garden Club.

   June 6: In 1995, the Gardens of the Back Bay walking tour took
place during a classic weather nightmare of lightning bolts,
thunderclaps, and sheets of rain. Now, five years later, Back Bay
garden club members have recovered enough to give it another try
from 10 a.m. to 5 p.m. It begins with a complimentary continental
breakfast at the Boston Center for Adult Education, 5 Commonwealth
Ave., from 9:30 to 11 a.m. Box lunches and $25 tour tickets, which
include maps, will be on sale there to benefit neighborhood street
trees. The tour includes 13 seldom-seen private interior gardens
(as well as the front gardens) and several Victorian mansions and
house museums, including the recently restored Ayer mansion.
Afternoon trolleys will provide shuttle service between the
gardens. Complimentary refreshments will be served at the elegant
Burrage house at 314 Commonwealth Ave. from 2 to 4 p.m. Tickets may

historic landscapes. This is always a good tour. Tickets in advance
are $12; $15 at the door. Plants, including cuttings from local
historic gardens, as well as refreshments, handcrafted items,
garden accessories, and books will be on sale at the Cushing house.
Proceeds support the Historical Society of Old Newbury. If you have
time, skip the box lunch and enjoy one of the area's many
restaurants. The shops in beautiful, newly vibrant downtown
Newburyport are also worth a look. From Interstate 95, take exit 57
and go 2.2 miles east on Route 113. After the intersection of State
Street, take the first left onto Fruit Street. The museum is on the
corner of Fruit and High streets. Call 978-462-2681 for information

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ As six TV crews, three photographers and a bevy of
others eagerly recorded the event, state biologist Tom French
lifted a cardboard lid and introduced the world to the newest
residents of Boston's historic Custom House: four downy peregrine
falcon chicks, tiny symbols of one of the most unlikely wildlife
recoveries in history.
</P>
<P>
   The squawking three-week-old chicks, the largest clutch of
falcons born in Massachusetts this year, underscored the majestic
hunters' return from the edge of extinction, thanks in part to
their fondness for urban living. The parents can provide a steady
diet of pigeons and other city birds for their young perched 30
floors up. And by all accounts earlier this week, these chicks were
thriving.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras loved them. As French, assistant director with the
state Division of Fisheries and Wildlife, attached identification
bands to the birds and their parents angrily waited outside, the
chicks became fledgling media stars.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've been around,'' said French of the frantic parents, who
have been nesting longer than any other peregrine falcon pair in
New England. ``They know what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   It's been almost a year since peregrine falcons were taken off
the national Endangered Species List as they rebounded from the
devastating effects of pesticides such as DDT, and destruction of
their habitat. And while the birds remain on MassWildlife's
endangered list after only five pair have nested in the state,
that's a big improvement over 45 years ago, when there were no
falcons at all.
</P>
<P>
   Under the watchful eye of people such as French, who have built
falcon nests on top of skyscrapers from Boston to Chicago, the
birds have found that tall buildings make excellent hunting posts.
Of the 1,650 pairs of peregrine falcons in the nation last year,
experts estimate that 10 percent live in cities, including all of
the Massachusetts falcons.
</P>
<P>
   It has been a banner spring for Boston's falcons, in particular.
One pair sits atop the Custom House and two pair are nesting atop
the landmark Christian Science Church. Springfield and Fall River
are home to the other pairs.
</P>
<P>
   Known as the fastest flying bird in the world, the peregrine
falcon reaches speeds of up to 200 miles per hour while diving for
prey, which is often snagged in mid-flight. French said he has
found the remnants of 85 bird species discarded around the Custom
House nest site. The leg of a red winged blackbird, found on the
building's observatory deck Wednesday, probably came from the
marshes surrounding Logan International Airport, a favorite hunting
ground, French said.
</P>
<P>
   Switching homes between the Post Office Building and the Custom
House, Boston's peregrine falcons have been coming here since 1986,
when the enclosed nest at the Custom House was built. A year later,
another female falcon attacked and killed the female in the nest,
taking over both her mate and domain. The unique pair _ a
14-year-old male and a 9-year-old female _ have been coming back
here ever since.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Boston's reaction to the ongoing falcon soap opera in its
midst has been tame compared to other places in Massachusetts. In
Springfield, live coverage of a similar peregrine falcon nest is
broadcast citywide. In Turner's Falls, they broadcast an eagle's
nest.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists say media attention helps raise awareness about such
birds, which have thrived in other urban environments like New York
City and Chicago. But adoring humans can become a problem if they
start to think of the falcons as pets rather than the wild animals
they are.
</P>
<P>
   In Springfield, which named its minor league hockey franchise
after the falcons, local school children have named them, and one
of the birds was stuffed after it dive-bombed into the side of the
building. When the pair didn't show up one year, their absence made
news.
</P>
<P>
   But this year, after one of the Springfield chicks became sick,
French said the phone calls never stopped as viewers demanded that
the bird be rescued. When the chick died, cable programmers had to
run a disclaimer along the bottom of the broadcast reminding people
to change the channel if disturbed by the carcass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had people calling for two days,'' French said, adding that
he and other biologists tending the nest chose not to remove the
carcass. ``All the other years were great. And, here we had a
death, and people suddenly realized it's not Disney.''
</P>
<P>
   There has been talk of similar broadcasts in Boston, but it has
never caught on here, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In the crowded top of the Custom House tower, French was asked
if the birds have names _ they don't _ while officials from
Marriott, which owns the building, got some pictures with the
chicks.
</P>
<P>
   But before the chicks were brought down to be tagged, a strange
thing happened. Outside, sitting on the narrow ledge outside one of
the windows, the chick's mother perched and, for more than two
minutes, checked out what was going on inside.
</P>
<P>
   The cameras whirred, and as the stare-off continued, it suddenly
was hard to tell who was watching who.

ESCAPING, PAINTBRUSH IN HAND

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   How do you revive your spirits after a day of pressure and
frustration? How do you restore your zest for life when so much of
modern living feels like a never-ending onslaught of bad news?
</P>
<P>
   This is an important question for the environmental activists
who are my friends and colleagues. This spring we targeted two
multibillion-dollar corporations, challenging the placement of yet
another cellphone antenna in a crowded eastern Massachusetts
neighborhood and playing a complicated game of political chess with
owners of the highly toxic Salem Power Plant. Now, despite some
progress, we find we know too much to be satisfied with our small
victories. Fly ash from the plant is still polluting local water
supplies, and the telecom industry will no doubt be back with other
plans.
</P>
<P>
   It seems there'll be no rest for the weary.
</P>
<P>
   The problems we're trying to ameliorate are so huge they're
capable of blotting out all of our other considerations. The
impulse to make more of a difference can fill every waking hour and
extinguish even the most enthusiastic advocate's joie de vivre.
When spring arrived and I was too busy to notice, I felt I
desperately needed an antidote to spending so much time in
opposition. I longed for a chance each week to focus on something
that didn't need reforming, especially by me.
</P>
<P>
   I decided to take up painting.
</P>
<P>
   It was Carla Mattioli's description of her watercolor classes in
Rockport that caught my attention: ``Sacred Cycle of the Plant
through Color. Includes nature observation, nature drawing and a
rejuvenating series of guided watercolor exercises on the theme of
plant metamorphosis.'' The word ``rejuvenating'' spoke directly to
my sense of spiritual exhaustion. I showed up for my first class,
ready for anything, along with one other student, a woman named
Susan.
</P>
<P>
   Mattioli believes in painting with the whole being, so we began
our first class with eurhythmic movements, visualizing various
colors as we lifted our arms and breathed deeply. Then Mattioli
gave each of us a striped sunflower seed and a round moonflower
seed. As we examined them carefully, she pointed out how easy it
would be to make wooden copies that would be identical in every way
except for the invisible life force hidden within the real seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is proof that the nonmaterial world exists,'' Mattioli
said, so we tried to capture that aspect of reality in our pencil
sketches, placing radiating fields of energy around carefully drawn
seeds. Then we painted. In lemon yellow, going from dark to light,
we indicated energy pulsing out from the center of our
water-saturated paper. Using Prussian blue, we moved from high to
low intensity back toward the center, discovering the way the
colors flowed and changed as they came together.
</P>
<P>
   The room was filled with Mattioli's deeply hued, vibrant
paintings. A fountain murmured in a corner. Outside, a warm breeze
rustled the trees. Susan and I focused on the colors swirling into
one another at the tips of our sable brushes in a process that was
totally absorbing and soothing. Two hours passed in a peaceful
color-induced haze.
</P>
<P>
   In our second class, we concentrated on the sunflower sprouts
that Mattioli provided. We stood in a circle, responding to the sun
like seedlings before we began to sketch them. When it was time to
paint, we divided our paper into yellow sky above and blue ground
below. We dropped a dot of orange into the soil. Swirling yellow
through the blue, we portrayed the energy field around the orange
seed, then drew the green that resulted upward into a stem and two
tiny leaves. We were as oblivious of time as children. My tension
vanished into the streams of color that spread gracefully over the
damp surface of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   Next week we graduate from seedlings to leaves.
</P>
<P>
   Is this art or therapy? All I can say is that when I get home,
the flowers in my garden are brighter. I'm no longer blind to the
life energy in them. In addition, the miracle that transforms a
rock-hard seed into a fragile seedling has not been lost on me. It
suggests that some power, which operates beyond the reach of
corporations or citizens, is busy pursuing its own purposes, with
or without us. It feels amazing _ yes, even rejuvenating _ to walk
through a world in which millions of seeds have simultaneously
begun reaching toward the light.
</P>
<P>
   If I've gotten this much out of blue, yellow, and a single dot
of orange, what on earth will the rest of the rainbow do?

<P>
   Reading Helen Gurley Brown's essay ``Don't Give Up on Sex After
60'' in this week's Newsweek made me want to go lie down somewhere
and take a nap. Alone.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had sex last night. I'm 78, and my husband, movie producer
David Brown, is 83,'' the eternal Cosmo Girl begins.
</P>
<P>
   Let's pause for a moment and try to erase the image of the
wraithlike Brown and her spry husband gamely going at it.
</P>
<P>
   Can't get it out of your head, can you? Neither can I.
</P>
<P>
   Brown's essay is part of Newsweek's cover story, ``The Science
of Women's Sexuality.'' Female sexual dysfunction seems to be the
affliction du jour. Monday night CBS's ``48 Hours'' aired a segment
on the subject. Tuesday's USA Today had a page one story on a study
that found Viagra does nothing for women's sexual response.
</P>
<P>
   Science has known for years that the female libido declines in
the middle years. Now the search for a cure, if that's the right
word, has taken on a certain urgency. Why? Well, imagine all those
millions of men on Viagra turning to women who don't share their
pharmaceutically-induced passion and asking, ``What's wrong with
you?''
</P>
<P>
   And so, according to Newsweek, a dozen drug manufacturers are
``rushing headlong'' into research and development, trying to come
up with a pill, or something, that will do for women what Viagra
does for men. There's a lot of money in it for company that
formulates an effective drug.
</P>
<P>
   Finding a Viagra equivalent for women isn't proving to be easy.
Newsweek's John Leland writes, ``Women's satisfactions and drives
are more complex, organized as much around the health of the
relationship as the majesty that is orgasm.''
</P>
<P>
   Researchers are experimenting with all sorts of things,
including supplements of the male hormone testosterone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, great,'' my husband said when I told him about the
testosterone. ``Sex with a bearded woman. Just what I've always
wanted.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not just declining libido that causes middle-aged women to
lose interest in sex. When you get older, getting ready for sex is
so time consuming. You have to prepare for it as if it were a
three-week vacation, make sure you have all the necessary supplies
and equipment.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. First, a couple of Advil, to ward off headache. And
something to calm your intestinal tract. You don't want it acting
up in the middle of everything. Strap on the magnetic belt, so your
back won't kill you. Then the knee supports. OK, your teeth are in
place. You remembered the mouthwash. You have a battery of lotions
and lubricants at the ready. Now turn down the lights, because you
don't want him to get a good look at you. And you don't want to get
a good look at him, either.
</P>
<P>
   It's so humiliating. And it gets worse, if Brown's Newsweek
essay is anything to go by. She suggests that if you want sex but
don't have a man in your life, you should pay for one. She quotes a
``realistic'' friend: ``Between 50 and 60, sex is out there. If you
want it, you can connect. After 60, you have to supply the sled,
the snow and the dog team.''
</P>
<P>
   Is it worth it? Brown certainly thinks so, even if, as she
notes, you have to back out of the room when it's over so he won't
see ``that cellulite, those folds, those pooches.'' (You have to
hide the dog team?)
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex is one of the three best things there are,'' she writes,
``and I don't know what the other two are.''
</P>
<P>
   Chocolate? Scotch? An afternoon nap? Curling up with a magazine
that doesn't remind you of your deficiencies?

TUB SPOUT WON'T UNSCREW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER HOTTON  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; . I have done a bit of plumbing, and I want to change the
spout in my tub. The spout comes out of the tub itself, and there
are two handles for the hot and cold water. I have tried to unscrew
the spout, without success; there is some corrosion, and I don't
want to fiddle too much with it because the wall is tiled. How can
I loosen the spout?
</P>
<P>
   FRUSTRATED
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A. &LR;  If this trick doesn't work, find a plumber, who will
probably apply the same trick. Put a hammer handle in the spout to
increase the torque, and twist straight. By straight I mean do not
angle the spout as you twist. Squirt some WD-40 or Liquid Wrench
(penetrating oil) if you can get to the threads. If a hammer handle
is too big, get a smaller hammer or use a large screwdriver.
Anything to get enough torque.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; . I just finished pickling my kitchen cabinets, and they look
great. Now I want to protect that nice pickled finish. What can I
put on that will not darken or turn everything yellow?
</P>
<P>
   NANCY ELLEN CHASE, Wakefield, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A &LR; . I think the best thing you can use is a water-based
polyurethane varnish. Two coats should do it, and you will get a
minimum of yellowing. Any finish will darken, whether varnished or
not, but there is nothing you can do about that. Two caveats about
water-based polyurethane varnish: 1. It is not very resistant to
wear and tear; therefore, more coats are needed than with the
oil-based varnish. For your purposes, two coats should be OK, three
coats will be better. 2. Water-based polyurethane varnish is
milky-looking in the can, but clears up when applied. But thin
coats are essential because too thick of a coat will remain cloudy.
So, be careful and make sure all coats, particularly final ones,
are very thin.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; . You always mention putting rocks or crushed stone in a sump
hole in the basement floor, where a sump pump is located. Is there
any reason not to put in crushed stone?
</P>
<P>
   LARRY ROOT, Stow, Vermont
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A &LR; . Not really. The stone is to help keep the sump neat and
clean; earth fill would would mix with water and could clog a pump.
Ready-made sumps, comprising a perforated plastic barrel, a solid
bottom, and a hole for the pump hose, are sold at Home Depot and
other building-supply stores.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; . I have a big deck, measuring 36 feet by 16. My wife wants
to paint it. Should a deck be painted? I am a bit skeptical.
Shouldn't it be sealed or stained?
</P>
<P>
   K.W., Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A &LR; . That is a mighty big deck, and whether it should be painted
or not depends on what we are talking about. If it's the floor,
give your wife the chance to paint it, but she must do the painting
(primer and two finish coats) and she must do the maintenance:
scraping, sanding, and repainting when it peels off. This is just a
heavy-handed way of saying, do not paint. Never paint a deck floor.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, either seal it with a clear sealer or stain it with a
semitransparent stain. In both cases, only one coat is needed. The
sealer has to be renewed each year; the stain can be redone in
three to five years. In both cases, no peeling. If the deck boards
are mahogany or cedar, you do not have to seal or stain them.
</P>
<P>
   The railings and deck framework are another matter. Stain the
framework. You can also stain the railings and balusters, using a
solid latex stain. But still, no paint!
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR;  &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; . The basement floor in my 1954 ranch is weird, with a
sloping floor. It has a 12-inch drop in a 40-foot span. That is not
so bad, but there are two rooms, one with a 3-inch drop in 6 feet,
another with a 9-inch drop in 20 feet. I don't mind the long slope,
but I'd like to level the floors in the two smaller rooms. But how?
A concrete man said he'd do it for $3,600.
</P>
<P>
   CHARLIE TASH, Boston
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A &LR; . That's a lot of money to lay new concrete, but is probably
not out of line, considering its size and the skills needed to make
the floors level. And to do a proper job, I think the whole floor
should be ripped out before new concrete is laid. That, obviously,
would necessitate the high cost.
</P>
<P>
   The floor may have been sloped on purpose to allow draining of
floodwater to the low end, where a sump would gather the water and
a pump would flush it away. If you get any water in the basement by
flooding or seepage, you have to solve that problem before doing
anything.
</P>
<P>
   If you can do the two rooms for less than $3,600, go ahead. Or
do them yourself with new concrete. The walls of the rooms are your
forms, and you can make the work easier by doing half a room at a
time, to allow maneuvering room and avoid having to work in the
concrete. If you add new concrete, make sure that does not lower
the ceiling too much. The most important thing if you do it
yourself is to apply a bonding agent to the old concrete so the new
will stick properly.
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Q &LR; . Some of the slats in my gable vents went missing, and
squirrels got in the attic. I know I have to get the squirrels out
before sealing the attic, but someone suggested putting in a ridge
vent and closing the gable vents completely. Would that work, and
would a ridge vent (the person mentioned Cora-Vent) be
squirrel-proof? &UR;  &LR; KEN RAKIP, North Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; A &LR; . Those slats did not go missing; I'll bet the squirrels
chewed them out to get in. At any rate, a ridge vent is an
excellent idea, and closing the gable vents is even better because
closing them is recommended when a ridge vent is installed. Be
sure, also, to install soffit vents, a continuous vent strip going
the full length of each soffit (the underpart of the roof
overhang). Gable vents, by the way, are those at each end of the
attic.
</P>
<P>
   And make sure the old gable vents are really sealed up tight.
The squirrels found a home in the attic that is warm and dry, and
unless you dispatch them or exile them far away, they will try
their hardest to get back in. The ridge vent is squirrel-proof; at
least I have not heard of any ridge vents succumbing to rodents.

INSTANT-MESSAGING STAKES RISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By HIAWATHA BRAY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The Hyatt Harborside Hotel is an easy cab ride from
Logan Airport. The place offers a picturesque view of Boston Harbor
and the city's skyline. The hotel even boasts a water taxi to ferry
guests downtown in Venetian comfort.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Hyatt Harborside holds little appeal for the executives
of America Online Inc. None of them came to the Instant Messaging
2000 conference held here this week. Too bad. The other guests
would have welcomed AOL _ as a luncheon entree.
</P>
<P>
   AOL is by far the world leader in instant messaging, the
Internet service that lets people fire off snippets of chat to each
other. The company's Instant Messenger and I &UR;  &LR; services have about
120 million users between them, giving AOL as big a monopoly in
instant messaging as Microsoft Corp. has in desktop operating
systems. Upstarts like Odigo and CMGI Inc.'s Tribal Voice barely
register on radar.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine MCI telling its customers that they could only place
calls to other MCI subscribers. That's how AOL does instant
messaging. Its two services are incompatible with everybody else's.
That means that a user of, say, CMGI Inc.'s Tribal Voice service,
can't send messages to users of AOL Instant Messenger or ICQ.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet Engineering Task Force, one of the online world's
self-regulatory bodies, is working on a global messaging standard
that'll eliminate compatibility problems. AOL has said that it will
embrace such a standard _ one of these days.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, rival companies have sometimes tailored their
software to work with AOL's, but when they do, AOL rewrites its
code so the other messaging software no longer works. The company
says that allowing access by non-AOL message systems compromises
the security of the AOL network.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Pulver, whose company runs the conference, has a more
cynical explanation _ it's AOL's monopoly and it's sticking to it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at them more like the old Russia, where they rule with
an iron fist,'' Pulver says.
</P>
<P>
   Tribal Voice has asked the Federal Communications Commission to
intervene in the planned merger between AOL and Time Warner Inc.
The company's goal is to force AOL to open up its system now. Given
the outrage over Time Warner's idiotic decision to block ABC
Television Network programs from its cable TV systems, federal
regulators are already taking a hard look at this merger. The cries
of the instant messengers may fall on attentive ears.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are getting higher, because instant messaging isn't
just for love-struck high schoolers. Microsoft Corp. and IBM
Corp.'s Lotus Development Corp. unit are building instant messaging
into corporate software to allow teams of workers to keep track of
each other and their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Today there's little corporate use of instant messaging, but
that's changing. It's not just the ability to fire off quick notes
that businesses crave. It's the ability to always know which
employees are plugged in.
</P>
<P>
   Instant messaging systems rely on a piece of client software
that connects to the Internet. This client sends a tiny burst of
data to a server, informing the network, ``He's here.'' The network
doesn't merely know how to reach you _ it knows you're actually
online at that moment, ready for action. It's as if your telephone
knew when you arrived home and notified all your relatives that you
were available to be pestered.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, telephones are the next frontier in instant messaging.
AOL and Tribal Voice are introducing systems that will ``know''
when you switch on your cell phone. As with today's instant
messaging software, you can make yourself invisible to the network,
or visible only to certain people. A colleague will be able to type
an instant message on his computer, and it'll appear on the phone's
display screen. Or he could phone you instead because the network
has shown him that you're accepting phone calls.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind the lowbrow content of most instant message chats.
Instant messaging itself is a triumph of network intelligence.
Someday, all forms of electronic data _ Internet services, phone
calls, eventually even TV and radio _ could be based on the same
concept: customized data, served up by a network that knows us.
</P>
<P>
   It's such a big idea, I can't blame AOL for not wanting to
share. It's such a big idea that in the end, they'll have to.

CIVIL WAR'S AFTERMATH VIVIDLY EVOKED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   THE YEAR OF JUBILO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A Novel of the Civil War &QL;
</P>
<P>
   By Howard Bahr &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Henry Holt, 376 pp., $25 &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In abolitionist Henry Clay Work's song, ``the year of jubilo'' _
the time when ``the master's run'' and ``Lincoln's soldiers have
come'' _ holds the promise of ``the kingdom a-coming.'' But in
Howard Bahr's novel, June 1865, the first month of that ``year of
jubilo,'' is a dark and brutal time when the passions of the Civil
War had not been spent, but continued to flame.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Year of Jubilo'' is the second novel by Bahr, who teaches
English at a community college in Tennessee. But it will come to
most readers as his first, because his powerful and elegiac ``The
Black Flower'' received only limited circulation after its
publication in 1997 by a small Southern press _ and, as luck would
have it, was published the same month as the best-selling ``Cold
Mountain.''
</P>
<P>
   That misfortune should excuse Bahr if the first few pages of
``Jubilo'' seem to echo the homeward journey that is the center of
``Cold Mountain.'' But once Bahr has brought Gawain Harper, a
Confederate soldier, back home to the burned-out Mississippi town
where he had once taught English and where a woman named Morgan
Rhea is perhaps waiting for him, ``The Year of Jubilo'' becomes an
exploration of war's aftermath through the eyes of both soldiers
and civilians.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case with ``The Black Flower,'' Bahr is able to move
_ sometimes within the space of just a sentence or two _ from the
harsh language of brutal events to the poetry of enduring beauty.
</P>
<P>
   The occupying Union force holds only a tenuous control in
Cumberland, virtually under siege by a renegade force of
Confederate bushwhackers led by a cruelly vengeful smuggler turned
partisan commander who styles himself ``King'' Solomon Gault. The
inevitable battle is a furious charge through the Yankee camp by
Gault's renegades, who come perilously close to wiping out the
Union force and triggering a general insurrection.
</P>
<P>
   As was the case with ``The Black Flower,'' Bahr has compressed a
military action into just a very few pages, suggesting in
powerfully packed sentences whole chapters of lesser Civil War
novels: ``Gault saw the gun and drew back on the reins just enough
so that the column flowed around him. He was two files deep in the
column now, eight or ten riders ahead of him, their horses' hooves
throwing great clods of mud, and those eager ones were the first of
Gault's men to die. The canister raked them, horses reared or
tumbled headlong, men were riven, sliced, transformed. A severed
arm struck Gault in the chest, balanced an instant on the pommel,
then fell away. Gault was flecked with blood, with bits of flesh
and bone; his horse leapt over the fallen, and in an instant, he
was among the gunners.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bahr heightens the impact of these scenes by interspersing
them with tenderly domestic vignettes of townsfolk savoring the
first hopeful weeks of peace in the moments before they are swept
up in the unfolding horror. ``They were crossing the yard, Morgan
lifting her skirts from the mud, Gawain already shaping in his mind
the words he would only get to say once, so he better have them
right. A little cat had come from somewhere and was parading before
them, tail in the air. Suddenly, the cat darted away, vanished as
cats will do, and Gawain saw men running and at the same time heard
the firing down the road. But his mind refused the implications,
accepted only the weight of Morgan's arm on his own, the sound of
her laughing at the cat, their steady progress across the yard.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Year of Jubilo'' is, at its richest, a novel about
veterans, not in the familiar World War II or Vietnam War setting,
but in the distant world of the Civil War. It cannot be just
coincidence that Bahr served in Vietnam, for he has made his own
the subject of the simultaneous hopes and dreads of the returning
soldiers, returning from ``the dark adventure'' in which their old
world ``had been consumed and left them with little but the taste
of ashes for their trials.''.
</P>
<P>
   As one of Gault's embittered vets tells it, ``like many another,
he had sustained himself with the belief that the wastelands
through which he had passed had no application to him _ that if he
could just reach home, he would find it magically unchanged, the
same people walking about the streets, the ground ready for the
plow, mail waiting for him at the post office.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have all been to a strange country, all us boys,'' says a
veteran whom Harper has met on the road and who accompanies him on
his homecoming. ``I do not say that to condescend nor to elicit
sympathy, mind _ I only state it as a fact that you must agree to
if you are to begin to understand.'' And that understanding is what
Bahr wants to convey, too.
</P>
<P>
   Readers who were fortunate enough to have found ``The Black
Flower'' _ often by word of mouth or, later, in its paperback
edition _ will find that it was not a one-time-only achievement.

 ROBERT BENTLEY INC. WROTE THE MANUAL ON CAR ENTHUSIASM  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Out of public view, in a long, narrow chamber, accessed
from outside by a large door at one end, a Porsche hangs on a lift.
It is being taken apart bolt by bolt, panel by panel, wire by wire.
These are valuable parts and what happens with them will help other
Porsches, in other places, perform better and longer.
</P>
<P>
   You would not expect to find a chop shop tucked up against a
stately, wood-sheathed building that once was a luxurious home on
Massachusetts Avenue near Harvard Law School. But here it is, with
one difference: Call it a chop shop with portfolio. Because the
meticulous disassembly of autos that goes on in this room is to
chop shops what brain surgery is to the making of sweetbreads.
</P>
<P>
   This shop, and the 150-year-old, multifloored and majestic
building to which it is attached, form the headquarters of the
publishing firm Robert Bentley Inc. From this building _ as books,
on CD, and over the Internet _ flows some of the world's finest
technical writing on automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Auto manufacturers such as Porsche, Volkswagen, and Audi rely on
Bentley to produce the propietary, highly technical manuals and
technical bulletins that will be used within the industry. In
addition, Bentley publishes service manuals for auto enthusiasts
and small shops, as well as an array of enthusiast books written by
outside authors.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably not what Robert Bentley had in mind in 1950 when
he started the business _ as an importer of foreign books _ when he
could not lay hands on a copy of Kant's ``Critique of Pure
Reason.'' He went on from there to import the complete works of
Freud and charged the shrinks of that day for each book what they
charged for an hour of their time: $25.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, Bentley was importing books on the MG and had
developed a relationship with Volkswagen. Robert Bentley retired in
1979 and by 1982, when his son Michael, who is now the company's
president, took over, Bentley was a publisher, not an importer, and
autos, not philosophy and psychology, were its staple.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the book-publishing (and, in effect, the electronic)
divisions of the business are broken up into two divisions: the
``enthusiast'' segment and the professional services group.
</P>
<P>
   The need for information for both groups has grown increasingly
critical, said Michael Bentley, as cars have become ever more
complex, with advances such as fuel injection, ABS systems, and
electronic controls, and model cycles have grown increasingly
shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our idea as a company,'' Bentley said, ``is to do the best
technical writing.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is why the cars featured in their manuals are taken
apart, in painstaking order, in that shop out back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no literature to guide disassembly,'' he said. That
means that as a car is taken apart, its pieces must be spread in a
precise pattern across the shop. It can then be reassembled, with
photographs taken of the entire process.
</P>
<P>
   While not strictly part of the enthusiasts group, but certainly
available to the public, service manuals form a significant part of
the Bentley business. They offer manuals that include British
sports cars, German cars, Volvos, Saabs, Italian sports cars, and
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are for owners who want to know everything about their
BMW Z3,'' said Bentley.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they publish books by non-house authors that offer
technical, performance, and driving tips for a range of vehicles:
``The Jeep Owner's Bible,'' ``Toyota Truck and Land Cruiser Owner's
Bible,'' the ``Harley-Davidson Evolution V-Twin Bible,'' and
``Civic Duty,'' a guide to tricking out your Honda Civic.
</P>
<P>
   For the more esoteric enthusiast there are books on racing
aerodynamics, driving at high speeds, exhaust and intake systems,
fuel injection, and electronic systems. Bentley will also soon
publish the Road &AMP; Track Illustrated Automotive Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Lighter enthusiast reading includes such titles as ``A French
Kiss With Death'' about Steve McQueen and the making of the movie
``LeMans''; ``Battle for the Beetle,'' a history of Volkswagen's
resurrection from the ashes of World War II; and ``Corvette 427,''
which details one man's two-year effort to turn a 1967 drag racer
into a street-legal machine.
</P>
<P>
   There are books on American cars and trucks, books on racing
technique, heroes and history, even a book celebrating the days
when high horsepower ruled Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The professional services group is basically a propietary area.
In this part of the operation, Bentley technicians, writers, and
editors, guided by the companies for which they work _ Porsche,
Audi, Volkswagen, the aircraft engine company Pratt &AMP; Whitney _
develop technical literature for in-house use. A perpetual give and
take _ both online and in person _ between Bentley specialists and
industry experts results in detailed manuals and bulletins that
break cars and engines down to the last bolt and gasket.
</P>
<P>
   The public can access Bentley offerings through
www.bentleypublishers.com. For the industry, the portal is
www.infofoundry.com. In the near future, Bentley says, the public
will be able to get online and develop a reparte, asking Bentley
experts questions and chatting among themselves about things
automotive.
</P>
<P>
   And it all takes place in an old and stately former home across
the river in Cambridge. Not the place you'd expect to find
merchants of speed and performance. Certainly not where you'd
expect to find a chop shop _ even one with portfolio.

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was the summer of 1987, a few years before digital imaging
helped revive a billboard industry that had grown overly dependent
on Joe Camel, and Mike Auterio was excited about his first day on
the job.
</P>
<P>
   For a rookie billboard painter, Auterio had landed a dream
assignment. He and his boss were to paint a likeness of Bud Light
mascot Spuds MacKenzie onto the giant Budweiser billboard affixed
to the south face of the old Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stayed up for a whole year,'' Auterio says of a billboard
that took two weeks to paint.
</P>
<P>
   Today, high-tech printers can spit out billboard ads almost as
easily as the office copying machine can reproduce a boss's memo.
Ads are printed on big sheets of flexible vinyl that are later
tightly tied to a billboard's frame. Instead of two weeks of
painting, a new billboard can now go up in under an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Such technical advances have also almost single-handedly rescued
an industry that only a few years ago was thought to be in danger
of dying.
</P>
<P>
   In the early 1990s, critics who derided billboards as visual
pollution had reason to gloat about the medium's imminent demise,
and few would have predicted that industry would see a nearly 10
percent gain in 1999 as revenue reached $2.9 billion.
</P>
<P>
   One reason for this gloom and doom was the Internet, which
threatened to divert ad dollars away from billboards on real-world
highways to banner ads on the Web's information highway.
</P>
<P>
   Even more ominous, the tobacco industry, once the industry's
biggest client, was spending less and less on billboard advertising
every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a sense of impending doom,'' says Liz Palumbo,
president and general manager of AK Media/MA of Stoneham, &UR;  &LR; Mass.,
one of the region's largest billboard companies. ``We were under
attack.''
</P>
<P>
   But thanks to high-speed technology, the industry is on the
rebound _ even though tobacco companies stopped all cigarette
advertising on billboards last year as part of their historic
settlement with state attorneys general.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to put up new billboards so quickly has brought the
industry a host of new clients from fashion houses such as the Gap
to Hollywood studios promoting new movies.
</P>
<P>
   Even dot-com start-ups have been turning to a medium that
debuted in the mid 19th century by putting signs up along railway
lines. By one estimate, dot-coms spent $100 million on outdoor
advertising in 1999, using billboards to drive traffic to their Web
sites _ or to catch the eye perhaps of a venture capitalist zipping
by in a Mercedes or a Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   This ability to get new billboards up quickly has created new
opportunities for billboard advertisers.
</P>
<P>
   During the Boston Marathon, for example, athletic shoe and
apparel maker Adidas-Salomon AG was able to create a special
billboard campaign tailored specifically to the race. A decade ago,
when billboards took weeks to paint by hand and stayed up for
months at a time, such a campaign would have been impractical, if
not impossible.
</P>
<P>
   Fast turnaround times have made so-called teaser campaigns more
popular. Recently some billboards went up with the cryptic message
of ``Carpe noctem'' and nothing else.
</P>
<P>
   Even if a Latin scholar knew the phrase supposedly means ``seize
the night,'' the billboards offered no other information. What was
being advertised? A dating service? A light beer? A new movie?
Motorists were left to wonder for two weeks. Then new billboards
went up. There was the same ``Carpe noctem'' message only this time
there was also an image of a Milky Way candy bar.
</P>
<P>
   Movie studios, in particular, think two-week billboard teaser
campaigns are highly effective.
</P>
<P>
   Painting billboards in all kinds of weather was an arduous job,
as rookie painter Auterio quickly learned 13 years ago when he was
painted Spuds MacKenzie on the side of Boston Garden.
</P>
<P>
   On a window-washer's scaffold high above Causeway Street, young
Auterio and his boss began work by covering the billboard's
previous ad with a coat of white paint.
</P>
<P>
   When the coat dried, the two men pressed a series of stencils
over the billboard's surface. Each of the 70 or so stencils bore a
small piece of the billboard's big picture, and just making the
stencils, a job done back at the shop, took nearly a week.
</P>
<P>
   After matching the right stencil to the right spot on the
billboard, Auterio would rub charcoal over the stencil. The
charcoal would leave a faint impression of the stencil's image that
had to be quickly retraced in red pencil.
</P>
<P>
   ``You had to work fast,'' Auterio says. ``Or the wind would blow
away the charcoal dust, and you'd have to start again.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a jigsaw puzzle coming together, the billboard's outline
would slowly take shape. Imagine a page from a paint-by-numbers
coloring book, only on the grand scale, and that was what Auterio
and his boss had to show for many days of work. To finish the job,
the pair used oil paints to color between the lines left by the
stencils.
</P>
<P>
   These days, as AK Media/MA's production manager, Auterio has
left his paint brush behind and taken up with the computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to work outdoors all the time, rain or shine,'' he
says. ``Now I work indoors.''
</P>
<P>
   When billboards were painted by hand, many big advertisers
stayed away from them. In the days of pencil and paint, putting up
200 billboards could mean using 200 different teams of painters,
and results were rarely uniform.
</P>
<P>
   That was unacceptable to fashion houses, which insist on
magazine-quality images that can be perfectly reproduced.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't just that the skill of individual painters varied
widely. Their speed varied too. Some were fast. Some weren't.
</P>
<P>
   That was another drawback. When using TV, print, and billboard
ads, many advertisers aim to launch all phases of an ad campaign at
the same time, notes Francis J. Kelly III, chief marketing officer
of Arnold Communciations, a Boston ad agency.
</P>
<P>
   In the days of painting by hand, putting up 200 or 300 new
billboards around the country within a few days of one another
could be a logistical challenge.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with digital imaging, billboard companies can guarantee
uniform results and timely installation.
</P>
<P>
   Putting up a billboard now differs a great deal from the days
when painters such as Auterio swayed high over Causeway Street.
</P>
<P>
   Today the process begins with an advertiser and its ad agency
agreeing on the image and message of a billboard ad. Next, a dummy
of the image is sent to a special printing shop, where it can be
replicated hundreds of times. At this point, a billboard is a sheet
of vinyl, which is often rolled up in a tube for shipping to
billboard companies across the country.
</P>
<P>
   To put up a new billboard, a company such as AK Media/MA will
dispatch a crew in a truck equipped with a crane. At a billboard
site, the vinyl is hoisted from the truck with the crane, then
lashed to the billboard's steel frame, much as a drumhead is
stretched tight over the hollow shell of a tom-tom.
</P>
<P>
   New technologies promise even more breakthroughs.
</P>
<P>
   In Boston, residents now routinely see buses ``wrapped'' in an
advertiser's message. In New York and Los Angeles, the same
techniques have been used to ``wrap'' office buildings in ads.
Could such wraps soon be spotted in the Hub?
</P>
<P>
   As cable TV stations proliferate, as more and more new magazines
hit the newsstands, many advertisers are concluding that billboards
are one of the best ways to reach consumers bombarded from all
sides by marketing messages, says Nancy Fletcher, the president of
the Outdoor Advertising Association of America, a billboard trade
group.
</P>
<P>
   Armed with remote controls, consumers have grown adept at tuning
out 30-second TV ads. But as consumers spend more and more time
commuting in their cars, Fletcher says, billboards have emerged as
``the last unavoidable medium.''

TOYOTA MR2 GIVES MIATA A RUN FOR ITS MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Move over Miata. You've got serious company.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after putting the MR2 out to pasture, Toyota has
brought it back, and it is so many things the end-of-model-line
MR2s, produced from 1985 to 1995, were not.
</P>
<P>
   The new MR2 Spyder is light _ more bang from a smaller, lighter
engine _ has better suspension and a stiffer body, and a
Porsche-derivative look that's bound to appeal to young buyers,
providing dealers do not price gouge them out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   At just over $23,000, Toyota has entered a market dominated
since the late 1980s by Mazda's Miata, the car credited with
restoring the two-seater droptop to the American scene.
</P>
<P>
   Why Toyota ever left this market wide open to Mazda is unclear,
but then again, Toyota faltered at the young end of the market
throughout its model range. That's why, this year, besides the MR2,
Toyota is coming out with the new Echo and a spiffed up Celica
Sports Coupe.
</P>
<P>
   With its Boxster-like side air scoops, prominent fenders framing
a wedge-away nose, and chopped rear end, the MR2 has got the look.
It's also got the snap that both young drivers and older sports car
aficionados will appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Celica GTS 1.8-liter, twin-cam, four-cylinder, the MR2
matches Miata power at nearly 140 horsepower. But at around 2,200
pounds, it is 200 pounds lighter. Plus, the transverse mount,
midengine setup gives you not only the sound and sensation of a
high-performance car, but also a better feel on the road than you
get with the Miata.
</P>
<P>
   That's not saying the MR2 is a match for Honda's S2000 _ the
redline 9,000, six-speed screamer _ but even factoring for gouging
on both models, the MR2 is still about $7,000 cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   It is about three inches shorter than the Miata, yet has a
wheelbase that's seven inches longer. This adds not only to
performance, but also gives better legroom in the cockpit. In fact,
even a tall person, seat pushed back, can recline comfortably
behind the wheel. With this in mind, Toyota made the seat cushions
long. They also made the seatbacks quite high for good head and
neck support.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, it is delightfully simple. The three-gauge
grouping behind the wheel features retro black-on-white lettering
and it glows a warm orange at night. Climate control dials are big.
Buttons for audio control are big.
</P>
<P>
   The manual convertible top is easy to use _ two levers and a
little elbow grease and it is stored neatly away. A wind deflector
behind the seats cuts down on cockpit turmoil when the top is down.
When up, wind noise is noticeable but not distracting. It's not as
tight a top as you find on the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder, but that
top does not rest on as good a car. The glass window in the MR2 top
is clear and heated and visibility through it is excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you could fix the problem without changing the essence
of the MR2, but it has very little storage space. Decent glove box,
small bins in the doors, a dual-door pocket of space behind the
seats _ but nowhere to put an actual suitcase or even a large soft
bag. If you go on the road in the MR2, you'll have to pack lightly
unless you can find a luggage rack for the short rear deck.
</P>
<P>
   But I suspect folks will pay more attention to how the MR2 gets
them where they are going than they will to the things they can
carry.
</P>
<P>
   So another comparison is in order.
</P>
<P>
   The Miata, it seems to me, is more ``English'' in feel. It's got
that certain drift-then-correct quality that I remember from MGs.
</P>
<P>
   The MR2? Call it Teutonic. It slices, cuts, grips the road. Only
on uphill twists did I feel a slight unweighting going on up front.
</P>
<P>
   The ride, with a throaty burble of the engine emanating from
behind you, is choppy, as is common in these stiff two-seaters. And
this is a stiff car, supported by struts all around, stabilizer
bars front and rear, and trailing arms in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Anchored in your seat, you feel the pull to the sides as you
corner, but it's not a sense that you will body-roll out of your
seat. It's more as if you are part of the car, feeling what its
suspension is sensing. This is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed manual transmission was crisp and the torque band
was steady right up to as fast as you ought to go and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota offers few options on the MR2, and that makes its
standard equipment _ air conditioning, ABS _ part of a good
bargain. Add 10-inch discs to the ABS and you have formidable
stopping power.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is planning to sell only about 5,000 MR2s per year right
now, and that opens the doors to price gouging. And though Toyota
folks told me they have stressed to dealers that this should not
happen, doubtless it will.
</P>
<P>
   A final comparison between the Miata and MR2? The MR2 is more
fun. With the Miata and its trunk, you can take more with you.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The golden glow that rises subtly to the fender tips from each
bug-eyed headlight and helps you keep track of your front corners
at night.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --Window controls placed back on the center console. They are
hard to get at because you have to work your way around the hand
brake.

 ROBERT BENTLEY INC. WROTE THE MANUAL ON CAR ENTHUSIASM  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Out of public view, in a long, narrow chamber, accessed
from outside by a large door at one end, a Porsche hangs on a lift.
It is being taken apart bolt by bolt, panel by panel, wire by wire.
These are valuable parts and what happens with them will help other
Porsches, in other places, perform better and longer.
</P>
<P>
   You would not expect to find a chop shop tucked up against a
stately, wood-sheathed building that once was a luxurious home on
Massachusetts Avenue near Harvard Law School. But here it is, with
one difference: Call it a chop shop with portfolio. Because the
meticulous disassembly of autos that goes on in this room is to
chop shops what brain surgery is to the making of sweetbreads.
</P>
<P>
   This shop, and the 150-year-old, multifloored and majestic
building to which it is attached, form the headquarters of the
publishing firm Robert Bentley Inc. From this building _ as books,
on CD, and over the Internet _ flows some of the world's finest
technical writing on automobiles.
</P>
<P>
   Auto manufacturers such as Porsche, Volkswagen, and Audi rely on
Bentley to produce the propietary, highly technical manuals and
technical bulletins that will be used within the industry. In
addition, Bentley publishes service manuals for auto enthusiasts
and small shops, as well as an array of enthusiast books written by
outside authors.
</P>
<P>
   It is probably not what Robert Bentley had in mind in 1950 when
he started the business _ as an importer of foreign books _ when he
could not lay hands on a copy of Kant's ``Critique of Pure
Reason.'' He went on from there to import the complete works of
Freud and charged the shrinks of that day for each book what they
charged for an hour of their time: $25.
</P>
<P>
   By the 1970s, Bentley was importing books on the MG and had
developed a relationship with Volkswagen. Robert Bentley retired in
1979 and by 1982, when his son Michael, who is now the company's
president, took over, Bentley was a publisher, not an importer, and
autos, not philosophy and psychology, were its staple.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the book-publishing (and, in effect, the electronic)
divisions of the business are broken up into two divisions: the
``enthusiast'' segment and the professional services group.
</P>
<P>
   The need for information for both groups has grown increasingly
critical, said Michael Bentley, as cars have become ever more
complex, with advances such as fuel injection, ABS systems, and
electronic controls, and model cycles have grown increasingly
shorter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our idea as a company,'' Bentley said, ``is to do the best
technical writing.''
</P>
<P>
   And that is why the cars featured in their manuals are taken
apart, in painstaking order, in that shop out back.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no literature to guide disassembly,'' he said. That
means that as a car is taken apart, its pieces must be spread in a
precise pattern across the shop. It can then be reassembled, with
photographs taken of the entire process.
</P>
<P>
   While not strictly part of the enthusiasts group, but certainly
available to the public, service manuals form a significant part of
the Bentley business. They offer manuals that include British
sports cars, German cars, Volvos, Saabs, Italian sports cars, and
others.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are for owners who want to know everything about their
BMW Z3,'' said Bentley.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, they publish books by non-house authors that offer
technical, performance, and driving tips for a range of vehicles:
``The Jeep Owner's Bible,'' ``Toyota Truck and Land Cruiser Owner's
Bible,'' the ``Harley-Davidson Evolution V-Twin Bible,'' and
``Civic Duty,'' a guide to tricking out your Honda Civic.
</P>
<P>
   For the more esoteric enthusiast there are books on racing
aerodynamics, driving at high speeds, exhaust and intake systems,
fuel injection, and electronic systems. Bentley will also soon
publish the Road &AMP; Track Illustrated Automotive Dictionary.
</P>
<P>
   Lighter enthusiast reading includes such titles as ``A French
Kiss With Death'' about Steve McQueen and the making of the movie
``LeMans''; ``Battle for the Beetle,'' a history of Volkswagen's
resurrection from the ashes of World War II; and ``Corvette 427,''
which details one man's two-year effort to turn a 1967 drag racer
into a street-legal machine.
</P>
<P>
   There are books on American cars and trucks, books on racing
technique, heroes and history, even a book celebrating the days
when high horsepower ruled Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   The professional services group is basically a propietary area.
In this part of the operation, Bentley technicians, writers, and
editors, guided by the companies for which they work _ Porsche,
Audi, Volkswagen, the aircraft engine company Pratt &AMP; Whitney _
develop technical literature for in-house use. A perpetual give and
take _ both online and in person _ between Bentley specialists and
industry experts results in detailed manuals and bulletins that
break cars and engines down to the last bolt and gasket.
</P>
<P>
   The public can access Bentley offerings through
www.bentleypublishers.com. For the industry, the portal is
www.infofoundry.com. In the near future, Bentley says, the public
will be able to get online and develop a reparte, asking Bentley
experts questions and chatting among themselves about things
automotive.
</P>
<P>
   And it all takes place in an old and stately former home across
the river in Cambridge. Not the place you'd expect to find
merchants of speed and performance. Certainly not where you'd
expect to find a chop shop _ even one with portfolio.

LESSONS LEARNED FROM THE TECH SLIDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   You have to say this for Thomas O'Neill: He's been consistent.
</P>
<P>
   All through last year's incredible run-up in technology stocks,
O'Neill was skeptical. The chief investment officer at FleetBoston
Financial Corp. couldn't understand why the stocks were soaring. He
said it didn't make any sense, and he said it couldn't last.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Nasdaq Composite index has dropped 37 percent from
its peak, and some tech stocks are down more like 80 percent, it
looks as if O'Neill's fears were on target. We spoke with him to
get his take on what has happened so far and what might lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Capital: What made you so suspicious about the whole tech
rally?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill: I was suspicious because the market had thrown out all
the fundamental tenets I learned about investing. People were
engaging in the most speculative form of investing, price momentum.
People were buying stocks because stocks were going up. It was like
a chain letter. And the professionals were telling you that they
didn't believe the valuations but that tech investing was the only
thing that was working.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Capital: Do you think investors were just caught up in
the excitement of the technology itself?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill: Tech investing has always been a game of high-speed
chicken. That's its history. New technology makes old technology
obsolete. Over time all of the value created by technology stocks
has been created by 10 to 15 percent of the companies. The other 80
percent add nothing. Capitalism is tough; the weak die.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Capital: How far out of whack were stock prices at the
peak this March?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill: This was the biggest bout of speculative fever we've
witnessed in the past 100 years. There has never been a market as
speculative as the one we have just been through. Based on most
measures of valuation, this market was more than twice as extreme
as the Nifty Fifty market of the early 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Capital: Do you think the fever has broken?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill: The fever has broken. More than that, I don't think in
my lifetime we will ever again see the level of speculation we have
just seen. All people were looking at was the reward. There was no
analysis of risk. And guys like us were regarded as fuddy-duddies
for stressing fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Capital: And now?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill: Now we have reintroduced risk to the equation. Now if
someone is pushing one of these ``story'' stocks, investors are
going to ask: What does the company do? Whom do they compete with?
When will they earn money? Once you ask those questions, you can't
get to the crazy valuations we have witnessed.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Capital: A while back you predicted that the big tech
stocks like Cisco Systems and Oracle Corp. would be the last to
fall. Was that inevitable?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill: Don't get me wrong. These are great companies. But they
had reached prices where it was hard for an investor to make any
returns. These stocks could still have room to contract more or
they could stay in a trading range. If you look at history, once
stocks like IBM and McDonald's reached a certain point there was so
much good news already discounted by the market that the stocks
never moved. And, God forbid, one of these companies should
experience a slowdown in their fundamentals, and believe me, some
of them will. Then prices could fall dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Capital: While you were shaking your head at the new
economy stocks you were recommending old economy stocks? Are you
still?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill. Yes. During the tech craze you got the impression we
were all just going to be sitting around nude staring at our
computer screens all day. It was as if we were never going to eat
or get dressed again. There are still many companies in the real
economy that sell at attractive valuations.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Capital: Such as?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill: TJX is a great off-price retailer. At 10 times earnings
it is priced very attractively. This bank (FleetBoston) is another.
Everest Reinsurance is another. There are companies in finance,
retailing, and health care that are good buys if you do your
homework.
</P>
<P>
   Boston Capital: You must be assuming we are not about to go into
a recession?
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill: That's right. I am making the assumption that the world
isn't going to be ending. I think the Fed is getting near to the
end of its tightening. Greenspan is a gradualist, and we are in an
election year. Often times, the second half of an election year is
a positive period for the market.

HOME SALES DROP 6.2 PERCENT IN APRIL 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN VAMES   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sales of existing homes dropped in April as home buyers
continued to feel the pinch of higher interest rates. Existing home
sales fell 6.2 percent in April to a 4.88 million annual rate, the
National Association of Realtors reported Thursday. The decline
comes on the back of an upwardly revised March home sales gain of
9.2 percent, which was initially reported as a 1.5 percent gain
last month.
</P>
<P>
   Year-over-year, sales of preowned homes were down 6.9 percent in
April, indicating that last-year's feverish housing market has
eased significantly since the Federal Reserve begun its efforts to
raise interest rates last June. The interest rate increases were an
attempt to slow the economy, which have so far resulted in a 1.75
percentage-point gain in short-term rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the market is adjusting to generally higher mortgage
interest rates with buyers switching to adjustable-rate loans, and
in some cases buying less expensive homes,'' said Fred Flick, vice
president of economic research at the Realtors association.
</P>
<P>
   According to mortgage giant Freddie Mac, the Fed's most recent
increase in short-term rates on May 16 continued to pusar
fixed-rate mortgaged climbed to a five-year high of 8.64 percent in
theor week and 7.23 percent the prior n rates adds signifige home
buyer. F 30-year fixed-rr month than for the same mortgage today.
</P>
<P>
   But even with demand slackening, the housing market remains at
historically high levels, and home prices in most regions are
continuing to rise. The national average existing home price in
April was up 4.6 percent year-over-year to $136,700 -- almost
double the rate of overall consumer inflation during the same
period. That suggests that in addition to higher mortgage rates,
the slower housing market may in part be due to a low supply of
available homes.
</P>
<P>
   That dearth of homes, however, may be reversing. The Realtors
association said the supply of homes, measured by months' supply at
the current sales rate, rose slightly to 3.9 months in April from
3.1 months in March. But still, the supply is 22 percent
lowersupply.
</P>
<P>
   ``More sellers are placing their homes on the market, so the
tight housing situation we've seen in many areas is now beginning
to ease,'' said Dennis Cronk, president of the Realtors
association. ``Our hope is this will bring a better balance between
buyers and sellers in those areas where multiple bids on homes have
become fairly common.''
</P>
<P>
   Regionally, sales in the Northeast declined most, down 7.7
percent from March and 9.1 percent year-over-year, even though
prices in the region rose 6.3 percent versus April 1999. Home sales
in the Midwest were down 5.3 percent from March, and down 7.8
percent from the prior year while sales in the South were down 7.2
percent from the prior month and down 4.5 percent versus the prior
year. Sales in the West were down 3.7 percent from March and 8.5
percent year-over-year.

&HT;     TEXAS FEDERAL COURTS SEE LITTLE RELIEF AS CASELOADS MUSHROOM 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARO ROBBINS  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Overloaded with smugglers and undocumented
immigrants caught along the Rio Grande, the federal courts from San
Antonio to El Paso together shouldered more felony cases last year
than any other region in the nation, data show.
</P>
<P>
   This distinction, which had belonged to courts in San Diego for
at least a decade, arrives at a time when federal prosecutors along
the Texas-Mexico border are bracing for more work.
</P>
<P>
   Come July 1, several county district attorneys along the border
have said they will no longer prosecute the small but numerous drug
busts made by federal agents at international bridges and
checkpoints. The federal agents often turn over smaller cases to
local officials rather than sending them to federal courts.
</P>
<P>
   If the county district attorneys follow through with their
threats, federal prosecutors in San Antonio and Austin will be
shifted to the swamped U.S. District Courts in El Paso and possibly
Del Rio and Pecos.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, as courthouse staffs try to keep pace with deluged
dockets, they are making more mistakes, some of which have
potential to derail prosecutions, some officials say. Other errors
are fodder for appeals, however frivolous.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Attorney Bill Blagg, who oversees the San Antonio-based
Western District of Texas, is more likely to cringe than boast
about the milestone that came last year with filing nearly 3,800
felony cases, roughly four times as many as in the Dallas-based
Northern District.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather not be No. 1,'' Blagg said.
</P>
<P>
   Blagg expects to have an additional 500 cases a year once the
district attorney in El Paso stops prosecuting small drug busts
made by Customs Service and Border Patrol agents.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Blagg's counterpart in the Houston-based Southern
District of Texas expects the caseload to increase with at least
400 busts formerly handled by local prosecutors in Brownsville and
McAllen.
</P>
<P>
   Blagg sympathizes with the cash-strapped district attorneys, but
from his perspective, the small cases involve dime-a-dozen drug
couriers. Prosecuting them burns time better spent building cases
against significant smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If all we do is prosecute `mules,' we're not doing our jobs
very well,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As Blagg's caseload swelled last year, Texas' Western District
barely edged past California's Southern District, located in San
Diego, which had outpaced its border counterparts since at least
1990.
</P>
<P>
   Prosecutors there say a budget freeze and staff vacancies caused
filings to fall slightly to 3,700. But, with several new hires,
they said they are on pace to hit 4,000 cases this year.
</P>
<P>
   At least two proposals to increase the number of judges, clerks
and other courthouse staff along the border are pending in
Congress. No one knows yet if they will win support from lawmakers
in interior states. While the bills await action in Washington,
strains are beginning to show along the border.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Bill Putnicki, the chief clerk in Texas' Western
District, wrote a colleague that his staff, forced by the onslaught
of filings to work faster, seemed to be making more mistakes.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, Putnicki noted problems with keeping track of
trial deadlines. Missing those deadlines can lead to _ but, he
said, had not yet resulted in _ charges being dismissed.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, defense lawyers are ready to capitalize on slip-ups
by judges, many of whom are doing double duty _ overseeing cases in
their own courts and helping out on the border.

FIONA APPLE THROWS HERSELF INTO HER MUSIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOAN ANDERMAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Lucky for Fiona Apple she packed her sweater, scarf,
and a full-length black coat.
</P>
<P>
   FleetBoston Pavilion opened its summer season Wednesday night,
but it felt more like a mid-winter gathering, with 2,500 fans
decked out in heavy jackets and, in one case, huddled under a wool
blanket.
</P>
<P>
   Waiflike and windblown, Apple clutched her coat around her for
protection from both the elements and, it would seem, the perils of
a large venue. She and her songs lose much in the translation to
the stage. They're like finely-cut gems that require the proper
setting to shine as fiercely as they can; in the open space, they
sacrifice definition and nuance.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say Apple didn't make a valiant effort. She was in
grand spirits, without a glimmer of the cranky, impetuous girl who
stormed off the stage at New York's Roseland Ballroom a couple of
months ago because the mix was off. Wednesday night, she pushed
hard to keep pace with the great washes of sound spewed by her
stunning five-piece band, and then pushed harder just to fill the
acres of air surrounding her _ shredding her voice during several
songs, including the show opener, the pile-driving ``On the
Bound.''
</P>
<P>
   Apple was like a feral animal on stage, caught in the emotional
maelstrom inspired by the music. She quite literally threw herself
into the songs _ flinging her limbs and her hair and her chaotic
vibrato, as well, to the winds during ``Criminal,'' a woozy and
brazen fit of honesty, and ``Mistake,'' a triumphant ode to messing
up.
</P>
<P>
   She alternately sat at the grand piano and stood center stage,
and the quieter moments found her more in control. ``Sullen Girl,''
from Apple's 1996 debut ``Tidal,'' revealed the torch singer
ambling through a smoky, dismally beautiful landscape. Likewise,
``I'll Know'' (from her recent, exquisite ``When the Pawn. . .'' )
was an agonizingly lovely study in intimacy _ all brushed strokes
and languid tones.
</P>
<P>
   Apple is the rarest of birds: a surprising-sounding pop artist.
She came out swinging on ``Fast As You Can,'' a complicated
kiss-off whose crazy rhythms flowed through her like jolts of
electricity. ``Paper Bag'' was equal parts Tin Pan Alley and Paul
McCartney, a piano ditty with the dark soul of a sensitive girl.
And though it was next to impossible to re-create the quirky,
layered studio orchestrations that hang like ornaments on her
tremulous alto, the sound of this show was still captivating.
``Limp,'' for example, was a sea of glassy textures and burbling
keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   For an encore, Apple treated her audience to an unexpected
cover, sung to a scratchy instrumental tape, of Cole Porter's ``It
Was Just One of Those Things.'' She was, indeed, the antidote to
pop's current spate of cookie-cutter cutie-pies.

&HT;     WOMEN, PAID LESS THAN MEN, HAVE THINGS FIGURED OUT BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By DAVE MURPHY  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ At this time of year, one statistic that is
widely quoted _ and extremely deceptive _ is that the typical
female worker earns about 75 cents for every dollar that a man
earns. In a sense, it's a great statistic because you can use it to
support just about anything you want.
</P>
<P>
   Feminists certainly can use it to say that women are dreadfully
underpaid, but I prefer to look at it another way: It proves that
your typical male is about 33 percent stupider than your typical
female.
</P>
<P>
   All right, so neither perception is exactly accurate, mainly
because the statistic itself is dreadfully flawed. It simply
compares the salaries of all employed males and all employed
females, regardless of type of job or years of experience. So Bill
Gates fits into the same category as someone who asks, ``Do you
want fries with that?''
</P>
<P>
   When you have people of both sexes in comparable jobs with
similar experience, the gap is more like a dime than a quarter.
That's discrimination, certainly, but it may be based as much on
negotiating skills as blatant sexism.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that women sell themselves cheap _ and
companies know it,'' Working Woman magazine says in an article on
its Web site (workingwoman.com). ``The vast majority of women at
every employment level do not price their skills at market value.''
</P>
<P>
   The remaining 15-cent gap is mainly because women frequently
interrupt their careers for long periods to raise children, and
tend to select lower-paying careers than men do. Sometimes they
don't have enough formal education to land a high-paying job, but
often they simply prefer work that is emotionally rewarding rather
than financially lucrative.
</P>
<P>
   And those who return to the work force after being absent for
several years might well feel insecure about their worth to a
company, so they underprice themselves.
</P>
<P>
   (Yes, we're talking in generalizations. There are millions of
exceptions.)
</P>
<P>
   Some people with a political agenda will rail at the unfairness
of it all, saying that society doesn't value the contributions that
women make, and that women are still victims of the male-dominated
workplace.
</P>
<P>
   Did anybody ever stop to think that maybe the women are the ones
who have it right? Instead of proving that women are underpaid,
maybe the statistic proves that men emphasize work too much.
</P>
<P>
   Don't get me wrong. Women shouldn't be discriminated against.
They have every right to be just as obsessive about money as men
are. They should learn to negotiate tougher so they don't get
cheated, and the younger ones are already helping themselves by
finishing college in far greater numbers than their mothers did.
</P>
<P>
   But a lot of that 15-cent gap is because they have different
values than men do. And those values may be worth a heck of a lot
more than 15 cents.
</P>
<P>
   In the relatively few times when a woman becomes the CEO of a
large corporation, she is invariably asked how she manages to
balance such a heavy workload with the demands of her family.
That's a great question, but it's also a great question for a male
CEO. Yet somehow that never gets asked _ it's just assumed that his
wife takes care of it.
</P>
<P>
   A recent study of female high school students found that many
are avoiding technology careers, not because they're intimidated by
the work, but because they think it would make for a boring career.
</P>
<P>
   Would even the staunchest feminist want those girls to go into
technology simply so the 15-cent gap could be narrowed? I doubt it.
</P>
<P>
   Even after all of society's changes in the last 30 years, men
still feel pressure _ much of it self-imposed _ to get that big
paycheck, even if it means having a career they don't enjoy or
sacrificing a family life for the sake of a promotion.
</P>
<P>
   So how do male CEOs balance work and family? Badly, usually.
Passing the buck to your spouse isn't balancing work and family;
it's ducking responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Women need to learn how to negotiate better and fight sexism so
they can knock a dime out of that 25-cent pay gap. But they ought
to think long and hard about whether those remaining 15 cents are
worth it.
</P>
<P>
   And so should men.

TOYOTA MR2 GIVES MIATA A RUN FOR ITS MONEY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (l and f coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROYAL FORD  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Move over Miata. You've got serious company.
</P>
<P>
   Five years after putting the MR2 out to pasture, Toyota has
brought it back, and it is so many things the end-of-model-line
MR2s, produced from 1985 to 1995, were not.
</P>
<P>
   The new MR2 Spyder is light _ more bang from a smaller, lighter
engine _ has better suspension and a stiffer body, and a
Porsche-derivative look that's bound to appeal to young buyers,
providing dealers do not price gouge them out of the market.
</P>
<P>
   At just over $23,000, Toyota has entered a market dominated
since the late 1980s by Mazda's Miata, the car credited with
restoring the two-seater droptop to the American scene.
</P>
<P>
   Why Toyota ever left this market wide open to Mazda is unclear,
but then again, Toyota faltered at the young end of the market
throughout its model range. That's why, this year, besides the MR2,
Toyota is coming out with the new Echo and a spiffed up Celica
Sports Coupe.
</P>
<P>
   With its Boxster-like side air scoops, prominent fenders framing
a wedge-away nose, and chopped rear end, the MR2 has got the look.
It's also got the snap that both young drivers and older sports car
aficionados will appreciate.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Celica GTS 1.8-liter, twin-cam, four-cylinder, the MR2
matches Miata power at nearly 140 horsepower. But at around 2,200
pounds, it is 200 pounds lighter. Plus, the transverse mount,
midengine setup gives you not only the sound and sensation of a
high-performance car, but also a better feel on the road than you
get with the Miata.
</P>
<P>
   That's not saying the MR2 is a match for Honda's S2000 _ the
redline 9,000, six-speed screamer _ but even factoring for gouging
on both models, the MR2 is still about $7,000 cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   It is about three inches shorter than the Miata, yet has a
wheelbase that's seven inches longer. This adds not only to
performance, but also gives better legroom in the cockpit. In fact,
even a tall person, seat pushed back, can recline comfortably
behind the wheel. With this in mind, Toyota made the seat cushions
long. They also made the seatbacks quite high for good head and
neck support.
</P>
<P>
   Ergonomically, it is delightfully simple. The three-gauge
grouping behind the wheel features retro black-on-white lettering
and it glows a warm orange at night. Climate control dials are big.
Buttons for audio control are big.
</P>
<P>
   The manual convertible top is easy to use _ two levers and a
little elbow grease and it is stored neatly away. A wind deflector
behind the seats cuts down on cockpit turmoil when the top is down.
When up, wind noise is noticeable but not distracting. It's not as
tight a top as you find on the Mitsubishi Eclipse Spyder, but that
top does not rest on as good a car. The glass window in the MR2 top
is clear and heated and visibility through it is excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Not that you could fix the problem without changing the essence
of the MR2, but it has very little storage space. Decent glove box,
small bins in the doors, a dual-door pocket of space behind the
seats _ but nowhere to put an actual suitcase or even a large soft
bag. If you go on the road in the MR2, you'll have to pack lightly
unless you can find a luggage rack for the short rear deck.
</P>
<P>
   But I suspect folks will pay more attention to how the MR2 gets
them where they are going than they will to the things they can
carry.
</P>
<P>
   So another comparison is in order.
</P>
<P>
   The Miata, it seems to me, is more ``English'' in feel. It's got
that certain drift-then-correct quality that I remember from MGs.
</P>
<P>
   The MR2? Call it Teutonic. It slices, cuts, grips the road. Only
on uphill twists did I feel a slight unweighting going on up front.
</P>
<P>
   The ride, with a throaty burble of the engine emanating from
behind you, is choppy, as is common in these stiff two-seaters. And
this is a stiff car, supported by struts all around, stabilizer
bars front and rear, and trailing arms in the rear.
</P>
<P>
   Anchored in your seat, you feel the pull to the sides as you
corner, but it's not a sense that you will body-roll out of your
seat. It's more as if you are part of the car, feeling what its
suspension is sensing. This is a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   The five-speed manual transmission was crisp and the torque band
was steady right up to as fast as you ought to go and then some.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota offers few options on the MR2, and that makes its
standard equipment _ air conditioning, ABS _ part of a good
bargain. Add 10-inch discs to the ABS and you have formidable
stopping power.
</P>
<P>
   Toyota is planning to sell only about 5,000 MR2s per year right
now, and that opens the doors to price gouging. And though Toyota
folks told me they have stressed to dealers that this should not
happen, doubtless it will.
</P>
<P>
   A final comparison between the Miata and MR2? The MR2 is more
fun. With the Miata and its trunk, you can take more with you.
</P>
<P>
   Nice touch:
</P>
<P>
   --The golden glow that rises subtly to the fender tips from each
bug-eyed headlight and helps you keep track of your front corners
at night.
</P>
<P>
   Annoyance:
</P>
<P>
   --Window controls placed back on the center console. They are
hard to get at because you have to work your way around the hand
brake.

GDP MATCHES ADVANCE NUMBER BUT TOPS EXPECTATIONS 
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROLYN KOO   
 c. 2000 NYTimes.com/TheStreet.com   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. economy entered its 112th month of expansion, though
retail spending dropped noticeably. The overall gross domestic
product number indicates that the Federal Reserve is likely to
continue its campaign of raising interest rates in the coming
months.
</P>
<P>
   The Commerce Department released on Thursday a GDP number of 5.4
percent that was unchanged from the advance number that came out on
April 27. Economists had been looking for the broad measure of
economic growth to come in at an annualized pace of 5.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's revised GDP report is based on more data than the
advance report. The final revision of the GDP report, based on yet
more information, will be disclosed on June 29.
</P>
<P>
   The economy grew at a 7.3 percent annual pace in the fourth
quarter of 1999, and at a 4.1 percent overall pace in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the big picture hasn't changed at all,'' said Anthony
Karydakis, senior financial economist at Banc One Capital Markets.
``Today's report is not of any material importance to the Fed.''
</P>
<P>
   The gross domestic purchase index, another inflation measure in
the GDP report, also remained the same, increasing at a 3.2 percent
pace, compared with a 2.3 percent pace in the fourth quarter of
1999.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the report merely confirms the Fed's efforts to rein in
the economy. The Federal Reserve has increased interest rates six
times since June 1999, including a rise of half a percentage point
last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy is still strong, and the Fed will raise rates
again,'' said Marilyn Schaja, money market economist at Donaldson,
Lufkin and Jenrette. ``But it's inconclusive whether they'll raise
rates again in June or wait until August.''
</P>
<P>
   Though the broad GDP number was not revised, most of the
individual components were, ``but net-net it was a wash as they
offset each other fully,'' Karydakis added.
</P>
<P>
   Retail spending, or consumption expenditures, rose at a 7.5
percent annual rate, down from the 8.3 percent annualized pace in
the advance report.
</P>
<P>
   There was also a slight downward revision to the report's
measure of consumer prices, the personal consumption expenditures
index, to 3.1 percent from 3.2 percent in the advance report,
because of revisions to medical costs. That is still up sharply
from the 2.5 percent pace in the fourth quarter.

TO EVERYTHING THERE'S A SEASON, AND THIS SEASON PROVED IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEN PARISH PERKINS 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Questions, observations, opinions, annoyances and other oddities
in a television season we can finally call over:
</P>
<P>
   Is Tom Green human?
</P>
<P>
   Quick, what was ``Brutally Normal''? ``The Strip''? ``Safe
Harbor''?
</P>
<P>
   Canceled shows I'll miss most: ``Freaks &AMP; Geeks'' on NBC, ``Now
&AMP; Again'' on CBS, ``Get Real'' on Fox, ``Le Femme Nikita'' on USA.
</P>
<P>
   Canceled show I'll miss least: Showtime's ``Linc's,'' perhaps
the worst-written series in years.
</P>
<P>
   Renewals that astound: Showtime's ``Rude Awakening.'' Kiddin'
me?
</P>
<P>
   Most-watched program: Tuesday edition of ABC's ``Who Wants To Be
a Millionaire,'' at 29 million. Second: Sunday night's
``Millionaire.'' Third: ``Millionaire'' on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Least-watched: The first airing of WB's ``Mission Hill,'' at a
little less than 1 million. Next: The second episode of ``Mission
Hill.''
</P>
<P>
   Most underappreciated: ``Beggars &AMP; Choosers'' on Showtime.
</P>
<P>
   Do we need three hours of ``Today''?
</P>
<P>
   I won't miss Vivica A. Fox, discarded from CBS' ``City of
Angels'' like a smelly sneaker relegated to the back porch.
</P>
<P>
   Bette Midler will be the latest film star to crash and burn on
network television.
</P>
<P>
   Has Tom Selleck's career been reduced to guest shots on
``Friends'' during sweeps?
</P>
<P>
   Most hilarious scene in a sitcom: Hal's (Bryan Cranston)
roller-disco number in Fox's ``Malcolm in the Middle.'' Utters Hal:
``That routine won me a gold medal, a macrame plant hanger and your
mother's heart, all in the same afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Leno or Letterman? Letterman.
</P>
<P>
   Regis or Kathie Lee? Regis.
</P>
<P>
   Star Jones or Lisa Ling? Ling.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arthur'' or ``Blue's Clues?'' ``Arthur''
</P>
<P>
   ``Judging Amy'' will overtake ``NYPD Blue'' in the ratings, if
not next season, the season after that.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope ``Millionaire'' flops next fall and ABC is caught
with nothing with which to replace it. That would be sweet.
</P>
<P>
   More people now watch UPN than The WB. Oh my.
</P>
<P>
   How dismal is life for Fox? It hasn't launched a hit drama since
``Ally McBeal'' in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Latinos comprise 11 percent of the U.S. population and fill less
than 2 percent of speaking roles on television.
</P>
<P>
   1952: Elena Verdugo, the first actress of Latin descent to star
in a sitcom, played a Jewish secretary.
</P>
<P>
   1996: Puerto Rican actor Jimmy Smits is introduced as Victor
Sifuentes on ``NYPD Blue,'' a man of French and Portuguese
ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   2000: ``American Family,'' a drama about a Hispanic family, is a
sure shot to make the CBS schedule. Yeah, right. Says CBS President
Leslie Moonves when it doesn't: ``It wasn't a good fit at this
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Alex Nogales of the National Hispanic Media Coalition:
``It's dismal ... just dismal.''
</P>
<P>
   $750,000: The amount per episode each ``Friends'' cast member
will pocket next season, a salary bump of $625,000.
</P>
<P>
   $25,000: The amount it will take to fix the front porch of the
house ``Friends''' star Matthew Perry smashed with his car.
</P>
<P>
   1: The number of episodes it took for NBC to realize that ``The
Mike O'Malley Show'' lacked, well, growth potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ally McBeal,'' once one of the most intriguing series in prime
time, is now the most annoying. Where else could a major character
die and no one notice?
</P>
<P>
   With a dreadful ``Ally McBeal,'' a dreadful ``Ally,'' a dreadful
``Snoops,'' a wildly uneven ``The Practice,'' and a ``Chicago
Hope'' that couldn't be turned around, the projects of
producer/writer David E. Kelley should no longer be called
promising, sight unseen.
</P>
<P>
   Can't keep that Dick Wolf down, can we?
</P>
<P>
   Interesting how female characters in Steven Bochco's shows are
either too strong in the head or too weak in the knees.
</P>
<P>
   How fortunes for a sistah can change: Sanaa Lathan was virtually
ignored (except for the usual where-are-black-folks-in-TV inquiry)
at a press conference for the series ``Lateline'' just a few months
ago. Now the ``Love &AMP; Basketball'' star is besieged with interview
requests and TV scripts.
</P>
<P>
   How smart is CBS? It gets the NAACP off their backs by saving
the life of the high-profile black drama ``City of Angels,'' only
to send it out on a suicide mission next season against
``Millionaire'' on ABC and ``Will &AMP; Grace'' on NBC. I can hear a
CBS exec saying now, ``Hey, we gave it a shot, didn't we!''
</P>
<P>
   A season without Jennifer Love Hewitt. What shall we do?
</P>
<P>
   HBO's ``The Corner'' is this season's best miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   If you don't have cable, your television is taking up space.
</P>
<P>
   Letters on Kathie Lee Gifford:
</P>
<P>
   ``... just despise the woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``... just love that woman.''
</P>
<P>
   ``With all that's going on in the world, should we really be
discussing this woman?''
</P>
<P>
   Are we still in the midst of a Jennifer Grey comeback?
</P>
<P>
   Couple with the best sexual chemistry: Willow (Alyson Hannigan)
and Tara (Amber Benson), the budding lesbian lovers of ``Buffy the
Vampire Slayer.''
</P>
<P>
   Couple with the worst sexual chemistry: Bryant Gumbel and Jane
Clayson of ``The Early Show.''
</P>
<P>
   Further proof that TV news anchors are merely actors playing
roles: Andrea Thompson leaves ``NYPD Blue'' for a news anchor gig
in New Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   Nine words for the Daphne/Niles love commencement on
``Frasier'': Lois and Clark. Maggie and David. Thelma and Louise.
</P>
<P>
   If I hear, ``Is that your final answer?'' from one more
waitperson, it'll be their final breath.
</P>
<P>
   Best line: ``I've given up on TV,'' admits Shrug (Evan Handler)
on the canceled series ``It's Like, You Know.'' ``It makes up for
not reading.''

   &UR; CHILDREN OF HOLOCAUST FILE CLASS-ACTION SUIT AGAINST INSURANCE
FIRM &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (For use by New York Times News Service clients.) &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By MICHAEL DOUGAN &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c.2000 ?San Franciso Examiner &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Four children of people killed or persecuted
during the Holocaust have filed suit against one of Europe's
largest insurance companies, claiming the firm _ Assicurazioni
Generali _ has failed to honor policies purchased by their parents,
grandparents and uncles.
</P>
<P>
   The class-action suit could result in billions of dollars in
damages, according to an attorney for the San Francisco plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   The suit was filed Tuesday in San Francisco Superior Court by a
Los Angeles law firm and a nonprofit legal foundation on behalf of
San Francisco residents Ernest Smetana, Fritzie Wolf and Agnes
Heyman, and Marin County resident Paola Oreffice Kulp.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Carnicelli, head of Generali's American office in New
York, denied that his firm had treated the four Californians
unfairly and insisted that their attorneys had disseminated
``significant misinformation'' about his company.
</P>
<P>
   The suit seeks class-action status on behalf of as many as
20,000 Californians whose relatives were killed or persecuted in
the Holocaust and held insurance policies that were never honored.
</P>
<P>
   While this is the first class-action suit filed against Generali
in this state, other California residents have taken the company to
court. Los Angeles businessman Allen Stern, grandson of a Ukrainian
Jew who died in the Holocaust, established the legal precedent that
the Italian company can be sued in California because it does
business here.
</P>
<P>
   Several other California suits against Generali have ended in
confidential settlements.
</P>
<P>
   Smetana and Wolf, a brother and sister living in San Francisco,
claim their father, Hermann Smetana, purchased a Generali life
insurance policy in Austria in 1928. They believe an uncle also
bought insurance from the company.
</P>
<P>
   Heyman is the daughter of Mayer Friedman. She said he bought a
policy from Generali in Czechoslovakia naming her as beneficiary.
</P>
<P>
   Kulp said her parents and grandfather all had Generali life
insurance policies. Ironically, her father, Guilio Oreffice, and
grandfather, Gino Cavaglieri, were executives at Generali before
the war.
</P>
<P>
   All claim Generali was dishonest in denying their claims. The
lawsuit details their purported efforts, over five decades, to
obtain compensation from the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``My father had a brother and that brother had a daughter and
when that daughter returned from the concentration camp, she
managed to find (the policy papers) in the house,'' said Heyman,
76. She spoke at a press conference Wednesday announcing the
lawsuit, held at the Holocaust Memorial near the Palace of the
Legion of Honor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's highway robbery, that's what it is,'' said Wolf, who
turned 90 on Monday. ``It's highly unfair. The money can never make
anything good, but they shouldn't profit by it.''
</P>
<P>
   Attorney David Lash said the issue of Holocaust insurance
payments has reached a critical stage because of the age of the
plaintiffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every day another Holocaust survivor dies and another
opportunity for justice dies with them,'' said Lash, who works with
the Bet Tzedek Legal Services, a nonprofit agency based in Los
Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   He said he expects the new suit to be resolved within a year or
two.
</P>
<P>
   Generali issued a statement late Wednesday claiming the company
has made more than $2 million in payments to Holocaust survivors
and their families, more than any other firm working with an
International Commission on Holocaust-era Insurance Claims.
</P>
<P>
   The Generali statement asserted that the company is ``committed
to the honorable treatment of Holocaust victims and their
beneficiaries,'' even though there is ``no legal obligation'' to
pay policies in Eastern European countries where the company's
assets were nationalized by communist governments.
</P>
<P>
   Generali was founded and run by Jews for most of its history,
although the company was ``Aryanized'' during the Holocaust period.
It is the largest insurance dealer in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   The question of unpaid insurance claims for Holocaust-era
beneficiaries has been an issue since 1997, when a similar
class-action suit was filed against Generali in New York and state
Insurance Commissioner Charles Quackenbush launched hearings here.
At least five other European insurance companies also have been
charged with unfairly denying benefits to Holocaust victims and
their descendants.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, the state Legislature passed a bill requiring insurers
doing business in California to identify all policies sold to
Holocaust victims. Generali is currently challenging that bill in
court.

&HT;     CONCERN GROWS ABOUT ADS IN OUTDOORS PUBLICATION 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ An advocacy group concerned about underage
drinking wants the Texas Department of Parks and Wildlife to get
rid of alcohol and cigarette advertisements in the annual guide to
the state's hunting and fishing rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Anheuser-Busch wants to have their (ads) on TV, we can't do
a great deal about that, but when our own state government steps in
and says let us help you relay these messages ... we find that
unacceptable,'' said Jim Haire, advertising chairman of Texans
Standing Tall, a coalition to prevent underage drinking.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Haire brought his concern to the attention of the
state Sunset Advisory Commission, which is reviewing the operation
of the Parks and Wildlife Department.
</P>
<P>
   But changing the annual booklet, which says Texas Parks and
Wildlife prominently on the cover, will not be a simple matter,
primarily because the state sold the rights to publish the annual
guide to the Texas Monthly magazine for $100,000 in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a misperception that we publish that and we don't,''
said spokeswoman Lydia Saldana, who said the department does
distribute the guide.
</P>
<P>
   The sale of the annual guide was part of a larger push in the
Parks and Wildlife Department to aggressively pursue new funding.
</P>
<P>
   Texas spends $2.44 per person on state parks, the second-lowest
rate among the 50 states.
</P>
<P>
   In the past five years, Texas Monthly overhauled the annual
guide, adding articles and more advertisements printed on glossy
pages. A 1991 guide included only a single advertisement for Dodge
cars and trucks, Saldana said.
</P>
<P>
   There are seven pages of alcohol and cigarette ads in the most
recent guide, which was distributed to more than 3 million hunters
and fishermen. Ads for cars, off-road vehicles and fishing gear
cover another 14 pages.
</P>
<P>
   Saldana said the Parks and Wildlife Department was surprised by
the publication's evolution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say that we did not anticipate the number
and nature of ads that would be in the Outdoor Annual,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   David Dunham, a Texas Monthly senior vice president, said the
contract does not prohibit these ads. There is very little negative
reaction from hunters and fishermen, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The free guides are distributed at places where hunters and
fishermen purchase licenses. Dunham pointed out that children under
17 years old do not need a license and therefore would not
necessarily come into contact with the guide.
</P>
<P>
   The legal drinking age is 21.
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Leo Berman, R-Tyler, introduced a bill in 1999 to
prohibit the Parks and Wildlife Department from being associated _
directly or indirectly _ with the promotion of alcoholic beverages.
</P>
<P>
   The bill never made it out of committee, due to pressure from
``beer distributors,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Working with Parks Director Andy Sansom, he worked out a
compromise to make 50,000 guides with only a single hamburger
advertisement available to younger outdoorsmen through hunter
education classes.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the kids still have access to all the catalogues in the
Wal-Marts and everywhere else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, said Saldana, 100,000 guides without alcohol or
cigarette advertisements will be printed.

`SHANGHAI NOON' HAS PLENTY OF KICK THANKS TO JACKIE CHAN

<P>
   Stop me if you've heard this before. A Chinese guy wearing
Indian war paint, a braided waist-length ponytail and a blue silk
robe walks into an Old West saloon _ and it's Jackie Chan!
</P>
<P>
   Trust me, it's funny. Cowboys snicker, barmaids stand agog and
human dynamo Jackie transforms a simple barfight into a night at
the Chinese Opera.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie is Chon Wang, a boyishly sincere Forbidden City palace
guard in love with unattainable Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu in an
unusually docile performance). Seduced by romantic English fairy
tales she ``escapes'' to America, but her benefactors are not as
altruistic as they seem: A ransom note is left in her wake.
</P>
<P>
   Lovesick Chon accompanies the official retinue bearing the
ransom to Nevada, where he foils a train robbery, marries into a
wry Sioux tribe after sucking too long on a peace pipe, inherits a
horse smarter than Trigger and adopts both a guardian angel and an
unlikely sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   Owen Wilson, the garrulous would-be career criminal of ``Bottle
Rocket,'' is laid-back outlaw Roy O'Bannon, a gentle
philosopher-train robber who couldn't hit the side of the Rockies
with a rifle. Left for dead by his cutthroat gang, Roy and Chon
keep crossing paths and trading blows and banter, until Roy hitches
onto Chon's quest with hopes of pocketing a little royal gold for
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, there's a bounty on their heads and a steely-eyed
marshal on their trail (Xander Berkeley, who cuts a sharp figure as
a corrupt lawman in black). It's going to take more than one
death-defying escape to get this gang who couldn't shoot straight
to their princess.
</P>
<P>
   This East-meets-Old-West action comedy is hardly original but
the unlikely team clicks. Jackie, well over 40, plays the gung-ho
rookie with a coy grin, a flying kick and a spirited, goofy charm.
Sardonic, low-key Wilson makes an inspired screen partner for
Jackie, his deadpan wit and a self-effacing patter balancing
Jackie's clownish mugging.
</P>
<P>
   Director Tom Dey strikes the right balance between white
hat/black hat showdowns, spirited action scenes and anachronistic
tongue-in-cheek punch lines (``My name is Chon Wang.'' ``John
Wayne? That's a terrible cowboy name!'').
</P>
<P>
   Jackie's furious moves are more often comic displays of
acrobatic slapstick than deadly showdowns but he tenses for the
climactic fight to the finish with a determined seriousness, his
grin turning grim and his eyes narrowing in concentration.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie doesn't have many years left for this kind of giddy
cinematic horseplay _ age is creeping into his face and he's not as
spry as he used to be _ but he still can turn a silly little action
comedy like this into a high-spirited, butt-kicking good time.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai Noon. Directed by Tom Dey. Screenplay by Alfred Gough
and Miles Millar. Cast: Jackie Chan, Owen Wilson, Lucy Liu, Brandon
Merrill, Roger Yuan, Xander Berkeley, Jason Connery. Touchstone
Pictures. 110 minutes. PG-13 for sexual suggestion and violence.

AMY IRVING'S NEW FILM IS A GIFT FROM HER DIRECTOR HUSBAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Four years ago, Amy Irving appeared in husband Bruno
Barreto's Waxahachie-filmed ``Carried Away,'' a movie that didn't
exactly make her look like her normally radiant self. Which, the
actress admits, might just have been for the best.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody saw it,'' Irving laments during a Dallas stop. ``It's
one of the most beautiful films ever. But in it, in order for me to
play Dennis Hopper's childhood sweetheart, I had to age and look
really older and frumpier, and there's a very harsh love scene in a
kitchen with me naked, and it's not flattering. Ever since, I've
told Bruno he owes me a film in which I look really good.''
</P>
<P>
   Barreto responded with the romantic-comedy souffle ``Bossa
Nova.'' The charming, lightweight film is a valentine to Irving,
who is lovingly photographed as Mary Ann, a Rio de Janeiro-based
widow who teaches English as a second language and attracts the
attention of a recently divorced businessman, played by Brazilian
star Antonio Fagundes. Barreto also filmed it as a bouquet to Rio,
his hometown, where seven other characters find themselves joining
Mary Ann in a game of romantic musical chairs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he captured the Rio that exists when you're in love,''
Irving says of Barreto. ``I know, because when we've worked
together, we've always fallen in love.''
</P>
<P>
   Irving was actually pitched the film 11 years ago, during her
first trip to Rio with Barreto, whose best-known film is his steamy
1978 debut, ``Dona Flor and Her Two Husbands.'' At the time,
another filmmaker had the rights to the material, but after nearly
a decade of cajoling, Barreto acquired them to make the film for
Irving. The 46-year-old actress suits the film's lead character,
who, like the actress, is both down-to-earth and a little quirky,
with a bit of a hippie past.
</P>
<P>
   Despite brief A-list status in the '80s after roles in such
movies as ``Carrie,'' ``Yentl'' and ``Crossing Delancey,'' Irving
remains best-known for once being married to Steven Spielberg. But
her show-biz career pre-dates Spielberg, stretching back to when
she was all of 9 months old. That's when her father, Jules Irving,
who directed the San Francisco Actors Workshop, cast her as the
baby in a stage production of ``Rumpelstiltskin.'' Her mother,
Priscilla Pointer, is also an actress (she has appeared in several
of Irving's films).
</P>
<P>
   The family moved to New York when Irving was 11, but she stayed
in touch with her San Francisco roots.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every summer I would come and stay with some friends who lived
in the Haight-Ashbury district, so I kind of watched it all
happen,'' she says, referring to San Francisco's hotbed of '60s
hippiedom. ``I mean, it was happening when I got there. Right
across the street from me was this house called the Clayton House.
On the ground floor were the hippies and the flower children. On
the second floor were the Hell's Angels and their girlfriends, and
on the third floor were prostitutes. It was a very diverse area.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite that turn-on and drop-out atmosphere, Irving stayed
focused on her goal: a career in Hollywood. And after finishing
school and muddling through early professional hiccups such as a
miscast part in a 1975 episode of ``Happy Days,'' she broke through
in two Brian De Palma movies: 1976's ``Carrie,'' in which she
figures into the movie's hand-sprouting-from-the-grave conclusion,
and 1978's ``The Fury,'' in which she plays a telekinetic teen-ager
recruited to find a similarly gifted/cursed peer.
</P>
<P>
   No fan of horror flicks, Irving soon moved on to romances
(''Honeysuckle Rose,'' ``The Competition'') and minor stardom,
which she says taught her a few things about preserving her
offscreen image.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember coming in (to do interviews) for `The Competition'
to Dallas and Fort Worth,'' she says, referring to the 1980 film
with Richard Dreyfuss that centers on a piano competition more or
less based on Fort Worth's Van Cliburn competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to do a Q-and-A after the screening. The mayor
of Cowtown took me to all these honky-tonks. We were drinking
tequila, and then we had to come back to the film. I was out there
just saying anything, I was drunk as a skunk. I learned that you
have to have a little decorum and behave yourself during these
things.''
</P>
<P>
   That became even more important in 1985, when she married
Spielberg, with whom she had a son, Max, who turns 15 next month.
The marriage only lasted four years, but she and the director stay
in touch, especially when it comes to trying to urge along Max's
budding talent as a writer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max doesn't know how good he is,'' she says. ``He wouldn't let
me read (his stories) until I would tell him, `I want to see your
work.' I was so blown away by them. He didn't believe me. He'd say,
`You're my mom, you have to say these things.' I'd say, `No, this
is really good writing.' I sent them to his father, and his father
wrote him this fan letter back, and even signed it as `Steven'
instead of `Dad' so it was a professional thing, not a father
thing. Now I'm showing his stories to writer friends of mine,
because I want him to know _ he doesn't love writing, but it just
comes so easy.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, this shouldn't come as a surprise to Irving, who
seems to have a knack for finding men whose talents show themselves
early. Like Spielberg, Barreto seems to have been born with a
camera in his hand _ Irving says that he made his first film when
he was 16 (his grandmother financed it). He did ``Dona Flor'' when
he was 20. (Spielberg was pushing 25 when his 1971 TV movie
``Duel'' put him on the map.) Irving never appeared in one of
Spielberg's movies, but with ``Bossa Nova'' she'll have appeared in
four of Barreto's, including the one that brought them together,
1990's ``A Show of Force.'' (The couple has a 10-year-old son,
Gabriel.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a love-at-first-sight experience,'' she says. ``I
didn't really believe in love at first sight, but when we met each
other, we recognized each other. And we had this lunch where he
asked me to do the film, and I kept thinking, `Oh, God, be
professional, don't get involved with your director, you've gotta
make a movie.' It was just stronger than both of us, and 10 days
into the film, we were in love. That was mutual. I'd never had that
happen. So I guess we're both romantics in that way.''

 &HT;    HOUSE COMMITTEE APPROVES PHASE-OUT OF FEDERAL ESTATE TAXES
 &HT;    By LARRY LIPMAN
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Setting up a classic fight over whether tax breaks
favor the rich or the poor, a House committee voted 24-11 Thursday
to phase out the federal estate tax over the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   The Ways and Means Committee action could be followed by a House
vote early next month. Three Democrats joined the committee's
unanimous Republicans in voting for the measure.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton has indicated he would veto the bill in its
present form because it unfairly benefits the rich and might
jeopardize federal programs due to lost tax revenue. Clinton vetoed
a similar bill last year.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, which has bipartisan support from 240 lawmakers in the
435-member House, would affect roughly 58,000 estates a year which
pay about $27 billion in federal taxes.
</P>
<P>
   When fully implemented by 2010, the bill would result in a loss
to the federal government of about $50 billion a year in taxes,
according to committee staff.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans hailed the measure as a boon to small business
owners and family farmers, but Democrats said it would affect
relatively few _ but very rich _ people.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Bill Archer, R-Texas, the committee chairman, said ``the
time has come to bury the death tax.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No American, no matter their income, should be forced to pay
60 percent of their savings, their business or their farm in taxes
when they die,'' Archer said. ``This death tax doesn't just affect
the rich, it affects Americans up and down the economic spectrum.''
</P>
<P>
   But Democrats questioned Archer's comments about the rate of the
tax and whom it affects.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Pete Stark, D-Calif., noted that the average estate tax
rate ranges from 15 percent to 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning by Democratic members, committee staffers said
that estate taxes are paid by the estates of about 2 percent of
those who die each year. Of those, about 3 percent are primarily
farm-related estates.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of the estates that pay taxes _ typically those
valued at more than $5 million _ pay about half of the estate
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   Noting that estates valued at $20 million or more pay an average
of 15 percent in estate taxes, Stark said ``I'd like to hear the
case that that is an onerous rate.''
</P>
<P>
   Under questioning from Stark, committee staffers said they
didn't know of any estates that paid taxes at a rate of 50 percent
or more.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter from Treasury Secretary Lawrence Summers and White
House Chief of Staff John Podesta, the administration said ``repeal
of these taxes would be fiscally unwise, would reduce the overall
fairness and progressivity of the tax system and would harm
charitable giving.''
</P>
<P>
   But Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., said the estate tax dishonors
``the hard work of those who have passed on....There is no moral,
social, or economic justification for this tax.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., noted that First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton, in her Senate campaign in New York, recently told farmers
there that she thought the estate tax threshold should be raised to
protect family farms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not make this about rich and poor, let's make this about
fairness,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, estates valued at less than $675,000 do not pay any
federal estate taxes. That exemption is scheduled to increase to $1
million by 2006. Family-owned businesses and farms are eligible for
a $1.3 million exemption. Property left from one spouse to another
is exempt from any estate tax.
</P>
<P>
   Under the bill approved by the committee, the estate and gift
taxes would be gradually reduced beginning in 2001 and eliminated
by 2010. Rates would not be reduced below the lowest income tax
rate for an unmarried individual until the taxes were fully
repealed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would phase out gift taxes and the
generation-skipping transfer tax over ten years.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, those who give more than $10,000 a year as a gift
must pay federal tax. The tax is calculated on a scale pegged to
the amount of the gift.
</P>
<P>
   The generation-skipping tax is imposed on transfers that exceed
$1 million in which the beneficiary is more than one generation
removed from the giver.

by 2010. Rates would not be reduced below the lowest income tax
rate for an unmarried individual until the taxes were fully
repealed.
</P>
<P>
   The bill also would phase out gift taxes and the
generation-skipping transfer tax over ten years.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, those who give more than $10,000 a year as a gift
must pay federal tax. The tax is calculated on a scale pegged to
the amount of the gift.
</P>
<P>
   The generation-skipping tax is imposed on transfers that exceed
$1 million in which the beneficiary is more than one generation
removed from the giver.

&HT;     LIQUID HISTORY: ERIE CANAL CHANGED AMERICA'S ECONOMIC
LANDSCAPE 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ One hundred and seventy-five years ago, when it
was officially opened, the Erie Canal spurred what might be
considered the e-commerce revolution of its day.
</P>
<P>
   The 363-mile, 40-foot-wide and 4-foot-deep ``artificial river''
with 83 locks and 18 aqueducts altered the economies of New York
state and the nation practically overnight while changing long-held
verities of business.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, the cost of transporting a ton of wheat dropped
from $100 pre-Erie to about $5 with the canal.
</P>
<P>
   The time it took to bring goods from farm to market also was
dramatically compressed. It took 20 days typically to move wheat
from the Genesee Valley, south of Rochester, overland by wagon to
Albany. The Erie cut the time to 10 days for wheat to move by canal
boat from the Genesee Valley through Albany and down the Hudson
River to New York City.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to cheaper and fresher products, the Erie _
colloquially known as ``Clinton's Ditch'' after its champion, Gov.
DeWitt Clinton _ created canal boom towns, spawned entrepreneurial
wealth and filled state coffers with toll revenue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Erie Canal brought phenomenal change in so many ways,''
said F. Daniel Larkin, author of ``New York State Canals'' and two
other scholarly books related to the Erie Canal.
</P>
<P>
   Larkin, a history professor at the State University of New York
at Oneonta and interim provost of academic affairs, joined in last
week's celebration of the 175th anniversary of the Erie Canal at
the State Archives here, where Larkin did much of his research.
</P>
<P>
   The festivities included canal songs, a play about canal
history, an appearance by a descendant of Gov. Clinton, DeWitt
Clinton Jones III, and an exhibit of documents on the Erie Canal
from the State Archives heretofore not displayed publicly.
</P>
<P>
   The archives event kicked off a yearlong celebration as part of
Gov. George Pataki's officially proclaimed ``year of the Erie
Canal'' meant to promote dozens of community canal festivals and
herald the recreational opportunities along its path.
</P>
<P>
   But where the Erie's 19th-century engineering feat still springs
to life is in the State Archives, home to 5 million documents (of
more than 150 million total) pertaining to the original Erie Canal
and its numerous reincarnations.
</P>
<P>
   Within the archives' holdings, some of the most compelling
materials are original surveyors' drawings bound into thick volumes
the size of folding card tables. When fully unfurled, these
panoramic views provide visual documentation of the canal in
12-foot spans on durable drafting paper.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, Craig Williams, history curator with the
State Museum here and a canal scholar who previously worked at the
Erie Canal Museum in Syracuse, provided a guided tour through the
archives' Erie Canal holdings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Upstate New York had never seen a period of such prosperity
and change as the Erie Canal,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   The original Erie Canal took eight years and cost $7.5 million
(roughly $4 billion in present-day dollars) to complete. It was a
victim of its own astonishing success. In its first year, 217,000
tons of goods moved on the canal and $28,000 was collected in
tolls.
</P>
<P>
   But the narrow waterway was overwhelmed with traffic, and canal
operators faced boat-jams at the locks.
</P>
<P>
   A drive was begun right away to increase the capacity of canal
boats. The 4-foot-deep original Erie could handle boats with a
maximum weight of 70 tons.
</P>
<P>
   By 1835, the first Erie expansion was under way, widening the
canal to 70 feet, increasing its depth to 7 feet, straightening its
course to speed travel and installing double locks to prevent
backups. By doing this, canal boats could bulk up and carry more
than 200 tons of goods apiece, thus increasing profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Williams pointed out the personalities behind the staggering
statistics of Erie commerce and reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   There was young Thomas Ebershed, a recent immigrant from
England, hired by the state canal department in the fall of 1839 to
make drawings for the enlargement. Ebershed left state service to
pursue his fortune in the California gold rush.
</P>
<P>
   Irish immigrant David Vaughan was a skilled surveyor and
draftsman, who came to New York in the 1840s. By 1851, he had made
his mark by embellishing his canal drawings with exquisitely
detailed watercolor scenes and witty captions.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Vaughan represents an Old World sensibility in mapmaking
and cartography and includes his own cultural attitudes in his
work,'' Williams said. ``He's a true artist and his engineering
drawings stand out from the rest.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughan died in 1865 on the job, surveying land near Utica.
</P>
<P>
   But long before, when New York's economy turned sour in the
early 1840s, the state faced a cash-flow problem and abruptly
halted work on the canal enlargement in 1842.
</P>
<P>
   The unfinished enlargement remained on hold for more than a
decade until the recession passed and the state could afford to
invest money in the canal once again.
</P>
<P>
   Increasing the canal's capacity paid off, with cargo volume
topping 4 million tons annually at its peak in 1880.
</P>
<P>
   That's with seasonal operation, too, because the Erie Canal was
closed down in winter. The waterway was drained, silt was dredged
out and repairs were made to the wooden locks and the waterproof
mortar used to cement the cut stone walls.
</P>
<P>
   Before the winter shutdown, families who owned canal boats
traditionally traveled down the Hudson to New York Harbor and
rafted together in what amounted to floating villages until the
spring re-opening.
</P>
<P>
   Archives' records also debunk conventional wisdom that Irish
immigrants were primarily responsible for digging and constructing
the Erie Canal. In fact, the Irish accounted for perhaps 15 percent
of the 9,000 contractors and laborers who built the original Erie,
according to Larkin. The vast majority of the Erie workers, he
said, were upstate residents who lived along the canal.
</P>
<P>
   One of those local laborers was Brigham Young, future leader of
the Mormons, who lived along the canal at the time. In 1825, Young
was a painting contractor and he billed state canal superintendent
R. Matson $200 for painting a few lockhouses and bridges.
</P>
<P>
   ``That stretch of the canal that Young painted had actually been
in use; so my guess is that he was paid to spruce things up before
the opening ceremonies in 1825,'' Williams said.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a fourth and final major expansion was completed in
1918, with crude wooden mechanisms replaced by modern steel locks
on the Mohawk River's Barge Canal.
</P>
<P>
   The original Erie Canal changed attitudes of upstate culture as
well, according to Williams. As a result of the canal's commercial
revolution, religious revivalism swept upstate in the decades after
1825, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For Larkin, who is currently writing a biography of Benjamin
Wright, chief engineer of the original Erie Canal, the myriad
phases of the canal underscore an elemental truth first tested and
proven in the state in 1825.
</P>
<P>
   ``Water was then and still is the cheapest way to ship
anything,'' Larkin said.

<P>
   LONDON _ A joint Anglo-Israeli team of medical scientists have
boldly gone where no one has gone before: they have recorded a
video film of a journey through a person's entire digestive tract.
</P>
<P>
   A pill-sized capsule containing a camera, light and radio
transmitter _ but no wires _ has emulated science fiction by making
a ``fantastic voyage'' from the mouth to the rear end.
</P>
<P>
   In the sci-fi thriller of the same name by Isaac Asimov, made
into a film starring Raquel Welch, a submarine and its crew are
shrunk and injected into a man's bloodstream. Their mission is to
destroy a blood clot in the brain of a man who was the victim of an
assassination attempt.
</P>
<P>
   The real-life fantastic voyage was performed on a group of 10
volunteers who each swallowed a torpedo-shaped capsule while
wearing a special belt packed with recording equipment, which
monitored the capsule's passage through the body.
</P>
<P>
   The team, led by Paul Swain, a professor of gastroenterology at
the Royal London Hospital, said it was the first time the digestive
tract had been monitored with a wireless endoscope.
</P>
<P>
   The procedure, described as ``painless'' in the journal
``Nature,'' involved allowing the capsule to be moved along by the
peristaltic contractions of the gut's muscles, until the device was
evacuated naturally about 24 hours after it was swallowed.
</P>
<P>
   Video images were transmitted over many hours and collected by
the recording equipment on the belt, which also monitored the
capsule's precise position in the body.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Swain said one great advantage of the capsule was that
it can be used to take images in the small bowel, a region not
usually accessible with conventional endoscopes inserted through
the rectum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen my small bowel and smiled. Not many people can say
they've done that because it is usually quite painful in that
area,'' said Professor Swain, who took the capsule.
</P>
<P>
   Another advantage is that patients can undergo endoscopy of the
intestines while continuing to carry out their everyday activities.
</P>
<P>
   The capsule measures less than half an inch in width and is just
over an inch long. Professor Swain said it was easier to swallow
than many antibiotic pills and that patients could not feel it
moving inside them.
</P>
<P>
   The scientists, who include electronic engineers from Given
Imaging Ltd. in Israel, are working on ways of controlling the
movements of the capsule so that it can be manipulated near to
certain sites of interest within the intestines.
</P>
<P>
   One plan is to incorporate a miniaturized cutting device, such
as a laser, to take biopsy samples.
</P>
<P>
   Professor Swain said the device had not yet received approval
from regulatory bodies in Britain for general use on patients, but
he hopes to begin clinical trials this year.
</P>
<P>
   He has not ruled out the possibility of making an even smaller
capsule to be injected into the vessels of the blood system _
making a real-life Fantastic Voyage even more likely. &QL;

   KFAR KILA _ They stood along the border fence and stared at the
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah men _ hundreds of them, in their combat fatigues
and with their rifles in their hands and their flak jackets over
their shoulders _ just stood in silence beside me and looked out,
awestruck, at the fields and orchards of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   Bathed in the blue mist of dawn, Israel _ or Palestine as the
Hezbollah men called it _ looked almost holy. We could see the glow
of oranges in the trees and hear the water dripping from an
irrigation tap and, not so far away, see the red roofs of homes.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman beside me breathed in deeply. ``Azeem,'' he said.
``Incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was. Here they were, the bearded men who had routed one
of the world's most powerful armies, standing at last on the very
frontier of Israel after driving the last Israeli soldier the last
mile out of Lebanon. In fact, the Israeli border wire was only
three feet from us.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Sheikh Sami Khadra, one of the Hezbollah's senior
clerics, standing in his white turban and long black robes, staring
into Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   There was no overt hostility, no threat, no raised rifle. At one
point a white Israeli van drove down the other side of the wire,
the driver waving oddly at the Hezbollah men.
</P>
<P>
   Had the world gone mad? Sheikh Khadra did not think so. ``It is
a reality more than a dream,'' he said. ``But it is a sight we
could not have dreamed about. We have moved south and now, we hear,
the Jewish settlers over there are frightened and moving south.''
It was God's work, one of the Hezbollah men said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 300) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The sheikh's armed protectors searched the horizon for Israeli
troops. There were none to be seen. Just that morning mist and the
dew on the trees and the odd feeling that the Hezbollah war had
come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The men who fought their way from Beirut had at last reached the
border and looked upon the land of their enemies and understood the
transitory nature of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Behind us a convoy of cars was waiting for the Hezbollah to fill
up a mine crater _ the Israelis had left a few hours earlier by
detonating all the Lebanese approach roads to the frontier _ and
loudspeakers perched on trucks vibrated with Muslim prayers.
</P>
<P>
   There were children in some of the cars and a woman who threw
rice and rose petals over the Hezbollah men, many of whom glowered
from Mercedes cars with smoked windows, rifle barrels resting on
their knees, two-way radios crackling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Did they want to cross that border fence? It did not seem so.
The Palestinians had to secure their own liberation. That's the way
the conversation went beside the Israeli frontier wire Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah had come to look, the most privileged sightseers
in the whole world. Over and over they used that same word:
``Azeem.'' ``Incredible.'' Only one man did I hear talking about
``the liquidation of Zionism.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same all across southern Lebanon Wednesday, as if the
guerrilla victory had not been fully comprehended. But it was a
virtual rout.
</P>
<P>
   The ``South Lebanon Army'' _ Israeli's final protectors in this
dangerous land _ had abandoned their tanks and trucks and
ammunition and guns in the fields, the roads, their barracks and
their homes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the Christian town of Marjayoun, the home of Antoine Lahd,
the SLA leader, was systematically looted by gunmen from the rival
_ and venal _ Amal movement. They drove captured tanks through the
streets, the engines roaring as they crushed pavements and flower
gardens. A mobile artillery piece _ a big Israeli army gun _ was
driven around the town. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Israel had said it would not disarm the SLA. It didn't need to.
We saw some of them, young men with heads lowered, standing with
Hezbollah members who were reading through their identification
papers. But there was no revenge killing. No massacre. The
Hezbollah stayed out of Christian towns.
</P>
<P>
   Amal were not so disciplined. And I did begin to wonder whether
things might crack if the Lebanese army or the United Nations did
not bring some troops in here quickly. I think it was a visit to
the old SLA ``war'' memorial that worried me.
</P>
<P>
   The SLA's ``martyrs'' _ collaborators to the victors of this war
_ were commemorated in a Muslim-Christian shrine on a hill and a
garden in which each dead gunman's name, listed by town and
religion, was fixed on a brass plaque to marble walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eternity to our heroic martyrs,'' it says over the door. I
thought it might be the first place to be destroyed and when I
arrived there Wednesday, militiamen and civilians from nearby
villages were already looting the memorial, making off with sofas
and computers and chairs.
</P>
<P>
   I found one Shiite Muslim woman on her hands and knees, digging
up rose bushes from the garden with a crazed look on her face.
</P>
<P>
   And along the memorial wall, I discovered a tall, bearded man
with a knife, cutting one of the brass plaques off the marble. The
name was that of Akl Ibrahim Hashem, one of the most senior
officers in the SLA who was blown up by a Hezbollah mine on Jan. 3
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The bearded man held the plaque out to me with a laugh. ``I'm
taking this one because it is still fresh.'' And other men then
came to cut out more of the plaques. They were killing the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim villages were awash with yellow Hezbollah banners and
overzealous praise for their liberators. ``A special gratitude to
the Hezbollah'' on a poster in one formerly occupied village did
not have quite the ring of veracity.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Christian villages, the flags were only Lebanese and
the questions only about the date of the Lebanese army's arrival.
No time, we told them. No date. And the same goes for the U.N. But
I noticed how the Christians gathered not on the street but beside
their stone churches.
</P>
<P>
   And I watched the Amal men and their families looting their way
through SLA headquarters with a greed that bordered on madness,
making off with desks, old clothes, magazines, trucks, cars,
anything that was detachable from the buildings. The tanks they
drove were taken through the towns too fast, too many times.
</P>
<P>
   On the hilltop road above Marjayoun, the Hezbollah were more
careful. They planted their flag on a T-55 battle tank and sat
there in the afternoon sun as we drove past, nodding
acknowledgement at each motorist.
</P>
<P>
   But if anything symbolizes Israel's defeat and Hezbollah's
victory, it is the old Crusader castle of Beaufort.
</P>
<P>
   High above the Litani River gorge, it was bombed by the Israelis
when Palestinians used it as a mortar position in the late
seventies, then occupied by Israeli paratroopers _ at great cost _
in 1982. It was as impregnable a fortress for the Israelis as it
had once been to the knights of France.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, it was open to us all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,250) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis had dynamited the approach roads and their
reinforced living quarters and their artillery bunkers. But we
could still climb through the smoldering wreckage of their most
powerful gun battery in Lebanon and clamber up the ancient Crusader
steps to the original ramparts
</P>
<P>
   There were children in party clothes, families picnicking in the
grass and an ice-cream van that came chugging through the
desolation to sell chocolate cornets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,475) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   At the very top, where Israel's soldiers had only hours before
been peering from an observation platform, there was a stone
parapet and a massive Hezbollah flag in which the ``l'' of
``Allah'' is formed of a Kalashnikov rifle.
</P>
<P>
   So I climbed into the khaki-colored post from which Israel's
soldiers had looked out each night in fear and trepidation and, no
doubt, loathing for their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And all before me was spread the land of Lebanon, up to the
2,000-year-old cedars of the Chouf Mountains, across to the snows
of Mount Hermon which Salahadin had once sent to Richard the
Lionheart as a cure for sickness and down to the flat, mellow lands
of Galilee. I could see the Mediterranean and the border of Syria
and half way to Haifa.
</P>
<P>
   And the message? That the Israelis lost and the Hezbollah won?
Definitely. But something else. That high-tech fighter-bombers and
precision artillery and massively armored soldiers are not
necessarily a match for people who think they have God as their
commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   Not a happy thought for everyone living in the Middle East. &QL;

   BUSH-TEXAS-GOP (Austin, Texas) _ George W. Bush was denied a
governor's traditional role as chairman of the state delegation to
the Republican National Convention four years ago by the socially
conservative Texas Republican Convention. Now, as the party's
apparent presidential nominee, he has no plans to attend this
year's state convention in Houston. Bush spokesman Karen Hughes
says the governor likely will be campaigning in another state
during the Texas meeting. By CLAY ROBISON and R. G. RATCLIFFE.

   SCOTUS-FUTURE (Washington) _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush and Vice
President Al Gore are fighting for more than just the White House
this year. The presidential election winner could be handed a rare
opportunity to alter the direction of the Supreme Court. With the
court split 5-4 on major issues and several justices over the age
of 70, the next president could shape the court to an extent not
enjoyed by a chief executive since the early 1980s. By STEVE LASH.

   SECURITY-BREACH (Washington) _ Attorney General Janet Reno,

to revamp her department's security system. That means guards will
stop giving preferential treatment to fellow law officers. We check
other federal agencies where security was breached. By MARK HELM.

   MEANS-COLUMN (Washington) _ The trouble with determining the
appropriate legal consequences of Bill Clinton's misdeeds is that
no one is neutral toward him. After an Arkansas panel recommended
the harshest penalty it could _ disbarment _ one of the

drivers in Killeen, Texas. Not much stands between Dwight Loving,
34, of Rochester, N.Y., and lethal injection at the Ft.
Leavenworth, Kan., federal penitentiary _ except President Clinton
and what his lawyers and other legal experts complain is a vague
and unfair bureaucratic process now under way in the Army. By ERIC

   KFAR KILA _ They stood along the border fence and stared at the
impossible.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah men _ hundreds of them, in their combat fatigues
and with their rifles in their hands and their flak jackets over
their shoulders _ just stood in silence beside me and looked out,
awestruck, at the fields and orchards of Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   Bathed in the blue mist of dawn, Israel _ or Palestine as the
Hezbollah men called it _ looked almost holy. We could see the glow
of oranges in the trees and hear the water dripping from an
irrigation tap and, not so far away, see the red roofs of homes.
</P>
<P>
   The gunman beside me breathed in deeply. ``Azeem,'' he said.
``Incredible.''
</P>
<P>
   And it was. Here they were, the bearded men who had routed one
of the world's most powerful armies, standing at last on the very
frontier of Israel after driving the last Israeli soldier the last
mile out of Lebanon. In fact, the Israeli border wire was only
three feet from us.
</P>
<P>
   And there was Sheikh Sami Khadra, one of the Hezbollah's senior
clerics, standing in his white turban and long black robes, staring
into Galilee.
</P>
<P>
   There was no overt hostility, no threat, no raised rifle. At one
point a white Israeli van drove down the other side of the wire,
the driver waving oddly at the Hezbollah men.
</P>
<P>
   Had the world gone mad? Sheikh Khadra did not think so. ``It is
a reality more than a dream,'' he said. ``But it is a sight we
could not have dreamed about. We have moved south and now, we hear,
the Jewish settlers over there are frightened and moving south.''
It was God's work, one of the Hezbollah men said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM _ 175 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 300) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The sheikh's armed protectors searched the horizon for Israeli
troops. There were none to be seen. Just that morning mist and the
dew on the trees and the odd feeling that the Hezbollah war had
come to an end.
</P>
<P>
   The men who fought their way from Beirut had at last reached the
border and looked upon the land of their enemies and understood the
transitory nature of victory.
</P>
<P>
   Behind us a convoy of cars was waiting for the Hezbollah to fill
up a mine crater _ the Israelis had left a few hours earlier by
detonating all the Lebanese approach roads to the frontier _ and
loudspeakers perched on trucks vibrated with Muslim prayers.
</P>
<P>
   There were children in some of the cars and a woman who threw
rice and rose petals over the Hezbollah men, many of whom glowered
from Mercedes cars with smoked windows, rifle barrels resting on
their knees, two-way radios crackling. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF FIRST OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Did they want to cross that border fence? It did not seem so.
The Palestinians had to secure their own liberation. That's the way
the conversation went beside the Israeli frontier wire Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Hezbollah had come to look, the most privileged sightseers
in the whole world. Over and over they used that same word:
``Azeem.'' ``Incredible.'' Only one man did I hear talking about
``the liquidation of Zionism.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the same all across southern Lebanon Wednesday, as if the
guerrilla victory had not been fully comprehended. But it was a
virtual rout.
</P>
<P>
   The ``South Lebanon Army'' _ Israeli's final protectors in this
dangerous land _ had abandoned their tanks and trucks and
ammunition and guns in the fields, the roads, their barracks and
their homes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 600) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   In the Christian town of Marjayoun, the home of Antoine Lahd,
the SLA leader, was systematically looted by gunmen from the rival
_ and venal _ Amal movement. They drove captured tanks through the
streets, the engines roaring as they crushed pavements and flower
gardens. A mobile artillery piece _ a big Israeli army gun _ was
driven around the town. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF SECOND OPTIONAL TRIM) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Israel had said it would not disarm the SLA. It didn't need to.
We saw some of them, young men with heads lowered, standing with
Hezbollah members who were reading through their identification
papers. But there was no revenge killing. No massacre. The
Hezbollah stayed out of Christian towns.
</P>
<P>
   Amal were not so disciplined. And I did begin to wonder whether
things might crack if the Lebanese army or the United Nations did
not bring some troops in here quickly. I think it was a visit to
the old SLA ``war'' memorial that worried me.
</P>
<P>
   The SLA's ``martyrs'' _ collaborators to the victors of this war
_ were commemorated in a Muslim-Christian shrine on a hill and a
garden in which each dead gunman's name, listed by town and
religion, was fixed on a brass plaque to marble walls.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eternity to our heroic martyrs,'' it says over the door. I
thought it might be the first place to be destroyed and when I
arrived there Wednesday, militiamen and civilians from nearby
villages were already looting the memorial, making off with sofas
and computers and chairs.
</P>
<P>
   I found one Shiite Muslim woman on her hands and knees, digging
up rose bushes from the garden with a crazed look on her face.
</P>
<P>
   And along the memorial wall, I discovered a tall, bearded man
with a knife, cutting one of the brass plaques off the marble. The
name was that of Akl Ibrahim Hashem, one of the most senior
officers in the SLA who was blown up by a Hezbollah mine on Jan. 3
this year.
</P>
<P>
   The bearded man held the plaque out to me with a laugh. ``I'm
taking this one because it is still fresh.'' And other men then
came to cut out more of the plaques. They were killing the dead.
</P>
<P>
   The Muslim villages were awash with yellow Hezbollah banners and
overzealous praise for their liberators. ``A special gratitude to
the Hezbollah'' on a poster in one formerly occupied village did
not have quite the ring of veracity.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Christian villages, the flags were only Lebanese and
the questions only about the date of the Lebanese army's arrival.
No time, we told them. No date. And the same goes for the U.N. But
I noticed how the Christians gathered not on the street but beside
their stone churches.
</P>
<P>
   And I watched the Amal men and their families looting their way
through SLA headquarters with a greed that bordered on madness,
making off with desks, old clothes, magazines, trucks, cars,
anything that was detachable from the buildings. The tanks they
drove were taken through the towns too fast, too many times.
</P>
<P>
   On the hilltop road above Marjayoun, the Hezbollah were more
careful. They planted their flag on a T-55 battle tank and sat
there in the afternoon sun as we drove past, nodding
acknowledgement at each motorist.
</P>
<P>
   But if anything symbolizes Israel's defeat and Hezbollah's
victory, it is the old Crusader castle of Beaufort.
</P>
<P>
   High above the Litani River gorge, it was bombed by the Israelis
when Palestinians used it as a mortar position in the late
seventies, then occupied by Israeli paratroopers _ at great cost _
in 1982. It was as impregnable a fortress for the Israelis as it
had once been to the knights of France.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday, it was open to us all. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM _ 75 WORDS _ BEGINS HERE AT 1,250) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   The Israelis had dynamited the approach roads and their
reinforced living quarters and their artillery bunkers. But we
could still climb through the smoldering wreckage of their most
powerful gun battery in Lebanon and clamber up the ancient Crusader
steps to the original ramparts
</P>
<P>
   There were children in party clothes, families picnicking in the
grass and an ice-cream van that came chugging through the
desolation to sell chocolate cornets. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; (END OF THIRD OPTIONAL TRIM. STORY CONTINUES TO 1,475) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   At the very top, where Israel's soldiers had only hours before
been peering from an observation platform, there was a stone
parapet and a massive Hezbollah flag in which the ``l'' of
``Allah'' is formed of a Kalashnikov rifle.
</P>
<P>
   So I climbed into the khaki-colored post from which Israel's
soldiers had looked out each night in fear and trepidation and, no
doubt, loathing for their enemies.
</P>
<P>
   And all before me was spread the land of Lebanon, up to the
2,000-year-old cedars of the Chouf Mountains, across to the snows
of Mount Hermon which Salahadin had once sent to Richard the
Lionheart as a cure for sickness and down to the flat, mellow lands
of Galilee. I could see the Mediterranean and the border of Syria
and half way to Haifa.
</P>
<P>
   And the message? That the Israelis lost and the Hezbollah won?
Definitely. But something else. That high-tech fighter-bombers and
precision artillery and massively armored soldiers are not
necessarily a match for people who think they have God as their
commander-in-chief.
</P>
<P>
   Not a happy thought for everyone living in the Middle East. &QL;

`SHANGHAI NOON': NEW AGE MEETS OLD WEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end of review) 
 By A.O. SCOTT    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``This is the West, not the East.'' So Roy O'Bannon (Owen
Wilson), a scruffy, laid-back outlaw of dubious competence,
admonishes his reluctant partner, an imperial guard from the
Forbidden City named Chon Wang (pronounced like John Wayne and
played by the incomparable Jackie Chan). In ``Shanghai Noon,'' Tom
Dey's slapstick kung fu horse opera, the twain meet in a series of
rousing comic collisions, but in the geography of global pop
culture they've never been all that far apart.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong action films of the 1970s and '80s (where Chan
first became a star) owe as much to the spaghetti westerns of the
'60s as the spaghetti westerns owe to earlier samurai movies, which
in turn were inspired by the classic John Ford and Howard Hawks
cowboy pictures, which grew out of the old Tom Mix two-reelers, and
so on all the way back to ``The Great Train Robbery'' almost a
century ago.
</P>
<P>
   But who cares? Jackie Chan _ whose given name, Kong Sang Chan,
means ``born in Hong Kong'' _ is an entertainer whose appeal
transcends differences of culture, age and taste. The appreciation
of his genius requires no excursions into the history of cinema.
It's nonetheless worth noting that, in an age of widespread movie
star narcissism, when sullen vanity often stands in for seriousness
and lazy cynicism for wit, Chan recalls the icons of an earlier
time, the improbably graceful, silly clowns of the silent era:
Charlie Chaplin, Buster Keaton, Harold Lloyd, who are his deepest
source of inspiration.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Shanghai Noon'' his astonishing physical gifts find a
perfect counterpoint in Wilson's goofy verbal riffing. The two of
them are thrown together when Chon is dispatched to the rugged Old
West to rescue a kidnapped princess (Lucy Liu), and finds himself
transporting her ransom on the very train Roy and his gang have
decided to rob. Roy has a spacey, surfer-dude approach to outlawry,
and he mystifies the tightly wound Chon with his loopy New Age
pronouncements.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need to relax,'' he admonishes Chon when they are forced
to share a jail cell. ``You are the most irritable guy I've ever
been around.'' Later, before a shootout with the main heavy, one
Marshal Van Cleef (Xander Berkeley), Roy's inner voice tells him to
``be the bullet,'' and he screams at his impatient adversary: ``I
won't let you cheapen this! A duel is a sacred moment.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie benefits from an unusually witty, high-spirited
script, by Alfred Gough and Miles Millar, the authors of ``Lethal
Weapon 4.'' There are moments that echo Mel Brooks' ``Blazing
Saddles,'' but instead of Brooks' borscht belt ethnic insult humor,
``Shanghai Noon'' traffics in the high farce of multicultural
misunderstanding. It tweaks stereotypes even as it spoofs
multicultural sensitivity. (``That's taken out of context,'' Roy
protests after Chon confronts him about some overheard anti-Chinese
remarks.)
</P>
<P>
   It's not easy to wring comedy from the history of Chinese
laborers and American Indians in the Old West, but somehow the
filmmakers finesse the issue without evading it entirely. And a
hint of upbeat patriotism finds its way into the mix. The first
English phrases Chon learns are ``America'' and ``happily ever
after,'' and his adventures are a raucous celebration of the
raucous, slapdash individualism that is part of the West's _ or at
least the western's _ most vital legacy.
</P>
<P>
   In an early, especially inspired sequence, Chon is taken in by
some Indians, for whom his rudimentary English might as well be
Mandarin. After a night of heavy peace-pipe smoking _ featuring a
hilarious montage of his increasingly pixilated face _ Chon wakes
up to find himself with a new wife (Brandon Merrill), a new name
(Fights-in-a-Dress) and a lot of face paint. (Later he turns up on
wanted posters as the Shanghai Kid, even though, as he points out,
he's not from Shanghai at all.)
</P>
<P>
   Resplendent in his Indian warrior-imperial guard get-up, he
walks into a saloon, where ... but just go see it, already. Chan's
fight scenes are like nothing else in the movies, and they're
staged without trickery or flashy special effects. The thrill is
like that of watching a great athlete or musician; it's a perfect
marriage of discipline and grace.
</P>
<P>
   It's also giddily, effervescently funny, like the complicated
Chinese drinking game Chon and Roy play in adjoining bathtubs or
the drunken horse routine that follows. There's a motley assortment
of villains (notably the feline Roger Yuan and the donkeyish Walton
Goggins) and some vague love interests lurking in the background _
the Indian bride and the fairy tale princess, who both seem like
pretty good sports. But ``Shanghai Noon'' is, in classic western
tradition, a celebration of male bonding, unabashedly juvenile,
boyishly risque and disarmingly sweet. Wilson and Chan have enough
chemistry to fuel a string of sequels.
</P>
<P>
   OK, so not all the jokes work, and the plot limps a little
toward the end. No matter. After the glum bullying of ``Gladiator''
and the noisy bombast of ``M:I-2,'' it's refreshing to see a movie
so good natured, so confident of its ability to provoke not queasy
awe or numb exhaustion but pure delight. ``You have a certain
nobility,'' Roy tells Chon in a moment of misty cowboy sentiment.
In the context of the movie, the line is pure hokum, but applied to
Chan, it's right on the money.
</P>
<P>

`PASSION OF MIND': A WOMAN OF TWO MINDS ... OR TWO LOVES ... OR ...
 
</HEADLINE>
  (Production notes at end of review) 
 By ELVIS MITCHELL    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Demi Moore stars in the dreamscape ``Passion of Mind,'' one of
those other-side-of-the-looking glass pictures. During the daylight
hours she's Marie and lives in a sun-dappled chateau in Provence
with her two daughters, writing book reviews for The New York
Times. And when she closes her eyes at night, she's living in
gray-blue Manhattan as Marty, a literary agent with her hair pulled
back to heighten the severity of her loveless life in the big city.
Fortunately she doesn't get around to reviewing any of the books by
authors she signed, or there could be a very nasty battle between
the two at Elaine's.
</P>
<P>
   Marie/Marty is aware of the assets and liabilities of both
states, though she is unsure which is reality and which a dream. So
Marie seeks the counsel of a friend about her roiling fantasy life,
while Marty does it the old-fashioned Manhattanite way: she talks
to a shrink, who never asks if she actually gets any rest during
her extremely active dream life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know who I am anymore,'' she says in the opening
narration, and it's easy to see where that sentiment comes from.
It's the gauzy and underdramatized conception of the movie that
lacks passion; she wanders through both of her lives terribly
unfulfilled because she can't have what she wants: romance.
</P>
<P>
   The film really should be called ``Fashion of Mind,'' since the
decor in both of her unrealities seems like something conjured by
someone who has spent more time fantasizing about layouts in
Architectural Digest than meeting deadlines. Anyone with this kind
of specificity about the dwellings in her dreams has problems that
this movie can't be bothered to develop; most people can't even
remember what they wear in their dreams. In her New York apartment
she has a bust of herself that is meant to suggest some
psychological undercurrent but really looks like the kind of thing
she sculptured with Patrick Swayze in ``Ghost,'' another
fantasy-film landmark in Moore's career.
</P>
<P>
   With its dual and dueling-worlds structure, ``Passion'' may put
viewers in mind of last year's ``Sliding Doors,'' which starred
Gwyneth Paltrow, though it's much closer to the 1987 puzzle picture
``Julia and Julia,'' in which Kathleen Turner played a woman who
was married in one reality and involved in a soft-core romantic
blaze in another.
</P>
<P>
   There's a self-pitying side to ``Passion,'' with these ideal
existences that both cry out for the love of a good man. Stellan
Skarsgard is courting Marie in Europe, and the talented and
eccentric William Fichtner, who manages to vary his appearance with
every role, is the awkward and intense man seeking Marty's love in
America.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem with such movies is that the audience often
ends up feeling as if the creators themselves haven't committed to
a single world to focus on; it's hard enough to make one reality
work in movies and find a consistent tone for it. The tensions have
to be built on contrasts that aren't sharp enough in ``Passion,''
especially since Marty/Marie has most of the things women her age
would dream about. This situation also seems like the kind of ``you
can have it all but not really'' projection that a much younger
woman would have.
</P>
<P>
   To her credit, Moore is far too mature for the audience to
believe that she is trapped in this purgatory. It's a difficult
conceit to pull off, and not because she isn't working at it.
Marie's relationship with her children, though slightly idealized,
is thorny at times, as they compete for her attention, a grown-up
touch contributed by the star, who apparently has huge stores of
maternal warmth and patience. The director, Alain Berliner (``Ma
Vie en Rose''), gives ``Passion'' an anonymous polish, but there's
a definite sense that someone's hands are tied, perhaps by the
both-sides-now whininess of the script by Ron Bass (``Rain Man,''
``My Best Friend's Wedding'').
</P>
<P>
   Visually there's certainly a difference between the worlds,
thanks to Eduardo Serra's cinematography. And since Marie and Marty
are literally the day and night sides of the same woman, the halved
personas need to open up and learn to love again.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to take ``Passion'' seriously because it brings to
mind the kind of shallow psychology that wouldn't be out of place
in a history short about Sigmund Freud on ``ABC Schoolhouse Rock.''
If there's a sequel, perhaps Marie could have Marty represent her
for the sale of her book or, at the very least, negotiate the deal
for the made-for-Lifetime movie. Apparently she's the kind of
driven negotiator it would take to sell the mild Harlequin Romance
simple-mindedness of ``Passion of Mind.''

&HT;     `YARN LADIES' KNIT CLOTHING FOR INFANTS AND SENIOR CITIZENS 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PAUL GRONDAHL  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union

<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ The two middle-aged women entered St. Peter's
Hospital here looking as if they were bound for a church bazaar or
country fair. Their plastic shopping bags were bulging with
crocheted blankets, knit sweaters and caps in pastel hues.
</P>
<P>
   Passers-by paid little attention.
</P>
<P>
   Which is how these self-described ``yarn ladies'' like it.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the quiet revolution,'' said Maria Mathisen, an organizer
of the loosely knit and anonymous skein of volunteers who crochet
and knit clothing for infants and senior citizens.
</P>
<P>
   The knitters and crocheters are as diverse as the recipients of
their free handiwork: troubled teenage girls in group homes, women
with church organizations, commuters who crochet on trains and
buses, and the homebound elderly. They prefer to remain behind the
scenes in this labor of love.
</P>
<P>
   One 98-year-old woman, for instance, has completed more than 100
crocheted lap robes for nursing homes without attention or reward.
She claims the work helps limber up her arthritic fingers and
provides other, less tangible benefits such as adding purpose to
her largely solitary days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knitting is therapy and it fills many needs,'' said Ann
Mulford of Burnt Hills, who is a co-organizer.
</P>
<P>
   On this morning at the hospital, Mathisen and Mulford delivered
a few of the dozens of hand-knit items of infant wear that they
provide each month to several local hospitals, including Albany
Medical Center, Ellis, Bellevue and Glens Falls.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy and Mark Novak of Albany accepted for their newborn
daughter, Sarah Kate, a pink and green knit cap, pink and white
blanket and pink pastel sweater dropped off by Mulford.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really great handiwork,'' Kathy Novak said, inspecting
the pattern. ``I always wished I'd learned to knit from my
grandmother, but I haven't.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, Mulford gave Molly Nichols of Albany matching
green and pink pastel caps and sweaters for Nichols' twin infant
daughters, Chloe and Emma.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's adorable,'' Nichols said of the knit clothing. ``They'll
wear it home tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The parents really appreciate the fine hand-knit work,'' said
Margaret Wilkinson, a lactation specialist at St. Peter's. ``We're
very fortunate to have the volunteers.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilkinson said the need for the knit and crocheted items is
especially acute with premature babies in the hospital's neonatal
intensive care unit.
</P>
<P>
   The yarn ladies take particular care in organizing knitting and
crocheting patterns in sizes to fit the premies. That's how the two
women met in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   Mulford, 59, who's retired from a job at Dunkin' Donuts, gave
birth to a preemie daughter at St. Peter's in 1979. That same year,
Mathisen formed Milk for Life, a volunteer effort to provide human
milk to infants suffering illness or allergies requiring human milk
to survive.
</P>
<P>
   Mulford and Mathisen joined hundreds of volunteer donors who
solicited, donated, transported, stored, packaged and mailed breast
milk from 1979 to 1991, when the milk bank folded for lack of
funds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mulford has teamed up once again with Mathisen, 50, a
former residential aide for retarded adults who was disabled on the
job. The yarn ladies, who don't have a formal name for the
organization, started the project about one year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Mathisen, who's been knitting since she was a teenager, found
that the disability left her stuck at home with time on her hands,
as well as leftover yarn.
</P>
<P>
   Mulford asked Mathisen to make a preemie hat. She did.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, Mulford, a knitter with 45 years' experience, got her
friends at the United Methodist Church in Burnt Hills, an Albany
suburb, to lend their help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We started delivering to maternity units at hospitals and
everyone kept asking for more,'' Mathisen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's grown into a wide network,'' Mulford said.
</P>
<P>
   Typical was the recent flannel blanket brigade. A Catskill,
N.Y., resident donated 15 yards of flannel, which was sent to
Mathisen, who passed it to Mulford, who enlisted the aid of her
church women's group. Church members added a backing layer, trimmed
the blankets in lace and cord work and completed 10 fancy blankets.
</P>
<P>
   In one year, the yarn network has grown to more than 100
volunteer knitters and crocheters from throughout the Capital
Region, as well as New Jersey, Connecticut, North Carolina and
Wisconsin.

NEW BOOK FOR PARENTS OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN BOYS TACKLES TOUGH TOPICS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GRACIE BONDS STAPLES 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ When all is said and done, Carolyn Roberts
will likely measure how well she did as a parent by the lifespan of
each of her two sons.
</P>
<P>
   That isn't to say that the life of her daughter, Mocha, doesn't
matter. It does.
</P>
<P>
   But for Roberts, it's the difficult mother-to-son talks she has
had to have with Malcolm and Marcus that she believes may mean the
difference between life and death. No sooner did the boys' voices
begin to change from tenor to bass than she sat them down and
detailed for them exactly what to do _ and not do _ should they
ever be stopped by police.
</P>
<P>
   ``It really grieved me to have to do it, but they've had those
instructions since junior high school,'' said Roberts, an
administrative assistant for the city of Fort Worth. ``It's better
to be prepared and alive than not prepared and in prison or dead.''
</P>
<P>
   Roberts' need to talk with her sons about racial profiling _
defined in a recent Gallup poll survey as when ``police officers
stop motorists of certain racial or ethnic groups because the
officers believe that these groups are more likely than others to
commit certain types of crime'' _ is a unique challenge that the
Fort Worth single mother shares with minority parents across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   The teen-age years for most parents and their kids are trying
under the best circumstances. But for parents of African-American
boys, those years can be particularly overwhelming when coupled
with discrimination and racism. Racial profiling is just one of the
issues that must be faced.
</P>
<P>
   To help parents maneuver through these singular challenges,
psychologists Nancy Boyd-Franklin and her husband, A.J. Franklin,
have written a 250-page survival guide. ``Boys Into Men: Raising
Our African-American Teenage Sons,'' released this month by Dutton,
addresses everything from strategies to help build strong racial
identity to signs for recognizing a possible substance-abuse
problem to pointers on how to talk to your children about matters
like racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel very strongly that a worried parent could pick this
book up and use it as a resource,'' said Nancy Boyd-Franklin in a
recent telephone interview from her home in Princeton, N.J. ``It
covers drugs, gangs, violence, sex, media influences, racial
profiling.''
</P>
<P>
   But Boyd-Franklin said the book goes beyond how-to advice.
``Boys Into Men'' also focuses on the importance of spirituality in
the African-American community and sends the message that parents
can make a difference in their boys' lives and, when necessary,
take them back from the street.
</P>
<P>
   Boyd-Franklin believes the guide is long overdue. The issues it
addresses, particularly racial profiling, have been around for
generations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big issue when I was growing up,'' Boyd-Franklin
said. ``It's like deja vu. Our youngest is 16, and these issues
have not gone away.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racial profiling is a serious issue in our communities,'' she
said. ``In the northeast we have a saying _ `Driving While Black' _
and DWB happens all the time. (Racial profiling) happens in urban
areas, suburban areas and even rural areas, so you really need to
prepare your sons so that they're not caught unaware, so that they
know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Carolyn Roberts says that both of her sons _ Malcolm Roberts,
now a 21-year-old cadet at the U.S. Air Force Academy in Colorado
Springs, and Marcus, a 20-year-old pre-law student at Morehouse
College in Atlanta _ have been stopped by police on several
occasions.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said that even though she has had talks with her sons
about how to respond to these police encounters, she still worries
about what might happen. When driving home from Morehouse, Marcus
must always stop to call home, and he must stop often.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell them I need you to call me,'' she said. ``I need to
hear your voice as you're coming through those states, and they do
that.''
</P>
<P>
   If Roberts may seem a bit overwrought, Boyd-Franklin and other
experts say that given the racial climate, parents can't be overly
concerned about their children's safety _ particularly if they are
raising African-American males.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Alvin Poussaint, a professor of psychiatry at Harvard
Medical School and Judge Baker Children's Center, said ``Boys Into
Men'' is an excellent resource for black parents trying to guide
their sons through the high-risk teen-age years. Poussaint,
co-author, with James P. Comer, of ``Raising Black Children''
(Plume, $14.95), said the Franklins' book is important because it
focuses specifically on black males and the special issues they
face, like racial profiling.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are high-risk situations for black men, as we've seen
repeatedly in New York City,'' he said. ``Black men generate a lot
of fear of being muggers, being rapists and murderers, and people
respond to them that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Such stereotypes, he said, are damaging to black males on a lot
of fronts and might explain why they are disproportionately
represented in special-education classes. Teachers and
administrators, he said, often misread them, give up on them.
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   ``They have to overcome more obstacles than even black girls
do,'' said Poussaint.
</P>
<P>
   This is why it is so important for parents, Boyd-Franklin said,
to teach their sons to remain proud, hold onto their own dignity
and not do anything foolish in these situations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's sad and it's infuriating for many, many of us as parents,
but we can't allow our sadness to stop us from taking action, from
doing what we need to do to keep our kids safe,'' said
Boyd-Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   She said parents shouldn't worry too much about putting undue
pressure on their children by raising issues of race. It's far
better to inoculate them against racism rather than leave them
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to let our kids know that racism exists, and we have
to do it in such a way that they don't end up being bitter or
having a negative attitude toward themselves,'' said Boyd-Franklin.
</P>
<P>
   As a single parent, Roberts said not having ``the talk'' with
her sons would've done greater harm to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not educating them about what I know is out there would be the
greater disservice,'' she said. ``Black children don't have the
luxury of thinking life is great, that the playing field is always
even. I couldn't lie to my children like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Keeping their children safe, and not just from police, is the
No. 1 concern Boyd-Franklin and her husband hear from
African-American parents in their practice. The second, she said,
is education, followed by peer pressure and drug and alcohol abuse.
The authors, both of whom are college professors, devote chapters
to each of those concerns in ``Boys Into Men.''
</P>
<P>
   Boyd-Franklin said that parents are finding out that they really
have to be vigilant about their sons' education, that they can't
just put them in school and hope for the best.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, she said, parents are struggling to counter the
message from peer groups that ``to be smart is to be white.'' ``We
really have to pass on the message that they can be a proud black
man and be smart.''
</P>
<P>
   The book ends with a chapter that encourages parents to seek
support from other parents and surround themselves with people of
faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not know where I would be as a parent if I did not have a
deep spiritual belief and hope,'' said Boyd-Franklin. ``We feel
very deeply and strongly that it takes spiritual strength to raise
our children. You have to hold onto hope, really keep believing in
your kids no matter what they are showing you at the moment. Keep
believing you can make a difference and they are going to be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   WHAT PARENTS SHOULD KNOW ABOUT RACIAL PROFILING &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although much of the evidence supporting the occurrence of
racial profiling is anecdotal rather than statistical, a national
Gallup poll released in December of last year revealed that 59
percent of Americans believe that the practice is widespread. The
Gallup Poll Social Audit on Black/White Relations defined racial
profiling as the practice by which ``police officers stop motorists
of certain racial or ethnic groups because the officers believe
that these groups are more likely than others to commit certain
types of crimes.'' More than four out of 10 black Americans said
that they had been the victims of racial profiling, including
almost three-quarters of young black men ages 18 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   In a March 1999 letter that appeared in The Wall Street Journal,
Rutgers University sociology Professor Jackson Toby argued that
racial profiling does not necessarily prove that police are racist.
Toby did cite these statistics, however: A survey sponsored by the
New Jersey Office of the Public Defender showed that blacks
accounted for 13 percent of drivers on the south end of the New
Jersey Turnpike; 15 percent of speeders; and 35 percent of those
stopped by the state police.
</P>
<P>
   In a campaign to stop racial profiling by law-enforcement
agencies, the American Civil Liberties Union this year distributed
some 50,000 Driving While Black or Brown kits to attendees of the
McDonald's Heritage Bowl in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The kits include a sample letter to members of Congress urging
support for a bill that addresses the problem; stickers with the
phone numbers of the ACLU's toll-free hot line (877-6-PROFILE) for
reporting race-based traffic stops; information on the progress of
national, state, and local experts in addressing the problem; and a
wallet-sized copy of the ACLU's ``bust card,'' which explains what
to do when stopped by police.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, ``Boys Into Men'' includes these guidelines parents
should share with their son in case he is ever stopped by police:
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not try to run away.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not make any sudden moves.
</P>
<P>
   _ Keep hands visible or raised in the air.
</P>
<P>
   _ Say, ``I'm not armed.''
</P>
<P>
   _ Respond to directives from police.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not resist arrest or resist being searched.
</P>
<P>
   _ Do not act smart or talk back.
</P>
<P>
   _ Say, ``Yes, sir'' and ``No, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   _ As soon as possible, ask to call parents or family for help.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask for a lawyer to be present before saying anything.

 &HT;    LAWMAKERS, REGULATORS AND INDUSTRY DIVIDED ON ENSURING ONLINE
PRIVACY
 &HT;    DUPLICATION ALERT: Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial
categories
 &HT;    By BOB DART

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Everyone who spoke Thursday in the overflowing
Senate hearing room proclaimed that privacy should be protected for
online customers of dot.com businesses _ but hardly anyone agreed
on how to do it.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Senate Commerce Committee were split over whether
new federal laws are needed to prevent electronic intrusion of
Internet consumers. The Internet industry generally thought
legislation was a bad idea and self-regulation was the way to go.
Even the Federal Trade Commission _ which earlier this week
recommended congressional action _ was divided over whether new
privacy standards should apply to traditional brick-and-mortar
businesses as well as to e-commerce.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., expressed hope that
the hearing ``will begin the process of developing (a) consensus
about the best way'' to ``enable consumers to protect their privacy
online.''
</P>
<P>
   The session was called in response to a report that the FTC
issued to Congress on Monday. After a four-year study, the agency
concluded that voluntary efforts to ensure privacy are not working
with e-commerce and legislation is needed to ``provide online
consumers the level of protection they seek and deserve.''
</P>
<P>
   The intense interest in the issue was demonstrated by the
lobbyists, journalists and regulators who filled all the seats in
the ornate chambers. They leaned against the walls, sat on the
floor and lined up on the marble stairs outside in hopes a seat
would open in the audience.
</P>
<P>
   Internet firms routinely use high-tech means to collect and sell
information about people who visit their websites _ often without
adequately informing the online customers and giving them a chance
to ``opt out,'' FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that as many as 92 percent of Internet users ``do
not trust online companies to keep their information
confidential,'' Pitofsky testified. These fears could hinder the
growth of Internet commerce, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, he said, a majority of the five-member FTC
believes Congress should act promptly on federal safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   However, Commissioner Orson Swindle made clear that he was not
among the majority in this ``embarrassingly flawed'' report.
``Industry self-regulation is working,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Thomas Levy concurred with the need for regulation
but said ``any legislation should apply to off-line commerce as
well.'' Otherwise, he said, the ``regulatory imbalance'' could
inhibit the growth of Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   However, Commissioner Mozelle Thompson said the Internet is
unique in its ability to instantly collect and distribute data
about unsuspecting users and that special rules are needed there.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions were similarly splintered within the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The need for legislation was endorsed by Democrats Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Jay Rockefeller
of West Virginia, as well as Republican Conrad Burns of Montana.
However, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said
not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he has doubts whether Congress ``has the ability to
move adroitly enough'' to ensure privacy on the rapidly evolving
Internet without jeopardizing development of this digital economy.
</P>
<P>
   However, McCain said the FTC report showed that too many
Internet businesses are not telling customers ``in a clear and
conspicuous manner'' what information they are collecting and
selling and don't give consumers ``meaningful choices'' on how that
data will be used.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses from the online marketplace, though, said the FTC was
wrong in its dire assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I entirely disagree with the conclusion that privacy in
cyberspace is woefully inadequate and that legislation is
necessary,'' testified Christine Varney. A former FTC commissioner,
she represented the Online Privacy Alliance, a coalition of over
100 Internet industry and trade associations, ranging from America
Online to Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   Existing laws concerning health and medical privacy, credit card
theft and identity theft already apply to Internet businesses, she
said. New technology and software will soon stem the other abuses.

adequately informing the online customers and giving them a chance
to ``opt out,'' FTC Chairman Robert Pitofsky told the committee.
</P>
<P>
   Studies show that as many as 92 percent of Internet users ``do
not trust online companies to keep their information
confidential,'' Pitofsky testified. These fears could hinder the
growth of Internet commerce, he warned.
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, he said, a majority of the five-member FTC
believes Congress should act promptly on federal safeguards.
</P>
<P>
   However, Commissioner Orson Swindle made clear that he was not
among the majority in this ``embarrassingly flawed'' report.
``Industry self-regulation is working,'' he declared.
</P>
<P>
   Commissioner Thomas Levy concurred with the need for regulation
but said ``any legislation should apply to off-line commerce as
well.'' Otherwise, he said, the ``regulatory imbalance'' could
inhibit the growth of Internet business.
</P>
<P>
   However, Commissioner Mozelle Thompson said the Internet is
unique in its ability to instantly collect and distribute data
about unsuspecting users and that special rules are needed there.
</P>
<P>
   Opinions were similarly splintered within the committee.
</P>
<P>
   The need for legislation was endorsed by Democrats Ernest
Hollings of South Carolina, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Jay Rockefeller
of West Virginia, as well as Republican Conrad Burns of Montana.
However, Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass., and John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said
not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   Kerry said he has doubts whether Congress ``has the ability to
move adroitly enough'' to ensure privacy on the rapidly evolving
Internet without jeopardizing development of this digital economy.
</P>
<P>
   However, McCain said the FTC report showed that too many
Internet businesses are not telling customers ``in a clear and
conspicuous manner'' what information they are collecting and
selling and don't give consumers ``meaningful choices'' on how that
data will be used.
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses from the online marketplace, though, said the FTC was
wrong in its dire assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I entirely disagree with the conclusion that privacy in
cyberspace is woefully inadequate and that legislation is
necessary,'' testified Christine Varney. A former FTC commissioner,
she represented the Online Privacy Alliance, a coalition of over
100 Internet industry and trade associations, ranging from America
Online to Yahoo!
</P>
<P>
   Existing laws concerning health and medical privacy, credit card
theft and identity theft already apply to Internet businesses, she
said. New technology and software will soon stem the other abuses.

 0526-COX &HT;    Fast ride (long wait) to Bahamas
 &HT;    By Joel Engelhardt
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Never could it be said that my wife and I are
high-rollers. But then, even simple tourists shouldn't be treated
like this.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that the SeaJets crew didn't offer kind words,
sympathetic stares and occasionally helpful advice. It's just that
they didn't _ and often couldn't _ deliver what the company
promised in its ads.
</P>
<P>
   Take that thing about the 99 minutes travel time from the Port
of Palm Beach to the Bahamas. On the face, it is true. Once the
SeaJets craft is throttled up, we literally flew across the ocean
at 50 mph, making the 67-mile trip to Freeport on Grand Bahama
Island in 99 minutes, give or take a few.
</P>
<P>
   But what they didn't say is that you might have to wait . . .
and wait . . . and wait . . . to depart.
</P>
<P>
   We lined up, like they told us when we ordered our tickets, an
hour before our 3:30 p.m. Friday departure time. Two lines, later
expanded to three, reached the back of the room as travelers drawn
by SeaJets $99 fare, including a night at The Bahamian Resort and
Casino, waited most patiently.
</P>
<P>
   At 3:30, our departure time, we were still in line, still 10
minutes from completing our check-in. We finally prepared to board.
But not so fast.
</P>
<P>
   The SeaJets check-in building is not near the boat, er plane, or
whatever you want to call the fast-moving hydrofoil.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the check-in building is not on Port of Palm Beach
property.
</P>
<P>
   So after standing in line with 100 people for an hour and
watching our departure time come and go, we moved outside to await
a bus. The first shuttle appeared, the crowd surged into the hot
sun and waited as 32 people boarded _ a full busload. The remaining
passengers moved back.
</P>
<P>
   After another 10 minutes and a bus ride through the port's
industrial complex to the waiting boat, we were ready to go.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, the SeaJet was late, but we were told there would be free
soft drinks and chips aboard, plus $4 well drinks and $4
sandwiches. So we didn't think about bringing food.
</P>
<P>
   And it appeared all would be fine. The cabin is extremely
comfortable, much more so than a cramped airplane. It has two decks
and great sea views from everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   The engines revved up, the crew scurried about and then the
engines droned to a stop. The captain announced that the port had
ordered the SeaJets ship to wait, while the Contessa cruise ship
pulled out of port. Twenty minutes passed. Passengers craned their
necks to watch the mighty cruise ship lumber away. Another 10
minutes passed and then the engines revved up. We slowly pulled
from our dock, (neatly perched between the births of the port's two
giant cruise ships) entered Lake Worth, slipped by Palm Beach,
dodged small recreational boaters and entered the open sea. Then
the crew opened the throttles and the Boeing jets roared to life,
skimming at 50 mph 14 feet over the waves.
</P>
<P>
   All was right. Except we were hungry. And Doritos were not our
idea of nourishment. The ship carried no sandwiches this day (nor
on our return). Chips, soft drinks and alcohol, especially alcohol,
kept the passengers happy. At least they didn't run out of chips.
</P>
<P>
   While the company, which began service last November, estimates
its on-time performance at 85 percent, a review of Port of Palm
Beach records shows that since January the ship came and went
within 10 minutes of its scheduled time about half the time. Delays
occasionally topped one _ and even two _ hours. Port officials say
the records are not always precise and can be off by as much as 20
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   The delays come about for a wide range of reasons, including
immigration issues, tardy fuel trucks, luggage handling or
maintenance and repairs, SeaJets President George Bradley said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number one issue is safety,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, the vessel was damaged when a locking mechanism
failed while at sea. It stopped running for a week. Repairs closed
SeaJets down again for two weeks at the end of April.
</P>
<P>
   The on-time performance should improve when the port opens a new
cruise terminal next year, eliminating the bus ride to the port,
Bradley said. Plus, the company pushed back its departures from
Freeport to allow more time to prepare.
</P>
<P>
   Once at sea, the trip flew by. The landing at Freeport was
quick. Check-in meant another line but it moved fast. Then there
was another line for taxis _ seven-seat minivans that lined up to
offer rides for $3 to $8 _ and then on to the hotel, a lovely place
originally called the Princess Resort and Country Club. We entered
the circular lobby and confronted yet another line from the front
desk to the front doors.
</P>
<P>
   It took an hour to check in. Hint: Go eat at one of the hotel's
excellent restaurants because the line should be gone by the time
you're done with dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and a few warnings about the hotel. Check to see if you're
in the towers or the country club _ they have different lobbies,
different check-ins. And that $12 tax that SeaJets warned you about
_ it's actually $15 per person, per night. And that king-size bed?
Forget it, they only have 20. Expect two double beds even if your
SeaJets reservation specifies otherwise.
</P>
<P>
   So, they say 99 minutes to the Bahamas. But beware. It took us
six hours from check-in at 2:30 p.m. to flopping down on our
separate hotel beds at 8:30 p.m. And on the way back? Another
two-hour wait to depart.

 &HT;    Cruises for everyone's budget
 &HT;    By Cheryl Blackerby
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PALM BEACH, Fla. _ In the old days of cruising, only the wealthy
could afford to travel by ocean liner. They packed their ball gowns
and tuxedos into steamer trunks and paid lots of money for the
privilege of dining and dancing their way to exotic ports.
</P>
<P>
   But nowadays, just about any working stiff can go on a cruise,
especially if you don't mind an inside cabin. You can take a
four-night cruise to the Caribbean that includes dining and dancing
for under $500. You just have to buy (or rent) your own gown and
tuxedo.
</P>
<P>
   And, of course, if you have money and time to spare, you can
book a round-the-world, 105-day cruise on the Queen Elizabeth 2 for
just $30,000.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some great cruises for different budgets. Fares came
from the cruise lines and include taxes and port charges. Check
with travel agents for fares and special packages.
</P>
<P>
   HOW LONG: Three or four nights
</P>
<P>
   WHERE: Miami to Nassau or Cozumel
</P>
<P>
   For the price of a nice hotel room _ about $100 per day (per
person double) _ you can enjoy Las Vegas-style entertainment,
casino gambling, buffets and bingo on Carnival Cruise Lines' three-
and four-day Bahamas and Caribbean cruises. A three-night cruise on
the Ecstasy from Miami to Nassau is only $389 and a four-night
cruise from Miami to Key West and Cozumel is $399. The Ecstasy is a
stylish ship decorated in exuberant colors and neon lights.
Passengers tend to be singles and young couples who like to stay up
all night. The cruise to Nassau leaves every Friday and to Cozumel
every Monday.
</P>
<P>
   HOW LONG: Six or seven nights
</P>
<P>
   WHERE: New York to England, or Vancouver to Alaska
</P>
<P>
   You can ride in style from New York to England on the last
transatlantic liner, the Queen Elizabeth 2, for just $995 (per
person double) for an inside cabin for the six-night crossing. The
price includes economy air fare from London to 117 U.S. cities, and
all the old-world glamour you've seen on BBC period films. Another
option is Carnival's seven-night Alaska cruises from Vancouver to
Ketchikan, Juneau, Skagway and Sitka in June for $799 (not
including air fare).
</P>
<P>
   HOW LONG: Seven nights
</P>
<P>
   WHERE: Port Canaveral to St. Thomas, St. John and St. Maarten
</P>
<P>
   For a magical cruise to the Caribbean, there's the Disney Magic,
which will start sailing from Port Canaveral to St. Thomas, St.
John and St. Maarten in August. The fare for a great cabin with
private veranda and 1 1/2 baths starts at $1,383 (per person
double) in September and October. Rates start at $1,652 for a cabin
with balcony in August. There's nothing theme park-y about this
sophisticated ship, which has an elegant atrium (right), except for
occasional appearances by Mickey and Minnie and the Disney show
productions. No showgirls in thongs. First stop is Disney's private
island in the Bahamas, which has sandy beaches for families and one
for adults only.
</P>
<P>
   HOW LONG: Seven nights
</P>
<P>
   WHERE: Venice to Greece and Croatia
</P>
<P>
   Always wanted to go to Europe? You can do it the easy way on
Costa Cruise Line's CostaClassica's seven-night cruise from Venice
(in photo) to Bari, Italy; Santorini, Mykonos and Rhodes, Greece;
and Dubrovnik, Croatia. The fares start at $2,280 (per person
double) and include air fare from selected cities in the United
States, and two additional nights in Europe. The cruise line offers
similar cruises on the CostaAtlantica, the CostaVictoria and the
CostaRomantica to Greece, Turkey, Italy, Spain, France, Israel and
Egypt.
</P>
<P>
   HOW LONG: 17 days
</P>
<P>
   WHERE: London to New York
</P>
<P>
   Lucky you _ smart and rich. This could be the cruise for you.
The all-suite Seabourn Pride, one of the most luxurious ships
afloat, will make a 17-day Northern Island Crossing Sept. 3,

Denmark; Reykjavik, Iceland; Newfoundland and Nova Scotia; Newport,
R.I.; and New York. Fares start at $12,990 (per person double). Add
another $835 for air fare from the U.S. ($4,845 for first-class
air).
</P>
<P>
   Dreaming of something even more luxurious? You can book the
owner's suite for $30,400.
</P>
<P>
   Only 208 passengers live the sybaritic life in stylish
Scandinavian surroundings with a choice of open-seating restaurants
and a selection of services in the spa.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NAIROBI, Kenya _ Eritrean troops abruptly pulled back Thursday
from a key town still in dispute with Ethiopia, in what may be a
decisive step toward the end of a war that has claimed thousands of
lives and crippled two nations.
</P>
<P>
   As ever in this two-year war, the sides could not agree on what
happened Thursday: Ethiopia said Eritrean troops fled after a
punishing, two-day assault on positions around the town of
Zalembessa, which Ethiopia claims as its territory. As such,
Ethiopia said it had all but won the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was simple,'' said Selome Taddesse, an Ethiopian
spokeswoman. The Eritrean army, she said, ``was smashed, kicked,
destroyed, devastated, humiliated and sent packing and running.''
</P>
<P>
   But Eritrea, which has suffered major defeats since Ethiopia
mounted an offensive on May 12, said it withdrew to comply with a
plea on Wednesday from the Organization for African Unity to end
the war. Eritrea sought the moral high ground, saying the war was
not worth so many lives and that the burden was now on Ethiopia to
pull back from the huge swath of Eritrean land it captured during
the past two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think they will pull out,'' said Yemane Ghebremeskel,
a spokesman for Eritrea's president, Isaias Afwerki. ``I don't
think they are interested in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   Major questions, in fact, remain about whether either side is
ready for peace. There was still fighting Thursday along the
central front, though without the intensity of earlier battles. But
with Zalembessa, which Eritrea captured in June 1998, back in
Ethiopia's hands, Eritrea has lost a major strategic position,
perhaps so important that the war may now find its way to an end.
</P>
<P>
   That was, at any rate, the way Ethiopians took the news Thursday
in the capital city, Addis Ababa: Thousands of people thronged the
streets, beeping car horns and cheering for what they said was a
major victory. In Asmara, Eritrea's capital, the streets were
quiet.
</P>
<P>
   But relief groups said they would continue to work in western
Eritrea, where hundreds of thousands of people were reported
uprooted in the last week of fighting. The U.N. World Food Program
on Thursday sent 79 tons of high energy biscuits to feed nearly
40,000 Eritreans displaced in the west.
</P>
<P>
   The deliveries will continue, officials said, until the fighting
is over and perhaps beyond, depending on whether people are able to
get back home and plant crops. ``At the moment, it's unclear, it's
unpredictable, it's fluid,'' said Lindsey Davies, a World Food
Program spokeswoman in Asmara.
</P>
<P>
   The war broke out in May 1998, between two nations on the Horn
of Africa that were once the closest of friends. Eritrea, for
decades the northernmost province of Ethiopia, became independent
in 1993 with Ethiopia's blessing in a swell of good feeling after
fighters from north and south overthrew the military dictatorship
of Megistu Haile Mariam.
</P>
<P>
   Both nations were growing quickly economically, and their
leaders, Afwerki of Eritrea and Prime Minister Meles Zenawi of
Ethiopia, were both hailed by western nations as part of a new
breed of progressive leaders in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   But the two countries never marked their 620-mile border, and
after months of skirmishes, Eritrea moved troops into the Badme
region, claiming it was theirs according to colonial boundaries.
Ethiopia said it had been invaded.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, the war has been fought in fierce bursts, with both
nations, among the poorest in the world, spending what U.S.
officials said was $1 billion in weapons. Moreover, in a war of
modern weaponry between two large and well-trained armies, the
casualties have been stunningly high: Estimates run from 20,000
dead to perhaps triple that, from the fighting before May. The
Organization for African Unity said this week that thousands more
had died since.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   On May 12, Ethiopia launched an offensive, saying that the cost
of the war was in fact too high, especially because about 8 million
of its people are facing severe food shortages.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia has gained ground with a speed that surprised many
military experts, particularly because the Eritreans were fighting
the kind of defensive war that they excelled at in their 30-year
guerrilla battle against Mengistu and the Emperor Haile Selassie.
</P>
<P>
   Ethiopia has said publicly that its only goal was to regain the
territory that Eritrea occupied two years ago. But in private,
Ethiopian officials have made no secret of their desire to destroy
Eritrea's military and, if possible, bring down Afwerki's
government.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Ethiopia feels it has inflicted enough damage, many
experts said, may determine whether the war will end soon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The humiliation of Eritrea has long been an important part of
the Ethiopian plan,'' said one western military analyst in
Ethiopia, who spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   Another possible block to peace is the essential scrappiness of
Eritrea, a nation of only 3.5 million people compared to Ethiopia's
60 million. For 30 years, Eritrea held off the armies of Mengistu
and Haile Selassie, both of whom fought unsuccessfully to subdue
rebellions in Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   Eritrea continued Thursday to cast this war in a similar light,
saying that Zenawi's government wants to conquer Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   ``They will continue the war,'' Ghebremeskel, the Eritrean
spokesman, said. ``The international community will know that their
agenda is something else.''
</P>
<P>
   Taddesse denied that Ethiopia had any designs on land beyond the
border, saying it would withdraw from the land it has taken in the
west as soon as Eritrea pulled its troops from the roughly 20 areas
it claims as its own. So far, she said, she saw no evidence of
their withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can assure you 100 percent,'' she said. ``The minute we
regain our territory, we will stop.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last several months, Ethiopia and Eritrea had accepted
all but the fine print of a peace deal brokered by the Organization
for African Unity. A major sticking point was that Eritrea wanted a
cease-fire before settling those final details; Ethiopia wanted the
cease-fire afterward.
</P>
<P>
   After nearly two weeks of fighting, Eritrea said Thursday that
the cease-fire could come later.
</P>
<P>
   The paradox of this war, if it does indeed end soon, is that
land along the border may still shift hands _ no matter how many
lives have been spent in the last two years. During the past few
days, there has been speculation that Eritrea would concede defeat
before it was completely beaten on the battlefield in order to
preserve a key element of the Organization for African Unity's
peace plan: a process for determining the exact borders by the old
colonial treaties and handing over land, if need be.

   On Wednesday, the Organization for African Unity released a
document aimed at ending the war in which both sides agreed that
they were still committed to that process. Both sides repeated
Thursday that Ethiopia's latest gains should not change that.
''It's going to be a constant source of conflict if the border
isn't clearly defined and a perpetual reason for bloodshed between
the two countries,'' said Lea Brilmayer, a Yale law professor who
is a legal adviser to the Eritrean president's office.
</P>
<P>
   Taddesse agreed. ``The lasting solution to this problem,'' she
said, ``is going to be a demarcation of this border.''

   George W. Bush met today in Austin with Colin Powell, one of the
Republican Party's most popular and potent political figures, and
heard Powell reiterate that he is ``not a candidate for vice
president.'' And Bush seemed to be taking him at his word _ at
least for now. A day earlier, Bush said in an interview with the AP
that Powell was not on his list of vice presidential prospects for
that very reason.``People who don't want to be considered for vice
president are not going to be considered for vice president,'' Bush
said. He said the same goes for John McCain, Bush's vanquished
primary rival who says he doesn't want to play second fiddle at the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   MORE MONEY, LONGER HOURS
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore proposed a tax credit for after-school expenses today as
part of an initiative to help working families. In a speech in
Nashville, Gore also said he wants every school to stay open late
and for the government to ``dramatically'' increase funding for
school-based programs known as 21st Century Learning Centers. They
help communities provide after-school and summer school programs.
Gore said he would devote $115 billion of expected federal budget
surpluses to educational programs. George W. Bush, too, has been
promoting education initiatives in an effort that polls have shown
appeals to women.
</P>
<P>
   BATTLE OF THE BUCKS: BLUE JEANS VS. BLACK TIE
</P>
<P>
   It's more money than either the Democrats or the Republicans
have ever raised in one night. President Clinton and Al Gore headed
a ``blue jeans and barbecue'' fund-raiser in Washington that
brought in $26 million. The haul topped the $21 million George W.
Bush collected in a single event several weeks ago. The Democratic
event attracted more than 12,000 people who paid between $50 and
$500,000 to attend. But the competition was vividly on display just
a few blocks away. The Republicans' annual House-Senate dinner,
featuring ex-President George Bush, brought in $14 million. While
diners at the black-tie GOP dinner ate goat cheese and corn
souffle, the Democrats wore jeans and open-necked shirts and ate
their barbecue on plastic plates.
</P>
<P>
   DISTASTEFUL, BUT THEY'LL DO IT ANYWAY
</P>
<P>
   Even while breaking all fund-raising records and upping the ante
for contributions, President Clinton and Al Gore championed
overhauling campaign finance laws. ``I don't think it's corruption
to take money to pass the Brady Bill, to pass the family and
medical leave bill, to pass the patients' bill of rights, to reduce
the deficit and get rid of the debt, instead of giving big breaks
to special interests,'' Clinton said to a standing ovation at the
gala. Said Gore: ``If you entrust me with the presidency, we can
all come back here and it won't cost much at all. We're going to
make meaningful campaign finance reform the law of the land.''
</P>
<P>
   PARTY POW-WOW AND THE POLLS . . .
</P>
<P>
   Al Gore was talking today with Democratic leaders from 34 states
gathering that comes as his poll numbers remain weak and some party
officials are questioning the low-key campaign he has run since
sealing the Democratic nomination in early March. During a two-day
meeting in Nashville, the Democratic state chairmen and vice
chairmen were hearing from not only the candidate, but Donna
Brazille, his campaign manager, Joe Andrew, general chairman of the
Democratic National Committee, and other Gore staffers and
strategists.
</P>
<P>
   . . . BET HE KNOWS THE NUMBERS, THOUGH
</P>
<P>
   On a National Public Radio call-in show, Al Gore said he doesn't
pay much heed to the polls, and said he wouldn't change campaign
strategy to improve his numbers. ``I am not trying to have an
impact on the polls,'' Gore told interviewer Diane Rehm. ``I am
trying to get a message across to the people.'' When asked if he
was having difficulty in getting that message to voters: ``The
process of communication that takes place in a campaign is not best
analyzed on a daily or hourly basis.''
</P>
<P>
   BUSH'S STRATEGY GETS RAVE NOTICES . . .
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush has established a pattern with his campaign
that's being noted and lauded. The New York Times: ``He put forward
broad ideas with great appeal to the Republican base and then left
the details to be filled in later should he be elected.'' MSNBC:
``Bush has had a terrific spring in his first season in The Bigs.
Highly touted in the minors, roughed up last winter by John McCain,
Bush has methodically dominated the three-month stretch since Super
Tuesday ended the primary season last March. Al Gore, by contrast,
still seems to be fumbling at the bat rack.''
</P>
<P>
   . . . AND IT DOESN'T GO UNNOTICED BY DEMOCRATS
</P>
<P>
   Two important Democrats on Capitol Hill _ Rep. Charles Rangel
(N.Y.) and Sen. Robert Torricelli (N.J.) are worried that George W.
Bush has made better use of the post-primary season than has Al
Gore. Rangel: ``People are starting to ask, `When does he get
started? When does he get focused? How did Bush catch up? When does
the show hit the road?' They're saying, `If this is a policy to lay
back and wait for the debates, then share it with somebody!'
There's no fiery speeches being given; we don't have the surrogates
out there.'' Torricelli described the problem: ``Until Al Gore
actually goes to Los Angeles and receives his party's nomination
and campaigns in his own right, he will still be identified by most
Americans as Bill Clinton's vice president. There is still not a
separate identity, and only the dramatic departure from Los Angeles
is going to create this new identity.''
</P>
<P>
   GORE STILL THE SECOND BANANA
</P>
<P>
   At the Democrats' big party, the MCI Center emitted
rock-concert-like shrieks when President Clinton was introduced and
Tina Turner's pulsating hit, ``You're Simply the Best,'' blared
through the loud speakers. Unfortunately for Al Gore, this is the
song his campaign staff has been road testing as his theme song.
And it underscored a sad reality for him: As at some of the other
Clinton-Gore joint appearances in the past, while Gore is meant to
be the star, Clinton steals the show. ``Four more years!'' could be
heard coming from the crowd as the president spoke.
</P>
<P>
   CHARACTER OVER RELIGION
</P>
<P>
   George W. Bush declared in Detroit that education is ``the new
civil right.'' With Michigan's popular Republican governor, John
Engler, at his side, Bush spent more than an hour discussing the
importance of equal access to education with students, teachers,
parents and volunteers at the Cornerstone Schools, a private
religion-oriented group of middle and elementary schools. ``We
can't have any gaps of hope in the country,'' he said. ``The
American dream is available for everyone, which means every child
must be educated.'' He also said he believes character education
courses should be available in every school: ``Public schools
should not mix religion in the classroom, but we should not fear
teaching values that are embraced by all religions.''
</P>
<P>
   FORGET THE MODERATION
</P>
<P>
   Focus on the Family head James Dobson criticized the Republican
Party and George W. Bush for sacrificing dedication to its core
principles in an effort to be all things to all people. Dobson said
he was speaking as a private individual and not as the president of
the tax-exempt conservative Christian ministry he leads. He said he
doesn't believe that Bush, if elected, would immediately try to
outlaw abortion and that the Bush campaign has sent ``messages to
conservative Christians that have been kind of scary.'' Focus on
the Family produces radio and TV shows and written material to
forward its goals.
</P>
<P>
   THE FENCE-SITTERS CAN MOVE NOW
</P>
<P>
   Now that Rick Lazio has replaced Rudy Giuliani as the GOP Senate
candidate in New York, voters have a starker choice. Lazio doesn't
share Hillary Clinton's unequivocal support for abortion rights,
increased penalties for gay bias attacks, or gun licensing. The
National Abortion Rights Action League had refused to choose
between Giuliani and Clinton, and its director, Kelli Conlin,
attended events supporting both. But Lazio opposes what abortion
foes call partial-birth abortions. He also is against federal
funding for abortions for poor women. ``I do not want to
criminalize abortion,'' he said. ``On the other hand, I want to
make it rarer, and I don't think just because we have a right that
we need to subsidize that right.''
</P>
<P>
   THE ONCE AND FUTURE MARION BARRY
</P>
<P>
   Marion Barry, once the very popular, very visible and very
imprisoned mayor of Washington, is telling friends he may run
again, this time for a return to the city council. Though out of
office for 14 months, Barry still has a large political following
in the city. But should he run, he faces a couple of major
obstacles: Harold Brazil, the person who holds the council seat
Barry is eyeing has no intention of going quietly, and Anthony
Williams, the present mayor, said he'd support Barry in just about
anything except a return to city office.
</P>
<P>
   BIG SCORE FOR LAROUCHE
</P>
<P>
   Political extremist Lyndon LaRouche captured 22 percent of the
vote running against Al Gore in the Arkansas Democratic
presidential primary in Arkansas, but the party already has
declared LaRouche and his followers to be personae non gratae at
the national convention. Still, the LaRouche followers were
ecstatic. ``This is amazing. We're shocked,'' LaRouche spokeswoman
Angela Vullo was quoted as saying in the Arkansas Democrat-Gazette.
``We're totally excited. It is incredible that this would happen in
Clinton's state.''

court lawsuit in Dallas that pits one of the nation's largest

officials who have proposed disciplining one of the company's
medical directors, the unseen but powerful officials who make the
behind-the-scenes decisions to approve or deny patient treatments.

&HT;     GORDON SAYS NO SWEAT TO PLAN FOR DOUBLE RACING DATES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LEE SCHEIDE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ For all the naysayers questioning Robby Gordon's
second attempt to drive the 1,100 miles of the Indianapolis 500 and
the Coca-Cola 600 on Sunday, the Winston Cup regular has just one
word: Baja.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, 31, has driven the famed Baja 1000 race solo on several
occasions. That is a distance of 1,032 miles in 17-plus hours of
nonstop bumping, bouncing and sliding through the dusty Mexican
wilderness, with his truck sometimes reaching speeds of 140 mph on
the few paved roads along the route.
</P>
<P>
   So the Californian shrugs his shoulders when asked about this
weekend's attempt at the Indy 500 on Sunday morning, then the
Coca-Cola 600 at Lowe's Motor Speedway in Charlotte, N.C., that
evening.
</P>
<P>
   The last driver to complete such a double is Tony Stewart, who
ran ninth at Indianapolis last year then finished fourth in
Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing is harder than driving in Baja, nothing,'' Gordon
said. ``I love to race and I think that's the main reason that I'm
trying it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The time behind the wheel and the distance isn't a problem
because I don't sit right on top of the wheel like some guys; I'm a
more laid-back, relaxed driver. And I'm in pretty good shape, so
I'm feeling pretty confident about Sunday.''
</P>
<P>
   Confidence has never been a problem for Gordon, at any level of
his career. A champion motocross rider, he graduated to off-road
racing at 16 and won the first event he entered.
</P>
<P>
   Then, after success in the Mickey Thompson Stadium Off-Road
Championship series, Gordon caught the eye of Jack Roush and moved
to the pavement of the IMSA series, winning four consecutive 24
Hours of Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   Chip Ganassi then offered Gordon a seat in the CART series for
eight races in 1992, which turned into a full-time ride for A.J.
Foyt the next season. From Foyt's garage, Gordon moved to Derrick
Walker's team, and in 1995 and 1996 he finished fifth at the
Indianapolis 500. But the Indy 500 was the highlight of Gordon's
1996 season, and after it finished he announced that he was moving
over to NASCAR to drive for Felix Sabates.
</P>
<P>
   Thus came Gordon's first attempt at the double, when he put his
own team together for the Brickyard. Weather foiled that attempt,
as the 1997 Indy 500 was postponed by rain, allowing Gordon plenty
of time to fly to Charlotte.
</P>
<P>
   When he came back to Indy, finally getting in the car on the
following Tuesday, he had just passed Arie Luyendyk for the lead on
the restart when fumes in his cockpit caught on fire, causing burns
to Gordon's legs and hands.
</P>
<P>
   ``An 11-cent O-ring is what cost us that day,'' Gordon said.
``We researched it all the way back and found out that the O-rings
were wrong and that the manufacturer had put the wrong ones in the
bag.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a good car and I thought that we would have a chance at
winning the race. After that, my deal with Felix soured some and I
ended up looking for somewhere to race.''
</P>
<P>
   That was with Cal Wells back in CART. Gordon had driven for
Wells in the Mickey Thompson series and was happy to be back with
his mentor. Not happy enough, though, when the Toyota engine proved
to be very temperamental, relegating Gordon to mid-pack finishes.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, Wells gave Gordon a chance for a different kind
of double _ racing at St. Louis in the CART race on Saturday, then
flying to Indianapolis to run the 500 on Sunday. After qualifying
fourth for the 500, the plan was set in motion.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon's day ended early in St. Louis, however, as he crashed
out of the race. He more than made up for it on Sunday. Driving for
team owner John Menard, Gordon had the race in hand with less than
10 miles to go.
</P>
<P>
   What he didn't have, though, was enough fuel in his tank, having
to pit with less than two laps remaining and handing the victory to
Kenny Brack. Gordon finished fourth and with the impending move
back to Winston Cup for this season, figured his days of driving
the Indy 500 were over _ at least for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Until a month ago, when Menard decided to enter a second car at
the Brickyard. Since he is one of Gordon's partners in NASCAR,
Menard asked Gordon to drive and the double shift was on again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that Robby's got a great chance to win here at
Indianapolis,'' Menard said. ``We came very close last year and
he's been running very well during practice and in qualifying.
</P>
<P>
   ``And he's been doing a solid job in Winston Cup and that's a
big race, as well, on Sunday. Hopefully, he'll be successful here
and then continue that success in Charlotte.''

`KIKUJIRO': BUDDY STORY DEPARTURE FOR JAPANESE DIRECTOR FAILS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review.)  
 By A.O. SCOTT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Takeshi Kitano, the director of ``Kikujiro,'' has been widely
acclaimed for his violent, meditative yakuza (gangster) movies,
which explore the bloody deeds and uneasy consciences of members of
Japan's legendary criminal underworld, often played, with volcanic
charisma, by Kitano himself using the alias Beat Takeshi.
</P>
<P>
   While he's not explicitly a gangster, this film's grumpy,
profane title character is another sensitive thug, whose every
phrase and gesture jabs like a dirty thumb for the eye of the
decorous, repressed, middle-class society he inhabits.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Kikujiro,'' which was shown at last year's Cannes and
Toronto film festivals, is something of a departure for Kitano, if
not for his alter ego. It's a sentimental comedy about a troubled
child and his unlikely, reluctant adult protector, part of a
subgenre that goes back at least to Charlie Chaplin's ``Kid'' and
that includes ``Gloria'' (twice), ``Central Station'' and a dozen
cornball kiddie road pictures whose names have been mercifully
forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   While the film doesn't sink to the level of, say, ``Cop and a
Half,'' a 1993 Burt Reynolds turkey, ``Kikujiro'' offers little
besides its setting that is likely to seem unfamiliar to American
viewers. There are some arresting visual touches _ Kitano is a
painter as well as a filmmaker _ and a handful of loose, whimsical
scenes. But the movie's humor is dissipated by its slow pace and
static scenes, and its emotional payoff is assumed rather than
earned.
</P>
<P>
   Kikujiro, referred to throughout the film simply as ``Mister,''
is a middle-aged layabout whose wife, perhaps to get him out of her
way, entrusts him with the care of her friend's young grandson,
Masao (Yusuke Sekiguchi), a mopey, moon-faced 9-year-old who longs
to find the mother who abandoned him. Mister promises to take him
to the beach, but they end up at the bicycle track, where the boy's
failure to pick winners provokes his new guardian to sputtering
rage.
</P>
<P>
   Mister's ill temper is matched only by his staggering
incompetence. He's a lousy gambler, a worse car thief (he doesn't
know how to operate a stick shift) and a disastrous hitchhiker. He
tries to stop passing motorists by feigning blindness, and then by
laying nails in the middle of the road in the hope of puncturing
their tires. When he fails to trick people into doing what he
wants, he insults them, and when that doesn't work, he threatens
violence.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Mister develops a soft spot for his young charge, and
the two set off on a slow journey through the Japanese countryside
in search of Masao's mother. Along the way, they encounter a
collection of misfits and eccentrics, including a pair of sensitive
bikers that Mister christens Fatso and Baldy (Great Gidayu and
Rakkyo Ide) and an itinerant poet (Nezumi Mamura). With Mister in
the role of demented camp counselor, they devise impromptu
amusements ``for the kid's sake'': swinging from trees, parading
around in costumes and playing the Japanese version of Red Light,
Green Light.
</P>
<P>
   Though it generally moves with painful deliberateness,
``Kikujiro'' musters occasional touches of shambling, playful
charm. The story is seen through the child's eyes, interspersed
with his lurid, stagey dreams and divided into chapters whose
titles _ ``Mister Is Strange,'' ``The Scary Man'' _ reflect his
innocent, baffled perspective.
</P>
<P>
   These dreamy touches can't compensate for the film's main flaw,
which is that the relationship between the two main characters
never really develops, in spite of all the time they spend
together. The boy spends most of the time looking at the ground and
frowning, and Beat Takeshi never lets go of his shtick long enough
to let anyone else in.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're just like me, kid,'' he says at the end. But there's no
sense that the two have really gotten to know each other, or
changed each other, even though the presence of syrupy piano and
strings assures us that they must have.

<TEXT>
<P>
   I was still in grade school when I had my first ride in a
Chris-Craft Racing Runabout. It was mid-August 1959, and Barnegat
Bay in New Jersey was pure glass. Taking my cues from my father _ a
sailor and ice-boater _ I had disdained ``stinkpots,'' the sailor's
term for motorboats. But when a friend invited me for a spin on his
father's gleaming wooden motorboat, I hopped in.
</P>
<P>
   A deft captain, my friend's father smoothly maneuvered us out of
the slip, careful to make no wake. On the bay, he smiled as he
opened the throttle full. We roared into the night, the
acceleration jamming me back into the red vinyl cushions. The long
sleek bow with its racy caulk lines lifted high out of the water;
phosphorescent spray flamed by the low freeboard like galaxies of
stars. I was thrilled: this must be what astronauts felt, shooting
though space.
</P>
<P>
   It is just such early memories that have made the 19-foot
Chris-Craft Racing Runabout one of the most popular classic boats
in the United States, according to Wilson W. Wright, the executive
director of the Chris-Craft Antique Boat Club, which is based in
Tallahassee, Fla. From 1947 to July 1954, 503 were built. ``They
were the Corvettes, the Thunderbirds of their era,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Like their automotive counterparts, they can fetch high prices,
as much as $50,000 for a show-quality boat with original hardware
and motor. Boats in excellent condition but lacking what judges
term ``originality,'' because owners have added souped-up motors or
improved controls, are also popular. One, a 1953 Chris-Craft Racing
Runabout, is expected to fetch $25,000 to $35,000 at the New
Hampshire Antique and Classic Boat Auction on June 17 at Moody
Mountain Farm in Wolfeboro, N.H.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a basket case when I found it eight years ago,'' said
Gil Steward, who donated the boat for the auction to benefit the
New Hampshire Antique and Classic Boat Museum on Lake
Winnipesaukee.
</P>
<P>
   Restorers rebuilt the bottom and deck for Steward, a stockbroker
who also judges classic boat shows. He set to work rebuilding and
installing a small block Chevrolet 350 Ci-250 horsepower engine
with a Holley carburetor. ``I'm a hot rodder at heart,'' he said.
``I figure, conservatively, it will go 55 to 57 miles per hour.''
</P>
<P>
   Going fast is what these boats are all about. In the late 19th
century, Wright said, the first racing runabouts were custom-built
for gentlemen boaters on the St. Lawrence Seaway. By the 1920s,
several companies vied for the trade. Cigar-smoking Chris Smith,
the founder of Chris-Craft, took a lesson from Detroit and built
the first standardized runabout in 1922.
</P>
<P>
   ``Henry Ford wanted to put a car in every garage in America,''
Wright said. ``Chris Smith wanted to put a boat in every
boathouse.'' Unlike Gar Wood, which produced runabouts one at a
time, with the same crew working on every detail of the boat, Smith
broke down the assembly into teams. ``Think of the Model A,''
Wright said.
</P>
<P>
   After World War II Chris-Craft became the largest manufacturer
of wood motorboats. The 19-foot Racing Runabout was the speedster
of the line, painted red-and-white or blue-and-white. Some claim
that this was a patriotic gesture to attract returning GIs, but
most historians believe they were painted because of the materials
used _ fir and cedar rather than the mahogany so prized for
brightwork. In 1949, when wood from the Philippines was available
again, the company built the boats in varnished Chris-Craft-grade
mahogany (actually, a mahogany relative called luan).
</P>
<P>
   Races, sanctioned by the American Power Boat Association or
informal, were held on summer weekends across the country, from
Long Island Sound to Lake Tahoe. Jack Savage, author of
``Chris-Craft'' (MBI Publishing), said there was even a race down
the Colorado River. The contest was between a 19-foot Chris-Craft
Racing Runabout and a specially built racer _ an archetypal battle
between the common man and privileged class. The assembly-line
Chris-Craft won when the custom boat's water-cooled engine lost
power because of the sandy river water.
</P>
<P>
   By the mid-1950s Chris-Craft stopped producing the jazzy Racing
Runabout, shifting its emphasis to larger leisure crafts with open
cockpits, more suited to America's growing families. A final blow
came when fiberglass took over the industry. By the 1970s the wood
Racing Runabouts were considered passe.
</P>
<P>
   Smaller and easier to store, most racers did not meet the fate
of many larger woodies, left to rot in some marsh or hauled to a
garbage dump and burned. Instead, they were stored in boathouses,
pulled out of the water on pulleys.
</P>
<P>
   Today, many of the antique Racing Runabouts can be found on or
near northern lakes, precisely because of those boathouses (sun is
hard on wood) and because in colder climes boats were seldom used
more than 40 hours a summer. (Freshwater is not a factor: while
easier than saltwater on engines and chrome, it is harder on wood
because of dry rot.)
</P>
<P>
   Anyone can learn the age of a Chris-Craft boat by giving the
Mariners' Museum in Newport News, Va., its hull number, from a
brass tag on the engine hatch. Chris-Craft kept meticulous records
and in 1985 donated its archives _ 55,000 plans, 25,000 photographs
and 105,000 hull cards _ to the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was one hull card for each boat built from 1922 to 1980,
a little bit like a birth certificate,'' explained Jerry Conrad,
archivist for the museum. The hull card details when the boat was
built, the specifications, and to what town and dealer it was
shipped. The museum receives 1,200 to 1,500 requests a year.
</P>
<P>
   Owners of the classic racing runabouts no longer race as a
formal class _ Wright, a lawyer, ruefully talks of liability and
insurance _ but they attend vintage boat shows. The big ones
include the season opener in Mount Dora, Fla., in March; in Wiers
on Lake Winnipesaukee on July 29; and in Clayton, N.Y, and Tahoe,
Calif., in August.
</P>
<P>
   If two or three Chris-Craft racers should meet on the water?
Well, says Wright, maybe there will be an informal test of speed:
``It's a basic instinct.''
</P>
<P>
   George Johnson, who has been selling, riding and racing boats on
the Eastern seaboard for over half a century, estimates there are
probably 200 Chris-Craft Racing Runabouts in various conditions on
the lakes, bays and rivers of the country. Two companies _ Vintage
Marine in Mattituck, N.Y., and Golden Era Classics, outside Sydney,
Australia _ build replicas of the Chris-Craft Racing Runabout, for
those who do not want to go through the lengthy process of finding
and restoring an original.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, 75 and living on Lake Winnipesaukee, has sold his two
antique Racing Runabouts and ordered two reproductions for himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're nicer, stronger, faster, lighter,'' he said, adding
that what he really likes to do is take an evening spin, when the
water is still and the breeze is down, and the deep reverberating
sound of the motor echoes off the wooded hills.

 &HT;    A MICROSOFT TRIAL THAT NEVER WAS
 &HT;    Moving in (w) Washington and (f) financial categories.
 &HT;    By ANDREW J. GLASS
 &HT;    c.2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A Microsoft legal document released at the close of
Wednesday's climactic judicial hearing revealed how the software
giant had hoped to soften the blow of being branded an abusive
monopoly.
</P>
<P>
   With the government pressing to cleave the software giant in
two, a beset Microsoft pleaded with U.S. District Court Judge
Thomas Penfield Jackson to try the case again _ this time over how
to remedy its antitrust offenses.
</P>
<P>
   When Jackson said that he was prepared, after two years, to
close the case, the company's lawyers gave him a star-studded list
of defense witnesses. The ``offer of proof'' serves as a road map
of further courtroom testimony.
</P>
<P>
   According to that document, if seated in the witness chair,
Microsoft chairman Bill Gates and chief executive Steve Ballmer
would testify how the world's most valued software company would be
ruined if Jackson approved the government's far-reaching break-up
plan and curbs in the company's future conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Gates did not take the stand during the 78-trial. He appeared
instead on videotapes that the prosecutors used repeatedly to draw
sharp contradictions to the damaging e-mail he wrote in supposed
confidence to key corporate figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bill Gates' poor preparation for his deposition proved to be a
cardinal error because the government put him as much on trial as
the company itself,'' C. Boyden Gray, a Microsoft legal consultant
and a former White House counsel, said recently in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Had Microsoft put Gates at the witness stand, his deposition
could not have been shown in the courtroom, let alone played on
television.
</P>
<P>
   According to the document, Gates was prepared to testify about a
new computing platform that ``will provide system services to
software developers.'' That platform, he would say, ``enables them
to produce Web-based applications accessible from a wide-range of
devices, creating whole new ways for consumers to benefit from the
global network that is the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   That business plan, to be formally announced June 1, ``will cost
Microsoft billions of dollars to develop and is an extremely risky
venture with no assurance of success,'' as Gates' planned testimony
would have had it.
</P>
<P>
   But Gates would also have been cross-examined by David Boies,
the lead prosecutor for the Justice Department, who had sparred
with him during the 1998 deposition.
</P>
<P>
   Boies, for example, could have questioned Gates about his
decision last March to resign from the board of the Software and
Information Industry Association and to pull Microsoft out of the
trade group after it had written a friend-of-the-court brief to
Jackson critical of Microsoft's conduct during the liability phase
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   During the hearing, Jackson praised a subsequent brief from the
group that said: ``Those events shed a strong light on the remedy
issue now before this court.'' The brief added:
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft's power and wealth gave it the ability to both
punish its critics and retain battalions of lawyers, lobbyists and
publicists to undermine the government at every turn.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson made it clear on Wednesday that he wanted no part of a
second trial over remedies, even in a more condensed form than the
six-month preparation processes which Microsoft had sought.
</P>
<P>
   His surprise decision stunned the defense because in four
separate private conferences with Jackson the lawyers were led to
expect that they were entitled to a full hearing if drastic
remedies were put on the table. Even Boies said he expected an
extended procedure to be followed.
</P>
<P>
   For Jackson, however, that would be a trial too far.
</P>
<P>
   The judge is now all but ready to rule on Microsoft's fate,
filing a judgment that will almost surely split the company into
two or three parts. He has shown himself willing to risk that the
appeals court will not reverse a breakup ruling, which he will stay
pending the outcome of the appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft says it would have appealed no matter what. But now it
says its appeal will also stress Jackson's unwillingness to give
Gates his day in court.

 COM28-COX &HT;    Grads' stop before European rail junket: GORP
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, May 28.

 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   All aboard, graduates. A leading online adventure travel guide
has your ticket to a post-academic rite of passage: exploring
Europe by train.
</P>
<P>
   This month, the Great Outdoor Recreation Pages (GORP.com)
launched ``Eurailing: A Great American Tradition.'' A
nuts-and-bolts primer on Europe's rail pass system, it is aimed at
the scores of graduating high school and college students who are
right about now throwing off their caps and gowns and strapping on
backpacks for a summer of Old World wandering.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the economy doing so well, more young people are
traveling the world,'' says GORP editor in chief Bill Greer, who
founded the site in 1995 with his wife, Diane. ``We thought we'd
take a look at one of the classic adventures.''
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the site can read a brief history of the pass
system, introduced in 1959, before accessing handy sections on
which of 16 different passes to buy.
</P>
<P>
   All-summer bums looking for a leisurely chug around the
continent will want to spring for the ``unlimited'' Eurail Pass,
good for three months of travel in 17 countries from Spain to
Finland. Travelers with less time or money may opt for the cheaper
Europass, which covers travel in France, Germany, Italy, Spain and
Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Young rail-hoppers _ and travelers of any age on a budget _ will
click with the ``do's and don'ts'' and ``tricks'' sections, which
offer tips on how to squeeze the most value from your rail pass.
Thinking of training around Spain? Don't buy a ``single country
pass'' there _ GORP says Spanish Railways has jacked up the price
to get the most out of unsuspecting tourists.
</P>
<P>
   GORP is introducing two other adventure features this summer:
The Thru-Hiker series will offer dispatches from six hikers on the
Pacific Crest Trail, the Continental Divide and the Appalachian
Trail. And on June 18, GORP will sponsor cyclists in a
cross-country ride to benefit the American Lung Association and
offer a forum for site visitors to ask the riders questions and
post personal anecdotes.
</P>
<P>
   Though GORP has an online booking service for adventure
excursions, from trekking in Nepal to sea kayaking in Patagonia,
you can't secure Eurail passes through the site. To purchase a pass
or to find out about rates and schedules, call Rail Europe at
1-877-456-7245 or visit www.raileurope.com.

   Can I get that diploma . . . to go?
</P>
<P>
   With commencement addresses still echoing in the air, America's
high school and college graduates are faced with one of the
greatest issues of their young lives _ where to venture for the
traditional post-matriculation vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Will it be rafting in Nepal or ralphing on Bourbon Street?
Whatever the destination, more and more young travelers are turning
to the Web to help them get there. And savvy sites are responding
with travel advice geared toward Generations X, Y and Z. With its
newly launched primer on Eurail passes, the eco-adventure site
Gorp.com is one of many Internet travel guides aiming to attract
the school's-out crowd. Among the others:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  STA Travel (www.statravel.com). ``This ain't your parent's
travel agency'' declares this sassy site, dedicated to student
travelers. STA offers advice on how to get a passport and book
budget accommodations, as well as information on airline and rail
pass deals. Visitors can book discounted airline tickets and, in
the ``Show and Tell'' chat room, share experiences with other young
globetrotters.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Council Travel (www.counciltravel.com). Billed as ``America's
student travel leader,'' this site posts listings of international
hostels (provided you purchase a $25 ``hostel membership'' card).
There's also a handy quick-search for round-trip student air fares.
Interested in continuing your education? Check out sections on
language courses, volunteering and study/work abroad programs.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Contiki (www.contiki.com). Online arm of the popular tour
operator that caters to travelers 18 to 35 with group excursions in
Europe, Africa, Australia, Canada and the U.S. New tours include a
12-day ``Taste of Tuscany'' tour, with stops in Siena, Florence,
Pisa and other Italian towns; and a 13-day ``Mediterranean
Highlights'' trip that visits Spain, France, Italy and Monaco.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  TrekAmerica (www.trekamerica.com). Tour operator's summer
program organizes group adventures in North America for 18 to
38-year-olds. Activities include whale watching off the Pacific Rim
National Park in British Columbia, exploring Mayan culture in the
Yucatan and rafting the Snake River in Wyoming.

 &HT;    A style chat with designer Cynthia Rowley
 &HT;    Eds: Embargoed for Sunday, May 28.
 &HT;    By A. Scott Walton
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since she has ``no money for advertising,'' designer
Cynthia Rowley does whatever she can to be noticed. She took
someone's ``bad advice'' and appeared in a deodorant commercial.
She does free promos for E!'s new cable fashion channel and
co-wrote a rather flippant lifestyle book called ``Swell.'' She
even spent the recent eve of her daughter Kitt's first birthday in
Atlanta _ signing the book and appearing at Bauder College's annual
senior design competition.
</P>
<P>
   In a chat with fashion editor A. Scott Walton, Rowley came
across as someone who maintains her sense of humor while enduring
the necessary evils of seeking fame in her field. Q: What's your
stance on e-commerce and Web sites?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``I'm working on one that would have really crazy things; not
clothes necessarily, but, like, my inventions. (For instance) the
Baby Mop, which is like, a little suit and gloves they could crawl
all over the floor in. And the Hands Free Baby Feeder, which is
based on the beer can hats. And the toothbrush for lovers, which is
really just a pink toothbrush and a blue one superglued together,
but we don't have to tell people that, do we?
</P>
<P>
   Q: More and more, designing for lifestyles is what it's all
about, right?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yeah, I wanna do, like, scooters and, like, tools for girls.
Wouldn't that be cute? Pink tools? Maybe I shouldn't be letting the
cat out of the bag. ...
</P>
<P>
   Q: What do you wear when you don't know what to wear?
</P>
<P>
   A: My leather pants. Everybody calls me Jim Morrison because I
wear them all the time. I can dress 'em up or dress 'em down,
whatever. And really sexy shoes, because no matter what you wear
with them you usually look good and feel good, too.'' Q: What are
``Swell'' qualities in a guy?
</P>
<P>
   A: Let's see ... a sense of humor ... smart ... old-fashioned,
in a way ... and I guess a really cute butt.
</P>
<P>
   Rowley's designs are sold at Peke and Saks Fifth Avenue.

 &HT;    Starting today, white's all right
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rules are meant to be broken. Especially when it comes to
fashion.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how old, bold or stylish we get, many of the dress
codes we were taught growing up _ like not wearing white pants,
suits or accessories before Memorial Day or after Labor Day _
remain etched in the back of our minds. Whether we follow them is a
matter of personal style.
</P>
<P>
   Take Porsche Foxx, an on-air personality at V-103/FM, for
example.
</P>
<P>
   She was eager to wear a pair of white pants to work a couple of
weeks ago, but didn't have the nerve to break the Memorial Day
rule.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a definite no-no,'' said Foxx, who joked about it on
air. ``I'd hate to walk out and have somebody talk about me.''
</P>
<P>
   But when it comes to sandals, Foxx ignores the old rule about
not wearing them before summer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been known to wear sandals most of the winter,'' she
says. ``I love my feet out.''
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of feet. ... The old rules say to keep them covered in
the workplace with closed-toe shoes. Sandals aren't businesslike.
And mules belong in the bedroom, not the boardroom.
</P>
<P>
   But that was then.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, sandals are being worn with business suits. We've
gotten a lot more daring with what we show and what we don't,''
says Mary Justman, director of fashion and modeling at Bauder
College in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   What about legs? A woman was supposed to wear stockings
year-round at work, regardless of how hot it was outside. Bare legs
were only acceptable in casual settings, such as the beach.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's gone with the wind,'' says Georgia Lee,
southeast editor of Women's Wear Daily, the industry trade paper.
``Shoes have changed the whole approach to legwear. Hose looks
stupid with some of them. Bare legs have become a lot more
acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Amy Helton, public relations manager at Neiman Marcus,
believes nylons are still de rigueur in business and formal
settings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hosiery is so important,'' she says. ``It evens out your skin
tone and covers up scars and scratches, and it just looks a lot
neater.''
</P>
<P>
   Fashion designers are doing their part to revise old dress codes
with the styles they create. Leather and suede, traditionally worn
from October to April, appeared on the runways in hot miniskirts
and halter tops. Bright spring colors were shown for fall. Snow
white garments were as popular for winter as spring and summer. And
lightweight fabrics were paired with heavier textures.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've become so advanced in the technology of our fabrics that
there's so many that can be worn year-round. We didn't have that
before,'' says Kevin Knaus, consultant and creative director for
Material World, a fabric trade show in Atlanta. ``Designers have
changed a lot of the rules. But the one rule that seems to really
stick in people's minds is not wearing white shoes before Easter.''
</P>
<P>
   Just for the record, here are some more ``old rules'' of summer.
Let your style conscious be your guide:
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Wear patent-leather shoes only after Memorial Day, or Easter
if you live in a warm climate.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  No white clothes, shoes or gloves after Labor Day. Ditto for
straw hats and sandals.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Never wear nude stockings with white shoes.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't wear black or dark colors after Memorial Day.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Never wear pastels after Labor Day, except on cruises.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't wear sleeveless tops or dresses to work.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Match shoes, belt and handbag all year round.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Don't wear white or black to a wedding.
</P>

 &HT;    Mini reviews of current movies
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie, Steve Murray and Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Grades range from A to F.
</P>
<P>
   ``28 Days'' PG-13 (profanity, substance
</P>
<P>
   abuse and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandra Bullock
</P>
<P>
   and Viggo Mortensen.
</P>
<P>
   The cinema's chipper girl next door (Sandra Bullock) goes clean
and sober in an addiction and rehab movie that, thankfully, isn't
an appalling clinical ``comedy'' like ``Patch Adams.'' It's a
professional, appealing comedy-drama, but in trying to be all
things to all viewers (to beer-loving Bullock fans as well as
devoted 12-steppers), it never really comes into focus. (SM)1 hour,
43 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Across the Sea of Time'' G
</P>
<P>
   3-D Imax film
</P>
<P>
   about New York City.
</P>
<P>
   History comes alive visually in this 3-D Imax movie focusing on
New York City. It's full of big, gloriously detailed ``stereoview''
photographs depicting immigrant life at the turn of the century.
(Bob Longino) 51 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Battlefield Earth'' PG-13 (intense sci-fi action)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Travolta.
</P>
<P>
   Teens likely will be unable to stay awake, let alone make any
sense out of ``Battlefield Earth,'' a flat-footed sci-fi epic.
Boring, murky and full of unintentionally funny lines, this pet
project of star John Travolta is based on the 1982 novel by L. Ron
Hubbard, founder of the Church of Scientology, to which Travolta
belongs. (Jane Horwitz, Washington Post)
</P>
<P>
   1 hour, 57 minutes. D
</P>
<P>
   ``The Big Kahuna'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kevin Spacey,
</P>
<P>
   Danny DeVito and Bob Facinelli.
</P>
<P>
   This three-hander is well worth your time for the terrific
acting. Three salesmen _ a corrosive cynic, (Kevin Spacey), a
resigned old-timer (Danny DeVito) and an eager-beaver newcomer (Bob
Facinelli) _ wait in their version of hell, i.e., a hospitality
suite in Wichita, for the chance to land that one all-important
client. Spacey and DeVito's performances are bracing and brainy.
(ERG)1 hour, 31 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Center Stage'' PG-13 (sexuality and language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ethan Stiefel,
</P>
<P>
   Amanda Schull and Zoe Saldana.
</P>
<P>
   An old-fashioned show biz fantasy for teenagers with leotards
and plies, ``Center Stage'' is a kind of movie that gets retooled
every 10 years or so. Its antecedents include ``Fame,'' ``Dirty
Dancing,'' ``The Turning Point'' and even ``Flashdance.'' It's the
female version of a sports movie: Sweat and inspiration lead to
love and brief heartache, but ultimately growth, self-worth and
even stardom result. (SM)1 hour, 53 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Dinosaur'' PG (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring the voices of D.B. Sweeney,
</P>
<P>
   Della Reese and Julianna Margulies.
</P>
<P>
   Leapin' lizards! The prehistoric critters in Disney's
years-in-the-making, $200 million-plus computer animation do more
than leap. Alas, the plot is worth about two cents _ something
about an Iguanodon raised by lemurs who helps a herd of dinosaurs
find a fabled nesting ground after a disastrous meteor shower.
Parents be aware: While most of the movie is Barney-tame, the scary
parts are quite scary. (ERG)1 hour, 24 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``East Is East'' R (profanity
</P>
<P>
   and domestic violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Om Puri
</P>
<P>
   and Linda Bassett.
</P>
<P>
   Set in working-class Britain in 1971, this uneven but energetic
film focuses on a boisterous Anglo-Pakistani family. The father is
a tyrannical type, while the mother is a grounded fish-and-chips
Englishwoman. And the kids are totally caught up in the exploding
England Swings pop-culture surrounding them. The very good cast,
headed by Om Puri and Linda Bassett, is a huge asset. (ERG) 1 hour,
36 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``East-West'' R (violence, brief sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   In French and Russian with subtitles
</P>
<P>
   Starring Sandrine Bonnaire
</P>
<P>
   and Oleg Menchikov.
</P>
<P>
   An uneven Iron Curtain epic, it's French director Regis
Wargnier's film about Russian emigees returning to their former
motherland after World War II, invited warmly by Stalin himself,
only to be met by guns and deceit. Wargnier builds an oppressively
claustrophobic atmosphere and constructs several suspenseful
sequences. But like his Oscar-winning ``Indochine,'' the movie
feels overblown and undernourished. (SM)2 hours, 1 minute. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Erin Brockovich'' R (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Julia Roberts
</P>
<P>
   and Albert Finney.
</P>
<P>
   Julia Roberts delivers in a funny, down-to-earth film about an
everyday mom with business spunk who, without a law degree but with
a lot of pluck, helps crash a big-time company responsible for
devastating health problems in a small, dirt-poor town. Call it
``Working-Class Girl.'' (Bob Longino) 2 hours, 11 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' R (bloody violence and raw language)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Devon Sawa,
</P>
<P>
   Ali Larter and Kerr Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``Final Destination'' aims for young audiences with an
``X-Files/The Wonder Years'' science/suspense plot about a kid who
escaped death from a plane crash and learns more than mortals
should about death. Our hero (Devon Sawa) and six others find
they're still targeted for death. The Grim Reaper, feeling cheated,
has plans for them. (Chris Hewitt, Knight Ridder Newspapers) 1
hour, 33 minutes. D+
</P>
<P>
   ``The Flintstones
</P>
<P>
   in Viva Rock Vegas'' PG (brief profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Mark Addy
</P>
<P>
   and Stephen Baldwin.
</P>
<P>
   Yabba-dabba-don't. A new, needless, live-action ``Flintstones,''
with Mark Addy as Fred, Stephen Baldwin as Barney, and the
courtship of Wilma and Betty as the plot. Inoffensive and mildly
amusing in spots, but hardly worth a trip to the theater. (Stephen
Whitty, Newhouse News Service) 1 hour, 29 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Frequency'' PG-13 (violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Dennis Quaid
</P>
<P>
   and Jim Caviezel.
</P>
<P>
   John Sullivan (Jim Caviezel) hears dead people. Specifically, he
hooks up to his dad's old ham radio set in 1999 and finds himself
talking to his dad (Dennis Quaid) in 1969. More crucially, John
knows his dad, a fireman, will be killed in a failed heroic rescue
the next day. Although over-plotted, the sentimental film has that
``what if?'' fascination. It's also a mind-bender and especially
savvy about emotional button-pushing. (ERG) 2 hours. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Gladiator'' R (extreme violence,
</P>
<P>
   perverse sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Russell Crowe.
</P>
<P>
   Two thousand _ or, if you want to add computer effects, 200,000
_ thumbs up for Ridley Scott's spectacle starring Russell Crowe as
a Roman general, who returns to the Colosseum to take revenge on
the odious Emperor Commodus (Joaquin Phoenix). The battles staged
before the mob of mindless ancient Romans are the film's
centerpieces, but its brave heart (so to speak) is Crowe. (ERG)2
hours, 33 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Held Up'' PG-13 (profanity, violence, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jamie Foxx
</P>
<P>
   and Nia Long.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Foxx is likable and funny as a Chicago businessman trapped
in a rural gas station who gets caught in the crossfire of would-be
bandits and the local sheriff and his posse of redneck deputies.
It's an amiable cross-cultural comedy bogged down mid-way through
the film by a big lull and a few static moments. (Kevin Thomas, Los
Angeles Times)1 hour, 31 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``High Fidelity'' R (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring John Cusack,
</P>
<P>
   Iben Hjejle and Jack Black.
</P>
<P>
   Freshly dumped by his longtime girlfriend, record-store owner
Rob (John Cusack) rhetorically asks himself, ``What came first _
music or the misery?'' In other words, does he listen to songs
about heartbreak because he's miserable, or is he miserable because
he's listening to these songs? ``High Fidelity'' is as smart as it
is enjoyable. It's a great date movie about dating. (SM)1 hour, 54
minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``I Dreamed of Africa'' PG-13 (nudity, sensuality
</P>
<P>
   and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kim Basinger
</P>
<P>
   and Vincent Perez.
</P>
<P>
   Cardboard figures have adventures in Africa. Oscar winner Kim
Basinger stars as real-life woman Kuki Gallmann, who up and moves
her family from Italy to the Dark Continent because, as she tells
her son, ``I've stopped growing.'' Directed by one-hit wonder Hugh
Hudson (``Chariots of Fire''), the movie never slows down long
enough to get inside the heads of its characters. (SM)1 hour, 54
minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Keeping the Faith'' PG-13 (profanity, sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Ben Stiller,
</P>
<P>
   Edward Norton and Jenna Elfman.
</P>
<P>
   At its best, it's a sweet-natured hymn to love and longtime
friendship. Edward Norton (as a priest) and Ben Stiller (as a
rabbi) are pals whose childhood friend (Jenna Elfman) returns to
catch both their eyes in more than a friendly way. The first 90
minutes have charm, a sophisticated sexiness and some nice, offbeat
bits. Then things start to crash. (SM) 2 hours, 9 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Love and Basketball'' PG-13 (profanity and sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Omar Epps
</P>
<P>
   and Sanaa Lathan.
</P>
<P>
   All's not fair in love or basketball is one of several themes in
this flawed but appealing romance. Q (Omar Epps) and Monica (Sanaa
Lathan) meet as kids and rival basketball players. They realize
throughout the film that they love each other as much as the game.
Director Gina Price-Bythewood (her producer is Spike Lee) may not
have scored a slam dunk, but she comes close thanks to her engaging
stars. (ERG) 1 hour, 58 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``Michael Jordan to the Max'' Unrated
</P>
<P>
   Imax documentary
</P>
<P>
   about Michael Jordan.
</P>
<P>
   It shoots; it scores. Like Mount Everest, Michael Jordan has his
own 2-D Imax film. It's the biggest format for the biggest sports
story ever told. Part bio, part well-deserved pat on the back, it's
a loving look at the Chicago Bulls superstar and hones in on the
1998 NBA playoffs when a determined Jordan led his team to a sixth
championship before retirement. (Bob Longino)45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Mission: Impossible 2'' PG-13 (intense sequences of violent
</P>
<P>
   action and some sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Cruise
</P>
<P>
   and Thandie Newton.
</P>
<P>
   This underscripted sequel, directed by John Woo, is a
full-fledged Tom Cruise star vehicle as he battles baddies after an
Ebola-like virus. The movie contains overamplified kung-fu fights
and a very long motorcycle chase consisting of quick, tight shots.
The sexy Thandie Newton holds her own in the film's first half, but
gets demoted to playing The Girl for the last act. She deserves
better. So do we. (SM)2 hours, 6 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``The Old Man and the Sea'' Unrated.
</P>
<P>
   A live-action animated short.
</P>
<P>
   This 'toon, based on an Ernest Hemingway novel, is, like the
author's word choice, deceptively simple and strikingly beautiful.
It's everything a moviegoer would expect, but didn't get, from
``Fantasia/2000.'' (Bob Longino)22 minutes. A-
</P>
<P>
   ``Passion of Mind'' PG-13 (sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Demi Moore.
</P>
<P>
   Demi Moore plays a woman who lives two existences
simultaneously. In one, she's a widowed mother in Provence. In the
other, she's an unattached high-powered agent in Manhattan. The
psychological overtones are intriguing and the denouement has a
genuine emotional kick. Director Alain Berliner (``Ma Vie en
Rose'') knows how to handle a dicey material, but ``Passion's''
problem is that it isn't dicey enough. (ERG)1 hour, 45 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Return to Me'' PG (mild violence and sexual situations)
</P>
<P>
   Starring David Duchovny
</P>
<P>
   and Minnie Driver.
</P>
<P>
   In what may be Hollywood's first organ-transplant romance,
bereaved widower David Duchovny falls for shy heart-transplant
recipient Minnie Driver, unaware that his beloved first wife's
ticker is beating inside her chest. Duchovny is actually rather
wonderful here, with a sweet pensive romanticism. But Driver
herself just doesn't seem worthy of Duchovny. (ERG) 1 hour, 56
minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Road Trip'' R (sexuality, crude humor,
</P>
<P>
   profanity and drug use)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tom Green.
</P>
<P>
   Produced by Ivan Reitman (``Animal House,'' ``Ghostbusters''),
``Road Trip'' is about a quartet of guys who try to retrieve a
missent sex video. The trip has its share of gross-outs _ from
making fun of large women to doing something completely disgusting
with French toast. It's a witless, dumb and dumber version of
``Animal House,'' and its saving grace, MTV genius Tom Green, isn't
in it enough. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 31 minutes. C
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules of Engagement'' R (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tommy Lee Jones
</P>
<P>
   and Samuel L. Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Rules of Engagement'' is another military flick that climaxes
in a courtroom, where soldiers shout out conflicting reports of
what really happened in the heat of battle. ``Rules'' is laughable,
but it's watchable thanks to the leads. Tommy Lee Jones is the
flick's anchor. And Samuel L. Jackson delivers an on-the-stand
blow-up like Jack Nicholson's ``You-can't-handle-the-truth''
bluster from ``A Few Good Men.'' (SM)2 hours, 7 minutes. C-
</P>
<P>
   ``Screwed'' PG-13 (profanity, nudity and drug content)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Norm Macdonald,
</P>
<P>
   Dave Chappelle and Danny DeVito.
</P>
<P>
   A gross-out comedy with Norm Macdonald as an underappreciated
chauffeur who plots revenge against his boss by kidnapping her dog.
The word ``crass'' does not begin to describe this laughless black
comedy. This film sat on the shelf for more than a year. The
question is : why release it at all? (John Hartl, Seattle Times)1
hour, 30 minutes. F
</P>
<P>
   ``Shanghai Noon'' PG-13 (action violence, some
</P>
<P>
   drug humor, profanity and sensuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Jackie Chan
</P>
<P>
   and Owen Wilson.
</P>
<P>
   Martial arts wiz Jackie Chan plays a Chinese imperial guardsman
who volunteers to head to the U.S. to rescue a kidnapped princess.
``Noon'' lets Chan use moose antlers, horse shoes and pine saplings
as weapons, take a big fall from a mission bell tower, and contend
with a drunken horse. The film lassos up all the revisionist laughs
and action scenes that last summer's ``Wild Wild West'' botched.
(SM)1 hour, 45 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``The Skulls'' PG-13 (violence and brief sexuality)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Joshua Jackson
</P>
<P>
   and Paul Walker.
</P>
<P>
   In this conspiracy thriller for the Clearasil set, the WB's
Joshua Jackson plays an average Joe sucked into an elite, monied
club. It comes with a price, though. Like he can't ever get out.
(SM)1 hour, 47 minutes. C+
</P>
<P>
   ``Small Time Crooks'' PG (profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Tracey Ullman, Woody Allen,
</P>
<P>
   Elaine May and Hugh Grant.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen remembers how to make us laugh in this comedy about
lightweight crooks who bumble into lots of cash. As Allen's
big-haired blond wife, Frenchy, Tracey Ullman is a pitch-perfect
character who can ground even her silliest role in genuine feeling.
Elaine May, who steals every scene she's in, plays Frenchy's cousin
May, easily the dimmest creature in a movie loaded with low-watt
bulbs. (SM)1 hour, 35 minutes. B
</P>
<P>
   ``Time Code'' R (drug use, sexuality,
</P>
<P>
   language and some violence)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Stellan Skarsgard,
</P>
<P>
   Salma Hayek and Jeanne Tripplehorn.
</P>
<P>
   The medium is the message in Mike Figgis' sometimes terrific,
sometimes tedious experiment in digital filmmaking. Here's the
gimmick: The screen is divided into four parts showing simultaneous
action in real time involving a large cast of characters. The
film's technique and technology are fresh. The story isn't. The
plot devices are moldy: A jealous lover. An estranged wife. A lying
sexpot. A loaded gun. (SM) 1 hour, 37 minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``U-571'' PG-13 (violence and profanity)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Matthew McConaughey,
</P>
<P>
   Harvey Keitel, Bill Paxton
</P>
<P>
   and Jon Bon Jovi.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew McConaughey leads a reconnaissance mission to take over
a damaged German sub and capture the secret Nazi coding device
that's confounding U.S. efforts to win the war. Despite a
predictable script, blatant cliches and a penchant for
chest-beating fanfare music, ``U-571'' has plenty of furious
action, occasional suspense and lots of super-loud booms. It's no
``Das Boot,'' but it can suck you in. (Bob Longino)1 hour, 56
minutes. B-
</P>
<P>
   ``The Virgin Suicides'' R (strong thematic
</P>
<P>
   elements involving teenagers)
</P>
<P>
   Starring Kirsten Dunst
</P>
<P>
   and Josh Hartnett.
</P>
<P>
   This shimmery, darkly comic adaptation of Jeffrey Eumenides
novel about five teen girls and the boys who obsess over them marks
the assured, often inspired feature debut from writer-director
Sofia Coppola. (Yes, that Sofia, who was unwisely cast by dad
Francis in his ``Godfather III.'') She takes a dreamy,
cinematically difficult book and creates a visually hypnotic movie.
(SM) 1 hour, 36 minutes. B+
</P>
<P>
   ``Where the Heart Is'' PG-13
</P>
<P>
   Starring Natalie Portman
</P>
<P>
   and Ashley Judd.
</P>
<P>
   A corn pone comedy-drama about a single mom, made with enough
polish to be a guilty pleasure. Natalie Portman plays the pregnant
teen who heads for California and winds up becoming the Wal-Mart
Mom in Oklahoma. She gets good support from Stockard Channing,
Ashley Judd and Sally Field. (SM)2 hours.

 &HT;    `Mission' victim of lame plot, effects glut
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Mission: Impossible 2'' is even less a big-screen expansion of
the beloved TV series than the first film was. It's not about
teamwork, but a showcase for Tom Cruise _ a star franchise that
tries to distract us from its lame plot with explosions and noisy,
incoherent chase scenes. Think of it as ``Die Hard'' with
salon-perfect hair. (Cruise's stylist deserves above-the-title
billing.)
</P>
<P>
   ``M:I2'' starts well, introducing IMF turncoat Sean Ambrose
(Dougray Scott), who plans to use a biologically engineered,
Ebola-like virus to ransom the world. Ethan Hunt (Cruise), first
seen dangling by his fingertips from a cliff wall (a sharp,
dizzying sequence), is summoned by his superior (Anthony Hopkins,
in a cameo) to foil Ambrose's plans.
</P>
<P>
   The key to this is professional thief Nyah Hall (Thandie
Newton), the best Bond girl Agent 007 never met. Hunt and Hall meet
cute during her latest jewel theft, and they're soon enjoying a
memorable brand of foreplay _ racing their convertibles along
whiplash mountain roads, sideswiping each other inches away from
sheer drops. Then, sex.
</P>
<P>
   It turns out that Nyah was once Ambrose's lover. So, in a plot
twist swiped from Alfred Hitchcock's ``Notorious,'' Nyah's
assignment (should she choose to accept it) is to infiltrate the
baddie's compound by returning to his bed.
</P>
<P>
   After an hour, just when the movie needs to be coming together
and growing more complicated, it gets simple and dumb. There are a
lot of overamplified kung-fu fights, grenade detonations and a very
long motorcycle chase consisting of quick, tight shots that never
allow us to get a sense of real movement.

 &HT;    A double dose of Demi can't heat up this `Passion'
 &HT;    By Eleanor Ringel Gillespie
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Is double the Demi double the fun?
</P>
<P>
   Not really. But then, fun isn't exactly what the ex-Mrs. Bruce
Willis' new movie has in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Passion of Mind,'' which could be subtitled ``The Double Life
of Demi,'' is a romantic fantasy/psychological drama along the
lines of ``Sliding Doors'' or ``Me Myself I.'' Moore plays a woman
who lives two lives simultaneously. In one, she's Marie, a widowed
mother who resides in a picture-perfect villa in Provence and
supports her two young daughters by free-lancing book reviews for
The New York Times. In the other, she's Marty, a high-powered,
unattached literary agent who spends her time rushing around the
gleaming spires of New York City.
</P>
<P>
   The neat twist in Ron Bass' script, which he wrote over a decade
ago with Michelle Pfeiffer involved, is that both Marty and Marie
are fully aware of each other's existence. That is, Marie knows
that when she falls asleep in France, she'll wake up in Marty's
glossy Manhattan loft. And Marty knows that going to bed means a
trip to rural France the next morning.
</P>
<P>
   They also both realize that one of these lives must be a
fantasy, which is why both go to shrinks. But which life is real?
And if Marty/Marie could choose, which would it be?
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good. But where ``Passion'' runs into problems is the
way it tries to fill in both lives. The result, alas, is a kind of
glorified Lifetime movie, times two. In France, Marie meets a
handsome, available, sensitive novelist (Stellan Skarsgard) whose
book she once panned. In New York, Marty meets a handsome,
available, sensitive accountant (William Fichtner) whom she once
chewed out over a client. As both relationships become more
intimate, Marty/Marie freely discusses her other life with the man
of the moment. Instead of worrying about how thoroughly bonkers she
might be, they shrug and decide they're jealous of the other guy.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago, director Alain Berliner made the marvelous ``Ma
Vie en Rose,'' in which a little boy was firmly convinced he was a
little girl. Berliner obviously knows how to handle dicey material.
But the trouble here is that ``Passion'' isn't dicey enough.
</P>
<P>
   Too bad, because the way everything ties together at the end has
a genuine emotional kick. But by the time we get there, our
emotional involvement with Marty/Marie has diminished. By half at
the very least.

it could be.

 &HT;    `Shanghai' fine-tunes Chan comedy formula
 &HT;    By Steve Murray
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   A buddy movie that tweaks cowboy cliches as it gallops through
the prairies, ``Shanghai Noon'' lassos up all the revisionist
laughs and action scenes that last summer's ``Wild Wild West''
botched. Following ``Rush Hour,'' it shows that Hong Kong action
star Jackie Chan may have finally found the formula for Hollywood
stardom. Give Chan a comic co-star and a movie genre that's
familiar but flexible, and let him rip.
</P>
<P>
   Here Chan plays Chon Wang, a member of China's imperial guard,
who volunteers to head for the United States (along with three
other guards) to rescue Princess Pei Pei (Lucy Liu). Fleeing an
arranged engagement, she's been tricked and kidnapped by Chinese
traitor Lo Fong (Roger Yuan), who has enslaved scores of his
countrymen, forcing them to lay railroad tracks in rough-and-tumble
Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   Way out West, Chon crosses paths with sensitive train robber Roy
(Owen Wilson). They don't exactly bond at first sight, but come
together after separate encounters with some angry Crow Indians and
Roy's traitorous gang members. Passing through the genre's familiar
stations _ bordellos, posses, gallows and shootouts _ ``Noon'' lets
Chan use moose antlers, horseshoes and pine saplings as weapons,
take a big fall from a mission bell tower and contend with a
drunken horse. He also demonstrates a memorable method for breaking
out of jail, involving a length of silk and a bodily function.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, Tom Cruise did many of his stunts in ``Mission: Impossible
2.'' But Chan has been doing all his own stunts for 20 years. The
movie doesn't underscore his work with slo-mo shots, although you
might wish it did; you'll marvel at his speed and precision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shanghai Noon'' doesn't have the major, gasp-inducing stunt
centerpiece that most of Chan's movies feature. It's more generous
toward the balance between the Hong Kong star and Wilson. Besides,
by now Chan doesn't have to prove anything. He's perfected his mix
of good-natured goofiness and switchblade movements. (On the goofy
side of things, he gets wasted on a night of peace-pipe puffing and
later during a drinking game Wilson teaches him at a brothel, where
for some reason they wind up splashing around in the same bathtub.)
Wilson holds his own against Chan, delivering a sweetly off-kilter
performance that's bound to elevate his Hollywood profile.
</P>
<P>
   First-time feature director Tom Dey gives us a West comically
teeming with cultural confusion wrought by Manifest Destiny; white
settlers variously mistake Chan for a Native American or a Jew.
Screenwriters Alfred Gough and Miles Millar don't pretend to be
historically accurate. Their anachronistic dialogue has Roy trying
to woo a girl away from Chon by warning her, ``He comes from a very
male-dominated society.''
</P>
<P>
   The fine supporting cast includes Walton Goggins as a
double-crossing bank robber, Xander Berkeley as a hissable marshal
and Brandon Merrill as a resourceful Indian princess who comes to
the bumbling leads' rescue more than once. Liu gets a chance to cut
loose with some martial arts moves near the end, but her character
could have been given more oomph to raise the movie's already high
energy.
</P>
<P>
   Paying homage to the wide-screen appeal of the Western
landscape, cinematographer Dan Mindel delivers several breathtaking
vistas. And yes, for the record, Chan and Wilson ride off into the
sunset together. But don't leave when they do, or you'll miss the
credits, featuring Chan's traditional outtakes, goofs and blunders.

 &HT;    Sweeps give way to reruns
 &HT;    By Phil Kloer
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   We've said goodbye to May sweeps, which officially ended
Wednesday night. They were the sweeps in which practically all we
did was say goodbye.
</P>
<P>
   To ``Beverly Hills 90210,'' long past its heyday, but which
lives on, Stridex-pad-legacywise, on the WB.
</P>
<P>
   To ``Party of Five,'' ``Cosby'' and ``Boy Meets World.'' To
Andrea Thompson (Detective Jill Kirkendall of ``NYPD Blue''), who's
giving up acting to become a local news anchor. To ``X-Filer'' Fox
Mulder, whisked away by a spacecraft in the season finale; David
Duchovny will be MIA for the first part of next season.
</P>
<P>
   And to ``Spin City's'' Michael J. Fox, who exited graciously
Wednesday night after the most overdone and overplayed tear-jerking
promotional spots in TV history. Get a grip, ABC. You know Fox is
planning to come back to the show next season for guest
appearances; the head of ABC Entertainment announced it to
advertisers last week. Funny how that didn't make it into those
sappy promos.
</P>
<P>
   And so, moving forward, it's summertime, which means reruns are
in full bloom. But at least a lot of swimming pools are opening
this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Friday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Making the Band'' (9 p.m. on ABC) _ A group of cute young
studs compete to become members of a boy band. This series ran for
three weeks a while back and bombed, but ABC is repackaging it and
trying again.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Teen People's 25 Hottest Stars Under 25'' (3:38 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   on WSB) _ No, that time is not a typo. WSB is pre-empting this
ABC hour of eye candy for a ``Monica Kaufman Close-Ups'' special at
8 p.m. and bumping it to the wee hours. Justin Timberlake of 'N
Sync hosts this hymn to young 'uns, some of whom are there on
talent (singer Charlotte Church, the cast of ``That '70s Show'')
and some mainly on looks (singer Mandy Moore, who makes Britney
Spears look like Aretha Franklin).
</P>
<P>
   Saturday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Dirty Pictures'' (9 p.m. on Showtime) _ Two weeks ago
Showtime ran ``Rated X''; now it's ``Dirty Pictures.'' But
``Pictures'' isn't as dirty as ``Rated X'' was. James Woods stars
as Dennis Barrie, the director of a Cincinnati art museum who got
into big trouble in 1990 for displaying sexually explicit
photographs by Robert Mapplethorpe. It's more an endorsement of the
First Amendment than anything else.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Guinness Book of World Records Primetime'' (9 p.m. on Fox) _
It's baa-aack! The show that gave us the tumor as big as the Ritz
tonight has a guy who can water-ski barefoot at 150 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Mission: Impossible Marathon'' (10 a.m.-5 p.m. on FX) _ With
the Tom Cruise movie sequel opening, cable's FX channel reruns some
of the original TV series, which aired from 1966 to '73. Fewer
chases and special effects, but it did have Martin Landau and
Barbara Bain.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``The Indianapolis 500''
</P>
<P>
   (11 a.m. on ABC) _ Around and around and around and . . .
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``On the Beach'' (8 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   on Showtime) _ Aussies Bryan Brown and Rachel Ward co-star in
this remake of Nevil Shute's post-apocalyptic novel, originally
filmed in 1959 with Gregory Peck and Ava Gardner. Unlike the recent
live ``Fail Safe,'' ``Beach'' has been updated to modern times, but
it's still basically about a small group of survivors of a nuclear
war in Australia. Showtime shot it as a two-parter and now has
decided to air it all in one night, which might indicate just
getting it over with.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Twin Peaks'' (8 p.m. on
</P>
<P>
   Bravo) and ``Dune'' (8 p.m. on Sci-Fi) _ In a weird scheduling
coincidence, Bravo reruns the classic two-hour pilot to ``Peaks'' _
still an amazing slice of television, despite what happened to the
series later _ while the Sci-Fi Channel shows the widely disparaged
movie ``Dune.'' Both star Kyle MacLachlan, and both were directed
by David Lynch. Only ``Twin Peaks,'' though, has that damn fine
cherry pie.
</P>
<P>
   Movies
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Six Degrees of Separation'' (10:30 p.m. Saturday on Bravo) _
Kevin Bacon isn't in it, but Will Smith is.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  ``Footloose'' (3:10 p.m. Sunday on TNT) _ Six degrees of Lori
Singer? Naw, that just doesn't work as well.

   SUMMER-FILMS (Undated) _ Like death and taxes some things never
seem to change. Like summer movies. Always the same: fiery
explosions, knock-out special effects, thin plots, well-muscled
stars. Add to that nonstop television commercials, toys on the
shelves, action figures in the Happy Meal. It seems so formulaic.
Despite appearances, however, the summer blockbuster has changed
plenty since its birth, but the changes have been subtle and
cumulative. By Nancy Hass.

   LOCATIONS-FILMS (Paris) _ Romantic confusions of person and
place: Films like ``The Talented Mr. Ripley,'' ``The Beach,'' ``Out

Dreamed of Africa'' have attempted to explore what happens when
people join hands and parachute into the wilderness of a shared

opera heroes offer a unique twist: they live in the past. By
Matthew Gurewitsch.
</P>
<P>
   By JAZZ-SOLOS (Undated) _ The solo is certainly the primary
symbol of jazz to the outside world _ a rail-splitting statement
made within a rail-splitting music. In the history of jazz
criticism, solos have been taken as the highest mode of assertion;
there are more analyses of solos than those of rhythm sections, for
example, and they're much better-known pieces of criticism. And
most of the great heroes of the music have been powerhouse
soloists. By Ben Ratliff.

<P>
   TAKE-FO-MUSIC (New Orleans) _ By all means, this should have
been the time for Take Fo' to explode into the mainstream. The
music it popularized, a salacious, booty-shaking regional dance
music called bounce, has in the last year fueled some of hip-hop's
biggest hits. On radio stations around the country, every fan of
urban pop was dancing to Earl Mackie's music. Only they didn't know
it was his. By Neil Strauss.
</P>
<P>
   KATEY-RED-MUSIC (New Orleans) _ Katey Red may be one of the
first openly homosexual rap and bounce-music artist to earn respect
in this notoriously homophobic world. Add to that Katey Red's
chronic respiratory problems and a debilitating stutter, and you
have a most unlikely regional star, even in a city with a rich

   PREMIERES-MUSIC (Undated) _ Premieres are unnatural births.
Humans, unlike Greek gods and new operas, enter the world helpless
and barely formed. An opening night, especially one preceded by
fanfare, speculation and promotion, has no chance at childhood and
adolescence. Often its midwives are inept and its expectant parents
unprepared. The new piece happens all at once and fully formed. It

   DINOSAURS-TV (Undated) _ This spring, the one-two punch of
``Walking With Dinosaurs'' and ``Raising the Mammoth'' heightened
the visibility of the Discovery Channel. But the public was already
watching, to the tune of 178 million households worldwide. How did
dinosaurs and woolly mammoths manage to compete with Regis Philbin
in popularity without giving away money? According to Dr. James
Powell, the head of Los Angeles County's Natural History Museum
Foundation, their appeal, especially to children, may be related to
their enormous size. ``They are fantastic, as in creatures of
fantasy _ as though they had been dreamed up by a science-fiction
writer,'' he said. ``They weren't. They lived, they breathed, they

   ROME-ART (Rome) _ For years, the problem of how to be both

been solved as nimbly or as persuasively as in an exhibition in
Rome called ``L'Idea del Bello'' at the Palazzo delle Esposizione
on the Via Nazionale, on view through June 26. (The title can be
read in English as ``The Idea of Beauty'' or ``Beauty as an
Idea.'') By John Russell.

   GILBERT-ART (London) _ Sir Arthur Gilbert, a British-born art
collector long resident in Los Angeles, could not be happier. Last

decorative art, opened to the public in an elegant
late-18th-century palace on the banks of the Thames in central
London. By Alan Riding.

   ANTIQUE-BOOKS (London) _ In its heyday a half century ago,
Foyle's, on Charing Cross Road here, was known the world over as
the people's bookstore, stocking five million books, mostly
secondhand, on every imaginable subject, on its 30 miles of
shelves. Now, the Foyle family and other heirs are selling William
Foyle's books at Christie's here in a sale described as ``the
largest British book collection to be auctioned in 20 years.'' By

<P>
   CALICO-DOTCOM (San Jose, Calif.) _ In November, 100 employees of
Calico Commerce were millionaires, at least on paper. Today only 20
are. With Calico's stock down 80 percent from its peak last fall,
the rest have watched their wealth melt away over the last five
months like snow in the hot California sun. But Calico, which makes
software designed to help companies sell their products over the
Internet, seems to be weathering the storm so far. By Alex
Berenson.

   HMO-CONSUMERS (Undated) _ A doctor refuses a treatment for a
sick child. State medical officials later find the treatment was
medically necessary, and that the doctor blundered. Can the doctor
escape punishment because he works as a medical director for an HMO
or other managed care company? That is the question in a federal
court lawsuit in Dallas that pits one of the nation's largest
health insurance providers, UnitedHealthcare, against Texas
officials who have proposed disciplining one of the company's
medical directors, the unseen but powerful officials who make the
behind-the-scenes decisions to approve or deny patient treatments.

   ASSISTED-LIVING (Undated) _ Fueled by favorable demographic
trends, strong consumer demand and a robust economy, the
assisted-living industry was supposed to be mounting record profits
this year while expanding rapidly and reaching new stock market
peaks. That, at least, is what analysts were predicting three years
ago. It has not exactly worked out that way. By Terry Pristin.

<P>
   BIZ-BOOK (Undated) _ A decade or so ago Dennis N.T. Perkins,
president of Syncretics Group, Branford, Conn., brought us ``the
moose at the table,'' the disarming metaphor that companies use to
mention the unmentionable. He devised that impish but effective
image as a way of coaxing business people into talking openly about
the sensitive issues that hang heavy over a discussion but that no
one dares mention. Now Perkins, a management consultant whose
clients include American Express, Bose, Citibank and Marriott, is
back with bigger game in mind. His new book offers lessons in
leadership ``at the outer limits of human endurance _ the place I
call The Edge.'' By Fred Andrews.

   ON-THE-JOB (Undated) _ Like most things in life, commuting is in
the eye of the beholder. Most of the time, it's an obligation, a
habit, no more than a repetitive journey from home to workplace and
back again. But once in a while, commuting becomes high adventure,
a source of laughter and the stuff of lasting memories. By Lawrence
Van Gelder.

   ABOUT-CARS-TAHOE (Beverly Hills, Calif.) _ When General Motors
put its huge Suburban on the treadmill and watched it lose about 20
inches around the midsection, it created the Chevrolet Tahoe and
the GMC Yukon, shorter, more manageable sport utilities with major
V8 power. What it lacked was a third row of seats and the bright
folks at Ford and Dodge didn't let GM forget it. Now the big news
is not only that GM will put a third seat in its Tahoes and Yukons,
but it split the third bench in half so that each part can fold
neatly out of the way for cargo. By Leonard M. Apcar.

   PHILADELPHIA _ This is a city on second base, wondering if it
can make it all the way home.
</P>
<P>
   The old Philadelphia, which lived on manufacturing and banking
and lawyering, ran out of steam a half-century ago. Now the city is
betting a billion dollars and more that a new Philadelphia can
prosper on history and culture and tourism _ that people will come
here not merely for the obligatory visit to the Liberty Bell with
the kids but for several days of meetings, music, art, shopping and
good food as well.
</P>
<P>
   An unmistakable new energy has taken hold in Center City, as the
locals call downtown Philadelphia. Without losing its civilized
manners, the city has begun to bounce after dark; Walnut Street's
sidewalks are still crowded at 10 p.m. A Democrat, Ed Rendell, a
husky, dynamic former mayor, gets much of the credit for setting
the transformation in motion, but the first big payoff is this
year's Republican National Convention, opening here on July 31.
</P>
<P>
   ``People at the convention will see signs of a real renaissance
in key parts of the city,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, who served as
Philadelphia's district attorney before heading to Washington.
``But don't delude yourself: 15 blocks from the center, enormous
problems remain.''
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia was, of course, America's original convention city,
beginning in 1774 with the Continental Congress, which two years
later produced the Declaration of Independence. But no major
political party has held its quadrennial powwow in the city since
1948, when no fewer than three of them did so (the Democrats, to
choose Harry S. Truman; the Republicans, to nominate Thomas E.
Dewey, and the Progressives, to name Henry A. Wallace).
</P>
<P>
   A lot has happened since then, too much of it bad. Philadelphia
lost many of its defining institutions, including The Saturday
Evening Post, once the nation's leading magazine; The Bulletin, a
powerful and venerable evening newspaper; the Pennsylvania
Railroad, one of the first great routes to the West; John
Wanamaker's department store, a pioneer of mass merchandising; and
the Philadelphia Athletics, who made baseball history under Connie
Mack. It had a surly white mayor, Frank Rizzo, whose
confrontational approach to blacks was typified by the nightstick
he once famously tucked into his cummerbund, and a star-crossed
black mayor, W. Wilson Goode, who in 1985 dropped a firebomb on the
headquarters of a radical group in his own city.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976 an outbreak of a mysterious respiratory disease killed
34 members of the American Legion attending a convention here.
</P>
<P>
   David Cohen, a co-chairman of the host committee for the
Republican gathering, defined the status quo ante in these words:
``People didn't have low expectations of Philadelphia; they had no
expectations of Philadelphia.'' They saw it, he said, as ``an old
city, falling apart, dirty and unsafe.''
</P>
<P>
   A first important step toward recovery was a new convention
center, which opened in 1993. Then, in 1996, 548,000 people came to
see a Cezanne exhibition at the Museum of Art _ many of them
suburbanites who hadn't been downtown in years, many others from
New York, Washington and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Local leaders realized that there was big money in culture.
Broad Street got a face-lift and a new name, the Avenue of the
Arts, and this year steelwork for a new, $245 million Regional
Performing Arts Center began rising there. Designed by Rafael
Vinoly of New York in emulation of London's 19th-century Crystal
Palace, it is scheduled to open in the fall of 2001.
</P>
<P>
   To house the hoped-for throngs of visitors, 5,000 new hotel
rooms have been added in the metropolitan area in four years. Two
of the splashiest new hotels and several restaurants have taken
over old banks; the metaphor is almost too apt.
</P>
<P>
   The much-admired PSFS building (the letters stand for
Philadelphia Savings Fund Society, though few remember that) is now
a Loews hotel, with all its architectural glories, including a
polished black granite base that bends around a corner,
miraculously intact. Designed by William Lescaze and George Howe in
1932, it was the first International Style skyscraper built in this
country, just at the end of the Art Deco era. Soon the old Girard
Trust Co., a little Ionic temple with a perfect dome, designed in
dazzlingly white Georgia marble by Stanford White, will be a
Ritz-Carlton.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia used to concentrate on food that filled big men up
fast: cheese steaks, hoagies, soft pretzels, L.D. Bassett's
world-class ice cream, scrapple (a Pennsylvania Dutch blend of
cornmeal and unmentionable pig parts), sticky buns and pepper pot
soup (a potent brew of honeycomb tripe and hot chilies). Most of
the traditional fare can still be found at the Reading Terminal
Market (often sold there by Amish or Mennonite women in white gauze
caps) or at Bookbinders Seafood House on 15th Street or both.
</P>
<P>
   BOOMING (AND SHRINKING)
</P>
<P>
   But now the city is a playground for foodies, with heroically
hip restaurants opening every month. These are no storefront
improvisations; by the end of the year, Neil Stein, who started it
all with a place called Striped Bass, will have opened five
sophisticated spots at a cost of $10 million. ``I think it will
work,'' he told me, ``if the economy holds up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rick Nichols, who has watched the city's travails for years from
various posts at The Philadelphia Inquirer, sounded similarly
cautious.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fate of Philadelphia really hangs in the balance,'' he
said. ``Can we live off this culture-dining-service boom, or do we
need more lunch-bucket jobs to keep the thing going?''
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Look carefully on the side streets downtown, and you will see
vacant shops and even a few vacant buildings. The region's retail
nexus is not there but out in the suburbs, at King of Prussia, in a
megamall where Hermes and Neiman Marcus and other chic merchants
court the carriage trade. Jobs have fled the city, too, as
companies like CoreStates Financial and Bell Atlantic have closed
or shrunk their Philadelphia offices because of mergers.
</P>
<P>
   New stadiums for the Phillies and Eagles are all talk and no
action, and the ballyhooed DisneyQuest mall is just another hole in
the ground, its financing having collapsed. Rendell, now the
Democratic national chairman, must be devastated; the project had
so excited him that he told an English visitor, ``To call it
virtual reality is to call Michelangelo a house painter.'' The city
will now have to make do with a $300 million Family Entertainment
Center at Penn's Landing on the Delaware River, featuring a
children's museum, an 18-screen multiplex cinema, restaurants and a
wide range of shops. Not exactly the sort of thing that brings the
Renaissance to mind.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   William P. Hankowsky, Philadelphia's industrial development
czar, acknowledged frankly that ``you have two contradictory
phenomena here at the same time: Center City is booming, with
people moving back downtown, while the population as a whole is
still in decline.'' With some exceptions, like Chestnut Hill, the
northern, western and southern parts of Philadelphia are worn and
worried. Between 1990 and 1998, the city lost 9.4 percent of its
population; of the 10 largest cities in the United States, only
Detroit and Philadelphia shrank, and Philadelphia shrank more.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Philadelphians tend to undersell Philadelphia. Is it the Quaker
heritage of dour understatement? Or the city's position halfway
between the nation's political capital, to the south, and its
economic and cultural capital, to the north? Could it possibly be
an inferiority complex?
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheering against the home team is a time-honored tradition in
Philadelphia,'' wrote the social historian E. Digby Baltzell.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason, locals have allowed a Philadelphia-born
comedian of minimal talent, W.C. Fields, to fasten a joke to their
city like a barnacle. Asked what he wanted on his gravestone, the
great man is said to have replied, ``On the whole, I'd rather be in
Philadelphia.'' That one-liner has been repeated ad nauseam.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this has always been a richly endowed city, full of
distinctive neighborhoods, a center of artistic and intellectual
life since the days of Benjamin Franklin and the Peales, much loved
by those who live here. The population is less transient than in
most large American cities; Philadelphians may flee to the suburbs,
but most of them go no farther.
</P>
<P>
   Whether they call it Philadelphia or Philly, a nickname loved by
some and loathed by others, whether they are Rocky Balboas (or
Frankie Avalons or Vic Damones) from gritty, Italian-American South
Philadelphia or Tracy Lords from the wealthy, pastoral Main Line,
they are staunch loyalists.
</P>
<P>
   The Philadelphia story started with that redoubtable Quaker,
William Penn, who laid out the city's grid in 1682. It was he, not
some latter-day adman, who named it the City of Brotherly Love, and
he who gave it many of its characteristics: its respect for
education (Temple, Villanova, Haverford, Swarthmore, Bryn Mawr and
Drexel, as well as the University of Pennsylvania, with its
celebrated Wharton School of Business, carry that tradition forward
today); its wide streets and its extensive parks, religious
tolerance and closely knit families.
</P>
<P>
   As usual, Mark Twain got the picture. In Boston, he said, people
ask, ``What does he know?'' In New York they ask, ``How much does
he make?'' In Philadelphia, the crucial question is, ``Who were his
parents?''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Some of those families can be frosty, snobby and self-satisfied,
their lives consecrated to the First Troop of the Philadelphia City
Cavalry, the Merion Cricket Club and the Union League Club (whose
brownstone clubhouse bears a plaque celebrating its loyalty to the
North in the Civil War). Many live in the western suburbs known as
the Main Line because the Pennsylvania railroad connected them on a
route running from Philadelphia to Paoli.
</P>
<P>
   Generations of young college students learned a mnemonic aid to
help them find their way home: ``Old maids never wed and have
babies,'' for Overbrook, Merion, Narberth, Wynnewood, Ardmore,
Haverford, Bryn Mawr.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   But of course Philadelphia is not all socialites or Quakers or
Italian-Americans, and even if the current gamble succeeds, it will
not become a tourist target and little else, like Las Vegas or
Orlando. Anne d'Harnoncourt, the director of the Museum of Art, New
York-bred but devotedly Philadelphian by adoption, calls this ``a
city full of nooks and niches.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not just Rittenhouse Square, the traditional center of
patrician Philadelphia, bounded by mismatched buildings that give
it visual vigor, used every day by dogs and bums and
Frisbee-tossing adolescents and pram-pushing nannies and students
from the nearby Curtis Institute of Music, and celebrated for its
vitality by no less than Jane Jacobs.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia is also the home of an old and eminent black
community, which has produced national leaders like A. Leon
Higginbotham Jr., who was a towering presence on the Federal
appeals bench; former congressman William Gray, who now heads the
United Negro College Fund; and William Coleman, a former
transportation secretary. And it is a river town; the Schuylkill
(pronounced SKOO-kul) ) is one of the city's delights, especially
on days when it is filled with sculls and eight-oared shells from
clubs along its bank. Grace Kelly's father and brother, both named
Jack, rowed there and won national titles.
</P>
<P>
   FROM GREEK REVIVAL TO POP
</P>
<P>
   The tide of the Revolution flowed through and around
Philadelphia. Washington crossed the Delaware just north of town,
lost to the redcoats at Germantown and spent the severe winter of
1777-78 at Valley Forge. But it is in the Old City, in the blocks
south of Walnut Street between Second and Sixth Streets, that the
drama of those astounding years comes to life.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps it is, as its promoters say, ``The Most Historic Square
Mile in America.'' Few visitors miss the Liberty Bell or
Independence Hall, where both the Declaration and the Constitution,
those two extraordinary products of Enlightenment genius, were
debated and finally approved. Even the history-averse are stirred,
though the fabric of the buildings has been mended as often as an
old sock.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Franklin was a dominant figure in the life of the city
and the young nation, so it seems fitting that he is buried nearby,
across the street from the Free Quaker Meeting House. His grave is
strewn with coins tossed by tourists mindful of his maxim ``A penny
saved is a penny earned''; the site of his house is marked by a
steel frame devised by Robert Venturi, a ``skeleton'' of the
original, much more evocative than a mere reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the red-brick houses where Washington and Madison
and the others lived during the decade from 1790 to 1800, when
Philadelphia was the nation's capital, still stand on the cobbled
streets, shaded by plane trees, south of the Independence National
Historic Park. You can sit in the pews where the Founding Fathers
sat (Washington used Pew 58) at Christ Church, whose six-sided,
209-foot steeple, built in 1753 and 1754, was the tallest structure
in America for more than a century. Influenced by the work of Gibbs
and Wren in London, the church is remarkable for its broad expanses
of clear glass.
</P>
<P>
   Some idea of the wealth of Philadelphia may be gained from late
Georgian mansions like Cliveden (1767), in Germantown, and Mount
Pleasant (1762), in Fairmount Park, the nation's largest urban
park. Cliveden, seat of the Chew family, still contains chairs and
a sofa by Thomas Affleck, one of the greatest Colonial furniture
makers. At the end of the 18th century, Philadelphia was the
leading American city. Once the government left, it never again
enjoyed that eminence.

   But it built as if it did. That was the doing mainly of Nicholas
Biddle, the city's social, cultural and financial star (and the
founder of its most notable dynasty of civic leaders). He returned
from a trip to Athens in 1806 with this in his diary: ``The two
great truths in the world are the Bible and Grecian architecture.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon the city was awash in Greek Revival temples, from the
Philadelphia Water Works (1819) along the Schuylkill River to
Biddle's own magnificent house, Andalusia (1836), high above the
east bank of the Delaware, with a grand, six-column-wide portico
designed by Thomas U. Walter. The Second Bank of the United States
(1819-1824), designed by William Strickland, parts of which
literally copied the Parthenon, is the masterpiece of the genre. In
this white marble temple, Biddle, the bank's president, fought with
Henry Clay against Andrew Jackson for control of the nation's
monetary supply, and lost. Monuments and Culture
</P>
<P>
   Ever since Biddle's day, Philadelphia has had a taste for the
monumental. A climax of sorts was reached in the exuberant Second
Empire City Hall (1872-1901), a hulking, multi-pavilioned mountain
of a building topped by a statue of the city's founder, William
Penn. The creation of Alexander Milne Calder, Penn stands up there
in a broad-brimmed hat, all of 37 feet tall.
</P>
<P>
   Benjamin Franklin Parkway, the city's ceremonial boulevard, is a
Calder-to-Calder-to-Calder triple play. Halfway along its length,
one comes to Logan Circle, which was modeled after the Place de la
Concorde in Paris; the fountain in the center is by A.M.'s son,
Alexander Stirling Calder. At the far end of the parkway, at the
top of the steps leading up to the Greek Revival facade of the
Museum of Art (remember them from ``Rocky''?), stands a bold red
stabile called ``The Eagle,'' by A.S.'s son, Alexander Calder.
</P>
<P>
   The transitional figure in Philadelphia architecture was Frank
Furness, whose taste for the exotic and the eclectic is evident in
the Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts. His enthusiasm for
certain kinds of foliate decoration communicated itself to a young
draftsman in his office named Louis Sullivan, who returned to
Chicago and became a pioneer modernist.
</P>
<P>
   Philadelphia has had two great latter-day modernists: Louis I.
Kahn, whose Richards laboratories at Penn (1960-64) turn the
unavoidable technological folderol into crisp design elements,
prefiguring the Pompidou Center in Paris, and Venturi, the father
of Pop architecture. For me at least, local buildings by Frank
Lloyd Wright (a synagogue in Elkins Park) and Helmut Jahn (the
Liberty Place skyscrapers) are less successful.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Museum of Art and the Philadelphia Orchestra are both ranked
among the top five or six institutions of their kind in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   Founded exactly 100 years ago, the orchestra is older. Wolfgang
Sawallisch, its current music director, surprised many here by
presenting its subscribers with a centennial program composed
entirely of 20th-century music, from Scriabin and Poulenc to
Lutoslawski and Takemitsu. Many of the pieces had been given their
American premieres by the orchestra under Eugene Ormandy and
Leopold Stokowski, who introduced Stravinsky's ``Rite of Spring''
here in 1922. Joseph H. Kluger, the orchestra's president, said
that the programs of more-or-less modern music had given a boost to
single-ticket sales, brought the average age of audiences down and
provided ``an idea we plan to build on.''
</P>
<P>
   The orchestra has been housed for years in the Academy of Music,
a charming, 143-year-old opera house whose acoustics are poor for
symphonic music. Soon the orchestra will be the main tenant in the
new arts center, and a new conductor is expected to replace
Sawallisch, who is 76, once the move is made. The move is not
without controversy; the old academy may be the city's most beloved
building, and neither the Pew nor the Annenberg foundations, two of
the city's cultural mainstays, contributed to the new center's
cost.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, it will confer at least one indisputable benefit on
the city by opening more room at the academy for the Philadelphia
Opera, which has made considerable progress under Robert B. Driver,
and the Pennsylvania Ballet. Their growth has been stunted by a
dearth of free dates there.
</P>
<P>
   Across from the academy is the Wilma Theater, designed by Hugh
Hardy. Two Czech-born directors, Blanka and Jiri Zizka, present
works there by David Gow, Tom Stoppard and many others, in
productions that are often controversial but very seldom dull.
</P>
<P>
   A VAST BASTION OF ART
</P>
<P>
   The vast, honey-colored Museum of Art looks as if it had been
there for 700 years, not 70. It will soon get an annex _ an Art
Deco building across the street, which will provide 100,000 square
feet of additional space. Its holdings are enormous, ranging from
period rooms (including one by the great Scottish designer Robert
Adam) to impressive arrays of armor and Oriental art. It also
continues, in the tradition of the Cezanne show, to mount and
aggressively promote special shows, though I must confess that I
found the current exhibition of 18th-century Roman art a letdown;
for me, it's a struggle to accept Pompeo Batoni as a seminal figure
among European painters.
</P>
<P>
   But the museum's permanent painting collections more than make
up for that. Its old masters are dominated by the pictures
accumulated by John G. Johnson, the prototypical Philadelphia
lawyer, who appeared a record 168 times before the Supreme Court.
And his pictures (among them arresting works by van Eyck and
Giovanni di Paolo) are dominated by the majestic Rogier van der
Weyden portrayal of the Crucifixion with the Virgin and St. John
the Evangelist.
</P>
<P>
   The austere figures are shown against brilliant red hangings,
the Virgin crumpling in grief, Christ's loincloth lifted by some
mysterious force. It is the saddest, greatest painting in the
museum and one of the greatest in the United States. I have sat
before it a dozen times, always mesmerized.
</P>
<P>
   In another part of the building are assembled the brilliant,
before-their-time collections of Walter and Louise Arensberg and
A.E. Gallatin, notably Miros, Brancusis and Duchamps, including the
once-scandalous ``Nude Descending a Staircase.'' At the moment, the
modern galleries are being renovated, but that gives visitors a
chance to see (and compare) three large-scale masterpieces in one
small room: Leger's colorful, mechanistic ``City''; Picasso's
``Three Musicians,'' a pivotal example of Synthetic Cubism; and
Cezanne's architectonic yet lyrical ``Large Bathers.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the museum also prides itself on its paintings by
local artists, and it would be a mistake to miss Thomas Eakins'
``Concert Singer.'' But a greater Eakins painting, ``The Gross
Clinic,'' hangs at Thomas Jefferson University, and others are at
St. Charles Borromeo Seminary in Overbrook, where the painter
sought solace on Sunday afternoons.

&HT;     ARMY WEIGHS FIRST MILITARY EXECUTION IN 40 YEARS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 &HT;     (For release Sunday, May 28)   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By ERIC ROSENBERG  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the first time in nearly 40 years, the U.S.
military is preparing to execute one of its own, an Army private
convicted and sentenced to death for robbing and murdering two taxi
drivers in Killeen, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Loving, 31, of Rochester, N.Y., killed his victims in
Dec. 11, 1988, near Fort Hood, Texas, where he was stationed as an
artillery gunner. A 31-hour murder and robbery binge netted Loving
a little more than $100, trial evidence showed.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-member military tribunal found him guilty in April 1989
and sentenced him to death.
</P>
<P>
   Loving, imprisoned on death row at the Ft. Leavenworth, Kan.,
federal penitentiary, has had his death sentence upheld by
successive military courts. In 1996, the U.S. Supreme Court
unanimously upheld his conviction. Two years later, the court
declined to hear another appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing stands between Loving and lethal injection in
Leavenworth's death chamber except President Clinton and what his
lawyers and other legal experts claim is a vague and unfair
bureaucratic process now underway in the Army.
</P>
<P>
   In a procedure unique to the military, all capital cases _ after
they have run their course through the military's judiciary _ must
be sent for a final review by the top civilian chief of the
service. In Loving's case, that is Army Secretary Louis Caldera.
</P>
<P>
   The secretary and the Army judge advocate general _ the
service's top lawyer _ assess the evidence in the case and then
make a recommendation to the president about whether the death
sentence should be carried out.
</P>
<P>
   That recommendation to the president is supposed to be based on
the Army secretary's judgment about whether the punishment fits the
crime.
</P>
<P>
   Under the Uniformed Code of Military Justice, the regulations
that guide the military judicial system, the president has two
choices, once the military's recommendation reaches his desk. He
must either sign the prisoner's death warrant or commute the
sentence to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   The last capital case to be sent for presidential review
involved a U.S. Navy sailor who was convicted of murder. President
Kennedy, in 1961, commuted the death sentence to a prison term
because questions had been raised about the defendant's sanity at
the time of the crime. That same year, Kennedy approved the
execution of a soldier who was hanged for rape and attempted
murder.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last time an execution was carried out against a
member of the military.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, in addition to Loving, there are five men sitting on
military death row _ two others from the Army and three Marines.
</P>
<P>
   Loving's attorney, Theresa Norris, of Columbia, S.C., asserts
that the life-or-death process starting in the Pentagon and ending
up at the White House is weighted against military defendants
because it takes place behind closed doors and allows defense
counsel little opportunity to press their case. For example, the
Army's Pentagon review process in the Loving case has been underway
for about 16 months. But aside from one clemency request Norris
submitted in late 1998, she has had no communication with Army
headquarters since.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to death penalty in the military, there's no
provision for defense involvement,'' Norris said. ``I should be
able to respond to all recommendations (as the case travels up the
chain) but the way the system is set up, there is no opportunity at
all,'' she said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   Dwight Sullivan, a former Marine Corps lawyer and military death
penalty specialist with the Maryland chapter of the American Civil
Liberties Union, agrees.
</P>
<P>
   The manual of courts marital ``outlines a very scant process,''
Sullivan said. It is ``extremely difficult for Loving's defense
counsel, because she doesn't know to whom to make the clemency
arguments. It's amazingly frustrating and unfair,'' Sullivan said
in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's Judge Advocate General office defends the process.
</P>
<P>
   ``The requirements are clear and well-defined,'' the office said
in written responses to questions from Hearst Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the service lawyers said, the clemency petition
Norris submitted in 1998 ``will be considered by all officials who
make a recommendation, prior to making any recommendation as to
approval or commutation of Pvt. Loving's sentence.''Martha Rudd, an
Army spokeswoman at the Pentagon, said service lawyers are
methodically reviewing the case ``to be fair to (Loving), to make
sure everything that happens in his case is by the book and takes
into account everything that's occurred in the last 40 years that
might be relevant.''
</P>
<P>
   Army lawyers declined to discuss when the service would complete
its recommendation and forward it to the president. Historically,
some cases have made it to the president's desk in a year, while
others have required two years of review.  &UR;  &LR;  &QL; (Eric Rosenberg can be

 PHILADELPHIA: Sunday afternoons.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Art is, in fact, almost omnipresent in and around Philadelphia.
In Merion, the truly fabulous Barnes collection (reserve in
advance) mixes rustic ironwork with paintings that people travel
thousands of miles to see. The Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine
Arts boasts a brilliant American collection, including superb works
by Gilbert Stuart, Winslow Homer and all the Peales. The museum at
the University of Pennsylvania houses the golden treasures from the
ancient Sumerian city of Ur, amid much else. And the Rosenbach
Museum and Library contains not only the rare books and manuscripts
accumulated by A.S.W. Rosenbach, a scholarly, piratical dealer who
helped to build the Folger Library in Washington and the Huntington
Library near Los Angeles, but also important antique furniture.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Here is a sampling of attractions, along with travel
information:
</P>
<P>
   Where to Stay
</P>
<P>
   FOUR SEASONS, 1 Logan Square, (215) 963-1500. The opulent,
flower-filled lobby tells the story: no expense has been spared
here. But as one of the hotel's executives says, ``The mahogany and
marble are the easy parts.'' The hard part is building a skilled,
attentive, kindly staff, and the Seasons succeeds superbly on that
count, too. The Fountain dining room, where Jean-Marie Lacroix has
presided since 1983, is the peer of any restaurant in town.
Computer connections, a bit dated, are to be modernized soon.
Double room: $240 to $320, weekends; $305 to $400, weekdays.
</P>
<P>
   LOEWS, 1200 Market St., (215) 627-1200. A tip of the Apple hat
to the Tisch family, which has converted the landmark PSFS building
into a hotel of ravishing Art Deco beauty. The old vault doors and
silvery sans-serif signs have been used to great graphic effect in
the lobby, amidst acres of rosewood and etched glass. The 583
bedrooms murmur ``Hollywood, 1930,'' with a chaise longue in every
one; a club-floor library holds vintage books. Double room: $175 to
$365.
</P>
<P>
   RITTENHOUSE, 210 West Rittenhouse Square, (215) 546-9000. The
harsh zigzag facade does little for the harmony of the urban
environment, though it gives the 128 guest rooms leafy views.
Otherwise, the Rittenhouse is hard to fault, with a central
location, an invitingly cool lobby and bedrooms swimming with
space. Each has a desk tucked into an alcove, a fax and a video
tape player, plus a dressing area and a marble bathroom with an
oversize tub and separate stall shower. The low-key service is
charmingly accommodating. Double rooms from $360; occasional
weekend specials from $200.
</P>
<P>
   WHERE TO EAT
</P>
<P>
   LE BEC-FIN, 1523 Walnut St., (215) 567-1000. When Paul Bocuse
visited Georges Perrier's formal little jewel box, with its
raspberry-pink walls and tapestry-covered chairs, he pronounced it
``a real restaurant, more like Lyons than New York.'' The cooking
is classical, lightened and brightened here and there with an Asian
spice like Sichuan pepper. European fish (loup, turbot) are a
specialty, as are desserts, dispensed from a calorie chariot five
levels high. Great cheeses; great, very costly French wines.
</P>
<P>
   FORK, 306 Market St., (215) 625-9425. With bare floors, an open
kitchen, and a fixation on freshness worthy of Alice Waters, this
is the perfect place for lunch on a tour of the city's Colonial
shrines. Try the satisfyingly rustic chicken-mushroom-barley soup,
a fishy or meaty salad and the chocolate cake with banana gelato,
plus a beer from the cosmopolitan list.
</P>
<P>
   PASION!, 211 South 15th St., (215) 875-9895. For my money,
Guillermo Pernot's nuevo Latino cooking is the most exciting in
Philadelphia at the moment. A superlative chili-laced ceviche of
Chilean sea bass and seaweed, presented alongside a scallop shell,
is served with big smiles in a tented room full of palms and bright
fabrics. Likewise, an Argentine mixed grill, a Haitian empanada and
the very best Chilean wines.
</P>
<P>
   PAT'S KING OF STEAKS, Ninth and Wharton Streets, (215) 468-1546.
This is the real deal: these are the folks who gave the world the
Philly cheese steak _ thinly sliced, quickly grilled beef, slapped
onto an Italian roll, slathered with Cheez-Whiz, topped with
onions. Pat's stands on a triangular traffic island in the heart of
Rocky country, South Philadelphia, across the street from an
asphalt basketball court. You order your sandwich at a tiny window
and eat it at a plastic table, right on the street. It's silly,
sloppy and, in its own way, sublime.
</P>
<P>
   STRIPED BASS, 1500 Walnut St., (215) 732-4444. The lofty
ceilings and the marble columns of this erstwhile banking hall,
built in 1927, always put me in a mellow mood, as do the Fortuny
lighting fixtures and the snazzy metal fish hanging overhead.
Terence Feury, an alumnus of Le Bernardin in Manhattan, has
refreshed a tired menu with distinctive, unpompous dishes like
crisp-skinned striped bass (what else?) served on a tangle of
bitter greens.
</P>
<P>
   SUSANNA FOO, 1512 Walnut St., (215) 545-2666. Born in Mongolia,
Sue Foo, as the local Asian grocers like to call her, is equally at
home with Asian and European culinary traditions. In a dining room
full of orchids and Asian art, she serves a trio of dumplings
(shrimp, duck, lobster), each in a deliciously different wrapper,
and dares to pair fish in a tangy, winy sauce with sweet rice.
Five-spice Pennsylvania venison is another hit.
</P>
<P>
   TANGERINE, 232 Market St., (215) 627-5116. This semi-nightclub
is the town's hot spot, so you have to put up with noise, semi-pro
service and dim, candle-lighted, souk-like passageways. But most of
the Moroccan fantasy food is well worth it, notably gnocchi with
dates and harissa and a honey-and-lamb tagine, cooked in a crockery
dish with a top shaped like a coolie's hat. The fish and the duck
are overdone. Comfortably low-backed leather chairs; dandy desserts
(chocolate cake streaked with tangerine) from Laurie Shapiro.
</P>
<P>
   ATTRACTIONS
</P>

&HT;     GRAND OLD TIME FOR GIANTS PITCHER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRANK BLACKMAN  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Shawn Estes was sitting next to pitching coach
Dave Righetti when the San Francisco Giants loaded the bases in the
fifth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he was going to go deep,'' Righetti said. ``I said
never mind about that. Just concentrate on your pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes later, Estes strode to the plate and hit the first
pitch he saw into the seats in left field for a grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just joking around,'' Estes said after going the
distance in a preposterous 18-0 victory over Montreal on Wednesday
night at Pacific Bell Park, the most one-sided shutout in Giants
history going back to 1900. ``I said I might as well go deep.''
</P>
<P>
   It was the first grand slam by a big-league pitcher since Kent
Mercker did it for St. Louis against Florida on Sept. 2, 1998. It
was the first slam in a shutout since Fred Talbot did it for the
Seattle Pilots against the California Angels in 1969. It was the
first slam ever by a San Francisco pitcher. And it's the first slam
for a Giants pitcher since Monte Kennedy went deep July 3, 1949,
against the Brooklyn Dodgers at the Polo Grounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's such a surreal feeling,'' Estes said. ``There's nothing
to compare to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone joked that maybe the memorable home run should have an
asterisk next to it because the ball is juiced this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course,'' Estes said. ``I'll admit it. With the old ball,
it would have hit the wall or been caught. Thank you.''
</P>
<P>
   A gentleman named Alan Bown would like to say thank you to the
pitcher. He won $10,000 because it was the grand slam inning. That
must have been pretty surreal, too.
</P>
<P>
   Estes' grand slam and shutout in the same game are heady stuff,
something a player or a fan might go _ well, more than 30 years _
without seeing. Dusty Baker was impressed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was perhaps the best performance I've seen by a
pitcher,'' the Giants manager said.
</P>
<P>
   There was the potential for something even more remarkable. In
the eighth inning, Estes came to the plate with the bases loaded
again. The crowd was up and bellowing, perhaps aware that only two
players in baseball history have hit two grand slams in one game.
</P>
<P>
   And there was a roar when Estes slammed the second pitch he saw
toward the fence in left. But Tony Cloninger (who did it against
the Giants in 1966) and Fernando Tatis were safe. The ball died and
hooked foul into the seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hit it off the end of the bat,'' Estes said. ``The fans got
excited about nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, he lined a single into left field, driving home his
fifth run of the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things are good when a pitcher is asking you how many RBIs you
got after the game,'' said a smiling J.T. Snow, who also drove in
five runs.
</P>
<P>
   Estes was having a great time talking about his hitting.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather talk about hitting than pitching,'' he said.
``Hitting is not something pitchers are supposed to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Estes was able to keep things in perspective. The Giants
began the night having lost nine of their previous 10 games. So
what they really needed was a strong pitching effort from the
lefty.
</P>
<P>
   ``We definitely needed the win,'' Estes said. ``We didn't need a
grand slam.''
</P>
<P>
   The win really never was in doubt. San Francisco got on the
board immediately, scoring three times in the opening inning. Barry
Bonds, who left the game after the fifth inning when his calf
muscle tightened, doubled in the game's first run off Mike Thurman.
</P>
<P>
   Two innings later, Bonds preserved Estes' shutout by making a
diving, inning-ending catch of a sinking liner with a runner on
second. Then he came up in the bottom of the third and put a dent
in one of Thurman's pitches, the ball landing in McCovey Cove, the
distance from home plate estimated at 444 feet. It was the fourth
Giants homer, all by Bonds, to be entered on the Splash hits
counter.
</P>
<P>
   Bonds also was a contributor in the seven-run fifth, singling in
his third run. To that point, he was the star of the game. But then
Estes went deep. And when he completed the seven-hitter, he
deserved top billing even though Bonds finished a triple shy of the
cycle and Snow missed it by a double.
</P>
<P>
   ``Shawn's performance overshadowed great games by Barry and
J.T.,'' Baker said.
</P>
<P>
   Righetti said what impressed him the most is that Estes kept his
focus after the game became a blowout. Estes agreed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is hard,'' he said. ``As a pitcher, you don't want to show
up the other team by throwing them curves and changeups. But you
have a shutout to preserve. And you don't want to end on a bad
note.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't come close to doing that, preventing Montreal from
even getting a runner in scoring position the final seven innings.
</P>
<P>
   What with a slam, two near-cycles, a record shutout, and a big
money give-away, it was an unforgettable night at Pacific Bell
Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was just one of those nights,'' Snow said. ``Some nights
you really can't explain things.''

&HT;     GOVERNMENT PROMISES TIGHTER SECURITY IN WAKE OF BREACHES 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARK HELM  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Government officials promised Thursday to revamp
their security systems in the wake of stunning revelations that
undercover agents using fake cards identifying them as law officers
were able to penetrate 19 federal buildings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think anytime that you expose vulnerabilities, it's a good
thing,'' Attorney General Janet Reno said at a news conference
here. ``We've already begun looking into ways to improve our
security.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a report issued Thursday by the General Accounting
Office, an investigative arm of Congress, a team of GAO
investigators began the undercover operation early this month. The
agents acquired bogus New York Police Department and U.S. Drug
Enforcement Administration badges and credentials _ some of them
cast-off movie props, others manufactured through commercially
available software packages or material downloaded from the
Internet, the GAO said.Over the next three weeks, the agents tried
to get inside 19 federal facilities, which included the FBI
building, the Pentagon, and the CIA headquarters in Langley, Va.
Sometimes they told guards that they were police officers there on
official business. On other occasions, they simply sought to walk
in unannounced.
</P>
<P>
   Each time, the agents, who were armed, succeeded. They got
inside the supposedly secure facilities without being screened or
made to pass through standard metal detectors, the GAO reported.
</P>
<P>
   In some visits, the agents were escorted through the building.
Even then, however, they managed to go unattended to a restroom
carrying briefcases large enough to hold substantial quantities of
explosives, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
   But in other cases, the GAO, reported, ``escorts were not
required, and our agents wandered throughout without ever being
stopped.''At the CIA headquarters, which unlike other federal
facilities is closed to the public, the bogus cops faked out guards
last week.
</P>
<P>
   Although the agents had no appointment, they successfully talked
their way past the guard post at the compound's main gate and then
got past the guard station inside the main CIA building. Both sets
of sentries are supposed to check visitors' identification and
bags. The results of the undercover operation, coming on the heels
of major security breaches at the State Department, show that many
of the federal government's most sensitive sites ``are completely
vulnerable to `terrorism on the cheap,''' Rep. Bill McCollum
(R-Fla.), head of the House Judiciary subcommittee on crime, said
in a statement.McCollum held a hearing Thursday to examine the
troubling security lapses. It featured a videotape showing the
undercover agents quickly gaining entry into supposedly secure
sectors of the buildings, often without escorts or inspections.``In
a matter of 10 to 15 seconds, they were in,'' McCollum said at the
hearing.
</P>
<P>
   Embarrassed officials at the Justice Department said they
already were taking steps to beef up security.
</P>
<P>
   According to one of the top department internal security
official, who asked not to be identified, visiting law enforcement
officers now will be subjected to a more rigorous security check in
which they will be required to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Surrender their firearms before entering the building;
</P>
<P>
   _ Pass through a metal detector and have their bags X-rayed;
</P>
<P>
   _ Have an escort while in the building.
</P>
<P>
   ``No doubt, the main problem that came out of this was that
professional courtesy between law enforcement officers allowed
these undercover agents to slip by,'' the official said. ``That
will change.''
</P>
<P>
   The official also said the department was considering the
possibility of issuing to Justice personnel new ``bio-metric''
badges that contain a computer chip allowing guards at any federal
government building to pull up a photograph or fingerprint of the
person issued the credential.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a way to use new technology to our advantage, just as a
bad guy can use technology to his advantage,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   CIA officials refused to comment on whether they were changing
their security system. But Pentagon spokesman Craig Quigley said
military installations were taking steps similar to those at
Justice, including requiring law enforcement to surrender their
weapons before entering and to have an escort with them at all
times.
</P>
<P>
   The congressional investigation was spurred by a boom in the
online sale of fake police badges, driver's licenses, passports and
other forms of identification. Some realistic-looking fake IDs can
be bought directly on the Internet for as little as $10, while
other online merchants sell software so customers can make phony
IDs at home in unlimited quantities. Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine,
who has looked into the problem, was able to put her face on a
falsified Army Reserve identification card, a Connecticut driver's
license and a Boston University student ID, prompting her to call
last week for tougher federal penalties for making and using fake
IDs. Rep. Stephen Horn, R-Calif., worried about fake Los Angeles
police badges that have popped up in Southern California, has
proposed legislation to make it a federal crime to traffic in real
or counterfeit police badges.But the security lapses exposed by the
GAO agents represent perhaps the most serious threat posed by the
Internet ID business because they show how vulnerable many
supposedly secure facilities are to terrorism and spying, several
government officials said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was shocked,'' McCollum said. ``With a massive expansion of
federal anti-terrorist security measures in the wake of the
Oklahoma City bombing (in 1995), I would never have thought this
could happen.''

SONIC YOUTH: `NYC GHOSTS AND FLOWERS' 
</HEADLINE>
  By ANN POWERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Self-exile can be a fruitful state, and Sonic Youth _ New York's
quintessential rock band _ tastes its gifts on their new release,
``NYC Ghosts and Flowers'' (Geffen). It views the time and place
that inspires Sonic Youth's breakthrough art rock _ Gotham, as
shaped by the shared lineage of the Beats, the hippies and the
punks.
</P>
<P>
   In eight graceful vignettes that blend noise rock and melodic
musing, the band regards its own history through a cosmic
viewfinder, the landscapes tinged blue by a distance that is both
literal (half the band now lives in Northampton, Mass.) and
emotional.

   Some songs are homages to elders like William S. Burroughs,
whose painting adorns the album cover. Others ruefully assess the
legacy of alternative rock. No one era or scene limits Sonic
Youth's focus; the foursome is at its most holistic, mixing punk
focus with compassionate poetic vision. There is room in this
42-minute album for many New Yorks and many Sonic Youths.

`THE BINDING CHAIR': WILLFUL SENSATION YET NOT SOAP OPERA 
</HEADLINE>
   (Editors: Publication notes appear at end of review.)  
 By MICHIKO KAKUTANI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Though Kathryn Harrison's new novel, ``The Binding Chair,''
takes place not in contemporary America but in turn-of-the-century
Shanghai, the book recapitulates many of the themes of her
controversial 1997 memoir, ``The Kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   In this case, foot binding, the old Chinese custom of mutilating
the feet of aristocratic girls, is a kind of metaphor for the child
abuse and incest chronicled by Harrison in that earlier book _ a
metaphor for the sort of childhood trauma that persists throughout
an individual's life, warping emotional reflexes and leaving behind
a permanent sense of otherness and alienation.
</P>
<P>
   The smell of incense and opium wafts lugubriously through the
pages of ``The Binding Chair,'' creating the heavy, sensual
atmosphere of an old-fashioned Gothic. Harrison not only dwells on
the painful ritual of foot binding with almost voyeuristic
fascination, but she also resorts to contrived plot high jinks and
willfully sensational set pieces to move her story along. By book's
end, the corpses have piled up with alarming speed: three people
die by drowning, two by fire, one by torture and countless others
from an epidemic.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for all these melodramatic excesses, ``The Binding Chair''
never devolves into simple soap opera. Harrison writes with such
assurance, such matter-of-fact sympathy for her characters, that
readers are slowly but surely induced to succumb to the spell of
her hothouse world.
</P>
<P>
   As in her last historical novel, ``Poison'' (1995), Harrison
tells the overlapping stories of two women whose lives mirror and
counterpoint each other's. The first woman, May, was born to
privilege and wealth, and her feet were painfully bound when she
was 5. After a nightmarish marriage to a sadistic man, May runs
away to Shanghai, where she spends seven years working in a
brothel. There she meets the man she will marry, a good-natured
do-gooder named Arthur Cohen who invites her into the fold of his
expatriate family.
</P>
<P>
   Just as he believes that his quixotic plans for reform
(registering prostitutes, regulating surgery and inveighing against
pornography) can transform Shanghai into a more humane city, so
Arthur believes that he can save May from her past. After their
only child, Rose, dies in a boating accident, however, May slips
further into her opium habit, escaping into a dream world where
memory can be blurred if not erased.
</P>
<P>
   The second woman to hold center stage in arrison's novel is
May's niece, Alice Benjamin, the daughter of Arthur's high-strung
sister. Alice is a bright, rebellious girl who shares her aunt's
defiance of authority: She gets herself expelled from boarding
school and allows herself to be abducted from a train by a Russian
army engineer. May sees Alice as a substitute for her lost daughter
and tries to adopt Alice as her own, an act that ultimately
estranges the two women.
</P>
<P>
   Cutting back and forth between Alice's story and May's, Harrison
conjures up the vanished world of early-20th-century Shanghai, a
world in which women are brought up to please and service men, a
world in which class and sex determine one's fate. Although May
tries to escape her destiny and though she eventually flees to the
south of France with Arthur's family, her damaged feet are a
constant reminder that she comes ``from another world.'' She is
scornful of Alice's efforts to get her medical help, impatient with
others' efforts to make her fit in. Her one passion becomes
swimming _ an activity where she can ``move unhindered by her
feet,'' travel ``without help, as fast and as gracefully as any
other person.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the people Alice and May cross paths with are a motley
assortment of eccentrics, misfits and fellow outsiders. There's
Captain Litovsky, the Russian engineer who tries to kidnap Alice
during a long train trip across Siberia. There's Suzanne Petrovna,
a penniless translator and editor who flees to the south of France
to escape her abusive father. There's Eleanor Clusburtson, a former
math teacher whose mishap with a false tooth unexpectedly helps
Alice's father corner the lucrative Chinese rubber market.
</P>
<P>
   Though Harrison's orchestration of these people's intersecting
lives is clumsily stage-managed, her evocation of May's life is
persuasive enough to make the reader overlook such missteps.
Indeed, ``The Binding Chair'' ratifies the notion that a gifted
writer can take seemingly lurid subject matter and a tricked-up
plot and transform them through emotional insight and plain old
storytelling verve into an involving work of fiction.  &QL;

   MICROSOFT _ WASHINGTON _To a beset Microsoft Corp, it is the
trial that should be, one that puts top honchos Bill Gates and
Steve Ballmer on the witness stand to show why a corporate breakup
fails to fit its purported antitrust crimes and would likely not
only ruin its business but also set back the New Economy. For
Microsoft critics, it was the trial that should have been, the
moment missed when Gates instead came across in the courtroom on
videotape as an ignorant lout. But for judge who tried the case,
now ready to bring down a heavy hammer on the software giant, it is
a trial too far. And on this issue he's got the final word. (Glass,

WHEN IDEAS TOOK SHAPE AND SOARED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., Italy, Germany, France, Britain, Russia and the
Netherlands)   By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Speaking at a symposium held at UCLA in January,
the historian Anthony Vidler announced, ``All architecture is the
result of panic.'' Panic has broken out with particularly vivid
style in ``The Triumph of the Baroque,'' now on view at the
National Gallery of Art. A survey of European architecture from
1600 to 1750, the show reveals that buildings, like people, can be
overtaken by mass hysteria. For a century and a half, European
walls, doors, roofs, windows and entire cities were contorted into
quivering, writhing shapes.
</P>
<P>
   Organized by Henry A. Millon of the National Gallery along with
Guy Cogeval, Paolo Viti and Marie-Paule Vial, the show documents
the histrionics of Baroque architecture with about 100 artifacts,
including antique wooden models and period paintings of buildings,
gardens and urban vistas. Besides representing a style, the show
explores a state of mind. Simultaneously embodying fight and
flight, Baroque buildings look eager to escape the very reality
they wish to dominate.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Triumph of the Baroque'' can be seen as a sequel to the
National Gallery's 1994 exhibition on Renaissance architecture,
which also featured large wooden models as its star attractions. In
Chapter 1 the models resembled Trojan horses: as expressions of
humanism, Renaissance churches and palaces subverted the authority
of the feudal institutions they were commissioned to glorify. In
Chapter 2 the subversion grows more complex.
</P>
<P>
   Baroque architecture was a theatrical art. Here's how history
set the stage: by 1600 all the instruments that would eventually
topple absolute authority came into play, but absolutism
concentrated ever greater power unto itself. Martin Luther's tracts
against the church, published in 1520, were best sellers. They were
significant not only because of their content, but because they
demonstrated the power of the press as well. Ideas could now be
easily circulated. In 1600 Descartes proposed his solution to
existence, a philosophical formula that predicated reality on the
capacity to doubt. Oh, and by the way, the Earth was no longer the
center of the universe.
</P>
<P>
   The word baroque, originally applied to architecture in a
pejorative sense, means irregular or misshapen. The show invites us
to watch absolutism become literally bent out of shape. The
Counter-Reformation granted people the right to question dogma,
provided they ultimately submitted to the church. The Baroque style
gave architects liberty to pursue infinite formal variations,
provided that they ultimately submitted to Classicism. ``The
Triumph of the Baroque'' offers a broad sampling of the results.
</P>
<P>
   The show is organized thematically. Designs from Italy, Germany,
France, Britain, Russia and the Netherlands are grouped into
sections on ecclesiastical, royal, military and commercial
buildings. Besides emphasizing the international reach of the
Baroque, this arrangement conveys the extent to which feudal
institutions had evolved toward the modern corporate culture. Call
it Baroque Inc.: travel specialists for the rich and holy, with an
array of services provided by church and state.
</P>
<P>
   The show starts (like Anita Ekberg) with a plunge into the Trevi
Fountain in Rome, a stellar tourist attraction that introduces two
themes coursing throughout the show: theatricality and psychology.
A precisely detailed wood-and-plaster model highlights the
fountain's theatrical dimension, for it depicts the palace facade,
sans palace, designed by Nicola Salvi for the Trevi's magnificent
sculptural tableau.
</P>
<P>
   Since the model does not include water, visitors will have to
imagine the Trevi's psychological dimension, or read Eleanor
Clark's 1950 book ``Rome and a Villa.'' Clark's chapter on Rome's
fountains may well be the finest depiction of the Baroque's
emotional atmosphere ever written. ``You walk close to your
dreams,'' she begins. ``In another minute, people in the crowd will
all be naked, or will have fish tails or horses' behinds, like the
characters in the fountains. . . . This is the vocabulary of our
sleep, and the key image is always water.''
</P>
<P>
   The fountains are pieces of urban infrastructure as well as
incentives to free association. Fusions of art and technology, they
bring the rational and the irrational together at the center of
public space. Bernini's Four Rivers fountain in the Piazza Navona,
also represented by models and paintings, shows that these
waterworks were political emanations as well. The fountain
advertised the relocation of the local water supply to the pope's
family palace.
</P>
<P>
   It is bizarre to move from this Mediterranean atmosphere toward
the gilded dome resembling Chinese bells that crowns St. Isaac's
Cathedral in St. Petersburg, but models of Russian Baroque
buildings are a highlight of this show. This is one of the first
occasions in which the Russian Baroque has been presented in a
European context. Millon says that Russian curators have been
besieged in the last decade with requests for material on
Constructivist design while models of Baroque buildings have
gathered dust.
</P>
<P>
   A model of Smolny Convent in St. Petersburg is the most
extraordinary of the Russian treasures. Designed from 1750 to 1756
by Francesco Bartolomeo Rastrelli, architect of the Winter Palace
and other St. Petersburg landmarks, the complex is a cross-axial
composition with a cathedral at the center, flanked by four smaller
chapels. Rastrelli's palette of gold, celestial blue and white, and
the repeating bays of his facades will put some viewers in mind of
Balanchine's ``Ballet Imperial,'' with its star ballerina, soloists
and precisely drilled corps.
</P>
<P>
   An enfilade of royal residences dominates the Baroque show's
second-floor galleries. The great palace of Caserta, court of the
Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, is the finest example of these.
</P>
<P>
   Designed by Luigi Vantivelli from 1756 to 1769, the project
induces a dreamlike state without recourse to water. The gentle
incline of Caserta's grand staircase, the use of indirect lighting,
the twisted pattern of the coffering within the building's domes
induce the sensation of suspended gravity. This is Piranesian
space, awesome and relentless. In comparison Versailles resembles a
poorly planned suburban mall.
</P>
<P>
   Gothic spires are for the soul, Renaissance domes for the mind,
Baroque facades for the senses. But there is no telling where
emotion, once aroused, will be directed. The most horrifying object
in the show is a model of the Great Kremlin Palace. Designed for
Catherine the Great by Vasily Ivanovich Bazhenov in 1769-70, this
is a vast dominatrix of a building, encircled by stones that
resemble the studs on a sadist's belt.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Psychological manipulation has a tendency to backfire. How long
would it take before people began to wonder what kind of sovereign
would want to appear in public dressed like a Mistress of Pain? Or
what kind of saint would want to recline in ecstasy on an altar,
like Bernini's sculpture of St. Teresa? In time the Baroque
emphasis on psychology would invite the public to question external
authority in all its forms. It would accelerate the modernity it
sought to retard.
</P>
<P>
   As Christian Norberg-Schulz remarks in the show's excellent
catalog, the Baroque era was a time of choices. People could choose
a different faith, a different occupation, or they could quit
Europe altogether. It was, that is to say, a time of competition,
an era that heralded the rise of the consumer and of the arts
dedicated to persuading consumers to make a particular choice.
</P>
<P>
   With Baroque architecture, space itself becomes a consumer
product. In a recent conversation Vidler observed that the
distorted forms and urban scale of the Baroque register the anxiety
that came with the collapse of the distinct boundaries that once
surrounded cities. The erosion of medieval fortifications and the
rise of new modes of transportation went far toward undermining the
traditional sense of place. Baroque spectacle helped to compensate
for the loss.
</P>
<P>
   Millon is correct to suggest that this show will hold special
appeal for a generation now preoccupied with computer morphing.
Scrolls; spiral columns; trompe l'oeil ceilings that extend
physical architecture into the firmament of heavenly illusion;
gilded wave crests; cornices folded and refolded to distraction;
facades drawn out horizontally to the vanishing point; arches,
saints and topiary endlessly repeated as if produced by a
malfunctioning keyboard: such devices easily outstrip most of what
I have seen on the monitor screens of today's design studios. They
should give pause to those who think that computer-generated,
so-called blob architecture has no place in the old
bricks-and-mortar world.
</P>
<P>
   The affinity between the Baroque age and our own, however, goes
deeper than the formal complexity common to both. We, too, have a
complicated relationship to power. In a sense it is the reverse of
the predicament in which church and state found themselves in the
17th century. Modern consumer society is committed to a way of life
that is constantly corroding authority and its traditional
institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is this more evident than in our museums, and in the
increasing difficulty with which they seek to maintain a balance
between scholarship and entertainment, connoisseurship and
popularity. The Bilbao branch of the Guggenheim is merely the most
prominent in a vast proliferation of museum buildings designed in
part as pilgrimage destinations to lure tourist dollars. As such,
they are part of the corporate monoculture that many artists want
to resist.
</P>
<P>
   The Guggenheim's serpentine steel skin and the Piranesian
Turbine Hall of the new Tate Modern in London are formally quite
different, but both are innately Baroque in their appeal to the
emotions and in their ambition to set culture apart from commerce.
Yet they also stand for the increasing importance of culture in the
emerging global economy.
</P>
<P>
   Still, I came away from this show convinced that we need more
museums, larger museums, better-financed museums, particularly in
the United States. The National Gallery show, sponsored by EduCap
Inc., presents only one-fourth of an exhibition originally
presented in Turin, Italy. I'm glad I didn't catch it there. The
National Gallery's 1994 Renaissance show was truncated, too, and
after seeing the complete edition at the Palazzo Grassi in Venice,
I found the abbreviated version a thorough letdown.
</P>
<P>
   A Baroque show four times the size might prove daunting for many
visitors. But then the point of this style was to overwhelm the
viewer. How amazing it would be to feel overwhelmed by it in the
nation's capital. The Baroque is everything Americans came here to
escape. And where can we go to flee the Baroque contortions of our
day?

   NEW YORK _ I vey-divey, as Lester Young would have said. June is
almost upon us, and as usual, jazz clubs, independent concert
producers and the big jazz festivals _ there are now three _ are
wrangling for the attention of New Yorkers. This means an
astonishing bounty for anyone interested in jazz (with Latin music,
gospel and soul as connected satellite genres, in the tradition of
the big festivals). There's no choice but to see it as one big
unofficial citywide festival, the best and most complete in the
world.
</P>
<P>
   The Vision Festival, now in its fifth year, has been an
unexpected success, marshaling various strands of jazz bohemianism
into an 11-day series with the air of a community effort much more
than of a business venture. The Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival,
presided over by Michael Dorf, was once a midget slinging pebbles
from the cultural margins, but it has become the great enveloper,
taking up much of the burden of presenting jazz from all subgenres
and ingeniously marketing it on the Internet and its Knitting
Factory record label; this year's edition features more outdoor
events, many of them gigantic bills and some of them free. (This is
a positive development: it will help New Yorkers return to the
notion of festivals as something fun that spills all over a public
space, rather than self-contained, wallet-chewing affairs.)
</P>
<P>
   The JVC Jazz Festival, led by George Wein, has refined its
formula of the concert as major event to the point that more and
more of its bookings are closely modeled on successful shows from
earlier years; on the other hand, as an interesting turn, its
Symphony Space series is full of artists who were yesterday's
downtown rebels.
</P>
<P>
   To curb your frustration over the too-much blues, here's a list
of recommendations for the end of May and the month of June in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   FRIDAY NIGHT: Vision Festival, New Age Cabaret. The fifth annual
Vision Festival, which brings together much that lies on the wilder
shores of jazz and improvised music, continues through the weekend.
Friday night's program features the Michele Rosewoman Quintet, a
strong mainstream jazz project led by a New York musician who has
long been ahead of the curve with jazz's new rhythmic developments.
There's a trio with the alto saxophonist Rob Brown, the drummer
Hamid Drake and the violinist Mat Maneri, three of the most
talented musicians playing in the avant-garde. Kidd Jordan, New
Orleans saxophonist, is to share a quartet with the drummer Alvin
Fielder, who hasn't been heard much since the '80s; the adventurous
clarinetist Perry Robinson, in a quartet; and one of the festival
favorites, the quintessential, tear-the-walls-down ensemble called
Other Dimensions in Music.
</P>
<P>
   SATURDAY
</P>
<P>
   WYCLIFFE GORDON QUINTET, Village Vanguard. Some of the best
musicians make instruments seem small in their hands. The
trombonist Wycliffe Gordon is one of those; in almost every Lincoln
Center Jazz Orchestra concert, it is guaranteed that he will play
something _ maybe only a detail, not always a full-fledged
improvisation _ with such extraordinary deftness that he wins over
the audience completely. On one level, his band is as straight as
it gets: It's Ellington- and Basie-inspired, suitable for all ages.
But Gordon's manipulations of sound in his careful improvisations
(he is armed with several kinds of mutes) are as exciting as it
gets.
</P>
<P>
   MONDAY
</P>
<P>
   GUILLERMO KLEIN AND LOS GUACHOS, Jazz Standard. Klein, from
Argentina, has a broad view of what can be accomplished by a big
band; traces of Hermeto Pascoal, Steve Reich and Kenny Wheeler
filter through his music, and he achieves a choral effect in his
broad saxophone section. It's brilliant, colorful stuff, whispered
about hotly among musicians; after years of sporadic gigs, this
regular Monday night engagement at the Jazz Standard may prove to
be an important booking for one of the decade's most promising
young artists.
</P>
<P>
   TUESDAY
</P>
<P>
   ERIC REED'S NEW YORK SEVEN, Village Vanguard. After years of
playing in a trio, it was great to see the young pianist Eric Reed
busy himself with some larger-scale arrangements last year. And the
band, more so than is represented on his records, is actually a
band: a fearsome one with a particularly swinging rhythm section,
boasting the bassist Barak Mori and the young wonder drummer Rodney
Green.
</P>
<P>
   WEDNESDAY
</P>
<P>
   PAT MARTINO HIP-BOP TRIO, Iridium. Martino is one of jazz's
finest guitarists, with a limpid sound and a subtle mode of
expression. But he still likes to play in the earthy, funky context
he began with the 1960s in Philadelphia. His new trio includes
Larry Goldings, an organist, and a drummer, Idris Muhammad, one of
the funkiest players alive.
</P>
<P>
   THURSDAY
</P>
<P>
   ORNETTE COLEMAN, Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, the Lawn, Battery
Park. This compressed display of Coleman's abilities has three
parts: ``Freedom Symbol,'' a composition for a 20-piece classical
chamber ensemble with a cadenza for each performer, which dates to
1989; it was performed at Alice Tully Hall several years ago, but
because of the nature of Coleman's art, it's quite different each
time. Then there's a performance by Global Expression Project,
which puts Coleman, the bassist Charnett Moffett and the drummer
Denardo Coleman in the context of three Indian percussionists; and
finally the Ornette Coleman Trio, with Charlie Haden and Billy
Higgins. These three _ usually with a fourth member, but no matter
_ have produced some of the most important music in the second half
of the 20th century. As they have proved in recent years, they're
still capable of making time stop.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   NEXT FRIDAY
</P>
<P>
   CHARLIE HADEN'S QUARTET WEST WITH STRING ORCHESTRA, the Angel
Orensanz Foundation. The foundation, a beautiful, crumbling
synagogue on the Lower East Side, will be the co-star of this
concert. Never having heard a full orchestra fill its great space,
I can only imagine that Haden's romance-drenched love letters to
the 1940s and '50s might find their sweet spot there.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 3
</P>
<P>
   URI CAINE'S GOLDBERG VARIATIONS, Jazz Standard. Caine's
``Goldberg Variations'' album, to be released in June on Winter &AMP;
Winter, is the latest installment in this pianist's continuing
series of rather ingenious takes on classical music. Here he takes
several dozen of Bach's ``Goldberg'' Variations and reinterprets
them with the help of singers, a swinging clarinet, a D.J. and
others. The performed version is not your everyday club gig; it
ends a week at the club for Caine, preceded by his jazz trio and
his radical Gustav Mahler project.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 4
</P>
<P>
   MAX ROACH AND CECIL TAYLOR, Columbia University Steps. At Town
Hall in 1989, the last time Roach and Taylor played together in the
United States, their duet was one of the best shows I had ever
seen: full of each musician's usual patterns yet they found common
ground. Opening this concert is the rough-and-ready David S. Ware
Quartet, which has mellowed a little, judging from its new record,
``Surrendered'' (Columbia/Sony); a duet by the drummer Joey Baron
and the bassist Ron Carter; and Bob Stewart leading the LaGuardia
High School Jazz Band, a surprisingly mighty ensemble of
teen-agers.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 5
</P>
<P>
   ROSWELL RUDD AND BROAD STROKES, Bell Atlantic Festival, Knitting
Factory. The rehabilitation of the trombonist Roswell Rudd's career
in the last few years has resulted in some unforgettable local
performances: with the reunited New York Art Quartet last summer
and with Sonic Youth at the Church of St. Ann and the Holy Trinity
in Brooklyn Heights last winter, a show so good that even after
many minutes of Rudd's yawped declamations over the rock band's
ringing drones, you still wanted more. Here it is: Rudd's new
12-piece band Broad Strokes (can it really have three vocalists, as
advertised?) will be joined by three-quarters of Sonic Youth.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 6
</P>
<P>
   GREG OSBY QUINTET, Bell Atlantic Festival, Knitting Factory.
This is a band that keeps getting better; if you want to hear the
future of jazz as art, look here. Osby, the saxophonist, plays
thin, pinpointed lines over a fluctuating rhythm section, the band
improvises its form onstage and the leader's connection with the
pianist Jason Moran has become one of the great partnerships in the
recent history of the music. If you've experienced Osby on record
as a little dry, see what happens when the band loosens up onstage.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 7
</P>
<P>
   TIM BERNE, Bell Atlantic Festival, Knitting Factory. The
saxophonist is focused and voluminous; the four different bands he
is showing in one night aren't so much different personalities as
different mouthpieces for his brand of sprawling, contracting and
expanding, odd-meter music. Paraphrase and Big Satan are familiar
trios, but the next two groups, Quicksand and Composure, promise a
slightly different palette, with the involvement of the pianist
Craig Taborn; it's hard to remember the last time Berne played
alongside any kind of keyboards.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 8
</P>
<P>
   MATTHEW SHIPP STRING TRIO, Knitting Factory. The boundary
between composition and improvisation is never blurrier than with
Shipp, the pianist, and his trio of piano, bass and violin; I had
heard the band's dark, slow, sweeping, abstract and volatile music
quite a bit on record and was still taken aback to hear it
replicate long album tracks pretty much as I remembered them. Then,
head over to the Blue Note to hear the outgoing, excitable
saxophonist.
</P>
<P>
   JAMES CARTER, Knitting Factory. From a different end of the
entertainment spectrum, Carter will be playing selections from a
rocking new record, ``Layin' In the Cut'' (Atlantic), which treats
the avant-funk of the early '80s _ the James Blood
Ulmer/Jamaaladeen Tacuma school _ as sacred texts. It's
exhilarating music and a good interpretive idea.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 9
</P>
<P>
   ``AS LONG AS YOU'RE LIVING YOURS'': THE MUSIC OF KEITH JARRETT,
Jazz Standard. This gig, timed to an RCA record release of the same
name, isn't a bad idea because Jarrett's impressionistic written
music gets short shrift in deference to his stature as a soloist.
The band looks tempting, including the saxophonists George Garzone
and Jimmy Greene and the drummer Billy Kilson, one of the sparks of
Dave Holland's great new band.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 10
</P>
<P>
   ROY HAYNES TRIO, Birdland. It sounds like a cliche, but at 75,
Haynes isn't slowing down: he's still the razor-sharp dresser,
master rhythm-displacer and loud snare-drum hitter he was in the
bebop days. He's so naturally modern it hurts, and his new record,
``The Roy Haynes Trio'' (Verve/Universal), with Danilo Perez and
John Patitucci, is a challenge to rhythm sections everywhere.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 11
</P>
<P>
   LOS LOBOS, LOS VAN VAN, BARBARITO TORRES, DAVID SANCHEZ SEXTET,
BOBBY SANABRIA Y ASCENSION, Bell Atlantic Jazz Festival, Austin J.
Tobin Plaza, World Trade Center. Maybe it's only marginally jazz,
but what a wild bill, predicated only on improvisation, the Spanish
language and musical excellence. The Cal-Mex band Los Lobos seems
to have been around forever, and it may still be the best rock band
in America. The Cuban group Los Van Van could take the title of
best dance band in the world. Barbarito Torres' old, elegant style
on the lutelike laud is known to all followers of the Buena Vista
phenomenon. David Sanchez, from Puerto Rico, is a superior jazz
player, whether he's using the rhythms and forms of his island or
not. The percussionist Bobby Sanabria draws on some of the best of
the jazz and Latin players in New York for his octet.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 14
</P>
<P>
   JVC TRIBUTE TO CHARLIE BYRD AND GEORGE VAN EPS, JVC Jazz
Festival, Kaye Playhouse. Plenty of festival tributes are about
love, respect and homage but tributes to guitar players inspire
more than that. JVC festival's annual guitar-a-thon concerts,
produced by Charles Carlini, tend toward flat-out obsession. The
long parade of guitarists who come out to play a few numbers can
seem a little daunting on paper, but these concerts build up a
rhythm of their own and the bated breath of guitar-players in the
audience gives these events a peculiar urgency. On the bill: the
rhythmically muscular Ron Affif, the quiet-as-a-mouse Gene
Bertoncini and the fluid utility players Howard Alden and Frank
Vignola as well as Bucky Pizzarelli, Mark Whitfield and others.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 16
</P>
<P>
   JOAO GILBERTO, JVC Jazz Festival, Carnegie Hall. Early this
year, Gilberto, the bossa nova originator, put out a new record,
``Joao Voz e Violao''; he has been both reviled for it (by those
who wish he would record some new songs) and praised for it. You
can't help liking the voice deepened with age and the Swiss-watch
sense of rhythm negotiated between his guitar and his singing, with
no orchestrations to get in the way. But the album, to be released
in the United States in June, is close to what he delivered two
years ago at a similar Carnegie Hall concert, which was
extraordinary. Most of us would settle for a replica. If you
haven't seen him before, go.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 17
</P>
<P>
   PETER BROETZMANN TENTET, Hammerstein Ballroom. In the last
decade, Broetzmann, the German saxophonist, has become something of
a father figure for American free-jazz musicians, especially in
Chicago, where the jazz bohemians are studious and organized and
win MacArthur prizes. His Tentet, filled with the cream of the
Chicago out-jazz scene, leans toward written arrangements _ a good
thing for Broetzmann, whose bellowing tone could rip a hole in the
wall and who has more musicality than he often lets on. (At the
Ballroom, he is opening for Sonic Youth.)
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 18
</P>
<P>
   JOHN LURIE AND THE LOUNGE LIZARDS, JVC Jazz Festival, Symphony
Space. It's the 20th-anniversary concert for a band that nobody,
initially, could have predicted would last. The band has come so
far from the jokey, awkward ``fake jazz'' it started out with that
you need to revise your opinion, if you heard it then and haven't
paid attention since. In the new Lounge Lizards, African and Asian
music sits comfortably with good old American humor and pathos, and
sometimes the band will play something so richly Ellingtonian that
even Wynton Marsalis would approve.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 20
</P>
<P>
   RUBEN BLADES, JVC Jazz Festival, Carnegie Hall. One of the great
singers and lyricists in popular music, Blades since the early '70s
has combined political acuity with a strong, communicative musical
enthusiasm; he doesn't condescend to his audiences by
overmoralizing when he sings about political issues. His latest
record, ``Tiempos'' (Sony Discos), recorded with a new young band
called Editus, combines all kinds of music from South America into
a coherent whole. Opening is Orquesta Aragon, the Cuban charanga
band whose dynastic history dates to the late 1930s.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 21
</P>
<P>
   ELVIN JONES AND CECIL TAYLOR, Blue Note. Jones, the drummer, and
Taylor, the pianist, played a duet at the Blue Note last winter,
and its subtleties were striking: Jones used mallets for almost the
entire set I caught. It's nice to see this relationship worked out
in the more casual atmosphere of a jazz club rather than the
one-time-only big-ticket hoopla of the festivals and their second
time around will be worth another visit.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 22
</P>
<P>
   ``FROM SPIRITUALS TO SWING,'' JVC Jazz Festival, Carnegie Hall.
This concert honors the famous 1938 and 1939 Carnegie Hall concerts
produced by John Hammond (the recorded version has just been
reissued on Vanguard) that brought together Count Basie's big-band
swing, boogie-woogie and stride piano from Meade Lux Lewis and
James P. Johnson, and the sanctified harmonies of the Golden Gate
Quartet. In the even more eclectic year 2000 version, the
participants include the present version of the Basie orchestra;
the singers Dianne Reeves and Angelique Kidjo; the New Orleans
patriarch Allen Toussaint; and Harlem's ecstatic, trombone-heavy
shout band, the McCollough Sons of Thunder.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 23
</P>
<P>
   CASSANDRA WILSON AND CESARIA EVORA, JVC Jazz Festival, Carnegie
Hall. Here's a double bill that makes sense. Putting Wilson's
recent music up against true-blue jazz singers always has always
created an imbalance and causes headaches as listeners wonder if
her artful, chanteusy, folk-Americana is jazz or not. Evora, the
charismatic morna singer from Cape Verde, strikes much closer to
the cloudy-day emotional territory that Wilson aims for.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 24
</P>
<P>
   ARETHA FRANKLIN, JVC Jazz Festival, Avery Fisher Hall. Franklin
is still a house-wrecker, and a performer so imposing that her mood
is easily transmitted to her audience. If she's happy or
frustrated, it becomes part of the performance and you're taken up
in it _ which is what performances ought to do anyway.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 25
</P>
<P>
   BRIAN BLADE FELLOWSHIP, Village Vanguard. Blade, a former
sideman for Joshua Redman and one of the greatest drummers to have
come along in the last decade of American music, writes music for
an expanded small group that doesn't sound like anything in jazz.
It's sentimental, sometimes slightly hymnlike music, arranged for a
steel guitar and two saxophones; it's a bit cinematic, but for a
very private, interior sort of movie.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 27
</P>
<P>
   MILTON NASCIMENTO, Beacon Theater. As generations of new
listeners keep discovering treasure-trove records like ``Clube da
Esquina'' (Blue Note/Capitol) Nascimento's small but committed
American audience has grown beyond the jazz world that first
accepted him in the '70s. Back from a period of illness, he still
has the voice, with that almost religious quality of purity and its
rich emotional currents.
</P>
<P>
   JUNE 29
</P>
<P>
   HAPPY APPLE, Tonic. This trio from Minneapolis plays jazz as if
it doesn't have any hangups about what anybody's going to call it.
Among its quirks are an electric bassist who has not been
particularly influenced by Jaco Pastorious, and a general subtext
of indie-rock subversion.

&HT;     OVERCOMING TRACK TRAGEDY, WATTLES RETURNS TO RACING 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By LEE SCHEIDE  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The battles have always been from within for Stan
Wattles, growing up with dyslexia, dysgraphia and perception
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, however, prepared him for May 1, 1999, and the depths
to which he would have to plunge to soothe his soul.
</P>
<P>
   Competing in the Indy Racing League event at Charlotte, N.C.,
Wattles hit the wall in Turn 4. His car broke up, by design, to
absorb most of the energy from the crash. Wattles walked away from
the crash, unscathed.
</P>
<P>
   In the stands, however, fans were not as fortunate.
</P>
<P>
   As a tire from Wattles' car bounced down the track after the
incident, it was struck by another car and launched into the crowd,
killing three people and seriously injuring several more.
</P>
<P>
   The race was canceled and, for all intents and purposes, so was
Wattles' racing career. He continued to the next race, the
Indianapolis 500, but his heart and mind weren't completely focused
on the task at hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the risks you take as a racecar driver when you get
behind the wheel of a car,'' Wattles said. ``Someone coming to
watch the race shouldn't have to fear getting hurt or worse while
they are there. It was the worst thing that has ever happened to
me, and I lost my desire, my drive, my passion to get into a
racecar. I was here during Indy last year, but I wasn't really here
the way I needed to be, and that hurt the entire program.''
</P>
<P>
   Wattles, 38, knew that continuing to think about the accident in
Charlotte wasn't going to help him on the racetrack. So he pulled
out of the fast lane, shutting down his team's operation and almost
shutting down himself as he looked for answers to the questions
that continually swarmed in his head.
</P>
<P>
   He and his wife, Jill, spent many hours discussing the accident.
But in the end, Wattles knew that any healing had to come from
within. So the personable driver fell back on something that helped
him through his tough educational situations as an adolescent:
martial arts.
</P>
<P>
   Using the meditation techniques learned long ago, Wattles, a
black belt in tae kwan do, began the therapeutic process.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to heal the outside, I had to heal the inside
first,'' Wattles said. ``My wife and I had some long talks about
racing and the injuries, everything. Racing had been such a passion
for me, and after Charlotte, I didn't want anything to do with
racing. I just wanted to get away and start healing.''
</P>
<P>
   While off the track, Wattles found another healing outlet in his
children. Because his business, Metro Racing Systems, kept him on
the move, he hadn't enjoyed the quality time that he wanted with
his family. That all changed after the tragedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was great to know that they were there for me when I needed
them,'' Wattles said. ``I had a pretty hectic schedule, with
business and racing, and they kind of took a back seat to all of
the that. The past year, I've spent so much more quality time with
my family, and that's what I want to continue to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Another thing Wattles found he wanted to continue, after several
months of soul searching, was his racing career.
</P>
<P>
   But he didn't want the burden of being the team owner and making
sure all the small, logistical details were worked out. All Wattles
wanted to do was show up and drive.
</P>
<P>
   He got that chance, driving in some World Sports Car events last
summer. Just getting to the track was a victory for Wattles, while
getting behind the wheel proved to be the catharsis he needed.
</P>
<P>
   With each passing lap, he could feel his passion for racing
being rekindled.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, when his cousin, Greg Wattles, came back from the
Indy Racing League opener in January and asked if he was ready to
do this again, Stan Wattles was receptive to the idea of driving
again.
</P>
<P>
   After months of planning, buying cars and putting all the wheels
in motion, Wattles and the rest of his team rolled through the
gates of Gasoline Alley earlier this month, having come full circle
in dedication and desire.
</P>
<P>
   Wattles proved that by going out and qualifying at more than 220
mph. He will start Sunday's 84th Indianapolis 500 between Jimmy
Vasser and Robbie Buhl.
</P>
<P>
   And he knows just how lucky he is to be back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never, in a million years, thought that I would be back
racing at Indianapolis Motor Speedway,'' Wattles said. ``When we
came back through the gates, everything about last year seemed to
slip away, and I was focused, really focused on doing a better job
this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget what happened in Charlotte, but I know that
it was an accident, out of my control. But it's time to move on,
and this is part of that process for me as a racecar driver, coming
to the Indy 500 and racing the best in the world.''

PRESIDENT SUGGESTS THAT RUNOFF ELECTIONS MAY BE POSTPONED 
</HEADLINE>
   By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ President Alberto Fujimori is strongly hinting that
the runoff presidential election scheduled for Sunday will be
postponed at the last moment to satisfy foreign critics who say the
political process has been tainted by an array of irregularities
and fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``The possibility for an adjustment of the election date
exists,'' Fujimori said in an interview late Wednesday night in the
government palace. ``We are in a fluctuating situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori's conciliatory comments contrasted sharply with his
public statements earlier this week in which he rejected calls by
the Clinton administration, the Organization of American States and
several European and Latin American governments that the election
be put off several weeks so independent monitors had time to
inspect computer software designed to count presidential ballots.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral crisis had been gathering momentum since Alejandro
Toledo, the opposition candidate, dropped out of the race last
Thursday saying there was no reason for him to compete in a
fraudulent election. He said he would re-enter the contest if it
were postponed by several weeks with guarantees for a free vote. A
wave of strikes and street demonstrations followed, and Fujimori
was forced to duck eggs and fruit thrown at him while he made a
speech in the city of Arequipa before a national television
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The demonstrations peaked Thursday and grew increasingly
violent. A small group of protesters attacked the offices of the
National Elections Commission, the highest government body that
supervises the elections, and broke windows and damaged a door with
rocks, pipes and at least one molotov cocktail. Scores of people
were arrested in the northern jungle city of Iquitos for blocking
roads, and the police used tear gas to clear protesters gathering
in front of the government palace in the capital. Truck drivers and
teachers staged a strike in the Andean city of Cuzco, a Toledo
stronghold.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a growing number of influential businessmen have
warned that holding an uncontested election on Sunday could mean
years of economic sanctions and tensions with Washington that could
impede investment and growth. Their arguments were strengthened
through the week as Peruvian bond and stock prices dropped sharply,
the currency came under sudden pressure and foreign financial
institutions issued risk warnings that threatened to increase
interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori was careful to say that the final decision of whether
the election will take place Sunday is in the hands of the National
Elections Commission, but he left little doubt of where he stood.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking of the international community, Fujimori said: ``They
are looking for a signal of flexibility. OK. If the National
Elections Commission wants a change of date, it's convenient for
me.'' He added that the five-member panel, over which he has strong
influence, would probably make its decision on Friday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Fujimori's appeasing remarks were matched Thursday by
Eduardo Stein, the head of the Organization of American States
election observation team, who has been a strong critic of the
government's handling of the campaign and vote count in the April 9
first-round balloting. The former Guatemalan foreign minister gave
a cautious endorsement of a computer test
</P>
<P>
   conducted by Peruvian election authorities Wednesday night,
raising expectations that a clean vote count is possible.
</P>
<P>
   But Stein said he still wanted the election to be postponed so
that his technicians had ample time to review the computer vote-
counting software.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days there have been mixed signals about the Fujimori
government's intentions to loosen controls over an election process
that critics say has so far been tilted in Fujimori's favor.
Several television stations allied with the government have begun
broadcasting Toledo commercials and coverage of his rallies, while
tabloid newspapers thought to be directed by Fujimori's
intelligence service have softened their negative coverage of
Toledo's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, three unidentified men on Wednesday night broke
into the offices of an opposition journalist said to hold
incriminating videotapes of Vladimiro Montesinos, Fujimori's
intelligence chief, meeting with election officials. The
journalist, Fabian Salazar, said the burglars tied him up and
tortured him as they demanded that he reveal his sources within the
intelligence service who gave him copies of the tapes, which
apparently were made by Montesinos himself.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said they cut through his left wrist to the bone with a
saw during their questioning. He was hospitalized after his
videotapes, archives and computer discs were stolen. Human rights
activists said Salazar's descriptions of his ordeal, which were
verified by doctors, may represent the worst example of torture in
Peru in at least two years.

 &HT;    Stars make `Shanghai Noon' a western with real kick
 &HT;    By Alison Macor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ East meets West in the pleasantly silly
action-comedy ``Shanghai Noon.'' Affable kung fu master Jackie Chan
buddies up to the equally appealing Owen Wilson (``The Minus Man,''
``Armageddon''), and the rather unlikely combination works like a
dream.
</P>
<P>
   Like some of Chan's movies, ``Shanghai Noon's'' kooky plot takes
a back seat to the multitalented actor's awesome stunt work and coy
comedic sense. The film also gets a big boost from Chan and
Wilson's low-key on-screen camaraderie, and ``Shanghai Noon's''
outtakes _ Chan's delightful version of Hitchcock's on-screen
cameos _ reveal that their fun spilled over behind the camera, too.
</P>
<P>
   Set in 1881, ``Shanghai Noon'' begins in the Forbidden City,
where Chan serves as humble Imperial Guard Chon Wang. When the
emperor's feisty daughter, Princess Pei Pei (``Ally McBeal's'' Lucy
Liu), is spirited away to the States by her American tutor, the
lovesick Chon Wang volunteers to rescue the princess from a bleak
future of indentured servitude to an exiled guard (Xander Berkeley)
presiding over a Chinese work camp in Carson City, Nev.
</P>
<P>
   This introductory bit of business sets up a cute exchange
between Chan and Liu, and the trip west provides some predictably
funny culture clashes. But the real entertainment begins when
Wilson's hunky, easygoing outlaw Roy O'Bannon reluctantly takes
Chon Wang under his wing as he searches for the princess.
</P>
<P>
   Roy introduces Chon Wang to his unexpectedly Zen approach to
living outside the law, and in return Chon Wang teaches Roy a thing
or two about honor.
</P>
<P>
   While ``Shanghai Noon'' amply showcases Chan's physical prowess,
an extended montage in which Roy tries to woo Chon Wang's Native
American wife _ don't ask _ is a particularly clever use of
Wilson's languorous charm.
</P>
<P>
   Although we don't necessarily watch a Jackie Chan movie for its
riveting story, the plots aren't always as annoyingly intrusive as
in ``Shanghai Noon.'' Tom Dey's direction works best when it allows
Chan and Wilson's comedy to take center stage and uses the movie's
period setting as mere background detail. A particularly drawn out
finale tests our endurance, but the promise of those outtakes is
reason enough to stick around.

<P>
   HERZILYA, Israel _ For Hanan Achsaf, president of Motorola
Israel Ltd., the country's occasional ``minor disagreements with
its neighbors'' are not enough to blunt the business attraction of
its brain power.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has worked for Motorola. The company came here first in
the 1960s with an investment of less than $20 million and now
controls assets worth more than $20 billion and 4,100 workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company's semiconductor design center, with 600 workers in
this suburb of Tel Aviv, is its largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Over the last two years, Israel has become famous for its boom
in software start-up companies. But, Motorola is one of about a
dozen major U.S. firms that have invested here to make or develop
microprocessors, or chips _ the hardware brains to computers,
cellular phones and even anti-lock brakes.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, despite a worrisome shortage of engineers to feed such
growth, the list of firms with development centers here reads like
a hi-tech Who's Who: Intel, which has two manufacturing plants
here; along with Texas Instruments; National Semiconductor; IBM;
3COM and Microsoft. Applied Materials, developing and producing
equipment for semiconductor makers, came here in 1991 and now
employs 650 in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   It's a good match. Israel, a country of about 6 million people,
has little natural resources _ no oil like its Arab neighbors. It
has few markets available on its borders, either because its
neighbors are hostile or have small economies.
</P>
<P>
   What it can do is produce knowledge and that's what draws the
big chip firms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a combination of things that come from being a country
where existential problems are permanent,'' said Orna Berry, who,
until she stepped down this month, oversaw government support for
hi-tech development as Israel's chief scientist.
</P>
<P>
   Berry sees Israel's battles for survival and need to look for
support beyond its own region as helping foster the boom. Israeli
hi-tech workers are considered innovative, competitive and
hardworking. Though Israel's first language is Hebrew, English, the
first language of technology, is commonly spoken.
</P>
<P>
   And, most Israelis have to spend at least a couple of years in
their lives in what has become a hi-tech incubator _ the army.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the army, you have been exposed to the most sophisticated
technology,'' said Achsaf, once an instructor in the air force's
technical school. The army even has a so-called ``genius unit,'' a
special intelligence branch specializing in hi-tech.
</P>
<P>
   The government also kicks in its share, giving about $400
million in grants to industry _ mostly hi-tech _ each year. It gave
Intel $600 million to build a semiconductor plant that opened last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The results have changed the economy. Of Israel's total $35
billion in exports last year, about one-third, or $12 billion were
in hi-tech.
</P>
<P>
   Figures were not available for electronics specifically, but
consider that Intel alone expects to export more than $1 billion
from its chip plant this year. Motorola last year exported about
$257 million from its mostly-communications facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts say that the American firms have not only helped the
electronics industry here grow, but have professionalized Israeli
marketing and managerial skills. The American influence, they say,
has also smoothed some of the rough edges on Israeli workers, known
to be gruff and undisciplined.
</P>
<P>
   There is some hype in Israel's selling of itself. Government
ministries frequently promote a graph showing that Israel has the
highest number of engineers and scientists per capita in the world.
Those figures come from 1984 and, according to one researcher, were
statistically flawed.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israel is indeed well-educated; third in the world in
percentage of residents with a university degree. That is the
lifeblood in the industry, where firms lose precious time to their
competitors if they have trouble finding labor.
</P>
<P>
   The big question hanging over hi-tech firms here is what will
happen now that Israel is starting to see a shortage of engineers.
It's not yet as acute as it is in the United States, but the labor
market is tightening.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli engineers still earn about 80 percent of what their
counterparts do in the United States, but salaries are climbing and
many workers are simply moving to America. Economists say the
hi-tech sector is at full employment at about 50,000. Berry said
there is actually a shortage of about 5,000 electronics workers.
</P>
<P>
   The crunch would be worse, had it not been for the highly
educated influx of 1 million immigrants from the former Soviet
Union. Motorola officials say about 20 percent of the workers at
their semiconductor center are from there.
</P>
<P>
   The market was still so tight that, two years ago, a corporate
association asked the government to grant visas to about 1,500
engineers from Asia, mostly India. It was an idea that would not
fly in the Jewish state, as some feared it would cause an influx of
largely non-Jewish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the shortage, major newcomers still arrive. Last year,
Dallas-based Texas Instruments spent about $415 million to buy two
Israeli companies that develop DSP technology _ specialized chips
for things like cable television systems.
</P>
<P>
   Linda Bernier, TI European manager for communications, said the
company still sees Israel as a ``vibrant center of high-level
expertise.''
</P>
<P>
   The future of Israel's electronics firms may depend on whether
the country can maintain its effort to increase the number of
engineering graduates.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, while Israel's got a hi-tech boost in the past from its
army technology, it may rely more in the future on it's peacemaking
abilities. Israel Kashat, vice president at Motorola's design
center, said peace talks could enable Israel to use the engineering
pools in the countries on its borders.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinians, for example, show avid computer affinity and some
already work for Israeli firms. Egypt, with 55 million people, has
a large supply of engineers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real untapped potential,'' Kashat said, ``is our
neighbors.''

   KIRYAT GAT, Israel _ This meadowland in central Israel was once
the domain of the Philistines and their warrior, Goliath. Now it is
the land of Intel, a much more welcome giant.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's boxy semiconductor plant on the edge of this depressed
town dominates the rural landscape.
</P>
<P>
   Outside, Arab shepherds still bring their livestock to graze.
Inside, workers in the dust-free ``clean room'' produce advanced
microprocessors _ chips _ for computers all over the world.
</P>
<P>
   The company's might seems to stretch the boundaries of this
small country.
</P>
<P>
   The $1.6 billion plant was the largest ever private investment
here. The government chipped in $600 million, the biggest such
corporate subsidy in the country's history. And, last year, Intel
bought Israel's DSP Communications for $1.6 billion, the largest
such acquisition in Israeli history.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Intel is pitching its boldest move here yet with the
proposed construction of another semiconductor plant. At a cost of
maybe $3 billion, it would be, of course, the biggest investment
the country has seen.
</P>
<P>
   But, Israel now has its own firm footing as a high technology
center. It is not as needy and almost certainly will not agree to
hand out as much money for another plant as it did in the
mid-1990s, when the deal was made for the last one.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole conditions in 1994-95 were different. The whole
circumstances have changed,'' said Israeli Minister for Industry
and Trade Ran Cohen.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel is an example of the advantages that have been offered,
and will not be offered to the same extent any longer,'' said
Yaacov Yisraeli, president of the Israel-American Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
   This month, Cohen met in New York with Intel executives to
discuss the plan. He and Finance Minister Avraham Shochat formed a
commission to decide what Israel can offer. The commission will
take several weeks to make recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Intel's track record here, which goes back nearly 30
years, will be in the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   The link between the world's biggest make of computer chips and
the tiny Jewish state started with Dov Frohman, an
American-educated Israeli. He joined Intel in 1969 and developed
the EPROM semiconductors, the first devices that allowed computers
to store information even after power was turned off.
</P>
<P>
   Frohman, now a 61-year-old Intel vice president, is known for
his long gray beard and a style that is casual even by Israel's
informal standards.
</P>
<P>
   As the story goes, Frohman wanted to move to Israel from the
United States in 1974. The company appeased him by sending him to
establish its first overseas design center. He put it in Haifa with
just a $300,000 investment.
</P>
<P>
   Intel would add its first overseas manufacturing plant in 1985
in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, the government of late Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin made the deal for the Kiryat Gat plant.
</P>
<P>
   Israel was just starting to realize the great potential the
hi-tech industry could offer a country low on natural resources,
and friendly neighbors. Rabin wanted to steer prosperity toward
depressed towns like Kiryat Gat, about an hour's drive south of Tel
Aviv. With just 20,000 residents, the town has little industry and
unemployment that hovers around 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The plant opened in June 1999 and projects exports exceeding $1
billion a year. Intel employs about 1,700 workers and uses another
1,700 as contract workers from local firms.
</P>
<P>
   It is one of five Intel producers of processors in the advanced
.18 micron technology _ a figure measuring the tiniest distances
possible between components on processors.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, there are few severe Intel detractors. The $600
million government incentive has nearly all been doled out.
</P>
<P>
   Amos Samuel, monitoring Intel's activities for the government,
gives a mixed, but generally positive, review.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not too bad,'' he says. ``We were hoping it would do better,
but all in all the progress is fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Samuel, while refusing to discuss specific terms, said Intel has
not done enough to work with local universities or share knowledge
with local companies.
</P>
<P>
   He gave the company high marks, though, for its involvement in
community projects, such as work with schools, and for establishing
teams to work on its other commitments.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a company big enough to make the locals play by its
rules.
</P>
<P>
   Israeli workers, known for being as unruly as they are
innovative, are getting used to Intel's tight safety and security
regimes. Government inspectors grudgingly let Intel employ Jewish
workers on the Sabbath, a violation of Israel's laws _ albeit
inconsistently enforced _ to preserve country's Jewish nature.
</P>
<P>
   Amit Anter Kertes, Intel's Israel spokesman, said the Kiryat Gat
plant has already added more than $790 million to the Israeli
economy. Nearly 60 percent of that was for construction of the
plant. Intel also claims it helped Israeli firms market $132
million in products, and paid $69 million for goods Intel bought
from local suppliers.
</P>
<P>
   The figures do not include salaries for its workers.
</P>
<P>
   The company also graduated and hired 90 Israelis from its own
nine-month course aimed at bringing local residents up to the
skills level needed in the plant. The course will soon start again.
</P>
<P>
   But the company's arrival raised higher hopes among local
residents. Anter Kertes acknowledges, ``They have a lot of
expectations and many of them we can't meet.''
</P>
<P>
   On the streets of Kiryat Gat, a town largely of small tenements
filled with working-class Israeli natives and Russian and
Uzbekistani immigrants, employment at Intel is a dream few count
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is good the government gave the money. But a lot of people
here thought that it would mean work for people who live in Kiryat
Gat,'' said Maya Azirov, a 40-year-old native of Uzbekistan who
runs a delicatessen with her husband. ``You need a lot of training
to work there.''
</P>
<P>
   More importantly, Kiryat Gat lacks English speakers. Though the
sign outside the plant spells Intel in English and Hebrew, inside
it is largely an English world.
</P>
<P>
   Koko Fahima, a member of the Kiryat Gat City Council, estimates
that less than 15 percent of workers at the plant are from Kiryat
Gat. Company figures do not dispute that, but note that 60 percent
of the workers are from the larger region around the small town.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a $600 million investment the government could have gotten
a lot more,'' Fahima said, calling Intel a ``superpower.''
</P>
<P>
   But, he's quick to note that Intel has lead to the creation of
50 new companies in the town.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   It's had other effects. Benny Uzinskau, a 25-year-old laborer
who worked for an insulation contractor at Intel, said he was
surprised that the company fined workers for not wearing their
helmets on the job or for smoking where they shouldn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was difficult. But you get used to it.'' Uzinskau
said.
</P>
<P>
   Near the plant, the town's fire station commander Tzion Saban
said he's learned a lot from Intel's fire control experts. A
hotline connects the plant directly to the station.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   But, whether another Intel plant will soon be nearby depends on
how much Intel and Israel still feel they need each other.
</P>
<P>
   In 1997, the Israeli parliament lowered the amount the
government can pitch into a project to 24 percent. That's down from
the nearly 38 percent it gave Intel.
</P>
<P>
   Israel also has other chip makers competing for government
grants. They include Tower Semiconductors, which is offering to
build a new plant in a consortium with Toshiba Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Intel officials say they are evaluating sites near
other plants in Ireland as well as in Arizona, New Mexico, Oregon
and Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   Industry and Trade Minister Cohen said he considers Intel a good
corporate citizen, but notes that he talks to companies all the
time that want to come here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is one of the advanced economies all over the world,''
he said. ``We do not need one project to change Israel.''

ANIMATION COMES TO LIFE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVID BLOOM 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fifteen years ago, when Terry Thoren founded the World Animation
Festival, there wasn't much going on in the field, at least not in
the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The theatrical shorts business that had been home for such
geniuses as Looney Tunes directors Tex Avery and Chuck Jones was
dead, Disney was reeling from the disastrous box office results for
``The Black Cauldron'' and television was a backwater of insipid,
poorly drawn kiddie cartoons.
</P>
<P>
   No more. These days, the world of animation is a wonderful one
indeed.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got so many opportunities. There's animation everywhere
now,'' said Thoren, CEO of Klasky-Csupo, the Hollywood-based
animation company that has scored TV hits with such clever shows as
``Rugrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Tote up the changes since 1985: Seven animated films will be
released this summer from just about all the major studios' newly
hatched animation divisions; ``The Simpsons'' are finishing their
10th year as one of the most celebrated and deeply thoughtful
sitcoms in TV history; and cable television and the Internet have
embraced animation as crucial parts of their entertainment
offerings.
</P>
<P>
   The World Animation Celebration, which hits Hollywood this week,
will try to cover all that's happening now in the business and art
of animation, in film, television and on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   And with 1,400 contest entries from 66 countries, along with a
series of special events, business panels and spotlights on the
latest in Japanese, Polish and Czech work, it's truly a worldwide
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Events will mostly be held at the Egyptian Theater and the
nearby Roosevelt Hotel on Hollywood Boulevard. Among the highlights
is the Tuesday night world premiere of ``Heavy Metal 2000,'' the
sequel to the 1981 animated cult movie. ``The Simpsons'' creator
Matt Groening will be honored in a salute on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, film veterans Don Bluth and Gary Goldman (``The
Rescuers,'' ``An American Tail'' and the insanely cool-looking new
``Titan A.E.'') are among a number of notables receiving lifetime
achievement awards. Next Saturday, film critic Leonard Maltin will
join director Brad Bird in talking about the creation of last
year's criminally overlooked ``The Iron Giant.'' The show wraps up
Sunday with an overview of the year's best work.
</P>
<P>
   The festival will also feature a conference on the TV animation
business; a trade and recruiting show; the ``Big Internet Animation
Pow Wow;'' and a panel on creating feature-length animation.
</P>
<P>
   That latter panel, featuring key members of ``The Blair Witch
Project'' creative team, will focus on making and marketing
inexpensive, independent-film style animation for grownups, said
Thoren.
</P>
<P>
   Thoren said he believes there's a market out there for modestly
budgeted, grownup-oriented animation. His company is making its own
such project, an as-yet unnamed R-rated film based on the works of
Charles Bukowski (as well as a big-budget ``Rugrats'' sequel for
Thanksgiving).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there's a market everywhere in the world for this, but
someone has to feed the market,'' Thoren said.
</P>
<P>
   One important aspect will be to establish, as the ``Blair
Witch'' folks did so well, an Internet presence early on, where the
film's characters and mythology can be introduced, Thoren said.
</P>
<P>
   Animators looking for outlets for their work can also hit the
Roosevelt, where most of the big Web sites that carry animation
will be taking pitches in their hotel cabanas.
</P>
<P>
   All told, it truly will be a world celebration. For more
information, schedules and ticket prices, go to www.wacfest.com.
The festival runs from Tuesday through Sunday, with some
adults-only events starting as late as midnight. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Steely-eyed character &QL; 
Speaking of fabulous animation, the 3-D computer-generated ``Max
Steel'' (on the WB Network's Channel 5) was just the subject of a
Net experiment that points to some interesting possibilities in
online entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the Max Steel animated character was turned into a
computerized puppet online. Using technology from Rotor
Communications, the character moved and talked online, responding
live to e-mail from fans who wrote in during a live chat session.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the first-ever live streaming event for an animated
property,'' said David Palmer, vice president of marketing for
``Max Steel'' producer Sony Pictures Family Entertainment Group.
``It's digital puppeteering. It really is pretty cool technology.''
</P>
<P>
   Technology something like this was shown off at the Virtual
Humans 3 conference in Los Angeles about 18 months ago, using a
computer-generated W.C. Fields to interact on a big television
screen with an audience. Behind the scenes sat a Fields
impersonator with a series of sensors attached to his face and body
that controlled the on-screen persona.
</P>
<P>
   Where that was used as an example of what could be done at trade
shows and similar events, the Max Steel event focused on the more
complicated process of being online, and dealing with potentially
huge audiences.
</P>
<P>
   It proved a moderate success, with thousands of kids downloading
the required plug-in from Rotor to take part. More importantly, it
points to some fascinating possibilities for new kinds of online
entertainment, said Rotor Vice President Adam Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   ``Up to now, most interactive programming ignored what the
Internet is about: a lot of people connected together and having a
shared experience,'' Tyler said.
</P>
<P>
   What about a live animated show where the audience can control
the direction of some plot points, for instance, or be polled about
questions posed by the character, or talk with each other and the
character?
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what's been immensely successful on the Net,
it's e-mail, chat, even eBay; they all embrace the notion that
thousands of people are sharing information and they're all
connected,'' said Tyler.
</P>
<P>
   Combine it with animation and some cool stuff can happen.
Animation can travel better over slow Internet connections than
video, and allows for wildly different kinds of images.
</P>
<P>
   It's a promising direction that the new Sony division _ which is
also doing computer-generated, 3-D animation for TV shows based on
``Starship Troopers'' and the videogame ``Heavy Gear'' _ is
pursuing, Palmer said. Shows like the ``Max Steel'' event are still
too costly and actors' rights issues haven't been cleared up yet,
but Steel yourself, this could end up being cool. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Up to bat &QL; 
It's kind of a dodgy idea (sorry), but Los Angeles' Boys of Summer
will be hosting their fifth Dodgers.com Night tonight at their
Elysian Park home.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be giving away computer wrist rests and will have an
online chat with some of the current players, former manager Tommy
Lasorda and former player Steve Garvey, among other activities.
Dodger.com officials boast that it's been named best team site five
years in a row by USA Today's Baseball Weekly. If you're a fan of
the boys in blue, take a swing by www.dodgers.com. &QL;

<P>
   Here is a selective listing by critics of The New York Times of
new or noteworthy movies currently playing in theaters. Running
times and ratings of films are in parentheses.
</P>
<P>
   `BATTLEFIELD EARTH,' starring John Travolta and Barry Pepper.
Directed by Roger Christian (PG-13, 117 minutes). In the year 3000,
beings from the planet Psychlo conquer Earth in only nine minutes
and reduce all humans to grunting illiterates. The chief nasty,
Terl (Travolta), devises a scheme to put the man-animals to work in
the gold mines for him. He sees potential in one cave dweller
(Pepper) and straps him to a machine that beams the wisdom of the
ages into his head. Little does Terl realize that by educating a
human, he is sowing the seeds of his own destruction. Sitting
through this film with its stock villains is like watching the most
expensively mounted high school play of all time. It may be a bit
early to make such judgments, but ``Battlefield Earth'' may well
turn out to be the worst movie of this century (Elvis Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `CENTER STAGE,' starring Ethan Stiefel, Sascha Radetsky, Amanda
Schull, Peter Gallagher and Donna Murphy. Directed by Nicholas
Hytner (PG-13, 113 minutes). Hytner's film tracks the professional
and romantic travails of a group of young dancers at the fictitious
American Ballet Academy in New York. The script is a patchwork of
show biz movie and romantic comedy cliches, and the acting rarely
rises above daytime soap-opera obviousness, but who ever went to a
dance movie to see good writing or realistic acting? The movie is
loaded with lively dance sequences, and Hytner films them
beautifully, especially the show-stopping finale, choreographed by
Susan Stroman and spiritedly danced by Stiefel, Radetsky and the
lovely Schull, who carries the movie with her energy and grace
(A.O. Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `DINOSAUR,' with the voices of D.B. Sweeney, Alfre Woodard and
Ossie Davis. Directed by Ralph Zondag and Eric Leighton (PG, 90
minutes). Reputedly the most expensive animated feature ever made,
Disney's showcase of computer animation technology begins with a
breathtaking sequence, a visual and sonic extravaganza that the
rest of the movie never quite lives up to. The story, of a young
dinosaur raised by lemurs who must lead a herd of his fellow
reptiles to safety after an asteroid strikes the earth, is cobbled
together from other Disney plots. But the effects _ the dinosaurs'
movements and their nearly seamless insertion into real locations _
will impress skeptical grownups (the movie reportedly cost about
$200 million). More important, the film, in spite of some
potentially upsetting scenes of carnivorous mayhem, will delight
children and whet their desire for the inevitable tie-in
merchandise (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `EAST-WEST,' starring Sandrine Bonnaire, Oleg Menchikov and
Catherine Deneuve. Directed by Regis Wargnier (PG-13, 115 minutes).
After World War II the Soviet government undertook a propaganda
campaign to entice Russians living in the West to return home.
Alexei Golovine (Menchikov) and his French wife, Marie (Bonnaire),
the couple at the heart of Wargnier's sumptuous, moving historical
melodrama, are luckier than most of their fellow returnees, who are
killed or imprisoned on arrival. ``East-West'' chronicles Alexei's
ambivalence about their new life in a drab, depressing communal
apartment and Marie's desperate attempts to escape it. The film may
be faulted for dissolving the horrors of history in Hollywood-style
catharsis, but it also uses the resources of old-fashioned
emotionally emphatic filmmaking to shed light on forgotten history.
``East-West'' is a grand costume pageant, full of grandeur and
period detail, but it is also the portrait of a marriage under
extreme external and internal pressure, and a showcase for two
great film actresses: Bonnaire and Deneuve, playing an actress who
becomes aware of Marie's plight during a tour of the Soviet Union
(Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `FREQUENCY,' starring Dennis Quaid and Jim Caviezel. Directed by
Gregory Hoblit (PG-13, 100 minutes). ``Back to the Future'' meets
``Field of Dreams'' meets ``It's a Wonderful Life'' meets ``The
Sixth Sense'' in this entertaining but shamelessly sentimental
supernatural soap opera with a macho heart. Caviezel is a morose
young policeman who contacts his dead father, a heroic firefighter,
on a ham radio and contrives to save him from the accident that
cost him his life during the 1969 World Series. From here, the two
collaborate on changing other aspects of the past and on catching a
serial killer. There are enough testosterone tears to soak Shea
Stadium (Stephen Holden).
</P>
<P>
   `GLADIATOR,' starring Russell Crowe, Joaquin Phoenix, Connie
Nielsen, Richard Harris and Oliver Reed. Directed by Ridley Scott
(R, 150 minutes). This movie is the answer to a question no one
bothered to ask: what would happen if someone decided to film the
imminent extreme football league as if it were a Chanel commercial?
Scott subjects action-packed bouts of mayhem and decapitation in
the Roman Colosseum to his glossy, inhuman directing style; it is
admirable but repellent. Crowe is the noble Roman general who ends
up fighting for his life. Crowe gives a performance with
ball-of-fire intensity, suffused with a movie star's impatience. He
holds the movie together, such as it is (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `HAMLET,' starring Ethan Hawke, Liev Schreiber, Julia Stiles,
Bill Murray, Diane Venora and Sam Shepard. Directed by Michael
Almereyda (R, 112 minutes). Almereyda has rooted his voluptuous and
rewarding new adaptation of Shakespeare's play in today's
Manhattan. The city's contradictions of beauty and squalor give the
movie a sense of place, and New York becomes a complex character in
this vital and sharply intelligent film. Often shaded in lush,
soothing hues of blue, ``Hamlet'' exudes an intoxicating masochism
in which half the cast is battling despondency and the other half
has the glint of imminent insanity. Here, the melancholy of Hamlet
(Hawke) over the death of his father is almost a state of grace: it
gives him a sense of purpose that the other characters lack. The
director's rigorous trimming has a boldness and vivacity that make
this version exhilarating while leaving Shakespeare's language and
intent intact (Mitchell).

<P>
   `LOVE AND BASKETBALL,' starring Sanaa Lathan and Omar Epps.
Directed by Gina Prince-Bythewood (PG-13, 118 minutes). The
writer-director Gina Prince-Bythewood's feature-film debut, about
the romantic and competitive bond between the basketball players
Monica (Lathan) and Quincy (Epps), has an enchanting, lived-in
homeyness. Prince-Bythewood does a wonderful job of creating an
atmosphere for her characters _ particularly for the superb Lathan
_ but the movie fails to fashion a consistent narrative. It doesn't
seem to be about anything. But it is a promising first movie from a
filmmaker with a lot to offer. Who knew anyone could get a drama
out of Title IX, the federal law ensuring that girls get a chance
to compete in high school sports? (Mitchell).

<P>
   `ROAD TRIP,' starring Breckin Meyer, Seann William Scott, Amy
Smart, DJ Qualls and Tom Green. Directed by Todd Phillips (R, 91
minutes). ``National Lampoon's Animal House'' meets ``There's
Something About Mary'' in the gross-out farce of the late spring.
Four college boys led by Josh (Meyer) embark on a desperate
1,800-mile journey from upstate New York to Texas to intercept an
X-rated dorm room video mistakenly sent to Josh's loyal girlfriend
in Austin. The fun is all in the gags, among them the notorious
French toast sequence, the envelope-pushing sperm bank scene, and
the hilarious car-jumped-over-the-bridge demolition derby. You'll
laugh despite yourself (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `SMALL TIME CROOKS,' starring Woody Allen and Tracey Ullman.
Directed and written by Allen (PG, 95 minutes). The sweet, funny
wisp of a movie starts out as a parody of ``Big Deal on Madonna
Street,'' then turns into a child's-eye ``Bonfire of the
Vanities,'' before returning to its original mode as a caper
comedy. Allen and Ullman are Ray and Frenchy Winkler, an inept
thief and ex-con and his upwardly mobile wife whose cookie business
takes off and allows Frenchy to indulge her dream of being a Park
Avenue hostess. If the movie suffers severely from attention
deficit disorder, the jokes are funny (but mild), the screwball
comic tone impeccably sustained and Ullman (putting on her Fern
Rosenthal voice) and Elaine May (as Frenchy's dimwitted cousin)
delightfully goofy (Holden). &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `TIME CODE,' starring Jeanne Tripplehorn, Saffron Burrows, Holly
Hunter and Stellan Skarsgard. Directed by Mike Figgis (R, 93
minutes). Figgis' astonishing new film, shot in a single day with
hand-held digital video cameras, tells four stories simultaneously,
in real time. ``Time Code'' is at once a mordant satire of the
hypocrisy and self-delusion of the film industry and an earnest
declaration of faith in the medium itself. In addition to its
technical innovations, which test the limits of the human eye, ear
and mind, the film boasts some brilliant improvisational acting
from its enormous cast. Especially fine are Tripplehorn and
Skarsgard, whose strongly emotional performances add a measure of
pathos. Whether ``Time Code'' will ultimately be seen as a bold
prophecy of the dawning visual age or as a passionate, gimmicky
curio is for the future to decide. At present, though, it is hard
to think of a more exciting demonstration of the inexhaustible
possibilities of film (Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `U-571,' starring Matthew McConaughey, Bill Paxton, Jon Bon
Jovi, David Keith and Harvey Keitel. Directed by Jonathan Mostow
(PG-13, 120 minutes). Mostow, whose previous film, ``Breakdown,''
was a marvel of B-picture minimalism, shifts from the wide-open
spaces to the cramped interior of a World War II submarine movie.
McConaughey, whose knotted-with-unease face makes it look as if he
were cramming for finals, is part of a secret mission to capture a
Nazi code-encryption machine and get it back to the Allies. He and
his crew have to do so on a Nazi U-boat they have hijacked. Mostow
does a fine job of building tension, given that he is working in a
minor genre whose climactic notes you will know if you have ever
seen a movie set on a sub (Mitchell).
</P>
<P>
   `THE VIRGIN SUICIDES,' starring Kirsten Dunst, James Woods and
Kathleen Turner. Directed by Sofia Coppola (R, 97 minutes).
Coppola's directorial debut, adapted from Jeffrey Eugenides' 1993
novel about the self-destruction of five sisters in a 1970s
Michigan suburb, shows her to be a filmmaker with fine visual and
emotional instincts, adept at matching the book's hypnotic, sensual
black humor. The movie's best moments have an inspired feeling of
playfulness and freedom matched by Dunst's smart, beguiling
performance as Lux Lisbon, whose sexual awakening propels her and
her sisters to their doom. But despite Coppola's keen instincts,
and the beautifully understated acting of Woods and Turner as the
Lisbon parents, ``The Virgin Suicides'' is marred by the
self-conscious aestheticism and emotional detachment of its source
(Scott).
</P>
<P>
   `WHERE THE HEART IS,' starring Natalie Portman and Ashley Judd.
Directed by Matt Williams (PG-13, 115 minutes). Young Novalee
Nation (Portman) is terribly phobic about the number five, and
about five minutes into this astonishingly shameless melodrama with
its lower-class sweetheart heroine, you will start to feel exactly
the same way. The movie seems to be stuck with its own five
fixation, too, because a new character or situation is introduced
every five minutes, or so it feels, to keep things lively.
Abandoned by her boyfriend, Novalee gives birth in a Wal-Mart. She
later befriends a nurse (Judd), a single mom with a passel of
children, and takes up photography. The audience doesn't get credit
for being able to track a character through life without the film's
being stuffed with enough nutty incidents _ a kidnapping,
catastrophic storms _ for an entire season of television
(Mitchell).

NEWS OF THE SILVER SCREEN 
</HEADLINE>
   By RICK LYMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ There is a line that appears a couple of times in
``M: I-2'' (though not quite as often as the series' patented
rubber-mask trick, which never seems to fail even though all the
spies already know it). It's a nifty bit of deconstruction: ``Any
search for a hero must begin with what a hero requires _ a
villain.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Towne, one of Hollywood's most respected screenwriters,
explains that it is with all action franchises, from 007 to Batman.
The genesis of each installment is not in the hero but in the
hero's quest, and that means a villain with a plausible and
nefarious scheme.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps some moviegoers are wondering what Towne, the author of
``Shampoo,'' ``Chinatown'' and other classics, is doing on a John
Woo shoot-'em-up, even one that stars Towne's frequent superstar
collaborator, Tom Cruise. Some might even be expecting Towne to
peel off a rubber mask and be revealed as, oh, Shane Black or Jeb
Stuart or some other action-flick specialist. But the project was
not without its allure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ever since the end of the Cold War, people have been looking
for a good villain,'' said Towne, dressed in track shorts and
T-shirt, as he sipped a cappuccino at his Pacific Palisades home.
For a while it was Arab terrorists. Then it was arms dealers or
renegade Russians or evil Washington bureaucrats. Nothing seemed to
work quite so well as those old standbys, the Nazis and the KGB.
</P>
<P>
   Towne said he was watching ``60 Minutes'' a few years ago when
he saw a segment about new boutique antibiotics that kill specific
strains of viruses. He filed the idea away. A bit later he was
reading an article in National Geographic about Eskimos and a weird
strain of virus found frozen in the Arctic ice. The dime dropped.
How's that for a villain? A pharmaceutical company that makes a
super-killer virus just so it can sell people the antidote!
</P>
<P>
   ``It's tricky writing for a franchise series like `Mission:
Impossible' because there are certain things that you know you
cannot do,'' Towne said. ``The single biggest challenge is to
convince the audience that the hero might die.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, if not the hero, at least the hero's love interest or
sidekick.
</P>
<P>
   ``The one thing you can work with is the emotional life of your
hero,'' Towne said. ``If there is a romance, will the girl
survive?''
</P>
<P>
   Towne, who had a hand in writing the 1996 ``Mission:
Impossible'' movie, was involved in the sequel early on but dropped
out when he went to direct ``Without Limits,'' for which Cruise was
co-producer. Several other writers _ Towne estimates seven or eight
_ were brought into the sequel, and several plot lines were flirted
with. But by the time Towne returned to the project after
completing ``Without Limits,'' the filmmakers had returned to the
original virus idea.
</P>
<P>
   Towne said the ``M:I-2'' team took to heart some of the
criticism of the first film: that it was needlessly complex and
that too many crucial plot points were buried beneath sound cues
and the rattle of explosions.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't want to abandon all the complexity; they figured the
puzzle was part of the pleasure of the series. But extra efforts
were made to ensure that all crucial plot points were given enough
space and time to register with the audience.
</P>
<P>
   As for the key to Cruise's hero, the super-agent Ethan Hunt, it
is, Towne said, in the actor's own basic character.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a risk taker,'' Towne said. ``Tom loves risks. And
that's what drives Ethan.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the ``Impossible'' part of the title that attracts the star
and the character, Towne said, as much as the working out of the
mission. Hunt always seems to solve problems by doing something
riskier than anyone else would dream of trying, yet he somehow
manages to be in full control in the process. Like a character from
Greek mythology, he puts on wings and flies toward the sun, but he
does not fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the key,'' Towne said. ``He looks like Icarus, but he
is really Daedalus.''
</P>
<P>
   The wax does not melt from Tom Cruise's wings. ``He knows the
limits of adhesion,'' Towne said.
</P>
<P>
   THE PUBLIC PULSE
</P>
<P>
   Once upon a time, back when people wore leisure suits and Steven
Spielberg and George Lucas were inventing the summer blockbuster,
Hollywood's most lucrative period began on Memorial Day weekend and
ended on Labor Day. Well, it's been many years since that was true,
with more and more summer-type blockbusters opening in mid-May,
then early May and now, as with this year's ``U-571,'' in April.
</P>
<P>
   So this Memorial Day weekend, the summer movie season is well
under way.
</P>
<P>
   There are already two huge successes _ Ridley Scott's
``Gladiator'' and Disney's ``Dinosaur'' _ and ``M:I-2'' is widely
expected to be the third. There have also been some notable
failures, like ``The Flintstones in Viva Rock Vegas'' and the bona
fide disaster of ``Battlefield Earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Can we learn anything yet about what audiences are hungry for
this year?
</P>
<P>
   ``In the digital age, perhaps movies are as much about the
places they take you as the stories they tell,'' said Walter
Parkes, who with Laurie MacDonald is jointly head of production at
DreamWorks, which released ``Gladiator.''
</P>
<P>
   Parkes and MacDonald, who were also executive producers of
``Gladiator,'' this week signed a new six-year deal with Dreamworks
that will allow them to continue their administrative duties while
producing some of their own movies, including films for Spielberg,
one of the studio's principals.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Wick, one of the producers of ``Gladiator,'' said
audiences seemed ready for new things.
</P>
<P>
   ``My sense is, it's one of those periods where there's a little
bit of fatigue with the same-old, same-old,'' said Wick, whose
producing credits also include the recent ``Stuart Little'' and the
coming ``Hollow Man,'' an invisible-man thriller. ``There is no
question that there is an appetite for unusual things.''
</P>
<P>
   While this summer season has its share of sequels (``M: I-2,''
``The Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps,'' ``Pokemon 2000'') and some
car-chase action films like those popular in previous summers
(``Gone in 60 Seconds''), there are also a lot of big, expensive
movies with unusual settings: second-century Rome in ``Gladiator,''
colonial America in ``The Patriot,'' North Atlantic fishing grounds
in ``The Perfect Storm.''
</P>
<P>
   And there are ``dinosaurs like nobody's ever seen before,'' Wick
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, it's better to go into the marketplace with
something that feels new,'' he said. ``Maybe it's just an old
genre, like sword-and-sandal movies, given new life with new
technology.''

LEADERSHIP IS NOT JUST A SKILL

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by The New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, MASS. _ It is a commonplace nowadays to hear people
who are discussing public affairs bemoan the absence, or even the
failure, of leadership.
</P>
<P>
   It is true in most democratic countries, and even in some where
the complaint is that there is too heavy a hand on the helm without
accountability. But even a shallow probe shows how little the vague
wish for better organization of society reflects concrete meaning.
</P>
<P>
   What is meant by leadership? What should it do and be careful
not to do? How far should people insist on what they want from
their governors and how far should they let themselves be chivied
or cajoled to accept what they are told?
</P>
<P>
   A recent conference at Harvard jointly sponsored by the Kennedy
School of Government and the world leadership group of the
InterAction Council bogged down immediately as a few dozen well
practiced minds came up with endless answers.
</P>
<P>
   It was like the Supreme Court justice who once said that he
couldn't define pornography but he knew it when he saw it. The
purpose was unexceptionable, to promote ``enlightened leadership''
both in the U.S. and in the rest of the world, and to draw up
standards.
</P>
<P>
   The former heads of government who compose the InterAction
Council have been struggling to outline the responsibilities of
good leadership for years, and now the Kennedy School has a special
center for studying and teaching this elusive skill.
</P>
<P>
   There is a widespread sense that the need for good leaders is
more urgent than ever. The philosophic attraction of anarchy,
sometimes intense in the 19th century as the way to get rid of bad
government by getting rid of all government, no longer has even
theoretical appeal.
</P>
<P>
   Some American conservatives argue that government is the
problem, not the solution, but they are always asking government to
make other people observe the rules they approve. There are just
too many people and society is far too complex to leave its
organization unsettled.
</P>
<P>
   Two important changes add new urgency to the sense that
leadership which provides both smooth functioning and direction to
deal with change is absolutely essential.
</P>
<P>
   One is the challenge of technology to the way people are
accustomed to doing things and which they can see don't work as
needed any more.
</P>
<P>
   The other is the weight that the market idea has taken on,
overwhelming so many other factors that are still respected or
admired but which somehow can't compete.
</P>
<P>
   The complaint about globalization, its degrading and destructive
aspects, is really not about removing barriers but about
commercialization, about money becoming the measure of all. That is
not new, but the degree of money-mindednes has reached new
extremes.
</P>
<P>
   Marketing is what really matters, not only in merchandise but in
sports, entertainment, politics. A young American of the new
mindset even argued recently that the weakness of the euro,
Europe's new common currency, stems from the failure to promote it
with adequate energy and imagination, maybe handing net chocolate
coins.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to market money, without stopping to realize he would
still want to seek a return for what he sells.
</P>
<P>
   Opinion polls form an adjunct to the modern market, though it
often becomes quite unclear just who is the producer and who the
consumer, and when they trade places.
</P>
<P>
   A medical metaphor was offered to the dilemma of leadership, on
the grounds that a good and kindly doctor must also offer
well-judged doses of the truth to be dispensed according to the
patient's capacity.
</P>
<P>
   What people want to hear, which polls serve to amplify, may be
far different from what they need to know to deal wisely with
current and foreseeable problems.
</P>
<P>
   The leader may have to face a trade-off between popularity and
the courage of integrity, which the market of the ballot boy may
take its time about punishing and rewarding.
</P>
<P>
   But who is to say that the leader really does know better and
really can better distinguish between sturdy truth and promotional
pap? It's useful to discuss leadership and remind ourselves of its
inevitable role, if only also to remember that we keep changing our
minds about what we think we want.
</P>
<P>
   It is profoundly risky to reduce the idea of democratic
discourse, the exchange of grievances and aspirations, to a matter
of skills and techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Teaching enlightened leadership should basically be about clear
thinking and good ethics, and that is how followers can and should
judge those who seek their support. We need first a better idea for
ourselves of what we want. &QL;

<P>
   KHIAM, SOUTH LEBANON _ The torturers had just left but the
horror remained.
</P>
<P>
   There were the whipping pole and the window grilles where
prisoners were tied naked for days, freezing water thrown over them
at night.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the electric leads for the little dynamo _ the
machine mercifully taken off to Israel by the interrogators _ which
had the inmates shrieking with pain when the electrodes touched
their fingers or penises. And there were the handcuffs which an
ex-prisoner handed to me Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Engraved into the steel were the words: ``The Peerless Handcuff
Co. Springfield, Mass. Made in USA.''
</P>
<P>
   And I wondered, in Israel's most shameful prison, if the
executives over in Springfield knew what they were doing when they
sold these manacles.
</P>
<P>
   They were used over years to bind the arms of prisoners before
interrogation. And they wore them, day and night, as they were
kicked _ kicked so badly in Sulieman Ramadan's case that they later
had to amputate his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Another prisoner was so badly beaten, he lost the use of a leg.
I found his crutch in Khiam prison Wednesday, along with piles of
Red Cross letters from prisoners _ letters which the guards from
Israel's now-defunct ``South Lebanon Army'' militia never bothered
to forward.
</P>
<P>
   What is it that makes men do things like this? The prisoners _
thousands of them over the two decades of Khiam's existence _
included guerrillas, relatives of gunmen, civilians by the dozen
whose crime was innocence, who would not collaborate with the
Israelis or the SLA, who refused to join the murderous little
militia, who declined to give the Israelis information about the
Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hung here naked for 13 days,'' Abdullah Attiyeh told me
as we walked along a dirty passageway beside the wall of the old
French mandate fort. ``They put a bag on my head and threw cold
water over me night and day.''
</P>
<P>
   The hoods were still there, big light blue corduroy sacks with
towels inside _ some of the towels bought from Norwegian UNIFIL
soldiers because the U.N. globe was embroidered on some of them _
and so was the wire with which other prisoners, including women,
were beaten. Big, thick wire bound in blue plastic.
</P>
<P>
   The torturers were sadistic, often stupid men. There were
pornographic magazines and cheap comics and puzzle books in their
filthy quarters. Israel has admitted teaching these men how to do
their job.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's section, we found the mementos of girls. A
drawing of a fish with a heart attached to it and a painting of six
white horses running over a darkened field.
</P>
<P>
   There was a picture of Father Christmas taken from a chocolate
wrapper. And names. ``Zeina Koutash, born 3/9/79, arrested 7/5/99,
released 3/1/2000.''
</P>
<P>
   There the name of Rana Awada and Ismahan Ali Khalil, only 19
when she was dragged to this awful place by the SLA. ``How many
drops of blood have been spilt on our soil _ and have not
flowered?'' she wrote on the wall. Along with two words: ``Remember
me.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, the prematurely old men who languished in Khiam
came back Wednesday at the moment of its liberation, to relive
their misery.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose evil is always banal but I couldn't fail to be struck
by how grubby the whole place was, how unclean, how smelly, as if
wickedness had somehow corrupted the prison. The lavatories stank,
the food had been left to rot, the prison cells were covered in
muck.
</P>
<P>
   The men's solitary block was a pit in the ground with a concrete
hole for air. A broken wooden police baton lay outside. ``Dog
Zorro'' was written on it.
</P>
<P>
   There was a little humanity. One ex-inmate recalled the name of
Tannious Nahara, an SLA guard from Qleia who would bring food and
cigarettes to the prisoners. He was fired from his job for being
kind. And threatened with imprisonment in the jail he had worked
in.
</P>
<P>
   But the cruel men had all fled, pleading their way across the
border into Israel a few hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Kalash was allowed a bath once every 40 days. ``If we
spilt water on the floor, they used to make us lick it clean,'' he
said. ``You're surprised we didn't escape? Four men did. One made
it, another was shot, another captured and the fourth blew himself
up on a mine and lost a leg and an eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the prison there are mine fields galore. ``An Israeli
officer came here and told the SLA men: `Destroy everything that is
green,''' Abdullah Attiyeh said. ``That is why there are no trees,
just long grass with mines.''
</P>
<P>
   The prison interrogation rooms were as banal as the men who
worked them. There were playing cards scattered on the floor, jars
of coffee, helmets, unwashed clothes and a stack of beer mats
bearing the words ``Middle East Lutheran Ministry.''
</P>
<P>

&HT;     TRYING TO MATCH THE HATCH CAN FRUSTRATE THE BEST FISHERMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By FRED LeBRUN  
 &HT;     c.2000 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Even for the most experienced dry-fly fisherman,
the timer starts ticking and the adrenaline kicks in when the hatch
materializes.
</P>
<P>
   When those first few anticipated slim-winged insects with long
arched bodies leave their nymphal shucks and rise from the surface
of the water and flutter briefly in front of your nose, then seem
to disappear. When trout spontaneously dimple the water all around,
trout you had no idea even existed in this stretch.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly the air over the stream and along the shores is alive
with thousands of delicately winged insects moving like battalions
of tiny helicopters. Your heart starts to pound, the hands fumble
for the bifocals.
</P>
<P>
   Show time, and who knows how long the show will last. Because
when the fluttering starts, you know all too well it's only a
matter of time before the hatch will fade just as dramatically.
There's no way of knowing when that will be. A few minutes, 20
perhaps. Forty on a good day. The angler has little time to
determine which mayfly or caddis fly it is that's rising; more
importantly, which is particularly interesting to those dimpling
trout.
</P>
<P>
   The strategy has to be settled, and fast. At which phase of the
mayfly's well-known cycle will the fisherman attempt to imitate the
natural? On the bottom, under the surface, on the surface, or
falling from the sky after mating? Each phase has its own patterns
of artificial imitations of fur and feathers, threads and snippets.
</P>
<P>
   The devil of it is that one day the trout will feed only on the
nymphs coming up from the bottom, another day on the emerging
mayfly when it's quite vulnerable, another day just on the spinner
falls of the spent and mated insects. And you can't always tell
which is which, even when standing there in the stream.
</P>
<P>
   To complicate matters, especially later in the season, several
different mayflies and a few caddis flies frequently will emerge at
roughly the same time, meaning that all the combinations and
permutations are multiplied by the number of different insects.
</P>
<P>
   As enormously complicated as all this seems, we still haven't
talked about which artificial fly patterns to consider, what style,
which size, or the delicacy of the leader tippet attached to the
fly. The lighter the tippet, the easier to fool the fish. The
lighter the tippet, the easier to lose the fish. Then you have to
decide whether to fish straight across, upstream or down, with or
without a dropper fly. The choices go on and on and on.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great charms of fly fishing is that there are an
infinite number of ways to fail.
</P>
<P>
   Yet fly fishers catch trout all the time, so it can't be that
complicated. And it isn't, generally. Although trying to match the
hatch and fool the fish is sometimes so complex that even the
crustiest veteran fails to solve the puzzle and walks away fishless
and muttering. It happens sometimes to the best of them, and often
to the worst of us.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, if you can't lose, the game isn't worth playing.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As a practical matter, much of what I just touched on _ and
there's a lot more to it _ is automatically assimilated into a fly
fisherman's technique and style, which develops with time and
experience. Those of us who have done it for a while go on
automatic pilot when the hatch starts, any hatch. We reach for
favored flies and tried and true patterns, the lightest tippet we
think we can handle, position ourselves and start to cast.
</P>
<P>
   Then it happens or it doesn't, and when it doesn't we go to plan
B and work our way down the alphabet and into a bottle of scotch.
Oh, it's the best game.
</P>
<P>
   Mayflies, caddis flies, stone flies and others hatch in a
regular serial rhythm year after year in timeless replay. Reciting
their names and when we can expect which to come off the water is
our catechism.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of May is the time for a particular mayfly called
an Ephemerella subvaria, the female being imitated by a Hendrickson
and the male by a red quill, two quite dissimilar flies. Although
we generally call this the Hendrickson hatch. Don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   To my mind this is the first predictable hatch of the season
that's a delight to fish because it rises at about the time the
school buses are leaving the yard. Typically this will go on for a
couple of weeks.

<P>
   KHIAM, SOUTH LEBANON _ The torturers had just left but the
horror remained.
</P>
<P>
   There were the whipping pole and the window grilles where
prisoners were tied naked for days, freezing water thrown over them
at night.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the electric leads for the little dynamo _ the
machine mercifully taken off to Israel by the interrogators _ which
had the inmates shrieking with pain when the electrodes touched
their fingers or penises. And there were the handcuffs which an
ex-prisoner handed to me Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Engraved into the steel were the words: ``The Peerless Handcuff
Co. Springfield, Mass. Made in USA.''
</P>
<P>
   And I wondered, in Israel's most shameful prison, if the
executives over in Springfield knew what they were doing when they
sold these manacles.
</P>
<P>
   They were used over years to bind the arms of prisoners before
interrogation. And they wore them, day and night, as they were
kicked _ kicked so badly in Sulieman Ramadan's case that they later
had to amputate his arm.
</P>
<P>
   Another prisoner was so badly beaten, he lost the use of a leg.
I found his crutch in Khiam prison Wednesday, along with piles of
Red Cross letters from prisoners _ letters which the guards from
Israel's now-defunct ``South Lebanon Army'' militia never bothered
to forward.
</P>
<P>
   What is it that makes men do things like this? The prisoners _
thousands of them over the two decades of Khiam's existence _
included guerrillas, relatives of gunmen, civilians by the dozen
whose crime was innocence, who would not collaborate with the
Israelis or the SLA, who refused to join the murderous little
militia, who declined to give the Israelis information about the
Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was hung here naked for 13 days,'' Abdullah Attiyeh told me
as we walked along a dirty passageway beside the wall of the old
French mandate fort. ``They put a bag on my head and threw cold
water over me night and day.''
</P>
<P>
   The hoods were still there, big light blue corduroy sacks with
towels inside _ some of the towels bought from Norwegian UNIFIL
soldiers because the U.N. globe was embroidered on some of them _
and so was the wire with which other prisoners, including women,
were beaten. Big, thick wire bound in blue plastic.
</P>
<P>
   The torturers were sadistic, often stupid men. There were
pornographic magazines and cheap comics and puzzle books in their
filthy quarters. Israel has admitted teaching these men how to do
their job.
</P>
<P>
   In the women's section, we found the mementos of girls. A
drawing of a fish with a heart attached to it and a painting of six
white horses running over a darkened field.
</P>
<P>
   There was a picture of Father Christmas taken from a chocolate
wrapper. And names. ``Zeina Koutash, born 3/9/79, arrested 7/5/99,
released 3/1/2000.''
</P>
<P>
   There the name of Rana Awada and Ismahan Ali Khalil, only 19
when she was dragged to this awful place by the SLA. ``How many
drops of blood have been spilt on our soil _ and have not
flowered?'' she wrote on the wall. Along with two words: ``Remember
me.''
</P>
<P>
   And of course, the prematurely old men who languished in Khiam
came back Wednesday at the moment of its liberation, to relive
their misery.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose evil is always banal but I couldn't fail to be struck
by how grubby the whole place was, how unclean, how smelly, as if
wickedness had somehow corrupted the prison. The lavatories stank,
the food had been left to rot, the prison cells were covered in
muck.
</P>
<P>
   The men's solitary block was a pit in the ground with a concrete
hole for air. A broken wooden police baton lay outside. ``Dog
Zorro'' was written on it.
</P>
<P>
   There was a little humanity. One ex-inmate recalled the name of
Tannious Nahara, an SLA guard from Qleia who would bring food and
cigarettes to the prisoners. He was fired from his job for being
kind. And threatened with imprisonment in the jail he had worked
in.
</P>
<P>
   But the cruel men had all fled, pleading their way across the
border into Israel a few hours earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Ibrahim Kalash was allowed a bath once every 40 days. ``If we
spilt water on the floor, they used to make us lick it clean,'' he
said. ``You're surprised we didn't escape? Four men did. One made
it, another was shot, another captured and the fourth blew himself
up on a mine and lost a leg and an eye.''
</P>
<P>
   Around the prison there are mine fields galore. ``An Israeli
officer came here and told the SLA men: `Destroy everything that is
green,''' Abdullah Attiyeh said. ``That is why there are no trees,
just long grass with mines.''
</P>
<P>
   The prison interrogation rooms were as banal as the men who
worked them. There were playing cards scattered on the floor, jars
of coffee, helmets, unwashed clothes and a stack of beer mats
bearing the words ``Middle East Lutheran Ministry.''
</P>
<P>
   Ghassan Abu Aissa, a well-known stool-pigeon _ working for the
SLA and Israelis but incarcerated along with the inmates _ even
left a notebook of childish love poems, a morbid complaint about
the hopelessness of passion.
</P>
<P>
   Abu Ahlan, a prisoner of more integrity, had written on a wall:
``Lebanon is ours and for our children after us.'' And I suppose
that's why they came back to look at Khiam Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Abdullah Attiyeh walked me to the prison guardpost on the walls
and looked out at the land and mountains he was never allowed to
see during his imprisonment. ``This place,'' he said, ``should be
kept forever as a witness to our history.'' &QL;

HOW SWEET THE SOUND
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
ByEVAN HENERSON 
c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News 
<TEXT>
<P>
   First things first: Yes, that is her real voice, both when she
speaks and in live performance. Whiskey over gravel, and, in its
own peculiar way, a thing of beauty. At the beginning of Macy
Gray's packed show at the Greek Theatre, you have to wonder whether
a voice that would kick some serious tail in smaller club venues is
going to carry her through at a big house. Of course, by the end of
the show, you wonder why you wondered.
</P>
<P>
   In the second stop on a tour that will carry her through the
summer, the Ohio-born, Valley-dwelling Gray proved herself to be as
capable a showperson as she is a musician. Her 100-minute set at
the Greek left a very appreciative crowd with little time to
actually sit down and catch a breath. Mostly we were on our feet
chanting and swaying, occasionally dancing. Because that's what
Macy Gray _ or one of her bandmates _ was always instructing us to
do.
</P>
<P>
   Her brisk-selling first album, ``On How Life Is,'' was the basis
for her set, but Gray the performer didn't waste any time telling
an audience anything about how !ital!herlife is. Rarely did she
talk about herself or spend any time setting up a song. If her
patter is a window into what she's all about, we get that Macy Gray
thinks love is good and sex is often better. Hardly a news flash,
since that's the thrust of many of her songs.
</P>
<P>
   In performance, those songs are an adrenaline rush, made even
more so by Gray's willingness to juggle tones and beats midnumber,
often kicking up the pace or slowing things down. Blending traces
of hip-hop, salsa, funk and blues, Gray has quite a few musical
styles fighting for space in her act. With 10 band members behind
her _ including an under-utilized, record-scratching DJ _ she
seemed to give every genre a quick airing, although the show's main
tone was standard pop.
</P>
<P>
   Unquestionably a generous performer, Gray left the stage halfway
through her set to give her band a skill-displaying jam session.
She reappeared _ having swapped her shimmering pant suit for an
orange version with yellow boa _ to sing chorus on a bluesy ``Que
Sera Sera,'' letting her three back-up singers handle the verses.
During the encore set, her opening act, the Black Eyed Peas, joined
her for a hip-hop song called ``Hey DJ.''
</P>
<P>
   The audience joined in on the choruses of ``Do Something'' (the
evening's second number), the chant in ``Caligula'' and ``I Can't
Wait to Meetchu.'' The radio prominent ``I Try'' closed the encore
set.
</P>
<P>
   Here's wondering what Gray will do as a studio encore, and
hoping we won't have to wait long to find out. &QL;

 &HT;    19-year-old joins Evernham, Elliott
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CONCORD, N.C. _Bill Elliott's teammate at Dodge next year will
be a driver half the age of the former Winston Cup champion.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Evernham announced Thursday that 19-year-old phenom Casey
Atwood has agreed to join his team with Elliott, beginning with the
2001 season. Atwood is in his second full year on the Busch Grand
National Series.
</P>
<P>
   Evernham ``can definitely make a lot of people ready before they
are actually ready,'' Atwood said. ``In all honesty, if it had been
anything else except for this deal with Ray and Dodge, I wouldn't
have taken it. I would have stayed in Busch for a while.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this was something you just can't pass up, with Ray's
knowledge and what he did with Jeff Gordon,'' Atwood said. ``And
then there is Dodge's heavy commitment to get back into stock-car
racing. I just felt like this was a winning situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Evernham served as Gordon's crew chief 1993-1999, guiding the
No. 24 Chevy driver to three Winston Cup championships. He resigned
last year to lead Dodge's return to the major-league circuit and to
start his own team.
</P>
<P>
   His plan all along was for the team to consist of one veteran
and one rookie. He accomplished the first goal when Bill Elliott
signed on at the March Atlanta race. Atwood's agreement, which took
several months to work out, completes the search.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our idea is to build the team with Bill and keep the pressure
off of Casey,'' Evernham said. ``He is young, and we want to give
him the experience he needs with our team. We think he has a great
future.''
</P>
<P>
   Winston Cup teams have been pursuing Atwood since soon after he
made his Busch series debut in 1998 at the age of 17. In his second
race, at Nashville, Atwood won the pole and finished second.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Atwood became the youngest driver to win a Busch
race, and he finished 13th in the final standings. After a dozen
races this season, Atwood has one pole and three top-10 finishes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Am I ready for this step? I don't know,'' Atwood said. ``We're
definitely going to see. I'm not going to lie, though.... I'm
definitely nervous about moving up to Winston Cup. But I know I
have the best (support) behind me.''
</P>
<P>
   Atwood will drive the No. 19 Dodge Intrepid, which was
Evernham's old number when he was racing modifieds. Atwood also
plans to qualify for five of this year's final 23 Winston Cup
races.
</P>
<P>
   CASEY ATWOOD FILE
</P>
<P>
   Age: 19.
</P>
<P>
   Hometown: Nashville.
</P>
<P>
   Racing history: Started go-karts at the age of 10. Competed in
13 Busch races in 1998, winning two poles and finishing an average
of 20th. In 1999, won at Milwaukee and Dover, took two pole
positions and had nine finishes in the top 10.
</P>
<P>

at Hendrick Motorsports by landing one of the most promising
drivers in NASCAR.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of heavy showers and some potent thunderstorms will be
focused near a front separating seasonably cool air over the
Midwest and Northeast from hot weather in the South. Strong
shifting high-level winds accompanying a jet stream disturbance
will heighten the risk of scattered tornadoes across the central
Plains later Friday. Rains of 1 to 3 inches will be common by
Saturday morning from northwestern Oklahoma to southern Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Converging winds near a strengthening low-pressure center will
cause showers and some strong thunderstorms from the eastern slopes
of the northern Rockies early Friday to the Dakotas Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   The record heat of recent days in the Southwest will abate, but
temperatures will remain above the seasonal average. The Northwest
will have variable clouds and a few mountain showers.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: WEATHER BREEDER
</P>
<P>
   Zones of great temperature contrast provide the breeding ground
for foul weather. On Wednesday, temperatures at several cities in
western and central Texas were near 110 degrees, setting records
for the highest ever recorded in May. In Mobridge, S.D., the
mercury plummeted to 35 degrees early Thursday, a record low for
the date. During the next few days, atmospheric motions will be
generated that will reduce the disparity. The result will be
recurrent potent thunderstorms and the risk of flooding rain in
parts of the Plains and Midwest.

&HT;     BRIEFS ARE FILED IN SAN FRANCISCO NEWSPAPER TRIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By SETH ROSENFELD  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Former mayoral candidate Clint Reilly has
broadened his legal attack on San Francisco's daily newspaper
publishers, asking a federal judge to permanently bar not only the
Hearst Corp.'s purchase of the Chronicle but also its sale of the
Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst on Wednesday countered that Reilly's suit was baseless
and that he had slandered a host of people _ from Hearst executives
to Mayor Willie Brown and U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno _ with
false claims that the proposed newspaper deals were ``the product
of an enormous political conspiracy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Fang family accused Reilly of suing The Examiner and the
Chronicle for endorsing Brown over Reilly in last year's mayoral
race. Reilly denied the claims.
</P>
<P>
   And in a rare legal split with Hearst during the trial, the
Chronicle said it did not believe the Newspaper Preservation Act
protected two clauses in its joint operating agreement with Hearst
_ clauses that Alioto contends illegally blocked other major media
firms from bidding against Hearst for the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The claims and counterclaims came as lawyers in Reilly's
antitrust suit filed proposed legal findings in the nation's first
trial on a challenge to the breakup of a joint operating agreement
between two daily newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The briefs summarized each side's legal position and answered
questions posed by U.S. District Judge Vaughn Walker, who will rule
on Reilly's contention that Hearst's proposed deals will illegally
reduce ewspaper competition in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   The briefs set the stage for closing arguments May 31.
</P>
<P>
   Reilly's complaint contends Hearst's plan to buy the Chronicle
and sell The Examiner to the Fangs will result in Hearst's owning
the only metropolitan daily paper in San Francisco, an alleged
illegal monopoly that will reduce editorial voices and increase
subscription and advertising prices.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph M. Alioto, Reilly's lawyer, has argued that Hearst's deal
with the Fangs, which gives them a subsidy of up to $66 million
over three years to offset publishing costs, is a sham because the
subsidy is insufficient and The Examiner will fold.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto previously asked Walker to permanently bar Hearst from
buying the Chronicle. But in his brief Wednesday, and in a proposed
amended complaint filed last week, he broadened his request by
asking Walker to:
</P>
<P>
   _ Block Hearst from selling The Examiner to the Fangs,
publishers of the free, thrice-weekly San Francisco Independent.
</P>
<P>
   _ Nullify a part of Hearst's joint operating agreement with the
Chronicle that gives each partner the chance to outbid offers from
other potential buyers.
</P>
<P>
   _ Void another part that prevents partners in the agreement from
operating other newspapers within 60 miles of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, the Chronicle and the Fangs have denied Reilly's claims
and Wednesday renewed their request that Walker dismiss his
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the parties' arguments on key legal issues:
</P>
<P>
   1) Does Reilly have standing to sue?
</P>
<P>
   Alioto said his client has standing under the Clayton Antitrust
Act as a consumer because he buys the Chronicle and Examiner and
would be affected by alleged price increases ``the hallmarks of
monopoly'' that he claims would result from Hearst's proposed
newspaper deals.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst and Chronicle counter that Reilly lacks legal standing
because he has failed to show he would suffer significant economic
injury.
</P>
<P>
   David Balabanian, the Fangs' lawyer, contended the suit was
Reilly's ``means of obtaining retribution against the newspapers
which opposed his mayoral candidacy and the man who defeated him.''
</P>
<P>
   Reilly lost last year's mayoral race to Brown after spending
about $4 million of his own money on his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Wednesday, Reilly displayed a photo of his
father selling newspapers on a San Francisco street corner in the
1930s. He said he wanted only to ensure that San Francisco has two
strong competing newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   2) Is Hearst entitled to the failing-business defense?
</P>
<P>
   Hearst contends The Examiner is an economically failing
business, and that as a result it may buy the Chronicle and close,
sell or donate The Examiner without harming competition.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Halling, a Hearst lawyer, said The Examiner would lose tens
of millions of dollars a year if published outside its
profit-splitting agreement with the Chronicle, which he said
generates more revenue and in effect subsidizes The Examiner. The
Chronicle's daily circulation is 465,535. The Examiner's is
108,968.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the papers evenly split combined revenue,
production costs and the ``net excess'' without regard to their
respective circulations. Each paper then pays its editorial costs.
Hearst has said that last year it netted about $20.5 million in
profit under the arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   But even within the agreement, Halling argued, The Examiner is
failing because, Hearst's analyses show, The Examiner's share of
production costs far exceeds the revenue it generates.
</P>
<P>
   And after an extensive sales effort, Hearst could find no one
who would take The Examiner for free, and had to give the Fangs a
subsidy, Halling said. Reilly had tried to buy The Examiner and
requested a larger subsidy, according to Hearst.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto countered that the failing-business defense is not
available to Hearst, because it applies only when the company to be
acquired is a failing competitor and the purchasing firm is the
only available buyer.
</P>
<P>
   If the law did apply, Alioto said, Hearst cannot prove The
Examiner is failing.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst expects The Examiner to continue to net a profit through
2005, he said.
</P>
<P>
   And Hearst has not tracked The Examiner's separate production
costs under the joint operating agreement, said Alioto, adding,
``The Examiner is not in fact failing.''
</P>
<P>
   3) Does the Newspaper Preservation Act require continued
publication of The Examiner and the Chronicle until 2005?
</P>
<P>
   The act says newspapers may form joint operating agreements that
would otherwise violate antitrust laws when one of them is in
danger of failing, so long as they remain editorially independent.
The law is meant to give communities the benefit of multiple
editorial voices.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto claims that in return for profitable immunity from
antitrust laws, the Chronicle and Examiner have a public duty to
publish until the agreement expires.
</P>
<P>
   He contends Hearst's plan to buy the Chronicle and sell The
Examiner to the Fangs ``is a misuse and perversion of both the
Newspaper Preservation Act and the JOA (joint operating
agreement).''
</P>
<P>
   Halling counters that the act is merely a voluntary exemption
from antitrust laws and does not require publishers to continue the
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   ``The JOA is not a contract with the `public' as plaintiff
asserts,'' said Halling.
</P>
<P>
   4) Is competition improved or harmed by the proposed newspaper
deals?
</P>
<P>
   Hearst and the Chronicle contend that Hearst's purchase of the
Chronicle and shedding of The Examiner will improve competition,
because the Chronicle no longer will need to subsidize the failing
Examiner and can put more resources into the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   The Chronicle then could better compete against other media in
the greater Bay Area, including Knight Ridder, which owns the San
Jose Mercury News and Contra Costa Times, radio and television, and
the Internet, Halling said.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Alioto more narrowly defined the competitive
battleground, saying it involves only daily newspapers in San
Francisco or the greater ``metropolitan area.''
</P>
<P>
   As a result, he argued, Hearst's sale of The Examiner will not
preserve competition because the Fangs' version of it ``cannot be a
competitive daily newspaper or even a colorable substitute for the
present paper.''
</P>
<P>
   Balabanian countered that the newspaper deals will increase
competition and that the Fangs have an ``excellent'' chance of
making the paper solvent.
</P>
<P>
   Balabanian contended that Hearst divested itself of The Examiner
to satisfy concerns of the U.S. Department of Justice, which was
reviewing the proposed deals.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department concluded the deals would provide
economic competition between newspapers in San Francisco for the
first time in 35 years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The state attorney general's office and the San Francisco city
attorney's office also reviewed and chose not to block the proposed
newspaper sales.
</P>
<P>
   5) Was there a conspiracy to obtain an illegal monopoly?
</P>
<P>
   Alioto contends that Hearst, the Chronicle and the Fangs have
engaged in an illegal conspiracy.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto has claimed the Fangs offered to use their ``extensive''
political connections to help Hearst win support for its purchase
of the Chronicle in return for Hearst's agreement to sell The
Examiner to the Fangs. The Fangs are political allies of Brown, who
opposed Hearst's initial plan to buy the Chronicle. Alioto has
pointed to meetings about the deals that, at various points,
involved the Fangs, Brown, U.S. Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Examiner
Publisher Timothy O. White.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Fangs have thereby joined and entered the pre-existing
unlawful combination between Hearst and CPC (Chronicle Publishing
Co.),'' Alioto said in his brief.
</P>
<P>
   Hearst, Chronicle and the Fangs deny the conspiracy claim.
</P>
<P>
   Halling contended that Alioto and Reilly had used the trial ``as
a platform for slander.''
</P>
<P>
   Halling labeled as ``outrageous'' Alioto's allegation that the
proposed newspaper deals are ``the product of an enormous political
conspiracy that included at least the Antitrust Division of the
Justice Department, Attorney General Reno, presumably the attorney
general of California, Mayor Brown, Sen. Feinstein, the Fangs and
Hearst.''
</P>
<P>
   Walker on Monday asked the lawyers whether their exemption to
antitrust laws under the Newspaper Preservation Act would still
apply if The Examiner could be made financially sound using changes
proposed by the Fangs.
</P>
<P>
   All the lawyers agreed that the act specified only that one of
the newspapers must be failing at the time the joint operating
agreement was formed.
</P>
<P>
   Walker also asked the lawyers to brief him on whether the act
protects two clauses in the Hearst-Chronicle joint operating
agreement.
</P>
<P>
   The first gives each partner the ``first right of refusal,'' or
chance to outbid any offer for the other partner's paper. The
second prohibits any partner in the agreement from owning another
paper within a 60-mile radius of San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Alioto had argued that the clauses are inconsistent with the act
and allowed Hearst to gain a monopoly by unfairly blocking
potential suitors for the Chronicle.
</P>
<P>
   Halling argued that the clauses are standard contract language,
and in effect were allowed by Congress when it passed the act.
</P>
<P>
   The 60-mile clause, he said, was meant merely to ensure that the
partners in the agreement avoided conflicts of interest that might
arise if they owned nearby papers.
</P>
<P>
   Halling cited testimony by Jill Greenthal, of the Donaldson,
Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette financial investment firm, in which she said she
believed the clauses had no significant effect on her marketing of
the Chronicle. Greenthal said Hearst's $660 million offer was a
fair price and the highest bid.
</P>
<P>
   However, J. Thomas Rosch, a Chronicle lawyer, argued that the
Newspaper Preservation Act protects only functions necessary for
running the newspapers, such as printing, advertising and
distribution.
</P>
<P>
   Rosch said the 60-mile and first-right-of-refusal clauses are
not protected, and must meet traditional antitrust principles. If
he is right, that would mean the clauses are potentially more
vulnerable to being nullified by Walker.

 &HT;    ADMINISTRATION, CRITICS SPAR OVER SNOWMOBILING IN NATIONAL PARKS
 &HT;    By MIRIAM A. GARCIA
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration believes snowmobiling
should be limited in national parks, but critics said Thursday that
any cutback could cause economic harm and unfairly limit access to
nature.
</P>
<P>
   A Clinton administration official told a House hearing that
snowmobiles generate significant levels of air and noise pollution,
often harass wildlife and disturb visitors' desire for solitude.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Barry, a U.S. Interior Department assistant secretary,
said his agency wants to strictly enforce regulations on
recreational snowmobiling in the parks.
</P>
<P>
   But, referring to two of the nation's most popular parks _ Grand
Teton and Yellowstone _ he said the Interior Department will not
make any final decisions about those parks until the agency's
National Park Service has completed an environmental impact
statement.
</P>
<P>
   At the hearing, snowmobile supporters said restricting their use
also means restricting visitors' access to national parks during
the winter.
</P>
<P>
   `` Unless you are 20 years old and can walk through five to 10
feet of snow, you need a snowmobile to get around,'' said Bill
Manson from the American Council of Snowmobile Associations. ``And
that is denying us access to the parks.''
</P>
<P>
   In response, Barry said: ``This is not about closing national
parks to the American public....It is about complying with the
law.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry acknowledged that the National Park Service has not
enforced its own restrictions which limit snowmobiling. But that is
understandable, he said, because ``there has never been
encouragement or support'' for strict enforcement.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is important that we preserve our resources for future
generations,'' Barry said.
</P>
<P>
   The parks were created to preserve nature and allow people to
experience them in their natural state, said Michael Scott of the
Greater Yellowstone Coalition, an environmental group based in
Bozeman, Mont.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to accommodate ever-increasing visitor numbers in the
next century, parks must identify modes of visitor access which do
not endanger precious park natural resources,'' Scott said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Helen Chenoweth-Hage, R-Idaho, said new snowmobile models
can be built to reduce emissions and noise without hurting the
snowmobile economy, which several witnesses put at $800 million a
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``These policies hurt rural Idaho, they hurt our economies and
our communities and they destroy the wonderful winter sport that is
enjoyed by thousands of Americans,'' she said.

CELEBRATIONS, AND SOME TENSION, ALONG ISRAELI-LEBANESE BORDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also ISRAEL-LEBANON) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIRUT, Lebanon _ As the Israeli troop withdrawal settled into a
reality, the Lebanese proudly celebrated a new holiday, National
Resistance Day, with a jubilant rally Thursday at the now empty
Khiam prison, which is notorious here for the reported torture of
guerrilla fighters by Israel's Lebanese militia allies.
</P>
<P>
   Cheering, flag-waving throngs defiantly transformed the place
that the Lebanese saw as a nightmarish symbol of their 22-year-long
occupation into the venue for a victory party. The prison, it was
announced Thursday, will be preserved in all its sordid disarray as
a monument to the depths of the misery that they overcame.
</P>
<P>
   A guarded hopefulness transfused the country as Lebanese tasted
the possibility that they might be entering a rare era _ however
limited _ without bloodshed. Beneath the hope, however, lay the
fear that Israel's threats to treat cross-border fire as an ``act
of war'' meant that the stakes were now much higher.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born in 1975,'' said Maya Abishaheen, a political
scientist in Beirut. ``And all I've seen is war. Maybe this is the
first day in my life when a bomb or a machine gun wasn't aimed at
someone in my country. It is such happiness. But we are so afraid.
Maybe now all it takes is a Katyusha rocket and they can wipe us
off the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Low-level tensions surfaced at the Israeli-Lebanese border
itself as the exuberance here mixed with the palpable hostility
toward Israel. In Kfar Kila, barely 10 feet from the Israeli town
of Metulla, curiosity seekers mingled with guerrilla fighters and
free-lance hooligans to create an alternately festive and
provocative scene.
</P>
<P>
   First some youths lobbed Israeli-grown melons back over the
border. Then the melons gave way to stones and firebombs, the
Israelis said in a complaint to the U.N. officials here. The U.N.
representatives asked key resistance leaders to hold back their
members, which they did, but the crowd was not solely theirs.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side of the barbed-wire fences along the border,
the Israeli parliament held a special meeting in the northern
border town of Kiryat Shemona, where Prime Minister Ehud Barak and
other officials said they hoped that Lebanon would see the
withdrawal as a gesture of peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``I appeal to you, President Emile Lahoud,'' Barak said. ``Let's
exploit the moment. Let's talk peace.''
</P>
<P>
   But for the Lebanese, peace with Israel is not yet part of the
vocabulary; it would be too abrupt. ``In Lebanon, the last shots
fired were two days ago,'' said Timor Goeksl, who has been the
spokesman for the U.N. forces in Lebanon since arriving on a
six-month assignment in 1978. ``There are a lot of dead, wounded
and destroyed people. It's going to be a long time before their
feelings of distrust and hostility go away.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Despite Barak's extended hand, the deep-seated suspicions on
both sides are mirror images of each other. Israelis see the Shiite
Muslim guerrillas who fought them in southern Lebanon as hell-bent
on violently challenging Israel's very existence; the occupation
was their excuse, Israelis say, which is why the Lebanese are now
coming up with reasons to invalidate the withdrawal and justify
continued fighting.
</P>
<P>
   The Lebanese see Israel as a military powerhouse and occupier of
Arab lands, which has now promised to seize on any provocation to
re-occupy their territory or bombard them mercilessly. The
withdrawal is not a gesture of peace, they say, but a delayed
compliance with a U.N. resolution that ordered them out in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   A prominent, sophisticated Beirut journalist recounted, with
bemusement, what her young daughter said when she told her about
the withdrawal: ``Where will the Israelis go now, Mommy? To someone
else's land?'' The Hezbollah leaders, who have been careful to
present the Israeli retreat as a Lebanese victory and not just
theirs, are riding high. If outsiders like the Americans and the
Israelis label them as Iran-backed and Syrian-abetted terrorists,
here they are part of the social and political establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Dozens of Shiite Muslim sheiks granted interviews Thursday
during live coverage of the festivities, and they sounded as if
they were campaigning. Indeed, with parliamentary elections ahead
in August, they fully intend to capitalize on the moment. The
Shiite Muslim parties now hold 32 of 128 seats; six of those belong
to Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   In a scene that dramatized the precipitate changes of the last
few days, Iran's foreign minister, Kamal Kharrazi, flanked by the
Hezbollah fighters that his nation helped train, toured Lebanon's
border with Israel. He drove at the head of a motorcade through the
zone that Israel occupied until Wednesday, proclaiming the
withdrawal a ``victory for the region and the whole Islamic
world.'' At one point, the foreign minister left his car, climbed a
hill and gazed across at Israeli settlements with a smile.
</P>
<P>
   The television coverage of events in the south included clips
from this week's tumultuous events spliced into a music video of a
Lebanese pop singer crooning a jaunty tune: ``You should know,
invaders, who you are and who we are,'' the slick star sang under
disco lights. ``Humiliation has never been one of our traits.''
</P>
<P>
   Lebanese officials sent 100 additional police officers to the
southern zone, more than doubling the size of the force to address
the residents' fears of lawlessness. It was a sign that the
government was willing to move into the area even if it was not
ready to send troops there. But Hezbollah and other resistance
groups far outnumbered the officials, and they manned the
checkpoints and kept the order, even as their minions let loose
daylong fireworks from their automatic weapons.
</P>
<P>
   U.N. troops, whose number will increase to 7,900 from 4,500,
will not deploy to the border until the United Nations certifies
that the Israeli withdrawal is complete and Lebanon accepts its
certification. But they ran frequent patrols Thursday far deeper
into the zone than they were ever stationed, and nobody complained.
</P>
<P>
   Smiling broadly, the foreign soldiers in the blue helmets waved
at the Lebanese flocking into the south like tourists. ``Good, good
for you,'' a Ghanaian soldier kept repeating. Like the Finns and
the Indians and the Irish troops, he did not hide his relief at
spending his first day in the region freely above ground and not
hunkered down in bunkers during the daily cross-fire.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Stationed for 20 years on the northern edge of the zone, the
soldiers also appreciated moving into the heart of the area they
are supposed to monitor. Their supervisors, though, are wary about
the thousands of mines and the unexposed ordinance that lie
scattered along the border. U.N. officials here have secured maps
of some minefields from the Israelis and made urgent requests for
an engineering unit to de-mine the area.
</P>
<P>
   The United Nations' Middle East envoy, Terje Roed-Larsen, met
with Lebanese officials Thursday to discuss how to expand the
troops' role and ease the way for the Lebanese government to
reassert its authority over the area. According to the Lebanese
prime minister, Selim al-Hoss, Hezbollah will also coordinate its
role with the U.N. forces and the government.
</P>
<P>
   Larsen made no comments after the meetings. He was peppered with
questions about Israeli radio reports earlier Thursday that Barak
had told foreign leaders that Israel would consider leaving the
Shebaa Farms region at the edge of the Golan Heights to avoid
prolonging the conflict. Lebanon has claimed the territory as its
own, even though it was under Syrian control when Israel occupied
the Golan.
</P>
<P>
   Barak's office denied the radio reports.

BARAK APPEALS TO LEBANON'S PRESIDENT: `LET US TALK PEACE' 
</HEADLINE>
 (See also LEBANON)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel _ Offering an olive branch to Lebanon a
day after withdrawing Israeli troops from its soil, Prime Minister
Ehud Barak of Israel traveled to this norther border town Thursday
and appealed to the Lebanese president, Emile Lahoud, to ``turn
over a new leaf'' and begin peace talks.
</P>
<P>
   Barak addressed the Israeli parliament at its first plenary
session held outside Jerusalem, convened here to show support for
communities on Israel's northern frontier.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of this working-class town, hardened by years of
crossborder rocket attacks by guerrillas in Lebanon, expressed
skepticism that the withdrawal would bring lasting calm. One
demonstrator greeted the prime minister with a sign: ``Barak is
gambling with our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Addressing the legislators in a local auditorium, Barak made his
peace overture.
</P>
<P>
   ``From this podium at Qiryat Shemona, the city that was the main
target of aggression and terror from Lebanon, I appeal to the
government and people of Lebanon: We have left all your country's
territory up to the international border that is recognized by the
United Nations,'' Barak said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't covet a single inch of your land, we have no demands
of you, except to strictly preserve security along our common
border.
</P>
<P>
   ``I call on you, President Emile Lahoud: Israel extends its hand
in peace, with the vision of a common future that will be better
for the children of both peoples. Let us talk peace. Israel is not
an enemy of Lebanon.''
</P>
<P>
   Barak said that Israeli troops had only entered Lebanon because
it had become ``a hothouse for terror organizations and a base for
aggression against us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we have an opportunity to turn over a new leaf,'' Barak
said. ``This depends on us, on you and on the Syrian government.''
Syria, which is the dominant power in Lebanon, is thought to be
highly unlikely to sanction peace talks between Lebanon and Israel
as long as its own negotiations with Israel to recover the Golan
Heights remain suspended.
</P>
<P>
   As Barak tried to turn the withdrawal to diplomatic advantage,
he received a cool reception from residents here, who are worried
that guerrillas might now attack them from across the border fence,
even though not a shot has been fired since the pullout.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting a falafel stand for a chat on the street, Barak was
asked by a woman whether he thought his ``gamble would pay off.''
</P>
<P>
   Yossi Gavrieli, from the neighboring community of Margaliot,
said that he expected crossborder shooting at Israeli army patrols.
Yitzhak Ohana predicted that Syria would sponsor guerrilla violence
to press Israel into returning the Golan Heights. He held up a sign
that said ``We welcome the boys home, but what about my children?''
</P>
<P>
   Tamir Raymond shouted at Barak: ``Come live here.'' He
complained that the prime minister only visited Qiryat Shemona when
it was politically convenient.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah and other armed groups in Lebanon will never leave
Israel in peace, Ohana insisted. ``The Arabs don't want us here,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Up the road at Metulla, a community separated by a fence from a
Lebanese village, Kafr Kila, there were demonstrations across the
border. Youths raised the yellow flags of Hezbollah on the fence
and hurled invective at people on the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
   ``You will all die,'' shouted a youth.
</P>
<P>
   Smoke rose from an abandoned Israeli base that had been sacked
by villagers. Mobs of youths roamed the base and climbed the border
fence, taunting Israeli soldiers and pelting them with old shoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``God is great,'' they shouted. ``Death to Israel.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the crowd was a group of Palestinians from the Ein
al-Hilweh refugee camp near Sidon. Born and raised in the camp,
they had come to the border with Israel to get a look at what they
consider their homeland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today I am looking at my country for the first time,'' said
one man. ``For the first time, I feel like a human being.''

&HT;     JUDGING CLINTON, AGAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By MARIANNE MEANS  
 &HT;     c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The trouble with determining an appropriate legal
punishment for Bill Clinton's notorious misdeeds is that no one is
neutral toward this most polarizing of presidents.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was painfully obvious this week when a committee
overseeing the practice of law in Arkansas recommended that he be
disbarred, the harshest penalty possible and one seldom imposed.
</P>
<P>
   A member of the six-person panel insisted that the group
``approached this as we would any other lawyer.'' Sure. And cows
can fly.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton isn't just any other lawyer, as everyone knows. It's a
safe bet there's not a soul in Arkansas, let alone the entire
country, who doesn't love him or loathe him.
</P>
<P>
   Who could be indifferent to or ignorant of the soap opera that
is his presidency?
</P>
<P>
   The committee cited Clinton's ``serious misconduct'' as grounds
for disbarment, specifically the fact that he lied under oath in a
deposition in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case by denying he
had a sexual relationship with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky. The president will fight the recommendation, which his
advisers feel is excessively punitive and unfair.
</P>
<P>
   There are two sides to this. On the one hand, he is being held
to a tough standard because as president he is expected to set an
example and has a greater obligation to tell the truth than less
visible lawyers. On the other hand, lawyerly deceptions are rather
common, and he has a civil right to be treated fairly and not
punished by a negative double standard simply because of who he is.
</P>
<P>
   The federal judge who held him in contempt of court for failing
to tell the truth, Susan Webber Wright, recommended ``disciplinary
proceedings'' by the Arkansas bar, but did not argue for
disbarment. She was understandably irritated by the fact that some
of those lies were delivered in her presence.
</P>
<P>
   Several levels of sanctions are available, and clearly Clinton
deserves one of them. But the others are not as draconian as
denying the former law professor and state attorney general a
license to practice law. He says he doesn't intend to do so after
he leaves the White House, but it's the humiliation of the thing
that bugs him.
</P>
<P>
   More common penalties are reprimands and suspensions for a
specified period, which go into lawyers' records and inhibit their
ability to attract clients but do not freeze them out of their
chosen professional livelihood.
</P>
<P>
   In Arkansas, even lawyers who have defrauded clients and been
sent to jail usually _ although not always _ have been given a
legal slap on the wrist rather than disbarred.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing exactly parallels Bill Clinton's situation. How
could it? This guy invented new stuff, never before exposed as
presidential behavior. (Other presidents, we know in retrospect,
also strayed from their marital loyalties but were never caught so
decisively and spectacularly.)
</P>
<P>
   Conservatives like to compare Clinton with Richard Nixon to make
Clinton look worse and Nixon better, but Clinton does not have the
criminal instincts that Nixon did. Nixon was disbarred after being
named an unindicted co-conspirator by a grand jury for his
knowledge of a break-in at Democratic offices in the Watergate
complex and for impeding the investigation and obstructing justice.
He also demanded that his aides punish those on his enemies list,
he illegally tape-recorded associates, and he encouraged a second
break-in. We are talking real crimes here.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's sins are moral lapses, those of a selfish, powerful
man long accustomed to preying upon usually compliant women not his
wife. In this, he is like former Speaker Newt Gingrich, who had an
affair with a House staffer while simultaneously demanding
Clinton's impeachment for essentially the same behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, conservatives say, is that Gingrich never lied
about it under oath. He was certainly just as disingenuous. But he
was never asked about it under oath. So here we split the legal
hairs.
</P>
<P>
   And that is the crux of Clinton's problem. Does lying under oath
stand alone as an unforgivable legal sin or do the subject matter
and the circumstances have any relevance? This was a personally
embarrassing subject, but his false testimony did not hurt a client
financially. Nor did it ultimately matter to anyone except the
perpetrator himself and his wife.
</P>
<P>
   But is it possible to treat a defiant president close to
retirement and loss of power just like any other lawyer on an issue
that is so emotionally and politically divisive? Or will the
temptation to bring him down overcome common sense and judicial
balance?
</P>
<P>
   The decision will be made by a few people with judicial power,
who themselves are part of the social elite and responsive to
political pressures both for and against Clinton. It is unrealistic
to expect that they will approach this latest chapter in the
Clinton saga opinion-free on the subject of our Bill.

MIELKE, FORMER CHIEF OF STASI, DEAD AT 92
</HEADLINE>
  By DAVID BINDER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Erich Mielke, the former head of the dreaded East German
security agency known as the Stasi, has died at age 92, officials
in the German capital said. The Kurier daily said that Mielke died
four days ago in a home for the elderly in his native Berlin.
</P>
<P>
   From 1957 until the Berlin Wall fell in 1989, the Stasi wielded
enormous power, making Mielke the most influential person in East
Germany after the Communist Party leader, Erich Honecker.
</P>
<P>
   Born into poverty in pre-World War I Berlin, Mielke joined the
Communist youth movement at age 15 and still praised Stalin long
after his massive crimes were exposed. Mielke's career epitomized
the grimness of Communist rule in East Germany, where
assassination, kidnapping, execution, denunciation and intimidation
were instruments used to achieve and maintain power under the long,
menacing shadow of the Soviet Union.
</P>
<P>
   Mielke's Ministry for State Security kept the 16.5 million
people of East Germany obedient to Communism and repressed dissent
for more than 30 years. Not only did it pursue an effective
campaign against those it regarded as enemies of the state, but its
army of 90,000 agents and 260,000 informers also turned East
Germany into a country that spied on itself.
</P>
<P>
   The Stasi system of informants, many of them coerced, spread
suspicion and betrayal throughout the society _ between spouses,
between schoolmates, between office colleagues _ that outlasted the
East German state, which effectively collapsed when the Berlin Wall
fell, and formally ceased to exist when Germany reunified in
October 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Mielke's creed, expressed to subordinates in 1982 and recorded
for Stasi archives, was, ``All this twaddle about no executions and
no death sentences, it's all junk, comrades. Execute, if need be
without a court sentence.''
</P>
<P>
   The authorities of reunited Germany arrested Mielke, but poor
health and alleged senility saved him from going on trial on
several charges linked to his Stasi activities, including human
rights abuses, fraud and embezzlement, and culpability in the
killing of Germans trying to escape west across East Germany's
heavily-guarded borders.
</P>
<P>
   But when he did go to jail in 1992, it was not for the orders he
gave his Stasi agents, but for the part he played in the killing of
two policemen in Berlin 61 years earlier, in August 1931.
</P>
<P>
   Although only 5 feet 4 inches tall, Mielke, was then a muscular
23-year-old member of a Communist unit trained in firearms and
street fighting. More than 20 Communists were eventually brought to
trial in connection with the killings, but Mielke escaped to the
Soviet Union before he could be arrested.
</P>
<P>
   The Berlin prosecutors brought Mielke to trial for the 1931
killings shortly after German unification, relying in part on
evidence gathered years earlier by the Gestapo.,
</P>
<P>
   At his trial, the 84-year-old Mielke was carried in and out of
the courtroom, but independent physicians said he was simulating
illness.
</P>
<P>
   He was convicted of the 1931 murders and sentenced to six years
in prison. He never testified and never admitted to a role in the
police killings.
</P>
<P>
   The judge who presided over his murder trial, Theodor Seidel,
said in pronouncing sentence that Mielke ``will go down in history
as one of the most fearsome dictators and police ministers of the
20th century.''
</P>
<P>
   Mielke reportedly was morose in his cell at the old Moabit
prison, where warders supplied him with a red telephone, the kind
he had enjoyed as a member of the East German Communist Politburo,
but not connected outside. ``He began dialing and conducting
imaginary conversations,'' a police official said, ``and soon he
brightened up.'' His other pastime was watching television game
shows.
</P>
<P>
   Erich Mielke was born on Dec. 28, 1907 in a tenement in western
Berlin. His father was a woodworker from West Prussia. His mother
died after the birth of another son.
</P>
<P>
   He was a good student, permitted to attend a privileged high
school. But he left voluntarily at aged 16 after joining the
Communist Youth Association, and began work at a transport firm.
</P>
<P>
   At 19 he was an active street agitator and member of the
Communist party, which then got one-third of the vote in Berlin
elections, compared to one-sixth for the Nazis.
</P>
<P>
   After escaping to Moscow in 1931, he took the name Paul Bach,
and attended the International Lenin School for two years to
prepare for a career in the security services. The Soviets sent him
to Spain at the beginning of the civil war in 1936. In 1939, Mielke
made his way to France, where he was interned following the German
invasion. He escaped and, with false papers, worked as a woodcutter
until he was picked up again by German authorities in late 1943 and
placed in a forced labor unit. A month after the end of the war, he
got to the Soviet Zone of Occupation _ East Germany _ and was
immediately employed as a People's Police Inspector.
</P>
<P>
   With the approval of the Soviets, who fostered his career from
the outset, he was assigned to help build the East German political
police, and rose steadily over the next decade, becoming Minister
for State Security in 1957.
</P>
<P>
   During his years of power, he expected to be addressed as
``Comrade Minister Army General.'' He lived in a heavily guarded
settlement for party leaders at Wandlitz, north of Berlin, and shot
game at a special preserve nearby. He was devoted to Stalin and was
recorded toasting the Soviet leader in 1970, long after his crimes
were exposed.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way he personally conducted interrogations of errant
party comrades, some of whom were executed. ``I'll chop your head
off!'' he said during one such session, according to a 1995 profile
of him in Der Spiegel magazine.
</P>
<P>
   He had an uneasy, cautious relationship, with Markus Wolf, the
legendary head of Stasi's foreign intelligence operations. Mielke
said he forced Wolf to resign; Wolf said in his 1997 autobiography,
``Man Without a Face,'' that he left the service in 1986 of his own
free will, and that was the official version.
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1989, Mielke was said to have played a role in
the ouster by the ruling Communist Party's Politburo of Erich
Honecker, the head of the party and the state.At a critical moment
at a meeting of the Politburo, of which Mielke was a full member
for 13 years, he took out an old , Stasi dossier that said Honecker
collaborated with the Gestapo when he was a political prisoner of
the Nazis in the Brandenburg penitentiary during World War II. He
put the file on the table and that, said participants, helped to
sway the vote against Honecker, who was replaced by Egon Krenz.
</P>
<P>
   Just weeks later, the leadership opened the Berlin Wall, and the
German Democratic Republic swiftly became history.
</P>
<P>
   Years later in a prison visitors' room, Mielke said, ``If the
party had given me the task, then there would perhaps still be a
GDR today. On that you can rely.''
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Gertrude, and a son, Frank.

   `American Beauty' in Short Supply
</P>
<P>
   ``American Beauty,'' Sam Mendes and Alan Ball's singular view of
suburbia, is video's top renter this week _ and that's with one
hand tied behind its back. Walk into Blockbuster stores around the
country and you will see only a fraction of the ``American Beauty''
boxes you might have. In some Blockbuster stores, you will find
``American Beauty,'' the Academy Award winner, only under the front
counter.
</P>
<P>
   The shortage has to do with revenue sharing. In the past
retailers bought cassettes and kept all the rental proceeds. Now
they buy the tapes at a much lower price, and share rental revenues
with the studios. In that way they can afford to supply many more
copies, thereby averting a major customer complaint.
</P>
<P>
   For various undisclosed reasons _ and price was not the only
factor _ Blockbuster and DreamWorks, which owns ``American
Beauty,'' could not reach a revenue-sharing agreement. So
Blockbuster bought ``American Beauty'' cassettes the more expensive
old-fashioned way, which means fewer copies in its stores.
</P>
<P>
   Since Blockbuster accounts for about 40 percent of the rental
market, any sizable drop in copies available in its stores
obviously depresses rental totals.
</P>
<P>
   Other chains and stores are carrying a full supply of the film.
A spokeswoman for DreamWorks said there were about one million
copies of ``American Beauty'' in circulation. In normal
circumstances Blockbuster might account for 400,000 copies, but
then the overall total could well have been higher had the chain
bought as many copies as usual.
</P>
<P>
   Blockbuster will not disclose how many copies of ``American
Beauty'' it displays. In urban stores 60 or more boxes may be on
the shelves, but ordinarily the number would have been considerably
higher. In some stores where ``American Beauty,'' an R-rated film,
is not in such high demand, the relatively few copies are kept
under the counter and must be requested.
</P>
<P>
   A Blockbuster spokeswoman said that keeping the videos up front
helped store managers explain the situation to customers
individually, but she added that concealment was also for
appearance's sake. ``We figured there would be so few up there, it
would just exacerbate the situation,'' she said.
</P>

   Canadians' Music
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago Video Artists International, a distributor of
classical music and dance videos in Pleasantville, N.Y., began to
release programs from the archives of the Canadian Broadcasting
Co.'s English-language network. Now it's the turn of the CBC's
French network, which began its renowned music broadcasts in 1952.
Next week Video Artists International will begin to release tapes
by the pianists Alfred Brendel, Claudio Arau and Rosalyn Tureck;
the violinists Joseph Szigeti, Christian Ferras and Ida Haendel;
the singers Marilyn Horne, Leontyne Price and Jon Vickers; the
conductors Igor Markevitch, Charles Munch and Josef Krips; and many
others.
</P>
<P>
   In one of the broadcasts, recorded in 1976, the pianist Martha
Argerich performs Schumann's Piano Concerto and music by Liszt and
Ravel. Information: (800) 477-7146.

   NEW RELEASES
</P>
<P>
   Man on the Moon Jim Carrey delivers an electrifying homage to
the comedian Andy Kaufman, but Milos Forman's film fails to answer
the question of who Kaufman was or how he got that way. All the
material is here: the uncanny impersonations, the wrestling matches
with women, the bombastic tirades of Kaufman's trash-talking alter
ego, the lounge singer Tony Clifton. But this remains a
surprisingly straightforward show-business rise-and-fall story. As
entertaining as that can be, Janet Maslin wrote in The New York
Times, it ``limits the film's ability to give Kaufman three
dimensions.''

   Snow Falling on Cedars
</P>
<P>
   Scott Hicks' stunningly beautiful film, based on David
Guterson's novel, makes the mistake of retaining the book's
intricate flashbacks, which proves disruptive. In 1950 a young
Japanese-American (Rick Yune) stands trial for murder on the
fictitious San Piedro Island north of Puget Sound. That attracts
the interest of a journalist (Ethan Hawke), who years earlier had
an affair with the defendant's wife (Youki Kudoh) and relates to
the internment of Japanese-Americans during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   But the darting back and forth doesn't serve an adaptation that
is ``admirably high-minded and visually gorgeous but fatally
anesthetized by its own grandiosity'' (Stephen Holden).

</P>
<P>
   ``The American Dream stays with me each and every day,'' says
Mark Borchardt, the funny, garrulous subject of his own
documentary. For him, one of the those big, sterile houses he
craves will be just reward for the no-budget ``Blair Witch
Project'' knock-off he is making with the assistance of his Uncle
Bill and anyone else he can enlist. Along the way we discover
Borchardt, his own best character, in a film that by its end ``has
blossomed into much more than a portrait of one fiendishly
determined filmmaker'' (Maslin).

   In Mike Figgis' adaptation of Strindberg's drama, a wealthy
count's imperious, neurotic daughter (Saffron Burrows) spars
sexually with her virile, opportunistic footman, Jean (Peter
Mullan). These days the pairing might have at least led to some hot
sex, but here it is cause for a repressed, emotionally
sadomasochistic ritual of humiliation. Nor does haste help. ``The
dialogue may be crisply idiomatic, but there's finally nothing
realistic about the speed with which the characters hurtle through
their mood swings and power plays'' (Holden).

   DEVIL'S ISLAND. With its trailer trash Icelandic style, Fridrik
Thor Fridriksson's film carves a vividly realized slice of life out
of the bleak landscape of Camp Thule near Reykjavik, an American
military base where, as Garrison Keillor might put it, the men are
drunks, the women unhappy and the children dysfunctional.
Nevertheless, they're a lively lot who number a witch who curses
God, a mother of three who escapes by marrying an American pilot
and her two grown sons, a boozy brawler and a shy, quiet potential
hero. The cast, Lawrence Van Gelder wrote in The New York Times,
``delivers performances so convincing and un-self-conscious that
`Devil's Island' at times seems to be a documentary.'' 1999.

   AT&AMP;T-MEDIAONE (Washington) _ The Justice Department gave
conditional approval Thursday to AT&AMP;T's $58 billion acquisition of
MediaOne, giving AT&AMP;T control over more than a third of the
nation's cable television market. By Stephen Labaton.
</P>
<P>
   NY-TOBACCO (Albany, N.Y.) _ Gov. George Pataki on Thursday
vetoed a bill that would have made New York the first state to
require that cigarettes meet flammability standards, stunning the
Legislature and prompting Democrats and anti-tobacco groups to
accuse him of protecting the tobacco industry. By Richard
Perez-Pena.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA-TRADE (Washington) _ Folo on the House passage of the
China trade bill and a look forward at possible difficulties in the
Senate. By Eric Schmitt.
</P>
<P>
   BUSH-NUKES (Washington) _ Gov. George W. Bush's proposal this
week to consider unilateral reductions in the American nuclear
arsenal was a bold break with decades of strategic doctrine that
may foretell the end of traditional theories of arms control. By
John M. Broder.
</P>
<P>
   REFORM-PARTY (Tucson, Ariz.) _ The growing likelihood that
Patrick Buchanan will become the presidential nominee of the Reform
Party is producing a backlash from some party members and leaders
around the country. Efforts are under way to derail him and even
those who recognize the inevitability of it all wonder what the
party will look like in the future. There are fears that Buchanan
will force the party to take up social issues like abortion that it
has avoided. Some want Ross Perot to run again, although that
appears unlikely; some like Ralph Nader, and some think the party
should have no nominee at all this year. By Michael Janofsky.
</P>
<P>
   NY-WENDYS-MURDERS (New York) _ Five employees are killed and two
others are wounded in a late-night robbery at a Wendy's restaurant
in Queens. The dead had been herded into a basement walk-in
refrigerator and killed with shots to the head. By David Barstow.

   BROADBAND-HOUSING (Dallas) _ For a growing number of affluent
home buyers, high-speed broadband Internet connections are becoming
as important as a two-car garage, fireplace or new kitchen.
Recognizing this, some developers and builders are jumping into the
telecommunications business. Either by building and owning their
own neighborhood networks, or joining with telecommunications
companies, they are offering high-speed Internet connections,
bundled with cable and phone service, at discounts of up to $20 a
month from what this would otherwise cost. Their efforts are in the
very early stages. How developers eventually do against the
abundance of Baby Bells, cable companies and other providers
fighting to serve the residential market is anyone's guess. By
Richard A. Oppel Jr.

`DIRTY PICTURES': A FILM THAT WANTS TO HAVE IT ALL WAYS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
 By CARYN JAMES   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a decade of culture wars _ politicians nibbling away at
the National Endowment for the Arts, Congress and artists dueling
about what is fit for America to see _ there was a chilling
inexorability to the most recent skirmish, when New York's mayor
tried to cut off financing for the Brooklyn Museum of Art because
of a religious portrait in which one of the artist's materials was
elephant dung.
</P>
<P>
   The issue of public art exhibitions has been so co-opted by
politics, where else could things have gone?
</P>
<P>
   ``Dirty Pictures'' revisits a case that helped set off this
continuing battle: In 1990 the Contemporary Arts Center in
Cincinnati, and its director, Dennis Barrie, were charged with
obscenity after showing Robert Mapplethorpe's photographs, with
images of sadomasochism, homosexuality and naked children.
</P>
<P>
   It may be a sign of how accustomed we have become to such
conflicts that this earnest, pedestrian film is completely unable
to recapture what a galvanizing moment that was for both sides. It
would have taken a work with far more energy and dramatic flair to
convey the shock of that cultural moment.
</P>
<P>
   The film moves in several directions. It is partly a predictable
domestic soap opera. In a restrained performance, James Woods plays
Barrie as a man who never set out to be a crusader, but who feels
morally compelled to defend the First Amendment when he has to.
Though the film depicts both sides of the argument, it is
straightforward in its sympathy for Barrie, this script's hero.
Barrie's wife (Diana Scarwid) is socially ostracized, and their two
young sons are bullied at school. It is only a matter of time
before the patient wife is tossing vases around the living room.
</P>
<P>
   But the film is partly a courtroom drama, partly about politics,
as a conservative sheriff (Craig T. Nelson) goes after the museum,
and it is partly about the largest issue of all. As the forewoman
asks the other jurors about Mapplethorpe's work, ``Is it obscene or
is it art?''
</P>
<P>
   The film intends to show the convergence of all these elements,
but instead dissipates the impact of each.
</P>
<P>
   The title ``Dirty Pictures'' suggests a film that wants to have
it both ways, to be a serious work that titillates and seduces its
audience into paying attention. But it is cautious in its use of
the Mapplethorpe photography, and the images flash by quickly in
several sequences. Some are of flowers, some are portraits of
celebrities _ Susan Sarandon, Susan Sontag, Andy Warhol_ and some
are the images that set off the conflict. The film doesn't dwell on
graphic details; even if you are familiar with the photographs,
they go by so fast they can be difficult to identify.
</P>
<P>
   Frank Pierson, the film's director, also directed Woods in the
much better ``Citizen Cohn.'' Even the attempts at artistic touches
seem tame here: There are stylized images of the jury room, as if
the actors were on a bare stage; talking heads offer comments,
including William F. Buckley Jr., on the conservative side and Rep.
Barney Frank on the liberal side, but they are familiar platitudes.
``If you can't defend what is unpalatable to you personally, then
you don't actually believe in free speech,'' Salman Rushdie says.
</P>
<P>
   As an artist, Mapplethorpe was taken more seriously than most of
those whose work has set off cultural shockwaves. That makes
``Dirty Pictures'' even more of a lost opportunity.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   PICKING UP THE PIECES
</P>
<P>
   There are some movies whose existence is so baffling that ``The
X-Files'' could spend several episodes trying to sort out the
conspiracy theories behind their creation. The mystery behind the
witless, black comedy ``Picking Up the Pieces'' (airing 8 p.m.
Friday on Cinemax) is not why this film has gone straight to cable,
but why so many people who should have known better were sucked
into it.
</P>
<P>
   Woody Allen plays a New York butcher called Tex who has fled to
Texas, where he lives in a trailer with his dog, his 10-gallon hat
and his wife. She is a faithless former Mafia moll named Candy,
played by Sharon Stone with a baby-doll voice. The film looks as if
it took two days to shoot and cost 2 cents to make, though it was
directed by Alfonso Arau (``Like Water for Chocolate'') and shot by
Vittorio Storaro, one of the great cinematographers, whose films
include ``Reds.''
</P>
<P>
   At the start, Tex chops up Candy and scatters her body in the
desert. Soon her severed hand, with its shimmery blue nail polish,
turns up in the New Mexico town of El Nino and begins to perform
miracles. These are not clever miracles, but the kind in which a
flat-chested woman grows breasts before our eyes and a dwarf grows
a gigantic penis _ both discreetly obscured on screen. In no time
the magic hand makes El Nino a tourist mecca, to the delight of the
corrupt mayor (Cheech Marin).
</P>
<P>
   These cliches might seem to offer plenty of possibilities for
irreverent satire, but it would take a miraculous severed hand to
save this script, credited to Bill Wilson who's described by
Cinemax simply as ``a first-time screenwriter.''
</P>
<P>
   The film's humor is always lazy. We see a man in bed with a
beautiful prostitute, and he soon puts on his priest's collar.
Played by David Schwimmer with a slightly less hang-dog expression
than on ``Friends,'' the priest is, of course, in love with the
golden-hearted prostitute.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, a mean Texas sheriff _ toothpick-chewing Kiefer
Sutherland _ goes after Tex. The church sends in investigators,
including a bishop played by Elliot Gould and a nun played by Fran
Drescher, whose unchanging grimace makes hers the worst of the
film's many humorless performances.
</P>
<P>
   Allen has the only funny moments, including a scene in the
confessional. Tex sounds suspiciously like a Woody Allen character,
as if he had doctored his own lines. Maybe if he had rewritten and
directed the entire film, it might have added up to something.
</P>
<P>
   Did they all make a pact with the devil? Did someone drug their
drinks at a Hollywood party and make them sign contracts while
hallucinating? Whatever they thought going in, all the actors look
uneasy on screen, as if they were on a plane plummeting from the
sky and were putting on brave faces while they crash. &QL;

TRIPLETS (Undated) - Doctors are delivering triplets too early,
according to Phoenix Dr. John Elliott in a report presented at the
American College of obstetricians and Gynecologists' meeting in San
Francisco. Mothers of triplets are pleading with doctors to deliver
them at 30 or 31 weeks because they are in such discomfort, but
Elliott says that doctors shouldn't give in. Early births are too
costly and babies have more health problems as a result, he says.

SERBIA'S DIVIDED OPPOSITION CAN NOT AGREE ON PLAN OF ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The leaders of the democratic opposition
in Serbia are divided about how to respond to the government's
seizure of the main opposition television station, undercutting
their credibility and damaging the image of unity they are trying
to project to voters and the West.
</P>
<P>
   There are sharp internal arguments about the dangers of a
confrontation with the government of Slobodan Milosevic, the
Yugoslav president. Some leaders favor a more systematic program of
civil disobedience, including hunger strikes. Others press for a
negotiated settlement with Milosevic that might bring early
elections under fairer conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of the television station, Studio B (including Radio
B2-92's transmission facility in Belgrade), and the continuing
attack on the independent print media have also opened new
divisions about the wisdom of taking part in local and federal
elections when they are called, probably this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller parties grouped in the Alliance for Change generally
favor going to elections in any conditions. But the largest
opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic,
now says in internal debates that it would be impossible to take
part in elections under these conditions, say political leaders who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In general, these leaders said, Draskovic _ who had sworn to
defend Studio B, which he controlled and which was lavish in its
coverage of him and his party _ is opposed to any plan of
confrontation that would give Milosevic a further pretext for a
general crackdown. Already, the government says it is drafting a
new law on terrorism that could be used to detain individuals for
60 days without charges. It is also drafting a new law banning
foreign financing for nongovernmental organizations here, which
tend to promote democracy, human rights and civil society.
</P>
<P>
   The popular student movement, Otpor, or Resistance, is pressing
for civil disobedience, including the blocking of roads and a halt
to urban services like water, electricity, transport and garbage
collection. Zoran Djindjic, leader of the Democratic Party, the
largest within the Alliance for Change coalition, has also called
for civil disobedience. Draskovic is allied to the Alliance but is
not a member.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic is said to be concerned for two reasons. First, that a
tired, depressed, poor population will not follow the political
opposition's call to arms, and second, that a growing crisis would
favor the Serbian deputy prime minister, Vojislav Seselj, the head
of the nationalist Radical Party. Draskovic apparently believes
that a deal, with Russian pressure, may still be possible with
Milosevic's Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   But some other leaders believe that Draskovic is simply afraid
to lose control over Belgrade and its lucrative concessions, and
that he would rather do a deal with Milosevic, still hoping to
succeed him, than confront him and risk arrest. ``He's trading
Studio B for kiosks,'' one leader said bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, Djindjic and Vojislav Kostunica of the Democratic
Party of Serbia, are scheduled to travel to Moscow on Monday, to
seek Russian support. They intend to ask the Russian government of
President Vladimir Putin to press Milosevic for the return of
Studio B and early, democratic elections on all levels, said a
Draskovic adviser. Predrag Simic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moscow has leverage over both the regime and the opposition
and is in a good position to mediate,'' Simic said.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Monday, opposition leaders disagreed even about the
wisdom of having the large rally in Belgrade they announced for
Saturday. The rally will go ahead, but the opposition leaders say
they have not agreed on a plan of action to announce there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst of both worlds,'' one leader said. ``Some
argued that if we're not willing to fight hard with civil
disobedience, using local city councils under our control, then we
should just cancel the rally and say so, and then put our resources
into preparing for elections. But we're going ahead with the rally
with nothing new to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the opposition is also its strength. There are
16 leaders from a wide variety of parties of varying size.
Inevitably, joint decisions are ``lowest common denominator,''
another leader said.
</P>
<P>
   But given that Draskovic controls the largest party, with the
most votes, any concerted program of civil disobedience or
electioneering is less likely to succeed without him, said a leader
of the Alliance for Change.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the Alliance, who generally favor a more robust
challenge to the regime and participation in elections under almost
any circumstances, are considering whether to distance themselves
from Draskovic. That might help them refurbish their credibility
with some in the electorate, but it would also weaken the image of
unity that voters, who generally dislike the Milosevic government,
find attractive.
</P>
<P>
   A third opposition group, led by former army generals and
government officials who have broken with Milosevic, is trying to
distance itself from the Draskovic-Alliance squabbling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and the European Union have pressed
the opposition hard, in part through the aid they provide, to stick
together. After last summer's efforts to oust Milosevic through
daily rallies failed _ rallies Draskovic opposed _ the West came to
a consensus that elections were the best way to undermine Milosevic
and oust him.
</P>
<P>
   But the seizure of Studio B and increasing pressure against the
independent daily newspapers Blic and Glas Javnosti have made
Draskovic question the idea of taking part in any elections. While
such a position could change _ elections haven't been called _ his
position is a reversal of 1997, when Djindjic boycotted Serbian
elections against U.S. advice and Draskovic took part, validating
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have made it clear they don't want civil war,'' said a
Draskovic adviser. ``Free and fair elections are the best means to
overthrow Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   But one Alliance leader said, ``This is another gift for
Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many people who think they can be the Serbian
Putin and get power through a deal,'' he said, mentioning
Draskovic, Djindjic and Seselj. ``And there are some opposition
politicians who are politically dead but don't know it yet.''

FRESH LOOK AT DEFENSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If the ideas on security that George W. Bush offered Tuesday are
indicative of the coming presidential campaign, the election may be
more interesting and substantive than the pundits are predicting.
</P>
<P>
   Bush might be tantalizingly vague about some matters, but the
issues he addressed concern the gravest responsibilities of a
commander-in-chief. As Bush properly noted, there is a need to
question premises of the nation's nuclear doctrine that have
remained largely unchanged and unexamined since the sudden end of
the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   One Bush proposal on nuclear missiles that could greatly enhance
the security of Americans is his intention to ``remove as many
weapons as possible from high-alert, hair-trigger status.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger of an accidental or unauthorized missile launch could
be reduced considerably if the United States and Russia took
nuclear warheads off their missiles and stored them separately. A
sensible corollary was Bush's wish to end the launch-on-warning
posture that he called an ``unnecessary vestige of Cold War
confrontation.''
</P>
<P>
   Tactfully, Bush also challenged the Pentagon's anachronistic
insistence on being able to destroy more than 2,000 outdated Soviet
targets many times over with nuclear warheads. ``The premises of
Cold War nuclear targeting should no longer dictate the size of our
arsenal,'' Bush said, justifying a reduction of this country's
strategic nuclear arsenal to the lower numbers _ 1,000 to 1,500
warheads _ that Russia would prefer in a START III treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's expressed will to deploy a grander missile defense system
than the Clinton administration is planning might seem to
contradict his aim of reducing nuclear arsenals. But the silver
lining in his remarks and those of his adviser, Condoleezza Rice,
is a willingness to explore missile defense concepts based on
boost-phase interception of missiles or laser technology. Either
might be more feasible than the current system dependent on
infrared sensors incapable of distinguishing decoys from warheads.
In this as in his other proposals, Bush displays a welcome
inclination to take a fresh look at costly and dangerous old
assumptions.

VISION ON EYE RESEARCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the last several years, US taxpayers have made impressive
investments in medical research, particularly in the quest to cure
or prevent diseases that are the biggest killers. Unfortunately,
proportionately less money has gone into other areas of research,
including diseases of the eye. While overall spending for the
National Institutes of Health has increased by 80 percent since
1985, it has risen by less than 40 percent for the National Eye
Institute.
</P>
<P>
   This is an imbalance that Americans could one day regret, as
baby-boomers approach the stage of life when age-related diseases
are more likely to seriously impair their vision or blind them
altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Glaucoma, which afflicts more than 3 million Americans, takes a
particularly heavy toll among those aged 60 and over. Diabetic
retinopathy is the leading cause of blindness in people aged 25 to
74. The longer a patient lives with diabetes, which is sharply
increasing in incidence, the greater the chances this complication
will develop. Age also increases the likelihood of macular
degeneration, which afflicts fully 30 percent of all Americans over
75. There are 36.2 million Americans with eye diseases now; 45.7
million are expected to suffer from them by 2030.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, much of the progress in treating problems of
vision has come through improvements in surgery. Now, researchers
like those at Boston's Schepens Eye Research Institute expect that
many advances will come through investigation of the biochemistry
and neurobiology that make the miracle of sight possible.
</P>
<P>
   Such research consumes a large share of the National Eye
Institute's $450 million budget. An advocacy group for research in
this area, the Alliance for Eye and Vision Research, contends there
are many research projects deserving of new funding and advocates a
20 percent increase in NEI spending.
</P>
<P>
   Congress ultimately decides how to divvy up Washington's
health-research dollar, with advice from the National Institutes of
Health and others. As overall NIH spending goes up, decisionmakers
in Washington should have the foresight to make sure that vision
itself is not shortchanged.

ON PICKING A VICE PRESIDENT, BUSH CALLS HIMSELF AN `INDEPENDENT
THINKER' 
</HEADLINE>
   By ALISON MITCHELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Faced with a new warning by a prominent
religious conservative against selecting a running mate who
supports abortion, Gov. George W. Bush on Thursday called himself a
``pretty independent thinker'' whose main criterion for choosing a
vice presidential nominee was an ability to assume the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spoke of his vice presidential search as he stood side by
side with retired Gen. Colin Powell, the Republican dream candidate
who refuses to seek elective office. Powell, prompted by reporters'
questions, repeated his desire to see the anti-abortion plank
removed from the Republican platform. And he once again insisted
that he would not be interested in being Bush's running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not a candidate for the vice presidency and I'm not
seeking it,'' said the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of
Staff. ``The governor knows that.'' But Powell left the door open
to consider a Cabinet post. ``In any other capacity one has to
listen when the president asks you to consider a job,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The day's event had not been designed for talk of abortion
politics. In the garden of the governor's mansion, Bush and Powell
were signing an agreement between Texas and America's Promise, the
volunteer group that Powell leads to help the nation's youth.
</P>
<P>
   But the subsequent news conference quickly turned to the
jousting inside the Republican Party over Bush's choice of a
running mate. On Wednesday, James C. Dobson, a prominent religious
conservative, told reporters that Bush ``sounds a whole lot more
conservative when he is talking to conservatives and a whole lot
more moderate when he is talking to moderates.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobson accused Bush, the presumptive Republican presidential
nominee, of sacrificing the party's core principles and called on
him to choose a running mate opposed to abortion. ``The base in the
Republican Party is pro-life,'' he was quoted as saying. ``You
can't have it all and you can't win without that base.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked for his response, Bush did not acknowledge that he shared
Dobson's concerns, nor did he hint where his running mate would
stand on abortion. ``I appreciate advice,'' he said. ``I'm getting
it from all corners. But I'm a pretty independent thinker.''
</P>
<P>
   He insisted his political message is always consistent. ``It's
basically this: we're going to trust people, not government,'' Bush
said.
</P>
<P>
   Pressed several times on whether he was listening to either
conservatives or Republicans' who favor abortion rights, Bush
spelled out some of his criteria for selecting a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking for someone who could be president, someone able
to fill that job,'' he said. ``I'm looking for someone who would be
loyal. I'm looking for someone who brings honesty and integrity to
the office, someone whose judgment I could count upon.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush repeated his position that the Republican platform's plank
against abortion should remain intact. Asked if he agreed, Powell
said: ``I would work to remove it. But good friends can disagree on
issues, so I don't see that there is a big fight over that.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush, who has been positioning himself closer to the political
center, faces a major decision on whether he can afford to select a
running mate, like Gov. Tom Ridge of Pennsylvania, who backs
abortion rights. A New York Times/CBS News survey earlier this
month found that three of every 10 Republican voters polled said
they would be less likely to support Bush if he picks a running
mate who supports legalized abortion.
</P>
<P>
   As reporters tried and failed several times to draw Bush out on
how much he was weighing abortion in his choice of a running mate,
he seemed to grow impatient. ``I'm making an exhaustive search,''
he said. ``I've laid out the characteristics necessary for the vice
presidency. And at some point in time you're going to find out who
it is. And on that cheery note we will end.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But Bush did flatly say, in an interview with The Associated
Press, that he was not considering either Powell or Sen. John
McCain of Arizona, taking them at their word that they did not want
the job.

BRIGHT LIGHT ON CHINA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tucked into the dramatic House vote Wednesday to grant China
permanent normal trade relations is an amendment to establish a
23-member commission that will monitor human rights under the
communist regime in Beijing. That amendment, co-sponsored by
Democrat Sander Levin of Michigan and Republican Doug Bereuter of
Nebraska, should not be discounted as merely a face-saving favor to
members who were hesitant to cast a vote that could be used to
paint them as soft on communism or indifferent to human rights.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that the commission can exercise no leverage over the
commissars who throw citizens into jail for the crime of doing
their breathing exercises and meditation in public. Nor will it be
able to vote each year on renewing that country's
most-favored-nation status. But the vote that Congress did cast
year after year to maintain normal trade relations with China
hardly protected Chinese and Tibetans from the rulers in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, there should be no illusions about what a human
rights monitoring commission can accomplish. But a sign of what its
potential might be was given by the Chinese government, which
called the commission an ``unacceptable'' attempt to ``interfere in
China's internal affairs and damage China's interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission, with members drawn from the House, the Senate,
and the executive branch, is to be modeled on the Helsinki
Commission, which also began with modest expectations when it was
formed in 1975 to examine human rights in the countries of the
Soviet bloc. The Helsinki accords, of course, benefitted from
treaty status and thus obligated communist governments of the
Warsaw Pact to tolerate outside monitoring of their human rights
records.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the new commission envisioned for human rights in
China might be used to assist Chinese democrats and dissidents much
as the Helsinki commission helped the Vaclav Havels and Andrei
Sakharovs behind the Iron Curtain _ by shining a bright, constant
light on their situation.
</P>
<P>
   Now that trade and human rights in China are to be decoupled,
there is more need than ever to show solidarity with the peoples of
China and Tibet.

COMMENTARY: ALL FALL DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By THOMAS L. FRIEDMAN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The last time I was in Israel's former southern Lebanon security
zone I was being driven around by a nervous Israeli army press
officer called Alex in his beat-up old Mercedes. We were barreling
down some road near Merj 'Uyun when an armored personnel carrier
belonging to the Israeli-backed South Lebanon Army came barreling
along the other way. The Lebanese militiamen in the APC weren't
very good drivers and their vehicle swerved and scraped our
Mercedes. We were both going so fast, and the APC was so heavy,
that it knocked the driver's door right off our car. It just went
flying off the hinges. And that was my last image of the security
zone _ being driven around by an Israeli officer in a beat-up
Mercedes with no door.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli security zone in Lebanon was that kind of a place _
slightly makeshift, slightly madcap, part killing field, part
theater of the absurd, a place where everything goes and everything
went. Anyone who thought the Israeli withdrawal there was going to
be neat and clean has simply never been to southern Lebanon. But
don't get caught up in the momentary messiness. That's not the
story. The story is that this Israeli withdrawal is of huge
geopolitical significance for the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   In its own weird way, southern Lebanon has been the keystone of
recent Middle East politics. It held together a whole set of
relationships and made possible the avoidance of a whole set of big
questions. And guess what? Prime Minister Ehud Barak's gutsy and
strategic decision to withdraw Israeli forces unilaterally from the
security zone has just removed this keystone, and now everyone in
the region will have to adjust.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 20 years the security zone has been the Off
Broadway of the Arab-Israeli conflict. It was the place where
Israel and Syria could fight a proxy war, and let off steam, by
killing Lebanese instead of each other. It was a place where the
Syrians could keep the Lebanese Hezbollah fighters busy so they
wouldn't shoot at the Syrians in Lebanon. It was the one border
where Iran, working through Lebanese guerrillas, could draw Israeli
blood. And it was the Israeli occupation of southern Lebanon that
allowed all the Arab governments to tolerate Syria's occupation of
Lebanon. If southern Lebanon hadn't existed, the Arabs and Israelis
would have had to rent Cyprus for the same purposes.
</P>
<P>
   But now watch what happens with the Israelis gone: Syria,
without being able to bleed Israel through southern Lebanon, now
has much less leverage. It either has to go to war with Israel
directly, and risk everything, or move decisively on peace by
accepting Israel's basic terms for a Golan Heights deal. Without
Israel in Lebanon, Syria not only will have a much harder time
justifying and explaining its continued occupation, but the other
Arab states will also have a much harder time explaining why they
could not tolerate Iraq's occupation of Kuwait, but can tolerate
Syria's occupation of Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, meanwhile, has to decide what to do with its victory.
It just evicted Israel from Lebanon, and has earned enormous
prestige from that. Hezbollah has two choices: Push on to Jerusalem
and get totally chewed apart by Israel or turn to Beirut and use
this military victory to leverage a bigger slice of power in
governing Lebanon. My bet: Hezbollah eventually turns toward
Beirut.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Hezbollah's main backer, Iran, must decide
whether to push Hezbollah into war against Israel proper, in which
case Iran will be denounced by France, Lebanon's patron saint, as
well as the United Nations and the whole world community. Or Iran
could focus on strengthening Hezbollah's influence in Lebanon,
which will put it in competition with Syria.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, if the border between Israel and Lebanon stabilizes,
Barak may conclude that unilateral withdrawal might be the best way
to deal with the West Bank as well _ just draw the line that Israel
wants, say goodbye and forget trying to reach a deal with the
Palestinians. Remember: Now that Hezbollah has evicted the Israelis
from southern Lebanon by force, instead of by negotiation, this
will make it much harder for Yasser Arafat to give up any territory
to Israel or make any compromises. He will look like a wimp in Arab
eyes.
</P>
<P>
   And you thought southern Lebanon was just some insignificant
little backwater.

   BEDFORD, Va. _ Weeks of waves had washed the blood from the
beaches of Normandy before townsfolk learned how D-Day had
devastated their peaceful community in the shadow of the Blue Ridge
Mountains.
</P>
<P>
   It was the middle of the summer of 1944. Elizabeth Teass was
working in the telegraph booth in the back of Green's Drug Store
when the warning from the Roanoke operator clicked out on the
teletype machine: ``I have casualties.''
</P>
<P>
   Green's was a lively place back then. The stools at the soda
fountain were nearly always occupied. In the mornings, businessmen
came in for coffee and gossip. High school kids slurped milk shakes
and flirted away the afternoons. But on that July day, the chatter
stopped cold.
</P>
<P>
   The telegrams came one after the other until the town thought
they would never stop. Each expressed the ``deep regret'' of the
secretary of war. Over the next week, Bedford would learn that 21
of its sons had died June 6 in the D-Day invasion of France.
</P>
<P>
   Amid a population of 3,200, ``if you didn't know the person who
had been killed, you probably knew his family,'' recalled Teass,
who was 21 that summer.
</P>
<P>
   There were so many telegrams that Sheriff Jim Marshall enlisted
the undertaker and taxi driver to help deliver them to parents and
wives in town and on surrounding farms.
</P>
<P>
   But it was the husky sheriff himself who went to the Hoback
dairy farm. The family was about to go to services at the Center
Point Methodist Church just across the road when Marshall stood
awkwardly on the porch and delivered his news. Pvt. Bedford Hoback,
30, had been killed on D-Day.
</P>
<P>
   A day or so later, the two teen-aged Hoback sisters were
churning ice cream to try to comfort their grieving parents when
the sheriff returned. Staff Sgt. Raymond Hoback, 24, was missing in
action.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Bedford men who did return from the war remembered a
wounded Raymond waiting on Omaha Beach to be transported back to a
ship. They theorized that he drowned when the tide came in. His
body was never found.
</P>
<P>
   Her parents were never the same after those telegrams, said
Lucille Hoback Boggess, who was 15 that sad summer.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, her mother wouldn't go on family picnics and other
outings. It was as if she thought that she shouldn't enjoy herself
if her sons weren't there to have fun, too. And their father would
send the sisters from the dinner table whenever they were laughing,
Boggess said.
</P>
<P>
   On every Bedford street, it seemed, there was a house with a
gold star in the window.
</P>
<P>
   A whole town was in mourning for a lost generation.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Today, on a dusty construction site on the edge of Bedford, the
granite arch of the National D-Day Memorial rises 44 feet and 6
inches above a Victory Plaza inlaid with the Allied designation for
the five Normandy beaches: Omaha. Utah. Gold. Sword. Juno.
</P>
<P>
   The height symbolizes the invasion date: 6/6/44. The word
``Overlord'' is emblazoned on the arch. ``Operation Overlord'' was
the code name for the Normandy landing.
</P>
<P>
   This Memorial Day, this first phase of the National D-Day
Memorial _ the arch and plaza _ will be opened to the public. The
completed project, including an adjoining education center, is to
be dedicated on June 6, 2001, the 57th anniversary of the historic
landing that is now remembered as the turning point of World War
II.
</P>
<P>
   Although funded mostly by private donations, the $12.2 million
memorial was approved by Congress in 1996 to honor the valor and
sacrifices of the 175,000 Allied forces involved in the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The Allies suffered 9,758 casualties on D-Day, including 6,603
from the United States. This rural community by a bend in the
Little Otter River was chosen for the national memorial because it
experienced the greatest per-capita loss of any American town or
city. Of the 35 sons of Bedford who landed at Normandy, 19 died
within the first 15 minutes of the battle, and two more were lost
later on that ``longest day.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bedford casualties were all members of an activated Virginia
National Guard unit, the 116th Infantry Regiment of the 29th
Division. Along with regular army units from the First Infantry
Division, these were the first soldiers to go ashore at Omaha
Beach, scene of some of the bloodiest fighting. The companies of
the 116th Regiment went ashore alphabetically, and Bedford was the
home of Company A.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   The Stevens twins, Roy and Ray, were platoon sergeants in
Company A. They had grown up on a farm outside Bedford and were
inseparable from boyhood. They were together when their National
Guard unit steamed to England aboard the Queen Mary, and they
bunked in the same barracks during training for the invasion.
</P>
<P>
   But on D-Day, they headed ashore in separate Higgins landing
craft with their different platoons.
</P>
<P>
   They agreed to meet at an intersection on the map. ``Ray wanted
me to shake his hand'' upon departure, Roy recalls. ``But I said we
would shake when we met up at that crossroads.''
</P>
<P>
   In the cold, choppy channel, though, the boat carrying Roy
Stevens' platoon hit an underwater German obstacle and sank. Most
of those aboard managed to stay afloat for several hours until
being picked up and taken back to England. Four days would pass
before Roy Stevens landed on Omaha Beach, where there was already a
row of fresh graves.
</P>
<P>
   The first wooden cross he examined was marked with the dog tag
of his twin brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``After I saw Ray's grave, I said, 'I'm going to get even,' and
I volunteered for everything to try to get some revenge,'' he
recalled. ``But 20 days was all that I had in battle. It seemed
like an eternity.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on patrol, he was wounded by an exploding land mine. After
surgery and a stay in a field hospital, he spent the rest of the
war in England training soldiers to be sent to the front.
</P>
<P>
   Then came V-E Day, and he went home to Bedford.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother was a small woman who had 14 children. I remember
her coming out of the house to meet me. She said, 'at least one of
you got back,' `` he recalls. ``My daddy was a big old rough
farmer. The first time I had ever seen him cry was when I came
home.''
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Victory Plaza on the National D-Day Memorial is about an acre in
size, semi-circular in shape, and ringed with flags of the 13
Allied nations involved in the D-Day invasion.
</P>
<P>
   The finished memorial will include a sprawling scene below the
plaza that symbolizes the landing.
</P>
<P>
   A 16-foot wall will represent the German bunkers that guarded
the cliffs of Normandy. A realistic statue titled ``Across the
Beach,'' depicting a GI pulling a wounded comrade, will stand below
the wall. A reflecting pool will symbolize the English Channel. A
replica of a Higgins landing craft will symbolize the crossing of
the Allied invaders.
</P>
<P>
   Beneath the arch is another realistic statue, ``The Final
Salute,'' honoring those who fell in combat. The statue depicts an
infantryman's rifle, with bayonet affixed, stuck into the ground. A
combat helmet sits atop the rifle butt and and dog tags hang near
the trigger.
</P>
<P>
   The design of the education center near the memorial will recall
the fortified bunkers that the soldiers encountered in Normandy. It
will house four galleries, an auditorium and the 120-seat Arnold M.
Spielberg Theater, named for the father of filmmaker Steven
Spielberg. The elder Spielberg is a World War II veteran who fought
in the Pacific.
</P>
<P>
   Steven Spielberg, whose movie ``Saving Private Ryan'' renewed
interest in D-Day, made a monetary contribution to build the
education center but did not disclose the amount.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Burrow, president of the D-Day Memorial Foundation, said
that one of the galleries will feature rotating exhibits from the
National D-Day Museum, which is opening June 6 in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Before his death in February, ``Peanuts'' cartoonist Charles
Schultz, a World War II veteran, led the fund-raising campaign for
the D-Day Memorial in Bedford. His widow, Jeannie Schultz, has
taken over the duties.
</P>
<P>
   Burrow said $8.7 million has been raised. Virginia will match
the next $3.5 million in private contributions, he said, which will
cover all construction costs and start the endowment to pay for
operations.
</P>
<P>
   _ _ _
</P>
<P>
   Roy Stevens, 80, and 85-year-old Ray Nance, a Company A first
lieutenant who was wounded on Omaha Beach, are the only two of
Bedford's ``D-Day boys'' still living in the town.
</P>
<P>
   Nowadays, Bedford is largely a bedroom community for folks who
work in Roanoke or Lynchburg. It is still surrounded by scenic
farms, including one where Elizabeth Teass lives. Lucille Boggess
is a county supervisor. Green's Drug Store is closed. Ray Nance is
a retired rural letter carrier. Roy Stevens is a retired rubber
plant worker who lost a hand in an industrial accident.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Stevens, who met and married Roy after the war, was
working in a Bedford plant that made gas masks that summer when the
telegrams arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``One mother was working there when she heard that her son had
been killed. She went home and never went back. Her husband later
committed suicide,'' she said. ``For a long time, Bedford was just
like a funeral.''

SYMPATHY FOR JAPAN'S GOVERNING PARTY EBBS AFTER GAFFES FROM ITS NEW
LEADER
</HEADLINE>
  By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TOKYO _ When leaders of Japan's governing party met secretly
seven weeks ago to choose a successor to Prime Minister Keizo
Obuchi, who was felled by a stroke, the idea was not only to ensure
a quick transition but also to perpetuate the party's long hold on
power.
</P>
<P>
   But to the growing consternation of party members, through a
series of gaffes and provocative statements the new prime minister,
Yoshiro Mori, has presided instead over a steep decline in the
government's public support, recent opinion polls indicate.
</P>
<P>
   The death of Obuchi on May 14 was once expected to give his
Liberal Democratic Party a strong sympathy vote in the
parliamentary elections scheduled for June 25. But now party
members are expecting a fight for their political lives.
</P>
<P>
   And most tellingly, in a system in which campaign money and
prestige traditionally flow from on high, the party's candidates
are playing down their connections to their embattled new leader.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of Mori's party have urged that the election be
postponed, but party leaders have resisted the idea. Hoping to
quell the dissension, Mori has announced plans for a news
conference on Friday to explain his recent remarks.
</P>
<P>
   The faux pas that has prompted the strongest reaction was a
remark Mori made last week to a Shinto religious group of lawmakers
that many felt alarmingly echoed Japan's militaristic past.
</P>
<P>
   ``Japan is a divine nation with the emperor at its core, and we
want the people to recognize this,'' Mori said.
</P>
<P>
   The prime minister tried to quiet the tempest by saying he
supported Japan's democratic, pacifist constitution and was merely
urging more spiritual values for Japan's youth. But his failure to
retract the comment seemed to make things worse.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of the week, support for Mori's Cabinet had dropped
to about 20 percent in newspaper polls, about half of what it was
after he took office.
</P>
<P>
   There have been other problems for Mori, including persistent
but unconfirmed press reports that he was arrested while
frequenting prostitutes as a college student, and that he had
improperly secured membership in an expensive private golfing club.
</P>
<P>
   Mori's chief cabinet secretary, Mikio Aoki, his schoolmate at
Waseda University, denied that Mori had been arrested, saying he
would have remembered the incident if it had been true. But Aoki,
who served in the same post under Obuchi, has been under fire
himself over his shifting explanations of the circumstances of
Obuchi's hospitalization and the secretly arranged succession.
</P>
<P>
   And on Wednesday, Mori was forced to acknowledge press reports
that he spoke at a wedding in 1995 that was attended by members of
a major Japanese crime syndicate. The prime minister said he had
not checked who would be present before accepting the invitation to
speak.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Mori has responded to the trouble, somewhat
awkwardly, by keeping out of view, or at least as quiet as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   For two weeks now, the prime minister has canceled his weekly
appearance at question time, the regular debate in parliament with
the opposition. And at a public appearance last weekend, Mori
joked, ``I will simply read what has been written for me,'' as he
pulled out a sheath of prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mori, Kazuhiko Koshikawa, denied that the prime
minister was ducking question time, saying his failure to attend
was ``because of the rude way that the opposition parties treated
the prime minister during a meeting between the leader of the LDP
and leaders of the opposition.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the case, the opposition has had a field day.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's like a child refusing to attend school,'' said Tsutomu
Hata, secretary general of the Democratic Party. ``The prime
minister should not run away from his job.''
</P>
<P>
   But from the perspective of some Liberal Democratic Party
candidates facing a tough campaign, what would be even worse would
be to have the prime minister speaking freely again.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more he talks, the more our votes fly out the window,''
one of the party's candidates complained to Tokyo Shimbun. In a
headline on Wednesday, The Daily Yomiuri, another conservative
newspaper that is traditionally supportive of the Liberal
Democratic Party, said bluntly that ``one more gaffe could prove
one too many'' for Mori.
</P>
<P>
   With anxieties over the elections running high, few governing
party politicians were willing to speak about Mori this week,
either in criticism or in his defense.
</P>
<P>
   But one legislator, Yoshihide Suga, said the new prime
minister's ``divine country'' comment had given the opposition
``real momentum'' going into the elections and sewn fear in the
hearts of governing party members.
</P>
<P>
   ``LDP people have begun taking down posters with Mori on them,''
Suga said. ``At this rate, soon you won't find any posters with
Mori's picture on them in urban areas.''

SURGEON GENERAL WARNS OF PERILS OF ORAL DISEASES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Texas, N.Y., Calif., Ore.)   By SHERYL GAY STOLBERG   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Oral diseases, from tooth decay to mouth cancer,
threaten the health of poor people, minorities, children and the
elderly, despite vast improvements in dental care over the past 50
years, according to a study made public by the surgeon general
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the first comprehensive review of the scientific
literature on oral health, found that most Americans who are
middle-aged or younger can expect to keep their teeth for life,
largely because fluoride in the drinking water is helping to
prevent cavities.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also documented profound and little-noticed
disparities in care that, it said, amounted to ''a silent epidemic
of oral diseases'' among the nation's most vulnerable people.
</P>
<P>
   Socioeconomics, inadequate education, poor overall health and
lack of access to care all play a part. While an estimated 44
million Americans lack health insurance, more than 108 million lack
dental insurance. Many children in poor neighborhoods never see a
dentist, the study found, and elderly people often lose dental
insurance when they retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a tendency to separate oral health from the rest
of the body,'' said Dr. David Satcher, the surgeon general, in an
interview after releasing the study.
</P>
<P>
   Black men, the study found, have the highest rate of pharyngeal
cancers in the United States, and are less likely to survive than
whites. The percentage of people who had untreated dental cavities
was substantially higher among blacks than whites _ about twice as
many, according to the report. African Americans are more likely
than whites to have missing teeth, and also more likely to have gum
disease, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The disparities were particularly great among children. The
study found that more than one-third of all poor youngsters from
ages 2 to 9 had untreated cavities, compared with 17 percent of
children who were not poor.
</P>
<P>
   And even children with health insurance often lack proper care;
a recent study, cited in the surgeon general's report, found that
among children covered by Medicaid, the government insurance
program for the poor, fewer than one in five had a preventive
dental visit during the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   To dentists who care for the poor, the findings were hardly a
surprise. With a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, a nonprofit
group, Dr. Allan Formicola, dean of the school of dentistry and
oral surgery at Columbia University in Manhattan, has arranged for
dental services at six middle schools in Harlem, Washington Heights
and Inwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing about double the rate of dental emergencies,
teeth that either need to be extracted or have root canal'' as the
national average, Formicola said. ``These are kids that are sitting
in class with toothaches. This is a problem, and it's neglected.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the study highlighted surprising links between
oral health and general well-being. Scientists, the report said,
are beginning to document associations between chronic oral
infection and diabetes, heart disease, stroke and even babies with
low birth weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mouth can serve as an early warning system,'' the report
said, signaling trouble elsewhere in the body. Thrush, a yeast
infection in the mouth, is often a sign of infection with the virus
that causes AIDS. Joint disorders in the jaw might be a sign of
osteoporosis. ``The mouth,'' Satcher said, ``is a mirror for many
diseases that affect the body.''
</P>
<P>
   That point has often been lost on the public, including medical
professionals, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgeon general's report is very important, because it not
only looks at things like decay, and what groups are still
suffering disproportionately, but it also connects up the problems
between oral health and general health,'' Formicola said.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the study was long overdue. ``We're the stepchild of
health care in the United States,'' said Robert Klaus, president of
Oral Health America, a nonprofit organization founded by dentists'
professional groups.
</P>
<P>
   Fluoridated drinking water, which helps prevent cavities, is one
of the great public health achievements of the 20th century,
Satcher's report said. Yet the study found that fluoridated water
reaches only 62 percent of Americans served by public water
supplies. Seven of the nation's 50 largest cities, including San
Diego, San Antonio and Portland, Ore., do not have fluoridated
water.
</P>
<P>
   The 309-page report took three years to prepare, and Satcher
unveiled it Thursday before a group of 24 first-graders at the
Shepherd Elementary School here. The children are learning about
oral health, under the auspices of a government-sponsored pilot
program.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Satcher said the session was an eye-opener for him;
as the child of uneducated farmers in rural Alabama, he did not see
a dentist until just before he went away to college. ``There are
still too many families like that in this country,'' he said.

 &HT;    Woman has slurs carved on her body
 &HT;    By Lyda Longa
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HAPEVILLE, Ga. _ The chief of police is calling it one of the
most bizarre crimes his town of 6,500 people has seen in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Sometime after midnight Thursday a Hapeville woman was bound,
gagged and raped in the apartment she shares with her boyfriend.
But that wasn't enough, said Hapeville Police Chief Ed Attaway. The
assailant carved a racial slur across the woman's stomach with a
box cutter.
</P>
<P>
   When it was all over, he slung the woman over his shoulder,
walked three blocks and dropped her off at a club used for
Alcoholics Anonymous meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Police believe the woman, who is white, used either her nose or
her chin to dial 911 and lead authorities to the address where she
was found just after 2 a.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen anything like this in Hapeville,'' Attaway
said Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Sgt. Allen Herd said officers visited the woman the day before
the attack because she reported receiving threatening telephone
calls. When police arrived at her apartment just after 3 p.m. she
also found a note taped to her door.
</P>
<P>
   ``The note was of a threatening nature,'' Herd said. ``But I
recall seeing the words 'I love you' in there.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the biggest questions lingering in investigators' minds
is why the assailant risked walking three blocks from the victim's
apartment on King Arnold Street to the Tara Club on North Central
Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors said it would have been difficult for someone to carry
the woman three blocks without being seen.
</P>
<P>
   It's likely the woman knows her attacker, police said. When they
arrived at the club, the attacker grabbed the woman's key chain and
selected the key to the club's door. He also took great pains to
hide his identity, donning a ski mask , gloves and a long-sleeved
turtle-neck pullover.
</P>
<P>
   The woman's boyfriend, who is black, and her ex-husband, who is
white, have been questioned. Both have been ruled out as suspects
for now.

COLUMN: STEVE HILBERT MADE $172 MILLION _ AND RAN OUT OF CASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind.)   By FLOYD NORRIS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Say this for Stephen Hilbert, the master salesman who built
Conseco Inc. into a giant insurance company even as critics
dismissed it as a house of paper sure to collapse some day: He
believed his own sales pitch.
</P>
<P>
   Hilbert was paid $119 million, not counting stock options, in
the 1990s, and $53 million more when he was ousted last month. But
both he and Conseco are now scrambling for liquidity as lenders
grow nervous.
</P>
<P>
   The depth of Hilbert's problems became clear when Conseco
reported that he had faced huge margin calls on his stock _ enough
to force him to take out an emergency $23 million loan from the
company before he got his severance check. Those margin loans are
in addition to the $181 million he owes on other loans, either to
Conseco or to banks on loans that Conseco guaranteed. The stock he
owns is now worth just $43 million.
</P>
<P>
   How does one man make $172 million and wind up owing far more
than that? A lavish lifestyle _ including renting a jumbo jet to
fly guests to a party on St. Martin for his sixth wife's 30th
birthday _ is only part of the answer. His debt is from buying
Conseco stock with borrowed money.
</P>
<P>
   Hilbert, now 54, built Conseco, based in Carmel, Ind., from a
tiny company to a member of the Fortune 500 through acquisitions. A
onetime encyclopedia salesman, he became a very prominent man in
Indiana, where the Indiana Pacers play at the Conseco Fieldhouse
and the Indianapolis Symphony performs at the Hilbert Circle
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   Hilbert became a hero on Wall Street, too, praised for his skill
at cutting costs and delivering profits. ``We have not missed one
quarterly earnings number or one revenue target,'' he boasted last
fall.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way there were complaints that he accomplished that
with misleading accounting. Four times _ in 1987, 1989-90, 1991-92
and 1994-95 _ the stock lost more than a third of its value,
usually as short-sellers ganged up. But each time Conseco
rebounded. From going public in 1985 through its 1998 peak, Conseco
rose at a compounded annual rate of 47 percent. Since the top, it
is down 91 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the short-sellers were again blasting Conseco, and
Hilbert saw opportunity after the stock price had been cut in half.
He borrowed $55 million to buy shares that are now worth $13
million.
</P>
<P>
   Why did the price fall so far? The last acquisitions, of health
care insurers and of Green Tree Financial, a company that finances
mobile home purchases, now appear to have been overpriced if not
completely foolish. Health insurance profits have plunged, and
Conseco is trying to sell the finance company for a fraction of
what it paid.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, Conseco appears to be desperate for cash. In the first
quarter, it gave Lehman Brothers a 5 percent stake in the finance
company just for buying some assets for what Conseco's books said
they were worth. Conseco says it will have no trouble meeting its
obligations, which include $1.5 billion in debt that comes due this
year.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cause for alarm if you believe Conseco's books, but
confidence in those numbers has fallen just when banks are becoming
more cautious in their lending. Conseco needs to sell the finance
operations quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Conseco will probably survive. But its problems are real, and it
is hard to see how the stock can recover enough to salvage the
finances of Hilbert, a salesman who bought when he should have
sold. Don't tell that to Hilbert, however. ``I still,'' he said
Thursday, ``have tremendous faith in the people and operations of
Conseco.''

MIDSTREAM COLUMN: A SOUND SLEEP AND A GOOD RETURN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio, N.J., N.Y.)  (For release Sun., May 28) 
 By JAMES SCHEMBARI    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   My parents have long told me their stories of growing up during
the Great Depression. I heard how my dad delivered groceries for a
dollar a week and how his family ate meat once a week with the
leftovers stretched, thinner and thinner, into the next few meals.
</P>
<P>
   For my father, James, 76, especially, the Great Depression has
had a lasting effect. He's eating much better now, but he refuses
to put his money into any investment where he isn't guaranteed to
get his principal back.
</P>
<P>
   He's not stuffing money into mattresses, but his insistence on
safety has meant he has sat out the bull market. Several of them,
actually. My lectures on the dangers of inflation and the
historical return of the stock market have not had as much effect
on him as those sparse chicken dinners. He puts his money almost
exclusively in certificates of deposit and savings bonds, and
that's that. The man will just not listen to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dad,'' I say, ``don't put all your money into CDs. Diversify.
Try some mutual funds.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Too risky,'' he says. ``I wouldn't be able to sleep at
night.''
</P>
<P>
   The sleep indicator is as important to my father's generation as
the GDP is to mine. We get frustrated seeing our parents' life
savings invested at 6 percent, but they expect to sleep very
soundly when it comes to their money. Although our parents are very
fond of us, often those feelings don't run deep enough to take
investment advice from their reckless children.
</P>
<P>
   Giovanni S. Testa, 43, of Livingston, N.J., said he has tried
for years to get his father, Marino, 75, also of Livingston, to
invest more wisely, but to no avail.
</P>
<P>
   ``With stocks, my father thinks he'll lose all of it,'' he said.
``I try to explain risk to him, but he didn't understand it.
Forgetaboutit. It was like talking to a wall, talking to my
father.''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Nemec, 54, of Hinckley, Ohio, never could get through to
his father, but he understood why.
</P>
<P>
   ``He tended to be quite nearsighted and ultraconservative,''
Nemec said. ``Let's face it, when a man has gone through the
Depression and World War II and then lived in a nice suburb, he
gets very comfortable with his station in life. My father was a
blue-collar worker and money came hard. He didn't want to take a
chance on losing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Nemec's father died in 1992, and his mother, Lillian, 79, was
more open to change. He had her meet with his planner, Paul Hrisko.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big change for her and she asked an awful lot of
questions,'' said Hrisko, a certified financial planner who owns
Paul Hrisko &AMP; Associates in Cleveland Heights, Ohio. ``Is it safe?
Is it guaranteed? What are my chances of losing my money? It didn't
take one meeting. I had to come back several times. She was a bit
nervous. The more I discussed it with her, the more she was willing
to take the next step to a more aggressive portfolio.''
</P>
<P>
   Hrisko said children must explain the investments, and their
risks, fully and clearly. Children should also help their parents
clarify their goals, which will determine how much risk is
acceptable: is the money for them, their children or their
grandchildren? The key, Hrisko said, is that the parent must trust
the child.
</P>
<P>
   The senior Testa moved slowly into mutual funds after his son
persuaded him to see an investment adviser and he saw how
diversification could keep his risk low but increase his return.
Gail Rosen, 41, of Martinsville, N.Y., talked to her father for
years about leaving savings bonds behind. He resisted at first, but
he trusted her enough to move some money into mutual funds. Now
he's hooked.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dad has a computer and watches his funds online,'' said
Rosen, an accountant. ``Now he tells me how I'm doing on my
investments. He's so addicted that my mother hates it that he's on
the computer all the time. Like some wives lose their husbands to
golf, she's lost him to the computer.''
</P>
<P>
   Her father, Irving Horowitz, 72, of Monroe Township, N.J., said
he changed after his daughter showed him how much money he was
losing to inflation and taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's an accountant, so I listened,'' he said, eventually
moving money into funds and individual stocks. ``Since I retired, I
have made a hobby of it.''
</P>
<P>
   My father's hobby is his garden. And keeping his principal safe.
I know his greatest concern is not for his children or his
grandchildren, but for my mother, Mary. He wants to leave her
secure and comfortable if anything happens to him. If his principal
is safe, he knows she will be, too.
</P>
<P>
   He could have a better strategy, but that's not a bad one. It's
a heartfelt plan that this son is going to stop arguing with.
</P>

<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Five years ago, when General Motors ran
its huge Suburban through a buzzsaw, cutting a 20-inch slice from
its length, it created the Chevrolet Tahoe and the GMC Yukon:
shorter, more manageable sport utilities with major V-8 power that
could seat up to six people and practically tow a mountain.
</P>
<P>
   What the new sport utilities lacked was a third row of seats,
like the one in the Suburban, and the bright lights at Ford and
Dodge didn't let GM forget it. In a year, Ford brought out the
Expedition, with three rows, and a year later Dodge crammed a third
bench into its slightly smaller Durango.
</P>
<P>
   Now the big news in this part of the market is that GM has not
only put a third seat in its Tahoes and Yukons, but it split the
third bench in half so that each part can fold neatly out of the
way for cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Big deal, you say? Well, the geniuses at Ford and Dodge didn't
think of it, minivans don't have it, and if you don't see the
advantages of this, then you didn't just drive more than 1,300
miles on a family vacation with four, sometimes five people, and
six, sometimes eight, bags.
</P>
<P>
   I did so in a Tahoe and I would do it again. We folded up one of
the far back seats and loaded three big pieces of luggage in its
place. Then we stashed three smaller pieces behind the remaining
seat, which my 11-year-old son used at his base camp. My
10-year-old daughter settled into her own perch in a window seat in
the middle row, and my wife and I commandeered the front buckets.
</P>
<P>
   We picked up grandma and her two small bags for one leg of the
trip (5 hours, 300 miles), and when the bags were unloaded we put
the rear seat in its full, upright, locked postion and comfortably
carried seven, including four adults, on a day trip.
</P>
<P>
   We spent out vacation in Texas, where full-sized sport utilities
are about as common as taxicabs in Manhattan. The neatly packed
dark-gray Tahoe caught the attention of several bystanders at gas
stations (it did tend to guzzle the stuff) and in hotel parking
lots. The onlookers marveled at the convenience of the back seat
and how much we had stuffed around it. They also gulped at the
sticker, which exceeded $41,000, including $760 for the optional
third seat, on the well equipped test truck.
</P>
<P>
   The full-sized sport utility market just keeps growing. Never
mind these vehicles' voracious appetite _ I averaged about 14.8
miles per gallon over all, in both city and highway driving _ and
their less than pristine record on emissions. People like them
because they increasingly seem like minivans on the inside while
looking downright unstoppable on the outside.
</P>
<P>
   The interiors of the Tahoe and the Yukon have both grown more
comfortable. The top of the line LT and SLT, respectively, have all
the usual power this and leather that. An Autoride feature,
standard on the Yukon and optional on the Tahoe, automatically
adjusts the ride with the load. Cup holders abound and
air-conditioning, available with separate controls for the rear
passengers, includes vents in the ceiling. Outside a Dairy Queen in
Salado, with the thermometer display on the rear-view mirror
registering 102 degrees outside, nobody in the back complained that
they lacked cool air.
</P>
<P>
   The trick to making the third seat convenient is making it easy
to get to. The Durango's middle seats are split in a 40-20-40
proportion; the outer portions fold out of the way to allow access
from either side.
</P>
<P>
   Ford and GM use an 80-20 configuration that allows entry only
from the right. The Tahoe seat easily lifts and folds better than
that of the Expedition, which requires tilting a heavy seat out of
the way. I also thought the Expedition's passageway was tight.
</P>
<P>
   Look for the seating competition to heat up, too, when Ford adds
a third row to its next-generation Explorer and Toyota brings out
its full-sized Sequoia in the fall. That truck's second and third
seats are ingenuously designed for easy tilting and removal, and
caused a stir among executives from competing companies when the
Sequoia was shown at the Detroit auto show in January.
</P>
<P>
   Once you're in the back 40 of the Tahoe, though, the seat is not
exactly a box at the Met. Ford and Chevy both angle the seatback to
allow greater headroom. This can be disconcerting at first. (Dodge
raised the Durango's rear roofline.) And all three manufacturers
have seating for three people including two positions with shoulder
straps. They have also raised the seat up a bit to give greater
visibility. GM has two adjustable headrests back there; the Durango
has two fixed ones and the Expedition has none. Only the Expedition
can be ordered with rear windows that pop out to serve as vents.
</P>
<P>
   Adults would not want to sit in the rear for long. My son, who
is just over 5 feet tall, thought it was great. But he also kept
the seat in front of him folded down to stretch out on long drives.
</P>
<P>
   The redesigned Tahoe and Yukon, which are virtually identical
under the skin, use essentially the same new frame that underpins
the redesigned Suburban, the GMC Yukon XL (formerly known as the
GMC Suburban) and the full-size GM pickups. By virtue of its fewer
welds and stress points, the ride is quieter, smoother and more
car-like.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the Tahoe is also easier to drive, partly because the
entire feel of the truck is softer and more welcoming. The turning
radius is considerably smaller, making maneuvers in parking lots
more realistic.
</P>
<P>
   Gripes were few. I don't like the power seat adjustments on the
sides of the seat. Also, the ceiling light in the rear hardly
illuminated the cargo area. Dodge smartly puts its lamp in the
hatchback and lights the entire loading area. The GM hatch, though,
is made mostly of aluminum which makes it light and easy to shut.
</P>
<P>
   GM's trim and finish quality stills gives me pause. During out
trip, one air vent fell out of the ceiling when one of our children
fiddled with it; the louvers on another came apart, and a piece of
seat trim repeatedly fell off. Both the Tahoe and the Yukon had an
occasional squeak coming from the padding around the steering
column.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, though, these were modest flaws in a much-improved
family truck.
</P>

`BETTER LIVING THROUGH CIRCUITRY': FILM EXPLORES RAVE CULTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Production notes are at end of review. Proper name `Erix' is
spelled correctly) 
 By STEPHEN HOLDEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Those of us who lived through the headiest days of the '60s
counterculture, when pie-in-the-sky hippie gurus were popping up
like daisies in July, should feel more than a twinge of deja vu
watching John Reiss' impassioned documentary film ``Better Living
Through Circuitry.''
</P>
<P>
   An enthusiastic exploration of today's rave culture and the
beat-driven electronic music that fuels it, the movie is packed
with upbeat pronouncements by flush-faced techno-wizards and
partygoers extolling the transformational power of these all-night
dance parties.
</P>
<P>
   Usually held in nontraditional party spaces _ abandoned
warehouses and outdoor desert settings are favorite sites _ these
events, programmed by visionary disc jockeys and lighting
designers, synergize electronic music, psychedelic decor and drugs
like Ecstasy to send partygoers into a communal euphoric state.
Some rave parties are attended by thousands who may drive hundreds
of miles to surrender to the beat.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest difference between the '60s proselytizers for
transcendence through rock 'n' roll, LSD and free love and the most
ardent champions of the rave culture is that the claims made for
rave are a little less grandiose, a little more scientific and not
as erotically oriented. Instead of describing mystical leaps of
faith, the proponents of rave, like mental-health professionals in
the age of Prozac, cite biological data to support their claims for
the power of the events to alter consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   One theorist, who goes by the name BT, offers a physiological
explanation for the joys of rave in which the disc jockey is a
combination electrical engineer, neurologist and artistic magician
wielding aural and visual stimuli with an effect on human brain
waves that can be measured. When the chemistry is optimal at a rave
event, he says, the synergy of elements produces the same
collective trances that shamans were able to conjure with sustained
drumming and dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The most charismatic people interviewed in a movie that has more
than its share of charming oddballs speak like hippie pied pipers
armed with technological know-how and the intimidating vocabulary
that comes with it. We meet Roni Size, a flamboyantly attired
Briton who was an architect of ``acid house,'' the ritual trance
music whose birth he traces to the summer of 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Size compares the creation of this electronic music to the punk
aesthetic of the late '70s, when musicians rebelling against the
glossy, expensive sound of corporate rock took back the means of
pop music production. Rave DJs and sound engineers, he gushes, are
going much further by ``seizing the means of perception.''
</P>
<P>
   A New York disc jockey, DJ Spooky, whose technique involves
``continuous sampling,'' calls his reconfiguring of the musical
past ``ancestor worship'' and says that disc jockeys like himself
are writers improvising aural streams of consciousness. An
itinerant disc jockey who calls himself Scanner describes going
from city to city ``like a traveling salesman,'' with his silver
case of gadgetry that includes a short-wave radio, a DiscMan, a
digital audio tape machine and a theremin.
</P>
<P>
   A high point of the movie is a concert performance by the
acclaimed disc jockey, musician and producer Moby, who has taken
the music about as far above ground as anybody.
</P>
<P>
   So many ideas, such invention, so much optimism: ``Better Living
Through Circuitry'' gives you the same kind of sky's-the-limit buzz
that you could feel at a Timothy Leary event in the '60s, when that
high priest of acid promised male audience members that by
ingesting LSD they could have every woman in the world they wanted
_ in fantasy, of course.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the '60s acid messiahs, ``Better Living Through
Circuitry'' treads gingerly over the drug issue. But while
carefully covering its tracks by referring to deaths from overdoses
and toxic chemical combinations, the movie is essentially
pro-Ecstasy. No matter how much the DJs may claim that their
electronic sounds produce the euphoria of a good rave, the movie
clearly implies that Ecstasy is the key that unlocks it all.

 &HT;    As flag flap eases, excitement and ticket sales rise leading
into mega arts event
 &HT;    By Tom Sabulis
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S.C. _ In the hours leading up to today's opening of
the 24th Spoleto Festival USA, things are beginning to return to
normal.
</P>
<P>
   French aerialists are swinging from the live oak trees in
Washington Park. The set for Bertolt Brecht's ``Mother Courage and
Her Children'' has fallen on the show's technical director and
broken his kneecap. The opera singers are complaining about their
costumes, but even these protests are milder than expected, given
the emotional constitution of divas.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the most part, they are acting very unoperatically,'' says
Nunally Kersh, the festival's 34-year-old producer, charmed by her
good fortune.
</P>
<P>
   As if on cue, ticket sales are also bouncing back for the
Southeast's largest multidisciplinary arts event, a $6.2 million
cultural hurricane that will produce 125 performances of 40 events
over the next 17 days.
</P>
<P>
   The upbeat box office is a tad surprising. As recently as last
weekend, sales were down 10 percent from last year's recordbreaking
pace, partly due to the NAACP tourism boycott of the state prompted
by the Confederate flag controversy. But things picked up earlier
this week, shortly before South Carolina Gov. Jim Hodges signed
legislation Tuesday that will remove the flag, which many regard as
a racist symbol, from the Statehouse in Columbia on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   By Wednesday, the festival had experienced a few ``very good
days'' _ meaning sales in excess of $25,000 per day. General
director Nigel Redden says sales were 30 percent to 40 percent
higher Monday and Tuesday over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tickets have taken off, and it's high time,'' Redden says.
``It's not simply the resolution of the flag issue, although that
has been a weight on us. It's also that every year has its own
rhythm, and this year they (ticket sales) are late.''
</P>
<P>
   Politics has only added to the hectic atmosphere leading up to
the festival, which has been known to draw 60,000 people, according
to Spoleto spokeswoman Marie Lawson, though Chamber of Commerce
estimates are higher. Three acts have canceled to honor the
National Association for the Advancement of Colored People's
boycott, which is still in effect, in protest of the decision to
move the flag to a Confederate memorial site near the Capitol. In
the latest change, boycotting singer Dianne Reeves has been
replaced by another jazz act, the Marcus Roberts Trio (June 3 at
the Cistern).
</P>
<P>
   For many of the performers warming up in this sweltering city's
intimate, brick-lined downtown Wednesday and Thursday, the flag
issue wasn't an issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's moved beyond it,'' Redden says, driving to a
series of rehearsals and interviews, talking over the annoying
ping-ping of his borrowed car's warning system. On these short
trips, Redden refuses to wear his seat belt. What could be a more
appropriate metaphor for the man who runs this sometimes
seat-of-the-pants event?
</P>
<P>
   Members of the French circus Les Colporteurs certainly have
other things on their minds than flags. In one of the city's
pocket-size parks, they've strung a network of cables, balancing
wires and rope swings in the overhanging trees and are rehearsing
their aerial artistry for today's opening-ceremony performance at
noon.
</P>
<P>
   Making its Spoleto debut, the circus is in town to perform
``Filao,'' based on the Italo Calvino novel ``The Baron in the
Trees,'' under a big tent in Cannon Park. Today, however, it will
take advantage of Charleston's arboreal splendor to create a
special opening-day treat in Washington Park, not far from City
Hall, where official ceremonies take place. When Redden arrives to
check out the progress, he's immediately swept into conference with
Kersh, who has been talking in fluent French about ``liability
issues'' with circus bosses.
</P>
<P>
   Along with curious residents and tourists, Deirdre Valente, the
circus's American producer, stands nearby and surveys this surreal
scene, as performers hang upside down from tree branches and loll
on rope swings while officials talk fine-print contract minutiae on
the ground below.
</P>
<P>
   ``Charleston is so hospitable about all this,'' says the New
York-based Valente. ``This is much closer to what happens in
Europe, artists living and working in your midst all the time.'' If
not swinging in your historic trees.
</P>
<P>
   Valente, 40, says she discussed the flag issue with the circus
early on and recommended they perform at the festival. ``Spoleto is
a shining example of what diversity is all about. It doesn't
further anyone's cause by picking on Spoleto.''
</P>
<P>
   Next stop, the Garden Theatre, for the final dress rehearsal of
``The Silver River,'' a fusion-opera melding Eastern and Western
music, dance and mythology, which also features a working waterfall
that runs downstage into a wading pool. Standing at the back of the
theater, dressed in wrinkled white T-shirt and khakis, David Henry
Hwang, the Tony winner (``M. Butterfly'') who wrote the ``Silver
River'' libretto, turns slightly philosophical about his first
Spoleto experience. ``It's been a little complicated,'' Hwang says.
``Everyone has had to work out the flag issue in their own way.
Otherwise it's very pleasant. It's the only place I've ever worked
where everyone in my company is happy with where they're staying.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the strangest sight at Spoleto this year is Middleton
Place, the 18th-century plantation some 15 miles out of town, where
sculptor Joel Shapiro has erected more than a dozen of his bronze
sticklike creations on the greensward leading into the grounds.
These minamalist forms stretch and run and dance across the open
space, charging the country-estate atmosphere with an urban
kineticism. That is, until you spot the plantation's herd of sheep
grazing around them.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting nearby, on a work break, tour guide Joann Kautz gazes at
this field of beams. What does she think of the sculpture? ``Not
much,'' she says. ``It doesn't really fit in with the rest of the
grounds. But it's interesting to see the sheep out there. Our poor
cow came out this morning and mooed all the way through.''

   Like most things in life, commuting is in the eye of the
beholder. Most of the time, it's an obligation, a habit, no more
than a repetitive journey from home to workplace and back again.
But once in a while, commuting becomes high adventure, a source of
laughter and the stuff of lasting memories.
</P>
<P>
   One day, my commuter train struck a car carrier, which had
bottomed out on a grade crossing,'' writes David Katz, a geneticist
who lives in Evanston, Ill. ``No one was injured, and the sight of
a flying Acura was memorable.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the rest of the day, when asked by co-workers how I was
doing, I opined that I felt like I had been in a train wreck. No
one seemed to believe that I really had been in a train wreck. It
was April 1.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the day after a hurricane had left much debris on the
road,'' writes Dianne Olsen, recalling a morning when she was
commuting in her tough old Saab through Westchester County, from
her home in Pleasantville to her job as a marketing coordinator in
Ossining. ``A pile of what I thought were twigs appeared in front
of me,'' she writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, it wasn't twigs. It was a big ol' tree branch, and it
poked itself right through the front of my car,'' said Olsen, who
has since moved to Poughkeepsie, N.Y. ``I pulled off the road at
the first opportunity and was so happy. The branch wasn't sticking
into my radiator, just wedged beneath the headlight assembly. But I
couldn't pull it out.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I drove the next mile to work, intending to call a garage
and bring my car in for repair. People in the office kept remarking
(I couldn't make this stuff up), `Did you know you have a tree
branch sticking out of your car?' It happened so often that I
finally told everyone: `Yes, and can you believe it? That tree just
ran right out of the forest and attacked my car. I never saw it
coming.'''
</P>
<P>
   During his years as a human resources executive in New York
City, Ronald J. Rakowski, who lived in northern Fairfield County,
Conn., sometimes commuted on the lightly traveled branch line to
Danbury, which was near his home.
</P>
<P>
   One snowy Friday night, ``the Danbury-bound train was struggling
as it left the main New Haven line _ more than an hour late _ and
headed north,'' Rakowski writes. ``Hearing that the train had lost
one of its engines and that the remainder of the trip would be very
slow, I headed for the bar car for a libation and a snack or two to
soothe my growing hunger pangs.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the regulars seemed to have enjoyed more than his share
and was slumped against the bar with his head nestled comfortably
atop his folded arms.''
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, when the train halted to let passengers off,
the snoozing regular would demand to know the name of the stop,
then return his head to the comfort of his arms. At Branchville, he
asked the usual question, and after being told, settled back in
again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately,'' writes Rakowski, ``there's an incline between
the Branchville and Redding stations that the underpowered train
couldn't conquer. So it slowly backed down to the station we had
just left and jerked to a stop.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone in the car shouted, ``Branchville!''
</P>
<P>
   The regular looked up, squinted and said, ``We must be going
around in circles.'' Then he returned to his rest.
</P>
<P>
   The engineer tried the Branchville-Redding incline again, the
climb made harder by the icy conditions, and once more the train
slipped back. All eyes were on the regular as the train halted at
the same station for the third time. He lifted his head and asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Branchville,'' came the reply.
</P>
<P>
   He blinked, straightened up and grabbed his briefcase.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, thanks,'' he said as he staggered off. ``This is my
stop.''
</P>
<P>
   One morning last fall, on the way to her job as an occupational
therapist at the Little Rock Veterans Administration Medical
Center, Sarah Smith was driving along a rural road adjacent to the
Arkansas River when a doe tried to soar over the roof of her car.
</P>
<P>
   ``She didn't make it, and as I jumped out to see if I could help
her, I locked my keys in the ignition with the engine still
running,'' Smith writes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The next oncoming vehicle stopped to offer assistance, and the
first thing I could stammer was, `Do you have a gun?' Now, I was
thinking of putting the doe out of her agony, but the driver raised
his eyebrows, looked scared and jumped back in his truck and went
to call the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``The SWAT team _ one officer _ arrived with sunglasses and a
rifle (at 7 a.m.), shot the deer, and since I had no need of the
meat, had me wait in the patrol car while he called for backup to
pick up the carcass and bring a tool to open my locked door.
</P>
<P>
   The wait was spent looking over the officer's shoulder as he
used the on-board computer to solicit recipes for venison. I saw
venison chili, crockpot venison, venison sausage and deer kabobs
offered for the latest road kill.
</P>
<P>
   The officer kindly called my office, but as usual the
communication was garbled, and by the time I arrived, only two
hours late, my colleagues had me crashed and dead by gunfire or
animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the last word on commuting should be left to Ralph
Slovenko, a professor of law and psychiatry at Wayne State
University in Detroit.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Butcher, a member of the British Parliament, has come up
with an interesting proposal,'' he writes. ``He has urged his
government to allow jugglers and acrobats to perform on the
highways to soothe the jangled nerves of motorists.
</P>
<P>
   ``With traffic moving so slowly, there's hardly the possibility
that an acrobat could be killed.''

&HT;     BUSH HOLDS HIGH-PROFILE MEETINGS WITH POWELL, AFRICAN LEADER 
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 &HT;     By PEGGY FIKAC  
 &HT;     c.2000 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ It was part photo opportunity, part political
speculation, and hard-enough work as far as creating a presidential
candidate's event goes.
</P>
<P>
   When Texas Gov. George W. Bush had back-to-back meetings at the
Governor's Mansion Thursday with South African President Thabo
Mbeki and retired Gen. Colin Powell, carefully-placed flags were
strategically taped to their poles to avoid the prospect of
flapping in a dignitary's face.
</P>
<P>
   Children were brought in as a backdrop for the press conference
with Powell; high-ranking state officials were placed in
high-profile spots; and little red wagons carefully arranged to
signify Powell's crusade for youth.
</P>
<P>
   The comments from Bush and Mbeki, who were accompanied by their
wives and corralled by a velvet rope as they spoke, lasted less
than two minutes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, I said if all goes well, I look forward to working
with him. I'm not trying to drag him into U.S. politics. And he
said, `I don't want to be drug in,''' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell expressed hope that his appearance with Bush would
showcase their dedication to children, while reporters asked mainly
about presidential politics.
</P>
<P>
   Bush signed an agreement touted nationally by Powell, called the
Governor's Promise Partnership, to continue promoting volunteer
efforts to boost young people's character and confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The two were accompanied by Bush's wife, Laura, and backed by
elementary-school children.
</P>
<P>
   Texas nearly three years ago was the first state to have a rally
to kick off the effort to help youth, Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   He cited advancements since then, including 27 Texas
``Communities of Promise'' that he said bring together volunteers
and leaders to help youth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a great partner in the great state of Texas,'' Bush
told Powell, the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he would like the meeting to convey, Powell said,
``What I would like this picture to say is that these two concerned
Americans have a commitment to young people.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also made clear, ``I stand with this man. I support him
for president.''
</P>
<P>
   Powell said does not want to be considered as a potential
running mate for Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee. But
there is speculation he would have a place in a Bush
administration. The two have met three times in two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   As the youngsters from nearby St. Martin's Lutheran School
watched, Bush was asked whether he might alienate his conservative,
anti-abortion supporters if he reaches out to those who are
pro-choice Republicans such as Powell.
</P>
<P>
   The governor has said reasonable people can disagree on
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing people are going to learn about me is I'm going to
make my decisions based upon what I think is right for America. I'm
going to base my decisions ... upon the principles that I think are
right for this country,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm confident I can unite the party and lead us to victory,
but more important, lead America to a better tomorrow,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As for the role that Powell might play in his campaign and
potential administration, Bush said that Powell is a friend whose
advice he values.
</P>
<P>
   If one is asked to consider a job by the president, Powell
added, one must listen.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not looking for a job right now, but obviously I will do
what I can to assist the governor with advice and with friendship.
And in due course we can talk about whether or not there might a
role for me,'' Powell said, who headed the Joint Chiefs of Staff in
the presidency of the governor's father, George Bush.

PERUVIAN GOVERNMENT DECIDES TO HOLD VOTE AS SCHEDULED 
</HEADLINE>
   (SUBS for complete rewrite with updated information)  
 By CLIFFORD KRAUSS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ The government of President Alberto Fujimori said
Thursday that a runoff presidential election would be held on
Sunday as scheduled despite nationwide protests and calls from
Washington and other allies that it be postponed to assure a clean
ballot count.
</P>
<P>
   Unless reversed, the decision appeared to increase the
possibility of economic sanctions against Peru after it ignored the
recommendations of the Clinton administration, the Organization of
American States and several European and Latin American
governments.
</P>
<P>
   During intense negotiations all week, U.S. and Latin American
diplomats had urged Peruvian officials to delay the vote so a
computer system used to count the vote could be overhauled and
rechecked by independent auditors.
</P>
<P>
   A brief announcement that the National Elections Committee had
voted 3-2 to go forward with the election was met with shock by
international observers who had become increasingly hopeful that
Fujimori had decided to given in to international pressures. ``We
don't know if this is a final decision or if there is still is the
possibility of an opening.'' said Eduardo Stein, head of an
election observer team for the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior U.S. Embassy official said he thought the decision
was final, adding, ``The U.S. government deeply regrets this
outcome. Even a relatively brief delay would have put the
Organization of American States in a position to speak to the
integrity of the election results.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori had appeared to be going back and forth on the election
scheduling during the past three days, but western diplomats said
that mounting protests had perhaps strengthened the hand of
hard-liners in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Just Wednesday night, Fujimori had said in an interview in the
government palace that ``the possibility for an adjustment of the
election date exists. We are in a fluctuating situation.'' It was
just one of several signs that Fujimori and his aides were
satisfied they could win the election at a later date and avert a
crisis in its foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral crisis had been gathering momentum since Alejandro
Toledo, the opposition candidate, dropped out of the race last
Thursday, saying there was no reason to compete in a fraudulent
election. He said he would rejoin the contest if it were postponed
by several weeks, with guarantees for a free vote.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing Thursday's announcement, Toledo said, ``This will
bring Peru enormous instability.''
</P>
<P>
   A wave of strikes and street demonstrations that followed
Toledo's withdrawal from the race peaked Thursday, and grew
increasingly violent.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of protesters attacked the offices of the National
Elections Commission, the highest government body that supervises
the elections, and broke windows and damaged a door with rocks,
pipes and at least one Molotov cocktail. Scores of people were
arrested in the northern jungle city of Iquitos for blocking roads,
and police used tear gas to clear protesters gathering in front of
the government palace here in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a growing number of influential businessmen had
warned that holding the uncontested election on Sunday could mean
years of economic sanctions and tensions with Washington that could
impede investment and growth. Their arguments were strengthened
through the week as Peruvian bond and stock prices dropped sharply
and foreign financial institutions issued risk warnings that
threatened to increase interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the government's policies on the campaign and
political process have been inconsistent. Several television
stations allied with the government had begun airing Toledo
commercials and coverage of his rallies, while tabloid newspapers
thought to be directed by Fujimori's intelligence service has
softened their negative coverage of Toledo's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, three unidentified men Wednesday night broke into
the offices of an opposition journalist said to hold incriminating
videotapes of Vladimiro Montesinos, Fujimori's intelligence chief,
meeting with election officials. The journalist, Fabian Salazar,
said the burglars tied him up and tortured him as they demanded
that he reveal his sources within the intelligence service who gave
him copies of the tapes that apparently were made by Montesinos
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said they cut through his left wrist to the bone with a
saw during their questioning. He was hospitalized after his
videotapes, archives and computer disks were stolen. Human rights
activists said Salazar's descriptions of his ordeal, which were
verified by doctors, may represent the worst example of torture in
Peru in at least two years.

LIKELIHOOD OF BUCHANAN CANDIDACY RATTLES REFORM PARTY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Calif., Wis., Ariz., Tenn., Col., Ga.)   By MICHAEL JANOFSKY   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TUCSON, Ariz. _ The last time Reform Party leaders met, three
months ago in Nashville, tensions rose to such an extreme that two
women wrestled over control of a microphone, and the police were
summoned to prevent the rowdiness from growing worse.
</P>
<P>
   Now party leaders are fighting over much more than a microphone.
</P>
<P>
   The growing likelihood that Pat Buchanan, the conservative
television commentator and former Republican, will secure the
Reform Party's presidential nomination and the $12.5 million in
federal campaign money that goes along with it has created another
element of conflict within the loosely organized and often chaotic
party.
</P>
<P>
   Some Reform leaders are so worried that Buchanan and his
delegates will take over the party and force it to adopt a
conservative platform on abortion and other issues that they are
collecting signatures to draft the party's founder, Ross Perot, for
a third consecutive campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Another group opposed to Buchanan, led by the party's national
secretary, is quietly negotiating to have the Green Party
candidate, Ralph Nader, run for the Reform Party nomination.
</P>
<P>
   Still other party members are urging the leadership to endorse
no presidential candidate this year, rather than Buchanan, and to
turn efforts to building the party from the ground up by fielding
candidates in state, city and local campaigns. Moreover, Reform
Party leaders in at least two states, Colorado and Georgia, have
condemned Buchanan for some of his views and tactics and have
demanded he resign from the party.
</P>
<P>
   While it seems doubtful that the dissidents can prevent
Buchanan's nomination, the discord could complicate the nominating
process, making it less likely that the party's convention in Long
Beach, Calif., in August will end on a note of unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're unconventional, to say the least,'' said Gerald R. Moan,
a Tucson businessman who became party chairman just three weeks
ago. Moan replaced Pat Choate, Perot's 1996 running mate and a
close friend of Buchanan's. Choate had won the job at the chaotic
party meeting in Nashville but resigned because of an illness in
his family.
</P>
<P>
   For such a swirl of activity against him, Buchanan does not seem
especially concerned. ``He'd prefer that things not be this way,''
said Bay Buchanan, his sister and campaign manager. ``But we're
staying focused on what we're doing, trying to stay out of the
fray. It's really no different than any other party. People are
very unhappy when they don't get their candidate in the race.''
</P>
<P>
   Buchanan's ascendancy in the Reform Party has largely come
through the graces of Perot, who has always encouraged disaffected
Republicans and Democrats to join the cause. In recent years, few
Republicans grew as disaffected as Buchanan, and by last year, as
Perot withdrew from public view, he made it clear that Buchanan
would be welcome in the party.
</P>
<P>
   For Buchanan, who spent years clashing with the Republican Party
leadership, that was the opening he needed, both for an
unobstructed path to the presidential general election, and for the
mantle as leader of a political party. And by winning 5 percent of
the vote Buchanan would ensure the party federal campaign money for
2004.
</P>
<P>
   But Perot and Buchanan have not talked in two years, according
to Bay Buchanan, although Russell J. Verney, a former party
chairman who remains close to Perot, said it had been closer to
five years.
</P>
<P>
   After Gov. Jesse Ventura of Minnesota resigned from the party in
February, and Donald J. Trump, the New York real estate developer,
dropped out of the Reform Party presidential race _ each angrily
citing Buchanan's influence _ a vacuum was left in party
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Trying to fill it, Buchanan has wooed delegates, placed
supporters in Reform Party state leadership positions and offered
his America-first, socially conservative views as a credible
alternative to the major party candidates, Gov. George W. Bush of
Texas and Vice President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   To win the Reform Party nomination, a candidate needs a majority
of the votes of members who have either requested a ballot from the
party, registered as a party member in a state where the party is
recognized or signed a petition supporting a party candidate in a
state that has not recognized the party. Ballots can be cast in
person, by mail, phone or by the Internet from July 4 to the start
of the convention. But if two-thirds of the convention delegates
disagree with the popular choice, they can vote to overturn the
selection and pick another candidate.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   For now, Buchanan appears unstoppable. With no viable
challengers, he is well on his way to securing the delegate support
he needs to assure the Reform Party nomination, and, as the rules
permit, to allow him as the nominee to rewrite the party platform
to include his positions on social issues _ a possibility, his
sister said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Based on Perot's showing in the 1996 election, the Reform Party
will automatically be recognized on the ballot in 20 states in
November; in addition, Buchanan has gathered enough signatures to
get the party on the ballot in at least more five states, and
expects to collect enough signatures to get the party or the
candidate on the ballot in all 50 states by the final state filing
deadline, which is Sept. 5 in Wisconsin.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So much momentum by a single campaign might be expected to unite
a party starved for respect and credibility. But as Buchanan forges
ahead, so do his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Plenty of the old-timers are still here, and they are very
concerned about Pat Buchanan,'' said Ira Goodman, the New Jersey
party chairman who is leading the effort to draft Perot. ``Our goal
is to go into the primary with an alternative.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Goodman insisted that support among party members for Perot is
widespread. But drawing him back into a potentially loud and
contentious primary fight would seem a rather daunting challenge
for now. Perot has withdrawn from the political arena, a sign to
some that he is either disinterested in the current state of
affairs or disgusted by them.
</P>
<P>
   ``He has not even asked to speak at the convention,'' said Moan,
the party chairman, who takes that to mean he will not attend. ``If
he comes, he'll speak. But if he doesn't come, that could be
interpreted as a rebuke to Buchanan.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Verney said he does not know what Perot will do, an assertion
that appears to leave open the possibility Perot may indeed be a
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't rule it out,'' Verney said, which was the same
response he offered six months ago. Only now, time is a factor, and
to qualify as a presidential candidate under the party's rules,
Perot would have to notify the leadership by July 1 that he intends
to run.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's not launched a full-fledged campaign to be the next
president,'' Verney said of Perot, who has not granted an interview
in some time. ``But he hasn't ruled it out. If the members feel he
would be the best person to represent the principles, ideals and
goals, well, it has to happen by July 1.''
</P>
<P>
   Verney, who often represents Perot's views, was equally unsure
whether Buchanan's ultimate goal was to run for president or
rebuild the Reform Party in his own image.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strange strategy,'' Verney said of Buchanan's recent
aggressiveness. ``I don't understand throwing sharp elbows at
would-be friends. It makes you wonder whether his goal is to be
elected president on Nov. 7 or own a party on Nov. 8.''
</P>
<P>
   Both, Bay Buchanan said. ``Pat wants to be president and he
wants to build the party,'' she said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Goodman has been collecting signatures of support for
Perot, Jim Mangia, the Reform Party's national secretary, has been
talking to Green Party leaders about Nader's interest in running as
the Reform candidate. Despite Nader's leftward leanings, his
politics are not so different from the Reform platform on issues
like campaign finance reform and permanent trading status for
China.
</P>
<P>
   Problems lurk, however. Only 36 states allow a candidate to run
with the support of more than one party, and it remains unclear
which party, Reform or Green, would receive federal money for 2004
should Nader win 5 percent of the vote running on both tickets.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe all this is too much for the Reform Party now. Donna
Donovan, the party press secretary, said that some members, ``as a
last-ditch option,'' believe the party should sit out the
presidential campaign this year and build for the future instead.
</P>
<P>
   While highly unlikely, such thinking reflects concern among some
party members that Buchanan will be the inevitable nominee. Not to
worry, said Bay Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're at the embryonic stage as a party,'' she said. ``Pat is
bringing in new blood and a new image to the party, I'm sure, and
we want to have a strong third party.
</P>
<P>
   ``So if it gets a conservative tint this time, someone else wins
four years later, and then it'll have a different tint.''

VENEZUELAN COURT ORDERS ELECTIONS POSTPONED 
</HEADLINE>
   By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the
postponement of the election scheduled for Sunday, saying that the
``reliability and transparency'' of the electoral process could not
be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise ruling was rendered after the National Electoral
Council had conceded at a judicial hearing that it could not ensure
an accurate, timely and fair vote count. No new date was set for
the balloting, and the court ordered that all campaign activities
be suspended until the Congress, which President Hugo Chavez
controls, chooses a date.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing foreign reporters at a news conference here Thursday
morning, Chavez said he favored delaying the vote for president and
more than 6,000 other posts and that he thought it ``likely that
this will occur.'' He acknowledged that ``serious technical
difficulties'' had developed and urged the council to take the
appropriate steps ``to avoid a disaster'' that would tarnish the
country's image.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, 45, a former army colonel who led an unsuccessful coup
attempt in 1992, compared the situation to a baseball game in which
``the teams are in the dugout, the pitchers are warmed up, and the
fans are in the stands,'' but a heavy rain obscures and inundates
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that situation,'' he added, ``the smartest decision for the
umpires is to postpone the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Chavez leading his main opponent and former comrade
in arms, Francisco Arias Cardenas, by a comfortable margin. It is,
thus, clearly in his political interest, as his supporters were
quick to recognize, to avoid a repetition of the situation in Peru,
where elections have been marred by accusations that President
Alberto K. Fujimori is manipulating the apparatus to reduce the
opposition vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``A delay is not going to change the results,'' Interior and
Justice Minister Luis Alfonso Davila said in a brief conversation
with reporters this morning. ``No matter when the vote is held,
Hugo Chavez is going to win, and win big.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution that Venezuelans approved in December, no
elections were supposed to have been held until six months after a
new electoral code went into effect. But Chavez was eager to
capitalize on his popularity and win a new six-year term. The newly
established Supreme Judicial Tribunal, whose independence has been
questioned by opposition forces, ruled that the restrictions did
not apply retroactively.
</P>
<P>
   A tide of complaints about the ability of the National Electoral
Council, which Chavez forces dominate, to administer the vote had
been building. But as late as Wednesday night, council members had
continued to maintain that the complete vote would proceed on
Sunday, ``come rain or shine, thunder or lightning,'' as one of
them put it.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout occurred after several days in which the members
and other government officials had sought to fix the blame for the
problems on the American and Spanish companies that were hired to
carry out the balloting. On Tuesday, the council president,
Estanislao Gonzalez, complained that the foreign companies had
violated their contracts by failing to meet deadlines to deliver
software and equipment. And he hinted at sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, the American company said it was ``totally
dependent on having complete and accurate data from the National
Electoral Council.'' The statement said that some required data had
not been delivered as of Monday and that the electoral council had
requested more than 11,000 changes in the list of candidates to be
programmed into voting machines.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort to avoid postponing the vote, Chavez sent
Air Force planes to the company headquarters in Omaha to fetch
computer equipment needed to program electronic voting machines
here. He also tried to enlist the American Embassy here in his
effort, saying that ``some gesture on the part of the United States
government'' was needed ``because this is a state problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of other incidents that involved the state political
police, known as Disip, had also clouded the picture and generated
concerns about the integrity of the vote. News accounts said police
agents entered the electoral council headquarters early Wednesday
and seized part of the electoral database.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Disip agents are said to have confiscated the
passports of and threatened harm to foreign technicians who are
working with the council. One Spanish employee was reported to have
had a pistol thrust into his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The American and Spanish embassies have issued diplomatic notes
protesting what the Americans called ``the unconscionable
treatment'' of citizens at the hands of the political police.
</P>
<P>
   At the news session Thursday, Chavez acknowledged that ``some
excesses'' might have occurred and said the police conduct was
under investigation. But he maintained that abuses could ``occur
with the police anywhere in the world,'' pointing to how American
officials took custody of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old from Cuba,
in Miami.

<P>
   Transport Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, a candidate for prime
minister in 1999, will be prosecuted on three criminal counts of
sexual assault and harassment, the attorney general's office
announced. A highly decorated former army officer and defense
minister, Mordechai has said he will resign, waive his

   Authorities lifted a ban on travel to Palestinian-ruled Jericho,
imposed a week ago after the firebombing of an Israeli car there.
Palestinian authorities said they arrested three men in connection
with the attack, which left a 2-year-old girl hospitalized with
severe burns. Jericho is heavily dependent on Israeli tourist

   The government rejected a plea from the private businesses that
state-owned companies help pay industry's share of the compensation
fund for Nazi-era slave laborers. The private companies are $800
million short of collecting its half of the $4.6 billion in
payments. According to fund officials, many companies are reluctant
to contribute until they receive a guarantee against lawsuits.

   Moving to close a painful chapter in its history, government
officials met to offer regret and sympathy to an elderly Jewish
brother and sister whose parents were gassed by the Nazis after
Switzerland expelled the family in World War II. The government
agreed to pay Charles and Sabine Sonabend $118,000 in a lawsuit
settlement. Bern has never before voluntarily agreed to payments to

   FRANCE, SWEDEN: CROP DESTRUCTION

<P>
   France and Sweden ordered farmers to destroy about 1,500 acres
of oil rapeseed. The fields were mistakenly planted with some seeds
with herbicide resistance created by genetic modification, a
technique common in North America but not permitted in Europe. Less
than 1 percent of seeds sown in the acreage were involved,
according to estimates, and neither government knows exactly where
the fields are, but both governments hope farmers will cooperate.

   The police found bomb-making chemicals and devices in a Dublin
apartment and questioned a man they suspected of being a member of
the renegade Real IRA. The splinter group was reportedly
responsible for the 1998 car-bomb killing of 29 people in Omagh,
Northern Ireland, and is opposed to the peace accord, which is
facing a critical test in Belfast this weekend. The Ulster
Unionists vote Saturday whether to accept the Irish Republican
Army's offer to permit arms-dump inspections as reason to go back
into government with Sinn Fein, the IRA's political arm.

SUSPECT IS HELD IN NEWS ANCHOR'S KILLING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Police carrying out one of the biggest homicide
investigations ever in Britain arrested a man Thursday in
connection with the shooting last year of Jill Dando, the most
popular female television personality on the BBC.
</P>
<P>
   Detectives from the Metropolitan Police arrested the man at his
West London apartment, not far from where Dando was shot on her
doorstep in fashionable Fulham last May 27.
</P>
<P>
   While three other men had been arrested for questioning and
released over the last year, police sources said detectives were
eyeing this latest suspect more intensely, holding him ``on
suspicion of murder.'' Under that legal catch phrase, detectives
can detain the suspect without charge for 36 hours, and can
petition a magistrate to hold him even longer.
</P>
<P>
   The detective leading the investigation has said he believes
Dando was killed by a stalker who was obsessed with her because of
her high profile as the BBC's most popular female personality.
</P>
<P>
   While police refused to identify the suspect, and are not
required to unless he is charged, one source said he was among the
original batch of suspects, which at one point numbered about 300.
</P>
<P>
   Dando's slaying, in the middle of the day in a city where such
acts of violence are rare, shocked the nation and led to one of the
most intense manhunts in British history. But police were
frustrated by the lack of solid eyewitness statements and spent
much of the last year chasing down fruitless leads.
</P>
<P>
   Neighbors reported hearing Dando scream and saw a well-dressed
man in his late 30s or early 40s carrying a cellular telephone,
running from the scene. A police source described the suspect
arrested Thursday as being ``in that age group.''
</P>
<P>
   Dando, 37, had become one of Britain's most recognizable faces
by hosting the BBC program ``Crimewatch UK,'' which broadcast
stories about unsolved crimes so viewers could call in tips to help
police. It was a similar program, and the tips it yielded last
month, that steered detectives back toward the current suspect, one
police source said.
</P>
<P>
   Such was Dando's prominence in British popular culture that
within hours of her death Queen Elizabeth and Prime Minister Tony
Blair had expressed condolences to her family.
</P>
<P>
   Dando's popularity stemmed from her girl-next-door appearance
and demeanor. Besides the crime tip program, she hosted a popular
travel show. Dando, who occupied a place in British television
similar to Katie Couric on American TV, had been stalked by a
62-year-old male fan two years ago, but police doubt that he had
anything to do with her killing.

FROM UR, THE FIRST AND MOST FAMOUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Pa., Ill., Mich., Britain, Iraq)   By ROBERTA SMITH   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mesopotamia, whose name comes from the Greek for
``between the rivers,'' is one of the places where it all began, a
cradle of Western civilization, like ancient Egypt. The rivers are
the Tigris and the Euphrates, and the land between is a flood plain
that today is in Iraq. It was inhospitable terrain: flat, arid and
lacking in indigenous plant life or useful materials like stone,
metals and wood.
</P>
<P>
   But in the seventh millennium BC it was settled by people whom
historians call Sumerians. By the late fourth millennium, the
Sumerians began to meet the requirements for ranking as a cradle of
civilization. They probably invented the wheel; they established
one of the world's first irrigation systems, essential to both
agriculture and flood control; and they created one of the first
written languages. The keeping of written records made large urban
centers possible _ most notably the city-states of Uruk and Ur _ as
well as an elaborate economy that included trade with places as far
away as Afghanistan (from which the Sumerians imported various
kinds of stone).
</P>
<P>
   Beginning about 3500 BC, the Sumerians also produced artworks of
lasting beauty. Some of these, belonging to the University of
Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, form the core
of ``Treasures From the Royal Tombs of Ur,'' a sumptuous exhibition
at the Pierpont Morgan Library in Manhattan. The show will travel
to the Oriental Institute Museum in Chicago in October and to the
Detroit Institute of Art in February.
</P>
<P>
   Everything in this show came to light between 1922 and 1934,
when archaeologists sponsored by the university and the British
Museum discovered and excavated a vast cemetery full of hundreds of
intact, often lavishly equipped tombs at Ur, the southernmost of
the ancient Sumerian city-states. Leading the team was C. Leonard
Woolley (1880-1960), an English archaeologist known for his energy
and meticulousness.
</P>
<P>
   Gertrude Bell, another archaeologist of the time, described
Woolley as ``a tiresome little man but a first class digger.'' At
the Morgan, photographs blown up to sepia-toned wall murals
indicate the substantial size of one of the main pits at Ur and
also the work force. But once the heavy work was done, Woolley
usually sent everyone away and did the most delicate,
time-consuming excavating himself, working face down in the dirt
with a knife and a little brush beside his wife, Catherine, who was
also an archaeologist, and one trusted assistant.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter quoted in the catalog, he describes the tedium of
stringing beads from this vantage point, the better to preserve the
order in which they were found.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who has taken an introductory survey of western art has
seen images of the exhibition's stars. There is the so-called
ram-caught-in-the-thicket, a small sculpture of an avid ram made of
gold, lapis lazuli and silver, whose wool is ingeniously depicted
as rows of spearheadlike pieces of shell. He stands on his hind
feet, as if to graze on a gold tree. There is also the Great Lyre,
with its big prow-like bull's head bearded in lapis. Just below is
the lyre's four-tiered inlaid front panel, rich in intimations of
gods and myths to come.
</P>
<P>
   The panel's four scenes include one of the first appearances of
what art historians call the nude bearded hero as well as figures
and creatures that presage the Holy Trinity, the minotaur, the
clever beasts of Aesop and a scorpion-tailed man resembling a
devil. All the standard textbooks of Western art reproduce two of
these three items.
</P>
<P>
   It is, however, something else to see the real thing, and in the
company of nearly 200 other objects from the tombs, sensitively
lighted and displayed in nearly invisible vitrines. There have been
significant reconservations: the ram's feet, for example. After an
earlier conservation, they had hung oddly in the air in
reproductions published as recently as 1993; now they rest on the
tree's gold boughs, as if on the handlebars of a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   The show also has gold, silver and carved stone vessels; vessels
carved in calcite, a pale translucent stone; tools and weapons;
and, perhaps most interesting, the small stone cylinder seals that
served important people as amulets and early identification cards.
(These are supplemented by a selection of Middle Eastern cylinder
seals from the library's own holdings, displayed in the East Room.)
Most prevalent is all manner of jewelry: headdresses, rings,
earrings, cloak pins, beaded necklaces and chokers, belts and even
a beaded cape worn by Queen Puabi, whose grave accounts for more
than half the exhibition.
</P>
<P>
   The assembled objects suggest that the Sumerians lived well and
died even better. Not only were their bodies lavishly adorned and
surrounded by objects both useful and entertaining (lyres, for
example, and little lapis tablets that may be the first dominoes),
but they were also accompanied by attendants, themselves richly
adorned, along with oxen and carts. The burial was the culmination
of a feast and processional march into the tomb, where the animals
were slaughtered and the attendants either committed suicide or
were ritually killed.
</P>
<P>
   The objects in this exhibition suggest their own purely visual
criteria for qualifying as a cradle of civilization. While neither
as unbending nor as pure as the Egyptians, the Sumerians achieved a
consistency of style that operated over a range of media:
sculpture, incised relief, inlay and the incised cylinder seals,
whose cartoonlike narratives are made visible here with enlarged
photographs of modern clay impressions.
</P>
<P>
   Given the barbarism of human sacrifice, the style was
surprisingly buoyant, characterized by a wide-eyed innocence and
alertness that are also visible in Minoan and Etruscan figures.
(The Sumerian animals are also depicted with wide round eyes: those
of the bull on the Great Lyre, emphasized by repeating creases,
make clear why targets are known as bull's-eyes.)
</P>
<P>
   The recurrence of certain motifs from one medium to another is a
further consistency and indicates art's mirroring of life. The
sketchy lines visible around the heads of the tiny figures on the
cylinder seals are drinking tubes, like a long gold one, resembling
a bit of miniaturized plumbing pipe, in one of the vitrines. The
fringed garments worn by the figures are sheepskin, as verified by
a front panel for a lyre where a figure wears a garment incised
with the same spear shapes that appear in three-dimensions on the
back of the ram.
</P>
<P>
   An oddly shaped pouring vessel appears in the hand of an upright
lion in the front panel of the Great Lyre, and others like it are
in a vitrine. These vessels seem to have developed from the
bisected conch shells used for the same purpose, which are also in
the show.
</P>
<P>
   Lions are a frequent subject, especially impressive in a simple
cast silver lion's head with staring eyes of lapis and shell. Also
intriguing is a small, bedraggled copper relief that shows two
striding beasts facing in opposite directions, as they would nearly
2,000 years later in the stone reliefs of Assyrian art. That lions
were both a symbol of power and a real threat is apparent again in
the cylinder seals, where they are repeatedly shown attacking
domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   One of the less expected pleasures here is the plentiful
jewelry. In addition to suggesting that beautification of the human
form is among the most ancient impulses, it also reflects a
continually evolving ingenuity and technology. In jewelry the
Sumerians made extensive use of three materials, all imported: red
carnelian, blue lapis lazuli and gold.
</P>
<P>
   This triumvirate _ a mineral version of the primary colors _
recurs in different ratios, combinations and motifs. In beads and
other elements of varying shape and size, it is a leitmotif that
grows surely and irresistibly into a major theme of the exhibition.

E. COLI OUTBREAK LEAVES FIVE DEAD 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   OTTAWA _ Five people, including an infant, died Thursday and
doctors said they expect more deaths amid one of the worst
outbreaks of E. coli bacterial infection in Canadian history.
</P>
<P>
   A contaminated public water system in the Ontario farming town
of Walkerton was the source of the epidemic, although doctors said
a delayed reaction by town authorities was to blame for the
extraordinary number of cases.
</P>
<P>
   More than 700 people were ill with serious symptoms _ including
severe cramps, vomiting, and diarrhea _ while scores were admitted
to regional hospitals, including 20 children and elderly people who
remained in critical condition Thursday night, battling for their
lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's never been anything like this in Canada of this
magnitude, never,'' said Dr. Murray McQuigge, the regional health
officer. The town of Walkerton, 80 miles northwest of Toronto, has
4,800 residents.
</P>
<P>
   Physicians warned that there are almost certain to be more
deaths in coming days, saying that the warning issued by the public
water utility, which advised people to boil water, came far too
late to avert disaster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Statistically, we're expecting more deaths within the next few
days,'' said Dr. Gary Bajurny, an area physician. ``It's scary
because there are no good treatments for this.''
</P>
<P>
   Three children were in intensive care at Children's Hospital of
Western Ontario, two on kidney dialysis machines. Their prospects
for survival were considered poor.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely cause of the contamination was cow manure
carried into the public system during heavy rains and flooding on
May 12, according to the province's health and environmental
officials.
</P>
<P>
   Public health doctors raised strong concerns about water quality
last week, but the warnings were shrugged off by utility officials,
according to McQuigge.
</P>
<P>
   ``This could have been prevented,'' he said. ``We were given
assurances the water was safe even though we were already seeing
the first cases and were becoming alarmed.''
</P>
<P>
   The dead include a 2-year-old baby and an 82-year-old woman. The
three other victims were described as elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The very young and the very old are the most susceptible to
``Escherichia coli 0157:H7,'' the scientific name for a dangerous
strain of E. coli whose usual home is the digestive system of cows.
A benign strain of E. coli is the most common bacteria in the human
intestines.
</P>
<P>
   Small-scale outbreaks of E. coli poisoning are commonplace and
usually linked to tainted food, often undercooked meats. But
contamination of public drinking water supplies infecting large
numbers of people are exceedingly rare in North America.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking at an epidemic,'' McQuigge said.
</P>
<P>
   Walkerton's five schools and a day-care center were shut down
Thursday, and bottled water was distributed at crossroads by
emergency workers. Most local businesses closed and flags were
flown at half-staff.
</P>
<P>
   Hospital emergency rooms and medical clinics reported phone
lines jammed by hundreds of anxious callers, many suffering
symptoms.
</P>
<P>
   But modern medicine is largely impotent in the face of the
insidious germ. Doctors can do little more than advise patients to
consume large amounts of safe water _ to avoid dehydration _ and
let the infection run its course. In the worst cases, the bacteria
attacks the kidneys, causing serious damage and sometimes death.
</P>
<P>
   Angry residents stormed a news briefing held by Walkerton Mayor
David Thomson and accused public officials of negligence.
``Somebody should be held responsible,'' said Jacques Gosselin, a
resident of Walkerton who was briefly hospitalized with E. coli
poisoning last week. ``Lives have been lost. It's disgraceful.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials acknowledged Wednesday that the machine that injects
bacteria-killing chlorine into the town's drinking supply had been
broken ``for some time'' and that water samples taken on May 15
showed that Walkerton's water was contaminated. It was unclear why
authorities failed to warn residents.

VENEZUELAN COURT ORDERS ELECTIONS POSTPONED 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Changes `this morning' to `Thursday morning' in 7th graph.) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARACAS, Venezuela _ The Supreme Court on Thursday ordered the
postponement of the election scheduled for Sunday, saying that the
``reliability and transparency'' of the electoral process could not
be guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise ruling was rendered after the National Electoral
Council had conceded at a judicial hearing that it could not ensure
an accurate, timely and fair vote count. No new date was set for
the balloting, and the court ordered that all campaign activities
be suspended until the Congress, which President Hugo Chavez
controls, chooses a date.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing foreign reporters at a news conference here Thursday
morning, Chavez said he favored delaying the vote for president and
more than 6,000 other posts and that he thought it ``likely that
this will occur.'' He acknowledged that ``serious technical
difficulties'' had developed and urged the council to take the
appropriate steps ``to avoid a disaster'' that would tarnish the
country's image.
</P>
<P>
   Chavez, 45, a former army colonel who led an unsuccessful coup
attempt in 1992, compared the situation to a baseball game in which
``the teams are in the dugout, the pitchers are warmed up, and the
fans are in the stands,'' but a heavy rain obscures and inundates
the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``In that situation,'' he added, ``the smartest decision for the
umpires is to postpone the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Polls show Chavez leading his main opponent and former comrade
in arms, Francisco Arias Cardenas, by a comfortable margin. It is,
thus, clearly in his political interest, as his supporters were
quick to recognize, to avoid a repetition of the situation in Peru,
where elections have been marred by accusations that President
Alberto K. Fujimori is manipulating the apparatus to reduce the
opposition vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``A delay is not going to change the results,'' Interior and
Justice Minister Luis Alfonso Davila said in a brief conversation
with reporters Thursday morning. ``No matter when the vote is held,
Hugo Chavez is going to win, and win big.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the Constitution that Venezuelans approved in December, no
elections were supposed to have been held until six months after a
new electoral code went into effect. But Chavez was eager to
capitalize on his popularity and win a new six-year term. The newly
established Supreme Judicial Tribunal, whose independence has been
questioned by opposition forces, ruled that the restrictions did
not apply retroactively.
</P>
<P>
   A tide of complaints about the ability of the National Electoral
Council, which Chavez forces dominate, to administer the vote had
been building. But as late as Wednesday night, council members had
continued to maintain that the complete vote would proceed on
Sunday, ``come rain or shine, thunder or lightning,'' as one of
them put it.
</P>
<P>
   The turnabout occurred after several days in which the members
and other government officials had sought to fix the blame for the
problems on the American and Spanish companies that were hired to
carry out the balloting. On Tuesday, the council president,
Estanislao Gonzalez, complained that the foreign companies had
violated their contracts by failing to meet deadlines to deliver
software and equipment. And he hinted at sabotage.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, the American company said it was ``totally
dependent on having complete and accurate data from the National
Electoral Council.'' The statement said that some required data had
not been delivered as of Monday and that the electoral council had
requested more than 11,000 changes in the list of candidates to be
programmed into voting machines.
</P>
<P>
   In a last-ditch effort to avoid postponing the vote, Chavez sent
Air Force planes to the company headquarters in Omaha to fetch
computer equipment needed to program electronic voting machines
here. He also tried to enlist the American Embassy here in his
effort, saying that ``some gesture on the part of the United States
government'' was needed ``because this is a state problem.''
</P>
<P>
   A series of other incidents that involved the state political
police, known as Disip, had also clouded the picture and generated
concerns about the integrity of the vote. News accounts said police
agents entered the electoral council headquarters early Wednesday
and seized part of the electoral database.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Disip agents are said to have confiscated the
passports of and threatened harm to foreign technicians who are
working with the council. One Spanish employee was reported to have
had a pistol thrust into his mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The American and Spanish embassies have issued diplomatic notes
protesting what the Americans called ``the unconscionable
treatment'' of citizens at the hands of the political police.
</P>
<P>
   At the news session Thursday, Chavez acknowledged that ``some
excesses'' might have occurred and said the police conduct was
under investigation. But he maintained that abuses could ``occur
with the police anywhere in the world,'' pointing to how American
officials took custody of Elian Gonzalez, the 6-year-old from Cuba,
in Miami.

SURGEON GENERAL FINDS `SILENT EPIDEMIC' IN DENTAL CARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RAJA MISHRA  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite significant leaps in dental care over the last century,
the teeth, gums and throats of poor and minority Americans are in
worse shape on average than the rest of the country, according to
the US surgeon general, who called it a ``silent epidemic'' that
severely drains national resources.
</P>
<P>
   In a report released Thursday, Surgeon General David Satcher,
the nation's top doctor, cited a lack of dental coverage among the
poor and a paucity of minority dentists as key causes of the
disparity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who suffer the worst oral health are found among the
poor of all ages, with poor children and poor older Americans
particularly vulnerable,'' wrote Satcher in the preface to the
report. ``Members of racial and ethnic minority groups also
experience a disproportionate level of oral health problems.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, he chastised the public as a whole for its
lackadaisical approach to dental care, saying that tooth decay,
cavities, oral cancers and other dental ailments were needlessly
occurring in massive numbers.
</P>
<P>
   It was the first time the surgeon general's office has taken aim
at oral health. The office has famously attacked tobacco companies
in the past and earlier this year evaluated the state of US mental
health services. Shedding light on racial disparities has been a
hallmark of Satcher's tenure as the nation's first African-American
surgeon general.
</P>
<P>
   Among the report's findings:
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Almost one-third of the US population, or 100 million
people, lack community water fluoridation, the treatment of
drinking water with chemicals that helps prevent tooth decay _
which is considered to be the greatest advance in dental health of
the 20th century.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)About 108 million people lack dental insurance, 2 1/2
times the number of people who lack medical insurance.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)Poor children have tooth decay at twice the rate of
children who are not poor. In addition, tooth decay is more likely
to go untreated among the poor.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)About 30 percent of people over 65 have no teeth as a
result of dental problems. The number is higher among those living
below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
   (BBOX)The five-year survival rate for white people with oral or
throat cancer is 56 percent. For African-Americans, it is 34
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts state legislators recently began studying these
income and racial disparities In March, a special commission of
dental experts that spent 18 months probing the problem offered
Beacon Hill a solution: reimburse dentists more for treating the
poor and some of the disparities will diminish. Dentists are
fleeing poor neighborhoods in droves because they lose money under
the current rates, they explained.
</P>
<P>
   The House recently passed a bill that would increase Medicaid
dental funding by $29.7 million, the amount recommended by the
commission. The Senate approved a $19.7 million increase. The
chambers are attempting to forge a middle ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of untreated tooth decay in this country is
found in 25 percent of the population,'' said Robert Compton,
director of disease management for the Delta Dental Plan of
Massachusetts and a member of the commission. ``And this 25 percent
is mostly the poor, who don't have access to care.''
</P>
<P>
   Satcher's report urged all health care workers to stress oral
health to patients with the same emphasis usually reserved for
standard health care. He made a similar plea on behalf of mental
health earlier this year. Satcher also urged public officials to
include oral health when crafting public health policy and
increased efforts to recruit minority dentists.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst the mostly dry, clinical tone of the report, the
authors offered a striking, almost poetic, rationale for taking
oral health seriously: ``These are tissues whose functions we take
for granted, yet they represent the very essence of our humanity.
They allow us to speak and smile; sigh and kiss; smell, taste,
touch, chew, and swallow; cry out in pain; and convey a world of
feelings and emotions through facial expressions.''

POLL SAYS LAZIO   NECK AND NECK WITH CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Less than a week after jumping into the US Senate
race, Republican Rick Lazio _ an obscure-to-unknown congressman
from Long Island _ is running neck and neck with First Lady Hillary
Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   A poll of 713 likely voters, taken over the past three days,
shows Clinton at 45.8 percent and Lazio at 43.8 percent. Because
the poll, released Thursday, has a 3.8-percentage-point margin of
error, the two candidates are essentially tied.
</P>
<P>
   Even the pollster, John Zogby, was surprised by how quickly
Lazio has caught up. ``Wow!'' he said. ``This is going to be just
as tight as Hillary versus Rudy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Rudy'' refers to Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, who dropped out of
the race a week ago, citing concerns about treatment for his
prostate cancer. Giuliani also announced May 10 that he and his
wife were separating in the wake of the disclosure of his
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   The remarkable thing about Thursday's Clinton-Lazio poll is that
its numbers are nearly identical to the final Clinton-Giuliani poll
_ suggesting that Clinton's biggest obstacle in this contest is her
own negative image.
</P>
<P>
   She is improving on this score. When asked for their opinion of
Clinton, 59 percent said they had a favorable view _ more than in
previous polls _ but 38 percent still have an unfavorable view, and
two-thirds of those people label their view ``very unfavorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Among several key groups of voters _ suburbanites, people who
live upstate, and whites in general _ more than 40 percent have a
negative impression of her.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 percent of those polled have an unfavorable opinion of
Lazio. However, 43 percent say they do not know enough about him to
form an opinion. The latter figure has good and bad implications
for Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The bad news: Even with so many voters unfamiliar with Lazio,
she still cannot do any better than tie him. The good news: There's
still plenty of time for a negative image of him to take shape.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the little that the public has seen of Lazio so far has,
at the very least, not hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   A week ago, when it became clear he would replace Giuliani in
the race and hardly anybody outside Long Island knew anything about
him, a Zogby poll showed Clinton ahead 45.7 to 32.2, with 17.4
percent undecided.
</P>
<P>
   Since officially announcing his candidacy Saturday, Lazio has
appeared on nationwide TV and made quick-dart visits all over the
state, and has picked up more than 11 points. Another 7 points have
moved from Clinton's camp to the uncertain column. Clinton,
meanwhile, has not moved a hair.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with when she was running against Giuliani, Clinton
appears to have widened her lead in New York City (where she leads
Lazio, 62 percent to 30 percent) and among Jews (56-32). But
upstate, where she and the mayor were tied, Lazio has pulled ahead
(46-41). And he maintains Giuliani's solid margin in the suburbs
(54-36) and among Catholics (52-39).
</P>
<P>
   The poll indicates the two are tied among independent voters and
Protestants. Lazio also picks up a little bit of strength among
African-American voters: Against Giuliani, Clinton led 94 percent
to 2 percent; now, she beats Lazio 85-9.
</P>
<P>
   The poll results were released as the National Abortion Rights
Action League of New York endorsed Clinton. It had been neutral,
but swung to Clinton because of Lazio's support for a ban on
so-called ``partial birth abortions'' and his opposition to federal
funding for abortions.

`8{ WOMEN': A FATHER AND SON LIVIN' LA DOLCE VITA 
</HEADLINE>
  (EDS: Production notes at end)  By STEPHEN HOLDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Even when a movie aspires to the intricate structure and weight
of a knotty modernist poem, how good can it be when watching it
gives you the queasy feeling that you are taking a math exam? That
question could be applied to almost every work by the British
filmmaker Peter Greenaway, whose movies, to a greater or lesser
extent, feel like hybrids of art school essays and brain-tickling
puzzles.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, Greenaway, at his best, can be a brilliant theoretician
and collagist. But there is often something forbiddingly inhuman
about his cinematic chess matches, which make Stanley Kubrick's
most elaborate cinematic games look like child's play.
</P>
<P>
   Greenaway's newest film, ``8{ Women,'' is, among other things, a
homage to Federico Fellini's 1963 masterpiece ``8{,'' fragments of
which are shown early in the movie. Just as Marcello Mastroianni
served as the director's alter ego in that film, here the main
character, Philip Emmenthal (John Standing), a middle-aged widower,
is apparently a stand-in for Greenaway. In charting the erotic
adventures of Philip and his son, Storey (Matthew Delamere), who
establish a private bordello on their Geneva estate, the movie is
Greenaway's personal take on a theme that obsessed Fellini: the
erotic mystery and power of women. Although ``8{ Women'' throws in
a group of nuns late in the game, its allusions to Fellini's
Catholicism seem halfheartedly dutiful.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, Philip wonders out loud if Fellini slept with the
actresses who appeared in his movies or if he had Mastroianni do
this for him. When he asks his son how many filmmakers make movies
to satisfy their sexual fantasies, Storey replies that most
probably do. And so we are treated to Greenaway's fantasies, which
are pretty standard, although adorned with the stereotypical
British kinks (a fascination with undergarments and the posterior).
</P>
<P>
   But as ``8{ Women'' quickly reveals, the two directors are
really poles apart in their attitudes toward sex. Even though the
film flaunts full frontal nudity (both male and female) and plenty
of frank sexual talk, it is so visually and emotionally chilly that
its effect is often anti-erotic.
</P>
<P>
   When studying human flesh, Greenaway and his production
designers have a way of making even well-shaped naked bodies look
unappetizing. Plenty of beautiful women traipse through the movie,
but their skin appears chalky and porous. The actual sex, none of
it very explicit, is charged with neither passion nor even much
lust. The couplings have the feel of laboratory experiments during
which desire is analyzed to death.
</P>
<P>
   Fellini's women, especially the giant prostitutes he
contemplated with the awe of a little boy peering up at a mountain,
may have been threatening, but his Mediterranean slopes were steamy
and lushly foliated. Greenaway's women are as enigmatic and as
threatening as Fellini's, but most are photographed to appear as
chilly as corpses. This is odd in a film where shots frequently
allude reverently to famous nude paintings. As a seminar on the
changing image of women in art, the movie is a turn-off.
</P>
<P>
   Several of those who join the bordello are Japanese, imported
from Kyoto, where they exposed themselves to blackmail by their
addiction to gambling in pachinko parlors. These Asian archetypes
range from a dragon lady to a Madame Butterfly-like refugee from
the Kabuki theater who can respond to Philip only if he adopts the
disguise and manners of a Kabuki female impersonator. The gambling
theme is illustrated to tedious redundancy with images of tumbling
coins that along with the earthquakes that periodically rumble
through the movie are meant to symbolize love as an earthshaking
game of chance, a natural event that's inevitable and can't be
precisely predicted.
</P>
<P>
   In Greenaway's imagination, as in Fellini's, women end up
calling the shots. Having arrived at the bordello, the women
establish the rules. Then, one by one, they end up leaving the
estate.
</P>
<P>
   The most vivid and powerful female character, Palmira (Polly
Walker), is a free-spirited but demanding sensualist who gives
herself to Philip and ultimately kills him with her inexhaustible
libido. For the role of Beryl, a woman who loves horses and pigs,
Amanda Plummer sports a bizarre S-and-M getup reminiscent of her
bondage gear in ``Butterfly Kiss.'' Natacha Amal is Giaconda, an
avaricious baby-making machine who drives a hard bargain and sells
her newborns for $25,000 apiece.
</P>
<P>
   With its stiffly staged, symbol-laden visual tableaus, ``8{
Women'' unfolds like an art history textbook. What it reveals is
finally less than meets the eye. Its message is quite simple and
all too familiar: when it comes to sex, all men are little boys.

   NASHVILLE _ Returning to his home state Thursday, Vice President
Al Gore proposed spending $11 billion over 10 years to expand
after-school programs and provide a new tax credit to help families
pay for after-school activities.
</P>
<P>
   Visiting a YMCA classroom with parents and small, squirming
children, Gore said he wanted to help working parents concerned
about their kids coming home to empty houses and vacuous television
shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``After-school for millions of children can make the critical
difference and help parents raise the children that they love,''
said Gore, who was kicking off a series of addresses about
pressures on the American family, with a talk about fatherhood
still to come.
</P>
<P>
   Gore told his audience that children are most at risk for drugs
and violence between 3 and 7 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fill up that time with useful activities,'' he urged.
``After-school doesn't have to be a time for mischievous hands and
idle minds.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore proposed:
</P>
<P>
   --Expanding programs to provide children in failing schools with
extra after-school help while their school is being turned around.
</P>
<P>
   --Giving a new after-school tax credit to families with children
6 to 16 years old, providing up to 50 percent of the cost for
after-school expenses according to income.
</P>
<P>
   --Challenging every school to extend its hours for after-school
programs.
</P>
<P>
   --Some federal financial help for recruiting and training staff
for after-school programs and for expanding programs such as the
YMCA and Big Brothers/Big Sisters.
</P>
<P>
   Also Thursday, Gore met with state party chairmen and attended a
Democratic National Committee fund-raiser. The state party chairs,
including representatives from New Hampshire and Maine, spent the
day meeting with top campaign officials and consultants before
hearing from Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said the state officials
were discussing plans to coordinate local and state races with the
presidential campaign, in order to maintain a unified message.
Similar discussions took place last month with Democratic mayors
from around the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ William Merritt Chase (1849-1916) and Maxfield
Parrish (1870-1966), a generation apart, were in their day very
popular artists. Each wielded a brush with true virtuosity; Chase
in a filtered Impressionist style seen as ``high'' art, Parrish in
a tight, finicky illustrational mode that left out no detail. They
had little else in common until now, with the conjunction of their
shows at the Brooklyn Museum of Art.
</P>
<P>
   It is a matter of logistics: the Chase show was ready just as
the touring Parrish show was scheduled to make its Brooklyn stop.
But the simultaneity of these two very American exhibitions will,
it is hoped, direct attention to one of the world's most important
collections of American art: the 2,500 paintings, sculptures,
watercolors and pastels dating from 1720 to 1945 in the Brooklyn
Museum collection. (Its American galleries are to undergo an
extensive reinstallation and reopen in July 2001. The department is
also working on a long-awaited catalog of the American collection.)
</P>
<P>
   Of the shows, the more aesthetically significant is ``William
Merritt Chase: Modern American Landscapes, 1886-1890,'' organized
by Barbara Dayer Gallati, curator of American painting and
sculpture at the museum. Chase had a long, distinguished run as a
painter, teacher and art politician, but Gallati zeros in on the
five-year period when his career was at low tide. She has come up
with new insights about the Brooklyn and Manhattan paintings Chase
did in those years.
</P>
<P>
   The 35 oils and pastels in the show are important not so much
for their scenic content, engaging as it is, but because they are
the first paintings in which an Impressionist style was used to
depict American subjects.
</P>
<P>
   Although many of his urban park and coastal scenes are quite
familiar, Gallati wondered why some of the works, long identified
as sites in Central and Prospect Parks, did not really look like
those places. Closer inspection revealed misidentifications. Some
of the Prospect Park scenes, for instance, really depicted Tompkins
Park (now called Von King Park) in Bedford-Stuyvesant _ today much
modified from its appearance in Chase's time _ and the Brooklyn
Navy Yard.
</P>
<P>
   Having corrected those longstanding errors, Gallati began to
examine the genteel Brooklyn and Manhattan scenes of 1886 to 1890,
reflecting a privileged, upper-class view, in broader cultural
terms. Chase painted them, she writes in the show's catalog, not
only because they were part of his Brooklyn surroundings at the
time; he also wanted to present them to the world as examples of
``civilized urban landscapes'' that accorded with the European
avant-garde model of modern life.
</P>
<P>
   A group was shown at the 1889 Paris Exposition Universelle, one
of the great world's fairs, where they were the only American views
that referred to a specific American city and its environs.
</P>
<P>
   Their presentation at such an august event, Gallati argues,
means that they had special significance for the artist.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, the paintings marked a transition in Chase's style.
Their airy lightness was in sharp contrast to the dark, Old
Masterish tones of the Munich school in which he was trained,
criticized by American art writers as too European, writes Gallati.
</P>
<P>
   The more avant-garde Impressionist manner in which he did the
park paintings was no less European, but because the Impressionists
had no role in training Americans, as the Munich teachers did,
Chase effectively silenced his American critics while setting
himself up as a peer of his innovative French contemporaries.
</P>
<P>
   Three paintings in the Brooklyn show were among those exhibited
at the Paris fair. One, ``A City Park'' (1887), showing a
fashionable woman with her dog, seated on a bench along a wide path
in Tompkins Park (previously identified as Central or Prospect
Park), looks particularly French in its bright atmosphere, strong
compositional perspective and seeming spontaneity of observation.
Chase's focus on isolated women in public spaces, suggests Gallati,
was his way of defining the spaces in terms of feminine refinement.
</P>
<P>
   Possibly for the same reason, ``Afternoon in the Park'' (circa
1887), an elegant pastel of his wife, Alice, in a salmon pink gown
and straw hat with red trim, is set amid sunlit greenery in the
park of the Brooklyn Navy Yard. The spot was near the Naval Lyceum,
a museum and library founded in 1833 by naval and marine officers
but no longer in existence.
</P>
<P>
   An earlier transitional painting of Chase, a lovely small oil of
1886, shows her sitting pensively in a rowboat, presumably on the
lake in Prospect Park. Its tight cropping and thin, form-modeling
passages of paint show Chase's effort to move away from the
turgidity of the Munich style.
</P>
<P>
   After moving to Manhattan in late 1887 or early 1888, Chase
began to paint in Central Park, producing peaceful scenes like
``The Lake for Miniature Yachts'' (1888), formally known as
``Conservatory Water.'' Combining landscape with figures, unusual
for that time, it shows a broad expanse of path with children
attending toy boats. A flotilla bobs on the shimmering water, with
a middle-distance landscape of greenery as background.
</P>
<P>
   Its avant-garde compositional strategies, cued by European
construction of pictorial space, show Chase's efforts to be modern.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Bit of the Terrace'' (circa 1890), focuses on one of Chase's
favorite Central Park locales, the Bethesda Fountain Terrace, here
portrayed as a peaceful setting for women and children.
</P>
<P>
   In the foreground a decorous infant, dressed head-to-toe in
white, plays with a red ball while its mother strolls nearby.
</P>
<P>
   This bland scene contrasts with the usual depictions of more
strenuous park activities in illustrated magazines and newspapers:
games, concerts, carriage driving, skating. Chase, according to
Gallati, wanted to support the idea of the park as a source of
spiritual elevation and refinement, the view held by its designers,
Frederic Law Olmsted and Calvert Vaux.
</P>
<P>
   Chase's urban landscapes ended with his move to the Shinnecock
Hills on Long Island's East End after the summer of 1890, where he
headed a highly successful summer art school devoted to plein-air
painting. As a sort of finale, a wonderful Shinnecock beachscape is
included in the show: ``Wind Swept Sands, Shinnecock, Long Island''
(circa 1894), an austere, lonely portrayal of dunes on a gray day.
</P>
<P>
   Informed by the more expansive view of landscape he had acquired
in painting his park scenes, Chase's Shinnecock paintings serve as
aesthetic ancestors to many a view of eastern Long Island by his
20th-century successors.

THE STICKY ROAD TO A KILLER APP

<P>
   Two years ago content was going to be king on the Internet. Last
year it was all about selling to consumers. This year, especially
as the Internet retail stocks plunge, it's e-business _
company-to-company commerce. If you want to keep up with something
moving this fast, you need to know how to talk the talk of the new
world.
</P>
<P>
   First, do not speak of markets or sectors. Say ``space,'' as in,
``They're in some of my space'' or ``We want to dominate that
space.''
</P>
<P>
   But don't think of space as a vacuum. It is filled with
verticals. These are something like industry sectors. What you must
do with a vertical is ``drill down'' into it until you hit paydirt,
famously called a killer app _ a lucrative niche to mine.
</P>
<P>
   The phrases B2C, as in business to consumer, and B2B, for
business to business, must roll off the tongue as easily as ``good
morning'' and ``good night.'' B2B drives down costs by
disintermediating _ cutting out middle steps and companies from the
business chain. It's great unless you are the one being
disintermediated. For future positioning, it would be wise, as
well, to begin practicing D2D, as in device-to-device, and
m-commerce, for mobile commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``Business model'' should be mentioned a lot, mainly because no
one really knows which Internet business models will work. And
because another big question, reflected in the Nasdaq's troubles,
is how one can actually make money from the Internet, it's good to
mention ``revenue models'' frequently.
</P>
<P>
   Even if your models are shaky, you know what you want to
attract: eyeballs. And what you want from those eyeballs is
stickiness _ that is, repeat business, people coming back to your
site again and again. That means what you are really seeking are
``sticky eyeballs.''
</P>
<P>
   You already know, of course, about the new economy and the old
economy. But be sure to use the terms in the preferable way _ not
as nouns, but as modifiers, as in new-economy valuation or
old-economy thinking. Space is new economy. Market is old economy.
Got it?
</P>
<P>
   Legacy, with all its warm old associations of something
gratefully inherited, like money or values, has turned decidedly
negative. Now legacy is your existing business, with all its
commitments and incentives and organization, holding you back and
preventing you from moving in Internet time. The past is no longer
prologue; it's a drag.
</P>
<P>
   As for the future, the basic rule to remember, one whose
codification has been attributed to a number of people, is a
sobering one. ``If you don't cannibalize your business, someone
else will.'' Sticky eyeballs and all.

WHAT'S GOOD FOR CHINA IS GOOD FOR CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
   (New York Times OpEd for Friday, May 26, and thereafter.)  
 ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times
Syndicate is for use by OPED clients. Nonsubscribers can use this

 By GEORGE R. NETHERCUTT JR.    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Now that the House has granted permanent normal
trading privileges to China, it must decide whether it has the
courage of its convictions on another issue: lifting sanctions on
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   The vote on trade with China was the culmination of months of
debate weighing the merits of trading with China against thorny
issues like human rights, religious persecution and national
security. In the end, the House Republican leadership persuaded a
majority that trade with China actually helps the United States
resolve these other issues.
</P>
<P>
   Yet, the leadership is using significantly different arguments
to thwart legislation that would eliminate unilateral sanctions on
the sales of food and medicine elsewhere in the world.
</P>
<P>
   The current agriculture spending bill includes an amendment I
wrote that would lift all food and medicine sanctions on Cuba,
Iran, Libya, North Korea and Sudan. The United States stands alone
in prohibiting sales of the most basic humanitarian goods to these
countries, leading to $1 billion in lost economic activity in rural
America. Our farmers suffer from lost sales, but these sanctioned
countries freely purchase an estimated $7 billion of agricultural
commodities from our allies around the world.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, 220 members of Congress signed a letter to Speaker
Dennis Hastert, urging him to expedite the consideration of this
amendment. The letter noted that unilateral sanctions of food and
medicine do not work. Because sanctioned states can easily buy the
same supplies from our allies, American farmers are the only ones
punished; they are denied access to significant international
markets. Moreover, denying innocent civilians access to food and
medicine, if only in principle, is an abhorrent foreign policy
tool.
</P>
<P>
   The logic is straightforward: support American farmers and
American values by allowing the export of food and medicine to
currently sanctioned countries. The amendment merely allows
sanctioned states to buy food and medicine on a commercial basis,
nothing more. If a normal trading relationship with China is a home
run for America, then lifting these sanctions is the equivalent of
a grand slam.
</P>
<P>
   What, then, could be the problem? Despite the clear parallels
with arguments it made in favor of the China deal, the Republican
leadership is opposed to the amendment's inclusion of Cuba and
seems intent on blocking even the sale of food to the world's
smallest Communist regime.
</P>
<P>
   This week, Trent Lott, the Senate majority leader, defended the
position. ``It's very easy to see the distinction'' between trade
with China and Cuba, he said, adding: ``And if you all can't see
it, I don't know. Maybe you're just blind to it.''
</P>
<P>
   In reflecting on the arguments in the China debate, I don't see
the difference. Those who promoted normal trading relations with
China said that trade promotes democratization. Change in Communist
regimes is slow, but eventually democratic norms take hold.
Dialogue and engagement with the United States are central to this
transition, as is exposure to our processes. If this is true for
China, then why not for Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of China trade note that trade talks are not the
appropriate venue for resolving differences on human rights or
security. These issues can be pursued in parallel discussions. If
this is true for China, why not for Cuba?
</P>
<P>
   In his closing arguments in the China trade debate, Hastert
asked the House to weigh the significance of the Chinese market,
noting the intense interest of our global competitors. ``The
question is, who will be there when the door opens?'' he asked.
This week's vote demonstrates that America will be in China. Then
why not Cuba?

BUSH UNTIES THE SOCIAL COMPACT 
</HEADLINE>
   (New York Times OpEd for Friday, May 26, and thereafter.)  
 ATTENTION EDITORS: The following material from The New York Times

 By ALAN S. BLINDER    
 c.2000 New York Times    
<TEXT>
<P>
   George W. Bush is advocating radical change in Social Security,
which he himself calls ``the single most successful government
program in American history.'' He would take a part of the payroll
tax that now flows to the Social Security trust fund and divert it
to personal savings accounts.
</P>
<P>
   This plan would seriously undermine the finances of the present
Social Security system. It would subject Americans, especially
financially unsophisticated ones, to large additional risks. And it
would abandon the noble commitment to social insurance that this
country made in 1935.
</P>
<P>
   While Social Security is a great success, its current large
surplus masks a serious long-term financing problem. Simply put, we
have promised far more in future benefits than future payroll tax
receipts are likely to finance _ about 14 percent more on average
over the next 75 years, according to the Social Security trustees'
estimates. This is a huge hole that must be filled by some
combination of raising payroll taxes, cutting benefits and infusing
general revenue into the trust fund.
</P>
<P>
   With the system in need of more revenue, not less, diverting
part of the payroll tax into private accounts, as Bush proposes,
appears irresponsible, unless, of course, you make up the
difference by cutting benefits. Without such cuts, privatization
would dig the financing hole even deeper, which is why thoughtful
privatization proposals generally include significant tax increases
to make good on promises that have already been made.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush has not proposed any. This is no minor omission.
Diverting 2 percentage points of the payroll tax into individual
accounts would drain trillions of dollars from Social Security over
the next quarter-century. And that's just the beginning. The Bush
plan would not only imperil Social Security's finances, but would
add new elements of cost and risk to the retirement security of
millions of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Privatization is superficially attractive for two main reasons:
the higher returns that can presumably be earned, say, in the stock
market, and the virtues of individual choice.
</P>
<P>
   That's all well and good for financially sophisticated
Americans, who happen (by no coincidence) also to enjoy every other
advantage in our society, and who, by the way, do not rely heavily
on Social Security for their retirement income. But what about the
less fortunate citizens, the ones who will need to live on their
Social Security checks but who may not know the difference between
a stock and a bond?
</P>
<P>
   Is freedom of choice such a blessing for them? Will they
understand the risks to which they may be exposed? When funds are
invested in stocks and held to retirement, the accumulated balance
at retirement is as volatile as the stock market, which not so
infrequently moves up or down by 50 percent or more within a few
years.
</P>
<P>
   It is a cruel illusion to pretend that small individual accounts
will enjoy the full returns that people see in the stock market.
There are commissions and, even more important, management fees
that can easily exceed 1 percent of assets per year. Then, when
they retire, people will discover that buying an individual (as
opposed to a group) annuity eats up another chunk of the money,
whereas Social Security offers annuities automatically and at zero
cost. Furthermore, Social Security's annuities are protected from
inflation, whereas private ones are not.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, let's remember the central idea behind the Social
Security system: to provide social insurance. Both words matter.
High-wage earners like me would undoubtedly be better off under the
Bush proposal, and even better off under full privatization. After
all, universal social insurance forces us to remain in the same
pool with, and partially subsidize, those who are less fortunate.
Social Security's benefit formula offers a better rate of return to
lower-wage individuals.
</P>
<P>
   From a self-interested point of view, that's a bad deal for us
high-income people. Were Vanguard or Fidelity to offer me a mutual
fund like that, I wouldn't buy any. But people like me cannot opt
out of Social Security, and frankly, I don't want to. Universal
social insurance is one of those precious ties that bind our
society together. Privatization, whether partial or total, would
weaken that tie.

titillating young women and knightly men in pastoral landscapes
that melded medieval towers with New England forests, Western
gorges and the deep blue skies of fairy kingdoms.

<P>
   The show here, ``Maxfield Parrish: 1870-1966,'' organized by the
Pennsylvania Academy of the Fine Arts and the American Federation
of Arts, presents more than 140 paintings, drawings, prints,
photographs, illustrations and ephemera by this deep-dyed fabulist,
the son of an upper-caste Philadelphia Quaker family.
</P>
<P>
   Reproductions of his paintings sold like hotcakes to a mass
market audience, and he also made a more than respectable living as
an advertising and magazine illustrator.
</P>
<P>
   As an illustrator, he could be considered the father of Norman
Rockwell, although his powers of invention were greater. His gift
for design is evident in modernistic creations like ``School Days
(Alphabet),'' a 1908 cover design for Collier's magazine. In it a
riotous swarm of alphabet letters stream from the pages of a
child's open textbook, burying him as he attempts to learn his
ABCs.
</P>
<P>
   An exacting draftsman as well as a clever colorist, Parrish
accomplished his impeccable oil paintings by the painstaking
application of many thin layers of transparent glazes over bases of
monochrome ink or paint.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the more familiar Parrish chestnuts are on view here,
like ``Daybreak'' (1922), the first painting he created
specifically for reproduction as an art print. A beautiful young
maiden, robed, lies on a marble-columned porch as a luminous dawn
breaks over a majestic mountain range. A young goddess, naked,
presumably Dawn, leans over the maiden to witness her ecstatic
awakening. To sexual ripening? Whatever, it has been estimated that
by 1925 this essay in veiled eroticism could be found on the walls
of one out of every four American households.
</P>
<P>
   In quite a different vein is the mural ``Old King Cole'' (1894),
a large triptych originally done for the University of
Pennsylvania's Mask and Wig Club in Philadelphia. A coy, cartoony
rendition of the nursery rhyme, it shows the merry king on his
throne, serenaded by his fiddlers three and attendants bearing pipe
and bowl. (In 1905 Parrish reworked the King Cole theme into a
mural for the old Knickerbocker Hotel on Times Square; in 1935 it
was transferred to the St. Regis Hotel in Manhattan, where it
remains on view today in the King Cole Bar.)
</P>
<P>
   Parrish never regarded himself as more than a popular artist
(``My skies were too blue,'' he told me in an interview shortly
before his death), but the revival of ``high art'' interest in his
work that began with the advent of Pop Art continues.
</P>
<P>
   There is enough in this show _ particularly his graphic art and
some fine landscapes _ to sustain that interest.

<P>
   Michael Levine wanted what many people would in a new house, a
safe neighborhood and low upkeep. But what really sold him on
Centennial, a 900-home development north of Indianapolis, was the
wiring _ a ready-to-use, high-speed Internet connection as well as
cable and phone service, all provided by the builder.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet service is ``so much faster than anything I've ever
seen,'' said Levine, a retired surgeon who moved in with his family
in March. Since Internet access no longer requires a phone line and
can go to more than one computer, ``nobody complains, `Gee, I can't
get online,''' he said. ``While one kid is doing research, the
other one is talking to her friend.''
</P>
<P>
   For a growing number of home buyers, high-speed Internet
connections are becoming as important as a two-car garage,
fireplace or new kitchen, prompting some developers and builders to
jump into the telecommunications business. Either by building and
owning neighborhood networks, or joining with telecom companies,
they are offering Internet access, bundled with cable and phone
service, at up to $20 a month below the typical cost. Instead of
different bills, people might pay one fee _ perhaps $50 for
Internet and cable _ through a homeowners' association.
</P>
<P>
   Their efforts are in the early stages. Most wired developments
have sprouted just in the last year. How developers eventually do
against the abundance of regional phone companies, cable companies
and other providers is anyone's guess.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we began to see during the last couple of years is a huge
explosion in demand'' for these connections, said Glen Barnard, who
runs the e-commerce business at Kaufman &AMP; Broad Home, a Los Angeles
builder.
</P>
<P>
   Builders also see a way to have continuing revenue from these
services _ perhaps 10 percent of the total fees _ and this steady
income would be most welcome in a business that has its ups and
downs. ``Wherever possible,'' Barnard said, ``we want to have an
ownership interest in the infrastructure we're putting in.''
</P>
<P>
   High-speed, or ``broadband,'' access has been slow to reach many
homes, even in centrally located or wealthy neighborhoods,
frustrating consumers used to speedy connections at work. One type
of service, a digital subscriber line, is often not available to
homes more than three miles from a phone company switching station.
Even then, some homeowners have faced delays in getting hooked up.
The other popular method, cable-modem service, has its own
problems, including slowdowns at peak times.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few million American households have either service, even
though analysts estimate that about 40 percent of the population
uses the Internet. According to Jo Chapman, director of surveys at
the National Association of Home Builders, only 5 percent of new
homes come with ``structured'' wiring, the fatter in-home pipe
needed to get the most from broadband service. But that should grow
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
   Broadband is already a must for some home buyers. Moving from
Redmond, Wash., recently, Ed and Judy Bott looked at 40
developments in Arizona before settling on DC Ranch, a new wired
community in Scottsdale. The development has it all _ including
structured wiring in every home _ and is served by US West. ``Not
having high-speed access would have been a deal-breaker,'' said
Bott, an author and magazine editor who telecommutes.
</P>
<P>
   The Botts know firsthand how difficult it can be getting the
right set-up: Their old home in Washington was supposed to have
structured wiring, but the job was done poorly, they say, causing
an expensive retrofit. ``We went through a painstaking process,''
said Bott, a public relations director for a Scottsdale technology
company.
</P>
<P>
   At Toll Brothers, a luxury builder in Huntingdon Valley, Pa.,
executives have set up their own subsidiary to build and own
broadband networks within Toll developments. Other builders, like
Kaufman &AMP; Broad, are weighing revenue-sharing arrangements with
companies that will wire new communities, similar to deals already
struck by owners of some office buildings and high-end apartments.
Some big service providers, like SBC Communications, US West, and
Cox Communications, are seeking large builders and developers to
wire planned communities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody is working down the same path,'' said Richard
Beckwitt, general partner of Encore Venture Partners, a fund whose
major investors include a Texas builder, D.R. Horton. Encore is
searching out Internet-related businesses that dovetail with
homebuilding, including broadband delivery. ``We're trying to get
some ownership of the stream of revenue that passes through the
Internet, the cable, the telephone lines after the house closes,''
Beckwitt said.
</P>
<P>
   Some builders are taking a slower tack, unsure of how well all
this will fare against established telecom companies. To keep
buyers from sticking with old-line providers, some developers are
including their brand of service in neighborhood association fees.
</P>
<P>
   One risk is that the capital spending required could be lost if
newer technologies proliferate. ``The question for us is whether
what is cutting-edge today will still be leading-edge tomorrow,''
said Jim Zeumer, director of investor relations for Pulte Corp., a
builder in Bloomfield Hills, Mich. ``You can spend a lot of money
laying whatever kind of pipe, then tomorrow, somebody has solved
wireless, and all of a sudden you've got a whole new ball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pulte is already testing some new ideas in Arizona. ``We
are looking at other business structures we could roll out on a
more nationwide basis,'' he said.

   Centex Corp., a Dallas builder that has been a leader in
diversifying into areas like lawn care and home security, is
proceeding cautiously. But Randy Luther, a vice president at its
Centex Homes unit, said signs point to broadband becoming a much
more important feature, especially as the first generation to grow
up with computers starts buying homes. Many houses not built with
structured wiring _ a feature Centex is pushing _ will be at a
disadvantage in the resale market in five years, he said. ``It's
not a question of if it's going happen. It's a question of when.''
</P>
<P>
   For a lot of homebuilders, ``How they do it is still very much
up in the air,'' adds John Stanley, an analyst at UBS Warburg.
``It's probably a few years down the road before it means anything
to the bottom line.'' But for most big builders, ``They've come to
the conclusion they're leaving some money on the table'' if they do
nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The opportunity exists because developers own the land that
carries the wiring from homes to the outside world. This is
especially true in developments in outlying suburbs and planned
communities, where developers own the easements, providing a
barrier to entry against cable, telephone and other rivals.
</P>
<P>
   The importance of this ``last mile'' or ``first mile'' in
existing neighborhoods has helped drive some big mergers, like
AT&AMP;T's acquisition of Tele-Communications and Mediaone, and America
Online's deal for Time Warner. Existing providers of telephone and
cable service, meanwhile, plan to spend billions of dollars getting
old-fashioned lines and wires in shape for high-speed service. Huge
investments have been made in technologies bypassing the last mile,
like satellite dishes and fixed wireless.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developers have realized the first mile of real estate, which
we previously gave away, is perhaps the most valuable real estate
in the country,'' said Paul Estridge Jr., president of Estridge
Companies, which built Centennial outside Indianapolis. Estridge
has formed a company, First Mile Technologies, to wire new
developments. First Mile hopes to expand by cutting deals with
other developers, offering them up to 10 percent of the revenue
from services it sells their home buyers. Estridge estimates that
for homeowners, the service could be 15 percent or more cheaper;
for now, Centennial residents get it free while the company sorts
out pricing.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the only glitch is that residents have had phone calls
routed through a cellular network, though Centennial says they will
be linked up with a regular network in few weeks.
</P>
<P>
   At Toll Brothers, executives recently announced a new unit,
Advanced Broadband, which is wiring two new developments in Florida
and one in Virginia. But Toll plans to expand that business and
also to join forces with other builders and developers, said
Michael Zammit, managing director for telecommunications at Toll.
He expects the new Toll unit to help cash flow by 2002. ``Clearly
it's a direction we see ultimately taking the company,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Another start-up, Dynamic Telecom Engineering, of Cleveland, has
signed revenue-sharing deals with several builders, including
Beazer Homes USA and Kaufman &AMP; Broad. Dynamic Telecom will wire new
developments and pay the builders 10 percent of its revenue, with
some builders also getting an equity stake, said the president, Eli
Asher.
</P>
<P>
   Some big phone and cable companies are also seeking out deals
with developers. In addition to DC Ranch, US West, the Denver-based
phone company, has similar arrangements planned or underway with at
least a dozen other big developments, said Vickey Callen, vice
president and general manager of the broadband services unit.
</P>
<P>
   Two months ago, Newhall Land and Farming, a large developer
outside Los Angeles, said it had cut a deal to have SBC's Pacific
Bell unit provide video, broadband and phone service to every new
home in Newhall's Valencia and Newhall Ranch communities. Robin
MacGillivray, a Pacific Bell executive, said some such agreements
call for revenue sharing with the developer, depending on what
state regulations permit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developers are realizing that they need to offer their
customers more than just news, weather and sports,'' she said.

 &HT;    Get grill, patio furniture ready for summer
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio -
</P>
<P>
   PREPARING THE GRILL
</P>
<P>
   If you have a gas grill, start by gathering materials to clean
it: grease-cutting dish soap or other mild detergent, a
vinyl-bristle brush, a soft cloth, toothpicks or pipe cleaners,
sandpaper, a nonmetal bottle brush, aluminum foil and your owner's
manual.
</P>
<P>
   Following the instructions in your owner's manual, disconnect
the hollow burner tubes through which the gas flows and use the
bottle brush to thoroughly clean the insides of the tubes. Grease
blobs and spider webs can clog the small gas ports in the burner
tubes. Clean them carefully with
</P>
<P>
   toothpicks.
</P>
<P>
   Before replacing the burner tubes, clean the inside and outside
of the grill housing with the vinyl brush. Use aluminum foil to
keep water from getting inside gas orifices.
</P>
<P>
   Areas with chipped paint must be sanded, primed and repainted
with heat-resistant paint. Paint only while the grill is cold and
allow time for the paint to dry before turning on the grill.
</P>
<P>
   Check your gas line, line connections and propane tank before
restarting the grill. You can check the lines and connections by
turning on the gas and brushing the connections with soapy water.
Bubbles will form at the site of any leaks. Sometimes tightening a
connection will stop a leak, but you might have to replace a hose
or an O-ring.
</P>
<P>
   Although propane tanks will last as long as the grill, dented or
badly rusted tanks must be replaced immediately. Minor tank
corrosion can be fixed the same way chipped paint on the housing is
fixed.
</P>
<P>
   When you're sure the grill is ready to turn on, burn some of the
grease off the briquettes and cooking grids. Flip the briquettes so
the greasy side faces the burner and return the cooking grids to
their usual positions. Light the grill, close the lid and set the
flame on high for 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   After the grill cools, remove the grids and briquettes and scrub
off any remaining grease with a vinyl brush and soapy water. Rinse,
towel dry and put them back in place.
</P>
<P>
   During the cooking season, flipping the briquettes over after
every use will help keep down the accumulation of grease.
</P>
<P>
   Charcoal grills require little maintenance, but check your
owner's manual to be sure you're using and maintaining the grill
correctly.
</P>
<P>
   Before each use, clean the grate with a specially designed grill
brush or a piece of crumpled aluminum foil. Wipe with paper towels.
</P>
<P>
   Badly rusted grates should be replaced, if you can find
replacements. But charcoal grills are inexpensive enough that you
might just want to replace the whole grill when the grates or the
body of the grill start going bad.
</P>
<P>
   TRY PAINTING METAL FURNITURE
</P>
<P>
   The paint on metal patio furniture protects it from rust. When
the paint wears out, deterioration begins.
</P>
<P>
   If the old paint surface of your metal furniture is still sound
but you want to change the color, clean the furniture item
thoroughly before painting. Wash it down with a mild detergent such
as dishwashing liquid and allow it to dry thoroughly.
</P>
<P>
   If you paint with a small brush you'll pay less than for the
same amount of paint in aerosol cans, and there's less waste
involved. But most do-it-yourselfers find aerosol-can painting more
convenient, especially for reaching nooks and crannies.
</P>
<P>
   Whether painting with aerosol cans or with a brush, lay out
tarps to catch stray paint. Avoid painting on a windy day or in
direct sunlight. If you wait for temperatures at least in the 50s
and humidity below 85 percent, your paint will dry faster.
</P>
<P>
   Follow the application instructions on the paint can, including
shaking the aerosol can as long as recommended. Remember that some
special-effects paints, such as stone-texture paints, require less
shaking than other types.
</P>
<P>
   For spray painting, hold the can upright about 12 inches from
the surface and sweep smoothly back and forth, overlapping the
edges of areas you've painted. Practicing on a piece of scrap metal
or wood before starting on the furniture will increase your
confidence.
</P>
<P>
   Adding a second coat after waiting 10 to 15 minutes for the
first coat to dry gives a deeper, smoother finish.
</P>
<P>
   Rusted furniture must be scraped with a wire brush to remove the
rust before painting. After scraping, smooth the area with fine
sandpaper or steel wool. Rub the sanded spots with a tack cloth to
remove any sanding residue.
</P>
<P>
   Add a coat of primer designed for metal before painting the
final color. The primer will help prevent new rust and will provide
a better surface for the new paint to grab.
</P>
<P>
   Most hard, solid plastics can be painted, but many plastic
surfaces will shed paint quickly if they're not properly prepared.
</P>
<P>
   If you're unsure of the paintability of a particular kind of
plastic, experiment with an inconspicuous spot on a piece you could
live without if it was damaged.
</P>
<P>
   Use sandpaper to scuff the surface to be painted. Remove any
dust with a tack cloth and add a coat of primer. Let the primer dry
and paint according to the instructions on the paint can.
</P>
<P>
   If the paint holds well in the experimental area, paint the rest
of the piece following the same steps: sand, clean, prime, dry and
paint.
</P>
<P>
   Bare wood that has never been painted also should be sanded and
primed before painting. The primer seals the surface of the wood
and covers surface defects that would show through the paint.
</P>
<P>
   Wood that has been previously painted should be rubbed down with
medium-grade sandpaper to remove the surface gloss of the old
paint. Wipe it down with a tack cloth, clean it with a mild
detergent and let it dry.
</P>
<P>
   Porous ceramic, as in unglazed flower pots, should be primed
before it is painted. Nonporous ceramic should be scuffed with
sandpaper to remove its surface gloss.

ANALYSIS: BUSH BREAKS NEW GROUND WITH PROPOSAL FOR MISSILE DEFENSE
SYSTEM 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Gov. George W. Bush's proposal this week to
consider unilateral reductions in the American nuclear arsenal was
a break with decades of strategic doctrine, a break that may
foretell the end of traditional theories of arms control.
</P>
<P>
   In Bush's vision, still lacking in many details, the threat of
global annihilation _ known in arms control theory as mutual
assured destruction _ would no longer govern relations between the
United States and other nuclear powers. The size of the American
nuclear arsenal would no longer depend on the number of warheads
Russia possesses, nor be set in lengthy and painstaking arms
control negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   And the defensive shield against nuclear weapons that he
proposes to build _ significantly larger than that envisioned by
the Clinton administration _ would be shared with American allies
and, perhaps one day, with Russia or even China.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these ideas have been percolating among a bipartisan
body of experts in the arms control community for years.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was President Ronald Reagan, who trumpeted the idea
of slashing offensive nuclear weapons and relying instead on a a
defensive shield that would render nuclear missiles obsolete. And
at Reykjavik in 1986, Reagan also agreed with Mikhail Gorbachev,
the former Soviet leader, to the principle of eliminating all of
their nuclear weapons, before he was pulled back by his advisers.
</P>
<P>
   But 15 years later, arms control is suddenly back at center
stage in a presidential campaign that was expected to focus on
domestic policy. And some of those same men who pushed Ronald
Reagan away from his radical views on arms control are now advising
Bush, the presumptive Republican nominee, as he gives new voice to
the idea of large cuts in offensive weapons coupled with
construction of missile defenses, and places it squarely on the
current political agenda.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton will push his own arms control agenda in
Moscow in 10 days when he meets with the Russian president,
Vladimir Putin, to discuss further cuts in long-range warheads. The
administration is offering to make some of the cuts if Moscow
accepts changes in a 1972 treaty, to allow the fielding of a
limited missile defense system.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his advisers argue that it is long past time for a
radical reassessment of nuclear theory. The idea of holding
populations hostage to annihilation is worse than immoral, they
say, it is irrelevant. They complain that Clinton has wasted much
of the decade since the end of the Cold War by clinging to the Cold
War orthodoxy of using the specter of massive retaliation to deter
any nuclear power from contemplating a first strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's way past time for some fresh thinking about the structure
of military capability in light of the kind of world we now live
in,'' said George P. Shultz, the secretary of state in the Reagan
administration and one of Bush's foreign policy advisers. ``That
really hasn't been done.''
</P>
<P>
   Shultz, who was a well-known skeptic on Reagan's vision of a
space-based umbrella to shield America from incoming missiles, said
that his thinking has evolved on missile defenses because of the
rapid advance of technology. He said that Bush knows that current
technology cannot produce an impermeable nuclear shield any time
soon. But, he added, ``it's not too much to say there is a
reasonable prospect to interpose a thin layer of defense out
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Barry Blechman, a nuclear analyst at the Henry L. Stimson Center
in Washington and a Democrat, called this sort of talk ``a
breakthrough in Republican thinking.'
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush is talking about going down to numbers that are lower
than the military is currently willing to go,'' Blechman said.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, Bush is discussing the possibility of making such
reductions unilaterally, rather than in a process of years-long
negotiations with Russia or China over accuracy, throw-weights,
basing modes, build-downs and timetables.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said that he envisions a sweeping review of American
strategic needs by the Pentagon that will help establish the
optimal size of the nuclear force. He will then challenge Russia to
match American reductions in weaponry. His chief foreign policy
adviser, Condoleezza Rice, calls these ``reciprocal unilateral
measures'' and describes them as a simpler and less time-consuming
way to do arms control than the interminable talks that have
dominated arms control efforts with Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   Or, as another Bush adviser put it: ``The governor said he was
going to figure out what we need, reduce to that level and
encourage the Russians to do the same. We're not going to build
stuff we don't need just because Russians have stuff they don't
need.''
</P>
<P>
   But that was precisely the calculation that governed the arms
race of the second half of the 20th century: The superpowers kept
building up their stockpiles to match the other, far beyond the
needs of deterrence or any possible military requirement.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore had hoped that such questions would not
become central to the presidential campaign this year. He and other
administration officials believed they had neutralized much of the
Republican fervor for a robust missile shield by moving toward a
decision this year on a limited system of land-based national
missile defense.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   But Bush portrayed the administration approach as timid on two
fronts. He proposed a broader missile shield to appeal to
conservatives and deeper weapons cuts than the Clinton
administration has been willing to entertain.
</P>
<P>
   Since the days of the missile gap and duck-and-cover drills,
four things have changed the nuclear equation in fundamental ways.
The Soviet Union fell apart. Advances in technology have held out
the promise of missile defenses that may be at least partially
effective. Years of arms control agreements have reduced the
numbers of nuclear weapons by thousands with no apparent impact on
the relative security of the United States and Russia. And a
handful of smaller nations, among them North Korea and Iraq, have
made strides toward developing nuclear weapons of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Bush and his advisers argued this week that U.S. doctrine has
not kept pace with any of these developments.
</P>
<P>
   ``While deterrence remains the first line of defense against
nuclear attack, the standoff of the Cold War was born of a
different time,'' Bush said in a speech at the National Press Club
on Tuesday. ``Yet almost a decade after the end of the Cold War,
our nuclear policy still resides in that already distant past.''
</P>
<P>
   He proposed a series of measures that would alter that policy,
including building a defensive system that would cover all 50
states and could be extended to protect allies in Europe, the
Middle East and Asia. In addition to holding out the possibility of
large unilateral cuts in nuclear arms, he said that most American
nuclear weapons should be removed from hair-trigger alert status.
He offered reassurance to Moscow and Beijing that the American
system of missile defense, although it would almost surely entail
abrogating the Anti-ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972, was not aimed
at neutralizing their arsenals of long-range weapons.
</P>
<P>
   That is an argument that has so far been rejected by those two
countries, especially by China, whose relatively small nuclear
force could be rendered irrelevant by even the limited anti-missile
system favored by Clinton. Both countries argue that the old system
of deterrence that Bush derides as outdated is still the most
reliable method of keeping the nuclear peace. Chinese officials
have said they might have to accelerate their own nuclear program
if the Americans build an anti-missile shield.
</P>
<P>
   Gore quickly issued a statement rejecting Bush's ideas as risky
and irresponsible. He said that Bush wanted to resurrect the
discredited Star Wars program of the Reagan era and flaunt American
military superiority over Russia, China and every other nation. And
he chastised Bush for opposing the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty,
which was defeated in the Senate last fall on a largely party-line
vote.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's response drew a rebuke from Bush's advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Brent Scowcroft, the national security adviser to President
George Bush and a retired Air Force general, said that construction
of missile defenses should not be seen as a threat to the nuclear
forces of Russia and China nor as an incentive for them to beef up
their arsenals to overwhelm American defenses.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow has sufficient political and financial reasons for
continuing to draw down its nuclear stockpile, he said, while
Beijing is likely to continue its nuclear buildup regardless of
what the United States does because it faces growing threats in its
own region.
</P>
<P>
   ``This goes back to the cooperative concept,'' he said. ``We
tell both of them, `North Korea is a problem for us; it's a problem
for you, too. How can you help us, by changing the threat or
helping us deal with it?'''
</P>
<P>
   In a floor statement delivered on Thursday, Sen. Joseph R. Biden
Jr., the senior Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee,
praised Bush's ideas _ up to a point. He applauded his intention to
undertake a thorough review of America's nuclear posture and
endorsed his plan to take weapons off high-alert status. He agreed
that the size of the American nuclear arsenal could safely be
reduced far below current levels.
</P>
<P>
   But Biden also said that Bush held an unrealistic view of the
feasibility and cost of missile defenses and said that a radical
revision of decades of deterrence would be unnerving to allies and
adversaries alike.
</P>
<P>
   The senator urged Bush and Gore to remove the question of
missile defenses from the current political debate and allow the
next president to study the matter outside of the electoral arena.
</P>
<P>
   ``The longest-lasting foreign policy debate is not likely to be
settled any time soon,'' Biden said.

 &HT;    Witness: Defense used intimidation
 &HT;    By Mike Fish
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ When he eased his taxi up onto the Buckhead murder
scene in the early hours of Jan. 31, Patrick Ozonu unwittingly
became a witness in the murder trial of NFL star linebacker Ray
Lewis and two co-defendants.
</P>
<P>
   The magnitude of events didn't hit, Ozonu says, until he spurned
interview requests from the Lewis defense team and found himself
subjected to ``intimidation tactics'' by their hired investigators.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, defense attorneys and witnesses friendly to Lewis
have continuously alleged use of such heavy-handed tactics by the
prosecution and Atlanta police _ a complaint uttered again in court
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Ozonu, who could testify as early as today, says Lewis
investigators falsely accused him of being in possession of a
stolen cell phone, then suggested they could clear up the problem
if he'd meet with them. The Nigerian native also alleges receiving
a follow-up call from someone impersonating an Atlanta police
officer, which would be a felony.
</P>
<P>
   District Attorney Paul Howard said he has a copy of the tape
recording Ozonu made of the calls and plans to weigh filing charges
after the high-profile murder trial concludes.
</P>
<P>
   ``We take the allegations very seriously, and we intend to look
at them closely,'' Howard said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Garland, Lewis' attorney, downplayed the situation, saying it
was just a ``misunderstanding'' between his investigators and
Ozonu. He added that Ozonu has since visited his office.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators working for the Lewis defense team continue to
portray Ozonu as an ``insignificant'' witness, over-reacting to
what they describe as the routine practice of trying to determine
what a witness will testify to before trial. They also question
Ozonu's credibility, noting that he sought $300 when they attempted
to interview him. Ozonu says it was the cost of his time.
</P>
<P>
   Though it's unlikely he can identify any suspects, the
41-year-old cab driver has told police of pulling his empty white
minivan into the intersection and seeing at least six men pummeling
one man and another on the ground bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   To document the alleged tactics of two of the investigators
retained by Garland _ former Atlanta police officer Dale Hendrix
and Bill Siebert, both licensed by the Georgia Board of Private
Detectives and Security Agencies _ Ozonu began tape recording their
telephone calls to his apartment. He later played the tapes for the
Atlanta Journal-Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   During a March 15 call, Hendrix is heard telling Ozonu that it's
come to his attention that Ozonu is in possession of a stolen cell
phone _ reading back a number which isn't to a cell phone, but is
Ozonu's home phone.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to play hardball with me, I'll play hardball with you
as far as the cell phone,'' Hendrix warns. ``The cell phone might
concern the Atlanta Police Department. . . . Are you willing to
stay out of jail? If the information I have is correct, you're
going to be needing to stay out of jail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my information that you got a stolen cell phone. It's my
understanding the cell phone came from a crime scene.''
</P>
<P>
   When Ozonu expressed anger that his boss had been told the
allegation by Hendrix, the investigator handed the phone to
Siebert, who described himself as being with Bell South Mobility.
Siebert tells Ozonu that Atlanta police and the FBI confirmed the
phone was stolen, and offers to help Ozonu clear the matter.
</P>
<P>
   Siebert initially denied (to a reporter) talking with Ozonu.
Then, asked if he ever called on behalf of Bell South about a
stolen cell phone, said: ``I was running something down on a
possible (stolen) phone, and. . . I was (visiting) Bell South
Mobility security at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell South Mobility spokeswoman Julia Russo said of Siebert:
``We show no such person being associated with this company.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the conversation with Hendrix and Siebert, Ozonu
received a call from someone posing as an Atlanta police officer,
who identified himself as Detective Ryan and later as Detective Tom
Russell. Neither is employed by the department, said Atlanta police
spokesman John Quigley. The telephone number the caller left with
Ozonu rings to a local accountant's office.
</P>
<P>
   Both investigators deny any unethical behavior in their dealings
with Ozonu, or any knowledge of the person misrepresenting himself
as a police officer.
</P>
<P>
   Hendrix, an 18-year veteran of the Atlanta police force, retired
in 1998 after a federal jury acquitted him on charges that he
illegally received payments to provide security at an apartment
complex. He was represented by Don Samuel, a member of Lewis' legal
team. Hendrix is appealing revocation of his certification by the
Georgia Peace Officer Standards &AMP; Training Council.
</P>
<P>
   The tactics Hendrix and Siebert are accused of using in dealing
with Ozonu could put them at odds with regulations of the Georgia
Board of Detective &AMP; Security Agencies, empowered to bring
disciplinary action against licensees who commit dishonesty or
fraud.
</P>
<P>
   ``That doesn't project a good image for the private detective
industry when you have people not only misrepresenting themselves
as police officers but intimidating a witness,'' said Gene
Staulcup, board chairman. ``I understand they want to see what
(Ozonu) has to say, and they're representing their client to the
best of their ability _ but we all have to operate within the
confines of the law.''

 &HT;    Kruger vows to listen, learn
 &HT;    By Jeffrey Denberg
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Hawks general manager Pete Babcock and his new
coaching hire, Lon Kruger, sat on the dais, earnestly answering
questions. Twenty feet away, club president Stan Kasten stood
beaming the approval he has expressed about the new guy in town.
</P>
<P>
   Against the wall, wearing his Arizona warmups, young point guard
Jason Terry stood. He listened intently as Kruger spoke about his
aspirations in Atlanta and his reasons for coming. A few times
Terry nodded. Kruger responded to one question by saying he had a
lot to learn from his players. ``I'll learn from them more than
they'll learn from me.'' Later, he said, ``I'll listen to them more
than they'll listen to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in the audience at the Philips Arena practice gym winced,
because half the Hawks squad is 20 to 24.
</P>
<P>
   Terry raised his hand in a reassuring gesture.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's college-coach talk,'' said a player one year past his
four-year career under Lute Olson. ``They listen to you. Then they
tell you what to do, and then you go out and you do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruger also said he believed in hard work, the basis of his
philosophy after 18 years as a head coach at four colleges.
</P>
<P>
   Terry wanted to hear that. He and Alan Henderson have been in
the gym every day since the worst season in franchise history ended
last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``What I want is for him to let every player on this team know
that being in the gym on a daily basis is not only expected but
demanded,'' Terry said. ``It's not, `Well, it'd be nice if you can
come down,' but that you have to be here . . . . When we get that,
then I'll know we're moving forward as a team.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruger, 47, ``is the best basketball coach (available) we could
possibly hire for the long-term future of the franchise,'' Babcock
said after signing him to a five-year contract at $2 million a
year. Babcock listed among Kruger's strengths ``strong sense of
discipline, structure, aggressive defense, great character.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruger contradicted a report that he had turned down the Hawks
at one point in the negotiations. ``I never said no. I listened
until I said yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the appeal of the job was the young roster, he said. He
knows Jim Jackson, Roshown McLeod and Lorenzen Wright. He spoke on
the telephone Wednesday night with Dikembe Mutombo, and he met with
Terry and Henderson after their morning workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they want to work hard and get it done,'' the coach
said. ``Otherwise, I wouldn't want to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   Kruger went back to Champagne, Ill., Thursday to say goodbye to
his Illinois team. He will be back next week to begin assembling a
coaching staff.
</P>
<P>
   Terry said he would be waiting for him.

BEING NEIGHBORLY SOMETIMES ISN'T NEARLY ENOUGH 
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sun., May 28) 
 By VIVIAN MARINO    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The quaint little village of Antwerp, N.Y., seemed like an ideal
place for Stephen and Vici Diehl to escape the noise and nuisance
of city life and to indulge their passion for nature photography.
</P>
<P>
   What they found instead was a different type of noise and
nuisance.
</P>
<P>
   Several years after settling into their four-bedroom 1827 Greek
revival home on 1.5 acres 40 miles from the Canadian border, they
said, their rural serenity was shattered by a neighbor playing
amplified Christmas music on outdoor loudspeakers, blaring
intermittently every day during the holidays.
</P>
<P>
   The neighbor is the First Congregational Church of Antwerp, with
whom the couple has been bickering in and out of courtrooms for six
years. ``We just said, `Please turn down the volume,' but they just
didn't want anybody telling them what to do,'' said Diehl, 49.
</P>
<P>
   Disputes between neighbors about loud noise, offensive odors,
intrusive pets or wayward vegetation have been going on for
centuries, and the exchanges can become rather unneighborly. The
summer months, when people spend more time outdoors and new faces
are most likely to move in to neighborhoods, are the peak season
for disputes, legal experts say.
</P>
<P>
   When neighbor-to-neighbor arguments find their way to court,
they are generally based on two kinds of claims. One is
interference with what is called quiet enjoyment of one's property,
a common-law right with ancient roots; the Diehls' dispute with the
church is an example. The other common claim is of actual or
potential reduction of property values.
</P>
<P>
   While having a good neighbor probably won't raise the value of a
home, a bad one certainly can lower it, said Cora Jordan, a
Mississippi attorney and author of ``Neighbor Law: Fences, Trees,
Boundaries and Noise'' (Nolo.com, 1999). She noted that a
dilapidated house or grounds, a home-based business that draws
traffic or makes noise, or drastic changes made to one property in
a neighborhood can reduce what buyers are willing to pay for nearby
homes. ``If your property value is affected, you can sue,'' Jordan
said.
</P>
<P>
   There are no reliable national figures on neighbor-to-neighbor
legal disputes, but experts say the number is steadily growing, as
homeowners become more aggressive in defense of quality of life and
what is usually their largest investment by far, their homes. A
hint can be gleaned from figures on civil disputes handled through
state-sponsored mediation, a faster and cheaper alternative to a
formal trial. Of the 40,860 cases of all kinds referred to New
York's network of 62 mediation centers in fiscal 1999, a quarter
were neighbor-related disputes; divorces and other domestic
disputes, commercial disagreements and landlord-tenant quarrels
make up much of the rest.
</P>
<P>
   When neighbors go to war, noise is the No. 1 casus belli
everywhere. Among city apartment dwellers, parking and pets also
rank high, according to Debra Shime, program director for a
mediation center in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   Suburban Hatfields and McCoys commonly feud over boundary
encroachments (a new driveway or fence that creeps over the
property line), trees and bushes (which might block a neighbor's
view or sunlight), and eyesores.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think we're so modern with our cell phones and gadgets, but
people are having the same types of problems with their neighbors
as they did 300 years ago,'' said Mark Warda, a Florida attorney
and author of ``Neighbor vs. Neighbor,'' (Sphinx Publishing, 1999).
The book chronicles some bizarre quarrels, including a 1920s suit
over a honk of a car horn that allegedly set off a chicken riot in
which 720 birds perished. (The chicken farmer lost.)
</P>
<P>
   Neighbor-law experts say litigation ought to be the last resort.
The first step should be calmly approaching neighbors about a
problem, and if that fails, writing a letter. And Jordan suggests
researching local ordinances to see if a valid complaint exists
before involving local authorities or suing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is, people don't always know their neighbors,''
Warda said, ``so they may feel uncomfortable. Years ago, you could
go over to the neighbor and say, `Hey Joe, could you please get
your dog to stop barking while I take a nap?'''
</P>
<P>
   The Diehls, who said the church's holiday music drove them
indoors, kept them up nights and forced Diehl, 51, to take a leave
from his position as a photography professor at Rochester Institute
of Technology, tried to resolve the problem with the church
directly before suing, but without success.
</P>
<P>
   The church's lawyer, Henry Leader, said the church tried turning
the volume down and moving the loudspeakers, but nothing satisfied
the Diehls. ``Nobody else complained,'' he said. ``There was even a
petition by some of the other residents asking for the music to
continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally the dispute came before a federal judge, who ordered the
church to refrain from playing its amplified holiday music for two
years, a ruling that expires this winter. Leader said that though
the crux of the case was ``really freedom of speech,'' it is
unlikely the music will resume.
</P>
<P>
   The limits to constitutional rights become an issue in cases
like a recent one in Little Rock, Ark. Jennings Osborne, who owns
the Arkansas Research Medical Testing Center, used to put up a
dazzling display of 3 million Christmas lights on his main
residence and two adjacent lots. Neighbors sued to make him tone
down the display, arguing that traffic jams of onlookers from miles
around prevented them from enjoying their own property during the
holidays. He lost, and appealed on First Amendment and other
grounds all the way to the Supreme Court, which declined to hear
the case.
</P>
<P>
   But there is an epilogue: Walt Disney Co. officials offered to
buy Osborne's lights _ all 350 miles of them, along with 32.2 miles
of extension cords _ and they are now on display on the back lot at
the MGM Studios theme park near Disney World in central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   When a dispute revolves around enforcement of local ordinances,
codes and community rules, a third party such as a town board or
homeowners' association often becomes involved, and winds up in
court against one party or the other. An example is the long battle
between Nelson Peltz, the chairman and chief executive of the
Triarc Companies, and his neighbors in the wealthy Westchester town
of Bedford over his commuting habits.
</P>
<P>
   Peltz built a helipad on his 100-acre estate and began using it
occasionally to travel between his home and his office 40 miles
away in Manhattan. The noise of his helicopter irritated the actor
E.G. Marshall and other neighbors, who complained to the town
government that the flights violated zoning laws. The town sued
Peltz successfully to keep him from using the pad. He switched to
using an old airstrip elsewhere on the property, which he contends
is legal because the strip predates the town zoning law. The town
sued again, and the case is pending.
</P>
<P>
   Meantime, ``there are still complaints coming from neighbors
about late-night helicopter landings that are preventing some
people from sleeping,'' said Joel Sachs, the town's attorney. The
aggrieved neighbors, he said, see ``no reason why he can't hop in
his car and drive to the airport, five minutes away.''

 &HT;    When A.J. talks, Salazar listens
 &HT;    By Dave Lance
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Racing legend and team owner A.J. Foyt has yet to
advise Eliseo Salazar about his finances, what to eat or when to be
in bed.
</P>
<P>
   Off the track, Salazar can do what he wants. On it, he's all
ears, hanging on the four-time Indianapolis 500 winner's every
word.
</P>
<P>
   Foyt's advice is something like, ``Go fast,'' and Salazar has
been the obedient pupil. Racing in Foyt's G-Force/Oldsmobile last
Saturday at Indianapolis Motor Speedway, Salazar completed his
four-lap time trial in 223.231 mph, which put him in the front row
in the third position for Sunday's Indianapolis 500.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way (Foyt) said we were going to do it; peak on
Saturday,'' Salazar said. ``He's won this thing four times. I'll do
whatever he says.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went out and did what he said and we got (third). So what
can I say?''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar also started Indy on the outside in row one in 1996, but
hopes this time he has better success in the race. Citing nerves,
Salazar crashed into Arie Luyendyk leaving the pits on lap 98.
</P>
<P>
   That was before Salazar, a 44-year-old native of Santiago,
Chile, hooked up with Foyt. He joined Foyt's racing team this
season and has seen immediate dividends with two top five finishes
in Indy Racing League events.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the experience from A.J., I'm much more relaxed,''
Salazar said. ``We can't wait for Race Day.''
</P>
<P>
   A friendship has formed between the two, but not so much that
Foyt has taken up Salazar's native language, Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can say chile con queso,'' Salazar said, ``but that's about
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Foyt was probably saying something unprintable during Salazar's
last lap of qualifying. Salazar averaged 223.410 his first three
laps, but said he lost concentration and made it around the track
in 222.695 on the last.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like he said, he looked at the (darn) computer and he had run
a 223.7,'' Foyt said. ``All of a sudden he got in the corner and he
lost concentration. Then he had to get out the best he could.''
</P>
<P>
   He did, and put himself in a position other drivers would envy.
Too bad for Salazar no one seems to notice. The line for Salazar's
autograph is always a short one. His comments concerning
19-year-old phenom Sarah Fisher didn't help endear him to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   After the two crashed last month in Las Vegas, Salazar said,
while leaving the infield care center, ``This is serious stuff.
This is not for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar has since apologized, but the damage was already done:
He had insulted a fan favorite who has raced since she was 5.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar apologized last week and congratulated Fisher on
qualifying for Indy.
</P>
<P>
   ``At 19 years old, I was racing small cars in Chile,'' Salazar
said. ``And here she is at the Indy 500. I said things I regret,
but I feel like I helped her a lot because look at all the
publicity she's received.''
</P>
<P>
   Salazar hopes he gets all the press on race day, as winner of
the Indy 500.

EPA ORDERS ASBESTOS CLEANUP IN MONTANA  

</HEADLINE>
   c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ The federal Environmental Protection Agency has ordered
W.R. Grace &AMP; Co. to clean up the site of mining operations the
company once owned in Libby, Mont., where tests found dangerous
levels of asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   Grace mined vermiculite for 27 years in the Libby area, and the
operations sent tons of asbestos dust into the air. For years, area
residents have blamed the asbestos for illnesses and deaths.
</P>
<P>
   The EPA began testing in the area last year after a series of
newspaper articles focused new attention on the unusual mortality
rate of former mine workers and members of their families.
</P>
<P>
   Under an agreement with the EPA, Grace will clean a site once
used as a products transportation center in Libby. Also, agency
officials said the federal government would clean another Grace
mining site just outside of Libby and seek reimbursement from the
company afterward.
</P>
<P>
   EPA officials said they expected the cleaning of both sites to
be completed this summer.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Perhaps you considered buying a New Beetle, but
decided the $16,000-and-up car wasn't roomy enough. Now you have a
chance to buy one with no inside space at all, at an estimated
price of $70,000-plus. Oh, yes: This one doesn't run. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It is, in fact, a lump of clay with four wheels, a full-size
model for the final design of the Volkswagen on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The clay model is due to be auctioned on June 8 by Christie's in
New York, as part of a sale of 20th century decorative arts called
``Masterworks: 1900-2000.''
</P>
<P>
   The model would seem to be a white elephant in the sale, which
includes furniture by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, the Scottish
architect and designer; a town house at 242 E. 52nd St. designed by
Philip Johnson, and a prototype of a streamlined pencil sharpener
by Raymond Loewy, whose designs included the sleek '53 Studebaker
Starliner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to create a catalog of the best of the 20th century
in art and architecture,'' said Lars Rachen, head of Christie's
20th century decorative arts department. ``When we came to the end
of the 20th century in developing our wish list, we thought about
what really represented the '90s movement of revolutionizing
product and brand.'' Rachen said a life-size clay model elevated
the Beetle to the realm of sculpture. He persuaded VW, which will
reap the proceeds, less Christie's commission, to offer the model
for sale.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's expects the model to sell in a range of $70,000 to
$100,000, though Rachen concedes that there is little basis on
which to make estimates. No full-size auto clays are known to have
been auctioned, he said. Typically, automakers reuse the clay in
other models, or it is destroyed as designers take measurements for
molds needed in production. VW's designers provided instructions on
how to care for and repair the clay, which will eventually crack. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The model, of steel, wood and foam covered with modeling clay,
is 59 inches tall, 68 inches wide and 161 inches long. It weighs
nearly 2 tons; the wheels turn. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Freeman Thomas, one of 18 designers on the original New Beetle
team, who now heads the design department at DaimlerChrysler, said:
``I'm sure someone would want to have it in their collection. I
hope it is bought by someone who will preserve it and appreciate
it.''
</P>
<P>
   But he said it was sad that VW was not keeping the model.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it were me and I were Volkswagen, I would never, never sell
something like that at any price,'' he said. ``It is part of their
history.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Just as difficult to place an estimate on the worth of the model
is to guess who will buy it. Rechen said he hoped that a museum,
perhaps one that specializes in applied arts or design, would bid.
</P>
<P>
   The model will be on view in the climate-controlled galleries at
Christie's, 20 Rockefeller Plaza, starting June 3.

 &HT;    Glue gets girl out of sticky situation
 &HT;    By Duane D. Stanford
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - When a potted cactus fell on 6-year-old Kailey
Browning, more than 600 hard-to-see spines stuck in her arms.
</P>
<P>
   At the emergency room, doctors weren't sure how to remove the
needles without putting the little girl through excruciating pain.
The odd solution _ Elmer's glue.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Mark Stegelman, an Emory Eastside Medical Center
pediatrician, poured the glue on Kailey's arms, dried it with a
surgical lamp and peeled away the little girl's hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I wanted to do was get my daughter out of pain and here he
was with something so simple,'' Lory Browning said.
</P>
<P>
   Stegelman, who uses credit cards to flick bee stingers out of
patients' skin, got the glue idea from an Atlanta doctor who
recently learned about it at a pediatric conference in cactus-rich
Nevada. Because kids do the darnedest things, Stegelman said,
pediatricians often share innovative ways to deal with their
unusual predicaments _ like running into a cactus in Georgia. After
locating a fresh bottle of glue at the hospital's maintenance
office, Stegelman slathered it all over the soft underside of
Kailey's arm. Staffers and nurses gathered to watch.
</P>
<P>
   The glue took about 45 minutes to dry into that grayish-clear
hard coat kids like to call ``skin.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As we peeled it, we could see the spines in the glue,''
recalled Stegelman, who used tweezers to remove the last 70 or so
the glue didn't get.
</P>
<P>
   The glue method saved hours and as much as $200 over tweezing
the spines, the doctor said.
</P>
<P>
   Kailey is back to riding her bike and playing Nintendo. She has
just a few spines left under the skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever they come out of my skin two or three days from now,
they will probably hurt,'' she predicted, ``but all I have to do is
put Elmer's glue on it.''

SURGEON GENERAL WARNS OF PERILS OF ORAL DISEASES 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Oral diseases, from tooth decay to mouth cancer,
threaten the health of poor people, minorities, children and the
elderly, despite vast improvements in dental care over the past 50
years, according to a study made public by the surgeon general
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The report, the first comprehensive review of the scientific
literature on oral health, found that most Americans who are
middle-aged or younger can expect to keep their teeth for life,
largely because fluoride in the drinking water is helping to
prevent cavities.
</P>
<P>
   But the study also documented profound and little-noticed
disparities in care that, it said, amounted to ''a silent epidemic
of oral diseases'' among the nation's most vulnerable people.
</P>
<P>
   Socioeconomics, inadequate education, poor overall health and
lack of access to care all play a part. While an estimated 44
million Americans lack health insurance, more than 108 million lack
dental insurance. Many children in poor neighborhoods never see a
dentist, the study found, and elderly people often lose dental
insurance when they retire.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have had a tendency to separate oral health from the rest
of the body,'' said Dr. David Satcher, the surgeon general, in an
interview after releasing the study.
</P>
<P>
   Black men, the study found, have the highest rate of pharyngeal
cancers in the United States, and are less likely to survive than
whites. The percentage of people who had untreated dental cavities
was substantially higher among blacks than whites _ about twice as
many, according to the report. African Americans are more likely
than whites to have missing teeth, and also more likely to have gum
disease, the study found.
</P>
<P>
   The disparities were particularly great among children. The
study found that more than one-third of all poor youngsters from
ages 2 to 9 had untreated cavities, compared with 17 percent of
children who were not poor.
</P>
<P>
   And even children with health insurance often lack proper care;
a recent study, cited in the surgeon general's report, found that
among children covered by Medicaid, the government insurance
program for the poor, fewer than one in five had a preventive
dental visit during the previous year.
</P>
<P>
   To dentists who care for the poor, the findings were hardly a
surprise. With a grant from the Kellogg Foundation, a nonprofit
group, Dr. Allan Formicola, dean of the school of dentistry and
oral surgery at Columbia University in Manhattan, has arranged for
dental services at six middle schools in Harlem, Washington Heights
and Inwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're seeing about double the rate of dental emergencies,
teeth that either need to be extracted or have root canal'' as the
national average, Formicola said. ``These are kids that are sitting
in class with toothaches. This is a problem, and it's neglected.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the study highlighted surprising links between
oral health and general well-being. Scientists, the report said,
are beginning to document associations between chronic oral
infection and diabetes, heart disease, stroke and even babies with
low birth weights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The mouth can serve as an early warning system,'' the report
said, signaling trouble elsewhere in the body. Thrush, a yeast
infection in the mouth, is often a sign of infection with the virus
that causes AIDS. Joint disorders in the jaw might be a sign of
osteoporosis. ``The mouth,'' Satcher said, ``is a mirror for many
diseases that affect the body.''
</P>
<P>
   That point has often been lost on the public, including medical
professionals, experts say.
</P>
<P>
   ``The surgeon general's report is very important, because it not
only looks at things like decay, and what groups are still
suffering disproportionately, but it also connects up the problems
between oral health and general health,'' Formicola said.
</P>
<P>
   Others said the study was long overdue. ``We're the stepchild of
health care in the United States,'' said Robert Klaus, president of
Oral Health America, a nonprofit organization founded by dentists'
professional groups.
</P>
<P>
   Fluoridated drinking water, which helps prevent cavities, is one
of the great public health achievements of the 20th century,
Satcher's report said. Yet the study found that fluoridated water
reaches only 62 percent of Americans served by public water
supplies. Seven of the nation's 50 largest cities, including San
Diego, San Antonio and Portland, Ore., do not have fluoridated
water.
</P>
<P>
   The 309-page report took three years to prepare, and Satcher
unveiled it Thursday before a group of 24 first-graders at the
Shepherd Elementary School here. The children are learning about
oral health, under the auspices of a government-sponsored pilot
program.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Satcher said the session was an eye-opener for him;
as the child of uneducated farmers in rural Alabama, he did not see
a dentist until just before he went away to college. ``There are
still too many families like that in this country,'' he said.

YANKEES STRUGGLE WITH THE UNFAMILIAR: LOSING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ They were ``scruffin'' and scrounging, unsure of
themselves, wondering if their missing shortstop meant as much to
their team as this, a team that had lost itself for two weeks. A
team in doubt.
</P>
<P>
   The Cubs? The Tigers?
</P>
<P>
   No, the New York Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious we've been frustrated,'' said Yankee lefthander
Andy Pettitte, who came through Wednesday night when Roger Clemens
couldn't the previous night. ``We were in a little slump.''
</P>
<P>
   It hasn't been this way for years for the Yankees, who've loomed
head and shoulders above the rest of baseball for the last two
seasons. But with Derek Jeter out, the team in a full-scale hitting
slump, second baseman Chuck Knoblauch again bizarrely bouncing
throws in the general direction of first base, and no pitcher able
to step up and stop the slide until Pettitte Wednesday night, there
were traces of doubt in Yankee eyes and Yankee voices. Even if it
is only May.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not used to this,'' said Pettitte. ``We're very
unfamiliar with this losing. We've spoiled ourselves with how much
we've been winning and it's tough when you're not used to losing.
When you start losing when you're not used to losing, it's all the
tougher.''
</P>
<P>
   In consecutive games, Sunday in Cleveland and Tuesday in
Chicago, the Yankees had been shut down by young pitchers just
recalled from the minors the previous day. Manager Joe Torre had
been unusually frank in his disappointment with the
still-inconsistent Clemens (``It's frustrating when you expect a
well-pitched game and you don't get one''), who gave up a three-run
homer to the White Sox' Brook Fordyce in Fordyce's second at-bat of
the season Tuesday night as Chicago chased Clemens in the fifth
inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question the team is down,'' Torre said Tuesday.
``You could just sense that everybody knew we needed to turn this
around and there was a lot of screaming and yelling in the dugout,
but it wasn't to be.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, battered and bruised in body and spirit, had lost
eight of 11 games entering Thursday night's game against the White
Sox and James Baldwin, the American League's hottest pitcher. The
combination of the slump and the prospect of facing Baldwin left
the Yankees unwilling to look as far into the future as this
weekend, when the Yankees meet the Red Sox in a three-game set that
begins Friday night at Yankee Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not talking about the Red Sox,'' said the Yankees' Paul
O'Neill. ``We've got things to do before that series.''
</P>
<P>
   Like winning.
</P>
<P>
   Not the division, not the penannt, not the World Series. Just a
game or two or three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, we can put together a stretch now,'' said Pettitte
after the Yankees pounded out a season-high 18 hits in Wednesday's
12-4 win over the White Sox. ``We've got to continue to battle
through this slump.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Rocket needed a lift
</P>
<P>
   A night earlier, the fried chicken and barbecue ribs had gone
virtually untouched by the players after Clemens had failed
miserably (4 IP, 7 H, 6 R, 6 ER) when he was most needed. The
Yankee clubhouse was glum.
</P>
<P>
   Newcomer Lance Johnson had embraced Clemens in the locker room,
saying the pitcher ``needed some love and I was just trying to do
whatever I can to lift spirits.'' Yankee spirits were low.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is getting tired,'' said catcher Jorge Posada. ``It's
getting tired, you know, the losses. We've got a good team but it's
not happening. We're not doing whatever it takes to win; it's
frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Torre, ``There's no magic formula to breaking slumps. You
just have to hitch it up and grit your teeth a little bit and fight
your way through it.''
</P>
<P>
   All baseball teams struggle like this, but for the last two
years, it seemed the Yankees were immune to the game's ebbs and
flows. The Yankees never struggled. And now that the depths had
swallowed up the Yankees, the experience was unsettling.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you, we go up there to the plate and it seems every
pitcher is coming right at us and getting us out,'' said Posada,
whose bat (.345) has stood out amid the slump. ``It's so
frustrating offensively. We go out there and we try to do too much.
We've just got to go out there and play as a team, as a lineup, and
not as individuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeter has been out with an abdominal strain and is eligible to
come off the 15-day disabled list Saturday but Torre said he is not
sure how soon his shortstop will return to full duty. Jeter will
play in a minor league game Friday. Even with Jeter out, said
Posada, ``We can't worry about that; he's not with us. The rest of
us have got to play.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees' slump resulted in the usual New York tabloids'
Fantasy League trades, such as New York obtaining the Cubs' Sammy
Sosa (the laughter in Chicago could be heard in Milwaukee), Tampa
Bay's Jose Canseco, and a few other sluggers.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, of course, will return to winning, but it is
unclear if this is the same dominant Yankee team of the last two
years. Clemens has been inconsistent, staff ace Orlando ``El
Duque'' Hernandez is 4-4 with a 3.95 ERA, the .270 team batting
average was among the worst in the league, and, on a team no longer
dominant, the sheer fright of a Knoblauch throw to first base, for
example, takes on more meaning than the mere peculiarity it was
last year.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the pitching that concerns Torre.
</P>
<P>
   A baseball team ``bases its effort off its starting pitcher,''
Torre said Tuesday, ``and anytime a Roger Clemens gives up three
home runs it's a letdown for the team. There's no question. It's
not an excuse. But the combination of our trying to get the big hit
with Roger not having his best outing, that combination had made it
more frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees weren't hitting, Torre conceded, ``but I'm more
concerned about our pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Yankees don't seem to have is the one pitcher, such as
the Red Sox' Pedro Martinez, who can personally heal a team's
ailments. Pettitte, as usual, has been clutch but ``El Duque'' has
been hittable, David Cone is 1-3 with a 5.75 ERA, and Clemens has
struggled.
</P>
<P>
   When Clemens was asked about his inconsistency, he lapsed into
his usual pitcher-speak about ``velocity'' and ``location'' rather
than the grander picture of pitching well from game to game.
</P>
<P>
   Is he frustrated? Clemens was asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think my velocity was plenty good,'' came the Clemens reply,
``and I think I could probably take a little off (his velocity) to
try and locate better. I was sharp at times . . . but that ball to
Fordyce, I left too much of it out over the plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Torre, meanwhile, said, ``I always get surprised when this
happens because of the fact that he's Roger Clemens. His stuff was
good, but his location was way off.''
</P>
<P>
   And Bernie Williams? ``We've overcome a lot of adversity in the
past,'' he said. ``This should be no different than those other
times. It just happens to be we're playing bad right now.
Hopefully, we'll get out of it sooner than later.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Batters out of order
</P>
<P>
   Going into Thursday night's game, Williams had batted second six
times as Torre had tried to fill at least part of the Jeter void by
putting his most dependable hitter in Jeter's spot. ``It's very
important for the top of our lineup to hit well if we're going to
win,'' said Torre. ``That's why I put Bernie in the No. 2 slot.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a prototypical cleanup hitter anyway,'' said Williams.
``I don't hit any different batting second.''
</P>
<P>
   What he tries to do every at-bat, whether he's second or fourth,
is ``to try and react to the situation facing me,'' said Williams.
``If it's moving the runner, I'll try my best, and if it's driving
him in, I'll do my best, too. After you hit (second) the first time
in the lineup, after that it doesn't matter. You'll be facing
situations that call on you to do a lot of different things.''
</P>
<P>
   No difference, though.
</P>
<P>
   Williams has gone 9 for 31 in the second slot.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the bottom third of the order that has devastated the
Yankees. No matter whom Torre places in the seventh, eighth, and
ninth positions, he is left with Mendoza Line hitters.
</P>
<P>
   In Wednesday's game, for instance, the Yankees loaded the bases
with one out in the second inning against White Sox lefthander Mike
Sirotka. But Ricky Ledee (.215) waved feebly at a third strike and
shortstop Clay Bellinger (.176) looked on futilely as Sirotka fired
a third strike past him. Once again, no runs from a prosperous
situation.
</P>
<P>
   Still, said Williams, it's early in the season. True, two years
ago at this time, the Yankees had vaulted far ahead of their rivals
by now, and by this time last year, had begun to inch away from the
Red Sox. Still, said Williams, ``Only a quarter of the season has
been played; what? Sixty games. There are still a lot of things
that can happen.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we've got to do is make sure the guys who are healthy,
stay healthy. Hopefully we'll go back to the way we're capable of
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are ``a team that goes out there expecting to win
every game. And when we don't win, we're the first ones to ask the
question: `What's wrong with us?' ''
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees have been asking that question time and again the
last two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In motion with clutch hit
</P>
<P>
   The final score Wednesday night was 12-4, but that final score
was most deceptive. New York was trailing, 2-1, in the seventh
inning when Johnson had the at-bat of the week, if not the month,
for the Yankees, when he pinch hit with two on. The Yankees had
squandered many such opportunities during the slump but this time
Johnson, the former White Sox, drove a single to center, setting
off a seven-run explosion that was highlighted when O'Neill cleared
the bases with a double off the left-field wall.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what the situation was and how I needed to come
through,'' said Johnson. ``The team's been in the slump and I knew
I had to be aggressive up there to make things happen.''
</P>
<P>
   It is seldom said publicly by baseball players, but Johnson said
``luck'' is a primary ingredient in slumps. ``We just needed to get
some luck on our side, to have the hits fall in that hadn't been
falling in,'' said Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   But in the joy of the Yankees' locker room, the players eating
their postgame chicken and ribs after the win, there was one dark
undercurrent. Knoblauch was back to firing throws to first base of
which a Little Leaguer would be ashamed.
</P>
<P>
   On past Yankee teams, this mattered little. ``It's a head
thing'' with him, said Torre, who noted that Knoblauch had been
throwing normally up to now. But on a 2000 Yankee team that doesn't
seem dominant enough to pull away from its rivals, an eccentricity
can grow into much more.

SENATE CANDIDATE SMASHES SPENDING RECORD FOR A PRIMARY 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVID M. HALBFINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ In a race that threatens to redefine the limits
of what it costs to run for the U.S. Senate, Jon Corzine has
already spent nearly $25 million on his race for the Democratic
nomination, more than three times as much as anyone has ever spent
on a Senate primary and within striking distance of the most money
ever spent on an entire Senate election.
</P>
<P>
   The New Jersey primary for the seat being vacated by Sen. Frank
Lautenberg is not until June 6. But as of May 17, Corzine had spent
$24.9 million on his contest with former Gov. Jim Florio, according
to documents filed Thursday with the Federal Elections Commission.
The previous record for spending in a Senate primary is believed to
be the $8.1 million spent by Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., in his
1998 race against Geraldine Ferraro and Mark Green.
</P>
<P>
   The record for spending in an entire Senate race is now held by
Michael Huffington, the Republican millionaire who lost to Sen.
Dianne Feinstein, D-Calif., in 1994 after pouring nearly $30
million into his campaign, $28 million of which came from his own
fortune. The record for any statewide primary is the $38 million
spent by Al Checchi, an airline executive, in an unsuccessful bid
for the Democratic nomination for governor in California in 1998.
Because of its size and array of major media markets, California is
regarded as by far the most expensive state to mount a political
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine is likely to exceed Huffington's record even before
primary day. Since May 17, for example, Corzine has boosted his
purchases of television commercials in New York and Philadelphia by
50 percent, to $2 million a week, which is itself said to be a new
high for New Jersey political campaigns. And in the last week of
the primary campaign, Corzine is expected to spend close to another
$2 million on get-out-the-vote efforts, like hiring street workers
to knock on doors and telemarketers to make phone calls to his
supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in uncharted territory, here, and I don't think anybody
knows how high it'll go, except possibly Mr. Corzine himself,''
said Larry Makinson, executive director of the Center for
Responsive Politics in Washington. ``My sense is there's a whole
generation of sons and daughters of political consultants who'll be
going to the best Ivy League schools by the time this campaign is
over. And this could do for the profession of political consulting
what Watergate did for investigative journalism.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio has accused his rival of trying to ``buy the election,''
and Thursday, several advocates of campaign finance reform took up
that refrain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time you have a race with this kind of huge money,''
said Fred Wertheimer, president of Democracy 21, a Washington
public policy group, ``it takes you one step closer to a system
dominated by very wealthy people, or people who are completely
indebted to their campaign donors.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the kind of choice we're given in the congressional
campaign finance system today, and it's a bad choice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Corzine defends his campaign expenditures as necessary for a
political newcomer running against a household name like Florio.
And many experts say that New Jersey can be a particularly costly
place to run for statewide office, because the state has no widely
watched television station of its own, forcing candidates to
advertise on TV stations in both New York City and Philadelphia _
the nation's first and fourth most expensive media markets,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the hardest place in the world to communicate, to pop
through to the voters and get a message through, and Corzine's
running against someone who's universally known,'' said Hank
Morris, a consultant who has run campaigns in New York and New
Jersey, including Schumer's in 1998. ``There are only two ways to
get through to the voters in New Jersey: to communicate over a
very, very long time, which is what Florio's done, or to spend a
very large amount of money.''
</P>
<P>
   Since last summer, when Corzine paid thousands for consultants
to polish his presentation skills and help develop his political
platform, he has presided over the Rolls-Royce of campaigns. But in
the six-and-a-half-week period covered in his most recent FEC
filing, his spending accelerated, paying out a total of $14.6
million, or more than $300,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   In that period, his campaign bought $10.7 million worth of TV
and radio commercials, and $946,595 of newspaper ads. It spent
$337,607 on postage for direct mailings. It paid its consultants
$446,972, its canvassers $133,590, and its pollsters $639,600 _ at
a time when those pollsters still had not begun conducting nightly
tracking surveys.
</P>
<P>
   Over 47 days, the Corzine campaign paid 44 different catering
bills totaling $113,063.
</P>
<P>
   By comparison, Florio's shoestring campaign spent all of $1.1
million over the same period, $900,000 of that to purchase TV
advertisements that began running only on Wednesday, 10 weeks after
Corzine's television campaign started. All told, since last year,
Florio has spent $1.9 million running for the Democratic nomination
_ meaning that he has now been outspent by more than 13-to-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``One would want some kind of financial balance in our campaign
process,'' said Wertheimer, of Democracy 21. ``And whatever the
appropriate balance might be, this huge sum far exceeds it. You get
to a point where it appears like someone is buying a seat.''
</P>
<P>
   Florio continued Wednesday to describe Corzine's spending as
``obscene.''
</P>
<P>
   ``However this thing turns out, he's going to be the poster boy
for campaign finance reform,'' Florio said, likening his rival to
``the oligarchs in Russia who are buying places in power, buying
the government.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We have our own new set of oligarchs, and they have a new
champion,'' Florio added. ``Or maybe it's a co-champion, between
Steve Forbes and Jon Corzine.''
</P>
<P>
   Corzine's co-campaign manager, Steven Goldstein, responded
equally harshly. ``Jon Corzine has spent one dollar for every lie
Jim Florio has told in this campaign,'' he said, adding that
Florio's $2.8 billion 1990 tax hike as governor remained of greater
importance to the New Jersey electorate than the subject of
campaign finance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Voters will care far more about the billions of dollars Jim
Florio has taken out of their pockets than the millions Jon Corzine
has taken out of his,'' he said.

REGION'S ECONOMY IS EXPECTED TO COOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH HEALY  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   This may be as good as it gets.
</P>
<P>
   Even as business activity and hiring in New England continue to
sizzle, area economists warn that growth in the region will begin
to slow this year amid rising interest rates, a weaker stock
market, and a vexing shortage of workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The economy currently is on fire,'' said Mark Zandi, chief
economist atRFA/Dismal Sciences, at the annual outlook meeting of
the New England Economic Project. ``You could easily argue that New
England is the strongest economy in the country, bar none.''
</P>
<P>
   That's been true only twice since World War II, Zandi said
Thursday, and not in the past 15 years. But Boston is seeing signs
of a peak, from higher prices on goods and services to a slowdown
from the spike in home building.
</P>
<P>
   The very foundation of the region's rise _ the high-tech boom
and the rise of personal investing _ make it more vulnerable than
the rest of the country in an eventual downturn, Zandi said. Scores
of start-ups could find themselves short of money and mulling
layoffs or sales to larger rivals, he suggested. Similarly, the
area's many mutual fund companies and investment houses could
struggle if the market dives further.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate future is reasonably bright. Economists are
projecting growth for the region to top out at 4 percent this year
but to stay in the upper 2 percent range through 2004. Employment
growth is expected continue at half its recent pace, to about 1
percent annually. Real income growth is expected slow to 1.9
percent in 2004, down from 4 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   The wild cards in the forecast: technology and the stock market.
</P>
<P>
   Economists at Thursday's outlook conference apologized for past
predictions of gloom that turned out wrong. They said it was hard
to foresee that the so-called ``wealth effect'' from the stock
market would keep individuals and companies spending money for nine
straight years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Economists have really underestimated the role of technology
in economic growth,'' said Stanley Feldman, associate professor of
finance at Bentley College and director of the economic project.
</P>
<P>
   Unemployment nationally has been below 5 percent for five years,
down from a 7 percent average in the prior 20 years. Gross domestic
product, notching a vigorous 5.4 percent in the first quarter, has
been running at 4 percent for five years, up from 3 percent for the
prior 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, workers are more efficient than ever, thanks in large
part to better technology. Productivity is still improving about 3
percent annually; from 1974 through 1994, the average didn't hit 2
percent. More people own homes than ever, and nearly half the
country owns stocks, up from one-third a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
   New England has the lowest jobless rate in the country, at 2.5
percent. Personal income has jumped about 6 percent for three
straight years and is expected to do the same in 2000. And consumer
confidence is scraping the very top of the scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's almost impossible to find any sense of gloom or
pessimism,'' said John Gorman, president of Opinion Dynamics, which
measures confidence for the economic project.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, dot-com millionaires still grace the covers of magazines
and companies can't find enough employees. But the dramatic growth
in the regional economy in recent years won't continue, said
Charles Cogan, a professor at the University of Southern Maine.
</P>
<P>
   ``This time, we really, really mean it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Economists from each state in the region pointed to similar
problems on the horizon. They said growth will slow because there
simply aren't enough workers for big companies like Cisco and IBM,
which are expanding here, to hire. Too few workers and the recent
jump in energy prices will push up prices.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is expected to see a 4 percent jump in the consumer price
index this year, up from 2.5 percent last year and the biggest rise
in a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Other risks in the economy include a surge in borrowing and
lower savings rates, especially among people earning less than
$40,000, the US median household income.
</P>
<P>
   As a region, New England faces a transportation crisis, said
Michael Gallis, a North Carolina economist. Distracted by the Big
Dig and without a solid plan for its seaports, airports and roads,
he said, the region is at risk of locking itself out of the global
economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It represents a real threat to the region,'' Gallis said.
</P>
<P>
   The economists made clear that the states will be spending
hundreds of millions of dollars to improve roads, shipping ports,
and regional airports in the coming years.
</P>
<P>
   The key may be to accomplish those plans before the next
recession. Jeffrey Carr, a Vermont economist from Economic and
Policy Resources Inc., said he expects no recession through 2004.
Even then, he said, ``Upturns don't die of old age.'' His view: The
Federal Reserve could kill this longest expansion in history.
</P>
<P>
   A worse case scenario, said Edward Deak, a professor at
Fairfield University in Connecticut, is that the Fed could hike
rates another 2.5 points in a year, much more than Wall Street
expects. That would surely slam the brakes on the market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Look out seven or eight years and the picture becomes far more
grim. By then, this wave of Internet innovation will be maturing,
suggested Dennis Delay, senior economist at the Public Service Co.
of New Hampshire. And the baby boomers will start taking money out
of those retirement funds that have helped fuel the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   Said Zandi, ``New England has benefited the most and it will be
hurt the most if the market stumbles significantly.''

REPUBLICANS REJECT CAMPAIGN REFORM EFFORT 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG McDONALD 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Lloyd Doggett, D-Texas, failed Thursday to win
approval of a measure that would force tax-exempt political
fund-raising organizations to disclose their contributors and
expenditures.
</P>
<P>
   The measure, aimed at curbing the growing power of groups that
secretly raise and spend millions to influence elections, was
defeated in the House 214-207, with most Democrats supporting it
and most Republicans voting against it.
</P>
<P>
   The measure was offered as part of motion to recommit a bill
that repeals the 102-year-old federal excise tax on telephones.
That bill passed overwhelmingly, after Republicans turned back
Doggett's motion.
</P>
<P>
   The Doggett proposal, which was also rejected by the House Ways
and Means Committee for a second time Thursday, is designed to
crack down on so-called ``stealth PACs'' or ``527 organizations''
that get special tax breaks by claiming to be political
fund-raising groups but avoid federal campaign disclosure laws by
denying any political affiliation.
</P>
<P>
   The groups qualify for tax-exempt status under Section 527 of
the Internal Revenue Service Code, which permits them to keep their
fund-raising and spending activities private.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett's proposal would force the groups to file their donor
and spending records with the IRS or lose their tax-exempt status.
</P>
<P>
   The Republicans argued that they needed more time to study
whether other tax-exempt groups should be forced to disclose their
fund-raising and spending habits.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is against full disclosure. But today is not the time
and this is not the place for this debate,'' said Rep. Amory
Houghton, R-N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   He urged his colleagues to wait for a package of tax code
revisions being drawn up by House Ways and Means Committee Chairman
Bill Archer, R-Texas, that may end up closing a number of loopholes
that allow groups to conduct campaign activities in secrecy and
without any regulation.
</P>
<P>
   Doggett, however, accused Republicans of trying to delay action
on his legislation until the November elections.
</P>
<P>
   ``The 527 is not some type of new secret aircraft, but it is the
superweapon that can undermine this election,'' Doggett said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that Republicans won't support his proposal because it
will end up costing them valuable support in this year's campaigns
from 527 groups with ties to House Majority Whip Tom DeLay,
R-Texas, and other Republican leaders.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay is being sued by the Democratic Congressional Campaign
Committee for allegedly using the organizations, at least three of
which are run by or were organized by former aides and associates,
to help Republican candidates avoid federal election contribution
and spending limits. DeLay has denied the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   One DeLay-affiliated group, the Republican Majority Issues
Committee, is planning to raise and spend $25 million on
advertising, polling, mailings and other campaign activities in at
least a dozen congressional races this year.
</P>
<P>
   As Doggett's motion was being voted down Thursday, the Federal
Election Commission was taking up a proposal that would force 527
organizations to register with the FEC, which would require them to
report their expenditures and the identities of their contributors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal was offered by FEC Commissioner Karl Sandstrom, a
Democrat, who has described 527s as little more than ``political
slush funds.'' At the FEC meeting, he said the groups are engaged
in an ``audacious circumvention'' of federal campaign laws, which
were enacted after the Watergate scandal to promote full disclosure
in federal elections.
</P>
<P>
   The FEC is not expected to act on Sandstrom's proposal before
the November elections. The commission, however, may hold public
hearings on it before then.

   A STAR REBUKED BY EQUITY
</P>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a mild rebuke, a disciplinary panel of Actors
Equity has ruled that Patrick Stewart, the star of Arthur Miller's
``Ride Down Mount Morgan,'' will have to make a formal _ but not
public _ apology to the Shubert Organization for a curtain speech
he made attacking the play's producers.
</P>
<P>
   The speech, in which Stewart accused the Shuberts of failing to
promote ``Mount Morgan,'' prompted the Shuberts to file
disciplinary charges against Stewart accusing him of unprofessional
behavior.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing several hours of testimony on May 11, the panel,
composed of five union members, made its decision.
</P>
<P>
   A 10-day appeal period ended Thursday, and several people
familiar with the decision said Stewart would not appeal it.
</P>
<P>
   Stewart, who has won critical praise for his role as a defiant
bigamist in ``Mount Morgan,'' made the speech at the matinee and
evening performances of ``Mount Morgan'' on April 29. He said he
felt ``frustrated and helpless'' because of what he considered the
producers' lack of support for the play.
</P>
<P>
   The Shuberts countered by saying that more than $1 million had
been spent on promoting the play, which received good reviews.
</P>
<P>
   Under Equity rules, an actor found to be behaving in an
unprofessional manner can be fined or, in extremely rare cases,
expelled from the union.
</P>
<P>
   TONY TELECAST LINEUP
</P>
<P>
   The Tony Awards announced the schedule Thursday for the June 4
telecast, and the entertainment lineup was no surprise: seven
musical numbers (from three revivals and four new musicals), and a
big opening number from the host Rosie O'Donnell.
</P>
<P>
   As for the plays, Keith Sherman, a spokesman for the awards,
said the plays would be part of ``a videotaped package'' devoted to
both new work and revivals. Last year's approach _ a medley of
lines from a half-dozen plays _ was widely viewed as a failure.
</P>
<P>
   One small surprise Thursday: Nathan Lane will help O'Donnell
with the hosting duties. His official title? Special guest star.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had toyed with saying `The Tony Awards, hosted by Rosie
O'Donnell, valet parking by Nathan Lane,''' he said. ``But they
thought this was better.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   KEVIN SPACEY STEPS UP
</P>
<P>
   As far as pinch hitters go, there are not many people you'd
rather have in your dugout than Kevin Spacey.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask the current cast and crew of ``Cobb,'' the 1989 drama
by Lee Blessing about the irascible baseball legend Ty Cobb who
starred for the Detroit Tigers in the early years of the century.
The show, which received good reviews but has had only decent
audiences, was to have closed its run at Theater 3 on West 43rd
Street last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   But then Spacey entered the game. Last Thursday night, Spacey, a
recent Oscar winner for ``American Beauty,'' saw ``Cobb'' during a
sweep through New York between films. The draw, he said, was
Matthew Mabe, who plays the title role and was an understudy last
year in ``The Iceman Cometh,'' in which Spacey starred.
</P>
<P>
   ``I figured I should go to support Matthew,'' said Spacey.
``Plus, I never knew anything about Cobb.''
</P>
<P>
   What he found so impressed him that when he heard about the
imminent closing, he pulled out the theatrical equivalent of a
Louisville Slugger: his checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Spacey nor officials at the Melting Pot Theater Company,
the producers, are saying how much money Spacey gave, but it was
enough to extend the run at least two weeks. Spacey has been
phoning ``anybody who'll take my call'' to get producers to see the
show.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the kind of theater I like to encourage,'' Spacey said.
``I don't mind kicking up a little dust to get people to pay
attention to something like this.''  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   `SWEET SMELL'
</P>
<P>
   In the canon of loathsome megalomaniacs, they don't get much
better than J.J. Hunsecker.
</P>
<P>
   Portrayed by Burt Lancaster in the 1957 classic, ``Sweet Smell
of Success,'' Hunsecker is a powerful Broadway columnist whose
career of dishing gossip and innuendo has hardened him into a dark,
ruthless cipher.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Hunsecker is a character most actors would love to
play. Now, with a workshop of the musical version of ``Sweet
Smell'' in the offing, John Lithgow has landed the role. Brian
d'Arcy James will play Sidney Falco, the scurrilous press agent
portrayed by Tony Curtis in the movie.
</P>
<P>
   Lithgow is probably best known now from the television show
``Third Rock From the Sun.'' But he won a Tony in 1973 for ``The
Changing Room'' and was nominated two other times.
</P>
<P>
   The six-week workshop, which begins on June 26, will conclude
with two sets of performances for potential producers at the
beginning of August. It is not, unfortunately, open to the public,
but the production itself is aiming for a Broadway debut in the
spring of 2001.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   YOUNG PLAYWRIGHTS
</P>
<P>
   A youth movement (of sorts) has taken hold at Manhattan Theater
Club.
</P>
<P>
   The theater, which scored a critical hit this week with
``Proof,'' by the 30-year-old playwright David Auburn, has
announced a 2000-2001 schedule packed with all manner of talented
30-somethings.
</P>
<P>
   Heading the list is David Lindsay-Abaire, also 30, whose newest
play, ``Wonder of the World,'' opens the season on Stage One. The
show, about a woman who leaves her husband in search of adventure,
had its world premiere at the Woolly Mammoth Theater in Washington
this week. On Stage Two, the playwright Melanie Marnich, 37, will
stage her play ``Blur.''
</P>
<P>
   Another new voice, Rebecca Gilman, 35, will also be produced on
Stage One with her ``Boy Gets Girl,'' a drama about a woman who is
stalked by a stranger.
</P>
<P>
   In the sole nod to seniority, the latest from Alan Ayckbourn,
61, his ``Comic Potential,'' fills out the schedule on Stage One.

2 OFFICIALS REBUKED FOR TRIPP DISCLOSURES 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELIZABETH BECKER  
 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Secretary of Defense William Cohen reprimanded his
spokesman, Kenneth Bacon, and another senior defense official
Thursday for releasing information to a journalist in 1998 from the
private personnel file of Linda Tripp.
</P>
<P>
   Cohen's action came after a two-year investigation by the
inspector general of the Defense Department concluded earlier this
month that Bacon and his former assistant, Clifford H. Bernath, had
violated the federal Privacy Act by disclosing confidential
material from Tripp's Pentagon employment file.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, the Justice Department found no reason to bring
criminal charges against the two officials.
</P>
<P>
   In his reprimand Thursday, Cohen expressed disappointment in
Bacon but said there was no evidence that his spokesman had
intended to harm Tripp in answering a reporter's inquiry two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Responding to an inquiry from The New Yorker Magazine, Bacon and
Bernath told a reporter that Tripp had incorrectly stated on a
security clearance form that she had never been arrested. Jane
Mayer, a New Yorker writer who was working on a profile of Tripp,
had asked the officials whether the Pentagon employee had disclosed
a long-ago arrest.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp's tape recordings of telephone conversations she had with
Monica S. Lewinsky led Kenneth Starr, who was then the Whitewater
independent counsel, to begin investigating President Clinton. That
investigation led to Clinton's impeachment in the most serious
presidential scandal since Watergate.
</P>
<P>
   Mayer asked the Pentagon spokesman whether Tripp had admitted on
her security clearance form that she was arrested in 1969 on a
charge of grand larceny that was later dismissed. On Bacon's
instructions, Bernath searched the file and discovered that Tripp
had not mentioned the arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The Privacy Act prohibits the government from disclosing
employee records in most instances without the consent of the
employee
</P>
<P>
   Bacon said Thursday that while he respected Cohen's decision, he
believed that his conduct had been lawful under the federal Freedom
of Information Act, which makes such information available to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly never occurred to me that the Privacy Act would
preclude disclosing how a public figure recorded a public arrest
record on a security clearance,'' Bacon said.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this week, the chief state prosecutor of Maryland
dropped criminal wiretap charges against Tripp, concluding the only
criminal case against a major figure in the scandal.
</P>
<P>
   Tripp has filed a lawsuit against the White House, the
Department of Defense and Bacon, asserting that they had conspired
to intimidate her and that they had violated her rights under the
privacy act.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Bacon released that information, it had a devastating
impact on Linda Tripp's credibility during a crucial phase of the
Lewinsky investigation,'' Stephen M. Kohn, a lawyer for Tripp, said
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Kohn said he would ask the president to overturn what he called
a mild rebuke, since the reprimand will not be included in Bacon's
personnel file. He said he would ask the president to take
immediate disciplinary action, which could include firing Bacon.
</P>
<P>
   In a news release, Bacon argued that the two-year investigation,
including 95 interviews, had found that there was no evidence of
White House involvement in his handling of the New Yorker request,
and that his only motive was ``a desire to be responsive to an
urgent media inquiry.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This matter is an extremely small part of a large and painful
national drama, which is why it has been studied by the Office of
Independent Counsel and the Justice Department, both of which
decided no further action was appropriate,'' Bacon said.

   BC-BETTY-FRIEDAN-NYT (moved on Wednesday, May 10)
</P>
<P>
   A New York Times News Service article sent on Wednesday, May 10,
reported on an extensive interview with the author Betty Friedan.
</P>
<P>
   In the fourth paragraph, it recounted her assertions in a
recently published memoir, ``Life So Far,'' that her former
husband, Carl Friedan, had physically abused her. In the 23rd
paragraph, the article noted that Friedan could not be reached for
comment on her accusation. (His telephone number, although
officially listed, was missing from several directory assistance
databases.)
</P>
<P>
   In fairness, in view of the seriousness of the accusation, The
Times should have sought Friedan's response in person or by mail,
and should have quoted him early in the article.
</P>
<P>
   A week after the interview appeared, a letter from Friedan
appeared in some editions, in which he called the accusation
``blatantly untrue'' and added, ``Never in my life have I ever
gratuitously struck anyone.'' But Friedan's letter was printed just
above one from another reader, who assumed the truth of the
accusation, and the placement seemed to undercut his denial. His
letter should have been printed in all editions, and the
juxtaposition should not have occurred.

RANGERS' CLAYTON WAS OUT OF LINE, BUT NOT A ROCKER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By T.R. SULLIVAN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Royce Clayton voiced an opinion last week. A
strong one.
</P>
<P>
   It may not have been one some people agree with, but if it came
from Clayton, you can be sure it was heartfelt, sincere and
carefully considered.
</P>
<P>
   In this case he was probably too harsh in his judgments about
teammate Chad Curtis. Curtis may be a fourth outfielder, but he has
been a valuable addition to the Rangers and saved them from
disaster when both Rusty Greer and Gabe Kapler went down with
injuries.
</P>
<P>
   Like Clayton, though, Curtis] is strong-willed and opinionated
with heartfelt beliefs. They both took a stance they sincerely
believed, and it caused hard feelings. It was unfortunate there was
a problem, but it needed to be addressed, regardless of who was
right or wrong. Those in Rangers' management only fool themselves
if they think otherwise, and the problem was not simply that
Clayton went public.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton's preference from the beginning was to keep the dispute
within the clubhouse, but however he voiced his views, attention
must be paid.
</P>
<P>
   There are some athletes who like to pop off without knowing what
they are talking about. John Rocker is the ultimate example. Barry
Bonds does it all the time, and his San Francisco Giants teammates
only roll their eyes and ignore him, knowing it is Barry being
Barry.
</P>
<P>
   Clayton is not John Rocker. He is a person of substance, as
former club president Tom Schieffer observed when giving him a
four-year contract. Clayton's work in the community speaks for
itself. He is active in the Sickle Cell Foundation, the Jackie
Robinson Foundation and the Arlington school system. He is building
a youth ballpark in Lancaster.
</P>
<P>
   He is not given to controversy, but he does not back down. He
believes Major League Baseball should do more to promote baseball
in inner cities, at least as much as they do in Latin America. He
believes baseball hasn't done enough to promote the hiring of
African-Americans and Hispanics for managerial and front-office
positions, and he was willing to voice his concern in spring
training.
</P>
<P>
   His opinions should carry weight. It should not matter that he
is African-American. Yet it is obvious that he has received no
small amount of backlash for what he said last week.
</P>
<P>
   I asked him this week about the proposal to raise the pitcher's
mound and he begged off, saying, ``I don't think I'm going to have
any opinions for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps in this case discretion is the better part of valor, but
it's obvious the flap has affected him. He was as hot as anybody in
the Rangers' lineup until the storm erupted; now he's struggling
with the bat again. He was hitless in 14 at-bats going into last
night's game.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis, in a testament to his character, has been truly
forgiving. When Clayton made a nice running catch Saturday night,
Curtis was there first with the high-five and the slap on the back.
He is willing to move on. Clayton should be allowed to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   He is not Alex Rodriguez or Nomar Garciaparra, but he is an
important part of the team. After Ivan Rodriguez, he is the
Rangers' second-best defensive player and a major contributor on
offense. The Rangers started taking off when he moved to the lower
half of the order and started crushing the baseball.
</P>
<P>
   He also loves to have fun. Clayton plays baseball with joy,
realizing that it truly is a game. If it's not fun, it's not worth
doing. But right now it's not fun and that's not good, for him or
the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   As Clayton said, the damage is done. But for the Rangers' sake,
the damage was limited and, as the season progresses, the wounds
will heal and he will be the player he should be.
</P>
<P>
   But there is no ignoring the person he is. {T.R. Sullivan writes
a column for the Fort Worth Star-Telegram.} &QL;

AT&AMP;T CLEARS STEP IN BID TO PURCHASE MEDIAONE GROUP
</HEADLINE>

 By STEPHEN LABATON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department approved AT&AMP;T's proposed
acquisition of the MediaOne Group Thursday, giving the telephone
giant control over more than a third of the nation's cable network
for television, high-speed Internet access and online telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which requires the companies to sell their
interest in Road Runner, the nation's second-largest cable Internet
service, clears a significant regulatory hurdle. The companies now
await a decision, expected soon, by the Federal Communications
Commission. The staff of the commission has raised concerns about
the companies having too much control over both cable systems and
programming. Federal regulations prohibit a company from owning
more than 30 percent of the nation's cable systems and by some
estimates, AT&AMP;T would control more than 40 percent once it
completed its purchase of MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors and consumer groups have also asked the FCC to force
the sale of more assets to assure that the marketplace for cable
television, high-speed Internet access and online telephone service
remains competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger was valued at $58 billion when it was
announced a year ago during a wave of consolidation in the
telecommunications and high-speed Internet markets. Those deals
have posed a particular challenge for antitrust regulators because
of the complex interlocking ownership interests between cable
operators, programmers and high-speed Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Both AT&AMP;T, which will be the nation's largest cable operator
when it completes the purchase of MediaOne, and Time Warner, which
will be the second largest, share interests in the same high-speed
Internet and programming companies.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, for instance, has a controlling interest in
Excite(AT)Home, the largest cable modem service, while MediaOne has
a substantial interest in Road Runner, the second-largest service.
Time Warner, which is being acquired by America Online, also has a
large interest in Road Runner. Moreover, MediaOne and Time Warner
have large interests in Time Warner Entertainment, a programming
and cable operating company.
</P>
<P>
   As its market share in the long-distance telephone business has
begun to erode, AT&AMP;T has embarked on a whirlwind of acquisitions to
transform itself into a company that will be able to offer
consumers a basket of services _ television, Internet service along
with local, long-distance and wireless telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, it has alarmed consumer groups and competitors
who are concerned that the the company is turning into an Internet
version of the powerhouse monopoly that it was before the
government broke it up 16 years ago. The critics have urged federal
officials to force AT&AMP;T to sell its interest in programming
operations and cable modem services.
</P>
<P>
   While officials at the Justice Department agreed with the
arguments over MediaOne's interest in Road Runner, they did not
find antitrust problems with other aspects of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger as proposed would have had an anti-competitive
impact on the emerging broadband market,'' said Joel Klein, the
assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division.
``The divestiture assures that AT&AMP;T will not acquire undue leverage
in its dealings with broadband content providers, and American
consumers will be the ultimate beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T executives hailed the decision, which they said they had
anticipated from the moment the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road Runner divestiture is an obligation we always assumed
we would face, and the decree proposes both a schedule and process
that are fair and feasible,'' said James Cicconi, AT&AMP;T's general
counsel. ``We expect to gain FCC approval of the merger shortly.
After that, our intention is to close the merger as quickly as we
can. Customers are clamoring for broadband, digital cable
television and choice in local phone service. Our acquisition of
MediaOne will greatly increase our ability to deliver all of those
highly sought consumer services.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups said the decision fell short of assuring
competition in the emerging market and urged the FCC to force the
companies to sell more assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important first step, but we're disappointed that AT&AMP;T
was not also required to divest the cable systems and programming
they jointly own with the second-largest cable company, Time
Warner,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office
of Consumers Union. ``This begins to disentangle the web of
ownership between the two largest cable companies. The FCC should
now use its rules to split apart the programming networks and cable
systems that the two companies jointly own.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the staff of the FCC recommended that, because AT&AMP;T
had such a large market share of cable systems, the company should
relinquish either some control over those systems or some of their
interests in programming. Staff officials suggested that could be
accomplished by measures like divesting its programming units,
Liberty Media and Rainbow Media Sports Holdings Inc., or MediaOne's
interest in Time Warner Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which is expected to issue its decision soon,
may adopt those recommendations, reject them or pursue another
course. But its hand in negotiating with AT&AMP;T was significantly
strengthened last Friday when a federal appeals court, reversing a
lower court decision, upheld the constitutionality of the
regulations that limit how much of the cable industry one company
may control.

SHIITE MILITIA POISED TO BROADEN ITS BASE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KHIAM, Lebanon _ The yellow flag of Hezbollah snapped in the
wind Thursday, high over the notorious prison complex of drab
cement buildings here.
</P>
<P>
   The storming of this prison, where opponents of Israel's
occupation were held and reportedly tortured, has become the symbol
of liberation to the guerrillas who this week forced the retreat of
Israel from Lebanon. It is their Bastille.
</P>
<P>
   And as Lebanon celebrated a new date on its calendar _
``Liberation Day'' _ the Shiite Muslim militia, Hezbollah, credited
with defeating the Israeli military, seized on this symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah knows the importance of symbols such as Khiam, and is
likely to use them for political gain in the coming months. The
withdrawal of Israel paves the way for the Iran-backed group to
complete its transformation from military organization to ascendant
political force as Lebanon heads toward parliamentary elections in
July.
</P>
<P>
   ``This day should be called National Hezbollah Day,'' said Nizar
Hamzi, a political scientist at the American University of Beirut,
who is a specialist on the rise of Hezbollah. Currently, Hezbollah
as a political party has 20,000 registered members. It holds only
seven seats in Lebanon's 120-member Parliament, but its influence
far exceeds that. It has been known to attract 100,000 people at
its rallies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hezbollah has a broad base of support that is growing broader.
They are seen as heroes here now,'' said Hamzi. ``Their campaigning
for this summer is well underway, and they will do very well.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Islamic fundamentalism espoused by Hezbollah is met with
anxiety by those who feel its strict Islamic conservatism could
upset Lebanon's pluralism. Many Christian groups have watched with
concern as heavily armed Hezbollah guerrillas have paraded on tanks
confiscated from abandoned Israeli posts.
</P>
<P>
   Moving quickly to address such fears, Hezbollah has assured
Christians that the power vacuum left by the withdrawal of Israel
and its Christian-led proxy militia, the South Lebanon Army, would
be filled in an orderly fashion and that there would be no acts of
revenge against those Christians who have stayed in the region.
</P>
<P>
   It was a message reiterated by Iranian Foreign Minister Kamal
Kharrazi, who gazed over Lebanon's border with Israel for the first
time Thursday during a tour of what Israel had called the security
zone.
</P>
<P>
   Standing on top of a hill controlled by Israel less than three
days ago, Kharrazi looked down on the nearby settlements of Israel,
the avowed enemy of Iran.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a victory promised in the Koran to the people who
exhibit patience and steadfastness,'' Kharrazi said at a rally of
the Shiite Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas in Bint Jbeil, in the former
occupied area.
</P>
<P>
   Former inmates Thursday led impromptu tours of the prison,
describing the different chambers where beatings took place, and
how the 140 men held here were forced to live amid filth and
overcrowding.
</P>
<P>
   Khiam was run by the South Lebanon Army. Human rights groups
have reported extensively on interrogation methods at Khiam that
included torture and in some cases led to death. Israel had
persistently denied the allegations. But in a recent court
affidavit, the Israeli military said that agents of Israel's
internal security service, the Shin Bet, were involved in
``everything having to do with gathering of intelligence and
questioning'' at Khiam.
</P>
<P>
   From all over the country, tens of thousands of people have been
flooding into Khiam and other sites.
</P>
<P>
   The streets were jammed with traffic by those who came to see
homes that they had been forced to abandon when the Israelis
invaded the area in 1982. Some came to see family and friends they
had left behind, and others to leave fresh flowers on overgrown
graves.

   In the village of Dibin, Ibrahim Yassin, 52, was back in his
hometown for the first time in 22 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the blood and bravery of Hezbollah that achieved
this,'' said Yassin. ``I don't think anyone will forget what they
did for our country.''

EU LIKELY TO SCRUTINIZE UAL-US AIRWAYS DEAL 
</HEADLINE>
   By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The European Commission said Thursday it would probably have to
review closely the competitive aspects of UAL Corp.'s proposed
takeover of US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement did not come as a surprise _ James E. Goodwin,
the chairman and chief executive of UAL, had said he expected the
deal would be subjected to scrutiny by the commission _ but it is
another hurdle the companies must clear to complete UAL's $4.3
billion acquisition of US Airways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would have been surprised if they had said they wouldn't
look at this,'' said James Higgins, an airline industry analyst at
Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP; Jenrette. However, the US Airways-United
combination ``doesn't change the balance of power that much in the
North Atlantic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It primarily improves United's ability to pull traffic off the
East Coast,'' Higgins said, ``and traffic emanating east of the
Mississippi produces two-thirds of the traffic across the North
Atlantic.''
</P>
<P>
   United offers trans-Atlantic flights to six European cities from
Washington Dulles International Airport, Kennedy International
Airport in New York, Logan Airport in Boston, Newark International
Airport, Chicago O'Hare, San Francisco and Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   US Airways offers service to Paris; Frankfurt, Germany; Madrid,
Spain; Rome; Munich, Germany, and London's Gatwick Airport.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trans-Atlantic is by far the largest international presence US
Airways has, but they don't have much international presence,''
Higgins said.
</P>
<P>
   Investors focused on the challenges facing United Thursday,
casting a pall over the entire airline group.
</P>
<P>
   Airline stocks moved lower on Wall Street, and none fell harder
than US Airways. The company's shares, which jumped on Wednesday
after UAL's announcement of its $60-a-share cash offer, slumped $4
Thursday to $45. UAL fell for a second day, closing at $52.50, down
37.5 cents.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of United's biggest competitors, AMR Corp., parent of
American Airlines, and Delta Air Lines, also fell. AMR lost
$2.9375, to $27.125. Delta closed at $50.4375, down $1.0625.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to worries about the implications of the merger, an
increase in oil prices did not help the group, nor did the
performance of the overall market.
</P>
<P>
   Higgins of Donaldson, Lufkin, which downgraded airline stocks
Thursday, said that ``given the uncertainty in the industry,
investors aren't going to care about fundamentals unless they are
negative.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Murphy, an analyst at Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, said he
was ``nonplussed'' by Thursday's move in airline stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it is a good thing for the marketplace to rationalize
the assets,'' he said. ``There is a lot of misunderstanding and
hysteria going on that we have told clients to buy into. This is an
opportunity, not a problem.''

PULLOUT STIRS UNCERTAINTY IN ISRAELI BORDER TOWNS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALIZA MARCUS  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   KIRYAT SHEMONA, Israel _ Simon Champion is a real-estate agent
with an unusual pitch: Buy two apartments and get the third free.
And if that's not enough, the price of each three-bedroom apartment
has dropped by nearly half, to $36,000.
</P>
<P>
   But he still can't find any buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't sold an apartment since January,'' bemoaned the
37-year-old real-estate agent in Kiryat Shemona, an Israeli town
that borders Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The truth is, nobody wants to buy because the situation is too
risky, and you know what, if I had the money, even I would move
from here,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's withdrawal from south Lebanon this week after 22 years
of occupation had broad support throughout the country, but in the
northern towns that border Lebanon, the pullout has created an
almost unbearable uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   Kiryat Shemona is one of the towns on the front line. Even when
Israeli troops patrolled the 9-mile deep ``security zone'' in south
Lebanon _ set up to protect Israel's northern communities from
attack _ Hezbollah guerrillas were able to rocket the area with
Katyushas, forcing people to spend days in underground shelters.
</P>
<P>
   But now that the soldiers have pulled out, residents don't know
whether to be happy that young Israeli men will no longer die in a
foreign land or fearful that the withdrawal makes it even easier
for Hezbollah fighters to attack.
</P>
<P>
   Although so far the border is quiet, the question is what will
happen in a few weeks, after Hezbollah fighters and their
supporters who have moved into south Lebanon stop celebrating.
</P>
<P>
   ``My children won't even go to the bathroom alone at night, they
are too scared that a bomb will fall on us after all the nights and
days we have had to spend in bomb shelters,'' said Yossi Aboudy, a
49-year-old resident of Kiryat Shemona.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to find someone who is not glad that our soldiers
have come home, the question is whether this will succeed in
bringing peace or instead will bring more war,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Prime Minister Ehud Barak Thursday convened a special session of
the Israeli Parliament in Kiryat Shemona to assure residents that
the state was behind them. Barak's government has promised to give
nearly $400 million to the northern communities for security and
economic development.
</P>
<P>
   The money is certainly needed. Hezbollah's attacks on the north
crippled the local industries, which could not fill orders when
their Israeli workers were in bomb shelters. Now, these industries
have the added problem of losing their Lebanese workers, who used
to cross over every day to work in factories, farms, and in the
tourism sector.
</P>
<P>
   There is also a lot of work still to be done to fortify the
sinuous border that in some communities cuts behind people's
backyards or runs along the narrow roads that wind their way
through the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not sure if I am an optimistic pessimist about the
withdrawal, or a pessimistic optimist,'' Knesset member Tommy
Lapid, from the liberal Shinui Party, told the approximately 100
local residents who attended the Knesset meeting.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problem is that we come here when you have problems to
show support and then we go home and forget, but hopefully this
time, we won't forget you,'' said Lapid.
</P>
<P>
   Many of Kiryat Shemona's 24,000 residents are not waiting around
to see if Barak's government keeps them in mind or maintains peace.
When Israel's proxy Lebanese militia started to collapse last week,
about half of the residents went to stay with friends and relatives
in other parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
   The question is how many will return.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have left Lebanon a long time ago, even before we
entered, but there's no way my family is going to stay here
anymore,'' said Avraham Yosef, a 45-year-old taxi driver who bought
an apartment in Jerusalem three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   He came to Kiryat Shemona 25 years ago, started a family, bought
a house and came to love this small town where everyone knows one
another, the air is clean, and the scenery almost bucolic.
</P>
<P>
   Then there were the Hezbollah attacks that grew in frequency
with each passing year as the rebels gained more support in
southern Lebanon for their fight to oust Israel.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not afraid for myself; it's my children I want to save,''
he said.

HONG KONG FACES LOSS OF LUSTER TO MAINLAND 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also CHINA-TRADE) 
 By MARK LANDLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HONG KONG _ For a city that has prospered as an intermediary
between the Chinese economy and the outside world, Hong Kong has
lobbied hard to help China win full membership in the world's club
of trading nations.
</P>
<P>
   Now the U.S. House of Representatives has voted to give China
permanent normal trade status, bringing normalized trade relations
closer to reality and easing China's accession to the World Trade
Organization. And Hong Kong has to begin facing the consequences of
its successful campaign, one that has been driven at least as much
by politics as by economics.
</P>
<P>
   A China more open to commerce with the outside world, many
experts say, will jeopardize Hong Kong's historic role as a trading
post.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no question that companies are going to do business
directly with China,'' said Robert C. Broadfoot, the managing
director of the Political &AMP; Economic Risk Consultancy here. ``It's
not a question of if, but when, you're going to have shocks to Hong
Kong's role.''
</P>
<P>
   Broadfoot contends that in the long run Hong Kong will benefit
from China's integration into the global economy, because the
overall volume of China-related trade will grow.
</P>
<P>
   But in the short term, China's march into the World Trade
Organization will pose a thorny challenge. As a former British
colony and now a semiautonomous region of China, Hong Kong is a
separate trading entity that already has its own membership in the
WTO.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's stock market reflected this ambivalence, falling
slightly on Thursday while shares in the mainland Chinese cities of
Shanghai and Shenzhen roared ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In 1998, more than $52 billion worth of goods passed through
Hong Kong's port bound for mainland destinations. Broadfoot
estimates that a third of that traffic will disappear after the
United States and other countries start shipping directly to
mainland ports.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise in air travel, Hong Kong could lose its role as a
gateway to China. As part of the WTO negotiations last year between
the United States and China, Beijing agreed to increase the
frequency of commercial flights, which would enable more American
cities to have more direct flights to mainland Chinese cities.
</P>
<P>
   That could hurt Dragonair, a Hong Kong carrier that serves many
mainland cities. It stands to lose Western passengers who fly to
Hong Kong and transfer to planes to popular Chinese destinations
like Xian or Guilin.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's position is further threatened by Taiwan, whose new
president, Chen Shui-bian, has signaled that he is open to
negotiating direct trade links with China. In 1998, Hong Kong's
container port handled nearly $10 billion worth of Taiwanese
exports bound for China. If Taiwan and China were to break down
these barriers, some of that trade would also bypass Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once China gets into the WTO, Taiwan would presumably get into
the WTO soon as well,'' said Eden Woon, director of the Hong Kong
General Chamber of Commerce. ``That means that Taiwan would have to
deal more directly with China.''
</P>
<P>
   With all the troubling implications, why did Woon and other Hong
Kong officials push so energetically for the House to pass the
bill?
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is political. Beijing has made gaining entry
into the trade organization the centerpiece of its economic agenda.
In Hong Kong, where politicians and business leaders try to outdo
each other to be seen as loyal to the motherland, supporting the
trade campaign was a natural.
</P>
<P>
   Even Martin Lee, Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy
leader, traveled to Washington to lobby for the bill. Lee, a
longtime critic of Beijing, said his motives were political rather
than economic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to support the 1.2 billion people of China, not the
Chinese government,'' Lee said. ``I see in this bill a reasonable
possibility that China will change its culture toward observing the
rule of law.''
</P>
<P>
   Other supporters argue that Hong Kong can retain its middleman
role _ with a few tweaks _ as a provider of services to the next
generation of foreign companies that try to get into China. Hong
Kong, with its legions of lawyers, accountants and consultants, is
quite likely to remain a valuable guide for those companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``In order to handle all this trade, China will have to have a
very well-developed service sector,'' said Victor K. Fung, the
chairman of the Hong Kong Trade Development Council and the owner
of a trading firm. ``In the short run, it will be very difficult
for China to ramp up those services.''
</P>
<P>
   But some more old-line Hong Kong industries will have to
redefine themselves. With the United States set to lift import
quotas on Chinese textiles and textile products by 2005, Woon
predicted that many Hong Kong clothing makers would move their
factories to the mainland to take advantage of lower production
costs. Hong Kong, he suggested, could recast itself as a center for
Asian fashion design, rather than a manufacturing center.
</P>
<P>
   China's entry into the trade organization is also quite likely
to deprive Hong Kong of its thriving gray market in goods like oil,
cigarettes and agricultural products. Those are smuggled from
mainland China by the truckload and exported from Hong Kong so that
they will be subject to lower tariffs.
</P>
<P>
   Despite its expected negative effects on some Hong Kong
industries, China's trade campaign has made people here recognize
that their economic fortunes are inextricably tied to the mainland.
It seemed no coincidence that last week Hong Kong announced a $12
billion expansion of its rail system, including a direct link
between central Hong Kong and Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
   Hong Kong's government estimates that China's joining the WTO
would add more than 5 percent to the territory's gross domestic
product over the next decade. It also predicts that investment by
Hong Kong companies in China will explode. Local companies have
already poured in a cumulative $156 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Because Hong Kong and China would retain separate memberships in
the World Trade Organization, officials said Hong Kong would not
necessarily gain access to Chinese markets earlier than other
countries. But business people here are lobbying for special
treatment. Even without it, officials say, Hong Kong will flourish.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not mind if multinational companies go directly to
China,'' the government's chief spokesman, Stephen Lam, said. ``As
long as the pie gets bigger, even if we get a smaller piece, it
will still be more than enough for us.''

 &HT;    CFN, Gateway deal is a dual marketing tool
 &HT;    By Frances Katz
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA - The Consumer Financial Network, a unit of
Atlanta-based iXL Enterprises, has received a $150 million
investment from Gateway Inc., the second-largest direct personal
computer seller.
</P>
<P>
   CFN develops Web sites for corporate intranets that offer
information on employee benefits and a variety of financial
services. Companies use that service to communicate with their
employees. CFN also operates a site for individual users that
offers similar services called Youdecide.com.
</P>
<P>
   Gateway will work with CFN to market its PCs and Internet access
to the companies that use CFN. It hopes to sell its PCs that way
through company-sponsored employee purchase programs.
</P>
<P>
   The transaction is expected to close in June and is subject to
regulatory approval.
</P>
<P>
   For Gateway, the deal is part of its plan to find new ways to
market its products to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks Gray, an analyst at Technology Business Research, told
CNet it's likely that there will be more employer PC deals as
hardware makers continue to seek alternative ways to market their
products.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this investment we have a tremendous marketing partner
for CFN,'' says Bert Ellis, chairman and CEO of iXL. ``It's a very
valuable asset, and it's a great combination of hardware, software
and ISP we can use to go after the corporate portal opportunities
that exist.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal gives Gateway access to 4 million employees who use the
CFN intranet program, and CFN gets access to the Gateway customer
base. ``Together they can bring enterprise portal or
business-to-enterprise solutions corporate environments,'' said
Jonathan Ballon, chief marketing officer of iXL Enterprises.
</P>
<P>
   Ballon says the employee desktop is the last uncharted territory
and Delta Air Lines, American Airlines and Ford Motor Co. have made
commitments to provide PCs to their employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``It lets the company have a relationship with its employees
beyond the office and by bringing in CFN, they have access to CFN
and all of its offerings.''
</P>
<P>
   Ballon says the benefit for iXL is that it validates the
company's initial investment in CFN. ``It's the most mature of our
ventures and the first one out of the nest,'' he says. ``It shows
we know what we are doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase by Gateway will dilute iXL's stake in New
York-based CFN to 48.5 percent from a majority interest previously.

PROSECUTOR FROM NEW YORK TO LEAD CASE AGAINST WEN HO LEE 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES STERNGOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Justice Department announced on Thursday that
it was sending George A. Stamboulidis, a respected prosecutor from
Long Island experienced in mob and public corruption cases, to lead
the prosecution of the scientist accused of illegally downloading
highly sensitive nuclear weapons secrets at the Los Alamos National
Laboratory.
</P>
<P>
   Stamboulidis, who successfully prosecuted a number of mobsters
in the Genovese, Colombo and Luchese crime families, will take over
from Bob Gorence, an assistant U.S. attorney in Albuquerque, where
the scientist, Wen Ho Lee, will be tried. Officials said several
weeks ago that Gorence was being replaced as the lead prosecutor,
but they have not said why. Patricia Chavez, a spokesman for the
U.S. attorney's office in Albuquerque, said only that Gorence would
remain one of the prosecutors on the case.
</P>
<P>
   It is somewhat unusual for the government to switch lead
prosecutors so late in a case. Lee was indicted last December; his
trial, which is expected to be highly complex and involve large
volumes of classified information on thermonuclear weapons
technology, is scheduled for early November.
</P>
<P>
   Lee is charged with improperly downloading a vast quantity of
classified data with the intention of providing it to a third
country. Although he was investigated for years on suspicion of
passing secrets to China, he is not charged with espionage or with
actually handing over any classified data to anyone else. Lee has
denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
   Two important hearings will be held in the coming weeks, and
Lee's lawyers have said they will resist any delays because Lee is
being held in jail without bail.
</P>
<P>
   On June 7 a hearing is scheduled on the defense's challenge of
the original search warrant used to gather evidence from Lee's
home. And the U.S. district judge overseeing the case, John Edwards
Conway, set June 12 as the date for what could prove to be a
crucial hearing in the case: the defense's request that all of the
classified data Lee is accused of improperly downloading be allowed
in the trial.
</P>
<P>
   The defense has said it will try to show that the data was, in
most instances, either already available publicly or useless
without other codes and equipment. The government is expected to
argue that, for national security reasons, the information must be
kept confidential.
</P>
<P>
   If the judge rules that the data is admissible, the government
would have to decide whether to allow its release or potentially to
drop the charges. If the judge denies the request, it could force a
major reconsideration of the defense strategy.

GORE PROPOSES EXPANDING AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS  

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Saying he wanted to provide children with
``more time for learning and less time for trouble,'' Democratic
presidential contender Al Gore on Thursday proposed expanding
after-school programs through a combination of tax credits for
parents and additional federal spending.
</P>
<P>
   Addressing parents, teachers, and community leaders at a YMCA,
the vice president noted that changing family trends, including the
increasing number of households in which both parents work and the
large number of teens who are left unsupervised in the early
evening hours, had increased the pressure on government to provide
some help.
</P>
<P>
   Without parental guidance, he said, ``too many children fall
prey to a culture of chaotic values.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that too many teen-agers do not have anything to do
when school lets out, which can lead to trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``Remember idle hands are the devil's workshop,'' he said.
``There is some wisdom to that.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore noted that a number of boys and girls playing basketball at
the YMCA had told him that if they did not have the after-school
program there, they would be home watching television. He said one
boy said he watched the ``Jerry Springer'' show, which often
features participants talking about their sexual problems.
</P>
<P>
   To encourage more after-school programs such as the ones run by
the YMCA, Gore proposed an $11.3 billion package that includes $5.3
billion in tax credits for parents who enroll their children, ages
13 to 16, in after-school programs. The credit could be for up to
half the cost of the care, depending upon the taxpayer's income.
</P>
<P>
   Parents with children younger than 13 already can qualify for a
child-care tax credit. The new credit for teen-agers would be part
of the $250 billion tax cut Gore is proposing.
</P>
<P>
   The vice president also proposed spending $6 billion to expand
the 21st Century Learning Centers, an existing program that helps
communities set up after-school and summer school programs. The
program serves 850,000 children. The new funding would come from
the $115 billion education plan advocated by Gore.
</P>
<P>
   While Gore advocated government help, he also underscored the
need for parental responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``Government doesn't raise children. Parents do,'' he said. ``No
government program can teach a child right from wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The after-school proposals are part of a broader family values
agenda that the candidate said he will lay out in the coming weeks.
Next week, Gore said, he plans to talk about the role of fathers.
</P>
<P>
   After the YMCA appearance, Gore spoke to state Democratic Party
chairmen from around the nation meeting in Nashville, the capital
city of Gore's home state.
</P>
<P>
   His address to the state leaders came as Gore has slipped
slightly behind Texas Gov. George W. Bush, the Republican
contender, in national polls, and as party officials are
questioning the low-key campaign the vice president has run since
sealing the nomination in March.
</P>
<P>
   But many of the chairmen were at least outwardly unconcerned.

   ``Bush is so new and he's a nice guy, but he's one of those guys
you want to go out and date in college,'' said Molly Beth Malcolm,
Democratic chairwoman from Texas. ``You know you'll have a good
time, but he's not who anybody wants to marry.''

   Chad Curtis was a rabbit, a speedster, when he first broke into
the major leagues with the California Angels. He stole 43 bases as
a rookie in 1992, and was fifth in the American League with 48 the
following season.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the Rangers' outfielder has two steals in four
attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis admits he's not as fast as he used to be. He has added
muscle in the past few years, and is tied for third on the team
with six homers. But he says his lack of steals has at least as
much to do with philosophy as physiology.
</P>
<P>
   He bats in front of Ivan Rodriguez and Rafael Palmeiro, sluggers
who are a threat to hit the ball out of the park every at-bat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got to watch them swing the bat,'' Curtis said. ``I can't
be making outs. If I was hitting lower in the order and the guy
behind me was struggling a little bit, I might see if I can get in
scoring position for him, take a gamble. But you don't need to
gamble with guys like Rodriguez and Palmeiro behind you.''
</P>
<P>
   Change the names and the team, and those words could be echoed
throughout baseball. Why risk stealing when the next guy can hit it
out of the park, at almost every spot in the order?
</P>
<P>
   The increase in home runs throughout baseball this year has been
accompanied by a decrease in stolen bases.
</P>
<P>
   ``The risk-reward factor isn't as high with a stolen base
because you've got guys in the eighth and ninth spot hitting 20
home runs,'' said former Rangers catcher and current Seattle
Mariners broadcaster Dave Valle. ``The stolen base isn't as
important. I don't think managers use it as much as they used to.''
</P>
<P>
   He's right.
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, there were 1.90 attempted steals per game in the
American League and 2.15 in the National League. This year,
attempts are down to 1.71 per game in the AL, 1.77 in the NL.
</P>
<P>
   In both leagues, the home-run leader has a higher total than the
stolen-base leader. In the NL, Mark McGwire has 20 homers, Luis
Castillo 18 steals. In the AL, Jason Giambi has 17 homers, Johnny
Damon 16 steals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was more of a speed game in the National League, but even
that seems like it's changing now with all the power going over
there,'' veteran catcher Joe Oliver said, referring to McGwire and
Ken Griffey Jr. changing leagues in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in steals can be attributed to other factors,
including a dearth of speedsters. AL runners attempted to swipe
2,564 bases in '92, Curtis' rookie year, or 2.26 per game. They
haven't come close to that total since.
</P>
<P>
   ``Me, Kenny Lofton, Pat Listach, a few other guys, all came in
the league at the same time, and we tore it up for a couple of
years,'' Curtis said. ``Everybody started saying, ... `We'd better
start paying attention.' Kenny Lofton still steals them because
he's just that fast. I'm not that fast. I was taking things that
they were giving, and they're not giving them as much anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Mariners infielder Mark McLemore, who stole 25 bases as a rookie
with the Angels in '87, said the slide step, a pitching delivery
with almost no leg kick, is much more prevalent now than when he
broke into the majors. The quicker delivery makes it more difficult
to steal.
</P>
<P>
   ``You see more and more guys going to it,'' McLemore said.
</P>
<P>
   The biggest factor for the decrease in steals, however, appears
to be the reliance on the home run.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, there's only a few guys who steal bases,'' said
Tampa Bay infielder Ozzie Guillen, who stole 36 bases for the
Chicago White Sox in 1989. ``Before, everybody was running. Now,
everybody can hit home runs. If you're the leadoff guy and you
don't get to second base while the No. 2 hitter is up, you're going
to shut it down because the third and the fourth hitters are going
to drive you in.''
</P>
<P>
   There's even less running in Rangers games than there is
league-wide. There were 1.41 attempts in the team's first 44 games.
Rodriguez's presence behind the plate is a huge factor. Only the
very best runners try to steal on the best arm in the game. But the
Rangers don't run much, either. They've attempted 32 steals, only
two more than their opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``What running game?'' Rangers manager Johnny Oates said. ``I've
never believed in running for the sake of running. Certainly, now,
with the way guys are swinging the bat and hitting homers, why take
a chance? You have to look at the percentages. Is this an
out-and-out gamble if we do it, or are the odds in our favor? Who's
the pitcher, who's the catcher, who's the runner? Am I running just
to run, or running to try to win a ballgame? Have I got a better
chance of this guy getting a hit, or this guy stealing a base?''
</P>
<P>
   The answer in Arlington, as well as other locales throughout
baseball, is to let the hitter swing the bat.

MARLON ST. JULIEN'S STAR ON THE RISE AMONG TOP JOCKEYS
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   GRAND PRAIRIE, Texas _ There was no blanket of roses awaiting
Marlon St. Julien after he rode Curule in this year's Kentucky
Derby. Considering the colt and his stablemate China Visit were
long shots at 22-to-1, St. Julien wasn't counting on a trip to the
winner's circle.
</P>
<P>
   But he got the next-best thing when he dismounted from Curule
(pronounced Koo-RULE) after he finished a better-than-expected
seventh in front of horses such as Captain Steve, War Chant, Anees,
The Deputy and High Yield.
</P>
<P>
   Owner Sheik Mohammed al Maktoum and the people who handle Curule
were ``very, very happy,'' St. Julien said. ``They did say, `We'll
be in touch.' That was a plus for me.''
</P>
<P>
   They've been in touch with St. Julien about riding Curule in the
Belmont Stakes on June 10. Curule is listed as a probable for the
race, and the stable's contract rider Frankie Dettori, who rode
China Visit in the Derby, is scheduled to ride in the Epsom Derby
in England the same day as the Belmont. Nothing will be determined,
however, until next week at the earliest.
</P>
<P>
   But St. Julien, 28, thinks it's another positive sign for his
career. Another indicator could come Monday when St. Julien returns
to Lone Star Park at Grand Prairie for Lone Star Million Day. He
was the leading rider at Lone Star in 1997 and '98 before he left
last year to ride the circuit between New Orleans and Kentucky full
time.
</P>
<P>
   But the way his schedule looks for Lone Star Million Day, it's
almost like he never left. There are seven stakes races scheduled
on Monday's card, and St. Julien has promising mounts in at least
three of the races.
</P>
<P>
   He is aboard track-record holder Caro's Royalty in the $100,000
Lone Star Park Turf Sprint; multiple stakes winner Go Lib Go in the
$200,000 USA Stakes, and Oaklawn Park stakes winner Really Polish
in the $200,000 WinStar Distaff. It's possible he will have a ride
in the Grade III Lone Star Park Handicap on Spinelessjellyfish, a
horse based on the West Coast who might be shipped in by trainer
Jenine Sahadi.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been looking forward to coming back to Lone Star even if
it was just to ride in a claiming race,'' St. Julien said. ``I have
family, my aunt and uncle, living there. A lot of friends. It's
pretty much like going home.''
</P>
<P>
   Home for St. Julien originally was Lafayette, La. But he is now
based in Louisville, Ky., where he is in the top five in the jockey
standings at Churchill Downs. Going into this week's races, St.
Julien was in a tie for third at Churchill with Robby Albarado and
Calvin Borel. They were one victory behind Shane Sellers and 14
behind all-time leading Churchill rider Pat Day.
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien has been given the star treatment this year. He has
appeared in prominent ads promoting cellular phone service in the
Louisville area along with Sellers and Albarado.
</P>
<P>
   He also has made contacts that have reached into Canada. Last
weekend, he won a Grade I stakes race at Woodbine Racecourse in
Toronto aboard 3-year-old filly Zoftig.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's easy to sell,'' said former jockey Randy Romero, who
serves as St. Julien's agent. ``He's got a great personality. He
acts the way a jockey should act. I'm getting better just by being
around him.''
</P>
<P>
   Such placement in the community for a black jockey hasn't
happened in decades. St. Julien's ride aboard Curule in the Derby
marked the first time an African-American has ridden in the race in
79 years. The moment was not lost on St. Julien.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just beginning to get educated on the history of horse
racing,'' St. Julien said. ``But I had a lot of time to myself in
the post parade because Curule doesn't have a pony with him before
the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tears came to my eyes. It was a feeling I've never had in
horse racing.''
</P>
<P>
   It looks as though St. Julien will have a chance to get that
feeling again. And it might come through his association with Sheik
Mohammed's Godolphin Stable.
</P>
<P>
   The Sheik has announced plans to become more involved in
American racing. He will send a stable of 2-year-olds from Dubai to
the United States under the supervision of Eoin Harty, a former
assistant to Bob Baffert.
</P>
<P>
   St. Julien has a shot to ride some of those horses. He's made
the contacts. He's an easy sell.

WITH INTANGIBLES, BAYLOR SENIOR BETTER THAN THE AVERAGE BEAR
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By WHIT CANNING 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
 
 
 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   During a particularly rocky stretch early in the season, Baylor
coach Steve Smith decided to bench second baseman Preston Underdown
in favor of freshman Tim Hartshorn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I sat Preston down for 10 games because he didn't seem to be
hitting that well,'' Smith said, ``and it provided a great
opportunity to get Tim some playing time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I noticed, however, that we went 3-7. Gradually, it dawned on
me that Preston is doing some things for us out there that don't
necessarily show up in the boxscore.''
</P>
<P>
   Underdown has been in the lineup since, and will be at second
base tonight at 7 when the top-seeded Bears (45-14) face Southwest
Texas State (33-27) in the first round of the NCAA Regional at the
Baylor Ballpark. Second seed Florida (41-21-1) will face San Jose
State (36-20) in the afternoon game at 2 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A senior from Phoenix who grew up an Arizona State fan,
Underdown arrived at Baylor almost by chance and has, over the past
four years, grown with a program that has become a national power.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always dreamed of being a Sun Devil,'' he said, ``and ASU
showed interest in me coming out of high school. But Baylor invited
me for a visit because they had seen me when they came out there to
look at another shortstop. I came here and I liked what I saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing fancy, but they said they were going to be a winning
program, and that they were building a new stadium. The plans for
that were already in place, and they were very direct about what
they wanted to accomplish, and I decided I want to be part of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a culture shock ... you could say Phoenix and Waco
are at opposite ends of the spectrum ... but now I love it here.''
</P>
<P>
   He has been a teammate of Kip Wells, now in the Chicago White
Sox pitching rotation, and Jason Jennings, the 1999 national player
of the year. Now, he is a senior looking back on a steady climb to
the top ... almost.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was disappointing to go out in the final game of the Super
Regional last year,'' he said. ``Especially when we carried a lead
into the eighth inning. I've thought about the fact that this is my
last chance to get to the College World Series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We lost a lot of talent off that team, and when the season
started I was really wondering how we would respond. This is a
different type team _ we don't hit the long ball much _ but I think
we've got the pitching to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   And the defense. Originally a shortstop, Underdown has proven
himself the quintessential left-side infielder, able to do any job
that needs doing. He has led a nomadic existence between third,
short and second and said, ``As long as it helps the team, I don't
care that much where I play.''
</P>
<P>
   Hitting .291, he is known as a clutch hitter _ he hit .600 at
this juncture last year to help the Bears reach the Super Regional,
and has won games with two-out, ninth-inning home runs. Last year,
he drove in the run that ended a 22-inning game against Houston.
</P>
<P>
   But mostly, he has the glove that never misses.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a coach can specifically remember every error a guy has
made,'' Smith said, ``It's a sign that the guy's having a real good
year.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, Underdown has made four in 244 chances, a .984
percentage. It is becoming clearer to Smith why he put him back in
the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have succeeded,'' he said, beaming proudly, ``despite my
coaching.''

RED BULLET MAY NOT HAVE IT IN HIS BLOOD TO GO BELMONT DISTANCE

<TEXT>
<P>
   It would be understandable to hear the words ``50-50'' coming
out of the mouth of Neil Drysdale. When it comes to a trainer
making plans for the next race, Drysdale's light seems stuck on
``yellow'' for caution.
</P>
<P>
   But now it seems that Drysdale practically has Fusaichi Pegasus
already loaded into the starting gate for the Belmont Stakes in 15
days. And now it's trainer Joe Orseno who's uncommitted regarding
Red Bullet's half of the rematch after he beat up on Fusaichi
Pegasus in the Preakness Stakes. His odds of making the Belmont are
``50-50'' Orseno said.
</P>
<P>
   When the people in the racing office at Belmont Park said they
had received word that Red Bullet would run in the Belmont, Orseno
quickly rebutted. No decision would be made, he said, until he
spoke with Frank Stronach, the owner of the colt.
</P>
<P>
   The reasons for this deliberation aren't obvious. The colt is
reported to have looked fine upon his return to the racetrack for a
brief jog two days ago. His race in the Preakness was visually
impressive.
</P>
<P>
   This one takes some digging. And once you've found what you're
looking for, you can make a hypothesis _ a hypothesis, not a
declaration of fact _ that the owners of Red Bullet know the colt
is suspect at the 11/2 miles of the Belmont.
</P>
<P>
   That's five-sixteenths of a mile longer than the Preakness,
which is a considerable distance in horse racing. These horses have
never raced this far, and likely won't again.
</P>
<P>
   Not only does Stronach own Red Bullet, he owns the colt's dam, a
mare named Cargo. Stronach said he delegates breeding decisions to
his son Andy.
</P>
<P>
   Not withstanding their one breeding to Unbridled four years ago,
which produced Red Bullet, it appears the Stronachs have little
faith that Cargo is the type of mare that will produce horses
capable of winning at the classic distances.
</P>
<P>
   Look at their breeding decisions with Cargo. At first, the
Stronachs tried mating her with stallions known for some endurance,
if not always known for aptitude at classic distances. Cargo
produced a colt by Miswaki, but he hasn't won a race. Then came Red
Bullet, followed by a Meadowlake colt, now a 2-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Before Red Bullet hit the track as a 2-year-old, before they
could see how Unbridled's stamina influence would click through
Cargo, the Stronachs made a drastic switch in their breeding
philosophy with her. They sent her to Lite The Fuse, a winner of
six graded stakes races on the East Coast _ all sprints. And as Red
Bullet began to blossom and began to show he might be a Triple
Crown player early this year, Cargo was sent to Lucky Lionel. He's
a young, unproven stallion by Mt. Livermore who was known for
setting a track record at Santa Anita at 61/2 furlongs.
</P>
<P>
   Lite The Fuse and Lucky Lionel are nice horses, and there's
every reason to believe the resulting foals will be talented
runners. But don't expect them to run very far.
</P>
<P>
   If the Stronachs were gung-ho on Cargo being able to produce
winners of Triple Crown races, they'd keep knocking on the door of
stallions such as Unbridled. In the future, another Mr.
Prospector-line stallion named Fusaichi Pegasus might make a good
match for Cargo.
</P>
<P>
   Those horses could add endurance to Cargo's sprinting
background. Despite the fact that she's by endurance stallion Caro
(he sired '88 Kentucky Derby winner Winning Colors), Cargo never
won past a mile in her racing career. At distances of a mile and
11/16 miles, she went 1-for-6.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, about this information given to jockey Jerry
Bailey that Cargo was a ``freak'' on a wet track: According to the
past performances on file at The Jockey Club, Cargo never raced on
a wet surface.
</P>
<P>
   Her dam, Aerturas, (the second dam of Red Bullet) never raced
past seven furlongs.
</P>
<P>
   Breeding racehorses is a funny business. Some people have bred
for distance and got sprinters. Some horses bred for speed have
been able to carry their turn of foot at the classic distances.
Some horses bred to race on grass had to be switched to the dirt to
win. Remember Cigar?
</P>
<P>
   Breeding is a game of faith. And now, judging by their own
decisions, it appears the Stronachs' faith in Red Bullet going 11/2
miles is shaky. {Tim Price writes a column for the Fort Worth
Star-Telegram.} &QL;

JUBILANT HEZBOLLAH CHIEF LEAVES HIS NEXT MOVE OPEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (With LEBANON, ISRAEL-LEBANON) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ With Israel abruptly gone from southern Lebanon,
the militant Islamic group Hezbollah stands at a crossroads. The
man who straddles it, with the authority to determine what
direction his country and his movement take, is a chubby-cheeked
39-year-old Shiite Muslim cleric named Hassan Nasrallah.
</P>
<P>
   In Beirut on Thursday, as a national holiday was declared to
celebrate the Israeli retreat and as Hezbollah solidified its hold
on liberated villages in the south, the normally reticent Nasrallah
made grandiose pronouncements as if he were commander in chief of a
victorious army after a long campaign _ as many in the Arab world
believe he is. He proclaimed that his fighters had won the only
Arab victory in the 50-year conflict with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   He also received a stream of visitors bearing congratulations _
among them the foreign minister of Iran, Kamal Kharazi _ at his
beat-up Beirut headquarters, and he fielded questions about his
intentions now that Hezbollah's 18-year resistance to Israeli
occupation has paid off.
</P>
<P>
   But Nasrallah, who has made an art form out of ambiguity to keep
both Israel and his rival Lebanese political factions in suspense,
still refused to give anything away.
</P>
<P>
   He repeated what he had said earlier this week _ that Hezbollah
does not consider the withdrawal complete and will not until all
Lebanese prisoners are released from Israeli jails and a small plot
of land called Shebaa Farms near the Golan Heights is vacated by
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, officials have said that a portion of that land was
never part of Lebanon and so does not figure into any withdrawal
plans.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah said the retreat by Israeli soldiers and many of their
allies in the South Lebanon Army was ``an important step.'' But he
would not say whether Hezbollah would give up its military
operations if its further conditions were met.
</P>
<P>
   ``We always said that we weren't going to answer that question
until a complete withdrawal takes place,'' he told journalists
Thursday night. ``I know what should be done, but I won't tell you
because it's a tactical ploy.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor would Nasrallah say whether his militia would lend its arms
to a fight on behalf of Syria to drive Israel out of the Golan
Heights or assist Palestinian extremists who may try to use
southern Lebanon as a launching pad for attacks on Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah _ ``Party of God,'' in Arabic _ has heroic stature in
Lebanon and beyond, and Nasrallah, who has concentrated substantial
religious and political authority in his own hands, has both
options and constraints in deciding which way to take it.
</P>
<P>
   He has been the general secretary of the organization since
1992, when his predecessor, Abbas Musawi, was assassinated by
Israel forces. Under Nasrallah's stewardship, Hezbollah has tried
to recast itself as a national resistance movement, fielding
candidates in parliamentary elections and inviting Sunni Muslims
and Christians to join its ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Trained exclusively in Islamic law and modern weaponry,
Nasrallah has made no secret of his antipathy toward Israel and the
United States. Israel, he has said, is a ``cancerous'' interloper
in the region. His eldest son, Muhammad Hadi, then 18, was killed
in a fight with Israeli soldiers in the security zone in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   But in his intermittent interviews during the past eight years,
he has also tacitly accepted the peace negotiations that both
Lebanon and its overlord, Syria, have entered into with Israel. If
a peace accord is signed, Nasrallah has said, Hezbollah will resist
it as a political party by opposing any normalization of relations
with Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A founding member of Hezbollah, he served as a commander in the
Bekaa region during the 1980s, when the militia effectively ran the
area, enforcing a strictly puritanical Islamic social code. Now
Nasrallah presides over a many-tentacled organization that not only
runs a militia of an estimated 5,000 fighters but manages schools,
hospitals, a television station, two radio stations, construction
crews, an Internet site and a political party with nine seats in
the Lebanese parliament.
</P>
<P>
   The organization is tightly structured but still has its layers
of diverse elements. Many of its veterans fought with radical
Palestinian factions in the civil war and later moved under the
Iranian umbrella after the Palestinians were ejected from Beirut.
Still others came from Amal, the first national movement
representing the traditionally marginalized Shiites. Others are
clerics with loyalties to different factions of Shiite theologians
in Iraq and Iran.
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1960, the son of a grocer from the Bekaa, Nasrallah
attended theological schools in two of the famous centers of Shiite
Muslim learning _ Karbala, in Iraq, and Qum, in Iran _ before
returning to Lebanon in 1982. That year, Israel invaded Lebanon in
an effort to control guerrilla attacks on its northern towns. Also
that year, Iran, flush with the fervor of its 1979 Islamic
revolution, dispatched some 1,000 of its elite Revolutionary Guards
to the Bekaa to train Lebanese Muslims in warfare and, according to
Western intelligence officials, terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   Hezbollah, the fruit of their training mission, operated in
relative secrecy for two years, first proclaiming itself and its
holy war against Israel and the United States in 1984. But the
State Department has accused Hezbollah of being involved or at
least suspected of being involved in the 1983 bombings of the U.S.
Embassy in Beirut, which killed 63 people, and the Marine barracks
in Beirut, which killed 241. The group later expanded its
operations to kidnapping Americans and Europeans in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
   Nasrallah has denied that the group participated in the
bombings, but was quoted last month in an Arabic magazine as saying
he wished that it had, because ``that would have been a great
honor.''
</P>
<P>
   Israeli analysts see Nasrallah as the political, rather than
military, mastermind of Hezbollah, adept at navigating between the
often rival ambitions of the group's main patrons, Iran and Syria,
and just as nimble at adjusting to shifts in their policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows how to integrate the pragmatic and the ideological,''
said Shimon Shapira, a military adviser to Benjamin Netanyahu, the
former Israeli prime minister, and the author of a book on
Hezbollah.
</P>
<P>
   That attribute was on display in Nasrallah's statements on
Thursday. He the time is not yet right for Hezbollah to demand a
bigger share of political power in Lebanon or even to try to
capitalize on its current popularity to win a bigger bloc of seats
in parliamentary elections in August. ``It's important after a
victory to maintain internal unity,'' he said. ``So we would rather
keep the same number of seats.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Hezbollah can be modest politically, as well as in every
other way,'' he added with a smile.

TEXAS MOTOR SPEEDWAY SEEN AS KEY TO IRL GROWTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOHN STURBIN 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ Indy Racing League founder Tony George envisions
Texas Motor Speedway in Fort Worth as the foundation of a series
schedule that could expand to as many as 15 events in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   George said Thursday he and Eddie Gossage, the executive vice
president and general manager of TMS, have signed a sanctioning
agreement replacing the three-year deal that expired last year. The
multiyear contract provides for TMS to retain its two dates in the
same June/October slots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're OK with Texas. There is an agreement and we've worked
through all the issues,'' George said before the start of
Carburetion Day activities at the Indianapolis Motor Speedway, site
of Sunday's Indianapolis 500. ``We would love for them (TMS) to
continue in that role as the first race after the 500.''
</P>
<P>
   The IRL's Casino Magic 500 is scheduled June 10 at TMS.
</P>
<P>
   Gossage also campaigned for and secured the league's
season-finale beginning in October 1999, when Greg Ray of Plano
clinched the driver's championship. The current season will end in
Fort Worth with the Mall.com 500 on Oct. 15.
</P>
<P>
   Backed by 84 years of history and tradition, the Indianapolis
500 remains the cornerstone of the renamed Indy Racing Northern
Light Series. But TMS has emerged as the second-most popular venue
on the schedule, which was reduced to nine races this season. The
1.5-mile TMS quadoval played host to the series' inaugural night
race in June 1997, and has been the first event run after the Indy
500 since.
</P>
<P>
   TMS gives the IRL, in its fifth season, another race to build
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``They've established something of a tradition,'' George said of
Gossage and the TMS staff. ``We're looking to trying to establish
more of our events on a traditional (basis) and create some
continuity. One of the things we've lacked the last three or four
years is continuity.''
</P>
<P>
   Gossage said he and George came to terms on the new contract
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony may have signed it, but I haven't gotten it yet,''
Gossage said from Fort Worth. ``It was a real easy negotiation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've agreed to run the IRL and plan to have a formal
announcement about the particulars on race weekend. It'll be two
stops here for several years. It's an important part of our
schedule. We think it's a great, great series. What's happened at
Indy this month shows this is a strong, viable series on its own.
I'd love to have a CART race here, too. But the IRL has been great
for us.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first race after Indy makes that special. The Casino Magic
500 traditionally draws the biggest open-wheel crowd outside of the
Indy 500. We're very proud of that. And the season-finale makes
that a real happening as well. We're going to build on those
things.''
</P>
<P>
   The league was aiming for a 10-race schedule this season, but a
``TBA'' date scheduled for Sept. 10 was deleted this spring. The
league will visit the new Kentucky Speedway at Sparta, Ky., for the
first time on Aug. 27. George announced this month that the IRL
will race at the Kansas Speedway in Kansas City, Kan., on July 8,
2001, and at the Chicagoland Speedway in Joliet, Ill, on Sept. 2,
2001.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got about eight races firm that we know will be part of
the (2001) schedule,'' George said, ``and about six or seven others
in play. Any number of those six or seven may turn out to be firm
in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had Midwest races in the past on the schedule,
other than Indianapolis. We're looking forward to going to Illinois
and Kansas City, and we'll continue to look for other opportunities
in the Midwest and other areas.''
</P>
<P>
   George said the possibility of including an IRL race during the
annual SpeedWeeks festivities at the Daytona International Speedway
in Florida in February has been discussed with officials of
International Speedway Corp. Such an agreement would put the IRL's
single-seat, open-wheel cars, which reach speeds in excess of 220
mph on the relatively flat 2.5-mile Indianapolis Motor Speedway, on
the even faster 33-degree banked turns of the 2.5-mile Daytona
track.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not there yet (at Daytona),'' George said. ``I think we
can run about anywhere we want, safely.''
</P>
<P>
   George said the league's annual season-opener at the Walt Disney
World Speedway in Orlando, Fla., is in jeopardy because of
scheduling conflicts at the resort. But George said four tracks on
the 1999 Championship Auto Racing Teams' schedule _ The Milwaukee
Mile, Michigan Speedway, California Speedway and Gateway
International Raceway outside St. Louis _ are being scouted by the
IRL. nn

<P>
   The Justice Department approved AT&AMP;T's proposed $58 billion
acquisition of MediaOne Group, giving the telephone giant control
over more than a third of the nation's cable network for
television, high-speed Internet access and online telephone
service. The decision requires the companies to sell their interest
in Road Runner, the nation's second-largest cable Internet service.
The companies now await a decision by the Federal Communications

<P>
   Fueled by favorable demographic trends, strong consumer demand
and a robust economy, the assisted-living industry was supposed to
be mounting record profits this year while expanding rapidly and
reaching new stock market peaks. That, at least, is what analysts
were predicting three years ago.
</P>
<P>
   It has not exactly worked out that way. One publicly traded
company _ Grand Court Lifestyles Inc., in Boca Raton, Fla. _ filed
for bankruptcy protection in March. Several others are under
financial strain, and all have seen their shares recently plunge to
record lows.
</P>
<P>
   New construction has virtually stopped. The Alterra Healthcare
Corp. of Milwaukee, the nation's largest assisted-living operator,
has abandoned plans to build 100 new homes. Last year, the
industry's publicly traded companies, which account for 10 percent
of the homes, lost 68 percent of their value, according to Philip
J. Martin, an analyst with First Union Securities.
</P>
<P>
   How could this happen?
</P>
<P>
   The answer is a binge of overinvestment and overbuilding, with
too many companies and people trying to seize a trend. The elderly,
after all, are the fastest-growing segment of the population; the
number of Americans who are 85 or older is expected to increase by
one-third in the next decade, to about six million.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the elderly dread the prospect of being confined to the
hospital-like setting of a nursing home. Privately paid assisted
living is viewed as an appealing alternative for people who need
some help but do not require skilled nursing. Residents have their
own apartments with kitchens, eating communally and taking part in
social activities only when they want to. Public areas are designed
to evoke the atmosphere of a comfortable hotel rather than an
institution.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in senior housing say the industry's poor financial
performance has not discredited assisted living _ any more than the
slide in dot-com stocks has undermined the Internet. They blame the
gold-rush fever that led several companies to grow too fast and to
use creative (though perfectly legal) accounting methods to hide
their losses.
</P>
<P>
   The concept of assisted living has existed for about two
decades, but as recently as 1994, the industry had only two
publicly traded companies. As capital became widely available,
about 20 more public offerings followed, including some for
companies operating both nursing homes and assisted-living
apartments. That resulted in pressure to produce quick increases in
earnings.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to nursing homes, assisted-living homes had few
regulatory barriers. That also contributed to new residences going
up hastily. But many companies did not anticipate how long it would
take to fill their buildings with people. The costs are beyond many
people's means, with monthly fees starting at about $3,000 and
climbing, depending on the services needed, with medical care
usually extra. Also, many elderly people are reluctant to give up
their independence.
</P>
<P>
   Some companies failed to foresee that they would be serving an
increasingly older, and therefore, more frail clientele (the
average age is now 84), forcing them to hire additional employees,
which cut into profits. ``There wasn't a lot of discipline on the
part of the companies,'' said Christos Kuliopoulos, a senior
consultant at Ernst &AMP; Young who specializes in senior housing.
``They weren't doing their due diligence.''
</P>
<P>
   So, the building boom has tapered off. The 164 homes now under
construction are just a third as many as were completed in 1998.
There are about 7,000 professionally run homes nationwide, with
about 520,000 units, according to the American Seniors Housing
Association in Fairfax, Va.
</P>
<P>
   During the building boom, many markets quickly became saturated,
prompting several states to require certificates of need before a
home could be built. North Carolina has declared a moratorium on
new construction, an action that backfired when many companies
rushed into the state to beat the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence in the industry was also shaken when many companies
chose to engage in so-called off-balance-sheet financing. Abraham
Gosman, the chairman of the CareMatrix Corp., a publicly traded
company based in Needham, Mass., used a private but wholly owned
company, the Chancellor Senior Housing Group, to buy property and
absorb start-up losses. Chancellor paid CareMatrix a fee for
developing the homes and running them in the early stages. As the
homes filled up, CareMatrix would either lease them or buy them
back.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were moving money from one pocket to another pocket,''
said James J. Kumpel, an analyst at Raymond James &AMP; Associates, who
called attention to this financing arrangement at several
companies. ``It was a cynical financing vehicle to promote
hypergrowth in what is generally not a hypergrowth industry.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Louise T. Major, director of investor relations for
CareMatrix, said this type of financing has been standard in the
hotel industry for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of the industry's problems have been of its own making.
Changes in Medicare reimbursement methods for nursing homes also
affected the prices of assisted-living stocks, because many
investors are unable to distinguish among various forms of senior
housing, analysts say. Last year, the stocks tumbled after an
analyst reported _ incorrectly, as it turned out _ that the
Government Accounting Office was about to recommend that assisted
living come under federal regulation.
</P>
<P>
   The industry is generally not opposed to regulations (it is
easier to market government-certified homes), but it prefers to
have them imposed by state lawmakers, who are easier to lobby.
</P>
<P>
   As the industry faltered, even the better-managed companies saw
their shares drop precipitously. These included Sunrise Assisted
Living, Brookdale Living Communities and the American Retirement
Corp. The granddaddy of assisted living, Sunrise, based in Fairfax,
Va., opened its first home in 1981 and now has 148 homes in 23
states and one in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   Companies like these own their real estate, choose their
locations carefully, usually in densely populated areas, and focus
on their operations, said Kathryn A. Sweeney, a vice president at
AEW Capital Management, a Boston company that invests in privately
held assisted-living companies. ``Those firms that succeed as good
operators will live in this business,'' she said. ``Those that
entered the business as real estate developers _ for opportunistic
reasons _ will not.''
</P>
<P>
   For these reasons, a shakeout could benefit consumers in the
long run. It would force companies to shift their attention from
development to management, said Don Redfoot, a senior policy
adviser to AARP.
</P>
<P>
   But for now, families may want to exercise an extra measure of
caution when choosing a home. ``The intense pressure to show profit
margins created enormous pressures to keep staffing to a minimum,''
Redfoot said. ``You want to make sure that the place is adequately
staffed.'' &QL;

SELIG SAYS REALIGNMENT NOT IN PERIL (For use by NYTimes News
Service clients) 
By SIMON GONZALEZ 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Baseball commissioner Bud Selig said the decision to delay the
owners' meetings scheduled for June was to allow more time to work
on scheduling scenarios, and not a sign that his realignment plan
is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If so, that means the Rangers still would move from the American
League West to the Central next season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're working on the same plan at this point,'' Selig said.
``There's no snags at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Team owners tentatively were scheduled to meet June 13-14, when
they would vote on realignment for next season. Selig's plan would
shift the Rangers from the West to the Central, the Arizona
Diamondbacks from the National League West to the AL West and the
Tampa Bay Devil Rays from the AL East to the NL.
</P>
<P>
   The most likely scenario has four divisions of four teams each
without a wild-card playoff entry in the NL, and two four-team
divisions plus a six-team Central in the AL, which would have a
wild card.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have said the plan is unwieldy because of the different
number of divisions in the leagues, the wild card in one league and
not the other, and because it might be more difficult to make the
playoffs from the six-team AL Central.
</P>
<P>
   Those critics include the players' union, which has the right to
approve major changes in the structure of Major League Baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Selig, though, said his goal is to go to an unbalanced schedule,
and realignment is the best way to accomplish it.
</P>
<P>
   However, he said that devising a schedule that works for most of
the teams is taking time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are working on a series of options so that when we finally
come forth with a plan that we think produces the best schedule, we
will be able to say to everybody we've run every other
alternative,'' Selig said. ``That's the only reason the meeting was
delayed. We can't produce a schedule that pleases all 30 clubs. I'm
trying to do one that pleases as many as possible and is the right
schedule. We're testing every conceivable structure for a schedule,
and that's what is taking the time right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Selig said he hopes to have an owners meeting in early-to-mid
July. nn

PATIENTS' RIGHTS COMPROMISE FOUNDERS IN JOINT COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>
   By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The outlook for legislation defining patients'
rights turned bleak Thursday as House and Senate negotiators issued
an unusually negative report on their efforts to strike a
compromise.
</P>
<P>
   ``These talks are stalled,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy,
D-Mass., as he walked out of a conference committee meeting
Thursday evening. Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, said, ``We are making
zero progress.''
</P>
<P>
   A senior Republican negotiator, Rep. Bill Thomas of California,
said that ``it's going to be very difficult'' to reconcile the
bills passed by the Senate last July and by the House in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's akin to mating a chihuahua with a Great Dane,'' Thomas
said.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas and other lawmakers said part of the problem was that
House and Senate Republicans had not reached complete agreement
among themselves on several major issues. For example, Thomas said
that ``we agree to disagree'' on the number of people who should be
protected by any new federal standards for health insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Many provisions of the House bill would apply to more than 165
million Americans, about three times the number covered by
comparable provisions of the Senate bill.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Don Nickles, R-Okla., who is chairman of the conference
committee, said, ``Most people would say the chances of success are
not great, but we've worked very hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's meeting included 13 members of Congress and lasted
about 75 minutes. Much of the time was spent discussing whether
patients should have new rights to sue health insurance plans for
injuries caused by the denial of care. Republicans repeatedly
insisted that Congress must not impose any new legal liability on
employers who sponsor health plans for their employees. Democrats
complained that Republicans seemed to be worrying more about
employers than patients.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spent one hour in there, and I did not hear the word
`patients' mentioned once,'' said Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV,
D-W.Va. ``Everything is about one tiny section of the bill''
dealing with the liability of employers.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress said that there was no agenda for Thursday's
meeting, and that lawmakers gave no instructions to staff members
about what to do next week, when Congress is in recess. The recess
began Thursday evening, with both houses of Congress scheduled to
reconvene on June 6.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans said it was still possible that the pace of
negotiations could pick up after Congress reconvenes. Rep. Charlie
Norwood, R-Ga., who supports the same bill favored by many
Democrats, said he was losing patience with the conference
committee and was seeking other ways to move a bill through
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't get a bill, or at least a tentative agreement in
writing by the week we come back from Memorial Day, we must move
past the conference,'' Norwood said. ``I am willing to pass this
measure through any legal means that may be necessary.'' He did not
give details.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Kennedy said, ``We've got other options.'' He said
Democrats could offer their proposals on the Senate floor as
amendments to other legislation.

COWBOYS' REESE CHANGES OUTLOOK AFTER NECK INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Safety Izell Reese shakes his head as he looks
around the Dallas Cowboys locker room at the carefree, cocksure
rookies, who see themselves as invincible and believing they will
play forever.
</P>
<P>
   He remembers when that was his attitude.
</P>
<P>
   As an unheralded sixth-round pick from Alabama-Birmingham two
years ago, Reese caught the Cowboys' attention with his play on
special teams and was tabbed as the team's free safety of the
future.
</P>
<P>
   Veteran safety George Teague won the starting job last season,
but it was considered only a matter of time before the youthful
Reese claimed a permanent place in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Those days seem long ago to Reese, 24.
</P>
<P>
   A bulging disk, which sidelined him for the final eight games of
the 1999 season and required Daryl Johnston-like neck fusion
surgery on Jan. 4, has put his career in jeopardy.
</P>
<P>
   Reese's goal now is to just play again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel good,'' Reese said. ``I'm not having any problems and
it's not bothering me from moving. The real test is when I start
having real contact. That won't be until training camp. I'm just
taking it one day at a time.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Johnston, though he returned from 1997 neck surgery to
play in 1998, is being forced out of the game because of more neck
problems last season, the Cowboys are taking a wait-and-see
approach with Reese.
</P>
<P>
   According to the team's trainers, he has responded well from the
surgery and is on schedule with his rehabilitation. After
participating in only limited drills during the first minicamp and
quarterback school, Reese went through all the workouts with the
team during the recent four-day quarterback school, which ended
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   It's expected that a healthy Reese would stabilize the Cowboys'
questionable safety situation. Excluding Reese, the players behind
starters Darren Woodson and Teague range between young and
inexperienced.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Kaiser, Chris Akins, Sean Key, Jasmine Tramel and Beau
Morgan have no NFL starts and a combined total of three NFL seasons
to their credit.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys coach Dave Campo, however, said he wants to see how
Reese reacts mentally and physically to contact in training camp
before considering him part of the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Reese understands the uncertainty. Heck, he has had doubts
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston's and Michael Irvin's situations haven't helped,
either. Irvin is expected to retire this off-season because of neck
problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been scary from the beginning,'' Reese said. ``I knew
before the surgery that I might not be able to play again. I knew
there was a chance my career could be over. It really got
depressing after the surgery. I sat in my house with that neck
brace on for almost two months doing nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese said conversations with Johnston and Irvin helped him get
out of the doldrums. He said Johnston, who had the same surgery
three years ago, has been very supportive.
</P>
<P>
   Reese is also buoyed by the fact that his injury was not as
serious as Johnston's and that it was diagnosed early in his
career.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing that was positive for me is that I am young,'' Reese
said. ``My body has recuperated well from the surgery. I feel good
now. I'm healthy. I actually feel better now than I did before the
surgery. It's still scary. But I'm confident I can make it back.''
</P>
<P>
   Reese's confidence is rooted in the knowledge of how far he has
come. He walks in his closet and looks at the neck brace every day
as a reminder of what he has gone through.
</P>
<P>
   But whether he makes it back or not, he said he has been altered
by his experience and hopes it can serve as a lesson for others.
</P>
<P>
   ``When something like that happens, you realize you have taken a
lot for granted,'' Reese said. ``You learn to appreciate the simple
stuff about life and health, not just football. That's what I try
to tell these rookies coming in. It's easy to take a lot of stuff
for granted. You have to make the most of every moment. Situations
like this make you aware of a lot things. That's what it did for
me.'' nn

HOW THE HARD-DRIVING GOP GAVE CLINTON A TRADE VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
   By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When Rep. Tom DeLay came to work on Wednesday, he
was still a vote or two shy of the bare-minimum 150 Republicans he
needed to help push the China trade bill over the top.
</P>
<P>
   DeLay, the Republican whip, lined up lots of help. Gov. George
W. Bush of Texas was recruited to cajole several wavering
Republicans. So was Gen. Colin Powell. Dozens of pro-trade
lobbyists and corporate chieftains fanned out on Capitol Hill to
buttonhole the last dozen or so undeclared members for what both
camps predicted would be a nail-biter.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next crucial hours, those calls and an array of other
influences paid off, as virtually every undeclared Republican, and
even a few others who had been written off, broke DeLay's way. In
all, 164 Republicans joined 73 Democrats to grant China permanent
normal trading status, wiping out economic restrictions rooted in
Cold-War policy for a quarter century.
</P>
<P>
   ``Frankly, they surprised me a little bit,'' said DeLay, whose
bare-knuckle approach to head-counting has earned him the nickname
``The Hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Members in the last few hours really turned around and
understood how important this was,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   The bill now goes to the Senate, where some critics were already
preparing amendments that could upset the delicately crafted
measure.
</P>
<P>
   Normalizing trade with China was a victory for the Clinton
administration, but House Republicans had their own reasons for
voting three-to-one in favor of the bill. Passage insured that
Republicans' corporate benefactors would fully benefit from a
market-opening accord Washington and Beijing negotiated that
slashes Chinese tariffs on a wide range of farm and industrial
products and removes some barriers to American service providers,
like banks and telecommunications companies.
</P>
<P>
   The House Republican leadership closed ranks behind the bill,
which is usually enough to guarantee victory. But they needed to
produce two-thirds of the yes votes, and had a tough sell with many
Republicans who balked at rewarding a trade plum to a Communist
government that they say persecutes religious minorities and
represses its own citizens.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was nothing simple about this,'' said Rep. Bob Schaffer
of Colorado, one of the last conservative Republicans to climb down
off the fence in favor. ``The 51 percent of this bill that's good
only barely outweighs the 49 percent that is truly deplorable.''
</P>
<P>
   Republican leaders said a number of factors helped sway
undeclared members in the final days and hours to provide the
unexpectedly large margin of victory. An amendment creating a
commission to monitor human rights in China won half a dozen
Republicans and many more Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans lined up Chinese dissidents who said that the bill
would improve the rights of religious minorities, arguing that
persecution cannot survive the advent of the Internet. Rep. David
Dreier of California, a chief Republican supporter, enlisted Billy
Graham, the Protestant evangelist, to endorse the measure.
</P>
<P>
   Two dozen Republicans with national security concerns were
steered to Powell or Rep. Porter Goss, a Florida Republican who
heads the House Intelligence Committee, for reassurance that
engaging China would likely undermine the Communist government. ``I
told them, the more open a society the better opportunity we have
of getting results,'' said Goss.
</P>
<P>
   Many members cited increased trade and national security
benefits as reasons to vote yes. These broader merits, combined
with the home-district considerations, collectively sealed the
decisions of many borderline supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key factor for me was that this was the last best hope to
save family farms in middle and eastern Tennessee,'' said Rep. Van
Hilleary of Tennessee, who said Europe's agreement with China last
week on Beijing's entry into the World Trade Organization also
convinced him that U.S. jobs were at stake.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a few members who were leaning yes needed a touch of
outside help to reach their decision. Bush, the presumptive
Republican presidential nominee, spoke to a handful of Republicans,
including Rep. Ernie Fletcher of Kentucky, who was impressed by Mr.
Bush's commitment to improving human rights in China.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Christopher Cox, a California Republican and outspoken
critic of China, endorsed the measure after provisions in the human
rights commission were strengthened. Rep. Elton Gallegly, R-Calif.,
said backing the bill was easier after he spoke to Agriculture
Secretary Dan Glickman about keeping a ban an Argentine oranges
which could introduce a citrus-killing insect into southern
California orchards.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Spencer Bachus, an Alabama Republican with steel mills in
his district, voted in favor after Republican leaders agreed to
amend a separate spending bill to address his concerns about
imported coke, which is used in steel-processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always sensitive to our members' needs,'' said Susan B.
Hirschmann, DeLay's chief of staff.
</P>
<P>
   By the roll call, all but a handful of the 15 or so Republicans
who started the day on the leaders' lists as undecided voted yes.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been counting votes for a long, long time and never in my
life have I seen that many undecideds break in favor of a
position,'' said Nick Calio, a bill supporter who was former
President George Bush's top lobbyist on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   The China bill's 40-vote margin of victory in the House,
237-197, would seem to give it unstoppable momentum as the
legislation now moves to the Senate for consideration, probably
next month. Passage in the Senate, which is usually considered more
pro-trade and internationalist, had appeared more certain.
</P>
<P>
   But lurking in the Senate are critics like Jesse Helms, the
North Carolina Republican who heads the Foreign Relations
Committee. Helms, a fierce foe of the Beijing government, said
after the House vote that he would not allow the Senate ``to simply
rubber-stamp the president's plan to reward the Chinese
Communists.''
</P>
<P>
   Opponents do not have the votes in the Senate to kill the House
bill, but amending it _ the right of any senator _ would force
House and Senate negotiators to hammer out a compromise of the
competing chambers' bills. The House would then have to cast a
second vote on the revised bill.
</P>
<P>
   Supporters vowed today to push for speedy Senate passage of a
clean House bill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be efforts to derail this by using amendments and
other parliamentary means,'' said Sen. Chuck Hagel, a Nebraska
Republican who supports the measure. ``But we have to keep this
moving.''

LAKERS LOOK BACK ON FEB. 29 WIN IN PORTLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore.  &UR; _ &LR;  Eighty-seven days and thirty-seven games and
a half-dozen fascinating plot twists later, the NBA's most enduring
story line of the season returns to where it all began.
</P>
<P>
   Back to the Rose Garden. Back to the scene of what Lakers coach
Phil Jackson called the biggest regular-season event ``in my
history of the game, in 33 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Hyperbole like that is difficult to top. Tonight's Rose reunion
between the Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers won't need the extra
hype. It lacks some of the drama of the Feb. 29 showdown between
these teams, and yet, is infinitely more important.
</P>
<P>
   The Western Conference finals are tied 1-1, and the Lakers have
lost what they gained here nearly three months ago: home-court
advantage in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers' 90-87, leap-day victory broke a tie atop the NBA
standings and propelled them to the league's best record. To regain
home-court advantage, and the mental edge in this series, the
Lakers must win tonight or Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   And their greatest ally is that Feb. 29 game, which qualified as
a must-win at the time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anytime you can look back and remember a positive experience,
it can give you confidence,'' said Derek Fisher. ``And even though
it was forever ago, I think we can kind of draw from that and
remember: that in a hostile environment, in a close basketball
game, against this same basketball team, we went up there and got a
win.''
</P>
<P>
   As Jackson made clear at the time, it would be no ordinary
victory.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and Blazers were tied atop the NBA with matching
45-11 records, and each team was riding an 11-game winning streak.
They had chased each other around the Pacific Division for four
months, neither able to establish absolute supremacy.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson presciently opined that the winner would eventually
claim the division, and probably much more. He was, we know now,
absolutely right.
</P>
<P>
   Starting with that victory, the Lakers went 22-4 to finish out
the season. The Blazers went 14-12, unable to reestablish their
dominance until the playoffs began.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt really comfortable with what our game plan was,''
Jackson said of the Feb. 29 showdown, ``how we played the game,
knowing what we wanted to do and operating in the style of game we
wanted to play at.''
</P>
<P>
   So they're back now where they began, literally and
figuratively.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like we have to prove anything to ourselves, because
we've done it before,'' Kobe Bryant said. ``We went up there in a
tight situation and beat them up there on their home floor, so we
know that we can do it. It's just a matter of doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Lakers have not shown the road warrior mentality that
carried them before. After posting a 31-10 road record in the
regular season, they have slipped to 1-3 in the playoffs. They
failed to win two potential closeout games at Sacramento and
another at Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well we won (Game 3) up in Phoenix in a great manner, and then
we kind of laid back (in Game 4),'' John Salley said. ``This is the
third round. Nothing before this really matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Lakers need to regain the edge that pushed them
through those 4-0 and 6-0 road trips during the regular season.
And, as on Feb. 29,they once again are faced with proving their
superiority over the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was a situation where we wanted that game really
bad,'' Fisher recalled. ``I think we accepted the challenge that
was placed on us, not only by them, but by other people. I think at
that time of the season, a lot of people felt like they were a
better basketball team than us. And I think we really felt like if
we could go up there and get a win, it would not only silence other
people, but it would give us more confidence, and we continued to
just play tremendous basketball after that.
</P>
<P>
   ``So we're kind of in that same siuation again, where people are
starting to question our abilities as a basketball team. And we can
go up there and silence those people.''

SHUTTLE CREW `READY TO WRAP THIS UP' AT SPACE STATION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By MARK CARREAU 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ The Atlantis astronauts gave the international space
station a final nudge to a higher altitude on Thursday and prepared
to depart the rejuvenated orbital outpost.
</P>
<P>
   The shuttle crew docked with the uninhabited, two-room station
earlier this week to overhaul a faltering electrical power system
and make other refurbishments to prepare it for the overdue arrival
of the Russian crew module in July.
</P>
<P>
   The Atlantis crew plans to depart the station Friday at 6:07
p.m. CDT, each of its tasks successfully executed. The astronauts
are scheduled to land at 1:18 a.m. CDT Monday at the Kennedy Space
Center in Florida.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're ready to wrap this up,'' said astronaut Jeff Williams.
</P>
<P>
   The station has towered nearly 80 feet above an airlock in the
shuttle's cargo bay since the two spacecraft linked Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Late Thursday, Atlantis commander Jim Halsell and pilot Scott
``Doc'' Horowitz fired the shuttle's steering thrusters to gently
boost the station to an altitude of 234 miles, an increase of 10
miles. Combined with similar maneuvers Wednesday and Tuesday, the
station circled nearly 28 miles higher than when the astronauts
arrived.
</P>
<P>
   The station has been losing one mile to two miles per week in
recent months because of a temporary increase in solar activity.
The increase causes the Earth's atmosphere to balloon to new
heights, creating new frictional drag on orbiting satellites.
</P>
<P>
   For several hours Thursday, it appeared the shuttle crew might
have to extend its stay to correct what appeared to be a problem
with a new storage battery. It had been installed in the station's
Russian segment as part of the power system overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   However, experts in Russia traced the difficulty to ground
circuitry, clearing the way for the five-man, two-woman shuttle
crew to conclude their visit Friday night, as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Late last year, the station's six power storage batteries began
to falter prematurely because of an overly aggressive charging
procedure at the Russian ground control facility.
</P>
<P>
   Four new batteries were installed by the Atlantis crew.
</P>
<P>
   At least three batteries are necessary for the addition of the
crew module in July. Russian economic and rocket problems have
stalled the large module's development and launching by more than
two years, slowing the addition of other components.
</P>
<P>
   During their visit, the shuttle astronauts also repaired an
American external cargo crane and replaced a faulty NASA
communications antenna.
</P>
<P>
   The astronauts enhanced the air ventilation system, installed
new smoke detectors and fire extinguishers and transferred exercise
equipment, computers, food, water and clothing.
</P>
<P>
   All of the gear will be in place as the first resident
astronauts and cosmonauts begin to arrive in November.
</P>
<P>
   However, should the crew module experience further delays, the
repairs made by the Atlantis crew should keep the station safely
orbiting until astronauts can return.
</P>
<P>
   The United States serves as the managing partner for a 16-nation
consortium involved in the assembly of the international station.
</P>
<P>
   The first components, a Russian propulsion, power and guidance
module and a smaller American one with ports to interlink a
half-dozen other modules, were coupled in Earth orbit in December
1998.
</P>
<P>
   The partnership envisions a sprawling state-of-the-art orbiting
laboratory for research in physics, biology and medicine when the
station is fully assembled in late 2005.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was just past closing time at the Wendy's on Main
Street in Flushing, Queens. Two men, one short and one tall,
knocked at the locked front door, calling out for the manager by
name.
</P>
<P>
   The manager, 27-year-old Jean Dumel Auguste, seemed to know the
men, and he led at least one of them down to the store basement
where he kept a small office near the employee changing rooms and a
large walk-in refrigerator-freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, Auguste used the store's intercom system to
summon his small night crew down into the basement for a meeting.
Six employees made their way down the back stairs into the cool,
musty basement.
</P>
<P>
   It was a death trap.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, on one of the busiest strips in Queens, a
massacre began to unfold _ a crime so grisly, so ruthless that it
left some of the city's most experienced homicide investigators
sickened. When it was over Wednesday night, all seven employees had
been shot, all of them at close range, all in the head. Five were
killed, including Auguste. A sixth was fighting for his life
Thursday night, and the seventh survived, his cheeks pierced by a
bullet hole.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most horrendous crime scene I've ever witnessed in
my nine years as district attorney of this county, and as people
know, I've been to a lot of crime scenes,'' Richard Brown, the
Queens district attorney, said Thursday, as hundreds of police
officers hunted the city for two suspects, and as relatives,
stricken with shock and grief, gathered at a nearby Sheraton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the crime appeared to have been carefully
planned and timed, and they focused their initial investigation on
former Wendy's employees. Indeed, customers said that in the
moments before the restaurant's closing time, there was no hint at
all of what was to come.
</P>
<P>
   A young couple sat at a front table, quietly finishing their
food. One employee went about emptying trash bins. Others were
wiping down tables and counters. At 10:55 p.m., a regular walked in
and ordered one of the night's last meals, a junior bacon
cheeseburger, a baked potato with sour cream and chives and a
salad.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 p.m., the store was empty but for seven employees, and the
front door was locked. In the most haunting disclosure,
investigators said that a passing police officer tried to stop in
for a hamburger shortly after closing time but was shooed away. A
senior police official said the officer reported that he was waved
away by a man and a woman standing at the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's very possible that could have been the robber
standing there with the female,'' the official said. ``The cop
tells us there is a guy and a girl standing at the door saying
we're closed. His sense was they seemed friendly. But could he have
been standing there with a gun at her back? It's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in the basement, the employees _ Ramon Nazario, 44; Anita
C. Smith, 23; Jeremy Mele, 18, Ali Ibadat, 40; Patrick Castro, 23,
and Jaquione Johnson, 18 _ were quickly subdued at gunpoint, police
officials said. The gunmen used duct tape to bind hands behind
backs and gag mouths. At some point, plastic bags were slipped over
the heads of all seven employees, and they were forced into the
large walk-in unit that combines a refrigerator section and freezer
section. And then they began to shoot, apparently determined to
leave no witnesses to their theft of as much as $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday night how the men made their getaway.
Police officials said they believed that the two men might have
slipped out a side door after stealing the manager's keys. But a
woman at a nearby bus stop also told the police she saw two men
leave from the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 90 minutes or so, two of the wounded, Castro and
Johnson, worked themselves free. Castro called 911 from a basement
telephone connected to the fax machine in the manager's office.
``We're in the basement,'' he managed to say, despite the bullet
wound to his cheeks. ``We're locked in.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson considered Castro his closest friend at Wendy's,
Johnson's family said. The two sometimes walked home together. Now,
Castro dragged Johnson upstairs, where they waited for the police
by the front counter. Johnson, who had a bullet lodged near the top
of his skull, was in Castro's arms. According to police
investigators, Castro was in such a daze that he did not even
realize he had been shot in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The first officers arrived at 12:52 a.m. The first paramedics
arrived a minute later. Seeing two wounded men inside, the officers
smashed through the glass of the locked front door.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson and Castro were taken to a hospital, the officers
followed a trail of blood down the stairs to the basement, where
they confronted the carnage. There was blood everywhere _ on the
walls, on the floor, on boxes of food. Four of the employees were
already dead. A fifth died on the way to New York Hospital Medical
Center in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first Emergency Medical Service paramedics on the
scene described his reaction to a superior. ``He said to me, `You
trained for this, you're prepared for this. But you're never
prepared for this. These were kids. They were teen-agers. This was
a massacre.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said they believed the weapon used was a
.380-calibre semiautomatic handgun. Police said they were unsure
whether more than one was used in the attack.

MALIBU DUO TEAM FOR BAJA 500
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TIM HADDOCK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
LOS ANGELES _ For John Clark Gable, the Tecate/SCORE Baja 500 is
old hat. For Dodd Darin, the 500-mile off-road race through the
Mexican peninsula will be a new experience.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The pair from Malibu have decided to team up in the Tropy Truck
division for this year's June 3 Baja 500 with high expectations and
future races in mind.
</P>
<P>
   Gable, son of actor Clark Gable, has competed in off-road racing
in Baja for nearly two decades. He got his start in racing on
off-road motorcycles when he was 5 and growing up on his father's
22-acre Encino ranch.
</P>
<P>
   But he injured his knee in an accident while racing at Indian
Dunes in 1982. As a result, Gable switched from dirt bikes to
trucks.
</P>
<P>
   Darin, the son of singer Bobby Darin and actress Sandra Dee,
followed a similar path. Darin and Gable have been friends since
they were 5 and used to ride their dirt bikes on the Gable ranch.
Darin later switched to racing go-karts. Some 33 years later, Darin
still sees a future in open-wheel racing. He wants to eventually
become a CART team owner with Gable and sees the Baja 500 as a
great way to gain exposure for his goal.
</P>
<P>
   While Darin, 38, has his sights on eventually owning a team,
Gable is more concerned with the immediate future of racing in the
Baja 500.
</P>
<P>
   This will be Gable's first Baja 500 since 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been going down and doing some pre-running,'' said
Gable, 39, who is also racing motocross to get himself in shape for
the Baja 500. ``I got to get used to driving again.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Darin, he may only drive the ArtoftheStars.com-sponsored
Trophy Truck for one or two stages of the race. His main
responsibility will be as navigator for Gable. And if not for a
challenge from Gable, Darin's sole responsibility would be as
navigator.
</P>
<P>
   ``He told me he didn't think I could do it,'' Darin said. ``So
it was a bit of bravado on my part. I just want to be competitive
on the stages I drive. I'm looking forward to it. It should be
quite an experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Darin said he wants to continue racing after the Baja 500 in
open-wheel competition, perhaps the Barber-Saab series. Gable said
he wants to try and race in the Baja 2000 in November and continue
in off-road racing in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Johnson of Canyon Country, the defending Irwindale Speedway
NASCAR Super Late Model champion, scored a win after track
officials disqualified the first- and second-place drivers from
Saturday night's race.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Walker of Canyon Country and Brandon Loverock of Santa Fe
Springs lost their prize money and points. Walker was penalized for
using noncomforming parts in his engine. Loverock was penalized for
using nonconforming cylinder heads. Walker also had to forfeit his
$1,000 prize for winning the Food 4 Less ``Fast 4 Shootout,'' a
four-lap trophy dash.
</P>
<P>
   Rip Michels of Mission Hills won the NASCAR Grand American
Modified main event, his second victory in three races this season.
And if not for a blown engine on opening night, Michels might be
perfect this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I ain't getting greedy,'' Michels said. ``Sometimes things go
right and sometimes they don't. Right now they're going right for
us.''
</P>
<P>
   In other action at Irwindale Speedway, Bob Reed of Riverside won
the NASCAR Mini Stock main; Jon Zernikow of Monrovia won the
Legends car main; and Darren Young of Gilbert, Ariz., won the
Mechanix Wear Speed Trucks main.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Hornaday Jr. of Palmdale, the top rookie on the NASCAR Busch
Grand National Division, will be making his first trip for a points
race to Lowe's Motor Speedway for Saturday's Charlotte 300.
</P>
<P>
   But that doesn't mean he doesn't have any experience at the
1.5-mile oval.
</P>
<P>
   Driving identical convertible Winston Cup cars, Hornaday beat
NASCAR Winston Cup driver Jimmy Spencer during last year's Summer
Shootout at Lowe's Motor Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   While testing at Dover Downs this week, Hornaday was clocked at
29.005 seconds, nearly .2 seconds faster than the pole qualifying
time for the Busch series race there last year. As a result, crew
chief Gere Kennon decided to use the same car at Lowe's Motor
Speedway this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a great test at Charlotte two weeks ago and I was
pleased with how we gained on everyone all day long,'' Hornaday
said. ``We didn't start out real good, but Gere, Steve (Hmiel) and
everyone on the NAPA Auto Parts team kept thrashing and we were as
good as anyone on the second day. But then we went to Dover and
that car was awesome. It was the best Busch car I have ever driven.
We all decided we had to bring the Dover car to Charalotte and so I
am even more excited than I was before.''
</P>
<P>
   Entering the Charlotte 300, Hornaday holds a 10-point lead in
the rookie standings, ahead of Kevin Harvick of Bakersfield.
Hornaday is also fifth in the overall standings, but has yet to win
a race this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're fifth in points and that's great, but we want to win
races,'' Hornaday said. ``Everyone on this team is used to winning
races, and we haven't won yet. So I'm disappointed. Don't get me
wrong. I'm not upset with how we've run, but (team owner) Dale
Earnhardt expects victories. And Ron Hornaday does too.
</P>
<P>
   Pasadena High graduate Richie Hearn qualified 23rd for Sunday's
Indianapolis 500. He will be driving the Pagan Racing Team
Dallara-Aurora in the race.

 NEW YORK: the attack. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, members of Jaquione Johnson's large family
filed into a hospital waiting room, pacing and awaiting word from
doctors, who were still operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors said he can't move his right side at all, but he has
sensation in it,'' his aunt, Regina Johnson, said. ``His teeth are
completely shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally Joretta Johnson was allowed into the intensive care unit
see her son, nicknamed ``Fluff Love'' because his hair looks so
soft and fluffy when it is unbraided. Ms. Johnson, her eyes puffy
and red and tired, had been through something like this last year
when her older son was shot and seriously wounded. This time, she
turned to her family and said, ``I'm asking for everybody's
prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant, a co-worker, Olga Purdie, whose 2-9 shift
overlapped with the victims', rattled off their names and burst
into tears. ``Jean, Ramon, Ali, Jeremy, Anita, Jaquione,'' she
sobbed. ``They were my co-workers. They were my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday night, two detectives were sent to Castro's home in
Queens to protect their leading witness in the case. ``We fear for
his life,'' one friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the district attorney, spent three hours at the scene and
promised ``a full court press'' to arrest the culprits. It was the
worst massacre in Queens since 1995, when six people were murdered
in a College Point condominium.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Flushing area, considered by many to be the cultural
heart of the borough, the residents, almost to a person, say they
feel safer there than when they travel to any other part of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the shadow of Manhattan's skyscrapers, Flushing in the
last 20 years has become one of the city's most dynamic business
districts, with scores of stores and foreign banks and crowded
sidewalks, having supplanted Chinatown in Manhattan as the city's
Asian hub.
</P>
<P>
   It is considered a good, safe place to live. People go here to
make money, not problems, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up here my whole life,'' said James Deleon, 23, a City
Council aide. ``It's New York that works. It's everything good
about the city without the bad. We worry about traffic problems and
garbage pickup, not two murderers on the loose.'' At Wendy's, city
workers pumped out sewer lines, searching for a weapon, clothing,
anything at all that might be a clue. Police dogs and their
handlers methodically searched for some faint scent of the gunmen.
A police van circled the neighborhood, its speakers blasting pleas
for witnesses to come forward.
</P>
<P>
   A police helicopter hovered and, for reasons authorities would
not disclose, officers searched for a green 1994 Toyota Maxima.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they believed that one of the gunmen had
either worked at the restaurant or knew someone who did. ``They
knew too much about Wendy's and how things worked there,'' one
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said they were pursuing several
possible suspects, including one 36-year-old man, a former
employee, who was arrested last summer in connection with a robbery
at a McDonald's in Queens. Other former Wendy's employees were also
potential suspects, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Choe, a vice president for Wendy's, said the Flushing store
had been open for about two years and had never been robbed before
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors hampered investigators Thursday. A security
camera surveyed the front counter area of the store, but its
videotape was missing.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of gunfire may have been muffled by work crews who
were jack-hammering a sidewalk just four doors away. ``I heard
nothing because of the construction,'' said Muhammed Khalid,
manager of the Flushing News Outlet, also four doors away. ``Only
after the cops came did we learn of the shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, law enforcement officials said they had more than
enough leads to pursue, and they expressed confidence that they
would soon make arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be today, it may be tomorrow, it may be later,'' one
senior law enforcement official said Thursday, ``but we will get
these guys. If we can't catch guys like this, then shame on us.''

LAKERS LOOK BACK ON FEB. 29 WIN IN PORTLAND
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Go ahead, just because you're a Lakers fan under
stress and you have to blow off steam. Boo Mike Dunleavy, the
Portland Trail Blazers' head coach. Jeer him, as the Staples Center
customers did most of Saturday afternoon and all of Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   Hate him for ordering the Hack-a-Shaq (breaking the NBA's
unwritten First Commandment _ thou shalt not put the pursuit of
victory ahead of entertainment value).
</P>
<P>
   Disdain him for presuming to compete with Phil Jackson in
preseries psych games (Jackson: The Blazers are the best team money
can buy. Dunleavy: Are not. Jackson: The Blazers are the series
favorites. Dunleavy: Are not).
</P>
<P>
   Shun him for having presided over the post-Pat Riley demise of
the Showtime Lakers (as if it's his fault Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and
retired) and then leaving them to Randy Pfund.
</P>
<P>
   As long as you feel a little sorry for him, too.
</P>
<P>
   Think about what Dunleavy is up against, and how little credit
he gets for it.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a mental image to take with you into Game 3 of the
Western Conference finals tonight at the Rose Garden in Portland.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy at the wheel of a van full of children in basketball
togs, each as special as the next. Scottie, Bonzie and Brian.
Damon, Steve and Arvydas. And Stacey, pleading, ``Tell Rasheed to
stop staring at me.''
</P>
<P>
   They are on their way to the gym, where Coach Mike will take on
the thankless task of keeping all the kids happy, dividing up the
playing time just right, wishing he could carve the ball into 12
pieces.
</P>
<P>
   That's the way it is, day in and day out, for the coach of the
deepest and most balanced NBA team in decades.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy went to Portland in 1997 when the Blazers had many of
today's players plus Isaiah Rider, who was a dozen clashing
personalities all by himself. For adding .139 to the team's winning
percentage in 1998-99, while keeping the passengers from breaking
out the van windows, he was named NBA Coach of the Year.
</P>
<P>
   The challenge got a little easier when the enigmatic Rider was
traded before this season. But not by much.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the season started, the Blazers had added Scottie
Pippen, Steve Smith and Detlef Schrempf, boosting owner Paul
Allen's player payroll to an league-high. Dunleavy's 12-man playoff
roster includes 10 who have been full-time NBA starters. It's an
ideal coaching situation or a nightmare waiting to unfold.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy wound up improving the Blazers' win percentage again
this year, coaching them to a 59-win season, their best since Rick
Adelman won 63 in 1990-91, and now they're three victories from
their first NBA Finals appearance since 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to sell a lot of people on giving up something
(and) playing together to win,'' Dunleavy said of his challenge.
``Most of us are mostly selfish. We're looking for
self-gratification.''
</P>
<P>
   He made the sale. Only one Blazer veteran scored better than his
career average Rasheed Wallace, who put up a new career high, 16.4
points a game. Portland didn't put a scorer in the top 40.
</P>
<P>
   When Dunleavy won his Coach of the Year award, he said it
``embarrassed'' him because he'd ``talked about our team being a
team ... I just hope our players understand that this is really a
team award.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, the voters must have listened. Last month,
Dunleavy received not a single vote for the 1999-2000 Coach of the
Year went to Orlando's Doc Rivers.
</P>
<P>
   Credit is hard-earned in this line of work unless you're an old
star player, you're coaching in Los Angeles, New York or Chicago,
or you win a championship. Dunleavy was never a star in his NBA
career, which covered parts of 11 seasons. He coached in Los
Angeles for only two seasons before skipping off to the Milwaukee
Bucks for more money, a longer contract and a better place to raise
kids. And this is is best shot at a title since he was a rookie
coach taking the Lakers to the 1990-91 NBA Finals only to lose 4-1
to Jackson's Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   Those Lakers with Vlade Divac at center, replacing Abdul-Jabbar
</P>
<P>
   beat the Bulls in game 1 in Chicago. Then James Worthy got hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their goal during that series was to wear Magic down, try to
put different defenders on him. One guy gets tired, you rotate in
Dunleavy remembered. ``They pressed him, they picked us up
full-court a lot. Back then, our press-breaker was James Worthy,
and when James was injured that put us in a tough situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The 36-year-old Dunleavy's low-key good nature had made him an
ideal successor if not antidote to Riley. A fashion writer compared
the two men's wardrobes and noted Dunleavy's ``penchant for navy
suits.'' Nobody bothered to compare their hair.
</P>
<P>
   What happened next was out of Dunleavy's hands. Johnson made his
shocking retirement announcement. The Lakers were down to Worthy
and a bunch of guys. They went 43-39 and finished sixth in the
Pacific Division in 1991-92.
</P>
<P>
   Dunleavy had two years left on his Lakers contract and the team
offered a two-year extension. But Bucks owner Herb Kohl needed a
coach and offered eight years and $8 million.
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Dunleavy would tell a Portland business publication
that leaving Los Angeles had been his ``worst business decision''
despite its benefits for his family. He didn't break .500 again
until he went to the Blazers.
</P>
<P>
   Now he's working on the highest winning percentage (.654) by a
Blazers coach, and he might be on his way to the NBA Finals for the
first time in nine years. Other than Jackson, the Lakers and those
12 kids behind him in the van, he doesn't have too much to
overcome. &QL;

TRAINING CAMP TO REMAIN FREE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RAY BUCK 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ Dallas Cowboys owner Jerry Jones will be content
to let rival owner Daniel Snyder of the Washington Redskins one-up
him in charging fans admission to attend training-camp practices
this summer. The Redskins announced this week that fans attending
two-a-day workouts at the team's Loudoun County facility, just
north of Dulles International Airport, will have to pay $10 per day
(children 12 and younger are free), plus $10 parking, beginning
July 20.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys will remain admission-free and parking-free during
their stay at Midwestern State University in Wichita Falls, July 17
to Aug. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think a lot of our training camp,'' Jones said Thursday,
``but we also think it's a unique time for our fans ... so we won't
be doing that.'' JONES SUPPORTS 14-TEAM PLAYOFFS
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Jones is in favor of the NFL's proposal to expand the
playoff format from 12 teams to 14 teams, beginning in 2002 when
Houston makes it a 32-team league.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like adding two more (playoff) teams,'' Jones said. ``With
(expansion), I think it will be exciting for at least two more
cities that time of year, and I think it will create more
incentive.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones returned to Valley Ranch on Thursday after spending the
previous three days in Baltimore at the NFL owners meetings. Also
under study was a plan to seed playoff teams, which would increase
the incentive for teams to keep winning even after they clinch
their divisions.
</P>
<P>
   Discussion will continue. There are arguments for and against an
8-8 division champion being seeded above a 9-7 wild-card team.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a point yet to be determined,'' Jones said. ``But since
we're looking at it, we might as well look at that, too. The fact
that you won't be playing as many teams within your division (under
a four-team division format), gives to that consideration. And I
would entertain it.'' UNDERWOOD SETTLING IN
</P>
<P>
   Defensive end Dimitrius Underwood continues to be as impressive
with his ability on the practice field as he does in being a
non-story off it.
</P>
<P>
   Dallas is the third NFL stop for Underwood, a first-round pick
in 1999, who failed in Minnesota and Miami. His career since
getting out of Michigan State has been marred by psychological
problems, including a suicide attempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an on-going thing ... (but) I feel very good about the
direction he's headed. I don't want to put any added pressure on
him. He's working on some issues,'' Cowboys coach Dave Campo said,
adding that coaches, teammates and team counselors continue to be a
support system for Underwood.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm taking it one day at a time,'' Underwood said. ``I'm not
worried about the past; I'm not worried about the future; I'm
taking it one day at a time. This is a great opportunity for me ...
and I'm going to run with it.''

 &HT;    NASCAR goods: Gentlemen, open your wallets
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   It seemed a bit fishy a couple of years ago when a company began
selling lures featuring stock-car drivers. A spoon and a spinner
had a driver's head shot, a tiny picture of his car and his
signature on a big hook.
</P>
<P>
   Now, what kind of fish would bite on something like that?
</P>
<P>
   The answer has just been reeled in: a 6.5-pound trophy bass, 19
inches long with a shiny polymer body painted like the cars of the
top drivers.
</P>
<P>
   For $59.95, fans can choose from bass painted like Dale
Earnhardt's No. 3 Chevrolet, Terry Labonte's No. 5 Chevy, Jeremy
Mayfield's No. 12 Ford, Bobby Labonte's No. 18 Pontiac, Tony
Stewart's No. 20 Pontiac, Ricky Rudd's No. 28 Ford or Dale
Jarrett's No. 88 Ford.
</P>
<P>
   And they don't even have to spend one minute at the lake.
</P>
<P>
   The optional wall mount is $19.95, but fans need to hurry. The
Earnhardt fish is a limited edition.
</P>
<P>
   Has NASCAR crossed the line with its marketing efforts? Probably
not. The philosophy is simple: If the product is large enough,
NASCAR will slap a logo and a number on it.
</P>
<P>
   To understand the inspiration for a fish with the body of a
stock car, just refer to NASCAR's long-trumpeted stats on fans'
brand loyalty. According to a 1997 Performance Research Study, 72
percent of NASCAR fans buy products because they are sponsored on
the cars of their favorite drivers. Forty-nine percent of the fans
earn more than $40,000 and apparently are willing to spend a lot of
that on stuff like phony fish, if it carries the right number.
</P>
<P>
   Retail sales of NASCAR-licensed merchandise approached a
staggering $1 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Brian Royce, who manages the NASCAR Thunder souvenir store at
Gwinnett Place Mall in Atlanta, sees it every day. ``Racing fans,''
he said, ``will buy anything.''
</P>
<P>
   And they will scoop up anything. Case in point: Fans walk
through pit road an hour after most races, stooping to find lugnuts
as if they were discarded lottery tickets. That's after they have
panhandled for a worn racing tire or a piece of scrap metal.
</P>
<P>
   Who else but a stock-car racing fan would trade $4 for a penny?
That's the price of a new collectible named the Lucky Penny. A car
number is lasered out of a regular Lincoln penny, bagged and
stapled to a card containing a photo and bio information of
selected drivers.
</P>
<P>
   They buy model cars to put in wall cases and cars that actually
do things besides just sit there. Like the computer mouse shaped
and painted like the No. 24. There are cars that are telephones,
cars that are walkie-talkies.
</P>
<P>
   There's even a $40 car perfect for a desk, complete with
accessories. The exhaust pipe is a pen; the front bumper doubles as
a T-square ruler, the back bumper a pair of scissors, the roof top
a tape dispenser. Pull the engine out if you need a stapler.
</P>
<P>
   You might find this item on the desk of a CEO, although the box
says ``Ages 4 and up.'' It likely will be next to the crystal car
paperweight, which sells for $75 to $95.
</P>
<P>
   Only now it is possible to catch bugs in style on the way to a
race with a custom-molded bug shield ($129.99) and headlight guards
($89.99) adorned with the signature and number of your favorite
Ford driver.
</P>
<P>
   There is NASCAR for nearly every room in the house. An
inflatable chair ($29.99) for the living room is designed with two
wheels as armrests. Lamps, rugs, throws. For the bath, how about a
toothbrush holder or a soap dispenser in checkered flag?
</P>
<P>
   You can do an entire bedroom with a racing motif, from sheets to
pillowcases to blankets to wallpaper border.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can wake up with Jeff Gordon every morning,'' Royce said.
He didn't say you can go to bed with Jeff Gordon every night; this
is a family sport, remember.
</P>
<P>
   You can fill cupboards with NASCAR mugs and dishes and every
closet with NASCAR clothing, from hats to socks and everything _
boxers bearing the logo of your favorite car ($16) _ in between.
</P>
<P>
   Those who think that racing fans might be just a tick backward
now have some real evidence: A wristwatch that is new on the market
counts down the hours and minutes between Winston Cup races.
</P>
<P>
   It is similar to the discontinued $150 watch that was supposed
to keep a race fan up-to-date on the Cup schedule. It would give a
readout of upcoming races, including time and TV network. It was
programmed so that every week, just before the start of a race, a
chime would play the Star Spangled Banner.
</P>
<P>
   The watch manufacturer could not get a replacement chip for this
year's schedule.
</P>
<P>
   For the thrill of almost being there, there's the talking key
chain ($8): Press a button on the little car and the headlights go
on and a voice within says, ``Gentlemen, start your engines.''
</P>
<P>
   If you really want to look like Earnhardt, you can buy his
favorite brand of sunglasses for $175 and intimidate your friends
playing Dale Earnhardt Monopoly ($35). The game pieces include a
pit-crew gas man. You ``Collect $200 salary'' as you pass Go.
Boardwalk and Park Place have been replaced by historic cars
Earnhardt has driven to championships.
</P>
<P>
   And you can toast your victory by raising a container of
official NASCAR bottled water. The price? A buck-fifty.

   NAn interview with STEVE GRISSOMSteve Grissom will be behind the
wheel of the No. 44 Pontiac this week, substituting for regular
driver Kyle Petty. Grissom, a 36-year-old native of Gadsden, Ala.,
who honed his skills on the short tracks around north Georgia, will
drive for the team in Sunday's Coca-Cola 600. Grissom is a Winston
Cup veteran and former Busch series champion, and he drives the
Petty Enterprises entry in NASCAR's Craftsman Truck Series. He also
is the testing the Dodges that Petty Enterprises will run next
season. He spoke with members of the media earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are your thoughts going into this weekend's race?
</P>
<P>
   A: While I appreciate the opportunity, I don't care very much
for the circumstances. I'm just glad I have the chance to do
something to help out the family. This was a terrible deal, just
horrible, and I know how rough it has been on me personally, so I
can't begin to imagine how bad it has been for Kyle, Pattie,
Austin, Montgomery Lee and the rest of the family. Driving the car
this week gives me a chance to give them something back, to do
something for them. I'm sure Kyle can use the time away. I know the
first time I walked through the doors at Petty Enterprises they
treated me like family, and I've been one of the family ever since.
As part of the family, this is my contribution.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Have you set any goals for this race?
</P>
<P>
   A: Our goal all week is to make everybody proud of us. I know
(crew chief) Bobby Leslie and the guys on the team are going to do
everything they can to give us a good car. Most of all, we want to
make Kyle proud of us.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How difficult is it to step into an unfamiliar car?
</P>
<P>
   A: Usually a one-race change like this can be pretty difficult.
A team getting used to a driver, especially a driver they know they
are going to have to get used to only for one race, is tough to do.
They know how they set things up for Kyle, now they have to set
things up for somebody totally different. Knowing these guys some
helps a lot. I know them; they know me. I have a good bit of
Winston Cup experience, so that should help some. And I've turned a
lot of laps at Charlotte, so that ought to help some too.
</P>
<P>
   Q: How important is it for you personally to be running again in
a Winston Cup race at Lowe's Motor Speedway?
</P>
<P>
   A: The speedway isn't far from my house, and I drive by there
almost every day. I've missed running a Winston Cup car there.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR HEADLINES
</P>
<P>
   An exhibition of wrecks.sport has an event quite as intense as
NASCAR's The Winston. Last week's all-star extravaganza started
with 20 drivers and finished with only a dozen -- with a lot of
wrecks in the 70 laps in between. What is the reason behind the
overly aggressive driving -- the record $500,000 purse for the
winner or plain ol' competitive juices? The answer is both. That
was proved when cars nowhere near the front pack mixed it up. The
most fortunate aspect of the non-points event was that no one was
seriously injured in the race.
</P>
<P>
   Weekend for Adam.
</P>
<P>
   LOOKING AHEAD
</P>
<P>
   Pettys will go on.Kyle Petty, skipped The Winston and Sunday's
Coca-Cola 600 but will return to the No. 44 Pontiac. The King said
his son will be behind the wheel at Dover, Del., next weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Surprise at Hendrick.it is the low-key third member of Hendrick
who is the talk of the track. Jerry Nadeau earned a spot in The
Winson and finished fourth. He will start on the outside pole
Sunday. It is the best streak in the young driver's Winston Cup
career.
</P>
<P>
   LEADERS OF THE PACK
</P>
<P>
   1. Dale Earnhardt Jr. It has been feast or famine for Earnhardt,
rookie driver of the No. 8 Chevrolet, who is red hot after winning
The Winston on Saturday night at Lowe's Motor Speedway in
Charlotte. Earnhardt also won the Charlotte 600 pole. He has posted
victories at Texas and Richmond but crashed in Atlanta, Bristol,
Darlington and Talladega. Earnhardt has three top-10 finishes in
eleven points races. He won't win the championship, but this
third-generation driver seems likely to win again in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   2. Ward Burton. He often is overshadowed by his brother, Jeff,
but Ward has been making his own headlines this year. After winning
at Darlington, one of the toughest stops on the circuit, he is in
position to contend for the points title. Crew chief Tommy Baldwin
now is regarded as one of the best in NASCAR. The worry is whether
the impending move to Dodge in 2001 will hurt their championship
aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   3. Bobby Labonte. He will be a solid favorite to win the 600
Sunday night in Charlotte. Bobby leads the Winston Cup points
standings but by only three points over Ward Burton after recent
struggles, including the wreck at Talladega.
</P>
<P>
   4. Jeff Burton. A streaky driver with a streaky team. The No. 99
Exide Ford team has been plagued by some bad luck while leading
races, including the Cracker Barrel 500 at Atlanta, but don't count
out the Roush Racing team.
</P>
<P>
   5. Mark Martin. He doesn't win as often, but he seems to be in
the top five every week. He is third in the points standings, and
many racing people think this could be the year for the title. His
off-season back surgery has been a success.
</P>
<P>
   FREE FALLIN'
</P>
<P>
   1. Tony Stewart. Stewart is happy only when he wins. He is not
winning this year. He finally led his first lap of the season at
Richmond. He could've and should've won the even, but was nudged on
pit road by eventual winner Dale Earnhardt Jr. After the race
ended, Stewart almost ran over several spectators as he revved up
his engine on the way to the garage. In The Winston last week, he
was criticized by the Burton brothers for trying to run over Mark
Martin. Stewart later apologized to Martin.
</P>
<P>
   2. Johnny Benson. Benson, who nearly held off the Fords in the
Daytona 500, has had little success since. He started strong but
was hindered by an early season DNQ. The Tyler Jet Motorsports team
needs a strong 600 to gain momentum for the long summer.
</P>
<P>
   3. Geoffrey Bodine. Bodine, who survived one of the worst
crashes in the history of Daytona International Speedway in
February, is driving the No. 60 Chevrolet. But suddenly, he is
involved in the rumor mill. After crashing Saturday night at
Charlotte, it seemed that team owner Joe Bessey was ready to pull
the plug on Bodine. But Bessey will let the Chemung, N.Y., driver
stay on for now.
</P>
<P>
   ON THE RISE
</P>
<P>
   1. Steve Park. The No. 1 Chevy driver has surpassed Mike Skinner
as ``the best Winston Cup driver not to win a race yet.'' He is
part of the hottest team in racing, with Dale Earnhardt Jr. his
on-track partner. Although overshadowed by Little E's victory at
The Winston, Park also earned accolades for winning The Winston
Open qualifying race. He had a shot at the trophy in the main event
before being bumped and turned around by Joe Nemechek.
</P>
<P>
   2. Jerry Nadeau. The newest driver at Hendrick Motorsports had
the best moments of his career during The Winston all-star weekend.
Nadeau won a spot on the front row for The Winston Open in
qualifying. He earned a spot in the main event by winning the No
Bull Sprint. He kept up the hot streak by finishing fourth in the
all-star race. If Nadeau can stay consistent, he will justify the
sponsorship dollars of Michael Holigam Homes.
</P>
<P>
   3. Ken Schrader. He has performed miserably in qualifying this
year. Schrader is in his first year with MB2 Motorsports and the
team has struggled to develop chemistry. Despite troubles, the
veteran driver ranks 16th in the points and has a chance at the top
10. Schrader has a lot of momentum after finishing 12th in
Richmond, and he could surprise.

LESLIE GUDEL IS THE MOTOR SPORTS EXPERT ABC NEEDED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TOM HOFFARTH  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Leslie Gudel's form-fitted, fire-retardant
jumpsuit that she has to wear in the infield at the Indianapolis
500 won't have the phrase ``Brickyard Babe'' stitched over the top
pocket.
</P>
<P>
   Fact is, with the giant radio headset she has to wear for ABC's
live coverage of the 84th running of the marquee event Sunday
morning, she feels more like a gearhead geek. Friends have told her
she looked like a Martian.
</P>
<P>
   That, and at 5-foot-10, she tends to tower a bit over these
jockey-sized race car drivers, which only adds to the amusing
visual.
</P>
<P>
   But the network's decision to add Gudel, the UCLA grad and
former Los Angeles anchor at the then-Prime Ticket ``Press Box'' in
the mid-'90s, is anything but an awkward fit. Especially this year,
where for the first time, there are two females in the starting
field of 33.
</P>
<P>
   Gudel, as it turns out, is doing more than fill a quota. She's
filling a need ABC has had on this race coverage for a long time _
not just a female TV presence, but one who knows what she's talking
about.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why did it take so long? It took the right person, which we
all believe Leslie is, and she proved on the Saturday and Sunday
shows (last weekend during coverage of the qualifying) to step into
as high a profile and as much a pressure situation as you can
possibly imagine in sports TV,'' said Bob Goodrich, ABC's Indy 50
producer for the last 16 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's a terrific reporter and she always does her job. She's
not just cruising in and saying, `tell me what you want me to do
and I'll do it.' She sold me on some interviews she wanted to do
last Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's didn't just come out of the woodwork. She's a good,
sound professional broadcaster and reporter and that's what we're
asking her to do.'' That wide-range role includes covering
everything that goes on in the garages and hospital area with
drivers, owners and mechanics, plus celebrity interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ABC has three other pit reporters Jack Arute, Dr. Jerry Punch
and Vince Welch _ but Gudel will also be in the pace car as the
race begins to report on track conditions.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty awesome to be part of all this,'' said Gudel, an
anchor at Philadelphia's Comcast Cable sports desk and whose motor
sports experience comes from doing NASCAR coverage for TNN. ``I had
a blast last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the things I'm reporting on adds a dimension. In the
past, they had to have someone leave the pits to go cover and they
could have missed something because of that.''
</P>
<P>
   As it turns out, Gudel isn't the first woman on ABC's Indy
broadcast. Donna DeVarona has been a fish out of water in the
position before, and one year Goodrich tried Al Unser Jr.'s wife in
the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's my ex-wife,'' Unser corrected Goodrich during a
conference call with reporters.
</P>
<P>
   Neither had the combination of Gudel's motor sports credentials
or on-air experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``The drivers don't see a lot of women running around in the
pits very often,'' Gudel admits. ``I was nervous last weekend, but
as it turned out, I knew more than I thought I knew, if that makes
sense, and I felt very comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The Web experience: Because Indy driver Eddie Cheever's main
sponsor is Excite.com, that site will unleash several interesting
elements this weekend that allow access to the true Cheever's
racing experience.
</P>
<P>
   The highlights at http://sports.exite.com are real time audio of
Cheever in contact with his pit crew, plus live telemetry streaming
of his in-car computer that gives reading of his MPH, RPM, G force,
lap time, throttle, steering, oil temperature, tire pressure and
brake data.
</P>
<P>
   Because Cheever, the '98 Indy winner, is also doing a live chat
after the race, there's the element of exclusivity if he wins this
time. Meaning he'll likely be taking e-mail questions before he
gets around to the media members.
</P>
<P>
   One of the reasons why the Indy 500 has regained some stature in
the business world is that one-third of the sponsorships are tech
companies.
</P>
<P>
   Missed it by that much: Fox picked the Boston Red Sox-New York
Yankees matchup to send to 77 percent of the country for its
relaunch of the Saturday Game of the Week (10 a.m.).
</P>
<P>
   But it'll be ESPN's Sunday Night Baseball that has those two
teams, plus the scheduled Pedro Martinez vs. Roger Clemens matchup
on its 5 p.m. telecast the next day.
</P>
<P>
   If the ESPN family has any say in the matter, this could also be
Fox's final year of carrying the Saturday package. ABC is expected
to bid for the lot, co-owned in the postseason by NBC, after Fox's
window of exclusivity to negotiate with baseball ends next week.
</P>
<P>
   If there is no deal reached between Fox and MLB, baseball can
open it up for bids after June 5. There's also talk of CBS trying
to wrestle away NBC's rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``The commissioner (Bud Selig) and (MLB executive) Paul Beeston
made it clear as to what the relationship has meant over the last
four years,'' said Fox executive Ed Goren.
</P>
<P>
   ``We clearly stepped in when not everyone was to pick up the
contract when baseball was going through tough labor times. In
conjunction with what baseball has done, we brought the sport back.
The relationship is solid and their desire is to continue this
relationship with Fox for many years to come.''
</P>
<P>
   But Goren isn't stupid. Loyalty in TV rights only go as far as
one's checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   ``It depends on what's in the envelope,'' Goren admits. ``Money
talks, you know what walks. I'd hope we get the benefit of the
doubt.''

   WHAT SMOKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sports Illustrated for Women's ``swimsuit spectacular''
(May/June issue) focuses on a photo shoot in Santa Monica that
includes very tasteful and even cute pictures of many L.A. athletes
(Lisa Leslie, Shaquille O'Neal, Karch Kiraly, Bob Samuelson,
Johnnie Morton, Misty May and Jason Sehorn) showing off the
products. Although Morton can't seem to keep his boardshorts on
around pool shark Jeanette ``The Black Widow'' Lee?. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   At least Lakers backup center John Salley has been put to a
useful task: Fox's National Sports Report has given him a camcorder
known as ``SpiderCam'' and asked him to tape behind-the-scene
interviews that have been airing on Sunday's newscast. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If Fox's 11 p.m. Regional Sports Report debuts next month with
as much creativity as the commercial spots created by the Cliff
Freeman and Partners ad firm, there should be no problem drawing
viewers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Learning Channel has an hour-long documentary looking at the
Indy 500 behind the scenes called ``24 Hours at Indy'' (Sunday, 10
p.m.) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WHAT CHOKES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   What does it say about ABC's plans for ``Monday Night Football''
when Rush Limbaugh gets a tryout but Dick Vermeil isn't even given
an invitation? The thing Vermeil apparently lacks: Abrasive,
incessant banter. If ABC wants this train-wreck mentality for its
viewership, why even keep someone such as !racepay!Al Michaels!off!
in the play-by-play chair. The WWF could rotate hosts, anchors and
analysts each week. Not that Boomer Esiason was the most polished
broadcaster
</P>
<P>
   although, given his lack of experience on such a big-time TV
event, he was set up to fail at least he has some credibility. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   TBS will use former NFL coach Jerry Glanville on its coverage
Sunday of the Coca-Cola 600 NASCAR race from Charlotte, N.C. When
will this wrench head be interviewed for ``MNF''? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CBS made a big to-do Thursday about having boxing return to
network TV for the first time in three years it's going to show
month-delayed replays of Showtime cable bouts that happen in June.
That'll include Mike Tyson's encounter with Lou Savarese. And this,
we're told, is the beauty of the CBS-Viacom merger.

 &HT;    15 refugees found on stopped sailboat
 &HT;    By Jill Taylor
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT SALERNO, Fla. _ A sheriff's marine deputy noticed a 35-foot
Morgan sailboat riding low in the water in the Manatee Pocket
Thursday and found 15 refugees hiding below decks when he boarded
the boat for an inspection.
</P>
<P>
   Martin County Deputy John Howell was joined by Florida Fish and
Wildlife officer Clay McDonough in trying to keep track of the nine
men and six women until Border Patrol arrived.
</P>
<P>
   One man jumped on the deck and dived overboard, making his way
to Rocky Point before McDonough caught up with him in the yard of a
home on Williams Way.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were jumping fences . . . until he finally stopped,'' said
McDonough as fire rescue workers treated the man for low blood
sugar.
</P>
<P>
   The man carried a passport identifying him as Sean Leon Osborne,
23, of the northern South American country of Guyana. He was
treated at the scene and turned over to immigration officials who
planned to take him to West Palm Beach for processing and then to
Krome detention center in Miami.
</P>
<P>
   Because the remaining refugees, eight others from Guyana and six
from Haiti, never set foot on American soil, they were to be
transferred to a Coast Guard cutter and scheduled for immediate
deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Osborne, who carried photographs of a young woman and a child
with his passport, will have the opportunity for a hearing to
contest deportation.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they think the group boarded the sailboat in the
Bahamas, the latest in a series of refugees to arrive in Martin
County in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Sailboat captain Harold Emil Fredrick, 48, of Lake City, was
arrested on warrants out of North Florida charging him with
violating probation, worthless checks and failing to appear in
court on a felony drunken driving charge.
</P>
<P>
   Officials also were researching ownership of the 1976 sailboat,
the Summerwind, which was registered out of St. George Island in
Florida's Panhandle and whether it might qualify for seizure under
state or federal laws.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Transportation Department, which has been
trying since 1973 to find a way to reduce vehicle rollovers, said
Thursday that it wanted to publish a ranking of cars, vans, pickups
and sport utility vehicles that it said correlated with their
tendency to turn over.
</P>
<P>
   Rollovers kill nearly 10,000 people a year, more than a quarter
of all the people who are killed in vehicles. Of the deaths in
sport utility vehicles, 62 percent are in rollover crashes; for
vans and pickups, the figure is just over 40 percent, and for cars,
22 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The government's main tool for safety is setting crash test
requirements, but to reduce rollovers it proposes using a public
ranking instead, based on the width of vehicles and the height of
their center of gravity. The agency now uses rankings for front-
and side-impact performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``Empowered consumers will have added ability to judge more
aspects of a vehicle's safety performance,'' said Transportation
Secretary Rodney Slater. With the ranking, Slater said, consumers
can ``make choices based on reason and reflection, rather than just
the style and appearance of a given vehicle.''
</P>
<P>
   He and other officials said they hoped the rankings would
encourage manufacturers to make their vehicles lower and wider.
</P>
<P>
   But some safety advocates said a better approach would be
establishing performance standards. ``A highway safety issue that
takes 10,000 lives a year and costs $30 billion deserves a more
effective response,'' said David F. Snyder, a spokesman for the
American Insurance Association.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers Union, the publisher of Consumer Reports, whose
petition to the government in 1988 for a rollover standard produced
Thursday's announcement of a grading system instead, said that it
was pleased with the result, but that requiring live tests would
have been better.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we evaluate any product, we make every effort to test
that product in as close to real-world conditions _ i.e., having
the product perform its essential tasks, _ as we can,'' said Dr. R.
David Pittle, senior vice president and technical director at
Consumers Union. Cars should be tested, Pittle said, on how well
they perform and avoid accidents.
</P>
<P>
   The auto makers have argued, though, that rollover tests do not
produce consistent results. Vehicles ride on springy suspension
systems and thus vibrate, said Gloria J. Bergquist, a spokeswoman
for the Alliance of Automobile Manufacturers. They may roll because
of the oscillation, Bergquist said, but if the government ranked
the vehicles' tendency to roll on a course, and then changed the
shape of the course, the ranking would change.
</P>
<P>
   The ranking system that the Transportation Department now plans
to use consists of one-half the track width of the vehicle divided
by the height of its center of gravity, a ranking called the static
stability index. The department will use the scores to award stars,
from one to five, to separate the vehicles into classes, as it
already does for front-impact and side-impact performance. More
stars means less tendency to roll.
</P>
<P>
   Bergquist said that might have some value, but that ``some
issues are just too complex to be reduced to an icon.''
</P>
<P>
   But Joan Claybrook, a former head of the National Highway
Traffic Safety Administration and now president of Public Citizen,
an advocacy group, said that resorting to a ranking instead of a
rule was particularly unhelpful for the class of driver most likely
to roll a car, young people who do not choose cars with safety in
mind.
</P>
<P>
   The department estimates that there are 228,000 vehicle
rollovers a year. Sometimes vehicles roll over in the course of a
collision with another vehicle, but the vast majority are
single-vehicle crashes. Of the 25,000 people seriously injured in
these crashes, most are not wearing seat belts, and more than half
are fully or partially ejected from the vehicle in the course of
the crash, sometimes with the vehicle then rolling over them.
</P>
<P>
   The agency had been working on a performance standard, but
dropped that approach in 1994 because it said it could not
determine a measure that would predict rollover likelihood. Since
then it has been working on the grading system that was announced
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The safety administration, the part of the Transportation
Department with jurisdiction over light-duty vehicles, including
cars, vans and most sport utilities, said a grading system would be
faster to implement, compared with a crash-test program, and that
the agency was well set up to run it.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal announced Thursday will be open for public comment
for 60 days.
</P>
<P>
   Agency officials acknowledged that road conditions and driver
behavior were big influences on the likelihood of a rollover. But a
study of 186,000 crashes over a five-year period found that the
stability index correlated well with the incidence of rollovers,
department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   That study, based on cars built in the '90s, found that cars
generally get five stars, the highest rating, or four; minivans get
two or three; sport utilities, one to three, and pickups, one to
four.

SO, DID RED BULLET WIN OR DID FUSAICHI PEGASUS LOSE?
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
INGLEWOOD _ At the historic events, sometimes the most important
handicapping takes place after the race has been run.
<TEXT>
<P>
   So it is with last Saturday's Preakness Stakes.
</P>
<P>
   The handicapping question for posterity is this: Did Red Bullet
win the race, or did Fusaichi Pegasus lose it?
</P>
<P>
   Their trainers will never agree.
</P>
<P>
   Neil Drysdale thinks Fusaichi Pegasus didn't handle the wet
track and failed to run his race in the Preakness. Drysdale says,
in effect, that Red Bullet caught the Kentucky Derby winner on a
bad day.
</P>
<P>
   Joe Orseno thinks Drysdale is looking for excuses. Orseno wants
to beli eve Red Bullet beat the favorite on the square and is the
nation's new l eading 3-year-old.
</P>
<P>
   Who's right? The answer comes from looking at the performances
of two other horses in the Preakness. As Fusaichi Pegasus lost
touch with Red Bullet in the homestretch, he barely held onto
second from 19-1 shot Impea chment and perpetual disappointment
Captain Steve, horses he'd trounced by 5 1/2 and 14 lengths in the
Derby.
</P>
<P>
   If you believe Fusaichi Pegasus ran well and simply got outrun
by an im proved Red Bullet, then you also must believe that
Impeachment and Capta in Steve both took quantum leaps forward and
suddenly are the virtual equals of Fusaichi Pegasus. That's a lot
to assume.
</P>
<P>
   The logical conclusion is that Fu Peg was off his game that
afternoon a t Pimlico, whether because of the footing or because he
needs longer tha n two weeks between races.
</P>
<P>
   This means that _ at least for now _ Fu Peg is no superhorse.
One mark of greatness is the ability to win when conditions are
against you.
</P>
<P>
   This also means it's too soon to afix Red Bullet with a No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Can Red Bullet beat Fu Peg on the latter's best day? We can only
hope b oth colts run in the June 10 Belmont Stakes and answer that
question on the track.
</P>
<P>
   !arrow!The three-day weekend:!off! The combination of owner Team
Valor, trainer Jenine Sahadi, jockey Chris McCarron and an
Irish-bred 3-year-old has clicked before with Santa Anita Derby
winner The Deputy.
</P>
<P>
   That will attract bettors to Torgau, a filly making her U.S.
debut in S aturday's Honeymoon Handicap at Hollywood Park. The
Honeymoon is six stakes scheduled at the Inglewood Saturday, Sunday
and Monday, Memorial Day .
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know a lot about her. She's literally just out of
quarantine, '' Sahadi said of Torgau, who won 2 of 6 starts in
England, including a Group 2 sprint. ``Obviously, we think a lot of
her. She had very good fo rm in England.''
</P>
<P>
   The field of nine for the 1 1/8-miles-on-turf Honeymoon includes
two fillies who chased Secret Status in the Kentucky Oaks: Classy
Cara (third) and Kumari Continent (ninth).
</P>
<P>
   More on the weekend: The richest race is Monday's $300,000
Charles Whittingham Memorial Handicap, which joins stakes named for
Laz Barrera and the Willard Proctor on an afternoon honoring some
of the track's dearly departed trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Dark Moondancer was assigned a race-high 123 pounds, seven more
than th e other three horses expected for the Whittingham.
</P>
<P>
   Sunday's Milady Handicap is expected to match Riboletta and
Excellent M eeting _ 1-2 finishers in the Hawthorne _ and Spanish
Fern.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood Park is starting the weekend by offering $1 admission
to fans wearing any form of Lakers clothing to tonight's races. As
always, the Lakers' 6 p.m. playoff game in Portland will be shown
on track TV monitors.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, at Belmont Stakes in New York, Southern California-based
Big Jag, Straight Man and the filly Honest Lady will run in the
Metropolitan H andicap.
</P>
<P>
   Updates: The Deputy, rested since his 14th-place finish in the
Kentucky Derby, is scheduled to resume training next week. Sahadi
said the July 23 Swaps Stakes at Hollywood Park is a possible
target.
</P>
<P>
   The Deputy is considered a contender for the Del Mar Derby on
turf late r in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Two-year-old champion Anees, 13th in the Derby, had bone-chip
surgery a nd isn't expected to race again until fall.
</P>
<P>
   Globalize, the San Francisco Bay Area favorite who had to be
scratched after being kicked by his escort pony the day before the
Derby, returns in Saturday's Peter Pan Stakes at Belmont, and could
go on to the Belmont Stakes, trainer Jerry Hollendorfer said.
</P>
<P>
   Merger rumors: Churchill Downs Inc. confirmed Thursday it is
negotiating a merger with Arlington International Race Course near
Chi cago.
</P>
<P>
   Such a deal would seem to be good for both companies. It would
give Chu rchill another major property to go with Hollywood Park
and Miami's Cald er racetrack. It would secure the future of
Arlington, which was closed for the 1998 and 1999 racing seasons as
owner Richard Duchossois sought state economic breaks.
</P>
<P>
   The independent-minded Duchossois, who bought Arlington in 1983
and reb uilt it after a fire in 1985, is the question mark in the
negotiations. Reports say he would get $80 million and enough stock
to make him Church ill's largest stockholder at 25 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Churchill nation: An example of what a company can do when it
owns multiple racetracks is Saturday's pick-three linking races at
Churchill Downs, Calder and Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   Called the Churchill Downs Simulcast Network Pick Three, the $1
wager w ill challenge fans to connect the winners of Churchill's
10th race, Calder's 12th and Hollywood's fourth, all scheduled to
be run in the space of 23 minutes. A 19 percent mutuel takeout will
apply _ slightly lower than the 20.18-percent tax on Hollywood's
exotic wagers.
</P>
<P>
   The CDSN Pick Three is scheduled to be offered every Saturday
through t he close of the Churchill Downs season July 9. &QL;

JUSTICE STILL PLANS TO RECOMMEND SPLITTING MICROSOFT IN TWO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN RICHMAN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A government official close to the Microsoft
antitrust case confirmed that the plaintiffs will not seek to break
Microsoft into three or four companies.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said, the Justice Department and 17 of the 19 states
Friday will file a slightly modified version of their original
proposal to divide the company in two.
</P>
<P>
   Whether that's what the judge decides to do is another question.
</P>
<P>
   The judge who ruled Microsoft is an unlawful monopolist could
enlarge on the Justice Department's proposed remedies if he wishes,
according to past Supreme Court cases.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Microsoft sank $4.06 a share Thursday, to close at
$61.50, one day after U.S. District Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson
abruptly ended the two-year-old trial saying there were be no
further hearings. Proposals now will be submitted in writing and,
if the judge follows the plan he outlined Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   By his detailed questioning in the three-hour hearing Wednesday,
capped by a request that a new copy of the plaintiffs' proposal be
filed by Friday, Jackson strongly suggested he will embrace a
breakup plan of some sort.
</P>
<P>
   That Justice Department's plan, filed April 28, proposes
splitting the Redmond giant into an operating-system company and an
applications company. It also imposes restrictions on Microsoft's
business conduct.
</P>
<P>
   But past Supreme Court antitrust cases give judges broad
discretion to fashion remedies as they see fit. So Jackson could
pick and choose among several remedy proposals filed by ``friends
of the court'' on the plaintiffs' behalf.
</P>
<P>
   One amicus brief, which Jackson praised as ``excellent,''
advocates dividing the company into three entities, respectively
handling applications, the Windows operating system and the
Internet Explorer Web browser.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's admiration of that proposal in open court touched
off media speculation that the judge was considering a three-way
breakup of the company. The judge expressed concern at several
points that the Justice Department proposal did not go far enough.
</P>
<P>
   But at the hearing's conclusion Wednesday, he asked the Justice
Department only to submit a ``clean copy'' of its proposal. One
government official said later that day that the Justice Department
understands Jackson's request to mean ``tweaking or fine-tuning''
the proposal rather than broadening it to split the company into
three pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Those tweaks may include points touched on by Jackson during the
hearing, including:
</P>
<P>
   _Changing key definitions, including the definition of
``Microsoft'' itself
</P>
<P>
   _Adjusting limits on how much Microsoft stock an investor can
own before being forbidden from running, working for or investing
in the other company
</P>
<P>
   _Increasing government control over the breakup, because, as
Jackson said, ``I do not believe that Microsoft will be a willing
participant in it.''
</P>
<P>
   _Expanding the disclosures Microsoft must make, possibly even
requiring the company to release key source code to the general
public.
</P>
<P>
   The question of stock limits was raised in a letter written by
Microsoft co-founder and board member Paul Allen of Mercer Island.
Whether Microsoft should be forced to disclose its source code
arose in a pointed question Jackson asked Microsoft: ``Isn't
forfeiture a traditional equity remedy?''
</P>
<P>
   No, it isn't, at least not in antitrust law, answered Microsoft
attorney John Warden. And if Microsoft were forced to forfeit its
intellectual property, ``the conduct remedy alone would disable us
from competing,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department has continued to hammer away at the style
of Microsoft's competition, citing most recently a collection of
e-mails as as evidence that a structural remedy is needed to ensure
that Microsoft doesn't use its market power in personal computers
to dominate other products, like cell phones, set-top boxes and
handheld computers.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft Corp. Chairman Bill Gates warned Nokia Oyj in 1998
that Symbian Ltd.'s choice of the Java programming language would
be ``just declaring war on us,'' according to e-mails that were
unsealed Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no reason for them to do this except to attack
Microsoft,'' Gates wrote in messages made available in the
government's case. ``In any of these areas, we can provide things
as good as Sun (Microsystems Inc.) and things that work with the
PC.''
</P>
<P>
   Symbian is a group that includes Nokia, Ericsson AB, Matsushita
Electric Industrial Co., Motorola Inc. and Psion Plc as members.
Sun, Microsoft's rival, developed Java. Sun and Microsoft compete
in markets ranging from server software to programs written in
Java.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't let Sun win in this,'' Gates wrote in June 1998.
``Sun has no reason they should be chosen here'' by Symbian. He
also said that if Symbian chose to use a proprietary browser or
aggressively promote Sun's Java programming language, ``we should
do the most extreme things we can,'' including possibly not working
with the group on television set-top boxes.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft was adamant in its response.
</P>
<P>
   ``To the extent these e-mails have anything to say about the
current case, we believe they actually undermine the government's
arguments,'' said Mark Murray, a Microsoft spokesman. ``At the
heart of both of these e-mails is Microsoft struggling to respond
to intense competition from a number of very powerful companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever remedy Jackson chooses, he must craft it into a
comprehensive final order, which will probably take at least a
month, said University of Baltimore law professor Bob Lande. The
entry of that order concludes the trial and is the final step
before an appeal can proceed.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has said it will begin appellate proceedings
immediately upon entry of the order. Most lawyers connected with
the case believe that any restructuring would be stayed pending the
appeal's outcome but that the conduct-based portion of the remedy
would quickly go into effect.

 PERSONALS: Steve Young Starts His Own Team This Year

 &QL; 
 &QL; 
San Francisco 49er quarterback  &UR; Steve Young &LR; , 38, and his
wife, &UR; Barbara Graham &LR; , 31, are expecting a baby late this year,
says People magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The couple married in Hawaii on March 14, at which time Young's
agent and spokesman,  &UR; Leigh Steinberg &LR;  _ apparently prophetically _
pronounced them ``a perfect fit.'' Young is the oldest of five
siblings. In response to questions about family size at the time of
the wedding, Steinberg said, he was sure Young's ``vision is `the
more, the merrier.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Young's football career has been on hold since a series of
mishaps early last season forced him to the sidelines; he is said
to be leaning toward retiring from the sport.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE THINGS THEY DO TO PETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker  &UR; Ethan Coen  &LR; talks with  &UR; Jennifer Jason Leigh  &LR; in the
latest issue of Interview, as part of that magazine's series of
photo essays on stars and their pets. Leigh has two dogs, Bessie
and Otis, and both she and Coen are outraged by various countries'
insistence that dogs be quarantined when they cross borders. Leigh
mentions that her dogs were once held for two weeks when she went
to Tanganyika on a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear in some countries they cross-train them in
quarantine,'' says Coen. ``They have people in lab coats who teach
them, like, to snap at flies when they hear `Heel!' or vice versa,
just to mess with you when you get your dog back.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh says that her dogs have never snapped at flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mention it as an instance,'' says Coen, ``as a form of
psychological warfare. I mention it as a possibility. I don't claim
to be able to substantiate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh asks how this could be done. ``Would the guys in white lab
coats speak all the languages of the tourists that leave their pets
in quarantine?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mention it as a hypothetical,'' says Coen. ``It's something
to think about. Like why don't we have a word for the sound of a
dog's jaw snapping at flies?''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Tail extensions for dogs _ fur-covered finger cots,
perhaps, that fit over short tails and are secured by belly straps?
_ are one of the beauty possibilities for canine visitors to
Pets.com's Dog Day Afternoon, on June 11 at Speedway Meadow in
Golden Gate Park. The event, a fund-raiser for PAWS, Pets Are
Wonderful Support, is produced by Design Industries Foundation
Fighting AIDS.

San Francisco 49er quarterback  &UR; Steve Young &LR; , 38, and his
wife, &UR; Barbara Graham &LR; , 31, are expecting a baby late this year,
says People magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The couple married in Hawaii on March 14, at which time Young's
agent and spokesman,  &UR; Leigh Steinberg &LR;  _ apparently prophetically _
pronounced them ``a perfect fit.'' Young is the oldest of five
siblings. In response to questions about family size at the time of
the wedding, Steinberg said, he was sure Young's ``vision is `the
more, the merrier.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Young's football career has been on hold since a series of
mishaps early last season forced him to the sidelines; he is said
to be leaning toward retiring from the sport.

 &UR; THE THINGS THEY DO TO PETS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Filmmaker  &UR; Ethan Coen  &LR; talks with  &UR; Jennifer Jason Leigh  &LR; in the
latest issue of Interview, as part of that magazine's series of
photo essays on stars and their pets. Leigh has two dogs, Bessie
and Otis, and both she and Coen are outraged by various countries'
insistence that dogs be quarantined when they cross borders. Leigh
mentions that her dogs were once held for two weeks when she went
to Tanganyika on a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear in some countries they cross-train them in
quarantine,'' says Coen. ``They have people in lab coats who teach
them, like, to snap at flies when they hear `Heel!' or vice versa,
just to mess with you when you get your dog back.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh says that her dogs have never snapped at flies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I mention it as an instance,'' says Coen, ``as a form of
psychological warfare. I mention it as a possibility. I don't claim
to be able to substantiate it.''
</P>
<P>
   Leigh asks how this could be done. ``Would the guys in white lab
coats speak all the languages of the tourists that leave their pets
in quarantine?''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mention it as a hypothetical,'' says Coen. ``It's something
to think about. Like why don't we have a word for the sound of a
dog's jaw snapping at flies?''
</P>
<P>
   P.S. Tail extensions for dogs _ fur-covered finger cots,
perhaps, that fit over short tails and are secured by belly straps?
_ are one of the beauty possibilities for canine visitors to
Pets.com's Dog Day Afternoon, on June 11 at Speedway Meadow in
Golden Gate Park. The event, a fund-raiser for PAWS, Pets Are
Wonderful Support, is produced by Design Industries Foundation
Fighting AIDS.

<P>
   _ Smithsonian/Folkways released its first  &UR; Malvina Reynolds &LR; 
compilation _ ``Ear to the Ground: Topical Songs 1960-1978'' on
Tuesday, May 23. Bay Area songwriter Reynolds, who wrote ``Little
Boxes,'' was legendary for her music, her wit and her politics.

<P>
   _ InStyle magazine reports that at Arista Records' 25th
anniversary party, hosted by  &UR; Clive Davis &LR;  in Hollywood Hills, San
Francisco's own  &UR; Stanlee Gatti &LR; , who planned the decor, used 10,000
Leonadas roses. Roses are Gatti's trademark, but hey, 10,000 is
chopped liver. A Personals check found that the party planner used
50,000 at a dot.commer wedding on Treasure Island in March (only
2,000 at a SFMOMA benefit in January, but that was for a
nonprofit).

   PURDY, Wash. _ The sharp wooden spears and all the ankle bells
posed a bit of a problem. They are, after all, not exactly standard
prison fare. But for the visiting dancers from the National Ballet
of Rwanda, who said they were spreading a message of reconciliation
as widely as possible during their first appearance in North
America, officials at the Washington Corrections Center for Women
made an exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want all kinds of Americans to see that people can move
forward together,'' said Eugene Kayihura, the first counselor at
the Rwandan Embassy, explaining the dancers' unusual detour to the
prison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hutu, Tutsi, Twa, they can dance together,'' Kayihura said,
listing the three main ethnic groups in Rwanda. That African
country was ravaged by the civil war in 1994 that left more than
500,000 people dead and turned millions more into refugees. ``Yes,
what people know now of Rwanda is genocide. You go on the Internet
and you type `Rwanda,' and the first thing you will see is
`genocide.' The genocide happened. But we believe this is a sign of
what can happen in the post-genocide era.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rwandan dancers came here for nearly a week of performances
at the Seattle International Children's Festival. True to its
reputation as one of the largest and most far-reaching arts
festivals for young people in the country, the program last week
succeeded in bringing a striking array of troupes from around the
world. Among the performers were the Ho Chi Minh City Water Puppet
Theater from Vietnam; the Lakota Sioux Indian Theater; the Bustan
Abraham contemporary ensemble, featuring Jewish and Arab musicians
from Israel; and the B'net Marrakech, a music and dance troupe from
Morocco.
</P>
<P>
   But no group generated more attention than the Rwandan dancers,
and none seemed to carry a stronger message for old and young alike
that ``dance can make everybody more peace-loving,'' in the words
of Buregeya Deo, 33, one of the 15 dancers in the group, formally
known as Imparage: The Hutus, Tutsis and Pygmies of Rwanda. (The
Pygmies are also known as Twa.)
</P>
<P>
   The group is a unit of Rwanda's national ballet, whose origins
date to 1974, but which was torn apart, as was most everything else
in the nation, by the roughly 100 days of insanity six years ago,
when many Tutsi and moderate Hutu were killed by Hutu extremists.
Most current members of the ballet were refugees, and many had
family members killed.
</P>
<P>
   There was, then, some irony in the fact that the dancers agreed
to end their American visit with a trip to the women's prison here,
which was arranged by festival organizers, prison officials and Pat
Graney, a Seattle choreographer who runs an arts program, called
Keeping the Faith, for imprisoned women.
</P>
<P>
   And even though the dances, many focusing on harvest and
courtship themes, involved exuberant and even joyous outbursts of
singing and foot-stamping, there were at least small signs that
fear and tension persist.
</P>
<P>
   As this reporter conducted an interview Thursday after the
prison performance, one of the Rwandan dancers gently touched his
arm when she saw him write the word ``Hutu'' in his notebook. ``Why
did you write `Hutu' in there?'' she wanted to know. Reading back
part of what she had just said to him, he replied, ``All our people
are Rwandese _ not Hutu, not Tutsi, Rwandese.'' Yes, she nodded
vigorously, that was the point she wanted to make.
</P>
<P>
   Some dancers, the Rwandan officials accompanying them said,
probably have relatives in prison for the 1994 slaughter. There was
intense mutual curiosity during a discussion after the dancers,
many dressed in flowing bleached headdresses, performed. Some
dancers said they found maximum-security conditions for the women
here preferable to the prison-like circumstances they had endured
in refugee camps.
</P>
<P>
   The discussion was animated, despite being slowly translated
back and forth into English, French and Kinyarwanda, the Rwandan
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do have our own war going on in America right now,'' one of
the inmates said. But just as she started to explain, another
inmate cut in, saying, ``I'm sure our war is nothing compared to
yours.''
</P>
<P>
   Since recreating their ruined costumes and drums and finding a
new home in Kigali, the Rwandan capital, the dancers have appeared
in several European countries and in South Africa. Plans for their
trip here started when the Seattle festival's producing director,
Brian Faker, saw them last summer in Belgium.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally fell in love with it,'' Faker said of the African
dances, which deal with folklore but not with the tragedy of the
genocide _ not yet, anyway. ``And it's exactly the kind of program
we want to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month Paul Kagame took the oath of office as Rwanda's first
Tutsi president, calling on all Rwandans to shun ethnic divisions,
and the nation's director of folklore and ballet, Bernardin
Rutazibwa, who came with the dancers, said he hoped they could help
spread that appeal, and that they would make more visits to the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just would like to show the world that we are not as
disunited as people might think,'' Rutazibwa said. ``And I think
this is more eloquent than a bunch of political speeches.''

SERBIA'S DIVIDED OPPOSITION CAN NOT AGREE ON PLAN OF ACTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (ADDS 7th graf with government ordering and early end of spring
semester)   
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE, Yugoslavia _ The leaders of the democratic opposition
in Serbia are divided about how to respond to the government's
seizure of the main opposition television station, undercutting
their credibility and damaging the image of unity they are trying
to project to voters and the West.
</P>
<P>
   There are sharp internal arguments about the dangers of a
confrontation with the government of Slobodan Milosevic, the
Yugoslav president. Some leaders favor a more systematic program of
civil disobedience, including hunger strikes. Others press for a
negotiated settlement with Milosevic that might bring early
elections under fairer conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The seizure of the television station, Studio B (including Radio
B2-92's transmission facility in Belgrade), and the continuing
attack on the independent print media have also opened new
divisions about the wisdom of taking part in local and federal
elections when they are called, probably this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   The smaller parties grouped in the Alliance for Change generally
favor going to elections in any conditions. But the largest
opposition party, the Serbian Renewal Movement of Vuk Draskovic,
now says in internal debates that it would be impossible to take
part in elections under these conditions, say political leaders who
spoke on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   In general, these leaders said, Draskovic _ who had sworn to
defend Studio B, which he controlled and which was lavish in its
coverage of him and his party _ is opposed to any plan of
confrontation that would give Milosevic a further pretext for a
general crackdown. Already, the government says it is drafting a
new law on terrorism that could be used to detain individuals for
60 days without charges. It is also drafting a new law banning
foreign financing for nongovernmental organizations here, which
tend to promote democracy, human rights and civil society.
</P>
<P>
   The popular student movement, Otpor, or Resistance, is pressing
for civil disobedience, including the blocking of roads and a halt
to urban services like water, electricity, transport and garbage
collection.
</P>
<P>
   Fearing student unrest, the government Thursday ordered all
universities to end the spring semester on Friday, a week ahead of
schedule, and banned student gatherings on campus. In protest,
student leaders have called a major rally for Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier in the week, Zoran Djindjic, leader of the Democratic
Party, the largest within the Alliance for Change coalition, has
also called for civil disobedience. Draskovic is allied to the
Alliance but is not a member.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic is said to be concerned for two reasons. First, that a
tired, depressed, poor population will not follow the political
opposition's call to arms, and second, that a growing crisis would
favor the Serbian deputy prime minister, Vojislav Seselj, the head
of the nationalist Radical Party. Draskovic apparently believes
that a deal, with Russian pressure, may still be possible with
Milosevic's Socialists.
</P>
<P>
   But some other leaders believe that Draskovic is simply afraid
to lose control over Belgrade and its lucrative concessions, and
that he would rather do a deal with Milosevic, still hoping to
succeed him, than confront him and risk arrest. ``He's trading
Studio B for kiosks,'' one leader said bitterly.
</P>
<P>
   Draskovic, Djindjic and Vojislav Kostunica of the Democratic
Party of Serbia, are scheduled to travel to Moscow on Monday, to
seek Russian support. They intend to ask the Russian government of
President Vladimir Putin to press Milosevic for the return of
Studio B and early, democratic elections on all levels, said a
Draskovic adviser. Predrag Simic.
</P>
<P>
   ``Moscow has leverage over both the regime and the opposition
and is in a good position to mediate,'' Simic said.
</P>
<P>
   In a meeting Monday, opposition leaders disagreed even about the
wisdom of having the large rally in Belgrade they announced for
Saturday. The rally will go ahead, but the opposition leaders say
they have not agreed on a plan of action to announce there.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the worst of both worlds,'' one leader said. ``Some
argued that if we're not willing to fight hard with civil
disobedience, using local city councils under our control, then we
should just cancel the rally and say so, and then put our resources
into preparing for elections. But we're going ahead with the rally
with nothing new to say.''
</P>
<P>
   The problem for the opposition is also its strength. There are
16 leaders from a wide variety of parties of varying size.
Inevitably, joint decisions are ``lowest common denominator,''
another leader said.
</P>
<P>
   But given that Draskovic controls the largest party, with the
most votes, any concerted program of civil disobedience or
electioneering is less likely to succeed without him, said a leader
of the Alliance for Change.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the Alliance, who generally favor a more robust
challenge to the regime and participation in elections under almost
any circumstances, are considering whether to distance themselves
from Draskovic. That might help them refurbish their credibility
with some in the electorate, but it would also weaken the image of
unity that voters, who generally dislike the Milosevic government,
find attractive.
</P>
<P>
   A third opposition group, led by former army generals and
government officials who have broken with Milosevic, is trying to
distance itself from the Draskovic-Alliance squabbling.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Clinton administration and the European Union have pressed
the opposition hard, in part through the aid they provide, to stick
together. After last summer's efforts to oust Milosevic through
daily rallies failed _ rallies Draskovic opposed _ the West came to
a consensus that elections were the best way to undermine Milosevic
and oust him.
</P>
<P>
   But the seizure of Studio B and increasing pressure against the
independent daily newspapers Blic and Glas Javnosti have made
Draskovic question the idea of taking part in any elections. While
such a position could change _ elections haven't been called _ his
position is a reversal of 1997, when Djindjic boycotted Serbian
elections against U.S. advice and Draskovic took part, validating
the vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have made it clear they don't want civil war,'' said a
Draskovic adviser. ``Free and fair elections are the best means to
overthrow Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   But one Alliance leader said, ``This is another gift for
Milosevic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are too many people who think they can be the Serbian
Putin and get power through a deal,'' he said, mentioning
Draskovic, Djindjic and Seselj. ``And there are some opposition
politicians who are politically dead but don't know it yet.''

BUSH TO SKIP TEXAS CONVENTION OF REPUBLICANS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By R.G. RATCLIFFE 
c.2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Texas Gov. George W. Bush plans to skip next
month's Republican State Convention in Houston, four years after
the party denied him a governor's traditional role of leading the
state delegation to the GOP national convention.
</P>
<P>
   And while a presumptive presidential nominee usually gets a
state convention to name some delegates of his choice to the
national party convention, rules changes made by the Texas party
two years ago could deny Bush any say in who will attend the
national convention expected to nominate him for president.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Republican Party spokesman Robert Black was surprised to
learn Bush will not be at the state convention.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had assumed our governor would be attending our
convention,'' Black said this week.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's decision to campaign elsewhere during the June 15-17
gathering is evidence both of his confidence about winning Texas in
the fall and of his ongoing conflicts with the religious social
conservatives who dominate the state party and vex him at a
national level.
</P>
<P>
   As Bush tried to focus attention on a meeting with retired Gen.
Colin Powell on Thursday, the governor also had to defend himself
against an attack by James Dobson, president of the Colorado-based
conservative group Focus on the Family. Dobson accused Bush of
sacrificing the core principles of the Republican Party by refusing
to rule out selecting a running mate who favors abortion rights,
and by meeting last month with gay Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   The Log Cabin Republicans of Texas, a gay rights group, blasted
Texas GOP leadership Thursday for denying them a convention booth
at the state convention for the third time.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Labinski of Austin, president of the group, said Texas
Republican party leaders are ``out of touch with mainstream voters
and mainstream Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago, Bush admonished state party leaders to stop
``name-calling'' after a party executive said the Texas GOP did not
want ``a group of transvestites, cross-dressers or Log Cabins.''
</P>
<P>
   As to the governor's missing the convention this year, Bush
spokesman Karen Hughes said his schedule is built around winning
the presidency, not any past disagreements with Texas Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most finite resource you have in a campaign is a
candidate's time,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 160-some days between now and the election, and we are
trying on those days to reach out to voters who have not made up
their minds in the presidential campaign in key states,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes said Bush's schedule is not final but that the campaign
plans to have him in Kentucky and Florida during the Texas
Republican Convention. She said his wife, Laura, likely will speak
to the Texas gathering.
</P>
<P>
   Vice President Al Gore, the likely Democratic candidate, also
has not committed to speaking to his party's Texas state convention
June 9-10 in Fort Worth, but state party conventions in Georgia,
Montana, Wisconsin and Washington are competing for Gore's
attention that weekend. Bush and Gore are tied in Wisconsin and
Washington public opinion polls.
</P>
<P>
   As vice president and presidential candidate in 1988, the
governor's father spoke to the Texas GOP convention, but during his
1992 re-election campaign President Bush sent his wife, Barbara.
The president spoke later that summer at the Republican National
Convention in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1996 Texas GOP convention, Gov. Bush lost the
honorary national convention role as delegation chairman when
anti-abortion state convention delegates tried unsuccessfully to
block U.S. Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchison's appointment as an at-large
delegate to the GOP gathering in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchison and people selected by Bob Dole's presidential
campaign that year normally could have expected to be
rubber-stamped as national convention delegates. But anti-abortion
forces threatened to block the entire delegate list because
Hutchison was not viewed as fervent enough in her anti-abortion
beliefs.
</P>
<P>
   Bush supported Hutchison, who eked out a national convention
spot during a state convention vote. But the state convention gave
the delegation leadership slot to then-state party Chairman Tom
Pauken.
</P>
<P>
   Bush should have been expected to name delegates to this year's
Republican National Convention in Philadelphia. But changes made
two years ago in state party rules could deny Bush his choices as
well as the selection of any statewide officeholders, including
Hutchison.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Bush's uneasy truce with social conservatives has been tested by
his search for a running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Christian Coalition founder Pat Robertson and former
presidential candidate Gary Bauer have warned that if Bush picks a
vice presidential candidate who supports abortion rights, he might
find social conservatives staying home on election day.
</P>
<P>
   Dobson on Wednesday accused Bush of sacrificing the party's core
principles to appeal to swing voters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people believe the only way to win the White House is to
build a big tent, but if you stand for everything you stand for
nothing,'' Dobson said, calling for Bush to name an anti-abortion
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he appreciated Dobson's advice, but added that he is
an ``independent thinker'' and is getting advice from Republicans
of many different philosophies about whom he should pick as a
running mate.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing people are going to learn about me is I'm going to
make my decisions based on what I think is right for America,''
Bush said. ``And in all due respect to who you quoted (Dobson) and
others, I'm confident I can unite the party and lead us to
victory.''

NATIVE AMERICANS TO LAUNCH AD BLITZ OPPOSING SLADE GORTON
RE-ELECTION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Native American leaders in Washington state, aided by
money from Indian gaming interests across the country, are set to
launch a TV blitz aimed at defeating Republican Sen. Slade Gorton
in November.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign is aimed not only at removing Gorton, but in
showing that Indian leadership ``can make a difference'' and that
opposition to Indians' interests will have ``serious negative
consequences'' for a Senate or House member.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has opposed Native American groups on issues ranging from
fishing rights to law enforcement. He most recently clashed with
tribes on allocation of federal aid and tribal sovereignty over
non-Indians on reservations.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes apparently will concentrate on environmental and
health care issues that are not specifically identified as Indian
causes, because those issues got a better response in a recent
poll.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting ready to launch our campaign,'' said Ron Allen,
chairman of the Jamestown S'Klallam tribe on the Olympic Peninsula
and a leader of the recently formed First American Education
Project.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, a Republican, also is first vice president of the
National Congress of American Indians. He was on the state steering
committee for GOP Sen. John McCain's presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the First American Education Project has raised
between $125,000 and $150,000, but should be able to reach its goal
of $1 million to spend against Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians' initial anti-Gorton TV ads are expected to air in
Spokane next month, said Russ Lehman, managing director of the
education project.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton responded in a telephone interview that he is ``not
surprised'' at the Indians' effort and noted that tribes have
``been talking about doing this for an extended time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a total right to do what they want in the political
world,'' Gorton said. ``I have a very good record on supporting the
appropriate ambitions of Indian peoples, but I will continue to
fiercely protect the rights of their non-Indian neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they don't like that, they have every right to try to beat
me,'' he said. ``They are not going to succeed.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton, 72, has clashed with tribes since he was state attorney
general. He went to the Supreme Court seeking to overturn the 1974
Boldt decision, a federal court ruling that treaty Indians are
entitled to half the salmon and steelhead returning to rivers in
the Puget Sound basin.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has defended non-Indians who own land on the Lummi
Reservation near Bellingham in a water rights dispute with the
tribal government.
</P>
<P>
   In a controversial 1998 proposal, Gorton sought to strip tribal
governments of sovereign immunity, opening tribes to liability for
breach of contracts or other forms of unlawful conduct.
</P>
<P>
   Lehman described Gorton as ``the most vociferous opponent of
tribal sovereignty that Congress has seen in 40 years.''
</P>
<P>
   In a recent session with Northwest reporters in Washington,
D.C., Gorton described his position by saying: ``Indians have a
perfect right to govern their own internal affairs, but in my view
they don't have a right to govern the affairs of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Gorton has, however, helped tribes get money for some projects.
In a letter last week, the Qiuleute Tribal Council on the Olympic
Peninsula sent the senator a letter of thanks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Without your support, the Quileute Reservation's only access
road and water supply would be in imminent damger of loss from
flooding of the Bogachiel River,'' the tribe told Gorton.
</P>
<P>
   But hostility toward tribal sovereignty has made Gorton an
anathema to many Indian leaders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am still very much of the Republican persuasion, but this
man is doing a terrible job, and not only on Indian issues,'' Allen
said.
</P>
<P>
   In late April, a statewide poll of likely general election
voters was conducted for the First American Education Project. Done
by the Seattle-based firm of Evans-McDonough, it interviewed 500
voters and found only 41 percent of them likely to vote for
Gorton's re-election. The poll had a margin of error of 4.4
percent.
</P>
<P>
   The poll tested a variety of issues for use against Gorton,
notably his sponsorship of a Senate amendment aimed at clearing the
way for construction of a controversial gold mine in Okanogan
County.
</P>
<P>
   ``The most persuasive arguments against Gorton are his tireless
efforts in support of the Texas-based Battle Mountain mining
company and his vote against a strong patients' bill of rights,''
the poll concluded.
</P>
<P>
   ``The two messages that were specifically about Gorton's
anti-Indian record ranked near the bottom in terms of
persuasiveness. ... The main campaign message will have to be more
broad based to be effective,'' it added.
</P>
<P>
   The tribes are taking the poll's advice. Initial TV ads in
Spokane are likely to concentrate on Gorton's role in the gold
mine, Lehman said. The Colville Indian Nation has been a leading
opponent of the mine.
</P>
<P>
   The First American Education Project was formed by Washington
tribal leaders last year. They have lately used the poll to appeal
for money at conferences of Indians' national gaming association,
and the California Indian Nations Gaming Association.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have been trying to leverage the support that we need for
the campaign,'' Allen said.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is very important to us,'' Lehman added. ``The U.S.
Senate is a national body, and actions by its members affect the
state of California as much as ourselves here.''
</P>
<P>
   California tribes spent more than $100 million on two recent
initiative campaigns. In March, voters approved an amendment to the
state constitution that gives Native Americans exclusive rights to
operate gambling casinos in California.
</P>
<P>
   However, some Indian tribes have reportedly voiced reservations,
fearing high-profile involvement in the anti-Gorton effort could
fuel a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   The First American Education Project will not get involved in
the Democratic Senate primary between former Rep. Maria Cantwell
and State Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both of the current opposition candidates are significantly
better on issues than Gorton,'' Lehman said.

 RICHARD BLOCH, A COMPUTER PIONEER, IS DEAD
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID WARSH  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
<TEXT>
 &QL;
<P>
   BOSTON _ Richard M. Bloch, who helped design and program the
first automatic digital computer, has died at age 78.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bloch, of Marlborough, Mass., died Monday of cancer in Oak
Knoll Healthcare Center in Framingham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   As chief operations officer at Harvard University's Computation
Laboratory, he played a key role in the development of the Mark I
digital computer. And his inventions included the standard
procedure for automatic error detection known as parity check, used
in virtually all computers, as well as barcode technology for
computerized scanning of information.
</P>
<P>
   He also developed some of the first applications of computers to
online processing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was a legend of the business, a wonderful, graceful man,''
John Cullinane, founder of Cullinet Software, said Thursday. ``He
co-authored papers with John von Neumann. He taught programming to
Grace Hopper, who later invented COBOL (an early computer
language). He was 21. She was 43.''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bloch was born in Rochester, N.Y., the son of Harry and
Tillie Bloch, owners of a printing business. He attended Harvard
College on full scholarship and became captain of its golf team.
After graduation in 1943 he served as a lieutenant in the Navy,
then returned to Harvard after the war as a research associate in
its engineering division.
</P>
<P>
   There followed a series of jobs in Boston's growing computer
industry: general manager of the computer division at Raytheon
Corp., vice president for technical operations at Honeywell Inc.,
vice president for corporate development at Auerbach Corp., vice
president of the advanced systems division at General Electric Co.
</P>
<P>
   He was a director of Cullinet, and chairman and CEO of
Artificial Intelligence Corp., Niche Data Systems, and Meiko
Scientific Corp.
</P>
<P>
   A longtime resident of Newton, Mr. Bloch summered every year in
West Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   He leaves his wife of 40 years, Ruth, and seven children:
Charlote Johnson Zembko of Bolton; Lawrence of Belmont; Emily
Martin of Bolton; Debra Ellingwood of Framingham; Susan
Bloch-Nevitte of Toronto; Kathryn Swarts of Houston; and Richard of
Huntington Beach, Calif.; and eight grandchildren.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After four months of conservation and restoration,
the Metropolitan Museum of Art has hung a recent acquisition: ``The
Lamentation'' by the Italian Baroque painter Ludovico Carracci.
</P>
<P>
   The museum bought the painting for $5.2 million at Christie's in
January. The price was huge, considering that the estimate had been
$300,000 to $500,000. But at auction all it takes is two serious
bidders, and in this case the Met's competition was the Museum of
Fine Arts in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   Painted around 1582, ``The Lamentation'' is a sprawling image of
Jesus that stretches the full width of the canvas, which measures
37{ by 68 inches. Not only are works by Carracci rare, but the
painting itself is also considered exceptional.
</P>
<P>
   ``It marks the beginning of the Baroque,'' said Andrea Bayer,
assistant curator of European paintings at the Met. ``The
naturalist treatment of the body of Christ is incredible and was
painted from a live studio model.''
</P>
<P>
   The painting had been in a South American collection, with no
artist's attribution. But when it arrived at Christie's, Anthony
Crichton-Stuart, head of the old master paintings department,
noticed that ``there were two old labels on the back marked Palazzo
Tanari in Bologna,'' he said. ``Alessandro Tanari, who died in
1639, was an important collector of contemporary Bolognese
painting.''
</P>
<P>
   Crichton-Stuart said the painting was stylistically similar to
others by Carracci, most notably in the angular faces, the
exaggerated perspective and the coloration.
</P>
<P>
   The Met already has four paintings by Annibale Carracci, the
artist's far better-known cousin. This is its first painting by
Ludovico. The museum is organizing ``The Beginning of Baroque:
Carracci at the Metropolitan,'' which is to open on July 7 and will
include paintings, drawings and prints.
</P>
<P>
   KOONS REDUX
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Koons, the 1980s art star who drifts on and off the art
world's radar screen, is making yet another comeback. Prices for
his work have been soaring: one collector paid $1.8 million at
Christie's in November for a porcelain sculpture of a seminude
blond woman hugging a Pink Panther. Last week another paid $1.7
million there for a sculpture of a woman sitting in a bubble bath
clutching her breasts.
</P>
<P>
   Another Koons creation, a 43-foot-tall terrier puppy made of
live flowers, is being installed at the site in Rockefeller Center
where the Christmas tree stands every year. Thursday
``Split-Rocker,'' a 40-foot-tall topiary _ half pony, half dino _
with 75,000 live flowers in the shape of a giant child's rocking
toy was unveiled in the Benoit XII Cloister in the Papal Palace in
Avignon, France.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a while everybody wanted to know what happened to Jeff,''
said Lisa Dennison, deputy director and chief curator of the
Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, who has been closely involved with
Koons' work. For years the museum has been planning a major Koons
retrospective. It was unofficially scheduled for this month, then
officially announced for next May. Now, Dennison said, the
Guggenheim hopes to hold the exhibition in the fall of 2003 or the
winter of 2004.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the delays have been due to the high costs of
fabrication and technical difficulties in making the works that are
part of ``Celebration,'' a series of large-scale sculptures and
paintings. Because of their size and the materials _ stainless
steel and plastics that are hard to manufacture _ they require
special use of foundries, a cost that has nearly bankrupted some
dealers who hoped to produce the pieces.
</P>
<P>
   Koons wanted to finish the ``Celebration'' series before the
retrospective, Dennison said. He also wanted to have a body of new
work that could be shown for the first time at the Guggenheim.
</P>
<P>
   Several months ago Koons returned to the Sonnabend Gallery,
which has handled him on and off since 1986. In November the
gallery showed some of his ``Easyfun'' series, a dozen large tinted
mirrors based on generic cartoon animals, including a sheep, a
donkey, a bear, a kangaroo and a cow. Now Sonnabend is working with
galleries in Europe to present a series of ``Easyfun'' shows that
also include paintings and one sculpture. The shows are to be in
London, Berlin, Paris and Milan. Larry Gagosian is also planning a
show of Koons' work in his Los Angeles space in March.
</P>
<P>
   Opening on Oct. 26 at the Deutsche Guggenheim Berlin will be a
show of several new paintings commissioned for that space. ``The
work will probably travel to Bilbao,'' Dennison said. ``Then it
will enter the collection of the Guggenheim Museum and Deutsche
Bank.''
</P>
<P>
   `WE'RE COOKING'
</P>
<P>
   Although it has been 15 months since P.S. 1 and the Museum of
Modern Art announced their intention to merge, the deal was
approved by the New York State Board of Regents only a month ago,
and the two institutions met just last week to approve a new board.
It has 27 members: 18 nominated by PS 1 and approved by the Modern,
and 9 nominated by the Modern and approved by PS 1. ``The deal is
done,'' said Glenn D. Lowry, director of the Modern. ``We're open
for business and we're cooking.''
</P>
<P>
   RETIRE? HARDLY &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Michael Findlay has taken early retirement after 16 years at
Christie's. But that doesn't mean he plans to stop working. William
Acquavella announced this week that Findlay, whose most recent job
at Christie's was international director of fine arts, would become
the director of the Acquavella Galleries on East 79th Street in
Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   The new post will entail buying and selling art, Acquavella
said, as well as helping with the administration of the gallery.
``I'm ready to concentrate on a smaller number of paintings and a
smaller number of collectors,'' Findlay said.
</P>
<P>
   Much of his work at Christie's involved working with dealers and
collectors in Southeast Asia. ``He was our ambassador there,'' said
Edward Dolman, Christie's chief executive worldwide. Replacing him
in Asia will be Toshihiko Hatanaka, who works for Christie's in
Tokyo.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It was just past closing time at the Wendy's on Main
Street in Flushing, Queens. Two men, one short and one tall,
knocked at the locked front door, calling out for the manager by
name.
</P>
<P>
   The manager, 27-year-old Jean Dumel Auguste, seemed to know the
men, and he led at least one of them down to the store basement
where he kept a small office near the employee changing rooms and a
large walk-in refrigerator-freezer.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, Auguste used the store's intercom system to
summon his small night crew down into the basement for a meeting.
Six employees made their way down the back stairs into the cool,
musty basement.
</P>
<P>
   It was a death trap.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, on one of the busiest strips in Queens, a
massacre began to unfold _ a crime so grisly, so ruthless that it
left some of the city's most experienced homicide investigators
sickened. When it was over Wednesday night, all seven employees had
been shot, all of them at close range, all in the head. Five were
killed, including Auguste. A sixth was fighting for his life
Thursday night, and the seventh survived, his cheeks pierced by a
bullet.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the most horrendous crime scene I've ever witnessed in
my nine years as district attorney of this county, and as people
know, I've been to a lot of crime scenes,'' Richard Brown, the
Queens district attorney, said Thursday, as hundreds of police
officers hunted the city for two suspects, and as relatives,
stricken with shock and grief, gathered at a nearby Sheraton Hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said the crime appeared to have been carefully
planned and timed, and they focused their initial investigation on
former Wendy's employees. Indeed, customers said that in the
moments before the restaurant's closing time, there was no hint at
all of what was to come.
</P>
<P>
   A young couple sat at a front table, quietly finishing their
food. One employee went about emptying trash bins. Others were
wiping down tables and counters. At 10:55 p.m., a regular walked in
and ordered one of the night's last meals, a junior bacon
cheeseburger, a baked potato with sour cream and chives and a
salad.
</P>
<P>
   By 11 p.m., the store was empty but for seven employees, and the
front door was locked. In the most haunting disclosure,
investigators said that a passing police officer tried to stop in
for a hamburger shortly after closing time but was shooed away. A
senior police official said the officer reported that he was waved
away by a man and a woman standing at the door.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's very possible that could have been the robber
standing there with the female,'' the official said. ``The cop
tells us there is a guy and a girl standing at the door saying
we're closed. His sense was they seemed friendly. But could he have
been standing there with a gun at her back? It's possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Once in the basement, the employees _ Ramon Nazario, 44; Anita
C. Smith, 23; Jeremy Mele, 18, Ali Ibadat, 40; Patrick Castro, 23,
and Jaquione Johnson, 18 _ were quickly subdued at gunpoint, police
officials said. The gunmen used duct tape to bind hands behind
backs and gag mouths. At some point, plastic bags were slipped over
the heads of all seven employees, and they were forced into the
large walk-in unit that combines a refrigerator section and freezer
section. And then they began to shoot, apparently determined to
leave no witnesses to their theft of as much as $2,000.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear Thursday night how the men made their getaway.
Police officials said they believed that the two men might have
slipped out a side door after stealing the manager's keys. But a
woman at a nearby bus stop also told the police she saw two men
leave from the front door.
</P>
<P>
   Over the next 90 minutes or so, two of the wounded, Castro and
Johnson, worked themselves free. Castro called 911 from a basement
telephone connected to the fax machine in the manager's office.
``We're in the basement,'' he managed to say, despite the bullet
wound to his cheeks. ``We're locked in.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson considered Castro his closest friend at Wendy's,
Johnson's family said. The two sometimes walked home together. Now,
Castro dragged Johnson upstairs, where they waited for the police
by the front counter. Johnson, who had a bullet lodged near the top
of his skull, was in Castro's arms. According to police
investigators, Castro was in such a daze that he did not even
realize he had been shot in the mouth.
</P>
<P>
   The first officers arrived at 12:52 a.m. The first paramedics
arrived a minute later. Seeing two wounded men inside, the officers
smashed through the glass of the locked front door.
</P>
<P>
   As Johnson and Castro were taken to a hospital, the officers
followed a trail of blood down the stairs to the basement, where
they confronted the carnage. There was blood everywhere _ on the
walls, on the floor, on boxes of food. Four of the employees were
already dead. A fifth died on the way to New York Hospital Medical
Center in Queens.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first Emergency Medical Service paramedics on the
scene described his reaction to a superior. ``He said to me, `You
trained for this, you're prepared for this. But you're never
prepared for this. These were kids. They were teen-agers. This was
a massacre.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials said they believed the weapon used was a
.380-calibre semiautomatic handgun. Police said they were unsure
whether more than one was used in the attack.

 &HT;    Key witness, conflicting testimony
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Limousine driver Duane Fassett, billed as the state's
star prosecution witness in the Buckhead stabbings case, sighed
audibly several times as he testified Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe that was the air going out of the prosecution's murder
case against NFL star Ray Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett, a slight, haggard-looking man and clearly a reluctant
witness, failed to deliver several key pieces of testimony
prosecutors had expected against Lewis, 25, and co-defendants
Reginald Oakley, 31, and Joseph Sweeting, 34. The three men are
charged with stabbing to death Richard Lollar, 24, and Jacinth
Baker, 21, after a night of Super Bowl partying in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   In previous statements to police, Fassett told investigators he
saw Lewis deliver a blow to the midsection of one of the victims
and that he heard Oakley come back to the limousine and say, ``I
stabbed mine,'' and Sweeting say, ``I stabbed mine, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard played off the
expected drama of the limo driver's description of the punch Lewis
allegedly delivered to Lollar by displaying a swinging uppercut
during his opening statements to the jury Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But when questioned Thursday by Howard, Fassett described a
completely different action. Demonstrating what he saw, Fassett
cocked his fist back over his head _ then said, ``I didn't see him
throw the punch; I didn't see it land.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassett also said that when Lewis raised his hand, the Baltimore
Ravens linebacker was trying to break up the fight. ``Knock that
(expletive) off,'' Fassett recalled Lewis as saying. He said Lewis
repeatedly tried to get his friends back into the limo before
things got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   At least twice, Howard asked Fassett about what Sweeting and
Oakley said when they were in the limo, driving away. Each time,
Fassett said he did not recall.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' lead defense attorney, Ed Garland, was clearly overjoyed
by Fassett's reluctance and cross-examined him for only two
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Fassett about three instances when Lewis told his
friends, ``Get back in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What he was doing was to stop there from being a problem,''
prompted Garland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' the witness responded quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Lewis didn't do anything to cause, aid or encourage
anybody to stab anyone with a knife, did he?'' the attorney asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sir, not that I could see. Not at all,'' responded Fassett.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all the questions I have,'' said Garland.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom, packed for Fassett's long-anticipated testimony,
resounded with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, during a break, Assistant District Attorney Clint
Rucker said to a reporter, ``He's wrestling with it; look at him.
He doesn't want to hurt his friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, at the end of the day, Howard dwelled on the positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it went well,'' the prosecutor said. ``He explained
what happened, what happened afterwards, the cover-up. He was
stronger than I thought he was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard said he planned to try to get into the record the highly
incriminating statements Fassett allegedly overheard Oakley and
Sweeting make through the upcoming testimony of Atlanta Police
Detective Ken Allen, who headed the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Possible witnesses to come include limo passengers Jessica
Robertson, Keiva Wells and Rehana Grant; Atlanta police Lt. Mike
Smith, who took a statement from Lewis in which the 24-year-old pro
football player lied to investigators; cab driver Patrick Ozonu;
and crime lab technicians who will trace the victims' blood from
the crime scene to Lewis' hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett's testimony comes on the heels of witness Jeff Gwen's
backing away from a statement to police that he, too, saw Lewis
throw a punch at Lollar. Instead, Gwen testified that Lewis and
Lollar were ``tussling,'' grabbing at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett and Gwen are the only two witnesses who told police they
saw Lewis throw a punch at either of the stabbing victims.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gwen finished testifying Thursday morning, Superior Court
Judge Alice D. Bonner scolded prosecutors for not notifying the
defense about Gwen's changed statement.
</P>
<P>
   Rucker contended there was no foul committed by prosecutors
because, he said, ``We did not hide it, conceal it, and we made the
witness available to the defense for interview.''
</P>
<P>
   The law requires that any evidence favorable to a defendant must
be turned over by prosecutors to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his testimony, Fassett looked almost ill. While he
was on the stand, his wife sat on a bench outside the courtroom and
wept. At the close of Fassett's testimony, the judge told him he
might be recalled. The former Army medic's body sagged; he buried
his face in his hands. Fassett then left the courtroom, sat down
next to his wife and sobbed. ``He was in a very rough, unenviable
position; he was just in agony because he loves Ray Lewis,'' said
David Irwin, Fassett's attorney. ``He was totally overtaken by
stress and nerves. He hadn't eaten and was running on only nicotine
and coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses' freezing up is not uncommon, said former Cobb County
District Attorney Tom Charron. ``Especially when you have a friend
of the defendant. You always brace for it,'' the former prosecutor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Spix, an Atlanta defense attorney who is monitoring the
trial for WXIA, said Fassett's testimony hurt the prosecution
because Howard promised jurors the limo driver would tell about
Lewis' punch and about his co-defendants' admitting to stabbing the
victims.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to say the death knell rang, but anyone watching
that knows there's trouble in River City,'' Spix volunteered. At
the same time, he added, Fassett did make a strong case against
Oakley and scored points against Sweeting.
</P>
<P>
   Howard also was able to elicit some testimony from Fassett that
appeared to be damaging to Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said that after the fracas he saw Lewis, Oakley and
Sweeting quickly walking back to the limousine from the
intersection where Lollar and Baker lay mortally wounded.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said at some point he heard the All-Pro linebacker say
that ``his football career wasn't going to end because of this.''
Fassett also admitted Thursday in court he had first told police he
didn't know who had rented the limo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why, Fassett responded, ``I was told to say nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who told you to say nothing?'' asked Howard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray,'' responded Fassett, sighing heavily and rubbing his
face.
</P>
<P>
   He said he opened up after police handcuffed him and took him in
for questioning. Fassett said he saw Oakley chase Baker and that he
was ``grabbing him by the back of his shirt and flipping him.''
Baker, he said, landed on his neck or head and then Oakley punched
him at least twice while he was on the ground.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett said he saw Sweeting struggle with a man prosecutors say
was Lollar. Lewis was standing near Lollar at the time, he
testified.
</P>
<P>
   Seconds later, Fassett said, he saw Sweeting punching one of the
victims while he was lying in the street.
</P>
<P>
   John Bergendahl, who represents Sweeting, highlighted numerous
inconsistences in Fassett's prior statements to the police.
</P>
<P>
   On Jan. 31, Fassett told police that ``everyone'' got out of the
limo when the fight began. Thursday, he said only Lewis, Oakley and
Sweeting left the limo.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you said today only three people got out of the limo,
that was incorrect, wasn't it?'' Bergendahl asked.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett, as he did on several occasions, paused long and hard
before answering. ``I forgot,'' he finally replied.
</P>
<P>
   Bergendahl reminded Fassett that he initially told police he
thought Sweeting struck one of the victims over the head with a
champagne bottle, when in fact it is now unrefuted that it was
Baker who cracked Oakley over the head with a Moet bottle.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were wrong about that, weren't you?'' Bergendahl asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things happened so fast that night,'' Fassett replied.
</P>
<P>
   ``You didn't know what was going on, did you?'' the lawyer
asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Correct,'' Fassett replied, letting out another audible sigh.

IT MIGHT BE HOT, BUT TRIATHLETES LIKE iRVING TEST 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.2000 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   IRVING, Texas _ This much we know. It has been months since
somebody spotted sharks in Las Colinas' Lake Carolyn.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, as visiting Olympic triathlon hopefuls have
probably noticed, it's not getting any cooler in North Texas. So,
choose your poison.
</P>
<P>
   Those who raised eyebrows when Irving was selected to be U.S.
triathlon's gateway to the Sydney Olympics are missing the prime
selling point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great course; very similar to Sydney,'' said San
Antonio native Jennifer Gutierrez, who has already qualified for
the U.S. team.
</P>
<P>
   There is no world famous opera house, such as the one from which
the triathletes will enter the water in Sydney. There is no
bustling harbor, as in Sydney with its reportedly shark-inhabited
waters.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, at the U.S. Olympic Triathlon Trials this weekend,
competitors will plunge into the relatively tranquil waters of a
manmade lake.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some contact; there's usually contact the whole
way,'' said Ryan Bolton of Colorado Springs, Colo., one of the
men's race favorites. ``It's part of the equation.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this should be a pretty fast swim. The lake there is going
to be almost like swimming in a cloudy swimming pool.''
</P>
<P>
   The triathletes will swim 1,500 meters, roughly nine-tenths of a
mile. For first-time triathlon watchers, the tansition area at the
corner of O'Connor Road and Las Colinas Boulevard will provide an
engaging show.
</P>
<P>
   ``You'll be absolutely amazed at how fast things happen in the
transition area,'' Bolton said. ``Transitions are free time. At
this level, every second is important.''
</P>
<P>
   The triathletes will emerge from Lake Carolyn and run to their
bike racks. They'll shed their goggles and swim cap as they're
putting on sunglasses and cycling helmet. Bolton swims in a
skin-tight jersey that he also wears during the 40-kilometer (24.8
miles) bike ride. Other triathletes stuff their jerseys into their
swimsuits and don them on the jog to the bike.
</P>
<P>
   There's no time to stop and slip on cycling shoes, so they are
already clipped into the bicycle's pedals. The triathletes begin
pedaling with their feet on top of the shoes and gradually slip
into them as they trek down the course.
</P>
<P>
   There is one tricky turn, where the cyclists are racing downhill
and have to negotiate a 90-degree turn from Mills Lane onto
MacArthur Boulevard. But the out-and-back stretch of MacArthur
should be fast _ ``It'll be screaming,'' Bolton predicted.
</P>
<P>
   On the final, running leg, the course sports three hills, the
most challenging of which is a straight up-and-down trek along
Goodson Drive that should serve two purposes. It will help separate
the field, and give the lead runners a sense of where they stand in
the pack.
</P>
<P>
   The 10K (6.2 miles) run will decide the race, and that's where
Bolton's strengths come in. At the University of Wyoming, he was an
All-American in cross country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm firing right now,'' said Bolton, who has been training for
the past month in Fort Worth. ``Everything is going perfect. In my
mind, I'm where I need to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Two places on the Olympic team are up for grabs for both the men
and women. nn

 NEW YORK: the attack. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   On Thursday morning, members of Jaquione Johnson's large family
filed into a hospital waiting room, pacing and awaiting word from
doctors, who were still operating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Doctors said he can't move his right side at all, but he has
sensation in it,'' his aunt, Regina Johnson, said. ``His teeth are
completely shattered.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally Joretta Johnson was allowed into the intensive care unit
see her son, nicknamed ``Fluff Love'' because his hair looks so
soft and fluffy when it is unbraided. Ms. Johnson, her eyes puffy
and red and tired, had been through something like this last year
when her older son was shot and seriously wounded. This time, she
turned to her family and said, ``I'm asking for everybody's
prayers.''
</P>
<P>
   At the restaurant, a co-worker, Olga Purdie, whose 2-9 shift
overlapped with the victims', rattled off their names and burst
into tears. ``Jean, Ramon, Ali, Jeremy, Anita, Jaquione,'' she
sobbed. ``They were my co-workers. They were my friends.''
</P>
<P>
   And Thursday night, two detectives were sent to Castro's home in
Queens to protect their leading witness in the case. ``We fear for
his life,'' one friend said.
</P>
<P>
   Brown, the district attorney, spent three hours at the scene and
promised ``a full court press'' to arrest the culprits. It was the
worst massacre in Queens since 1995, when six people were murdered
in a College Point condominium.
</P>
<P>
   But in the Flushing area, considered by many to be the cultural
heart of the borough, the residents, almost to a person, say they
feel safer there than when they travel to any other part of New
York.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the shadow of Manhattan's skyscrapers, Flushing in the
last 20 years has become one of the city's most dynamic business
districts, with scores of stores and foreign banks and crowded
sidewalks, having supplanted Chinatown in Manhattan as the city's
Asian hub.
</P>
<P>
   It is considered a good, safe place to live. People go here to
make money, not problems, residents say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up here my whole life,'' said James Deleon, 23, a City
Council aide. ``It's New York that works. It's everything good
about the city without the bad. We worry about traffic problems and
garbage pickup, not two murderers on the loose.''
</P>
<P>
   At Wendy's, city workers pumped out sewer lines, searching for a
weapon, clothing, anything at all that might be a clue. Police dogs
and their handlers methodically searched for some faint scent of
the gunmen. A police van circled the neighborhood, its speakers
blasting pleas for witnesses to come forward.
</P>
<P>
   A police helicopter hovered and, for reasons authorities would
not disclose, officers searched for a green 1994 Nissan Maxima.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said they believed that one of the gunmen had
either worked at the restaurant or knew someone who did. ``They
knew too much about Wendy's and how things worked there,'' one
official said.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement officials said they were pursuing several
possible suspects, including one 36-year-old man, a former
employee, who was arrested last summer in connection with a robbery
at a McDonald's in Queens. Other former Wendy's employees were also
potential suspects, investigators said.
</P>
<P>
   Police officials offered this description of the gunmen: One was
said to be a black man in his 20s, about 6 feet tall, who was
wearing brown sweat pants and a brown sweatshirt. The other was
described as a black man in his 30s, about 5 feet 5 inches tall,
who was wearing a black jacket and blue jeans. The leading suspect,
whose driver's license lists him as 5 foot 5, has been identified
by at least one witness from an array of police mug shot. Another
witness, however, could not identify the man.
</P>
<P>
   Ed Choe, a vice president for Wendy's, said the Flushing store
had been open for about two years and had never been robbed before
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Several factors hampered investigators Thursday. A security
camera surveyed the front counter area of the store, but its
videotape was missing.
</P>
<P>
   The sound of gunfire may have been muffled by work crews who
were jack-hammering a sidewalk just four doors away. ``I heard
nothing because of the construction,'' said Muhammed Khalid,
manager of the Flushing News Outlet, also four doors away. ``Only
after the cops came did we learn of the shootings.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, law enforcement officials said they had more than
enough leads to pursue, and they expressed confidence that they
would soon make arrests.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be today, it may be tomorrow, it may be later,'' one
senior law enforcement official said Thursday, ``but we will get
these guys. If we can't catch guys like this, then shame on us.''

 &HT;    Key witness, conflicting testimony
 &HT;    By Bill Torpy and Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Limousine driver Duane Fassett, billed as the state's
star prosecution witness in the Buckhead stabbings case, sighed
audibly several times as he testified Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe that was the air going out of the prosecution's murder
case against NFL star Ray Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett, a slight, haggard-looking man and clearly a reluctant
witness, failed to deliver several key pieces of testimony
prosecutors had expected against Lewis, 25, and co-defendants
Reginald Oakley, 31, and Joseph Sweeting, 34. The three men are
charged with stabbing to death Richard Lollar, 24, and Jacinth
Baker, 21, after a night of Super Bowl partying in Buckhead.
</P>
<P>
   In previous statements to police, Fassett told investigators he
saw Lewis deliver a blow to the midsection of one of the victims
and that he heard Oakley come back to the limousine and say, ``I
stabbed mine,'' and Sweeting say, ``I stabbed mine, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Fulton County District Attorney Paul Howard played off the
expected drama of the limo driver's description of the punch Lewis
allegedly delivered to Lollar by displaying a swinging uppercut
during his opening statements to the jury Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But when questioned Thursday by Howard, Fassett described a
completely different action. Demonstrating what he saw, Fassett
cocked his fist back over his head _ then said, ``I didn't see him
throw the punch; I didn't see it land.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassett also said that when Lewis raised his hand, the Baltimore
Ravens linebacker was trying to break up the fight. ``Knock that
(expletive) off,'' Fassett recalled Lewis as saying. He said Lewis
repeatedly tried to get his friends back into the limo before
things got out of hand.
</P>
<P>
   At least twice, Howard asked Fassett about what Sweeting and
Oakley said when they were in the limo, driving away. Each time,
Fassett said he did not recall.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' lead defense attorney, Ed Garland, was clearly overjoyed
by Fassett's reluctance and cross-examined him for only two
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   He asked Fassett about three instances when Lewis told his
friends, ``Get back in the car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What he was doing was to stop there from being a problem,''
prompted Garland.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' the witness responded quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray Lewis didn't do anything to cause, aid or encourage
anybody to stab anyone with a knife, did he?'' the attorney asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``No sir, not that I could see. Not at all,'' responded Fassett.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's all the questions I have,'' said Garland.
</P>
<P>
   The courtroom, packed for Fassett's long-anticipated testimony,
resounded with laughter.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later, during a break, Assistant District Attorney Clint
Rucker said to a reporter, ``He's wrestling with it; look at him.
He doesn't want to hurt his friend.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, at the end of the day, Howard dwelled on the positive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it went well,'' the prosecutor said. ``He explained
what happened, what happened afterwards, the cover-up. He was
stronger than I thought he was going to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard said he planned to try to get into the record the highly
incriminating statements Fassett allegedly overheard Oakley and
Sweeting make through the upcoming testimony of Atlanta Police
Detective Ken Allen, who headed the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Possible witnesses to come include limo passengers Jessica
Robertson, Keiva Wells and Rehana Grant; Atlanta police Lt. Mike
Smith, who took a statement from Lewis in which the 24-year-old pro
football player lied to investigators; cab driver Patrick Ozonu;
and crime lab technicians who will trace the victims' blood from
the crime scene to Lewis' hotel room.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett's testimony comes on the heels of witness Jeff Gwen's
backing away from a statement to police that he, too, saw Lewis
throw a punch at Lollar. Instead, Gwen testified that Lewis and
Lollar were ``tussling,'' grabbing at each other.
</P>
<P>
   Fassett and Gwen are the only two witnesses who told police they
saw Lewis throw a punch at either of the stabbing victims.
</P>
<P>
   Before Gwen finished testifying Thursday morning, Superior Court
Judge Alice D. Bonner scolded prosecutors for not notifying the
defense about Gwen's changed statement.
</P>
<P>
   Rucker contended there was no foul committed by prosecutors
because, he said, ``We did not hide it, conceal it, and we made the
witness available to the defense for interview.''
</P>
<P>
   The law requires that any evidence favorable to a defendant must
be turned over by prosecutors to the defense.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout his testimony, Fassett looked almost ill. While he
was on the stand, his wife sat on a bench outside the courtroom and
wept. At the close of Fassett's testimony, the judge told him he
might be recalled. The former Army medic's body sagged; he buried
his face in his hands. Fassett then left the courtroom, sat down
next to his wife and sobbed. ``He was in a very rough, unenviable
position; he was just in agony because he loves Ray Lewis,'' said
David Irwin, Fassett's attorney. ``He was totally overtaken by
stress and nerves. He hadn't eaten and was running on only nicotine
and coffee.''
</P>
<P>
   Witnesses' freezing up is not uncommon, said former Cobb County
District Attorney Tom Charron. ``Especially when you have a friend
of the defendant. You always brace for it,'' the former prosecutor
said.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Spix, an Atlanta defense attorney who is monitoring the
trial for WXIA, said Fassett's testimony hurt the prosecution
because Howard promised jurors the limo driver would tell about
Lewis' punch and about his co-defendants' admitting to stabbing the
victims.

   ``I'm not going to say the death knell rang, but anyone watching
that knows there's trouble in River City,'' Spix volunteered. At
the same time, he added, Fassett did make a strong case against
Oakley and scored points against Sweeting.

Fassett also admitted Thursday in court he had first told police he
didn't know who had rented the limo.
</P>
<P>
   Asked why, Fassett responded, ``I was told to say nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who told you to say nothing?'' asked Howard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ray,'' responded Fassett, sighing heavily and rubbing his
face.
</P>
<P>
   He said he opened up after police handcuffed him and took him in
for questioning. Fassett said he saw Oakley chase Baker and that he
was ``grabbing him by the back of his shirt and flipping him.''
Baker, he said, landed on his neck or head and then Oakley punched

AT&AMP;T CLEARS STEP IN BID TO PURCHASE MEDIAONE GROUP

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Justice Department approved AT&AMP;T's proposed
acquisition of the MediaOne Group Thursday, giving the telephone
giant control over more than a third of the nation's cable network
for television, high-speed Internet access and online telephone
service.
</P>
<P>
   The decision, which requires the companies to sell their
interest in Road Runner, the nation's second-largest cable Internet
service, clears a significant regulatory hurdle. The companies now
await a decision, expected soon, by the Federal Communications
Commission. The staff of the commission has raised concerns about
the companies having too much control over both cable systems and
programming. Federal regulations prohibit a company from owning
more than 30 percent of the nation's cable systems and by some
estimates, AT&AMP;T would control more than 40 percent once it
completed its purchase of MediaOne.
</P>
<P>
   Competitors and consumer groups have also asked the FCC to force
the sale of more assets to assure that the marketplace for cable
television, high-speed Internet access and online telephone service
remains competitive.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed merger was valued at $58 billion when it was
announced a year ago during a wave of consolidation in the
telecommunications and high-speed Internet markets. Those deals
have posed a particular challenge for antitrust regulators because
of the complex interlocking ownership interests between cable
operators, programmers and high-speed Internet service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Both AT&AMP;T, which will be the nation's largest cable operator
when it completes the purchase of MediaOne, and Time Warner, which
will be the second largest, share interests in the same high-speed
Internet and programming companies.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T, for instance, has a controlling interest in
Excite(AT)Home, the largest cable modem service, while MediaOne has
a substantial interest in Road Runner, the second-largest service.
Time Warner, which is being acquired by America Online, also has a
large interest in Road Runner. Moreover, MediaOne and Time Warner
have large interests in Time Warner Entertainment, a programming
and cable operating company.
</P>
<P>
   As its market share in the long-distance telephone business has
begun to erode, AT&AMP;T has embarked on a whirlwind of acquisitions to
transform itself into a company that will be able to offer
consumers a basket of services _ television, Internet service along
with local, long-distance and wireless telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, it has alarmed consumer groups and competitors
who are concerned that the the company is turning into an Internet
version of the powerhouse monopoly that it was before the
government broke it up 16 years ago. The critics have urged federal
officials to force AT&AMP;T to sell its interest in programming
operations and cable modem services.
</P>
<P>
   While officials at the Justice Department agreed with the
arguments over MediaOne's interest in Road Runner, they did not
find antitrust problems with other aspects of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``The merger as proposed would have had an anti-competitive
impact on the emerging broadband market,'' said Joel Klein, the
assistant attorney general in charge of the antitrust division.
``The divestiture assures that AT&AMP;T will not acquire undue leverage
in its dealings with broadband content providers, and American
consumers will be the ultimate beneficiaries.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's decision continues the Clinton
administration's policy of putting relatively few obstacles in the
way of the consolidation of the telecommunications market after its
deregulation in 1996. The administration has not blocked any major
deal, although it has begun to indicate that consolidation may have
reached its limits. Earlier this month, the staff of the Justice
Department's antitrust division recommended that it block the
proposed merger of WorldCom and Sprint. Federal regulators are also
considering the proposed AOL-Time Warner deal.
 &UR;  &LR; AT&AMP;T executives hailed the decision, which they said they had
anticipated from the moment the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Road Runner divestiture is an obligation we always assumed
we would face, and the decree proposes both a schedule and process
that are fair and feasible,'' said James Cicconi, AT&AMP;T's general
counsel. ``We expect to gain FCC approval of the merger shortly.
After that, our intention is to close the merger as quickly as we
can. Customers are clamoring for broadband, digital cable
television and choice in local phone service. Our acquisition of
MediaOne will greatly increase our ability to deliver all of those
highly sought consumer services.''
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups said the decision fell short of assuring
competition in the emerging market and urged the FCC to force the
companies to sell more assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an important first step, but we're disappointed that AT&AMP;T
was not also required to divest the cable systems and programming
they jointly own with the second-largest cable company, Time
Warner,'' said Gene Kimmelman, co-director of the Washington office
of Consumers Union.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the staff of the FCC recommended that, because AT&AMP;T
had such a large market share of cable systems, the company should
relinquish either some control over those systems or some of their
interests in programming. Staff officials suggested that could be
accomplished by measures like divesting its programming units,
Liberty Media and Rainbow Media Sports Holdings Inc., or MediaOne's
interest in Time Warner Entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   The commission, which is expected to issue its decision soon,
may adopt those recommendations, reject them or pursue another
course. But its hand in negotiating with AT&AMP;T was significantly
strengthened last Friday when a federal appeals court, reversing a
lower court decision, upheld the constitutionality of the
regulations that limit how much of the cable industry one company
may control.

<P>
   LIMA, Peru _ The government of President Alberto Fujimori said
Thursday that a runoff presidential election would be held on
Sunday as scheduled despite nationwide protests and calls from
Washington and other allies that it be postponed to assure a clean
ballot count.
</P>
<P>
   Unless reversed, the decision appeared to increase the
possibility of economic sanctions against Peru after it ignored the
recommendations of the Clinton administration, the Organization of
American States and several European and Latin American
governments.
</P>
<P>
   Within minutes of the announcement, violent clashes that had
left several people injured earlier in the day resumed, with
protesters setting fire to a balcony of the presidential palace and
hurling stones at the building and at the police, who responded
with tear gas.
</P>
<P>
   During intense negotiations all week, U.S. and Latin American
diplomats had urged Peruvian officials to delay the vote so a
computer system used to count the vote could be overhauled and
rechecked by independent auditors.
</P>
<P>
   A brief announcement that the National Elections Committee had
voted 3-2 to go forward with the election was met with shock by
international observers who had become increasingly hopeful that
Fujimori had decided to given in to international pressures.
 &UR;  &LR; ``We don't know if this is a final decision or if there is still
is the possibility of an opening.'' said Eduardo Stein, head of an
election observer team for the Organization of American States.
</P>
<P>
   But a senior U.S. Embassy official said he thought the decision
was final, adding, ``The U.S. government deeply regrets this
outcome. Even a relatively brief delay would have put the
Organization of American States in a position to speak to the
integrity of the election results.''
</P>
<P>
   Fujimori had appeared to be going back and forth on the election
scheduling during the past three days, but western diplomats said
that mounting protests had perhaps strengthened the hand of
hard-liners in the government.
</P>
<P>
   Just Wednesday night, Fujimori had said in an interview in the
government palace that ``the possibility for an adjustment of the
election date exists. We are in a fluctuating situation.'' It was
just one of several signs that Fujimori and his aides were
satisfied they could win the election at a later date and avert a
crisis in its foreign relations.
</P>
<P>
   The electoral crisis had been gathering momentum since Alejandro
Toledo, the opposition candidate, dropped out of the race last
Thursday, saying there was no reason to compete in a fraudulent
election. He said he would rejoin the contest if it were postponed
by several weeks, with guarantees for a free vote.
</P>
<P>
   Upon hearing Thursday's announcement, Toledo said, ``This will
bring Peru enormous instability, with totally unpredictable
political and economic consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   A wave of strikes and street demonstrations that followed
Toledo's withdrawal from the race peaked Thursday, and grew
increasingly violent.
</P>
<P>
   A small group of protesters attacked the offices of the National
Elections Commission, the highest government body that supervises
the elections, and broke windows and damaged a door with rocks,
pipes and at least one Molotov cocktail. Scores of people were
arrested in the northern jungle city of Iquitos for blocking roads,
and police used tear gas to clear protesters gathering in front of
the government palace here in the capital.
</P>
<P>
   Truck drivers and teachers staged a strike in the Andean city of
Cuzco, a Toledo stronghold. Bands of university students in Lima
and Arequipa repeatedly attacked riot police officers with stones,
and the police counterattacked with tear gas through much of the
day.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a growing number of influential businessmen had
warned that holding the uncontested election on Sunday could mean
years of economic sanctions and tensions with Washington that could
impede investment and growth. Their arguments were strengthened
through the week as Peruvian bond and stock prices dropped sharply
and foreign financial institutions issued risk warnings that
threatened to increase interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, the government's policies on the campaign and
political process have been inconsistent. Several television
stations allied with the government had begun airing Toledo
commercials and coverage of his rallies, while tabloid newspapers
thought to be directed by Fujimori's intelligence service has
softened their negative coverage of Toledo's personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, three unidentified men Wednesday night broke into
the offices of an opposition journalist said to hold incriminating
videotapes of Vladimiro Montesinos, Fujimori's intelligence chief,
meeting with election officials. The journalist, Fabian Salazar,
said the burglars tied him up and tortured him as they demanded
that he reveal his sources within the intelligence service who gave
him copies of the tapes that apparently were made by Montesinos
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Salazar said they cut through his left wrist to the bone with a
saw during their questioning. He was hospitalized after his
videotapes, archives and computer disks were stolen. Human rights
activists said Salazar's descriptions of his ordeal, which were
verified by doctors, may represent the worst example of torture in
Peru in at least two years.

MEDICAL SCHOOL HOLDS FIRM ON CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST RULES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD A. KNOX  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAMBRIDGE, Mass. _ Saying that Harvard Medical School ``is
taking the high road,'' its dean Thursday turned aside mounting
pressure from his faculty members to liberalize rules on how much
they may own in stock or reap in consulting fees.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Joseph B. Martin's decision cut short an 18-month internal
debate that many expected would result in relaxing the medical
school's conflict-of-interest rules for researchers after a faculty
meeting next week.
</P>
<P>
   Some members of a 16-member Harvard committee deliberating on
the issue said the dean told them he had been sobered by his
close-up view of a recent case at the University of Pennsylvania
involving the death of a young volunteer in a gene therapy
experiment. In that case, the head of Penn's gene therapy center
was also a founder and stockholder of the biotech company
sponsoring the human trial.
</P>
<P>
   Martin was a member of a panel whose hard-hitting report on the
Penn case was issued Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, Martin canceled a June 1 meeting of Harvard faculty
members and called for a national debate on the proper limits on
financial conflict of interest for medical researchers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, he put in place what he called unique new rules
designed to protect medical students and postgraduate trainees from
exploitation by mentors who have financial interest in companies
that sponsor research in their Harvard laboratories.
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe that the most important role academic medicine can
have in clinical research today is to try to bolster the public's
faith in the veracity and ethical underpinnings of this noble
endeavor,'' Martin wrote in a memo to Harvard Medical School's
faculty members.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, the dean said that maintaining Harvard's
current strictures on the medical faculty _ the tightest of any
major US academic research institution _ ``is the right thing to
do, the responsible thing to do at this juncture.''
</P>
<P>
   Harvard medical faculty members currently cannot conduct
research for a company in which they own more than $20,000 in stock
or receive more than $10,000 in fees or royalties, and rules on
research involving human subjects are even more stringent.
</P>
<P>
   A committee assembled by Martin in the fall of 1998 recommended
months ago that Harvard medical faculty be able to own somewhat
larger amounts of stock, or be paid higher consultant fees, and
still do company-sponsored research in their academic labs.
</P>
<P>
   Martin did not rule out a liberalization of research rules in
the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's the right decision in substance and in timing,''
said David Korn of the Association of American Medical Colleges,
who was to appear at next week's Harvard faculty meeting. ``I was
going to argue at the June 1 meeting that even if there were
reasonable grounds to changing the rules, this was absolutely not
the time for Harvard Medical School to do so.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin's unexpected action was immediately applauded by leaders
of academic medicine, who predicted it should have a bracing effect
on those who argue that conflict-of-interest policies should be
strengthened to protect those who volunteer for research and to
prevent bias in reporting research results.
</P>
<P>
   ``Harvard is the anchor of academic medicine,'' said Dr. Kenneth
Shine, president of the National Institute of Medicine, an arm of
the congressionally chartered National Academy of Sciences. ``I
suspect we'll see more institutions move toward the Harvard model
as opposed to away from it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm delighted,'' added Dr. Marcia Angell, editor-in-chief of
the New England Journal of Medicine. ``I was concerned that Harvard
was going to relax its guidelines.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin alluded to a series of cases around the nation in which
major research institutions have been found to violate rules
governing protection of human subjects.
</P>
<P>
   One such case involved a gene therapy experiment with heart
patients at St. Elizabeth's Medical Center in Boston. In the Penn
and Boston cases, along with more than a half-dozen others, federal
authorities temporarily halted those experiments _ and sometimes
suspended entire institutions' federal grants.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said such events did not determine his decision to retain
Harvard's strict rules, but did ``make Harvard's position more
visible.'' He also noted that Harvard Medical School's 6,000
full-time faculty members were split on the issue, a factor he
called ``the most troublesome thing'' about relaxing
conflict-of-interest rules at this time.
</P>
<P>
   The only modification Martin made in the current rules involves
new protections for medical students and trainees whose faculty
mentors have financial interests in the outcome of experiments in
the academic laboratories they run.
</P>
<P>
   The new rule specifies that trainees must be informed of
mentors' financial interests. Mentors must obtain written approval
before trainees can be assigned to projects in which the mentor has
a financial interest. There is a new appeals process for trainees
who feel wronged by situations involving mentors' conflict of
interest.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really the issue here is the relative powerlessness of PhD
students and postdocs in laboratories,'' said Nikki Zapol, director
of corporate-sponsored research at Massachusetts General Hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Zapol said the new Harvard policy may have grown out of an
episode involving her son, David, a former postdoctoral student at
a West Coast university. His father, Harvard anesthesiology
professor Warren M. Zapol, described the case in a letter to the
Harvard committee reviewing conflict-of-interest rules.
</P>
<P>
   David Zapol's mentor was a founder and stockholder of a startup
biotech company based on work in the mentor's laboratory, his
parents said.
</P>
<P>
   ``David discovered that results . . . from his own experiments
were being siphoned off to the company, appearing in company
studies and presentations before David had published them,'' Warren
Zapol wrote to the Harvard committee. The postdoctoral student
feared that his mentor would direct company personnel to ``carry
out work which would preempt David's PhD thesis.''
</P>
<P>
   David Zapol abandoned his PhD studies after the mentor and the
West Coast university ignored David Zapol's pleas, his parents
said.

CHINESE CHEER HOUSE VOTE   ON FREE TRADE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   SHANGHAI _ ``Have a drink from America!'' Paul Shyu sang out
happily, toasting a visitor with a Pepsi in one hand and a Sprite
in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Like practically everyone here in China's commercial capital,
Shyu was celebrating the news Thursday that the US House had passed
the measure normalizing trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   Shyu, the food division manager of a gigantic Taiwanese-Chinese
warehouse store that imports more than 10 percent of its products
from the United States, has his own ideas about who got the better
end of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``China, of course,'' he said. ``They will get a reduction on
import tax into the US for Chinese goods. America's trade deficit
with China will definitely increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But as Shyu quickly added, American producers and
farmers _ not to mention importers like himself, and his customers
_ will also benefit. ``More products will come to China from the US
at lower tariffs. That's why I'm very happy for our business,''
Shyu said.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling through his spic-and-span megastore that has
registered 250,000 members since it opened six months ago, Shyu
pointed to pallets stacked high with Lay's potato chips and
Carnation milk powder, to refrigerated trays of Washington State
apples, California grapes and Florida oranges.
</P>
<P>
   While many human rights activists and labor unions on Capitol
Hill denounced the congressional vote as a sell-out Thursday, here
in China, there was jubilation among Chinese and American investors
and consumers. From supermarket checkout counters to factory
assembly lines to the cubicles of Internet startups, the refrain
was the same: freer trade will benefit both sides. What's more,
insisted many in the American business community, freer trade will
open China to influences from the outside world, making it
impossible for the leadership in Beijing to suppress the
aspirations of a rapidly changing nation.
</P>
<P>
   With its hard-won battle in the House of Representatives
complete, the measure now goes before the US Senate, where it is
expected to pass. China also appears poised to enter the World
Trade Organization, the global body that sets trade rules. If
Congress had refused to normalize trade relations with China, China
could have deprived US businesses of the privileges it will offer
the rest of the world through WTO.
</P>
<P>
   American business leaders expressed relief Thursday that the
measure passed, and insisted that US jobs will never be lost en
masse to China. In the case of perishable foods or automotives, for
example, shipping US goods made in China to America is either too
time-consuming or too costly, so there will always be a need for US
factories, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no plans to build cars here and ship them to
America,'' declared Philip Murtaugh, executive vice president of
Shanghai General Motors, the largest joint-venture in China. But
``in today's global economy, it's absolutely unrealistic to believe
that goods can be produced only in the USA and be shipped
everywhere else.'' Buicks made here, for example, have been
modified in more than 600 ways to suit the Chinese consumer and
China's road conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over a spotless, state-of-the-art automotive plant,
Murtaugh argued that free trade is a win-win proposition, nothing
more than common sense and self-interest for all concerned. Last
year, his plant churned out 20,000 Buick sedans and vans for the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to sell US goods in China, China's economy has to
grow, and the only way to do that is to create jobs in China. You
can't create consumers if you don't create jobs,'' Murtaugh said.
His blue-uniformed, goggle-wearing line workers are paid $2.20
hourly plus a comparable amount in benefits _ far above the wage at
Chinese state-owned auto factories, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai GM has also created jobs for Americans, he asserted. In
the last five years, GM imported $1.6 billion of American
components and equipment to build the factory and produce its
vehicles _ parts and machines that would have come from Germany or
Japan if Daimler-Benz or Toyota were here instead.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO deal will lower the average tariffs on components
imported to China from 45 percent to 10 percent within six years,
and Murtaugh expects to import $250 million annually in American
components within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   With its bare concrete floors, rusting machines with green
patinas and the smell of wet grain in the air, the factory floor at
Shanghai Oils and Fats Factory No. 1, a 66-year-old state-owned
soybean processing plant, couldn't be more different from Shanghai
GM's facility. But with 80 percent of the soybeans it uses to make
cooking oil and animal feed imported from the United States, the
celebratory mood here Thursday over normalized trade relations was
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hadn't passed PNTR, it's possible China would have set
quotas on the import of US soybeans,'' said Liu Huihui, acting
director of the factory, using the acronym for permanent normal
trade relations. ``My workers were worried that if it didn't pass
and we couldn't get soybeans from the US, they would lose their
jobs,'' he said. ``So everyone is very happy today.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu's plant imports $15 million in soybeans a year, and he is
looking forward to lower tariffs. He said he has heard of the
debate in the US congress, and says Americans shouldn't be so
worried about their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``More US products will come to China now, and we are such a big
market of 1.3 billion people, so don't worry!'' he said ``US
investment will also bring American people to China, and those are
job opportunities, too. I suppose that with more Chinese factories
wanting to import soybeans now, the price will go up, so that's
good news for US farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another winner from the deal is Shanghai Hormel Foods, which
makes American-style hot-dogs, sausages and bacon _ as well as
offerings for Chinese taste buds, such as sausage with rice wine
and pig tongue.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Robert Wahlert hailed the decrease in duties on
the meat he imports from the United States, and insisted that
Hormel will keep its plants in the United States for the American
market, at the same time that it creates a consumer base with
plants in China.
</P>
<P>
   As for the debate over whether to do business with China's
repressive leadership, Wahlert believes trade can only help China's
political situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things about human rights, religious expression
and political freedoms that aren't to my liking here,'' admitted
Wahlert, a Babson College graduate. ``But one doesn't change that
by ignoring or embargoing it _ it certainly hasn't worked with
(Cuban leader Fidel) Castro. Access to Western products, Western
ideas, and Western media can only help China decide and change for
itself.''

QUEST FOR ADVENTURE MOTIVATED SLAIN REPORTER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES A. RADIN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The year was 1989. The go-go Massachusetts economy Kurt
Schork had used to finance his taste for driving fast cars,
courting beautiful women, and pursuing social justice was going
sour.
</P>
<P>
   Schork, who was living in Pelham, Mass., near the University of
Massachusetts, volunteered to help with the annual fund-raising
drive of the area's public radio station, WFCR.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was not like him to volunteer for that sort of thing,''
said Joseph Henefield, a close friend of the brilliant development
executive since undergraduate days on the North Dakota prairie. ``I
asked him why.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said this was going to be his year of living Asiatically,''
Henefield said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Schork, who had made a career first as a public planner in
Lowell, Mass., and at the State House, then as a private developer,
wanted to meet Deborah Wang, a talented young reporter with WFCR.
</P>
<P>
   Within two years, he had moved with Wang to Hong Kong, where he
launched the search _ for truth, for thrills, for the edge. The
pursuit took him to the front ranks of the world's foreign
correspondents, to the front lines of the world's most brutal
conflicts, and, on Wednesday, to his death, in an ambush in Sierra
Leone.
</P>
<P>
   The 53-year-old correspondent for Reuters was a daredevil, said
friends who mourned him Thursday, but also a Rhodes Scholar who
instinctively sided with underdogs, and a journalist unsurpassed
for energy and open-mindedness.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kurt was one of the biggest idealists you could meet,'' said
Frank Keefe, who met Schork at the University of Oxford in the
autumn of 1969, when both were Rhodes Scholars.
</P>
<P>
   Schork finished high school in Rockville, Md., and went to
Jamestown College in North Dakota on a football scholarship. He
made the All-American team for schools in Jamestown's division,
Henefield said, but revulsion at the Vietnam War changed him ``from
being a typical jock to finding pleasure in his intellect. Kurt,
like many of us, began to question what we knew, what we were
taught, what we were seeing'' because of the war.
</P>
<P>
   Schork came to Massachusetts from Oxford because his first wife
was going to law school at Boston University. He spent a miserable
year as a writer at the Mitre Corporation, a major defense
contractor, then got a planning job in Lowell with help from Keefe.
When the new governor, Michael S. Dukakis, made Keefe state
planning director, Keefe made Schork his assistant.
</P>
<P>
   Schork worked on Bill Bradley's first campaign for US Senate, in
1978. But when Dukakis was ousted from the governor's chair in that
same year, Schork's career as a public official ended. For the next
10 years, he made money as a private developer and spent it freely,
on fast motorcycles and faster cars.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a very nice Porsche, and on the highways he was
infuriatingly legal,'' Henefield said, but he would go out on
unused runways at Westover Air Force Base and do 150 miles per
hour.
</P>
<P>
   Once Schork moved to Hong Kong, his transformation was swift.
</P>
<P>
   ``One day, I got a picture in the mail of some mujahideen with
Kalashnikovs, in tribal robes, with head wraps and beards,''
Henefield said. ``I had to stare at it a while before I realized
one of them was Kurt.''
</P>
<P>
   But Schork ``really was not just a thrill-seeker,'' said
Christopher Lydon, who served with him on the board of the
now-defunct Boston Observer, and worked with Deborah Wang at WGBH.
``He wanted to know the world, take chances, and come out of it a
thoughtful, wise, good person.''
</P>
<P>
   Keefe said Thursday that the nature of Schork's death was no
surprise, and that the correspondent would not have lived his life
any other way.

<P>
   SHANGHAI _ ``Have a drink from America!'' Paul Shyu sang out
happily, toasting a visitor with a Pepsi in one hand and a Sprite
in the other.
</P>
<P>
   Like practically everyone here in China's commercial capital,
Shyu was celebrating the news Thursday that the US House had passed
the measure normalizing trade with China.
</P>
<P>
   Shyu, the food division manager of a gigantic Taiwanese-Chinese
warehouse store that imports more than 10 percent of its products
from the United States, has his own ideas about who got the better
end of the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``China, of course,'' he said. ``They will get a reduction on
import tax into the US for Chinese goods. America's trade deficit
with China will definitely increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But as Shyu quickly added, American producers and
farmers _ not to mention importers like himself, and his customers
_ will also benefit. ``More products will come to China from the US
at lower tariffs. That's why I'm very happy for our business,''
Shyu said.
</P>
<P>
   Strolling through his spic-and-span megastore that has
registered 250,000 members since it opened six months ago, Shyu
pointed to pallets stacked high with Lay's potato chips and
Carnation milk powder, to refrigerated trays of Washington State
apples, California grapes and Florida oranges.
</P>
<P>
   While many human rights activists and labor unions on Capitol
Hill denounced the congressional vote as a sell-out Thursday, here
in China, there was jubilation among Chinese and American investors
and consumers. From supermarket checkout counters to factory
assembly lines to the cubicles of Internet startups, the refrain
was the same: freer trade will benefit both sides. What's more,
insisted many in the American business community, freer trade will
open China to influences from the outside world, making it
impossible for the leadership in Beijing to suppress the
aspirations of a rapidly changing nation.
</P>
<P>
   With its hard-won battle in the House of Representatives
complete, the measure now goes before the US Senate, where it is
expected to pass. China also appears poised to enter the World
Trade Organization, the global body that sets trade rules. If
Congress had refused to normalize trade relations with China, China
could have deprived US businesses of the privileges it will offer
the rest of the world through WTO.
</P>
<P>
   American business leaders expressed relief Thursday that the
measure passed, and insisted that US jobs will never be lost en
masse to China. In the case of perishable foods or automotives, for
example, shipping US goods made in China to America is either too
time-consuming or too costly, so there will always be a need for US
factories, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have no plans to build cars here and ship them to
America,'' declared Philip Murtaugh, executive vice president of
Shanghai General Motors, the largest joint-venture in China. But
``in today's global economy, it's absolutely unrealistic to believe
that goods can be produced only in the USA and be shipped
everywhere else.'' Buicks made here, for example, have been
modified in more than 600 ways to suit the Chinese consumer and
China's road conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Presiding over a spotless, state-of-the-art automotive plant,
Murtaugh argued that free trade is a win-win proposition, nothing
more than common sense and self-interest for all concerned. Last
year, his plant churned out 20,000 Buick sedans and vans for the
Chinese market.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to sell US goods in China, China's economy has to
grow, and the only way to do that is to create jobs in China. You
can't create consumers if you don't create jobs,'' Murtaugh said.
His blue-uniformed, goggle-wearing line workers are paid $2.20
hourly plus a comparable amount in benefits _ far above the wage at
Chinese state-owned auto factories, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Shanghai GM has also created jobs for Americans, he asserted. In
the last five years, GM imported $1.6 billion of American
components and equipment to build the factory and produce its
vehicles _ parts and machines that would have come from Germany or
Japan if Daimler-Benz or Toyota were here instead.
</P>
<P>
   The WTO deal will lower the average tariffs on components
imported to China from 45 percent to 10 percent within six years,
and Murtaugh expects to import $250 million annually in American
components within a few years.
</P>
<P>
   With its bare concrete floors, rusting machines with green
patinas and the smell of wet grain in the air, the factory floor at
Shanghai Oils and Fats Factory No. 1, a 66-year-old state-owned
soybean processing plant, couldn't be more different from Shanghai
GM's facility. But with 80 percent of the soybeans it uses to make
cooking oil and animal feed imported from the United States, the
celebratory mood here Thursday over normalized trade relations was
the same.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they hadn't passed PNTR, it's possible China would have set
quotas on the import of US soybeans,'' said Liu Huihui, acting
director of the factory, using the acronym for permanent normal
trade relations. ``My workers were worried that if it didn't pass
and we couldn't get soybeans from the US, they would lose their
jobs,'' he said. ``So everyone is very happy today.''
</P>
<P>
   Liu's plant imports $15 million in soybeans a year, and he is
looking forward to lower tariffs. He said he has heard of the
debate in the US congress, and says Americans shouldn't be so
worried about their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``More US products will come to China now, and we are such a big
market of 1.3 billion people, so don't worry!'' he said ``US
investment will also bring American people to China, and those are
job opportunities, too. I suppose that with more Chinese factories
wanting to import soybeans now, the price will go up, so that's
good news for US farmers.''
</P>
<P>
   Another winner from the deal is Shanghai Hormel Foods, which
makes American-style hot-dogs, sausages and bacon _ as well as
offerings for Chinese taste buds, such as sausage with rice wine
and pig tongue.
</P>
<P>
   General manager Robert Wahlert hailed the decrease in duties on
the meat he imports from the United States, and insisted that
Hormel will keep its plants in the United States for the American
market, at the same time that it creates a consumer base with
plants in China.
</P>
<P>
   As for the debate over whether to do business with China's
repressive leadership, Wahlert believes trade can only help China's
political situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things about human rights, religious expression
and political freedoms that aren't to my liking here,'' admitted
Wahlert, a Babson College graduate. ``But one doesn't change that
by ignoring or embargoing it _ it certainly hasn't worked with
(Cuban leader Fidel) Castro. Access to Western products, Western
ideas, and Western media can only help China decide and change for
itself.''

FRANCE'S TAITTINGER BECOMES AN AMERICAN RAIDER'S QUARRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JOHN TAGLIABUE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PARIS _ As Europe's economies and bloated companies streamline,
the Continent has become the latest playground for American
leveraged-buyout specialists.
</P>
<P>
   The cutthroat tactics of the 1980s, with vulture investors
searching the landscape for takeover prey, have fallen somewhat out
of fashion in the United States. This phenomenon, it turns out, did
not die, but migrated across the Atlantic.
</P>
<P>
   In the thick of this trend is one of the brashest and most
feared of the old-style raiders, Asher B. Edelman, who is trying to
outwit a venerable French family institution, Taittinger, the
Champagne maker, luxury-goods producer and top-of-the-line hotel
company.
</P>
<P>
   But while corporate raiders used to slash and burn in relatively
brief battles, Edelman is conducting a prolonged siege, having
stalked the Taittinger family since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   At one level, the battle has evolved into a clash of personal
and corporate styles. Taittinger is represented by its chairman,
Claude Taittinger, 72, and his niece Anne-Claire Taittinger, chief
executive of the Societe du Louvre, the company that is the main
Taittinger asset. They have been scrambling to transform Louvre
from a French heirloom into a leaner, American-style corporation,
and they refuse to deal with Edelman.
</P>
<P>
   But they face a formidable foe with potent allies, including the
New York investor Guy Wyser-Pratte. Through a combination of legal
savvy and sharp financial elbows, Edelman has been transferring the
skills he honed in the United States to pursue Louvre. And
Wyser-Pratte has successfully laid siege to another French
institution, Groupe Andre, which owns a Champs-Elysees shoe shop,
Chaussures Andre, and the Kookai fashion chain.
</P>
<P>
   For Edelman, giving up seems the furthest thing from his mind.
``There's every reason to stay in, and to continue to push for
change,'' he said by phone from New York.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the clash of French provincial style and American
bluntness, larger stakes are in play. As the Andre case showed, old
French family companies are under pressure to perform or be taken
over. Moreover, the way companies protect themselves is a hot topic
of corporate and political debate. Several French companies, like
the conglomerate Vivendi and the bank Societe Generale, have
recently limited stockholder voting rights, sending minority
shareholder groups to the barricades.
</P>
<P>
   Luxury products are hot now, and the Taittinger properties of
Societe du Louvre, like the Hotel de Crillon in Paris and the
Baccarat crystal works, are thriving. Edelman thinks that breaking
Louvre into separate companies could vastly enhance its value. But
the Taittingers say that a loss of family control would weaken the
company's image.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, in a Paris court, Edelman contested the
Taittinger family voting rights in Societe du Louvre. A decision is
expected early in June. But even if the court rules against him,
Edelman says he will not give up.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle can be wearing, as each side tries to push on as
though the other does not matter. The history of the battle goes
like this:
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Edelman began buying shares in Taittinger SA, the
holding company that owns the Champagne maker and more than half
the voting rights in Societe du Louvre. He also went after Louvre
itself, bringing his holdings and those of his allies to about 25
percent. At a stockholders meeting in 1998, Edelman's group
presented a list of 52 questions about the company's inner
workings, including delicate matters like whether family members
used company apartments rent-free or held fictitious jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Such methods, tastelessly aggressive by Taittinger standards,
are part of Edelman's corporate arsenal. In the '80s, he was feared
for his assault on companies like Datapoint, a computer concern he
took over after a long and bitter battle. By the early '90s,
Edelman, an avid art collector, retired to Switzerland and opened a
gallery. His reputation had become one of lavish living more than
financial acumen. In 1996, his sale of a Jasper Johns painting for
$3 million drew attention, as had his sale two years earlier, for
$5.8 million, of a 23-room Manhattan apartment overlooking the East
River.
</P>
<P>
   But by the mid-'90s, he was back at work, running Edelman Value
Partners from New York, investing mainly in undervalued French and
Swiss stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the sniping, his continuing struggle has had its playful
moments. When Claude Taittinger said in an interview that if the
Taittingers wanted to paint the Crillon pink, ``we can, and Edelman
can't,'' Edelman responded by having a can of pink paint delivered
to Taittinger's home.
</P>
<P>
   In this spirited give-and-take, Edelman has been clear about his
motives. He says there is great value to be unlocked in Louvre. He
wants to shed nonluxury businesses and focus on the Concorde hotel
chain and its flagship, the Crillon, where stars and statesmen
congregate; the midpriced Envergure hotel chain, and a luxury-goods
division centered on a revived Baccarat.
</P>
<P>
   Edelman makes no secret of wanting to ride the wave of demand
for luxury. France remains Europe's, and the world's No. 1 tourist
destination, and Societe du Louvre's chief luxury hotels, which
also include the Hotel de Louvre in Paris and the Martinez in
Cannes, are hot properties. Baccarat he sees as a glass company
around which to build a luxury-goods group in the style of Louis
Vuitton or Gucci.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we first bought in, we thought we would enter into a
basic cooperation agreement,'' he said. ``We now see it
differently. Whether through a takeover or a proxy fight, in either
event we have a plan for three different public companies.''
</P>
<P>
   Wyser-Pratte agrees. Societe du Louvre, he said in a telephone
interview, is ``highly, highly undervalued,'' adding, ``The value
of the assets is two, two and a half times the value of the
shares.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Taittinger wants no part of a breakup. ``We have a very
great sense of security,'' she said in her black wood-paneled
office on the edge of Paris. As for Edelman's continued pressure,
she remarked: ``It's nothing new. There's no rational explanation
for it.''  &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   What she wants is to keep Louvre together, to keep focusing on
its main businesses. Over the next five years, she wants to double
the number of rooms in the Envergure hotels and to spread into
markets like Spain, Italy and Eastern Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taittinger, a slight, engaging woman of 50, was educated in
sociology and urban studies, and says her passion was for urban
planning. Asked why she joined Louvre in 1979, she hesitated, but
an associate who knows her well said, ``Duty.'' In 1997, after
running several divisions, including a line of perfumes and
Baccarat, she succeeded her father, Jean, then 70, as chief
executive.
</P>
<P>
   ``A family company must be run like a company,'' she said,
adding that family-owned companies have it harder in France, where
envy of wealth is a national sport, than in Germany or Italy.
</P>
<P>
   But the Taittingers are not just any family. Nine Taittingers
are listed in ``Who's Who in France.'' Taittinger's father was
mayor of Reims and French minister of justice in the 1970s. Her
uncle, Pierre-Christian, was a senator; her brother, Jean-Frantz,
is a member of Parliament. Yet business has always been the
family's inclination. Ms. Taittinger's son recently dropped out of
college to join a dot-com company.
</P>
<P>
   By shedding nonessential businesses like ELM Leblanc, a heating
concern, and a controlling share in the private Banque du Louvre,
and then sprucing up the perfume and glassware businesses through
increased marketing and more closely controlled distribution, Ms.
Taittinger raised revenue by 10 percent a year, to 677 million
euros in 1999, now $617 million. Net profit has risen 52 percent
since she took over. Now, Baccarat plans four new stores in the
United States, including locations in Los Angeles and Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the changes, she acknowledges, came partly in response
to Edelman's pressure. ``I have to thank him for the opportunity,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Wyser-Pratte accuses her of arrogance. ``It's the Marie
Antoinette story,'' he said. ``Let them eat cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Edelman, for his part, says the improvements are not enough.
Claude Taittinger, he said, now brags that Louvre is ``run in the
Anglo-Saxon fashion.'' But he added, ``They've been put in a
position where they have to run it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Even with the changes, he said, the hotel chains and
luxury-goods businesses have yet to fully exploit the Internet. The
company should sell costly hotel buildings, like the Crillon, he
says, and concentrate on hotel management. To bolster his
arguments, he commissioned a study by Jones Lang LaSalle, the real
estate firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``The company is basically un-run,'' he concluded.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Taittinger says she does not need the advice. What separates
the family from Edelman, she says, is a question of credibility.
``And then,'' she adds, ``there is Datapoint.''
</P>
<P>
   Datapoint stands out as perhaps the muddiest chapter in
Edelman's career as a turnaround artist. Under Edelman, Datapoint,
once a leading-edge producer of computer networking equipment,
collapsed, crushed by losses and a series of irregularities. In
1996, when Edelman was still registered as holding 20 percent of
its voting shares, Datapoint settled a lawsuit over a fraudulent
Texas land sale after a jury had ordered Datapoint to pay $63
million in penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Five years earlier, Edelman agreed to pay almost $437,000 in a
settlement with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which had
accused him of delaying the disclosure of Datapoint stock
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   But the past does not interest Edelman. ``If I were to go
away,'' he said of Societe du Louvre, ``they would go back to the
way they used to run it.''

DEMOCRATS SAY BUSH ISN'T A KEEPER 
</HEADLINE>
   By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NASHVILLE, Tenn. _ Gov. George W. Bush may be a fun date, but
he's not the kind of guy you want to settle down with. So says the
chairwoman of the Texas Democratic Party, Molly Beth Malcolm, one
of more than 70 Democratic officials from 34 states who met here
Thursday with Vice President Al Gore and his senior campaign staff.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gore has been lagging in the public opinion polls
behind Bush, the meeting Thursday was not an emergency session but
a long-planned chance for the campaign to coordinate with its state
emissaries. Many left the impression that they were not worried
about an election more than five months away, although they were
trying to prepare for it.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the basic tenets of politics,'' said Paul Berendt,
Democratic chairman in Washington state, ``is that you don't fight
the battle in May that you need to fight in October.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless the state officials said they thought it would be
useful for the Democratic National Committee to begin its $30
million advertising campaign for the vice president soon.
</P>
<P>
   The officials also said they recognized that voters seemed to
like Bush's personality more than Gore's, but they suggested that
the more voters saw of Bush, the less they would like him.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm put it most graphically: ``He's the guy you want to go
to the ballgame with, he's the guy you want to come to your party
because he's going to be lots of fun. But it reminds me of when I
was in college. There were lots of guys who were lots of fun to go
out with, and you wanted them at your party, but when it came time
to settle down, he wasn't the one you're looking for.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, at a low-key fund-raising reception Thursday night, Gore
mentioned his vanquished Democratic primary foe, former Sen. Bill
Bradley, with some graciousness, a hint that the icy relationship
between the two might be beginning to thaw.

JUDGE REJECTS FEDERAL SALMONELLA TESTS IN TEXAS MEAT PLANTS
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Texas) By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A federal judge in Texas on Thursday struck down the Agriculture
Department's inspection standards for meat-processing plants,
saying they do not fairly measure sanitary conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The standards, and the laboratory tests used to enforce them,
were the foundation of the 4-year-old government effort to limit
meat and poultry contamination by salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   The judge, A. Joe Fish of federal District Court in Dallas, said
the tests measure the quality of the meat brought into a plant, but
not necessarily the conditions of the plant.
</P>
<P>
   Fish ruled Thursday that federal law did not give the government
the authority to close a meat processing plant based on the
bacterial tests.
</P>
<P>
   Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman said the agency would take
``whatever legal steps are necessary'' to overturn the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling applies only to ground beef processing plants in the
northern district of Texas. But beef from those plants is shipped
all over the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Agriculture Department plans to continue to enforce the
standards in processing plants and slaughtering plants elsewhere in
the country and will continue to test for salmonella in
slaughtering plants in the northern district of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Consumer groups say that if the ruling were upheld it could
force the Agriculture Department to return to the poke-and-sniff
system, in which inspectors smelled for contamination, that had
been in effect since the beginning of the century.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision leaves the shell but cuts out the heart of
USDA's efforts to prevent food poisoning,'' said Caroline Smith
DeWaal, food safety director of the Center for Science in the
Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   But Steven F. Spiritas, president and chief executive officer of
Supreme Beef, said the company was pleased with the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``This decision confirms what we have said from the very
beginning, that USDA's use of the salmonella test to determine the
sanitary condition of the processor plant is flawed and outside the
scope of USDA's authority.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In December, Fish had ruled that the U.S. Department of
Agriculture could not shut down the plant of the company that had
brought the lawsuit, Supreme Beef Processing. The government had
removed its inspectors, which are legally required for a plant to
operate. The closing of the plant in Dallas, which had failed three
salmonella tests, was the first under the new regulations.
</P>
<P>
   Just a few weeks later the plant was forced to recall 180,000
pounds of ground beef because one sample of the beef tested
positive for the deadly bacteria E. coli O157:H7.
</P>
<P>
   In his decision Judge Fish said, ``Because the USDA performance
standards and salmonella tests do not necessarily evaluate the
conditions of a meat processor's establishment they cannot serve as
a basis for finding a plant's meat adulterated.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Indeed a plant could, in theory, be completely
sanitized from top to bottom but if the meat in it tests positive
for salmonella, the USDA could withdraw its inspectors, effectively
closing a plant that is sanitary.''
</P>
<P>
   Ninety percent of the large beef processing plants in the
country and 84 percent of the small ones have systems in place that
keep salmonella-tainted beef out of their plants, and they are in
compliance with the Agriculture Department's salmonella standards.
Two other plants have failed inspections three times, but have
agreed to make changes to come into compliance.
</P>
<P>
   Since the department's regulations requiring salmonella testing
went into effect, studies show salmonella contamination of ground
beef products has dropped by as much as 50 percent. And according
to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, food poisoning
dropped in 1999 for the first time in many years. The disease
control agency said the new inspection system deserved part of the
credit for this improvement.
</P>
<P>
   Salmonella can be deadly for young children, the elderly and
those with weakened immune systems. Last year about 600 deaths and
1.4 million illnesses were attributed to salmonellosis.
</P>
<P>
   Carol Tucker Foreman of the Consumer Federation of America
called on the Agriculture Department to stop purchasing ground beef
for federal programs, especially those serving children, like the
school lunch program. Last December the department canceled its
contract with Supreme Beef for hamburgers for the school lunch
program.

<TEXT>
<P>
   A decade or so ago, Dennis N.T. Perkins, president of the
Syncretics Group in Branford, Conn., brought us ``the moose on the
table,'' the disarming metaphor that companies use to mention the
unmentionable. He devised that impish but effective image as a way
of coaxing business people into talking openly about the sensitive
issues that hang heavy over a discussion but that no one dares
mention.
</P>
<P>
   Now Perkins, a management consultant whose clients include
American Express, Bose, Citibank and Marriott, is back with bigger
game in mind. He is a connoisseur of leadership in circumstances of
great peril. His new book, ``Leading at the Edge: Leadership
Lessons from the Extraordinary Saga of Shackleton's Antarctic
Expedition,'' offers lessons in leadership ``at the outer limits of
human endurance _ the place I call The Edge.''
</P>
<P>
   This thoughtful work has the feel of a lifelong obsession. An
Annapolis graduate, Perkins woke up to genuine leadership in
Vietnam, a brutal and unforgettable academy. At one point he found
himself in command of a Marine convoy running a bloody gantlet
along Route 1 from Chu Lai to Da Nang. Caught in a withering
ambush, shaken and confused, he urged his column forward,
concluding that the risk of crossing an open field of fire was
better than sitting tight in the bull's-eye of the killing zone.
(``A man sits as many risks as he runs,'' Perkins quotes Henry
David Thoreau.)
</P>
<P>
   Perkins builds his corporate leadership text around the
astonishing story of the British Imperial Trans-Antarctic
Expedition, led by Sir Ernest Shackleton. In December 1914,
Shackleton and 27 others sailed from South Georgia, an island in
the Southern Ocean, bent on becoming the first to cross Antarctica
on foot, a trek expected to take three months.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Shackleton and his troop endured more than 600 wretched
days of endless cold, near-starvation, scanty shelter, misery and
despair before they struggled back to South Georgia. Their ship
became icebound and was eventually crushed.
</P>
<P>
   For months, the party clung to an ice floe, but as the floe
melted, the desperate men took to the frigid sea in open boats.
They found a toehold on a small island, but that proved untenable,
so Shackleton and five others struck out in a life boat for help
some 800 miles away across the world's most storm-swept seas.
Barely surviving that ordeal, they then clawed their way across New
Georgia's icy mountain ranges to safety.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins offers us Ernest Shackleton as the model leader, a
captain obsessed with the welfare of his men. Cautious or daring as
circumstances required, Shackleton was a rock. An inventive and
insistent cheerleader, he refused to let the enfeebled company give
up. He insisted on maintaining equity and mutual respect, and he
saved the most onerous tasks for himself. Incredibly, not a man
died.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good, but what does all this have to do with meeting
a payroll?
</P>
<P>
   Perkins has distilled 10 principles from these survival
experiences, and he offers them as a guide for business leadership
at the edge (though it's never entirely clear what, in business,
``the edge'' means). The 10 principles, the backbone of the book,
are expounded in the Shackleton saga. Taken out of that adventurous
context, they seem mostly unexceptionable, if not routine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never lose sight of the ultimate goal, and focus energy on
short-term objectives.'' ``Set a personal example with visible,
memorable symbols and behaviors.'' ``Minimize status differences.''
``Find something to celebrate and something to laugh about.''
``Reinforce the team message constantly: `We are one _ we live or
die together.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``Leading at the Edge'' reads like two different accounts _ a
gripping adventure story and an orthodox management manual _ that
never really marry. To stitch the two together, each chapter on the
Shackleton expedition concludes with questions and some ``lessons
for leaders.'' The lessons tend to be shopworn episodes from
management lore, like Andy Grove's pivotal decision to get Intel
out of memory chips or James Burke's famous response to the Tylenol
tampering scare or Scott McNealy's resourcefulness at Sun
Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   Perkins does include four business cases where he applies his
principles in detail. Abstract and dry, lacking pertinent detail,
the case studies cannot measure up to the survival saga. They tend
to depict executives who obtained outstanding results by greatly
improving communications with the rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Creighton revived Weyerhauser from mediocrity. Pat Russo
led a turnaround at AT&AMP; T's Global Business Communications Systems.
These executives' efforts, as impressive as they were, pale in
comparison to Shackleton's: Russo gave subordinates her home
telephone number. Shackleton led a terrifying sail across polar
seas.
</P>
<P>
   The only case that comes to life involved loyalty and devotion.
It is the tale of Aaron Feuerstein's rebuilding of Malden Mills
after its disastrous fire in December 1995. At 70, his life work
consumed in flames, Feuerstein could have pocketed the insurance
proceeds and retired. Instead, he vowed to rebuild his mill and
save his employees' livelihoods. Struggling against enormous odds,
Feuerstein and his loyal workers managed to get Malden's Polartek
lines back in production within months.
</P>
<P>
   Why do the two halves seem so out of kilter? In truth, precious
few business decisions are made ``at the edge,'' with life or limb
in peril. Perkins argues that ``the edge'' of endurance can be
subjective. ``I've seen people more upset about missing deadlines
or giving presentations than Marines under automatic-weapon and
mortar fire.'' But we all know that business teams do not ``live or
die together.'' It is romantic (or foolish) to frame the stakes
that way.
</P>
<P>
   When a business fails, it is dismantled or reorganized; people
lose jobs but most find other ones. Failure is a cleansing of the
economy. If a chief executive falls short, typically he or she is
given a comfortable departure, and a new aspirant comes in to
tackle the job. Business problems are serious but not lethal.
</P>
<P>
   One wonders how the valiant Shackleton would fare in today's
business world. In his circumstance, the ultimate goal _ survival _
was indisputable. In today's bewildering environment, reaching
agreement on fundamental goals may be half the battle. Though
Shackleton's people might grumble or bicker, they were hardly free
to listen to a headhunter and depart for a more promising
enterprise. (MORE)

Undated: promising enterprise.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shackleton is the leader as father figure, a heroic provider who
shouldered the weight and made the decisions. He had loyal
lieutenants but not equals. He listened to others but chose the
path himself. Today's business leader is less a hero than a first
among equals, an enabler who inspires commitment and exists to
bring out the best in his or her people. The talent is unwilling to
rely so heavily on someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``Leading at the Edge'' has a wistful air. The lessons are
shaped for warriors and adventurers but directed at managers, who
are neither. At some level Perkins is looking for the ideal company
commander.
</P>
<P>
   Only in the recounting of miraculous survival does the writing
come alive _ not only the tale of the Shackleton expedition, but
also of Steven Callahan, who, with indomitable ingenuity, survived
76 days in a five-foot rubber raft in the Atlantic, warding off
sharks and spearing fish for food. Or the Navy patrol plane that
crashed in the North Pacific, consigning the crew to two small life
rafts. (Five of 15 died, but the survivors buoyed their spirits by
chanting, ``Toga, toga, toga,'' after John Belushi in ``Animal
House.'') Or the Texan who, bitten by a coral snake, bit off the
snake's head and used the snake's skin for a tourniquet.

10 RULES FOR LEADING ON THE EDGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, May 28)  (Sidebar with BIZ-BOOK) 
(Editors: Italics suggested for the rules.) 
 By FRED ANDREWS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   From analyzing how Ernest Shackleton saved all the members of
his marooned expedition to Antarctica, Dennis N.T. Perkins, author
of ``Leading at the Edge,'' has distilled 10 rules of leadership:
</P>
<P>
   1. Never lose sight of the ultimate goal, and focus energy on
short-term objectives.
</P>
<P>
   His expedition goals dashed, Shackleton embraced the new goal of
bringing every man out alive, and he pursued that objective in
every waking hour, as Perkins demonstrates. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Set a personal example with visible, memorable symbols and
behaviors.
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the frigid seas, Shackleton stood in the bow, exposed
to the elements. When it became necessary to travel light, he
conspicuously discarded his gold watch, gold lighter and gold
coins.
</P>
<P>
   3. Instill optimism and self-confidence, but stay grounded in
reality.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton drew the best from his crew, mainly by keeping them
busy. He kept up a cheerful demeanor even while sharing dire news.
</P>
<P>
   4. Take care of yourself: Maintain your stamina and let go of
guilt.
</P>
<P>
   Take care of himself, Shackleton did not. His every thought was
for his crew. Shackleton made mistakes, but never dwelled on them.
</P>
<P>
   5. Reinforce the team message constantly: ``We are one _ we live
or die together.''
</P>
<P>
   In everything he did, Shackleton required sharing and mutual
reliance.
</P>
<P>
   6. Minimize status differences and insist on mutual respect.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton insisted that officers and crew bear the ordeal
equally. He took his turn at kitchen chores and refused to accept
larger food rations.
</P>
<P>
   7. Master conflict _ deal with anger in small doses, engage
dissidents, and avoid needless power struggles.
</P>
<P>
   Shackleton demoted a bully and stared down a would-be mutineer,
but accepted grousing as an essential outlet. He took personal
charge of the most difficult crew members.
</P>
<P>
   8. Find something to celebrate and something to laugh about.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly, Shackleton roused the enfeebled men to celebrate
June 22, 1916, Midwinter's Day of their second grueling Antarctic
winter. They mustered a musical and poetry revue in 26 acts.
</P>
<P>
   9. Be willing to take the Big Risk.
</P>
<P>
   On Elephant Island, Shackleton concluded that starvation was
near. So he led a crew of five in an unprecedented open-boat sail
across the globe's most tempestuous waters.
</P>
<P>
   10. Never give up _ there's always another move.
</P>
<P>
   When their ship was crushed, they sought to drag their lifeboats
hundreds of miles to open water. When that proved impossible, they
camped for months on an ice floe. As the floe melted, they set out
in boats for distant land. Stymied there, Shackleton sailed for
South Georgia. It then took four forays to find and rescue the men
left behind.

APPLE TOURS GETS REPRIEVE AS CITY TRIES TO SHUT IT DOWN 
</HEADLINE>
   By C.J. CHIVERS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Armed with what it called new evidence of illegal
activity, the city's Consumer Protection Agency argued Thursday for
the immediate revocation of the licenses of New York Apple Tours,
the bus company accused of repeatedly violating city, state and
federal laws.
</P>
<P>
   But Judith Gould, administrative law judge, declined to rule on
the matter, postponing the hearing until Friday. She said the
company had not been given an adequate chance to review the
allegations and was faced with documents and evidence so new that
some of it had not been seen until the hearing was under way.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see that the licensee has had an opportunity to put on
a defense here,'' Gould said.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing opened with testimony from Renee Stanley, 47, who
said she saw one of the company's double-decker buses strike and
kill a 71-year-old pedestrian on Monday, the accident that led to
the city's emergency motion to close the company.
</P>
<P>
   It ended with testimony from Thomas Fullington, an assistant
director of the State Department of Motor Vehicles, who described
scores of possible violations of state bus driver standards that
his office found when it began investigating the company's driver
files on Wednesday. Fullington said the files did not include
current driving records and medical examination results for many
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, the hearing began 45 minutes after an Apple bus
with tourists on board rear-ended a U.S. Postal Service truck on
Fifth Avenue. No one was injured, but the police gave seven
summonses to the driver for such violations as a defective rear
taillight, no working horn, insufficient air pressure for the
brakes and other problems, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Paulsen, the lead lawyer for the tour company, objected
repeatedly to the details that were the foundation of the city's
case, saying their last-minute introduction was a violation of due
process. Paulsen said that a temporary closure would ``put this
company out of business.''
</P>
<P>
   Given the chance, he said, the company ``will debunk much of
what has gone on here today.''
</P>
<P>
   Hayim Grant, president of the company, also said that the city's
case was overstated, and that his company was trying to accommodate
the demands of the authorities.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing was attended by a dozen employees of the tour
company, who said they would lose their livelihoods if Gould ruled
in favor of the city.

SUSPENSIONS WON'T GO DOWN WITHOUT A FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ One day after 16 Dodgers players, three coaches
and the bullpen catcher were suspended and fined, the issue remains
far from resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Beeston, chief operating officer of Major League Baseball,
is expected to arrive in Los Angeles next week to begin an appeals
process that could last a month. A high-ranking Dodgers official
said he believed each appeal would be handled as a separate case
rather than in an all-encompassing investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The players union is handling the appeals of the players while
the Dodgers appealed the suspensions and fines of the coaches and
bullpen catcher Travis Barbary.
</P>
<P>
   It used to be Major League Baseball would wait for teams to go
to New York to hear appeals, but that has changed. Baseball is
taking an active approach this season to hearing appeals, wanting
to do so within 10 days of the suspension date.
</P>
<P>
   That means the Dodgers scheduled to begin their suspensions
Wednesday catcher Chad Kreuter (eight games), pitchers Antonio
Osuna (three) and Darren Dreifort (three), first base coach John
Shelby (eight) and Barbary (five) would have their cases heard
first.
</P>
<P>
   That would be followed in the order in which Frank Robinson,
Major League Baseball's vice president of on-field operations, set
up the suspensions.

<P>
   Pitchers Chan Ho Park (three) and Alan Mills (three) were
scheduled to serve their suspensions May 28, left fielder Gary
Sheffield (five) was May 30, pitcher Terry Adams (three) was May
31, bullpen coach Rick Dempsey (eight) was June 3, pitcher Carlos
Perez (five) was June 4, utility outfielder F.P. Santangelo (five)
and first baseman Eric Karros (three) were June 5, outfielder Shawn
Green (three) was June 8, pitcher Eric Gagne (three) was June 9 and
outfielder Geronimo Berroa (three) and third base coach Glenn
Hoffman (eight) were June 11.
</P>
<P>
   Right-hander Mike Fetters (four) is on the disabled list and
lefty Onan Masaoka (three) was sent to the minors Monday, so
neither had a suspension date. Both were to be determined at a
later date.
</P>
<P>
   Not only were the Dodgers unhappy about the number of
suspensions and fines totaling 89 games and $77,000, they were
displeased Robinson decided on which date players would serve their
suspensions.
</P>
<P>
   Though the suspensions were staggered so no more than three
players would miss games at a time, the Dodgers contend they should
be able to decide when players sit.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rules say the commissioner or the league presidents, when
they were in place, will mandate when the suspensions start,''
Robinson said. ``Its never been up to the team. (The Dodgers) are
not very accurate in their facts. All I'll tell you is the league,
the office of the commissioner, dictates when suspensions are
served.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The setting of the suspension dates) has been done over the
course of time. (The Dodgers) do not decide what day players serve
(their suspensions).''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers say this is different because of the amount of
players suspended, which is believed to be the highest total in
baseball history.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're talking about 16 players, you are now managing the
team,'' said Derrick Hall, Dodgers senior vice president of
communications. ``This is a completely different situation. You're
not talking about two or three people, we're talking about over 60
percent of our roster.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Detroit Tigers and Chicago White Sox brawled XXX,
Robinson handed down stiff suspensions in which several players
appealed. But Beeston reduced the time of only two suspensions,
cutting Detroit's Rob Fick's from five to four games and Tigers
coach Juan Samuel from 15 to 10 games.
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers, and the players association, believe their is a
chance for a reduction in the suspensions because they think the
punishments were handed down in a blanket ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``No.1, anybody that went into the stands drew a suspension,''
Robinson said. ``The severity of it depended on what they did. If
they were aggressive, they got more time. If it was a player who
didn't go into the stands, but they were being aggressive, they
were suspended.
</P>
<P>
   ``Quite a few stayed on the (the bullpen bench) and on the top
of the wall, but they weren't being aggressive, so they didn't get
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The suspensions are a result of the May 16 melee between Dodgers
players and fans at Wrigley Field. It began when Kreuter was
allegedly hit in the back of the head by a fan while seated in the
Dodgers' bullpen along the right field line. The fan then stole
Kreuter's cap, and the catcher went into the stands to retrieve his
hat.
</P>
<P>
   Kreuter told Robinson during the investigation that on his way
out of the stands he was hit repeatedly by several other fans. The
rest of the Dodgers hurried over to the stands and the incident
lasted 9 minutes.

STANFORD PLAYERS MEET FOR NCAA WOMEN'S TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH HAMMOND  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MALIBU, Calif. _ Introducing the NCAA Division I women's singles
champion ... (fill in the blank) ... from Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   Stanford's Marissa Irvin, a graduate of Harvard-Westlake High,
and Laura Granville each earned semifinal victories Thursday at
Pepperdine and will meet today at 1 p.m. for the championship. The
winner will give Stanford its 11th women's singles title and first
since 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the doubles semifinals, Pepperdine's Paola Palencia and Ipek
Senoglu lost to Cal's Amy Jensen and Claire Curran 6-3, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a great day for the school,'' Stanford coach Frank
Brennan said. ``This is the first time in my 21 years here that we
have an all-Stanford final.
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be no coaching (in the final). My assistant and I
will sit back, watch them play and enjoy an iced tea.''
</P>
<P>
   Brennan only had to coach one of his players Thursday.
Granville, ranked No. 3 in the nation, blitzed Georgia's Aarthi
Venkatesan 6-0, 6-1, while top-ranked Irvin struggled to beat
UNLV's Katarina Malec 3-6, 6-1, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
   Granville, a freshman, was broken to start the match but won the
next 12 games with a dominant serve and hard, accurate ground
strokes.
</P>
<P>
   ``She has ice water in her veins,'' Brennan said. ``She's
probably the best mental player I've ever seen in college tennis.''
</P>
<P>
   Venkatesan raised her arms in mock celebration after winning a
point in the second set, but Granville, who Brennan referred to as
``The Assassin'' earlier this week, closed out the match with
little flair.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really happy with the way I'm playing right now,''
Granville said. ``It feels good to take a lot of confidence out on
the court every time.''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin didn't have a lot of confidence Thursday, particularly in
her serve, which was dreadful in the first set against Malek. Irvin
almost completely abandoned her first serve at one point in the
second set, but played a strong game from the baseline and regained
her composure in time to rout Malek in the final two sets.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a grueling week, and I haven't played anywhere near
my capability,'' Irvin said. ``I will need to play much better
(against Granville).''
</P>
<P>
   Irvin and Granville last met two years ago in a junior
tournament (Granville won in three sets) and both participants
expect a close match.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laura is playing real well right now,'' Irvin said, ``but if I
play the way I should, it shouldn't be a problem.''

CIA REPRIMANDS 6 FOR ROLE IN DEUTCH INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES RISEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The CIA said Thursday it had reprimanded six
current or former officials for their roles in the agency's initial
investigation into evidence that John Deutch, the agency's former
director, mishandled classified information.
</P>
<P>
   Gen. John A. Gordon, the deputy intelligence director,
supervised the disciplinary action because the current director,
George Tenet, participated in the Deutch inquiry. Gordon issued
reprimands to two former senior officials and to one current one;
admonished in writing another former employee and one current
official; and orally admonished one other current employee.
</P>
<P>
   Tenet was not among the six people reprimanded by Gordon. But
Tenet has met privately with President Clinton to discuss a recent
report on the handling of the Deutch case issued by the President's
Foreign Intelligence Advisory Board. That report, which had been
written at Gordon's request, criticized Tenet for failing to
involve himself more forcefully in the Deutch case to ensure proper
resolution.
</P>
<P>
   In his meeting with the president, Tenet ``acknowledged that he
shared in the responsibility for shortcomings identified'' in the
advisory board's report, the agency said in a statement Thursday.
Tenet's meeting with Clinton was the equivalent of the
admonishments issued by Gordon to subordinates at the intelligence
agency.
</P>
<P>
   The agency did not identify the current or former officials
reprimanded by Gordon. But it said that he had based his decisions
on a review of reports by the agency's inspector general and by the
advisory board, both of which criticized the same group of current
and former intelligence officials involved in the initial
investigation. The reports were particularly critical of the roles
played in the investigation by Nora Slatkin, the former executive
director of the agency, and by its former general counsel, Michael
O'Neil.
</P>
<P>
   Others cited in the two reports included Frederick Hitz, the
agency's former inspector general, and Richard Calder, its deputy
director for administration. The advisory board also criticized
Tenet for allowing Slatkin to take charge of the Deutch
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Both O'Neil and Slatkin were issued written reprimands by
Gordon, their lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sincerely regret and vigorously disagree with General
Gordon's decision to reprimand Mr. O'Neil,'' said Roger Spaeder,
O'Neil's lawyer. ``At all times during his employment by the CIA,
Mr. O'Neil acted in the utmost good faith.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Tuohey, a lawyer for Slatkin, said she was ``pleased this
matter is concluded,'' and ``still believes that the intent from
the beginning to conduct a thorough investigation (of the Deutch
case) was accomplished.''
</P>
<P>
   The disciplinary actions taken by Gordon followed a series of
investigations dating back to the initial discovery in December
1996 that Deutch had placed classified material on unsecured
computers in his home.
</P>
<P>
   After being passed over for secretary of defense in President
Clinton's second term, Deutch resigned as director soon after the
1996 election. As Deutch was leaving, an agency computer security
official found that Deutch had stored large volumes of classified
information he had created on unsecured, agency computers at his
home.
</P>
<P>
   The agency's security office began an investigation into whether
Deutch had mishandled classified material in violation of agency
rules and federal laws, but that inquiry soon bogged down.
</P>
<P>
   Within weeks of the discovery, some CIA security officers came
to believe that senior agency officials seeking to protect Deutch
were blocking their efforts to conduct a thorough inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   A security office report on the Deutch case was completed in
1997, but it was effectively shelved. No action was taken against
Deutch, and the Justice Department was not notified that he might
have broken the law until more than a year after the security
breach was discovered. In 1998, an agency employee told the the
Inspector General's Office that the initial investigation had been
handled improperly. The inspector general then opened his own
investigation and notified the Department of Justice.
</P>
<P>
   In April 1999, Attorney General Janet Reno decided not to
prosecute Deutch, but this year, the Justice Department opened a
criminal investigation of the matter. In August 1999, Tenet
suspended Deutch's security clearances.

HORRY: LAKERS NEED DO-OR-DIE ATTITUDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ A loss tonight at the Rose Garden won't end the
Lakers' season. But acting as if it would might not be a bad idea,
says Robert Horry.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers and Portland Trail Blazers are tied 1-1 in the
Western Conference finals, and a loss would leave the Lakers
trailing in a series for the first time in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got to go in there like if we lose this game, it's
over,'' Horry said. ``We've just got to go out there and play hard.
Don't think about the next game, just go out there and say, `Hey,
this is the last game of the season, we've got to win one to
advance.' You've got to have that kind of mindset. I'm not saying
that if we don't win this game, it's the end of the series, but go
out there with that kind of mindset. Go out and play hard and lay
it all on the line.''
</P>
<P>
   So do his teammates share and understand that approach?
</P>
<P>
   ``I think so,'' Horry said. ``Everybody's been kind of anxious
to get out there and get another game under our belt. The way we
had our last performance, everybody's eager to go out there and
play hard and get some things done.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, that wasn't always the case in practice the last
two days.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were supposed to be hard (workouts), but they weren't,''
Horry said. ``A lot of guys are banged up, so a lot of guys really
seemed like they were trying to hold themselves back and not go out
and stress themselves too much. But as long as you get the thought
process and get it mentally down, I think that's what we got. But
physically, we didn't really get it done in practice. It doesn't
worry me I'll tell you after tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the Lakers are uncommonly upbeat, having had three
days to forget the 106-77 embarrassment of Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Phil Jackson referred to the team's mood as ``very
buoyant.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're confident,'' Shaquille O'Neal said. ``We're kind of
upset we didn't play as well of a game in Game 2 as we did in Game
1, but it happens. Nobody said it was going to be easy. And this is
a true test for us. We've been stepping up to tests all year, so
this is another one we have to step up to.''
</P>
<P>
   Nothing new: Although the Lakers were thumped in Game 2, Jackson
said no major adjustments are necessary for Game 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's just decisions,'' he said. ``I think people have
to make good decisions. When we go to help (on defense), we make
decent decisions. ... And I can understand that they got on their
heels defensively, and that's a bad sign. When you get on your
heels defensively, then you can't play for fear of fouls or
whatever. You can't be concerned about fouls in this game. If you
are, if you're concerned about what a referee's going to call, then
you put yourself in jeopardy and the team.''
</P>
<P>
   Old legs: Jackson said Glen Rice, hampered by a sore right knee
in Game 2, looks ``much better'' and he expressed no concern over
the lack of zip from 36-year-old Ron Harper, who played an
ineffective 15 minutes on Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just didn't like Harp's decisions,'' Jackson said. ``I
wasn't nursing him or anything else. I just didn't think he got
loose when he came out to play, and I didn't think he made good
decisions with the ball.''
</P>
<P>
   Ouch report: Little-used rookie swingman Devean George sprained
his left ankle in practice Thursday and was sent to the hospital
for X-rays. His status was uncertain.

CALIFORNIA MEDICAL ASSOCIATION FILES A SUIT AGAINST 3 INSURERS
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn: Calif., N.Y., Ga., Fla., Texas)   (Eds.: Includes two-graph sidebar explanation of provisions of
RICO at end.) 
 By MILT FREUDENHEIM   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Adding to the barrage of lawsuits attacking managed care, the
California Medical Association on Thursday accused three big
insurance companies of violating federal anti-racketeering laws by
coercing doctors and interfering with physician-patient
relationships for financial reasons.
</P>
<P>
   The California suit was the first broad-based legal assault on
managed care by a state medical association, medical officials in
several states said.
</P>
<P>
   The California Medical Association, which says it has 34,000
physician members, filed a civil lawsuit under the Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO, against the Blue
Cross of California unit of WellPoint Health Networks, the
HealthNet unit of Foundation Health Systems and the PacifiCare
Health Systems. The three investor-owned companies provide coverage
for a total of 9 million members in California, or about one in six
insured California residents.
</P>
<P>
   The doctors said they had turned to the courts in frustration
after negotiations with managed health plans failed to produce the
results the doctors wanted. They were seeking higher payments for
their services and the ability to make medical decisions with less
managed care oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got promises, we got intentions but we didn't get
definitive results that we could bring back to our physicians,''
said Dr. Marie Kuffner, president of the California Medical
Association.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit accuses the health plans of ``using coercive, unfair
and fraudulent means to dominate and control physician-patient
relationships for their own financial gain, to the detriment of
both patients and physicians.''
</P>
<P>
   The California suit was timed to obtain a seat for the doctors
in negotiations over proposals to consolidate two dozen managed
care suits across the country. The suits, which were filed over the
last year and which are being discussed in federal court in Miami
by lawyers for both plaintiffs and defendants, seek class action
status. Almost all of the suits were filed on behalf of patients,
not doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``We cannot continue to allow our patients' health to be
jeopardized by corporate greed,'' said Kuffner, a professor of
anesthesiology at the University of California at Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Zelman, president of the California Association of Health
Plans, an insurance company trade group, denounced the lawsuit as
``a shotgun attack on managed care.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no evidence to support any of these charges,'' he
added. Zelman said he had recently exchanged letters proposing
talks with officials of the medical association.
</P>
<P>
   Officials of the three companies named in the suits said they
were disappointed that the doctors went to court. The suit is
``misguided and it does nobody any real good,'' said Ben Singer, a
spokesman for Pacificare. ``The only winners will be the attorneys,
not the physicians, the patients or our health-care system,'' said
Lisa Kalustian of Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Medical society officials in Texas and other states said they
helped plan the California suit. They said they were weighing
similar legal actions in their states. ``There are going to be a
rash of these suits,'' said James Lane, a health care analyst at
Salomon Smith Barney.
</P>
<P>
   ``California is well suited to have a significant influence on
what managed care should look like if the investor-owned companies
are pushed aside,'' said Kim Ross, a vice president of the Texas
Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   Medical societies in New York and Georgia recently filed
lawsuits in state courts against insurers on narrower grounds
involving payment disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Last March, the AMA and the New York State Medical Society asked
for class action status in a suit charging violations of state
consumer laws. It accused Metropolitan Life Insurance and United
Healthcare of basing certain fees on unreliable statistics supplied
by the Health Insurance Association of America, a managed care
trade group in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The AMA said it supported the California society's action.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street analysts said the California suit could be
influential. ``This is the best organized and best financed medical
group in the country,'' said Todd Richter of Banc of America
Securities.
</P>
<P>
   APPLYING RICO TO CIVIL CASES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit filed by the California Medical Association is an
effort to apply the civil provisions of the federal Racketeer
Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act, or RICO. The statute is
best known for its use in criminal cases in which the government
charges that groups like organized crime or gangs have engaged in a
pattern of conspiratorial activity to further their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   In civil lawsuits, plaintiffs like the doctors' group use the
civil provisions of the RICO statute to contend that they have been
economically harmed through a pattern of misconduct. If successful
under a RICO claim, they can win up to three times the amount of
damages that they would in a traditional lawsuit. &QL;

CREDIT CARDS DUEL BEFORE SENATE PANEL
</HEADLINE>
  By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Judging by the nearly 4 billion solicitations that
flooded U.S. mailboxes last year, the credit card business would
seem to be one of the most viciously competitive. In how many
industries does one business disparage another by name in national
television advertisements, as Visa has done with its long-running
``they don't take American Express'' campaign?
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the federal government strenuously disagrees that
consumers have as much choice as they need: 19 months ago the
Justice Department sued MasterCard and Visa, accusing them of
violating antitrust laws. In recent weeks, debate over this issue
has sharply intensified as the suit approaches trial.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, in a congressional hearing unusual in its timing so
close to judicial proceedings, the largely behind-the-scenes
dueling between two pairs of industry rivals _ American Express and
Discover espousing the government's side against the defendants,
Visa and MasterCard _ erupted before a Senate subcommittee.
</P>
<P>
   Visa and MasterCard, which are associations whose member banks
account for about 75 percent of purchase volume, ``have a great
deal to answer for,'' Harvey Golub, the American Express chairman,
contended, complaining, among other things, that their rules bar
banks that issue either Visa or MasterCard from offering American
Express cards as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``They operate a closed, self-serving, self-perpetuating
system,'' Golub asserted. ``Their operation of this system has
harmed consumers, limited banks' ability to conduct their business,
gouged merchants in the debit market and stifled innovation.''
Debit cards are the subject of a separate class-action suit brought
by Wal-Mart Stores and other retailers.
</P>
<P>
   MasterCard's chief counsel, Noah J. Hanft, responded: ``If
American Express gets its way, neither competition nor the consumer
wins'' because it would undermine a system in which near-universal
acceptance and guaranteed payment to merchants has brought
spectacular growth in credit card popularity. The government's
suit, he added, ``is a solution searching for a problem and, if
successful, will create a problem where none exists today.''
</P>
<P>
   The trial, scheduled to begin on June 7 in New York, is expected
to take up to four months, with perhaps years of appeal to follow.
Judge Barbara S. Jones will hear the case without a jury.
</P>
<P>
   The legal battle in credit cards comes at a time of swirling
industry change. Advances in technology, consolidation into fewer
large hands and shifting allegiances are already at work to make
the ultimate effect of any legal outcome impossible to predict.
</P>
<P>
   But consumers appear to have a big stake, perhaps gaining an
even greater choice of products and better terms, although how much
better off, if at all, they might become is a matter of fierce
dispute as the parties prepare to square off before Jones.
</P>
<P>
   After more than a year of deposition and other pretrial
fact-finding, Visa has started a vigorous effort to press its view
that the case is little more than a clash of commercial titans in
which American Express, having blundered in the market, has
persuaded the government to help it regain a competitive edge.
</P>
<P>
   Among other moves, Visa has helped create a credit card
educational group and circulated records of political donations by
its rival and the fact that American Express has hired Robert Bork,
a former federal judge, to lobby on credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Responding in a memorandum to employees this week, Golub said:
``Rather than focusing on the legal issues, Visa has undertaken a
campaign aimed at discrediting the government's case and indirectly
impugning the motives of the Justice Department. The thrust of this
campaign has nothing to do with the merits of the charges against
Visa, but with the false and irrelevant claim that American Express
is somehow `behind' the case.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's suit specifies two main ways in which
it contends that the associations stifle competition in violation
of the Sherman Antitrust Act. One is the practice of so-called dual
governance under which Visa and MasterCard, which operate the
infrastructure for thousands of member banks that are the actual
issuers of cards, place representatives on each other's committees
and allow a bank with a representative on, say, Visa's board to
have a big portfolio of MasterCard accounts.
</P>
<P>
   In an echo of the Microsoft case, which also involved company
rivals urging the government on, the government argues that this
relationship discourages innovation that might occur if the two
groups operated totally independently.
</P>
<P>
   The government's second target is the associations' exclusivity
rule, which prohibits any Visa or MasterCard banks from also
offering cards regarded as competitive. American Express cards and
Discover Card, which is owned by a subsidiary of Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter, are the main alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Purcell, Morgan Stanley's chairman, told the Senate
panel, headed by Robert Bennett, R-Utah, that consumers could save
$5 billion a year if Discover, which he said charges merchants 30
percent lower fees than Visa and MasterCard, was not hamstrung by
their anti-competitive practices.
</P>
<P>
   The associations respond by pointing to what they see as intense
competition among member banks themselves, and by arguing that a
restructuring of the industry would tilt the playing field in favor
of competitors like American Express that both issue cards and
process transactions. Consumers, they contend, would be harmed by
the undermining of a popular and efficiently delivered product.
</P>
<P>
   ``Visa has spent billions of dollars to promote its brand and to
create a state-of-the art computer and telecommunications system
that enables the use of Visa cards worldwide,'' Paul Allen, its
general counsel, said Thursday. ``At the same time, the mailboxes
of consumers have overflowed with competing Visa and MasterCard
solicitations. In light of this history, one might have expected
that'' the Justice Department, ``rather than filing a lawsuit
against Visa, would have commended Visa for its contributions to
consumer welfare, competitive vitality and innovation.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, according to Anita L. Boomstein, an antitrust specialist
at the law firm of Hughes Hubbard &AMP; Reed in New York, ``the
government is going to have a difficult time proving its case,''
stifled innovation being a more difficult argument than, say, the
assertion that costs to consumers have been artificially raised.

CRAYON LAB TESTS CONFLICTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER and CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Binney &AMP; Smith, makers of Crayola crayons, Thursday said an
independent laboratory had tested its crayons and found that they
do not contain asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   RJ Lee Group of Pittsburgh, an EPA-approved laboratory, said it
conducted three types of tests on two crayons and issued a report
to the company stating the crayons did not contain asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The findings conflict with results obtained by two independent
government-certified labs who did tests at the request of the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   The labs used by the P-I have reconfirmed the existence of
carcinogenic tremolite and anthrophyllite fibers in repeated tests
of three brands of crayons -- Crayola, Prang and Rose Art. In
testing those brands, the labs found asbestos in 32 of 40 crayons
tested. Both RJ Lee Group and the labs used by the P-I used
multiple testing procedures, including polarized light microscopy
(PLM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM).
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bunting, the P-I's executive editor, said Thursday, ``The
P-I reported this story with balance, and great care. The tests
about which we reported were repeated numerous times. We have no
reason to doubt the findings of the government-certified
laboratories we commissioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given all the results provided to us to the Consumer
Product Safety Commission,'' Bunting added, ``and we have
encouraged the labs to cooperate fully with the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Other media organizations, school districts and government
agencies throughout the country said Thursday they are also testing
crayons for asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   KIRO, Channel 7, the CBS affiliate in Seattle, hired Orion
Environmental Laboratories test to crayons, chalk and other
products containing talc Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked through the microscope and I must admit I was
surprised to see fibers of tremolite clearly visible in the
Crayola,'' said Donna McNeal, director of the lab.
</P>
<P>
   McNeal said she also found asbestos in the foreign-made chalk
sample supplied by the TV station, and that the CPSC had been
notified of their findings.
</P>
<P>
   Binney &AMP; Smith said Thursday it also had turned over its new
results to the CPSC, which is conducting its own testing.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Richard Lee of RJ Lee Group said: ``We
examined the optical properties of the minerals, as well as the
crystal structure of the talc and finished crayons, by PLM, TEM,
and SEM.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of those techniques, which definitively
determine whether or not asbestos is present, confirmed that the
talc used in Crayola crayons and the finished products do not
contain asbestos and are safe for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Binney &AMP; Smith Chief Operating Officer Al Hunyadi said in a
statement: ``These findings reaffirm the commitment to safety we've
upheld for nearly 100 years. Consumers who use Crayola products at
home and in school can continue to feel good about using them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, while the CPSC continued its testing, the
Environmental Protection Agency in Washington prepared a briefing
sheet for its regional offices to use if they are asked about the
safety of crayons.
</P>
<P>
   In the paper, the agency said it ``would suggest that until more
information is available on this matter that crayons not be used.
This would be particularly true for children at ages generally 3
years old or younger, where there is a likelihood that they could,
and would, put the crayons into their mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's paper also said, ``While extremely low levels of
asbestos in crayons may not pose much of an actual risk to
children, any exposure would be unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Public Health -- Seattle &AMP; King County issued an
advisory cautioning prents about household environmental hazards,
including asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main message for parents at this point is to make sure
that their children are not eating non-food items, crayons
included,'' said Alonzo Plough, director of the agencly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent study just helps to remind parents of the hazards
that may be associated with consuming non-food items.''
</P>
<P>
   In its advisory, the health department also said: ``Although
there is no safe level of exposure level to asbestos, crayons are
not the only potential source of asbestos exposure in the urban
environment.''

NUCLEAR STOCKPILE GUARDIANS SQUABBLE OVER COST OF PROJECT 
</HEADLINE>
   By JAMES GLANZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an unusually public display of acrimony among the caretakers
of the nation's nuclear stockpile, Sandia National Laboratories has
charged that cost overruns on a giant laser at another federal
laboratory may disrupt the program that ensures that the stockpile
remains safe and reliable.
</P>
<P>
   The laser, the National Ignition Facility, is designed to mimic
some conditions at the heart of an exploding hydrogen bomb. But its
expected construction costs at the Lawrence Livermore National
Laboratory have doubled to $2.1 billion, and critics in Congress
have begun to wonder aloud if the project is worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, when the United States abandoned nuclear tests, the
national laboratories have vied to devise ways to simulate nuclear
explosions in hopes that these methods will allow them to determine
whether stockpiled warheads are still usable.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the Energy Department, which runs both Sandia in
Albuquerque and Lawrence Livermore in Livermore, Calif., publicly
rebuked Sandia, saying its criticism was inaccurate and, in any
event, should not have been made in public.
</P>
<P>
   Energy Secretary Bill Richardson said the Sandia criticism was
``totally out of line and inconsistent with the nation's stockpile
stewardship policies.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said the cost overruns would be handled with money
from defense programs, and largely within Livermore's existing
budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``The labs are very competitive with each other, and this
outburst is typical lab belly-aching that is sometimes aimed at
jockeying for appropriations at the expense of each other,''
Richardson said. ``While we have contained the rivalries in the
past, it seems that NIF is too big a pot to ignore.''
</P>
<P>
   Under pressure, Sandia tempered its stance late Thursday,
issuing a more conciliatory statement on the project.
</P>
<P>
   But opponents of the laser seized on the original statement to
advance their argument that the project was unworkable. ``The
objections have been echoing around the weapons complex for the
last couple of years,'' said Christopher Paine, a senior researcher
at the Natural Resources Defense Council. ``They're now being
publicly stated.''
</P>
<P>
   The National Ignition Facility would consist of 192 individual
laser beams converging on a tiny pellet of nuclear fuel to generate
fusion energy _ a vastly scaled-down version of one element of a
hydrogen bomb.
</P>
<P>
   The laser, like other parts of the stockpile stewardship program
at Sandia, Livermore and Los Alamos National Laboratory, would
allow scientists to approach the harsh conditions in bombs for
study. But the project, which has been under construction since
1997, has encountered a series of problems, including the
resignation of its director, construction delays and ballooning
costs.
</P>
<P>
   Those problems led to the critical statement on Tuesday from Tom
Hunter, a senior vice president for defense programs at Sandia.
</P>
<P>
   Delays and overruns at the laser project ``will disrupt the
investment needed to be made at the other laboratories,'' Hunter
said. ``This causes us to question what is a reasonable additional
investment in the NIF.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Sandia had contacted reporters with those
criticisms, the statement Thursday called their release
inadvertent. Hunter is quoted in the release as saying that
``public divisiveness is not helpful in finding good solutions,''
but he did not directly contradict the criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   Rod Geer, a Sandia spokesman, said that ``the concern still
exists'' on how the various parts of the stockpile stewardship
program will fit together financially.
</P>
<P>
   Clay Sell, a staff member on the Senate Appropriations
Committee, said that the cost overruns were placing the project in
jeopardy. ``Absolutely, it's in danger as a program,'' Sell said.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, who is a member of the committee, said,
``the project's costs appear to be rising sky-high,'' adding that
``Congress needs to take more decisive action to prevent further
money down the drain.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson said, ``We believe NIF is important. And I have made
the necessary management and structural changes to make it viable.
The last thing we need is the Congress to try to decimate the
project on the basis of their own local priorities.''

N.Y. GOVERNOR VETOES BILL REQUIRING SAFER CIGARETTES
</HEADLINE>
  By RICHARD PEREZ-PENA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki announced Thursday that he had
vetoed a bill to make New York the first state to require that
cigarettes meet fire-safety standards. He said that such a
requirement might encourage bootlegging, and urged the Legislature
to send him an amended version of the bill that dealt with his
concerns.
</P>
<P>
   The veto, made late Wednesday night, surprised legislators in
both parties, and prompted Democrats and anti-smoking groups to
accuse the governor of protecting the tobacco industry.
</P>
<P>
   Backers of the measure had hailed it as a breakthrough that
would prevent hundreds of accidental fires and dozens of deaths
each year. They said it could prod Congress to adopt national
fire-safety rules, which have been considered several times since
the 1980s, when tobacco companies first test-marketed
less-flammable cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki said that he agreed with the bill's goal of requiring
that all cigarettes sold in New York starting in late 2002 would
have to stop burning when they are not puffed for a time. ``The
principle of New York taking the lead to make sure we have
fire-safe cigarettes, I wholeheartedly support,'' Pataki said.
</P>
<P>
   But he said that for him to sign a bill achieving that goal, the
Legislature needed to make a number of changes in the legislation
in the three weeks remaining in this year's legislative session.
``I am hopeful that they can sit down with our staff, work out
these details, and send the bill back with these changes and I will
sign it into law,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The governor and his aides said that less-flammable cigarettes
might not be welcomed by consumers, creating an incentive for
bootlegging, the importation from other states of cigarettes that
did not meet New York's standards. That would deprive the state of
cigarette tax revenue as well as frustrate the law. One of the
changes the governor sought would stiffen the penalties for
bootlegging.
</P>
<P>
   But supporters of the bill brushed aside the governor's
objections as disingenuous or trivial.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was the governor desperately searching for an
excuse to veto,'' said Assemblyman Alexander Grannis, the Manhattan
Democrat and a bill sponsor. ``This was all about the governor
protecting big tobacco, about big tobacco money to Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Grannis said he would ask the Assembly to override the veto, an
idea that the Democratic majority will discuss next week. Senate
officials said the Republican majority in that chamber almost
certainly would not override the veto of a Republican governor.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies had lobbied against the bill, asserting that
state-by-state fire-safety standards would burden them. ``We're
supportive of a federal standard, and really believe that that is
the way to promulgate regulations and standards on fire safety,''
said Mike Pfeil, vice president for communications at Philip Morris
USA.
</P>
<P>
   Anti-tobacco groups say the industry's real concern is that
less-flammable cigarettes would cut down sales, because a smoker
who walks away from a lit cigarette for a time would find a stub
that could be re-lighted, rather than a pile of ash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, the governor's handed a major victory to the tobacco
companies,'' said Blair Horner, legislative director of the New
York Public Interest Research Group.
</P>
<P>
   Grannis and aides to Assembly Speaker Sheldon Silver said the
Assembly had no immediate objections to the governor's conditions.
</P>
<P>
   Both houses have already agreed to some of the changes Pataki
requested, including fines for retailers who sell cigarettes that
fail to meet the standards, and giving the tobacco companies six
months after the rules are published to comply with them, rather
than 30 days, which the vetoed bill provided.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Assembly and the Senate unanimously passed the bill,
which was supported by consumer groups, health groups like the
American Cancer Society and the American Lung Association,
firefighters' groups, and anti-tobacco organizations, more than a
month ago. But until Thursday, the governor and his aides
repeatedly refused to say what he thought of the bill, or even of
its basic goal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't tell you how disappointed we are in the governor,''
said Gerald J. Day, vice chairman of the Firemen's Association of
the State of New York. ``Why did he wait until the last minute? He
had 37 days to sit down and work these problems out and he did
nothing.''
</P>
<P>
   Pataki demanded new penalties for bootlegging and a ban on
Internet sales of cigarettes for shipment to customers in New York.
Internet sales evade payment of the state's tobacco taxes, could
circumvent flammability rules, and can enable minors to buy
cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
   Tobacco companies are already selling some cigarettes that stop
burning on their own under some brand names. Some use paper that is
thick enough in places to stop burning. Others have altered the
chemical composition of the paper.
</P>
<P>
   The companies have found that the less-flammable cigarettes are
no more expensive to make, and that consumers like them as much as
standard cigarettes.

GALAXY EXHIBITION GAME POSTPONED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. _ The Galaxy postponed its friendly Monday with
Persepolis of Iran until a later date because the Iranian
government took issue with U.S. immigration policies.
</P>
<P>
   This was supposed to be the second exhibition of the season for
Los Angeles, which played to a 1-1 draw with Chivas of Guadalajara
on April 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is unfortunate that we had to postpone this match because
we planned it knowing the Iranian community would like to see one
of their country's legendary clubs play on U.S. soil,'' said Sergio
del Prado, the Galaxy's vice president of business operations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nevertheless, the Iranian government had issues with U.S.
policies needing the traveling party to be photographed and
fingerprinted upon entering the country. We are now waiting for a
resolution to this impasse in order to reschedule the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who purchased tickets for the Persepolis match may receive
a refund or use those tickets for Saturday night's match against
San Jose and Iranian striker Khodadad Azizi at the Rose Bowl. Just
take the tickets to will call and ask for an exchange.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy felt the absence of Mexican striker Luis Hernandez
and injured defender Robin Fraser in Wednesday's 2-1 loss to New
England the first defeat of the season for Los Angeles (6-1-5).
</P>
<P>
   Rookie Danny Califf made his first start at central defense,
striker Sebastian Vorbe made his second start and St. Francis High
and UCLA graduate Peter Vagenas made his MLS debut, scoring a goal
in the 94th minute of injury time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made some substitutions and people didn't know where to
go,'' said Galaxy coach Sigi Schmid. ``We had a good phase for
about 10 to 15 minutes in the second half and we didn't capitalize
on a couple opportunities. Overall, we were not a good team
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Creating scoring chances has become a lingering problem. Striker
Cobi Jones (four goals, two assists) hasn't scored since April 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had chances but we didn't finish,'' said Schmid. ``We
haven't had a forward score a goal in a month. That's something
that obviously has to change.''
</P>
<P>
   Defender Ezra Hendrickson will serve a one-game suspension
Saturday after receiving a red card in Wednesday's loss. Fraser is
also questionable with an ankle sprain, but Hernandez rejoins the
team after spending a week in Mexico with his pregnant wife.

NET WORTH: TECHNOLOGY STOCKS GO ON VACATION DURING DOG DAYS
OF  SUMMER
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By KATHLEEN PENDER 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ It's becoming a well-known fact that the stock
market, especially the tech sector, tends to swoon in the summer
and perk up in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   This year, the meltdown came a month or two earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be that hordes of investors _ glued to CNBC,
MarketWatch.com and their ilk _ discovered this phenomenon and
jumped the gun like baseball fans who leave in the eighth inning to
avoid traffic?
</P>
<P>
   And if so, is it possible that the market will snap out of its
malaise a month or two early, as investors try to front-run a
rebound?
</P>
<P>
   That's the question I put to investment professionals this week.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a question they like to answer, because timing the
market is an invitation to look stupid, especially because nobody
knows exactly why stocks slump during the summer.
</P>
<P>
   The reason most analysts give is that European countries, which
consume a lot of technology products, take a five-week vacation.
</P>
<P>
   And American consumers tend to buy fewer PCs, and more barbecue
grills, in the summer.
</P>
<P>
   Late in the year, sales presumably pick up because many
corporate technology buyers have ``use-it-or-lose-it'' budgets.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, earnings sink during the spring and spurt in the
fall, and stock prices follow. But that argument doesn't hold much
water because earnings are usually quoted on a year-over-year basis
to avoid such seasonal variations.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Zachar, director of research with Thomas Weisel Partners,
gives this possible rationale: ``In tech investing, buyers tend to
look at sequential earnings.'' If a company's earnings dip from the
second to the third quarter, for example, ``that gives people who
are largely momentum-oriented a reason to get out,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   I think it's more like one of those traffic jams that have no
apparent cause, where you inch along for several miles and then
suddenly it breaks up, without any evidence of a wreck or
construction project.
</P>
<P>
   About the only seasonal factor that seems to make much sense is
that investors shovel money into the market just before April 15,
the deadline for investing in IRAs, to get a tax deduction for the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reasons, several studies have shown that over the
long term, stocks on average tend to turn down in May and up in
October or November.
</P>
<P>
   The most dramatic example of this comes from Ned Davis Research
and works like this:
</P>
<P>
   Suppose you invest $10,000 in the S&AMP;P 500 on the sixth trading
day of May and sell on September 30. You do nothing with the money
for six months. Then you reinvest your $10,000 plus any profits (or
minus any losses) the following May, and sell the following
September 30. This goes on year after year.
</P>
<P>
   Now assume you do the same thing, except you buy on October 1 of
each year and sell on the fifth trading day of May.
</P>
<P>
   If you did this during the past 50 years, you would have ended
up with $13,772 if you owned stocks from May through September, or
$560,926 if you owned stocks from September through May. This is
not a typo.
</P>
<P>
   A similar study by stock market historian Yale Hirsch, using a
holding period of May 1 through October 31 (instead of September
30), showed only slightly less-dramatic results. In his case,
during the same 50 years you would have $21,582 if you owned stocks
from May through October, and $363,367 if you owned stocks from
November to May.
</P>
<P>
   Ned Davis repeated this study using a well-diversified basket of
technology stocks, instead of the S&AMP;P 500. The results _ also
astonishing _ are shown in the chart on this page.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, these long-term studies cloud the fact that in any
given year, you might do better buying stocks in the spring and
selling them in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   The studies also ignore taxes and commissions, which would eat
greatly into your profits under both scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   Davis warns against putting too much stock in long-term
patterns.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like you've got one foot in the refrigerator and one foot
in the stove _ on average you're comfortable,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, he says, it doesn't make sense to ignore
seasonal factors, which may indeed be changing as they become more
widely known.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the traditional ``January rally,'' which followed
year-end tax loss selling, seems to have moved into December and
become a ``Santa Claus rally'' now that many investors see it
coming.
</P>
<P>
   So, is the same thing happening with the summer swoon?
</P>
<P>
   Most analysts think the market started selling off in March not
because investors were anticipating a summer slowdown, but because
they finally realized that the Fed's interest rate hikes would take
a toll on high-valuation stocks.
</P>
<P>
   And most of them think the market will pick up when it becomes
clear the Fed is finished raising rates. And how will investors
know when the Fed is done?
</P>
<P>
   ``There will be some body language that comes out with the text
of the release,'' says Zachar. He doesn't know when that will
happen, but ``I think they're closer to the end than the
beginning.''
</P>
<P>
   He thinks companies will report ``very solid second-quarter
results'' starting in mid-July. In addition, a lot of institutional
investors are sitting on a lot of cash that they can put into the
market when they feel better about interest rates.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get those things working for you, you could see the
market going to higher levels,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Todd Bakar, director of research with Chase H&AMP;Q, thinks the
market ``will remain very volatile, with still a bit of a downward
trend in the near term. I think things will bottom in late summer,
early fall. There is going to be a clear rally between now and the
end of the year. I wouldn't be surprised to see stocks go up ahead
of the November election.''
</P>
<P>
   Alan Skrainka, chief investment strategist with Edward Jones &AMP;
Co., says, ``This is just such an unusual time for technology, I'd
rather rely on common sense, judgment and traditional measures of
value rather than a calendar approach.''
</P>
<P>
   But he also thinks it would be foolhardy to wait until fall for
a rally. ``We've seen a 2,000-point decline in the Nasdaq. If we
see some stunningly good values this summer, we're going to tell
people to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   SO I'M NOT AN ENGINEER: Several readers let me know I made a
mistake in Wednesday's column on fiber optics when I wrote,
``information travels on glass fiber at the speed of light, many
orders of magnitude faster than electrons can move over copper wire
or coaxial cable.''
</P>
<P>
   Electrons also travel at the speed of light. What makes fiber
optics so much faster than copper or cable is ``its higher
modulation speeds and the ability to send multiple transmissions
through the same fiber simultaneously,'' says Anthony Muller, chief
financial officer with JDS Uniphase.
</P>
<P>
   Reader John E. Gibbons of Antioch, Calif., commented that the
growth of fiber optics could be hampered not just by a lack of
trained engineers but also by a shortage of workers ``who can
install the fiber and operate equipment designed to minimize the
tearing up of streets. As installations move more rapidly to
urbanized areas, the process may be dramatically slowed in some
unexpected ways.''

DiSARCINA IS OUT FOR THE YEAR 
(For use by LANG partners) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Shortstop Gary DiSarcina will miss the rest of the
2000 season after athroscopic surgery revealed a small tear to his
rotator cuff in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Lewis Yocum repaired the tear and trimmed the outer layer of
the labrum during the procedure Thursday morning at UC Irvine
Medical Center in Orange. Recovery time for this type of injury is
normally nine to 12 months.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of DiSarcina, 32, leaves the Angels to consider their
future at the shortstop position, both immediate and in the long
term. DiSarcina is making $3.25 million this season in the final
year of a four-year, $11.7 million contract. The Angels hold a
$3.45 million option for 2001, but general manager Bill Stoneman
said it is too early to determine what the club will do.
</P>
<P>
   ''I talked to him today and said to him the question would come
up with respect to his contract,'' Stoneman said. ''His response
was the same as mine. It's too early to get into that.''
</P>
<P>
   If it is the end of DiSarcina's career with the Angels, he will
have played in exactly the same number of games (1,086) as his
predecessor Dick Schofield, ranking fourth on the club's all-time
list.
</P>
<P>
   ''In the short time I've known him, he obviously is a
determined, competitive and team-oriented type person,'' Stoneman
said. ''His presence on the field is missed, and not just what he
does for you with his glove and with his bat.''
</P>
<P>
   What the Angels do with DiSarcina after this season might be
determined how the shortstop position is handled this season. Benji
Gil is starting at shortstop now, but the Angels plan to bring up
Justin Baughman from Triple-A Edmonton to be their starter. When
that will be isn't known, but if he shows he can be be an every-day
shortstop at the major-league level he might be their long-term
solution.
</P>
<P>
   ''If Justin continues to play well, he might be an answer for
us,'' Stoneman said about this season. ''If (Edmonton manager)
Garry Templeton tells me he is ready to play major league
shortstop, that'll be good enough for me.''
</P>
<P>
   Baughman, 25, originally was a shortstop when the Angels drafted
him in 1995 before they moved him to second base. They were
grooming him to be their every-day second baseman before he broke
his leg in five places in the Mexican Winter League in 1998. He was
out of action until this spring and began the season at Double-A
Erie, but has since been moved to shortstop and promoted to
Edmonton.
</P>
<P>
   Gil, who has started 34 games at shorstop and played 39 overall,
is hitting .207 and committed a team-high 11 errors.
</P>
<P>
   ''Benji has performed pretty well for us so far,'' Stoneman
said. ''We know he's booted a few balls, but he's also made some
plays some people wouldn't have made. He hasn't hit .300 but he's
performed as well as we expected him to perform.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Scott Schoeneweis beat Brad Radke and the Twins
Thursday. Up next: Chuck Finley and the Indians.
</P>
<P>
   The game has a little more meaning for Schoeneweis, who watched,
listened and learned from the veteran Finley while the two were
teammates with the Angels. Schoeneweis didn't know Finley would be
his counterpart in his next start on Tuesday until told by a
reporter.
</P>
<P>
   ''That's great, I'm excited about that,'' he said. ''It's one of
those games years later I'll look back on. It's a chance to pitch
against a guy who pretty much took me under his wing.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis is off to a 5-2 start this season, but said he
doesn't need to prove anything to Finley.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not going to try to impress him,'' Schoeneweis said.
''Just try to keep the team in the game. When you go against a guy
like Chuck, and a guy like (Brad) Radke today, you've got to have
your A- game.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitcher Seth Etherton joined the team in Minneapolis Thursday
just in time to watch the game, then fly with the team to Kansas
City, where he'll make his major league debut tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton was 2-2 with a 4.43 ERA in seven starts for Triple-A
Edmonton, and said he had ''no idea'' he was going to be called up.
</P>
<P>
   Etherton will be the third of the four prized pitchers who began
the 1999 season at Double-A Erie to reach the majors, joining Ramon
Ortiz and Brian Cooper. Matt Wise, currently at Edmonton, is the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ''I'm not one who gets too nervous,'' Etherton said. ''It's an
opportunity to do what I can do.''

ANGELS WIN SIXTH OF THEIR LAST SEVEN, 3-1
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYT Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.2000 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ It might not be much, but the Angels reached
unchartered territory with their 3-1 victory over the Minnesota
Twins Thursday afternoon before 13,552 at the Metrodome.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Schoeneweis returned to the form that made him 4-0 in
April with 7 1/3 strong innings, and Mo Vaughn hit another home run
as the club won its sixth in seven games to improve to 25-22, the
first time they've been three games over .500 since the end of the
1998 season when they were 85-77.
</P>
<P>
   They also completed their first three-game sweep of the Twins
since 1996 and their first sweep in Minnesota since 1989.
</P>
<P>
   The good news for the Angels was tempered a bit by word that
shortstop Gary DiSarcina will be lost for the season with a small
tear of his rotator cuff in his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   But it has been a season in which the Angels are doing it with
contributions from everyone, from recently called-up minor leaguers
to the big names like Vaughn. And on a day when Twins pitcher Brad
Radke gave up only two runs in eight innings, the Angels managed to
get what they needed.
</P>
<P>
   ''I can't say enough about these guys,'' said Angels closer Troy
Percival, who pitched the ninth and earned his 14th save. ''If we
need eight runs, we get eight runs. If we need 10 runs, we get 10
runs. And the guys in the bullpen ahead of me have done a great
job.''
</P>
<P>
   Percival was quick to note that beating the Twins isn't the same
as beating the Yankees or the Indians. But the point is to win the
games they're expected to win.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're supposed to beat teams like that,'' he said. ''In the
past, they've out-scrapped us. We're showing we can do what we're
supposed to do to be a championship team.''
</P>
<P>
   Angels manager Mike Scioscia said the sweep wasn't as important
as a consistent approach the team is taking to the ballpark every
day.
</P>
<P>
   ''We're not thinking sweeps,'' Scioscia said. ''All we knew is
we were facing Radke, who is one of the best pitchers in the
league. Schoeneweis matched him pitch for pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Schoeneweis had struggled before Wednesday. He was 4-0 with a
3.15 ERA in his five starts of April, but in his first four starts
of May, he was 0-2 with an 8.64 ERA. Thursday, he pitched into the
eighth inning for the first time in five starts, and gave up only
one run and six hits. A good sign for Schoeneweis was that his
sinker was working -- he got 19 outs on ground balls.
</P>
<P>
   ''A lot of their guys are young and so they're aggressive at the
plate,'' Schoeneweis said. ''That falls into my game plan of
swinging early (in the count). I can count only a few pitches that
didn't go where I wanted it to, and that's why I got so many ground
balls.''
</P>
<P>
   ''He pitched a great game,'' Scioscia said ''He mixed his
pitches well, threw inside well and had a good sinker going.''
</P>
<P>
   Even more important for Schoeneweis was that he was not affected
by his recent struggles, Scioscia said.
</P>
<P>
   ''He hasn't really flinched during his tough stretch,'' Scioscia
said. ''He pitched like he did the first four or five starts. You
always want to get back on the horse and he did. Hopefully he'll
ride that into his next start.''
</P>
<P>
   Vaughn gave the Angels a 1-0 lead with his 17th home run of the
season in the first inning, extending his hitting streak to 12
games, and Schoeneweis held the lead until the fifth when Butch
Husky doubled, went to third on a single by Brian Buchanan and
scored on Marcus Jensen's grounder to third.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels broke the tie in the eighth when Darin Erstad singled
with one out, then scored all the way from first on Orlando
Palmeiro's bloop single. Palmeiro's hit landed in left-center
field, where left fielder Jacque Jones knocked the ball into center
field trying to keep the ball from taking a big hop on the
artificial turf.
</P>
<P>
   Erstad never hesitated and scored easily.
</P>
<P>
   ''I was scoring the second it was hit, in my mind,'' Erstad
said. ''There are so many obstacles (for the outfielders), the
lights, the roof. I was always taught run hard until they catch
you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels scored an insurance run in the ninth on Matt
Walbeck's RBI double.

 KEEPING WORK AND HOME LIVES APART  &HT;     By VICKY ELLIOTT 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Beth Sawi was an instrumental force in launching
Charles Schwab &AMP; Co.'s online operations five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   But the long hours took their toll on the senior executive of
the discount brokerage. As the mother of two young children, she
felt like a packhorse, exhausted from balancing two heavy loads,
her work at the office and her responsibilities to her family.
</P>
<P>
   After stepping back and taking a long look at the situation, she
began to find ways to meet the expectations of her employer without
neglecting those closest to her.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, she has helped reshape the corporate culture at
Schwab to be more receptive to the personal needs of its staff. And
she has become an expert on the subject, speaking around the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   Sawi, author of a newly published book ``Coming Up for Air: How
to Build a Balanced Life in a Workaholic World,'' is dealing with
changes in the workplace that firms across the country must tackle
in order to retain their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Many companies have responded, offering flexible work schedules
that allow workers to telecommute and work fewer days of the week.
</P>
<P>
   But Sawi, 48, Schwab's chief administrative officer and
executive vice president, believes much more needs to be done. ``We
haven't established any system to say how many hours it's OK to
work,'' she said. ``We're still hanging on to the old working day
of 8 to 5, and yet, with electronic access, there's that tendency
to say: `I need to talk to them as markets open up in London or
Krakow or Singapore.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Sawi knows full well what those long days are like. Working for
American Express and Citibank in New York in the early 1980s, she
put in 12-to-14-hour days.
</P>
<P>
   In 1982, she moved to San Francisco to join her husband, David,
when Schwab was a small brokerage house with only a few hundred
employees.
</P>
<P>
   Four years later, the birth of her son put an end to her long
hours, because she had to be home at 6 p.m. She found she had to
use her considerable negotiating skills to carve out more space for
her personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Three years later, when her daughter was born, she arranged to
work part time.
</P>
<P>
   But she soon returned to a heavy schedule to spearhead the
company's drive into online trading. Meanwhile, she became so
interested in the tension between work and family life that she
began to speak on the subject and teach classes on it in the
company.
</P>
<P>
   As chief administrative officer, she oversees human resources at
the company and has used her position to promote changes that allow
for a healthy balance between work and personal life.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab permits some telecommuting and compressed 12-hour
three-day weeks. Among the course offerings of its in-house
``university'' is one on ``life balance.''
</P>
<P>
   The firm also offers paternity leave of up to three months and
was one of the first to set up facilities for nursing mothers.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it has subcontracted LesConcierges to handle many
chores that in the 1950s that would have been performed by a
stay-at-home wife. Employees, for example, can use the service to
take care of their dry-cleaning, arrange a party or price out how
to fix the gutter at home.
</P>
<P>
   Schwab's most recent perk, which Sawi helped push through, is a
four-week paid sabbatical for those who have served five years with
the company, up to the level of vice president. Employees can add
this to their two weeks of vacation.
</P>
<P>
   By European standards, of course, two weeks of vacation a year
would be considered woefully insufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Sawi experienced this firsthand last year, when she spent a year
in Florence to write her book. Her exposure to the Italian work
ethic taught her how to slow down.
</P>
<P>
   On Sundays, she said, she couldn't buy an onion _ because none
of the stores were open. On weekdays, at midday, she would stand
helplessly outside a shuttered storefront despite the sign on the
window saying it should be open.
</P>
<P>
   ``They stopped working, by Jove!'' she recalled, ``and they
simply didn't care that I needed to buy a chicken for my
children.''
</P>
<P>
   However irritating this was, it gave her a different cultural
perspective on time.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are social costs to the conveniences we expect as
American consumers,'' she said. ``You wander into a 24-hour Safeway
at 3 a.m. and wonder if you would like to be the person who has to
work there. But that's what our economy demands.''
</P>
<P>
   Americans have much to learn, she said, from the relaxing pace
of the good life that brings Italian families together over meals.
</P>
<P>
   Sawi said she remembers a time in her own life when things were
less hectic. During the 1960s, when she was growing up in San
Bernardino County, Calif., people were still talking about what
Americans would do with the leisure time that was coming their way.
</P>
<P>
   Offices shut down when the switchboard operator went home, and
you couldn't receive a call after 5:30 p.m. whether you wanted to
or not. Then, you had to wait for the mail boy to come by the next
morning to bring your letters. People would come home for lunch
because their commute was no longer than 10 to 15 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   It was on her train rides into San Francisco from Berkeley,
Calif., that Sawi first started mulling over the question of how to
hold the line on her work hours. Now, she recommends people use
their commute for what she calls ``directed daydreaming'' _
figuring out their personal priorities and sticking to them
``despite the pressures the outside world might apply.''
</P>
<P>
   She said she finds that cultivating outside interests helps
boost productivity. ``If your life out of the workplace is hollow
or empty or unfulfilled, you'll just go home and watch old TV
shows,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you have an opposite force in your life, it helps
invigorate you. You say: I really want to get this project done
because I have something else to do that really matters to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sawi strives to practice what she preaches. Although she still
puts in almost a 10-hour day, arriving at work by 8 a.m., she makes
sure that she has taken care of the last e-mail at the office by
5:30 p.m. And her weekends are devoted to the family.

 HOUSING MARKET SLOWS IN BAY AREA  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After a four-year housing boom, sales of
existing Bay Area homes slowed sharply last month and prices are
expected to begin moderating soon.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the number of previously-owned homes sold in the
nine-county Bay Area plunged 20.2 percent against April 1999 to
6,263. That's an 8.3 percent decline compared to March, according
to a report by DataQuick Information Systems, a real estate
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Economists attributed the downturn, which was the biggest such
drop in five years, to rising interest rates, a tumble in
technology stock prices and the Bay Area's chronic housing
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to see a continued, gradual cooling trend in both
prices and sales from the higher rates,'' particularly since a
half-point increase in short-term interest rates last week was not
reflected in the April numbers, said Tom Lieser, executive director
of the UCLA Anderson Forecast.
</P>
<P>
   But while the number of home sales is clearly falling, price
relief has not yet registered. Median Bay Area home prices rose to
$358,000 in April, up 22.6 percent from April 1999 and 4.7 percent
for the month, according to DataQuick.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say median prices may be skewed by sales of
multimillion-dollar homes, since the super-wealthy are not as
sensitive to interest rate increases as other home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you usually observe during times of rising mortgage rates
is the high-end houses tend to be less vulnerable (while) demand
falls off quickly in the lower end of the market,'' said Bruce
Smith, an economist with the California Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   That theory was borne out by a report from the California
Association of Realtors, which found that Los Altos, Calif.,
chalked up the biggest price increase of any California city last
month. Its median home sold for $1.4 million, said the report
released yesterday. Other chi-chi Peninsula communities showed
similar activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect the month-to-month changes to start showing
declines within several months, particularly if we see mortgage
rates continuing on up,'' said Lieser.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually home sales should decline to close to their historic
rates of 3 to 4 percent annual growth, although when that will
happen is anybody's guess though, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of high-end homes are likely to moderate, too, if
technology stocks remain lackluster.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of cash gains realized from stock option grants
jumped to $51 billion in California last year, more than double the
$25 billion recorded in 1998 and more than triple 1997's $15
billion, according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The state predicts that option income will decline 25 percent to
$39 billion in 2000, although any forecasts involving stock prices
are unreliable, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   More interest rate increases are likely too, especially after
yesterday's Commerce Department report confirming that the U.S.
gross domestic product jumped 5.4? percent in the first quarter,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, 30-year fixed mortgages had jumped to an average of
8.15 percent from 6.92 percent in April 1999, according to the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Smith dates the housing boom from March 1996, when resales of
California homes surprised economist by jumping 30 percent against
March 1995.
</P>
<P>
   That month turned out to be a watershed. Home sales in 1996 grew
16 percent, compared to a 12.2 percent drop in 1995, and have been
booming ever since.
</P>
<P>
   April's slowdown is of concern to the state because it indicates
housing is becoming an even greater constraint to job growth, Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area added 2.4 jobs for every new unit of housing built
in the 1990s, compared to 1.7 jobs per unit in the Los Angeles
basin and 1.6 jobs in Sacramento, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Gov. Gray Davis last month proposed a
one-time, $200 million grant for communities that approve new home
permits, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area, where anti-development sentiment has kept
home-building behind other parts of the state, is the major target
of the new fund because its potential for job growth is so great
but its housing supply is so squeezed, Smith said.

 PHYSICIANS TAKE HMOS TO COURT  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the first lawsuit of its kind, the California
Medical Association has accused three of the state's largest,
for-profit HMOs of running what amounts to an illegal racket.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court in San Francisco,
charges Blue Cross, Pacificare and HealthNet with violating the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
</P>
<P>
   The suit says the three HMOs, which cover nearly 2 out of every
3 insured Californians, promised patients full health care
coverage, then failed to provide enough money to pay doctors to
provide that care, engaging in organized fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Suing health plans for fraud isn't new. Last year, a group of
Southern law firms, enriched by fees earned in tobacco lawsuits,
began suing HMOs in other states for the same RICO act allegations.
</P>
<P>
   But observers said yesterday's lawsuit by the CMA, the largest
doctor's group in California, marks the first time physicians have
used racketeering laws to try and force HMOs to pay doctors more
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the HMOs) have knowingly not supplied us with enough
money to take care of patients,'' said Dr. J.C. Pickett, CMA's
outgoing president. ``That is the root of this whole suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the six law firms representing CMA are from the same
group of Southern law firms that were involved in the tobacco
settlements and pioneered the use of RICO against HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   HealthNet spokeswoman Lisa Kalustian called the racketeering
charges ludicrous and said the case would only suck money out of a
health care system that is already burdened by soaring drug and
hospitalization costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only winners are the lawyers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Zelman, president of the California Association of Health
Plans, the state's HMO lobby group, said he was disappointed that
CMA filed suit instead of continuing negotiations that the two
lobbies started last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a specific allegation against a specific health
plan,'' Zelman said. ``This is a shotgunlike attack on managed
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 47-page lawsuit targets the common practice of
capitation used by for-profit and nonprofit HMOs alike.
</P>
<P>
   Under capitation agreements, HMOs pay doctors a fixed monthly
fee for each patient, whether the patient is well and never comes
in for a visit or gets sick and requires costly tests and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The CMA suit says HMOs set ``capitation rates to physician
groups at unconscionably low levels which defendants know are not
adequate to cover the medical services defendants promised to
provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickett, the former CMA president, said capitation rewards
doctors for shunning sick patients who need them most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am being paid not to see patients,'' Pickett said. ``The
less of them that come in my office, the better I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Capitation agreements are negotiated between health plans and
doctors groups. The CMA argues that such negotiations favor HMOs,
because a few health plans control most of the patients in
California, giving them far more power than doctors, who are
divided into hundreds of groups.
</P>
<P>
   The CMA is trying to change state and federal laws to let
doctors band together to bargain as a group with HMOs. At present,
such group bargaining runs afoul of antitrust laws; doctors, being
small businesses, cannot band together to set prices. The CMA's
attempts to exempt doctors from antitrust laws have so far been
stymied by opposition from HMO lobbyists who argue that doctors
would become a price-fixing cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's CMA suit is therefore only the latest in a series of
moves by doctors interested in finding a new bargaining lever.
Pickett said CMA is hoping the suit will result in a negotiated
settlement ``to open up the capitation agreements and get more
money.''

 BAY AREA COMPANIES PONDER OPPORTUNITIES IN CHINA  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With a new era in U.S-China trade relations
about to dawn, John Schwartz of Livermore, Calif.'s Wente Vineyards
prepared to fly to China this weekend to rewrite his company's
marketing and pricing strategies for that country.
</P>
<P>
   High import duties have turned a $10 bottle of Wente wine into
an expensive luxury item costing as much as $180 in Beijing. But
tariffs on U.S. wine are set to drop from 65 percent to 14 percent
when China enters the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know our wines will be more affordable for the
Chinese consumers, although this is only the first step,''
Schwartz, Wente's vice president of international operations, said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the U.S. House of Representatives approved giving
China permanent normal trading status, Bay Area companies in
industries as diverse as wine and computers were drawing up new
game plans to take advantage of the huge potential market in China
that may finally be opening up to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area is primed to be the biggest winner in the country
from what is coming out of the agreement,'' said Sean Randolph,
president of the Bay Area Economic Forum, a San Francisco alliance
of local governments and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the Bay Area's booming computer-related industries
are expected to be the biggest winners once China officially
becomes a member of the WTO and the trading status issue clears the
U.S. Senate. Some projections predict sales of technology products
to grow by 20 to 40 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements China has made to enter the WTO would dramatically
lower tariffs that make American goods more expensive than products
from other countries, which in turn ``positions us very strongly to
take advantage of that growing market,'' Randolph said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, China accounted for a fraction of California's exports
of computer equipment, worth about $27 billion last year, said
Bruce Smith, an economist with the state Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said one important trend showed China's potential:
While computer exports to other nations essentially remained flat
during the last four years, sales to China increased nearly
doubled, adding about $380 million to the state's economy from 1996
to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, China in upgrading it's industrial and retail methods
and as a middle class grows in China, there's clearly a demand for
computers, some of which are going to be built in California,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   But other industries are licking their chops as well. The Wine
Institute of San Francisco believes the domestic wine export market
in China could in the next decade equal the current market in
Japan, now worth about $100 million a year in sales.
</P>
<P>
   American wine sales in China now generate about $7 million in
revenue, ``still a trickle,'' said Wine Institute President John De
Luca. ``But we're hoping the rivulet could become a torrent.''
</P>
<P>
   California farmers also hope to harvest more profits after
agricultural tariffs drop from an average 37 percent to an average
15 percent, said California Farm Bureau spokesman Bob Krauter.
</P>
<P>
   For example, tariffs on oranges, grapefruit and lemons are
scheduled to plummet from 40 percent to 12 percent by 2004, Krauter
said. Sunkist Growers Inc., which began shipping oranges in March
when China dropped a 20-year-old Medfly pesticide restriction, is
now forecasting it will sell about $500 million in oranges in China
in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Growers of everything from broccoli to tree nuts are also
looking for a bump once China's tariffs on those products drop
anywhere from 13 to 71 percent by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But economist Bruce Smith said he has doubts California's
agricultural industry will gain as much as the technology sector.
China, after all, has the same variety of climates that can grow
almost any crop found in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder in the long run if China will ever be a major
agricultural market for us,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   And businesses will still have to contend with a developing but
still uneven set of business laws, said San Francisco international
law attorney David Schnapf.
</P>
<P>
   Schnapf's firm advises several Internet companies that are
already doing business in China. ``We advise them there's a lot of
uncertainty, and that a good solid relationship is as good as any
solid legal document that you can draft,'' he said.

 NEW INVESTMENT CHIEF JOINS CALPERS  &HT;     By DAVID LAZARUS 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Daniel Szente helped oversee $3.5 billion in
assets as vice president and research director of Pennsylvania's
McGlinn Capital Management. His work is about to become a whole lot
more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   Szente, 52, was named Thursday as the new chief investment
officer of the California Public Employees Retirement System
(CalPERS), which, with $175 billion in assets, is the nation's
largest public pension fund.
</P>
<P>
   His appointment follows a string of departures by some of the
fund's top investment officials, who have been lured away by
high-paying jobs in the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   Szente said in an interview that it's too soon to say how
CalPERS' massive portfolio will change under his tenure.
</P>
<P>
   ``CalPERS is already on the right track,'' he said. ``The real
challenge now is to keep it going in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   This won't be easy. Although CalPERS boasts impressive
diversification in its investments _ basically, it owns a piece of
almost everything _ the fund now has nearly two-thirds of its cash
in stocks, and, as any investor will attest, the market has not
been the friendliest of places lately.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm short-term cautious,'' Szente said. ``But I'm not terribly
concerned about the market from a long-term perspective.''
</P>
<P>
   While adding that CalPERS' current investments appear ``very
appropriate,'' he admitted that recent market volatility will
almost certainly affect future returns.
</P>
<P>
   Szente declined to discuss particular sectors or individual
stocks that he sees as being especially promising.
</P>
<P>
   But he noted that ``technology is going to be a driver for the
future'' and that tech companies will be increasingly attractive as
their sky-high valuations come down to earth.
</P>
<P>
   Szente will assume his new post at CalPERS on July 1.
</P>
<P>
   Prior to his current gig at McGlinn, he served as assistant
director of investments for the State Teachers' Retirement System
of Ohio and as manager of the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's
equity portfolio.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dan has an excellent blend of public and private experience,
investment savvy and leadership qualities that are ideally suited
to furthering our investment strategy,'' CalPERS' chief executive,
James Burton, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   Szente's appointment followed an announcement a day earlier from
Guy Jaquier, CalPERS' senior real estate investment officer, that
he will resign June 9 to become executive vice president and chief
investment officer of San Francisco's AMB Property Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Bob Boldt, CalPERS' No. 2 investment officer, said
he too would be cleaning out his desk to pursue a career in the
private sector.
</P>
<P>
   In February, Sheryl Pressler, Szente's predecessor as CIO, left
to take a senior post with Atlanta's Lend Lease Real Estate
Investments, the largest manager of pension funds' real estate
assets.
</P>
<P>
   And Patrick Mitchell, CIO of CalPERS' sister fund, the
California State Teachers' Retirement System, said last week that
he will make his exit in July to join a venture-capital firm.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Welty, head of Welty Capital Management in Lafayette,
Calif., said CalPERS will continue having a hard time holding on to
talented investment officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just too highly structured there as far as pay goes,'' he
observed.
</P>
<P>
   In the private sector, Welty noted, top investment officials can
make upwards of $400,000 a year, perhaps as much as $1 million with
performance bonuses.
</P>
<P>
   Szente will be paid $260,000 annually. Other top CalPERS
investment officials are paid about $200,000.
</P>
<P>
   CalPERS now holds more than $116 billion in U.S. and
international stocks, $44 billion in bonds, $9 billion in real
estate and $6 billion in private held investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``The larger pool of assets makes it harder to invest,'' Szente
said. ``Just finding enough prospects can be very, very
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he will rely on CalPERS' 100-person investment staff to
help him acclimate to the higher asset elevation.

U.S. DEFENDS ANTI-MISSILE PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Mass.) (With BUSH-NUKES) 
 By WILLIAM J. BROAD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pentagon defended its anti-missile plan Thursday against a
critic who contends that the proposed system of ground-based
interceptors is crippled by a technical flaw.
</P>
<P>
   The critic, Theodore A. Postol, an arms expert at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, made his accusations in a
May 11 letter to the White House. His criticism centers on the
hardest part of the missile-defense challenge, distinguishing
incoming weapons from decoys. He said a test had proved the job to
be impossible, and said the Pentagon had conspired to cover up the
failing.
</P>
<P>
   In a brief statement Thursday, the Pentagon's Ballistic Missile
Defense Organization said, ``The information on which he based his
claims is incomplete and his conclusions are wrong.'' It said other
parts of the antimissile system other than the criticized
interceptor, including high-frequency radar on the ground and
satellites in low orbit, would aid the job of distinguishing the
decoys from the weapons.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dr. Postol,'' the statement said, ``is not considering all the
capabilities of our system of systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``For obvious reasons,'' the statement said, ``we do not discuss
the capabilities of the systems and how they deal with
countermeasures,'' the term for ways an enemy might try to outwit a
defensive shield.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the organization said a detailed written response was
being prepared for Postol and the White House. A spokesman said
Thursday that it had not been sent yet.

 HOUSING MARKET SLOWS IN BAY AREA  &HT;     By CAROL EMERT 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ After a four-year housing boom, sales of
existing Bay Area homes slowed sharply last month and prices are
expected to begin moderating soon.
</P>
<P>
   In April, the number of previously-owned homes sold in the
nine-county Bay Area plunged 20.2 percent against April 1999 to
6,263. That's an 8.3 percent decline compared to March, according
to a report by DataQuick Information Systems, a real estate
research firm.
</P>
<P>
   Economists attributed the downturn, which was the biggest such
drop in five years, to rising interest rates, a tumble in
technology stock prices and the Bay Area's chronic housing
shortage.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect to see a continued, gradual cooling trend in both
prices and sales from the higher rates,'' particularly since a
half-point increase in short-term interest rates last week was not
reflected in the April numbers, said Tom Lieser, executive director
of the UCLA Anderson Forecast.
</P>
<P>
   But while the number of home sales is clearly falling, price
relief has not yet registered. Median Bay Area home prices rose to
$358,000 in April, up 22.6 percent from April 1999 and 4.7 percent
for the month, according to DataQuick.
</P>
<P>
   Economists say median prices may be skewed by sales of
multimillion-dollar homes, since the super-wealthy are not as
sensitive to interest rate increases as other home buyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you usually observe during times of rising mortgage rates
is the high-end houses tend to be less vulnerable (while) demand
falls off quickly in the lower end of the market,'' said Bruce
Smith, an economist with the California Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   That theory was borne out by a report from the California
Association of Realtors, which found that Los Altos, Calif.,
chalked up the biggest price increase of any California city last
month. Its median home sold for $1.4 million, said the report
released yesterday. Other chi-chi Peninsula communities showed
similar activity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would expect the month-to-month changes to start showing
declines within several months, particularly if we see mortgage
rates continuing on up,'' said Lieser.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually home sales should decline to close to their historic
rates of 3 to 4 percent annual growth, although when that will
happen is anybody's guess though, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   Sales of high-end homes are likely to moderate, too, if
technology stocks remain lackluster.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of cash gains realized from stock option grants
jumped to $51 billion in California last year, more than double the
$25 billion recorded in 1998 and more than triple 1997's $15
billion, according to Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The state predicts that option income will decline 25 percent to
$39 billion in 2000, although any forecasts involving stock prices
are unreliable, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   More interest rate increases are likely too, especially after
yesterday's Commerce Department report confirming that the U.S.
gross domestic product jumped 5.4? percent in the first quarter,
economists said.
</P>
<P>
   In April, 30-year fixed mortgages had jumped to an average of
8.15 percent from 6.92 percent in April 1999, according to the
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Smith dates the housing boom from March 1996, when resales of
California homes surprised economist by jumping 30 percent against
March 1995.
</P>
<P>
   That month turned out to be a watershed. Home sales in 1996 grew
16 percent, compared to a 12.2 percent drop in 1995, and have been
booming ever since.
</P>
<P>
   April's slowdown is of concern to the state because it indicates
housing is becoming an even greater constraint to job growth, Smith
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area added 2.4 jobs for every new unit of housing built
in the 1990s, compared to 1.7 jobs per unit in the Los Angeles
basin and 1.6 jobs in Sacramento, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   As a consequence, Gov. Gray Davis last month proposed a
one-time, $200 million grant for communities that approve new home
permits, Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   The Bay Area, where anti-development sentiment has kept
home-building behind other parts of the state, is the major target
of the new fund because its potential for job growth is so great
but its housing supply is so squeezed, Smith said.

 PHYSICIANS TAKE HMOS TO COURT  &HT;     By TOM ABATE 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ In the first lawsuit of its kind, the California
Medical Association has accused three of the state's largest,
for-profit HMOs of running what amounts to an illegal racket.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed Thursday in federal court in San Francisco,
charges Blue Cross, Pacificare and HealthNet with violating the
Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO).
</P>
<P>
   The suit says the three HMOs, which cover nearly 2 out of every
3 insured Californians, promised patients full health care
coverage, then failed to provide enough money to pay doctors to
provide that care, engaging in organized fraud.
</P>
<P>
   Suing health plans for fraud isn't new. Last year, a group of
Southern law firms, enriched by fees earned in tobacco lawsuits,
began suing HMOs in other states for the same RICO act allegations.
</P>
<P>
   But observers said yesterday's lawsuit by the CMA, the largest
doctor's group in California, marks the first time physicians have
used racketeering laws to try and force HMOs to pay doctors more
money.
</P>
<P>
   ``They (the HMOs) have knowingly not supplied us with enough
money to take care of patients,'' said Dr. J.C. Pickett, CMA's
outgoing president. ``That is the root of this whole suit.''
</P>
<P>
   Five of the six law firms representing CMA are from the same
group of Southern law firms that were involved in the tobacco
settlements and pioneered the use of RICO against HMOs.
</P>
<P>
   HealthNet spokeswoman Lisa Kalustian called the racketeering
charges ludicrous and said the case would only suck money out of a
health care system that is already burdened by soaring drug and
hospitalization costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only winners are the lawyers,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Walter Zelman, president of the California Association of Health
Plans, the state's HMO lobby group, said he was disappointed that
CMA filed suit instead of continuing negotiations that the two
lobbies started last month.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a specific allegation against a specific health
plan,'' Zelman said. ``This is a shotgunlike attack on managed
care.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the 47-page lawsuit targets the common practice of
capitation used by for-profit and nonprofit HMOs alike.
</P>
<P>
   Under capitation agreements, HMOs pay doctors a fixed monthly
fee for each patient, whether the patient is well and never comes
in for a visit or gets sick and requires costly tests and
treatment.
</P>
<P>
   The CMA suit says HMOs set ``capitation rates to physician
groups at unconscionably low levels which defendants know are not
adequate to cover the medical services defendants promised to
provide.''
</P>
<P>
   Pickett, the former CMA president, said capitation rewards
doctors for shunning sick patients who need them most.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am being paid not to see patients,'' Pickett said. ``The
less of them that come in my office, the better I do.''
</P>
<P>
   Capitation agreements are negotiated between health plans and
doctors groups. The CMA argues that such negotiations favor HMOs,
because a few health plans control most of the patients in
California, giving them far more power than doctors, who are
divided into hundreds of groups.
</P>
<P>
   The CMA is trying to change state and federal laws to let
doctors band together to bargain as a group with HMOs. At present,
such group bargaining runs afoul of antitrust laws; doctors, being
small businesses, cannot band together to set prices. The CMA's
attempts to exempt doctors from antitrust laws have so far been
stymied by opposition from HMO lobbyists who argue that doctors
would become a price-fixing cartel.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday's CMA suit is therefore only the latest in a series of
moves by doctors interested in finding a new bargaining lever.
Pickett said CMA is hoping the suit will result in a negotiated
settlement ``to open up the capitation agreements and get more
money.''

 BAY AREA COMPANIES PONDER OPPORTUNITIES IN CHINA  &HT;     By BENNY EVANGELISTA 
 &HT;     c. 2000 The San Francisco Chronicle 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ With a new era in U.S-China trade relations
about to dawn, John Schwartz of Livermore, Calif.'s Wente Vineyards
prepared to fly to China this weekend to rewrite his company's
marketing and pricing strategies for that country.
</P>
<P>
   High import duties have turned a $10 bottle of Wente wine into
an expensive luxury item costing as much as $180 in Beijing. But
tariffs on U.S. wine are set to drop from 65 percent to 14 percent
when China enters the World Trade Organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nice to know our wines will be more affordable for the
Chinese consumers, although this is only the first step,''
Schwartz, Wente's vice president of international operations, said
yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   A day after the U.S. House of Representatives approved giving
China permanent normal trading status, Bay Area companies in
industries as diverse as wine and computers were drawing up new
game plans to take advantage of the huge potential market in China
that may finally be opening up to the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Bay Area is primed to be the biggest winner in the country
from what is coming out of the agreement,'' said Sean Randolph,
president of the Bay Area Economic Forum, a San Francisco alliance
of local governments and corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the Bay Area's booming computer-related industries
are expected to be the biggest winners once China officially
becomes a member of the WTO and the trading status issue clears the
U.S. Senate. Some projections predict sales of technology products
to grow by 20 to 40 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
   Agreements China has made to enter the WTO would dramatically
lower tariffs that make American goods more expensive than products
from other countries, which in turn ``positions us very strongly to
take advantage of that growing market,'' Randolph said.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, China accounted for a fraction of California's exports
of computer equipment, worth about $27 billion last year, said
Bruce Smith, an economist with the state Department of Finance.
</P>
<P>
   But Smith said one important trend showed China's potential:
While computer exports to other nations essentially remained flat
during the last four years, sales to China increased nearly
doubled, adding about $380 million to the state's economy from 1996
to 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, China in upgrading it's industrial and retail methods
and as a middle class grows in China, there's clearly a demand for
computers, some of which are going to be built in California,''
Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   But other industries are licking their chops as well. The Wine
Institute of San Francisco believes the domestic wine export market
in China could in the next decade equal the current market in
Japan, now worth about $100 million a year in sales.
</P>
<P>
   American wine sales in China now generate about $7 million in
revenue, ``still a trickle,'' said Wine Institute President John De
Luca. ``But we're hoping the rivulet could become a torrent.''
</P>
<P>
   California farmers also hope to harvest more profits after
agricultural tariffs drop from an average 37 percent to an average
15 percent, said California Farm Bureau spokesman Bob Krauter.
</P>
<P>
   For example, tariffs on oranges, grapefruit and lemons are
scheduled to plummet from 40 percent to 12 percent by 2004, Krauter
said. Sunkist Growers Inc., which began shipping oranges in March
when China dropped a 20-year-old Medfly pesticide restriction, is
now forecasting it will sell about $500 million in oranges in China
in the next five years.
</P>
<P>
   Growers of everything from broccoli to tree nuts are also
looking for a bump once China's tariffs on those products drop
anywhere from 13 to 71 percent by 2004.
</P>
<P>
   But economist Bruce Smith said he has doubts California's
agricultural industry will gain as much as the technology sector.
China, after all, has the same variety of climates that can grow
almost any crop found in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder in the long run if China will ever be a major
agricultural market for us,'' Smith said.
</P>
<P>
   And businesses will still have to contend with a developing but
still uneven set of business laws, said San Francisco international
law attorney David Schnapf.
</P>
<P>
   Schnapf's firm advises several Internet companies that are
already doing business in China. ``We advise them there's a lot of
uncertainty, and that a good solid relationship is as good as any
solid legal document that you can draft,'' he said.

EX-G.I. IN A.P. ACCOUNT CONCEDES HE DIDN'T SEE KOREA MASSACRE

<TEXT>
<P>
   Edward L. Daily, the Korean War veteran whose unsettling
recollections of gunning down civilians made him the most
sought-after witness to the killings, now agrees that he was not on
the scene, the Associated Press said Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Presented with military records showing that he was serving with
another unit miles away on July 26, 1950, when a group of civilians
cowering under the double arches of a concrete railroad trestle
were killed, Daily told the AP: ``I have to agree with your
records. I can't dispute them.''
</P>
<P>
   The admission came after two weeks of mounting questions about
the credibility of the veteran who was one of nine named sources
cited in the AP's Sept. 29, 1999, report, which was the first to
show that Americans had taken part in the killings. Last month, the
AP report was awarded a Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   Daily's admission came after reporters for the military affairs
Web site Stripes.com and U.S. News &AMP; World Report published
evidence raising doubts about his presence on the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Jonathan Wolman, the AP's executive editor, said in a statement
Thursday, ``While we remain confident of the central findings of
our coverage, AP is dismayed that Ed Daily cannot authenticate his
account of the events at No Gun Ri.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolman added, `` Daily is obviously haunted by his service in
the Korean War even as he struggles to understand and explain the
version of events he provided to AP, to the Army and to other news
organizations.''
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of the wire service's original report about No Gun
Ri, the Defense Department set up a commission to look into the
scope of the killings _ estimates of the number of victims run from
below 50 to more than 300 _ and whether the soldiers who shot the
refugees were acting under direct orders. Daily was one of three
soldiers who spoke of direct orders, either in the original report
or on videotapes available on the AP's Web site.
</P>
<P>
   The question of direct orders is of paramount importance to
military investigators, because such orders would be likely to
constitute a war crime. The AP's original report said high military
commanders had issued general orders to stop any refugees trying to
cross the front lines.

   THE HOUSE: A FEUD LINGERS
</P>
<P>
   It's no secret in Utah that Rep. Christopher B. Cannon of the
3rd Congressional District and Rep. Merrill Cook of the 2nd, both
Republicans, are not the best of friends. Cook watched
incredulously a few weeks ago as Cannon nominated a Cook challenger
at the state Republican convention. So is Cook plotting his
revenge? Who should show up at Cook's front door the other Sunday
but Donald Dunn, a Democrat who is challenging Cannon. The Hill, a
weekly newspaper that covers Congress, said Dunn stopped in for
lunch and the two, acquaintances for years, talked about Cannon.
Cook says that they chatted only a few minutes. And if it was
Dunn's intention to fuel Republican discord, it would not work,
Cook insists. ``It's irritating that Chris is the one member of the
delegation who doesn't support me for re-election,'' Cook told The
Hill. ``But that doesn't mean that I don't support the Republicans
trying to retain control of the Congress.''

   CONSERVATIVE PARTY IN THE NEWS
</P>
<P>
   The Reform Party and the even lesser known Green Party are
getting some national coverage this year, thanks to Pat Buchanan
and Ralph Nader, the front-runners for their respective
presidential nominations. And recently the staunchly conservative
Constitution Party, which is hardly ever covered, has been in the
news, too, thanks to the conservative commentator Alan Keyes, a
Republican White House hopeful. He warned the other day that he
would jump to the Constitution Party should the Republican Party
weaken its anti-abortion stand. Then Howard Phillips, the party's
presidential nominee, announced at a press luncheon in Washington
that his party had quietly completed ballot access work in 30
states, no small political achievement if all 30 are eventually
certified. Together, he said, those states are worth 290 electoral
votes, 20 more than required to win. But he is not running to win,
he insisted, only to increase his party's visibility, expand its
base and advance its ``true conservative philosophy.''

   INDIANS AND POLITICS
</P>
<P>
   California is the state where the most money is spent on
political campaigns. And in recent years, California's Indian
tribes have become the biggest-spending interest group in the
state, pouring about $114 million into campaigns since 1998. Why,
given that Indians account for less than 15 percent of California's
population? Statistics compiled by the California chapter of Common
Cause show that most of the money was spent on a successful
one-time effort to pass ballot measures permitting expansion of
reservation gambling, a move that is expected to eventually make
California second only to Nevada as a casino mecca. But the figures
pulled together by Common Cause, a private watchdog organization,
also show that the tribes are giving heavily to elect candidates,
dwarfing contributions by all other groups in recent years by
handing out $7 million. The second-biggest-spending interest group
in the state, Common Cause said, is the state prison guard union,
the California Correctional Peace Officers Association.
Representing security personnel in the country's largest prison
system, it gave $1.9 million to candidates over the last two years.

CLINTON TACKLES QUESTIONS ON HER MOTIVES 
</HEADLINE>
   By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton used a town hall forum in Rochester
Thursday in part to answer what she acknowledged were continuing
concerns about her ambitions and motives in running for a Senate
seat representing a state where she had never lived until five
months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Would she serve a full six-year term?
</P>
<P>
   ``I am committed,'' Clinton said, ``because I think it would
take a good six years to be able to accomplish issues that I care
about. Doing what I would like to see us do to get the pieces in
place for a good economic strategy, you can't do that in a year or
two or three.''
</P>
<P>
   Will she live in New York even if she loses?
</P>
<P>
   ``Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   When told by a participant that ``many of your potential
colleagues in the U.S. Senate knew you as a polarizing
personality,'' Clinton rattled off a list of issues on which she
has worked with Republican leaders. And she drew titters with an
end point, ``After what I've been through for the last seven years
nothing they can say can possibly hurt my feelings.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has addressed some of those concerns before,
particularly on her residency and ambitions, but they have been
freshly raised by her new opponent, Rep. Rick Lazio, R-Long Island,
who announced his candidacy on Saturday after Mayor Rudolph
Giuliani dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton took questions for about an hour and a half from 85
people participating by e-mail, by fax and in a studio for a
``Voice of the Voter'' program sponsored by WXXI Public
Broadcasting, WOKR-TV and the Rochester Democrat &AMP; Chronicle. The
program was broadcast live on radio and the Internet and was to be
shown Thursday night on television in an upstate region where the
two candidates are vying for critical votes.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton appeared on the program after a Manhattan news
conference to accept the endorsement of the National Abortion and
Reproductive Rights Action League. Lazio scoffed at the
endorsement, saying he too is ``pro-choice.'' But he has drawn
criticism from abortion rights advocates for opposing public
financing for abortions and a late-term procedure critics call
``partial birth abortion,'' a stance he says is more in line with
``mainstream New Yorkers.''
</P>
<P>
   Many questions, however, focused as much on style as on
substance. Clinton appeared poised in response to questions about
her personality and ambitions, issues Republicans cite as faults.
She sounded surprised only when she was asked ``if you were to die
tonight do you know if you would spend eternity in heaven or hell,
and if you don't know would you allow me to tell you how you could
know?''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton seemed to wrestle with a response. She started by saying
`'I greatly respect the question'' and ended with ``I also do not
believe that we should be, in public, putting people in a position
of responding to questions that are really focused on ones of
personal faith.''
</P>
<P>
   In between she said, ``I hope that I will be someone who will
live a life that is worthy of my strong Methodism and my Christian
faith and my commitment to doing the very best I can to keep the
example of our Lord and savior. But I cannot tell you where I will
be. I can only hope and pray that I will find favor in God's
eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   Lazio only came up once directly, when a questioner asked about
the linking by her supporters of Lazio to former House Speaker Newt
Gingrich. Lazio supported much of Gingrich's so-called Contract
With America, the 1994 agenda of conservative policies that
Republicans used to regain control of the House.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot speak for all my supporters because certainly the
facts are that he was closely allied'' with Gingrich during those
years, she said. ``I think New Yorkers need to know that.''
</P>
<P>
   And, responding to a question on whether she would favor local
issues as Alfonse D'Amato initially did or national ones, like
Daniel Patrick Moynihan, Clinton stayed in the middle. ``I would
hope to do both,'' she said.

ADVERTISING: BROADCAST NETWORKS PULLING IN RECORD AMOUNTS OF MONEY
</HEADLINE>
  By BILL CARTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Even after a season of ratings declines for most
programs, executives from the six broadcast networks said Thursday
they had pulled in record amounts of money from advertisers in the
so-called upfront sales market, sharing among them a total
advertising take that reached $8 billion.
</P>
<P>
   After a week of what numerous executives described as a furious
frenzy of spending on prime-time shows, led by ABC's new powerhouse
``Who Wants To Be A Millionaire,'' virtually every network recorded
increases over the money taken in last year, the only other time
that advertisers were so eager to buy network commercials that the
networks closed the market before the Memorial Day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``People knew the market was hot, and they wanted to get in fast
and get their deals done,'' said Jon Nesvig, the president of sales
for the Fox network, which is owned by the News Corp.
</P>
<P>
   ``This upfront said again that advertisers still have to come to
network television to establish and maintain brands,'' said Randy
Falco, the president of the NBC Television Network.
</P>
<P>
   The upfront season is vital to the finances of every network
because during this time advertisers buy the bulk of the available
commercials, up to 80 percent or more, in network prime-time shows.
</P>
<P>
   Among the advertisers who supplied the most dollars were car
companies, drug companies, movie companies and established
retailers. Falco said retail spending might have been so heavy out
of fear that electronic commerce companies were gaining ground.
</P>
<P>
   But despite their widespread impact on network ad sales this
season, dot-com companies were not heavy buyers in the upfront, the
executives said. Some speculated that Internet companies would wait
until later in the season to buy more selectively.
</P>
<P>
   The overall figures for this upfront sales period exceeded even
the robust expectations of most network and advertising industry
executives who had forecast that the total commitment by
advertisers might reach $7.7 billion this year, up from $7 billion
last year.
</P>
<P>
   The additional billion dollars of spending comes after a season
when CBS' ratings were down slightly, NBC and Fox were down
significantly, and Time Warner's part-time WB network was down
sharply. UPN, the other part-time network, owned by Viacom, had
strong ratings gains, based largely on its wrestling shows.
</P>
<P>
   But ABC saw a huge ratings turnaround this season after putting
``Millionaire,'' its hit game show, on three times a week. That
ratings surge resulted this week in ABC's pulling in the most new
money, $400 million to $500 million, according to varying
estimates. Last year ABC took in about $1.84 billion. ABC
executives said they might reach $2.4 billion this year, an
increase of about 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ABC executives said the network officially passed NBC as the
leading money winner of the upfront season this year. NBC disputed
ABC's $2.4 billion figure and its claims of leadership. NBC said it
pushed its total take up to about $2.35 billion, up from $2.1
billion to $2.2 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   Neutral executives, who labeled the dueling claims from NBC and
ABC a meaningless sideshow solely about bragging rights, said the
final tally might come down to more or less a tie between the two
networks. Jamie Kellner, the president of WB said, ``The fact is,
ABC won the season every way you can, and they're adding the most
money in the upfront.''
</P>
<P>
   But Falco noted that NBC, bolstered by a strong performance by
its core of hit shows, especially in the last month, ``was able to
keep up the premium price'' that it had been able to charge
advertisers who wanted to be in on those hits, like ``E.R.''
``Frasier'' and a new favorite, ``The West Wing.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC also benefits from having its best night on Thursday, when
certain advertisers, like movie companies, most want to reach
viewers.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond the the dueling claims of supremacy for ABC and NBC, CBS
was cited by numerous executives for making great strides in the
upfront, thanks largely to a lineup of new shows for next fall that
were very well received by advertisers. One ABC executive said,
``The advertisers loved their shows, and they got paid well for
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Without revealing specific figures, CBS executives said they
were likely to be up 16 to 17 percent over last season. A network
sales executive for a competing network put the CBS total at $1.6
billion, up from $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this was as good as we could have ever hoped for,''
said Leslie Moonves, the president of CBS Television.
</P>
<P>
   The Fox network struggled through what Nesvig acknowledged was
``a tough year with a lot of series failure.'' Still, he said the
network expected to finish with about $1.3 million in sales, up
from $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion last year.
</P>
<P>
   At WB, Kellner said its steep ratings declines had hurt in terms
of the overall money the network took in. WB was the only network
to show a decline, from about $450 million last year to about $425
million this year. But Kellner said the network also decided to
save more of its commercial slots to sell later in the season. And,
he said, advertisers were still enthusiastic about the young female
audience WB attracts, the more so now because no other network is
really concentrating heavily on that group.
</P>
<P>
   As for UPN, it was the one network that had not concluded its
business Thursday. And UPN's totals are diminished by the fact that
it does not sell the commercials in its wrestling hit
``Smackdown.'' Those are sold by the show's owner, the World
Wrestling Federation.
</P>
<P>
   Executives from the other networks estimated UPN would finish
with about $150 million in sales for its other shows, up from about
$120 million.
</P>
<P>
   As for the overall impact of ABC's ``Millionaire,'' Marvin
Goldsmith, the president of sales for ABC, said it proved to be of
enormous value not just for the advertising money committed
directly to it but also for how ABC was able to use it in packages
with other shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said we were going to ride that puppy and we did,'' he
said. &QL;

THE WALLACE FACTOR: BLAZERS' ASSET OR BIGGEST LIABILITY? 
</HEADLINE>
   By TOM SPOUSTA   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORTLAND, Ore. _ He's an enigma and an All-Star, a technical
foul waiting to happen and a highlight film ready to roll. In two
mood swings so far, Rasheed Wallace has proved himself as the
Western Conference finals' wild card, capable of fouling his own
team's chemistry or personally escorting the Los Angeles Lakers to
the express-checkout lane.
</P>
<P>
   Playing only 16 minutes in Game 1 last Saturday, Wallace was the
Portland Trail Blazers' biggest asset and liability, scoring 11
points and being ejected for a menacing stare-down of the official
Ron Garretson. Portland lost by 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   In Game 2 on Monday, Wallace suddenly became his own
anger-management counselor, played 46 of 48 minutes and strafed the
Lakers for 29 points and 12 rebounds. He hit all three of his
3-point attempts in the decisive third quarter and Portland won by
29 points.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the way everybody would love to see Rasheed play _
including myself,'' the Blazers' Scottie Pippen said.
</P>
<P>
   So, which Wallace will show up for Game 3 on Friday night at the
Rose Garden? The rage? Or the fury?
</P>
<P>
   His teammates are confident Wallace, who is in his fifth
professional season, has replaced his short regular-season fuse
with a mature playoff cool. The power of peer pressure in the Trail
Blazers' locker room after Game 1 certainly helped promote a change
in his attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might not have said it to anybody, but I know he was real
frustrated about the other day,'' the Portland guard Bonzi Wells
said. ``Like he let everybody down.''
</P>
<P>
   With the home crowd serving as Wallace's support group for the
next two games, the Lakers could again find themselves under
extreme frontcourt pressure. A focused Wallace can resemble Pippen
in his quickness and sleight of hand, appearing to be constantly
open on offense and everywhere on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a tough match,'' said Portland's Greg Anthony, the former
Knick, who like Wallace struggled early in his career to find the
proper mix of emotion and intensity in his game. ``When he stays
under control and plays the way he did, it really bodes well for
us.
</P>
<P>
   ``You want to have a happy medium there. The best way to develop
that is with experience and over time. That's something Rasheed is
doing a pretty good job of. Even from Game 1 to Game 2, he was
frustrated with a few calls that didn't go his way, but he didn't
allow that to deter him from doing his job. He's garnering
experience with that each day and each game.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace shrugged his shoulders and offered no insight into his
turnaround from villain to hero. ``Just playing ball,'' he said of
his 11 points during the Trail Blazers' 28-8 third-quarter blowout
of the Lakers in Game 2.
</P>
<P>
   ``You pretty much feel like you're on a roll and can score at
any time,'' he said. ``They did the same thing to us in Game 1 when
they blew us up in that second quarter. That's just how it goes. If
you put a whole lot into it, it turns out to be a good story.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace's offensive production was only part of the plot. His
biggest impact came on defense, where he and Pippen helped center
Arvydas Sabonis stop Shaquille O'Neal, who scored only 9 points
through three quarters. Wallace also has spent significant time
guarding Kobe Bryant, who has 25 points in two games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't say I've shut him down,'' Wallace said. ``We've
been doubling on him, so it doesn't make sense for him to shoot
over a double or sometimes a triple team. So he just passes out
instead. It's just simple basketball.''
</P>
<P>
   To Portland Coach Mike Dunleavy, Wallace's play in Game 2 was a
simple case of the forward's channeling his energy toward the
Lakers instead of the officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference in Rasheed was about 20 minutes,'' Dunleavy
quipped afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not going to try and fool anybody,'' Dunleavy said
Thursday. ``I can talk all I want to Rasheed, say all I need to say
to him, say all the right things. But it comes down to him wanting
it. He's got to make that decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's heard it from me, from anybody and everybody you can
think of, all his coaches over the years, and at some point it's
got to become important to him. Last game was very important to
him, to step out and play the way he played.''
</P>
<P>
   Wallace said he has benefited from the presence of Pippen and
guard Steve Smith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It means a lot to have those veterans out there,'' Wallace
said. ``It makes my job easier because sometimes the refs might be
looking more at them, and that gives me opportunities to roam
around. Or vice versa. It's definitely an advantage for me.'' &QL;

GIULIANI CAMPAIGN RETURNING $2.8 MILLION, PONDERS REMAINDER 
</HEADLINE>
   By ELISABETH BUMILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Mayor Rudolph Giuliani's disbanded Senate campaign
will soon begin returning nearly $2.8 million to thousands of
contributors across the country, and will enclose with the checks a
letter suggesting that donors give the money instead to Rep. Rick
A. Lazio, a Republican from Long Island.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani is required by federal law to return this part of his
campaign fund within 60 days of his withdrawal from the race, but
he's not required to include a letter supporting Lazio's Senate
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hopefully, this will mean that at least some substantial
proportion of the people that donated to my campaign will donate to
his campaign,'' Giuliani said during a news conference. The $2.8
million had been set aside in a separate account to be used only
for the general election campaign.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor also said that he would campaign for Lazio in the
Senate race within the next week, but that he would skip the state
Republican Party's convention in Buffalo on May 30 to avoid
creating ``any kind of distraction'' from Lazio's nomination as the
party's candidate. Giuliani pledged once again Thursday to help
Lazio, who entered the race against Hillary Rodham Clinton, the
Democratic Party's candidate, less than 24 hours after Giuliani
withdrew because of his prostate cancer.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani's actions are essential if he wants to run for office
again in New York with the backing of the state Republican Party.
Even though the mayor dropped out of the party's Senate race for
health reasons, there remains some hostility toward him because of
his protracted decision-making and the subsequent unraveling of his
personal life. On May 10, Giuliani announced publicly that he was
seeking a separation from his wife, but he did not privately tell
her first. Two days later, he appeared in public with Judith
Nathan, calling her his ``very good'' friend.
</P>
<P>
   John H. Gross, Giuliani's campaign treasurer, said Thursday that
when the campaign finished paying its bills _ including the $2.8
million it must return to contributors _ it would have slightly
more than $3 million left out of the $20 million raised.
</P>
<P>
   The disposition of the $3 million is likely of interest to
Lazio, as well as to state and national Republicans. It may also be
important to Giuliani's political future.
</P>
<P>
   Legally, Giuliani may keep the money for future political
campaigns, or he could donate it to charity. There is another
option: Although by law the mayor may not give the money directly
to Lazio, he could give it to state or national Republican Party
committees, which could then spend it on Lazio's behalf. And state
and national Republican party officias are eager for Lazio to catch
up to Clinton in fund-raising. As of March 31, Lazio had $3.5
million in his campaign fund, while Clinton had $6.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   There have been some indications Giuliani will give some of
those fund to Republican Party committees.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Giuliani spoke to Sen. Mitch McConnell, the
chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, to
discuss what could be done with his remaining money. ``There's a
good chunk of change there,'' said a committee spokesman who asked
he not be identified. ``Senator McConnell outlined what we would
like to do if we had the funds.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Giuliani and Lazio campaigns, which have much to
gain from cooperation, continued in that spirit Thursday. Giuliani
said that his campaign was doing everything possible to help
Lazio's fledgling operation, and Giuliani's former campaign
manager, Bruce Teitelbaum, has presided at three meetings between
members of the Giuliani and Lazio campaigns this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Congressman Lazio has been effusive in his praise for the
level of cooperation that he's getting from Bruce Teitelbaum and
the people that work for me,'' Giuliani said.
</P>
<P>
   It was unclear whether that cooperation would include the
Giuliani campaign's highly valuable mailing lists of political
donors that fed the mayor's prodigiously successful fund-raising
operation. Teitelbaum would only say that the two campaigns were
``continuing to talk'' about whether Lazio would get the lists.
</P>
<P>
   Teitelbaum also said the Giuliani campaign took in $44,000 on
Wednesday alone, all from people who wrote checks to the mayor
after he dropped out of the race. All money received after
Giuliani's withdrawal, Teitelbaum said, would be returned.

FRAZAR HANDLES WIND AND ROLLS TO A THREE-SHOT LEAD 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: Texas)   By CLIFTON BROWN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DUBLIN, Ohio _ On a day when only three players broke 70,
Harrison Frazar broke away from the field.
</P>
<P>
   To call the first round of the Memorial Tournament a test would
be an understatement. Not only did tricky winds gust to 20 mph
Thursday, but the Muirfield Village Golf Club course has also been
toughened for this year's event under the watchful eyes of the
designer and the host, Jack Nicklaus.
</P>
<P>
   But Frazar grew up in Abilene, Texas., where golfers learn to
deal with wind as soon as they learn to grip a club. Thursday,
Frazar had an extremely firm grip on his game as he shot an
impressive 6--under 66 to take a three-stroke lead.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Perry and Tom Scherrer were tied for second place at 69,
while four players were tied at 70: Justin Leonard, Greg Norman,
Gabriel Hjertstedt and Greg Kraft.
</P>
<P>
   How solid was Frazar? He is the first PGA Tour player this year
to lead by three strokes after the first round. Thursday, he was
the only player who did not make a bogey. And though the par-5
holes have been made more difficult this year at Muirfield, Frazar
birdied all four of them.
</P>
<P>
   After two third-place finishes this year in Greensboro, N.C.,
and New Orleans, Frazar, at age 28, believes his first tour victory
could be forthcoming, perhaps even this weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up in Texas, which just makes you more comfortable when
the wind blows,'' said Frazar, who is 35th on this year's money
list with $524,085. ``You're used to hearing the wind whistle
through your hat, so the panic mode doesn't come in as much. I
don't get to the golf course and hope that it blows 20 mph. But if
it does, I feel like I've got a pretty good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   Frazar's work was far from done. Tiger Woods, the world's No. 1
player and the defending champion, was five strokes behind Frazar
after shooting an opening-round 71.
</P>
<P>
   The most popular player at this course remained Nicklaus, who
was honored Wednesday during an emotional ceremony, and who
provided some excitement Thursday. Nicklaus struggled for most of
his round, but he birdied three of the final four holes to finish
with a very respectable 75.
</P>
<P>
   Leave it to Nicklaus, at age 60, to finish strong. After making
an 11-foot putt for birdie at No. 15, he hit his approach shot at
No. 17 to six feet, then made the birdie putt. Then, after missing
the green on his approach shot at No. 18, Nicklaus ended the day by
chipping in for a birdie from 20 feet, as the gallery roared.
</P>
<P>
   ``From where I was, it was a lot of fun to finish that way,''
Nicklaus said. ``I struggled something awful with my putter, but I
finally made one at No. 15, and that opened up the floodgates.''
</P>
<P>
   It was also a good day for Nicklaus' son, Gary, who shot 72,
despite making bogeys on No. 16 and No. 18.
</P>
<P>
   ``Knowing what this golf tournament means to my father and to my
mother, I've wanted to play in this for a long time,'' said Gary
Nicklaus, a rookie on tour, who lost to Phil Mickelson in a playoff
last month at the BellSouth Classic. ``It's very special for me to
be here.''

AFTER LOSING EWING EARLY, KNICKS LOSE THE GAME LATE 
</HEADLINE>
  By SELENA ROBERTS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   INDIANAPOLIS _ The time and the place were eerily familiar when
the Indiana Pacers ran back to the other end of the court and
Patrick Ewing stopped still in front of his own bench six minutes
into Game 2 of the Eastern Conference finals Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   One year ago Ewing was in this same city, on the Pacers' floor,
when he partly tore his Achilles' tendon in the pregame layup line.
He played through that Game 2 only to miss the rest of the
playoffs. This time he could not make it any longer.
</P>
<P>
   With his playoff future uncertain, Ewing limped away from Game 2
Thursday night after he sprained the peroneal tendon in his right
foot. It was unclear as to whether the injury was related to the
sore foot he had that forced him to miss Wednesday's practice.
Ewing ducked into the locker room and did not return. In his
absence, there was the same desperate atmosphere the Knicks'
thrived in last season, but their supply of pixie dust ran out when
a struggling Latrell Sprewell missed a turnaround jumper that would
have tied the game with 5.8 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   After a 3-for-14 night, Sprewell hammered the ball into the
floor after the Knicks' very last chance slipped away, too. Dale
Davis missed two free throws but grabbed his own rebound, his 16th
of the night, and passed the ball to Jalen Rose, who dunked at the
buzzer to give the Pacers an 88-84 victory. The loss left the
Knicks down, two games to none, in this four-of-seven-game series.
Game 3 is Saturday afternoon at Madison Square Garden.
</P>
<P>
   With foul trouble causing attrition, the Pacers took advantage
of the Knicks thinning talent in the last 30 seconds of the game.
As he grabbed a pass, Reggie Miller was crashed into on the
perimeter by an overzealous Allan Houston with 28 seconds on the
clock. Houston fouled out, and Miller hit both free throws to break
an 84-84 tie. Without Houston, Sprewell became the go-to man but
blew his chance in the closing seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Knicks nearly pulled it off. Just as the Knicks did
last year, they leaned on Larry Johnson for 25 points, Marcus Camby
for 11 rebounds and a team pieced together with a grab bag of
previously unused players. Chris Dudley, Kurt Thomas and John
Wallace all contributed. Coach Jeff Van Gundy tried everything,
including the use of a big backcourt, in the last three minutes of
the game.
</P>
<P>
   With Johnson's strength in the low post, the Knicks held a 67-61
entering the fourth quarter. The Knicks then found themselves tied
after losing a loose ball. On a miss by Jackson, Rik Smits came up
with the ball on the floor, went in for a dunk and was fouled with
3:01 by Camby. Smits converted the 3-point play and the game was
tied at 80-80. The game was tied again at 84-84 when Rose let a
17-footer fly as the shot clock wound down with 55.5 seconds left
in the game.
</P>
<P>
   Rose led the Pacers with 24 points, while the Knicks were led by
Johnson and the 15 points by Houston, who was in foul trouble.
Fouls devastated the Knicks. They held the Pacers to 36 percent
from the field, but attempted just 18 free throws compared to the
38 by Indiana.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Knicks were in an adverse position without Ewing on the
floor. Not only were they missing his offense, but they were also
missing his presence on the boards. A makeshift group now had to
hold off a Pacers team that outmuscled them on the boards and
scored 102 points in Game 1 to become the first team in the
playoffs to score more than 90 against the Knicks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our defense can never stop,'' Van Gundy said before the game.
``This is a team that you can make one effort or two efforts, and
they can still get a good shot. For 24 seconds, our defense can't
stop. It's got to be tenacious and aggressive.''
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks were all of the above, plus a little lucky, at the
beginning of the game. The menace from Game 1, Austin Croshere, had
open looks on the perimeter and some layup opportunities, but
missed everything in an 0-for-7 first half. Smits was also missing
the rhythm he had on Tuesday night and shot 1 for 7 in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
   With an inspired 14-point effort by Johnson, the Knicks held a
43-42 lead at halftime. They grabbed the edge by holding the Pacers
to 33.3 percent shooting from the field and tying their opponents
in rebounding, 25-25. Because of foul trouble, Davis, Johnson's
bane in Game 1, played just 11 minutes and did not even attempt a
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Ewing's absence only temporarily discombobulated the Knicks in
the first half. They still had a low-post threat in Johnson. Even
before Ewing pulled up with his injury, the Knicks ran the ball
right through Johnson and right at Davis and then Croshere. By the
end of the first half, it was clear that no one could stop Johnson
in the post.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks had a chance to get their thoughts together during
halftime and plan their approach without Ewing. They stuck with
Johnson. With Houston and Sprewell struggling to hit shots
consistently, Johnson did the work inside and outside. With just
under nine minutes left in the third quarter, he lined up on the
perimeter and hit a 3-pointer to give the Knicks a 51-47 lead.
Drenched in jeers from the crowd, Johnson unveiled the ``Big L''
and ran back down the court.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers came back to tie the game on a 3-pointer by Jackson
with 6:22 left. From there, the game became a series of punches and
counterpunches. Houston scored, then Miller blew by Sprewell on the
baseline and pulled up for a jumper. After a missed free throw by
Chris Childs, Miller gave the Pacers a 59-58 lead when Houston gave
him just a sliver of room to pop a 20-footer.
</P>
<P>
   But the Knicks would not fold. Camby and Dudley started
searching out rebounds and second chances. Johnson was there to
capitalize for the Knicks. In the closing minute of the third
quarter, he put down two field goals and helped the Knicks take a
66-61 lead heading into the fourth quarter. At this point, Johnson
had 21 points.
</P>
<P>
   Once again, the Knicks were responsive to dire circumstances.
When Ewing left the game with 5:29 remaining in the first quarter,
he had 4 points and the Knicks had a 14-10 lead. Thomas was on the
spot and came through with some good defense on Smits and a nice
jumper.
</P>
<P>
   The Pacers could not seize control of the game despite the 12
first-half points Rose scored in front of Sprewell.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks' bench came through. Camby, Thomas and Childs
combined to score 15 first-half points. Camby was moving much more
assertively. He had five of the Knicks' 25 rebounds at the half,
that total tying the same Pacers team that had beaten them so badly
on the boards in Game 1.
</P>
<P>
   The Knicks established a different tone from the start, while
the Pacers seemed sluggish and not as sharp. The Pacers have tended
to fall off their edge after a big victory, and Coach Larry Bird
said his team had a tendency to be soft in prosperity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it's soft; that's a tough word,'' Rose said
before the game. ``But at the same time, we are a team that needs
to stay on edge. We like a challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the Knicks. And they had one once Ewing pulled up with a
foot injury.  &QL;

AFRICAN DIAMOND CONCERN TO SELL SHARES IN LONDON
</HEADLINE>
  By ALAN COWELL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ For years, as diamonds from African war zones fueled
conflict, African diamond-trading has been associated with
secretive deals between warlords in the bush and unscrupulous
buyers who trade gems for weapons.
</P>
<P>
   As of next month, though, in a remarkable business deal, an
African diamond company plans to sell shares on the London Stock
Exchange, offering investors a stake in a venture that includes as
partners the embattled governments of Congo and Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
   What investors will be buying, essentially, are the pickings
from a billion-dollar diamond mine concession, granted by decree
from the Congolese government and guarded by Zimbabwean soldiers,
at the heart of one of Africa's most troubled, decayed and divided
nations.
</P>
<P>
   Zimbabwean troops have been in Congo since 1998 supporting
President Laurent Kabila's government along with Angola and Namibia
against rebels backed by Rwanda and Uganda.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the diamond company, Oryx Diamonds Ltd., will be
offered on the Alternative Investment Market, which is part of the
London exchange, on June 13. The company is a result of a merger
between Petra Diamonds Ltd., run from South Africa with registered
offices in Bermuda, and Oryx Natural Resources, incorporated in the
Cayman Islands but run from Oman. Shareholders are scheduled to
approve that merger formally on June 12.
</P>
<P>
   The deal is thought to be the first overtly commercial venture
involving two of the countries in one of Africa's most complex
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
   It has produced a company keen to establish legitimacy at a time
when Western governments are campaigning to end Africa's linkage of
diamonds and war.
</P>
<P>
   Geoffrey White, the deputy managing director, said the new
company had sought to avoid secrecy about its dealings in light of
potential adverse publicity.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have got nothing to hide,'' he said. ``We are a company
that believes there's a commercial opportunity far greater than the
risk associated with it.''
</P>
<P>
   White denied that the diamonds would be mined in a war zone.
``The area where we are is totally secure,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The company, moreover, has enlisted a former U.S. ambassador in
Oman and elsewhere, Frances Cook, and a high-ranking official of
the 54-nation Commonwealth, Moses Anafu, to join its board as
nonexecutive directors, according to public documents. ``I'm very
positive about this involvement,'' Cook said.
</P>
<P>
   Its officers also include the chief executive, Thamer bin Said
al-Shanfari, a 32-year-old Omani businessman, who has invested
millions of dollars into the deal, and Adonis Pouroulis, a
30-year-old South African mining executive whose company, Petra,
already trades on the Alternative Investment Market.
</P>
<P>
   Petra's shares almost doubled, to 80 pence, or about $1.20, when
the deal was announced on May 18.
</P>
<P>
   According to a prospectus sent to shareholders, the company will
own a 25-year concession on a large area 20 miles south of
Mbuji-Mayi, Congo's main industrial diamond zone. A geologist's
assessment in the prospectus valued the concession at $1 billion.
The profits will be shared between the company, Oryx Diamonds,
taking 40 percent, and two companies with ties to the Zimbabwean
and Congolese governments.
</P>
<P>
   Osleg, meaning Operation Sovereign Legitimacy, a Zimbabwean
company with close ties to both the government of President Robert
Mugabe and to the commander of Zimbabwe's 11,000 troops in Congo,
will take 40 percent. And a company called Comiex-Congo-Operation
Sovereign Legitimacy, will take 20 percent, the prospectus says.
</P>
<P>
   Comiex is described variously in published reports as linked to
the Congolese Army and to Kabila. But David Price, a British lawyer
working for Pouroulis, denied that the company was seen as Kabila's
personal investment vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   According to diplomats, bankers and others, both Mugabe and
Kabila had close ties to it. The Congolese diamond concession, for
instance, was taken by decree from the Congolese state diamond
company, Miba, and given to Oryx with a six-year tax moratorium,
according to Jim Williams, an independent technical consultant who
prepared a report on the concession for the merger prospectus.
Williams called the concession's kimberlite diamond deposits ``a
future world-class resource.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal has nonetheless raised questions among senior diplomats
here about two important political issues: how it will affect
efforts to bring peace to Congo, and what role it will play in the
ferocious government campaign in Zimbabwe to secure victory in
parliamentary elections scheduled for June 24 and 25 _ the first in
20 years of independence in which Mugabe has faced a serious
challenge.

MERRILL LYNCH MANAGEMENT REORGANIZED 
</HEADLINE>
  By PATRICK McGEEHAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three months after taking over Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.'s brokerage
operations, E. Stanley O'Neal has shaken up its management team,
bringing in a deputy who put the bull back in the firm's
advertising.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, the first person not a stockbroker to run the nation's
largest brokerage network, has named another nonbroker, James
Gorman, to be the No. 2 executive, people inside the firm said. He
also moved a few executives out of top jobs and promoted several
others as part of a reorganization of the unit, those people said.
</P>
<P>
   A Merrill spokesman declined to discuss the changes because they
had not been announced to the firm's brokers.
</P>
<P>
   The changes were anxiously anticipated by Merrill's 14,200
brokers, who knew little about O'Neal when he was promoted from
chief financial officer to succeed John L. Steffens, the longtime
head of the firm's brokerage business, in February. As O'Neal made
the rounds, meeting managers and top brokers around the country,
rumors swirled about how he might reshuffle the troops.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the biggest surprise is the luring of Gorman, a former
consultant with McKinsey &AMP; Co., who has been Merrill's chief
marketing officer. Gorman essentially will serve as the chief
operating officer of the brokerage operations and would be next in
line for O'Neal's job, said a person who knows him.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, 48, is widely viewed within the firm as most likely to
succeed David H. Komansky as Merrill's chief executive. If that
happens soon, O'Neal could be the first black chief executive of a
major Wall Street firm. Komansky, who, like his predecessors,
worked his way up through the broker ranks, is scheduled to retire
in four years.
</P>
<P>
   Like O'Neal, Gorman is highly regarded in Merrill's boardroom.
Most recently, he engineered an alliance between Merrill and HSBC
Holdings, a London-based banking company, to set up online banking
services in several countries in Europe and Asia. Before that, he
revamped Merrill's brand marketing, putting the bull and the image
of bullishness back into Merrill's ads after a hiatus of several
years.
</P>
<P>
   As part of the reorganization, O'Neal is grouping together all
of Merrill's direct dealings with customers, ranging from
individual investors to owners of small businesses to pension
plans. He also is renaming the brokerage network, now known as
national sales, the advisory business to emphasize that the firm's
main service is to provide financial advice not to sell stocks and
bonds. People who know O'Neal and Gorman say that they believe that
the quality of their service will define financial services firms.
</P>
<P>
   Among other management changes, O'Neal picked four national
sales directors, each with responsibility for an aspect of the
brokerage business. One of the four, Jim Shoaf, already was a
national sales director, overseeing the western half of the
country. His counterpart, Robert Sherman, who oversaw the eastern
half, is retiring from the brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   The other three will be Robert Dineen, who had been managing
Merrill's brokerage operations in New York City; Robert Mulholland,
who had managed brokerage operations in New Jersey; and Michael
Vorst, who managed operations in Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   To make room for them, three executives are taking new jobs
elsewhere in the firm. Madeline Weinstein, a senior vice president
who was the highest ranking woman in the brokerage operation, will
move into corporate headquarters to take on some of Gorman's duties
as director for corporate marketing. Allen Jones, also a senior
vice president, will work with wealthy clients who need trusts and
other wealth-management plans.
</P>
<P>
   People inside the firm said that O'Neal has no plans to make
other changes among managers in the brokerage network.

   DRY _ You won't find many holiday weekends where most people
hope for rain, but this is one. Because as people head outdoors to
celebrate Memorial Day, in the middle of flood season, they'll find
streams and small lakes withered into shallow late summer
conditions by a regional drouth in Missouri and northeast Kansas.
Missouri Gov. Mel Carnahan on Wednesday activated a drought
assistance team. Several Ozark float streams are at record low
levels for May, three feet low on the Gasconade River in Phelps
County. Ponds and community lakes are shrinking and leaving pontoon
boats on mud flats. Water flows in northeast Kansas rivers are far
below normal. The Kansas Water Office is considering banning
irrigation from the upper Republican and Deleware river systems. By

REGULATORY SNAGS CITED AS GENE TECHNOLOGY DEAL ENDS 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Wis.)  By ANDREW POLLACK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The PE Corp., which is racing the government to sequence the
human genome, has dropped plans to acquire a small company with
promising DNA analysis technology, at least in part because of
antitrust concerns on the part of the Justice Department,
executives said.
</P>
<P>
   PE Biosystems, the unit of PE that dominates the market for
machines used to sequence genes, had announced in January its plan
to buy Third Wave Technologies Inc., for about $330 million in
stock. But late Thursday the two companies said that they had
mutually agreed to terminate the acquisition.
</P>
<P>
   Third Wave, a privately held company in Madison, Wis., is
developing technology for identifying variations in genes among
individuals. Such variations, which can determine whether a person
has blue or brown eyes or is susceptible to a certain disease, are
expected to be the key in the future to so-called personalized
medicine _ drugs tailored to each patient's genetic makeup. So
there is now a race to find and analyze these differences, which
are known as single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNP's.
</P>
<P>
   Celera Genomics, another subsidiary of PE Corp. that is
competing with a government-backed project to obtain the sequence
of all the letters in the human genetic code, has said that it
plans to move into personalized medicine. The acquisition of Third
Wave Technologies was expected to help in that task.
</P>
<P>
   Lance Fors, chief executive of Third Wave, said that the
antitrust review of the merger looked like it was taking longer
than expected, with no assurance of approval. With the market for
SNP-finding equipment poised to boom, it needed to be free to act.
``We are in the regulatory approval limbo and it makes it very hard
to execute business plans,'' he said. ``It was a protracted review.
The market opportunities could have passed us by.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael W. Hunkapiller, president of PE Biosystems, said the
company had received ``no formal notification from the Justice
Department that they had concerns.'' But he also said the review
was taking long enough that the companies decided they needed to
move more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Third Wave and PE Biosystems said they would still collaborate.
``We still have access to the technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hunkapiller said he was not aware of any broader investigation
of PE. And two people who were questioned by the Justice
Department, who spoke on the condition they not be named, said the
concern appeared confined to this deal.
</P>
<P>
   According to people in the industry, there appeared to be
concern that PE Biosystems might not make the Third Wave technology
widely available. There is also some concern that PE would have a
strong position in the two types of technology used in studying
gene variations.
</P>
<P>
   PE is already a leading supplier of chemicals and equipment for
the polymerase chain reaction, or PCR, a widely used technique for
replicating DNA so there is enough to be analyzed. Virtually all
the systems used to detect gene variations rely on PCR. But Third
Wave's technology does not, making it an alternative, and one that
is possibly cheaper and less time-consuming.
</P>
<P>
   Still, there were other factors, including the nearly 40 percent
decline in PE Biosystems share price since the deal was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Holden, chairman and chief executive of the SNP
Consortium, which was created by 10 large drug companies to search
for the gene variations, said he was surprised by antitrust concern
because there were many companies offering technology to find
SNP's. He said the acquisition of Third Wave would have been
welcomed by the drug companies because it would have provided more
financial resources for the small company to perfect its
technology.

CRAYON LAB TESTS CONFLICTING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ANDREW SCHNEIDER and CAROL SMITH  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Binney &AMP; Smith, makers of Crayola crayons, Thursday said an
independent laboratory had tested its crayons and found that they
do not contain asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   RJ Lee Group of Pittsburgh, an EPA-approved laboratory, said it
conducted three types of tests on two crayons and issued a report
to the company stating the crayons did not contain asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   The findings conflict with results obtained by two independent
government-certified labs who did tests at the request of the
Seattle Post-Intelligencer.
</P>
<P>
   The labs used by the P-I have reconfirmed the existence of
carcinogenic tremolite and anthrophyllite fibers in repeated tests
of three brands of crayons -- Crayola, Prang and Rose Art. In
testing those brands, the labs found asbestos in 32 of 40 crayons
tested. Both RJ Lee Group and the labs used by the P-I used
multiple testing procedures, including polarized light microscopy
(PLM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron
microscopy (SEM).
</P>
<P>
   Ken Bunting, the P-I's executive editor, said Thursday, ``The
P-I reported this story with balance, and great care. The tests
about which we reported were repeated numerous times. We have no
reason to doubt the findings of the government-certified
laboratories we commissioned.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have given all the results provided to us to the Consumer
Product Safety Commission,'' Bunting added, ``and we have
encouraged the labs to cooperate fully with the commission.''
</P>
<P>
   Other media organizations, school districts and government
agencies throughout the country said Thursday they are also testing
crayons for asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   KIRO, Channel 7, the CBS affiliate in Seattle, hired Orion
Environmental Laboratories test to crayons, chalk and other
products containing talc Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked through the microscope and I must admit I was
surprised to see fibers of tremolite clearly visible in the
Crayola,'' said Donna McNeal, director of the lab.
</P>
<P>
   McNeal said she also found asbestos in the foreign-made chalk
sample supplied by the TV station, and that the CPSC had been
notified of their findings.
</P>
<P>
   Binney &AMP; Smith said Thursday it also had turned over its new
results to the CPSC, which is conducting its own testing.
</P>
<P>
   In a prepared statement, Richard Lee of RJ Lee Group said: ``We
examined the optical properties of the minerals, as well as the
crystal structure of the talc and finished crayons, by PLM, TEM,
and SEM.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combination of those techniques, which definitively
determine whether or not asbestos is present, confirmed that the
talc used in Crayola crayons and the finished products do not
contain asbestos and are safe for consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Binney &AMP; Smith Chief Operating Officer Al Hunyadi said in a
statement: ``These findings reaffirm the commitment to safety we've
upheld for nearly 100 years. Consumers who use Crayola products at
home and in school can continue to feel good about using them.''
</P>
<P>
   Thursday, while the CPSC continued its testing, the
Environmental Protection Agency in Washington prepared a briefing
sheet for its regional offices to use if they are asked about the
safety of crayons.
</P>
<P>
   In the paper, the agency said it ``would suggest that until more
information is available on this matter that crayons not be used.
This would be particularly true for children at ages generally 3
years old or younger, where there is a likelihood that they could,
and would, put the crayons into their mouths.''
</P>
<P>
   The agency's paper also said, ``While extremely low levels of
asbestos in crayons may not pose much of an actual risk to
children, any exposure would be unnecessary.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Public Health -- Seattle &AMP; King County issued an
advisory cautioning prents about household environmental hazards,
including asbestos.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main message for parents at this point is to make sure
that their children are not eating non-food items, crayons
included,'' said Alonzo Plough, director of the agencly.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recent study just helps to remind parents of the hazards
that may be associated with consuming non-food items.''
</P>
<P>
   In its advisory, the health department also said: ``Although
there is no safe level of exposure level to asbestos, crayons are
not the only potential source of asbestos exposure in the urban
environment.''

 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JODY GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
ATLANTA _ Ask Andres Galarraga about last year, and he'll tell you
about the landscapes he painted.
<TEXT>
<P>
   His face serene, Galarraga describes sitting in his back yard
with oil paints, capturing his swimming pool and lush Florida
vegetation, an exercise that calmed and soothed a restless spirit.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Andres Galarraga about last year, and he'll tell you about
spending time with his family.
</P>
<P>
   A smile forms as Galarraga talks about getting to spend an
uninterrupted year with his three daughters for the first time,
each day more special than the last.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Andres Galarraga about last year, and he'll tell you how he
rediscovered religion.
</P>
<P>
   His eyes glaze a bit as he describes a dream in which God came
to him and chose to make his world whole again.
</P>
<P>
   Keep asking Galarraga about last year, and he'll eventually get
to those scary, anxious moments, when an uncomfortable, nagging
back pain was finally diagnosed as non-Hodgkin's lymphoma.
</P>
<P>
   But last year wasn't about suffering through cancer for
Galarraga. Last year wasn't even about surviving. It was about
getting strong, both physically and mentally, and regaining control
of life.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to just come back,'' said the veteran first
baseman, who with his Atlanta Braves teammates will open a
three-game series against the Astros today at Enron Field. ``I
didn't want to just be in the lineup. I wanted to be able to help
the team.''
</P>
<P>
   His isn't the first story of an athlete to beat cancer. It isn't
even the first in baseball _ Eric Davis and Darryl Strawberry
survived the deadly illness, their ordeals bringing relief and
inspiration to Galarraga last year. But Galarraga might prove to be
the biggest success story.
</P>
<P>
   Diagnosed in March 1999, Galarraga not only rejoined his
teammates this season, he's one of the top offensive players in the
National League. Galarraga, 38, is batting .346, ninth-best in the
NL. He is fifth in the league with 43 RBIs and has 12 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   His numbers thus far are his best since his years in Colorado,
when he won the batting title with a .370 average in 1993 and had
47 homers and 150 RBIs in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first day of spring training, I was nervous,'' Galarraga
said. ``I was excited just to have the bat in my hand. I was just
hoping I could hit it hard again.''
</P>
<P>
   Nine months after he finished chemotherapy, no trace of the
cancer remains, inside or out. His hair, lost during the
treatments, has grown back, though a bit more gray than before. His
body, which bloated and ballooned with as much as a 40-pound weight
gain during the treatments, is a sleek and muscular 235 pounds, one
of the more fit bodies in the Braves' locker room.
</P>
<P>
   Though Galarraga will continue to be checked regularly for
recurrence of cancer, chances are excellent it will never return.
</P>
<P>
   ``His statistics aside, just the fact that he's back here, just
his presence itself is inspiring,'' teammate Chipper Jones said.
``He's the poster child for coming back from cancer. But I'm not
surprised. I knew that if anybody could beat cancer, it would be
Andres. He has an amazing spirit, an amazing heart.''
</P>
<P>
   But Galarraga admits that spirit was tested.
</P>
<P>
   It all started toward the end of the 1998 season. Galarraga had
been feeling some tightness and soreness in his back. It was more
uncomfortable than painful, so he simply played through it. As an
athlete who is fairly in tune with his body, he assumed it was
nerve pain that would ease when the season ended. It didn't.
</P>
<P>
   He knew he shouldn't ignore it. He saw doctors, had it X-rayed.
Nothing was found. He took an anti-inflammatory medication and
waited. But the pain wouldn't ease. Finally, as spring training
neared, he underwent an MRI. Doctors saw something that looked
suspicious and called him back for further tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got a call and said, `Oh, my God, something's happened,'''
Galarraga said. ``I never, never, never imagined cancer.''
</P>
<P>
   It's still a word he has trouble saying. When he speaks of the
illness, he calls it ``lymphoma,'' choosing to eliminate the ``C''
word from his vocabulary. The disease had already touched his life
once, and it didn't have a happy ending. His father, Francisco,
died of stomach cancer in 1992, and Galarraga admits he hears
``cancer'' and thinks ``death.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I heard (the diagnosis) and felt like I was going to die the
next day,'' Galarraga said.
</P>
<P>
   Doctors quickly reassured him that medical advances have made it
possible to survive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Galarraga decided he
would be one of the lucky ones. But he still had to inform family
and friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest part was to tell my kids and my mother,'' he said.
``I just tried to smile and didn't say `cancer.' I said `lymphoma,'
which didn't sound as scary. I didn't want to say that word because
they would think I was going to die. We tried never to use that
word at home.''
</P>
<P>
   He told his fans in Atlanta and around the major leagues in a
handwritten and signed statement that was eventually published in
several newspapers. It read, ``I was looking forward to the '99
season, unfortunately, I'm hit with this setback. But I promise
you, I will be back.''
</P>
<P>
   His body, too, was tested. Galarraga embarked on a series of six
chemotherapy treatments three weeks apart. He would get treatments
in the morning. By nighttime, he would be sick to his stomach,
sometimes unable to get out of bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``After that first day, I was like, `Oh, my God, how much more
of this can I take?''' he said. ``(On those days), I didn't want to
talk to anybody, I didn't want to listen to anybody. I just wanted
to be alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, chemotherapy days were the only time he felt ill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would never be in bed, never looked sick,'' he said. ``I was
always smiling. But there were days when my kids came home from
school and it looked to me like they'd been crying. We had to talk
about it. I had to tell them the truth always because their friends
in school would talk.''
</P>
<P>
   It helped that good news came almost immediately. After his
first two treatments, doctors did tests to discover whether his
body was responding. He nervously waited for word.
</P>
<P>
   ``The doctor came in and said, `Hey, it's 75 percent gone,''' he
said. ``I was so happy, excited. It really helped me mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   After two more treatments, the news was better. The tumor had
shrunk by 95 percent. That's when Galarraga began planning his
return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had this dream,'' Galarraga said. ``God put his hand in my
body. I knew I was going to be better and I was going to play
again. I love this game. It gave me strength.''
</P>

   He rejoined his teammates in September but only as a sideline
spectator. He was there for the end of the regular season, the
playoffs and the World Series. He watched as the Braves batted .200
as a team against the Yankees. He vowed to return and right that
wrong this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``With me and Javy (Lopez), that's another 80 home runs, another
200 RBIs,'' said Galarraga, whose watched the postseason with
Lopez, who was out with a torn knee ligament. ``I know we can help
those guys to be in better shape to beat the Yankees or somebody
else.''
</P>
<P>
   First came plenty of hard work. He had to work to lose weight
and get back in shape, something he had never had to do before. He
hadn't been able to exercise, hadn't thrown, caught or hit for an
entire year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first day of spring training, I was like a little kid,''
said Galarraga, who turns 39 next month. ``Worse than a rookie. I
got there two days before the pitchers and catchers. I couldn't
wait.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates and coaches could hardly believe what they saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't expect what we saw in spring training the very first
day,'' manager Bobby Cox said. ``He went through a very demanding
fielding drill as if nothing was wrong with him. He was hitting
balls 500-plus feet from the first pitch that was thrown. It's an
amazing, amazing story.''
</P>
<P>
   One with any number of happy endings.
</P>
<P>
   There was the charity game in his hometown of Caracas,
Venezuela, to benefit victims of Venezuelan mudslides.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ovation they gave me was for about five minutes,''
Galarraga said. ``I had to take my hat off three or four times. My
eyes were getting wet.''
</P>
<P>
   Then, finally, there was opening day.
</P>
<P>
   Galarraga made a diving catch with bases loaded in the seventh
inning to keep the Braves and Rockies locked in a scoreless tie. In
the bottom of that inning, Galarraga drilled a home run off Pedro
Astacio to welcome himself back into the league.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a monkey off my back,'' he said. ``The bases loaded, a
diving catch, a home run. It was like a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   It's the feel-good movie of the year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a fan of the game,'' teammate Bobby Bonilla said. ``I love
watching great players, and he's one of those. He's been one of the
best offensive players in the league over the last six or seven
years, and our game needs that. The game really missed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Almost as much as he missed the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like my rookie year when I wanted to be 24 hours in the
ballpark,'' Galarraga said. ``I love this game so much. I want to
be here forever.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates believe he will be.
