</P>
<P>
The hospital, covering an area of 48,112 square metres,

<HEADLINE> S. Arabia Donates 30 Million Dollars to PA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia has donated 30
million U.S. dollars to the Palestinian Authority (PA) to help
relieve the economic plight in the Palestinian self-rule areas,
according to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based
in East Jerusalem, today.
</P>
<P>
PA President Yasser Arafat broke the news when he was
attending a Palestinian Legislative Council session in Bethlehem
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said that out of the total sum, some 10 to 12 million
dollars will be allocated for Hebron and the remainder
will go to the Jerusalem Committee.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the donations were made during Arafat's
visit to Saudi Arabia earlier this week.
</P>
<P>
During his meetings with King Fahd and other Saudi officials,
Arafat asked his hosts to provide direct financial aid to the
autonomous areas and, more specifically, to allow Palestinian
laborers to return to the kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The Gulf Arab states, including Saudi Arabia, expelled about
300,000 Palestinian workers after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait
in 1990. Although relations between Saudi Arabia and the PLO
have improved -- this is Arafat's third visit since the Gulf
War -- Palestinian workers have not been invited to go back.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia has provided regular financial aid to the
Palestinians within the framework of the World Bank. At the 1993
international conference on Palestinian infrastructure development
held in Washington, Saudi Arabia joined the U.S. and other donor
countries in pledging to offer 100 million dollars in the first
year.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Kariba dam, which is the main
supplier of hydro-electric power to Zimbabwe and Zambia, has
fallen to such a low level it will not have enough water to
generate electricity up to the next rain season.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean Lands and Water Resources Minister Kumbirai Kangai
said on Wednesday that both the lake and the river Zambezi which
feeds it were now very low.
</P>
<P>
While Kariba Dam was now 13.6 percent full, the Zambezi River,
which is on the border of Zimbabwe and Zambia, had registered its
lowest level in 30 years, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
''The maximum rate of flow of the Zambezi in May was one of
the lowest on record,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Low levels on the river were normally recorded around
September and October, he added.
</P>
<P>
''We can expect the September and October levels this year to
be lower than the same period last year when we recorded the
lowest levels since records started being taken in 1910,'' he
said.

<P>
HARARE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's defence forces will not
sit idle in times of peace but will instead help implement
government development projects, particularly in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference today, Zimbabwean Defence
Minister Movern Mahachi encouraged the members of the defence
forces to assist in building roads, schools, bridges, clinics and

efficiency and effectiveness for future military operations,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mahachi, who was officially launching this year's defence
forces community assistance week, a prelude to the Defence Forces

critical social, economic and political developments are

He said financial resources permitting, refurbishment of the
weaponry system and equipment will be accorded higher priority in
order to maintain an acceptable level of military capability and

<HEADLINE> Lebanon's Army Commander Refuses "Lebanon First" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon's Army Commander Emile
Lahoud described here today an Israeli proposal on an unilateral
withdrawal from south Lebanon as a "deceit" aimed at prejudicing
Lebanese-Syrian relations.
</P>
<P>
Lahoud said that thanks to the army, the state of Lebanon
managed "to prevent the enemy (of Israel) from achieving
its goals, the most important of which is to separate Syria and
Lebanon in the peace negotiations in order to damage their
strategic interests."
</P>
<P>
The last attempt of Israel was what it disseminated of a
withdrawal from south Lebanon, he said, noting that the
suggestion was a "deceit which is not new and by which the enemy
is trying to prejudice the unity of the Lebanese and Syrian
positions."
</P>
<P>
The attempt, he said, would only "lead to additional solid
cooperation in various fields between the two brotherly
countries."
</P>
<P>
Lahoud's remarks came in a speech he addressed to the
Lebanese army on the occassion of the 51th Army Day, which falls
on August 1.
</P>
<P>
He called on the army to permanently make efforts for
strengthening the security and stability in the country and to
double the confidence of the people in the army and in the
country's institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli proposal on unilateral withdrawal from south
Lebanon, which was dubbed "Lebanon First," was deliberately
leaked to the Israeli media to draw attention from the Lebanese and
Arab press.
</P>
<P>
According to the proposal, the withdrawal would start only
after Syria and Lebanon promised to disarm guerrillas of the
Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, and to guarantee
the security on the Israeli border.
</P>
<P>
Lebanon and Syria have rejected the proposal, calling it an
attempt to drive a wedge between the two states.
</P>
<P>
The Beirut conservative daily An-Nahar said today that
the proposal is high on the agenda of Lebanese Prime Minister
Rafik Hariri's current visit in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
It said that Hariri will discuss the proposal in Brussels with
U.S. coordinator to the Middle East peace talks Dennis Ross, who
held talks with Syrian and Israeli leaders during a Middle
East tour last week.

<HEADLINE> UN Calls for Respecting Buffer Zone in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A U.N. official today urged all on
this divided Eastern Mediterranean island to respect the buffer
zone and warned against unforeseeable consequences.
</P>
<P>
Gustave Feissel, U.N. Secretary-General's resident
representative in Cyprus, made the call following a report that
some 7,000 Cypriot and European motorcyclists will start Friday a
10-day ride from Berlin to the Turkish-controlled northern
coastal town of Kyrenia.
</P>
<P>
After a 40-minute meeting today with Cyprus' President Glafcos
Clerides, Feissel said that everybody has to respect the buffer
zone under the arrangement which gives U.N. Peace-Keeping Force
in Cyprus (UNFICYP) temporary responsibility for the area.
</P>
<P>
"It is absolutely vital that everybody throughout the island
respects this fact and plays the game according to the
rules. Because if people start disregarding the rules of the game
this could have consequences that we may not be able to foresee,"
he noted.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. envoy said he was satisfied with the assurances given
by President Clerides to secure respect of the buffer zone. "I do
not know what the measures are but I am certainly satisfied with
what I heard," he said.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, President of the Cyprus Motorcycle Federation
George Hadjicostas announced at a press conference that around
7,000 motorcyclists will attempt to ride from Berlin to the
Turkish-controlled northern coastal town of Kyrenia.
</P>
<P>
A total of 120 motorcyclists will start riding from Berlin on
August 2 and arrive in Cyprus on August 10.
</P>
<P>
Another 7,000 Cypriot motorcyclists will join them in an
attempt to cross, through Ledra Palace Check Point in Nicosia, to
the northern part of the island, and then to ride to coastal town
of Kyrenia.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash has warned that those
who enter the Turkish-controlled northern areas of the island will be
severely punished and their motorbikes be confiscated.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
seized the northern third of the island following a short-lived
coup, engineered by the then Greek Junta against late President
Archbishop Makarios.
</P>
<P>
The 1,200-strong U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus (UNFICYP)
has been patrolling along the 180-kilometer-long buffer zone,
which separates the island into two parts.

<HEADLINE> 1,590 Kilograms of Narcotics Seized in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 1,590 kilograms of
narcotics were seized in Iran's northeast province of Khorasan
which borders Afghanistan, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA reported that one smuggler was
killed and seven gangsters were arrested in two operations in the
past 10 days.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the gangsters were engaged in
transferring the narcotics into the country via Taibad and
Sarakhs border points for distribution in the northern cities
of Mashhad and Tehran.
</P>
<P>
In the operations, three rifles, 11 vehicles and 264 rounds
of ammunition were seized and 49 smugglers arrested, the report
added.
</P>
<P>
Iran confiscated 170 tons of narcotics in the last Iranian
calendar year ending on March 19.
</P>
<P>
Drug trafficking is one of the main social problems of the
country since it is one of the best transit to Europe and
is close to the "Golden Crescent" in the border area between
Afghanistan and Pakistan, one of the biggest drug-producing
centers in the world.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989, which empowered
the Iranian authorities to execute the smugglers who were caught
with more than 30 grams of heroine or five kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
According to an early report, Iran executed over 4,000 drug
traffickers since 1988 and there are over 12,500 foreign
smugglers in the Iranian jails.

WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States and Saudi
Arabia have agreed to move some 4,000 U.S. troops stationed in the
kingdom to a remote air base, Pentagon officials said today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached when U.S. Defense Secretary William
Perry was paying a visit to the kingdom and held talks with his
Saudi counterpart, Prince Sultan, they said.
</P>

The movement of the troops to Al Khari air base, 55 miles
southeast of Riyadh, will be carried out as quickly as possible
and completed on an urgent basis without interrupting ongoing
operations, said a statement issued after the talks between the

International.
</P>
<P>
The plan to move the U.S. troops in the kingdom was made right
after the truck bombing in Dhahran on June 25 which killed 19
American soldiers.

<HEADLINE> EU Envoy: Greek, Turkish Cypriot Sides Willing to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- An European Union (EU) envoy
said here today that he believes the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
sides are determined to address the Cyprus problem and, if
possible, solve it to enable a united Cyprus to begin EU
accession negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Kester Heaslip, EU's Irish presidency representative for Cyprus,
made the remarks after a meeting in Nicosia with the
representatives of EU member states in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Heaslip, who arrived here Sunday to listen to the views
of the parties involved in the Cyprus problem, had separate
meetings with President Glafcos Clerides and Turkish Cypriot
leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
The Irish envoy said he briefed his colleagues on his
meetings with the Cyprus government and Turkish Cypriot leader
Denktash.
</P>
<P>
He described his mission to Nicosia, Athens and Ankara as
"fact finding" and said he is gathering information, suggestions
and advice the Irish EU presidency would benefit from when
dealing with the Cyprus question during its six month tenure of
rotating chairmanship.
</P>
<P>
Asked if he believed the Cyprus problem would be solved
before the island joins the EU, Heaslip said he "is convinced
that on both sides there is determination to address the
problem and, if possible, to solve it".
</P>
<P>
He also said during his talks with the Turkish Cypriot
leader, he "urged him and his colleagues to lose no opportunity
to acquaint themselves with the policies of the EU and to
acquaint themselves ever more closely with the practical
advantages, as well as the more general benefits that membership
would bring to a united Cyprus".
</P>
<P>
Heaslip said the Turkish Cypriot leader is interested in the
benefits that membership of the EU would bring to his community
and indeed to all of Cyprus people and listened "with great
interest."
</P>
<P>
The Irish envoy will leave Thursday for Ankara via Athens to
meet Turkey's Foreign Minister Tansu Ciller to discuss the Cyprus
problem.

<HEADLINE> Radioactive Leak Occurs in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Iranian authorities denied here
today that 50 people were affected by a radioactive leak
in a cycle power plant, 325 kilometers north of Tehran.
</P>
<P>
The Atomic Energy Organization of Iran (AEOI) said that
only one worker was exposed to radiation as result of
negligence to safety rules.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Siemens Company of Germany has issued a
statement saying that none of its personnel at the site was
affected by the accident.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA reported that the radioactive
accident occurred as a radioactive source used for industrial
radiology was left unattended for some two hours at the
combined cycle power plant in Gilan province on July 24.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a worker on the site received level
2 (IAEA scale) radiation dose and now is under full medical
care.
</P>
<P>
AEOI said that safety personnel, on learning of the accident,
placed the radioactive source back in its shield, and that
all safety and radiation protection measures have been taken by
AEOI inspectors.
</P>
<P>
"The result of the blood tests and clinical examination of
all concerned workers and technical staff at the site are
normal, hence no one has been exposed to radiation, except the
above mentioned worker," AEOI said in the statement.

<HEADLINE> UK helps New Biotechnology Companies Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Support for specialist business
mentoring services and incubator units to help young biotechnology
companies grow will be available under a new Biotechnology Means
Business (BMB) Challenge launched here today.
</P>
<P>
The BMB Mentoring and Incubator Challenge aims to encourage
intermediaries to provide targeted support services to embryonic
and new start-ups, and to stimulate the creation and growth of
biotechnology companies.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the launch of the challenge, Richard Page, minister
for biotechnology of the Department of Trade and Industry, said
that this new challenge would help the growth of a stronger
biotechnology sector in Britain. He was determined that Britain
would continue to lead the way in Europe rather than just "nipping
at the heels of our American cousins."
</P>
<P>
Up to 5 million pounds (7.5 million US dollars) will be
available under the three-year challenge, with maximum grants of
500,000 pounds (750,000 dollars) being awarded to successful
organizations providing innovative coaching services, specialist
facilities and laboratory units.
</P>
<P>
Intermediaries would be encouraged to provide targeted services
such as financial, commercial, technical management advice and
ongoing support. This could involve the mentoring service taking a
stake in the business instead of fees to ensure the success of the
new venture, Page said.
</P>
<P>
The challenge would help provide a mechanism for getting that
science and turning it into more dynamic companies as quickly as
possible, the minister added.
</P>
<P>
According to the challenge, winners will be selected from two
categories. Grants of up to 50 percent (up to a maximum 750,000
dollars) will be awarded to successful projects providing business
mentoring and incubators.
</P>
<P>
In addition funding of up to 30,000 US dollars will be
available for the development phase of projects, to assess the
market need for a particular incubator and to develop a detailed
business plan.

<HEADLINE> Islamic States Reaffirm Support for Sarajevo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of the Islamic
Conference (OIC) reaffirmed here today its support to the Bosnian
government in establishing the Federation troops and economic
reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
It reaffirmed that it would assist Sarajevo "particularly in
the establishment of the Army of Federation..., including through
the Train and Equip program, its defense capabilities aimed at
establishing a military balance and to ensure deterrence against
any possible future aggression."
</P>
<P>
The reaffirmation was contained in a statement issued after the
one-day ministerial meeting of the OIC Contact Group on Bosnia and
Herzegovina in Geneva. Its last meeting was convened on April 10
in Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
It was an urgence to arm and equip the Federation army after
the signing in June of the arms reduction agreement in Florence,
said OIC Secretary-General Hamid Algabid at a news conference
following the meeting.
</P>
<P>
He added that it was very important to strengthen Bosnian armed
forces within the Dayton peace agreement framework, especially
when the multinational troops would leave Bosnia-Herzegovina at
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
According to Bosnian Prime Minister Hasan Muratovic at the news
conference, within the first two years, the Federation army would
need 20 million U.S. dollars per month.
</P>
<P>
Participants of the meeting also decided to support the
establishment of the Revolving Fund for economic reconstruction in
Bosnia, particularly for small and medium-sized enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were representatives from Iran, Turkey,
Egypt, Morocco, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Pakistan, Bangladesh,
Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, Guinea, Senegal and Indonesia as observer.
</P>
<P>
They also urged in the statement efforts, especially from the
Organization of Security and Cooperation in Europe, to create
conditions to ensure free, fair and democratic elections in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, which is scheduled for September.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic countries meanwhile called for international
efforts to deliver former Serb leaders including Karadzic and
Mladic to the war tribunal and remove them from political life.
</P>
<P>
In addition, participants of the meeting expressed concern over
the situation in Mostar and urged the dismantling before elections
of the self-proclaimed "Herceg-Bosna" -- an entity declared by
Croatians of Bosnia, saying this would affect the relations
between them.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Muratovic said the existence of "Herceg-Bosna"
was obstructing the implementation of the Dayton agreement.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Music Corporation of America
(MCA) has announced that it was selling the rights of television
shows and movies valued at about 2.5 billion U.S. dollars to
German companies.
</P>
<P>
Under a long-term, 1.5 billion dollar contract, MCA sold to
RTL, Germany's largest television network in terms of viewers, the
broadcast rights to shows and Universal Pictures films, the New
York Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
In another deal, for 1 billion dollars, MCA sold various pay-TV
rights for 10 years to the Kirch Group, one of Germany's leading
production, broadcasting and distribution companies, the report
said.
</P>
<P>
The RTL deal also involves a co-production agreement that would
split the cost of producing as many as 25 television series in the
next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
The deals were part of a strategy by the U.S. company to expand
television operations aggressively overseas, MCA chairman Frank
Biondi Jr. said.
</P>
<P>
As the largest market in Europe, Germany is seen by American
entertainment companies as a gateway for American entertainment
properties in Europe and other regions.
</P>
<P>
"Germany is the most desirable springboard for launching
additional channels throughout Western Europe and other markets,
serving as an effective blueprint for the future," Biondi said.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Condemns Japanese PM's Visit to Yasukuni Shrine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, July 30 (Xinhua) -- The visit by Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto to Yasukuni Shrine on Monday is an
intolerable insult to the peoples of the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) and other Asian countries, said the Korea
Central News Agency (KCNA) in an commentary today.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto's claim that he went to the place which enshrines
many World War II criminals in his private capacity cannot
disguise the insidious attempt of the Japanese reactionaries to
revive militarism and to realize the ambition of re-invasion, the
commentary pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto, the first serving prime minister to pay homage to
the controversial shrine since 1985, had paid regular visits to
the Tokyo-based Shinto religious place before, the latest being on
August 15 last year in the capacity of international trade and
industry minister.
</P>
<P>
KCNA warned that the peoples of DPRK and other Asian nations
are closely watching the movement of the Japanese aggressive
forces, who want to revive the old dream of establishing a "Great
East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere."
</P>
<P>
In conclusion, the commentary warned that the Japanese
authorities should have a clear understanding of the overall
situation and refrain from acting recklessly.

<HEADLINE> France's Unemployment Rises Again in June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The number of jobless in France rose
by 22,800 in June, which registered a 0.7 percent increase over
the previous month and a 4.6 percent rise over the same period
last year.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics published today by the French Ministry
of Labor, the total number of jobless in France now stands at
3,065,600, or 12.5 percent of the working age population of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Le Monde said in a report for its Thursday edition that the
rise of unemployment in June was partly attributed to the season,
when a large number of youths graduating from school in summer
entered the job market.
</P>
<P>
Another reason is that the economic climate in France remains
bad, with a near-zero growth or even below-zero growth in the
April-May-June period of 1996, said the local daily.
</P>
<P>
Agence France Presse said that the rise of unemployment in June
has given ground for speculation of an even darker employment
situation, with "rigidity in budget policy and decline in social
plans risking to push down a revival."
</P>
<P>
"For the year, the forecasts of specialists are not in the
least encouraging. The National Institution of Statistics and
Economics Study expects a 12.3-12.5 percent unemployment rate,
while the French Observatory of Economic Circumstances expects an
unemployed population of 140,000 by the end of the year and
120,000 in the following year," said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Minister of Labor, Employment and Social Affairs
Jacques Barrot said today that the government will subsidize 15-20
billion francs (3-4 billion U.S. dollars) in 1997 to finance
employment programs.
</P>
<P>
The opposition Socialist Party said the rise of unemployment
underlines the failure of government policy.
</P>
<P>
"Far from taking the seriousness of the employment situation
into its conscience, the government is taking measures which will
accentuate the tendency towards the rising of unemployment," said
Socialist Party spokesman Francois Hollande.
</P>
<P>
He listed as examples of government errors reduction of
allocations for the new school year, lay-offs in public sectors
and reduction of social plans in the defense industry.
</P>
<P>
The Group of Applied Macro-Economic Analysis (GAMA) said today
that the French economy will have a growth of 1.4-1.5 percent in
the whole year of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Although the economic growth dropped by 0.3 percent in the
April-May-June period, it will grow by 0.9 percent and 1 percent
in the next two quarters of the year, said GAMA.

<HEADLINE> China, Indonesia Split Doubles Titles in Badminton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Badminton powerhouse China took
the first Olympic badminton gold through world top pair Ge Fei/Gu
Jun in the women's doubles final here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese defeated reigning world champions Gil Young Ah/Jang
Hye Ock of South Korea with an identical score of 11-5 for the top
honour.
</P>
<P>
In the Barcelona Games, China bagged home only one silver, four
bronze medals from the badminton tournaments.
</P>
<P>
Powerhouse Indonesia got its first gold medal from the Atlanta
Games as world number one men's doubles Rexy Mainaky and Ricky
Subagja came from one game behind to oust their old-rivals Cheah
Soon Kit and Yap Kim Hock of Malaysia 5-15, 15-13 and 15-12 in a
100-minute tussle.
</P>
<P>
"My task is to win the gold with no other thoughts," said Rexy.
</P>
<P>
After conceding the first game, the Indonesians, who won the
All-England Championships and Japan Open this year, started to
pace up with their powerful shots and sound defence with swift
moves in the next two games wherein the Indonesians once led 7-1
in the second game.
</P>
<P>
The see-saw match finally ushered in the winners of the
Indonesians with more stamina, while the Malaysians, winners of
the World Grand Prix Finals last season, had to settle for the
silver, also the first medal won by them in the Games.
</P>
<P>
In the women's edition, second seeds Ge Fei and Gu Jun, lost
finalists in the Japan Open of the year, dominated the match with
speedy attacks and blocks.
</P>
<P>
The Koreans only showed their prowess once when they rallied to
4-all with four straight points in a row in the second game,
however the competition was lop-sided enough even to the shock of
Chinese coach Tian Bingyi.
</P>
<P>
"I did not expect it to end in such a comfortable manner," said
Tian who paired with Li Yongbo to win the world men's doubles
titles twice in the 80's.
</P>
<P>
"This is really a match full of pressure, we are very pround of
winning the first badminton gold for our country, " said Ge Fei
who have paired with Gu Jun for more than ten years and enjoyed a
7-5 slate against the Koreans.
</P>
<P>
The Koreans, winners at the ninth world championships in
Laussane last year, said that their tough semi-final against
another Chinese pairs Qing Yi Yuan/Tang Yong Shu had exploited
their stamina in the finals.
</P>
<P>
However, "our opponents played better than we did," the Koreans
confessed.
</P>
<P>
The other three finals will start on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The sport of badminton made its debut at the Barcelona Games
four years ago wherein the Indonesians chalked up both men's and
women's singles crowns, the only gold medals won by the country in
the Olympic Games.

in an all-Chinese final on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The top-ranked player, who was upset by South Korean Kim

<HEADLINE> Japan Adopts Measures to Control Food Poisoning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Japanese government today
adopted a package of measures to combat the spreading of food
poisoning caused by the O-157 strain of E. coli bacteria, Chief
Cabinet Secretary Seiroku Kajiyama said.
</P>
<P>
The package includes working out a manual by the weekend on
medical treatment of the epidemic, studying whether to make it a
legally designated infectious disease and stepping up sanitary and
medical treatment methods, Kajiyama said at a press conference.
</P>
<P>
He said that the cabinet also decided to distribute to every
household with newspapers 40 million flyers containing information
on how to avoid food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
The epidemic has spread throughout Japan this year, causing
seven deaths and sickening some 8,700 people, mostly
schoolchildren in the western city of Sakai.
</P>
<P>
The Kyodo News Service reported today that the Health and
Welfare Ministry planned to invoke a powerful law as early as next
week, aiming to prevent the spread of the O-157 epidemic.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo said that it would be the first time in 20 years for the
dangerous infectious classification to be applied to an epidemic
under the 1897 Communicable Diseases Prevention Law, which allowed
health authorities to take legal steps -- the isolation of
patients, traffic blockades and regulations on patients' work --
to fight an infectious disease.

</P>
<P>
According to the press service, the issue was discussed in

confidence" to proposals by the head of administration which, as

</P>
<P>
Speaking at a news conference in the Kremlin, Chubais named
Uneximbank Chairman Vladimir Potanin, presidential economic
adviser Alexander Livshits, First Deputy Duma (lower house of

<HEADLINE> Chirac Reaffirms Support for "Land for Peace" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
today reaffirmed France's support for the "land for peace"
principle to be observed in the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
In his talks with Syrian Vice-president Abdel Halim Khaddam in
the Elysee Palace, Chirac said that the peace process should be
carried on on the basis of the agreements signed between Israel
and Arab countries in Madrid, Oslo, and Taba, and especially on
the principle of exchange of land for peace, according to
presidential spokeswoman Catherine Colonna.
</P>
<P>
The president also confirmed that he would pay a visit to Syria
in autumn, and in October the earliest, said Colonna.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam handed over to Chirac a letter from Syrian President
Hafez Al-Assad on the latter's stand on the peace process, but the
content of the letter was not revealed.
</P>
<P>
Khaddam said after the one-hour-and-a-quarter meeting that
Syria wants France to play an active role in the Mideast peace
process because of its very close relations with the Arab world in
history, as well as the mutual, common interests between France
and the Arab world.
</P>
<P>
He also reaffirmed Syria's opposition to the Israeli proposal
that the peace process be relaunched from Lebanon first through
the withdrawal of Israeli troops from south Lebanon in exchange
for the disarmament of the Hezbollah guerrillas fighting Israeli
troops.
</P>
<P>
Syria has described the proposal as "a deadly snare aimed at
destroying Lebanon."
</P>
<P>
Asked when the peace talks between Israel and Syria could
resume, Khaddam said that the talks will not be resumed until
Israel agrees to accept the "basics of peace" insisted on by
Damascus -- U.N. resolutions calling for the withdrawal of Israeli
troops from Arab land, and the realization of the withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also talked about Syria's debt to France which
is estimated at 1 billion francs (20 million U.S. dollars). "The
negotiations (on the debt) will continue and we wish to find a
solution," said Colonna.

and goods.

<HEADLINE> NATO Bosnia Operation Chief Smith Replaced by Lopez </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Adm. T Joseph Lopez today
took over the dual mantle of chief of NATO's southern European
forces and the U.S. Navy in Europe, the Pentagon said.
</P>
<P>
As the chief of NATO's southern European forces, Lopez also
replaced Leighton W. Smith to become the commander of the 60,000
U.S.-led NATO peace implementation troops in the former Yugoslav
republic of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
At a ceremony at the NATO base in Naples, Italy, Smith who
planned and executed the NATO peacekeeping mission in Bosnia was
praised for helping peace in the nation.
</P>
<P>
The NATO force has been successful in separating warring
Bosnian Serbs and the Muslim-Croat alliance. It also has opened
roads, bridges and allowed more freedom of movement of the three
warring ethnics.
</P>
<P>
But Smith has been criticized for doing little to capture
former Bosnian leaders Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, both
indicted by the U.N. war crimes tribunal at The Hague.
</P>
<P>
Smith, who supervised the bombing of Bosnian Serb targets in
August and September in 1995, will retire after several months at
the Pentagon, Pentagon officials said.
</P>
<P>
Lopez, 56, was once a senior military aid to former U.S.
Defense Secretary Dick Cheney. He also served as deputy Navy
operations chief for resources, warfare requirements and
assessments.
</P>
<P>
NATO officials said that Lopez's first task will be to oversee
the massive NATO support program for country-wide general
elections in Bosnia scheduled for September 14.

<HEADLINE> Ill-Fated TWA Jet's Landing Gear Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Federal investigators said in
Smithtown, Long Island of New York, on Tuesday that the front
landing gear of the Boeing 747 crashed off Long Island shows
that the plane was destroyed by a bomb.
</P>
<P>
Describing the finding as the strongest evidence that the plane
was brought down by a terrorist act, investigators believed that a
bomb might have been in a passenger's bag, or in a food chart or a
bathroom in the cabin above.
</P>
<P>
The front landing gear was recovered by the divers, Navy and
Coast Guard technicians and Federal agents on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
New York Times today quoted a Federal investigator as saying
that the landing gear would have been retracted into its housing
inside the fuselage long before the plane exploded, and the
hydraulic mechanism that retracts it was found to have "serious
concussive damage". "By the way it had been smashed, the bomb
experts thought that it had been very close to the source of the
explosion," he added.
</P>
<P>
Samples of apparent residue found on the landing gear had been
sent to the Federal Bureau of Investigation laboratory in
Washington to find if they hold chemical traces of an explosive,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The Paris-bound plane of the American Trans-World Airlines, or
TWA, exploded and crashed into the waters off Long Island, New
York, on night of July 17 just after taking off from the Kennedy
International Airport, New York. All 230 passengers and crew
members on board were killed.
</P>
<P>
Over the past two weeks, salvage work has been going on. So
far, 171 bodies have been recovered, and 165 have been identified.
But Searchers failed to recover the major wreckage of the doomed
plane.

<HEADLINE> Arabs Formulate Draft Strategy to Combat Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Arab security officials drew up a
draft strategy here today to strengthen cooperation among Arab
states in combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The draft strategy, which is aimed at realizing maximum
cooperation at the Arab and international levels to contain
terrorism, was drawn up after three days of meetings attended by
representatives from 15 Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed on a definition of terrorism, namely,
terrorist acts are acts of organized violence which cause panic
and terror. But they believe that terrorism should be completely
separated from "armed struggle by occupied people to free their
occupied lands."
</P>
<P>
The draft strategy calls on Arab states to take effective and
firm measures to combat terrorism in all its shapes and forms by
desisting from making their land a base for planning, organizing
or carrying out terrorist activities.
</P>
<P>
Under the strategy, cooperation should be strengthened among
Arab states to fight terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The draft will be referred to a meeting of Arab interior
ministers in January for approval.

<HEADLINE> Boeing to Buy Rockwell Aerospace, Defense Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) --- The Boeing Co. announced
today it is buying the Rockwell International Corp.'s space and
defense units for some 3.2 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Seattle-based Boeing, the world's biggest commercial airplane
producer, will become the world's dominant aerospace company after
the completion of the deal with Rockwell, which built the U.S.
space shuttles and played a major role in the Apollo moon
missions.
</P>
<P>
The two giants said in a joint statement that under the deal,
Boeing will issue some 860 million dollars of its common stock and
retain 2.165 billion dollars of Rockwell debt and assume certain
pension obligations of Rockwell.
</P>
<P>
Among the major enterprises that Boeing is acquiring are
Rockwell units that produce intercontinental and tactical
missiles, bombers, and rocket propulsion systems, including the
space shuttle main engines.
</P>
<P>
The Rockwell, with a work force of about 21,000, had sales of
3.2 billion dollars last year while Boeing's defense and aerospace
units have sales of 5.6 billion dollars and about 30,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
The new name of the acquired units will be Boeing North
American Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of Boeing.
</P>
<P>
Rockwell, which is based in Downey, California, said it is
exiting the aerospace business to concentrate on its electronics

<HEADLINE> PLA Leader: Follow Party's Absolute Leadership (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- As China's three-million strong
People's Liberation Army celebrated its 69th founding anniversary
today, a senior military leader stressed the importance of
guaranteeing the Party's absolute leadership over the armed forces.
</P>
<P>
The key tasks of the PLA were spelled out in an article carried
in the latest issue of "Qiushi" (seeking truth) magazine, which is
written by Vice-Chairman of the Central Military Commission Zhang
Wannian.
</P>
<P>
"A fundamental experience we have gained in the past 69 years
is to enhance the army's ideological and political work, and to
guarantee the Party's absolute leadership over the army," the
article says.
</P>
<P>
That is the soul of the fine styles the army has developed over
a long period of revolutionary struggle, reflecting the essence of
the people's army, Zhang said in the article.
</P>
<P>
To strengthen the building of ideology and political work in
the army, and to adhere to the Party's absolute leadership over
the army, has been a consistent theory put forward by the three
generations of leadership represented by Mao Zedong, Deng Xiaoping
and Jiang Zemin, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The article also referred to lessons learned in the different
historical periods, noting that facts show that without the
absolute leadership of the Party, the army would have no clear
aims, no correct political orientations and no strong unity.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> PLA Leader: Follow Party's Absolute Leadership (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As China needs a stable environment to deepen the reforms,
expand opening-up and promote economic development, the article
says, the army shoulders the duty of safeguarding national
security and social stability.
</P>
<P>
"Only by following the absolute leadership of the Party can the
army correctly handle the relations between military and economic
construction," it says.
</P>
<P>
The article says that to educate the officers and soldiers with
the Party's basic lines and policies, as well as Marxism,
Leninism, and Mao Zedong thoughts, remains a major task of the
PLA's political work.
</P>
<P>
The central task in this regard at present is to arm the
officers and men with Deng Xiaoping's theory of building socialism
with Chinese characteristics, so that the army will safeguard the
Party's policies for modernizations conscientiously, it says.
</P>
<P>
The article warns that along with the development of reform and
opening-up, decadent capitalist and feudal ideas might find their
way into the army, and therefore, it represents an important task
to carry out the "four-point education" put forward by Chairman
Jiang Zemin: education on patriotism and devotion, on mutual
respect between officers and men soldiers, on revolutionary
outlook of life, and on hard struggle and plain living.
</P>
<P>
Also, it is necessary to strengthen the building of leading
bodies at all levels, the article says, calling this a fundamental
guarantee for ensuring the Party's absolute leadership and
maintaining a correct path of army building.
</P>
<P>
It conforms with the nation's supreme interests to firmly
safeguard the authority of the third generation of leadership with
Jiang Zemin as the core and to unconditionally stay in keeping
with the Party Central Committee, the article says.
</P>
<P>
The article pledges that the army will, as always,
unconditionally follow the orders of the Party Central Committee
and Central Military Commission to the letter.
</P>
<P>
The article also stressed the importance of sticking to the
principle of building up a contingent of cadres who are
politically reliable, younger, better educated and professionally
competent.
</P>
<P>
The magazine "Seeking Truth" is a fortnightly theoretical
journal of the CPC Central Committee, published by the Central

<HEADLINE> A.A. Plane Makes Emergency Landing After Engine </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- An American Airlines' flight
from Chicago to New York made an emergency landing at Harrisburg,
Pennsylvania, Wednesday night after one of the two engines failed
and thick, black smoke filled the cabin.
</P>
<P>
The plane, a Super 80 twin engine, began experiencing trouble
after taking off from O'Hare International Airport at 6:59 p.m.
(2359 GMT), an airline official was quoted by the Associated
Press as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The captain declared an emergency and landed the plane at the
Harrisburg International Airport 20 minutes after smoke filled the
cabin and some smoke entered the cockpit.
</P>
<P>
None of the 139 passengers or crew aboard Flight 354 were
injured. Airline officials are investigating what caused the
engine to shut down.
</P>
<P>
Also Wednesday, a Venezuelan passenger jet was evacuated and
searched moments after landing at the Miami International Airport
as the airport received a bomb threat when the plane was in the
air.
</P>
<P>
Zuliana Airlines Flight 203, carrying 86 passengers, landed
safely at the airport and was taken to an isolated area where
passengers were quickly evacuated. Then Miami police with
explosives-sniffing dogs began to search the DC-9, local media
reports said.
</P>
<P>
The investigators did not find anything of bomb.
</P>
<P>
It was the second bomb threat against an airliner in two days
in the United States in the wake of a bomb blast in Atlanta
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Tuesday night, USAir Flight 894, with 200 passengers and crew
members aboard, had to return to the airport in Philadelphia
minutes after takeoff following a bomb threat. Investigators had
not found any bomb on the Boeing 767.

<HEADLINE> Bank of France Lowers Key Interest Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of France today lowered
one of its directive rates -- the borrowing rate for 5-10 days --
by 0.15 percentage point to 4.57 percent, but maintains other
directive rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The borrowing rate for 5-10 days was last lowered on April 25
by 0.60 percentage point to 4.90 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank reduced its key directive rate -- the tenders rate on
July 4 last year by 0.05 point to 3.55 percent.
</P>
<P>
The bank's policy making board -- the Council of Monetary
Policy made the decision at today's session, the last before the
summer vacation, after the German Bundesbank decided to maintain
all its rates unchanged last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The French franc neared the floor of one mark against 3.39
francs at today's financial market, making the central bank
impossible to lower its tenders rate, the key rate for financing
banks and the economy.
</P>
<P>
The lowering of the borrowing rate for 5-10 days, which caters
for emergency cases, is above all a gesture by the central bank of
continuing monetary detente at the wake of another rise of
unemployment in June in the country, said Agence France Presse.
</P>
<P>
The stock exchange in Paris was not affected by the
announcement, with the CAC 40 index gaining 0.12 percent to
1,998.33 points.
</P>
<P>
The French franc stabilizes at one mark against 3.3950 francs
after the announcement.

ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Bang Soo-Hyan of South Korea beat
Mia Audina of Indonesia to win the women's singles gold medal here
today in the Olympic badminton final.
</P>
<P>
Bang, silver medallist in Barcelona, defeated 16-year-old
Audina in straight games of 11-6, 11-7.
</P>
<P>
With Bang's victory, badminton-mad Indonesians, who won both
singles in Barcelona, went to home without any gold medals in
Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
Bang, world number two, proved too powerful for her
inexperienced opponent, who is ranked 11th in the world and is the
youngest badminton competitor at the Games.
</P>
<P>
The first game was even to 6-6, but Audina then made a series
of unforced errors which allowed Bang to take a 10-6 lead.
</P>
<P>
The Indonesian saved three game points but was beaten on the
fourth after Bang won back serve with a shot controversially
called in.
</P>
<P>
The second game was almost identical, Audina playing some
superb shots and taking the game to 7-7 but then appearing to lose
heart.

<HEADLINE> Competition Becoming Tough In China's Insurance Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China's first reinsurance company
was inaugurated at a ceremony in Beijing today, with predictions
that its income this year will be around 10 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The newly launched PICC Reinsurance Company is one of the three
subsidiaries of the People's Insurance (Group) Company of China,
created when China's biggest insurer underwent a major shake-up.
</P>
<P>
The PICC Reinsurance used to be the reinsurance division of the
People's Insurance Company of China, who ever played a dominant
role in the country's reinsurance business.
</P>
<P>
China previously had no such insurance company specializing in
reinsurance. So the inauguration of PICC Reinsurance is considered
as a good start for China's insurance industry in its move towards
commercialization.
</P>
<P>
China will have five new insurance companies put into operation
this year. And the People's Bank of China, the central bank, will
say "Yes" to some of those who have applied to open insurance
business.
</P>
<P>
Local insurance industry observers said that insurers in China
will see tough competition in the coming years, with more home and
abroad insurance companies elbowing into the market.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Economy Grows Strongly in Second Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. economy grew at a
strong 4.2 percent annual rate in the second quarter of this year,
the fastest pace in two years, U.S. Commerce Department reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The increase is more than a double that of the first three
months and the best showing since the nation's economy surged by
4.9 percent during the second quarter of 1994.
</P>
<P>
The total gross domestic products (GDP) in the second quarter
was at annual rate of 6.885 trillion dollars after adjusting for
inflation, compared with 6.814 trillion dollars in the previous
three months.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. Commerce Department also released the revisions of
economic increase rates since 1993. Among them, the expansion of
GDP in the first three months of this year was revised down to 2
percent from a previous estimate of 2.2 percent. And that in last
quarter of 1995 was revised to 0.3 percent from 0.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
The GDP report showed the consumers' spending, about two-thirds
of the nation's economic activity, increased by a 3.7 percent
annual rate in the second quarter, even more than the 3.5 percent
gain in the first three months.
</P>
<P>
Housing activity shot up at a 15.2 percent rate, more than
double the 7.4 percent from January through March.
</P>
<P>
Inventory rebuilding added 13.3 billion dollars to the GDP
after subtracting 17.6 billion in the first quarter, when many
businesses were paring overstocked goods from their shelves.
</P>
<P>
But business investment went up by a small 0.5 percent from
April to June after it surged by 11.6 percent in the first three
months.
</P>
<P>
And the nation's trade performance continued to curb growth.
Although exports grew at a 5.2 percent annual rate, the imports
boosted by 12.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, there was little sign of any inflationary burst in
today's report. A price index tied to the GDP rose just 2
percent, slower than the 2.3 percent advance in the first quarter
when energy costs accelerated.
</P>
<P>
The new report was welcome news at the White House, which hopes
the economy will remain strong during this election year.
</P>
<P>
But many analysts believe the economy will slow during the
second half of 1996. Already there are signs of moderation,
including slack factory orders and retail sales.

ATLANTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian women sprinter Marina
Trandenkova has failed her doping tests and been disqualified from
the Atlanta Games, International Olympic Committee (IOC)
spokeswoman Michele Verdier said on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The IOC medical commission recommanded the disqualification of
the Russian athlete, which was unanimously approved by the IOC
executive committee," said Verdier.
</P>
<P>
Trandenkova, who placed fifth in the women's 100 meters final
last Saturday, became the fourth Russian to test positive for
drugs, all for bromantan, a stimulant-cum-masking agent.
</P>
<P>
Early, two Russian swimmers and one Greco-Roman wrestler in the
48-kilogram class tested positive and Russia was stripped of two
bronze medals in return.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Maria Macmahon of Ireland, was reprimanded for
tested positive of phenilpropenopamine, a drug contained in the
tablet of a painkiller.
</P>
<P>
The IOC medical commission accepted that Macmahon's claim that
she had taken a medicine which contained an analgesic for cold
symptoms.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese province has urged its
people to leave crucial farmland to the living rather than the
dead.
</P>
<P>
Industrial Liaoning Province, northeast China, has removed
60,000 tombs from farmland in the past few months.
</P>
<P>
Although cremation is popular in China, burying dead loved ones
in tombs is on a steady increase in some parts of the
country. Even when the deceased are cremated many relatives bury
their ashes and build tombs, occupying huge amounts of farmland.
</P>
<P>
A retired official has written three letters to the provincial
governor Wen Shizhen, urging him to issue orders to stop the
practice of building tombs at the expense of farmland.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has called on the people to transform
the outmoded habit and custom so that Liaoning can leave more
farmland to the coming generations.

<HEADLINE> Nepali MP Raises Concern on Border Issue with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 1 (Xinhua) -- An opposition lawmaker in Nepal
today raised concern over a newly erected border pillar between
Nepal and India, which is suspected to be located inside the
Nepali territory, and demanded the government to show sensitivity
on the controversial issue.
</P>
<P>
MP Pushpa Raj Pokhrel, of the main opposition Communist Party
of Nepal (UML), told the lower house that the new pillar was
constructed last month inside the Nepali territory nearly one
kilometer away from the original one.
</P>
<P>
Pokhrel, who represents the southern border district of Jhapa
in the house, warned that the government's failure to issue an
official statement on the issue might lead to potential border
clashes.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the government promised to investigate into the
controversy that has drawn angry voices from the public in the
border area.
</P>
<P>
Local reports said the new border pillar was erected after
border officers of the Jhapa district and the neighboring Indian
district of Kisangunj reached an agreement early last month.
</P>
<P>
However, according to the Nepali Home Ministry, the government
has not received the text of the border agreement signed by
district-level officers.
</P>
<P>
The UML MP charged that the new border pillar places some parts
of Bhadrapur, the Nepali border town, on the Indian side, which
caused great inconvenience to the life of the local people.
</P>
<P>
The official RSS news agency reported that the Bhadrapur
municipality Wednesday issued a white paper urging the government
to seek a just solution to the Nepal-India border dispute through
high-level talks.

NANNING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- More than 220 firms hit by the
worst floods on record in Liuzhou City in south China's Guangxi
Zhuang Autonomous Region today received a 102.8 million yuan
pay-out in compensation from the People's Insurance (Group)
Company of China.
</P>
<P>
The flood forced more than 99 percent of enterprises in Liuzhou
to stop production, and farmers in nearby counties to quit
farming, causing massive losses for industrial and agricultural
producers.
</P>
<P>
Staff at the local PICC property insurance branch immediately
raced to the spot to measure the scale of disaster damage.
</P>
<P>
Less than two weeks later the damage assessors had completed
work on 80 percent of insurance claims generated by the flood
disaster.
</P>
<P>
Sun Xiyue, general manager of the property insurance company of
PICC, visited Liuzhou to attend the meeting for the first
compensation payments to the insured.

Compensation payments are expected to rise, with the company
saying it will meet the losses within its insurance liability.

JERUSALEM -- Amid reports of intensive diplomatic activities on
the Lebanese track of the peace process, a speculation has
surfaced here about a secret trip by Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu to Europe last weekend, reported The Jerusalem
Post today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted informed sources as saying that Netanyahu slipped out
of the country with several aides last Friday and flew to an
unrevealed destination.
</P>
<P>
Some observers speculate on his meeting in France with
President Jacques Chirac. Netanyahu's office confirmed last
Thursday that the prime minister spoke to Chirac by phone. The
two leaders had met when Netanyahu was in opposition. Netanyahu
held talks in Jerusalem with French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette on July 24.
</P>
<P>
France is believed to be a key player in Lebanon, and
Netanyahu's main diplomatic initiative is a Lebanon-first
approach, which could lead to an agreement with Syria for an
Israeli pullout from south Lebanon in return for security
arrangements.

<HEADLINE> Minister: Kuwaiti Economy Recovered from </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait's national economy
has recovered from the catastrophy of the Iraqi invasion six years
ago and was able to attract local and foreign investment, a senior
Kuwaiti official declared today.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview with the official Kuwait News Agency
(KUNA) on the eve of the sixth anniversary of the invasion,
Kuwaiti Finance Minister Nasser Abdullah al-Rowdhan said his
country has made a distinguished economic recovery that was even
better than the days before the invasion in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
Six years after the "treacherous Iraqi invasion," all economic
indications point to the fact that the local economy has restored
its noted position, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) rose eight percent in 1995 to
7952.3 million Kuwait dinars (26.6 billion U.S. dollars) from
that of 1994, marking a sharp improvement from the 1994 situation
when the growth rate was little more than one percent, according
to Central Statistics Office figures published in June.
</P>
<P>
The oil sector, which amounts to 85 percent of Kuwaiti
total revenues, recorded a 11 percent rise of export value in
1995 to 3136.8 million Kuwait dinars (10.49 billion U.S.
dollars) compared with 9.463 billion U.S. dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
The National Bank of Kuwait said in a quarterly economic
review in May that "overall the Kuwaiti economy is expected to
continue on its recent trend of gradual growth in 1996."
</P>
<P>
On the stock market front, the minister said "the volume of
the trading in the Kuwait Stock Exchange market amounted to about
7.5 billion shares valued at about 1.5 billion Kuwait dinars
(4.95 billion U.S. dollars) in the first half of this year,"
registering a record high since the liberation of the country in
February 1991.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that the privatization program the
government has been pushing forward since 1994 is on the way to a
success, adding that sales of government shares in 15 companies
amounted to 400 million Kuwait dinars (1.32 billion U.S. dollars
in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
On efforts to attract foreign investments, the minister said
certain restrictions that barred foreigners from owning companies
and shares have been removed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, higher oil prices helped cut the deficit by a
quarter to 1.092 billion Kuwait dinars (3.603 billion
U.S. dollars) in the fiscal year ending in June 1996.
</P>
<P>
The Kuwaiti government announced it is on the way to eradicate
the budget deficit at the turn of this century although many
difficulties would have to be overcome.
</P>
<P>
The government still has to pay a reconstruction cost,
including repayments of a 5.5-billion-U.S.-dollar loan it
incurred after the Iraqi invasion. So far, three instalments have
been paid while the last two instalments are due to be paied by
the end of 1996, the Central Bank said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Disarmament Ambassador on Nuclear Test Ban Treaty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China insisted today that the
issue of on-site inspection for possible violations of the
proposed nuclear test ban treaty be solved only by consensus and
necessary restrictions be imposed on the means of inspection in
order to prevent abuses.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the first plenary session of the Conference on
Disarmament resumed on July 29, Chinese disarmament ambassador Sha
Zukang proposed that the executive council of the future treaty
organization approve an on-site inspection only when 30 of its 51
members vote in favor.
</P>
<P>
The differences at the test ban talks, which formally started
in January 1994, now focus on some key issues, including the
trigger mechanism of on-site inspection (OSI) against possible
treaty violations and the terms of the treaty's entry into force.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the draft text presented by Dutch ambassador Jaap
Ramaker, who chairs the negotiations, Sha noted that the proposed
option for OSI-trigger basis and decision-making procedures only
accommodated the needs and interests of certain countries
possessing advanced verification technologies.
</P>
<P>
He said the draft text did not fully reflect or simply ignored
the reasonable suggestions and demands of many other countries
including China, neither was it an objective presentation of the
real situation of the final-stage negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"This option can hardly ensure fair on-site inspections," Sha
added. "We suggest that consultations or negotiations on this
issue be conducted immediately in an appropriate manner to seek a
consensus solution."
</P>
<P>
Sha said that approving an on-site inspection by a simple
majority of the future Executive Council was insufficient. An
on-site inspection can only be approved by a fixed 30 affirmative
votes out of all the treaty organization's 51 members, he
suggested.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese disarmament ambassador also noted that to avoid the
abuse of the on-site inspection, necessary restrictions should be
imposed on the U.S.-proposed National Technical Means (NTM).
</P>
<P>
Sha said that all members of the treaty organization should
have the knowledge of what kind of NTMs are allowed and that the
NTM information used to trigger on-site inspections must be truly
technical, verifiable and substantial.
</P>
<P>
There should be a complete ban on the use of human intelligence
and espionage, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
On July 29, the Chinese government announced a moratorium on
nuclear testing, hoping that a nuclear test ban treaty could be
concluded and become effective within this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad
affirmed that his country would adhere to the achievement of a
fair and overall peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
This came in a speech made by President al-Assad to the Syrian
Armed Forces, which was published by the Syrian newspaper
Al-Baath, mouthpiece of the ruling Baath Arab Socialist party
today.
</P>
<P>
President al-Assad said, "A fair and overall peace that will
put an end to aggression and give everyone his due is a noble
objective that Syria has honestly and sincerely sought."
</P>
<P>
Apparently expressing his hope in the peace process, the
president added, "Syria has not despaired at all, for neither a
faithful person nor a just struggle will ever get desperate. "
</P>
<P>
The Syrian president pointed out that peace should take the
course of right and justice which provides a favorable climate
for economic and social development, as well as a favorable
climate for security, and those who refuse to take this course are
enemies to peace and all noble principles and values.

COLOMBO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The government of Sri Lanka today
decided to exempt the tourist industry from business turnover tax
(BTT) on foreign exchange earnings, according to a radio report
this evening.

at Colombo's five star hotels, which face severe difficulties with
threat of retrenchments.
</P>

Sri Lanka's tourist earnings dropped to 226 million US dollars
last year from 230 million dollars in 1994. Tourist arrivals fell

<HEADLINE> City Planners In China Look Forward To Return Of Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, Augest 1 (Xinhua) -- China's "City Planning Review"
(Chinese Version) plans to publish a special issue focusing on the
achievements and prospects of city planning in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The issue will be the first in a series of activities planned
by Beijing's Chinese Society of Urban Planning (CSUP) to welcome
the return of Hong Kong to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
As China is to resume exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong
next year, there is a need for planners in Hong Kong and on the
mainland to maintain contact and cooperate with each other, in
order to better understand each other's planning methods, and to
ensure their work will dovetail after the return.
</P>
<P>
"To enhance cooperation with our Hong Kong counterparts is one
of our main goals," says Shi Nan, the deputy secretary-general of
CSUP.
</P>
<P>
"China City Planning Review" is the authoritative journal for
city planners in China. English versions that have been published
in the past several years have contributed helpful information to
planners both in China and abroad.
</P>
<P>
According to Qin Fengxia, director of the review's editorial
department, a professor from Hong Kong University has been included
on the editorial board. She added that more articles from Hong
Kong scholars will be included in the publication.
</P>
<P>
CSUP is now one of the world's largest organizations for city
planners. In order to enhance its communication with the planning
circles in other countries, SCUP recently formed a committee to
develop overseas city planning studies.

<HEADLINE> EC Approves Funding for Rehabilitation of Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The European Commission (EC)
said today it has approved the funding of a supplementary plan for
the rehabilitation of Cambodia worth 9.5 million ECUs (some 12.3
million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the EC, the executive arm of the European Union
(EU), this new plan includes three new programs designed to
complement education schemes, to satisfy new needs in the way of
capacity building and the development of human resources within
the local administration, and to provide on-the-spot monitoring
and follow-up for European Union programs.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, when the Paris peace accords were signed, the EU
has contributed to Cambodia's rehabilitation by providing
assistance for refugees and returnees and by implementing
development programs worth 161.4 million ECUs (some 210 million US
dollars) up to the end of 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- French police today arrested the
fourth suspect of a neo-Nazi group in the southern city of Avignon
for desecrating a Jewish cemetery in Carpentras five years ago,
the local media reported.
</P>
<P>
The event, which took place on May 10, 1990, shocked France and
led to a demonstration in Paris on May 14 by 200,000 people,
including the then president Francois Mitterrand.
</P>
<P>
On Wednesday, police arrested three other skinhead youths
suspected of committing the desecration. Two of them admitted the
crime.
</P>
<P>
Police said that the four men are sympathizers of the neo-Nazi
"French and European Nationalist Party" and will be brought to
court in Marseille later today.
</P>
<P>
The motive for the desecration remains obscure, said police,
quoting one of the detainees as saying that they did it to
memorize a high-ranking Nazi dignitary. The other one said they
wanted to give a blow to the Jews.

<HEADLINE> 30th IGC to Highlight Continental Geology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Continental geology will be the
main topic of discussion for the 6,000 participants of the 30th
International Geological Congress (IGC), scheduled for August 4-14
in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
The 30th IGC will focus on continental geology, with an
emphasis on the continent-related tectonics and structures, energy
and mineral resources, environmental protection, and geological
hazards reduction, and their interrelationship with continental
geology, human survival and sustainable development, said Zhang
Zhiyi, vice chairperson of the Scientific Program Committee of the
congress.
</P>
<P>
The program will highlight frontier sciences and focal points
of international geoscientific research in association with the
unique geological conditions of China and the progress made by
Chinese geologists, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
The congress will cover almost all aspects of the geosciences,
of which global tectonic zones, orogenic belts and basin analysis
are the most popular, she said.
</P>
<P>
Of common concern are sessions on types of orogenic belts,
processes, mechanics and models, and also genesis, dynamic
process, classification and evolution of sedimentary basins.
</P>
<P>
In the field of energy and mineral resources, fundamental
research projects on international geosciences are dealing with
assessment, supply/demand analysis of energy and mineral resources
for the first half of the next century, mineral deposit models,
regional metallogeny and related minerogenetic concepts, Zhang
added.
</P>
<P>
So far, the congress has received 8,092 abstracts of theses,
4,331 of which have been submitted by foreign scientists. The
organizing committee has also invited such well-known geologists
as K. Burke, P.J. Cook, Liu Dongsheng and Xiao Xuchang to give

<HEADLINE> Good Beginning for China's Rural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China's rural development in the
first half of this year has been outstanding, laying a solid
foundation for the country's Ninth Five-Year Plan (1996-2000),
"People's Daily" reported in an article published today.
</P>
<P>
The article was the first of a ten-part series on rural
economic development that included information on grain
production, investment in capital construction, reform of small
enterprises and rural industry.
</P>
<P>
In reviewing the country's rural economic development, the
article said that this year's summer grain is expected to reach
108.5 billion kg, one billion more than the record harvest in
1995.
</P>
<P>
Grain output of Jiangsu, Henan, Gansu, Shanxi and Shaanxi
provinces increased by a large margin, the article reported.
</P>
<P>
The output of pork, beef and mutton has risen to 14 million
tons, 15.9 percent over last year's figure. The number of pigs and
sows raised on China's farms has increased by 1.8 percent and 5.3
percent, respectively. Production of aquatic goods in the first
five months registered a 16.7 percent rise to climb to 7.23
million tons.
</P>
<P>
The added-value generated by rural industrial enterprises
soared to 354 billion yuan, representing a 25 percent rise. The
per capita cash income of farmers went up by 11 percent after
price hikes were deducted.
</P>
<P>
However, the article listed several hidden troubles -- serious
natural disasters, a reduction in cotton production, inefficient
operation of the rural industry and a sharp rise in the price of
materials for farming.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture called on all grain producers to
devote more efforts to autumn grain production, enhance field
management and prevent early frost, in an attempt to turn out a
good harvest for the whole year.

<HEADLINE> Reports: Syrian Envoy Secretly Visits Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A Syrian envoy paid a secret
visit to Israel last month and held talks with Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on the peace process, a local paper
reported today.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hebrew-language daily Haaretz, the visit by
the Syrian envoy, which was carried out with great secrecy, took
place just before Netanyahu left for his first official visit to
the United States on July 8.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister's office immediately denied the report this
morning.
</P>
<P>
Syria had no immediate comment on the report.
</P>
<P>
However, the report said though few details on the talks have
been revealed, one of the matters reportedly discussed at the
meeting was Netanyahu's proposed interim agreement in which
Israeli troops would withdraw from south Lebanon for security
arrangements along the Israeli-Lebanese border, known as "Lebanon
First."
</P>
<P>
The report mentioned no word about the identity of the envoy,
while it said that at least one of Netanyahu's advisors, either
his military aide Ze'av Levneh, or his foreign policy advisor
Dore Gold was present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Gold subsequently met with the Syrian ambassador to the U.S.
Walid Mualim to discuss the international inspection committee in
south Lebanon when he accompanied Netanyahu during his visit to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The report speculated that the Gold-Mualim meeting in fact
carried the secret talks in Israel to a stage further.
</P>
<P>
Haaretz said, under the "Lebanon First" proposal, the Israeli
army would withdraw from its self-declared "security zone" in
south Lebanon in exchange for security arrangements along
Israel-Lebanon border.
</P>
<P>
When the proposal was first initiated by Israel following
Netanyahu's election victory, Syria's public reaction was that
Israel could go ahead and withdraw from south Lebanon, while
declining to make any promises.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese at the time rejected the proposal out of hand,
saying it was nearly a trap which Israel was setting for Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Warren Christopher
reportedly told the International Relations Committee of the U.S.
Congress last week that although he had no illusion about the
nature of the Syrian government, there had been a number of
positive results from his recent trip there, including ending
cross-border shelling between Israel and Lebanon, and the
existing troop disengagement agreement.
</P>
<P>
Syria, the power broker in Lebanon, has strongly urged a total
Israeli withdrawal from the so-called "security Zone" in south
Lebanon, and the Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Childbirth Instruction Helps Nervous Mothers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Many women in Shanghai now want
to have their babies at the city's No.1 Maternal and Childrens
Hospital because of a popular new service provided there.
</P>
<P>
The "accompanying you until childbirth" program arranges for
expectant women to have other women or midwives who have
experience with childbirth on hand during the process of
birth-giving.
</P>
<P>
The hospital is the first one in China to introduce this
service. Women in labor are given comfort and instruction by their
companions, thus making the delivery easier and safer, according
to staff members of the hospital.
</P>
<P>
"I was afraid at the beginning because I knew little about
childbirth," said Gan Huifang, who works at the Shanghai No.5
Weaving Factory.
</P>
<P>
"But the companion made me feel much more comfortable since she
advised and instructed me a lot," Gan said.
</P>
<P>
Prof. Wang Defen, director of the Obstetrics and Gynaecology
Department of the hospital, says the service benefits both women
in labor and doctors.
</P>
<P>
"The rate of Caesarean sections and complications during
childbirth have dropped markedly since we introduced the service,"
she said.

On the morning of July 12, Zhong had managed to cross the cable
easily on the 10th anniversary of his highwire act between two
hills, according to the Beijing Evening News. But, on the way
back, while performing an upside-down stunt that was his
masterpiece, he slipped and fell along a 100-meter cliff.
</P>
<P>
He was rushed to a nearby hospital, but because of numerous
injuries and the loss of a great deal of blood, he died at 2:40
p.m.
</P>
<P>
This left unfulfill Zhong's dream of crossing the Yangtze and
Yellow rivers, the two most important rivers in China, in this way.
</P>
<P>
Zhong started performing on the highwire with two other
acrobats 10 years ago and signed a contract with the management of
the mountain resort for the dangerous performance.
</P>
<P>
Although the contract called for Zhong and his colleagues to
wear a safety belt while performing, Zhong would often refused to
comply with the contract, saying that it was more stimulating
without it.
</P>
<P>
After Zhong's death, the two other acrobats suspended their
performances.

<HEADLINE> Pegging of Tobacco Leaf Purchase Price Proposed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- An advisory council to the
president of Japan Tobacco Inc. (JT) has proposed pegging the
purchase price of tobacco leaves for the 1996 harvest year at
1,913.74 yen per kilogram, Kyodo News Service reported.
</P>
<P>
This compares with a JT request for cutting the price by an
average of 4.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The price reduction is necessary for competition with foreign
tobacco companies, JT said.
</P>
<P>
But council officials representing tobacco leaf producers were
against the request, citing damage to crops from typhoons in some
part of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The council endorsed a JT plan to expand the area designated
for tobacco leaf cultivation in the 1997 harvest year by 633
hectares to 26,748 hectares.

SHENYANG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Four famous Chinese warships
that have been resting at the bottom of the Yellow Sea for more
than 100 years, are expected to be salvaged soon by the government
of Donggang city in northeast China's Liaoning province.
</P>
<P>
The sunken warships belonged to the Northern Fleet of the Qing

fight Japanese invaders in the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895,
which was launched by the Japanese aggressors.
</P>
<P>
The ships were attacked and later sank.
</P>
<P>
Deng Shichang, who has been a renowned national hero in China,
and 250 fellow officers and men aboard the warship "Zhiyuan," were
killed when their ship was struck by Japanese torpedos.
</P>
<P>
The salvage effort will be jointly carried out by the State
Bureau of Cultural Relics, the Museum of Chinese History and the
Academy of Arts of China.

KUALA LUMPUR, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Royal Malaysian Navy
today successfully launched a 20-year-old missile in a firing
test, which it contributed to good maintenance, the official
Bernama news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In the test carried out about 30 nautical miles off West
Malaysia's coastal city of Kuantan in South China Sea, the
France-made sea-skimming anti-ship missile hit the target -- a
barge equipped with a radar reflector 20 nautical miles away.
</P>
<P>
Malaysian Defense Minister Syed Hamid Albar, Armed Forces Chief
Ismail Omar, Army Chief Noor Mat Arshad and Navy Chief Ahmad Ramli
Mohd Nor witnessed the firing, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Noting that the missile was well past its life-span of 18 years
specified by the manufacturer, Aerospatiale, Syed Hamid said that
the successful launching reflected the Royal Malaysian Navy's
maintenance expertise in handling high technology weaponry.
</P>
<P>
This was the second missile launch by the Malaysian navy. The
first launch took place a year ago during the "Taming Sari" naval
exercise in Malacca Straits.

<HEADLINE> VD Cases Rising in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China's reported cases of eight
major venereal diseases (VD), including HIV/AIDS, gonorrhea and
syphilis, increased to 362,000 last year, and are rising by 18
percent annually.
</P>
<P>
Venereal disease may become the country's No.1 infectious
disease, with over 800,000 patients expected by the year 2000,
said Professor Ye Shunzhang, director of the National Venereal
Disease Control Center (NVDCC).
</P>
<P>
He said that the people's improved awareness about sex is
responsible for the increase in VD through sexual transmission,
while substandard hygiene conditions, such as infected toilets or
bathtubs, also contribute to the high incidence of the illness.
</P>
<P>
Except for HIV/AIDS, almost all venereal diseases can be cured
with early diagnosis and proper treatment, he said. But some
patients wish to keep their condition a secret and prefer to be
treated by private medical personnel, who often are unqualified
and prescribe unscientific treatments that can have harmful
results, said professor Ye, also the director of the Skin Diseases
Institute of the Chinese Academy of Medical Sciences (CAMS).
</P>
<P>
Ye suggested that the patients seek professional medical
treatment from state-run hospitals as soon as they discover they
are infected.
</P>
<P>
To provide immediate and effective treatment for VD patients,
the NVDCC and the Skin Diseases Institute of the CAMS have opened
a VD clinic on Mochou Road in the capital city of east China's
Jiangsu Province.

Thursday they are investigating the ''disappearance'' of some 500
Sierra Leonean passports which occurred in late 1993.
</P>
<P>
They have traced what one police official called ''a
mystery'' to a Hong Kong Chinese national Josef Leon who fled to
neighbouring Guinea by boat when the then military government
"wanted Leon arrested.''
</P>

According to the police, the passports including diplomatic and
ordinary ones, were issued under a barter system as a means of
procuring vital commodities for Sierra Leone.

<P>
A top official at the Ministry of Judicial Affairs said they
were now putting together information got so far to charge
some former military government officials with conspiracy and
larceny involving stolen passports.
</P>
<P>
He said that immigration officials will not be charged as they
were ''simply told left and they turned left. Right and they did
the same. We are being very careful how we proceed in this matter."

<HEADLINE> China Cautions Against Mass Exodus of Flood-Stricken Farmers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese Ministry of Civil
Affairs is urging governments of flood-stricken regions to take
effective measures that will help restore civilians' lives and
prevent a potential mass exodus of farmers.
</P>
<P>
The ministry said in a circular that China is still confronting
the daunting task of rehabilitating flood-ravaged regions, but
that a stable social order has been maintained in these areas.
</P>
<P>
The ministry cautioned against a possible widespread departure
of farmers from their flooded regions, and urged all local
governments to follow the situation closely.
</P>
<P>
The ministry called on all local civil affairs offices to
report on losses caused by flooding, and to work in close
cooperation with auditing and supervision departments to prevent
relief money or items from being squandered.
</P>
<P>
"The most pressing task is to solve problems facing the
flood-stricken people, making sure they have food to eat, clothes
to wear, temporary dwellings to live in and timely medical
treatment when necessary," the circular said.
</P>
<P>
The circular said that relief grain should be allocated to
people in need, and that temporary housing be provided promptly.
</P>
<P>
"The majority of the homeless people should be able to move
into new dwellings by winter," the circular states.
</P>
<P>
While they will receive state relief and support, all flooded
regions should begin their agricultural and industrial production
as quickly as possible, in an effort to "save themselves by
production," the circular said.
</P>
<P>
The ministry has linked the flood-relief work directly with
leading departments of local civil affairs, to make certain that
all flood victims receive necessary support.

<HEADLINE> ICBC to Invest More in Power Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China's largest state bank, the
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC), has announced
more loans for the country's power industry, long regarded as a
bottleneck in the economy.
</P>
<P>
"The move is also in response to the call by the central
government to give priority to the country's infrastructure, such
as the power industry and transportation," said a bank official.
</P>
<P>
ICBC will adjust the fixed-assets investment structure, and
provide more loans to the basic industries of power, posts and
telecommunications, transportation and petrochemicals, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the head office of the bank, and its directly-run
branches, will be responsible for granting loans directly to large
power projects, and will encourage other sub-branches to put more
money into the power industry to ensure a large margin
increase in the amount of loans for the sector.
</P>
<P>
"When offering more loans to the industry, we shall also take
measures to guarantee that the money will be put into place timely
by using our advanced settlement network," he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the self-operating business, the bank will also
make efforts to expand its agent business, provide international
settlement and finance services, as well as an appraisal and
consulting service, to support the development of the power
industry.
</P>
<P>
From 1979, when the bank started to operate fixed-assest
credit, to the end of 1995, ICBC granted a total of more than
20 billion yuan in loans to China's power industry.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Port Suffers from UN Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Red Sea port of Aqaba,
which is the main outlet for Iraqi imports, has been suffering
from losses due to the sharp fall of the Iraqi shipments because
of the six-year-old U.N. sanctions on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The volume of commodities that are re-exported via the Aqaba
port to Iraq saw a sharp fall, which was estimated at less than a
quarter of the normal levels before the Gulf war, according to
today's issue of the English-language weekly The Star.
</P>
<P>
A report by Jordanian businessmen indicated that Iraq's
imported foodstuff via Aqaba fell by 28 percent in the first half
of this year as a result of a delay in the implementation of the
oil-for-food formula which was signed between the U.N. and Iraq in
May.
</P>
<P>
Figures available show that in the first half of this year,
Iraq imported, via Aqaba, 237,545 tons of three basic commodities,
namely, sugar, rice and wheat, a decline of 28 percent over the
same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The decline is because Iraq has postponed the import of grain
while awaiting the implementation of the oil-for-food formula,
which will allow Iraq to sell 2 billion U.S. dollars of oil to buy
food and other supplies for its people.
</P>
<P>
The report revealed that the volume of total cargo received
through the Aqaba port in the first half of this year went down by
3.6 percent over the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Shipping agents hope that Aqaba, the main port for discharge
of shipments, will handle 30 to 40 percent of foodstuffs
purchased by Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Jordanian officials said Aqaba port authorities have provided
competitive low prices for delivery in a bid to attract more
Iraqi shipments.

URUMQI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Nearly 84,000 families that
formerly roamed the vast grassland year round in northwest China
have said good-bye to their century-old nomadic lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
These families, who account for half of all the herdsmen living
in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, now live in permanent
settlements with schools, hospitals, shops and technical service
centers.
</P>
<P>
The death toll of livestock has dropped to three percent since
herdsmen built animal sheds and improved the quality of grass used
for feed.
</P>
<P>
About 12 percent, or 12,000 of the herdsmen are employed in
factories, travel agencies and service sectors.
</P>
<P>
The per capita income has increased by one third to 1,200 yuan
a year, making color TV sets, video recorders and fine furniture
common sights in many households.
</P>
<P>
And the school attendance rate has risen from 72 percent to 94
percent.
</P>
<P>
Xinjiang, China's second largest pastureland, has 53 million ha
of usable natural grassland. Herdsmen of various minority
nationalities formerly led a nomadic life there, and much of their
livestock died from exposure to harsh weather.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986, the local government has built a number of
settlements and man-made forage bases throughout the

<HEADLINE> Better Use of Chinese as Official Language Urged in Macao </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MACAO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Macao Legislative
Assembly (LA) has urged the goverment to promote the use of
Chinese as an official language to large sphere, the "Macao Daily
News" reported today.
</P>
<P>
Kou Hoi In, member of the Macao LA said at a session of the
assembly on Wednesday that authorities should step up the process
of the use of Chinese as an official language so that the
government can better communicate with local citizens.
</P>
<P>
To promote the use of Chinese will also help improve the
efficiency of administration, and bring a positive influence to
the localization of civil servants and the localization of law, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The localization of civil servants and law and the use of
Chinese as an official language are considered to be the three
leading issues in the transitional period of Macao before China
resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Macao in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Kou said that although certain efforts have been made since
the government made the promise to promote the use of Chinese as
an official language, "the progress is unsatisfactory and a lot of
problems still remain to be resolved."
</P>
<P>
One of the problems, he said, is that the use of Chinese as an
official language has been taken as an excuse to promote both
Portuguese and Chinese. Only those civil servants who have better
command of Portuguese get the chance of promotion.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that greater efforts should be made to train more
bilingual personnel. The Chinese course training priority is those
civil servants who plan to remain in government organs after 1999
but only know Portuguese language, he said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Reporters to Explore Yangtze River on Foot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A team of six young reporters
will begin a long march this month along the banks of the
6,300-km-long Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Sources from the "Three Gorges News" said that the journalists
will spend two or three years walking from the river's source in
the high mountains in western China to its mouth at the Pacific
Ocean.
</P>
<P>
The reporters from the newspaper will cover economic and social
changes taking place in the Yangtze tributaries and spread
information about the Three Gorges dam, the largest in the world.
</P>
<P>
It is believed to be the first collectively-organized
expedition along the river on foot in history, sources said.
</P>
<P>
They added that the team expects to face danger, particularly
the wild animals they may encounter when they camp outdoors on the
Qinghai-Tibet plateau.
</P>
<P>
From September, 1995, through this January, a pioneer team was
sent by the group to collect first-hand information about the
upper reaches of the river, the most dangerous section.
</P>
<P>
The expedition will be funded by several local companies, and
also a national company that is involved in building the Three
Gorges project.
</P>
<P>
The Yangtze is the third longest river in the world and a major
attraction for adventurers. Since the 1980s, more than a dozen
people have been killed in boating accidents on the river's upper
reaches.
</P>
<P>
The river course has become a new attraction, as the reform and
opening-up have brought new economic development to the area in
recent years.
</P>
<P>
The Three Gorges dam project now under construction is located
on the middle reaches of the river.

<HEADLINE> Siemens Nixdorf Keen on China Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Germany's Siemens Nixdorf
Informationssysteme AG, Europe's largest information technology
(IT) supplier, is expected to occupy five percent of China's
market in IT by the turn of the century.
</P>
<P>
Oskar Tondolo, chief representative of the company in China,
told a press conference here today about Siemens Nixdorf's
investment plan in China.
</P>
<P>
Tondolo made the remarks during a five-day international
banking exhibition that opened yesterday in the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Siemens Nixdorf will invest more than 10 million US dollars in
market development in China during the next fiscal year, expecting
to bring in 65 million deutsche marks in business volume, said
Tondolo.
</P>
<P>
While consolidating its position in Europe, Siemens Nixdorf, a
computer company belonging to Siemens AG, is shifting its
investment focus to the Asia-Pacific Region, especially to China,
he said.
</P>
<P>
Asia is experiencing rapid economic growth, and China has
witnessed the fastest development in the region, encouraging
Siemens Nixdorf to increase investment in the country, said
Tondolo.
</P>
<P>
The company has provided IT and solutions to the Chinese
government, and banking, retail sales, transportation and
manufacturing industries, through its sales of PCs, Unix systems,
automatic service facilities and cash registers.
</P>
<P>
In the next two years, Siemens Nixdorf will focus investment in
China's banking sector, said Tondolo.
</P>
<P>
Estimates show that China will have a need for more than 5,000
ATM machines this year, which has encouraged the company to send
its up-to-date technology in the sector to China.
</P>
<P>
One of the world's four largest ATMs producers, Siemens Nixdorf
showcased its new-generation face recognition bank cash machine at
the exhibition, which identifies customers by their faces instead
of relying on the usual PIN number.
</P>
<P>
The eye-catching machine, which can wipe the smile off the
faces of cash-card cheats, made its Asia debut in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
During the next five years, the annual growth rate of the
company's business volume in China is expected to reach 60
percent; by the year 2000, one-third of its sales in Asia will be
in China's market.
</P>
<P>
With offices in Beijing, Shanghai and Guangzhou, Siemens
Nixdorf has engineering bases in Shenyang and Wuhan, as well as a
PC manufacturing joint venture in Fuqing city in east China's
Fujian province.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Asia's GDP Growth Slower But Healthy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Policy adjustments by governments
have led to a slower expansion of the Asian economy this year, but
the growth will remain strong and healthy with buoyant
investments, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, the developing Asia recorded another year of
remarkably buoyant economic performance, achieving an overall real
GDP (gross domestic products) growth rate of 7.9 percent, and
China again registered the highest growth rate of 10.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
But since the beginning of this year, many Asian countries,
while maintaining high economic growth, have undertaken structural
reforms and policy adjustments to make the growth slower but
healthy and sustainable.
</P>
<P>
After macro economic policy adjustments, China's economy grew
moderately this year as inflation steadily fell. According to
official estimates, China's gross domestic products (GDP) amounted
to 2,975.6 billion yuan (358 billion US dollars) in the first six
months of this year, up 9.8 percent over year-ago figures.
</P>
<P>
China's retail price index in the first half of 1996 rose 7.1
percent over the same month of 1995, and the consumer price index
went up by 9.2 percent, dropping by 11.4 percentage points,
respectively.
</P>
<P>
In other Asian countries, the pace of the economic growth has
also slowed down due to tight monetary policies. In the first
quarter, Malaysia's GDP, which grew by 9.6 percent last year,
recorded an 8.3 percent gain. South Korea, whose GDP increased by
9.2 percent last year, experienced a 7.9 percent gain. Thailand's
growth decelerated to about 8 percent from last year's 8.6
percent.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest quarterly economic review by Crosby
Research LTD, an international research institution, China's GDP
growth would slow to 9.5 percent in 1996 from 10.2 percent in
1995. Indonesia's GDP was tipped to grow 8 percent, compared to
8.1 percent last year, and Malaysia's is expected to expand by 8.6
percent, compared to 9.5 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
Crosby predicted that Singapore's GDP growth would slow to 8.3
percent this year from 8.9 percent in 1995, and Thailand's to 8.5
percent from 8.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) predicted in the April outlook
that the developing Asia's economic growth would slow down to 7.1
percent this year from 7.9 percent last year.
</P>
<P>
However, the slowdown across the region does not mean Asia's
economic growth has lost its momentum. Analysts here said that
growth will slow this year in most of Asian economies as tight
(monetary) policy takes hold, but growth levels will remain high
because of Asia's still huge investment pipeline.
</P>
<P>
At present, foreign direct investment remains strong throughout
the region, with Japan, South Korea, China's Taiwan and Hongkong
being the region's principal suppliers. As a result of the
decades-long rises in the yen and higher cost at home, many
Japanese manufacturers have shifted production to places like
Malaysia, Indonesia and China.
</P>
<P>
Japanese economists said that Asia can expect to experience a
strong growth in Japanese direct investment over the next few
years as producers in Japan continue adjustments for the strong
yen. Japanese manufacturing investment in the Asian markets is
expected to rise to 50 percent in the next few years from 42
percent now.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the increasing foreign investments, domestic
investment in infrastructure will also maintain the present growth
momentum in Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that an estimated sum of 1.5 trillion US
dollars are earmarked for spending on the region's infrastructure
between now and 2004. Many Asian countries are spending 5 percent
of their GDP on new power plants, telecommunication networks,
transportation systems and water and sanitation equipment.
</P>
<P>
Besides, economists said, fast increases in personal
consumption in the region have become another important factor for
sustainable growth. In many Asian countries, notably in urban
areas, people are earning more and spending more. The increases
in personal consumption would help lead Asia further along a
strong growth path.
</P>
<P>
Many Asian economists believe that Asia's booming economies are
on course for healthy growth into the next century, but the
immediate road ahead is not all smooth.
</P>
<P>
At present, Asian economies are facing serious growth
constraints because of a drop in export growth and a shortage of
skilled labor.
</P>
<P>
The export drop, which is enlarging trade deficits of Asian
countries, was attributed to rising wages, a production glut, and
a corresponding fall in overseas markets, especially in Europe and
the United States.
</P>
<P>
Thailand's exports this year have only increased 5.7 percent on
a year-on-year basis against 26.9 percent in 1995. The Thai
Central Bank said that rising wages and cost of materials had
eroded the competitiveness of Thai products.
</P>
<P>
Singapore's non-oil export growth will slow to around 9 percent
in the next two quarters, from around 13 percent now, due to the
lower world demand for electronics, the country's major export
item.
</P>
<P>
The shortage of skilled labor is threatening to drive wages
higher and halt the surge in the inflow of foreign investments in
Asia. Japan has already begun to back off from Thailand, citing
the lack of skilled labor as a key impediment to more investment.
For the same reason, Japan's investment in Malaysia dropped nearly
8 percent in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Asian countries are continuing their structural
reforms and economic adjustments, which could remove the
constrains and make their economic growth healthy and sustainable
in the coming years.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Projected at 8.5 Percent for 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Malaysian Institute of
Economic Research has projected Malaysia's real gross domestic
product (GDP) at 8.5 percent in 1996 and 8.3 percent in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Private consumption remaining strong for the year was forecast
to grow by 9.9 percent in 1996 and 8.9 percent in 1997, the
Malaysian news agency reported quoting the institute's executive
director Sulaiman Mahbob today.
</P>
<P>
According to Sulaiman, public consumption growth would be
sustained at 4.9 percent in 1996 and a 5.2 percent growth was
projected for 1997.
</P>
<P>
Growth of private investment was expected to moderate both in
1996 and 1997, which was forecast to be 11.2 percent in 1996 and
9.6 percent in 1997 while public investment was forecast to grow
by 9.2 percent and 8.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
Sulaiman said that due to the latest development in the
external sector, growth in exports marginally exceeded growth in
imports and the merchandise balance was forecast to register a
higher surplus of 1.1 billion ringgit (about 440 million US
dollars) in 1996 and further improve to 3.6 billion ringgit (about
1.44 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
However, he said, the better surplus in the merchandise balance
was still unable to make up for the deficit in the services
balance.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance, he said, would remain in deficit
by 19.2 billion ringgit (about 7.68 billion dollars) in 1996 and
19.4 billion ringgit (about 7.76 billion dollars) in 1997. This
amounts to 8.4 percent and 7.5 percent of nominal gross national
product (GNP) for 1996 and 1997 respectively, he said.
</P>
<P>
His institute projected the inflation rate at 3.7 percent for
1996 and 3.6 percent for 1997 and the unemployment rate was
forecast at 2.8 percent for both 1996 and 1997.

<HEADLINE> China to Tap More Oil Reserves Using New System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China expects to discover four or
five major oil reserves this year with help from a new exploration
system, and experts predict that the country's recoverable oil
reserves will reach more than 120 million tons.
</P>
<P>
China has introduced a new oil exploration system that breaks
away with its existing mode of seclusion and opens more oil
exploration markets to both domestic and foreign oil companies,
according to a senior official with the China National Petroleum
Corp (CNPC).
</P>
<P>
Under the new system, the country's potential oil reserve areas
have been categorized into four types: areas to be explored by
foreign oil companies, national corporations, domestic oil giants
and local oil enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The new way has been successful, the CNPC official noted, for
it has expanded the country's oil exploration areas, and a large
group of idle blocks in Western China now are being effectively
explored.
</P>
<P>
To date, an area of nearly 2.5 million sq km has been open to
foreign companies for oil exploration. China has signed more than
30 oil exploration contracts and agreements with overseas oil
companies, with total contracted areas totaling 150,000 sq km.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, two public bidding sessions were held to
invite domestic oil enterprises to initiate oil prospecting.
</P>
<P>
The Daqing, Shengli and Huabei oil fields, the country's
leading oil producers, won bids for exploring oil reserves in the
northwestern, southwestern and eastern blocks of the Tarim Basin
in northwest China's Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, with total
areas hitting 117,000 sq km.
</P>
<P>
China has developed specialized service markets for oil
exploration and practices the optimum oil-seeking method, giving
priority to the areas most likely to be productive.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Suffers Trade Deficit With Seoul for Years </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Bangkok, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Thailand has suffered trade
deficit with south Korea for nine years because of Seoul's trade
protection policy and lack of awareness of Thai goods.
</P>
<P>
In the first half of this year, Thailand exported 284.3 million
dollars' worth of goods to South Korea and its imports were worth
672.5 million dollars, resulting in a deficit of 388.2 million
dollars.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral trade favored Thailand in 1985/86, but went to south
Korea's favor when the Seoul government introduced serious import
control and export promotion measures, according to the Bangkok
Post, which today quotes a report of the Thai embassy in Seoul as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Thailand imports from South Korea steel products, chemical
fertilizers, machinery, vehicles, home electrical appliances,

HANOI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Prime Minister Vo Van

<HEADLINE> King Hussein to Visit Syria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, August 1 (Xinhua) -- King Hussein of Jordan is
scheduled to visit Syria Saturday for talks with President Hafez
al-Assad on means to revive the peace process and seal the
reconciliation efforts between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Sources here told Xinhua that King Hussein's visit to Syria
came within the Jordanian efforts to jump-start the Arab-Israeli
peace talks, which have come to a deadlock since the first of a
spate of suicide bombings in Israel in late February.
</P>
<P>
It will be the king's first visit to Damascus since May 1994,
five months before Jordan signed a peace treaty with Israel, which
made ties between the two Arab states soured.
</P>
<P>
The king met al-Assad for the first time in nearly three
years, on the sidelines of the pan-Arab summit held in Cairo in
June.
</P>
<P>
In Cairo, King Hussein presented the Syrian president with a
file detailing the 56 allegedly terrorist attempts against Jordan
launched by Syria-based radical Palestinian groups.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders, during the meetings, expressed their hope to
promote their ties so as to achieve a unified stand in the
Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have been keeping their contact at all levels
following the Arab summit.
</P>
<P>
On the peace process, King Hussein is expected to get familiar
with Syria's positions and proposals during his upcoming visit.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noted that the king had planned to visit Syria
after Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's visit to the
Kingdom, which had been scheduled on July 25 but postponed to
Monday due to the king's health condition.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic sources here told Xinhua that King Hussein's
decision to visit Damascus before Netanyahu's visit indicates
that the king hopes to convey Syria's message to the Israeli prime
minister and "bridge the gap" between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu has angered the Arab world by upholding his hardline
policy on rejecting the principle of "land for peace."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon to be Last to Sign Peace with Israel: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi,
in his speech marking Lebanon's Army Day, stressed here this
morning that Lebanon will be the last Arab country to sign peace
agreements with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a graduation ceremony in the School of War on the
51th anniversary of the army's founding, the president underlined
that Lebanon upholds a "united Arab position" in advancing the
peace process, ensuring an Arab victory and restoring the Arab
dignity.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi welcomed the international cease-fire monitoring
committee in south Lebanon, but he noted that "this committee is
not a political solution."
</P>
<P>
The committee, comprising representatives from the United
States, France, Israel, Syria and Lebanon, was established
according to a cease-fire understanding reached by Lebanon and
Israel following a half-month-long Israeli blitz in south Lebanon
in April.
</P>
<P>
"The political solution lies on the implementation of
U.N. Security Council Resolution 425, which calls for an
unconditional Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon," the
president said.
</P>
<P>
He promised that the Lebanese military forces and
international peacekeepers would guarantee the security on the
border in case of an Israeli withdrawal.
</P>
<P>
Lashing out at a recent Israeli proposal on a unilateral
withdrawal from south Lebanon, the Lebanese leader said, "If
Israel is convinced that its occupation in southern Lebanon does
not guarantee its security and is determined on the withdrawal, it
has no other choice but to implement Resolution 425."
</P>
<P>
Implying Lebanon's position refusing to sign peace accords
with Israel ahead of Syria, Hrawi announced that "Lebanon is for
just and comprehensive peace and is with our Arab brothers, and it
will be the last to sign peace agreements with Israel."
</P>
<P>
"Israel can not with one hand hold the negotiations on peace
and with the other hand practise violence against our people in
southern Lebanon as what happened in April," the president added.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China will, as from this year,
start to select outstanding soldiers and award each of them a
badge to be signed by President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
The practice has been approved by the Central Military
Commission, with an aim to produce better military personnel,
soldiers who have "lofty ideals, socialist ethics, culture, and
disciplines", and to give them initiative.
</P>
<P>
The badge is to be bronze with gold plate. It has a five-point
star, evergreen bough and rays of light, signifying a growing
number of outstanding soldiers in the People's Liberation Army,
and four characters for "outstanding soldier" are in Jiang's
calligraphy. Jiang is general secretary of the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee and chairman of the Central Military
Commission.
</P>
<P>
The army came up with a development program for gross-roots
units two years ago, and all army commands are encouraging units
to compete in performing better services.
</P>
<P>
So far, more than 20,000 model units and some 800,000
outstanding soldiers have emerged.
</P>
<P>
Today is the 69th anniversary of the founding of the PLA.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading Egyptian Newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Al-Ahram:
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak told U.S. Congressmen
during his visit to the U.S. that a just peace achieves security
and eliminates terrorism, and urged the U.S. Congress to back the
rights of the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
-- Saudi Arabia and the United States have agreed to move some
4,000 U.S. troops stationed in the kingdom to a desert air force
base in an effort to better protect them from terrorism, and Saudi
Arabia has agreed to pay half of the cost, which is estimated at
200 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Al-Akhbar:
</P>
<P>
-- Syrian President Hafez al-Assad affirmed on the occasion of
the 51st anniversary of the Syrian Army Day his country's adherence
to principles that call for establishing a just and comprehensive
peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
-- Egyptian Transport Minister Sulaiman Metwalli Sulaiman said
Japan has agreed to spend some 83 million U.S. dollars to help

<HEADLINE> Former US Secretary State Favors World Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Former U.S. Secretary of State
George Shultz is thought to have suggested to Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu that a regional branch of the World
Bank be set up to replace the proposed Middle East development
bank.
</P>
<P>
The idea comes amid growing opposition to the plan to
establish a Cairo-based development bank, reported The Jerusalem
Post today.
</P>
<P>
While the U.S. President Bill Clinton Administration insists on
the idea, the U.S. Congress has given it only verbal, not
financial support. It is holding back on contributing 260 million
U.S. dollars, or 21 percent, of the bank's start-up capital over
five years.
</P>
<P>
The idea to establish the development bank was initially
raised during the first Middle East and North Africa Economic
Summit held in Morocco in 1994. The EU countries, including
Germany, Britain and France, expressed doubt about its feasibility
from the very beginning, saying that it will merely be a
bureaucratic machine.
</P>
<P>
The development bank would finance infrastructure projects in
Egypt, Jordan, Israel and Palestinian autonomous areas in an era
of peace.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his visit to Washington last month, Netanyahu was said
to be skeptical about its value, but by the time he visited
Egypt, he was lending his support to the idea during talks with
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
One of the key proponents of the development bank, Netanyahu's
predecessor Shimon Peres, said in November that some 10 billion
U.S. dollars could be raised in the region, but it has not
happened, as the support for the plan has only come from poorer
Arab states.
</P>
<P>
The rise of Israel's rightwing Likud to power has also
affected the enthusiasm about the regional economic cooperation,
including the establishment of the bank.
</P>
<P>
It is in this light that Shultz is believed to have suggested
that the World Bank open a branch in Cairo instead.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's office said that there has been no formal
recommendation from the United States to give up the development
bank.

<HEADLINE> Hashimoto Shrine Visit Hit in Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A group of demonstrators
marched to the Japanese consulate-general in Hong Kong Wednesday
to condemn Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto's visit to
Tokyo's Shrine, local media reported today.
</P>
<P>
The demonstration was organized by coalition of the Hong Kong
Federation of Trade Unions and the Reparation Association of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators said that Hashimoto's visit to Yasukuni
Shinto shrine on Monday marked a revival of Japan's militarism.
</P>
<P>
They said the visit clearly indicated that the Japanese
government had no remorse for the country's war crimes in World
War II, but glorified the war and paid respect to the Japan's war
criminals.
</P>
<P>
The group said that Japan's militarism led to the invasion of
China and other Asian countries, adding that Japan's war crimes
could not be denied.
</P>
<P>
The demonstrators noted that militarism remains deeply
ingrained in the psyche of some of the Japanese and said that
Japan should make a sincere apology.
</P>
<P>
The protesters repeated their objection to the erection of a
lighthouse by a right-wing Japanese youth group in the contested
Diaoyudao Islands which are of China's territories.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Reportedly Makes Secret Diplomatic Trip </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Amid reports of intensive
diplomatic activities on the Lebanese track of the peace process,
a speculation has surfaced here about a secret trip by Israeli
Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to Europe last weekend,
reported The Jerusalem Post today.
</P>
<P>
It quoted informed sources as saying that Netanyahu slipped
out of the country with several aides last Friday and flew to an
unrevealed destination.
</P>
<P>
Some observers speculate on his meeting in France with
President Jacques Chirac. Netanyahu's office confirmed last Thursday
that the prime minister spoke to Chirac by phone. The two
leaders had met when Netanyahu was in opposition. Netanyahu held
talks in Jerusalem with French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette
on July 24.
</P>
<P>
France is believed to be a key player in Lebanon, and
Netanyahu's main diplomatic initiative is a Lebanon-first approach,
which could lead to an agreement with Syria for an Israeli
pullout from south Lebanon in return for security arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, France just hosted a meeting this week of the top
seven industrialized states to discuss anti-terrorism
measures. Netanyahu, who gives first priority to his policy on the
peace process, is apparently eager to know the outcome of the

<P>
Another possibility for a quiet Netanyahu trip could be
Bonn. Netanyahu is considered to have been impressed with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl, whom the premier also met while in
opposition. Germany mediated last week's exchange of Hezbollah
prisoners and bodies for the remains of two Israeli soldiers
killed in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
One official in the prime minister's office said, "I can
flatly deny that the prime minister visited any Moslem state,
including any Arab country." He refused to relate to other
possibilities.
</P>
<P>
Shai Bazak, the prime minister's spokesman, has denied that
Netanyahu left the country during the period. Nevertheless,
observers here said that in the Middle East, anything may
happen.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Hainan Province in south China has
developed new regulations to better protect the rights of workers
and those covered by the labor contract system.
</P>
<P>
Hainan was one of the first provinces in China to implement the
labor contract system in almost all enterprises, acting in
accordance with the Labor Law and conventional international
practices.
</P>
<P>
The regulations clearly stipulate the work hours, spare time,
social welfare, and other areas of dispute for laborers, as well
as the necessity, alterations, or termination of the labor
contracts.
</P>
<P>
For contracts of less than one year, the regulations specifies
that enterprises are not allowed to use a probation period for
laborers.
</P>
<P>
There are also articles that cover illegal actions, such as the
dismissal of workers without a good reason, negligence in
training, or delayed payment of salaries.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa Probes Rail Station Stampede </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A massive investigation has
been launched by the police, metrorail and the government to
uncover how and why a ticket clampdown turned into a bloodbath of
15 deaths and 65 injuries, "the Star" paper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The tragedy occurred at the Tembisa railway station outside
Johannesburg yesterday when security guards allegedly used electric
shock sticks to prevent commuters storming into the platform.
</P>
<P>
According to a police source, the stampede followed an argument
between commuters, security guards and a ticket inspector at the
station's ticket barrier.
</P>
<P>
Commuters were pushing down the steps of a railway bridge on to
the platform but the ticket inspector and security guards closed the
gate. The guards apparently used the shock sticks in an effort to
push back the crowd.
</P>
<P>
People at the back of the crowd apparently surged forward,
trampling scores who fell and were caught in the crush.
</P>
<P>
After the incident, President Nelson Mandela said in a statement
it was with "deep shock" that he heard of the disaster, calling it "a
national tragedy."
</P>
<P>
Mandela urged the public to "exercise calm" so officials could
probe the tragedy as quickly as possible.
</P>
<P>
"No stone will be left unturned to establish fully what the causes
were and where responsibility lies," added the president.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Gauteng's provincial government Premier Tokyo Sexwale
told an excited crowd at the scene that those responsible for the
tragedy would face the full weight of the law and urgent steps would
be taken to ensure that this sort of tragedy never happened again.
</P>
<P>
Sexwale said the commission of inquiry announced by Transport
Minister Mac Maharaj on Wednesday afternoon would also review the
situation at other train stations to prevent similar events.
</P>
<P>
While African National Congress parliamentary Member Winnir
Madikizela-Mandela, former wife of the president, also urged the
public not to take the law into their own hands.
</P>
<P>
"You have elected leaders to represent you, we will fight to see
that what happened today will never happen again," said Winnie.

<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serbs have accused
NATO Wednesday of dumping intentionally poisonous materials in the
Serb-held areas, polluting the living conditions there.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to U.S. President Bill Clinton, civil defence
organizations of nine cities in the Doboj region said that the
NATO troops have thrown poisonous materials in the region from
planes, helicopters and other flying crafts. This has not only
polluted air, water and surface of the region, but also has done
great harms to the health of animals, plants and particularly
human beings.
</P>
<P>
The organizations said that the NATO troops have imposed these
ecological damages on the region with intensions, because they
have received orders themselves not to drink the water or eat the
foods produced from the area.
</P>
<P>
In the letter, they also appealed to Clinton to put a stop to
this harmful action of NATO.

<HEADLINE> India to Extend Concessions to South Asian States </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- India will offer more tariff
concessions to the SAARC members in the forthcoming
inter-governmental meeting of the South Asia Preferential Trading
Arrangement (SAPTA) scheduled to be held in Islamabad this month,
Commerce Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
India intends to offer concessions to Pakistan and Sri Lanka
and duty-free access to the least developing countries like Nepal
and Bhutan on 100-150 tariff lines as part of its commitment to
make SAPTA a South Asia Free Trade Area (SAFTA) by 2005.
</P>
<P>
India offered concessions on 106 product lines to the SAARC
(South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation) states in the
previous SAPTA meeting held here in December 1995.
</P>
<P>
India has attached importance to the Islamabad meeting as it
expects that Pakistan would announce action plans in liberalizing
trade with the SAARC member states and on the issue of
most-favored nation (MFN) status to India, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
At the 1995 SAPTA meeting, India reiterated that the success of
the inter-governmental meetings would depend on offering MFN
status to India.
</P>
<P>
SAARC, formed in 1985, groups Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, the
Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka. The SAPTA started
functioning at the end of last year in a bid to enhance economic
and trade cooperation among the SAARC member states.

<HEADLINE> DPRK Criticizes Japanese PM for His Shrine Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PYONGYANG, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) severely criticized Japanese Prime
Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto for his recent visit to Tokyo's
Yasukuni Shrine, saying that Hashimoto's move reveals Japanese
militarists' renewed ambition of war of aggression.
</P>
<P>
In its commentary Thursday, the official newspaper Rodong
Sinmun pointed out that Hashimoto's move has shown that Japan's
militarism has not changed a bit in the years despite its shameful
failure in World War Two half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, the Asian nations and their peoples should be on
guard against Japan's tendency of reviving the defeated spirit of
militarism, the paper warned.
</P>
<P>
On July 29, Hashimoto broke a decade-long taboo on prime
ministerial visits to the shrine, which honors Japan's dead in its
war of aggression, and has provoked strong reaction both at home
and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Official visits to the shrine have long been a sensitive
political issue in Japan's internal politics and for the victims
of its war.

<HEADLINE> India to Raise Steel Prices Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, August 1 (Xinhua) -- India's steel prices are
expected to increase by around 400 rupees (11.94 US dollars) per
ton within a fortnight following the price hike for petroleum
products, Industry Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
A decision to this effect will be taken by the three major
steel producing companies in the country.
</P>
<P>
The proposal to apply an excise duty of 15 percent on all iron
and steel products in the new budget is bound to hit the
bottom-line of the country's three major steel producers, industry
experts said.
</P>
<P>
With a hike in the prices of steel imminent, several other
industries, including the capital goods industry, engineering
industry and automobile industry, are bound to be affected, the
sources said.
</P>
<P>
A new finance bill contains a provision by which the excise
duty on products sold through depots would be levied on the
ex-depot price and not ex-factory price as is the case till now.

<HEADLINE> 940,000 Overseas Tourists In Beijing In First Half of 96 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese capital played host
to some 940,000 overseas tourists in the first half of the year,
an increase of six percent over the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing has continued to be number one in
the country's tourist business in recent years.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, the capital also had more domestic
tourists, but figures are still not available.
</P>
<P>
This is mainly due to the five-day work-week that began in May
1995. The city has said it will place more importance on its
domestic tourism market, according to "Capital Economy and
Information News".
</P>
<P>
In 1995, some 70 million domestic tourists visited Beijing,
which had tourism revenues of 30 billion yuan (about 3.6 billion
US dollars), more than earnings from overseas tourism.
</P>
<P>
The city has more than 200 travel agencies and has tightened
the reins of its tourism business, suspending the licenses of 38
travel agencies that were not up to snuff. It has said that it
will offer better services to overseas tourists and pay more
attention to its domestic tourism business in future.

<HEADLINE> C'wealth Fund Launched in Harare </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Southern African countries are
poised for further economic development provided they take
advantage of the Commonwealth African Investment Fund (Comafin)
headquartered in Harare aimed at boosting investment in Africa.
</P>
<P>
The fund, whose initial capital is pegged at 60 million U.S.
Dollars will be administered by the Commonwealth Development
Corporation under the auspices of the Commonwealth Private
Investment Initiative (Cpii).
</P>
<P>
Officially launching the fund on Wednesday at a ceremony
attended by Commonwealth Secretary-General Emeka Anyaoku,
Zimbabwe's Vice-President Simon Muzenda applauded the fund
''laudable instrument of assistance'' coming at a time when
African countries are striving for sustainable development.
</P>
<P>
''We are particularly pleased to know that Comafin's intention
is to maximise its impact by promoting entrepreneurships within
the small to medium enterprise sector,'' said Muzenda.
</P>
<P>
Anyaoku said Comafin was the first of a series of regional
funds that ''we hope'' would be launched under the Cppi.
</P>
<P>
''At a time when official aid flows are becoming increasingly
constrained, Comafin will serve as an investment vehicle that
will seek to spread the benefits of the surge in private flows to
the emerging markets of countries that have largely been ignored
hitherto.
</P>
<P>
''Harare, as its headquarters, is well placed to serve as the
hub of activities, reaching out to the investment markets of
Africa's nineteen Commonwealth member countries,'' said Anyaoku.

<HEADLINE> Multimedia Asia '96 Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad today opened "Multimedia Asia '96," a multimedia
super corridor (MSC) exhibition.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony of the four-day event, Mahathir
announced that Malaysia will set up a multimedia development
corporation to develop the world's first MSC in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said the MSC is under construction and, upon completion,
will cover an area of 600 square kilometers around Kuala Lumpur
including an international airport.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 150 local and international exhibitors are taking part
in the show which will act as a platform to promote Malaysia as a
world class information technology hub.
</P>
<P>
The show of multimedia applications and products is expected to
attract 20,000 local and foreign visitors and 3,000 potential
buyers, according to sources.
</P>
<P>
A three-day conference to be held concurrently with the
exposition would provide a forum for the exchange of information
on Malaysia's MSC and business and technology issues besides
providing networking opportunities, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
At the conference, the sources said, discussions will be held
on "critical success factors for the MSC," "the East Asian
electric community," "social-cultural dimensions of the global
multimedia community" and "implications of the emerging digital
economy."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: New Loan Rules Significant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China issued a set of general
rules on loans, which became effective today.
</P>
<P>
Observers here viewed this as a milestone in the country's
drive to reform its financial set-up, observers say.
</P>
<P>
"Implementation of the 'General Rules on Loans' is a
significant move China has taken in reforming its financial system
and building a standard financial market," said Qin Chijiang in an
interview with Xinhua today. Qin is deputy director of the
Institute of Finance and Banking of the People's Bank of China,
the country's central bank
</P>
<P>
The rules, which were announced in June by the central bank,
relate to enterprises' marketability, management, efficiency, and
other criteria in getting loans. They are the first systematic
code of loan management since the founding of the People's Republic
of China in 1949.
</P>
<P>
The rules, 82 articles in 12 chapters, are meant to standardize
lending and borrowing, giving them a legal framework, and are a
"very important" part of finance, Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"They conform completely to China's needs in financial reform
and its effort to standardize and codify the market economy and
therefore are a significant milestone," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the rules, which allow financial
institutions to refuse coercive attempts by units or individuals
to secure loans, are helpful in establishing a healthy cycle of
issuing, using, and repaying loans, and in reducing financial
risks and corruption.
</P>
<P>
Observers here say that the lack of a legal basis has long kept
financial institutions from making more reasonable loan
arrangements, resulting in an increase in overdue, dud and bad
loans.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that around 20 percent of the loans were this
type last year.
</P>
<P>
Dai Xianglong, governor of the central bank, told a press
conference last month that "to enact the rules is to improve the
quality of the credit assets of commercial banks," and he went on
to say: "I believe the asset quality of banks will certainly
improve as a result of the implementation of the rules."
</P>
<P>
Zhu Xiaohua, deputy governor of the central bank, said that the
rules are designed to help alleviate financial risk, improve
capital efficiency and the quality of financial services, promote
fair competition in the loan market, and safeguard the rights and
interests of both lender and borrower.
</P>
<P>
Observers agree that the rules will help standardize the
relations of banks and enterprises in the loan business and
improve the safety, liquidity and profitability of bank loans.

<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The number of malaria cases
has increased, and in some places dramatically, in Cambodia this
year compared to last year.
</P>
<P>
Dr. Stephan Hoyer, the World Health Organization (WHO) medical
official for malaria control in Cambodia, attributes the increase
to an early rainy season.
</P>
<P>
While investigative reports were not yet complete on all
provinces, there had been a ten-fold increase in the
mosquito-borne disease in some districts, Hoyer said.
</P>
<P>
Although the number was higher this year, diagnosis and
treatment had improved so mortality rates were decreasing, said
health officials.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, there were more than 100,000 cases reported, with 600
deaths. But, the real number of cases was likely much higher,
they added.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Vebjorn Rodal of Norway clocked
one minute 42.59 seconds to win the men's 800 meters here this
evening in the Olympic athletics competition.
</P>
<P>
His winning time beat the previous Games record and brought the
first gold for Norway in the track and field contest.
</P>
<P>
"This is a very big for me, the biggest success I have had in
my athletic life," Rodal said after the race. "I went out there
just trying to run my own race and be ready to attack at 120
meters." He said he saved power and energy in the first 600 meters
in order to launch attacks on any one who was in front of him in
the last 200 meters.
</P>
<P>
"It all went well and that point (120 meters) I was pretty sure
that I could win," he said.
</P>
<P>
Rodal said he had trained four years for the event, running in
a tunnel under a mountain in his hometown, because it snows most
of the time in Norway.
</P>
<P>
Hezekiel Sepeng of South Africa wound up second in 1:42.74 and
Fred Onyancha of Kenya got the third position in 1:42.79.
</P>
<P>
"This is one of the highlights of my career," Sepeng said. "I
didn't think I had a chance, until I made the final. Then I
thought that we all had a chance."
</P>
<P>
Rodal, bronze medalist at last year's world championship, led
the field with 100 meters to go, chased by Onyancha, African
champion in 1995 and other runners.
</P>
<P>
Sepeng, 22, the fifth finisher at last year's world
championships, kicked hard on the home stretch and pipped Onyancha
at the line.
</P>
<P>
"I was very strong at the finish and left my timing too late,"
said Onyancha. At 120 meters I was stripped when I had time to go
past, so I missed my opportunity."

MOSCOW, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A total of 203 people suspected of
economic crimes were arrested in Moscow during the first six

During the first half of last year alone, the Interior Bureau
started legal proceedings against 1,102 economic criminal
cases. Another 1,654 similar cases are still under investigation,
the official added.
</P>
<P>
He complained that investigations into economic crimes had
always been dragged on due to pressure from highers-up.
</P>

The more high-ranking officials the case concerns, the more
difficult the investigations will be, the official said.

<HEADLINE> EU Provides Food Aid to Caucasus Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) today
allocated 67 million European currency units (ECU), or 85 million
U.S. dollars, toward food aid for the Caucasus region.
</P>
<P>
The decision, made by the European Commission, the 15-nation
regional alliance's executive arm, aimed to help the transition of
the some former Soviet republics' food sector to a market economy.
</P>
<P>
Under the aid package, Georgia would be the biggest beneficiary
with 18 million ECUs, or 23 million dollars; Azerbaijan would be
the second with 15 million ECUs, or 19.2 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Besides, Armenia would receive 13 million ECUs, or 16.5 million
dollars; Tajikistan, 9 million ECUs, or 11.5 million dollars; and
Kyrghyzstan, 10 million ECUs, or 12.8 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Active in the Caucasus region since 1994, the EU has delivered
more than 1 million tons of basic foodstuffs worth 204 million
ECUs, or 260 million dollars, under an earlier program.
</P>
<P>
The new program, according to an European Commission spokesman,
is to contribute to compliment the stabilization and adjustment
policies of the five nations involved.
</P>
<P>
Special attention would be devoted to ensuring that food aid
are in line with the countries' macro-economic and agricultural
policies, the spokesman said.

ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Ludmila Engquist of Sweden won her
first athletics gold medal at the Olympics by clocking 12.58
seconds in the women's 100-meter hurdles here tonight.
</P>
<P>
The silver and bronze were snatched seperately by Brigita
Bukovec of Slovenia in 12.59 and Patricia Girard-Leno of France in
12.65.
</P>
<P>
"I had a very poor start but was totally confident that I would
run them all down by the finish," Engquist said. "
</P>
<P>
Engquist, 32, who had completed a two-year ban early this year,
caught up Bukovec in the run-in, beating the little known hurdler
by 0.01 second.
</P>
<P>
"Before the semifinals, I didn't dare to think about a medal,
the opponents looked so strong," Bukovec said. "After running all
the rounds so well especially the last before the final, I knew
that I would be on the sunny side of the street."
</P>
<P>
Girard-Leno said she rested well for the race, "because there
was no need to strain my injured tendons any further and for the
last few days I did practically nothing."
</P>
<P>
She called herself a "late bloomeer," saying,"I have worked on
it and my dream came true."
</P>
<P>
Pre-race favorite Gail Devers of the United States, winner of
the 100 meters four days ago, was beaten into fourth in 12.66.
</P>
<P>
Devers, who entered the finals as the fourth fastest in the
semifinals, had a bad start and failed to catch up with her
rivals.

<HEADLINE> Death Toll in Jakarta Riots Does Not Reach 130: Police </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's police Wednesday
categorically denied rumors that at least 130 people were killed
in Jakarta's rioting last Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"It is not true. The number of killed people did not reach
130," the official Antara news agency today quoted Chief of the
police's information service Brigade General Nurfaizi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The rumors circulating locally suggested that 130 people be
killed in the rioting. Of the number, 90 were said to have died
at the Kramat Jati hospital and the rest at the Gatot Subroto
military hospital, said the agency.
</P>
<P>
The officially reported casualty toll of the two days of street
violence was three dead and 26 injured.
</P>
<P>
The riot followed the takeover on July 27 of the Indonesian
Democratic Party (PDI) headquarters by supporters of PDI new
leader Soerjadi from supporters of ousted PDI leader Megawati
Sukarnoputri.
</P>
<P>
The clashes, which started on Saturday at 5:30 a.m. local time,
destroyed and burned more than 22 buildings, 91 cars and two
motorcycles.
</P>
<P>
The situation in Jakarta has returned to normal on July 29 as
the security authorities were ordered to take stern actions
against rioters in the whole city.
</P>
<P>
The government has put blame on the People's Democratic Party
(PRD) for the rioting, saying the party has masterminded the
violent riots.
</P>
<P>
Found in 1994, the PRD has been blamed for many anti-government
protests and labor strikes last year. Police raided the PRD
headquarters in south Jakarta on Tuesday but found it empty.

<HEADLINE> Micro-Hydro Power Show Opens in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 1 (Xinhua) -- A three-day exhibition of
micro- hydropower stations opened here today in order to promote
small-sized rural electrification projects in this water resources
abundant country.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition of "power to rural people through micro-hydro,"
organized by the Nepal Micro-Hydro Power Development Association
(NMDA), displays hydroelectric equipment and various materials on
micro- hydropower like working models, diagrams, charts, posters
and video films.
</P>
<P>
The exhibition was aimed at bringing together local micro-hydro
manufacturers with potential buyers and policy makers especially
those from the rural areas where development of micro-hydropower
is much needed, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the NMDA, a group of local micro-hydro
manufacturers, urged the government to provide more subsidy for
rural electrification program in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to a NMDA official, the government has reduced its
micro-hydro subsidy budget by nearly 3 percent to around 300,000
US dollars for the current fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
About 1200 micro-hydro power plants ranging from one to 1,000
kilo-watt in capacity have been installed in Nepal and local
manufacturers also export micro-hydro units to a number of Asian,
African and South American countries.

<HEADLINE> Russia FM Eases Opposition to NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, August 1 (Xinhua) -- Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeni
Primakov says he could accept the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization's (NATO) eastward expansion if it did not mean a
military buildup.
</P>
<P>
"What is unacceptable is if a new military infrastructure sets
up at our borders," Primakov said in a interview with with the
French newspaper "Le Figaro."
</P>
<P>
The remarks are seen as a softening of the minister's
opposition to NATO's planned enrollment of east European nations,
which many Kremlin officials view as a grave threat to Russia's
security.
</P>
<P>
"Can you guarantee that the expansion of NATO will not result
in the installation of military infrastructure? If you tell me
yes, I, too would respond in a positive manner," he said.
</P>
<P>
But he denied that he had spoken about the subject with the
16-nation military alliance.
</P>
<P>
Primakov's comments came after he met with Russia's top
security chief Alexander Lebed last week, who told the Financial
Times he did not object NATO's eastward expansion despite heavy
opposition by other officials.

<HEADLINE> Swiss Professional Cyclist Wins Olympic Road Race </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Swiss professional cyclist Pascal
Richard outsprinted Rolf Soerensen of Denmark to win the gold
medal here today in the first men's Olympic road race that opened
to professional cyclists.
</P>
<P>
Richard and Soerensen dashed to the finish line nearly in the
same time, both clocking four hours, 53 minutes and 56 seconds,
upseting famous cyclists like Miguel Induran of Spain and Laurent
Jalabert of France.
</P>
<P>
Richard and Soerensen were closely followed by Maximilian
Sciandri of Britain, who finished two seconds behind to take the
bronze medal.
</P>
<P>
"The race started very fast, from the first kilometer," Richard
said after the race. "In the last two kilometers I was tired. I
had been attacking in the last 10 kilometers -- I had tried
several times."
</P>
<P>
Richard, who was the fifth in the grueling pro road race at the
1995 World Championships in Duitama, Colombia, charged to the
finished line after trading attacks with Soerensen and Sciandri in
the three-man lead group that broke away from the field with three
laps to go.
</P>
<P>
Richard, a 32-year-old professional cyclist who started racing
at age 15, has had over 60 victories in his professional career,
but never won a world title. His best performances in major world
competitions include a seventh finish at the 1994 Championship of
Zurich World Cup and a 13th finish at the 1995 Giro de Italia
race.
</P>
<P>
Soerensen's best results in 1995 include an eighth finish at
the Liege-Bastogne-Liege Wrold Cup in Belgium and a first place at
a stage of the Giro de Italia, where he finished the 61st overall.
</P>
<P>
"When you are in a race like that, you don't expect to win, but
you hope to win, until the last moment," Soerensen said. "I
believed that I could win until the last few meters."
</P>
<P>
Indurain, five-time winner of Tour of France, was 2:48 behind
Richard to finish the 26th and Jalabert, the dominant road cyclist
of 1995 with 24 victories, finished the 21st in 4:56:43 in the
17-lap race that covered a total distance of 221.85 kilometers.

<HEADLINE> Christopher: U.S. Plans to Veto Boutros-Ghali's Re-election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher today reiterated the U.S. government's position to
block the re-election bid of U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
Christopher made the statement during a hearing of the
International Relations Committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
"That's an irrevocable position. We are firm in it. We do
not intend to change it. We think the U.N. needs new leadership,"
Christopher said.
</P>
<P>
The Secretary said that U.S. President Bill Clinton had decided
to veto Boutros-Ghali's bid to seek a second term if necessary
because the president and his advisors believed only a new U.N.
leader would truly reform the world body.
</P>
<P>
Christopher noted that the U.S. has no candidate to replace
Boutros-Ghali and would respect Africa's argument that a new
U.N. leader should also come from Africa.
</P>
<P>
"We have to approach this in the context that Africa would have
a particular claim to this," he told the committee. "At the same
time we don't want to exclude ourselves from considering other
very good candidates."
</P>
<P>
Christopher's remarks were echoed by the U.S. Congressmen.
</P>
<P>
Lee Hamilton, Committee's senior Democrat and former chairman,
told Christopher that he believed the U.S. Congress would not
approve the payment of the U.S. debts to the United Nations until
it has a new leadership.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin to Monitor Regional Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
will personally supervise the coming regional elections in autumn,
Presidential Office Director Anatoly Chubais said today.
</P>
<P>
Chubais, designated as Yeltsin's close aide two weeks ago, said
at his first news conference that the president believed the
federal government "should by no means stay out of the regional
elections."
</P>
<P>
Chubais said Yeltsin, who is now resting at a sanatorium near
Moscow, asked the presidential office to set up a special group to
coordinate the elections which involves 46 regions, or 80 percent
of the total.
</P>
<P>
The president requested the presidential office to play a major
role in the election campaigns and to "make the most of the
experiences from the presidential election."
</P>
<P>
The regional elections start in September in the regions of
Saratov, Amur, St. Peterburg and Rostov, then spread to other
regions. The elections' outcome directly determines the shape of
the Federal Council, the upper house of the Russian Assembly.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Council approves the legislation of the State Duma
(the lower house), which is now dominated by the opposition.
</P>
<P>
In fact, Yeltsin supporters and the communists, whose leader
Gennady Zyuganov lost to Yeltsin in the July 3 presidential
elections, have started a new round of struggling by launching
campaigns for the regional polls.
</P>
<P>
Chubais said he also discussed with Yeltsin the shape of the
presidential office and the new government which was being formed
by Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin, but gave no details.
</P>
<P>
Chubais added that Yeltsin's health was good.

<HEADLINE> Riedel Hits Gold, Bubka Pulls Out on a Slow Day </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- World discus champion Lars Riedel
of Germany hit a big toss while global pole vault king Sergey
Bubka of Ukraine fell to the victim of an injury here today in the
Olympic athletics competition.
</P>
<P>
During the lacklustre day's actions, the five gold medals at
stake were split by as many athletes from different countries.
Americans got no title tonight though a packed crowd of more than
80,000 supported the local athletes vigorously.
</P>
<P>
Sweden's Ludmila Engquist claimed the women's 100m hurdles
title and Inessa Kravets of Ukraine outclassed the field to win
the women's triple jump.
</P>
<P>
The other two golds were won by Vebjoern Rodal of Norway in the
men's 800 meters and Deon Hemmings of Jamaica in the women's 400m
hurdles respectively.
</P>
<P>
Lars Riedel, third time world champion, hit his best on the
fifth round in the men's discus final with a 69.40 throw, a new
Games record, beating the second placed Vladimir Dubrovshchik of
Belarus by 2.80 meters. Vasiliy Kaptyukh, also from Belarus, wound
up third at 65.80m.
</P>
<P>
Bubka, five times world champion who set 17 world outdoor and
18 world indoor records, had to pull out of the qualifying round
due to an achilles tendon injury.
</P>
<P>
Engquist destroyed Gail Devers' second attempt at an Olympic
100m flat and hurdles double when she won the hurdles in 12.58
seconds, pipping Brigita Bukovec of Slovenia by 0.01 second.
</P>
<P>
Devers, who lost her hurdles' gold after falling over the last
obstacle at the previous Games, had a bad start and never caught
up the first two. She didn't even manage a medal as Patricia
Girard-Leno of France pipped the newly-crown 100m winner by a
nose.
</P>
<P>
Another American star who had her name tarnished was Kim
Batten, the world record holder in the longer hurdles. Hemmings,
who ranked fifth in the world last year, rose at the big occasion
to beat Batten soundly.
</P>
<P>
The Jamaica hit the tape in a new Games record time of 52.82
seconds. Batten was timed in 53.08 to her teammate Tonja
Buford-Bailey's 53.22.
</P>
<P>
Kravets, world record holder and world champion last year,
produced the second best jump in history to win the triple jump at
15.33m, leaving Inna Lasovskaya of Russia and Sarka Kasparkova of
the Czech Republic way off to fight for the silver.
</P>
<P>
The pair landed their best jump both at 14.98m, but it was the
Russian who placed second.
</P>
<P>
The men's 800 meters final was won by world championship bronze
medalist Vebjorn Rodal of Norway with a new Games record, clocking
of 1:42.59. It is the first gold for Norway at the current Games.
</P>
<P>
Hezekiel Sepeng won the first ever silver for South Africa in
the Olymic history and shattered the national record at 1:42.74.
</P>
<P>
"This is very, very important for me and for all South
Africans, for the country and athletics," he said after the race.
</P>
<P>
Kenya's Fred Onyancha took the third position in 1:42.79.
</P>
<P>
The day also witnessed that Dan O'Brien of the United States
led the first day of the decethlon with a 4,592 total. The three
times world champion led German Frank Busemann by 124 points after
five events.
</P>
<P>
There are four golds up for grab tomorrow.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The International Federation of
Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC) has decided to provide
nearly 200,000 US dollars to support flood relief activities in
Nepal.
</P>
<P>
According to IFRC country representative Gert Venghaus here,
the amount would be used for urgent purchase of shelter material,
cooking utensils, blankets and clothing.
</P>
<P>
The International Red Cross relief will be distributed through
Nepal Red Cross Society, he said.
</P>
<P>
Following severe flooding in different parts of the country
earlier last month, local Nepal red cross branches in these areas
are already involved in providing relief assistance to
flood-affected people.
</P>
<P>
Floods and landslides caused by incessant monsoon rains in July
in various districts in Nepal have so far killed over 150 people
and rendered thousands more homeless.
</P>
<P>
It was learned that the International Red Cross Society would
also provide some buffer stocks of relief materials, fearing that
continued monsoon may still cause more severe damage.

first Chinese diver to bag home two gold medals when she outwitted
her rivals in the women's three-meter springboard event Wednesday
evening.
</P>
<P>
This was a feat that had never been achieved by the Chinese

Early, Fu Mingxiao retained her Olympic crown by winning the

After first two dives, Ilyina slipped down far away with her
rigid routines while the Chinese fully displayed her talents with
difficult but perfect dives.
</P>
<P>
Under strong challenge from the Chinese diver, Lashko lost her
stamina in the semifinals and had to settle for the silver medal
by lagging behind 35.49 points.

with only 14 points scored in the next 10 minutes before Ukraine
surged ahead 23-15 with 2:30 left.
</P>
<P>
However, Italy made its hunt with a 7-0 run to cut it 23-22,
capped by a three-pointer by Catarina Pollini at 0:36.
</P>
<P>
Ukraine ended the first half 25-22 on a basket from Lyudmila
Nazarenko.
</P>
<P>
With better rebounds and defence, Ukraine dominated the second
half all the way to a 58-37 comfortable lead with 3:20 minutes to
go.
</P>
<P>
The Italian launched out a 10-0 rally in the final minutes but
that was not enough to overcome the huge deficit.
</P>
<P>
Nazarenko led Ukraine with 16 points and Yelena Zhirko added 15
and a game-high 15 rebounds. Italy's top scorer was Catarina
Pollini with 13.
</P>
<P>
Later on, world champions Brazil was paced by Hortencia Oliva

<HEADLINE> Thai Stock Market Index Further Plummets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, August 1 (Xinhua) -- The Stock Exchange of Thailand
(SET) index hit a record low on Wednesday since October 6, 1993,
falling 32.98 points to 1,064.04.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors were active net sellers, while local players'
sales were substantial.
</P>
<P>
A total of 76.8 million shares worth five billion baht (200
million US dollars) changed hands, compared with 46.9 million
shares worth 3.2 billion baht (128 million dollars) on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The bourse was closed on Tuesday for a Buddhist holiday.
</P>
<P>
The three most affected sectors on Wednesday in terms of price
were finance and securities (down 7.09 percent), building
materials (down 3.61 percent), and property (down 3.60 percent).
</P>
<P>
The SET index since January has fallen 259.39 points, or 19.60
percent.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have been selling Thai securities for two
months, with total net sales of 5 billion baht (200 million
dollars) in June and 8 billion baht (320 million dollars) in July.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of the year, foreigners were net
buyers to the tune of nearly 60 billion baht (2.4 billion
dollars).
</P>
<P>
With the Banharn government completing its one year in office
last month, there has been a widespread negative mood about the
government.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts and local press say that the government has
no long-term strategy for economic progress.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of this year, economic growth in several
sectors, including exports and property, fell short of
projections, while current account deficit and inflation remained
high.
</P>
<P>
Many listed companies showed poor performance during the six
months, further weakening investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, key figures in charge of economic affairs, including
Deputy Prime Minister Amnuay Virawan, Finance Minister Bodi
Chunnananda and Bank of Thailand Governor Rerngchai Marakanond,
held a meeting to work out measures to revive the economy and
tackle problems at their roots.

<HEADLINE> Court to Meet Again on Russian Doping Appeal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The tribunal of the Court of
Arbitration for Sport (CAS) hearing a Russian appeal to have two
Olympic medalists caught of doping cheats reinstated will meet
again on Friday in efforts to reach a decision.
</P>
<P>
Jean-Philippe Rochat, secretary general of the CAS said the
court had been unable to reach a decision on the doping cases of
200 meters breaststroke swimmer Andrei Korneyev and wrestler Zafar
Guliyev. Both won bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
They were among four athletes who have tested positive for the
stimulant-cum-masking drug bromantan, which the International
Olympic Committee (IOC) said had an effect similar to that of
mescarb, a drug detected in the past.
</P>
<P>
The Russians argue bromantan is not on the IOC's list of banned
substances and is not the same as mesocarb. They have asked for
other expert opinion and has requested for other documents to be
provided by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
Ahthough a decision might be reached on Friday but the court
official did not rule out the possibility that a decision be taken
before the end of the Games on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
A second Russian swimmer, Nina Zhivanevskaya, and Lithuanian
cyclist Rita Razmaite, none of them medalists, were also
disqualified by the IOC.
</P>
<P>
Zhivanevskaya finished eighth and last in the women's 200
meters backstroke final.
</P>
<P>
The International Swimming Federation (FINA) annulled her
competition result as well as that of Korneyev. Britain's Nick
Gillingham, fourth behind Korneyev, was awarded the bronze medal.

ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) - Rapidly rising Spain and the
Netherlands will meet in Friday's final of the Olympic field
hockey tournament after beating both of the 1992 finalists in
their semifinal matches on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Neither country has won the Olympic gold before. The

Spain scored a 2-1 win over Australia, the silver medallists in
Barcelona four years ago.
</P>

Taco van den Honert hammered in a superb hat-trick to propel
the Netherlands to a 3-1 win over defending Olympic champions
Germany.
</P>
<P>
The Spaniards have been the surprise team of the Atlanta Games.
Only a year ago they were just eighth in the European championship
but have made rapid progress under new coach Antonio Forrellat.
</P>

<P>
MADRID, July 31 (Xinhua) -- A bomb blast rocked a Citroen
Dealership today in northeastern Spain, injuring two, including
one in critical condition, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
A package which had been left in front of the French car
dealership in Calatayud, 250 kilometers northeast of Madrid,
exploded shortly after car dealer Herminio Ibanez Herrero,
accompanied by his son Sergio, took it inside.
</P>
<P>
Surgeons were operating on the car dealer who suffered horrific
stomach and hand wounds. His son was slightly injured.
</P>
<P>
Local police said they got no tip-off before the blast.
</P>
<P>
Nobody claimed responsibility for the attack, but police said
the Basque separatist group ETA, which is fighting for an
independent homeland in northern Spain, was the prime suspect.
</P>
<P>
Also in the day, Basque police said petrol bombs were hurled at
a Peugeot car dealership in Zamudio, in the Basque region,
destroying six cars and a building, but no one was hurt.

<HEADLINE> China Guards Against Bacteria Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China is on alert for an outbreak
of the O-157 strain of colon bacillus that is now ravaging parts
of Japan, reported today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
That the bacteria has struck 36 Japanese cities in the last two
months, killing seven and making more than 8,600 people ill in the
worst outbreak of food poisoning in the country in the last
half-century.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Ministry of Public Health is asking local health
inspection departments to tighten up surveillance to prevent food
poisoning.
</P>
<P>
Any case with symptoms like the O-157 bacteria must be reported
to the ministry immediately and stool samples must be sent for
testing to the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, said Kan
Xuegui, department director in charge of health inspection under
the Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
So far, no cases of O-157 have been reported in China, Kan said.
</P>
<P>
The bacteria was first detected in the United States in 1982,
and since then outbreaks have been reported in many countries
including Britain, Canada and Australia.
</P>
<P>
An outbreak in the United States in 1993 involved more than 700
people.
</P>
<P>
The bacteria usually live in the intestines of animals and will
not be killed by temperatures of less than 80 degrees centigrade.
</P>
<P>
Patients attacked by O-157 suffer nausea, stomach pains, and
diarrhoea. Serious cases may affect the cranial nerve and damage
the kidney, and even cause death.
</P>
<P>
Symptoms usually appear three or five days after infection.
</P>
<P>
China first reported O-157 bacteria nine years ago, and since
then scattered cases have been registered in Jiangsu, Beijing,
Shandong and Xinjiang.
</P>
<P>
Medical experts believe that Chinese people's eating habits and
cooking methods have helped prevent outbreaks of the bacteria.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine has developed
advanced diagnostic tests and carried out national surveillance to
keep tabs on cases.

<HEADLINE> New NATO Force Leader Takes Over IFOR Command </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 31 (Xinhua) -- American admiral Joseph Lopez took
over NATO's southern command and the NATO-led peace Implementation
Force (IFOR) in Bosnia today from his predecessor, Admiral
Leighton Smith.
</P>
<P>
The command change came 44 days before the former Yugoslav
republic's first free elections.
</P>
<P>
After assuming power at the NATO base in Naples, Lopez, a
former top Navy planner at the Pentagon, said the IFOR troops
would continue to carry out its mandate under the Dayton peace
accord, but this did not include pursuing the Bosnian Serb leaders
indicted as war criminals.
</P>
<P>
The 56-year-old admiral said he was confident about the
progress of the peace process and the polls in September 14 would
be a "crucial moment".
</P>
<P>
The NATO force "will offer its support to all the organizations
involved" in the coming elections, Lopez said. He was to leave
for Sarajevo this afternoon for a round of consultations with his
subordinates.
</P>
<P>
In the hand-over ceremony, NATO Secretary General Javier Solana
praised Smith for bringing peace to former Yugoslavia. During his
two-year term, the American admiral planned and successfully
carried out the NATO-led peacekeeping deployment in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Solana said the current "Joint Endeavor" operation in Bosnia
was the most complex in Europe since World War II. It included
the major step of the elections of a collective presidency,
legislature and local councils.

<HEADLINE> Tudjman to Visit U.S. on Bosnia's Muslim-Croat Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZAGREB, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Croatian President Franjo Tudjman
will visit Washington on Thursday for talks on the thorny issue of
Muslim-Croat relations in Bosnia, the Croatian presidential office
said today.
</P>
<P>
Tudjman will meet U.S. president Bill Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore to discuss "the promotion of overall bilateral
relations and the implementation of the Dayton and Washington
agreements," the office said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Tudjman held talks with Bosnian Vice President
Ejup Ganic on Croat-Muslim tensions in the divided city of Mostar
in southern Bosnia following municipal elections there on June 30.
</P>
<P>
Ganic, accompanied by U.S. ambassadors to Bosnia and Croatia as
well as international mediator Michael Steiner, was trying to
solicit Croatia's help in pressing Mostar's Croats to accept the
results of the elections.
</P>
<P>
The Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ) in Mostar has boycotted the
city's new council on the grounds that there were "irregularities"
in the poll in which it lost to a Muslim coalition.
</P>
<P>
But the European Union, which organized the elections, ruled
that the alleged "irregularities" were too insignificant to affect
the outcome.
</P>
<P>
Ganic, a Muslim, also wanted Tudjman to pressure the Bosnian
Croats to dissolve their self-proclaimed mini-state, "the Croatian
Republic of Herzeg-Bosnia," in line with the Dayton peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
But the talks ended without any specific agreement, according
to Bosnian officials.
</P>
<P>
However, after the meeting a statement issued by the Croatian
Defense and National Security Council said that it was willing to
reach a temporary compromise on the Mostar issue within the
framework of Bosnian Federation institutions even though "there
had undoubtedly been legal errors and manipulations in the
(Mostar) election results".
</P>
<P>
The Council also welcomed a plan by members of the mini-state's
House of Representatives to transform the self-styled republic of
Herzeg-Bosnia into a "political community of the Croatian people,"
although the precise meaning of this is not clear.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear how fast any "transformation" will take
place. Bosnian Croats have previously pledged to abolish their
republic, but so far these promises have come to nothing because
of disputes between the Croats and Muslims on their loosely-linked
Muslim-Croat federation.

<HEADLINE> Italian Lower House to Vote for PM's Spending Cuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Italian Prime Minister Romano Prodi's
center-left government today won a vote of confidence called to
hasten passage of spending cuts through Parliament.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said a filibuster by a
secession-advocating regional party forced Prodi to resort to
confidence votes to hasten passage of the cuts.
</P>
<P>
The vote, at the Chamber of Deputies, was aimed at removing 150
amendments that would have slowed the measure's passage. It was
the government's first vote of confidence since it won approval to
take office in May.
</P>
<P>
A second vote expected on Augest 1 in the lower chamber will
deal with the actual package of revenue-raising measures and
spending cuts to trim 16 trillion lire (about 10.6 billion
U.S. dollars) which have been approved by the Senate.
</P>
<P>
Communists, who are outside Prodi's center-left coalition, have
assured Prodi they would back the confidence votes, giving him the
majority he needs in the lower house.

<P>
BANGKOK, August 1 (Xinhua) -- US President Bill Clinton is to
pay an official visit to Thailand in November, the first by an
American president in 27 years, according to local newspaper
Bangkok Post today.
</P>
<P>
The visit will take place before or after Clinton attends a
summit of leaders of the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Forum,
which is due to take place at Subic Bay, the Philippines, on
November 25.
</P>
<P>
Clinton will be in Thailand as a guest of Thai Prime Minister
Banharn Silpa-Archa, an informed source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is coming to Thailand at an invitation extended in 1993
by the then prime minister Chuan Leepai during his visit to
Washington.
</P>
<P>
The last US president to visit Thailand was Richard Nixon in
1969.
</P>
<P>
The US president's planned trip to Thailand is seen as a bid by
him to underline his policy for stronger links with countries in
the Asia-Pacific region, as well as an opportunity for the US and
Thailand to build stronger ties.

<P>
BUENOS AIRES, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Police have broken up a major
drug trafficking ring, arresting its 10 members and seizing 150
kilograms of cocaine.
</P>
<P>
Benito Felipe Laguna, the chief of the trauma ward of the Ramos
Mejia Hospital in the capital and one of the ring leaders, was
arrested on Tuesday with another member of the ring after being
caught selling 30 kilograms of cocaine a few meters away from the
hospital.
</P>
<P>
Shortly afterwards, the other 120 kilograms of cocaine were
seized in a warehouse in Monte Chingolo, south of Buenos
Aires.
</P>
<P>
The police said the ring brought in the drugs from Bolivia,
hid it in the warehouse and then sold it in the capital.
</P>
<P>
This is the most important anti-drug operation launched
so far this year and the fourth most important in the country's
history.

<HEADLINE> French FM on Visit to Algeria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign Minister Herve de
Charette left here today for Algeria, in a bid to shore up
diplomatic and business ties with the troubled north African
country where civil war has killed 60,000 people.
</P>
<P>
The French government said De Charette's visit to the former
colony showed the "normalization" of relations between the two
countries who are important trade and investment partners.
</P>
<P>
De Charette, whose visit comes a year after a wave of deadly
bomb attacks in France that were blamed on Algerian militants,
said he was traveling "with the wish, the goal, the desire to
re-establish solid working and friendly relationships between us."
</P>
<P>
But France's support for Algeria's military-backed government
has brought strong protests from Islamic fundamentalists who have
carried out attacks against the French in Algeria and on French soil
as part of their struggle against the government.
</P>
<P>
A bomb exploded in a Paris subway on July 25, 1995, killing
eight people and wounding dozens. That attack and a half-dozen
other explosions that injured scores of people were blamed by the
French government on the Armed Islamic Group.
</P>
<P>
De Charette began his two-day visit at the invitation of his
Algerian counterpart Ahmed Attaf, and will discuss with him
anti-terrorist measures.
</P>
<P>
He may also sign a financial protocol that will renew French
lines of credit to Algeria of about five billion francs (one
billion U.S. dollars) to finance purchases of French products,
which account for a quarter of Algerian imports.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers will also discuss a summit between French
President Jacques Chirac and Algerian President Liamine Zeroual.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of the two presidents was scheduled for last October,
but was cancelled after Algerian officials complained about some
French statements as interfering in Algerian affairs.

<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Some 25 workers were contaminated
by an accident in an Iranian nuclear power station, the
International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) confirmed today.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the Vienna-based U.N. specialized agency said
that the contamination source was a radioactive machine, which had
been discarded earlier and re-discovered by an engineer working
at a conventional power station in Racht, in northern Iran.
</P>
<P>
The engineer brought the machine to an area with 50 workers
without taking any precautions, resulting in half of the workers
being contaminated.
</P>
<P>
There was an earlier report of the accident in a Tehran
newspaper, which claimed that at least 50 workers and engineers
from Siemens had been contaminated.
</P>
<P>
But the German company denied the report, saying no Siemens
engineer in the Racht power station had been affected.
</P>
<P>
An anonymous official from Iran's power ministry acknowledged
the accident but reduced the number of people contaminated to
one.

period--that is, through to about Dec. 20--but we do not have any
plans beyond that," Christopher said. He was testifying before the
International Relations Committee of the U.S. House of
Representatives.
</P>
<P>
The remarks sparked new speculations about the future mission
of the U.S. troops in the war-torn former Yugoslav republic.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Defense Secretary William Perry told reporters last month
that he would recommended to President Bill Clinton that some
Americans stayed on in Bosnia after their planned year-end
withdrawal date.
</P>
<P>
But U.S. Vice President Al Gore earlier this month denied any
longer stay of the U.S. forces in Bosnia. He stressed that the
U.S.-led NATO peacekeeping troops could complete their mission at
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
Some U.S. Congressmen including senior Democrats have joined
European political and military officials in calling on Clinton to
keep some American peacekeeping troops in Bosnia beyond the
planned withdrawal date.
</P>
<P>
They have warned that armed clashes might erupt after the NATO
peacekeeping forces leave Bosnia.

<HEADLINE> Kravets Jumps to World's Second Longest Jump </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Inessa Kravets of Ukraine produced
the second-longest women's triple jump in history on her way to
win her first Olympic gold medal at the Atlanta Games on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
After struggling to dominate the competition in the early
rounds, the world record holder produced a superb fifth effort of
15.33 meters to win the competition.
</P>
<P>
Russian Inna Lasovskaya took the silver medal and the bronze
went to Sarka Kasparkova of the Czech republic. Both women jumped
14.98 meters but the Russian was placed ahead because her second
jump of 14.70 was just one centimeter longer than her rival's.
</P>
<P>
Kravets, who won the silver medal at the 1992 Barcelona Games,
is the only women to have jumped further when she registered her
world record of 15.50 meters to win the world title in Gothenburg
last year.

<HEADLINE> Amazon Jungle Threatened by Forestry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The amazon jungle is being
threatened by the over-logging of mahogany and virola, two
highly-valued exotic woods, the Brazilian Environmental and
Renewable Natural Resources Institute said today.
</P>
<P>
The area deforested in the Amazon region between 1992-95 was 10
times the size of Brasilia, the capital of Brazil, a report of the
institute said.
</P>
<P>
To avert the destruction of the Amazon, the Brazilian
government cancelled for a two year period new logging plans for
removing the two types of wood, and revoked any irregular projects.
</P>
<P>
The government is also reviewing investments being made by
Malaysian timber companies in the Amazon region.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, the Amazon lost 11,130 square kilometers of forests
and the figure increased to 14,900 square kilometers after
1992. Between 1992-95, the total area deforested in the region
reached 59,380 square kilometers.

<HEADLINE> NATO Starts to Withdraw Heavy Weapons From Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The NATO-led peace Implementation
Force (IFOR) in Bosnia has started to pull out some of its heavy
weaponry and replace it with light and mobile armaments, an IFOR
spokesman said here today.
</P>
<P>
A U.S. army multiple launch rocket system unit was the first to
be withdrawn and for the next few weeks some 300 tanks and Bradley
armored personnel carriers also will return to NATO bases in
Germany, Major Brett Boudreau said.
</P>
<P>
They are to be replaced by soldiers and 200 so-called Humvee
all-terrain vehicles from U.S. military police battalions.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of military hardware is in response to IFOR's
calls for help in carrying out the civilian part of the Dayton
peace accord which ended the nearly four-year war in Bosnia,
Boudreau said.
</P>
<P>
The heavily-armed IFOR, which came to Bosnia last December has
succeeded in implementing the military part of the Dayton accord,
whose centerpiece was to separate Bosnia's three former warring
factions - the Serbs, Croats and Muslims.
</P>
<P>
With that now mainly completed and the weapons of the
three sides safely in storage, the biggest part of IFOR's task is
complete. Consequently, NATO is changing its currently
50,000-strong force to a lighter and more mobile operation.
</P>
<P>
IFOR's main task now is to provide security and greater
mobility for the civilian population to prepare for the first
Bosnia-wide post-war election.
</P>
<P>
But while the military side of the Dayton peace agreement may
have been a success, civilian issues, such as freedom of movement,
return of refugees and the elections, have been haunting the
international community which is trying to prevent the war from
re-starting and return the devastated country to normal.

<HEADLINE> China Sweeps Olympic Table Tennis Titles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Liu Guoliang and Wang Tao split
the men's singles final spots Wednesday night, assuring China's
fourth Olympic table tennis gold medal.
</P>
<P>
The 20-year-old Liu, fast-attacker in the penholding style,
downed aggressive German Joerg Rosskopf 21-17, 18-21, 21-18,
21-18, while world number two Wang Tao ended the giant-killing
spree of Czech Petr Korbel, winning 23-21, 21-7, 21-16.
</P>
<P>
Liu, the sixth-ranked player, who combined with world number
one Kong Linhui to win the men's doubles title on Tuesday, got the
first set with well-angled flat shots and killing forehands.
</P>
<P>
The fifth-ranked German then put up more aggressive game to
lead all the way in the second set. A lightning counter-attack
put Rosskopf 1-1.
</P>
<P>
In the following two sets, Liu used his wickedly spinning
serves to unnerve the German, who had made a lot of offensive
errors.
</P>
<P>
In the World Cup held in France last year, Rosskopf had nipped
Liu 3-2 where he even let the Chinese get only five points in the
deciding set.
</P>
<P>
"I have used all my weapons in the arsenal," Liu said. "I am on
the same level with him. He just played too aggressive and made
too many errors."
</P>
<P>
Wang, known for coming into form slowly, saved five set points
to win the first set. He then gave no chance to Korbel, who had
upset 1993 world champion Jean-Philippe Gatien of France and 1992
Olympic champion Jan-Ove Waldner in the Olympic tourney.
</P>
<P>
"I didn't worry about him even trailing 15-20," Wang said. "I
had beaten him in all four encounters."
</P>
<P>
Defending champion and world top women player Deng Yaping edged
out 1988 Olympic champion Chen Jing in a gruelling five-set
women's singles final to win her fourth Olympic title Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Deng repeated her singles-doubles glory in the Barcelona Games
after beating Chen, a former Chinese national team member who now
represents Chinese Taipei, 21-14, 21-17, 20-22, 17-21, 21-5.
</P>
<P>
"That's normal that Deng and Chen, both trained by the Chinese
national team, finished one-two," said Chinese vice sports
minister Xu Yinsheng, also the President of the International
Table Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
"Both had played to their best," Xu said. "In the deciding
game, Deng overwhelmed Chen by more aggressive play."
</P>
<P>
Deng's killing forehands worked today as she won half of her
points by forehand. Chen won 35 percent of her points by
forehand.
</P>
<P>
In the first two sets, Deng used her long-pimpled backhand,
which can produce funny spin with different flick of wrist, to
push Chen into defence and then got the kills.
</P>
<P>
Chen got used to Deng's play and made her rival off balance
with well-placed shots.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Chen saved a match point to take the third set
and jumped into a 20-14 lead in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
After Deng made an serve error, the two entered a tie-breaking
fifth set.
</P>
<P>
The highly motivated Deng didn't give any chance to Chen in the
final set. She pumped her fist into the air every time when she
scored one point.

<HEADLINE> Russia Upset by Australia in Women's Basketball </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Inspired by their men's team's
surprising win over Croatia, the Australian women's team pulled
out the second upset in the Olympic Basketball event Wednesday,
beating Russia 74-70 in overtime to reach the semifinals.
</P>
<P>
In Saturday's semifinals, Australia will take on the hosts
United States which downed Japan earlier in the day with a 108-93
win behind Lissa Leslie's 35 points.
</P>
<P>
By advancing to the semifinals, Australia has matched its
best-ever finish in Olympic Games. The Aussies was placed fourth
at the 1988 Olympics in Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Russia, which won the Barcelona Games gold medal under the name
of the Unified Team, will meet Japan in the playoffs for the 5th
to 8th places on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Russia started the game with a 13-9 lead and was running ahead
27-25 with five munites in the first half before the Aussies tied
it 38-38 at the interval.
</P>
<P>
The Russians would build a seven-point lead twice, 47-40 and
49-42, in the second half before Jennifer Whittle's jumper put
Australia ahead 55-54.
</P>
<P>
Australia played a fast game against their taller rivals and
the two sides exchanged the lead twice before an inside baskets
and a free throw by Michelle Brogan gave the Aussies a 64-62 lead
with 1:59 left.
</P>
<P>
Yelena Baranova connected on a jump shot just in the side of
the free throw line to tie the score 64-all with 18 seconds left.
Australian center Rachael Sporn missed her shot and the game went
into overtime.
</P>
<P>
The overtime opened with lead changes before Whittle converted
a three-point play to lift Australia to 71-68. But the Russians
closed the margin to 71-70 on an Australian turnover.
</P>
<P>
With 39 seconds left, Brogan sank two free throws and Sandy
Brondello made one of her two shot on the line with 2.4 second
remaining to seal the win.
</P>
<P>
"We weren't scared of going to overtime. Defensively we did a
super job stopping Russia. We've got a lot of depth," said
Australian coach Tom Maher after the game.
</P>
<P>
Russia's coach Vadim Kappanov said it was the referees who cost
his team's defeat.
</P>
<P>
"The referees played a major role in the outcome of the game.
When the referees intervene, it makes the game more difficult.
There were 23 fouls called against us and only 13 against
Australia," Kappanov said.
</P>
<P>
"I'm professional player and a professional coach and I can
tell you that if one side has 10 more fouls than the other, it is
unfair," he added.
</P>
<P>
Brogan led all players in the contest with 17 points and eight
rebounds for Australia while Nikonova paced Russia with 16 points
and Baranova added 13 and grabbed a game high 21 rebounds.

medal easily here tonight in the Olympic athletics competition.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old unleashed a 69.40 meter mighty toss to set a

<HEADLINE> Colombian President Rules out Isolation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Colombian President Ernest Samper
is ruling out the isolation of his country following the
revocation of his United States visa on July 11.
</P>
<P>
Quite to the contrary, he said, Colombia had since received
demonstrations of solidarity.
</P>
<P>
Samper made his statement Tuesday night in Venezuela during a
stopover on his trip to France where he will meet with his French
counterpart Jacques Chirac and then go to Spain.
</P>
<P>
"We have received profound solidarity from the members of the
Rio Group and the non-aligned countries. We have not felt as much
solidarity as we do now," the president said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government revoked the visa of the Colombian president
on July 11 after claiming he received money from the Cali drug
cartel during his 1994 presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
Samper, who is president of the non-aligned movement countries,
was received by Venezuelan Foreign Minister Miguel Angel Burelli
Rivas, at the Caracas International Airport.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian president had a brief telephone conversation with
Venezuelan President Rafael Calera who reiterated "feelings of
friendship and fraternity."
</P>
<P>
Samper reaffirmed that the war against drugs "is a global war;
not just Colombia's" and said that his country "is a victim, not
the executioner" of this war.
</P>
<P>
"We want less pressure and more cooperation." He expressed
concern that the state of relations with the United States could
destroy a structure the two had been building for 15 years.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that Colombia would continue to eradicate the
scourge of drugs, with or without help from the United States.
</P>
<P>
Of the postponement of his meeting with Caldera, Samper said it
had been agreed upon by both governments during a visit of the
Colombian foreign minister to Caracas this week.
</P>
<P>
Samper repeated his invitation to Caldera to visit Colombia so
that they "can resume their relations of good neighbors and
continue working on the development of border relations and trade
and cultural agreements."

<HEADLINE> Mexican Congress Condemns Terrorist Acts in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MEXICO CITY, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The Mexican congress today
condemned the acts of terrorism in Atlanta, the site of this
year's Olympic Games, over the past few days.
</P>
<P>
Legislators from the four main political parties in the country
expressed their solidarity with the people of the United States.
</P>
<P>
They said that the terrorist attacks in Atlanta "offend the
conscience and the shared, essential values that we have always
defended," and were an affront to humanity and the civilized
co-existence of the whole world.
</P>
<P>
In a document signed by congressional leader Fernando Ortiz
Arana, the congress said that terrorism, of domestic or
international origin, crushes the spirit of the law, erodes the
basis of co-existence, sows terror and discourages citizens from
reaching the collective goals they have set.
</P>
<P>
It said acts of terrorism can never be a legitimate political
means nor the expression of demands and grievances, apart from the
fact that, due to its irrational nature, they threaten social
cohesion by provoking extremist reactions which undermine
tolerance and respect for diversity.
</P>
<P>
On July 27, a home-made pipe bomb exploded in Atlanta's
Centennial Olympic Park during a rock concert, killing two people
and injuring 120. The following day, police destroyed under
controlled conditions another device found in a shopping mall.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Win Olympic Women's Archery title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- South Korea won the women's
Olympic archery gold medal for the third successive Games when Kim
Kyung-Wook produced a series of superb performances in the final
held at the Stone Mmountains Park, just outside Atlanta, on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The 1993 Asian Cup winner beat 19-year-old He Ying of China by
by four points, 113-107, in the final.
</P>
<P>
In the gold medal match, Kim and He, only the second women's
archer from China to win an individual medal, both had 10s on
their opening shots.
</P>
<P>
Olena Sadovnycha of Ukraine beat world number two Elif
Altinkaynak of Turkey 109-102 to take the bronze.
</P>
<P>
Kim beat China's Wang Xiaozhu, who had beaten her in the
Atlanta Grand Prix final in April, 106-103 in the quarter-finals,
and Sadovnycha 111-109 in the semis.
</P>
<P>
He Ying trounced 1995 world championship silver medalist
Barbara Mensing of Germany 103-93 in the quarter-finals and
Altinkaynak by one shot in the semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
Mensing had knocked out 1992 Olympic bronze medal winner and
1995 world champion Natalia Valeeva of Moldova in the third round.
</P>
<P>
Kim had six 10s, two of them hit dead center on the target, and
five 9s to beat China's He Ying 113-107 in the gold meal match.
</P>
<P>
"When I got 10 (on my first shot), I got the image of 10 in my
mind and it lasted throughout the competition. I had real
confidence out of it in my mind," said Kim after the victory.
</P>
<P>
Since 1984, South Korea has won eight of the 12 medals and all
the four golds on offer in women's individual archery. It also
has won the women's team titles in the 1984 and 1988 Games.
</P>
<P>
And it was a worthy compensation for Kim for her failed efforts
at the last two Games.
</P>
<P>
"`This is my first time in the Olympics. If I can perform this
well, I'm happy," said the 19-year-old He.
</P>
<P>
"This could be taken as a failure. But I will continue making
efforts and someday I could surely beat them (South Koreans)," she
said.
</P>
<P>
And this would by no means affect her team's efforts in the
team competition, she added.

<HEADLINE> Hurricane Cesar Leaves 26 Dead, 30 Missing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Costa Rican President Jose Maria
Figueres today saw at first hand the devastation caused by
Hurricane Cesar which swept the country over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
"The damage is much more severe than one could imagine," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Hurricane Cesar, which brought torrential rain to many parts of
the Caribbean island, left at least 26 dead, 30 missing and caused
damage to property estimated at some 95 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
But the president stressed the victims should not expect a
great deal of help from the international community to cope with
the situation.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people are still trapped in the south, which was
worst hit by the floods and landslides which followed.
</P>
<P>
In some places, food, drinking water and fuel are running out
as it is impossible to supply them by land.
</P>
<P>
The pan-American highway which connects the southern part of
the country with Panama has been washed away in several places and
will take at least two months to repair. Alternative highways are
also useless because the rains destroyed dozens of bridges and
country roads.
</P>
<P>
Costa Rican sanitary authorities cautioned that an epidemic of
malaria or cholera could break out when water levels drop, but
added they will take emergency measures in the areas most
affected.

points to lead Australia for a 74-70 win over Russia, booking its

</P>
<P>
The silver and bronze were snatched separately by Brigita

<P>
World champion Devers, who entered the final as the fourth
fastest in the semifinals, had a bad start, and failed to catch up
her rivals with her brilliant speed.
</P>
<P>
It was the second failure for the 30-year-old who lost her gold
due to a fall in the final of the Barcelona Games in 1992.
</P>

<HEADLINE> China's Wide Use Of Remote Sensing Technology In Agriculture </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, August 1 (Xinhua) -- China has been using remote
sensing technology to study its agricultural resources, make crop
yield estimates, study droughts, floods, and other disasters, and
monitor pasture resources and fishing.
</P>
<P>
The country has established seven regional remote sensing
centers for these purposes, and plans to build these, along with
30 provincial-level centers, into a nationwide monitoring system
using space and remote sensing technology with its ground
monitoring stations.
</P>
<P>
With the arrival of a socialist market economics, control of
national resources and their development can mean a more rational
distribution of resources and productive forces for sound economic
development.
</P>
<P>
With U.S. satellite data, Chinese scientists have analyzed
China's total area in 15 categories, such as cultivated land,
forests, pastures, residential areas, factories, mines, roads,
lakes, and deserts, using the statistics for development plans.
</P>
<P>
For water and soil conservation projects, Ministry of Water
Resources has studied soil erosion and drawn up charts to analyze
it. Areas such as Chengdu, Harbin, and Nanjing have used the
sensing technology for rice yield estimates.
</P>
<P>
Aided by Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Aerospace
Industry, the Institute of Grasslands of the Chinese Academy of
Agricultural Sciences set up the North China Remote Sensing Center
for Pasture Resources Monitoring, providing information on grass
yields and the effects of fire and snow.
</P>
<P>
The country has plans to launch a resource satellite around the
year 2000 and build a nationwide agricultural resource analytic
system that uses remote sensing technology.

<HEADLINE> All Suspected War Criminals to Face Trial: Serbs, U.N. Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations war crimes
tribunal and Bosnian Serbs have agreed to cooperate to bring all
suspected war criminals to trial regardless of their ethnic
background, said a joint statement released today.
</P>
<P>
Prosecuting those suspected of committing atrocities in the
three-and-a-half-year Bosnian conflict "is essential...for the
creation of a lasting peace in the region," said the joint
statement issued by the Serbs and the International Criminal
Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY).
</P>
<P>
According to the document, both sides have agreed to cooperate
to bring all such perpetrators to justice, "both before the
tribunal and the national courts, in an unbiased and professional
manner," ensuring that all criminals receive a fair trial.
</P>
<P>
In the past, the international community has repeatedly accused
the Bosnian Serbs of refusing to hand over war crimes suspects to
the court.
</P>
<P>
The statement was released after talks between ICTY officials
and a Serb delegation led by Serb Justice Minister Marko Arsovic.
</P>
<P>
During the two days of talks the Serbs also urged ICTY
officials to step up investigations into cases involving Serb
victims.
</P>
<P>
Of 75 suspected war criminals indicted by the U.N. court, more
than 50 are Serbs, a numerical imbalance which has prompted
widespread Serb scorn for the The Hague-based court.
</P>
<P>
The Serbs urged prosecutors to investigate several mass grave
sites and open a liaison office in the northeastern town of
Bijeljina to facilitate further investigations.

</P>
<P>
Hemmings, bronze medalist at last year's world championships,

<P>
Batten, who set the world record of 52.61 at the world
championships last year, was the pre-race favourite, came off from
the final curve second behind Hemmings. She tried to catch up the
winner on the home stretch, but only found she had no more
strength left.
</P>
<P>
Buford-Bailey, silver medalist at last year's world

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Spain continued its giant-killing
streak when it reached the finals of the men's hockey Olympic
tournament here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Spain, who finished eighth in the European Championship last
year, produced a shocking 2-1 victory against Australia this
evening, the lost finalists in the Barcelona Games four years ago.
</P>
<P>
This was the first time in 16 years for Spain to enter the
Olympic final, and only the second victory in their previous 30
meets against Australia.
</P>
<P>
After a scoreless first session, Victor Pujol scored the first
goal from a goalmouth melee in the 49th minute, with Juan Escarre
netting anew five minutes later to pace Spain for a comfortable
2-0 advantage.
</P>
<P>
In the 63rd minute, Paul Gaudoin pulled one back for Australia
from a penalty corner push, but Australia was unable to score the
equaliser to prevent Spain from entering the gold-medal battle on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
En route to their outings to the semifinals, Spain has already
demonstrated its prowess by beating both reigning champions
Germany and World Cup holders Pakistan in the group preliminaries.
</P>
<P>
In 1980, Spain recorded its best performance of second place in
the Moscow Olympic Games, while Australia had entered the Olympic
semifinals four times since 1964.
</P>
<P>

ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- America's freestyle wrestlers,
inspired by the memory of murdered teammate Dave Schultz, fought
their way to two Olympic golds on Wednesday.
</P>

an earlier fight. In the best form of his life at the age of 28,
Cross energetically outpointed Canada's Giouvi Sissaouri.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House of Representatives Passes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Hours after U.S. President Bill
Clinton said he would sign a welfare bill ending the 60-year
federal guarantee of open-ended assistance to the poor, the House
of Representatives passed the bill, 328-101, on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Senate is set to act on the bill on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
During his 1992 campaign for presidency, Clinton promised to
end the current welfare system, he had nevertheless vetoed two
previous welfare reform bills from the Republican-led Congress.
</P>
<P>
He said the latest bill had "serious flaws" but he would sign
it because "I believe we have a duty to seize the opportunity it
gives us to end welfare as we know it by moving people from
welfare to work, demanding responsibility and doing better by
children."
</P>
<P>
The bill, projected to save the federal government about 55
billion dollars over six years, would set a lifetime limit of five
years of welfare per family, require an able-bodied adult to work
after two years but allow hardship exemptions for up to 20 percent
of recipients. It also would give the states block grants to run
the programs and let them set many of the rules, such as
terminating benefits sooner than five years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said the bill was "far, far from perfect" and said he
would work to fix what he considered excessive cuts in food stamps
and benefits for legal immigrants who have not yet become
citizens.
</P>
<P>
But he said the bill "gives us a chance we haven't had before
to break the cycle of dependency that has existed for millions and
millions of our fellow citizens, exiling them from the world of
work. It gives structure, meaning and dignity to most of our
lives."
</P>
<P>
While the bill makes some concessions to Clinton, it remains
tough, forcing people off welfare and into jobs while cutting back
on help to move them there by eliminating a 3-billion-dollar work
program the House had approved.
</P>
<P>
It would let states deny Medicaid coverage to an adult who
loses welfare benefits by not going to work. It also would make it
harder for a single parent to escape sanctions for not working
because of an inability to find child care. Under the House and
Senate bills, the child had to be under 11. Under the final bill,
the child must be under 6.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Approves Five Key Projects in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today announced
the approval of credits totaling 75.6 million U.S. dollars for
five emergency reconstruction projects in Bosnia and Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
These key construction projects are in landmine clearing,
housing repair, electric power, public works and employment, and
the demobilization and reintegration of former combatants.
</P>
<P>
The credits from the International Development Association
(IDA), a World Bank wing which provides concessional funding to
the developing countries, will finance the projects, which bring
to 12 the total number of the World Bank-backed emergency
reconstruction projects in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that there are 1.5 million to 3 million
landmines in the war-torn country. Many of the mines are made
mostly of plastic, making them very difficult to detect. There is
also a considerable quantity of unexpected ordnance around former
confrontation lines. The project, which an estimated total cost of
67 million dollars, will be financed by the World Bank, the
European Union, the United Nations and a number of bilateral
donors.
</P>
<P>
More than half of all housing in Bosnia suffered at least some
damage and almost one-fifth of all units were destroyed during the
war. The housing repair project, which is estimated at a cost of
50 million dollars, will be funded with 15 million dollars from
IDA.
</P>
<P>
The country's estimated 70 percent of electrical generating
capacity was damaged or destroyed in the war. The electric
reconstruction project, with an estimated total cost of 197.6
million dollars, will receive 35.6 million dollars from IDA, and
will help restore electricity service in major cities and for
vital industries throughout the country.
</P>
<P>
The two-part emergency public works and employment project has
an estimated total cost of 45 million dollars and will receive a
10 million dollar credit from IDA.
</P>
<P>
There are some 425,000 soldiers will be demobilized under the
Dayton Agreement and about 1.25 million refugees abroad, many of
whom are expected to return to Bosnia. The emergency
demobilization and reintegration project, funded by 7.5 million
dollars from IDA, has an estimated total cost of 20 million
dollars and will reduce the burden on families and dependency on
social assistance by supporting the placement of demobilized
soldiers, returning refugees and others into productive force.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Authority Not to Extradite Its Citizens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb Justice Minister
Marko Arsovic said today the Hague-based criminal tribunal for the
former Yugoslavia had accepted Bosnian Serb stand that their
citizens would not be extradited to the Hague for trial.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the Hague to Belgrade-based Yugoslav news agency
Tanjug over telephone, Arsovic said that tribunal representatives
had had a different stand over the issue, but that they accepted
the position of the Republika Srpska, whose delegation had given
strong arguments on the impossibility of extradition to the
tribunal.
</P>
<P>
Arsovic, who headed the Serb delegation to the Hague in the
past three days, described the visit to the tribunal as "very
successful."
</P>
<P>
He said the two sides had discussed a wide range of issues,
including cooperation, prosecution policy, tribunal's biasness,
extradition and other matters and that the final results of the
talks were "very favorable" to the Serb side.
</P>
<P>
"We have succeeded in convincing them that, according to the
number of accused Serbs, Muslims and Croats, the prosecution
policy requested by their prosecutor had not been objective so far
and that mostly Serbs were tried. They convinced us that they were
preparing trials against the other two parties to the conflict,"
Arsovic said.
</P>
<P>
The Hague tribunal has so far listed 75 war criminals in the
former Yugoslavia, of whom 54 are Serbs, 18 Croats and three
Muslims.
</P>
<P>
The Serb minister said that a Hague tribunal delegation would
visit the Serb town of Banja Luka in northwestern Bosnia next week
and collect evidence on crimes against Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"This investigation would also be aimed at collecting evidence
against Croat and Muslim war crimes suspects," he added.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion and world top
table tennis player Deng Yaping of China edged out 1988 Olympic
champion Chen Jing in a gruelling five-set women's singles final
to win her fourth Olympic title here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Deng repeated her singles-doubles glory in the Barcelona Games
after beating Chen, a former Chinese national team member who now
represents Chinese Taipei, 21-14, 21-17, 20-22, 17-21, 21-5.
</P>
<P>
"That's normal that Deng and Chen, both trained by the Chinese
national team, finished one-two," said Chinese vice sports
minister Xu Yinsheng, also the President of the International
Table Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
"Both had played to their best," Xu said. "In the deciding
game, Deng overwhelmed Chen by more aggressive play."
</P>
<P>
Deng's killing forehands worked today as she won half of her
points by forehand. Chen won 35 percent of her points by
forehand.
</P>
<P>
In the first two sets, Deng used her long-pimpled backhand,
which can produce funny spin with different flick of wrist, to
push Chen into defence and then got the kills.
</P>
<P>
Chen got used to Deng's play and made her rival off balance
with well-placed shots.
</P>
<P>
The 27-year-old Chen saved a match point to take the third set
and jumped into a 20-14 lead in the fourth.
</P>
<P>
After Deng made an serve error, the two entered a tie-breaking
fifth set.
</P>
<P>
The highly motivated Deng didn't give any chance to Chen in the
final set. She pumped her fist into the air after winning a
point.

ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- World top paddler Deng Yaping
routed her opponent 3-2 to retain her Olympic title in the women's

<P>
Deng outclassed Chen Jing, former Olympic champion in the 1988
Seoul Games, 21-14, 21-17, 20-22, 17-21 and 21-5.
</P>
<P>
After winning the first two sets, Deng, winner in the 1992
Barcelona Games, hit the nets twice to sacrifice her 19-18 lead
and lost the set from a deadlock 20-all.
</P>
<P>
In the fourth set, Chen Jing surged ahead 7-2 and 20-14 as Deng
made numerous off-side hits who managed to pull back to 17-20
before committing another error in serve.
</P>
<P>
The deciding set was a lop-sided contest with Deng leapt
forward 7-2 and 15-3 with fast attacks and Chen Jing was in no
place to unleash her counter-attacks.
</P>
<P>
As the Olympic Games entered its 12th-day competition, Deng
Yaping becomes the sole Chinese athletes with two gold medals.
</P>
<P>
Early on Monday, Deng Yaping paired with long-time partner

<HEADLINE> Sanchez to Meet Davenport in Women's Singles Final </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Third seed Arantxa Vicario Sanchez
of Spain set up a final clash against Lindsay Davenport of the
United States with an 6-4, 1-6, 6-3 victory over Jana Novotna of
Czech Republic here on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
With the win, the Spaniard is well on her way to have a full
color of Olympic medals after she landed a singles bronze and a
doubles silver in Barcelona four years ago.
</P>
<P>
After reaching the final, she said: "I am looking for full set
now."
</P>
<P>
Novotna, who defeated world joint number one Monica Seles of
the United States for her semifinal outing in the quarter-finals,
was angry at Sanchez, saying that she questioned line calls in
their seasaw match.
</P>
<P>
"For a player of her calibre, it is upsetting," Novotna said,
"You just start to think is this a professional way of doing
things?"
</P>
<P>
Sanchez, third in world rankings, replied to the charges: "I
didn't question any of the calls. It is not right for her to say
that."
</P>
<P>
The Spaniard, who is powerful for her baseline tactics, was
mentally tougher on big points and seized every chance she got.
</P>
<P>
"Even when I was down, I was able to come back," she added.
</P>
<P>
Davenport, seeded ninth at the Olympics, defeated a sadly
out-of-sorts Mary Joe Fernandez, also from the United States, 6-2,
7-6.
</P>
<P>
"It was such a big match and on top of that I was playing my
best friend," Davenport said, "It was the biggest match of my life
and I was playing someone I didn't want to lose to."
</P>
<P>
The final match will be held on Friday.

meeting, Mexican Foreign Minister Angel Gurria said that the
U.S.-Mexico cooperation is excellent in broad matters, including
trade, immigration and the drug fight.
</P>
<P>
Mexico has recently extradited more than 10 drug traffickers to
the United States, the U.S. State Department said.
</P>
<P>
"We are prepared to extradite American citizens" to stand trial
in Mexico on drug charges, Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office
of U.S. National Drug Control Policy, said at the conference.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, the top U.S. drug fighter also defended
Mexico's commitment to battling drug trafficking and the U.S.
administration's efforts against narcotics during a hearing of the
U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
"Mexico cannot solve its drug-related problems on its own and
neither can the United States," he said. "If we fail to work
cooperatively, the traffickers will use the border and sovereignty
issues against us," he warned.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey stressed that the mutual interests between the two
nations "are broad and growing."

<HEADLINE> Clinton Says He Would Sign Welfare Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
said Wednesday that he would sign the latest version of welfare
reform legislation, ending the 60-year-old federal guarantee of
welfare which was meant to be: a second chance, not a way
of life."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who promised in 1992 to change "welfare as we know
it," had vetoed two previous Republican welfare bills.
</P>
<P>
In an appearance in the White House briefing room, Clinton said
the latest bill is an opportunity "to live up to that promise" of
1992.
</P>
<P>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich said, "This is an historic moment
because we are working together to do something that is very good
for America."
</P>
<P>
However, Clinton called the bill "far from perfect" and
promised to address concerns he has with the measure.
</P>
<P>
In particular, he criticized a Republican-backed provision that
would ban welfare to legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
"There are parts of it that are wrong," he said. "But on
balance this bill is a real step forward for our country, our
values and for people who are on welfare."
</P>
<P>
He said he would sign the bill because the current system is
"broken." Congress improved the measure and "this is the best
chance we will have in a long, long time" to overhaul the system,
he said.
</P>
<P>
The bill is expected to save the federal government 55 billion
to 56 billion dollars over six years. It would set a lifetime
limit of five years of welfare per family, require an able-bodied
adult to work after two years and allow hardship exemptions for up
to 20 percent of recipients. It also would give the states block
grants to run the programs and let them set many of the rules,
such as terminating benefits sooner than five years.
</P>
<P>
Clinton had endorsed the bill's basics although he expressed
worries about the legislation's impact on children. The White
House had criticized the bill's projected savings of more than 50
billion dollars over six years, particularly its restrictions on
food stamps and other aid to legal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
While the bill makes some concessions to Clinton, it remains
tough, forcing people off welfare and into jobs while cutting back
on help to move them there by eliminating a 3 billion dollar work
program the House had approved.
</P>
<P>
It would let states deny Medicaid coverage to an adult who
loses welfare benefits by not going to work. It also would make it
harder for a single parent to escape sanctions for not working
because of an inability to find child care. Under the House and
Senate bills, the child had to be under 11. Under the final bill,
the child must be under 6.

<HEADLINE> Kenyan "AIDS Drug" Producer Criticized Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan Minister for Health Joshua
Angatia today castigated the founder of the controversial AIDS
drug "Pearl Omega" Prof Arthur Obel.
</P>
<P>
Joshua Angatia called him an alarmist who is scheduled to
appear before a medical disciplinary board for his careless
medical utterance.
</P>
<P>
The minister was speaking during an AIDS motion in parliament
in which some MPs described Prof Obel as having stated that the
use of condoms during sex contributed to the spread of HIV among
the users.
</P>
<P>
Joshua Angatia regretted Prof Obel's remarks saying that
medical experts all over the world have rated the use of condoms
during sexual relationships as being 70 percent safe from HIV and
AIDS.
</P>
<P>
Contacted, Prof Obel said he is launching his book "Power and
the Influential People" that he did not trust condoms as a
preventive measure against HIV and AIDS.
</P>
<P>
However, the founder of the controversial AIDS drug "Pearl
Omega" Obel has declared in a Nairobi court recently that he has
never said that his drug can cure AIDS as reported by local
press.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Dissatisfied with OSCE Rules </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav government official
Bratislava Morina said today her country was dissatisfied with
OSCE because Yugoslavia was not included in formulating the
electoral rules for Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
Morina, Chairman of the government commission for the rights of
refugees in the upcoming elections in Bosnia, said the lists of
voters drawn up by the Organization for Security and Cooperation
in Europe ((OSCE) and mission in charge of organizing the elections
did not correspond to the actual situation.
</P>
<P>
Around 60,000 Serb refugees registered in Yugoslavia were
missing from the supplied lists, she said at the talks with OSCE
representative Hans-Peter Klainer in Belgrade.
</P>
<P>
Kleiner said the lists would be checked and the deadline for
the Yugoslav side to process the figures would be put off until
August 5.
</P>
<P>
Morina also complained that under the existing OSCE rules for
election, about 30,000 wounded or seriously ill refugees would
have to travel to Bosnian Serb state Republika Srpska to cast
their ballots, according to Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Kleiner told reporters that the implementation
of the Dayton peace accords has led to the partitioning of 49
municipalities in Bosnia-Herzegovina.
</P>
<P>
He said some of the municipalities had been divided between the
Muslim-Croat federation and Republika Srpska while others between
the Croat and Muslim sides within the federation.
</P>
<P>
The OSCE official said each side would have its own local
electoral commission in the September 14 elections.

<HEADLINE> Krajisnik: Elections Resolves Issue of Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Elections in Bosnia, planned for
September 14, can fortify Republika Srpska and resolve the issue
of sanctions, Serb parliament Speaker Momcilo Krajisnik said
today.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with a radio station in southern Yugoslav city
Nis, Krajisnik said the Serb leadership wanted elections to be
prepared and held with the least possible problems.
</P>
<P>
"The most important is that elections will finally resolve an
essential issue, the issue of sanctions, because the Dayton
agreement stipulates a lifting of the sanctions after the holding
of the elections," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Dayton agreement, reached last November, provides for a
final lifting of the U.N. sanctions against the Bosnian Serbs and
the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia 10 days after the general
elections in Bosnia-Herzegovina is held.
</P>
<P>
He also highly spoke of Yugoslavia's efforts in helping
refugees realize their right to vote and informing them about the
importance of the elections for the Bosnian Serbs.
</P>
<P>
"The registration of refugees and their voting is of paramount
importance," Krajisnik stressed.

<HEADLINE> Canada, Israel Sign Free Trade Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 31 (Xinhua) -- Canada and Israel signed here today
a free trade agreement to eliminate tariffs from nearly all
industrial products traded between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Under the pact, tariffs will be removed from industrial
products of Canadian or Israeli origin beginning January 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Only women's swimwear, at Canada's request, and certain cotton
fabric, at Israel's request, will continue to be subject to
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
The two countries agreed that these tariffs will be phased out
over the first two and a half years.
</P>
<P>
Duty-free access or low duties will be applied to a variety of
agricultural and fisheries products exported by both countries.
For Canada, such items include grains, grain products, beef, maple
sugar, alcoholic beverages and various processed foods.
</P>
<P>
Both sides have excluded dairy, poultry and egg products.
</P>
<P>
To resolve any disputes under the agreement, both countries
have agreed to be governed by a binding dispute settlement
process.
</P>
<P>
The pact was inked by Canadian Minister for International Trade
Art Eggleton and visiting Israeli Minister of Industry and Trade
Natan Sharansky.
</P>
<P>
The agreement will "put Canadian exporters on an equal footing
with their U.S. and European competitors, who have had the benefit
of free trade agreements with Israel," Eggleton said on occasion
of the signing.
</P>
<P>
In support of this agreement, both ministers also announced the
formation of a business advisory group to function within the
Canada-Israel Joint Economic Commission.
</P>
<P>
The mandate of the new group is to produce innovative
approaches to stimulate business and to provide advice to the two
governments on trade issues.
</P>
<P>
Canada also intends to extend the same benefits to the
Palestinians that Israel will enjoy under the new pact, said
sources from the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and
International Trade.
</P>
<P>
Today's agreement will have to be approved by the Canadian and
Israeli parliaments.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Envoy Meets with Bosnian Muslim, Serb Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 31 (Xinhua) -- U.S. envoy John Kornblum held
separate talks with Bosnian Muslim leader Alija Izetbegovic and
Serb leader Momcilo Krajisnik today over upcoming elections and
other important issues.
</P>
<P>
After talks with Izetbegovic, Kornblum told reporters in
Sarajevo that they had discussed the crisis within the
Muslim-Croat federation, the federation's relations with the Serb
entity Republika Srpska, the role of media in the election
campaign and the upcoming elections, according to Tanjug news
agency.
</P>
<P>
"We have held very useful and extensive talks on the
implementation of the Dayton peace accords in both the federation
and Republika Srpska," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. Assistant Secretary of State declined to say
anything substantive about the talks.
</P>
<P>
After meeting the Muslim leader, Kornblum then went to Serb
administrative center Pale for talks with Republika Srpska
leaders, including parliament speaker Momcilo Krajisnik and acting
President Biljana Plavsic, but the outcome of the closed-door talk
was unknown, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy is going to Mostar on Thursday for talks with
the leaders of both Muslim and Croat communities there. Contrary
to Dayton provisions, Mostar remains a divided city after the June
elections, since Croats have been boycotting the city council in
which Muslims have won a majority.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy will then fly to Zagreb to meet with Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman over the issue of Mostar dispute.
</P>
<P>
The crisis has prompted the European Union to threaten to
terminate its administration of the city and some countries to
call for sanctions against Croats.
