<HEADLINE> Iranian President Says US Fails to Strike Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Hashemi
Rafsanjani said here today that Washington has failed to strike
even the slightest blow to Iran's Islamic Revolution.
</P>
<P>
Rafsanjani said that America's "one-year-old trade embargo
could not work and Iran has overcome all its hostile acts."
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president made the remarks while meeting with
members of the headquarters in charge of holding the ceremonies
commemorating the anniversary of the death of late Iranian leader
Ruhollah Mousavi Khomeini.
</P>
<P>
Early this month, Rafsanjani asked the United States to give up
its "hostile acts" against Iran and claimed that Iran was not
isolated.
</P>
<P>
He said "Iran has played an invaluable role in the cause of
peace and stability during the Islamic revolution."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the United States should realize that plots
against the Islamic Republic of Iran is a big blunder and it would
end in utter failure and disgraceful defeat.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Islamic Revolution, Rafsanjani said today that
Iran would continue to pursue the causes of Khomeini, adding that
"the magnificence of the movement launched by the late Imam
Khomeini to topple the former diabolic regime of Iran and to
introduce Islam as a religion capable of governing the state would
remain in history forever."

<HEADLINE> Rumors on Yuan's Devaluation Refuted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Governor of China's central
bank Dai Xianglong today refuted rumors on the devaluation of the
Renminbi yuan as "groundless". He gave an assurance that yuan
would remain basically stable in the future.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a seminar in Beijing on Hong Kong's financial
prospects after 1997, Dai said China's foreign exchange reserves
has kept growing rapidly. The exchange rate of yuan is now
determined by market forces instead of by administrative
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
"The hard currency supply still exceeds demand and our
international payment positions are well balanced," said Dai.
</P>
<P>
"Some people predict that yuan will devalue, and even by a big
margin, it is totally groundless," he said.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show China's foreign exchange reserve stood
at 80.8 billion US dollars by the end of March.
</P>
<P>
The central bank governor said he strongly believes that Hong
Kong will maintain its status as an international financial center
after China resumes exercise of its sovereignty over Hong Kong
in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"This status will possibly be enhanced after 1997," he said,
</P>
<P>
Dai noted that Hong Kong has a well-functioned legal framework,
a huge foreign exchange reserve and a strong team of professionals
and experts. It has become the economic, financial, trade,
transportation and information center in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"Political stability and rapid economic development in the
mainland create favorable conditions for Hong Kong to continue to
enjoy its present status." .
</P>
<P>
"The People's Bank of China will fully support the Hong Kong
Monetary Authority to discharge its responsibilities on monetary
policy and maintain financial order in the region," said Dai.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is co-sponsored by four leading financial houses in
Hong Kong including the Hong Kong Monetary Authority, the
Securities and Futures Commission, the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong
and the Hong Kong Futures Exchange.
</P>
<P>
It is by far the largest ever two-way exchange of views between
the mainland and Hong Kong on issues concerning Hong Kong's
financial status and prosperities after 1997, which drew over 500
financial officials and experts from the two places.

<HEADLINE> EU Members Closer to Appoint Special Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- European Union(EU) member states
are close to agreement on a procedure to secure the rapid
appointment of a special envoy to represent the EU in crisis
situations, such as the crisis currently affecting the Great Lakes
region of Africa.
</P>
<P>
This was reported in the latest twice-weekly European Report.
</P>
<P>
These directions, which specialist advisors on CFSP(Common
Foreign and Security Policy) to the EU Council of Ministers have
been considering over recent weeks, are "still floundering on
legal pitfalls", according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that these difficulties may however be resolved
by the next meeting of EU Foreign Ministers on June 10 in
Luxembourg.
</P>
<P>
The procedure being studied by experts provides for the
decision to appoint a special envoy to be taken by the Council of
Ministers which could then call on member states and the European
Commission(EC) to present candidate.
</P>
<P>
The Political Committee(which brings together member states'
Foreign Office Policy Directors) would examine the candidates and
forward an opinion to the Council of Ministers which could then
appoint a representative and decide on the common action the
special envoy would be charged with executing "under the authority
of Presidency and in cooperation with the EC".
</P>
<P>
The Council would moreover settle the mandate, its duration and
possible extension, and set the date from which the envoy would
exercise his mission.

<HEADLINE> Chrysler Now Most Efficient Car Maker in U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Chrysler Corp.'s car factories
were rated the most efficient among those of the U.S. Big Three
auto makers for the first time, the Wall Street Journal reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The other two major car manufacturers are the General Motors
Corp. and Ford Motor Co., whose production volumes have outpaced
that of Chrysler.
</P>
<P>
In a closely watched annual study of North American
vehicle-factory productivity, Chrysler displaced Ford Motor Co. as
the Big Three's most efficient car producer, a title Ford had held
since 1981.
</P>
<P>
Including light-truck production, the study found that Ford
remained the most efficient of the U.S.-based companies in overall
light-vehicle production.
</P>
<P>
However, the paper said, efficiency of the Big Three's
light-vehicle plants still trailed the North American Plants of
Nissan Motor Corp., Toyota Motor Corp. and Honda Motor Co..
</P>
<P>
The study ranks individual vehicle factories and auto makers
based on the amount of labor required in sheet-metal stamping,
engine and transmission manufacturing and final vehicle-assembly
operations for 1995.
</P>
<P>
For the third consecutive year, Nissan's car and light-truck
unit in Tennessee ranked at the top, requiring an average of fewer
than 28 hours of labor to produce a vehicle. By contrast, all of
General Motors Corp.'s plants took an average of 46 labor hours to
produce a vehicle -- the most time for any North American
manufacturers, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Chrysler improved its productivity through the use of smarter
designs, leaner staffing and lower investment costs.
</P>
<P>
The study also ranked auto makers by profitability per vehicle
on a world-wide basis. In that category, it said, Chrysler ranked
first among the auto makers surveyed with profits of 628 U.S.
dollars a vehicle for 1995.
</P>
<P>
By contrast, Nissan, the productivity leader in the U.S. had a
loss world-wide of 760 U.S. dollars a vehicle, largely because
of its high administration costs.

<HEADLINE> U.S. New Home Sales Up By 6.7 Percent in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Sales of new homes in the U.S.
shot up by 6.7 percent in April, U.S. Commerce Department reported
here today.
</P>
<P>
The Commerce Department said sales of single-family homes
totaled 776,000 at a seasonally adjusted annual rate, a big
increase from a sharply revised figure in March.
</P>
<P>
The department revised the sale of new homes in the past three
months. Sales in March was revised up to a rate of 727,000 from
originally estimated 672,000. The rates of the sales were also
revised up to 743,000 rate from 729,000 for January and to 786,000
from 727,000 for February.
</P>
<P>
It was the first time in the nation when sales have topped a
700,000 rate for four months in a row since the period ended in
December 1993.
</P>
<P>
The strong pace during the first four months of the year pushed
sales 25.9 percent above the same period of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Actual sales in 1995 totaled 667,000, the department said.
</P>
<P>
U.S. analysts say that sales are near their peak and will slow
eventually as buyers feel the effects of rising rates.
</P>
<P>
After dipping to an average of 7.03 percent in January, rates
rose to an average of 7.93 percent in April, up from 7.62 percent
in March but below the 8.32 percent average a year earlier. The
Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corp. said rates averaged 8.01 percent
last week.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales jumped by 56 percent in the Northeast to a
78,000 annual rate, the highest level since a 94,000 rate in
September 1994. Sales were up by 3.8 percent in the Midwest, by 3
percent in the South and by 2.8 percent in the West.

<HEADLINE> HK's Financial Stability to be Protected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China will not draw on Hong Kong's
Foreign Exchange Fund to meet the demand for foreign exchange in
the mainland, Chen Yuan, deputy governor of the People's Bank of
China, the central bank, said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region
(SAR) clearly stipulates that the main function of the fund is to
stabilize exchange rates of the Hong Kong dollar against major
world currencies," he told a seminar on Hong Kong's financial
future.
</P>
<P>
Also at the seminar, Joseph Yam, chief executive of the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority, said that the Foreign Exchange Fund will
be managed by the government of the SAR.
</P>
<P>
"China will continue to back Hong Kong's efforts to link the
Hong Kong dollar with the major world currency as the practice,
which started in 1983, has vigorously safeguarded the Hong Kong
dollar's stability and played a very important role in stabilizing
Hong Kong's financial system," said Chen.
</P>
<P>
After the 1997 handover, he said, Hong Kong dollar and the RMB
yuan (the mainland's currency) will be two legal currencies
circulating under different social and economic systems in a
sovereign state, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Technically, however, the Hong Kong dollar in the mainland and
the RMB in Hong Kong will be treated as foreign currencies," he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China and the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
will continue their sound co-operative relationship, he said.
</P>
<P>
"With more than 70 billion US dollars invested in China, Hong
Kong is the No.1 investor in and a leading trade partner with the
mainland," said Chen. "Changes in China's policies, especially
monetary policies, will have a direct impact on Hong Kong's market.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand, due to a steady increase in mainland's
financial and non-financial assets in Hong Kong, the fluctuation
of the Hong Kong dollar against major world currencies will
affect the value of those assets," he emphasized.
</P>
<P>
"If necessary, China will provide support to maintain Hong
Kong's financial stability," Chen added.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Likud challenger Benjamin
Netanyahu has defeated Shimon Peres in the close race for
premiership, Israel's Central Election Committee (CEC) announced
today.
</P>
<P>
The following are Netanyahu's viewpoints on major issues made
public during the election campaign:
</P>
<P>
-- Strongly opposes the establishment of a Palestinian state,
saying a Palestinian state is an existential threat to Israel.
</P>
<P>
-- Only agrees to grant Palestinians limited autonomy with the
Palestinians controlling every aspect of their lives except for
foreign policy and security.
</P>
<P>
-- Rejects the principle of land-for-peace, refuses to cede
more land to the Palestinians and rules out the return of the
Golan Heights to Syria.
</P>
<P>
-- Plans to expand the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and
Gaza but has promised to cap government spending on settlements at
300 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
-- Refuses to discuss the Jerusalem issue with the
Palestinians, who want the Arab sector of the city for the capital
of a state, adding that he would close Orient House, the
Palestinian headquarters in Jerusalem, and prevent any attempts to
establish Palestinian self-rule in the city which is "Israel's
capital."
</P>
<P>
-- Says he would not honor a commitment by Shimon Peres to pull
troops out of most Hebron after the elections.
</P>
<P>
-- Says he will give Israeli troops the freedom to enter
Palestinian-controlled areas in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in
pursuit of suspected terrorists.
</P>
<P>
-- Says he will consider meeting with Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat if it seems essential for security to do so.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Denies Agreement on Cyprus Problem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
denied today that there is an agreement on some aspects of
the Cyprus problem between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides.
</P>
<P>
The president was commenting on a statement made earlier by
U.S. ambassador to the island, Richard Boucher, that there is an
agreement between the two sides on many aspects of the Cyprus
problem even if a final solution has not yet been reached.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides said there has been no agreement concerning
the issue of security, noting that even though Turkey accepts his
proposal for an international force on the island it still insists
on the preservation of guarantees and its right of intervention.
</P>
<P>
There is also disagreement regarding territorial adjustments,
he said, as the Turks demand 29 (plus) percent of the island's
territory while the Greek Cypriot side is proposing 24 percent,
the president noted.
</P>
<P>
He also referred to differences of opinion between the two
sides regarding Cyprus' accession to the European Union (EU).
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has not yet said whether it accepts Cyprus' accession
before Turkey becomes a member," he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, speaking after a meeting with President
Clerides, Boucher referred to his statement on Thursday that many
elements necessary for a comprehensive and peacefully negotiated
settlement in Cyprus have already been agreed upon, saying that
"it is true that many concepts have been agreed."
</P>
<P>
"The two parties have signed high-level agreements which
designate a bi-communal, bi-zonal federation, talked about
territorial adjustment, talked about many other aspects of the
settlement," Boucher said.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador noted that the two sides have basically accepted
a series of U.N. resolutions, but added that "obviously we do not
have an agreement, we do not have all the details worked out, and
many important aspects and details of these concepts have not been
agreed."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded
and took control of 37 percent of the island following an
Athens-backed coup.
</P>
<P>
The U.N.-sponsored peace talks between the two sides went into
deadlock because no common ground has been found on basic aspects
of the Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
There have been no face-to-face meetings between the two
communities' leaders since a series of informal talks in Nicosia
in October, 1994 under the U.N. auspices.

<HEADLINE> France to Propose European-led NATO Unit with U.S. Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- France will propose restructuring
NATO to give European nations the power to conduct military
operations using U.S. intelligence and air support but no American
ground troops, a senior French diplomats was quoted as saying
today.
</P>
<P>
The French diplomat told the Washington Times that France would
put forward the proposal at a NATO foreign ministers meeting
scheduled to be held in Berlin Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the French Plan, if the 16-nation North Atlantic Council,
NATO's governing body, unanimously approves, a European-run
military operation would be launched under a European commander
with the right to deploy U.S. assests.
</P>
<P>
The proposed arrangement is in part a response to Europe's
annoyance at being unable to mount a NATO intervention in Bosnia
in 1992 and 1993 because of U.S. reluctance to commit its ground
troops.
</P>
<P>
The French plan calls for integrating troops from various NATO
countries into Combined Joint Task Force that could be used to
police Bosnia after the current 60,000-strong NATO Implementation
Force ends in December.
</P>
<P>
The Clinton administration has said that the French proposals
were being considered but final U.S. approval has not been given.
</P>
<P>
A senior U.S. official, speaking on condition of anonymity,
told reporters on Thursday that the United States would reserve
the option of not participating in a particular NATO European
operation while placing some American troops, intelligence and
airlift under European commanders.

<P>
COLOMBO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Bandaranaike Kumaratunga said here today that her government would
go ahead with the economic restructuring program by privatizing
state venture despite current strikes led by the Ceylon
Electricity Board (CEB).
</P>
<P>
Now the entire country is in the dark for the power cut which
has severely affected the health, transport, water, petroleum and
other sectors, the president said at a special press conference.
</P>
<P>
The CEB unions went on strike from May 29, demanding that the
government withdraw its moves to privatize the Sri Lankan
Electricity Company while increasing salaries for employees in the
power sector. The strike by the 14,000 CEB employees entered the
third day today, resulting in severe power failure nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The government is expected to take stern actions against the
strikers under the emergency law to overcome the crisis, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
According to the law, the country prohibits any kind of strike
in the power sector which provides the nation's essential service,
and the violators will be punished with measures from
confiscating their wealth to depriving them of employment.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Urges Aid for Caucasus Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations today launched a
consolidated inter-agency appeal for 101 million U.S. dollars in
humanitarian assistance to Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The appeal, covering a one-year period beginning June 1996,
addresses the most urgent needs of refugees, internally displaced
persons and other vulnerable groups in the Caucasus region, said
the U.N. Department of Humanitarian Affairs (DHA).
</P>
<P>
The funds are for projects initiated by nine U.N. agencies,
including the International Organization for Migration (IOM) and
several non-governmental organizations (NGOs).
</P>
<P>
The appeal requests 24.4 million dollars for Armenia, 30.5
million for Azerbaijan, and 36.7 million for Georgia, in addition
to 9.4 million dollars for regional projects.
</P>
<P>
Assistance programs will benefit an estimated 800,000 displaced
and vulnerable persons, 250,000 of them in Armenia, 225,000 in
Azerbaijan and 300,000 in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
According to DHA, a significant decline in the number of
displaced people cannot be expected before substantive progress is
made in resolving Nagorno Karabakh and Abkhaz conflicts in the
region.
</P>
<P>
It added that the economic transitions underway in these
countries have led to greater needs among the highly vulnerable
groups of society, like widowers and pensioners.
</P>
<P>
The appeal for 118 million dollars for the region for the
previous year has been 60 percent met.
</P>
<P>
DHA said response turned out to be stronger for food aid and
refugee-related aid than for other projects, notably those in the
health and rehabilitation sectors.

<HEADLINE> Humaniarian Situation Deteriorates in Somalia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Mogadishu, May 31 (Xinhua) -- At least 14 people have died for
hunger and more than 200 others are believed to be suffering for
malnourishment related diseases in the refugee camps of
Mogadishu, said a recent humanitarian survey carried out by
members from the relief agencies in collaboration with Somali
intellectuals.
</P>
<P>
The humanitarian situation in Somalia will go out of hand if
no large scale humanitarian effort is made by the world
community, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The international relief agencies predicted that the
humanitarian crisis in Somalia will be even worse than that of
1992 when half a million people have died for starvation in
southern Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Life situation has been getting tougher and tougher in the
Somali capital since the international expatriates working for
international relief agencies have been evacuated from south
Mogadishu two months ago after an intermittent inter-clan
fighting had erupted between opposing militiamen loyal to General
Mohamed Farah Aidid and his former financier, Osman Hassan Ali
Atto.
</P>
<P>
The number of the malnourished is growing especially almong
the children under five, elderly people and the nursing mothers.
In the refugee camps of Mogadishu, the average death per day is
said to be more than two people and the few operational relief
agencies can hardly cope with the ever deterorating situation of
the internally desplaced Somalis.
</P>
<P>
The recent famine also struck 500 families living in refugee
camps in Qoryoley District, 150 km southwest of the capital. In
Hiran Region of central Somalia, 2-3 people died every day from
starvation and the situation may even worse if no immediate
assistance is delivered in the area.
</P>
<P>
As the rainy season began early this month, the refugees in
the capital and elsewhere are having a problem as they lack
adequate shelter and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more than 60 percent of the expected crop harvest
from middle Shabelle Region have been erased by recent floods
after heavy rains fell on the Shawa Mountains southeast of
Ethiopia. The rain has made Shabelle River (one of the country's
two permanently flowing rivers in Somalia throughout the year) to
go beyond its banks. The floods have also created more helpless
refugees after their houses were drowned.

<HEADLINE> Ghana Joins UN Peacekeeping Standby Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Ghana has become the first African
country to join the United Nations peacekeeping standby group,
local press reports said here today.
</P>
<P>
Ghana on Thursday signed a memorandum of
understanding with the UN on the standby arrangement for
peacekeeping operation, the third country in the world to do so.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed in New York by the UN Under
Secretary-General for Peacekeeping Operations, Kofi Annan, and
Ghana's permanent representative to the UN, Jacob Wilmot.
</P>
<P>
Under the terms of the agreement, Ghana will provide a
significant number of troops including specialized units within a
short frame of time, if called upon by the UN to help launch a
new mission.
</P>
<P>
"The idea is to enhance the planning and flexibility of the
operations and to help them achieve cost-effectiveness," said UN
spokesman Sylvana Foa.
</P>
<P>
Foa said the arrangement had already been used by the UN in
planning peacekeeping missions in eastern Slovenia and Angola,
saying "they worked."
</P>
<P>
Standby arrangements were created in 1994 to bridge the
three-to-six month gap between the time a peacekeeping mission is
anthorized by the Security Council and the actual deployment of
the mission.
</P>
<P>
It enables nations to pledge troops, logistic support or other
required resources within days or weeks instead of the several
months normally required.
</P>
<P>
Jordan was the first country to sign the memorandum of
understanding in January 1995, followed by Danmark in May of the
same year.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-five countries have so far indicated their willingness
to participate in the standby arrangement of the UN peacekeeping
operations.

<P>
LONDON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Two riders were killed in separate

motor cycling race.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Palestinians Ready to Deal with New Israeli </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BETHLEHEM, the West Bank, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A senior
Palestinian official said here today that the Palestinian
Authority is ready to deal with a new Israeli government,
regardless of who will take the first chair.
</P>
<P>
Elias M. Freij, Mayor of Bethlehem, made the remarks in an
exclusive interview with Xinhua, especially over the prospect of
a new Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that results of the Israeli general elections
might be made known this afternoon or this evening, and the
Palestinians will deal with the Israeli government on an
objective basis.
</P>
<P>
The mayor, who also served as tourism minister in the previous
cabinet of the Palestinian Authority, refrained from making
comments on the Israeli elections, but said that they are an
internal affair of Israel.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli people have the right to make their choice," he
noted.
</P>
<P>
Answering a question that some people think incumbent Israeli
Prime Minister Shimon Peres is more flexible than Likud Party
Chairman Benjamin Netanyahu in handling the Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations, Freij said: "I doubt this."
</P>
<P>
He maintains that there are no substantial differences between
Peres and Netanyahu in their policies with the Arabs, especially
the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
"There are some basic points both Peres and Netanyahu agree on
-- Jerusalem, borders, settlements ... territorial withdrawal,
recognition of certain Palestinian rights and so on, so there is
no difference (between them) actually," he said.
</P>
<P>
As to the establishment of a Palestinian state, Freij said
both Peres and Netanyahu have repeatedly expressed their
objections, he said.
</P>
<P>
On whether he has received any order from President Yasser
Arafat to make preparation for the changes in the Israeli
government, Freij said he has not, but a meeting is planned this
evening to discuss the matter.
</P>
<P>
By late last night, Netanyahu was 21,391 votes ahead of Peres.
</P>
<P>
According to the Israeli regulations, the result will not be
final until the last vote is counted. Observers here say the
result is likely to be announced later today.

<HEADLINE> Sales for Children's Books Surge in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Bringing a set of de luxe edition
children's books home has become a fashion among doting parents in
Beijing as International Children's Day approaches.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Juvenile and Children Publishing House has published
up to 100,000 copies of each of three hardback cartoon books.
</P>
<P>
A million copies of another 40 new books have also been
published at the house as Children's Day gifts.
</P>
<P>
Some high-quality children's books, such as the children's
edition of the Romance of Three Kingdoms and the Dream of Red
Chamber, cost 200 to 300 yuan for one set.
</P>
<P>
But Xidan Children's Bookstore sold more than 200 sets of the
books within a couple of days.
</P>
<P>
A shopping center in Chaoyang district will sell thousands of
children's books with five percent discount on June 1st --
Children's Day.
</P>
<P>
Beijing Cartoon, the first cartoon monthly of pure Chinese
style, will publish a color edition of its most popular stories
during the children festival.
</P>
<P>
Books with colorful covers and nice illustrations help to
promote children's interests in reading and are easier to
preserve, said a manager from Writer's Publishing House.
</P>
<P>
The de luxe edition of books has become the most popular gift
and also something like a decoration on bookshelves among
Beijingers whose quality of life has improved, said an employee at
a Beijing bookstore.
</P>
<P>
Books are much better gifts for children than any of the
delicacies, said a senior scholar.

<HEADLINE> NP to Win Big Victory in Western Cape's Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The National Party (NP)
seemed set to be heading for victory in most of the six
sub-structures of the Cape Metropole in the Western Cape
Province's local government elections held on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
By 10:00 am this morning, the NP had captured 73 ward seats
and the African National Congress (ANC) had 41, while the minor
parties and independents had managed to secure only eight ward
seats, according to the Central Provincial Election Control
Center.
</P>
<P>
However, the NP already wrapped up the major share of the
votes in the rural areas of the province on Thursday. It took 147
of the 216 proportional representation seats on the 27 rural
councils.
</P>
<P>
The ANC took 61 and the independents eight.
</P>
<P>
Although the results of the proportional votes have yet been
finalized, all indications showed that the NP's majority would
also manifest itself there.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the ANC hopefully looks set to win the important
central sub-structure, which is the biggest in terms of voter
numbers.
</P>
<P>
A feature of the results so far has been the dismal
performance of the smaller parties, the Democratic Party, Freedom
Front, Conservative Party, Pan Africanist Congress and African
Christian Democratic Party and independents.
</P>
<P>
Voters have clearly polarized between the NP and ANC.
</P>
<P>
The final results are expected later today or early on
Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading U.S. newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Washington Post:
</P>
<P>
-- By the most slender of margins, a deeply divided Israeli
electorate appears to have chosen right-wing Likud party leader
Benyamin Netanyahu as prime minister, ousting incumbent Shimon
Peres and bringing new uncertainty to the Middle East and its
fragile peace process.
</P>
<P>
-- The United States and its allies are poised to announce a
major change of military doctrine by making it possible for
European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization to
launch their own military operations rather than always relying on
America for leadership.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The Air Force said that three commanders had been relieved
of their duties as a result of an investigation into the plane
crash in Croatia that killed Commerce Secretary Ronald Brown and
34 others.
</P>
<P>
-- Shaken by what might well be the defeat of one of its
closest allies, the Clinton Administration struggled Thursday to
put the best face on Israel's election results and to reach out to
Benjamin Netanyahu, the challenger whom President Clinton had all
but campaigned against.
</P>
<P>
The Wall Street Journal:
</P>
<P>
-- Clinton backed curfews for young people as a way to cut
crime. In a speech to a predominantly black audience in New
Orleans, the president said curfews as early as 8 p.m. for
children under 17 would add "structure and discipline" to their
lives.

<HEADLINE> Namibia, Russia Sign Military Aid Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Namibia and Russia have
signed a military cooperation agreement, under which Russia will
assist Namibia Defence Force (NDF) with training and equipment,
the South African Press Association reported today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement followed Namibian Defence Minister Philemon
Malima's visit to Russia in April and subsequent negotiations
between the two countries, said the report.
</P>
<P>
A Namibian newspaper in Windhoek on Friday quoted Malima as
saying that the agreement provided for training of NDF officers
by Russian armed forces either in Namibia or Russia, repairing
and maintenance of equipment procured from Russia and cooperation
in other military fields.
</P>
<P>
However, the minister declined to go into details about what
kind of equipment namibia was interested in obtaining.
</P>
<P>
Malima pointed out that namibia is a young country in terms of
establishing a defence force and said that when south africa
withdrew prior to namibia's independence in 1990, all military
equipment was withdrawn as well.
</P>
<P>
''Namibia was left without even a single helicopter, without a
single vessel to patrol the coast and without armoured
equipment,'' said the minister.
</P>
<P>
The agreement would increase the combat readiness of the NDF
and also support the ''military industrial complex'' of Russia,
said Sergei Svechnikov, Chairman of Russia's State Committee on
Technical-Military policy, who has signed the agreement.

<HEADLINE> Coalition of Philippine Parties Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Laban Ng Demokratikong Pilipino
(LDP), one of the major political parties in the Philippines,
today broke up with the ruling Lakas-Nucd chaired by President
Fidel Ramos to become the country's largest opposition party.
</P>
<P>
The LDP's decision to dissolve its coalition with the
administration was made at its national congress in a bid to
strengthen itself in preparation for the 1998 presidential
elections.
</P>
<P>
The coalition of the two parties, namely, the Lakas-laban
Compact for Change, was forged in August 1994, in order "to put
the nation on a firmer road to progress and to attain the vision
of Philippine 2000."
</P>
<P>
The breakup was triggered by former senate president Edgardo
Angara's ouster in a coup that took place on August 25, 1995.
</P>
<P>
Angara had accused the presidential palace of instigating his
ouster allegedly to remove a major stumbling block to amending the
constitution in order to allow Ramos to perpetuate himself to
power.
</P>
<P>
However, Ramos denied he had a hand in the senate putsch,
describing it as a purely internal matter in that legislative
chamber.
</P>
<P>
Angara, who was re-elected as the LDP's chairman at the
congress, said that the breakup has opened up a new era for the
LDP.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos said in a statement, "I am saddened by this
event."
</P>
<P>
He urged the country's political parties to put politics behind
and buckle down to work, "as a national team in the arena of
international competition."

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Hu Jintao, a member of the Standing
Committee of Political Bureau of CPC (Communist Party of China)
Central Committee, called communist cadres at all levels to
provide a steady political guarantee to China's reforms and
opening-up, by carrying out all the party's policies to the letter.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a graduation ceremony of the Party School of CPC
Central Committee, Hu urged the graduates of 72 ministerial- and
provincial-level officials to further improve their "ideological
and political quality" and comply with the basic policies of the
central government.
</P>
<P>
Hu, also the president of the party school, emphasized that the
principles of sticking to a politically correct stand and
unswervingly supporting the reforms and opening-up should be
maintained by every party member as a "valuable tradition of the
party."
</P>
<P>
The 72 senior officials studied works of Karl Marx, founder of
the Communism, Lenin and late Chairman Mao Zedong in a refresher
course which began on March 1.
</P>
<P>
Deng Xiaoping's theories on construction of socialism with
Chinese characteristics, and policies issued by the latest plenary
meeting of the 14th Central Committee of CPC were other two
important parts of the course.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The scientist who designed China's
first atom bomb was today elected head of the country's largest
non-governmental scientific organization.
</P>
<P>
Zhou Guangzhao, the noted Chinese theoretical physicist, was

Zhou, who also invented China's hydrogen bomb, is already
president of the prestigious Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The 67-year-old scientist said he would try to fulfill his new
mission to spread modern scientific and technological knowledge.
</P>
<P>
Zhou was the director of the China's Institute of Nuclear
Weapons in 1960s and was awarded the top prize of the national
natural sciences along with seven other pioneers of Chinese
nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
In early 1980s, Zhou left the nuclear weapons institute and
devoted himself to the study of theoretical physics in the the
institute of theoretical physics under the Chinese Academy of
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Zhou's outstanding work in particle and statistical physics has

</P>
<P>
In recent years, Zhou shifted his focus to the country's
social-economic problems.
</P>
<P>

country's environment, population, grain production, natural
resources and transportation.
</P>
<P>
"Sustainable development is the only choice for China," he

<HEADLINE> "Gold Bridge Project" Proves Fruitful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A total of 133 projects, 66
institutions and 41 individuals were commended today by the China
Association for Science and Technology for their contribution to
the adoption of advanced technology in production.
</P>
<P>
CAST decided to carry out a "Gold Bridge Project" in February
1993. The project aimed at setting up bridges between science
workers and economic construction, and giving full play to the
role of associations for science and technology across the country
in a bid to promote the application of scientific achievements and
the spread of hi-technology.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years more than 3.4 million people have been
involved in the "Gold Bridge Project".
</P>
<P>
More than 56,600 projects have been carried out, yielding 38.4
billion yuan worth of economic returns and saving 24.1 billion
yuan.
</P>
<P>
The projects are in line with market demands, need less
investment and produce higher returns, a CAST official said. He
added that the project has created a good environment for the
application of scientific achievements, promoted the adoption of
agricultural technology as well as the development of information
industries.

<HEADLINE> Chinese People Oppose Splitting Plots, Says Liu Huaqing  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Liu Huaqing, vice-chairman of the
Central Military Commission said today that the Chinese people are
determinedly against any plots to split China.
</P>
<P>
He made the remark at a meeting in Beijing with Vice-Admiral
Willy Herteleer, chief of the general staff of the Belgian armed
forces, who is on a week-long visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that some people in the world are not only trying to
play up the so-called "China threat", but also attempting to split
China, which is strongly opposed by the Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
"Taiwan and Tibet are inalienable parts of the Chinese
territory," Liu said.
</P>
<P>
"Advocating the so-called 'China threat' and conspiracy of
splitting Taiwan and Tibet from China not only hurts China, but
also harms world peace, stability and development," he added.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the mistaken belief that a developed and
stronger China will pose a threat to other countries results from
lack of knowledge of both China's history and the current
situation.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese people, who had been inflicted by the invasion and
pillage of foreign powers, are peace-loving people; they are
focusing efforts on the uphill task of building their country
economically and doing their own things well," Liu emphasized.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's modernization drive needs domestic
stability and an international environment of lasting peace.
</P>
<P>
"China is willing to develop friendly relations with countries
all over the world on the basis of the five principles of peaceful
co-existence," he noted.

<TEXT>
<P>
He said China's economy has been developing rapidly and
people's living standards are improving, as a result of the
implementation of reform and opening-up under the guidance of Deng
Xiaoping's theory of "building socialism with Chinese
characteristics."
</P>
<P>
However, Liu said, China still lags behind developed countries
in the world because of its big population, vast area and poor
economic basis.
</P>
<P>
"It will take decades of hard work before China can reach the
level of moderate economic development," he added.
</P>
<P>
On Sino-Belgian relations, Liu said that there have been good
developments in political, economic and other fields.
</P>
<P>
"The two countries, though different in ideology, social
system, history and cultural tradition, share many views under the
current situation of multi-polarization in the world, and wish
that the next century would be a century of peace and stability,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, he said, there exist great prospects for the
friendly relations between the two governments, two peoples and
two armed forces.
</P>
<P>
Herteleer said this has been his first visit abroad since
assuming the post last year and he was happy to have this
opportunity.
</P>
<P>
China is a permanent member of the U.N. Security Council, he
said, and Belgium attaches great importance to China's positions
and views in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
He said he was deeply impressed by China's economic successes
and the training and development of its armed forces. He hopes
that more Belgians will come to visit China and thus understand
China, and leaders of the two armed forces will increase exchanges
with an aim to deepen friendship and strengthen cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He also expressed understanding of China's national defense
policy of active defense and China's yearning for unification,
peace, stability and development.
</P>
<P>
His Chinese counterpart Fu Quanyou attended the meeting.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Government Unveils Agricultural Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- For the first time since
independence in 1980, Zimbabwe has produced agricultrual
development policy which should lead the country to achieve full
agricultural potential within 25 years.
</P>
<P>
The 116-page document unveiled today by Agriculture Minister
Denis Norman says that coming before the second phase of economic
reform program, the policy will provide " a more clearer focus
for the agricultural sector in this country.''
</P>
<P>
Previous policies have been fragmented and did very little to
spur agricultural growth that remained at 2.5 percent per annum,
short of the government target of 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The agricultural development policy hopes to change
small-holder agriculture into a fully commercial farming system,
increasing total agricultural output that should be larger than
population growth.
</P>
<P>
The policy also seeks to develop physical and social
infrastructure in the rural areas as well as development of
sustainable farming systems which should reverse current
environmental degradation and soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
''The great potential for growth in the agricultural sector
will be fully developed in order to stimulate the overall growth
of the economy, alleviate poverty and hunger, and generate high
rural incomes, jobs, raws material supplies and foreign exchange
earnings,'' the policy document says.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe's 10.5 million population is largely rural, and save
for the few white and black commercial farmers, most of the
communal farmers till the land for subsistence and not for
monetary gain.
</P>
<P>
However, in years of inadequate rainfall, the government has
been forced to import food for the communal farmers and national
reserves and the policy seeks to bring an end to this practice.

<HEADLINE> Baby-Friendly Action On the Rise in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- About 3,000 "baby-friendly"
hospitals have been established throughout China, marking a rise
in the country's support of increased health care for newborns.
</P>
<P>
Breast feeding is advocated in 2,957 hospitals, far surpassing
the goal of 1,000 set for 1995, according to the latest report
from the Ministry of Public Health.
</P>
<P>
China's breast feeding rate in urban and rural areas also has
risen from 30 percent in the 1990s to 64 percent in 1994. The
national goal for the year 2,000 is 80 percent, the report
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Ministry officials attributed the progress to a successful
breast feeding promotion campaign that has gained the support of
the government, the public health departments and medical workers.
</P>
<P>
China's baby-friendly movement originated in 1992, when the
World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's
Fund (Unicef) called on establishment of baby-friendly hospitals
around the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government promised to raise the rate of breast
feeding among newborns in its Program for Development of Chinese
Children in the 1990s, published in 1992.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the first group of 21 baby-friendly hospitals were
formed in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai and nine other cities.
</P>
<P>
Although Chinese women have a long tradition of breast feeding,
the breast feeding rate dropped greatly in recent years, said Feng
Huimin from the Department of Maternal and Child Health under the
Public Health Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Many mothers wrongly believed that substitute food for mother's
milk, such as various kinds of milk powder available on the
market, was more nutritious than breast milk, Feng explained.
</P>
<P>
"So we have joined hands with local governments and the news
media to publicize benefit and correct methods of breast feeding
among Chinese residents, especially new mothers," she said.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, training programs to organize
baby-friendly hospitals have been conducted by 420,000
gynecologists, obstetricians, pediatricians, nurses and midwives,
as well as 360,000 rural doctors.
</P>
<P>
China has created province-level and state-level systems to
certify baby-friendly hospitals, which are asked to meet strict
standards, such as 24-hour mother-and-infant accommodations and
sterile conditions for women in labor.
</P>
<P>
The Public Health Ministry last year published a regulation on
management of substitute food for mother's milk, since breast
feeding received criticism in advertisements from milk powder
producers.
</P>
<P>
"We are planning for another nationwide check on such products
in the second half of this year," Feng said.

<HEADLINE> Dalian Raises People out of Poverty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Dalian, a port city in northeast
China's Liaoning Province, has issued more than one million yuan
(about 120,000 US dollars) to poor families since last January.
</P>
<P>
A survey indicated that 15,000 people, or one tenth of the
city's total population, failed to rise above the government-set
poverty line, with an monthly income of 145 yuan per capita.
</P>
<P>
The government said that people living under the poverty line
have the right to apply to the neighborhood committee to get
financial assistance. A poor family can get from five yuan to 470
yuan monthly.
</P>
<P>
The system, praised by the Ministry of Civil Affairs as "Dalian
Mode," is being implemented nationwide.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, other cities also have carried out social
security systems. In most cases, enterprises that follow the
government's order to issue relief funds to poor families have
increased the burdens of unprofitable enterprises.
</P>
<P>
But in Dalian, it is the government that provides money for
social security, a case believed to be rare in China.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of the relief fund is covered by the city
government's budget, while the rest is handled by the district
government.
</P>
<P>
In addition to relief funds, the government has provided
favorable food prices and housing rents to poor families, and free
education for their children.
</P>
<P>
The system primarily guarantees assistance for the young and
old, and the weak, sick and disabled, officials said.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- An International Monetary Fund (IMF)
official said here today that the IMF will support the
Philippines' economic program "without any reservations."
</P>
<P>
Khadim Al-eyd, head of a visiting IMF mission, made the remarks
after concluding his review of the country's economic performance
Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and the Philippine government had reached agreement on
an economic and financial program for 1996, aiming to strengthen
the transformation of the current recovery into a sustained
economic expansion.
</P>
<P>
Al-eyd expressed satisfaction with the Philippines' economic
growth for the first quarter of 1996 even though the "growth was
less than expected."
</P>
<P>
He also said while the country's gross domestic product
remained flat at 4.7 percent, "overall it is in line with the
program target."
</P>
<P>
Al-eyd was confident that the country's export situation would
pick up as it already shows a visible improvement over that of a
year ago.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines' gross national product (GNP) target this year
is set at between 6.5 percent and 7.5 percent and the average

in the rural areas of Western Cape in Wednesday's local
government elections, early results of the counting indicated
yesterday.

work on a detailed program for peace in the strife-torn province.
</P>
<P>

-- It was not strictly true that the new constitution meant
the end of power-sharing, constitutional assembly chairman and
African National Congress (ANC) Secretary General Cyril Ramaphosa
said yesterday.
</P>
<P>
-- Increasing costs and rampant crime had put the brakes on
the tourist boom, with the record 58 percent increase in visitors
in the first quarter of 1995 slumping to only a 3.4 percent
improvement in the first three months this year, said figures
released by the central statistical services yesterday.

<HEADLINE> Tobacco Levy Collected in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- About 2.5 million U.S. Dollars have
so far been collected from Zimbabwe's tobacco farmers since the
new special tax imposed on sales of the crop at auction floors
was gazetted two weeks ago, the Daily Herald reported today.
</P>
<P>
The tobacco levy, to be collected by the tobacco sales floor
and handed over to the government, was being collected amid heavy
criticism from local growers and the African region of the
International Tobacco Growers' Association.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 200,000 Dollars was being collected everyday, said
Deputy Managing Director of the Tobacco Sales Floor Patrick
Devenish.
</P>
<P>
"It's a double taxation. It should be tax-deducted," said
Devenish.
</P>
<P>
The levy was over and above the normal taxes the growers paid
to the department of taxes.
</P>
<P>
Devenish said the strength of the Zimbabwe Tobacco Industry
was when growers ran a free and unfetted auction. Without any
form of the government controls or guarantees, Zimbabwe Auction
Floors would set world price of tobacco.
</P>
<P>
"This levy will certainly affect the viability of the tobacco
market," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwe accounts for 5 percent of world tobacco production,
but it accounts for 25 percent of the crop's exports. It
contributes over 30 percent of zimbabwe's foreign exchange
earnings.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean farmers expected to produce 200 million kilograms
of tobacco this season, earning the country about 700 million
U.S. Dollars.

<HEADLINE> EU To Strengthen Ties with HK After 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) pledged
to maintain strong relations with Hong Kong after July 1, 1997
when China resumes its exercises of sovereignty over the
territory.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon Brittan, vice president of the European Commission
said: "The flag that will be folded next June is the flag of one
of our member states, but Hong Kong will continue to be an
autonomous focus for commercial and cultural exchanges between
Europe and Asia."
</P>
<P>
The EU official in charge of external relations and trade
policy made the remarks here today when addressing a luncheon,
jointly organized by the European Chambers and Business
Association in Hong Kong and the Hong Kong General Chamber of
Commerce.
</P>
<P>
"From the point of view of the European Union, our future
relationship with the Special Administrative Region (SAR) of Hong
Kong will be an essential part of our relationship with China, as
well as an important element of our Asia strategy generally, "
said Sir Leon in his speech titled "Europe and Hong Kong:
Prospects for Cooperation into the Next Century".
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Europe has a huge stake in Hong Kong's
continued effective operation, and that is why the Union formally
confirmed European support for a smooth and successful transition
for Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
According to Sir Leon, about 50,000 EU citizens are living and
working in Hong Kong and last year over a million visitors to the
territory came from Europe.
</P>
<P>
Currently Europe has over 40 banks, 40 insurance companies and
100 industrial establishments in Hong Kong, and nine European
airlines fly regularly to the territory. More than 100 European
companies are involved in the construction of the new airport and
related infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the EU vice president said, Hong Kong is a
natural springboard for business activities in the rest of Asia,
and a gateway for European investment to China.
</P>
<P>
"It will be our policy, in the context of our ever-increasing
cooperation with China, to strengthen and not to reduce our links
with this territory, and with the future SAR," said Sir Leon.
</P>
<P>
According to the official, there are many practical matters on
which the EU and the HKSAR can continue and develop their
cooperation, such as customs matters, standards, high technology,
trade and investment liberalization.
</P>
<P>
Sir Leon arrived here Thursday after a trip to Beijing and will
meet with Hong Kong government officials during his two-day stay
here. He will make a short stopover at Macao Saturday before
flying to Sydney, Australia.

<HEADLINE> Beirut Press Worry over Peace Process after </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A prospective victory of Benjamin
Netanyahu, leader of the Israeli rightwing Likud Party, in his
competition for the premiership with incumbent Prime Minister
Shimon Peres, has arosed worries of the Beirut press today.
</P>
<P>
In an editorial, the Beirut largest-circulated daily An-Nahar
expressed hope that Netanyahu's win in the Israeli general
elections would not be a "disaster."
</P>
<P>
Speculating about the impact of the new development on the
Middle East peace process, especially on the Syrian-Israeli and
Lebanese-Israeli tracks, the daily believed that the process
could not be aborted since it had been moving ahead along a road
on which there is no return.
</P>
<P>
It also noted that the peace process could not be as fast as
what had been expected in case of Peres' success in the
elections. "It will probably take a long time," the daily said.
</P>
<P>
The paper concluded that "the peace process is in a very
awkward predicament, and not only the Arab but all the parties
concerned are in a dilemma."
</P>
<P>
The leftist daily As-Safir, another popular newspaper in
Beirut, described the would-be results of the Israeli elections
as "a global shock and an explosion taking place in the center of
a circle called the new world order."
</P>
<P>
The paper said in a front-paged editorial that "after the shock
in Israel, a lot of political changes will take place in the
world: in Europe, in Asia, in Africa and even in some Arab
organizations which have been so staunch that they seemed
unchangeable."
</P>
<P>
It expressed fear that the new Israeli cabinet Netanyahu will
form "will include ministers of the invasion of Lebanon,"
reference to the Israeli ministers who were in government when
Israel invaded lebanon in 1982, such as Ariel Sharon, David Levy,
Rophael Eytan and Yitzhak Mordachai.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Syrian daily Ash-Sharq said that the Israeli elections
revealed that the majority of Israeli Jews voted against peace.
</P>
<P>
"If the Likud Party wins, the peace accords signed in Oslo
(with the Palestinians) and in Wadi Araba (with the Jordanians),
even if not the whole peace process, would become precarious and
subject to the whim of Jewish extremism," the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"It shows that (Syrian) President Hafez al-Assad was right in
being reluctant to rush into blind peace with Israel," it added.
"The precarious situation facing Yasser Arafat is an example of
the fate of hasty and rushed settlements."

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Netanyahu Likely to Head Next </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- With 99.9 percent of the votes
counted, Likud's candidate Benjamin Netanyahu, who held a narrow
lead over his opponent, is likely to become Israel's next prime
minister.
</P>
<P>
According to vote counting by early this morning, Netanyahu got
21,391 votes, a lead of 50.3 percent to 49.7 percent, ahead of
Labor's Shimon Peres, current premier, in the closest prime
ministerial race in Israel's history.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu and Peres, meanwhile, both maintained a strict
silence, with Netanyahu not claiming victory and Peres refraining
from taking any steps until the final result of the general
elections is officially declared.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu, nevertheless, was described as confident. He issued
a statement that if he is indeed confirmed as the winner, he will
continue the peace process, honor all of Israel's international
commitments, and strive to heal the rifts in the country.
</P>
<P>
The reason why Peres and Netanyahu have kept silence is that
nearly 150,000 votes cast by soldiers, hospital patients,
prisoners, diplomats, and merchant seamen are to be counted today.
</P>
<P>
The Labor party clung to a hope because of the assumption that
residents of old age homes and nursing facilities and the prison
population are at least half Arab, while, the Likud bloc is
counting on a lead among the soldiers' votes.
</P>
<P>
Experts do not believe Netanyahu's lead can be reversed
because a vast majority of the still uncounted votes come from
Jews, and Netanyahu's lead among Jews was almost 11 percent.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, so far as the Knesset (Israel's parliament) returns
are concerned, the trend of severe cut in the Knesset
representation for larger parties continued, with Labor was pared
down from 44 to 33 and the Likud and Tsomet from 40 to 31.
</P>
<P>
The current totals also show that the religious parties have
amassed an unprecedented 25 mandates, as Shas will have 11 seats,
up from 6, National Religious Party (NRP) 10, also up from 6, and
United Torah Judaism will maintain 4.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu will have no trouble forming a coalition with the
religious bloc, Yisrael Ba'aliya, the new immigrants party which
initially won a projected 7 seats, and the Third Way, a new group
initiated by hawkish Laborites, with 4 mandates.
</P>
<P>
In last Sunday's televised debate with Peres, Netanyahu said
that if elected he would invite Peres to join his cabinet so as
to form a national unity government.
</P>
<P>
However, Netanyahu made it clear to NRP leader Zevulun Hammer
in a phone conversation Thursday that he would not make any move
without the agreement of his "natural coalition parties," and
that he would approach them.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's aide Danny Naveh issued a statement in his name
Thursday, saying that Netanyahu "heard the election returns with
satisfaction, but will not speak about them until the final
results are in."
</P>
<P>
He will consult with his colleagues in the Likud leadership in
the next few days, but will not begin coalition contacts before
his victory is confirmed, said the statement.
</P>
<P>
While Netanyahu's aides denied that any coalition talks are
afoot, speculation was rife in the party, and prevailing opinion
was that Likud would get 10 ministers, Shas and the NRP two each,
the other four portfolios would go to the smaller partners.
</P>
<P>
However, as the final results of the elections are to be
announced late today or Saturday evening, the Israeli people,
particularly Peres and Netanyahu, will have to wait and see who
will become the new prime minister.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Settlers Happy with Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Jewish settlers' leaders are
buoyed by the results of the Israeli elections, which saw the
number of members of Knesset (parliament) living in the
settlements rising from three to nine.
</P>
<P>
In addition to five members of Knesset (MKs) from the National
Religious Party who live in the settlements, two Moledet MKs and
other two MKs from the Yisrael Ba'aliya and the Third Way now live
over the Green Line.
</P>
<P>
Aharron Domb, the spokesman for the Council of Jewish
Communities in Jedea, Samaria and Gaza Strip, said that the high
percentage of members of Knesset living in the settlements will
obviously boost the cause of the settlers who have fought
tooth-and-nail with the current government over the last four
years.
</P>
<P>
The settlers are also encouraged by the apparent victory of
hardline Likud challenger Benjamin Netanyahu, who has pledged to
invest over 400 million U.S. dollars in expanding Jewish
settlements in Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
"The first and most important change," said Yechiel Leiter, a
spokesman for the Settlement Council, "is one of terminology. We
will no longer be the bad boys of Israel, demonized and
delegitimized by our own leaders."
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Netanyahu's government, possibly to be formed
after the official declaration of the elections results, Leiter
called it "a friend at the helm, not someone who wants to
terminate our existence."
</P>
<P>
According to the Central Bureau of Statistics figures, settlers
make up some 2 percent of the Israeli population, while residents
of the settlements will now make up 7.5 percent of the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
The current government led by Shimon Peres has frozen
expansion of Jewish settlements in Palestinian territories to
pursue peace with the Palestinians.

<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-President Rong Yiren
met today with Pedro Sousa Macedo, president of the Supreme Court
of Justice of Portugal, saying he believed Sino-Portuguese
cooperation on the issue of Macao will continue.
</P>
<P>
China and Portugal have shown willingness to cooperate since
the two countries signed a joint statement on Macao in 1987. The
issuance of currency by the Bank of China in Macao and the use of
the Macao International Airport are results of mutual cooperation,
Rong said.
</P>
<P>
He believed that any remaining issues that arise could be
settled through joint efforts.
</P>
<P>
Bilateral relations, both political and economic, have
developed successfully during the past 17 years, ever since the
two countries first forged diplomatic ties.
</P>
<P>
Frequent visits to each other's country by senior leaders have
played an important role in advancing bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
Rong was satisfied with the progressive attitude shown by the
courts of the two countries, saying the contacts between them
would be another step toward promoting and strengthening bilateral
ties.
</P>
<P>
Macedo said the development of the Macao region is one
indication of the shared understanding between Portugal and
China. Portugal's judicial circles will contribute to the
continued cooperation between the two countries on the Macao
issue, he said.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Pledges Deepening Economic, Political Reforms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
pledged further economic and political reforms Friday in a
re-election manifesto.
</P>
<P>
The program, a text of which was issued in Moscow, was unveiled
by Yeltsin in a rally in the Urals Mountain city of Perm.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin, 65, issued his program amid widespread discontent over
the impact of five years of market reforms.
</P>
<P>
Opinion polls showed Yeltsin ahead of his Communist challenger
Gennady Zyuganov in the run-up to the June 16 vote. Yeltsin and
Zyuganov are far ahead of the nine other candidates for the
Russian presidency.
</P>
<P>
"I feel your pain, the pain of the country. But this is the
pain of a recovering organism," Yeltsin said in the document.
</P>
<P>
He also promised to protect the domestic market and get ride of
the budget deficit by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
On Chechnya, Yeltsin said the Russian leadership remained open
for talks with anyone, he reiterated Moscow's uncompromising line
over the status of the breakaway region, saying it remained an
integral part of the federation.
</P>
<P>
Zyuganov's program, announced last week, called for an overhaul
of Yeltsin's privatization plan, more subsidies to state
enterprises and a restoration of the Soviet era social safety net.
</P>
<P>
Also on Friday, Zyuganov said in a front-page interview in the
Pravda daily: "The least one can say is there is little that is
left in the president's hands ... The authorities are not
working. Laws are passed but they don't work."

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu to Form Coalition within Two Weeks after </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Even before the announcement of
the the final results of the Israeli elections, Likud challenger
Benjamin Netanyahu, the apparent winner, has plans in hands
to form a coalition within two weeks.
</P>
<P>
With the counting of the regular votes completed Thursday,
Netanyahu has a razor-thin edge of 50.3 to 49.6 percent over
incumbent Prime Minister Shimon Peres.
</P>
<P>
The Central Election Committee (CEC) officials said the
committee began this morning the counting of the 150,000 special
votes and the final results will come out this afternoon before
the Shabbat (the Jewish day of rest that starts sundown Friday
and ends Saturday night).
</P>
<P>
However, if things do not go smoothly the CEC can only resume
the counting work Saturday night after the end of the Shabbat and
the final results will thus be known on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
But experts believe the chances that the remaining 150,000
votes will change the present results of the prime ministerial
elections are very slight, if not impossible.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu spent the entire day Thursday in the Tel Aviv Hilton
Hotel with his wife Sara. While refusing to talk with the press,
he was busy holding meetings with his campaigning partners,
including Gesher's leader David Levy and Tsomet's head Rafael
Eitan, and other party officials, possibly on discussing plans to
form the next government.
</P>
<P>
The Likud leader convened Thursday night a meeting of the
party's Steering Committee and decided to open contacts with
religious parties to form a coalition government.
</P>
<P>
He intended to establish a coalition government within two
weeks after he is officially declared the winner.
</P>
<P>
Reports said that the two most likely candidates for the new
Defense Minister are Dan Meridor and Yitzhak Mordechai. David
Levy, former foreign minister in Yitzhak Shamir's Likud government
is expected to be renamed, while Ariel Sharon will be appointed
finance minister.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu will not have any trouble in forming a coalition
with the religious bloc, Yisrael Ba'aliya and the Third Way,
which will have a combined majority of 63 seats in the 120-seat
Knesset, or parliament.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that Netanyahu will allocated three seats in
the new cabinet for the Shas and National Religious Party
respectively, two for Yisrael Ba'aliya and one for the Third Way.
</P>
<P>
Likud leaders said that the peace process will continue under
Netanyahu's government, but the security consideration will be of
prime importance.
</P>
<P>
It's widely regarded that Netanyahu's win will set back the
Middle East peace process, as he has pledged to take a tougher
line in any future negotiations with Israel's Arab neighbors, while
rejecting the land-for-peace principle endorsed by the current
government.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton, in his first reaction to Israel's
elections, said Thursday that the U.S. peace efforts in the Middle
East will remain the same no matter who wins the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat plans
to meet with Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak and Jordanian King
Hussein in the Jordanian Red Sea city of Aqaba Wednesday to assess
the possible implications of the Israeli elections.
</P>
<P>
A tripartite summit between Arafat, Hussein and Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak was planned before the elections, but it
will take on extra urgency in view of the possible emergence of a
hardline Israeli government. Arafat has so far kept silence to the
apparent victory of Netanyahu, who has vowed never to talk with
him.

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Mass Killer Suspects Appear in Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The International Court for
Rwanda (ICTR) held its first session in Arusha, north Tanzania on
Thursday to deal with Georges Anderson Nderuhumwe Rutaganda, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Rutaganda who was alleged to be involved in the genocide of
up to one million Rwandans in 1994, sat impassively in the court
as the eight counts were read out.
</P>
<P>
He is accused of arming Hutu extremists in April, 1994 and
ordering the murder of Tutsi civilians with machetes, guns and
grenades and by drowning. Some of the victims had to dig their
own graves, the prosecution alleged.
</P>
<P>
President of the tribunal, Senegalese Judge Laity Kama
adjourned the trial until October 3, this year after the defense
requested time to visit Rwanda to gather evidence.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. ICTR was set up in 1994 after the slaughter of
minority Tutsis and moderate Hutus between April and June by Hutu
troops, militiamen and mobs.
</P>
<P>
Rutaganda and two other Hutus were detained in Zambia last
year and extradited to Arusha on May 21, this year.
</P>
<P>
Tribunal officials said similar charges against Jean Paul
Akayesu were read out on Thursday afternoon and those against
Clement Kayishem would be read today.
</P>
<P>
The tribunal wants to extradite about 10 more Rwandan suspects
in custody around the world and is investigating dozens more
Hutus in exile in Africa and Europe.
</P>
<P>
Rutaganda's indictment says he was a member of leading
committee of the Republican National Movement for Development and
Democracy (MRND), led by late President Juvenal Habyarimana whose
killing on April 6, 1994, triggered the Rwanda genocide.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Rutaganda used to be an agricultural engineer, a
shareholder in Rwanda's radio television +Libre des Mille
Collines", whose broadcasts fuelled the genocide, and the second
vice-president of the national committee of the "Interahamwe",
the youth militia of the MRND.

<HEADLINE> Final Results of Israeli Elections May Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Central Election Committee
(CEC) this morning began the counting of the 150,000 special votes
and the final results will come out this afternoon, said CEC
officials.
</P>
<P>
However, if things do not go smoothly as expected, CEC can only
resume the counting work Saturday night after the Shabbat ends and
the final results will thus be known on Sunday, according to the
officials,
</P>
<P>
Currently, Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu is leading Prime
minister Shimon Peres by some 21,000 votes. In order to change
the results, Peres would have to get 57 percent of the
outstanding votes. The last of the soldiers' ballots arrived at
the Knesset Thursday morning via helicopter.
</P>
<P>
Theoretically, the election results are not yet final.
However, experts believe, the chances that the remaining 150,000
votes will change the results of the prime ministerial elections
are very slight, if not impossible.
</P>
<P>
The majority of the outstanding votes -- 100,000 or more
-- belong to soldiers. For security reasons, the army refused
to say how many soldiers voted, but stressed that every
soldier was to be given the opportunity to vote. Statisticians
say that traditionally a slim majority of soldiers voted for
right-wing parties in the past, but it is unclear how the
troops' balloting will be this time since the electoral reform
may have altered the trend.
</P>
<P>
Jacob Levy, president of Gallup Israel, stressed that soldiers,
like other young Israelis, are traditionally more right-wing. In
the past, he said, some 70 percent of voters between the ages of
18 and 35 have favored the right.
</P>
<P>
Late Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin's assassination reduced this
imbalance, he said, but did not eliminate it. He said 55 percent
to 60 percent of young voters still lean right.
</P>
<P>
Even if Peres were to obtain a small majority, it would not be
enough, he added.
</P>
<P>
Rafi Smith, co-head of the Rafi and Hanoch Smith polling
center, agreed that despite the influence of Rabin's murder, the
soldiers are still likely to vote for the right. He added that
the race is still very close, but the likehood of the results
being changed is almost non-existent.
</P>
<P>
The remaining ballots are of hospital patients, prisoners, and
a handful of sailors and diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Prisoners are also a group which tends to lean right, Levy
noted. The Arab prisoners can be expected to vote Peres, he said,
but a majority of the remainder are lower-class Sephardim -- a
group that traditionally has supported Likud. While diplomats are
traditionally left-leaning, they are few in number, only a few
hundred -- too small a part of the remaining votes to have much
impact.

<HEADLINE> Uganda to Export 3 Million Bags of Coffee </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Uganda will export 3-3.5 million
bags of coffee during the year starting July this year, reported
the local daily "the New Vision" today.
</P>
<P>
This will be about 25 percent of the export quotas allocated
to Africa by the Council of the Association of Coffee Producing
Countries (ACPC) meeting in London last week.
</P>
<P>
A circular to exporters by the Uganda Coffee Development
Authority dated May 27 was quoted as saying the ACPC council
approved a new program to restrict exports from member countries
to 53.55 million bags (60 kilograms per bag).
</P>
<P>
"If we added to this figure exports of approximately 15
million bags from non-ACPC countries, total green coffee exports
for 1996/97 are estimated at 69 million bags," the circular said.
</P>
<P>
"This would be in line with consumption needs in importing
countries for the period," it noted.
</P>
<P>
Uganda is Africa's second largest coffee producer only after
Cote d'Ivoire. Coffee has been its biggest foreign exchange
earner.

<HEADLINE> 312 KG of Heroin Confiscated in Yunnan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Police in Yunnan Province have
confiscated a total of 312 kilograms of heroin and 94 km of opium
and arrested a number of drug smugglers since the nationwide
crackdown on criminal offenders began in late April.
</P>
<P>
A senior police officer said that drug traffickers in northern
Myanmar are using Yunnan Province in southwest China as a major
channel for exporting drugs.
</P>
<P>
The officer said that police officers have taken tough measures
to crack down on drug smugglers and traffickers.
</P>
<P>
In late April police officers in Longling County seized 138 kg
of heroin from a truck hired by two Hong Kong drug traffickers who
bought the drug in northern Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
In early May, they arrested two Hong Kong traffickers and one
mainland trafficker in Guangzhou, the capital of Guandong Province.
</P>
<P>
From March 27 to April 17, police officers in Simao Prefecture
solved a case involving the smuggling of 107 kg of heroine, and
arrested six traffickers.
</P>
<P>
Urban and rural residents also are helping police track drug
smugglers and traffickers.
</P>
<P>
For example, farmers in Songpo Village, Yonghe Township,
Yongping County, informed the police of several drug
traffickers. As a result, police officers arrested five
traffickers and confiscated 17 kg of heroin.

TOKYO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A former executive of a public sewage
concern, 17 employees of nine heavy electric machinery companies
and the companies themselves have been convicted in a 1993
bid-rigging case, a Kyodo News Service report said Friday.
</P>
<P>
The nine companies were ordered by the Tokyo High Court to pay
fines totaling 460 million yen for rigging bids for contracts for
electric equipment awarded by the Japan Sewage Works Agency in
violation of the Antimonopoly Law.
</P>
<P>
This is a wicked criminal act committed jointly by public and
private entities over public works projects that are deeply
related to the people's daily life, Presiding Judge Tadaharu Kanda
at the high court said in his ruling on this bid-rigging case, the
first of its kind in the country involving public tenders.
</P>
<P>
The nine companies are Hitachi Ltd., Toshiba Corp., Mitsubishi
Electric Corp., Fuji Electric Co., Meidensha Corp.,Yaskawa
Electric Corp., Nissin Electric Co., Shinko Electric Co. and
Takaoka Electric Mfg. Co.
</P>

XINING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A 5,700-year-old painted pottery
basin featuring a design of two men carrying an object was
recently unearthed in northwest China's Qinghai Province.

<HEADLINE> US Waste Shipments to China Arousing Wide Repercussions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The United States' shipments of
harmful waste to Beijing, Shanghai, Qingdao and some other cities
has aroused indignation among the Chinese, who share a view that
the US has seriously infringed human rights by repeatedly shifting
waste to China and polluting their country's environment.
</P>
<P>
"We could not tolerate the US's shipment of garbage to the
Chinese cities, even to the Chinese capital," said Zhang Liwei,
deputy director of the Pollution Control Department under the
State Bureau of Environmental Protection (SBEP).
</P>
<P>
Although the US has advanced waste treatment capabilities, it
has continuously shipped waste to developing countries, including
China, in a bid to save enormous treatment expenses, Zhang noted.
</P>
<P>
The United States is the largest garbage producer and exporter
in the world, producing more than 200 million tons of domestic
garbage and 2.2 billion tons of industrial wastes annually, and
exporting and dumped more than two million tons of dangerous waste
each year, according to Zhang.
</P>
<P>
The SBEP has issued written notification of its criticism to
the Secretariat of the Basel Convention, he said.
</P>
<P>
The international convention, which was ratified by over 100
countries and regions in 1995, forbids developed countries to
transfer pollution and harmful waste to other countries.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said the US's practice has seriously violated the
convention and the relevant Chinese laws.
</P>
<P>
Xing Demao, director of the Shandong Provincial Bureau for the
Inspection of Import and Export Commodities, said that some
foreign powers are tacitly consenting to, even turning a blind eye
to illegal garbage-shifting activities.
</P>
<P>
"Why do some countries strictly control export of their
advanced technology and equipment, but openly permit the export of
harmful waste they produced?" asked Xing.
</P>
<P>
He said such incidents occurred because of businessmen's
ulterior motives.
</P>
<P>
The number of waste shipment problems has climbed in recent
years, since China increased import volume of discarded paper from
the United States, according to Xing.
</P>
<P>
More than 13,600 tons of substandard waste paper has been found
mixed in with US waste paper imported through Shandong ports since
1991, and also excessive harmful wastes and domestic garbage, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Ju Facheng, deputy director of the bureau, was also critical of
 countries such as the US that praised themselves in regard to
their human rights policies, then repeatedly ship substandard
waste and garbage to China.
</P>
<P>
"What they have done has proved that they in fact dumped
garbage into China under the pretext of exporting waste paper," Ju
said.

<HEADLINE> Farm Banks Ready to Shoulder Additional Burden for 'Jusen' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Agricultural financial institutions
in Japan are ready to shoulder an additional financial burden to
help reduce the taxpayers' share of a government scheme to
liquidate the seven failed "jusen" housing loan firms, major
Japanese dailies reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
The dailies, including the Nihon Keizai Shimbun and the
Mainichi Shimbun, quoted a government official as saying the farm
financial institutions are ready to put up more money to help
cover the costs of liquidating the troubled mortgage firms by
giving up part of their interest receipts from loans to the firms.
</P>
<P>
That is, the farm financial organs, the largest creditor group
for the mortgage firms, are prepared to relinquish 60 billion yen
in interest, the portion they are entitled to receive for the
January-March period, the newspapers said.
</P>
<P>
Under the government liquidation scheme, the farm financial
institutions are required to donate only 530 billion yen against
their total "jusen" lending of 5.5 trillion yen while the founding
banks of the mortgage companies are being asked to give up all of
their 3.5 trillion yen worth of claims.
</P>
<P>
The scheme calls for the public to shoulder a combined 685
billion yen.
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister Wataru Kubo on Friday reiterated that he is
ready to hold talks with the banking industry to request
additional contributions for a scheme to liquidate failed "jusen"
housing loan companies.
</P>
<P>
"If necessary, I will meet banking industry leaders," Kubo said
at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
The government scheme calls on the founder banks and creditor
institutions to share losses stemming from the liquidation of the
mortgage loan firms.
</P>
<P>
Under the scheme, however, part of the losses will be covered
by using taxpayers' money.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Power Cut Throws Sri Lanka into Chaos </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A strike by 14,000 employees of the
Sri Lankan Electricity Board has paralyzed almost every sector in
the country,
plunging the nation into chaos and pitch darkness at night in the
past three days.
</P>
<P>
The strikers are protesting the proposed privatization of the
electricity industry and demanding a wage hike in their indefinite
strike, in defiance of the authorities' threat of jail and
forfeiture of property under the Emergency Laws.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in Colombo Thursday, leaders of the trade union
vowed to continue the strike until the government makes a clear
statement on their demands, which center on the call for dropping
the privatization proposal.
</P>
<P>
The leaders were arrested at the meeting by police acting under
the Emergency Laws.
</P>
<P>
Despite the arrests, the strike entered its third day today and
so did the islandwide blackout, adding a hard blow to this country
that has already been suffering from daily power cuts of four to
six hours from March 23.
</P>
<P>
The power cuts were caused by an acute shortage of water as the
Southwest Monsoon rains failed to come this year.
</P>
<P>
By Thursday noon, life had come to a virtual halt in Colombo,
its suburbs and major cities around the country, distressed by
wide-ranging problems including severe water shortage and
transport breakdown.
</P>
<P>
Reports said some patients died in hospitals as operations
could not be conducted while schools and universities are closed.
A government official said most government offices were affected
by the strike.
</P>
<P>
Super markets and shops have had to throw away tons of frozen
food which went spoilt. Shopkeepers said their little businesses
had been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The public transport system is paralyzed as traffic lights
cannot function while commercial establishments, industries and
banks in the country put up shutters for an indefinite period.
</P>
<P>
The reports said factories in the country's export processing
zones are among the worst hit as over 100 factories had to close
down on Wednesday, incurring losses which could run into millions
of rupees.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the zones warned that the crisis could cripple
the entire economy. About 85,000 people were thrown out of
employment overnight.
</P>
<P>
Authorities of the Electricity Board are trying to get at least
one generator working at the Colombo Thermal Plant to supply
electricity to hospitals. But there is fear that the strikers
might have removed vital parts from the plant.
</P>
<P>
Army personnel said they would not rule out sabotage at the
hydro power stations as they were unable to get the stations
function.
</P>
<P>
The government has charged the strikers with preplanning a
sabotage to knock off both hydro and thermal power stations in the
country.
</P>
<P>
Describing the strike as "utterly irresponsible," the
government warned that violators of the Emergency Laws would be
punished harshly as power generation and distribution are
essential services under the law.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania to Get Japanese Rice </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Charge d'Affaires
in Tanzania Shigeyuki Suzuki today promised to give 8,858 tons of
Thai rice to the Minister for Agriculture and Cooperatives to
help alleviate food shortages in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
According to a Japanese Embassy statement, the hand-over will
take place at 11.40 am at the Dar Es Salaam Port.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the food would help ease the crisis created
by drought, floods, pests and the huge influx of refugees from
Burundi and Rwanda into Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
The grant rice amounts to 500 million Yen (about 6.25 governments
US Dollars). An agreement on the provision of the grant was
signed between the two governments on September 25, last year, it
said.
</P>
<P>
The rice would be distributed to the regions of Dar Es Salaam,
Lindi, Mtwara, Mwanza and Zanzibar.
</P>
<P>
"Suzuki hoped that the rice provided would contribute to help
those who are affected by shortage throughout the country,
especially in Pemba of Zanzibar," the statement noted.

<HEADLINE> The "Orphans' Village" in Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- About 10 kilometers to the
southeast of Datong City in North China's Shanxi Province, lies
Xiezhuang Village, the "Orphan's Village," where 77 orphans
account for a frightening percentage in a population of less than
3,000.
</P>
<P>
The orphans live with 52 farmers' families, but have not been
formally adopted: they "belong" to the Datong Welfare House, which
gives the adoptive families a monthly allowance.
</P>
<P>
Guo Rumei and her two orphans, who are two and three years old
respectively, live in a simple house in Xiezhuang. Both boys are
lively, both have harelips, and both were rejected by their
parents for their deformities.
</P>
<P>
At one point, Guo, 57, had six orphans living with her. Four
went to the village school and one is working in Datong. She has
two biological daughters and a son.
</P>
<P>
Dang Fenglan, the orphan working in Datong, is Guo's pride and
joy. Though it's not legally accurate, Guo likes to call the girl
her daughter.
</P>
<P>
In 1971, Guo received Dang when she was only a few days
old. She had a handicapped hand and a strong will, Gui
says. Despite the family's poor economic situation, Guo was
determined to give the girl the best education available.
</P>
<P>
Dang did not disappoint her mother. Eventually, she was
admitted to a vocational school in Taiyuan, the provincial
capital, and now has a good job with the city government of Datong.
</P>
<P>
Asked why she is raising so many orphans, Guo said money is a
major factor -- in the beginning. The 12-yuan monthly allowance
from the welfare house was a big sum in the 1970s, she says. As
she began to bond with the orphans, maternal instincts outweighed
financial benefits.
</P>
<P>
This may explain why Guo's own daughter, Ji Guiying, also
raises two orphans.
</P>
<P>
In another house lives 80-year-old Duan Eernu, a small, thin
high-spirited woman. She is helping her two orphans try on new
sandals she just bought for them in Datong with her allowance from
the welfare house. Her son is named Cao Shunmin, her daughter is
Cao Haixia.
</P>
<P>
A list provided by village officials names 48 foster
mothers. The oldest is 80, and the youngest, 22. Officials say
they are all poor but very kind people.
</P>
<P>
The village authorities also extends help to the orphans: they
are exempt from most of the costs of the village school, and their
parents do not pay for water and electricity.
</P>
<P>
Yan Xiuqing, head of the welfare house, said the unique system
was created several decades ago when the house was suffering from
a shortage of help, inadequate accommodations and a slim budget.
</P>
<P>
The arrangement has proved successful, Yan says, in that the
orphans now can have a complete family with parents, brothers and
sisters.
</P>
<P>
Yan says the city authorities have decided to build a new and
improved welfare house with upgraded facilities for orphans in the
future.

<HEADLINE> Farmers' Earnings Cut in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Recent rains in several parts in
zimbabwe have damaged a lot of cotton, maize and groundnuts and
farmers are set to lose thousands of dollars as the damaged crops
will not qualify for better prices.
</P>
<P>
President of the Zimbabwe Farmers Union Gary Magadzire said
the quality of the cotton crop has severely been affected and
farmers now have very slim chances of having their cotton
classified in grade a, for which high returns are realized.
</P>
<P>
This also applies to the maize crop which was soaked and
stained, adversely affecting its grade.
</P>
<P>
Small-scale cotton growers are expected to produce 145,000
tons while commercial farmers would contribute 75,000 tons, but
these hopes of an increased production and improved crop quality
seem to have been dashed by the rains which took farmers as well
as officials by surprise.
</P>
<P>
Most farmers in the communal areas had left their maize and
groundnuts to dry and the rains caught them unawares with nowhere
to properly store their crop. The net effect of the recent rains
would be a reduction in the total amount of maize farmers are
expected to deliver to the grain marketing board.
</P>
<P>
However, the farmers are pleased that the sun is now shining
and they hoped some crops would be saved.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Jobless Rate Returns to Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Japan's jobless rate reversed a
falling trend in February and March and jumped back to a record
high of 3.4 percent in April, official figures showed today.
</P>
<P>
The seasonally adjusted jobless rate, which had been at the
record 3.4 percent from November to January, fell to 3.1 percent
in March.
</P>
<P>
But the number of the jobless hit a new high of 2.35 million in
April, a slight increase from the previous record of 2.3 million
set in January but up nearly 10 percent from the same month a year
ago, said the figures released by the Management and Coordination
Agency.
</P>
<P>
The agency attributed the rise in April's overall jobless rate
to a sharp increase in the number of jobless women aged 25 to
34. Unemployed women in this age group rose from 5.1 percent in
March to a record 6.1 percent, or 320,000.
</P>
<P>
The number of university graduates still out of work rose by
20,000 to 220,000, which pushed up the overall jobless rate, the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
The jobless rate for men reached 3.3 percent in April, up 0.1
percentage point from March, but the figure for women rose to a
new high of 3.7 percent, up 0.2 percentage points from the record
in January.
</P>
<P>
An official at the agency said the higher unemployment rate
signaled economic recovery, which may have encouraged many women
to quit their jobs and begin searching for better work.

<P>
YINCHUAN, May 31 (Xinhua) -- An Arab delegation has just
concluded a trip to Ningxia, and has agreed to provide 30 million
US dollars in loans to an irrigation project in the Ningxia Hui
autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
The delegation was headed by bader al-humaidhi, president of
the Kuwait Arabian Foundation, and Abdulmohsen Nasir Al-Geaan,
Kuwait Ambassador to China. The visitors also promised to send
another group to Ningxia for a detailed inspection prior to
loaning 110 million US dollars in loans for the project.
</P>
<P>
This will be the largest joint relief effort between China and
Kuwait, and it is the first agricultural development project
initiated by the Kuwaiti foundation.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia is inhabited by 1.7 million Muslim Hui ethnic people,
65 percent of whom still live below poverty level. Efforts to
eliminate wretched conditions there include an irrigation project
to pump Yellow River water for the Muslims.
</P>
<P>
With a total investment of 3.34 billion yuan, the project aims
to bring water to 133,300 hectares of land. Such financial aid is
expected to benefit 200,000 local people, and it is hoped that
another 800,000 people will be relocated from poverty-stricken
areas to more resource-rich parts of the country.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Attack Hezbollah Base in Eastern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes carried out
before dawn today an air strike at a base of the Lebanese
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God, near the Shiite
stronghold of Baalbek City in Lebanon's eastern Beqaa Valley.
</P>
<P>
Police sources in Baalbek said that the Israeli warplanes
launched the air raid at the Hezbollah base on the hill of Hayal
overlooking the largest Shiite city in eastern Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
All the window panes of the buildings near the attacked target
were shaken to crush, but no casualties were caused, the police
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli planes fired several air-to-surface missiles to the
target. Explosions echoed in every corner of the city and flames
were witnessed on the hill, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
An Israeli army spokesman confirmed the air raid at the
Hezbollah base in the Baalbek area, claiming that the air strike
achieved its goals.
</P>
<P>
A senior officer of the fundamentalist Hezbollah denied
casualties were caused by the Israeli air raid.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Israeli missiles hit a no-man's hill which
his party had used once to store anti-air weapons.
</P>
<P>
"It seemed that the Israeli forces believed that there was
still a base on the hill," the Hezbollah official said.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas launched a bombing attack at an Israeli
military convoy inside the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone"
in south lebanon early Thursday, killing four Israeli soldiers
and wounding seven other.
</P>
<P>
This was the largest blow to the Israeli occupation forces
since a cease-fire understanding was reached between Lebanon and
Israel on April 26, which ended the 16-day Israeli military
strikes at south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Security sources in south Lebanon said one militia man of the
Israeli client South Lebanon Army and a cameraman of a local
television were also injured when the guerrillas detonated two
bombs targeting the convoy comprising three jeeps, destroying one
of them.
</P>
<P>
Hezbollah guerrillas also launched an attack at an Israeli
patrol in the buffer strip Thursday evening, without causing
casualties.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli forces rapidly responded the guerrilla attack by
shelling suspected guerrillas bases in the hills opposite the 15
kilometer-wide border strip.

<HEADLINE> UF Continues Efforts to Form Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
An element of uncertainty and suspense prevailed in the UF camp
Thursday with the regional parties unable to take a final decision
on joining the government. The combination of 13 regional parties,
which successfully cobbled together a majority and is sure to pass
the majority test slated for June 6, is running the risk of
forming a non- representative government as some of the front
partners have ruled out the possibility of joining the coalition
government.
</P>
<P>
In another development, Janata Dal president Laloo Prasad Yadav
declared here Thursday at a press conference that there was
nothing wrong to include in the cabinet those who had been
chargesheeted in the "hawala" scandal. He said that they could
well hold positions in the cabinet as long as they are not
convicted. Some left parties, however, strongly opposed his
statement.
</P>
<P>
As far as its policies are concerned, the UF is likely to tread
the middle path, opting for a policy that appears to be investor
friendly. Bowing to compulsions of having to seek support from
disparate political groups, some of the constituents of the UF who
were rigid on the question of economic reforms are understood to
have agreed to tone down their earlier views on liberalization.

KATHMANDU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Man Mohan Adhikari, President of
the Communist Party of Nepal (UML), said his party has become more
popular even after going out of power last September, the official
Rising Nepal reported today.

<HEADLINE> Slovak President Sues PM for Slander </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PRAGUE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Slovak President Michal Kovac has
filed criminal slander charges against his bitter rival Prime
Minister Vladimir Meciar, throwing the spotlight again on their
years of personal feuding, reports reaching here said.
</P>
<P>
The reports said the charges were filed after Kovac's lawyers
analyzed Meciar's recent remarks on Slovak radio and concluded
that Meciar was trying to discredit the president.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the radio on May 24, Meciar said Kovac
was involved in a company's fraud scandal and would have been
arrested "if there were no presidential immunity."
</P>
<P>
Kovac struck back in an interview with a private television
station Wednesday, charging that Meciar had misused his power and
"committed a crime of slandering the head of state."
</P>
<P>
The personal enmity between the two leaders has gripped
the country since late 1993 when Kovac accused Meciar of
being authoritarian and demanded his resignation.
</P>
<P>
Kovac, who was formerly Meciar's deputy in the Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia, was elected as the country's first president
in early 1993.
</P>
<P>
Their feud erupted in May 1995 when Meciar tried to pass a vote
of no confidence against Kovac which was defeated in parliament.
</P>
<P>
The conflict broke out again last August when Michal Kovac Jr.,
wanted by a German court on fraud charges, was arrested in
Austria. He was later released after an Austrian court found he
was brought to the country against his will.
</P>
<P>
Kovac and his supporters alleged that the pro-Meciar Slovak
Intelligence Service orchestrated the younger Kovac's abduction to
Austria in order to embarrass the president. Meciar backers denied
his involvement.
</P>
<P>
The conflict has caused concern in some Western countries,
including the United States, which has asked Meciar to stop his
verbal attacks on Kovac. But their appeals have been greeted with
strong criticism from the Slovak government.
</P>
<P>
Slovakia's daily newspaper Pravda said in an editorial today
that the cold war between Kovac and Meciar "has done serious harm
to Slovakia's international reputation" for which the country had
paid "a great price."

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Has Low Women Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh has one of the lowest
rates of women employment in South Asia, said a World Bank study
report published here today.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, only 11 percent of Bangladeshi women
are "economically active" against a high rate of child labor that
covers 12 percent of the total labor-force of 56 million in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The rate of women employment in Bangladesh is just higher than
that in Pakistan, which has only 6.8 percent of its women
employed.
</P>
<P>
The rate is 19.8 in India and 32.1 in Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank report noted that more than 80 percent of
Bangladeshi women workers are unpaid family helpers, compared with
only 20 percent of men, and that more than 90 percent of all
economically active women are agriculture workers.
</P>
<P>
Only 4.5 percent of the women can enter the formal employment
sector compared with 13.1 percent of men, the report said, adding
that women are occupying only six percent of the government jobs
although 15 percent of those are officially reserved for them.

<HEADLINE> News Feature: South Korean Girls Desperate to Lose </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Kim En-ying, who works at the Seoul
headquarters of South Korea's giant Samsung conglomerate, has
decided to spend one fifth of her annual salary on a special
slimming treatment at a health center.
</P>
<P>
She will spend two hours a day for eight weeks undergoing the
treatment which cost her 3,000 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Kim, 23, is one of many young South Korean women who are
receiving such treatment or going on a diet in their efforts to be
slim and attractive, regardless of whether they are actually fat
or thin.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, diet and health centers dealing with
obesity problems are crowded with young women desperate to lose
weight.
</P>
<P>
The weight-loss syndrome is helping the diet-aid industry
prosper. Almost every newspaper carries one or two big
advertisements about "patented" diet foods daily.
</P>
<P>
"Our clinic is always full of patients wanting to lose weight
with our special diet program," said Dr. Shin Hyon-dae of Kyunghee
Medical Center here.
</P>
<P>
Many young women also visit plastic surgeons to have
liposuction and fat suction surgery.
</P>
<P>
"Most of my clients asking for liposuction surgery are young
women in their twenties and early thirties who have not yet
married and tend to believe it is imperative for them to be thin
enough to find a good spouse," said surgeon Kim Song-hun of
Cosmetic Surgery Clinic in downtown Seoul.
</P>
<P>
Although doctors recommend other ways of losing weight, such as
regular exercise and a balanced diet, young women obsessed with
being slender are trying other, easier means not to be
"overweight."
</P>
<P>
This trend has led to serious eating disorders like anorexia or
bulimia, which were unknown to South Koreans until very recently.
</P>
<P>
Anorexia, caused by self-induced starvation for fear of
becoming fat, became known to the South Korean public only after
Britain's Princess Diana confessed to the press that she suffered
from it. Karen Carpenter of the famous American pop duo, the
Carpenters, died of complications resulting from anorexia.
</P>
<P>
Bulimia, another type of eating disorder, is characterized by
binging on food followed by self-induced vomiting.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent survey, 3.7 percent of high school girls
in South Korea suffer from anorexia and 1.6 percent suffer from
bulimia, compared with 3.7 percent and 1.2 percent in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
This means at least two or three students in every class need
treatment for eating disorders.
</P>
<P>
These girls should consult psychiatrists for their problem, not
diet centers, said Dr. Shin of the Kyunghee Medical Center.
</P>
<P>
Doctors say there is no easy way to stay thin, even after going
through diet programs or fat suction surgery, without regular
exercise to stay fit.
</P>
<P>
Critics say that this trend will not disappear as long as
society continues to admire slender, attractive women, and women
try to live up to this ideal.

<HEADLINE> Thais Urged to Buy Thai Products </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government is planning a
campaign to encourage Thai consumers to buy Thai products instead
of imported goods in a bid to curb the current account deficit,
the Bangkok Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The plans for the campaign, dubbed "Buy Thai," were discussed
at a meeting here Thursday chaired by Deputy Commerce Minister
Montri Danphaibul.
</P>
<P>
Montri said many Thais do not realize that their country
produces good-quality products to supply the world under both Thai
and foreign brands.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the obsession with foreign brand names as status
symbols, which played a part in the country's large current
account deficit of 335.7 billion baht (13.4 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Montri said plans of short, medium and long terms were needed
to boost consumer confidence in Thai goods.
</P>
<P>
The short-term plan calls for promotional assistance for Thai
factories that supply good-quality products and extending the
Prime Minister's Award to cover all companies. The award is now
only given to export-oriented companies.
</P>
<P>
In the medium term, a "Buy Thai" year is being considered, with
a series of promotional campaigns spanning over several months.
</P>
<P>
The long-term plan is expected to focus on raising the
awareness of young students of Thai products, Montri said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia Bans Political Activity of New Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, May 31 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian government has
warned a new party set up by a sacked legislator against any
political activities in the country, where only two political
parties are recognized by the constitution.
</P>
<P>
Cabinet ministers in charge of political and security affairs
decided at a meeting Thursday to take action against the party of
Sri Bintang Pamungkas "if is conducts political activities."
</P>
<P>
The existing laws of Indonesia recognize two parties -- the
United Development Party (PPP) and the Indonesia Democratic Party
(PDI) -- and one functional group, the ruling Golkar.
</P>
<P>
Bintang, who was dismissed from the PPP legislatorship last May
for allegedly deviating from the party line, Wednesday established
the Uni Demokrasi Indonesia Party (PUDI) or the Indonesian
Democratic Union Party.
</P>
<P>
Coordinating Minister for Political and Security Affairs
Soesilo Soedarman said after the meeting that "there is no
possibility for the advent of a new political party in the
country."
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government would not sit by idly if the new
party were to "overstep certain boundaries."
</P>
<P>
"We would not ban it ... but of course we won't just take it
lying down it they conduct political activities," he warned.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Home Affairs Minister Yogie S. Memet and the
Indonesian armed forces said they would not recognize the new
party as it was against the country's constitution.

ROME, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A former Italian interior minister was
sentenced to five years in prison and fined 15 million lira
(9,600 U.S. dollars) for corruption in a Naples court today.
</P>
<P>
Antonio Gava, 65, interior minister from 1989 to 1990 in the
governments of Ciriaco De Mita and Giulio Andreotti, was convicted
of Mafia membership and bribery. He may appeal the conviction.

<P>
Prosecutors said he was a member of Camorra, the largest Mafia
ring in the Campania region, and received 300 million lira
(180,000 dollars) in bribes from businesses in exchange for a
contract to build a hospital in the Naples region.
</P>
<P>
Gava, a prominent figure in the now-defunct Christian
Democratic Party and once head of the country's anti-graft
committee, excused himself from today's trial because of illness.

<HEADLINE> Colombia Offers Reward for Capture of Former Army Officer </HEADLINE>

<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Colombian authorities
offered a 300,000 U.S. dollar reward for information leading to
the capture and indictment of a former army officer charged with
drug trafficking.
</P>
<P>
The Santafe Regional Prosecutor Office issued Wednesday an
arrest warrant against former Army Sergeant Justo Pastor Perafan
Hommen, who has been charged with illicit enrichment, a source
close to the office said today.
</P>
<P>
An earlier warrant for the arrest of Perafan was issued on
March 26 this year.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors have planned to reduce the economic power of the
alleged drug trafficker by confiscating some of his assets and
investigating his bank deposits to prevent tax evasion, the
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
Perafan, who retired from the army 10 years ago, is said to be
one of the richest people in the country.
</P>
<P>
However, he has to explain to the authorities the origin of his
costly properties, such as the Chinauta resort and the millions of
dollars' shares in different companies, Santafe Regional
Prosecutor Office sources said.

MOSCOW, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Tajikistan, a small central Asian
country hit by a series of rain storms and floods, today appealed
to the international community for emergency aid, reports reaching

<HEADLINE> Cuba Slams U.S. Trade Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Cuba today severely condemned the
United States as the latter is implementing the Helms-Burton law
targeting foreign companies that have trade links with the
Caribbean country.
</P>
<P>
Cuban Foreign Ministry spokesman Miguel Alfonso described the
U.S. legislation as "blackmail and intimidation" against foreign
companies which invest in the island country.
</P>
<P>
He commented that the U.S. move was "blatant intervention" in
the affairs of other countries.
</P>
<P>
The United States enacted in March the Helms-Burton law to
tighten the trade embargo against Cuba after two small planes of
an anti-Cuban group based in the U.S. were shot down by the Cuban
Air Force. The law foresees punitive actions against foreign
enterprises which do business with confiscated U.S. properties in
Cuba.
</P>
<P>
The United States sent letters of warning to three companies
in Canada, Mexico and Italy Wednesday, demanding that they stop
their business with Cuba, or else they would face sanctions from
the United States.
</P>
<P>
However, Alfonso said his country is fully confident that
foreign investors will not bend to the Helms-Burton law and will
continue their economic activities.
</P>
<P>
Mexico and Canada, U.S. trading partners in the North American
Free Trade Agreement, have announced that they will adopt internal
measures against the Helms-Burton law, said the Cuban Foreign
Ministry spokesman.
</P>
<P>
A major Canadian investor in Cuba, Sherritt International
Corporation, which received threat of U.S. sanctions Wednesday,
shrugged off the warning and vowed to do business as usual in the
island state.
</P>
<P>
Alfonso said the countries opposed to the Helms-Burton law are
preparing concrete measures in international fora to oppose the
implementation of the legislation.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Group of Rio countries have decided at a
meeting of foreign ministers to coordinate actions against the
Helms-Burton law, including the drastic measure of going to the
International Court of Justice in The Hague.
</P>
<P>
Alfonso said Cuba is sure that the Helms-Burton law will end up
with the same fate of the 1992 Torricelli law, a similar U.S. bill
against Cuba.
</P>
<P>
None of the U.S. actions will stop the economic reform under
way in the country and will not strangle the Cuban economy, the
spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. legislation outraged the rest of the world, including
its allies in the Americas and Europe.
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind condemned the
U.S. law, saying, "No one country should have the right to tell
companies in another country how they should behave in third
countries."

<HEADLINE> Bulgaria Announces Tax Hike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Bulgarian boozers, cigarette smokers
and car drivers will have to spend from 20 percent to almost 80
percent more to maintain their habits as their government
announced a tax hike today for getting new overseas loans.
</P>
<P>
Tax increase is a precondition for Bulgaria to receive loans
from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and other overseas
financial institutions.
</P>
<P>
The Bulgarian government has decided to increase the
value-added tax from 18 percent to 22 percent which converts to
consumption tax rises of 20 percent for wines, 50 percent for
alcohol and 40 percent for tobacco products.
</P>
<P>
Sofia cabbies were the first to react when they gathered at the
capital's National Assembly Square today to protest against the
government decision.
</P>
<P>
The price for super unleaded gasoline will rise 79.5 percent to
reach 70 leva (0.5 U.S. dollars) per liter while that for diesel
will increase by 40 percent.
</P>
<P>
They were followed by members of the country's second largest
trade union later in the day.
</P>
<P>
To meet another precondition for loans, the Bulgarian
government also decided to shut down 65 state-run and loss-making
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
The government would also rehabilitate 70 other loss-suffering
state enterprises and place several near-bankrupt commercial banks
under the supervision of the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria is expected to get 450 million dollars in new loans by
July if the international financial institutions find Bulgaria's
expedient measures efficient.
</P>
<P>
When IMF Deputy Managing Director Yohanes Wainholc visited
Sofia in early May, Bulgarian Prime Minister Zhan Videnov called
for "timely and significant support" from the IMF.
</P>
<P>
Bulgaria's external debt had grown to 9.45 billion dollars by
December last year, of which 1.657 billion is due for repayment
immediately.
</P>
<P>
But most of the banks are experiencing liquidity problems.
Losses of state-run commercial banks had risen to 567 million
dollars by the end of February 1996 while the central bank's
foreign exchange reserves had fallen to the dangerously low level
of only 700 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IMF and other international financial institutions,
however, demanded as preconditions for further loans that the
Bulgarian government stop bankrolling the losses and shut down
enterprises suffering heavy losses.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Investors Favor Fujian (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, May 31 (Xinhua) -- A Taiwan business giant has just
launched its third joint venture in Fuzhou, a week after opening a
70 million US dollar plant in the city.
</P>
<P>
The Huo Chong Group celebrated a land-breaking ceremony for
the third joint venture in Fujian following the formal opening of
a Taiwan-Fujian joint venture metal plant.
</P>
<P>
The two enterprises are just two of more than 100 Taiwan-funded
enterprises newly established in Fujian, a province facing the
island of Taiwan across the Taiwan Straits.
</P>
<P>
According to an official from Fujian Foreign Economic Relations
and Trade, the province established 135 such Taiwan-funded
enterprises with a contract investment of 420 million US dollars,
an increase of 10.4 percent over the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
With similar policies, language and social customs and distance
advantage, Fujian is one of the most ideal sites for Taiwan
investment. Since 1983, Taiwan's investment to Fujian has
undergone three periods: the wait-and-see period from 1983 to
1987; a breakthrough from 1988 to 1991 and the expansion period
since 1992.
</P>
<P>
Fujian now has more than 4,300 Taiwan-funded enterprises with a
total investment of seven billion US dollars, which makes Taiwan
the second largest overseas investment source after Hong Kong in
the coastal Chinese province.
</P>
<P>
The new wave of Taiwan investment, compared with the previous
wave, is marked by increases in numbers and more spending. More
and more business giants have invested in large projects.
</P>
<P>
The province has now established over 140 Taiwan-funded
enterprises with 10 million US dollars of investment each. And
half of the 100 largest business giants in Taiwan have been on
business tours to Fujian, and 22 of them have invested in 28
projects in the province, 24 of which are already in operation.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that 85 percent of Taiwan-funded
enterprises in Fujian are making a profit and up to 90 percent of
them are profitable in Xiamen city.
</P>
<P>
As a result more and more Taiwan investors have expanded
investments based on their original joint ventures. A total of 600
million US dollars have been invested since the Taiwan business
community first landed in Fujian.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Investors Favor Fujian (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
By the end of March this year more than 200 out of 1,000
Taiwan-invested enterprises in Xiamen, a special economic zone
facing the Taiwan island across the straits, have expanded
investment in their original enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of Taiwan businesses have moved their major
production bases from Taiwan or overseas, to Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
According to a provincial official, Taiwan investors have
favored real estate in Fuzhou, the provincial capital and Xiamen,
agriculture development and export-oriented agricultural
production in Zhangzhou and natural resources development in
Sanming and Nanping.
</P>
<P>
With the steady increase of their investments, industrial
structure has been improving. Last year 2.3 percent of the
Taiwan-invested enterprises opted for agriculture, 76.7 percent
for manufacturing and 21 percent for the service industry.
</P>
<P>
"Such a steady increase of Taiwan investment in a political
sensitive period across the Taiwan Straits demonstrates that the
economic and trade cooperation between the two sides is
irreversible," said a senior economist from Fujian Economic
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
The view by the economist has been shared by many Taiwan
business people. Stanley Hsu, chairman of Huo Chong Group, said
Taiwan's enterprises find it hard to expand in the Taiwan Island,
which prompts them to find a way out elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
The mainland provinces have been the best choice for them, he
said, adding that the mainland provinces have a large market
potential and rich labor resources and low costs. Free of language
barriers makes it easier to train skilled workers, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Here comes another advantage to invest in Fujian: the direct
flights, mail service and postal service between Taiwan and the
mainland will be inevitable," said Mr. Deng from southern
Taiwan. "I can have breakfast in the morning at home in Taiwan,
work in Fujian in the day and go home for dinner," he said.
</P>
<P>
In light of the new wave of Taiwan investments, Fujian Province
will establish an experimental base for agriculture cooperation
with Taiwan, said Li Qingzhou, assistant provincial governor of
Fujian.
</P>
<P>
To promote economic and trade exchanges between Taiwan and
Fujian, he said, the province will make further efforts to improve
its investment environment with special support for the 4,300
Taiwan-funded enterprises, he said.

<HEADLINE> 4 Given Life for Killing Thai Communications Chief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Four men were sentenced to life
imprisonment Thursday for the murder of Saengchai Sunthornwat,
director-general of the Mass Communications Organization of
Thailand (MCOT), the local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Saengchai was gunned down on April 11 near his house in Bangkok
when he was being driven home by his wife.
</P>
<P>
Police said the murder stemmed from a conflict of interest as
Saengchai terminated contracts with certain programming companies
after taking over at the MCOT three years ago.
</P>
<P>
Of the four sentenced, Sunan Wongkhamhan, 22, confessed that he
rode the motorcycle, with Naruethuk Ountrakul, 36, as the pillion
rider, who fired the fatal shot.
</P>
<P>
Kanoksak Intharasaman, 19, confessed to identifying the target
for the gunman. Kanoksak was in a pick-up truck driven by
Chaichana Khongnun, 34.
</P>
<P>
The four convicted men told police that they had been hired to
carry out the assassination by former Chinag Rai MP Thavi
Phutthachan.
</P>
<P>
Thavi, who has been arrested, denied the charge.
</P>
<P>
Thavi's case has yet to be forwarded to the prosecutors, pending
further evidence, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Colombia, U.S. To Combat Money Laundering </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Colombia and the United
States have agreed to exchange information about the movement of
goods and services to combat money laundering, a local newspaper
reported.
</P>
<P>
The proposal was made by Colombian Foreign Trade Minister
Morris Harf Meyer during his visit to Washington last week and
accepted by the U.S. Commerce Department, the "El Espectador"
daily said.
</P>
<P>
The strategy aims to prevent the movement of goods and services
between the two countries from being used to launder money, for
example by compelling U.S. businessmen to export their products
only through official channels.
</P>
<P>
U.S. commerce authorities have suggested setting up a working
committee to draw up mechanisms for its implementation.

<HEADLINE> More Foreigners Flock to Aid Poor Students in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Thirty-eight poor but diligent
students in Shanghai have received 94,000 yuan donations from over
20 foreigners.
</P>
<P>
The contributors are senior office members in Shanghai
foreign-funded enterprises and their wives, and most of them from
Finland, Sweden and United States.
</P>
<P>
This is the second time this year that foreign friends in
Shanghai have collected a large amount of money to aid Chinese
poor students.
</P>
<P>
A Canadian woman who has aided a nine-year-old girl said at a
ceremony sponsored by the Shanghai Charity Foundation, that she
was born in Berlin in the war-ridden days and suffered much misery
at that time, "now I hope to help the poor children to live
better."
</P>
<P>
A couple from Britain have adopted a 14-month-old Chinese baby
girl and named her Lucy. This time they also aided Qian Jiayun, a
12-year-old student. They hope Lucy and Qian will become good
friends in the future.
</P>
<P>
According to the sponsors from the Shanghai Charity Foundation,
more foreign friends in Shanghai are supporting the "rising sun"
project, which aims at providing more aid for the poor children in
the city.

<HEADLINE> Venezuela's Former President Sentenced for Corruption </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, March 30 (Xinhua) -- The Venezuelan Supreme Court
sentenced former President Carlos Andres Perez to 28 months of
house arrest today for the misuse of 17 million U.S. dollars in
government funds when he was in office.
</P>
<P>
Perez, who has already served two years under house arrest,
said he planned to return to politics when he is freed in four
months.
</P>
<P>
The former Venezuelan president, 73, has been detained since
1993 on charges of embezzlement of funds from a secret state
account and other frauds and was put under house arrest in July
1994 because of old age.
</P>
<P>
The court also asked the former president to pay a fine for the
damage of the public property, but did not specify the amount.
</P>
<P>
The Supreme Court issued the decision after three plenary
sessions and several meetings to discuss the case.
</P>
<P>
Perez is the first president in Venezuelan history to be
detained and sentenced for corruption. He was the first Venezuelan
to be elected twice to the presidency and was forced out of office
in May 1993, eight months short of ending his second five-year
term, on charges of misappropriation of government money.

<HEADLINE> Electrification Brings Hope to Rural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 31 (Xinhua) -- More than 93 million rural people
in 318 counties have said farewell to the history of using
kerosene lamps or brush torches as lighting devices, thanks to a
decade-long national effort to tap hydroelectric resources.
</P>
<P>
Over 75 percent of these counties are located in state-listed
poverty-stricken areas, ethnic-minority areas or old revolutionary
bases.
</P>
<P>
The power-generating capacity in rural China has surged by 157
percent to reach 68 billion kwh over the past decade, the Economic
Daily said.
</P>
<P>
Rural electrification has brought 466,600 ha of land under
irrigation, increased grain output and helped 17 million people in
arid areas to drink pure water.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, it has initiated cultural and ideological changes,
promoted national unity and benefited the ecological balance. It
has proved to be an efficient way in narrowing the gap between
economically-developed coastal areas and the under-developed
western part.
</P>
<P>
The rapid development of hydroelectricity in China has aroused
great concern of power experts in other countries and some
international organizations, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
However, the pace of development still lags far behind China's
economic growth, the paper stated.
</P>
<P>
As a power-rich country, China owns 16.7 percent of the world's
hydropower resources. Nearly half of the 2,300 counties in China
are rich in untapped hydropower resources, and thus there is a
great potential for the development of electrification in rural
China.

<HEADLINE> Business Confidence in New Zealand Falls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, May 31 (Xinhua) -- Business confidence in New
Zealand has sunk to its lowest level since the recession in the
early 1990s, shows the latest survey conducted by the National
Bank.
</P>
<P>
The drop in business confidence is across the board with
domestic sectors of the economy taking the biggest blow as the
service and retail sectors have manifested a marked decline in
optimism.
</P>
<P>
For the first time since April 1991, overall confidence has
gone into negative figures, with those expecting conditions to
worsen in the next 12 months outnumbering those expecting an
improvement by a net 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
A general expectation of rising interest rates and a halt to
job growth are behind the confidence decline. The companies
surveyed expect profits to be well down, encouraging them to delay
investment.
</P>
<P>
But National Bank chief economist Adrian Orr said "there is no
suggestion that the recession of the early 1990s will be
repeated."
</P>
<P>
He noted that inflation is still low, the government is running
a surplus, profitability is strong and investment and job levels
are high.
</P>
<P>
"It's unrealistic to expect the 1995 growth to be maintained
forever," he said.

<HEADLINE> UPS Delivers 1996 Olympic Games Tickets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua/OANAS) -- United Parcel Service
(UPS), the exclusive supplier of express letter and package
delivery services for the 1996 Olympic Games, announced Thursday
that it will begin delivering Games tickets nationwide in some
311,000 individual orders.
</P>
<P>
"We are proud to be working with the Olympic family to deliver
the Games to Atlanta," said Rosemary Windsor-Williams, UPS vice
president and Olympic program manager.
</P>
<P>
The initiative, the largest express movement of high-value
shipments in UPS's history, will require unprecedented logistics
procedures and special security measures to ensure that spectator
tickets are delivered promptly and securely, said the UPS in a
news release.
</P>
<P>
Over 90 percent of the deliveries will be completed within
three days of shipment. Deliveries to Georgia addesses will be
made as early as Friday and will include Saturday, and shipments
to the rest of the country will be completed by June 10.
</P>
<P>
The post service will use a special system to ensure the
highest degree of security and accountability, the news release
said. The ticket packages will be scanned several times
throughout the shipment process and the package data will be
cross-referenced with ACOG's ticket order database in order to
close the loop on the package information cycle, it added.
</P>
<P>
UPS, one of the world largest distribution companies, employs
more than 335,000 people worldwide, and provides services to more
than 200 countries and territories. With a delivery of 12 million
packages and documents worldwide each business day, it had a
revenue of 21 billion U.S. dollars on a volume of 3.1 billion
packages in 1995.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Olympic organizers are
preparing to take on so-called ambush marketers and sellers of
counterfeit Olympic merchandise during the Centennial Olympic
Games in Atlanta this summer.
</P>
<P>
Olympic officials unveiled Thursday a new advertising campaign
designed to raise public awareness of the effects of counterfeit
Olympic Games merchandise and "ambush" marketing.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, cosponsored by the Atlanta Committee for Olympic
Games (ACOG) and the U.S. Olympic Committee, was aimed at
protecting the interests of corporate sponsors who have paid as
much as 40 million U.S. dollars for the right to associate their
products and services with the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
"The Olympic Games and the U.S. Team are funded through private
sources. Unfortunately, some companies try to commercially exploit
the Olympic Games and our Olympic athletes by implying support
without actually contributing anything either," said Bill McCahan,
Chief Marketing Officer of Atlanta Centennial Olympic Properties.
</P>
<P>
The ADS warn people that ambush marketing is tantamount to
cheating and ask consumers to call ACOG if they see misleading
promotions.
</P>
<P>
The ACOG will employ mobile team of specialists who will
search out counterfeit Olympic merchandise and obtain court
orders to seize any found on sale now through the Games. The
effort will include a coordinated effort with federal marshals
and U.S. Customs officials.

<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The World Bank today approved a
total of 360 million U.S. dollars equivalent in financing two new
projects in China.
</P>
<P>
The two projects are designed to improve living standards for
the rural poor and better road networks in China's Gansu and Henan
provinces.
</P>
<P>
The Gansu Hexi Corridor Project is aimed to raise incomes and
living standards for 200,000 poor people through voluntary
emigration and settlement on newly-developed irrigated land in 160
new villages and 16 new townships, increase agricultural
production and enhance and protect the environment in the region.
The World Bank will offer 150 million dollars for the some 259.2
million dollar project.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank will offer another 210 million dollar loan for
the 605.6 million dollar Second Henan Provincial Highway Project.
The first Henan Provincial Highway Project, started in 1992, is
under way. The two highway projects are intended to provide access
to every poor township and 90 percent of villages in support for
provincial poverty alleviation programs.

<HEADLINE> Bildt Refuses to Deal With Bosnian Serb Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The international community's High
Representative for Bosnia Carl Bildt said today he had no
intention of dealing with Bosnian Serb Vice-President Biljana
Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Serb President Radovan Karadzic recently authorized
Plavsic to act for him on some duties after the international
community mounted pressure for Karadzic to step down. Karadzic
sacked his moderate prime minister in mid-May and then delegated
most of his powers to Plavsic.
</P>
<P>
"It is obvious that the international community cannot accept
contacts with Plavsic in her function as 'assisting' a person
(Karadzic) who is seeking to hang on to public office in clear
violation of the peace agreement," Bildt said in a statement which
was distributed to reporters in Sarajevo today.
</P>
<P>
Karadzic has been twice indicted as war criminal by the
international war crimes tribunal. His stay in office is an
apparent violation of the Dayton agreement.
</P>
<P>
Bildt's reaction has come more than a week after Karadzic's
decision to delegate some of his powers, mostly in dealings with
international negotiators, to Vice-President Plavsic, also a
hardliner in the Serb leadership.
</P>
<P>
Bildt has been appointed by the world community to coordinate
the implementation of civilian aspects of the peace accord for
Bosnia-Herzegovina.

<HEADLINE> IFOR General Shows Concern About Freedom of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A NATO-led peace Implementation
Force (IFOR) commander said today the IFOR was concerned about the
freedom of movement in Bosnia which was a very sensitive issue.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a press conference in Banja Luka, the largest Serb
city in northwestern Bosnia, the IFOR commander for Southwest
Sector, General Michael Jackson of Britain, said freedom of
movement between the two entities in Bosnia was a very complex
issue, and "this is why it should be resolved in an organized way
by the Serb police and the police force of the Muslim-Croat
federation."
</P>
<P>
However, "absolute freedom of movement does not exist in any
country," the Tanjug news agency quoted him as saying.
</P>
<P>
The British general said that the IFOR was here to prevent
"collective and uncontrolled crossings of the border which could
be provocative and dangerous." Under the Dayton accords, all
civilians are entitled to move around freely in the country but
free crossing into other ethnic land barely happens by now.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Muslim refugees and Serb civilians have clashed many
times in the past two months when the Muslims attempted to enter
into Serb territories in northern and western Bosnia for short
visits. Several people died during the clashes and dozens more
were injured.
</P>
<P>
Regarding the release of prisoners of war (POWs), Jackson said
all three parties in Bosnia were still holding a certain number of
POWs but the IFOR's mandate was not to "break into jails and set
them free." Under the Dayton agreement, all POWs must be released
by January 19 this year.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Endorses Curfews to Fight Teen Crime </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton
today called curfews a means of fighting teen crime, saying they
help prevent children from engaging in criminal activity and to
protect them from the "dangerous world out there."
</P>
<P>
Addressing a church audience of about 8,000 in New Orleans,
Clinton said curfews are needed for youths under 17 -- even as
early as 8 p.m. on school nights -- to "bring more order and
structure and discipline" to young people's lives.
</P>
<P>
"I'm sure a lot of the teenagers think this curfew is too
strict. But they must also know that it's a dangerous world out
there, and these rules are being set by people who love them and
care about them and desperately want them to have good lives,"
media reports quoted Clinton as saying.
</P>
<P>
Clinton spoke highly of the "dusk to dawn" curfew in New
Orleans, which is credited with reducing juvenile crime by 27
percent, robbery by 33 percent and lowering auto theft by 42
percent in 1994, when it was implemented.
</P>
<P>
Clinton urged the nation to "tackle the crushing problems of
our young people" -- an increased vulnerability to drug use, gun
violence, teen pregnancy and habits such as smoking.
</P>
<P>
"Let's tell America we refuse to accept that... children being
killed and dragged down and destroyed are things we can't do
anything about," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
New Orleans' curfew, similar to those in six other cities,
requires youngsters to be off the streets at night and steer
violators to curfew centers where they receive counseling, and
where parents pick them up.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Justice Department is issuing a curfew report
that is to act as a guide in how to establish curfews that can
withstand a constitutional challenge, and recommends curfew
criteria.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is embracing curfews enacted in Dallas, Phoenix,
Chicago, Denver, Jacksonville, Fla., and North Little Rock, Ark.
The New Orleans program is said to contain the most elements
outlined in the Justice Department report.
</P>
<P>
It requires youths under 17 to be indoors from 8 p.m. until 6
a.m. during the week from September to May, and 9 p.m. until 6
a.m. from June until August. On weekends, they must be in by 11
p.m.

ZAGREB, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The European Union's administrator
for Mostar, Ricard Perez Casado, said today that June 30 has been
chosen as the new election date for the southwestern Bosnian city,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Casado made the announcement at the city's Advisory Council
which consists of 15 members -- five Croats, five Muslims and five
representatives of other nationalities.
</P>
<P>
Municipal elections for Mostar, which saw some of the fierce
fightings between Croats and Muslims in the 1993-1994 period, were
originally planned for May 31.
</P>
<P>
But the date had to be put off after major Muslim political
parties failed to register before the deadline, complaining that
refugees of the city are unable to participate in the upcoming
elections.
</P>
<P>
Last week, the Muslims and Croats reached an agreement which
allows refugees to vote at EU-organized polling stations in the
countries they are taking shelter.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Ambassador to China in Praise of Bilateral Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Ambassador to China Samir
Borhan today spoke highly of the existing friendly cooperative
relations between Egypt and China.
</P>
<P>
He described the recent visit to Egypt by Chinese President
Jiang Zemin as the manifestation of the close relationship.
</P>
<P>
He made the statement to Xinhua reporter in the wake of the
40th anniversary of the establishment of Sino-Egyptian diplomatic
relations.
</P>
<P>
On May 30, 1956, China and Egypt officially forged diplomatic
relations under the leaderships of late Premier Zhou Enlai and
President Gamal Abdel Nasser. Egypt became the first Arabian
African country to establish diplomatic relations with China.
</P>
<P>
The Ambassador expressed his appreciation to the Chinese
government and people for supporting the Arabian people in their
cause to defend their rights and recover their lost territories.
</P>
<P>
He said it is an essential part of Egypt's foreign policy to
cooperate closely with China, and Egypt attaches special
importance to developing friendly cooperative relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Calling President Jiang's recent visit to Egypt a success, the
Ambassador said that during Jiang's first ever visit to Africa he
was warmly received by President Mubarak, the Egyptian government
and its people.
</P>
<P>
"This is not only because Jiang is Mubarak's personal friend,
but also because China is a friendly nation to Egypt and it takes
the just stand in supporting the just cause of the Arabian world,"
the Ambassador continued.
</P>
<P>
According to Borhan, Jiang's visit to Africa has laid a solid
foundation for Sino-African ties in the next century. And his
visit to Egypt, along with the agreements signed during the visit
on economy, labor and culture will further enhance bilateral
relations in a more comprehensive way.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador hopes especially that the exchanges and
cooperation between the two sides in the economic sphere will be
strengthened with trade volume expanded to usher two-way trade and
economic relations to a higher level.
</P>
<P>
Ambassador Borhan finally stressed that there is only one China
and Taiwan is an integral part of China. As the largest nations
in Africa and Asia respectively, the promotion of Sino-Egyptian
friendly relations is of great significance to the cooperation of
the two continents.
</P>
<P>
The continuous exchanges of views and consultations on the
regional and international affairs between Egypt and China will be
conducive to keeping regional and world peace and stability, he
said.

<HEADLINE> African Banks Urged to Meet Challenges Posed by </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- African Central Banks should adopt
effective supervisory standards and risk management proceedures
to meet the challenges posed by economic reforms, Zimbabwe's
Minister of Finance Herbert Murerwa said here today.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa told the on-going symposium for southern African
central bank governors in Harare that reforms had brought about
new challenges such as deregulation of the financial and exchange
regimes which exposed the banks to increased global competition.
</P>
<P>
''Under these circumstances, the challenges you face as
central bank governors require that you not only ensure the
stability of our financial systems but that you provide needed
confidence without which financial markets could not operate,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
The symposium, organized by the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe,
brought together the governors of central banks from southern
Africa as well as representatives from the World Bank,
International Monetary Fund (IMF) and International Finance
Corporation (IFC).
</P>
<P>
The delegates are expected to discuss the role of central
banks under economic reforms currently taking place in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Murerwa told the delegates that recent developments in
emerging capital markets had demonstrated the fragility and
vulnerability of such markets to external shocks.
</P>
<P>
He noted that high volumes of capital inflows, unrelated to
the level of economic productivity, had in most cases resulted in
currency appreciation as well as deteriorating trade balances.
</P>
<P>
Changes in banking and technology called for greater
cooperation among African central banks to minimise risks,he
added.

BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The survival rate of newly born
babies in Beijing has reached the levels of developed countries,
statistics have revealed.
</P>
<P>
The death rate of new-borns in Beijing is 11.1 per thousand,
close to the level in the medium-developed countries, according to
a report provided by the Beijing Municipal Statistical Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The death rate of children under five is the lowest, next to
Shanghai, the largest city in the country, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The incidence of infectious diseases for local children has
dropped to a record low, the report added.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the death rate of pregnant women is
18.75 in every 100,000, which is the lowest in the country and
close to the levels in developed nations.
</P>
<P>
Breast feeding rate has jumped to 70.3 percent as against 48
percent in 1990, the report continued.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, the State Council, China's highest government body,
publicized the "Development Program for Chinese Children in the
1990s", and the Beijing Municipal Government drafted a similar
development program for local children.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwean Government Urged to Protect Poor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwean government should come
up with specific social policies to protect poor people during
the implementation of the proposed second phase of the economic
reform program starting from this year.
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made today by Consumer Council of Zimbabwe
(CCZ) Managing Director Muchaneta Nyambuya.
</P>
<P>
Nyambuya said the economic reform program would require
consumer-driven economic and budgetary policies to create
economic growth.
</P>
<P>
"Growth on its own will not alleviate poverty, specific social
policies and actions are needed to ensure the poorest people
shared in the economic growth process and to protect them from
any negative transitory effects," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nyambuya urged the government to control public debt, saying this
might be the biggest obstacle to Zimbabwe's efforts to sustain
development and economic growth.
</P>
<P>
He accused the government of lacking political commitment to
achieving a balanced budget, noting the other problem with
achieving targets set out in budget statements is that they
could be dodged by simply moving spending programs off budget.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The world population at
present stands at 5.8 billion, according to the annual report
released today by the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF).
</P>
<P>
Despite the continued fall of the growth rate, annual increase
in global population is over 86 million and will remain in the
range until the year 2015, the report says.
</P>
<P>
the urban population is growing faster than world population as
a whole. People living in cities now number 2.6 billion, including
1.7 billion in developing countries.
</P>
<P>
"Within ten years," the UNPF State of World Population 1996
Report goes on to say, "more than half the people in the world
will be living in cities, 3.3 billion of the 6.59 billion total."
</P>
<P>
Almost all the urban population increase will be in today's
developing nations. They will account for 92.9 percent of a 2.06
billion increase in the global urban population between 1970 and
2020. Migration accounts for some 40 percent of the urban
population growth.
</P>
<P>
Poverty is a major problem for city dwellers. One estimate
suggests that 27.7 percent of the developing world's urban
population lives below official poverty lines.
</P>
<P>
Aging is another problem facing many nations. People over 65
are the most rapidly increasing group in a large number of
countries, the report notes.

ISLAMABAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Afghan government forces captured
several hilltops near Kabul in new battles with the Taliban
Militia, an Afghan defense spokesman said in Kabul today.
</P>
<P>
The fighting broke out southeast to Kabul last night and the
government troops used jets to pound Taliban positions, the

Hekmatyar, the arch rival to Afghan President Burhanuddin
Rabbani, had signed a reconciliation agreement with Rabbani last

<P>
HONG KONG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong will be a good partner
for regions in northwest China in economic cooperation, said
Herbert Liang, president of the Chinese Manufacturers' Association
of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
At a gathering with a trade delegation from northwest China's
Shaanxi Province today, Liang said that cooperation between Hong
Kong and China's northwest will inevitably enhance the competition
of both sides on international market and benefit their economic
developments.
</P>
<P>
He said that northwest China has rich natural resources, talent
and technology resources. With China adopting favorable policies
toward the region, the potential in the region is expected to be
tapped up in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
According to Liang, Hong Kong's manufacturers are now turning
their attention to northwest China including Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
In the latter half of the year, he said, his association will
organize a seminar for the business people to learn about and
discuss the development opportunities in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Jia Zhibang, vice-governor of Shaanxi Province, said that his
province is making efforts to accelerating infrastructural
construction and improving management so as to provide a better
investment environment for overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
According to Jia, in the past week, Shaanxi Province has
successfully concluded its trade fair in Hong Kong with signed
investment agreements of over 1.05 billion US dollars and export
contracts of 79 million US dollars.

<HEADLINE> United States, Europe to Further Defence Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- The United States has recently
launched an initiative to expand transatlantic defence industry
cooperation in an effort to head off criticism that US defence
market is closed to European countries.
</P>
<P>
Paul Kaminiski, the US under-secretary for defence acquistion,
has sent to Britain, Germany, France and Italy a list of more than
20 Pentagon programs which the US is prepared to open to
international partners, the Financial Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
No formal response has been made by the European countries, but
the British defence procurement minister James Arbuthnot is
expected to discuss the proposed projects during a visit to
Washington later this week, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The list include cooperation on developing new command and
control computer system and satellites to produce a "digital
battlefield" with troops and commanders on a single computer
network.
</P>
<P>
There is also the offer of cooperation on several missile
programs, including a cruise missile to be launched from aircraft
and a new medium-range air-combat missile, which Britain, Germany,
Italy and Spain will need to arm the Eurofighter.
</P>
<P>
In addition, programs such as upgrading the F-16 fighter and
E-2C radar early warning aircraft are also on the table, the
report said.
</P>
<P>
The American offer of increased defence cooperation with
European countries comes as European criticism about unequal
access to defence markets is gathering momentum.
</P>
<P>
The US defence equipment market is twice the size of that in
western Europe, yet US exports to Europe are at least double that
of European sales into America.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Britain has come under pressure for its recent
decisions to buy American Lockheed C-130J transport aircraft and
McDonnell Douglas Apache attack helicopters rather than European
alternatives.
</P>
<P>
British Defence Secretary Michael Portillo was reported as
saying during his visit to America earlier this year that Britain
would not be able to resist pressures from Europe if there was not
a "two-way street" in defence goods across the Atlantic.

<HEADLINE> State Councillor Calls For Better Protection of Historical Relics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- State Councillor Li Tieying today
urged governments at all levels to place the protection of
historical relics into long-term development plans.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a member of the Political Bureau of Central Committee
of CPC (Communist Party of China), said at an on-the-spot working
conference in the Palace Museum that a nationwide inspection on
the protection of historical remains will be launched in the near
future.
</P>
<P>
"The conservation of cultural relics of the Palace Museum
should be taken as a historical duty for all Chinese people" he
said.
</P>
<P>
Being one of the most renowned museums in the world the palace
museum boasts not only the world's most splendid imperial
architecture, but also millions of items of historical value.
Every year it is visited by more than five million tourists both
from home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
Between 1992 and 1995, China spent 41.15 million yuan on more
than a hundred protection and renovation projects at the palace
museum, including an underground storehouse containing 175,000
items of valuable relics, as well as a modernized system for fire
control and security.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the safety of the museum should be severely
protected, to eliminate any risk of fire or theft.

be given more attention, and the application of latest scientific
achievements should also accelerate in this field.

<HEADLINE> Rifkind Condemns U.S. Helms-Burton Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 29 (Xinhua) -- British Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind today condemned the United States for new
legislation punishing foreign companies that trade with Cuba.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind's attack came as the United States issued warnings to
three companies from Canada, Mexico and Italy that they may face
sanctions as the U.S. began implementing the Helms-Burton law
aimed at isolating its arch rival, Cuba.
</P>
<P>
"We regret that that action is being taken...We believe that
the principle of these powers is wrong," Rifkind told the
U.S. National Press Club.
</P>
<P>
"No one country should have the right to tell companies in
another country how they should behave in third countries," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Rifkind said he would discuss the issue with U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Secretary of State Warren Christopher during his
48-hour visit to Washington.
</P>
<P>
Clinton signed into law the Helms-Burton bill, named after its
sponsors in Congress, in March after Cuban fighter planes shot
down in February two small aircraft piloted by an anti-Cuban group
based in the U.S.. Four people were killed in the incident. Cuba
has accused the United States of violating Havana's air space.
</P>
<P>
The legislation seeks to further isolate Cuba by penalizing
foreign companies investing in and trading with the Caribbean
country. The United States has maintained economic sanctions
against Cuba since the 1960s.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. move has outraged many countries, including its
European allies, which charged that the legislation violated
international trade rules.

PESHAWAR, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The Afghan Taliban Militia had
decided to arrest all the important figures of Hezbi-i-Islami
(Hekmatyar Group) from Taliban-controlled areas, a Hezb source
said here today.
</P>
<P>
However, the Taliban source declined to comment on the Hezb

<HEADLINE> South Korea to Tighten Foreign Exchange Outflow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 30 (Xinhua) -- South Korea will tighten control on
the outflow of foreign currency in invisible trade to check the
ever-increasing current-account deficit, according to the Finance
and Economy Ministry here today.
</P>
<P>
The government feels the need to contain burgeoning invisible
trade deficit, which amounted to 1.67 billion U.S. dollars for the
first four months of this year, or 40.6 percent of the current-
account deficit for the period, a ministry official said.
</P>
<P>
Invisible trade receipts in the four-month period only
increased 9.7 percent over the same period last year to 7.36
billion dollars, but payments jumped 18 percent to 90.3 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
To stem the "reckless" outflow of foreign exchange, the Bank of
Korea, the country's central bank, will investigate all overseas
foreign exchange "gift" remittances. The bank will work with the
National Tax Administration (NTA) to trace the source of such
remittances for taxation purposes if necessary.
</P>
<P>
These remittances are currently reported to the NTA by foreign
exchange banks that sell currency for such remittances.
</P>
<P>
Emigrating families must now have a tax office examine the
source of their emigration funds before converting these money
into foreign currency.
</P>
<P>
In service trade, all payments overseas must now be reported to
the NTA for fund-source checking. At present, the NTA receives
such payment reports on a selective basis.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the government has been rather
indifferent about the need to control the outflow of foreign
currency, since it has been busy working to liberalize the foreign
exchange market.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- China will invest tens of millions
of yuan in the coming five years in improving shipping safety and
efficiency on the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, the
country's longest, a national meeting was told in Nanjing.
</P>
<P>
Part of the investment will be devoted to building a vessel
traffic service system for the section linking Wuhan, capital of
Hubei Province, with Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu Province.
</P>
<P>
The lower reaches of the river, stretching for 1,100
kilometers, is the most twisted and the busiest part of Yangtze,
which accounts for 70 percent of the country's inland river
transport.
</P>
<P>
As part of the efforts to improve traffic on the section of the
river a new system has been introduced under which vessels have to
sail in separate channels.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Ministry of Communications has poured a
total of 77 million yuan in setting up vessel traffic service
centers in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, and Zhangjiagang cities along the
river, including 12 radar stations, a micro-wave relay station and
a VHF relay station.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year shipping accidents, casualties
and economic losses in the lower reaches dropped respectively by
23.3 percent, 25.8 percent and 5.7 percent.

<HEADLINE> South Korean Opposition Parties to Rally Against Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Two South Korean opposition parties
agreed here today to hold massive outdoor rallies in several big
cities net month to protest the ruling New Korea Party (NKP)'s
parliamentary majority build-up and alleged election rigging.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was reached by the main opposition National
Congress for New Politics (NCNP) headed by Kim Dae-jung and the
conservative opposition United Liberal Democrats (ULD) led by Kim
Jong-pil.
</P>
<P>
The outdoor rallies will be held in five cities including
Taegu, Kwangju, Taejon, Inchon and Pusan from June 8 to 29
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Kim Dae-jung and Kim Jong-pil are expected to deliver speeches
at the rallies.
</P>
<P>
The two opposition parties claimed that the ruling NKP has no
intention of breaking the political deadlock through dialogue even
after a rally was held by them in Seoul on May 26.
</P>
<P>
However, the opposition parties said that the outdoor rally
program can be called off if the ruling camp accepts their
demands: a halt to the recruitment of opposition and independent
lawmakers-elect, an apology for its parliamentary majority
build-up and a commitment to revising the election laws.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, the opposition camp said that it will boycott the new
National Assembly, which will open next month, if the ruling camp
does not accept its demands.
</P>
<P>
In the 15th South Korean National Assembly elections held on
April 11, the ruling NKP headed by President Kim Young-sam won 139
seats, 11 short of a simple majority in the 299-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
But the NKP later induced opposition and independent lawmakers-
elect to join the ruling party to secure 151 seats -- more than
half the total parliamentary seats.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council decided today to extend the mandate of the United Nations
Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Israel-Syria sector
for six months until November 30.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted unanimously today, the Security Council
called upon the parties concerned to implement immediately its
resolution 338, which called upon all the parties to cease fire,
terminate all military activity, and start negotiations aimed at
establishing a just and durable peace in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made based on the recommendations of United
Nations Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali reported that UNDOF, which was established in May
1974 to supervise the cease-fire and the agreement on
disengagement between Israeli and Syrian forces, has continued to
perform its functions effectively.
</P>
<P>
"Despite the present quiet int he Israel-Syria sector, the
situation in the Middle East continues to be potentially dangerous
and is likely to remain so, unless and until a comprehensive
settlement covering all aspects of the Middle East problem can be
reached," he said.
</P>
<P>
The secretary-general, therefore, recommended that the mandate
of UNDOF be extended for six months. He also appealed to member
states to pay their assessments and to clear remaining arrears as
there was a serious shortfall in the funding of UNDOF.
</P>
<P>
After the resolution was adopted, Security Council President
Qin Huasun of China issued a complementary statement on behalf of
the council.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the secretary-general's observation on
the situation in the Middle East reflects the view of the Security
Council.

35.18 billion Naira (about 414 million Dollars) per year
excluding the cost of reducing erratic fuel supply.
</P>
<P>
He said in the early 1990s, financial losses to the government
in the energy sector amounted to 271.502 billion Naira (about 3.2
billion Dollars) per year while losses in Nigerian Railways,
Nigeria Airways, Delta Steel Company and Nigerian Airport
Authority totaled over 29.55 billion Naira (about 348 million
Dollars) a year.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank representative believed that privatization is a
way of stopping a continued drain of public resources, but
regretted that the Nigerian government derailed in implementing
the privatization process as expected.
</P>
<P>
He noted that since privatization in Nigeria is now at a
turning point, there is the need to consider contract leasing as
a substitute and the bank group and the International Finance
Corporation are readily available for assistance.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Leader Proposes Intra-Factional Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Unless a consensus amongst all
Afghan factions and forces, a reconciliation between two persons
couldn't solve the long-term problem, an Afghan factional leader
said here today.
</P>
<P>
Talking to newsmen, Syed Ahmad Gailani, chief of the Afghan
National Islamic Front, stressed the need for an early meeting
among all Afghan politicians, commanders and tribal chieftains for
a negotiated settlement to the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the new alliance between two arch rivals --
Afghan President Burhanuddin Rabbani and former prime minister
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, Gailani said, "it is nothing new in the said
patch-up."
</P>
<P>
Elaborating his point of view, he recalled that three years
before, Hekmatyar was the prime minister of the Rabbani's regime,
in the light of the Jalalabad and Islamabad Accords.
</P>
<P>
But Rabbani and Hekmatyar had no confidence in each other, he
said, adding that finally, Hekmatyar launched an abortive coup
against Rabbani at the beginning of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Afghanistan does not belong to two, seven or 12 persons, he
stressed, adding that this is a homeland of millions of people and
unless assembling of their genuine representatives, no one could
resolve the conflict.
</P>
<P>
Gailani proposed to convene an emergency meeting of the Afghan
traditional Loya Jirga (Grand National Assembly) to end the
ongoing crisis.
</P>
<P>
Gailani is a relatively neutral factional leader who got
involved in few factional fightings in the past four years.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar signed an reconciliation agreement with Rabbani last
Friday.

<HEADLINE> Afghan Leaders to Hold Meeting on New Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PESHAWAR, May 30 (Xinhua) -- An Afghan factional leader arrived
in the southern Afghan city of Kandahar today to discuss new
alliances among Afghan warring factions while more Afghan leaders
are coming in the next few days.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Masoom Afghani, spokesman of the Afghan
Taliban religious student militia, while talking to Xinhua
correspondent here in the northwestern Pakistani city.
</P>
<P>
Afghani said Maulani Khalis, chief of his own faction of
Hezb-i-Islami, has arrived in Kandahar.
</P>
<P>
Muhammad Nabi Muhammadi, leader of the Afghan Islamic
Revolutionary Movement, Amin Mojaddedi, son of Sigbhatullah
al-Mojaddedi who is the chief of Nejat-i-Melli Afghanistan and
Hamid Gilani, leader of Shore-ye-melli Inqilab-i-Islami would
arrive in Kandahar tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
The leaders will discuss the new alliance between President
Burhanuddin Rabbani and his former arch rival Gulbuddin Hekmatyar.
</P>
<P>
Military cooperation would also come under discussion during
the meeting to be held in the Taliban's headquarters.
</P>
<P>
These factions have not been involved in the four-year
factional fighting and most of them remained neutral during the
civil war.
</P>
<P>
The Taliban's meeting is believed to be aimed at countering the
new alliance of Rabbani and Hekmatyar, which would pose a threat
to the Taliban.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Rabbani and Hekmatyar launched an attack today on
the Taliban who has been besieging the capital of Kabul since last
October, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
He said the Taliban soldiers have repulsed the attack near
Charasyab, some 20 kilometers south of Kabul. No casualties were
reported.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Opposition Party Raps Constitution Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Zambian opposition United National
Independence Party (UNIP) today dismissed the signing of the 1966
constitution amendment bill into law to bar its President Kenneth
Kaunda from contesting the presidential elections as Unzambian.
</P>
<P>
UNIP National Chairman Malimba Masheke denied that UNIP has no
leader to take over from Kaunda when he retires or fails to
contest the presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
There is no leadership crisis in his party because Kaunda was
"democratically elected party leader and that qualifies him to
challenge President Chiluba," said Masheke.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the ruling Multi-Party Democratic Movement (MMD)
for being bent on frustrating members of opposition parties by
telling alleged lies against Kaunda, who ruled Zambia after its
independence in 1964 until he was defeated by incumbent President
Frederick Chiluba in the country's first multi-party elections in
1991.
</P>
<P>
Under the bill signed by Chiluba on Tuesday, Kaunda can not
contest the presidency in the general elections late this year
because his parents are Malawian immigrants.

<HEADLINE> UN Extends Mandate of Peace-Keeping Force in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Security
Council today decided to extend the mandate of the the United
Nations Preventive Deployment Force (UNPREDEP) in the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia for six months terminating on
November 30.
</P>
<P>
In a resolution adopted with 14 votes in favor and one
abstention from Russia today, the Security Council reaffirmed its
commitment to the independence, sovereignty and territorial
integrity of the former Yugoslav Republic of Mecedonia.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the security situation of the former Yugoslav
Republic of Macedonia has improved, but it is too early to be
confident that stability has been established in the region.
</P>
<P>
The council appreciated the important role played by the
UNPREDEP in contributing to the maintenance of peace and
stability.
</P>
<P>
It welcomed the signing of the agreement between the former
Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia of last April and urged both parties to implement it in
full, including the demarcation of their mutual border.
</P>
<P>
The council also welcomed the the progress achieved in
improving relations between former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia
and Greece on the basis of the Interim Accord of last September.
</P>
<P>
Chinese ambassador Qin Huasun said at the council meeting that
UNPREDEP has played an important role in curbing the spread of the
conflicts in the former Yugoslavia and stabilizing the situation
in the region.
</P>
<P>
However, Chinese delegation considered that the U.N.
peace-keeping operations, including preventive deployment
operations, should follow the established principles and terminate
after they complete their tasks. China hopes that UNPREDEDP should
reduce its force with the continuing improvement of the situation
and finally terminate its mission smoothly.

<HEADLINE> S.Africa Minister Blames Poor Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Poor management has to take
most of the blame for South Africa's low productivity, Finance
Minister Trevor Manuel said today in Cape Town.
</P>
<P>
Manuel made the remarks in a response to questions in the
finance budget debate about a report which ranked South Africa
the 44th out of a group of 46 countries in terms of productivity.
</P>
<P>
The report was compiled by the International Institute of
Management Development.
</P>
<P>
"Without a doubt in South Africa, the major let-down is
managerial productivity," said Manuel, citing the reported sad
reflection of managerial competence in the country.
</P>
<P>
Referring to state-owned enterprises, Manuel said a process to
begin implementing management of parastatals along corporate
lines is being finalized.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, the government has to exercise its role as a
shareholder in the parastatals. Issues being attended to include
dividend policy, tax policy, government guarantees and a shift
away from hidden subsidies, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
"This exercise forms an integral part of the reprioritization
of state assets," said the minister.

<HEADLINE> Britain Attacks EU Fishing Fleet Reduction Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The British government has launched
a fierce attack upon the European Union (EU) proposals of imposing
a 40-percent cutbacks to the already hard-pressed British fishing
fleet.
</P>
<P>
The EU Fisheries Commissioner Emma Bonino announced on
Wednesday that fishing fleet capacity will have to be cut up to 40
percent over the next six years to ensure the survival of the EU
fishing industry.
</P>
<P>
Reacting angrily to the EU proposed cutbacks, British Fisheries
Minister Tony Baldry said, "UK fishermen will have been very angry
with what Mrs Bonino had to say yesterday and the way in which she
said it."
</P>
<P>
"UK fishermen who are often working in hazardous conditions
will have been angered with being described as 'bad boys',
particularly when Mrs Bonino singles out the Spanish as 'good
guys' on decommissioning of fishing boats, when a significant
number of Spanish-owned fishing vessels are fishing in British
waters."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the chairman of the Conservative backbench fisheries
committee has condemned the decision by Brussels as "completely
unacceptable".
</P>
<P>
Elizabeth Stevenson, a leader of the Cornish Fish Producers
Organization, said the EU plan would be catastrophic and she
pointed out that the only solution to the problem was to stop
foreign ships fishing British waters under "flags of convenience".
</P>
<P>
British Prime Minister John Major has early told the British
parliament that it was contrary to the original spirit of the EU
Common Fisheries Policy that fishermen from other EU countries
could buy licenced British trawlers in order to land as part of
Britain's permitted fishing quota.
</P>
<P>
The British fleet, which has been cut by 7 percent since 1992
when the EU Commission ordered compulsory reductions, still falls
far short of the EU target.
</P>
<P>
One EU Commission official explained that "the problem for the
UK that it has a backlog from previous capacity cutting rounds and
necessary measures have not been put in place."
</P>
<P>
Britain's failure to meet the requirements will eventually
prevent its fishermen's access to EU's 1.05 billion pounds (about
1.6 billion U.S. dollars) scheme for restructuring and modernizing
fleets.

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Egyptian-Chinese Ties Opens in Cairo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, May 30 (Xinhua) -- A symposium on Egyptian-Chinese
relations and prospects of the 21st century, organized by the
Asian Studies Center of Cairo University, opened here today.
</P>
<P>
It is being attended by Egyptian Education Minister Hussein
Bahaa Eddine, Egyptian Assistant Foreign Minister Abu Zeid, and
Chinese Ambassador in Cairo Yang Fuchang and other representatives.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the inaugural session, Eddine hailed the steady
development of relations of friendship and cooperation between
Egypt and China since the establishment of diplomatic relations
between the two countries in 1956.
</P>
<P>
He said that international political conditions had changed,
but Egyptian-Chinese relations have remained as firm as ever.
</P>
<P>
The Egyptian minister noted that both Egypt and China have had
great ancient civilizations. While China occupies important
position in Asia, Egypt does the same in Africa. The two countries
play important roles in their respective regions.
</P>
<P>
He expressed appreciation for China's performance in economic
reform and nation-wide development, indicating that Egypt could
benefit from the Chinese experience in economic reform.
</P>
<P>
On the recent visit to Egypt by Chinese President Jiang Zemin,
the Egyptian education minister said that in his capacity as head
of the mission of honor accompanying the Chinese president, he may
say that President Jiang's visit was extremely successful. It has
strengthened the ties between Egypt and China, and will
undoubtedly help accelerate the growth of the existing ties of
friendship and cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
On his part, the Chinese ambassador said that the Chinese and
Egyptian peoples, ever since the establishment of diplomatic
relations 40 years ago, had supported and helped each other at
international platforms as well as in national reconstruction. He
pointed out that Chinese-Egyptian friendship has remained firm,
strong and deep-rooted.
</P>
<P>
He said that in view of the fact that the situation in the
world and the Middle East was undergoing profound changes, both
China and Egypt, in their capacity as two important developing
countries, assume the paramount responsibility of activating world
development toward multi-polarization and respecting the
developing countries' rights and interests.
</P>
<P>
Participants in the symposium reviewed the development of the
ties of friendship and cooperation between China and Egypt over
the past 40 years. They expressed high esteem for the fruits of
cooperation between the two countries in the political, economic,
cultural and other fields.
</P>
<P>
China and Egypt established diplomatic relations on May 30,
1956.

<HEADLINE> Reactions to Initial Israeli Election Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, May 30 (Xinhua) -- People around the world followed
the Israeli election results throughout Wednesday night and today,
wondering what shape of the Middle East peace process will take if
a right-wing leader becomes Israel's next prime minister.
</P>
<P>
With 99.9 percent of the votes counted so far, Likud candidate
Benjamin Netanyahu led Labor Party candidate Shimon Peres, current
premier, by 50.4 percent to 49.6 percent in the prime ministerial
race.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Central Election Committee said today that the
counting of the rest votes will only be completed on Friday
afternoon or Saturday evening when a winner will be officially
announced.
</P>
<P>
In reactions to the initial results of the elections,
Palestinian Council member Hanan Ashrawi said that if Netanyahu
wins, it will make the situation more complicated, but there is no
need of getting into a panic.
</P>
<P>
"The peace process will continue," Ashrawi told Israel
Television, adding that because "the peace is the common interest
for both (the Israeli and Palestinian) peoples."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mustafa al-Natsheh, mayor of the West Bank town of
Hebron, was more disappointed with the results, calling the
situation "dangerous," and urging Peres to complete the
redeployment of the Israeli army in Hebron before he leaves
office.
</P>
<P>
According to the Oslo accords between Israel and the
Palestinians, the Israeli army was scheduled to complete its
withdrawal from Hebron by March 28, but Israel postponed the
pullout until after Wednesday's general elections due to security
reasons
</P>
<P>
In the Gaza Strip, Palestinian National Authority President
Yasser Arafat, who monitored the Israeli elections in his
headquarters, remained tight-lipped, making no comments on the
initial results.
</P>
<P>
However, Arafat's top adviser Ziad Abu Ziad said today that
the Oslo accords were signed between the Palestinians and the
Israeli government, and should not be damaged by an election
success of Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"There is no turning back from peace," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, has
called Netanyahu's success in the elections "a war against the
Palestinians and Arabs."
</P>
<P>
Hamas official Razi Mohammed said in Gaza today that the
Israeli voters have showed that they do not want peace, but want a
crisis in the relations between Israel and Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In Jordan, today's newspapers expressed deep disappointment to
the initial results of the Israeli elections, saying "peace is
made by Peres and destroyed by Netanyahu."
</P>
<P>
Publicly, Jordanian officials maintained that any change of
the Israeli government will not destroy the 1994 peace treaty
between the Hashemite Kingdom and the State of Israel.
</P>
<P>
However, Jordanian public and government officials believe
that with Netanyahu as the new Israeli prime minister, the peace
process in the Middle East is lost.
</P>
<P>
A Jordanian political analyst said that "the loser in the
elections is not only Peres but the whole peace process in the
region."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, U.S. President Bill Clinton said in Washington
today that the U.S. policy toward Israel and the Middle East peace
process will not change, regardless of whoever becomes the next
Israeli prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"If Israel is prepared to take risks for peace, we are
determined to do our best to reduce the risks and increase the
security for Israel," said Clinton, who had repeatedly expressed
his support for Peres' peace policy before the elections.
</P>
<P>
In another related development, the Israeli media reported that
a three-way summit will be held next week in the Egyptian Red Sea
resort of Taba between Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Jordan's
King Hussein and Arafat to discuss the results of the Israeli
elections.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa's Non-Smokers Increase by 2 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The number of South African
non-smokers has increased by two percent during the past year as the
public heeded government health warnings, Health Department officials
said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a reception in Cape Town to mark the World
No-Tobacco Day, which falls on tomorrow, the department's Policy and
Planning Deputy Director Ayanda Ntsaluba said the Human Sciences
Research Council and the Medical Research Council had found in a
survey, commissioned by the department, that ''the regulations
requiring health warnings on tobacco advertisements and tobacco
packaging have been effective in reducing smoking in South
Africa''.
</P>
<P>
The survey was conducted among a nationally representative sample
of 2,200 adults.
</P>
<P>
The survey showed that while 34 percent of adults smoked in
February 1995, the figure had dropped to 32 percent in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
Ntsaluba said: ''The decline in the number of people who smoke may
appear modest but given the addictiveness of nicotine the achievement
is significant.''
</P>
<P>
The survey also found that 78 percent of the population supported
regulating smoking in public places, while 68 percent wanted a ban on
tobacco advertising.
</P>
<P>
A statement by the department says the health warnings were
seen by 83 percent of the adult population and 95 percent of
those who had seen, read or heard the warnings thought they were
helpful and informative. enditem

<HEADLINE> Oil-for-Food Accord Helps Improve Ties with UN, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Chief Iraqi negotiator with the
United Nations Abdul Amir al Anbari said the signing of the
oil-for food accord by Iraq and the U.N. helped improve the
relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
In an exclusive interview published in today's Iraqi newspaper
Al Thawra, Anbari said that the oil-for-food deal permits Iraq to
export 2 billion U.S. dollars worth of oil, the greater part of
which will be spent on the purchase of foodstuffs in conformity
with the rules set in the accord.
</P>
<P>
On the attitudes of U.N. Security Council members to the
oil-for -food accord, Anbari said that most members of the
Security Council were keen on a speedy agreement in order to
alleviate the suffering of the Iraqi people, noting that they
found in the deal the possibility of reducing the damages caused
by the sanctions imposed on Iraq following its invasion of Kuwait
in August 1990.
</P>
<P>
He said that these countries represent the overwhelming
majority of the Security Council, foremost among which are France,
Russia, China, Indonesia, Egypt and Chile.
</P>
<P>
Anbari said that as a matter of fact, Iraq and the United
Nations are keen on the implementation of the text of the accord
as soon as possible.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Guerrillas Ambush Israeli Patrol in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese anti-Israeli guerrillas
ambushed tonight an Israeli foot patrol inside the so-called
"security zone" in south Lebanon tonight, and security sources
said three Israeli soldiers were killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
Guerrillas carried out the ambush on the road between the
Israeli positions of Sejound and Rihan in Jezzine area at 20:00
(17:00 GMT), the security sources in south Lebanon said.
</P>
<P>
The attackers opened fire with machine-guns and anti-tank
rockets when the Israeli patrol fell in the ambush.
</P>
<P>
The guerrillas and the Israeli troops exchanged fire in a
short distance, the sources said, adding that three Israeli
soldiers were killed in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic Resistance, the military wing of the pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, claimed responsibility for the
attack, which has not been officially confirmed by the Israeli
army nor the Israeli client of the South Lebanon Army (SLA)
militia.
</P>
<P>
Immediately after the ambush, the Israeli occupation forces
intensively shelled Iglim Al-Tofah, a mountain area opposite the
buffer enclave which is often used by Lebanese Shiite moslems to
launch attacks at the Israeli-occupied border strip in south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, at least three Israeli soldiers were killed and
five others wounded in a bombing attack launched by guerrillas of
Hezbollah at an Israeli convoy in the buffer zone in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Hezbollah guerrillas detonated two bombs targeting the
convoy comprising three jeeps on Marjayoun Road deeply inside the
border strip.
</P>
<P>
One nurse of the SLA militia and a cameraman of a local
television were also injured in the attack, which took place at an
Israeli position only one kilometer away from the residence of
General Antoine Lahd, commander of the SLA militia, in Marjayoun
town.

<HEADLINE> World Bank: Cities Are the Developing World Future </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) --The financial, economic and
social future of developing countries depends primarily on the
future of their rapidly growing cities, the World Bank notes in a
report released today.
</P>
<P>
The report, entitled "Livable Cities for the 21th Century", is
prepared and will be presented to the Habitat II Conference, the
UN conference on cities, to be held in Istanbul, Turkey, from June
3 to 14, this year.
</P>
<P>
The report says despite the staggering problems cities face in
developing countries, more that half of all gross domestic product
(GDP) now comes out of cities, even though urban populations are
less than half of the overall national population.
</P>
<P>
The urbanization of the developing world is unstoppable. In
1960, less than 22 percent of the developing world's population
lived in cities. By 1990, it rose to 34 percent and will exceed 50
percent by 2020. But problems caused by rapid urbanization in the
developing countries can be cheaper and easier to fix than many
people imagine, the report says.
</P>
<P>
The solutions to the problems in cities lie in the cities
themselves, in their own human and investment capital, underlines
the World Bank which has invested 25 billion U.S. dollars in more
than 5,000 cities and towns since 1972. Over the next five years,
the World Bank plans to invest an additional 15 billion dollars in
urban development programs.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank puts forward four recommendations for urban
development which include: charge more realistic user fees for
water, electricity, and public transportation, instead of
subsidizing the rich and the middle class; make better use of
other local sources of financing, such as the property tax and
special levies for neighbourhood improvement programs; bring the
private sector into areas and improve the nuts and bolts of city
management, such as budgets and capital investment plans, to
become creditworthy.
</P>
<P>
"In most cities, governments do not bring people in on the
decisions that matter most to them, says Ismail Serageldin, World
Bank Vice President for Environmentally Sustainable Development.
"It's not surprising that people are reluctant to pay their local
taxes, because they don't get the services they want."
</P>
<P>
Cities must become more productive, efficient and competitive,
asserts the World Bank. Where cities do manage services
responsively, they can attract financing from individuals,
national governments, international agencies and foreign
investors.

<HEADLINE> Muslims Blamed for Blowing Up Bridge in Bosnia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Serb authorities today
blamed the Muslims for the damage of a bridge on River Janja which
links the two entities in northeastern Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Miladin Stjepanovic, a Serb official in the Serb town of
Ugljevik, said it was Muslims who blew up the bridge some 10 km
away from this town in northeastern Bosnia Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
NATO-led Implementation Force (IFOR) spokesman Major Herve
Gourmelon said earlier today that the bridge in the town of Krstac
in the southwest of Bijeljina was rendered impassable after an
explosive device was activated on it Wednesday morning. But it was
still unclear who blew the bridge and an investigation was
underway.
</P>
<P>
The bridge which links Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat
federation was destroyed in an area where the border had been
changed in agreement with the Muslims, Stjepanovic said.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the demarcation line between the two
entities is the river Janja, the Bosnian Serb news agency SRNA
quoted Stjepanovic as explaining.
</P>
<P>
Muslims destroyed the bridge because they were displeased with
the agreement, he said, adding the Muslims had not allowed Serb
police to take part in the investigation.

<HEADLINE> Peacekeepers Take Firm Control Over Liberian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The west African peacekeeping forces
have taken "firm control" over Monrovia, capital of war-torn
Liberia, as disarmament of factional fighters and deployment of
peacekeepers began in the country.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile in downtown Monrovia, merchants and shopkeepers
began to repair and reinforce their stores and supermarkets which
had been damaged by looting at the latest round of factional
fighting starting from April 6, said a report reaching here
today.
</P>
<P>
Residents whose homes escaped widespread arson tackled mounds
of debris left on the streets by the looters, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
"Were the buildings fighting the war?" asked one resident as
he surveyed the burnt remains of his Newport Street home.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this week, civilians in the Paynesville Suburb of
Monrovia booed as hundreds of disarmed militiamen loyal to
Liberia's largest warlord Charkes Taylor left in trucks for the
central Liberian town of Gbarnga, Taylor's stronghold.
</P>
<P>
The civilians jeered the fighters, calling them "rogues and
looters", a witness was quoted by the report as saying.
</P>
<P>
More than 110 corpses, many victims of factional fighting, lie
in temporary mass graves around a camp for the displaced in
Monrovia, said the report.
</P>
<P>
It quoted an international aid worker as saying that many of
the died during the armed clash between Taylor's militiamen and
the soldiers loyal to the country's another warlord Roosevelt
Johnson.
</P>
<P>
"People started to rebuild their homes and pacify the dead,"
said a Monrovia resident.
</P>
<P>
And international aid began to be in place to facilitate the
disarmament and redeployment of peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The west African country is scheduled to hold its post-war
general elections on August 20, according to the peace accord
signed last August in the Nigerian capital of Abuja.

"We will wait and see if this can happen," said another

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav President Calls for Equal Treatment to </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav President Zoran Lilic
today urged the international community to treat all sides in
Bosnia equally in order to safeguard peace and prevent the
breakout of new conflicts which would jeopardize peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
At the talks with visiting Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny
Primakov, Lilic said the international war crimes tribunal in the
Hague would also have to adhere to the principle of equality when
determining war crimes committed in the former Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
Among the 57 war criminals in the former Yugoslavia formally
indicted by the Hague international tribunal, 46 are Serbs,
including Serb leader Radovan Karadzic and Serb army chief
commander Ratko Mladic. The rest are Croats, eight, and Muslims,
three.
</P>
<P>
Lilic told the Russian guest that the priorities of
Yugoslavia's policy were peace in the territory of
Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the whole region, economic revival and
development, a statement issued by the presidential information
office said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it was necessary for Yugoslavia to speed up
its integration in international financial and trade institutions.
Any new conditions posed to Yugoslavia in that process were
totally unacceptable and Yugoslavia was trying hard to rejoin the
International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and other financial
bodies as well as the United Nations, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, the two sides showed an identity of
viewpoints on the consistent implementation of the Bosnia peace
agreement signed in Paris at the end of 1995, the statement added.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, Primakov said the Yugoslav leadership was
absolutely convinced that it was necessary to implement all
provisions of the Dayton peace accords and to make elections in
Bosnia hold in September as scheduled.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a press conference before his departure, the
Russian foreign minister, who arrived here Wednesday for a two-day
official visit, said that such an approach, which would lead to a
stabilization of the situation in Bosnia, was also confirmed by
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
He also said a successful election "will make it possible for
the Bosnian Serb Republika Srpska to acquire legitimacy for the
first time," and make the sanctions totally lifted. The lifting of
sanctions against Yugoslavia and the Bosnian Serb side was
conditioned by the holding of elections in Bosnia slated for
September, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added the development of bilateral cooperation had also been
much discussed during his visit. The development of relations
between the two countries had good prospects, he pointed out.

<HEADLINE> Britain Steps Up Campaign to End EU Beef Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister John Major is
planning to mount a determined campaign in a bid to persuade his
European Union (EU) partners to end the worldwide ban on British
beef product exports.
</P>
<P>
Senior British government ministers headed by Foreign Secretary
Malcolm Rifkind are to tour the capitals of other EU countries in
an effort to woo EU leaders, according to a BBC television report.
</P>
<P>
The British campaigning delegation will first go to Bonn,
capital of Germany, which is most strongly opposed to any
relaxation of the two-month-old ban on British beef exports.
</P>
<P>
The British government last Tuesday announced a non-cooperation
policy with the EU and demanded a clear "framework" for lifting
the ban before the EU summit due to be held in Florence, Italy,
later next month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the BBC television quoted an EU Italian Presidency
spokesman as saying earlier today that Britain is set to win an
easing of the global ban next week, when the EU agriculture
ministers are holding a special conference to discuss lifting of
the ban on the exports of the British beef by-products gelatine,
tallow and semen.
</P>
<P>
However, the spokesman warned that Britain will face a rebuff
if it insists on a clear timetable for lifting the total ban on
British beef exports, which was imposed on March 27.
</P>
<P>
The British government has vowed to continue disrupting normal
EU business until there is a decision to lift the ban on some
British beef by-product exports and a clear timetable for a
step-by-step lifting of the total ban.

<HEADLINE> Broad Use Of Encryption Technologies Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, May 30 (Xinhua) -- The United States should promote
commercial use of encryption technologies to prevent unauthorized
access to electronic information, a committee of the U.S. National
Research Council said in a report released here today.
</P>
<P>
The committee said a broad application of cryptography will
make it easier to protect from crime and terrorism such nationally
critical assets as banking and telecommunications networks,
provide greater privacy to individuals and boost the international
competitiveness of U.S. companies.
</P>
<P>
No law should bar the manufacture, sale or use of any form of
encryption within the U.S., and export controls should be relaxed
but not eliminated, the committee said. It also stressed that the
development of encryption technologies should be driven largely by
market forces rather than by government-imposed requirements.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that adoption of our recommendations would lead to
enhanced protection and privacy for individuals and businesses in
many areas, ranging from cellular and other wireless phone
conversations to electronic transmission of sensitive business or
financial documents," said committee chairman Kenneth Dam,
professor of the University of Chicago.
</P>
<P>
Cryptography is the use of mathematical formulas to encrypt
electronic information so that it is indecipherable without the
proper digital "key."

The new system will operate on a 28.8 baud modem, the fastest
traditional modem available on the market. Intel will supply
software and technical specifications for the modems to PC makers,
who will add a video camera and market their PCs as "video ready."
</P>
<P>
Compaq Computer Corp. is expected to be the first PC maker to
offer the new system, starting in late summer. The video system
will require a Pentium chip with a speed of at least 133
megahertz. The package can also be added on the existing machines.

Using Intel's package, PC users will be able to call each other
by telephone over standard telephone lines, then switch over to PC
teleconferencing on the same line.

On the computer monitor, the video picture would measure four
by five inches. Because of the relatively low transmission speeds
involved, Intel said the video-conferencing picture will be of
relatively poor quality, similar to pictures found on monitors in
apartment lobbies. It now requires paying long-distance charges.
</P>
<P>
An Intel spokesman said the company is working on
Internet-based video, which is currently complex and the
connections can sometimes be erratic.
</P>
<P>
The system can also be used to transmit high-quality still
photos, the company said.
