<HEADLINE> Investment in Montreal Real Estate Plunges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Domestic investment in Montreal's
real estate market plunged 58.8 percent to 118 million U.S dollars
in the first half of this year from 288 million over the same
period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The slump in investment in Canada's second largest city
indicated that investors have yet to regain faith in the
French-speaking province of Quebec following last October's
referendum over independence from Canada, the newspaper "Financial
Post" said today.
</P>
<P>
In Toronto, Canada's largest city, investment climbed 14.2
percent to 737 million U.S. dollars during the first six months of
this year from 647 million in the first half of last year.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin: Cabinet Changes "Substantial," not "Drastic" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin
said today there will be "substantial," but not "drastic"
changes in the new government headed by Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin.
</P>
<P>
"There will be substantial changes in the new government, but
they will not be drastic," Yeltsin told reporters this morning
after his 90-minute discussion with Chernomyrdin in the Barvikha
sanatorium outside Moscow where he's resting.
</P>
<P>
He said that they discussed all aspects of the future
government, including its structure, ministries, departments, and
federal services.
</P>
<P>
"The number of federal bodies of power, members of the cabinet
of ministers, departments and committees" will be reduced, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the number of powerful ministries, such as the defense and
foreign ministries, will remain unchanged and one of the vice
premiers will be in charge of the entire industrial sector.
</P>
<P>
It was too early to make public the names of future cabinet
members discussed with the prime minister during their meeting,
said the president.
</P>
<P>
He added that after his inauguration on August 9, he will ask
the State Duma (lower house of parliament) to confirm
Chernomyrdin's nomination as premier and will charge him with
forming the new government immediately after that.
</P>
<P>
Government administration chief Vladimir Babichev said there
will be 24-26 ministries in the new government instead of the
current 24. But the number of other state departments and
committees is likely to fall, he said.

JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South African National Party
(NP) leader F. W. de Klerk and Inkatha Freedom Party (IFP) leader
Mangosuthu Buthelezi today held talks and agreed to continue
"informal cooperation" in Kwazulu/Natal Province.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders held talks in Ulundi in the north of
Kwazulu/Natal ahead of an IFP annual general conference and an NP
federal congress, fueling speculation about an imminent NP/IFP
alliance.
</P>
<P>
The meeting was also attended by senior NP and IFP officials,
including Kwazulu/Natal NP leader Danie Schutte and IFP National
Chairman, Kwazulu/Natal Provincial Government Premier Frank
Mdlalose.
</P>
<P>
According to a joint statement issued after the meeting, the
talks were focused on the implications of the NP's withdrawal
from the government of national unity (GNU) and eight of the
country's nine provincial governments.
</P>
<P>
On May 9, just one day after the adoption of the new
constitution, de Klerk announced that the NP would withdraw from
the GNU to become an official opposition because the new
constitution does not provide a power-sharing mechanism in the
executive branch.

<HEADLINE> Ariane-5 Rocket Explosion Caused by Software Errors </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The explosion of Europe's first
Ariane-5 rocket on June 4 was caused by software errors in its
guidance system, the European Space Agency said today after a
six-week long probe.
</P>
<P>
"The loss...was due to specification and design errors in the
software of the inertial reference system," the ESA said in a
report issued at a news conference today.
</P>
<P>
The Ariane-5 rocket blew up on its maiden flight 37 seconds
after roaring into the sky from the French space center in Kourou,
French Guyana. Four scientific satellites on board worth 500
million U.S. dollars were destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The software of the launching panel was designed for the
Ariane-4 rocket, and it could not understand what was going on
after Ariane-5 went up with a speed much higher than her
predecessor, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Seeing that the control center was incapable of functioning
normally, the coordinating mechanism tried to guide the rocket by
abruptly moving the nozzle and two accelerators. This broke the
launcher and caused the rocket to explode, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The report made 14 recommendations to avoid a repetition of the
disaster, including a critical reappraisal of all software,
improved testing, using real equipment and components and real
trajectories in launch simulations.
</P>
<P>
The explosion was a major setback for Western Europe's bid to
extend its dominance of the lucrative world satellite launch
market into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
ESA director-general Jean-Marie Luton predicted that the
launch of a second Ariane-5 will now be postponed until the first
half of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Arafat, Israeli FM Agree on Further Contacts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Foreign Minister David
Levy and Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat today
held talks and agreed to hold further contacts to push forward the
peace process.
</P>
<P>
This is the first high-level contact between the PA and Israeli
new government after it took power in June. However, the meeting
is regarded as highly symbolic rather than substantive as the two
focused mainly on the frameworks and procedures for future
contacts.
</P>
<P>
After holding a 90-minute talks at the Erez crossing this
afternoon, Levy said the meeting was conducted in a "free and
open" atmosphere, and he found Arafat was "deeply interested in
advancing the peace process."
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister said he and Arafat agreed to establish an
open dialogue to resolve all "delicate problems" in the peace
process.
</P>
<P>
Describing the meeting as "fruitful, conductive and positive,"
Arafat said the meeting has contributed to the peace process. He
added that the two sides agreed to hold further contacts on all
levels "in the same attitude."
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Arafat asked Levy to convey his greetings
to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
However, the meeting apparently did not touch on the crucial
issue of a possible meeting between Arafat and Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
The two also failed to discuss in depth the crucial issues
dividing the two sides on pushing forward the peace process,
including troops redeployment from Hebron, Jewish settlements and
the final status talks.
</P>
<P>
While pledging to honor the peace accords signed by the
previous Israeli government and the Palestinians, the Netanyahu
government has vowed to reject any compromise on the issues of
Jerusalem, expansion of Jewish settlements and opposing the
establishment of an independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu also has conditioned the progress of future peace
talks on PA's fulfillment of its commitments, especially in
combating terrorism.
</P>
<P>
To achieve any progress of future peace talks, a meeting
between Arafat and Netanyahu is widely regarded as pivotal. But
Netanyahu has indicated that he would only do so if it was vital
for Israel's security.
</P>
<P>
Uzi Landau, chairman of the Foreign Affairs and Defense
Committee of Israel's Knesset (parliament), said today that
talking about such a meeting now seemed to be premature.
</P>
<P>
"Such a meeting will definitely not take place now. The
problem is there are a number of violations of the peace
agreements," he said, referring to the alleged PA "reluctance to
combat terrorism" and its "illegal activities" in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Israeli opposition Labor party welcomed the Levy-Arafat
meeting, but said it doubted the prospects of reaching a final
peace settlement between Israel and the Palestinians before the
Likud government changing its hardline police guidelines.
</P>
<P>
"We should be satisfied with such a meeting, which is
positive. But I don't think any substantive issues were
raised. It's only a beginning, as the big question is still
hanging in the air," said Yossi Beilin, a former minister in the
previous Labor-Meretze coalition government.
</P>
<P>
He added that if the Likud government insisted on its
opposition to any Arab sovereignty on the Palestinian
territories, it is doubtful that Israel would reach a final
settlement with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Execute Assassins against Rafsanjani </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Iran announced here today that
it will execute two Iranians who attempted to assassinate
President Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani about two and a half years
ago.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran Islamic Revolution Court declared that Kourosh
Nikakhtar and Seyyed Mohammad Moussavinia are to be executed and
Mohsen Salsahi, also charged with involvement in the failed
attempt, is to serve a three-year imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
The court said that the three were arrested at the shrine of
the late Iranian spiritual leader Imam Khomeini on February 1,
1994 after an aborted assassination against Rafsanjani.
</P>
<P>
However, the court gave no specific date for the execution.
</P>
<P>
Iranian Information Minister Ali Fallahiyan said earlier that
Nikakhtar, who had served as a reporter for an Iranian police
magazine Negahban (The Guard), fired five bullets into the air
while Rafsanjani was delivering a speech at the shrine.
</P>
<P>
Nikakhtar and his friend Moussavinia went to the shrine of
Imam Khomeini and found they could not get close to
President Rafsanjani so they decided to fire from a distance
ranging from 50 to 60 meters, Fallahiyan said.
</P>
<P>
"The first shot was directed towards the podium from where
President Rafsanjani was addressing the audience," he said, "in
haste he was unable to fire the other shots in that
direction."
</P>
<P>
According to earlier reports, over 20 people were arrested in
connection with the assassination attempt on Rafsanjani. There was
no word on the fate of others.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai National Carrier Faces Era of Change </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Thai Airways International (THAI)
is undergoing a period of re-engineering as competition
intensifies among travel and aviation industries worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Cutting costs and improving services and staff productivity are
the common slogans for the national carrier, but the ongoing
re-engineering is focusing on ways to reform the state-run
company's internal structures.
</P>
<P>
The airline opened a corporate planning conference on Monday
and sweeping changes for the company could be expected after the
conference. Privatization is among the major moves under way to
restructure the company.
</P>
<P>
The carrier currently is 93 percent owned by the Finance
Ministry and is traded on the stock market as a partially publicly
listed company, under the purview of the Transportation and
Communication Ministry. Its board of directors mainly consists of
government officials and chaired by the air force.
</P>
<P>
The best thing for the legal or corporate privatization of THAI
was "virtual privatization," said Ian Buchanan, head of THAI's
re-engineering consulting team.
</P>
<P>
The virtual privatization means that the government can retain
its ownership of the holding company but create under it a
subsidiary structure which can operate along the lines of a
private company, Buchanan said.
</P>
<P>
Another re-engineering measure is targeting at a major
readjustment of the company's personnel policies to improve
productivity and quality of cabin crew and ground support staff.
</P>
<P>
THAI is also exerting efforts to upgrade ground service
equipment, tap the potential of the existing facilities, reduce
aircraft turnaround time, and improve the availability of
inventory.
</P>
<P>
Anyway, re-engineering the airline is a tough task and will
take time. Success or failure, the process will pioneer a road for
the development of Thailand's aviation and tourism industries.

<P>
In a special message to the just-released "Singapore,
1965-1995, Statistical Highlights - A Review of 30 Years'
Development," Minister for Trade and Industry Yeo Cheow Tong said
that in the past three decades, "our per capita income has risen;
we enjoy low inflation; and our economy has successfully shifted
to more sophisticated, higher value-added industries."
</P>
<P>
"However, there are certain trends revealing problems which we
may face in the future. The divorce rate has increased, birth rate
has fallen and the population is fast aging," he warned.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics published in the review, marriage
rates have dipped significantly. For males aged 25-29 years, for
every thousand people, there were 115 married men in 1995,
compared with 173 in 1970. The number for the 30-34 age group was
down from 172 to 111.
</P>
<P>
The marriage rate for females also declined sharply, from 192
to 139 per thousand for the 25-29 age group and from 124 to 70 per
thousand for those aged 20-24 years.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, divorce rates have risen for both males and
females of all age groups. The general rate rose from 3.7 per
thousand males and 3.8 per thousand females in 1980 to 6.2 and 6.3
respectively in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Lower marriage rates have also led to a lower birth rate, which
declined from 30 per thousand in 1965 to 18 per thousand by 1980.
And it dropped further to 16 in 1995, the figures showed.
</P>
<P>
In addition, with increased longevity, the elderly population
grew at a faster rate than the general population. According to
the statistics, from 1965 to 1995, the number of those aged 60
years and above grew at an average annual rate of 4.2 percent,
more than double the average annual population growth of 1.5 per
cent.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, there were 296,700 elder residents in Singapore,
whereas in 1965 there were only 87,600, the figures showed.

<HEADLINE> Foreign Investment in South Korea Surges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 22 (Xinhua) -- Foreign direct investment in South
Korea jumped a third to 1.27 billion U.S. dollars in the first
half of this year compared with last year, the Finance and Economy
Ministry said here today.
</P>
<P>
The manufacturing sector claimed the lion's share of the rise
with 772 million U.S. dollars, up 65 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
Investment from the European Union rocketed 97 percent to 394
million. But Japanese investment plunged by half to 127 million
dollars. U.S. investment fell 5.4 percent to 348 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the sharp increase in investment to the
improvement in the country's foreign investment environment,
including the opening up of domestic markets and the
simplification of investment procedures.
</P>
<P>
Foreign direct investment in South Korea has gradually
recovered since it slumped from 1.39 billion dollars in 1991 to
890 million dollars in 1992. It bounced back to 1.04 billion
dollars in 1993, 1.31 billion dollars in 1994 and 1.94 billion
dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Total foreign direct investment in South Korea reached a
cumulative 15.67 billion dollars by the end of last month.

<HEADLINE> Thai Government Shelves Plan on Property Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has shelved a
plan to allow a 100 percent foreign ownership of any residential
condominium in the country to boost the local property market.
</P>
<P>
According to the Policy Committee for Economic Stability which
rejected the plan, foreign ownership will remain at the current
maximum of 40 percent as demand for condominiums from foreigners
is low.
</P>
<P>
The government earlier proposed to assist the property sector
by easing the restriction, but the plan met criticism from the
private sector which claimed that demand from foreign nationals
was insufficient to boost the market.
</P>
<P>
The Land Department will submit alternative measures to boost
the dim property sector in the country.

<HEADLINE> IOC Irritated by Transportation Mess in Atlanta </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 22 (Xinhua) -- The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) is getting irritated by the mess in transportation
as well as late delivery of information into the computers,
spokesman of the Atlanta Committee for the Olympic Games (ACOG)
confirmed here today.
</P>
<P>
"We have got complains about the transportation and technology
problems, but it was not a matter of criticism from IOC, we take
them as advice at the daily session of our ACOG and IOC
coordinating committee," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Dick Pound, IOC vice president, said on Sunday the Atlanta
organizers were told "to fix the transport. Nobody ever believes
it will be as difficult as it is. Now they believe it."
</P>
<P>
Walid Al Awazen of Jordan, a medal contender in the judo
tournament, was delayed for hours in transportation to the
competition venue which resulted in his disqualification.
</P>
<P>
Several other cases were also reported in the first two day
competition either due to wrong informantion or delay in
transportation.
</P>
<P>
About 50 shuttle bus drivers have quitted after complaining of
exhaustion and insufficient training as many a driver didn't know
the routes to the competition venues.
</P>
<P>
The mess in transportation has forced the ACOG to "take
flexible measures to get athletes to and through very quickly,"
the spokesman said at the morning press briefing.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ACOG has been discussing issue of partial
closure of streets with the municipal government in order to
improve the transportation situation.
</P>
<P>
"We have 600,000 more people here for the Olympic Games," the
spokesman said, promising "the issue is got to be resolved,
whatever it is."
</P>
<P>
ACOG has a working staff member of 85,000, with volunteers
being the backbone of the system, including some 2,000 from
overseas, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Centennial Olympics is also being plagued by slow delivery
of electronic scores and other information into the IBM computer
terminals at the Main Press Center and other press working rooms.
</P>
<P>
Time and again, reporters cann't retrieve the starting lists
even after the medalists have left their competition venues.
</P>
<P>
IBM spokesman Fred McNeese said the company was working around
the clock to address the problem.

officials to bolster the faltering peace process.
</P>
<P>
U.S. coordinator for the Middle East peace process Dennis Ross
is also due in the region for the same purpose, a visit viewed as
the U.S. continued effort to push the peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
According to reliable sources in Damascus, the French foreign
minister's tour of the region is aimed to boost the role played
by France and the European Union (EU) in establishing peace in the
region.
</P>
<P>
The French foreign minister's talks with Syrian officials will
focus on ways of pushing forward the Middle East peace process,
working out a mechanism for the work of the ceasefire-monitoring
commission in Lebanon.

The French ties with both Syria and Lebanon, consolidation of
the Euro-Mediterranean partnership and preparations for French
President Jacques Chirac's upcoming visit to both Syria and
Lebanon are also expected to be high on the agenda.
</P>
<P>
Sources in the Syrian capital said that Ross will convey to
Syrian President Hafez Assad a message from his U.S. counterpart
Bill Clinton to the effect that the Clinton administration is
committed to the peace process and the Madrid Conference
principles, and that the U.S. will continue to act as a mediator.
</P>
<P>
Ross will also brief the Syrian President on the outcome of the
recent talks held by Clinton and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Natanyahu.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Secretary General of the Arab League (AL) Esmat
Abdul Meguid will arrive in the Syrian capital next Thursday to
consolidate inter-Arab relations and to secure Arab solidarity so

WASHINGTON, July 22 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Marines will conduct large
military exercises on Australia's northern coastline under an
agreement between the United States and Australia, expected to be
signed this week, a U.S. Defense Department official said on
Monday.
</P>
<P>
About 2,500 U.S. Marines from bases on the U.S. West Coast and
Okinawa, Japan, will use the remote training site on the far
northern end of Australia near Darwin to practice amphibious
assaults, the official said.
</P>
<P>
A core group of about 15 to 20 Marines will be permanently
stationed at the facility to help coordinate the maneuvers, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The United States lost major training facilities in the West
Pacific when Clark Air Base in the Philippines was abandoned in
June 1991 and Subic Naval Base closed in 1992.
</P>
<P>
It has training facilities in Japan, which, however, is densely
populated, and small in size for large-scale maneuvers. And its
sites on the South Korea peninsula are unsuitable for drilling as
it might provoke tensions on the peninsula.
</P>
<P>
A team of U.S. diplomats and military officials, including
Secretary of State Warren Christopher, Defense Secretary William
Perry and Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. John Shalikashvili, will
travel to Sydney later this week to meet with Australian officials
and sign an accord to allow the training to begin.

<HEADLINE> SADC Film School to Be Set Up in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Plans are underway to establish a
film school in Zimbabwe to serve the whole Southern African
Development Community (SADC) region.
</P>
<P>
A consultant with the United Nations Educational, Scientific
and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), Jasper Hojberg said on Monday
that the project would be implemented by UNESCO using funds from
the Danish International Development Agency (DANIDA).
</P>
<P>
He said, ''we are in the process of consulting broadly within
both the film industry, the ministry of information, posts and
telecommunications and broadcasting of Zimbabwe.''
</P>
<P>
He said the idea of establishing a film school was aimed at
encouraging the growth of the technical infrastructure for film
development in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
The Southern Africa region, he said, has a number of good
qualified professionals in film production with an ability to
complete a program on imparting teaching skills to others.
</P>
<P>
He said subjects taught in basic and intermediate film training
include sound editing, use of cameras, writing, directing,
producers' skills, financial and production management.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Protests Forcible Return Of Rwandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) today demanded that Burundi
immediately halt the forced return of thousands of Rwandan
refugees in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Burundian President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya,
High Commissioner Sadako Ogata described the forced return as a
flagrant violation of basic human rights and international
refugee instruments, a UNHCR press release made available to
Xinhua said.
</P>
<P>
Ogata expressed her "indignation and serious concern over the
treatment inflicted on refugees and my own staff."
</P>
<P>
As of this afternoon, about 13,000 Rwandan refugees have been
forced out since Friday from camps in northern Burundi, the press
release said.
</P>
<P>
"At least three people including an 18-month-old baby and an
elderly man, have died in the forced repatriation in which the
refugees are tightly jammed into trucks and taken from Burundi to
a transit center in Butare, southern Rwanda," the UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
Ogata's letter said Burundi's move not only "represents a
serious violation of a cardinal principle of human rights, but
also is in breach of Burundi's obligations as a signatory of
international legal instruments in support of refugees."
</P>
<P>
She said she wished to strongly reiterate her demand that the
forced returns be halted and that such activities not be allowed
to occur again.
</P>
<P>
According to the UNHCR, since January 1995 when the voluntary
repatriation program began, the UNHCR has assisted more than
55,000 Rwandan refugees to return home from the neighboring
Burundi.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus President Rejects Turkish Cypriot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus President Glafcos Clerides
said here today that the Greek Cypriot side will not participate
in military talks between the commanders of the Cypriot National
Guard and the Turkish forces in Cyprus if the so-called commander
of the Turkish Cypriot forces takes part in the talks.
</P>
<P>
The president made the remarks one day after U.S. permanent
representative to the U.N. Madeleine Albright told a press
conference in New York that Turkish Cypriot participation in the
military talks is a "subject under discussion" following a
request to that effect by the Turkish Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
President Clerides told reporters that he made his position
clear to U.S. presidential emissary Richard Beattie during a
telephone conversation he had with him Monday night.
</P>
<P>
Clerides said that Beattie had reassured him that the
agreement on a military dialogue does not envisage Turkish
Cypriot participation.
</P>
<P>
The proposed military dialogue, the first between the military
commanders of the Cypriot National Guard and the Turkish forces in
Cyprus, was announced by U.S. envoy Albright during a brief visit
to the island last week.
</P>
<P>
The leaders of the two armies will discuss ways to defuse
tension between the two sides, heightened last month after a
Greek Cypriot soldier was killed by a Turkish Cypriot soldier.
</P>
<P>
The meeting will be held under the auspices of the Commander
of UNFICYP, the U.N. Peace-Keeping Force in Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkish troops invaded and
seized 37 percent of the island following an Athens-backed
coup.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary-General's resident representative in Cyprus
Gustave Feissel said Monday after meeting with President
Clerides that the military talks are expected to start this
month.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, British High Commissioner to Cyprus David Madden
today expressed welcome to the U.S. proposed military talks on
the island.
</P>
<P>
He described it as "an excellent idea" which would help to
reduce tension along the U.N. controlled buffer zone.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Korean National Red Cross (KNRC)
sent the sixth batch of relief goods to the Democratic People's
Republic of Korea (DPRK) today to help ease the effects of
devastating floods in the country last summer.
</P>
<P>
A KNRC official said here a freighter carrying the goods,
consisting of 286 tons of wheat flour, left South Korea's Inchon
Port today for the DPRK, which has been experiencing a severe food
shortage because of the flooding.
</P>
<P>
So far, the KNRC has sent relief goods worth a total of 1.42
million U.S. dollars to the DPRK through international
organizations.
</P>
<P>
The relief shipments have included 10,000 blankets, 10,000
packs of instant noodles, 20,000 paris of socks, 186,000 liters of
cooking oil, 36 tons of powdered milk and 572 tons of wheat flour.
</P>

South Korea decided on June 11 to give three million U.S.
dollars in official food aid to the DPRK.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Protests Burundi's Forced Return of Rwandan Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The UN High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR) on Tuesday demanded that Burundi immediately halt
the forced return of Rwandan refugees, describing it as a flagrant
violation of basic human rights and international legal
instruments.
</P>
<P>
As of Tuesday afternoon, according to the UNHCR, about 13,500
Rwandan refugees had been expelled since Friday from camps in
northern Burundi.
</P>
<P>
At least three people, including an 18-month-old baby and an
elderly man, have died in the forced repatriation in which the
refugees are tightly jammed into trucks and taken from Burundi to
a transit center in Butare, southern Rwanda.
</P>
<P>
At least three children suffered broken limbs and several
people had to be carried off the trucks, the UNHCR said.
</P>
<P>
Until Friday, there were about 85,000 Rwandan refugees, most of
them Hutus, living in four UNHCR-assisted camps in northern
Burundi. UNHCR has been denied access to two of them -- Kibezi and
Ruvumu, which together had a refugee population of about 27,000.
</P>
<P>
Kibezi, where the forced repatriation began Friday, was by
Monday reported empty and looted, allegedly by displaced Burundis
whose actions were ignored by surrounding Burundi army troops.
</P>
<P>
According to UNHCR, about half of the refugee population in
Kibezi camp reportedly fled into the surrounding countryside,
where they are without assistance or protection. Despite vocal
protests from UNHCR and other agencies, a steady stream of
vehicles continued to carry refugees to Butare on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"This...represents a serious violation of a cardinal principle
of human rights, but also is in breach of Burundi's obligations as
a signatory of international legal instruments in support of
refugees," said UNHCR leader Sadako Ogata in a letter Tuesday to
Burundi President Sylvestre Ntibantunganya.
</P>
<P>
Ogata also called on Burundi government to halt the forced
returns and honor its commitments to protect refugees in the
country despite current difficulties.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The strike by over 40,000 workers
of three major national tea companies in western Kenya continued
today despite calls by their leaders to end the strike which
started on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Workers from the Brooke Bond, African Highland Produce and
George Williamson in Kericho and Bomet Districts defied calls by
the Kenya Plantation and Agricultural Workers Union Secretary
General Francis Atwoli to resume work as their problem is
addressed.
</P>
<P>
The strike which started on a low key on Sunday picked on
Monday when the workers burnt a Brooke Bond trailer.
</P>
<P>
The workers want a salary increase agreed between the union
and management in January this year to be implemented before they
resume work.
</P>
<P>
They complained that their employers are reluctant to effect
the salary increase despite the huge profit they made.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The World No. 1 ranking couldn't
secure Tom Dolan a berth in the men's 400-meter freestyle final at
the Centennial Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Dolan, 20, who chalked up the first gold in the pool for the
United States in the men's 400m individual medley on Sunday,
failed to advance to the final of the 400m freestyle Tuesdasy.
</P>
<P>
His time of 3:53.91 gave him a low 11th place.
</P>
<P>
"My muscles didn't really feel like they had recovered (from
the 400 IM) yet, " he explained his failure, "I didn't felt good,
and it's tough when your body is not a hundred percent."
</P>
<P>
However, the chronic asthma was not ruffled at the results. The
versatile swimmer is looking forward to his next event, the 200m
individual medley.
</P>
<P>
"I would love to have another shot and swim it tonight, but I
do have the 200-meter individual medley left, and you can't be
disappointed after winning a gold medal."
</P>
<P>
He also explained that his main event lies in the 400m IM,
"That is my main event and I trained for it, and one day maybe
I'll train in the 400m free and focus on that."
</P>
<P>
The lanky boy won high expectation from the U.S. fans as he
chalked up a total of three golds out of four individual events at
the U.S. Trials, and even more, with the year's best times in all
these three events.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Remains the World's Biggest Oil Consumer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States has remained
the world's biggest oil consumer, according to a report by the New
York Times today.
</P>
<P>
With more people moving out of urban areas, the country sees
its oil consumption growing steadily. Two decades after the oil
crises of the 1970s, the U.S. is more reliant on oil imports than
at any time since 1977 -- and it is hard to find many people who
seem to care, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
According to figures carried by the paper, Americans consumed
17.7 million barrels of oil a day in 1995, with 53.4 percent going
to highway transportation.
</P>
<P>
Daily oil consumption in the first half of this year has risen
above 18 million barrels for the first time since 1979, and
imports have surged to 8.3 million barrels, or 46.3 percent of the
total, a near record, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
The 1995 consumption of oil for each person reached 1,029
gallons, the paper said. For Japan, the figure stood at 700
gallons; Germany, 543 gallons; France, 501 gallons; and Britain,
481 gallons.
</P>
<P>
A brief spike in gasoline prices reminded Americans of the
potential costs of their suburban life style.
</P>
<P>
In 1973, the year of the Arab oil embargo, the United States
imported nearly 35 percent of its oil. It dropped that figure to
28 percent in 1982, the paper said.

<HEADLINE> Russia Shoots Down Third Gold at Atlanta Olympics </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Boris Kokorev netted the third
shooting gold medal for Russia at the Olympic Wolf Creek Shooting
Complex, while ailing Chinese Wang Yifu came back from a near
breakdown to finish sixth here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Kokorev, European champion in 1992 and 1993, snatched back lead
at the eighth shot of the final round to win the men's free pistol
title.
</P>
<P>
His winning total was 666.4 points, a new Olympic final record.
</P>
<P>
Igor Basinski of Belarus, fourth in the qualification round,
jumped to the second spot by totaling 662.0 points after Italian
Roberto Di Donna made two low shots.
</P>
<P>
Di Donna, who landed the men's air pistol gold on the opening
day of the Olympic shooting competition last Saturday, came second
in the qualification at 569 points, one less than leader KoKorev
and three more than Basinski.
</P>
<P>
The Italian overtook Kokorev by 0.6 points after the fifth shot
and he kept the lead until he scored a poor 7.2 points against the
Russian's 8.9 in the eighth shot.
</P>
<P>
Di Donna hit an unimpressive 8.9 points for the ninth shot as
the Russian pulled away with a 3.4 points lead.
</P>
<P>
Wang, air pistol champion and free pistol runner-up in the
Barcelona Games four years ago, showed his ailments were as
serious as last Saturday when he passed out after blowing a
3.8 points lead in the last shot to give the air pistol title to
Di Donna.
</P>
<P>
The 36-year-old Chinese wobbled throughout the qualification
round, getting five 8s among his 60 shots en route to barely
making the final with a seventh-place finish. He had several
times come close to a collapse.
</P>
<P>
Wang, who has been troubled by serious headaches which made his
action very slow, regained a bit of his former self to get 10.5
and 10.2 points for the last two shots, moving up to the sixth
place.

<HEADLINE> UN Commission Approve More Gulf War Compensations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The UN Compensation Commission
(UNCC) approved here on Tuesday 64,000 compensation claims for
individual losses induced by Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in 1990.
The approved compensations amount to over 323 million U.S. dollars
in total.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made Tuesday during a meeting of the Governing
Council of the UNCC, created in 1991 as a subsidiary organ of the
Security Council to decide on the claims submitted by victims of
the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Exactly five years after its creation, the UNCC has so far
received 2.6 million claims with an asserted value over 200
billion dollars. The bulk of this asserted value comes from claims
by corporations and governments.
</P>
<P>
To date, 2.2 million claims from individuals have been
processed by the UNCC, and 3.7 billion dollars of awards have been
approved. However, due to lack of fund, the Commission has only
managed to pay 13.5 million dollars to individual claimants so
far.
</P>
<P>
Following the signing of a memorandum of understanding between
United Nations and Iraq in May this year, the UNCC hoped that it
could soon receive its first regular income through implementation
of Security Council resolution 986, which would enable it to
partially pay the approved awards within the next few months.
</P>
<P>
According to a plan of the UNCC, in the next few months, some
57,000 claimants from 61 countries could each receive an initial
payment of 2,500 dollars, corresponding to a total amount of 142
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
In the following months, an additional 560 million U.S. dollars
could be similarly distributed to another 244,000 claimants from
approximately 70 countries.

</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters after meeting President Nelson Mandela
in Pretoria, Kinkel said: "We have not forgotten Africa and feel
very close to the continent."
</P>
<P>
Kinkel, accompanied by a delegation of German businessmen, is
in South Africa on the second leg of his visit to four southern
African states. His first stop was Botswana, and he will visit
Mozambique and Zimbabwe later in the week.
</P>
<P>
During his talks with Foreign Affairs Minister Alfred Nzo,
Kinkel stressed that southern Africa could continue to bank on
Germany.
</P>
<P>
Both Mandela and Nzo indicated that Kinkel has passed the
assurance that Germany will play a role in helping South Africa
attain a favorable free trade agreement with the European Union
(EU).
</P>
<P>
South Africa wants the EU to review its latest proposal, in
terms of which 38 percent of the country's agricultural produce
will be excluded from free trade with Europe.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Mandela said he has told Kinkel South African
agricultural produce is no threat to the European market because
the imports are on a relatively small scale.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel also said Germany is interested in the Southern African
Development Community (SADC) as an economic entity, and he
welcomed the SADC's recent decision to focus on economic as well
as political issues.
</P>
<P>
Kinkel and Nzo signed an agreement on Germany's funding for
the building of housing in rural areas of South Africa.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu: No Schedule Yet for Summit with Arafat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu today highly appraised the meeting between his Foreign
Minister David Levy and Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat, but said he has not yet scheduled a meeting with Arafat.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the Knesset Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee
this afternoon, Netanyahu described the meeting as extremely
important in setting up the mode of dialogue between the Israeli
government and the self-rule Palestinian Authority, according to
Israel Radio.
</P>
<P>
Arafat and Levy held 90-minute talks at the Erez checkpoint
between Gaza and Israel this afternoon, the first high level talks
between the PA and Israel after Netanyahu took power in June. They
agreed to hold further contacts to push forward the peace process.
</P>
<P>
But Netanyahu said he would consider meeting the Palestinian
leader if Israel's vital interest requires it.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel is ready to advance the peace process, but
added that the Palestinians must live up to all their security
commitments. He also asked for explicit commitments from the PA to
stop all political activity in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Hebron, Netanyahu said that internal
discussions on redeployment will be concluded by the end of the
week. He insisted that a decision on the matter should be based on
two principles: Israel's sensitivity in the area of security and
Israel's intent to honor the agreements signed with the
Palestinians. He said that the matter of Hebron is not simple and
dealing with it improperly could sabotage the entire process.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu said that Israel will negotiate with the
Palestinians in order to reach an agreement on the permanent
settlement. But he cautioned that the current Israeli government
has a different approach. "We are against an independent
Palestinian state. But this should not prevent us from holding
negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Jewish settlement, Netanyahu repeated
his well-known position, saying that the current government
believes in the principle that Jews should be allowed to settle
wherever they want. But he said that no settlement plan has been
completed so far.
</P>
<P>
Turning to relations with Lebanon and Syria, Netanyahu said
the situation in south Lebanon is worsening, describing it a war
of attrition. He said that the matter is the government's top
priorities.
</P>
<P>
He lashed out at Syria, warning Damascus against using
Hezbollah to pressure Israel. "Damascus believes that if they
pressure with threats of wide-spread terror, we will be more
flexible," he said.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu stressed that Syria's approach to the peace process
is mistaken. He said that the Madrid conference was the only
framework and Israel would stick to it.

Kisutu Resident Magistrate's Court in Dar es Salaam.
</P>

Earlier, Chief Justice Francis Nyalali said that there is a
need to review the law so that all children from 18 years of age and
below should have a single organ dealing with their affairs like the
juvenile court.
</P>
<P>
"Tanzania can not claim that it is a true democratic or it

equally, if it does not recognize the rights of the children,"
Nyalali added.

<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa appealed to
foreign companies operating in the country not to appoint aliens
to positions which could be filled by local workers unless it is
absolutely necessary, Home Affairs Minister Mangosuthu Buthelezi
said today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Pretoria, Buthelezi said this will
demonstrate their support for the reconstruction and development
program of South Africa.
</P>
<P>
In this regard, foreign companies should also provide training
for local workers, said the minister.
</P>
<P>
"The policy of the Department of Home Affairs is to encourage
foreign investment because of its beneficial impact on both
economic growth and the creation of employment opportunities for
the local work force," said the statement.
</P>
<P>
However, Buthelezi said the department can not, in the light
of grave unemployment situation in the country, grant work
permits to aliens who do not possess special skills or
qualifications not readily available in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
He also said the existing regulations and amended legislation
are not aimed at clamping down the admission of key and other
strategic personnel, necessary for the economic growth of
businesses, but to bring South Africa into line with regulation
in other countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- U.N. spokeswoman Sylvana
Foa here today refuted U.S. attacks against U.N. staff as
"ridiculous charges and disgraceful campaign of disinformation."
</P>
<P>
When asked about her reactions to the New York Times' report
that U.S. was concerned about the U.N. resources being used for
re-election of the Secretary General, she said that
Secretary-General Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the U.N. staff have
been extremely preoccupied by the multitude crises of the
deteriorating situation in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
"We have no time to answer such unsubstantiate allegations,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times reported today that the Clinton
Administration threatened to take action against the United
Nations and any employees found to be campaigning for the
re-election of Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali at the
organization's expense.
</P>
<P>
"It is our intention to look into how U.N. personnel are being
used by the Secretary General for this purpose," said James P.
Rubin, spokesman of the United States Mission to U.N. He added
that Washington would call for investigation if necessary, the New
York Times reported.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokeswoman said, "these allegations are being made
against the staff who are working under extremely stressful
circumstances to make this organization work."
</P>
<P>
"These kinds of ridiculous charges and disgraceful campaign of
disinformation have been waged against the United Nations and
against the staff of United Nations," she said.
</P>
<P>
"I cannot believe that this kind of attacks have been approved
in advance by the government concerned," Foa said.
</P>
<P>
This kind of attacks, its bully tactics, its threats and
blatant attempts of intimidating the U.N. staff "really smack of
the McCarthy Era... as I remember when I was a kid in the 1950s,"
she added.
</P>
<P>
She said that Boutros-Ghali made it clear to U.N. staff that
they should get on with their work and let the re-election to be
up to the member states.
</P>
<P>
"However, I remind the Secretary General that it's a job for
every single U.N. staffer to counter the disinformation no matter
what source of the disinformation is, and to defend the
institution of the United Nations from unwanted, unjustified and
unsubstantiate attacks," she said.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Against Liberian Faction Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The secretariat of the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) has recommended severe
sanctions against Liberia's faction leaders.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ECOWAS Executive Secretary Eduard Benjamin also
recommended the setting up of an international criminal tribunal
to try the perpetrators of the crisis in that country, the News
Agency of Nigeria reported today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ECOWAS Council of Ministers at their 29th
ordinary meeting in Abuja, capital of Nigeria on Monday, the
official said that time has come for the Liberian crisis to come
under proper focus and those perpetrating it adequately punished.
</P>
<P>
This view of Benjamin, according to observers here, just
echoed that of Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The president said at the weekend that all the faction leaders
in the Liberian crisis might be prosecuted as war criminals
unless they change their attitude. If not, the ECOWAS summit
billed to take place this week in Abuja may be compelled to seek
international assistance to arraign the warlords before an
international tribunal on war crimes.
</P>
<P>
To many ECOWAS leaders, observers said, there were much hope
to end the civil war in Liberia after the factional leaders
signed a peace accord in Abuja last August. But contrary to the
expectation, the warlords shattered the hope when they entered
into renewed fighting in early April this year.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Secretary-General
Boutros Boutros-Ghali today urged the Security Council to press
ahead with the ongoing contingency planning for a multi-national
force in case that the situation in Burundi becomes deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to the Security Council, Boutros-Ghali said that
following the massacre of 300 civilians between July 12 and 14,
rumors of an impending coup d'etat has been widespread, while
demonstrations in Bujumbura have become increasingly militant.
</P>
<P>
The Burundi authorities claim that the dead were Tutsis killed
by Hutu rebels of the armed wing of the National Council for the
Defense of Democracy (CNDD), while the CNDD has denied any role in
the massacre, claiming that the victims were actually Hutus killed
by soldiers of the Burundian army, Boutros-Ghali said in the
letter.
</P>
<P>
"Both these conflicting groups have rejected the idea of an
international peace-keeping force in Burundi and have vowed to
fight it with all means at their disposal," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, the International Technical Committee, which was
established by the Arusha Summit on 25 June 1996 and charged
with working out the logistics of the regional peace plan, has
been refused permission to visit Burundi," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The letter also noted the ongoing security operations to
close down the Kibezi and Ruvumu camps for Rwandan refugees.
</P>
<P>
"Reports have been received indicating that more than 3,000
refugees have been expelled to Rwanda, 4,000 are said to have
fled into the hills; and more than 12,000 are under guard at a
local football stadium awaiting expulsion," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
Boutros-Ghali concluded in his letter that there is pressing
need for the international community to take concrete and
immediate action to halt the cycle of violence and to prevent
another catastrophe in the Great Lakes region of Central Africa.
</P>
<P>
"It is for this reason that we need to press forward with the
ongoing contingency planning for a multi-national force," he said.

TUNIS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the Arab
Interior Ministers' Council (AIMC) Ahamed Ben-Mohammed Al-Salem
announced here today the start of the implementation of Arab
anti-drug treaty.
</P>
<P>
The treaty, sanctioned by the council in 1994. aims at
eliminating supply and demand of the illegal drugs and
mind-influencing materials. It also calls for eradicating the
drug-producing plantations.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the tenth conference of chiefs of Arab anti-narcotic
departments which opened here Monday, Al-Salem said the
implementation of the treaty marks a significant progress achieved
by the AIMC in combating this grave phenomenon.
</P>
<P>
"This phenomenon does not recognize any geographical borders
and the revenues of the illicit trading in drugs amount to some
500 billion U.S. dollars," he noted.
</P>
<P>
The figure surpasses the revenues of world's oil trade, he
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said that drug dealers often are involved in serious crimes
such as terrorism and arson, thus destabilizing the security of
states and peoples all over the world, Al-Salem pointed out.
</P>
<P>
He said the AIMC has approved the Arab Ideal Narcotic Law which
provides for regulating the medical supervision and controlling
the importation and circulation of drugs and mind-influencing
materials.
</P>
<P>
The law also urges some Arab countries to adopt tough penalties
including the capital punishment against drug dealers and
smugglers.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary Fund
(IMF) is for the first time putting off a 330 million U.S. dollar
loan payment to Russia, the institution's officials confirmed here
today.
</P>
<P>
When the IMF Board of Directors approved a 10.2 billion dollar
three-year loan for Russia in February this year, strict
conditions were set for the monthly disbursement. The monthly
loan hold-up is due to tax collections there are running behind.
</P>
<P>
The loan is subject to monthly reviews of Russia's economic
situation. The withheld payment for Russia will be further
discussed during the IMF's mid-August review of Russia's economic
performance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Russian officials had said they would ask for an

<HEADLINE> S.African Growth Strategy in Line With RDP: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The goals of the South
African government's recently released macro-economic policy
framework are directly interrelated with the objectives of the
reconstruction and development program (RDP), Finance Minister
Trevor Manuel said today.
</P>
<P>
Addressing delegates at a United Nations development program
seminar in Johannesburg, Manuel said the government is committed
to the redistribution of wealth and has not abandoned the RDP.
</P>
<P>
The macro-economic strategy, launched by Manuel on June 14, is
the government's final say on where economic policy is heading.
</P>
<P>
The strategy commits the economy to the privatization of
certain state assets, trade liberalization, the abolishment of
exchange controls, wage and salary restraint and fiscal
discipline.
</P>
<P>
There are direct interrelationships between what the
government is doing for the economy and the RDP, said the
minister, adding the strategy is a commitment to improve the
quality of life in South Africa, and in particular the life of
the poor.
</P>
<P>
However, in response to criticism by Sam Shilowa,
Secretary-general of the Congress of South African Trade Unions,
Manuel said the strategy underlines the objectives of the RDP.
</P>
<P>
Shilowa recently criticized the government's macro-economic
strategy as "neo-liberalist" and a blueprint for profit at the
expense of development.

<HEADLINE> Fire Damages Black Church in Western Kentucky Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Fire Tuesday destroyed a church
formerly used by a predominantly black congregation in the western
Kentucky town of Providence, and authorities were investigating
the possibility of arson.
</P>
<P>
A preliminary investigation revealed evidence of forced entry
through the rear door of the Providence Church of God in Christ,
state police said. The fire, reported around 2 a.m., was
controlled in a half hour but the building was declared a total
loss, The Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
Police said the congregation of about 100 already was moving
into a new building, and gas, electricity and water had been
turned off at the old church on Monday. The building and its
furnishings were to be sold to a funeral home
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere, arson was suspected in a fire early today in Arizona
that damaged two trailers used for classrooms at the Tucson Full
Gospel church, which serves mainly that city's Korean community.
The church had received no threats or indications of racial
problems, said Pastor John Lee.
</P>
<P>
There have been more than 70 suspicious fires at church
properties belonging to predominantly black congregations in
Southern states since 1995. An equal number of fires have been
reported at white churches in the region, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
There is evidence of racism in at least 18 of the fires. Racial
motivation has been ruled out in more than two dozen other
cases, according to the report.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Approves Bill Supporting NATO Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Republican-controlled U.S.
House of Representatives today approved a bill to authorize 60
million U.S. dollars in military assistance to Poland, Hungary and
Czech Republic to speed their admission to the North Atlantic
Treaty Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
The bill, introduced by Rep. Benjamin Gilman, chairman of the
House Foreign Relations Committee, was passed 353-65. The vote
sent out a clear signal that U.S. lawmakers sought quickly
expansion of the western military alliance despite strong
objections from Russia.
</P>
<P>
The act recognizes the three former Warsaw Pact member states
as "achieving the most progress" toward meeting the criteria for
NATO membership, and makes them eligible for increased aid to ease
transition into the alliance.
</P>
<P>
The bill also expressed backing to the eventual membership of
other Central and East European nations including Estonia,
Lithuania, Slovenia, Bulgaria, Romania, Albania, Moldova and
Ukraine.
</P>
<P>
But the measure, which now goes to the U.S. Senate for
approval, sets no timetable for the entry of the former Warsaw
Pact nation.
</P>
<P>
A meeting of NATO leaders is scheduled for December to consider
the progress of potential new members to join NATO. Senior
American officials have indicated that the alliance will decide as
early as in early 1997 which nations it will take first.

LAGOS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The international community in
Liberia today said that a total of 489 vehicles valued at 8.2
million US Dollars were stolen during factional fighting in
Monrovia, capital of Liberia, in April and May this year.
</P>
<P>
According to a press release issued by the United Nations
Humanitarian Assistance Office in Monrovia, which reached here
today, 322 vehicles worth 4.9 million Dollars were stolen from
the UN and its agencies, while 167 vehicles valued at 3.2 million
Dollars were stolen from the international non-governmental
organizations (NGOs).
</P>
<P>
"It is no secret that the majority of those vehicles are now
in the hands of factional leaders and fighters, who, despite
concrete evidence and repeated appeals by the international
community, refused to return them so that we can assist Liberians
in need. These vehicles are being used to further fuel factional
aspirations and the war effort," the release said.
</P>
<P>
Only nine of the vehicles have been returned or recovered so
far, according to the release.
</P>
<P>
It said that many basic humanitarian assistance items were
also looted, such as essential food and medicines, blankets,
well-drilling equipment, chlorine to provide safe drinking water,
plastic sheetings for shelter and seeds and tools for
agricultural development of "significant costs".

LAGOS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's Minister of Information

losing its cultural heritage at a very alarming rate.
</P>
<P>
If the trend is not arrested soon, "we may have no cultural
artifacts to bequeath to our progeny," the minister said while
inaugurating an inter-ministerial committee on the looting of the
country's cultural artifacts.

intimidation and murder to perpetrate their iniquitous act,
according to a television report today.
</P>

Nigeria has continued to witness the systematic haemorrhage of
its material culture since the colonial era, and some of the lost
treasures now adorn museums and art galleries in Europe and
America, the minister noted.
</P>
<P>
He acknowledged the efforts so far made by the National
Commission for Museums and Monuments toward stemming the trend in
terms of infrastructural facilities and legal instruments, but

David Willetts took the title left vacant by David

"I am convinced that joining a single European currency would
be disastrous, both politically and economically," he added.
</P>
<P>
Major called Heathcoat-Amory's decision to resign a mistake
and dismissed his call for the government to rule out
participation in a single currency.
</P>
<P>
"It would be wrong to have Britain's voice silenced on a matter
affecting Britain's interests," Major said.

<HEADLINE> Fighting Erupts in Burundi, President Hides in U.S. Embassy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Burundi's President Sylvestre
Ntibantunganya has taken refuge in the U.S. embassy in the capital
Bujumbura as fighting erupted between government troops and Hutu
guerrillas in Bururi, southern Burundi, press reports here said.
</P>
<P>
Ntibantunganya and his second wife have been hiding in the
embassy since Tuesday evening, Agence France Press (AFP) quoted
unidentified sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
There have been rumors of a coup d'etat in Bujumbura and there
are signs at least that the army, dominated by the Tutsi minority,
is pressing the president to resign, said AFP.
</P>
<P>
Ntibantunganya, a 40-year-old Hutu in power since September
1994, was attacked with stones by Tutsis during a funeral on
Tuesday for the 330 Tutsis massacred last Saturday by armed
bandits presumed to be Hutu guerrillas.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Burundian army announced that Hutu rebels
ambushed vehicles of government troops this morning in Bururi
where many of the officers of the Tutsi-dominated government
forces come from, according to AFP.
</P>
<P>
"There is also fighting in Buyengero...and there are rumors of
attacks by rebels (in the capital)," the news agency quoted
Lieutenant-Colonel Longin Minani as saying.
</P>
<P>
Troops have been deployed in Bujumbura and security reinforced
at radio-television stations there, it added.
</P>
<P>
More than 150,000 people have died in fighting in Burundi since
the 1993 assassination of the country's first freely-elected Hutu
president. Ethnic killings in the fighting between Hutu rebels and
the Tutsi army are claiming some 1,000 lives a month.
</P>
<P>
Burundi borders on Rwanda, where up to 1 million Tutsis and
Hutu moderates were massacred by Hutus in the 1994 genocide.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Cuban judoka Esterla Rodriguez,
silver medalist at the women's over 72-kg class, was reprimanded
by the International Olympic Committee for use of Furocemide,
IOC spokeswoman said on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
"It's not a doping case but she has been reprimanded by the
IOC," said Michele Verdier, IOC director for the media and special
projects.
</P>
<P>
Thus, the Cuban athlete will not be stripped of her silver
medal, the first medal Cuba won on Saturday at the Centennial
Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
Furocemide is a diruretic used for slimming although it can
also be taken to hide the presence of steroids and other drugs.
</P>
<P>
So far, no positive drug case was reported at the Olympic
Games, Verdier said.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Flood relief work is gearing up
in Nepal today as Prime Minister Sher Bahadur Deuba called on the
nation to help those affected by the recent floods and landslides
in different parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
While the death toll mounted to over 130 today, the prime
minister in a statement called for financial assistance to the
flood-affected people.
</P>
<P>
As the government alone could not cope with such a widespread
natural calamity, governmental and non-governmental organizations,
 industrialists, businessmen, and all others in Nepal should give
relief to those affected, he said.
</P>
<P>
A massive flood occurred Monday night and killed about 70
people in northern Nepal's Sindhupalchowk district after a
landslide in the eastern district of Bhojpur claimed more than 30
lives last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of people throughout the country have been rendered
homeless by the floods and landslides during the last two weeks.

<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Mongolia's new Prime Minister
Mendsaihani Enkhsaikhan said today that the country's

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Zou Jiahua
said that market demand should be a top consideration for the
development of the economy.
</P>
<P>
During a tour to the port city of Tianjin in north China from
July 21-24, Zou said enterprises should make great efforts to
research and adjust to market demands.
</P>
<P>
Adjustment in industrial structure and the restructuring of
organizations within an enterprise should be done with the market
in mind, he said.
</P>
<P>
An enterprise should not lose sight of the market when
developing products and upgrading technology, he added.
</P>
<P>
Enterprises should provide a complete account of the market
demand when they plan to launch a project, he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-premier called for proper handling of the relationship
between the scale and efficiency of an enterprise, noting that it
is pointless to blindly seek large-scale businesses.

<HEADLINE> Two Drug Smugglers Killed, Seven Arrested in Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Two drug Smugglers were killed and
seven others arrested along with 1,056 kilograms of narcotics
seized in Iran's northeastern province of Khorasan, an official
report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The official news agency IRNA reported that the drugs were
seized in a coordinated operation code-named "Fajr-3," launched on
the occasion of the Law Enforcement Week in the cities of
Torbat-e Jam, Taibad and Khowaf.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, a number of firearms, including five
semi-automatic machine guns, three hand grenades, two RPG-7
rockets, and 775 rounds of ammunition were seized by the law
enforcement forces during the operation in the past two days.
</P>
<P>
Iran confiscated 170 tons of narcotics in the last Iranian
calendar year ending on March 19.
</P>
<P>
Drug issue is regarded as one of the main social problems of
the country since its geographical location is considered one of
the best transit for drug to Europe and is close to the "Golden
Crescent" in the border area between Afghanistan and Pakistan, one
of the biggest drug-producing center in the world.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989, which empowered
the Iranian authorities to execute the smugglers who are caught
with the possession of more than 30 grams of heroin or five
kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, Iran has executed more than
4,000 drug traffickers since 1988 and there are over 12,500
foreign drug smugglers in the Iranian jails.
</P>
<P>
Iran is also planning to build a special prison for narcotics
criminals and offenders in a bid to keep them away from the
society.

</P>
<P>
Jayakumar called on the 120-odd ministers who will be attending
the WTO Ministerial Conference in Singapore in December to provide
political leadership for the multilateral trading system.
</P>
<P>
He also identified three guiding principles which he said can
help determine the agenda and discussions in Singapore. One of the
principles is consolidations: to take stock of the state of
progress made since the signing of the Uruguay Round Agreement in
Marrakesh.
</P>
<P>
Another principle is sustaining the momentum of trade
liberalization. In line with this, Jayakumar said the ministers at
the WTO Ministerial Conference can provide the broad framework for
the future work program of the WTO.
</P>
<P>
This includes starting preparatory work on the built-in agenda
to adequately meet these deadlines.
</P>
<P>
The Singapore foreign minister also identified balance as a
third guiding principle, noting that both developed and developing
countries have their own priorities.
</P>
<P>
Pointing out that the WTO is a consensus-based organization, he
said that a balance will have to be achieved among the diverse
membership of the organization.

<HEADLINE> South Korea Passes Bill on Exclusive Economic Zone off Coast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean National Assembly
today adopted a bill on the country's 200-nautical-mile exclusive
economic zone (EEZ) ahead of mid-August talks with Japan over
fixing EEZ boundaries.
</P>
<P>
The issue is a major sticking point in relations between the
two countries. Both South Korea and Japan said they would declare
their own EEZ around their coasts in February after a row over two
islets midway between them in the Sea of Japan.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Convention on the Law of the Sea obliges signatories
to respect a 200-mile (370 kilometers) exclusive economic zone off
a nation's coasts, including those of outlying islands.
</P>
<P>
Japan's parliament approved a bill on a 200-nautical-mile
exclusive economic zone off its coasts on July 2.
</P>
<P>
But as the sea between South Korea and Japan is less than 400
nautical miles wide, the zones overlap, making it necessary for
the two sides to negotiate boundaries.

HARARE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Ministry of Health and
Child Welfare said today it will strive to ensure no Zimbabwean
dies from malaria which has claimed more than 2,000 lives
countrywide this year.
</P>
<P>
Minister Timothy Stamps said the recently ended malaria
epidemic has exposed the weakness of the country's public health
system.
</P>
<P>
He said, "malaria is a disease from which no one should die
because we have the treatment and it is inexpensive, but we did
not have transport to help distribute drugs which would have
helped reduce the death toll by half."
</P>
<P>
"Health in this country is given priority but this priority
should be backed up by practical resources, especially money and
staff," he said.
</P>
<P>
He called on the government to doctor its weakness in budget
management and draw up schedules of how money is being spent
rather than find out later how the money has been spent.

<HEADLINE> Iran to Build Special Prison for Drugs Offenders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Iran is to build a special prison
for narcotics offenders and has decided to exert more efforts to
fight drugs, a press report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian-language daily Jumhuri Islami reported that Iranian
 Interior Minister Ali Mohammad Besharati said Iran will build a
special prison for narcotics offenders in a bid to keep them away
from the society.
</P>
<P>
While meeting with officials in charge of the anti-narcotics
campaign in the country, Besharati said that the special
rehabilitation centers for drug addicts must also be well equipped
and improved.
</P>
<P>
The interior minister also called on mass media to be actively
involved in the anti-narcotics program and bring about awareness
regarding the destructive consequence of addiction to drugs upon
individuals and communities.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Iranian anti-drugs forces captured 19.26 tons
of various kinds of drugs in July alone.
</P>
<P>
Iran confiscated 170 tons of narcotics during the last Iranian
calendar year ending on March 19.
</P>
<P>
The drug issue is regarded as one of the main social problems
in Iran since its geographical location is considered one of the
best transit spots for drugs to Europe and is close to the "Golden
Crescent" on the border area between Afghanistan and Pakistan, one
of the biggest drug-producing centers in the world.
</P>
<P>
Iran passed a strict anti-drug law in 1989, which empowered
the Iranian authorities to execute the smugglers who are caught
with the possession of more than 30 grams of heroin or five
kilograms of opium.
</P>
<P>
According to an earlier report, Iran has executed more than
4,000 drug traffickers since 1988 and there are more than 12,500
foreign drug smugglers in the Iranian jails.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Inflation Falls Further </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's year-on-year inflation
last month fell to its lowest level in a year to just over 22
percent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics obtained today showed that inflation, which once
reached a three-year peak of 28 percent in January, was in June
measured at 22.5 percent compared with 24.7 percent in the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
The fall in inflation, which has resulted in a two percent
reduction in minimum bank lending rates, was mainly attributed to
a decline in food prices due to the recent agricultural harvest.
</P>
<P>
However, Dataworld Company of Zimbabwe said in a commentary
while the fall in inflation is welcome, there are still many
inflationary pressures inherent in the agro-based economy, chief
among them the recent price hikes.
</P>
<P>
It said inflation could be expected to remain in the low
twenties for the remainder of the year, although it was unlikely
to fall further below 20 percent.

feel frustrated and desperate -- there are unignorable signs
that the world has got tired of wars and disputes, and that it is
proceeding, somehow or other, to peace," President Mubarak said.
</P>

"The peace desired is not something to be accomplished
automatically, but it needs a peace will, goodwill and joint
efforts for reaching mutual understanding, mutual respect and
mutual cooperation between nations.. which can be attained only
through dialogue, " he added.

<P>
The Egyptian President pointed out that the congress is a
historic opportunity for an exchange of views on the future of

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market lost
ground due to higher-than-expected inflation figures and a
national coal mine strike today.
</P>
<P>
The All Ordinaries index closed 22.1 points lower at 2,113.9
points.
</P>
<P>
The local bourse went down as the Australian Bureau of
Statistics (ABS) announced this morning that consumer price index
rose by 0.7 percent in the June quarter and that the underlying
inflation rate was 3.1 percent in the year to June.
</P>
<P>
The ABS figures were slightly higher than market expectations.
Local economists predicted an underlying inflation rate of 2.9
percent for the 12 months to June.
</P>
<P>
The figures meant that a widely speculated official interest
rates cut would be delayed until the Reserve Bank of Australia's
inflation target of 2-3 percent per annum was achieved.
</P>
<P>
The All Resources index dropped by 23.2 points to 1,296.2
points due to a nationwide strike at coal mines.

Among local mining giants, CRA lost 35 cents to 17.45
Australian dollars, BHP shed 38 cents to 16.20 Australian dollars.
</P>

<TEXT>

BUDAPEST, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Hungary's exports to the European
Union in the first half of this year rose 4.7 percent over the
same period last year, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The country exported one-fifth more to the EU in 1995 over the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
But imports from EU have fallen in recent years, which has
helped narrow the country's trade deficit and reduce national debt.
</P>
<P>
Hungary has been trying to shift the focus of its exports since
the breakup of the Soviet Union. More than two thirds of its
exports used to go to the former Soviet Union and other eastern
European countries before 1990.
</P>
<P>
But with the transformation to a market economy, the EU has
replaced these old markets and now accounts for nearly two thirds
of the country's exports.

<HEADLINE> There's Gold and Coal in China's Hills! </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- There's gold in them there hills,
the old saying goes. But in China there is also coal, rare earth
and a host of other valuable minerals.
</P>
<P>
The prospecting of the gold, coal and other minerals have all
helped China to develop a rich mining industry since the country
introduced reform and opening policies, according to the Ministry
of Geology and Mineral Resources (MGMR).
</P>
<P>
Over the past 18 years, China has discovered gold deposits in
several provinces, each with reserves topping dozens of tons, said
Zeng Yuan, an official with the ministry. Gold deposits with
reserves of several tons were found in all parts of the country.
</P>
<P>
Prospecting of gold no longer lags behind its mining, she added.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China has prospected over 5,000 areas for
coal, and has verified nearly one trillion tons of coal, known as
black "gold".
</P>
<P>
China's annual crude coal output has surpassed one billion
tons, ranking first in the world.
</P>
<P>
Jinchuan City in northwest China's Gansu Province, Tongling
City in east China's Anhui Province, have become non-ferrous
metals industry cities.
</P>
<P>
China has also set up a non-ferrous metals industry following
the discovery of 3,632 non-ferrous metal deposits.
</P>
<P>
The verified reserves of titanium, tungsten, antimony, tin,
bismuth, rare earth, molybdenum, mercury and tellurium, rank first
in the world.
</P>
<P>
China boasts the world's largest bismuth deposits, and has the
world's only independent deposit of another rare mineral,
tellurium.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, China has verified nearly 200 rare earth deposits,
with reserves accounting for four fifths of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
The official went on to say that verified reserves of a dozen
nonmetal minerals in China are in the top three places in the
world.
</P>
<P>
Of these, graphite, fluorite, talc, wollastonite, bentonite,
mirabilite and magnesite rank first or second in the world.
</P>
<P>
So far, China has altogether discovered 168 kinds of minerals,
151 of which have measurable deposits.
</P>
<P>
China has discovered over 200,000 deposits of mineral ores,
with 20,000 of which carefully worked on, he said.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Polluted Air Chokes Manila Residents </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-seven-year-old Emerson
Asuncion says he had never expected, in his first bike tour of
Manila at the age of nine, he would have to wear a mask, but it is
now an essential part of his cycling gear as breathing has become
difficult in the streets of Metro Manila.
</P>
<P>
Masked cyclists are a common sight in the Philippine capital,
where emissions from the heavy traffic form an omnipresent smog
threatening the people's health.
</P>
<P>
"Whenever I ride through downtown Manila, I have to wear a
mask, which is funny, but inhaling the dirty air gives me a
headache," said Asuncion, an elevator operator in the city.
</P>
<P>
Recent findings by the Department of Environment and Natural
Resources (DENR) indicate that the quality of air in Metro Manila
has deteriorated in the last few years.
</P>
<P>
Its report said the ambient lead content in Manila was measured
at more than tripling the guideline of the World Health
Organization (WHO), while the presence of total suspended
particulate (TSP) exceeds WHO's safety standard by five times.
</P>
<P>
The DENR attributed the worsening air pollution mainly to the
rise in the number of motor vehicles, which stands at about one
million daily on the roads of Metro Manila, with some 40 percent
being smoke-belchers.
</P>
<P>
A study by the Asian Development Bank (ADB) showed that about
one third of the TSP in the capital city was caused by emissions
from diesel vehicles, mostly jeepneys -- special passenger jeeps
refit from military jeeps.
</P>
<P>
It also listed light industry and open burning as other major
causes for the urban air pollution.
</P>
<P>
The DENR's Environmental Management Bureau reported that Metro
Manila is contaminated with great and fast growing volumes of
pollutants such as lead, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, and
carbon monoxide.
</P>
<P>
The pollutants "increase health risks to commuters and
passersby, especially to vulnerable populations such as children
and drivers," said Dr. Ronald Subida of the Department of
Environmental and Occupational Health of the University of the
Philippines.
</P>
<P>
According to his study on the impact of vehicular emissions on
vulnerable populations in Metro Manila, exposure to the TSP among
all the surveyed population groups exceeded the national standard.
</P>
<P>
The TSP exposure level for children was almost 40 percent
higher than the standard, and for jeepney drivers, it was more
than double the standard, said Dr. Subida.
</P>
<P>
The most common diseases associated with exposure to air
pollution include chronic bronchitis and emphysema.
</P>
<P>
According to Dr. Subida, inhaling the TSP can also cause cancer
and pulmonary diseases. He said that lead, the most menacing
pollutant found in Metro Manila's air, can impair brain function
leading to irreparable brain damage.
</P>
<P>
"Constant exposure to lead is very dangerous for children as it
may cause lower intelligence quotient and weaken ability to
concentrate," he said.
</P>
<P>
In a bid to reduce the air pollution in Metro Manila, the
Philippine government has prepared a master plan for air quality
management in collaboration with the ADB and WHO.
</P>
<P>
The government also plans to improve the quality of diesel fuel
to check emissions of suspended particulate and sulfur-dioxide.
</P>
<P>
"There is a long way to go and much work to be done before
Manila residents can have clean air to breathe," said Dr. Subida.

<HEADLINE> Rare Mural Painting in Xi'an Recovered </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XI'AN July 24 (Xinhua) -- An ancient mural worth 200,000 yuan
that was lost for nearly two years, has been found in Xi'an, the
capital of northwest China's Shaanxi Province.
</P>
<P>
A tomb located in Liquan County, Shaanxi of an imperial
concubine of Li Shimin of the Tang dynasty (618-907), one of the
greatest emperors in Chinese history was unearthed in the late
1990. A group of frescoes in the tomb were moved to a museum
nearby for display, but 15 of them were stolen in October 1994.
</P>
<P>
The local public security department recently cracked a case
involving piracy of cultural relics, and found the lost mural.
</P>
<P>
Experts and archeologists examined the recovered artwork
several times, and ultimately concluded that it was
authentic.

<HEADLINE> Iranian Carpet Dealers Protest High Taxes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Iranian carpet dealers went on
strike by closing their shops in downtown bazaar in protest
against government's increased taxes, a report said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Persian daily "Salam" reported that the bazaar rug dealers
in Tehran and other parts of the country gathered at the Azaris'
Mosque on Tuesday and complained to a representative of the
Ministry of Economic and Financial Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The rug dealers strongly protested changes in rules and
regulations, which, as they said, had lead to present recession
and inertia in the Persian rug market, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
They called on President Hashemi Rafsanjani to support the 10
million strong industry, the largest non-oil foreign exchange
earner in Iran.
</P>
<P>
As the largest carpet exporter in the world, Iran exports about
1.5 billion U.S. dollars worth of carpets annually.
</P>
<P>
The Persian rug market has been in a deep recession both
domestically and internationally. The carpet export tumbled about
50 percent because of the changing government policy and
inadequate researches.
</P>
<P>
The strikers called on the government to make correct and
reasonable criteria for levying taxes, which they described as
chaotic and arbitrary.
</P>
<P>
One rug dealers said that his tax has jumped by 10 times from 3
million rials to 33 million rials (about 750-8,250 U.S. dollars)
in less than one year.
</P>
<P>
Another dealer complained that he had received a high tax bill
both this year and the last despite the fact that his shop burnt
down and no deal was made.

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Strengthens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended
firmer against the US dollar today, ending at 78.93 US cents from
78.78 US cents.
</P>
<P>
But local traders said that there was still lack of direction
for the movement of the local currency.
</P>
<P>
The inflation figures released today failed to provoke strong
reaction from the Australian dollar. Now investors were looking at
wage growth figures to be released on Thursday for direction.
</P>
<P>
Local economists expected average wage growth to be put under
control in the June quarter, but they said that an interest rate
cut would be delayed due to the higher-than-expected inflation
rate.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar strengthened against most other major
currencies. It ended at 85.02 yen against the Japanese yen from
84.47 yen on Tuesday. It was also firmer against the German mark,
ending at 1.1734 marks from 1.1673 marks Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Bank of Italy Lowers Discount Rate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Italy has lowered its
discount rate by 0.75 percentage points to 8.2 percent from today,
the first cut since May 1994, local press reported.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate on fixed deposits withdrawn before the due
date will also be lowered by 0.75 percentage points to 9.75
percent.
</P>
<P>
The central bank attributed the cut to falling inflation which
is expected to drop to below 4 percent this year.
</P>
<P>
Another reason for the adjustment is the lira's recent strength
against other currencies, with domestic demand relatively weak and
modest growth in industrial production.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Baking hot Beijingers are
escaping the scorching heat by heading to a newly developed
holiday resort.
</P>
<P>
They are beating a retreat to a resort in Fengning, only 170
kilometers away from the capital.
</P>
<P>
Located in the Fengning Autonomous County of the Man Ethnic
Group, the resort features natural beauty highlighted in vast
grassland and thick forests, ancient mountain caves, and hot
springs.
</P>
<P>
But its biggest attraction is the summer temperature - just 17
degrees centigrade, compared to the mid-30s and rising in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
Visitors to the resort can go hunting, shooting, horse and camel
riding, fishing, cross-country car riding and even take to
sightseeing by air in a small plane.
</P>
<P>
A number of tourist facilities have already been opened to
public, catering for over 100,000 tourists a year.
</P>
<P>
The resort has been designated by the National Tourism
Administration as a tourist spot for Beijing.

<P>
CHANGCHUN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- An international seminar on
raising deer and developing products from them is being held in
Changchun, capital city of northwest China's Jilin Province.
</P>
<P>
More than 100 Chinese scholars and some 40 scholars from 12
countries will exchange ideas about breeding deer, disease
prevention for deer, and the development of deer products.
</P>
<P>
Many similar seminars on deer science have been held in China
over the past several years, but this is one of the biggest.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese have been raising deer for more than 3,000 years,
and hundreds of kinds of deer products have been developed.
</P>
<P>
Jilin Province is one of the major sites for artificial
breeding of deer. The province now raises over a half of the
country's domestic deer.

<HEADLINE> UNOMIL Looking For Looted Vehicles In Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations Observers
Mission in Liberia (UNOMIL) said today that it is looking for
over 322 vehicles looted by factional fighters during street
fighting in April and May this year.
</P>
<P>
Local press in neighboring Sierra Leone today quoted UNOMIL
spokesman Ken Page as saying that the value of the hijacked
vehicles was about 5 million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, international aid organizations also reported 167
vehicles "hijacked and not traced", costing over 8 million U.S.
Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Only nine vehicles have been returned despite numerous appeals
to the warring factional leaders.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen the vehicles plying Monrovia roads and the
hinterland but there are armed men on board," said some diplomats
who came from Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
"The armed men on board the vehicles don't take anyone
seriously when they are told the vehicles are not theirs," said
the diplomats.
</P>
<P>
Most of the missing vehicles are four-wheel drives, which are
now fashionable with the U.S. agencies.
</P>
<P>
Calm has returned to Liberia's capital of Monrovia following
the latest round of street fighting among warring factions in
April and May, seven months after the signing of the Abuja Peace
Accord.
</P>
<P>
Observers closely monitoring the developments in this West
African country doubted that the general elections would be held
as scheduled in August this year, citing delayed disarmament
process and repatriation of refugees.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria to Reopen Information Offices Abroad </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The federal government of Nigeria,
keen on a better image in the world, is to reopen very soon its
overseas information centers closed two years due to lack of
funds.
</P>
<P>
Information and Culture Minister Walter Ofonagoro said here on
Tuesday that the decision was to enable the government to counter
negative publicity about the country in the international circle.
</P>
<P>
The ministry is reposting information officers to the missions
to fill in the vacuum in news dissemination created by their
exit.
</P>
<P>
According to the minister, Nigeria's suspension from the
Commonwealth after the execution of nine Ogonis last November was
largely informed by the absence of information experts abroad.
</P>
<P>
Stressing that the job of image laundering was essentially the
responsibility of competent information officers, Ofonagoro
assured that the negative publicity being received by the country
would soon be over.
</P>
<P>
For now, only seven of the 13 offices are to be opened. They
are in London, Paris, Bonn, Brussels, New York, Washington DC and
Harare, the Guardian newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, 14 senior information officers, two for each
center, have been recommended to manage the centers, the paper
said.

GUIYANG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Guizhou Province, which previously

rid of the disease after four decades of efforts, local public
health officials say.

under control, and by 1984, filariasis was almost completely
eradicated.

Institute of Parasite Prevention and Treatment in 18 counties
showed that none was infected with the endemic disease.
</P>

<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China built 758,000 automobiles in
the first half of this year, up 2.42 percent over the same period
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
And the country sold 720,000 units in the same period, down a
fractional 0.1 percent over the first six months of 1995,
according to a report provided by the Automotive Industry
Department, under the Ministry of Machine-building Industry (MMI).
</P>
<P>
The report says that both automobile production and sales of
the country have maintained a downward movement with each passing
month, bringing stockpiled automobiles up to 116,000 units in
June, from 88,000 units earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
However, both production and sales of sedan cars have been on
steady rise during the period.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China turned out 190,000 sedan cars and
sold 182,000 in January-June, up 38.8 percent and 31.3 percent
respectively.

</P>
<P>
According to the report, Chinese auto makers have produced
utterly different economic results due to differences in

<HEADLINE> 1997 Brings Good Prospects for HK Tourism (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's tourism industry is
expecting a brighter future toward and beyond the year of 1997,
said Lo Yuk Sui, chairman of the Hong Kong Tourist Association
(HKTA).
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Xinhua, Lo said Hong Kong's returning to
its motherland will by no means blunt Hong Kong's competitive edge
on the international tourist market.
</P>
<P>
Instead, Lo said, the leading position of Hong Kong's tourism
industry in the Asia-Pacific region will be strengthened.
</P>
<P>
Lo has just wound up a visit to the Chinese mainland. The
visit, he said, has greatly boosted his confidence in the future
of Hong Kong's tourist services.
</P>
<P>
During his stay in the mainland, Lo met with Vice Premier and
Foreign Minister Qian Qichen, Deputy Director of the Hong Kong and
Macao Affairs Office of the State Council Chen Ziying, Director of
the Chinese National Tourism Administration He Guangwei and other
senior officials.
</P>
<P>
Lo discussed with them joint programs for opening up tourism
markets in the world.
</P>
<P>
"With the rich tourism resources in the Chinese mainland, Hong
Kong will see a new boom in tourism," he said.
</P>
<P>
As one of the popular tourist resorts in the region, Hong Kong
received 10.2 million tourists in 1995, a 9.3 percent increase
over 1994.
</P>
<P>
Tourism earnings reached 75 billion HK dollars (9.68 billion US
dollars) in 1995, an increase of 16.6 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
According to Lo, Hong Kong's tourism income has accounted for
eight percent of Hong Kong's GDP and the tourism industry was the
second biggest foreign currency earner in the territory last
year, next only to the textiles industry.
</P>
<P>
"Tourism industry will be No.1 foreign currency earner in Hong
Kong in next few years," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
He said that around the year of 1997, there are more favorable
factors for the expansion of Hong Kong tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
First, he explained, Hong Kong will become the focus of world
attention in the next few years and it will maintain its status as
trade, finance and shipping centers under the principle of "one
country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
Secondly, he said, the cooperation between Hong Kong and the
Chinese mainland will be further enhanced.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the "China Tour 1997" program launched by the
Chinese National Tourist Administration is expected to bring more
tourists to Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Thirdly, he said, the opening of the new airport will also
enable Hong Kong to receive more visitors. HKTA forecasts that 17
million visitors would visit Hong Kong in 2005.
</P>
<P>
To maintain the advantages of Hong Kong's tourism industry and
foster a long-term strategic goal for tourism development, HKTA
has finished a feasibility study on the visitors and tourists
services in the territory.
</P>
<P>
HKTA has decided to allocate 50 million HK dollars (6.45
million US dollars) to set up a tourism development fund for
supporting such programs as the Millennium Park on the site of Kai
Tak Airport, the film theme park at Tsing Yi work site, the
Aquatic Stadium at Sha Tin, Festival Market Place at Tsimshatsui,
New Lookout Point at Lion Rock and Tai Mo Shan, and the Cruise
Center.
</P>
<P>
HKTA now has over 1,700 member units in Hong Kong and 18
offices all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Lo said HKTA is now preparing to set up a business office in
Beijing so as to facilitate the cooperation in the tourism
industries between Hong Kong and the Chinese mainland.

<HEADLINE> HK Residential Mortgage Continues to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Residential mortgage loans for
the purchase of properties in Hong Kong continued to grow at a
fast rate in June, according to results of a survey released today
by the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
</P>
<P>
The latest figures show that the total amount of outstanding
mortgage lending by the 33 institutions in the survey increased by
1.4 percent to 297.5 billion HK dollars (38.14 billion US
dollars). The growth rate is slightly higher than the monthly
average of 1.3 percent over the last twelve months.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for HKMA said that the growth of residential
mortgage lending in June partly reflected the drawdown of loans
associated with refinancing of existing mortgages.

<HEADLINE> Inflation Rate May Rise to Six Percent in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Top officials of India's Finance
Ministry admitted that the inflation rate may go up to around six
percent in the post-budget months from the present 4.4 percent,
the National Herald said today.
</P>
<P>
The officials told a news briefing here Tuesday that in the
next six months the rate of inflation "may go up to six to seven
percent and may hover round six percent."
</P>
<P>
Finance Minister P. Chidambaram presented a maiden budget to
the parliament on Monday for approval.
</P>
<P>
The Finance Ministry officials maintained that much of the
expected rise in inflation is attributable to the recent hike in
the administered prices of petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The upward revision in the prices of petroleum products had
become inevitable, they said.
</P>
<P>
The government announced earlier a massive hike in prices of
petroleum products such as petrol, diesel and cooking gas, which
has triggered off widespread criticism.

<HEADLINE> Fry Shortage Pushes Up Eel Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A shortage of fry is driving up eel
prices ahead of the day -- July 27 this year -- when Japanese
customarily eat grilled eels at the peak of the dog days of
summer, industry sources said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The shortage is due in part to environmental pollution in
rivers, they said.
</P>
<P>
Currently, imports from China, Taiwan and several other
countries account for about 70 percent of the total domestic
demand for eels and most of the imported eels are in the form of
processed food such as grilled eels, they said.
</P>
<P>
Wholesale prices of eels imported from China are 300 to 400 yen
higher per kilogram this year than last year due to low
temperatures in the country, they said.
</P>
<P>
As a result, retail prices at supermarkets are also higher,
with smaller grilled eel selling for 780 yen, about 100 yen higher
than last year, according to Daiei officials.
</P>
<P>
Japanese customarily eat grilled eels at this time in the
belief that eel meat invigorates during the hot season.

<HEADLINE> China Condemns Proposed Taiwan's Representation in UN </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government expressed
strong indignation today over Nicaragua and a small number of
other countries' proposal on Taiwan's so-called "representation"
in the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
Cui Tiankai, spokesman for the Chinese Foreign Ministry, said
that Nicaragua and a small number of other countries recently sent
a letter to UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali, openly
disregarding history and bringing up the issue of Taiwan's so
called "representation" in the UN.
</P>
<P>
Calling this a serious event which wantonly tramples on the UN
Charter and its principles and interferes in China's internal
affairs, the spokesman said the Chinese government and people
strongly condemn such an action.
</P>
<P>
"The Taiwan issue is China's internal affair. We firmly oppose
the interference in China's internal affairs by any country in
violation of the guidelines of the UN Charter."
</P>
<P>
Cui continued that the United Nations is an international
inter-government organization composed of sovereign states, and
only sovereign states can become its members. Taiwan has been an
inalienable part of Chinese territory ever since ancient times. As
a province of China, Taiwan has no qualification whatsoever to
join the UN in any form.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, he noted, the 26th UN General Assembly
adopted resolution No.2758 with overwhelming majority, which had
far-reaching historic significance. The resolution not only
restored all the legitimate rights of the People's Republic of
China in the UN, but also fairly and thoroughly settled the issue
of China's representation in the UN, therefore frustrating a small
number of countries' conspiracy to create "two Chinas" or "one
China, one Taiwan" in the UN.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan authorities, going against the historical trend and
not content with their failure in the UN for three successive
years, have again brought up the issue of so-called its
participation in UN this year and made a great effort to draw in
and buy over a small number of countries to work for their attempt.
</P>
<P>
What needs to be pointed out, the spokesman went on to say, is
that the Taiwan authorities' splittist activities of creating "two
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" have led to tensions across the
Taiwan Straits. Such tensions, absent for many years, have
directly affected Taiwan's economic development and social
stability, seriously damaging the interests of Taiwan compatriots.
</P>
<P>
"Only when the Taiwan authorities really return to the
principle of 'one China' and work earnestly to promote relations
across the Taiwan Straits, can the happiness of the Taiwan people
be fundamentally ensured. This will also bring about benefit to
the people on both sides of the Straits and ensure a bright future
for Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reaffirmed that the basic policy of the Chinese
government in solving the Taiwan issue is "peaceful reunification
and one country, two systems".
</P>
<P>
"We have all along stood for political negotiations on peaceful
reunification across the Taiwan Straits. Under the prerequisite of
one China, any issue including those the Taiwan authorities are
concerned about can be discussed," Cui said.
</P>
<P>
However, Cui said, the Taiwan authorities have so far acted
wilfully and continued their activities attempting to separate the
motherland, in collusion with international anti-China
forces. Such acts will certainly meet with firm opposition from
all the Chinese people including those in Taiwan, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We firmly believe that we will continue to have the
understanding and support from other countries and from the UN in
our just cause of safeguarding national sovereignty, territorial
integrity and reunification of the motherland. And any scheme to
set the interests of the Taiwan compatriots against the overall
interests of the Chinese nation is doomed to failure," Cui
concluded.

<HEADLINE> Ma Xirong: Prophet of Tangshan Earthquake (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TANGSHAN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Ma Xirong became a prophet of
doom, and it saved the lives of his family.
</P>
<P>
He warned them to take stay alert against a possible
earthquake. Just hours later his home city of Tangshan was
virtually wiped off the face of the earth.
</P>
<P>
The earth opened up and consumed the city in one of the biggest
tragedies of the 20th century. Over 240,000 people died, tens of
thousands were injured, many children were orphaned, whole
communities were wiped out in minutes.
</P>
<P>
Twenty years on, Ma remembers the quake as though it was
yesterday. Few people, even experienced seismologists, made
accurate predictions in the days before Tangshan of the earthquake
to follow.
</P>
<P>
Ma Xirong, then a part-time working staff of Majiagou Seismic
Station in Tangshan, was one of the few to warn about the
impending horror.
</P>
<P>
Ma, now a professional seismologist, said he still feels pained
by the quake. Not only did it cause grievous casualties and
economic losses, but also he believes that local people should
have been warned in advance to take precautions.
</P>
<P>
Unfortunately, Ma's prediction about a strong earthquake was
not issued because of divergence of views among Chinese
seismologists at the time.
</P>
<P>
The deadly disaster hit Tangshan at 3:42 am on July 28, 1976,
shortly after Ma made his final prediction.
</P>
<P>
A total of 240,000 people were killed and 524,000 injured, many
of them still sleeping in their beds. The 100-year-old prosperous
city turned into a ruin overnight.
</P>
<P>
But all of Ma's family survived the quake, which measured 7.8
on the Richter scale, because he had told them to be vigilant all
night.
</P>
<P>
"I had reported to the State Seismology Bureau and the Bureau
of Hebei Province on July 6 that a strong earthquake might hit
Tangshan in near future," said Ma.
</P>
<P>
"Some experts came to my station on July 14 to study data I
collected," he recalled, "But some of them didn't agree with me,
and the prediction was not published finally."
</P>
<P>
As a worker at the Majiagou Coal Mine, Ma established the
seismic station, and started his part-time forecasting job there
in 1975, when the country decided to set up a group of seismic
stations to monitor and forecast earthquakes in the
Beijing-Tianjin-Tangshan area, one of China's most active seismic
regions.
</P>
<P>
Only in May of 1976 did Ma start his observations, using
monitoring instruments, numerical values of resistivity of
terrestrial electricity abnormally dropping for four times in less
than one month.
</P>
<P>
"The abnormal drops of the values indicated severe deformations
of the earth's crust," Ma said.

<TEXT>
<P>
On July 27, a day before the earthquake occurred, Ma observed
another sharp drop of the value. He concluded that a strong
earthquake would take place soon. He immediately reported his
prediction to departments in charge of earthquake forecasting.
</P>
<P>
"At that time I was unauthorized to declare forecast results to
the public," Ma said.
</P>
<P>
"Even at the night of July 27 I had told myself that the
prediction should be published as soon as possible," he recalled,
still looking regretful and sorrowful two decades on.
</P>
<P>
"But the quake occurred too quickly to take any preventative
action," he said.
</P>
<P>
The deadly seconds witnessed hundreds of thousands of deaths
and injures, as well as 30 billion yuan (3.8 billion US dollars)
in economic losses at 1976 prices. It was the most destructive
earthquake in China's history.
</P>
<P>
In the past 20 years, Tangshan has step by step revived from
debris and rebuilt itself into a new city, with a population of
1.4 million.
</P>
<P>
The city has re-emerged as an industrial base and
transportation hub, only five hours drive from Beijing, in north
China.
</P>
<P>
Like the city, great changes have also taken place for Ma
himself and the Majiagou Seismic Station.
</P>
<P>
Ma's research work has been supported by the state and
provincial seismological departments and research institutes. His
station has been equipped with advanced monitoring instruments,
and more observation methods have been adopted in seismological
forecasting.
</P>
<P>
Linked with the state- and province-level earthquake monitoring
networks, Ma and his colleagues send observed data to the state
and provincial earthquake analysis and forecast centers every day.
</P>
<P>
Although Ma had correctly predicted the strong quake, he is
working hard with his colleagues on short-term seismological
forecasts and pre-earthquake forecasts, which are still regarded
as a big problem, not only for Chinese seismologists, but also for
counterparts worldwide.

<HEADLINE> Guerrillas Attack Israeli Patrol in S. Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Guerrillas of the Lebanese Amal
Movement, a moderate Shiite Moslem group, attacked Tuesday an
Israeli patrol in south Lebanon, all of the soldiers were either
killed or wounded, a statement of the group announced here this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The pro-Syrian group, led by House Speaker Nabih Berri, said in
the statement that one unit of the guerrillas launched the assault
on the Israeli patrol near the Israeli position of Gantara,
Marjayoun, inside the Israeli self-proclaimed "security zone" at
11:00 p.m. (2000 GMT) Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the guerrillas showered the Israeli
patrol with rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns, and a
fierce clash erupted between the guerrillas and the Israeli
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli helicopters hovered over the venue to reinforce the
attacked patrol, swept the battlefield and lifted the killed and
wounded soldiers, according to the statement. It was the first one
of its kind waged by the Amal movement since a cease-fire was
enforced in south Lebanon on April 27.
</P>
<P>
Amal is engaged in a competition with the Lebanese pro-Iranian
Hezbollah, or Party of God, for a leading role in the guerrilla
warfare, or the anti-Israel movement.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this year, 16 Israeli soldiers have been
killed by Shiite Moslem guerrillas in south Lebanon, the last
active battlefront of the Arab-Israeli conflict, including nine
killed since Israel and Lebanon reached the cease-fire
understanding on April 26.
</P>
<P>
The U.S.-broked understanding banned the Lebanese guerrillas
and the Israeli occupation forces from attacking civilian areas.

<HEADLINE> Gratifying Development In Yangtze River Delta (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- With just 500 employees,
Shanghai's Beiling Micro-Electronics Company does 400 million yuan
in business annually, which is two-thirds of the annual production
value of Shanghai's entire micro-electronics industry.
</P>
<P>
The eight-year-old company, located in the Caohejing Hi-Tech
Development Zone, manufactures integrated circuit boards each
containing 300,000 transistors, and is rated one of the most
advanced and efficient companies of its kind in China.
</P>
<P>
It serves as an example of successful manufacturers in hi-tech
development zones in the Yangtze River Delta, one of China's
economic powerhouses.
</P>
<P>
The 6-sq-km development zone now has 500 companies, 150 of whom
are overseas-funded. Major multinationals, such as AT&AMP;T, GE, 3M,
ICI, Philips, Toshiba, and Dupont, have subsidiaries in the zone.
</P>
<P>
The zone has a range of hi-tech industries in
micro-electronics, bio-engineering, new materials, automation
meters, aviation, and space technology, and had a total turnover
of ten billion yuan in 1995, an average of 150,000 yuan per
person, three times the figure for workers in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Wang Shenghong, chairman of the Joint Development Company of
the development zone, said that it had succeeded initially in
introducing and developing high technologies.
</P>
<P>
"In the future our zone will try to formulate new procedures
and methods and introduce systems that will be compatible with
international practices," he said.
</P>
<P>
Major manufacturers in the Yangtze River Delta are now shifting
to relying on science and technology to increase the value of
their products.
</P>
<P>
The strategy of improving the economy by means of science and
technology is being pursued in many cities in the delta, so that
science and technology will contribute 50 percent to increased
production value in the year 2000, up from 30 percent in 1995.

</P>
<P>
The Turkish security forces had started military operations in
search of the PKK rebels in the region, the report added.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting for an autonomous or independent
Kurdish state in the southeastern Turkey for 12 years in a
conflict that has claimed the lives of more than 20,000 people,
including PKK rebels, civilians and the Turkish government
troops alike.

<HEADLINE> Gratifying Development Zones in Yangtze River Delta (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Six hi-tech development zones have been established in the
cities of Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuxi, Changzhou, Suzhou, and Hangzhou.
</P>
<P>
The 1,500 manufacturers in the zones reported a total of 40
billion yuan in business in 1995, up 20 percent from the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
Lying on the northern part of the Yangtze River Delta, Jiangsu
has had rapid economic growth since China started its policy of
reforms and opening up to the outside world in 1979.
</P>
<P>
The combined value of the province's industrial production
amounted to 1.5 trillion yuan last year, more than any other
province in China.
</P>
<P>
In contrast to this, however, developed countries' science and
technology contribute 60 to 80 percent to increased production,
far higher than in Jiangsu, said Chen Huanyou, secretary of the
Jiangsu Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party.
</P>
<P>
"So, we must speed up scientific and technological progress and
improve the competitiveness of manufactured goods made in
Jiangsu," he explained.
</P>
<P>
Four national-level hi-tech development zones in Nanjing,
Changzhou, Wuxi and Suzhou have reported sound growth of
electronics information, new materials, bio-engineering, and
pharmaceutical industries over the past few years.
</P>
<P>
The combined turnover of the zones is expected to come to 50
billion yuan in 1996, double the figure for 1995.
</P>
<P>
According to economists here, hi-tech enterprises in the zones
will serve to increase growth in similar enterprises in local
areas.
</P>
<P>
Cooperation with overseas companies will remain a major
approach for the development of hi-tech industries in the Yangtze
River Delta for a long time to come, one economist noted.

<HEADLINE> Yangtze River Delta Sees Financial Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China's Yangtze River delta has
become the most financially bustling area in China, with a density
of financial service facilities unmatched anywhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai, the country's largest industrial and commercial
center, has seen the number of financial points and outlets double
since 1990 to exceed 2,700.
</P>
<P>
"Residents are visiting banks and other financial service
facilities more often than ever to deposit and withdraw money,
trade in securities and foreign exchange, and pay telephone and
gas fees," said an official at the Shanghai branch of the People's
Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
"Equity investors alone now number more than three million
here," he said, adding that securities trading totaled more than
5.5 trillion yuan (about 654.8 billion US dollars) last year,
nearly twice the 1994 figure.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has already appeared as an embryo of China's financial
center, the official said, pointing to the fact that the city has
a concentration of 14 head offices or branches offices of domestic
banks, five Chinese insurance companies, 38 operational foreign
banks and 116 representative offices of foreign banks.
</P>
<P>
The trading price at the China Foreign Exchange Trading System,
which has been electronically linked up with 23 local foreign
exchange markets, has become a most important index for the local
currency's market-driven exchange rate, the official said.
</P>
<P>
In Jiangsu Province, on the north side the Yangtze River, there
are now more than 15,000 financial service facilities, up from
8,000 in 1990.
</P>
<P>
In Zhejiang Province, on the south side of the Yangtze River,
there are nearly 6,000 commercial banks and branch offices and
over 2,400 credit cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
An official at the central bank's Jiangsu branch office said
that "the increase in the number of financial service facilities
is a reflection of economic development, as well as a need for
further economic progress."
</P>
<P>
However, Jean-Pierre Vassaux, general manager of Shanghai
Associated Finance Company, a Sino-French financial firm, said
that the development of the financial industry in the Yangtze
River Delta is still primary, and the financial market has not
been formed in the real sense.
</P>
<P>
"There still exists great room for the further development of
financial institutions, including foreign ones," Vassaux said.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that the financial sector in the delta area will
witness a great leap as China's market economy system keeps
maturing, and foreign banks will be allowed to conduct business in
the Chinese currency yuan.

<HEADLINE> UNHCR Accuses Burundi of Expelling Rwandan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations High
Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) today accused the Burundi
government of forcibly expelling Rwandan refugees from camps in
northern Burundi.
</P>
<P>
The forced closure of Kibezi camp began on late Friday when
the Burundi authorities moved into the camp and began trucking
refugees to the Rwandan border, according to a UNHCR release
available here today.
</P>
<P>
"The camp was looted by local residents on Saturday and
refugee huts burned," said the release.
</P>
<P>
"On Sunday, the Burundi army moved into a second camp, Ruvumu.
Some 7,000 refugees have fled into the hills, with about 8,000
refugees remaining in the camp," it added.
</P>
<P>
The UNHCR report also pointed out that both Kibezi and Ruvumu
camps have been cordoned off by the military. And U.N. officials
have been denied access to the two camps since the operations
began.
</P>
<P>
the Burundi government had earlier threatened that three out
of four camps for Rwandan refugees in the north would have to be
closed by June 30 and that those who were not willing to return
to Rwanda would be relocated at the fourth camp, Magara.
</P>
<P>
Reports say some transfers of refugees from the other three
camps had already taken place prior to the expulsions. The Magara
camp population currently stands at around 42,000.
</P>
<P>
So far, no forced movements are reported from Magara or the
other camp, Rukuramigabo.
</P>
<P>
The total Rwandan refugee population in Burundi before the
expulsions was approximatedly 85,000.

<HEADLINE> World Bank Project's Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- In Xiaogumao Village, Liu Yuliang
surprised journalists by saying that money is now being made from
stone ponds under the eaves of houses in this poverty-ridden
village in mountainous southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
Liu, who is the village chief, explained that the stone ponds
are used to store and treat straw for ox fodder.
</P>
<P>
The new fodder-processing method was introduced at the start of
last year as a part of the World Bank's Southwest Poverty
Reduction Project, according to Liu.
</P>
<P>
The project was officially launched last August for 3.5 million
poverty-stricken people in 35 counties and three cities in Guizhou
and the neighboring Yunnan Province and the Guangxi Zhuang
Autonomous Region.
</P>
<P>
Liu said that the new method, which helped farmers raise an
average of three oxen each year, helped to lift the per capita
income of his village by 193 yuan (about 23 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
A county official in charge of World Bank loans said that
another 28 sub-projects of the anti-poverty project in Puding have
also gone smoothly.
</P>
<P>
The Southwest Poverty Reduction Project, at a cost of 4.23
billion yuan, including 200 million US dollars in World Bank
interest-free loans and 47.5 million US dollars in commercial
loans, is the largest poverty reduction project in which an
international financial body is participating. It is designed to
help raise the per capita income of farmers to more than 400 yuan
(in 1990 constant prices) by July of 2000, when the whole project
will be completed.
</P>
<P>
Sources at the State Council's Leading Group for Economic
Development of Impoverished Areas say that the Southwest Poverty
Reduction Project is going as planned. Latest statistics show that
investment in the project was 309 million yuan by the end of March
this year, about nine percent of the total cost.
</P>
<P>
Pieter Bottelier, chief of the World Bank's resident mission in
China, told Xinhua that "poverty reduction is a very tough task in
China and a full and successful implementation of the Southwest
Project will materially contribute to reduction of poverty in the
targeted areas."
</P>
<P>
Official data show that China's poverty-ridden population
stands at 65 million at present, down by 20 million from
1991. Premier Li Peng declared in 1994 that the problem of
providing the poorest with enough to eat and wear by the end of
this century would be solved.

<HEADLINE> Sales of Imported Alcohol In Shanghai Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- In spite of the sweltering
weather in China's largest city, it's just not as cool to buy
imported alcoholic drinks here as it used to be.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai's "Wen Hui Bao" daily reports that local residents are
turning a cold shoulder to "Remy Martin", "Martell" and other
imported cognacs, which were a token of wealth and high social
status just several years ago, but which have now come in for
heavy criticism because of their cost.
</P>
<P>
Such expensive goods, usually costing at least 200 to 800 yuan
(24 to 96 US dollars) per bottle, have come under fire for their
consumption at lavish dinners, where some officials and ordinary
citizens were criticized for wasting state and company funds.
</P>
<P>
In addition, "foreign alcohol and wines have been listed
as 'sluggish commodities' in Shanghai," the newspaper quoted
statistics released by the Shanghai Sugar, Tobacco and Liquor
Company as saying.
</P>
<P>
Sales of the commodities dropped by 20 percent in the fourth
quarter of 1995, compared with that of the same period in 1994. In
the first half of this year, sales further decreased by 30 percent
over those of the second half of 1995, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"At the beginning of 1994, sales of imported liquor accounted
for over one-third of the total in our store," said Shen Renguan,
marketing manager of the Shanghai No.1 Food Store, one of the
largest foreign liquor sellers in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"But sales have declined in a large way since last year," he
said, citing the turnover in foreign spirits accounting for only
about five percent of the total in the store on July 21 as an
example.
</P>
<P>
Many other big stores have announced that they will not
re-stock imported liquors in the near future, and some specialty
shops handling only such goods are shifting to other commodities,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper attributed the "bear market" in imported alcohol
mainly to the government's anti-corruption campaign which was
beefed up over recent two years.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, some units bought cases of imported liquors with
public funds from our store," said Shen Renguan, "but it is
difficult to see such things nowadays."
</P>
<P>
The "bull market" of foreign liquor and wine began to emerge in
China in the mid-1980s, as the better-off Chinese consumers
started to use high-priced imported alcohol as a symbol of their
growing social status.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, France's Remy Martin sold 16 million bottles of brandy
in China, making up a major part of its sales in Asia.
</P>
<P>
"But when Chinese people's psychology of consumption became
more sophisticated, many liquor lovers began to realize that it's
just not worth it to spend a big sum on imported drink, so they
began to turn to the much less expensive Chinese brands," the
report said.
</P>
<P>
"We only sold three bottles of foreign brands this month,"
restaurateur Ni Shao said, "But the domestic drinks sold more than
ten bottles every day."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Sino-ASEAN Relations Enter New Stage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China's relations with the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) have entered a new
stage with China participating in the Post Ministerial Conference
(PMC) of the 29th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM) for the first
time as a full Dialogue Partner.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministers of the seven ASEAN member countries welcomed
China, India and Russia, three major powers which have an
important role in maintaining peace and stability in the region,
as ASEAN's new Dialogue Partners.
</P>
<P>
Ali Alatas, chairman of the 29th AMM told Chinese Vice Premier
and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen that the Dialogue Partnership for
China will generate greater cooperation between ASEAN and China.
</P>
<P>
At today's PMC meeting, Qian said that to develop long-term,
good neighborly and friendly relations with ASEAN is an important
component of China's foreign policy. With joint efforts, the
cooperation between the two sides has made substantial progress in
all fields.
</P>
<P>
China and ASEAN are both new and rising forces and developing
countries in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Politically, the two sides have maintained frequent exchanges
of high-level visits. Meanwhile, the two sides have established a
system of regular senior official consultations which had
effectively enhanced understanding and mutual trust.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also increased coordination and mutual
support as they have common and identical views on many
international and regional issues.
</P>
<P>
On regional security cooperation, China made its basic stand
known on the Nansha question, expressing its willingness to
resolve disputes through peaceful means in accordance with the
principles defined in international laws including the 1982 UN
Convention on the International Law of the Sea.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN countries have appreciated China's stand and its efforts
for resolving regional disputes.
</P>
<P>
Qian said that China will continue its support for an active
participation in the ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) so as to enhance
security cooperation in the region.
</P>
<P>
Economically, the two sides also enjoyed a satisfactory
cooperation. Since the end of 1980's, bilateral trade has grown at
an average annual rate of 20 percent, approaching 20 billion US
dollars in 1995, a 40 percent increase compared with that of 1994.
 ASEAN has become the sixth largest trade partner of China.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have also conducted fruitful and mutually
beneficial cooperation in the areas of banking, project contract
and labor contract.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the China-ASEAN Joint Economic and Trade Committee
and the China-ASEAN Scientific and Technological Committee have
been established, giving a boost to bilateral and multilateral
cooperation in the fields of trade, science and technology.
</P>
<P>
An ASEAN official participating in the current ASEAN meeting
believed that Dialogue Partnership for China will not only promote
Sino-ASEAN cooperation in various fields but also help increase
ASEAN's impact on the world affairs as China is the largest
developing nation in the world and a major power in Asia.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and ASEAN officials here expressed their hope that with
the new century around the corner, a China-ASEAN partnership of
good neighborliness and mutual trust, a partnership oriented
towards the 21st century will be established with joint efforts.

<HEADLINE> Low Mustard Acid Rape </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have strived
to reduce levels of harmful substances in the country's important
rape crops.
</P>
<P>
Their dreams are finally coming true, at least in some
areas. The experts have succeeded in lowering the content of
mustard acid and glycoside thiosulfate in rape -- two substances
harmful to human health.
</P>
<P>
The growing area of rape with low levels of mustard acid and
low glycoside thiosulfate now accounts for 20 percent of the
national total.
</P>
<P>
Since a research program was jointly launched by the State
Science and Technology Commission, the Ministry of Agriculture and
International Development and Research Center of Canada in 1983,
15 improved varieties of rape have been developed in China.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the quality varieties were planted on 1.6 million
hectares of land, accounting for 20 percent of the total. The
proportion is expected to rise to 50 percent at the end of the
century.
</P>
<P>
Rape is one of China's major oil-bearing plants. It is grown on
over 5.5 million ha of fields, producing some 7.6 million tons of
rape seed.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Nightmare Ends, Brother, Sister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- For the past 50 years, Rivka
Bromberg Feingold has lived in a nightmare, obsessed with the
belief that the rest of her whole family in Poland were murdered
in the Nazi Holocaust.
</P>
<P>
On Tuesday, however, the nightmare came to an end. Feingold,
79, was reunited with one of her two brothers, Solomon Bromberg,
at her home in Rehovot, south of Tel Aviv, after the separation of
60 years.
</P>
<P>
Solomon arrived from Russia to an emotional welcome by her
sister and her family, which was mixed with tears and laughters.
</P>
<P>
Having settled in the Russian town of Kazan, 700 kilometers
from Moscow, Solomon also believed he was the last survivor of the
Bromberg family.
</P>
<P>
Feingold immigrated to Palestine in 1936 when she lost contact
with her family in Poland. She learned later that her parents
perished at the Treblinka death camp, and thus presumed that the
rest of her family had met the same fate.
</P>
<P>
"We grew up thinking that we were alone," explained her
granddaughter, Sharon Feingold. "We thought that we were the only
ones left."
</P>
<P>
She recalled that her grandmother never discussed the past
with the grandchildren because it hurt her so much.
</P>
<P>
However, a series of coincidences helped Bromberg Feingold
realize an unimaginable dream.
</P>
<P>
The story began in Russia. Working on a project with Bezeq,
Israel's telecommunication company, Solomon's oldest son, Michael,
asked a co-worker to help him try to locate surviving family
members in Israel.
</P>
<P>
Upon his return to Israel, the co-worker contacted the Jewish
Agency for assistance.
</P>
<P>
Weeks later, Sharon Feingold got what she described as a
"strange" phone call from the agency, informing her that they
might have found one of the long-lost brothers of her
grandmother.
</P>
<P>
"I called my grandmother and told her that we may have found
some of her relatives," she said. "She was quiet at first, and
then she began to cry softly."
</P>
<P>
A short time later, Bromberg Feingold contacted her brother at
home. "That phone conversation was incredibly emotional. They
cried a lot as they remembered people and things from their
childhood," Sharon Feingold said.
</P>
<P>
During the conversation, Solomon explained to his sister that
he and another brother, Avraham, escaped to Russia on bicycles as
Poland fell to the Nazis. But Avraham was wounded in an explosion
and taken to a Russian hospital. The two were separated ever
since.
</P>
<P>
Encouraged by the reunion, now the two families are trying to
locate the whereabouts of Avraham and the younger sister, Rosa
Bromberg, both were believed to have settled in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
There are more than 500,000 Russian immigrants in Israel, and
many of them have had the same experience of the Bromberg
family. Politically active, the Russian immigrants formed a party
in recent years and acquired seven seats in the May 29
parliamentary elections.
</P>
<P>
Sharon said that the joy of reunion, as well as the hope for
future ones, transcends her grandmother and extends to the whole
family.
</P>
<P>
"It's absolutely amazing, for us as the next generation, to
wake up and find out that we have a whole other family," she
said. "We see our history becoming whole again."

<HEADLINE> PLO Pledges to Help Look for Israeli MIA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior PLO official has
promised to continue efforts to find out the whereabouts of the
remains of Israeli soldier Ilan Sa'adon, who was killed by Hamas
in 1989, Israel Radio reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Abbas (Abu Mazen), PLO Secretary General and deputy
of PLO President Yasser Arafat, made the statement Tuesday night
in Gaza,
</P>
<P>
Abbas said that four months ago, the PLO sent people abroad in
an effort to find accurate information about Sa'adon.
</P>
<P>
However, he refused to say whom the PLO dispatched and to which
country they were sent. In 1995, the PLO made an effort, but was
reportedly foiled by the Sudanese government during talks in
Khartoum, the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
During his meeting with Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy in
Gaza Tuesday afternoon, Arafat also reportedly told the
Likud government representative that the PLO will continue the
efforts to find out what had happened to Sa'adon.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Abbas declared that the PLO had indeed canceled
those parts in the Palestinian National charter, which call for
Israel's destruction. He added that the PLO was not playing a
trick, as believed by some in the Likud bloc.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the warning issued by Israel against the
Palestinian National Authority's (PA) activity in east Jerusalem,
Abbas said that there would be no change in the status quo in east
Jerusalem, because "there has never been PA activity in the city."
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Abbas, co-architect of the Oslo Accord, was elected
earlier this year Secretary General of the PLO, second only to
President Arafat in the organization.
</P>
<P>
Two bodies of Israeli MIAs were returned Sunday to Israel from
Lebanon under a Germany-mediated agreement between Israel and the
pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God. Israel wants to get back
all MIAs and POWs.

<HEADLINE> Africa Seeks to Combine Traditional, Modern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- African countries are seeking ways
to combine traditional and modern medicine to offer better cures
for its disease-ridden people.
</P>
<P>
"The concept gives patients a choice between modern and
traditional medicine over the most likely successful form of
remedy for an ailment," said Barbara Sibanda, founder of the
15-year-old Traditional and Medical Clinic in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
He said Zimbabwe's experiment is now spreading to Ghana,
Nigeria and Zambia, among other countries.
</P>
<P>
"Our success rate has been as good as any health delivery
system. The choice for the patient is now wider, some kind of
revolution in medical practice," said Sibanda, whose clinic is
cerebrating its 15th anniversary this week.
</P>
<P>
The concept of combination is gaining recognition in most
Sub-Saharan African countries where, despite the advent of modern
medicine over a century ago, up to 80 percent of Africans still
had faith in traditional herbal treatment.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe National Traditional Healers Association has
40,000 members.
</P>
<P>
"The anniversary is to consolidate the contribution of
traditional medicine to the health delivery system and
demonstrate how the two can harmoniously be combinedo produce
good, even better results," said Sibanda.

NAIROBI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan market is flooded with
counterfeit whiskey following opening up of the economy, an
International company's manager has said.
</P>
<P>
Sales Manager of William Grant and Sons International Rod
Sweeney said here on Tuesday that importers of counterfeit whiskey
evade paying full import duties and tax in Kenya, giving dealers

<P>
William Grant and Sons International is among the world's
leading producers of whiskey based in Britain.
</P>
<P>
Speaking during the signing of a distributor agreement with

is poor and that consumers should be on the look-out for the
contraband products by carefully checking the labels.
</P>
<P>
He said his company will invest in constructing a bottling
plant in Kenya but only if the contraband whiskey problem is
controlled.

<HEADLINE> More People Employed in Non-Public-owned Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- One in every ten Chinese people
are now working for private employers as the country's reform
policies advance.
</P>
<P>
Less than a decade ago, just three percent of China's working
population were hired by non-publicly-owned businesses.
</P>
<P>
The 6.4 percent leap compared to the 1986-90 period is an
indicator of the changing face of working life in China.
</P>
<P>
In some developed areas such as Shanghai, and provinces of
Hebei and Hubei, the figure rises to one in eight of the total
labor force in those areas.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest survey carried by "Organization and
Personnel News", almost 65 million people were employed in
foreign-funded firms, joint ventures, share-holding companies and
privately-owned businesses by the end of last year.
</P>
<P>
However, in some under-developed areas, such as the provinces of
Guizhou and Qinghai, the people employed in such non-public-owned
businesses is still only about five percent.
</P>
<P>
In China people had always looked to the state or
collectively-owned businesses for jobs in the past. But the
employment scene has started to change since the reform and
opening to the outsider world began in 1979.

LANZHOU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- If going by bus or riding a
bicycle gives you the hump, head to China's Dunhuang City, home of
the world-famous Mogao Grottos.
</P>
<P>
The city has introduced a rent-a-camel scheme as the latest way
of viewing the many tourist attractions.
</P>
<P>
The northwest China city has introduced a series of new
programs aimed at catering for tourists.
</P>
<P>
Besides viewing the splendid murals and color models created
during ten of the ancient Chinese dynasties, tourists can now rent
a car or a camel to visit the surrounding attractions and
beautiful countryside.
</P>
<P>
They can also drop in local homes to get some idea about the
life style of the Hui ethnic group.
</P>
<P>
If they are lucky enough, they will even have a chance to
attend a traditional wedding ceremony, performed with ancient
rituals.
</P>
<P>
The more energetic with a nose for adventure can journey in
off-the-road vehicles across sand dunes, or head into the desert
on camel.
</P>
<P>
Tourist officials said that the new programs are part of a
drive by Dunhuang, already one of the top tourist attractions in
China, to become one of the country's best tourist cities.
</P>
<P>
The campaign to choose such cities, launched by the China
National Tourism Administration, is now under way.

KUNMING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- One hundred pollution-creating
enterprises have been given an end-of-century deadline to clean up
their acts.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan provincial government has told the 100 enterprises in

<HEADLINE> Pig Slaughter A Bone Of Contention In Guangzhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Slaughterhouses in Guangzhou,
capital of south China's Guangdong Province have been banned
from 'policing' themselves.
</P>
<P>
The City People's Congress in Guangzhou has implemented a new
law forcing slaughterhouses to hand over their quarantine rights.
</P>
<P>
In the past decade a number of state-owned, collectively-owned and
private slaughterhouses have opened after Guangdong introduced
reforms in the trading and butchering of live pigs.
</P>
<P>
Quarantine checks were carried out by the slaughterhouses
themselves, a practice regarded by many consumers as "the referee
playing soccer."
</P>
<P>
As a result, sick and dead pigs have frequently appeared on the
meat markets. Some butchered pigs have been filled with water to
falsify their size and weights. Among pork eaters in the city safe
meat has become a bone of contention for society.
</P>
<P>
To comply with international practices, the city's congress
has withdrawn quarantine rights from slaughterhouses. The city
government has sent officials to conduct quarantine tests at
slaughterhouses.
</P>
<P>
The new practice will help Guangzhou's foodstock products to
enter international markets.
</P>
<P>
So far, 232 of the 368 big slaughterhouses in the city have
turned over their quarantine rights to the city government.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China's biggest city Shanghai
faces a water shortage within days if record consumption levels
continue.
</P>
<P>
Water supplies in Shanghai set a new record of 5.88 million
tons on Monday, 180,000 tons more than a record-breaking single
day's supply during a heat wave last year.
</P>
<P>
The local water supply company predicted the new record could
be smashed on a day-by-day basis as the heatwave lingers.
</P>
<P>
The company warned that its maximum water supply capacity per
day is six million tons, and the city might be short of 100,000
tons of water in the days to come.
</P>
<P>
If that happens, the water company will limit water supplies to

</P>
<P>
By Tuesday, the local water supply was still normal and there
had been no reports of big shortages of water in residential areas.

<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen said today that the Chinese government has
taken an active part in safeguarding regional peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the ASEAN post Ministerial Conference (PMC) opened
here this morning, Qian said the facts have showed that growth and
stability of China have become an integral part of the growth and
stability of Asia and the entire world.
</P>
<P>
A developed and strong China will only have positive and
favorable effect on this region and the world at large, he added.
</P>
<P>
Over the part year, China's national economy ran smoothly,
maintaining a growth of some 10.2 percent. Inflation is under
effective control and macro-economic regulation and control have
yielded initial results, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
If China is to continue the growth momentum, it must have a
stable social environment and peaceful neighbors, Qian briefed the
participants from seven ASEAN members and nine other dialogue
partners.
</P>
<P>
Last April, he said, China signed with the Russian Federation,
Kazakhstan, Kirghizstan and Tadzhikistan the agreement on
Confidence-Building in the Military Field in the Border Area.
This represented a significant effort on the part of China and the
above-mentioned countries to enhance mutual trust and strengthen
good-neighborly and friendly relations and will surely exert
positive impact on peace and stability in Asia-Pacific, he noted.

<HEADLINE> Contract Signed to Salvage Sunken "Chungshan" Warship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A famous Chinese warship, sunk in a
Japanese air attack in 1938 is to be raised from the bed of
the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Salvage experts believe that the cruiser "Chungshan", may be
lifted out of water before next February.
</P>
<P>
The Chongqing Yangtze River Rescue and Salvage Company has
won the bidding to salvage the warship, which has been lying on
the bed of the Yangtze River near Wuhan, capital city of
central China's Hubei Province.
</P>
<P>
The company has signed a contract with the Hubei Cultural
Administration to take charge of the overall rescue work, at a
cost of about five million yuan (about 601,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to the contract, the company will start the salvage
operation in early November, and the warship is expected to be
pulled out of water before February 15 next year.
</P>
<P>
After that, the cruiser will be sent to a shipyard for
renovation.
</P>
<P>
The cruiser, built in Japan in 1913 and named after Dr. Sun
Yat-sen, father of the Chinese democratic revolution, was sunk by
a Japanese plane in the Yangtze River near Wuhan in 1938.
</P>
<P>
During its 25 years of service, the warship had participated in
a number of historic events.
</P>
<P>
In early 1995, the company put forward preliminary plans to
rescue the cruiser. After feasibility studies by experts, the
company conducted surveys around the waters of the sunken ship in
March last year and January this year.

<HEADLINE> Banks Complain New Electronic System "Too Efficient" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A new electronic cheque clearing
system is making Thai commercial banks more difficult to manage
their treasury as it is too efficient for them to follow.
</P>
<P>
Commercial banks around the country are complaining that the
system launched by the central bank last week are pressing them to
clear cheques more quickly and they have to reserve more funds for
liquidity.
</P>
<P>
Local newspapers said that with the new system introduced,
commercial banks now spend only 30 minutes to clear cheques and
check balances, which usually took 2 hours before.
</P>
<P>
The more efficient system plus heavy selling on the Stock
Exchange of Thailand by foreign investors is pushing higher the
interest rate in the interbank market, where financial
institutions borrows overnight funds from each other.
</P>
<P>
Some banks urge the central bank to implement corresponding
measures to ease the situation before they get used to the system.

<HEADLINE> Production and Sales of China-made Wrist-watches Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China's wrist-watch industry is
having a tough time as foreign producers step up competition.
</P>
<P>
Although China produced more than 81.92 million wrist-watches
in the first four months of this year, the number was over 20
percent down compared to the same period of 1995, "China Light
Industry News" quoted statistics as saying.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the retail sales volume of wrist-watches in
the domestic market dropped by 15 percent in March-May from the
corresponding period last year.
</P>
<P>
Many of the country's wrist-watch makers have poor economic
performances, and the market is comparatively saturated, leading
to sluggish production and sales of wrist-watches.
</P>
<P>
Though China's central bank has lowered its interest rates, the
languishing domestic market does not seem to show signs of
recovering in the forseeable future.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that both exports and prices of home-made
wrist-watches have dropped sharply, as a result of a sluggish
international watch market.
</P>
<P>
Japan and Switzerland have cut the prices of their
wrist-watches, making China lose the advantage in pricing on the
international market.

DAR ES SALAAM, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Minister for Labor
and Youth Development William Lukuvi has declared war against
child employment, saying his ministry would this financial year
inspect work places to book employers hiring children.
</P>
<P>
Opening a four-day journalists' seminar in Dodoma, Central
Tanzania on Tuesday on elimination of child labor in Tanzania,
Lukuvi said the problem is serious and would spoil the children's
future if not controlled in time.
</P>
<P>
He said the exercise would be conducted by the industrial
inspection unit, which has been instructed to disclose all
employers engaged in the malpractices, according to local press
today.
</P>
<P>
according to studies, Lukuvi said, 30 percenttion of children
between ten and 14 years of age did not go to school because they
were engaged in labor in sisal estates, tobacco, mining and tea
estates...
</P>
<P>
He also cited schools as another place where children were
used as tools of production through tilling of land and attending
to teachers' gardens without any payment. He directed school
committees to educate parents against this exploitation.

<HEADLINE> Singapore to Remove Hotel Telephone Surcharges </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Telecommunication Authority
of Singapore (TAS) has said that it would remove the surcharges by
hotels and service apartments in order to keep the country
attractive as a travel destination.
</P>
<P>
According to the local newspaper reports today, the TAS said
that starting from January 1 next year, operators of hotels and
apartments will only be allowed to bill set-up charges of 30 cents
for each international direct dial (IDD) call, and ten cents for
each standard trunk dialing (STD) call.
</P>
<P>
The operators will in turn get volume discounts from Singapore
Telecommunications (SingTel), ranging from one to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
At present, hotels collect ten percent of the actual charges
for IDD calls from hotel rooms, and ten cents per three minutes
for STD calls. Hotels here already pay lower IDD charges than
normal households because they enjoy block discounts from the TAS,
the reports said.
</P>
<P>
TAS' move is seen here as the second and final stage in its
efforts to remove hotels' telecom surcharges to help keep
Singapore an attractive destination for businessmen and tourists.
</P>
<P>
The first stage was undertaken early last year when hotel
surcharges were brought down from 20 percent to 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
"The move is to ensure that Singapore's telecommunication costs
remain among the most competitive in the world, so as to maintain
Singapore's position as a business hub and top tourist and
international conference destination," the TAS said.

<HEADLINE> Fed Chairman: U.S. Economy to Slow Down in Year's 2nd Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed)
Chairman Alan Greenspan repeated his prediction today that the
U.S. economy will slow down in the second half of the year to a
level that doesn't presage increasing inflation.
</P>
<P>
In his message delivered to the Banking Committee of the U.S.
House of Representatives, he said that the Fed is watching all the
aspects carefully "to see how the economy evolves."
</P>
<P>
But he again noted that the slowdown of the economy hasn't
occurred although it would slow down in the second half and
continue the downward trend into the next year.
</P>
<P>
Business inventories are lean, implying a possible increase in
manufacturing activity ahead, he said. On the other hand,
consumers' debt is high and their appetite for buying new goods
waning.
</P>
<P>
There have been signs of tightness in regional labor markets
for at least a year, both for high-skilled and low-skilled jobs,
but inflationary strains haven't emerged as a result, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are not in distress, or not enough in distress, to be
concerned about it," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
Greenspan gave his testimony before the Banking Committee of
the U.S. Senate last week and hold the same view on the U.S.
economy.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said his comments are indicating that the Fed would
not immediately boost short-term interest rates but at the same
time wasn't ruling out an increase later if economic developments
justified it.
</P>
<P>
Fed's policy-making arm, the Federal Open Market Committee,
will meet on August 20 to decide whether any change is needed in
short-term interest rates.

<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- New homes for more than 120,000
families are underway in Beijing as the Chinese capital
accelerates construction of its housing and infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Targets set for the first half of 1996 have been reached,
officials have announced.
</P>
<P>
According to the local construction commission, by May, the
municipality had started on 18.82 million square meters of
housing, an increase of 15 percent over the same 1995 period, and
completed 780,000 square meters, a 49 percent rise.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months, 14 out of 17 key state and local
projects have been completed, involving 1.94 billion yuan (about
234 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Wang Zongli, director of the municipal construction commission,
said the city focused its attention on residential housing in the
first half of this year, building more new houses and renovating
many old dwellings in a bid to ease a housing shortage.
</P>
<P>
The east runway of the Capital International Airport has been
completed ahead of schedule, and over 300 suspended flights are
again operating on schedule.
</P>
<P>
As for 60-km-long highways scheduled for this year, over 20 km
have already been finished, including a road linking the downtown
area of Beijing with the Great Wall at Badaling section.

<HEADLINE> Australian Inflation Rate Drops </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Australia's inflation rate
dropped to the lowest level in 18 months in the fiscal year of
1995-96.
</P>
<P>
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) announced today that
the growth rate of consumer price index (CPI) dropped to 3.1
percent in the year to June, the lowest level since December,
1994.
</P>
<P>
ABS figures showed that the underlying inflation rate also
dropped to 3.1 percent in the 12 months to June from 3.3 percent
in the year to March.
</P>
<P>
Quarterly growth of CPI during April to June stood at 0.7
percent, while underlying inflation rate grew by 0.8 percent in
the same quarter.
</P>
<P>
The 3.1 percent inflation rate was slightly higher than market
expectations, with most economists predicting an annual rate of
2.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
The figure also fell outside the Reserve Bank of Australia's
(RBA) target of an annual inflation rate of 2-3 percent. This
meant that speculated interest rates cut by RBA would be delayed.
</P>
<P>
With the June quarter inflation figures slightly higher than
expected, the inflation focus now shifted to wage figures to be
released on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
RBA governor Bernie Fraser said last week if the central bank
was persuaded that wage increase was brought under control, it
would be easier for it to adjust to low inflation.
</P>
<P>
His statements were interpreted as an implication of possible
interest rate cuts if wage growth was restrained.
</P>
<P>
Local economists expected that average wage would rise by 0.9
percent in the June quarter, bringing the annual increase rate
down to 3.6 percent from 4.2 percent for the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Australian official interest rates remained unchanged at 7.5
percent since December, 1994. Some economists said that as local
economic growth was boosted by the recovery of world economy, the
interest rates might go up next year instead of going down.

<HEADLINE> Nepal Teenager Given 12 Years for Drug Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A young man from Nepal has been
sentenced in China to 12 years imprisonment, and expelled, for drug
smuggling, Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Count announced in
Shenzhen.
</P>
<P>
But he escaped a harsher sentence because of his age -- less
than 18 at the time of the offence.
</P>
<P>
Officials named the convicted smuggler as Iai Dipraj. They said
that on the evening of July 11, 1995, Iai Dipraj was found in
possession of four pieces of marijuana weighing 1,514 grams by the
inspection office at Luohu Customs in Shenzhen when he passed
through the port.
</P>
<P>
The Shenzhen City Intermediate People's Count accepted and heard
the case and confirmed that he had violated China's anti-drug law
and was guilty of drug smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Considering this age -- less than 18 years old at the time of
office - the Shenzhen City Intermediate People's Count reduced the
punishment when measuring the penalty according to Chinese law.
</P>
<P>
After the sentence was made by the Shenzhen Count, Iai Dipraj
appealed to the Guangdong Provincial Higher People's Count.
</P>
<P>
After investigation the Guangdong Provincial Higher People's
Count rejected the appeal and affirmed the original judgement.

<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- United Airlines has voluntarily
imposed strict new safety measures while other airlines heightened
security awareness following the fatal crashes of passenger planes
of the ValuJet and the Trans World Airlines (TWA).
</P>
<P>
The United's measures, imposed without any orders from the
Federal Aviation Administration, request its employees to stop
accepting small packages without opening them first and demand two
forms of identifications from the person trying to check the
packages, an Associated Press report said today.
</P>
<P>
The airlines will also step up spot searches of bags on
international trips, and may require bag-matching on all domestic
flights, which would prevent planes from taking off unless all
customers who checked bags are on board.
</P>
<P>
Some other airlines have also taken measures to tighten
security since the explosion of the TWA Flight 800 Wednesday night
that killed all the 230 people aboard.
</P>
<P>
TWA said it has been on a heightened security awareness.
Northwest Airlines said it has increased security in several areas
since the crash. And the Continental said it would review the
measures adopted by United.
</P>
<P>
United is also testing new equipment that might better detect
bombs and other illegal materials, Edmond Soliday, the airline's
vice president of corporate safety and security, was quoted as
saying.

<HEADLINE> China Earmarks 3 Billion Yuan for Environmental Protection </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China has earmarked about three
billion for environmental protection projects this year, including
loans worth 280 million US dollars granted by international
financial organizations and foreign governments.
</P>
<P>
According to an official at the State Economic Planning
Commission, the commission has allocated 630 million yuan (75.9
million US dollars) for projects related to forest shelter belt
construction and ecological protection, water and soil
conservation, environmental protection monitoring facilities and
grassland improvement and protection.
</P>
<P>
The commission is a powerful ministry in charge of the
formulation of the country's social and economic development
program.
</P>
<P>
A total of 335 million yuan (40 million US dollars) has been
allotted by the ministry for projects involving the construction
of forest shelter belts, desert control, forest and wildlife
conservation.
</P>
<P>
About 55 million yuan (6.62 million US dollars) investment has
been allocated for water and soil conservation along the upper and
middle reaches of the Yangtze River, the largest river in China.
</P>
<P>
The ministry also plans a 20 million yuan investment for
similar projects to conserve water and soil along the middle

</P>
<P>
A 50 million yuan government investment will be used this year
for water and soil conservation projects along the Pearl River in

central and east China and Haihe in north China.
</P>
<P>
The ministry increased its funding for environmental protection

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Votes to Expand Sanctions Against Libya, Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- In spite of protests of
American allies in Europe, the U.S. House of Representatives on
Tuesday approved a bill to penalize foreign individuals and
companies that contribute substantially to the oil sectors of
Libya and Iran.
</P>
<P>
The bill, in an attempt to tighten the screws on the two
countries, has already been approved by the Senate and is now sent
to President Bill Clinton for approval.
</P>
<P>
It is similar to a U.S. law on foreign investment in Cuba,
which has sparked a crisis between Washington and Cuban trading
partners in Europe, Canada and Mexico.
</P>
<P>
In a rush to approve, the House defeated moves to limit the
harm to European companies that have major stakes in Libyan oil
fields and are likely to invest in Iranian oil and gas.
</P>
<P>
The bill would require the president to impose two sanctions
out of a list of six on firms that invest 40 million U.S. dollars
or more in one year in Iran or Libya. It would also impose
sanctions on firms that break existing U.N. embargoes against
Libya, including a ban on sales of oil refinery equipment.
</P>
<P>
The six sanctions against a foreign company from which the
president must choose are: No U.S. Export-Import Bank assistance;
no U.S. export licenses to receive goods; not eligible for loans
of more than 10 million dollars in any one year from
U.S. financial institutions; not eligible to be a primary dealer
in U.S. government bonds; not eligible to bid on U.S. government
contracts; and not allowed to export goods to the United States.
</P>
<P>
The United States is hostile to Iran and Libya and accused them
of "human rights abuses" and "trying to acquire nuclear weapons."
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Clinton administration imposed a unilateral ban
on trade with Iran that applied only to U.S. companies and their
foreign subsidiaries. But this bill has extended the penalties to
any foreign individuals or companies if they trade with the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
European countries angered by the U.S. imposition of the
sanctions have threatened retaliation if the bill becomes
law.

<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The outbreak of food poisoning is
still raging in the western Japanese city of Sakai and the number
of victims is rising despite government efforts to quell the
epidemic.
</P>
<P>
A 10-year-old school girl in Sakai died Tuesday night from
bleeding in her lungs, which doctors said was obviously the result
of the O-157 E.coli strain of bacteria resposible for the outbreak.
</P>
<P>
The girl became the 17th victim of the bacillus, which has
attacked more than 8,300 people in 38 prefectures, including 6,240
schoolchildren in Sakai, Osaka Prefecture.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto has decided to gather experts
together to tackle the outbreak which is of unusual scale and has
the potential to spread further.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto pledged to make every possible effort to discover the
source of the epidemic and to find preventive measures during the
summer vacation period.

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Position on Question of Taiwan (Part I) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Qin Huasun, the Chinese
ambassador to the United Nations, today refuted the attempt by
Nicaragua and a very small number of other countries to interfere
in China's internal affairs on the question of Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to U.N. Secretary-General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, the Chinese permanent representative said that
Nicaragua and a small number of other countries, by requesting
Taiwan's "representation" at the U.N., distorted facts in an
attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"This not only constitutes a serious encroachment upon China's
sovereignty and a gross interference in its internal affairs, but
also gravely contravenes the purposes and principles of the United
Nations Charter and Resolution 2758 of the General Assembly, at
which the Chinese government and people express their utmost
indignation," he said.
</P>
<P>
On July 17, Nicaragua and a small number of other countries
delivered a letter and its annexes to Boutros-Ghali, asking for
the inclusion of so-called "Consideration of the exceptional
situation of the inability, resulting from General Assembly
Resolution 2758, of the 21.3 million people on Taiwan, Republic of
China, to participate in the activities of the United Nations" in
the agenda of the coming 51st General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Twenty-five years ago, Ambassador Qin recalled, the General
Assembly, at its 26th session, adopted by an overwhelming majority
the historically significant Resolution 2758.
</P>
<P>
It recognizes in unmistakable terms that "representatives of
the Government of the People's Republic of China are the only
lawful representatives of China to the United Nations and that the
People's Republic of China is one of the five permanent members of
the Security Council," and restores "all the lawful rights of the
People's Republic of China at the United Nations," Qin said.
</P>
<P>
"The adoption of this resolution, embodying the purposes and
principles of the U.N. charter, is a historical necessity and a
victory of justice," he said.
</P>
<P>
"It has not only expelled the Taiwan authorities from China's
seat in the United Nations usurped by them since 1949, thus
reversing the regression of history as a result of the Cold War,
and settling once and for all and in a just manner the question of
China's representation at the United Nations, but also has foiled
the schemes of a few countries to create 'two Chinas' or 'one
China, one Taiwan' in the United Nations," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to historical data, he pointed out that Taiwan has
been an inalienable part of China since ancient times. The 158
countries that have established diplomatic relations with the
People's Republic of China so far all recognize that there is but
one China in the world, that the Government of the People's
Republic of China is the sole legal government representing China
in its entirety and that Taiwan is part of China.
</P>
<P>
Though the two sides of the Taiwan Straits have been in a state
of temporary separation since October 1949, the status of Taiwan
as a part of the territory of the People's Republic of China has
never changed, nor has the Government of the People's Republic of
China ever given up its jurisdiction over Taiwan, said the Chinese
ambassador.
</P>
<P>
No change to the way in which leaders of Taiwan are produced
can change the fact that Taiwan is a part of the Chinese territory
and that Taiwan's leaders are leaders of a region of China.
Therefore, Taiwan has no qualifications whatsoever to join in
whatever form the United Nations and any inter-governmental
international organizations of the U.N. system participated by
representatives of sovereign states, he said.

<HEADLINE> Nepal to Study Disputative Border Issue with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government has
promised the opposition party that it would soon take up a
controversial border issue with India due to an agreement signed
early this month by local border officers.
</P>
<P>
Home Minister Khum Bahadur Khadka Tuesday told a Lower House
meeting that a parliamentary committee would be formed soon to
look into the issue.
</P>
<P>
On July 3, border officers of southern Nepal's Jhapa district
and neighboring Indian district of Kisangunj reportedly signed
some border papers, among others, requiring people living within
15.3 kilometers from the border to move out.
</P>
<P>
It was also reported that a new border pillar had been set up
an almost 1 kilometer inside the Nepali territory in the border
town of Bhadrapur.
</P>
<P>
Public anger over the border agreement appeared in the district
and the Bhadrapur town authorities had expressed grave concern
over "the Indian encroachment," according to the local press.
</P>
<P>
Some MPs of the main opposition Communist Party of Nepal (UML)
have been accusing the government for its "ignorance" to the
controversial issue in the parliament during the last few days
after they made an on-the-site inspection to the southern border
area.
</P>
<P>
So far the government could not unveil the contents of the
agreement reached by border officers of Nepal and India early this
month.
</P>
<P>
Chief district officer of Jhapa Birendra Kumar Singh said he
could not submit the text of the agreement to the central
government as a border officer who attended the talks was missing.
 The officer was said to have run away with the border talks
documents.

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Position on Question of Taiwan (Part II) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The Chinese ambassador noted that the question of Taiwan is the
internal affairs of China which must be settled by the Chinese
people themselves.
</P>
<P>
Any involvement by foreign forces constitutes an interference
in China's internal affairs, to which the Chinese people are
strongly opposed, he added.
</P>
<P>
The struggle against separation of Taiwan from its motherland
and Taiwan independence waged by the entire Chinese people,
including the Taiwan compatriots, since June last year has fully
demonstrated the resolve and ability of the Chinese Government and
people to safeguard their state sovereignty and territorial
integrity, he noted.
</P>
<P>
This struggle has inflicted a heavy blow on the forces seeking
independence and separation on the Taiwan island and produced a
significant and far-reaching positive impact on the promotion of
peaceful reunification, he added.
</P>
<P>
He added that there won't be tensions in the relations
between the two sides of the Straits and dialogue can be resumed
as long as Taiwan desists from seeking independence and
separation, the Taiwan authorities stop their activities aimed at
creating "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan" in the world and
foreign forces stop supporting and conniving at the separatist
moves by certain forces in Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese people, including the Taiwan compatriots, have a
strong aspiration to end the state of separation between the two
sides of the Straits. The Chinese Government proposed as early as
over a decade ago the policy of "peaceful reunification and one
country, two systems," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Chinese President Jiang Zemin's 1995 important
proposal to achieve peaceful reunification, Ambassador Qin pointed
out that this proposal has not only taken into consideration the
long-term interests of the entire Chinese people, but also
accommodated and safeguarded the vital interests of the Taiwan
compatriots.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government will adhere to this policy for a long
time to come in order to promote the development of relations
between the two sides of the Straits, thus creating more favorable
conditions for the peaceful reunification, he noted.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that "if the Taiwan authorities really have
sincerity, they should take concrete actions in this regard
without any delay and as the first step, talk with us on
officially ending the state of hostility between the two sides and
other political issues on the basis of one China principle."
</P>
<P>
"We welcome leaders of the Taiwan authorities to the mainland
for a visit in an appropriate capacity. We are also ready to
accept invitation from the Taiwan side to go to Taiwan," said the
Chinese ambassador.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that China will continue to enjoy
the support of the international community in the just cause of
maintaining state sovereignty and territorial integrity.

<HEADLINE> American Women Gymnasts Win Olympic Team Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The American women gymnasts won
their first ever Olympic gold medal here on Tuesday, finishing
atop with a total of 389.225 points in a field 12 teams.
</P>
<P>
The host Americans beat overnight leaders Russia to the second
position by a winning margin of 0.821, with defending world
championships winners Romania taking the bronze on 388.246.
</P>
<P>
The Americans, trailed the Russia by 0.187 after Sunday's
compulsory rotations, burst ahead by 0.472 points after the first
optional rotation when they collected 49.037 on the uneven bars
while the Russia was awarded only 48.474 from the vault.
</P>
<P>
A partisan home crowd inspired the American women to retain
their top form in the next two apparatus, enabling them to lead
all the way with no less than 48.899 from the beam and the floor
while the highest scores for Russia were 48.874 from the uneven
bars and beam.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the dramatic moments came when Dominique Moceanu sitted
flat-footed on the ground twice in her two attempts on the vault
and it was Strug Kerri who stood out as the last American along
the runway.
</P>
<P>
In her first jump, Kerris also fell backward to sit on the mat
with her left ankle sprained.
</P>
<P>
Kerris insisted on her second chance to score 9.712 points with
a steady standing at the sacrifice of her injuried leg to anchor
the American victory.
</P>
<P>
China moved up to the fourth place with 385.867 points after
the Ukrainians, led China by 0.375 after the compulsories, dropped
to the fifth in 385.847 due to their poor performances in
optionals.
</P>
<P>
However, Ukrainian Lilia Podkopayeva, current world champion,
savored the top spot in the individual standings with 78.061,
chased by two-time Olympian veteran Shannon Miller of the United
States in 78.028 and Rrussian Dina Kochetkova with 77.986.
</P>
<P>
The women's all-around finals are scheduled on Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Thai Shrimp Exporters Urge EU to Amend New Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Thai shrimp exporters have joined
their counterparts in other Asian countries to urge the European
Union to amend its new regulations on shrimp imports.
</P>
<P>
The EU announced that as of September 29, shrimp exporters must
lower the percentage of benzoic acid used to preserve frozen
boiled shrimps from the current level of 0.6 percent to only 0.2
percent.
</P>
<P>
However, shrimp exporters operating out of the North sea and
Mediterranean countries will be allowed to maintain a benzoic acid
concentration of 0.6 percent for their shrimp products.
</P>
<P>
The move is seen as a new technical and non-tariff barrier
against Asian shrimp products.
</P>
<P>
The EU ruling would directly affect Thai frozen boiled shrimp
exports, worth 22 million U.S. dollars per year, and it could also
indirectly extend to the export of frozen fresh shrimps used as
raw material in the production of finished products.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Denies Reported Liquidation of Private Banks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A senior Myanmar official has
refuted reports about possible liquidation of some private banks
in the country, which had led to an unexpected slump of the
Myanmar kyat against the U.S. dollar earlier this month, the
official New Light of Myanmar reported today.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Finance and Revenue Brig. Gen. Win Tin was quoted
as saying that "widespread rumors" were responsible for the
current confusion on the country's open foreign exchange market,
where the kyat fell sharply to 170 to one U.S. dollar from 120 to
one.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the government's consistent finance and monetary
policy here Tuesday at an inauguration ceremony of the
International Banking Department of the Myanmar May Flower Bank,
one of the leading private banks in the country.
</P>
<P>
He urged customers not to withdraw their money from banks and
accused "destructive elements" of inventing rumors in an attempt
to wreck the entire private banking sector.
</P>
<P>
The minister called for confidence in the country's private
banks and promised that the Central Bank of Myanmar will not allow
any local bank to lose its balance.
</P>
<P>
According to latest official statistics, the government has so
far permitted 20 private banks to operate in the country while 39
foreign banks have opened representative offices by the end of
March this year.

<HEADLINE> Heyns, Loader Doubles Their Olympic Gold Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's magic girl Penelope
Heyns proved that she was the current best female breaststroker in
the world by claiming the 200-meter title here on Tuesday, her
second gold at the ongoing Games.
</P>
<P>
Heyns, 21, led all the way to snatch the laurel with another
Olympic Games record time of 2:25.41.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this morning, she bettered the previous Olympic mark by
0.02 seconds and in the evening's final, she shortened her fresh
record by 0.22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
"I knew I had a good chance to win the 100 meters. As to the
200-meter race, I didn't really know what to expect." she said,
"obviously, it means a great deal to me to bring home two gold
medals."
</P>
<P>
Amanda Beard of the United States, with a late start, reduced
the gap in the final sprint, but had to settle for the silver. She
was followed by Agnes Kovacs, a 14-year-old girl from Hungary.
</P>
<P>
Samantha Riley of Australia came in a diappointing fourth.
</P>
<P>
It was also a brilliant day for Danyon Loader.
</P>
<P>
The New Zealander also celebrated his second gold after
grabbing the men's 400-meter freestyle crown.
</P>
<P>
Loader, bronze medalist at the Rome World Championships in 1994
and world No.2-ranked in the event, stormed back in the last 100
meters and clocked a winning time of three minutes 47.97 seconds.
</P>
<P>
He also won the men's 200m free on the first day competitions.
He was fourth in this morning's heats.
</P>
<P>
Asked if his first gold medal had given him more pressure, he
answered:"Not at all, I knew that I had a couple of more races to
go."
</P>
<P>
Paul Palmer of Britain was second, followed by Daniel Kowalski,
who edged Kieren Perkins, world record holder in the event, at the
Australian Trials.
</P>
<P>
The little-known Briton said that he was not surprised by the
results:"I trained hard in the past year."
</P>
<P>
It was also a big day for the hosts team, which took three more
golds, extending swimming gold tally to seven.
</P>
<P>
As expected, world record holder Jeff Rouse of the United
States added another gold for the hosts in the men's 100m
backstroke.
</P>
<P>
The world No.1 swimmer in the 100m back, top finisher in this
morning's heats, met no further troulbe to beat his rivals with a
time of 54.10, 0.24 seconds slower than his own world mark set at
the Barcelona Games four years ago.
</P>
<P>
Two Cuban backstrokers raised many eyebrows, adding one silver
and one bronze to their country.
</P>
<P>
Rodolfo Falcon, silver medalist in 200m and bronze medalist in
100m back at the Pan Pacific Championships in 1995 here, was
second, just ahead of his teammate Neisser Bent.
</P>
<P>
World Champion Martin Lopez-Zubero of Spain, 27, only managed
fourth.
</P>
<P>
Amy Van Dyken of the United States, 23, chalked up the women's
100m butterfly title, her first individual Olympic title, after a
exciting and fierce final.
</P>
<P>
Her winning time of 59.14 was just 0.01 seconds quicker than
the second-placed world champion Liu Limin of China.
</P>
<P>
Angel Martino, who led the eight qualifiers into evening's
final, came in third at 59.23.
</P>
<P>
Pre-race favourite Ayari Aoyama of Japan, who scored the year's
best mark, led at the turn but slowed down to finish a modest
fourth.
</P>
<P>
The American quartet dominated in the men's 4X100 meters
freestyle relay, beating their long-time rivals Russia into the
second place.

<HEADLINE> China Reiterates Position on Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Ambassador to the
United Nations Qin Huasun today refuted Nicaragua and a very small
number of other countries on the question of the so-called
Taiwan's "representation" at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
In a letter addressed to U.N. Secretary General Boutros
Boutros-Ghali, the Chinese permanent representative noted that the
letter and its annexes to the U.N. chief by Nicaragua and a very
small number of other countries on July 17 distorted facts in an
attempt to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan."
</P>
<P>
"This not only constitutes a serious encroachment upon China's
sovereignty and a gross interference in its internal affairs, but
also gravely contravenes the purpose and principles of the
U.N. Charter and Resolution 2758 of the General Assembly," he said.
</P>
<P>
The General Assembly adopted by an overwhelming majority the
historically significant Resolution 2758 at its 26th session 25
years ago, which restored all the lawful rights of the People's
Republic of China at the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
However, since 1993, Nicaragua and a very small number of other
countries bought over by the Taiwanese authorities have attempted
to mislead the General Assembly to a consideration of the question
of the so-called Taiwan's "representation".
</P>
<P>
"If Nicaragua and some other countries continue to cling
obstinately to their erroneous course and position, they will
undoubtedly come to the same end and pay their own price for it,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
It is the strong aspiration and unshakable will of the entire
Chinese people and the Taiwan compatriots to end the state of
separation and accomplish the grand cause of national
reunification of China, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that Taiwan has been an inalienable part of China
since ancient times and the question of Taiwan is the internal
affairs of China which must be settled by the Chinese people
themselves.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Armen Nazaryan gave the former
Soviet republic of Armenia its first Olympic gold medal when he
defeated American Brandon Paulson in the 52kg class of the
Greco-Roman final at the Atlanta Olympic Games here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Although the Armenian began to slow halfway through the
five-minute bout, he had already built up a five-point lead with a
series of opportunistic moves.
</P>
<P>
Russian superheavyweight Aleksandr Karelin captured his third
successive Olympic gold after struggling to outpoint fired-up
American Matt Ghaffari in the 130kg class.
</P>
<P>
The Russian, unbeaten in international competition since 1987
and who has six straight world titles under his belt, scored an
early technical point to lead the American.
</P>
<P>
But he never managed to produce any of his trademark body lifts
and had to survive three minutes of gruelling extra time against
an older but more energetic opponent.
</P>
<P>
Wlodzimierz Zawadski of Poland produced one of the most
impressive rollovers of the afternoon to beat Cuba's Juan Luis
Maren Delis in the 62-kg class.
</P>
<P>
The second Polish finalist, Jacek Fafinski, was comprehensively
out-fought and out-pointed by Vyacheslav Oleynyk of Ukraine in the
90-kg light-heavyweight division.
</P>
<P>
In the 74-kg welterweight division Feliberto Ascuy Aguilera of
Cuba won gold with victory over Finland's Marko Asell.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Cuba's economy grew by 9.6 percent
in the first half of this year and continued to maintain a trend
to recovery, said the State Council's vice-president today.
</P>
<P>
Carlos Lage, who is also executive secretary of the Council of
Ministers, said Cuba achieved the growth in spite of the
U.S. Helms-Burton Bill, and under unfavorable tariff conditions in
the international market.
</P>
<P>
The Helms-Burton Bill had caused more problems for the United
States than for Cuba, he said in a report on the island's economy
at the International Press Center in Havana.
</P>
<P>
The vice-president said the gross domestic product (GDP) was
expected to increase by five percent by the year's end due to the
good performance of diverse sectors, and exports.
</P>
<P>
The industrial sector grew by 10 percent and the agriculture
sector by 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Sugar production reached 4.445 million tons, an increase of
33.6 percent while tourism, a generator of hard currencies for
this country, grew by 46 percent.
</P>
<P>
As for trade, Lage said that Cuban exports increased by 30
percent in the first half of the year.
</P>
<P>
He said Cuba's economy still faced a shortage of hard
currencies, the need for improving internal finances and a 10
percent increase in fuel consumption demands.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Shore Up Rubber Prices in Low Season </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Thai government has decided to
shore up rubber prices during the mid-year low season this year
with an allocation of 3 billion baht (120 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The money, borrowed from the Krung Thai bank, will be used to
buy rubber sheets from cooperatives and the local rubber markets
during the summer months.
</P>
<P>
Rubber prices usually drop during June to September each year,
as demand falls.
</P>
<P>
This year the government will hold the price of rubber sheets
during the low season at 29 to 30 baht (about 1.16 to 1.2 dollars)
per kilogram.
</P>
<P>
The US and Japan account for 60 percent of the Thai rubber
sales. China is also a big buyer.

<HEADLINE> Euro Disney's Profit Falls to 29.4 Million Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Theme park operator Euro Disney SCA
said today it made a net profit of 147 million francs (29.4
million U.S. dollars) in the fiscal third quarter, down from 170
million francs (34 million dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
But last year's figure included an exceptional gain of 79
million francs (15.8 million dollars) from the purchase of
convertible bonds issued by the company.
</P>
<P>
The third quarter performance helped reduce net losses in the
first nine months of the fiscal year by 69 percent to 22 million
francs (4.4 million dollars) from 71 million francs (14.2 million
dollars) in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
The third quarter sales rose 4.5 percent to 1.42 billion francs
(284 million dollars) while operating profit soared 60 percent to
146 million francs (29.2 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
"We are satisfied with the results, which are in line with the
company's restructuring plans," said a Euro Disney spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The company believed the increase related to last year's
launching of one of its key attractions, the "Space Mountain" ride.
</P>
<P>
The company, 39 percent owned by the The Walt Disney Co.,
opened its amusement park outside Paris in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Manila, Washington Settle Textile Row </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine government has
decided to withdraw a complaint it filed against the United States
before the World Trade Organization (WTO) after Washington agreed
to give "an adjustment and compensation package" to cushion the
impact of the marks-of-origin rules affecting Manila's garment
exports, the Manila Times reported today.
</P>
<P>
The report quoted high-ranking sources as saying that
Philippine and U.S. negotiators forged a compromise deal last
Saturday after two days of intensive negotiations in Washington.
</P>
<P>
The compromise deal requires Manila to withdraw its trade
protest against Washington at the world trade body, and Washington
to provide "equitable adjustment and compensation" to the
Philippines, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the sources declined to disclose the amount of
compensation cited in the agreement and the mechanics for
implementing the adjustments.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, the package could help the Philippines
"avoid disruptions in its trading with the United States"
following the adoption of the marks-of-origin rules on July 1.
</P>
<P>
It is not clear if Washington agreed to recall or amend the
rules, though U.S. negotiators promised not to seize Philippine
garment exports that fail to meet the new requirements, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government had warned earlier that it would
pursue the country's complaint at the WTO unless Washington
commits to recalling the new rules.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, the U.S. Bureau of Customs could stop the
release of a shipment if an exporting country failed to secure the
export visa from a third country, which, however, generally
dislikes the idea of issuing export visas for their raw material
exports.
</P>
<P>
The Philippines relies mainly on imported fabrics to
manufacture its garments for export.
</P>
<P>
Garments, the Philippines' second largest export products,
earned the country 2.77 billion U.S. dollars last year. The
United States was the biggest market for these products.

<HEADLINE> Life In the Air For Flood-Fear Families (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, July 24 (xinhua) -- As floods sweep large areas of
China, people in one community look reassuringly at their town in
the air.
</P>
<P>
Officials in Laozhuangtai decided that their township would be
spared devastating floods after swollen rivers swept away most
homes in torrential rains some years ago.
</P>
<P>
So they built a series of platforms, on legs ten meters
high. During flooding townsfolk among the 7,000 population who
live at ground level can move to their special town in the sky --
there are houses, shops, even a school on the series of 111
platforms.
</P>
<P>
Public buildings, toilets and even roads are built, linking
the platforms.
</P>
<P>
Wang Hengfu, 63, never imagined there would be so many great
changes in his hometown of Laozhuangtai, a village in east China's
Anhui province. The area has become a flood storage zone for the
Huaihe River.
</P>
<P>
 "We farmers lived mainly on relief and donations," Wang said,
"but all that is now in our history."
</P>
<P>
Wangs and his family now have a four roomed tile-roofed house,
which has TV sets, bikes and a collection of furniture. The family
started the decade in a tiny thatched cottage, with no furniture
or any other belongings at all.
</P>
<P>
He is an average householder among the 7,000 households in
Laoguan Town, Funan county in Anhui province.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 70 percent of the households in the town
now have tile-roofed houses. The average income per person in the
town is more than 1,000 yuan.
</P>
<P>
Funan County, as a major flood storage zone for the Huaihe
River, suffered from serious flooding every two or three years in
the past, and was one of the poorest county in the province.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, one of the most severe floods washed away virtually
everything in the small township.
</P>
<P>
The local government spared no effort in helping local
residents to rebuild their destroyed homes.
</P>
<P>
The local government built the series of 111 platforms in
Laozhuangtai village to provide a safe haven for residents during
floods. On the 10-meter-high platforms are well-planned houses,
schools, roads, toilets and other public facilities.
</P>
<P>
The previous dirt roads have now been replaced by properly
made-up concrete roads.

<P>
The Huaihe River, flowing through Henan, Anhui, Shandong and
Jiangsu provinces, experiences frequent floods. To keep the losses
of flood damage to the minimum, China divided areas along the
river into 17 flood storage zones, covering 30 billion cubic
meters.
</P>
<P>
Since 1991, the central government has spent 10 billion yuan
harnessing the river, and improving the living livelihood of
residents in the flood storage zones.
</P>
<P>
Over the past five years, 4.6 billion yuan has been invested
constructing 13 water conservancy projects, such as diverting
water from the Huaihe to Yihe River, reinforcing dykes and dams
along the river.
</P>
<P>
The projects raised the flood-control capability of the river,
and the flood storage zones are only used for storing flood water
every five to seven years. Before large tracts of land were
flooded in every three to five years, either by design or by being
overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
The state also built more than 50 major irrigation and drainage
projects and power stations in the flood storage zones to improve
the farming conditions.
</P>
<P>
Wang has planted 0.33 ha of wheat this year and the output
reached 1,000 kg, up 35 percent over last year.
</P>
<P>
Rice can also be planted with the improved irrigation
facilities. Wang said.
</P>
<P>
China also worked out a series of preferential policies on
taxes and funds for the residents in the zones.
</P>
<P>
Through the efforts, some 10 counties in the flood storage
zones along the river have bid farewell to poverty. In some of
these counties, the residents' living standards even overtook the
provinces' average. In Laozhuangtai the townspeople are walking on
air when they think about their new improved lives.

<HEADLINE> Extortionist Threatens Supermarket Chain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
London, July 23 (Xinhua) -- An extortionist who is believed to
have targeted on of Britain's biggest banks with a bombing
campaign has switched to a supermarket chain, say police.
</P>
<P>
The extortionist wrote to J.Sainsbury PLC on July 10
threatening to bomb the company's stores unless he was given "a
considerable amount of money," Detective Superintendent John
Beadle told a press conference at Scotland Yard.
</P>
<P>
Police are sure this extortioner is the same one responsible
for a series bombings on Barclays Bank branches which began in
December 1994.
</P>
<P>
The Barclays criminal signed his messages "Mardi Gra." Police
refused to say whether the Sainsbury threatener did the same.
</P>
<P>
Police thought the risk of attacks on the the supermarket
stores was small, but the company said it was still going to
strengthen security measures.
</P>
<P>
Three people have been injured by bombs since the extortioner
began his bombing campaign against Barclays.
</P>
<P>
The criminal, believed to be living in south-east England, has
sent more than two dozen threatening devices to the bank.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Asian Games champion South Korea
stole the limelight by beating the Netherlands 3-1 in the Olympic
women's field hockey tournament here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Stung by a the 2-3 reverse against the U.S. on Monday, the
South Koreans lifted their game to outplay the Dutch.
</P>
<P>
After a goalless first half, the South Koreans struck gold when
veteran Chang Eun-Jung banged in the first goal in the 41st
minute.
</P>
<P>
Penalty corner specialist Cho Eun-Jung made it 2-0 in the 51st,
before Wietske De Ruiter pulled one back for the Dutch a minute
later with another penalty corner.
</P>
<P>
Chang Eun-Jung capped a fine performance with her second goal
-- a rasping penalty corner drive -- seven minutes before the end.
</P>
<P>
The defeat left the Dutch, gold medallists at Los Angeles in
1984, with just two points from three matches and little hope of
qualifying for the final.
</P>
<P>
Britain outplayed the United States 1-0 for their first win in
the eight-nation round-robin league.
</P>
<P>
A win for the American team would have put them in second place
behind Australia and in line for a finish among the top two to
play the final.
</P>
<P>
Instead, the Americans and Britain were tied with three points
after the first three rounds -- behind favorite Australia's six
points and Germany and South Korea's four each.
</P>
<P>
Britain, blanked 0-5 by the South Koreans and held to a 1-1
draw by the Netherlands, finally hit form with a 51st minute goal
by Rhona Simpson.

<P>
ATLANTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Liu Limin, world champion for both
the 100- and 200-meter butterfly events, was edged to the second
place with the smallest margin of 0.01 second at the 100-meter
race at the Centennial Olympics here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
American Amy van Dyken had a excellent start and held on to
take the title, her first ever Olympic gold in individual event.
</P>
<P>
"I have done my best," said the 20-year-old Liu, "In fact, I am
quite satisfied with the result."
</P>
<P>
"There was no problems in my physical form nor in my strokes,"
said Liu, gold medalist at the University Games in Fukuka, Japan,
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
"She really made an exellent performance today, both in the
heats and in the final," said her 37-year-old coach Zhao Ge, who
began to train Liu from September, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Asked if Liu started slow in the final, the coach said: "That's
not the point. In fact, She swam a personal best time of 28.03 in
her first 50 meters.
</P>
<P>
"She always does well in the final sprint, that is her style. "
Zhao said.
</P>
<P>
Liu said her failure was due to the "bad fortune".
</P>
<P>
Zhao said that he was not shocked by the mediocre performances
by the Chinese swimmers at the current Olympics, who have
collected only one gold and two silvers till now.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese Olympic squad is a combination of veteran swimmers
and the youngsters," said Zhao, "It's quite natural that the
novices gave poor show sometimes in the big tournaments,
especially at the Olympic Games."
</P>
<P>
Asked about the prospects about the next events, the women's
200m butterfly, in which she was fourth-ranked, Liu said that she
expected to do better.

<HEADLINE> Dunhuang Relics Beats Desert Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LANZHOU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The battle is finally being won
against the shifting sands at a world-famous cave site in China.
</P>
<P>
The problem sands in the Mogao Cave area are now 60 percent
less than a few years ago, a new report has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Mogao Cave lies in the suburbs of Dunhuang city, northwest
China's Gansu province. It has been designated by UNESCO as one of
the world's cultural heritages, and is famous for its splendid
frescoes and grand images of Buddha.
</P>
<P>
Dunhuang city, once flourishing in the ancient Tang dynasty,
has long suffered the threat of desertification. Many of its
famous strategic passes, like Yangguan, are now buried by sand.
</P>
<P>
The unique cultural relics in Dunhuang have long been under
threat from sandstorms. Every year about three to four thousand
cubic meters of sand are blown up and piled up in front of Mogao
Cave.
</P>
<P>
The Institute For Desert Research of the Chinese Academy of
Sciences, together with foreign colleagues, have made great
efforts during recent years to find an answer to the problem.
</P>
<P>
Based on the area's natural environment, the scientists finally
drew up a plan to prevent the cultural relics from being enveloped
by sandstorms.
</P>
<P>
The plan is a combination of engineering, chemical, and
biological measures.
</P>
<P>
Now around the cave area, three rows of nylon barriers, with a
total length of 3.2 kilometers, have been built to hinder the
sandstorms. A plant belt has already be formed. Some chemical
measures are also being taken to prevent the sand from drifting.
</P>
<P>
In addition, in front of the cave, a new forest with plants
able to withstand the environment is also playing a role in
fighting the encroachment of the sand.
</P>
<P>
"With these four barriers, the devil of the sandstorms are now
well under control", the report says.

<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet has approved an
increase in excise duties on three categories of luxury goods as a
new bid to alleviate the country's current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
According to the government house, the excise duty will be
raised from 5 percent to 50 percent for yachts, 20 percent to 40
percent for wine and champagne, and zero to 20 percent for
carpets.
</P>
<P>
The new move by the Thai government is part of the effort to
reduce domestic consumption of luxury goods, most imported items,
to help ease the country's current account deficit.
</P>
<P>
Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa Tuesday appeared on
local television, wearing a locally-made necktie, instead of his
French-made one, to encourage Thais to buy Thai goods.
</P>
<P>
All cabinet ministers reportedly also received a locally-made
necktie carrying Banharn's signature at the cabinet's weekly
meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Both China and the United States
kept their winning streaks intact and secured their outings to the
semifinals of the women's soccer Olympic tournament with victories
on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
China trounced Denmark 5-1 after its first win of Sweden 2-0
two days ago, while the host also kept undefeated by downing
Sweden 2-1 on Tuesday for a 2-0 clean slate in Group E.
</P>
<P>
While both China and the United States secured their spots in
the last four, both Denmark and Sweden became outsiders of the
tournament.
</P>
<P>
Shi Guihong put China ahead in the 10th minute before Liu
Ailing made it 2-0 four minutes later.
</P>
<P>
Fifteen minutes later, Sun Qingmei netted the third for China
from a cross off Shi Guihong, and Fan Yunjie made her Danish peers
to cherish no more hope of a renaissance with the fourth goal
netted from a rebound in the 36th minute.
</P>
<P>

In Birmingham, Alabama, Brazilian Katia scored a late goal off
a chip from Fanta in the 68th minute to break the scoreless tie
and Pretinha made 2-0 with her header in the 87th minute.

midfielder star Heidi Stoere who injuried her knee ligament,
restored its confidence through a 3-2 victory over Germany.
</P>

With the opener being tied 2-2 against Brazil two days earlier,
Hege Riise scored her 22-meter free kick in the 66th minute to
break the deadlock for their deadly-needed victory.

</P>
<P>
ASEAN has attached great importance to developing cooperation
with its dialogue partners, said Alatas, chairman of the
just-ended 29th ASEAN Ministerial Meeting (AMM), at the opening
ceremony of the Post Ministerial Conference (PMC) of the AMM.
</P>

technology and market access for ASEAN products.
</P>
<P>
"If we continue to base the dialogue partnership on genuine
interdependence, mutual interest and benefit and equitable sharing
of responsibility, we will succeed in strengthening peace,
stability and prosperity not only in this region but also in the
world at large," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that dialogue itself has greatly added to the value of
ASEAN's endeavors as it has, through decades, facilitated
cooperation with some of the most important countries in the world
in various areas of common interest.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China's State Council, the
country's highest governing body, has announced the establishment
of Hengshui City, in north China's Hebei Province.
</P>
<P>
The promotion of Hengshui to the city league table recognizes
the city's location as the first hub station on the northern
section of Beijing-Kowloon railway, a crucial transport artery
from north to south in China.
</P>
<P>
A rail line from Shijiazhuang, Hebei's capital, to Dezhou, in
east China's Shandong Province, also passes there.
</P>
<P>
The two railways link Hengshui with large cities of Beijing,
Tianjin, and Shijiazhuang, bringing an economic boom to the
prefecture in the past few years, and providing ideal environment
for investors in the future.
</P>
<P>
Hengshui's industrial added value increased from two billion
yuan in 1990 to nearly seven billion yuan last year, representing
an annual growth rate of 30 percent.
</P>
<P>
It is already reporting the fastest industrial development in
Hebei, with the pillar industries of chemicals, textiles, light
industry, machinery, building materials, food, and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Since China launched the reform and opening-up drive in 1979,
Hengshui has set up a total of 257 foreign-funded enterprises,
with counterparts from more than 50 countries and regions in the
world.
</P>
<P>
"Hengshui as a prefecture has not been able to cater to the
economic expansion in recent years," an official commented.
</P>
<P>
Hengshui has a history of more than 1,400 years, but the
Hengshui Prefecture was only established after the founding of the
People's Republic of China in 1949, while the status of the
Hengshui city just equals a county.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A Chinese airline has made a
prize catch - by cashing in on a craving for eels by fish loving
Japanese.
</P>
<P>
Tons of eels are being flown daily from China to Japan during
the summer months.
</P>
<P>
The flying seafood specials reached a high today - July 24 - as
the Japanese celebrated its annual Eel Festival.
</P>
<P>
Eels are very popular as a health care food among Japanese
these years, with sales peaking in July because of the country's
eels festival.
</P>
<P>
South China Airlines has seized this opportunity to land a
slice of business.
</P>
<P>
Last month, 180 tons of eels were flown by the airline from
Guangzhou, capital of south China's Guangdong Province, to Osaka
in Japan, with each flight carrying 15 tons of the fish.
</P>
<P>
This month at least 250 tons of eels are being airlifted to
Japan, officials in the cargo transportation department at the
airline said.
</P>
<P>
To ship more fish the airline has replaced Boeing 757s with
larger Boeing 767s.
</P>
<P>
It also sent airline staff to collect eels from the fish
production bases, and cooperated with the port city of Xiamen in
transportation.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Host the United States reaped five
gold medals Tuesday to emerge on top of the medal table of the
26th Olympic Games here with a total of nine gold, 12 silver and
three bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
Monday's leader Russia was edged into the second place with the
same number of golds but less other medals (five silvers and two
bronzes).
</P>
<P>
The host's gold haul mainly came from the swimming pool which
contributed three in the men's 100m backstroke, 100m butterfly and
men's 4x100m freestyle relay. The two other golds were collected
from the women's double trap shooting and women's team gymnastics.
</P>
<P>
Poland, China and France remained in their third to fifth
positions by winning at least one gold medal each.
</P>
<P>
Armenia got its first ever Olympic gold when Armen Nazaryan won
from American Brandon Paulson to claim the Greco-Roman wrestling
52kg title this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Through wrestling, Ukraine and Cuba also bagged one gold medal
each.
</P>
<P>
Poland asserted its position in the Greco-Roman wrestling by
winning three titles out of the ten at stake over a period of
three days. Poland is now third in the medal table with five gold,
two silver and one bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
World records again fell in the weightlifting arena when
China's Zhan Xugang snatched 162.5 kilograms and then jerked 195
kilograms for a total of 372.5 kilograms in the 70kg category,
revamping all the three world marks set by Kim Young-Nam of the
Democratic People's Republic of korea in April.
</P>
<P>
Kim won his country's first silver medal in the current Games
in his specialty with a two-lift total of 345 kilograms.
</P>
<P>
Britain and Finland each earned one silver while Moldova and
Georgia got one bronze each, their first ever medals at this
Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Two more double gold medallists emerged in the swimming pool
this evening. Danyon Loader of New Zealand secured his second
title in the men's 400m freestyle after the 200m freestyle gold he
won Saturday. Minutes later, Penelope Heyns of South Africa came
first in the women's 200m breaststroke final, having won the 100m
event Sunday.
</P>
<P>
America's supremacy in the swimming pool was seriously
challenged by others. Notable among them are Ireland, New Zealand,
South Africa as well as Cuba which collected one silver and one
bronze medal in the men's 100m backstroke, to the surprise of the
swimming world.
</P>
<P>
Japan started to exert its influence in the judo sport by
winning the women's 61kg crown and taking the men's 78kg silver.
</P>
<P>
Germany, regarded as a strong sporting power, has yet to win a
gold medal in the Games, so has Britain.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday will see 14 more gold medals awarded in the
equestrian sport, cycling, fencing, judo, gymnasatics, swimming,
shooting and weightlifting.

<HEADLINE> Croats Boycott Mostar City Council Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Bosnian Croats refused on Tuesday
to attend the first session of the city council of Mostar,
protesting what they called irregularities in the latest elections
on June 30.
</P>
<P>
The elections, aimed at re-creating a unified administration
over the city, gave 21 seats to a Muslim party coalition and 16 to
the Croatian Democratic Union (HDZ).
</P>
<P>
Citing election irregularities, HDZ said there were more votes
than registered voters, especially among oversea refugees who are
mostly Muslim.
</P>
<P>
It added its representatives will stay out of the new city
council until their appeal is heard by the constitutional court of
the Muslim-Croat federation.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring, Bosnian
President Alija Izetbegovic said that Croats' boycott has posed "a
dangerous precedent for the September elections" which are
required by the Dayton agreement to create common institutions for
the former warring factions.
</P>
<P>
He condemned the HDZ of introducing "the practice of not
recognizing election results which do not suit it".

<HEADLINE> Zhan Xugang Lifts Three World Records for Olympic Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- World champion Zhan Xugang of
China set three world records to win his first Olympic
weightlifting gold medal here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Zhan snatched 162.5 kilograms and jerked 195 kilograms for a
total of 357.5 in the 70-kg category, beating former world record
holder Kim Myong-Nam of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea
to second at 345, with 160 from snatch and 185 from jerk.
</P>
<P>
Attila Feri of Hungary was third at 340.
</P>
<P>
Zhan, who strode onto the world weightlifting arena at the last
world championships for his first world title, met little
challenge from Kim, who had been picked up as the hot favourite
for the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
The 22-year-old Chinese titan started his training in the sport
11 years ago when he lifted stone stools for fun day after day.
</P>
<P>
With the time going on, he was selected to the Zhejiang
Provincial team and began full training in weightlifting. But it
was not until the year 1993 when he won three titles at the world
junior championships could he be regarded as one of the promising
lifters in China.
</P>
<P>
In the following year, he continued to shine on international
arena, winning the Asian Games and the junior worlds.
</P>
<P>
His fortune came in the year 1995 when he defeated former world
recorder holder and world gold medalist Fedail Guler of Turkey en
route to becoming the overall world champion.
</P>
<P>
"After the world championships, I have focused my eyes on the
Olympic Games," Zhan Xugang said.
</P>
<P>
"With the help of my coach Yang Hanxiong, I have fulfilled my
dream," he added.
</P>
<P>
Jeno Boskovics, spokesman of the International Weightlifting
Federation, highly praised Zhan's performance at the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
"When he won the world championships last year, many believed it
was on the home soil that he could win the world champion," Boskovics
said. "But this time, he proved with three world records and Olympic
title that he is the best lifter in his category."

<HEADLINE> North China City Imposes 'Sin Tax' On Unmarried Couples </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Tianjin, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The city of Tianjin has imposed
a 'sin tax' on couples living together without being legally
married.
</P>
<P>
Co-habiting couples can be fined up to 1,000 yuan (about 120
US dollars) if their marriages are not properly registered.
</P>
<P>
The city has introduced a new local code ordering couples to
re-register with the proper authorities, or be fined up to 1,000
Yuan.
</P>
<P>
Described as China's first local code to punish illegal
marriages, the Tianjin Marriage Management Code also brings in new
regulations on cupid clubs who arrange marriage partners.
</P>
<P>
The code stipulates that marriage-partner introduction agencies
must get approval from the marriage registering authorities, and
apply for business licenses to related industrial and commercial
administrative department.
</P>
<P>
Until now most of the marriage-partner introduction agencies in
Tianjin were free from any controls, and run without business
licenses.
</P>
<P>
According to the newly issued local code, foreign
marriage-partner introduction business is forbidden.
</P>
<P>
The new code also includes some regulations on application for,
and investigations of divorce.
</P>
<P>
"We have seen a declining trend of marriage registering, so the
code is aimed to putting marriage management on a legal track,"
said Wang Xuefu, director of the Municipal Marriage Management
Division of Tianjin Civil Administration Bureau.

<HEADLINE> Legend Joins Hands With US Bay Network </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Legend Technology Ltd. announced
on Tuesday the beginning of its co-operation with the US computer
network producer Bay Networks.
</P>
<P>
Legend Technology is now the value-added distributor of Bay in
China, "China Daily" quoted Tsang Kam To, a regional manager from
Legend Technology's Beijing office, as saying.
</P>
<P>
The co-operative target will be the growing network market in
China's financial sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
Legend Technology is a member of the hongkong-based legend
Holdings Co, of which the beijing-based Legend Group holds the
biggest share.
</P>
<P>
Tsang said his company will exploit Legend's existing marketing
and service networks to promote Bay's products in China by
providing technology support, post-sales service and system
integration.
</P>
<P>
The Legend-Bay partnership just developed a banking enterprise
network, which will debut at a banking technology and equipment
exhibition to be held by the People's Bank of China at the end of
July.
</P>
<P>
The wide-area network (WAN) solution, which runs data
communication and processing within a banking enterprise, connects

<HEADLINE> 50,000 Foreigners Reside Illegally in Honduras </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEGUCIGALPA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The Honduran authorities say
about 50,000 foreigners are living illegally in Honduras after
fraudently obtaining Honduran identification.
</P>
<P>
Hermes Rosa Bautista, director of the Office of Identities,
said today that 35,000 Nicaraguans and Salvadorans are registered
as Hondurans and have voted in presidential elections.
</P>
<P>
Their naturalizations had been obtained through application
for "replacement" birth certificates, according to figures from
the Honduran National Registry's complex computerized system.
</P>
<P>
An investigation would be carried out in courts throughout the
country before the deportation of these foreigners.
</P>
<P>
Nicaraguans and Salvadorans as well as thousands of oriental
people live illegally in Honduras enabled by legislation passed by
former President Rafael Callejas in December 1990.

<HEADLINE> China to Build 2,000 Baby-Friendly Hospitals in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- China is expected to build another
2,000 baby-friendly hospitals this year, in an effort to raise the
infant breast-feeding rate and reduce the infant mortality rate.
</P>
<P>
China has established 2,957 baby-friendly hospitals by the end
of 1995.
</P>
<P>
Wang Fenglan, department director in charge of maternal and
child health at the Ministry of Health (MOH) said her ministry had
drifted a national program, requiring the setting up of
baby-friendly hospitals and departments in all hospitals above
country level during the next five years.
</P>
<P>
Today's China Daily quoted the official as saying that the
national goal is to raise the infant breast-feeding rate from the
current 64.4 percent to over 80 percent by the year of 2,000.
</P>
<P>
The Baby-Friendly Hospital Initiative, a joint endeavor of the
United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) and World Health
Organization (WHO), is aimed at encouraging hospitals to promote
breast-feeding exclusively, through specific practices as
rooming-in and refusing the use of breast-milk substitutes.
</P>
<P>
Since the program was launched in 1992, it was embraced by 171
countries and the global figure of the baby-friendly hospitals has
so far reached 7,779.

<HEADLINE> Japan Upsets Olympic Runner-up China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Aki Ichijo scored two free throws
with eight seconds left to help Japan earn a 75-72 victory over
Barcelona Olympic runner-up China in the Atlanta Olympic women's
basketball tournament here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Fielding players all under 1.83 meters on court, Japan rallied
back from a 39-50 deficit at the 17th minute and snatched a 71-70
lead with two minutes remaining on a basket by Mikiko Hagimawa.
</P>
<P>
However, the Chinese, who led the first half at 42-35, answered
with a layup by Zheng Haixia, but Hagiwara's basket with 55
seconds left gave Japan the lead for good.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, runner-up at the 1994 world championship,
regained the lead on its next possession. 2.04-meter Zheng Haixia
missed a short hook. When Hagiwra grabbed the rebound, the
Chinese, who had accumulated only three team fouls, were forced to
use up five fouls quickly. The final one put Ichijo at the line.
</P>
<P>
Hagiwara led the Japanese, who lost to Russia in their opening
match Sunday by 10 points, with 23 points. China was headed by
Zheng Haixia with 31 points, including 21 points in the first
half.
</P>
<P>
"When they passed ball to her (Zheng Haixia), it was difficult
to stop her," said Japan's center Noriko Hamaguchi. "We did a good
job with three players surrounding her when she got the ball
inside."
</P>
<P>
Asked how difficult it was when shen was double or triple
teamed, Zheng Haixia said: "It certainly effected my play,
especially in the second half. It wore on me both psychologically
and physically."
</P>
<P>
Chinese coach Chen Daohong said: "the Japanese played very well
in defense, especially in the second half."
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team, with two defeats in the group, will meet
Canada on Thursday and Japan takes on Brazil.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Passes Welfare Reform Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Senate Tuesday
approved a welfare bill designed to reverse six decades of
national policy automatically entitling the poor to open-ended
assistance, limiting most families to no more than five years in
getting aid.
</P>
<P>
The vote was 74-24. Democrats split their votes, 23 for and 23
against, while 51 Republicans voted for the measure and one voted
against it.
</P>
<P>
President Bill Clinton, who vetoed two previous welfare bills
passed by the Republican-controlled Congress, welcomed the Senate
modification of the bill, but said he wanted more.
</P>
<P>
"They adopted two good amendments, and I applaud them for doing
it," media reports quoted Clinton as saying during a campaign stop
in Sacramento, California. "I want to keep working with them and
see if we can all agree on something that is acceptable."
</P>
<P>
But he said he was still "concerned about the impact of some
of the provisions of this on children."
</P>
<P>
In their key provisions, both the House bill, passed last
Thursday, and the Senate version would limit lifetime welfare
assistance to five years per family and require adult recipients
to work after two years.
</P>
<P>
But 20 percent of the families could qualify for hardship
exemptions from the time limits. Four major welfare programs would
be converted into block grants to states, which would have far more
freedom to run their own programs.
</P>
<P>
In a key vote, the Senate agreed 97-2 to ensure that the poor
maintain their current eligibility for Medicaid.
</P>
<P>
Welfare reform is popular among voters and Clinton campaigned in
1992 on a promise to "end welfare as we know it."
</P>
<P>
Republican leaders have said they expect to resolve differences
between the House and Senate bills and send the legislation to
Clinton before their August recess.

<HEADLINE> Nationwide "Dengue Alert" Raised in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 24 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Department of Health
has raised a nationwide "dengue alert" following a rise in dengue
fever cases in the country, particularly in Metro Manila, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Health Secretary Carmencita N. Reodica said that local
officials, non-government organizations and the public would be
mobilized in the elimination of breeding grounds of mosquitoes
that carry the dengue virus.
</P>
<P>
The number of confirmed dengue cases at hospitals in Metro
Manila climbed to 1,128 as of July 17, according to the Health
Department.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, President Fidel Ramos approved the declaration
as "calamity areas" of the national capital region, central Luzon
and southern Mindanao which have been affected by the outbreak of
dengue fever.

<HEADLINE> South Africa Ties Malaysia in Men's Hockey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 23 (Xinhua) -- William Fulton scored with a
sweeping shot in the 64th minute off the last of eight South
African penalty corners, rallying his country to a 2-2 draw with
Malaysia in the men's Olympic field hockey event on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
South Africa took the early lead on Greg Nicol's penalty corner
goal in the 26th minute, but had to rally after a pair of goals by
Mirnawan Nawawi in the second half.
</P>
<P>
Besides the eight penalty corners, South Africa played with a
two-man advantage for three minutes near the end of the first
half, and had another man advantage in the second half but could
not capitalize.
</P>
<P>
Nawawi tied it with a sliding deflection of a shot by Charles
David off a penalty corner in the 38th minute, and then put
Malaysia ahead in the 61st by taking a direct hit from Lim Chiow
Chuan and knocking it past South African goalkeeper Brian Myburgh.
</P>
<P>
South Africa (0-2-0), which tied pre-tournament favorite
Australia 1-1 on Sunday on a late goal by Nicol, had more than its
share of chances, particularly when Nawawi was yellow carded in
the 27th minute, and Chairil Abdul Aziz followed two minutes
later.
</P>
<P>
Aphthar Singh of Malaysia (0-1-1) also was yellow carded for
violent play in the 49th minute, a point Featherstone noted
afterward.

<HEADLINE> Journalists Explore Yangtze On Foot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- A team of young journalists from
central China's Hubei Province set out on foot Monday to report on
the development and culture in areas along the Yangtze River.
</P>
<P>
Their trek down the banks of the country's longest river, from
its source to its mouth at the sea -- a total of 6,300 km -- is
expected to take two or three years.
</P>
<P>
The journey is designed to popularize the Three Gorges Project,
reflect the traditions and customs of the Han nationality and
various ethnic minority groups who live on both banks of the
river, and raise public awareness of environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
After a ceremony held on Monday, the journalists left for the
source of the river on the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau.
</P>
<P>
According to the team of reporters, from this month through
December, their survey will focus on the issues of Hong Kong's
return to the motherland and the blocking of the Three Gorges dam.
</P>
<P>
The reporters said that they will file news stories, publish
books, and hold photography exhibitions to commemorate China's two
historic events of utmost significance, which will occur by the
end of the century.
</P>
<P>
An advance party of the journalists worked on the project from
last September through this January, which began at the source and
ended in Yibin in Sichuan Province, near the most dangerous
section of the river.
</P>
<P>
The project is said to signify that human beings have made
field surveys along the Yangtze River on foot for the first time.
</P>
<P>
Team members expressed their readiness to risk danger and
endure hardships to complete their task, and they said that their
actions will help inspire China's unremitting national spirit.
</P>
<P>
The source of the river was confirmed 20 years ago by a group
of adventurers as the Tanggula Mountain Range in Qinghai.

<P>
BEIJING, July 24 (Xinhua) -- More than half of China's 35
million telephones sold on the home market last year were produced
in the booming Pearl River Delta Area, south China's Guangdong
province, China's "People's Posts and Telecommunications News"
reported.
</P>
<P>
The paper says that the area has become the country's biggest
telephone production base with hard efforts made over the past few
years.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that China has over 300 telephone manufacturers
that have been allowed to enter the national telephone network,
and five of the country's top six telephone manufacturers are
located in the Pearl River Delta area.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the well-coordinated production system, which
is conducive to the reduction of production costs and the
promotion of work efficiency, has stimulated the development of
telecommunications equipment in the area.

<HEADLINE> Cooperative Rural Medical System Cares For Farmers' Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Farmer Qian Yufang was greatly
relieved when she got more than 10,000 yuan (1,200 US dollars)
from a rural village foundation to pay for the high medical costs
of her father's liver disease.
</P>
<P>
"Without support of the foundation, that large sum would become
a heavy burden to our family," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
Qian was one of the 3.2 million farmers, or 82 percent of the
total rural population living in the outskirtan areas of Shanghai
to benefit from the foundation, which constitutes part of a
nationwide rural cooperative medical system.
</P>
<P>
So far, the system has covered about 95 percent of the villages
in outskirtan areas of the east China metropolis, paying most of
the medical costs for 82 percent of the rural population.
</P>
<P>
China's rural cooperative medical insurance system experienced
a boom in the vast rural areas in the late 1960s, but was almost
abandoned in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Public Health recently announced that the
country will resume and rehabilitate the decade-old system by the
year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Under the system, farmers are allowed to pay premiums and only
a very small part of their medical costs. The collective pays the
rest; the state offers guidance and organization but little cash.
</P>
<P>
"We can no longer let farmers hold responsible for dealing with
serious diseases themselves; their incomes are too low," Health
Minister Chen Minzhang said last week at a national conference on
reviving the system.
</P>
<P>
In Qian's hometown, Songjiang County of Shanghai, the
cooperative medical foundation has been set up by the county and
township governments, township enterprises and farmers themselves.
</P>
<P>
In order to establish the funds, the county allocates 0.2
percent of its yearly budget, and the township government provides
two yuan per person annually. The enterprises put in two to four
percent of an employee's annual income, and farmers pay two to
three percent of their yearly income.
</P>
<P>
"That's a big sum of financial aid for us to provide to
farmers," said officials with the Songjiang County Public Health
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
About 170 million yuan was raised in Shanghai's rural areas
last year, which funded medical payments for its suburban farmers,
according to local officials.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong's Economy Develops Steadily </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 24 (Xinhua) -- Stable economic growth has been
reported in south China's Guangdong Province in the first half of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The province continued to strengthen macro-control in this
period, and the gross national product rose 9.7 percent over the
same period last year, statistics show.
</P>
<P>
Total industrial value generated by enterprises above the
county-level totalled 329.9 billion yuan (about 39.7 billion US
dollars), up 16 percent. The growth margin of the light industry
surpassed that of heavy industry.
</P>
<P>
During the period, 836,500 tons of grain were produced, up 1.8
percent. Production in animal husbandry and fishery have also
developed steadily.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the province invested 35.4 billion yuan
(about 4.3 billion US dollars) in capital construction and
renovation, maintaining the same level as last year.
</P>
<P>
Retail sales of consumption goods reached 118.8 billion yuan,
up 11.2 percent with adjustments for inflation. The growth rate
was slightly lower than that of the country's average.
</P>
<P>
Exports totalled 25.26 billion US dollars, down 5.6
percent. However, exports of joint ventures increased 21 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the January-July period, the province actually utilized 6.1
billion US dollars of foreign capital, up 6.3 percent over the
same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Amid the stable increase of supplies and the decrease of
demands, the growth margin of prices continued to fall. In this
period, retail prices throughout the province increased by 5.6
percent, with the growth margin falling 9.3 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
The main problems in the province's economic growth are the
poor circulation of money and reduced efficiency of enterprises.
</P>
<P>
By the end of May, profits in more than 30,000 enterprises with
independent accounting dropped 16.9 percent. Meanwhile, 26.4
percent of the enterprises in the province were in the red, up 2.1
percentage points from the same 1995 period.

<HEADLINE> Chile's Trade Surplus Drops to $367 Million </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Chile achieved only 367 million
U.S. dollars of trade surplus in the first half of this year, much
less than the 1.461 billion dollars reported for the same period
of 1995, said the Central Bank today.
</P>
<P>
The contraction of the surplus was due to a drop in the prices
of the country's main export products, copper in particular, and
to the increase of imports during the first four months of the
year, said the Bank.
</P>
<P>
In June, Chile's trade balance had a surplus of 4 million
dollars, resulting from the exports of 1.229 billion dollars and
the imports of 1.225 billion.
</P>
<P>
The Bank also said that as of July 15, its international
reserves totaled 14.836 billion dollars after dropping 18 million
due to balance-of-payments adjustments.

<P>
BELGRADE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Since the Yugoslav government
decided to set up operational headquarters for controlling the
foot-and-mouth disease a week ago, the Yugoslav army has been
engaged in the operation on all levels and in all tasks.
</P>
<P>
This was announced today by Yugoslav army general staff
officials who said all measures had been taken to prevent the
spread of the disease from the southern province of Kosovo to
other places.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav authorities are taking extensive measures to halt the
outbreak of the foot-and-mouth disease that was found two weeks
ago in the southern part of the country.
</P>
<P>
The highly infectious disease, which can also affect humans,
was first discovered in Kosovo, which is bordering Macedonia and
Albania. The foot-and-mouth disease broke out in these two
countries last month.
</P>
<P>
The army general staff officials said the army had stepped up
border security measures, especially in the areas which the
affected cattle can easily cross, and organized the monitoring and
control of the situation in the jeopardized regions in the
countryside, according to Tanjug news agency reports.
</P>
<P>
Teams on the ground have set up checkpoints at all border
crossings and elsewhere in the countryside, where they carry out
chemical and biological disinfection, the army officials said.

</P>
<P>
Kim Myong-Nam finished second with a total of 345kgs while
Attila Feri of Hungary came third with 340kgs.
</P>
<P>
Standing 1.70 meters in height, Zhan came from the coastal
Zhejiang province and is the tallest lifter in the light weight
categories in the country.
</P>
<P>
As a strongest weightlifter among China's strongmen, Zhan won
the gold medal of the 70kg class at the 67th world championships
in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, last november.
</P>
<P>
Before his appearance at the world competition level, Zhan
suffered an upset when he competed in Pusan, South Korea, last
July.
</P>
<P>
He asked for 193.5kgs for a new world jerk record and succeeded
in his attempt, but shortly, he was informed that he had broken
only an Asian record because less weight had been added to the
barbell.
</P>
<P>
At the Asian Championships in April this year, Zhan fulfilled
his dream by breaking the world snatch record with a lift of
160.5kgs.
</P>
<P>
At Atlanta Olympic Games, the Chinese strongman had his all
wishes fulfilled when he beat the world record holder Kim
Myong-Nam for the gold medal and also for three new world records.
</P>
<P>
"He showed excellent in skill today," said Chinese team leader
Liu Fengyan. "He just competed against himself in the
competition."
</P>
<P>
This is the second gold medal won by Chinese at the current
Olympics. Tang Lingsheng won the 59kg class title for China on
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> China Urges UN Agency to Improve Human Rights Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Chinese representative
urged here today the Commission on Human Rights to reduce
confrontation, expand cooperation, adopt universal standard, treat
human rights issue in a fair and comprehensive manner, and raise
efficiency in the field.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the 1996 substantive session of the Economic and
Social Council (ECOSOC) on the question of human rights,
Ambassador Wang Xuexian said the Chinese delegation could not but
express its regret over some abnormal phenomena existing in the
commission while affirming its progress.
</P>
<P>
"Human rights is an integral whole, in which all categories of
human rights are equally important. However, economic, social and
cultural rights still failed to be accorded the same attention at
this session of the commission as civil and political rights," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Only seven out of the 114 resolutions and decisions adopted by
the commission were exclusively dedicated to economic, social and
cultural rights, he noted.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, some countries, clinging to the "Cold War"
thinking and posing themselves as human rights judges, still
regarded other countries as their dependencies. They could name
more than 60 countries and accuse many developing countries of
poor human rights situation while they turned a blind eye to
violations of human rights in their own countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
In order to ensure the U.N.'s work in the field of human rights
to be carried out smoothly in the future, the Chinese delegation
urged the ECOSOC and the Commission on Human Rights to improve
their work in the following areas:
</P>
<P>
-- It is necessary to adhere to the purposes and principles of
the U.N. Charter and carry out international cooperation in the
field of human rights on the basis of equality and mutual respect.
Despite difference in political systems, levels of development,
cultural traditions and values, all countries should treat each
other as equals, respect each other, learn from each other's
strong points and get rid of "Cold War" thinking;
</P>
<P>
-- All human rights are universal, indivisible and
interdependent and interrelated. As the world poverty population
has amounted to 1.5 billion, the U.N. human rights bodies should
play an active role in eradication of poverty, take concrete
measures on the urgent and important issues of developing
countries and promote the realization of economic, social and
cultural rights and the right to development; and
</P>
<P>
-- Effective measures should be taken and necessary reforms
introduced to admit more developing countries into the commission
so as to raise efficiency, reduce overlapping and rationalize and
democratize the work of U.N. human rights bodies.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslav, Bosnian FMs Meet on Normalizing Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Citizens of Yugoslavia and the
Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation may travel freely from now on with
traveling documents issued by their relevant organs and without
any additional formalities.
</P>
<P>
This was agreed upon by Federal Republic of Yugoslavia Foreign
Minister Milan Milutinovic and his Muslim-Croat federation
counterpart, Jadranko Prlic, at their meeting held here today.
</P>
<P>
A business and political delegation of the Muslim-Croat
federation, headed by Vice-president Ejup Ganic, arrived here
early today for a two-day official visit, the first of its kind
since Bosnia-Herzegovina broke away from the former Yugoslavia
four and half years ago.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, the two sides voiced their readiness for
continued efforts towards a gradual normalization of bilateral
relations and assessed that the renewal of economic ties and
cooperation was in their mutual interests, the Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Until the Dayton agreement was signed last December, the two
parties had been technically at war.
</P>
<P>
The two ministers also underscored the significance of the
further full and consistent implementation of the Dayton peace
agreement.
</P>
<P>
They attached special importance to the creation of conditions
for holding free and fair elections in Bosnia to set up
constitutional organs in the country and in the two equal
entities, Tanjug said.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslav Foreign Minister Milutinovic stressed that the
competent Yugoslav organs had undertaken all measures necessary
for the refugees from Bosnia living in Yugoslavia to turn out at
the general elections in Bosnia on September 14.

<P>
NEW YORK, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Stocks on Wall Street continued
turning lower today, as technology shares slid for the third
straight session despite a strong profit report by Microsoft.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average lost 44.39 to 5,346.55. The
blue-chip barometer has so far slid for three straight sessions.
</P>
<P>
Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 7-to-3 margin on the
New York Stock Exchange, with its volume totaling 419.20 million
shares, up from 327.25 million in the previous session.
</P>
<P>
The NYSE's composite index fell 3.08 at 337.14, and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index fell 6.90 to 626.87.
</P>
<P>
The Nasdaq composite index fell 29.69 to 1,051.70, and the
American Stock Exchange's market value index declined 6.01 to
536.96.
</P>
<P>
Microsoft's report of a 52 percent jump in profits failed to
spur another wave of selling in the technology sector. And shares
of the software giant itself plunged.
</P>
<P>
Stocks also fell despite a sharp rally in the bond market that
sent the yield on the 30-year Treasury bond below 7 percent for
the second time in a week.

<HEADLINE> Milosevic Praises Yugoslavia-Bosnia Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Slobodan
Milosevic said today the establishment of economic cooperation
between Yugoslavia and the Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation was
important for an overall normalization of relations in the region.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic made the remarks at a meeting in Belgrade with a
business and political delegation of the Muslim-Croat federation,
headed by federation Vice-President Ejup Ganic.
</P>
<P>
The delegation arrived here earlier today on a two-day visit to
Yugoslavia, the first of its kind since Bosnia broke away from the
former Yugoslavia in early 1992.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed at the meeting that the end of the civil
war in Bosnia had enabled all potentials to focus now on economic
and cultural recovery and development and secured a constructive
settlement of all pending problems, according to a Yugoslav news
agency Tanjug report.
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia, composed of Serbia and Montenegro, had been
supporting Bosnian Serbs who fought a three-and-half-year war with
the Muslim-Croat federation until the Dayton agreement was signed
last December.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, both Milosevic and Ganic noted that the
agreements on the establishment of telephone, air, railway, road
and telecommunications links would not only allow a speedy
realization of expected business agreements, but also help create
conditions for free circulation of people, goods, information and
capital.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, the two sides signed an agreement on
normalization of trade, transport and telecommunications between
Yugoslavia and the federation. They also agreed to strengthen
links and cooperation between the two news agencies -- the Tanjug
news agency and BH Press.
</P>
<P>
"This is in the interests of global economic recovery of these
lands and it will allow a speedy return of refugees from
Yugoslavia to Bosnia and normalization of everyday life there,"
Tanjug said of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Both sides agreed that the normalization of trade, transport
and telecommunication links was the first step which should pave
the way for a continuous process of establishing cooperation
between Yugoslavia and Bosnia-Herzegovina, it said.

<HEADLINE> Chemical Residue Found on Bodies, TWA Jet Debris </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- A chemical residue has been
found on some victims' bodies and on debris recovered from the
crashed Boeing 747 of the Trans World Airlines (TWA), White
House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta said today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to
California, Panetta said evidence collected at the crash site
contained some "chemical leftovers" that the FBI wants to
scrutinize, according to an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
The chemical residues support the suggestion that the crash was
blasted by terrorists. But Panetta said, "The problem is until you
get the actual analysis, it's tough to come to that conclusion,
but clearly that's the area that they're looking at most closely."
</P>
<P>
Investigators have officially said they are not yet sure what
caused the plane to explode over the Atlantic shortly after
takeoff Wednesday night from the New York JFK International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
Panetta said President Clinton received a briefing from Federal
Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee Witt, who is in New
York as the president's representative with the investigators.
</P>
<P>
The White House chief of staff said some of the evidence
collected at the crash site has been shipped to the FBI lab in
Washington for analysis and investigators expect to have a result
from the FBI analysis within the next 24 to 48 hours, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Investigators and rescuers have recovered 109 bodies and some
large piece of the plane's debris. The USS Grasp, equipped with
high-tech tracking equipment and 23 additional divers, was at
the crash scene today.
</P>
<P>
The Navy is sending a new floating command post ship, the USS
Oak Hill, which is outfitted with helicopters and specialized
communications gear.
</P>
<P>
The FBI is also studying other possibilities in the explosion,
including a catastrophic mechanical failure or a surface-to-air
rocket attack, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Investigators have yet found the plane's voice and data
recorders, the so-called black boxes, which could provide key
evidence to the crash.

<P>
BELGRADE, July 23 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslav Vice Prime Minister
Nikola Sainovic and a business and political delegation from the
Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation held talks today on restoration of
economic ties and cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian Muslim-Croat federation delegation, headed by
Vice-president Ejup Ganic, arrived here today on a two-day
official visit, the first of its kind since Bosnia-Herzegovina
broke away from the former Yugoslavia in early 1992.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, both sides stressed the need to persist in
efforts to continue full implementation of the Dayton peace
agreement for Bosnia-Herzegovina so as to preserve positive
results which have already been achieved and create conditions for
a lasting peace and stability in the region, the Tanjug news
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Also today, President of the Serbian Chamber of Commerce Vlajko
Stojiljkovic met with the delegation of the Muslim-Croat
delegation over bilateral economic relations and cooperation which
were cut off after Bosnia gained independence from the former
Yugoslavia in the spring of 1992.
</P>
<P>
There are economic interests for restoring economic ties,
Stojiljkovic said, adding that "we had lived together for a long
time and developed business relations which can now be renewed and
upgraded after the restoration of peace."
</P>
<P>
He also said that Yugoslav companies were ready to take part in
the reconstruction of Bosnia-Herzegovina, which was devastated by
the three-and-half-year civil war.
</P>
<P>
Stojiljkovic urged a reconstruction of infrastructure systems,
primarily in the fields of transport and telecommunications which
would pave the way for a speedy signing of concrete business
arrangements.
</P>
<P>
Vice-president of the Chamber of Commerce of the Muslim-Croat
Federation Anto Domazet said at the meeting that the political
part of the delegation should prepare the institutional basis for
a restoration of bilateral economic cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said Yugoslav companies, especially in the field of civil
engineering, were fit to take part in the reconstruction of
Bosnia-Herzegovina and firms had already established contacts.

<HEADLINE> US Welcomes Bosnian Leader's Trip to Belgrade </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, July 23 (Xinhua) -- The United States today
welcomed a "very significant visit" by the Bosnian delegation to
the Serbian capital of Belgrade, saying it's an important step
toward normalizing relations between the two former Yugoslavia
republics.
</P>
<P>
The Bosnian delegation, headed by Ejup Ganic, vice-president of
the Bosnian Federation of Muslims and Croats, held talks earlier
today with Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic and other senior
Serb officials.
</P>
<P>
The talks were focused on logistics issues including opening up
of rail lines, roads and communications between the two republics,
according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
"We see this visit today by Vice President Ganic as a very
significant visit," U.S. State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns
told a press briefing here.
</P>
<P>
The visit came only days after a fresh mediation effort in the
former Yugoslavia by U.S. special peace envoy Richard Holbrooke
last week.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman disclosed that U.S. Ambassador to Bosnia John
Menzies and U.S. economic assistance coordinator Dick Sklar also
traveled to Belgrade for talks with Serb officials on economic
issues.
</P>
<P>
In addition to that, the United States today is also beginning
delivering the first equipment that will support the open
broadcast network in Bosnia, Burns said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the equipment is valued at 10 million U.S.
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government hopes that the network will be helpful to
the planned free and fair elections in Bosnia in mid-September,
Burns added.
