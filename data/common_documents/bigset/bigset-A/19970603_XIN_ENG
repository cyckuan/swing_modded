<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Trade Deficit Narrows in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 2 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's trade deficit in May
narrowed to 686 million U.S. dollars, the lowest level in 11
months, said the Ministry of Trade, Industry and Energy today.
</P>
<P>
The ministry officials attributed the deficit fall to an export
rise for the second consecutive month and a decline trend in
imports.
</P>
<P>
May exports rose 3.9 percent from a year ago to 11.67 billion
dollars on a custom-cleared basis.
</P>
<P>
Last month, semiconductor exports, which have been the main
reason behind the trade deficits, amounted to 1,493 million
dollars, an increase of 8.8 percent from a year ago, while
non-semiconductor exports also grew 3.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
The exporters should further step up efforts to enhance their
competitive edge, said Kim Dong-soo, director at the ministry's
export division
</P>
<P>
However, the five-month trade gap widened to 9,557 million
dollars, exceeding 68 percent of the projected 14 billion dollars
for the whole year, said the ministry.

<HEADLINE> US Construction Spending Declines in April </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (xinhua) -- Construction spending in the
U.S. dropped by 1 percent in April, the worst showing in this
year, the U.S. Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
The department said that construction spending in April totaled
a seasonally adjusted 596.9 billion dollars at an annual rate in
April, compared to a rate of 603.1 billion in March.
</P>
<P>
The 1 percent drop matched a similar decline in December and
was the biggest fall since a 1.1 percent decrease in May 1996.
</P>
<P>
The decline was led by a 2.6 percent drop in non-residential
commercial construction, the worst performance since a 3 percent
drop in December.
</P>
<P>
However, the residential construction edged up a slight 0.2
percent in April to an annual rate of 258.2 billion dollars, an
all-time high.
</P>
<P>
The spending on single-family construction also increased by
0.1 percent to a record 160.1 billion dollars. There was also a
gain in spending for remodeling and additions. These increases
helped offset a slight drop in apartment construction.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the weakness in commercial construction,
spending on government projects also fell in April, dropping by
1.8 percent to an annual rate of 146.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
It was the biggest setback since a 3.6 percent drop last
December. Spending for schools, conservation projects and water
treatment plants all fell during the month.

<HEADLINE> Chinese FM Meets With Latvian Foreign Ministry Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign
Minister Qian Qichen, meeting today with Maris Riekstinsh, State
Secretary of the Latvian Foreign Ministry, called Latvia an
important country in the Baltic region and said that China
attaches great importance to developing relations with it.
</P>
<P>
China is pleased with the fact that, after a difficult period,
its relations with Latvia have developed smoothly since they
were normalized in 1994, he said.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, there has been rapid progress in China, but it
needs to make a greater effort to reach the standard of
medium-developed countries, he said, and noted that saying China
will threaten other countries with its development is totally
groundless.
</P>
<P>
He said that no matter what their politics or economy, not
every country can have the same mode, and that every nation, big
or small, strong or weak, rich or poor, has equal rights to
participate in international affairs.
</P>
<P>
Riekstinsh said he appreciates China's achievements in its
reform and opening-up and reiterated that the Latvian
government will keep to its "one China" principle in the Taiwan
issue.
</P>
<P>
On trade and economic cooperation, both sides say that the two
governments are taking active steps to promote bilateral trade
and economic cooperation, including direct contacts between
Chinese and Latvian entrepreneurs.
</P>
<P>
Riekstinsh conveyed the regards of Latvian Foreign Minister
Valdis Birkvs to Qian, who asked Riekstinsh to extend his respects
to Birkvs and said that he is expecting him to visit China.
</P>
<P>
Riekstinsh and his party arrived in Beijing yesterday for a
five-day visit at the invitation of the Chinese Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Riekstinsh and Chinese Vice-Foreign Minister
Zhang Deguang held consultations on bilateral relations and
international issues of common concern.

<HEADLINE> Syria's Opening Borders With Iraq Undecided </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouq
al-Shara said today that whether to open borders between his
country and Iraq for trade is yet to be decided.
</P>
<P>
"No decision on this matter had been taken as yet," said Shara
before leaving for home at the end of a brief visit here today.
During their few-hour stay in Cairo, the foreign minister and
Syrian Vice President Abdel Halim Khaddam held talks with Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi side has reportedly taken measures to prepare for the
opening of borders to accommodate goods and items to be imported
from Syria.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi Trade Minister Mohammed Mehdi Saleh told a press
conference in Baghdad Sunday that an announcement on the opening
of the borders will be made soon, indicating improved ties between
the two countries since Baghdad severed ties with Damascus in 1980
when Syria sided with Iran in the 1980-88 Iran-Iraq War.
</P>
<P>
Before departure, Shara dismissed as untrue a report recently
published by the Israeli "Maariv" that Syria had given up its
insistence on Israel's full withdrawal from the Golan Heights,
captured by the Jewish state in 1967.
</P>
<P>
"Syria says that the issue of full withdrawal to the June 4
1967 lines is part of many elements that lead to full and just
peace in the region," he added.
</P>
<P>
Syria, an important partner in the Mideast peace process, began
negotiations with Israel in 1991. But the sporadic talks broke off
last February after a spate of suicidal bomb attacks in Israel
blamed on Palestinian extremists.
</P>
<P>
Syria refused to return to the negotiating table unless the
Israeli government first agrees to a full pullout.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu rejected the demand,
saying that the strategic plateau is vital to Israel. But his
predecessors, Labor Party leaders reportedly verbally accepted an
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in return for normalized ties
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syria and Egypt have been in close coordination in restarting
the Israeli-Syrian peace talks that have been frozen for over one
year.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Economy Maintains Momentum in 1st Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Canadian economy maintained its
momentum in the first quarter of 1997, Statistics Canada reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Its gross domestic product advanced 0.8 percent during the
first three months of the year, following similar gains in the
previous two quarters.
</P>
<P>
Healthy gains were recorded in business investment in plant and
equipment, consumer spending and investment in housing, the
federal agency said.
</P>
<P>
"Exports rebounded from their stall in the fourth
quarter. Imports increased sharply in tandem however, feeding both
domestic demand and intermediate imputs to export production," the
agency said.
</P>
<P>
Businesses continued to increase their inventories but at a
slower pace than in the fourth quarter.
</P>
<P>
In the first quarter, investment in plant and equipment rose
4.8 percent following back-to-back gains in the previous two
quarters of 5.6 percent.
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, consumer spending surged 1.3 percent, slightly
less than the previous quarter. And corporate profits advanced 4.0
percent.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan not interfering in Afghan Affairs: FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Foreign Minister Gohar
Ayub Khan told the Senate today that Pakistan was not interfering
in the internal affairs of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question about a press report that Russia had
threatened Pakistan on its alleged involvement in Afghan affairs,
Ayub Khan said the Pakistani Foreign Ministry "received no threat
from any country including Russia."
</P>
<P>
Instead, he added, Russian Deputy Foreign Minister will be
visiting Pakistan from June 6 to 8 and he himself is also going to
Russia on July 8.
</P>
<P>
The news report was "highly speculative" and was not based on
reality, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan Taliban militia are now controlling 90 percent of
the Afghan territory and fighting is going on only in
Mazar-e-Sharif, the northern strategic town, according to the
Foreign Minister.
</P>
<P>
Talks between the Taliban and General Abdul Malik were under
way to try to arrive at an agreement, Ayub Khan said.
</P>
<P>
The situation was not alarming and it would improve, he added.

<HEADLINE> Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan Keen to Expand Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan should
expand cooperation and halt the fall in bilateral trade caused by
red tape, Kazakh President Nursultan Nazarbayev and his visiting
Uzbek counterpart, Islam Karimov, said today.
</P>
<P>
Karimov arrived here today for a two-day visit, the first by a
Uzbek head of state since the two countries established diplomatic
relations in November 1992.
</P>
<P>
Trade and economic cooperation was one of the main topics on
the agenda. Trade volume between the two countries fell 30
percent last year, from 423 million U.S. dollars in 1995 to 293
million dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders agreed that the decline was a result of
bureaucratic practices by officials in both countries.
</P>
<P>
As for integration between countries in the Commonwealth of
Independent States, the two presidents said the process should be
based on the principles of mutual respect for territorial
integrity and sovereignty and non-interference in each other's
internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
The two countries also signed 14 agreements covering free
trade, environmental protection and cooperation in transport and
telecommunications.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Launches Clean-Up Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Cyprus today launched a "Clean-up
Cyprus" campaign, aimed at making the island a more competitive
tourist destination.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a launching ceremony today, President Glafcos
Clerides said "a clean Cyprus is essential for our tourism, as
well as for our own well-being."
</P>
<P>
He said, "A clean environment is an element of culture and our
tradition is obliging us to display our culture."
</P>
<P>
He also stressed the need to familiarize citizens with it,
from their early childhood.
</P>
<P>
The all-Cyprus clean-up campaign, the first phase of which
will cost 150,000 Cyprus pounds (about 300,000 U.S. dollars), is
part of new policy on tourism, approved by the Cabinet last
year, in an effort to improve the tourist environment.
</P>
<P>
Measures to be taken during the campaign include checking
up hotel operating costs, control on the number of hotel beds
and infrastructure projects and cleaning of main roads and
public places.
</P>
<P>
The campaign, to be carried out in three phases, will be
participated by municipalities and regional authorities in the
tourism areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, this eastern Mediterranean island attracted about
2 million foreign tourists, earning 780 million Cyprus pounds
(1.56 billion U.S. dollars). This represents 36.8 percent of the
total revenue of the country from exporting goods and services.

PARIS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Socialist Party and the Communist
Party are negotiating the forming of a new leftwing government
after the left alliance won a parliament majority in the
legislative election.
</P>
<P>
Communist Party National Secretary Robert Hue said today that
his party is waiting for a response from the Socialist Party on
its proposals on guaranteed minimum wage, or SMIC, and budget
policies of the new government.
</P>
<P>
Hue reaffirmed his party's readiness to make a successful
leftwing government in a letter sent today to Socialist Party
First Secretary Lionel Jospin, who has been nominated prime
minister by President Jacques Chirac.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party has proposed a 500 franc (80 U.S. dollar)
raise of the SMIC on July 1, a subsidy for helping the small and
medium-sized enterprises, a reduction of tax, and the cutting of
weekly working time from 39 hours to 35 hours without reducing
salary.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party, which won 240 seats in the 577-seat
National Assembly, must ally with the Communist Party, which won
38 seats, and other smaller leftwing parties to form an absolute
parliament majority and a government.

<HEADLINE> Africa's First Ladies Urged to Promote Peace, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Incoming Chairman of the Organisation
of African Unity (OAU), Zimbabwean President Robert Mugabe today
urged Africa's first ladies to promote peace and stability in the
continent.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe, who had just taken over the leadership of the 53-member
organisation from Cameroun President Paul Biya, said the continent's
first ladies should assist in ensuring that the political environment
in their countries was conducive to peace, stability and
humanitarianism.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to an address to the OAU summit by Mariam
Abacha, wife of Nigerian leader General Sani Abacha, who
presented him with the report of the first summit of the African
first ladies peace mission held in Abuja, Nigeria, last May.
</P>
<P>
Madame Abacha, who chairs the peace mission and is the first
African first lady to address the OAU in its 34-year history, had
asked African leaders attending the summit to deal seriously with
issues of conflicts, wars and refugees that bedevil Africa and affect
mostly women and children.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe thanked the African first ladies for coming up with the
initiative, saying it was timely and deserved the support of african
leaders in the pursuit of the common objective of achieving peace and
unity on the continent which has a record six million refugees and 20
million displaced people.
</P>
<P>
He added that African first ladies had a serious task to ensure
that ''first gentlemen'' worked in a political environment that
guaranteed peace, observance of human rights and democratic rule.
</P>
<P>
''First ladies must assist in the promotion of democracy and
ensure that dictators are brought to book,'' said Mugabe.
</P>
<P>
''They can build a very, very strong whip and let them use it
because behind every successful man there is a woman and behind
every successful first gentleman, there is a first lady,'' he
said. enditem

<HEADLINE> Israel Raps PA Over Killing of Land Dealers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Israeli government decided today
to lodge a sharp protest to the Palestinian Authority (PA) over
its alleged involvement in murdering Palestinians who sold land to
Jews.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting of Israeli security
establishment convened by Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu,
Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai and Public Security Minister
Avigdor Kahalani.
</P>
<P>
The meeting condemned the PA for the recent killing of
three Palestinians who sold land to Jews, and ordered the
police and security services to take measures to prevent
further kidnapping and murder of Palestinian land dealers.
</P>
<P>
The General Security Service has compiled a list of
Palestinian land dealers for security protection. Meanwhile, the
police will issue arrest warrants to suspects in the murders.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu claimed that police investigations have indicated the
PA's involvement in the killing of three Palestinian land
dealers. Warning the incidents are hurting the peace process,
Netanyahu vowed that his government will "do all it can to
fight the phenomenon."
</P>
<P>
To increase pressure on the PA, Netanyahu said Israel is
working to arrange an international forum to discuss what he
called PA's violations of human rights and peace accords.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after attending the Knesset (Parliament) Foreign
Affairs and Defense Committee to brief the security situation,
Mordechai once against blamed the PA for the recent killings.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai said Israel would not allow the continuation of
such acts and would do its best to prevent more killings.
He also called on the international community to take actions
to pressure the PA to stop killing land delaers.
</P>
<P>
Israel's angry reaction came after the third Palestinian land
dealer was found killed last Saturday in the
Palestinian-controlled city of Ramallah, north to the Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ali Jamhour, 34, the Palestinian land dealer, who lived in
Jerusalem's Shuafat refugee camp and held an Israeli indentity
card, was shot twice in the head.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Farid Bashiti, a 70-year-old Palestinian land
dealer living in Jerusalem, was also shot dead in Ramallah,
becoming the first victim of recent wave of killings. Days
later, another land dealer named Harbi Abu Sarah from a
village near Ramallah, was also killed reportedly for selling
land to Israelis.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday night, Jerusalem police also foiled an attempt
by six Palestinians to abduct Palestinian land dealer Assad
Rajibi, who is living in northeast of the city.
</P>
<P>
The Police pursued the two cars driven by the kinappers
on the road to Ramallah, and stopped them after a 15
minute chase. Rajibi was freed and the six kidnappers were
arrested. Four of the six men were claimed by Israeli police
to be Palestinian security agents.
</P>
<P>
Israel blames the recent wave of killings on the PA
because they all occured following the PA cabinet meeting last
month calling for punishment of those who sell land to
Jews, as part of its fight against Israel's settlement
expansion.
</P>
<P>
PA Justice Minister Freih Abu Meidein has said that selling
land to Jews was punishable by the death penalty. But he denied
today any PA involvement in the recent killings, and blasted
Israel for interfering in the PA's internal politics.

<HEADLINE> Arafat Seeks Support in Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian President Yasser Arafat
today urged African countries to support his organization's
stance against "expropriation of Palestinian land" by the Israeli
government of Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the opening session of the 33rd summit of the
Organization of African Unity, Arafat said the Israeli government
is currently involved in the violation of human rights through
the occupation of Palestinian land in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said Israel, by constructing resettlements on Palestinian
land, is violating the United Nations resolution 181 on Palestine
and also threatening the process of attaining peace in the Middle
East.
</P>
<P>
The Resolution 181, Arafat said, was reached when 134 countries
voted in favor of it while only three opposed it, and for that
reason it was not proper for the Netanyahu government to breach
it.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to assure you of our commitment to negotiations
and peace to ensure the rights of our people," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We invite you to urge Israel to commit itself to the
attainment of peace and stop the expropriation of Palestine
land," he said.
</P>
<P>
The OAU is expected to adopt a resolution supporting the
Palestinian people and the right to their land as well as
condemning the Israeli government for violating the principles on
which the Middle East peace process is founded.
</P>
<P>
Arafat said it is only through the attainment of peace that
the entire Middle East region could prosper and develop.

<HEADLINE> Women to Play Bigger Role in New French Parliament </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Women will play a bigger role in the
newly elected French parliament as the number of women deputies
has almost doubled to 63 from the 32 of the previous parliament.
</P>
<P>
Mainly due to the success of women candidates from leftwing
parties, women's representation rate in the French parliament has
increased to 10.9 percent from 6.4 percent, the highest in the
history of the Fifth Republic.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party, which let its women candidates to run in
30 percent of the constituencies, has had 42 women candidates
elected or re-elected this time.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party's women deputies also increased from two in
the previous parliament to four, all elected or re-elected in the
Paris region.
</P>
<P>
The Green Party, which entered parliament for the first time,
had three out of seven elected as women deputies.
</P>
<P>
Seven out of eight outgoing women deputies of the Gaullist
Rally for the Republic were re-elected this time, while the
centrist Union of French Democracy saw only five of its 17
outgoing women deputies surviving in the new parliament.
</P>
<P>
But France still falls behind many European countries in women
representation in parliament, such as Britain whose parliament has
an 18.2 percent women representation, Italy with 12.7 percent,
Spain with 30 percent, Sweden with 40 percent, and Iceland with 50
percent.

<HEADLINE> Czech Deputy Foreign Minister to Visit Tanzania </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A three-man delegation from
the Republic of Czech is expected to arrive here on June 9 for a
two-day working visit.
</P>
<P>
According to a statement issued here today by the Ministry of
Foreign Affairs, the delegation shall be led by Czech's Deputy
Foreign Minister Helena Bambasova and is to hold official talks
with Tanzanian Foreign Minister Jakaya Kikwete.
</P>
<P>
This is the first official delegation to visit Tanzania
since the rise of the republics Czech and Slovakia after the the
peaceful division of the former Socialist Republic of
Czechslovakia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
The statement said relations between Tanzania and Czech under
the former Czechslovakia Republic took off in 1975 following the
signing of an economic co-operation between the two countries and
another one in 1986 which was specific on trade.
</P>
<P>
Tanzania received various types of assistance from the former
socialist republic including plant and machinery for cement and
ceramic industries and the rehabilitation of the Tanzania
Breweries Limited.
</P>
<P>
The visit of the deputy foreign minister to Tanzania is
expected to be an opportunity for the sharing of experience of
the two countries on the on-going political and economic
transformation especially as Czech is famous for its highly
advanced fish farming.

<HEADLINE> Syrian High-Ranking Officials to Visit Beirut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese President Elias Hrawi
announced here today that Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim
Khaddam and Foreign Minister Farouk al-Shara will visit Beirut in
the next 48 hours to brief him on the outcome of their recent
tour of Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
Hrawi told visitors to the Beirut Presidential Palace that
Khaddam and Shara will be in Beirut "Tuesday or Wednesday" to
inform him of regional situations and Arab affairs, especially
after the Turkish incursion into northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The Lebanese president, quoted by the state-run Lebanese
National News Agency, stressed that every Arab state has a
link with "the Turkish aggression against Iraq."
</P>
<P>
The two Syrian officials have been leading a massive
diplomatic drive in an attempt to rally Arab and international
support for the Syrian position in the deadlocked Middle East
peace process.
</P>
<P>
Syria has sensed U.S. and Israeli schemes to isolate it from
peace process by concentrating on the Israeli-Palestinian track
and by developing U.S.-backed military cooperation between Turkey
and Israel, local reports said.
</P>
<P>
During their latest tour of Arab states in the Gulf and
North Africa, the Syrian officials sought to alert Arab
leaders to the dangers of this so-called "Turkish-Israeli-U.S.
alliance" in the hope of prompting a common Arab strategy to
deal with it.
</P>
<P>
They also sought to persuade and bring Arab pressure to
bear on the Gulf state of Qatar to postpone a Middle East
and North African economic summit in Doha in November.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, Syria believes the holding of such
conference with Israel's participation would "undermine Arab
resolutions adopted a year ago to stop all normalization moves
with Israel."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: OAU Moves On to Eradicate Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Yu Dabo)
</P>
<P>
HARARE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- African leaders meeting here at
their 33rd summit today stressed the urgent need to protect
African children from forced labor.
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim, secretary general of the Organization of
African Unity (OAU), devoted much attention to the issues of
child labor and frequent use of children as combatants in his
report presented to the summit.
</P>
<P>
The OAU summit opened today at the Sheraton Hotel in downtown
Harare amid intensifying efforts by the organization to address a
series of issues facing the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Unlike previous summits, this year's meeting placed the
protection of children high on the agenda. The summit followed
the International Children's Day.
</P>
<P>
Child labor is a complicated and widespread problem in many
developing countries, particularly in Africa, where work by
children is commonplace and perceived to be firmly rooted in
socio-cultural and economic factors.
</P>
<P>
In many households and factories across Africa, especially in
rural areas, child work forms an integral part of children's
upbringing and training towards adulthood and is considered an
important part of the child's socialization process.
</P>
<P>
Studies by the OAU on agricultural plantations in a number of
African countries offered clear evidence of risk to children from
pesticides and chemicals, heavy machinery, harsh climatic
conditions and sustained period of overwork. Moreover, these
child laborers earn little or no pay.

ISLAMABAD, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Speaker of the National
Assembly, Illahi Bukhsh Soomro, said today that the dream of a
peaceful and prosperous South Asia will remain elusive unless a
visionary approach is adopted by the leaders of the region.
</P>
<P>
Soomro was speaking at a reception here in honor of a Chinese
delegation from the People's Congress (parliament) of Jiangxi
province.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan is prepared to play its part and has initiated
a dialogue with India for the resolution of outstanding issues.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the search for a durable and lasting
solution to all the contentious problems will yield positive
results.
</P>
<P>
"Like all other countries of the world, we in South Asia, would
like to enter into the 21 century, with an earnest desire to
provide better quality of life," Soomro said.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan and China have already had excellent relations
which both want to further promote. Pakistan looks forward to
enhanced cooperation with China in all fields, he added.
</P>
<P>
Soomro said he had discussed with the visiting Chinese
delegation matters of mutual concern.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the Chinese delegation, Huang Mingxin, said China
and Pakistan have long maintained very friendly relations. The
current visit will further enhance mutual understanding,
strengthen friendship and promote exchange in the fields of
economy and trade.
</P>
<P>
Huang said there is much room for cooperation in economic,
trade, and exchange of technology between local governments of the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that bilateral cooperation on the basis of equality
and mutual benefit will achieve more encouraging results in
future.

<HEADLINE> PA Official Denys Involvement In Killings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian officials today
categorically denied Israeli charges that the Palestinian
Authority was behind the killings of three Palestinians who have
allegedly sold land to Jews.
</P>
<P>
According to a report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service
based in East Jerusalem, Hanan Ashrawi, Member of Palestinian
Council and Minister of Higher Education, said the killings of the
three Palestinian land dealers were possibly of criminal nature
and not an issue that the Palestinian Authority took decision on.
</P>
<P>
In the past few weeks, three Palestinian land dealers were
found dead in the West Bank. Israel has held the Palestinian
Authority responsible for the killings.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Benyamin Netanayhu held a meeting here this
morning to discuss the matter. A statement issued by Netanyahu's
Media Adviser David Bar-Ilan indicated Israel will launch an
international propaganda campaign against what it called
infringements by the Palestinian Authority of human rights and of
the Oslo peace accords.
</P>
<P>
However, Ashrawi declared "our only position was that it did
not allow the sale of land to Israelis," and "it is a question of
(Palestinian) sovereignty."
</P>
<P>
She said that the Palestinian Authority inherited the Jordanian
law in the West Bank and other systems in Gaza and the existing
law does allow the death penalty, but has not been implemented.
</P>
<P>
"I can say categorically that the Palestinian Authority did
not give any order to carry out any death penalty or to carry out
any execution of killings," she added.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: OAU Moves On to Eradicate Child Labor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
(by Yu Dabo)
</P>
<P>
HARARE, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The widespread child labor has
drawn serious concern from the OAU, and OAU officials said
African governments are anxious to address these and other abuses
stemming from child labor.
</P>
<P>
The OAU summit is expected to take a coherent
multi-disciplinary approach which focuses on key issues like
education, the enactment and enforcement of legislation, and the
underlying problem of poverty alleviation.
</P>
<P>
The conference will also demonstrate a firm political will at
the highest level to eradicate child labor, OAU officials said.
</P>
<P>
They said the OAU is currently joining a broad cooperative
effort involving UNICEF and other UN agencies, national
governments, workers' and employers' organizations to solve the
child labor problem.
</P>
<P>
To meet the challenge, the OAU is set to provide assistance in
the design and implementation of programs for the protection of
children and the phased elimination of child labor.
</P>
<P>
It has been rapidly expanding its activities on the continent,
sponsoring workshops and conferences with the aim of stimulating
greater debate, expertise, analysis and action at national and
regional levels.
</P>
<P>
Pilot surveys for the development of a methodology to gather
fresh and more reliable data on child labor have been undertaken,
and a series of localized action programs launched.
</P>
<P>
These programs include activities ranging from
awareness-raising and advocacy, to the improvement of labor
inspection methods. So far, 15 African countries have played host
to these project activities.
</P>
<P>
As the world is stepping up its efforts for the protection of
children, the OAU seeks to provide a forum for dialogue. The
current OAU summit offers the possibility of an important step
forward.

<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Deposed Afghan prime minister
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar has decided to form a joint front with Uzbek
general Abdul Malik to fight against the Islamic Taliban militia,
Afghan sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Hekmatyar, who was ousted last September when the Taliban took
Kabul, said in an interview that he would consolidate with Malik
in fighting against the Islamic militia, according to the sources
in Peshawar, Pakistan's major city in the northwestern region.
</P>
<P>
Malik, whose defection triggered the downfall of his former
boss Uzbek warlord Rashid Dostum, turned his back on the Taliban
late last month almost immediately after the fall of
Mazar-e-Sharif, Dostum's headquarters, causing a serious setback
for the Taliban in northern Afghan fronts.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sources said, fighting between the Taliban and
opposition forces including those of Malik and Ahamd Masood, the
former military chief of the ousted Afghan government, was
continuing in the northern provinces of Samangan, Baghlan, Parwan
and Wardak.

Ethiopia today said it loses an estimated 1.5 to 2.5 billion Birr
(about 223 to 373 million Dollars) annually as many of animals
die each year due to diseases.
</P>
<P>
This is disclosed here by Hadira Gebru, head of the Animal and
Fishery Resources Development Department of the ministry when she
was opening the one-day annual meeting of the Ethiopian Assistant
Veterinarians Association.
</P>
<P>
Hadira said that about 150,000 square kilometers of land in
the southern and western Ethiopia is infested with tse-tse fly.
</P>
<P>
It is increasingly proving difficult to carry out any form of
agriculture in these localities due to the inavailability of
animal power, she said.
</P>
<P>
She urged participants of the meeting to come up with concrete
solutions to the problem which she said poses considerable
challenge to the development of Ethiopia's animal resources.

<HEADLINE> Jordan Calls for More Aid for Palestinian Refugees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Jordan today called on donor nations
to continue bearing their responsibility for Palestinian refugees
and increase donations to the United Nations Relief and Work Agency
(UNRWA).
</P>
<P>
The appeal was made by Jordan's Crown Prince Hassan today when
he was visiting a training center of the UNRWA here.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince warned that any cut on the education and
health aid by the UNRWA, which is to suffer a tight budget this
year, will adversely affect the Palestinian refugees' living
standards and will not help their cause.
</P>
<P>
The world's relief agency has rendered help to some 3 million
Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon, the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
With some 1 million Palestinian refugees, about one fourth
of its total population in the kingdom, Jordan allocates 300
million U.S. dollars annually for the refugee camps, a sum close
to UNRWA's estimated annual budget of 360 million dollars,
Hassan noted.
</P>
<P>
The allocation was important in raising the living standards of
all the refugees in the Jordanian society, he added.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, he said, the refugees' right to repatriation and
compensation should not be undermined.
</P>
<P>
The UNRWA is reportedly seeking more donations to ensure its
work this year.
</P>
<P>
About 1 million Palestinians were made homeless during the
First Middle East War in 1948 when Israel annexed part of the
Palestinian land.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians then went to live in the refugee camps in
Jordan, Syria, Lebanon and the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
In the following year, the United Nations established the
UNRWA, a sister agency to the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees (UNHCR), to deal with the issues of the Palestinian
refugees.

<HEADLINE> Cypriot President: Turkey's Instability Affects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Political instability in Turkey
will affect ongoing efforts to seek a solution to Cyprus' issue,
Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides warned here today.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the press, President Clerides said "there
will be a period of political instability in Turkey, which
cannot be helpful to efforts towards finding a Cyprus solution."
</P>
<P>
His words came just a few days before invitations can be issued
by U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan for direct talks between the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides. The talks were set to begin in
July near New York.
</P>
<P>
Clerides and Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash have both
said they will respond positively to Annan's call for talks.
</P>
<P>
"We will attend the talks despite the fact we haven't noticed
any change in the Turkish stance on the basic aspects of the
problem, but after assurances given by the U.N. chief that he
will have the support of the five permanent members of the
Security Council," Clerides said.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot president disclosed the Greek Cypriot side told
the U.N., the U.S., Britain and France that it would attend the
talks to avoid being blamed as the "negative" side, a stance
that could affect Cyprus' bid for accession to the European
Union.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the thorny question of security, the president
said "we have already pointed out that future security is one of
the most basic issues concerning the Cyprus problem and without
finding a solution to this particular question, no Cyprus
solution can be reached."
</P>
<P>
He said the security issue has three aspects, namely the
island's complete demilitarization, the deployment of a
multi-national force with a mandate from the U.N. Security
Council to intervene when the territorial integrity, independence
or the security of one of the two communities is threatened, and
the abolition of any guarantor power's right to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Britain, Turkey and Greece have played the role of guarantors
of Cyprus after the island's independence from Britain in 1960.
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after Turkish troops occupied its northern
third in the wake of an Athens-backed coup.

<HEADLINE> New Technique Invented for Genetically Treating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have developed a
technique for efficiently delivering genes to almost all the cells
in the heart, moving closer to genetically treat heart diseases.
</P>
<P>
Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions said in a news letter that
its cardiologists "infected" nearly 100 percent of the muscle
cells of a rabbit heart with a new gene, using a disabled version
of a common virus, the adenovirus, as a carrier.
</P>
<P>
"Our novel delivery system is the first to demonstrate
virtually complete transduction of an intact heart and could be
adapted to achieve widespread gene transfer in human hearts," said
chief researcher John Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
Using coronary arteries, Hopkins researchers delivered high
concentrations of a virus carrying a "reporter" gene -- a gene
could be easily located in any cells, then they collected the
virus after it had passed through the heart and redelivered it
several times.
</P>
<P>
"Our infection rates more than tripled the most successful
previous experiments. We believe that the repeated passes through
the heart gave the virus time to overcome structural barriers to
its spread," said Lawrence.
</P>
<P>
To cure heart diseases caused by changes in the function of
heart muscle cells, researchers need to modify the characteristics
of individual diseased cells. The new technique makes gene therapy
a potential way to do that, he said.
</P>
<P>
However, to make genes that can have a beneficial effect on the
heart, scientists also need to learn more about how heart cells
control heart functions like contraction and rhythm, Lawrence
said.

<HEADLINE> Legal Center of Namibia Wins UNICEF's Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Legal Assistance Center
of Namibia has won the 1997 Maurice Pate Award for its outstanding
contributions in drafting child-rights legislation in that
southwestern African nation, the United Nations Children's Fund
(UNICEF) announced today.
</P>
<P>
The annual Pate Award, the UNICEF's highest honor, is named for
the agency's first executive director who led the UNICEF from 1947
until his death in 1965.
</P>
<P>
"From the drafting of national legislation to protect children,
its community-based legal education programs, its efforts to help
adolescents stay out of trouble and assist families in need, the
center has demonstrated a dedication to children's rights that is
an inspiration not only to a region, but an entire continent,"
said Carol Bellamy, the UNICEF's executive director.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1988, two years before Namibia gained its
independence from South Africa, the center played a pivotal role
in drafting the Children Care and Protection Act, a comprehensive
legal proposal that has been presented to Namibia's legislature,
the UNICEF reported.
</P>
<P>
Its efforts on behalf of adolescents includes the Juvenile
Justice Project, a program that works with government ministries
and other non-governmental organizations to find alternatives to
prison for young offenders. It also works to deter adolescents
from crime, according to the UNICEF.

<HEADLINE> Tensions between Hezbollah, Peace-Keepers Ease </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A spokesman of the U.N. peacekeeping
forces operating in south Lebanon said here today that the recent
problems with the Lebanese pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or Party of God,
were over.
</P>
<P>
Timur Goksel, who is also the political advisor of the
U.N. Interim Force in Lebanon (UNIFIL), made the announcement
after meeting a leader of the Lebanese Shiite Muslim party.
</P>
<P>
Tensions erupted last week between Hezbollah and the UNIFIL
following reports that former UN trucks were being manned by
Israeli troops in the occupation zone, leading to fears of
surprise attacks by the Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
Repeated harassments against Irish and Polish soldiers of the
U.N forces were then reported to be meted out by Hezbollah, which
vowed to fight and oust the Israeli occupation fores out of south
Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Nabil Kaouk, Hezbollah's head in south Lebanon who
received the UNIFIL delegation led by Goksel in the south
Lebanese market town of Nabatiyeh, said they discussed the issue
of UN vehicles being used by Israeli forces and the measures to be
taken by the UNIFIL.
</P>
<P>
However Goksel described the reports on UN vehicles being used
by Israeli troops occupying a border strip in south Lebanon as
"exaggerated."
</P>
<P>
He promised that the UNIFIL will take measures to treat this
issue, but declined to specify.
</P>
<P>
He confirmed that some vehicles belonging to the U.N.
Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) on the Golan Heights had
been sold, but stressed that "they were scrap vehicles and
unusable."
</P>
<P>
Kaouk accused the Israel of violating international laws and
using all means to protect its soldiers."
</P>
<P>
The 4,500-strong UNIFIL, comprising contingents from Fiji,
Finland, France, Ghana, Ireland, Italy, Nepal, Norway and
Poland, was set up in 1978 in south Lebanon following the
first Israeli aggression of that country.
</P>
<P>
A UNIFIL statement had complained that in a Friday incident,
two Irish soldiers were disarmed and ordered to lie on the road
after their UN vehicle were stopped by five armed Hezbollah
fighters.
</P>
<P>
In another incident on Thursday, seven Hezbollah gunmen
stopped two Polish UNIFIL soldiers, placed guns to the their heads
and pulled triggers of empty chambers, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
South Lebanese security sources said that a number of scrapped
UN trucks belonging to the UNDOF had been sold to a south
Lebanese businessman from Marjayoun, and the trucks were
transported to Marjayoun via Israel.
</P>
<P>
Goksel pointed out that this was not the first time for the
multi-national peacekeeping forces to face problems in their
20-year-old presence in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
"The presence of the neutral international forces is for
safeguarding the residents, helping and pacifying the people,"
Goksel underlined.

<HEADLINE> S. African Trade Union Holds General Strikes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of thousand of
Congress of South Africa Trade Union (COSATU) members today took
to the street across the country in protest against the Basic
Conditions of Employment Bill.
</P>
<P>
COSATU leader Sam Shilowa told reporters that more than two
million workers responded to the COSATU's call for better
conditions of employment.
</P>
<P>
The employment bill adopted by Business South Africa provides
for a 45-hour working week and for four months' maternity leave,
but makes no reference to payment.
</P>
<P>
It conditionally sets the employable age limit at 15, but says
only 18-year-olds and above can be employed in jobs deemed
physical or dangerous.
</P>
<P>
However, the COSATU demands a maximum 40-hour working week and
six months' maternity leave, four months of which should be paid
leave. The labor federation also wants the employment age limit
set at 18.
</P>
<P>
Today's 24-hour general strike was the third since the 1994
general elections, aimed at forcing employers to accede to the
humble demands of workers on legislative issues pertaining to
improvement of working conditions and worker rights, Shilowa said.
</P>
<P>
He warned employers that if they wanted to take a hard line,
the union federation would also take a tit-for-tat attitude to
challenge them.
</P>
<P>
A large number of police, soldiers and traffic officials were
mobilized to maintain strong presence in central Johannesburg
when tens of thousands of demonstrators were marching in the
downtown streets.
</P>
<P>
So far, there is no report of any clashes between the police
and demonstrators.

<HEADLINE> Saudi Arabia Lauds Results of GCC FM Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Saudi Arabia today welcomed
results of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) Foreign Ministers'
Meeting that dealt with issues of mutual interest both in the Gulf
region and the Middle East as a whole.
</P>
<P>
This came after a weekly session of the cabinet meeting
chaired by Saudi King Fahd Bin Abdul Aziz, said reports of the
Kuwait News Agency from Saudi Red Sea city of Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministers of the six GCC states expressed the hope that
the GCC-Iranian relations would improve and called on Tehran to
end what they termed as its occupation of the three islands of Abu
Mousa, Greater and Lesser Tunbs, over which the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) also claims sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
The ministers condemned Iran's pursuit of the "status quo
policy" on the three islands, which they said constitutes a
violation of the UAE's sovereignty and undermines the regional
peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
On the Middle East peace process, the ministers also voiced
"profound" worry over its stalemate and future deterioration due
to Israel's provocative policies, mainly on building more
settlements in the occupied territories.
</P>
<P>
They denounced the Israeli "illegitimate and irresponsible"
practices, urging the Jewish state to honor the signed accords and
comply with international mandate related to the peace process.
</P>
<P>
They also called on Turkey to withdraw from northern Iraq and
stop its intervention in the internal affairs of its Arab
neighbor.
</P>
<P>
The ministers also expressed their "great worry" over the
latest Turkish military movements in northern Iraq, saying that
the intrusion will "threaten international peace and security."
</P>
<P>
In their statement, the ministers also reaffirmed their firm
stand on Iraq's full compliance with U.N. resolutions relating
to its 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic bloc founded in
1981, groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Oman, Qatar and
Bahrain.

LUSAKA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick Chiluba
has said that economic development is a major task facing
southern African region.
</P>
<P>
The Zambia News Agency today quoted him as saying in Harare,
the capital of Zimbabwe on Sunday that southern Africa is facing
major economic problems and warned that unless the trend is
redressed, the sovereignty of the countries in the region will
remain compromised with outside support.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who is in Harare to attend the annual summit of the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), told Zambians that economic
regional groupings must be used as tools for development.
</P>
<P>
He said it is imperative for southern African countries to
remove all trade barriers to promote an equal economic play-field
by harmonizing rules and regulations on trade.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba also urged the Zambians living in Zimbabwe to respect
the laws of the country and become responsible residents.
</P>
<P>
The region can only emerge as a strong economic bloc once its
people begin to live harmoniously, Chiluba said.

<HEADLINE> Study Suggests Minimum Wage Without Increasing Jobless </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A minimum wage could be introduced
at up to 3.75 pounds (six US dollars) an hour without adding to
Britain's unemployment, according to a report published today.
</P>
<P>
A study by the Employment Policy Institute (EPI) found that
Conservative claims of big job losses as a result of setting a
statutory pay floor were misplaced.
</P>
<P>
In a 10-point program for the Low Pay Commission (LPC), the
tripartite body of business, unions and academics which will work
out the details of the national minimum wage (NMW), the EPI said
attention should be focused on issues other than the hourly rate.
</P>
<P>
The LPC was announced by Labor while in opposition as a means
of moving away from the party's former commitment to a rigid
formula -- half male median earnings -- for a minimum wage.
</P>
<P>
The report will help the Labor government to fend off charges
from the Conservatives that a minimum wage at four pounds (6.4 US
dollars) an hour would cost up to a million jobs.
</P>
<P>
The EPI argued that there was no evidence to show that minimum
wages harmed employment in those sectors covered by wages councils
between the late 1970s and early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the NMW should not be seen as an
anti-poverty panacea but as part of a range of measures to help
people on low incomes.
</P>
<P>
On wage costs, the EPI stressed that a NMW would add about 1
percent to the wage bill if set at 3.80 pounds (6.1 US dollars) an
hour, but the total impact was likely to be greater because of the
impact on differentials.
</P>
<P>
Estimates have shown that a NMW of 3.25 pounds (4.2 US dollars)
an hour accompanied by 25 percent restoration of differentials
could increase the inflation rate by 0.6 percent, rising to 1.1
percent for a NMW of 3.80 pounds (6.1 US dollars) an hour.
</P>
<P>
The EPI said, "Knock-on effects are difficult to assess with
any accuracy. The LPC should as a priority obtain detailed
estimates of likely knock-on effects."
</P>
<P>
The report suggested the system should provide in-built
protection against higher youth unemployment by setting a lower
rate for younger workers and trainees.
</P>
<P>
The EPI said that the policing of the minimum wage should be
integrated with existing forms of routine business inspection to
reduce intrusiveness and unnecessary red tape.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak's Sons Sue Saudi Paper for Libel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak's
two sons have filed a libel suit against a leading Saudi newspaper
which told "lies" about their business dealings, the Egyptian MENA
news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Sharq Al-Awsat was sued for publishing a full-page
advertisement for a new magazine which promised to include a
report, complete with pictures and figures, the deals, commissions
and monopolies allegedly attributed to Alaa and Gamal Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
According to the advertisement, Alaa and Gamal will get one
million pounds as commission on every Airbus aircraft EgyptAir had
bought, said a senior prosecution source who listed the "false
allegations" by the leading Arabic daily.
</P>
<P>
The London-based paper also blamed the delayed marketing of
mobile phones in Egypt on Alaa's seeking to be the sole franchiser.
</P>
<P>
It believed that the granites slabs that the Cairo government
use to beautify the city streets were bought from the president's
son.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak's two sons, who are both prominent members of Egyptian
business groups, said the ad "included lies defaming their
characters and the reputation of their family."
</P>
<P>
The attorney general office is investigating the complaint and
defendants, a Saudi-owned media company, will be interrogated.
</P>
<P>
It was not immediately known what penalties the company might
face, but Asharq Al-Awsat daily was banned Tuesday.

<HEADLINE> US Undecided on Renewal of Iraqi Oil-for-Food Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The United States, in reaction
of a U.N. proposal of renewing the Iraqi "oil-for-food" deal, said
today that it would need time for consideration for that proposal.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan earlier today recommended the
renewal of the deal, which expired on June 7, on the same terms:
allowing Iraq to sell up to 2 billion dollars worth of oil for six
months and use the money to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
Most members of the U.N. Security Council have reportedly said
they would like to see the deal renewed under the current terms or
even increased.
</P>
<P>
But the United States has reserved its position.
</P>
<P>
"That will come up for consideration later this week," State
Department spokesman John Dinger told reporters. "We will study
the issue closely and make our determination closer to the time of
renewal."
</P>
<P>
He criticized Baghdad for its failure to adhere to U.N.
Security Council resolutions and dismissed as nonsensical Iraq's
blame on the United States for deliberate ignorance of hardships
the Iraqi people are facing.

TEHRAN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Iranian government said here
today that it has closed its embassy in Kabul and its diplomats
have left the Afghan capital.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman of the Iranian Foreign Ministry,
said that the aim of the Iranian embassy, which had remained open
after most countries closed their missions in Kabul, was to

Last weekend, the fundamentalist Taliban militia captured the
northern stronghold of Mazar-i-Sharif once held by warlord
Dostum in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
He hoped that those responsible for creating this tension
would change their policies in the interests of peace so as to
help reduce the bloodshed and miseries of the Afghan Muslims.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi said that Iran is determined to continue its
humanitarian assistance to Afghanistan and called on international
organizations and countries the world over to aid and abet peace
efforts in Afghanistan.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Notifies Congress on Sierra Leone Evacuation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- President Bill Clinton on Monday
formally notified Congress of U.S. military moves of evacuating
Americans from Freetown, the capital of Sierra Leone, in
accordance with what he called the War Power Resolution.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Congress, Clinton said the military moves were
taken because of risks the Americans were facing in the West
African country where a recent military coup had overthrown an
elected government.
</P>
<P>
"On May 29 and May 30, due to the uncertain security situation
and the possible threat to American citizens and the American
Embassy in sierra Leone, approximately 200 U.S. military
personnel, including an 11-member Special Forces detachment, were
positioned in Freetown to prepare for the evacuation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. forces would leave Sierra Leone "as soon as
evacuation operations are complete and enhanced security and
location in and around Freetown is no longer required."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, White House spokesman Mike McCurry said more than
300 Americans had been evacuated from Sierra Leone and the
operation would continue for those still trapped in the country.
</P>
<P>
"We continue to monitor efforts related to remaining citizens
who are innocently trapped (by fighting)," he told reporters.
</P>
<P>
McCurry said violence were continuing in Sierra Leone and the
situation in the capital of Freetown had been deteriorating.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. embassy there was hit by rocket-propelled grenade
rounds, he added.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Choose Cremation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- More than a third of the Chinese
people adopt cremation rather than the traditional way of burial
in the ground, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs.
</P>
<P>
The rate of cremation stands at 35.2 percent and cremation has
become a common practice in eight provinces and municipalities, or
about a third of the country, according to Doje Cering, minister
of civil affairs, citing the achievement at a national meeting on
burial ritual reform that opened here today.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has strengthened management on the practice of
burial in the ground, by encouraging the establishment of public
cemeteries.
</P>
<P>
China has built more than 100,000 village-level cemeteries and
nearly 200 city-level cemeteries, forsaking the tradition of
burying the dead anywhere they fancy, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the country has recovered more than 66,000 ha of
farmland through removing tombs in the farmland and along the
railways and highways.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, achievement is also seen in less wastful spending
and superstitious activities in funeral ceremonies, he said.
</P>
<P>
China has more than 2,300 funeral homes, crematoriums and
public cemeteries, which has a combined fixed assets of some 1.9
billion yuan. Over 30,000 people work in this special trade.
</P>
<P>
The minister calls on local officials to work harder in the
reform of funeral and interment, pointing out that workers in this
trade still suffer social prejudice and facilities are outdated in
some places.

<HEADLINE> S.Korea Sets Up Ambitious Plan on Information Technology </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government today
unveiled a plan aimed at making the nation one of the world's top
five information technology (IT) powerhouses within the next
decade.
</P>
<P>
Under its blueprint, the government will invest some 3.15
billion U.S. dollars in developing the domestic IT industry and
promoting an information-based society in the country.
</P>
<P>
The ambitious plan was finalized at a meeting of cabinet
ministers and heads of other government agencies, chaired by Prime
Minister Koh Kun.
</P>
<P>
The plan will work on two levels - demand and supply.
</P>
<P>
The demand side of the plan features a variety of programs to
be implemented by each ministry and government agency for a
broader application of information technology.
</P>
<P>
The programs include an integrated global diplomatic
information network by the foreign ministry, an education network
by the education ministry and a nationwide electronic ID card
system by the home affairs ministry.
</P>
<P>
On the supply side, the government will pour about 876 million
dollars next year into technological development, manpower
cultivation, the fostering of IT firms and software houses, and
assistance for domestic IT firms moving into foreign markets.
</P>
<P>
The government intends to channel 663 million dollars into
technological development with focus on such core technologies as
broadband CDMA (code division multiple access), multimedia and
new-generation rechargeable batteries.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 86 million dollars have been earmarked for human
resources development. While beefing up support for IT-related
educational institutions, the government also plans to open a
world-class graduate school specializing in information technology
in the southern city of Taejon.
</P>
<P>
Emphasis will also be put on fostering IT ventures and software
houses. To help start-up IT ventures, the government is to set up
a cooperative aimed at providing capital to those who want to
incorporate new firms based on their technological expertise.
</P>
<P>
More support centers for software designers and ASIC
(application-specific integrated circuit) developers will also be
established.
</P>
<P>
The government will help IT ventures attract and keep talented
staff by improving the present share option system.

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Barred from Northern Ireland Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The political wing of the IRA, Sinn
Fein, was again barred from multi-party talks on the future of
Northern Ireland which resumed today in Belfast.
</P>
<P>
After being blocked from entering a government building for the
talks, Sinn Fein President Gerry Adams asked angrily, "Is there
any possibility of even opening this gate so that we can have a
civilized conversation?"
</P>
<P>
Britain's new Labor government recently eased a ban on official
contacts with Sinn Fein without preconditions of a ceasefire from
the IRA, and held two rounds of talks with a Sinn Fein delegation
on the deadlocked peace process.
</P>
<P>
However, the government has refused to give a seat to Sinn Fein
at the multi-party talks while the IRA refused to agree to a
ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
"We would prefer to have Sinn Fein around the table rather than
not, but that is dependent on a meaningful ceasefire, an
unequivocal ceasefire with supporting words and deeds," Britain's
Northern Ireland Secretary Mo Mowlam told BBC radio.
</P>
<P>
The talks, which first started a year ago, were adjourned
during the British election, in which the Labor Party won a
landslide victory after 18 years in opposition.
</P>
<P>
Sinn Fein leader Adams said his party had a right to take part
in the talks which involve the province's other major parties.
</P>
<P>
"I am not going up to demand anything other than the rights of
those people who voted for us," said Adams, who was elected a
member of parliament in the May 1 election.
</P>
<P>
The Irish Republican Army has been fighting against British
rule in the Northern Ireland over the past 28 years through a
campaign of violence. It ended a 17-month ceasefire in February
1996 and resumed its military campaign.
</P>
<P>
Today's talks were chaired by former U.S. senator George
Mitchell, who seemed optimistic over the new round of negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"We believe that an opportunity exists to move forward in the
process and we hope very much that there will be substantive
progress in these talks in the near future," Mitchell said.

and has been cost-effective and has had good results, Premier Li
Peng said today.
</P>
<P>
Li made the remark while meeting those attending a meeting at
the opening of a national conference on foreign workers.
</P>

The premier called on all departments and localities to attach
great importance to this work and to increase cooperation and

<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The foreign secretary-level talks
between Pakistan and India, scheduled to take place here on June
18 and 19, will be of a "very elementary nature" -- paving the way
for further dialogue, a Pakistani official said here today.
</P>
<P>
"We are busy in preparing blueprints for these talks" and no
headway is expected at this stage, Abbas Haider, director general
of the Policy Planning Division of the Pakistani Foreign Ministry,
told reporters at a briefing.
</P>
<P>
In answering a question, he said the reopening of the Indian
Consulate in Karachi might be on India's agenda, but it is
certainly not on the agenda of his country.
</P>
<P>
"We have taken the initiative and are now on record that
Pakistan wants parleys with India and is ready to resolve issues
by dialogue," Haider added.

<P>
PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Defending champion Steffi Graf was
beaten in straight sets in the quarterfinals at the French Open
here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The second-ranked, five-time champion German was pulled down by
11th-seeded Amanda Coetzer of South Africa 6-1, 6-4, failing to
make the semifinals for the first time since 1986 at Roland Garros.
</P>
<P>
By beating Graf for the third time of the year, Coetzer has
become Graf's nemesis and reached the first Grand Slam semifinal
of her career.
</P>
<P>
The South African gave Graf her first defeat at the Australian
Open and humiliated the German her worst defeat of 6-0, 6-1 at the
German Open last month.
</P>
<P>
Of the 78 points Coetzer won in one hour and 32 minutes, 64
came on unforced errors by Graf, the winner of the tournament in
the last two years.
</P>
<P>
"I was very nervous. I started off making a lot of mistakes, I
was unsure of my shots," said Graf, winner of 21 Grand Slam titles.
</P>
<P>
The match was interrupted for 45 minutes by rain with Coetzer
up 3-1 in the second set.

<HEADLINE> PKK Kills 5 People in Southeastern Turkey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Rebels of the outlawed Kurdish
Workers' Party (PKK) today killed five persons and wounded three
others in an attack on a village in southeastern Turkey, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency said in a report today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that a group of PKK militants opened fire at
people who were digging a drinking water channel in Dikbogaz
village of the southeastern province of Siirt at about 12:00 local
time (09:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The Turkish security forces started large-scale operations to
capture the PKK rebels, but they escaped after the assault, said
the report.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, another group of PKK members set
two trucks on fire, which resulted in the deaths of the two
drivers of the vehicles in Siirt Province at midnight Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Khalil Attachi, leader of the PKK, was quoted by a newspaper as
saying that his group will attack Israeli and U.S. targets in
Turkish cities and tourist areas.
</P>
<P>
Attachi said that his group will "carry out operations against
Israeli targets in (Turkey's largest city) Istanbul and
elsewhere in Turkey and against U.S. enemy interests."
</P>
<P>
About 50,000-strong Turkish government troops have carried
out cross-border military operations in northern Iraq since
mid-May to attack the PKK.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military officials have said that more than 2,000 PKK
members have been killed in the military campaign in northern
Iraq, but the PKK claimed that its losses were less than 100
people.
</P>
<P>
The outlawed PKK has been fighting for autonomy in a almost
13-year-old separatist war in eastern and southeastern Turkey.
About 21,000 people, including civilians, government troops and
the PKK members have been killed so far.

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's gross gold and
foreign exchange reserves shot up 51 percent to 4.95 billion U.S.
dollars in May from 3.27 billion dollars at the end of April,
financial sources said today.
</P>
<P>
The surge in the reserves -- one month before the easing of
foreign exchange controls -- was bigger than even the most
optimistic forecasts, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
According to South Africa's Reserve Bank, the use of foreign
credit lines at the end of May was 409 million U.S. dollars against
568 million dollars in the previous month.
</P>
<P>
The figure means the markets will be relaxed ahead of the easing
of foreign exchange controls. It could also pave the way for
government to go a bit further than anticipated in the March budget
in easing controls, economic analysts said.

<HEADLINE> Jospin Meets Communist Leader on Forming Cabinet </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- France's new Socialist Prime Minister
Lionel Jospin today held talks with Communist Party leader Robert
Hue over his party's participation in the new government.
</P>
<P>
No details were disclosed about their one-hour meeting, but
both Socialist and Communist officials expressed optimism about a
deal.
</P>
<P>
The Communists, who won 38 seats in the new French parliament
in Sunday's election, have presented a set of socio-economic
proposals for the new government, including a 500-franc (80
U.S. dollars) increase in the guaranteed minimum wage, a reduction
of the 20.6 percent sales tax, and an aid program for small and
medium-sized businesses.
</P>
<P>
Jospin, appointed Monday by center-right President Jacques
Chirac, discussed with Hue the policy "content" of the new
government and its make-up, Agence France-Presse quoted sources as
saying.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party won 252 seats in the 557-seat parliament in
Sunday's general election and will have to ally with the Communist
Party and smaller left parties to form a government and gain an
absolute majority.
</P>
<P>
The Communist Party's decision-making national council Monday
adopted a resolution agreeing to join the government if an
agreement is reached with the Socialists.
</P>
<P>
The resolution was discussed on Monday night by local Communist
Party organizations and will be re-examined by the national
council and grassroots party organizations today.
</P>
<P>
Party officials said that the Communists will not enter the
government "with an empty hand" and must force the Socialists to
make some commitments.
</P>
<P>
The last time the Communist Party joined a government was in
1981, when President Francois Mitterrand had four Communist
ministers in his Socialist government.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Airlines Continues to Lose Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Airlines (PAL), which
has been in the red for years, said today that it registered
losses amounting to 1.4 billion pesos (53.4 million U.S. dollars)
during the first quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
In a disclosure to the Securities and Exchange Commission, the
PAL said the losses were a further deterioration from the previous
quarter's net loss of 1.2 billion pesos (45.8 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the PAL reported that its revenues increased by 594.9
million pesos (22.7 million dollars) while operating expenses rose
by a higher amount of 726.8 million pesos (27.7 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
"The increase in operating expenses was mainly due to higher
flying operations expenses, passenger service expenses and lease
charges," the disclosure said.
</P>
<P>
Lucio Tan, a Filipino-Chinese tycoon who owns over 56 percent
of the PAL, predicted earlier that the carrier will incur 2
billion to 3 billion pesos' losses this year and continue to be
loss-making until 1999.
</P>
<P>
According to Tan, the PAL will begin to make profit in 1999
when the company gradually implements its 4-billion-dollar
modernization program.

GUANGZHOU, June 3 (Xinhua) -- China burned 500 kilograms of
heroin and "ice" today in the town of Humen in Guangdong Province,

<HEADLINE> Syria: Mideast Peace Process Is Dead </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARIO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Syrian Foreign Minister Farouk
al-Shara has voiced his frustration with the peace process which
he said is dead because of insincerity on the Israeli side.
</P>
<P>
"At present there is literally no such thing as a Mideast peace
process," Shara said in an Egyptian TV program aired today.
</P>
<P>
He said in the interview that the Israeli government does not
seem serious in re-starting the peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
"Syria believes that the peace process must be regarded as a
whole package," he said, "It must be understood that no success
can be reached on one track while the other tracks are left in
failure."
</P>
<P>
Peace negotiations between Israel and Syria started in 1991 but
were frozen since last February after a spate of suicide bombings
in Israel blamed on Palestinian extremists.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the Palestinian-Israeli talks have plunged
into crisis since March when Israel broke ground for a new Jewish
settlement in the disputed Arab East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Syria has demanded a pan-Arab summit to make resolute decisions
to confront Israel's hardline policies and boycott any regional and
multilateral cooperation that involves the Jewish state.
</P>
<P>
"Though the Arabs' peace talks with Israel take the bilateral
shape, none of the Arab negotiating parties nor any of the Arab
countries would ever accept anything short of a comprehensive
peace," Shara told the Egyptian TV.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the tension in the area to the failure to
establish a just and all-out peace based on international
legitimacy and the principle of trading land for peace.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian foreign minister criticized Israel for demanding to
start talks with the Syrians from scratch.
</P>
<P>
"Syria insists that Syrian and Israeli negotiators pick up from
where they left off," he said. "Its stand is unanimously backed by
the Arab and world communities and the co-sponsors of the peace
march," he said.
</P>
<P>
It is impossible to strike out five years of negotiations and
forget about all achieved steps, he said.
</P>
<P>
He warned that Israel's refusal to commit itself to its
previous obligations would give the opportunity to others to
follow its example in the future.
</P>
<P>
"This would be very serious because it would mean that any
party can go back on its commitments at any time in the future,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Syria said it will not return to the negotiating table with the
Israelis unless they first agree to pull out of the Golan Heights,
captured by the Jewish state in 1967.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu rejects the demand,
saying that the strategic plateau is vital to Israel. But his
predecessors, Labor Party leaders reportedly verbally accepted an
Israeli withdrawal from the Golan in return for normalized ties
with Syria.
</P>
<P>
Syrian Vice President Abdul-Halim Khaddam and al-Shara arrived
here Monday morning on a lightning visit to hold talks with
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first country to make peace with the Jewish state,
has been one of the key mediators in the peace process.

<HEADLINE> Cyprus Protests Turkish Violations of Air Space </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Cypriot government will protest
to the United Nations and other international fora against new
Turkish violations of Cyprus' air space, Government Spokesman
Manolis Christofides said here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at his daily press briefing, Christofides revealed
that three Turkish F4-fighters intruded into Cyprus' air space
today.
</P>
<P>
"Turkey has opted to go down the road of provocative moves and
violation of international law and order," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated the government's resolve "to stick to an earlier
decision on a halt of overflights of Greek military aircraft over
Cyprus ahead of direct talks between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
sides."
</P>
<P>
This decision, he pointed out, "is part of our established
policy to show good will and create the right atmosphere for
these talks, expected to take place in New York in early July."
</P>
<P>
The U.N. has sponsored proximity talks between the Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sides for the past two months in an effort to
create the right atmosphere for the U.N.-proposed direct talks
between leaders of the two communities on the island.
</P>
<P>
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan will soon issue invitations
to the two community's leaders for face-to-face negotiations in
searching for a comprehensive solution to the protracted problem
of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported earlier that two Turkish patrol boats
violated Monday night Cyprus' territorial waters, off the island's
southeastern coast.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that that violation, and today's illegal air
activity are "part of Turkey's continuous provocative action."
</P>
<P>
The Cyprus problem has remained unsolved since 1974 when the
island was divided after the Turkish troops invaded and took
control of its northern third in the wake of a short-lived coup
seeking union with Greece.

<P>
YANGON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A two-day workshop on Myanmar-Japan
economic cooperation, jointly organized by respective bilateral
economic committees of the two countries, ended here today after
discussions on ways and means to enhance such cooperation.
</P>
<P>
It was the first of its kind ever held in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
The Japan-Myanmar Economic Committee comprises 65 leading
industrialists while the Myanmar-Japan Economic Committee is
formed by officials of the Ministry of National Planning and
Economic Development.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan's Chamber of Commerce and Industry (CCL)
reached a memorandum of understanding here with its Myanmar
counterpart in April to enhance its investment and cooperation in
the country.
</P>
<P>
Japan's investment in Myanmar amounted to over 192 million U.S.
dollars in 13 permitted projects out of a total foreign investment
of over 6 billion dollars from 21 countries and regions at the end
of March this year, according to the latest official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Japan, a major donor to Myanmar in the past, is also a major
creditor nation for the country, which has debts up to 400 billion
yen (about 3.3 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to a latest official report, the Japanese government
extended to Myanmar today for the 18th time a grant-in-aid of 2
billion yen (about 16 million dollars), to be used for debt

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A seminar on "The Book of Changes
and Fortune-telling" held by the China Association for Science and
Technology opened in Beijing today to discuss a 3,000-year-old
Chinese philosophy classic.
</P>
<P>
Attending were sociologists, psychologists, religious study
people, historians, and experts on the Book of Changes, with Gong
Yuzhi, vice-president of the Party School of the Communist Party
of China Central Committee, chairing the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The classic work and its status in Chinese culture is still a
controversial issue in Chinese academies.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Bokun, a Philosophy Department professor at Beijing
University and an expert on the work, said that some people have
confused the study of the Book of Changes with fortune telling by
saying that fortune telling is the main function of the
book. "This viewpoint has caused great confusion in the
development of traditional culture and it must be clarified," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Participants pointed out that fortune telling is the product of
the age of barbarism and can not withstand scientific scrutiny,
and that, in studying the Book of Changes, what should be
maintained is its good tradition, especially its dialectical mode
of thinking. They asked the government to halt superstitious
activities.

<HEADLINE> Japan Adopts New Disaster Prevention Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan today adopted a new disaster
prevention program designed to have a quick response to any major
accidents and natural calamities in the future.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese government was widely criticized for its slow
response to pleas for help from local governments following the
Hanshin earthquake on January 17, 1995, which killed more
than 6,000 people.
</P>
<P>
Under the new program, which was revised in July 1995 after the
Hanshin earthquake, the supply of running water will be curbed in
the case of a nuclear power accident and a special task force will
be set up to fight oil spills at sea, Kyodo News reported.
</P>
<P>
The measures outlined in the program represent Japan's first
package of steps to deal with accidents in eight areas -- sea,
aviation, railway, highway, nuclear power, dangerous materials,
large fires and forest fires.
</P>
<P>
The program was adopted at a meeting attended by Prime Minister
Ryutaro Hashimoto and his cabinet, the heads of the Bank of Japan,
the Japanese Red Cross and Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corp..
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told the meeting that disaster prevention is one of
his government's key objectives.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Foreign Investors Bullish over HK's Future(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Recent surveys show that Hong
Kong is still "the best place to do business" in the eyes of
foreign investors, with most of them choosing to expand investment
or continue business as usual after the handover.
</P>
<P>
A latest survey conducted by the British Chamber of Commerce in
Hong Kong showed that 93 percent of British companies will be
operating here in the year 2000 and 70 percent will expand
business. Only 7 percent said they are unsure.
</P>
<P>
Most British companies believed that after the handover the
business climate will remain unchanged, and in certain aspects --
such as access to the Chinese mainland and trade links between
China and Britain -- will even improve, according to the chairman
of the chamber, Patrick Paul.
</P>
<P>
Britain is currently the largest investor in Hong Kong with an
accumulated investment of 40 billion U.S. dollars, followed by
Japan with 14.3 billion U.S. dollars and the United States with 12
billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
British Senior Trade Commissioner in Hong Kong Francis Cornish
said that Hong Kong, after the handover, will be a place full of
opportunities, with the complement of buoyant stock and property
markets, recovered retail sales and improved employment, in
addition to an easy access to the huge market of inland areas.
</P>
<P>
Like their British counterparts, American companies have also
been playing an active role in the town. To them, Hong Kong's
return to China is definitely not an interruption.
</P>
<P>
According to Frank Martin, president of the American Chamber of
 Commerce (AmCham) in Hong Kong, American companies will increase
investment year by year both in Hong Kong and on the Chines inland
areas.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on some Western media reports depicting a gloomy
picture of post-handover Hong Kong, Martin stressed that their
effect on the business sector, if there is any, is very limited.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that results of this year's AmCham confidence
survey, to be published in October, will be similar to those of
last year, that is, some 95 percent of AmCham member companies
will continue their investment in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The 1996 AmCham business confidence survey showed that a record
high of 95 percent consider Hong Kong's business environment up to
2001 as "very favorable" or "favorable".
</P>
<P>
In the next three years, 53 percent plan to expand business and
42 percent will continue "business as usual". Among the 457
companies that maintain regional headquarters in Hong Kong, 46
percent will expand.
</P>
<P>
AmCham is the largest U.S. chamber of commerce outside the
United States, grouping some 1,100 American companies. It has
conducted the annual confidence survey since 1990.
</P>
<P>
Japan's Consul General in Hong Kong, Hideaki Ueda, said that
Hong Kong's handover to China is a great event either to the
Asia-Pacific region or to the whole world and that Japan's
confidence in Hong Kong is manifest with the rapidly growing
economic and trade linkage between the two economies.
</P>
<P>
Out of a total of 182 licensed banks operating in Hong Kong, 43
are Japanese-funded with their combined capital accounting for 45
percent of all the banks here put together.

<HEADLINE> Pak Concerned over Deployment of Missiles by India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan today expressed its
"serious concern" over India's deployment of medium-range
ballistic Prithvi missiles near Pakistan's borders, saying it
reserved its right to take necessary measures for its security.
</P>
<P>
"The deployment of Prithvi missiles entails a qualitative
change in the security environment in South Asia and could trigger
a dangerous ballistic arms race in the region," said a Foreign
Office official here today.
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had made a proposal for a zero missile zone regime in
South Asia, said the official, adding that it "reserves the right
to take necessary measures to safeguard its security".
</P>
<P>
Pakistan had in the past also drawn the attention of the
international community to India's intentions of deploying this
missile which can carry weapons of mass destruction, he said.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Business News, a Honk Kong-based TV, reported today
that the missiles have reportedly been moved to a location near
the city of Jullundur in the state of Punjab in Northwest India.
This is the first operational deployment of the missile, it added.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Agency Calls for Greenhouse Gas Curbs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Japan's Environmental Agency today
criticized the government for failing to do enough to curb carbon
dioxide emissions and other gases blamed for causing global
warming.
</P>
<P>
The agency also called for legislation to regulate greenhouse
gas emissions and set up an environment tax.
</P>
<P>
It said the government's energy policy should shift its
priority away from securing a stable supply of energy to cutting
carbon dioxide emissions.
</P>
<P>
In its 1997 annual report, the agency called on the government
to draft legislation to set out fuel efficiency standards for
vehicles, impose taxes on carbon dioxide emissions and promote
garbage-fuel generators so as to prevent further global warming.
</P>
<P>
The agency also called on Japanese people to adopt a more
environmentally friendly lifestyle, even if it caused
inconvenience, for the sake of future generations and the Earth's
environment.
</P>
<P>
The appeal came against the background of an 8.3 percent
increase in carbon dioxide emissions in Japan in fiscal 1995 over
the previous year, casting doubt on whether Japan can meet a
non-binding target for keeping greenhouse gas emissions at 1990
levels by 2000 set by the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate
Change.
</P>
<P>
Japan will host a third conference of the signatory nations to
the climate change convention, which was first signed at the Rio
De Janeiro Earth summit in Brazil in 1992 and came into force in
1994.
</P>
<P>
The conference is to be held in the western city of Kyoto in
December, bringing together more than 150 signatory states to
adopt a protocol on a legally binding reduction in carbon dioxide
emissions after 2000.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Foreign Investors Bullish Over HK's Future(2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
According to the HK Industry Department's 1996 survey of
external investment in Hong Kong's manufacturing industries,
Japanese investment topped the list with roughly 40 percent of the
total.
</P>
<P>
An international school was set up earlier this year for
children of an increasing number of Japanese nationals working
here.
</P>
<P>
Apart from Britain, the U.S. and Japan, the European Union,
Australia and Asian countries also cast a vote of confidence for
Hong Kong, expecting Hong Kong to preserve all the factors
contributing to her past miracle.
</P>
<P>
For French companies, the 1997 factor has positively affected
their investment strategy, with 90 percent planning to expand
business here, according to a latest survey by the French Business
Association in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Australia's Consul General in Hong Kong Geoff Walsh believed
that the territory has been, and will continue to be, a window for
China, thanks to its advanced financial services, transportation
and communications facilities.
</P>
<P>
Businessmen from India, Malaysia, South Africa and other
countries also chose to maintain their presence here in the belief
that the handover will bring them more opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics showed that the number of foreign companies
operating in Hong Kong has been on the rise steadily. Of the 4,500
foreign companies operating here, about 40 percent rushed in
within the past five years. And this year will probably see an 8
percent increase over last year in the number of foreign companies
setting up regional headquarters or offices here.
</P>
<P>
Foreign companies have every reason to put their money in the
city, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
In the transitional year, Hong Kong beat over 100 rivals,
including Singapore and the United States, to be the freest
economy around the globe. It is the fourth consecutive time that
Hong Kong won the title in an international survey on economic
freedom.
</P>
<P>
U.S. credit rating agency Standard &AMP; Poor's also underlined its
confidence in post-handover Hong Kong by lifting its ratings on
Hong Kong and China.
</P>
<P>
Several days later, a report entitled World Economic Outlook,
published by the International Monetary Fund, upgraded Hong Kong
from a developing economic entity to an advanced economic entity,
in a signal to recognize the city's sophisticated financial
services, economic diversity and growing integration with the
vibrant economy on the Chinese mainland.
</P>
<P>
And there are also persuasive figures. At the end of May, the
Hong Kong government announced that Hong Kong's economic growth
bounced back to 6 percent in the first quarter of this year, the
highest for a period of two years.

<HEADLINE> ASEAN Concerned Over Situation in Cambodia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Foreign Minister
Abdullah Ahmad Badawi said today the Association of Southeast
Asian Nations (ASEAN) is concerned over what's happening in
Cambodia, fearing that it may affect the region's stability.
</P>
<P>
Abdullah, who is also ASEAN Standing Committee chairman,
expressed the hope that the disputing parties in Cambodia will
sort out their differences in the interest of the country's peace
and stability.
</P>
<P>
"What's happening in Cambodia is an internal matter... we
cannot intervene in domestic matters. Nevertheless, ASEAN is
concerned over what's happening as we fear it may affect the
region's stability," he told reporters here.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came after political tension flared up within the
Cambodian government.
</P>
<P>
Cambodia along with Myanmar and Laos will be formally admitted
into the ASEAN in July this year as decided by ASEAN foreign
ministers at their one-day special meeting here on May 31.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN now groups Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, the
Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
ASEAN countries could still advise feuding leaders in that
country to resolve their differences, Abdullah added.
</P>
<P>
He said Malaysia is adopting an advisory approach as it has
substantial investments in Cambodia, believing Cambodian leaders
will understand Malaysia's approach as it will be wise of them to
bury the hatchet.
</P>
<P>
The minister also advised Malaysian investors in Cambodia to
monitor the developments to assess whether they want to invest
there or otherwise.

<HEADLINE> HK Sees Growth of Consumer Goods Exports to Taiwan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's exports of consumer
goods to Taiwan have experienced phenomenal growth since 1990 in
tandem with the opening of Taiwan's import market, according to a
market report released today by the Hong Kong Trade Development
Council (TDC).
</P>
<P>
The report said the most remarkable growth was seen in
footwear, followed by apparel, jewelry and toys.
</P>
<P>
Market penetration of Hong Kong's consumer goods is high,
especially of those products for which Hong Kong suppliers have
established a strong presence in Taiwan. The import market share
of T-shirts, singlets and other goods from Hong Kong was about 50
percent, and that of jewelry was 37 percent in 1995, according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
Since the 1980s, Taiwan has gradually opened up its consumer
market to imports and overseas participation. After several rounds
of tariff cuts, the average nominal import tariff rate has been
reduced from over 20 percent to the present 6.52 percent. As a
result, imports grew at an average annual rate of 15.4 percent
between 1986 and 1996.
</P>
<P>
The report said that both Hong Kong and Japanese groups are now
major players in Taiwan's retail sector. However, as the market is
set to become increasingly competitive, Hong Kong suppliers should
further enhance their strengths in order to stay ahead of the
pack, it said.

<HEADLINE> Soccer Star Grobbelaar Sets for Retrial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Bruce Grobbelaar, John Fashanu and
Hans Segers will go on trial on Wednesday for the second time on
charges of fixing English premier league matches.
</P>
<P>
The first trial, which lasted for eight weeks ended on March 4
when the jury failed to reach a verdict on any of the charges.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean-born Grobbelaar, who won six league titles with
Liverpool, fellow goalkeeper Segers and retired striker Fashanu,
as well as Malaysian businessman Heng Suan Lim, all denied the
charges.
</P>
<P>
The four will appear in Winchester for giving and accepting
money to influence the outcome of soccer matches.
</P>
<P>
If convicted, they could face sentences of up to seven years in
jail and unlimited fines.
</P>
<P>
The case was triggered by media allegations in November 1994
about the activities of an Asian betting syndicate in English
soccer.
</P>
<P>
The case is the first of its kind since three players from
Sheffield Wednesday were imprisoned for four months in 1964 and
banned from soccer for life from fixing a match.
</P>
<P>
Grobbelaar, 39, moved to Southampton from Liverpool and now
plays for second division Plymouth.
</P>
<P>
Dutchman Segers, 35, played a few games last season for
non-league Woking while Fashanu, 33, who made his name with
Wimbledon, retired with a knee injury shortly after moving to
Aston Villa in 1994.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Likely to Resort to Imports to Fight Fuel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Nigieran government is likely to once
again adopt the emergency measure of fuel importation for an immediate
solution to the persistent scarcity in the country.
</P>
<P>
The latest round of fuel crisis in the leading African oil
producing country has lasted for about two weeks, reducing commercial
activities especially in the nation's economic nerve center of Lagos
where transporters have hiked fares by about 200 percent.
</P>
<P>
As respite from the fuel scarcity still looks remote, officials of
the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) and the Ministry of
Petroleum Resources might soon meet with Presidency officials on the
matter, the Vanguard reported today.
</P>
<P>
The local daily quoted a highly-placed source close to the ministry
as attributing the fuel crisis to the inadequate of government
allocation of crude oil to the nation's four refineries.
</P>
<P>
According to a government policy, crude oil produced for domestic
consumption this year should be 250,000 barrels per day compared to
the usual 500,000 barrels in order to avoid wastages and have budget
surplus.
</P>
<P>
"As at today there are no reserve stocks at the various
refineries," the source said, adding that the present situation was
bound to worsen by the time Kaduna Refinery in northern Nigeria begins
turn around maintenance next month.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the best thing for the government to do is to
import fuels, which the NNPC has been advocating since the beginning
of the year.
</P>
<P>
The NNPC is responsible for overseeing the country's production and
supply of crude oil and related commodities.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The latest environmental monitoring
bulletin reports that the Three Gorges reservoir area along the
middle reaches of the Yangtze River is maintaining an acceptable
ecological balance.
</P>
<P>
According to the bulletin released today by the Three Gorges
Construction Commission under the State Council and the State
Bureau of Environmental Protection, the Three Gorges project did
not have direct impact on the area's natural ecology, local
economy, and resettlement of residents in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The construction did destroy previous vegetation and caused
soil losses to some extent. But with accelerating restoration
efforts, the vegetation will soon improve, the bulletin says.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin indicates that practical technology for enhancing
ecological agriculture, public health promotion mechanisms, and
environmental protection measures, in the construction areas have
played an important role in maintaining good local ecological
conditions.
</P>
<P>
To further step up efforts of environmental protection, the
commission and the bureau announced today that comprehensive
ecological and environmental monitorings in the Three Gorges area
had begun.
</P>
<P>
The monitoring network will cover resettlement, quality of
water, pollution sources, hydrology, regional climate, mountain
disasters, fish and aquatic creatures, land animals and plants,
health of people, agricultural ecology, and social environment.
</P>
<P>
Monitoring will be carried out along the entire process of
project, and bulletins will be publicized on a regular basis,
officials said.

<P>
CANBERRA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar ended today
on a slightly firmer note amid speculation over a possible easing
of official interest rates in the short term while bond prices
also closed higher.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank of Australia held its monthly board meeting
today and some players suggested the central bank could ease
policy as early as tomorrow morning.
</P>
<P>
However, other analysts believed this was unlikely as it would
be so close to the last rate cut on May 23 when the bank lowered
the official cash rate to 5.5 percent from 6.0 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Australian dollar ended at 75.96 US cents, up from 75.85 at
the previous local close.
</P>
<P>
Offshore last night the Australian dollar traded to a high of
76.08 US cents during the London session and fell to as low as
75.66 in New York.
</P>
<P>
On the cross-rates, the Australian dollar ended stronger. It
was at 88.21 from 88.13 against the Japanese yen, and at 1.3127
from 1.2992 against German mark.

</P>
<P>
Regional situation is also among the topics of the meeting

Marshal Abdul Hafez Marei Kaabneh and Commander Jefferson Hawl
from the U.S. Central Command which is in charge of the U.S.

</P>
<P>
The current 4-week long war game is code-named "Infinite

conducted Saturday in the desert 80 kilometers south of Amman,
rallying about 2,500 soldiers and featuring helicopters, jet
fighters as well as heavy and light weapons.
</P>
<P>
The war game is part of the military coordination between
Jordan and the U.S., which granted the former the title of
non-North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) ally last year to
make Jordan legible for military assistance.
</P>

Last December, Jordan received a 100 million U.S. dollars

<P>
PARIS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The Socialist leader Lionel Jospin, who will form his
government within one week, is faced with of hot issues such as
the revision of the budget, freezing the privatization of state
enterprises, the dispute over Renault automaker's closing down of
its Vilvoorde plant in Belgium and a record high unemployment rate.
</P>
<P>
-- The German government, which is facing a serious budgetary
problem to attain the criteria set by the Maastricht treaty to
qualify for the European single currency, is worried about the
conditions presented by the new French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin for the launching of the Euro.
</P>
<P>
Jospin has called for a flexible interpretation of the
Maastricht treaty, the admission of Italy and Spain into the
monetary union in the first wave, and the inclusion in the
Maastricht treaty of a pact on employment rather than a pact of
stability Bonn wanted.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Alain Juppe today formally handed over the
prime minister's seat to Socialist Party first secretary Lionel
Jospin.
</P>
<P>
The Socialist Party leaders held a closed-door meeting Monday
at the residence of Jospin to discuss the forming of the
government. The Communist Party presented its proposals on
economic and social policies for the new government and was
waiting for a "concrete response" from Jospin before accepting to
enter the new government.
</P>
<P>
-- The victory of the French left in the legislative election
and the nomination of Lionel Jospin as prime minister were well
received by the French financial market. The Paris Bourse closed
Monday with a 0.68 percent rise of its CAC 40 index, while the
French franc stayed firm in exchange rate with the German mark.

<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are business briefs
from Middle East countries:
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- Progress has been made in the negotiations on
Egypt-European Union (EU) partnership, with the two sides having
agreed on almost 90 percent of the agreement's clauses, Egypt's
Ambassador to Belgium and the EU Mohamed Shaaban said today.
</P>
<P>
After nine rounds of negotiations since January 1995, Egypt and
the EU are finally edging near a partnership, Shaaban told the
Cairo-based Voice of Arab radio in an interview.
</P>
<P>
But he did not specify where lies the other 10 percent of the
difference, which might be vital for clinching the deal.
</P>
<P>
Egypt accused the EU of imposing interests at its expense by
giving European manufactures free access to the Egyptian markets
but keeping quotas on exports of Egyptian food.
</P>
<P>
Europe, which receives 47 percent of Egyptian exports, is
Egypt's major trading partner, according to Shaaban.
</P>
<P>
The ambassador said Egypt's political weight in the region also
avails a speedy conclusion of the economic association accord
which will provide for establishing a free trade zone between them
by the year 2010.
</P>
<P>
Shaaban called on the industrial sector to prepare itself before
the signing of the Egypt-EU Partnership Agreement, to improve the
quality of the Egyptian product and to protect it in the European
market.
</P>
<P>
Egypt still fears that its own products, which are relatively
inferior in quality and price, are blocked from reaching the EU
markets.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Federal Express (FedEx), the world's largest
express transport company, has begun regular flights between the
U.S. and Tel Aviv, reported The Jerusalem Post Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
FedEx uses its own Boeing 727 all-cargo aircraft to fly to and
from Israel four times a week.
</P>
<P>
David Bronczek, the company's senior vice president for Europe,
the Middle East and Africa, noted Monday that the decision to
upgrade service to Israel comes as a result of the international
business company's interest in the growing economy in Israel.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Israel's exports of polished diamonds for the
January-May period this year totaled 1.82 billion U.S. dollars,
an 8 percent increase over the same period last year, reported The
Jerusalem Post Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Polished-diamond exports rose 14.5 percent last month to 405
million dollars from 354 million in May last year.
</P>
<P>
Exports of unpolished diamonds rose 42 percent last month to 73
million from 51 million in May last year.
</P>
<P>
For the January-May period, exports of raw diamonds rose to
430 million from 288 million in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
In the January-May period, 47 percent of the exports were to
the U.S., 19 percent were to Hong Kong, 14 percent to Japan and 12
percent to Belgium.
</P>
<P>
JERUSALEM -- Turkey will soon begin implementing the free-trade
agreement with Israel, reported local newspapers, quoting Turkish
Ambassador Barlas Ozener as saying.
</P>
<P>
Although bureaucratic delays made Turkey not able to adhere to
the original May 1 implementation date, Ozener said the deal is
currently circulating among the 40 ministers who have to sign it,
and he hopes free trade will begin "within the next few days."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, both sides are requiring importers to sign bank
guarantees in case the deal does not get passed.
</P>
<P>
The agreement is designed to increase trade between the two
countries. Bilateral trade totaled 500 million U.S. dollars in
1995.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan has instructed all its embassies around the
world to offer investment and economic services to foreign
businessmen soon to help the country's economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
All the embassies are also obliged to provide the necessary
facilities to foreign private sector delegations coming to Jordan,
said Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh quoted in local press today.
</P>
<P>
The embassies are especially urged to provide services such as
hotel reservations, hiring cars, hosting receptions, fixing
appointments for delegations and establishing a follow-up
mechanism on a case-by-case basis, the minister told a meeting
with the representatives of trade and industry chambers here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Major recovering steps by Jordan include drawing foreign
investment, establishing the Aqaba free trade zone and further
developing sectoral economy such as tourism, phosphate production
and pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
Before the Gulf crisis (1990-1991), Jordan, although scant of
natural resources, had a flourishing economy thanks to a great
amount of aid from various resources.
</P>
<P>
But most aid from other Arab states and the West were stopped
because Jordan sided with Iraq who invaded Kuwait after the war,
making the economy going down. By the end of 1996, its foreign
debt equaled to 90 percent of its gross national product.

the civilian government about eight days ago.
</P>
<P>
Most of the dead had their limbs and faces mutilated and
hundreds are said to have been injured.

the Red Cross (ICRC) freed over 1,000 people including foreign
journalists who were trapped in fighting after the seaside hotel
was partially destroyed.
</P>
<P>
The Sierra Leonean army is holding a number of Nigerian
soldiers. The S.Leonean military government has given an
ultimatum for all Nigerian troops to leave Sierra Leone by
Tuesday, warning that the order ''will be rigorously enforced.''

<HEADLINE> Splinter Group of Ethnic Party Surrenders in Myanmar </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- One hundred and fifty members of a
breakaway group of the New Mon State Party (NMSP), a former
anti-government ethnic armed group in Myanmar, have surrendered to
the government last weekend.
</P>
<P>
Official sources said today that the splinter group of the NMSP
-- the Beik Mon Army (BMA) led by its battalion commander Aung
Thaik Hym -- "traded their arms for peace" on May 31 in the Beik
area of Mon State, turning in 470 assorted weapons.
</P>
<P>
The BMA broke away from the NMSP led by Naing Shwe Kyin in
November 1996 after the NMSP returned to the legal fold in June
1995 due to inter-party differences, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
More BMA members, stationed across the border, are expected to
follow suit, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Altogether 16 ethnic armed groups as well as former drug
warlord Khun Sa's Mong Tai Army (MTA) have returned to the legal
fold in Myanmar, leaving the only largest one -- the Kayin
National Union -- still in operation on the Myanmar-Thai border.

<HEADLINE> Model Steel, Iron Company Setting New Goal (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The success of the Handan Iron and Steel Company has inspired
state-owned enterprises still suffering from economic losses to
take reform measures.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 people from across the country came to
Handan Iron and Steel Company to study the successful experience
or attend training courses there from 1992 to 1996, according to
Chairman Liu Hanzhang.
</P>
<P>
Liu, also mastermind of the experiment, explained his company
has been practising the method of deciding on production costs by
first taking market prices into account, replacing the traditional
way of first calculating production costs and expected profits,
and then setting market prices, which had been popular under the
planned economic mode.
</P>
<P>
Through the use of this simulating method, a market mechanism
has been introduced into the interior management of an enterprise,
making every employee directly feel the pressure of market
competition, and enabling them to become market-aware and
eventually to take the initiative to participate in market
competition, Liu went on.
</P>
<P>
Before this, state-owned enterprises had been operating under a
plan that included pre-set production costs and prices; and
pulling along in early 1980s by calculating profits in advance,
with enterprises authorized to independently market five percent
of their respective output.
</P>
<P>
In the 1990s, state-owned enterprises were put to face the
market more directly by themselves and were given the right to
control selling 95 percent of their output.
</P>
<P>
The Handan Iron and Steel Company has grown into one of China's
18 to enterprises and increased the value of its total assets from
2.2 billion yuan to 8.83 billion yuan. State-owned assets of the
company have multiplied by 8.2 times and has brought down the
ratio of debt to assets from 70 percent to 39.22 percent.
</P>
<P>
As the new goal is set, the Handan Iron and Steel Company,
which primarily turns out steel used as building materials, still
has to work very hard to attain it, said Liu.
</P>
<P>
He added that his company will strive to catch up with the
Baoshan Iron and Steel Company of Shanghai, Shoudu Iron and Steel
Company of Beijing, two iron and steel production giants in
China.

<HEADLINE> Model Steel, Iron Company Sets New Goal (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANDAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Handan Iron and Steel Company of
north China's Hebei Province plans to earn over 10 billion yuan
from sales annually by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hanzhang, chairman of the company's board, made known his
company's new goal during an interview with Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
The Handan Iron and Steel Company, cited as a model enterprise
in China, produces steel sheets, as well as wire stock, steel
bars, and structural steel, with technology imported from Germany
and equipment imported from France.
</P>
<P>
The once little-known Handan Iron and Steel Complex, which is
state-owned enterprise, has transformed itself from a money-losing
enterprise into a big profit maker.
</P>
<P>
Founded in 1958, the Handan Iron and Steel Company with a work
force of 28,000, had been on a losing streak until 1990. After
replacing its method of counting costs and working out expected
interest levels before setting prices for its products, the
company was able to fix acceptable market prices, and work out its
own definitive production costs.
</P>
<P>
If a production unit, overran production costs, it was seen as
failing to make a profit, thus affecting bonuses and wages for its
employees. If workers reduced both production costs and market
prices, they were rewarded.
</P>
<P>
The method has worked. The complex netted in 700 million yuan
of profits in 1996, compared to only one million yuan in 1990. It
used to suffer losses in 26 of the 28 kinds of rolled steel it
produced. But in 1995, it ranked second among the country's 45
iron and steel companies in terms of comprehensive economic
performance.
</P>
<P>
After the success of the Handan experiment, state-owned
enterprises have been urged to learn how to thrive in a
competitive market from the Handan company's operations as the
country is trying to invigorate its state-owned enterprises.

<HEADLINE> EU Publishes Report on Women's Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Women in the European Union (EU)
countries enjoy a high level of health and their average life
expectancy has reached 80 years, six years higher than the average
for men, an EU report said today.
</P>
<P>
The report on the state of women's health in the EU member
countries, was published by the European Commission, the EU's
executive body.
</P>
<P>
The report said that many EU women still die prematurely before
the age of 65 due to accidents or diseases, such as cancer or
cardiovascular disease, which to a large extent can be avoided by
healthier life styles or early detection.
</P>
<P>
The two largest causes of death among women are diseases of the
circulatory system, which account for 43 percent of all deaths,
and cancer which accounts for 26 percent.
</P>
<P>
EU Commissioner Padraig Flynn today said that the report was
not intended to imply that greater emphasis should be placed on
women's health compared to men's health.
</P>
<P>
But for biological, social and other reasons, it deserves
recognition that women's health concerns differ from those of men,
he added.

and financial hub.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's stand on the reverting of Hong Kong to China is
expected to enhance Sino-Malaysian ties, Malaysian Foreign
Minister Abdullah Ahmad Badawi told the National Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Talking to reporters later about Malaysia-Hong Kong relations,
the minister said the ties will remain unchanged when China
resumes the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong on July 1.
</P>
<P>
He said the assurance was given to him by his Chinese
counterpart during his recent visit to China.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Chinese foreign minister had told him
that there would be no problems for Malaysians to visit Hong Kong
for trade and investment missions.
</P>
<P>
"Our previous privileges will be continued," he said, adding
that the Malaysian government however has not decided on the
travel documents of Malaysians wishing to visit Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
"With the change in Hong Kong's status which will be known as
the Special Administrative Region of the People's Republic of
China, immigration matters will depend on our relations with
China," he said.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia's commission office in Hong Kong will be known as the
consulate-general from July 1, he said.

<HEADLINE> Two-thirds Ugandan Women Prefer Local Traditional </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Seventy percent of Ugandan women
prefer local traditional medicine and about 50 percent of them
select to deliver in health facilities, ''The New Vision''
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Treatment cost in modern medical facilities lay too high to
access for poor which wemen are consisting the denied majority
of, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
As a result of lack of fees, wemen have to learn to ignore
their suffering in endemic cases such as malaria and TB, the
report added.
</P>
<P>
Poor relationship also separates patients and modern medical
staff,medical professor Willy Anokbonggo of Makerere University
told a workshop in central Mukono District.
</P>
<P>
Traditional healers show more consideration for women then the
modern health workers, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Carol Vlassof, Manager of the special program for research and
training in tropical diseases, noted that famele patients were
often blamed for being late in reporting their cases by health
workers who didn't find out why.
</P>
<P>
The fame of modern medicine also eroded by the fact that in
some cases, treatment is forced to be stoped by the financial
burden, and inadequate information regarding the dosage and
results in the recureence of certain ailments, the report said.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Indian Prime Minister I. K.
Gujral is scheduled to visit Nepal from June 5 for enhancing
cooperation between the two countries, official sources said here
today.
</P>
<P>
The three-day visit, the first by an Indian prime minister in
the past five years, assumes significance as India and Nepal would
exchange the instrument of ratification of the Mahakali Treaty
concerning the integrated development of the Mahakali River
flowing over the two neighboring countries. The treaty was signed
by the two countries last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the treaty, India will supply 300 cusecs of water from
Tanakpur in Uttar Pradesh in the dry season and 70 million units
of power to Nepal free of charge.
</P>
<P>
Gujral is also expected to sign a power trade agreement with
Nepal during his visit. Nepal, which has the potential of 83,000
mw of hydropower, has signed an umbrella agreement with India
selling its power to India.
</P>
<P>
Gujral will meet Nepalese King Birendra and hold talks with his
Nepalese counterpart, Lokendra B. Chand, on the two countries'
relations. The two countries are also expected to expand their
cooperation in other fields, the same sources said.

<HEADLINE> HK's Fund Management Industry Mainly Driven by Overseas Investors: Survey </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Overseas clients accounted for
67.2 percent of the assets managed by 45 fund companies in Hong
Kong as at the end of 1996, according to a survey by the Hong Kong
Investment Funds Association (HKIFA).
</P>
<P>
By December 31, 1996, the total assets managed by HKIFA
members in Hong Kong had amounted to 101 billion US dollars,
according to the survey released here today.
</P>
<P>
Out of the total, Asia-Pacific (excluding Hong Kong) clients
accounted for about 20 percent of the total assets, while
non-Asia-Pacific clients took up 47.2 percent, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
"Unlike the United Sates, Britain and Japan where the growth of
the fund management industry has been primarily locally driven,
the development of the industry in Hong Kong has, hitherto, been
spurred by the demands of overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
"The key force that fosters the growth in Hong Kong has been
the demand by overseas clients, especially from Europe and North
America, for asset management services to capitalize on the growth
in the region," said Andrew Lo, Chairman of the HKIFA.
</P>
<P>
Among the key factors contributing to Hong Kong obtaining such
a position are, according to Lo, a free open market, respect and
pragmatic regulatory structure, professional and largely
non-interventionist regulation, a attractive tax regime,
well-developed infrastructure, abundant supply of personnel with
strong financial background and predominantly English-speaking.
</P>
<P>
And Hong Kong has been invited to host the International
Investment Funds Association conference this October. This is the
first time that the conference is to be held in Asia (outside
Japan) and it further reinforces the position of Hong Kong as a
major fund management center in Asia.

MACAO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A new coin which was put into
circulation on Monday has been left in the cold as most local
residents prefer banknotes to coins.
</P>
<P>
The 10-pataca coin, issued for the first time, was inconvenient
to carry along, many residents said.
</P>

With gold and silver colors on the face, the coin is bigger
than Hong Kong's 10-dollar coin. It depicts a church on one side
and the word "Macao" in Chinese and Portuguese on the other.
</P>
<P>
A total of 20 million pieces of the coin will be issued via the
Bank of China's Macao Branch and another note-issuing bank in the
territory.
</P>
<P>
Macao now has six kinds of coins, including 10 cents, 20 cents,
50 cents, 1 pataca, 5 patacas and 10 patacas.

<HEADLINE> EU Takes Tough Stance on Relations With Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The 15 foreign ministers of the
European Union member nations agreed Monday in Luxembourg to keep
their ambassadors away from Tehran unless Iran is ready to allow
all the envoys back.
</P>
<P>
They reached the decision at the ministers' monthly meeting.
The ambassadors they referred to also included the German and
Danish envoys who were told by Iran in April not to return.
</P>
<P>
The EU countries withdrew their ambassadors from Iran after a
German court ruling on April 10 that the Iranian government backed
the 1992 assassination of four Iranian dissidents in Berlin.
</P>
<P>
When the envoys decided to return to Tehran, Iran told the
German and Danish ambassadors to stay home, citing as reason what
it called their governments' anti-Iran views. None of the EU
envoys returned as a result.
</P>
<P>
The foreign ministers agreed that none would return to Tehran
as long as Iran was not ready to welcome back all the 15
EU ambassadors.

STOCKHOLM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Sweden was Europe's most avid
foreign investor, according to the latest statistical report of
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.
</P>
<P>
The 1997 edition of "OECD in Figures," based mainly on figures
from 1995, places Sweden in the first place in terms of investment
outflow, with the equivalent of 4.4 percent of its gross domestic
product (GDP) invested abroad.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Sweden ranked the fourth among 26 members of the
OECD in foreign investment, with 3.4 percent of its GDP placed
abroad.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, Sweden was also an attractive place for
foreign firms to place their money. In fact, the inflow of direct
investments to Sweden exceeded the outflow.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, foreigners placed an amount equivalent to 5.9 percent
of the Swedish GDP in this country, or 13.6 billion U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
However, the Swedish economy as a whole can hardly be described
as red-hot. The gross domestic product grew by only 1.3 percent
between 1985-1995.

<HEADLINE> Opium War TV Series to Be Broadcast Nationwide </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A 26-part TV series about Opium
War (1840-1842) will be broadcast first in Shanghai on June 17, to
greet Hong Kong's return to China by reproducing history on the
screen.
</P>
<P>
The TV series will then be broadcast by more than 200
television stations across the country.
</P>
<P>
The Opium War, launched by the British government in June, 1840
to protect the British opium trade in China, resulted in the
signing of the Treaty of Nanjing, which forced China to cede Hong
Kong to Britain.
</P>
<P>
The TV series portrays Lin Zexu's mission of banning opium in
south China, and the subsequent repeated trials of military
strength and diplomatic contests between China and Britain.
</P>
<P>
Lin Zexu (1785-1850), a Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) lord, was
appointed imperial envoy to stamp out the opium trade being
conducted by British merchants in south China in 1839. He led the
move to ban opium in Guangzhou city, and destroyed some 20,000
cases of opium seized from British traders.
</P>
<P>
Huang Jun, director of the TV series, said that the series is
different from other movies on the same topic. Emperor Dao Guang
(1821-1850), the sixth emperor of Qing Dynasty, is the focus of
the Huang's production, after Huang reviewed the War in light of
the latest historical research.
</P>
<P>
Li Baotian will act Emperor Dao Guang and Xu Huanshan will
play Lord Lin Zexu in the TV series.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong province, where the Opium War broke out, invested 16
million yuan (1.93 million U.S. dollars) in the series.

<HEADLINE> Canadians Vote for Continued Fiscal Prudence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Canadian voters today gave the
Liberal Party another mandate, sending a clear message that they
want the federal government to stay the course of fiscal prudence
and sound management.
</P>
<P>
The Liberal Party won 39 percent of the national vote and 155
seats out of the 301-member House of Commons, enough to form a
majority government.
</P>
<P>
The Reform won 61 seats, the Bloc Quebecois 44, the New
Democratic 20, the Progressive Conservative 20 and others 1.
</P>
<P>
Canadian voters tonight "renewed their confidence in our teams
and programs," a jubilant Jean Chretien said to his supporters in
his riding of Saint-Maurice, Quebec.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Liberal Party will "continue to put fiscal
house in order" as it has promised in the campaign, continuing to
create jobs and improve the economy by investing in industries
of the future.
</P>
<P>
Since the last election held on October 25, 1993, when
Chretien's Liberal Party won an overwhelming majority, the
government has introduced prudent fiscal measures to slash the
deficit from 42 billion Canadian dollars (30 billion U.S. dollars)
to just over 9 billion Canadian dollars (6.5 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
It has also successfully reduced inflation and interest rates
to their lowest levels in the past three decades.
</P>
<P>
All these have improved Canada's overall economic environment
and propelled foreign and domestic business investments in the
country.
</P>
<P>
According to a recent estimate by the International Monetary
Fund, Canada would see a strongest economic growth among the G-7
countries this year and the next.
</P>
<P>
Yet, the economic policy has also produced its side effects. At
present, some 1.5 million Canadians are still jobless despite the
fact that the Liberal government has helped to create more than
770,000 jobs since it took office.
</P>
<P>
Canada's social welfare has also been slashed, which partly
explained why the Liberal Party lost 23 seats this time in the
Atlantic provinces where people are affected the most.
</P>
<P>
The government owed a lot to Canadians for their sacrifices,
Chretien said, adding that "the light at the end of the tunnel is
growing brighter."
</P>
<P>
By voting the Liberals back to office, most Canadians also
seemed to endorse Chretien's step-by-step approach to the national
unity issue.
</P>
<P>
"We promised to keep our country strong and united, and that we
will do," Chretien said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Sierra Leonean President Ahmed Tejan
Kabbah on Monday spoke out against the military coup that had
toppled him, admitting that he requested the west African
peace-keeping force to intervene.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with a BBC program, Kabbah denounced the saying that
the it was irresponsible to ask for military action of ECOMOG,
west Africa's peacekeeping forces, in a very crowded and
overpopulated city.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Nigerian-led ECOMOG soldiers are
professionals and have been very selective and discrete in their
operations.
</P>
<P>
It was the Sierra Leonean rebels and coup soldiers who, in
their panic reactions, committed atrocities.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah said he was in regular contact with the Nigeria
authority and expected the intervention to be over pretty soon,
adding that he would return to his country afterwards.
</P>
<P>
He said he was pleased to hear that Secretary-General of the
United Nations, Kofi Annan, has given his support to the military
intervention.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah called the May 25 coup "a disgrace to Africa" and said
that the entire African continent was unhappy with it.
</P>
<P>
"While people are trying to move into the 21st century, some
of these guys are trying to drag us back to the 17th century.
This is not acceptable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Around 3,600 ECOMOG troops started attacks against the coup
soldiers led by Major Paul Johnny Koroma early Monday morning
upon the failure of diplomatic efforts to restore the elected
government of Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The ECOMOG troops soon seized the Lungi airport near Freetown.
Some 32 deaths have been reported so far in the fighting.

<HEADLINE> 62 Casualties Reported in Sierra Leonean </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The intervention by the west African
peace-keeping force known as ECOMOG in Sierra Leone has resulted
in 62 casualties in the first day of the operations.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said 32 people, including 30 civilians
and two soldiers were killed in the attacks which started in
early Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Amid continuous ECOMOG bombardment, Major Paul Johnny Koromah
reportedly came out in Freetown for the first time in an open
vehicle, waving a white hankerchief and urging his people to
demostrate their support in condmening the military invervention.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of Sierra Leoneans took to the street, protesting
the use of force by ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The intervention, however, won wide support at the on-going
33rd Organization of African Unity (OAU) summit.
</P>
<P>
Kofi Annan, the United Nations Secretary-General who was at
the summit, said, "The will of the people must be the basis of
government and authority in Africa. And governments duly elected
should not be overthrown by force."
</P>
<P>
Salim Ahmed Salim, who was re-elected into the OAU
Secretary-General at the summit, said the coup in Sierra Leone is
unacceptable.
</P>
<P>
"In the interest of both Sierra Leone and Africa as a whole,
everything must be done to restore constitutional legality in
that country," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, ECOMOG troops in Sierra Leone now totals
3,600, including 1,600 from Nigeria, 1,500 from Ghana and 500
from Guinea.

<HEADLINE> EU Anxious About French Policy on Monetary Union </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Foreign ministers of the European
Union (EU) countries, who were gathering in Luxembourg for a
monthly meeting, Monday expressed their cautious optimism towards
the prospects that the new Socialist government in France would
not derail the process of European integration.
</P>
<P>
The reserved optimism reflected uncertainty over where the new
French government was heading for given that Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin had rejected the austerity required for a single currency.
</P>
<P>
One senior EU official called the result potentially "very
dangerous," adding that if the Socialists "do what they say they
will do, it will create a threat to monetary union, or start it on
a very weak basis."
</P>
<P>
Most foreign ministers are waiting to see whom Jospin will
choose as French foreign minister, which is supposed to serve as
an indicator of French policies. The appointment is expected to be
announced later this week.
</P>
<P>
They are also hoping for clues to French policy from whether
Jospin will signal a willingness to conclude a treaty on EU reform
in two weeks in Amsterdam.
</P>
<P>
However, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini expressed his
personal satisfaction with the election results in France, saying
that the Socialist victory had increased the chances of a delay to
monetary union that would enable Rome to join a single currency at
the outset.
</P>
<P>
But Dini also said, "Italy will not be the country to demand a
change of the timetable," referring to the scheduled January 1999
launching date for the single currency euro.

<P>
LONDON, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items
in leading British newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
The Times:
</P>
<P>
-- British Prime Minister Tony Blair outlined plans Monday to
help the country's 800,000 jobless single parents through inviting
them to job centers for advice on childcare, training and skills
development.
</P>
<P>
Financial Times:
</P>
<P>
-- The French franc and the D-Mark tumbled on foreign exchange
markets Monday as investors bet that the French election result
and the German row over revaluation of gold reserves would lead to
a broadbased and weak European monetary union.
</P>
<P>
The Daily Telegraph:
</P>
<P>
-- Former British Prime Minister John Major said the
introduction of a single European currency should be delayed and
the government should seek to prevent other European Union
countries proceeding with a "fudged" version of monetary union in
18 months' time.
</P>
<P>
The Guardian:
</P>
<P>
-- Britain's Northern Ireland Security Minister, Adam Ingram,
said yesterday that the government was considering whether to
continue the dialogue with Sinn Fein after an attempted attack on
the army and police at the weekend in west Belfast.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Envoy to Brief U.S. on Shuttle Diplomacy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian envoy Osama el-Baz flew to
Washington this morning to meet U.S. officials on the deadlocked
Mideast peace process, the Egyptian MENA news agency reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Baz, political advisor to President Hosni Mubarak, is expected
to brief the U.S. administration on his latest shuttle trips to
mediate between the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) and Israel
in the past few days, diplomatic sources here said.
</P>
<P>
He has been mediating between the two sides in a bid to bring
them back to the negotiating table since Mubarak met Israeli Prime
Minister Binyamin Netanyahu in Egyptian Red Sea resort of Sharm
el-Sheikh last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"Egypt's role was not to present Egyptian proposals to the
Palestinian and Israeli sides but it sought to narrow the gap
between the parties in response to a request from the Palestinian
leadership," he told reporters Monday.
</P>
<P>
"There should be a movement to break the deadlock," Baz said,
expressing the hope that a breakthrough would be achieved in the
coming period.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians have made resumption of the peace talks
conditional on Israel's halt of Har Homa, a new Jewish settlement
Israel started to build in March sparking a two-month-old crisis
in the Mideast peace process. Netanyahu has refused to budge.
</P>
<P>
During his latest shuttle tour that ended Sunday, the Egyptian
envoy went to Israel to continue talks with Netanyahu and met
later with head of the Palestinian negotiating team Saeb Erekat.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu's office hailed "some progress" toward solving the
problems between the PNA and Israel at the meeting, but a
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) official who spoke on
condition of anonymity said "Baz did not get responses from the
Israeli side to Palestinian demand."
</P>
<P>
U.S. Ambassador to Egypt Edward Walker has reiterated Egypt's
pivotal role in pushing forward the Mideast peace process and
eliminating obstacles in the peace process.
</P>
<P>
Walker said Sunday the enormous Egyptian efforts were highly
respected and appreciated by the American and global public
opinions.
</P>
<P>
U.S. envoy Dennis Ross made two shuttle trips to the region
last month, but failed to bridge the gap between the Palestinian
and Israeli positions.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians accused Ross of pro-Israeli bias and called
for higher-level U.S. intervention. But Washington was
unresponsive. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright said last
weekend that it was up to the two parties to show the political
will to end the impasse themselves.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Jordan and Egypt both affirmed the importance of
the U.S. role in peacemaking.
</P>
<P>
Israel and Egypt, the first Arab country to make peace with
Israel in 1979, have been the two largest beneficiaries of the
U.S. aid.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Scholar Urges Halt to Concocting China as New Threat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A Harvard University scholar has
called for a halt to concocting China as a new threat, warning that
it will have "dangerous consequences for U.S. policy."
</P>
<P>
"China is a rising power, but it need not to be an enemy,"
Ezra F. Vogel, a Henry Ford professor of the social sciences and
director of the Fairbank Center at Harvard University, said in an
article in the International Herald Tribune last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Vogel said the reader of much of the U.S. press has little idea
on the fundamental changes taking place in China. But instead of
reporting China's progress, the U.S. media, including The New
Republic and The Weekly Standard, are trumpeting that China is
emerging as a great new threat.
</P>
<P>
The trumpeting has created a mood that makes reasoned policy
discussion difficult in the United States, the professor said in
his article "Don't Let Scare-Mongering Make China a Foe."
</P>
<P>
"Is it in the U.S. interest to create 1.2 billion enemies in a
country likely to be the world's largest economy within a couple
of decades," he asked.
</P>
<P>
"If we treat China as an enemy, we increases the chances of
creating an enemy."
</P>
<P>
Vogel said nearly one-fifth of the U.S. Congress has visited
China in the last few months, but many representatives are afraid
to report their impression publicly for fear of being accused by
the press.
</P>
<P>
"I see what all other experienced observers of China see --
progress not only in economic well-being but in free expression of
opinion," said Vogel, who said he has visited China at least once
a year since 1979 and often returned to the same universities,
villages and factories he visited.
</P>
<P>
He listed as examples "the growth of village elections and
voices of dissent in the National People's Congress (parliament),
the increase of information and varied opinions, the spread of the
rule of law, the adaptation to international institutions, the
outspokeness of the Hong Kong vernacular press."
</P>
<P>
The scholar urged the U.S. press to end its ridiculous and
extreme reporting on China, which misleads the U.S. audience. The
American audience hopes for more balanced reporting, he said.
</P>
<P>
Vogel expressed his support to the effort by U.S. President
Bill Clinton and thoughtful members of both parties of Congress to
work with China.
</P>
<P>
"Whipping up a China threat will have dangerous consequences
for U.S. policy," he said. "We cannot deal with many of the big
global issues -- trade, proliferation of nuclear weapons,
conventional arms control, environmental management -- without the
cooperation of all of the world's largest economies."
</P>
<P>
He noted that even at the peak of the Cold War, the U.S. had to
work closely with the former Soviet Union to reduce the risk of
conflict.
</P>
<P>
"We need to work much more with China, a far more successful
economy, to deal with the problems of an increasingly
interdependent world," he said.

DAR ES SALAAM, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Natural
Resources and Tourism is to assist Mashaka Nyanzai, a disabled,
in his Mount Kilimanjaro charity climbing which is to take place
in October this year, local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
Minister Zakia Meghji told reportes here recently in the city
that her ministry will provide Nyanzai with the equipments needed
for climbing, fees and a tour operator.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, she congratulated Nyanzi for his decision which
will raise funds for establishing a recreation center and a
revolving fund for the disabled people in Dar es Salaam.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, while presenting his request to the minister, Nyanzai
said the project which is his own brain child needs some 1.5
million US Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Nyanzai said with the number of disabled totaling about three
million in Tanzania today, he has found that the charity to climb
Mount Kilimanjaro will enable him raise funds enough to run the
project.
</P>
<P>
Explaining the aim of the project to the minister, he said its
emphasis will be giving loans to disabled people from the
revolving funds, adding that another objective is to make sure
that disabled people participate in games, computer knowledge and
health care at a cheap cost.

<HEADLINE> PKK Leader: PKK to Attack Israeli, U.S. Targets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A leader of the Kurdistan Workers'
Party (PKK) has said here that his group will attack Israeli and
U.S. targets in Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Khalil Attachi, the PKK's military leader, was quoted by
Beirut's newspaper the Daily Star today as saying that Turkey's
cities and tourist areas will also be targets of his party's
operations.
</P>
<P>
Attachi, whose separatist guerrillas are being chased by
Turkish troops in northern Iraq, said that he will "carry out
operations against Israeli targets in Istanbul and elsewhere in
Turkey and against U.S. enemy interests."
</P>
<P>
About 25,000 to 50,000 Turkish troops began the cross-border
military operation in Northern Iraq in May 14 to attack the
outlawed PKK, which has fought a 13-year separatist war in
southeast Turkey for an independent Kurdish state.
</P>
<P>
Attachi told a press conference in Beirut's Shiite southern
suburb Monday that the Turkish troops which invaded northern
Iraq were trained in Israel as part of the Israel-Turkish
military training agreement signed in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
"This campaign is against the people of the area in general
and only serves the interests of Turkey, Israel and the United
States, who are linked by a strategic alliance," Attachi added.
</P>
<P>
Turkish military officials have said more than 2,000 PKK
members have been killed in the fighting in northern Iraq, but
the PKK claimed its losses are less than 100.

<HEADLINE> Precious Stone Smuggling Cost Zambia Dearly </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has been losing millions of
U.S. Dollars for failure of stopping continuous smuggling of its
precious stones, according the latest issue of African Mining.
</P>
<P>
The magazine said though Zambia is known for its emeralds with
quantities to the value of 200 million U.S. Dollars unearthed a
year, it is estimated that over 60 percent are smuggled out of
the country.
</P>
<P>
The Export Board of Zambia has expressed a serious concern at
the failure to harness the country's potential in gemstone mining
leading to excessive smuggling of the stones.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Major enterprises in east China's
Jiangsu Province, already an economic powerhouse, have increased
their competitiveness in the marketplace.
</P>
<P>
The province's Little Swan automatic washing machines have
occupied 40 percent shares of the domestic markets. And the Yaxing
Group's passenger bus and one of Changchai Group's diesel engines
have occupied 25 percent and 26 percent shares of the domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
Local officials predicted that this year, the total sales
volume, taxes and profits, and exports of 16 key enterprises in
the province are expected to increase 20 percent, 15 percent and
30 percent, respectively, all of which exceed the average growth
rates of the industrial enterprises in the province.
</P>
<P>
Sixteen of 21 provincial-level key enterprises in Jiangsu
turned out a combined sales volume of 48.1 billion yuan (about 5.8
billion US dollars) in 1996, up 22.2 percent over the previous
year. Meanwhile, these enterprises' taxes and profits totalled 4.3
billion yuan, up 23.1 percent. The growth rates were 13.6 and 21.5
percentage points higher than the average rates of the province's
industrial enterprises. The sales volume, taxes and profits, and
profits of the 16 enterprises accounted for seven percent, 9.7
percent and 15.8 percent of those of the 40,000 industrial
enterprises in the province.
</P>
<P>
The market shares of the leading products have also expanded
continuously, a local official said. At present, major enterprises
in the province are focusing efforts on key products, accumulating
assets, improving technology, setting up projects in other
countries, and intensifying involvement with multinational
companies.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Archaeological Exhibition Opens in Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Israeli President Ezer Weizman
said that archaeological finds in Egypt provide proof that Jews
and Arabs can live together in harmony, The Jerusalem Post
reported today.
</P>
<P>
Weizman made the remark Monday night when he opened an
exhibition at the Israel Museum in Jerusalem. On display are
documents discovered from the Cairo Geniza, a repository for
timeworn sacred manuscripts and ritual objects.
</P>
<P>
The Geniza was uncovered in the Old Cairo suburb of Fustat,
with some 90,000 manuscripts found.
</P>
<P>
The documents were later identified by Solomon Schechter of
Cambridge University in 1897. This vast collection of liturgical,
legal, commercial and literary documents generally revolutionized
the study of the medieval history of Palestinian and Middle
Eastern Jewry.
</P>
<P>
Among the highlights of the exhibition are hand-written texts
dating back to the 11th century. There is a corrected version of
a page from The Perplexed Guide by Moses Maimonides, a Jewish
philosopher whose contributions in religion, philosophy and
medicine have influenced Jewish and non-Jewish scholars alike.
</P>
<P>
The texts are written in Hebrew, Judeo-Arabic, Arabic and
Yiddish.
</P>
<P>
In the main, the documents describe the everyday life of the
vibrant medieval Jewish communities in the Mediterranean
basin. There are references of bridal dowries and land tracts,
and lists of household items. There are also pharmaceutical
prescriptions and medical remedies.
</P>
<P>
Some 50 fragments from the cache of documents found in 1897
are on loan to the museum, almost all of them from the Cambridge
University Library.

<HEADLINE> Africans Urged to Be Alert to Western "Advice" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The daily newspaper Kenya Times
today said in a commentary that "African today suffers more from
failure of imported economic and political models than from
problems engendered by local leadership."
</P>
<P>
The paper run by the ruling Kenya African National Union
(KANU) called on African peoples to be alert to Western "advice"
on the transformation of political and economic models.
</P>
<P>
At present, the paper said, the one party government system
has given way to multiplicity politics in a number of countries
on African continent.
</P>
<P>
However, "there is little evidence of success for the policies
advanced by some Western powers to bring about political
integration and economic growth in most African nations", it
noted.
</P>
<P>
The daily paper pointed out that African economies had
steadfastly declined in the last seven years pushing the once
promising nations into greater debt burden.
</P>
<P>
The understanding of the ailing continent by the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund "have been miserably poor",
the local newspaper stressed.
</P>
<P>
The commentary stated that "the continent's future must be
decided not by an international policy system but by the
indigenous leaders and peoples of each independent African
state."
</P>
<P>
Homegrown economic and political ideas can help reverse
Africa's decline, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
It added that "social studies have shown that a people's
attitude towards life is fundamental to social, political and
economic advancement and a vital catalyst in achieving the
Africa's dream of integration."
</P>
<P>
Kenya, like many other African countries, is a victim of this
forced transformation, the ruling party paper noted.
</P>
<P>
According to a report by the local weekly paper The East
African, some of the Western envoys accredited to Nairobi are
likely to seek a meeting with Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi to
clarify government's promises about the conduct of Kenya's
forthcoming General Elections.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, some Western diplomats privately made
public their concerns about a free and fair election in Kenya and
the Kenyan government responded with a statement criticizing
their interference in its internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Referring to seeking audience with President Moi, the
commentary noted that "we highly doubt their motives".
</P>
<P>
"Some of the envoys have been playing it very dirty behind the
President's back under the guise of promoting political education
and democratic awareness in the country", it stressed.

<HEADLINE> Philippine House Speaker to Run for Presidency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Philippine House Speaker Jose de
Venecia said today he has decided to run for the Presidency in
1998 with or without the appointment of President Fidel Ramos.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia made the remarks when swearing in all village
officials elected last month in Pangasinan province in the
northern Philippines. However, he said he still needs the help of
the President.
</P>
<P>
Local media said earlier that the support of President Ramos
would help a candidate win an additional 20 percent of votes in
next year's national elections.
</P>
<P>
De Venecia, meanwhile, also said he would personally sponsor
the entry of Defense Secretary Renato de Villa to the ruling
Lakas-NUCD, although he admitted that de Villa will be a main
rival for him in the 1998 polls.
</P>
<P>
De Villa announced his decision to participate in the
presidential election over the weekend. But he has to join the
ruling party first before being appointed by President Ramos.
</P>
<P>
Asked on Senator Leticia Ramos Shahani, another aspirant for
the Presidency, de Venecia said he foresees his reconciliation
later with the President's sister.
</P>
<P>
Shahani has challenged de Venecia to relinquish the post of the
secretary general of the ruling party to level the playing ground
in the selection of the party's standard bearer.

<HEADLINE> East China Province Attractive to Overseas Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANCHANG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Jiangxi Province's efforts to
improve its investment environment in recent years have begun to
pay off, with exports of 1,268 overseas-backed enterprises up 21
percent in the first quarter from the same period of 1996.
</P>
<P>
Last year, their exports were worth 250 million US dollars, up
36 percent from the year before.
</P>
<P>
In the past few years, Jiangxi has paid greater attention to
infrastructure, completing 160 key projects in recent years,
increasing its power capacity by 2.3 million kilowatts, adding
3,500 km of highways, and expanding telephone switchboards by 1.6
million lines.
</P>
<P>
At the beginning of the year, the province implemented a new
plan for infrastructure facilities involving investment of more
than 10 billion yuan (about 1.2 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
At a recent trade fair in Shenzhen, the province showed its
appeal to overseas investors. Businessmen from 17 countries or
regions have been optimistic about the province's abundant natural
resources and geographical advantages and signed agreements on 163
projects involving 428 million US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The province's exports continue to increase, and by the end of
March, exports were worth 330.6 million US dollars, up 7.3 percent
from the same period of last year. The province plans to have 1.65
billion US dollars worth of exports by the end of this year, said
Bi Bisheng, director of provincial Foreign Trade and Economic
Co-operation Department.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Jiangxi got 470 million US dollars worth of overseas
investment, 301 million of which was direct investment. But the
official hopes that this year 450 million US dollars will come.
</P>
<P>
The province has approved 3,478 overseas-backed projects, with
contractual investment of more than 3.46 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Jewish Organization Demands Eastern European </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A Jewish organization is
threatening to obstruct the inclusion of Poland, Romania and
Czech Republic into North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) if
they refuse to return Jewish property confiscated during the war.
</P>
<P>
The World Jewish Restitution Organization (WJRO) made the
decision at its council meeting held Monday night in
Jerusalem. It vowed to use its influence to work against the
acceptance by NATO of the three above-mentioned countries if they
do not return the Jewish assets.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, the WJRO also decided to establish a
committee that would report within a month on how to
distribute the Swiss humanitarian fund to Holocaust survivors.
</P>
<P>
The committee, which comprises representatives of the World
Jewish Congress (WJC), Jewish Agency and the American Jewish
Joint Distribution Committee, was instructed to make aid to
Holocaust survivors in Eastern Europe its top priority.
</P>
<P>
There are some 60,000 Holocaust survivors in Eastern Europe,
according to the Center of Organizations of Holocaust Survivors
in Israel. Some other organizations believe the figure is much
higher.
</P>
<P>
WJRO's vice-chairman Naphtali Lavie hoped his group would
distribute the compensation funds in Europe. But WJC disagreed
with the WJRO, saying that Israel must be the focal point
for financial distributions worldwide.
</P>
<P>
WJC chairman in Israel Mati Droblas said these payments
would be to establish old-age homes in the former Soviet
Union and to construct community centers for Holocaust survivors
throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
Under strong pressures from Israel and Jewish organizations
worldwide, Switzerland, which is accused of dealing with the
gold looted from Jews by German Nazis in the Second World
War, agreed earlier this year to create a 50 million dollar
compensation fund for the Holocaust survivors.

BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Six city departments in Weihai, a
port city in east China's Shandong Province, have jointly set
forth a proposal to forbid tobacco advertisements in the city, the
Shanghai-based "Wenhui Daily" reported.
</P>
<P>
The proposal requires all local working units and citizens to
abide by the "Advertisement Law" and the "Provisional Regulations
For Tobacco Advertisement".
</P>
<P>
No tobacco advertisement should be seen in public places, and
working units should refuse any activities sponsored by tobacco
businessmen.
</P>
<P>
The proposal also asks advertising agencies not to deal with
tobacco advertisements, and citizens not to carry items bearing
tobacco brands.
</P>
<P>
The move is part of the city's efforts to qualify as one of the
countries' "health cities". Several other cities also have taken
the same action against tobacco advertising.

<P>
CAIRO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Egypt's population has risen by 21.7
percent compared with a decade ago to reach 61.45 million in
1996, making it the 17th most populous country in the world, the
Egyptian Gazette reported today.
</P>
<P>
In the 1986 census, the population was 50.504 million, said
Ahab Moustafa Elwi, head of the Central Agency for Public
Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS) at the briefing on the
preliminary results of a national census conducted every 10 years
on population, housing and installations.
</P>
<P>
The latest census was conducted by officials from different
ministries and local government agencies, said Elwi.
</P>
<P>
Despite the large population increase, the population growth
had fallen to 2.1 percent in 1996 from 2.8 percent in 1986, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Gender divisions remained steady in this census, with males
dominating the population at 51.2 percent against 48.8 percent
females.
</P>
<P>
The population in Cairo, the capital, stands at 16.79 million
with an increase of 11.9 percent over 1986.
</P>
<P>
While inhabitants of rural areas mushroomed at an annual rate
of 2.26 percent during the 10 years between the two censuses,
urban areas had lower growth rates at 1.85 percent.
</P>
<P>
Only 3.5 percent of Egyptians live outside the country and the
number of illiterates dropped by a significant 38.6 percent over
1986 to 17.35 million, according to the census which was
conducted for six months from June 1, 1996.

research group led by Professor Chen Dayuan at the Institute of
Zoology under the Chinese Academy of Sciences.
</P>
<P>
"Under the protection of the liquid, the frozen sperm of giant
panda has been able to live up to 21 hours outside of the animal's
body, as opposed to one hour and a half previously," Professor Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
"The discovery has dramatically raised the success rate of
artificial insemination for the giant panda," he added.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese researcher, 24 giant panda cubs, had
been born in six years between 1990 and 1995 from artificial
insemination techniques using sperm that was stored in the new
solution. Most of the panda cubs were twins.
</P>
<P>
Previously, the thawing and culture solution used in artificial
insemination of giant pandas was the same solution used for the
artificial insemination of dairy cows.
</P>
<P>
"Frozen sperm of the giant panda could only live from two
minutes to one hour and a half in the old solution," he noted,
"although a few cubs had been born, the success rate was poor."
</P>
<P>
"The new solution, at the proper pH level, osmotic pressure,
and temperature, will effectively preserve the viability of the
sperm after thawing," he said.
</P>
<P>
"In the past, the old solution had made most sperm 'drunk',
and lose their motility upon entering the female panda, and even
lose their viability," Professor Chen said.
</P>
<P>
The research paper of Chen and his group has been published in
the latest English-edition of "Chinese Science Bulletin," the
leading scientific journal in China.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda is the world's best-known endangered species
which can only be found in the mountains of southwest China. Its
population stands at less than 1,000.
</P>
<P>
The giant panda normally gets pregnant once a year and produces
one or two babies at each birth.
</P>
<P>
"The female pandas always show indifference and contempt to the
approaching male giant pandas during the mating season," said
Professor Zhang Anju, a co-author of the paper.
</P>
<P>
"So it's very difficult to have them mate and get pregnant
naturally," he said, adding that "only 10 percent of giant pandas
are able to mate naturally."

<HEADLINE> Farm Machinery Brings Better Harvest to Northeast China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Better harvests brought by
improved farming mechanization have encouraged farmers in
northeast China's Liaoning Province to invest heavily in farm
machinery.
</P>
<P>
The province has 9.5 million kw of mechanical power capacity,
including more than 160,000 tractors and 150,000 other supporting
farm tools and processing equipment. Its farm machinery sales
exceed two billion yuan annually.
</P>
<P>
Mechanical cultivation saved farmers 27 million kg of seeds,
increased grain output by nearly 400 million kg last year, and
brought about one billion yuan in economic results, according to
the provincial agricultural machinery administrative department.
</P>
<P>
Sales and use of large and medium-sized farm machinery had
decreased since China adopted the contract household
responsibility system in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
But booming township enterprises have employed a great number
of rural surplus laborers, resulting in fewer farmers working on
more farmland. Farm machinery is again popular, and now more than
70 percent of the province's farmland is ploughed by machines.
</P>
<P>
Liaoning has taken preferential policies to promote
agricultural mechanization. One example is that the local
government provides 30,000 yuan of financial subsidies for the
renewal of one large-scale tractor. As a result, farmers bought or
restored 2,000 tractors last year.
</P>
<P>
Factories have also shifted part of their production to small
agricultural machinery, which is more suitable for household
farming.

<HEADLINE> Salim Re-elected OAU Secretary-General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Dr. Salim Ahmed Salim, incumbent
Secretary-General of the 53-member Organization of African Unity
(OAU), has been re-elected for a third four-year term.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made after a cast of ballot by African heads
of state and government at a closed-door session last night
during their three-day 33rd summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
Salim, who won by 37 votes out of 47, met no challenge as Cote
D'Ivoire's Foreign Minister Amara Essy, who had earlier indicated
interest in the post, withdrew.
</P>
<P>
Ibrahim Dagash, spokesman of the OAU secretariat, said Essy
decided to withdraw because he did not want to cause division
within the continental body.
</P>
<P>
Francophone African countries had been insisting on Essy's
taking over of Salim who comes from English-speaking Tanzania, but
Anglophone African countries supported Salim to serve a third
term.
</P>
<P>
Five countries of the 53-member organization did not vote
because they are under sanctions for failing to pay arrears to the
organization, while Somalia was not represented at the summit.
</P>
<P>
Six countries voted against Salim, while two abstained and
another two spoiled their ballots.
</P>
<P>
Salim, one of Africa's most outstanding diplomats, has been
committed to turning OAU, which had been branded as the mere
talk-show body before he served the first term as the
secretary-general in 1989, into a meaningful continental body
worth of note in the world.
</P>
<P>
With his leadership, OAU has been playing an increasingly
important role in raising Africa's general status in the world
scene, solving the continent's own political problems, and
pushing forward the process of Africa's regional economic
integration.
</P>
<P>
It was Salim who introduced a sanction system of barring
countries falling short of financial contributions from any
decision-making and voting sessions, a system that has helped
reduce OAU's debts significantly while boosting its coffers.
</P>
<P>
He also successfully lobbied for the creation of a conflict
prevention mechanism within OAU, which is now playing an
increasing role in seeking peaceful solutions to the continent's
wars and conflicts.

<HEADLINE> Jordanian Embassies to Offer Business Services </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Jordan has instructed all its
embassies around the world to offer investment and economic
services to foreign businessmen soon to help the country's
economic recovery.
</P>
<P>
All the embassies are also obliged to provide the necessary
facilities to foreign private sector delegations coming to Jordan,
said Foreign Minister Fayez Tarawneh quoted in local press today.
</P>
<P>
The embassies are especially urged to provide services such as
hotel reservations, hiring cars, hosting receptions, fixing
appointments for delegations and establishing a follow-up
mechanism on a case-by-case basis, the minister told a meeting
with the representatives of trade and industry chambers here
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Major recovering steps by Jordan include drawing foreign
investment, establishing the Aqaba free trade zone and further
developing sectoral economy such as tourism, phosphate production
and pharmacy.
</P>
<P>
Before the Gulf crisis (1990-1991), Jordan, although scant of
natural resources, had a flourishing economy thanks to a great
amount of aid from various resources.
</P>
<P>
But most aid from other Arab states and the West were stopped
because Jordan sided with Iraq who invaded Kuwait after the war,
making the economy going down. By the end of 1996, its foreign
debt equaled to 90 percent of its gross national product.

<HEADLINE> Volunteers Create a Better Neighborhood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- About 720,000 volunteers in
Shanghai do their part to help residents in their neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
This has improved relations among neighbors in the blocks where
they live, local residents said.
</P>
<P>
Ji Wantao, a 74-year-old retired worker, often voluntarily
repairs shoes for his neighbors.
</P>
<P>
"I repaired five pairs of shoes today," the old man said
proudly, when being interviewed by Xinhua reporters.
</P>
<P>
The number of volunteers has steadily been increasing,
according to official sources.
</P>
<P>
Recent statistics show that Shanghai has about 2,417 teams of
volunteers, with a total of 720,000 team members, including
government officials, workers, and students.
</P>
<P>
"It is really exciting to see so many volunteers in our city,
and they are creating a 'happy big family' for us to live in,"
said Zhou Jinwei, an expert in the Shanghai Institute of Social
Sciences.
</P>
<P>
City dwellers used to have their doors shut all day to their
neighbors, often not even knowing the name of those who lived on
the same floor of their building for decades.
</P>
<P>
But changes have taken place, as volunteers bring harmony into
the community they live in, local officials said.
</P>
<P>
When Xu Yizhong and Chen Yong, a couple of retired teachers in
the No. 860 Building of Qinzhou Street, started clearing away the
dirty spots on the surface of their building, most of their
neighbors thought the couple were workers from housing
administration departments.
</P>
<P>
All their neighbors immediately joined them to clean the
building, when they found out that the couple were their neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Community volunteers provide services for their neighbors such
as repair of electrical appliances, medical care, art design, and
helping students with their lessons, etc.
</P>
<P>
Local officials said that residents in nearly 30,000 buildings
do not even have to walk out of their buildings if they want minor
help.

<HEADLINE> Smoking Kills 15 Israelis Daily: Health Ministry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 3 (Xinhua) -- An average of 15 Israelis die a
day due to smoking, Israeli Health Ministry said today.
</P>
<P>
Israel is marking the World No-Tobacco Day today. Although
foreign countries marked the day last Saturday, Israel delayed
it to today because Saturday is Shabath, the Jewish day of rest
when no office is permitted.
</P>
<P>
According to the Health Ministry, 28 percent of the 5.7
million Israeli population -- 32 percent of men and 25 percent of
women -- are smokers. Tobacco kills half of the regular users.
</P>
<P>
Latest statistics showed that smokers aged 30 to 40 are six
times more likely than non-smokers to suffer a heart attack at
that age. And 30 percent of all cancers diagnosed in Israel are
related to smoking, either by the person himself or the result
of exposure to others' smoking.
</P>
<P>
The main reasons Israeli smokers give for their habit are
addiction, tension and nervousness, the ministry said. But
nearly six out of 10 smokers have tried to quit smoking.
</P>
<P>
The Health Ministry will mark the No-Tobacco Day by cracking
down on violations of the law that restricts smoking in the
workplaces and prohibits smoking in public places and in
non-smoking sections of cafes and restaurants.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ministry opened a telephone hot-line on
quitting smoking today in coordination with Israel Cancer
Association in order to help those smokers who intend to quit
but face difficulties.

<HEADLINE> Feature: When Chinese Farmers Go to Court...(1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Zhang Yimou became a court hero after
his masterpiece "Qiuju Goes to Court" won a medal at a major
international film festival.
</P>
<P>
The gifted Chinese director described how Qiuju, an ordinary
but brave rural woman, played by Gong Li, filed a suit against a
village head who badly beat her husband.
</P>
<P>
Some commentators say that it was the artist who helped Qiuju
win the case.
</P>
<P>
But Zhang's movie is based on a true story in Anhui province.
</P>
<P>
The question is: when Chinese farmers seek to solve their
problems in court, what else happens besides the shooting of a
movie?
</P>
<P>
"The society in which personal power overweights legal system
is coming to an end," said Fu Hongping, director of the Office for
Popularizing Law Knowledge in Anhui province, in east China.
</P>
<P>
"As ordinary persons, how could we bring a law suit against an
official before? We could just have the matter on our minds," said
Peng Chenggui, a farmer.
</P>
<P>
But Peng is able to do it today.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, a highway was built in Peng's village and it occupied
the farmers' lands. According to the government policy, the
villagers should be paid 3,000 yuan as resettlement fees for each.
</P>
<P>
But Peng only got half of the money, and the rest was kept by
government officials.
</P>
<P>
Enraged by the officials' malfeasance, Peng and 25 fellow
villagers went to the court to demand justice. They finally got it.
</P>
<P>
Artists like Zhang Yimou now can find more examples to enrich
their stories.
</P>
<P>
Kongdian village is another small village in Anhui. After a
selfish village cadre granted 14 hectares of farmlands to his
family members for private use, 122 unhappy families brought the
case to the local court.
</P>
<P>
"We farmers are now having a good taste of what is given by
law," said Xu Zhifu after winning the case.

<P>
But things were quite different before.
</P>
<P>
For thousands of years in China, traditions rigidly dictated
that clan power was the main force to deal with personal relations
in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Then came the administrative power that arrived with modern
politics. Government cadres who explain policies manipulated
farmers' life and fate to a large extent.
</P>
<P>
All this derived from the old Confucian doctrine that citizens
are humble and officials are respectable.
</P>
<P>
The changes are said to be a result of a program to popularize
legal knowledge across China since 1990, when the country's
Administrative Prosecutorial Law went into effect.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that the better enforcement of laws does benefit
economic operations, which is the nation's central work nowadays.
</P>
<P>
Mi Yucai is a farmer who did spare time handcraft work to earn
money. She signed a contract with a local factory to which she
could sell her products. However, the contract was not honored
because the factory thought Mi was just a humble farmer -- a
nobody.

The factory would not dared to have done so if it had known
that Mi had employed a law advisor. The advisor subsequently
brought the case to the court. The judge's verdict was that some
600,000 yuan should be repaid to Mi to recover her economic losses.
</P>
<P>
Contacting law experts has become commonplace now among
farmers. In Ningdu County in east China's Jiangxi province, 3,000
farmers have employed law advisors. In Zhenghe County in east
China's Fujian province, the number is 1,000.
</P>
<P>
"Farmers' legal consciousness has awakened," said Ren Jianxin,
president of the Supreme People's Court of China, "Everyone is
equal before the law."
</P>
<P>
Wang Zhaoyao, deputy-governor of Anhui, said that the
government now handle affairs according to both policies and the
law. But previously they relied on policies alone.
</P>
<P>
One result is that more officials are being supervised by
citizens.
</P>
<P>
Is the change transforming China into a lawful society? Social
scientists wait for the answer.

<HEADLINE> Import of Garment Raw Materials Allowed in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is planning
to have a special scheme to allow garment exporters in the country
to import raw materials for pushing up value addition in price,
Textiles Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
"The Ministry of Textiles has responded positively to the
demand of exporters to allow such imports including high class
fiber. this is going to help exporters of apparel to compete
internationally," said Chairman of the Apparel Export Promotion
Council (AEPC) K.L. Madan Monday.
</P>
<P>
India's garment export figures made available for April 1997
indicated that there had been a negative growth of 14.75 percent
in US dollar value terms for garment exports, while the growth
rate in terms of quantity was 0.60 percent, he said.
</P>
<P>
He added that this indicated an alarming fall in unit value
realization and the fact that Indian exporters were still catering
to cheaper goods. Under these circumstances, the new scheme being
worked out by the government could prove a boon for garment
exporters.
</P>
<P>
The country's garment exporters had sufficient entrepreneurial
skills to double exports by the year 2002 to 9.5 billion US
dollars, the sources said.
</P>
<P>
The new scheme may take into consideration some suggestions
that garment exporters be allowed to import upto 2 percent of
their export earnings in the previous year of raw materials
without any import duty and any import licence, the same sources
said.

<HEADLINE> APEC Insurance Training Program Launched </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- A training program was launched
here today for managers of export credit firms from countries and
regions of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) forum.
</P>
<P>
The ten-day program, the first of a series of five APEC trade
and investment insurance training programs, was sponsored by the
Chinese Ministry of Personnel and organized by the Export-Import
Bank of China (EximBank).
</P>
<P>
Chinese participants included people in export credits or
similar business from the EximBank, the People's Insurance Company
of China's (Group) Property Co. Ltd, China Pacific Insurance
Company, and colleges that offer insurance courses, while overseas
participants were from Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Instructors for the program were insurance experts from APEC
countries and regions such as Japan, the United States, Australia,
Canada, Singapore, and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
The training programs, with four others scheduled to be held in
China's Shanghai and Indonesia, the Philippines, and Thailand,
were first suggested by the Chinese Ministry of Personnel and
supported by agencies in Japan, the United States, Canada,
Australia, Indonesia, the Philippines, Thailand, and Brunei.
</P>
<P>
Approved by an APEC meeting for developing human resources and
by the Eighth APEC ministerial meeting, the multi-lateral
cooperative training project is the largest in APEC history in
terms of the amount of funds allocated by the regional forum.
</P>
<P>
The training programs are aimed at promoting trade and
investment liberalization among APEC members.
</P>
<P>
China's EximBank was one of the country's three policy-oriented
banks founded in April of 1994 to finance exports of capital goods
such as machinery, electronics, and complete sets of equipment.
</P>
<P>
The bank's business in export credit insurance has grown
steadily in past years. The insured value of export credits last
year reached 600 million US dollars, a surge of 275 percent over
1995.

<HEADLINE> Fujian Sees Good Performance of Joint-Stock Companies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Joint-stock companies in China's
coastal Fujian Province have reported good economic performance,
official figures show.
</P>
<P>
The figures show that share-holding companies in Fujian post an
average profit-to-sales rate of 5.9 percent and a net-asset yield
rate of 10.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Fujian introduced share-issuing enterprises in 1984. To date,
the province has set up 2,220 limited-liabilities companies and 86
joint-stock limited companies, with a combined capital stock of
7.23 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The effort to turn enterprises into joint-stock companies has
laid a foundation for the establishment of a modern corporate
system and helped open a new channel to raise funds, analysts say.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Fujian's joint-stock companies have raised
six billion yuan in the aggregate, more than 70 percent of which
is used for technical renovation and development of new products.
</P>
<P>
Joint-stock transformation has also increased the net asset
value of enterprises by an average of 30 percent, statistics
show.

<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lanka's rubber production
increased by 6 percent to 112 million kilograms in 1996 over 1995
and recorded the best production figure during the past decade,
according to the latest figures from the country's central bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributes the improvement in production to well
distributed rainfall, increased fertilizer and better management.
</P>
<P>
Rubber is one of the three major traditional exports of Sri
Lanka, occupying an important position in the country's economy.
</P>
<P>
However, bank sources stated that rubber production has shown a
declining trend during the past decade.
</P>
<P>
This is because the land under cultivation has been reduced as
more land has been used for residential and industrial purposes,
the sources explained.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Indian Finance Minister P.
Chidambaram is leaving here today on a three-day official visit to
Germany for more economic aid from it, a government official said
here today.
</P>
<P>
India has shown its concern over declining aid from Germany in
the past few years and plans to make a strong case for more aid
from that country.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics available here, fresh aid
commitments from Germany have been coming down since 1991 and it
had taken a nosedive in 1997 when it was reduced to 220 million
German marks (127.6 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
The German side made a commitment of 792.50 million marks
(396.25 million US dollars) including reprogrammed amount from
previous years and a fresh commitment of commercial credit of 450
million marks (261 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Chidambaram is expected to use his visit opportunity to make a
strong plea for a substantial step up of the German commitment
during the next year, the same official said.

<HEADLINE> Novelist Examines Farm Life </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Unlike many novelists in the 1990s
who have focussed on the lives of urban business types, Zhao Defa
chose to write a novel about the fate of the Chinese farmer.
</P>
<P>
Zhao Defa, 42, said that his intention is to preserve a vivid
picture of China's old-style farmers "who will disappear in the
coming century".
</P>
<P>
The 400,000-character "Linger on or Say Goodbye" will be a new
epic in contemporary Chinese literature, as it depicts the largest
farming population on the planet with unprecedented depth,
publishers from the People's Literature Publishing House said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese farmers' traditional life changed in the late 1970s
when the contract household responsibility system was introduced,
which tied production and income together as part of the reform
and opening-up drive. The reform also enabled farmers to set up
privately-owned rural and township factories and to move into
cities for more lucrative jobs.
</P>
<P>
Previous literary masterpieces on Chinese farmers could be
found in the 1950s and 1960s featuring class struggle and the
planned economy in rural areas. Other great works touched the
revolution which deprived the landlords of their properties and
gave them to farmers.

<HEADLINE> High-tech Industrial Belt to Appear Along China's Wanjiang River </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HEFEI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Anhui Province, east China, plans to
set up a high-tech industrial belt along the Wanjiang River, an
800-km section of the Yangtze, a local official said.
</P>
<P>
As early as in 1990, the province worked out a strategy to
develop Wanjiang to keep pace with China's large-scale development
of the Pudong New Area in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the comprehensive economic strength of the
areas along Wanjiang has increased. Infrastructure facilities have
improved and overseas investors are flocking in, paving the way
for the setting up of a high-tech industrial belt.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this century, the combined output value
generated by high-tech industries in Wuhu, Maanshan, Tongling, and
Anqing, is expected to comprise 15 percent of the total industrial
output value of the enterprises at or above the county level in
the four cities. While the share in other cities or prefectures is
expected to increase by up to four percentage points.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, technological improvement in the the area along
Wangjiang will contribute up to 50 percent of the development of
industry and agriculture.
</P>
<P>
The area will place emphasis on four new industries such as
new materials, electronic information, electro-mechanical
products, and bio-technology, generating a combined output value
of 13 billion yuan (about 1.6 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
It will also use high technology to renovate traditional
industries, and build an economic and technological development
zone in Wuhu and a non-state-owned high-tech industrial zone in
Anqing.
</P>
<P>
In order to push the development of the industrial belt along
the river, the provincial government will pour capital into the
belt and provide favorable policies to lure technology and
industries elsewhere into the belt.
</P>
<P>
Economic analysts said that the belt, together with Shanghai
and the Suzhou-Wuxi-Changzhou high-tech industrial belts, will
jointly form a Yangtze hi-tech industrial corridor.

<HEADLINE> Nepal, India Agree on Size of Joint Hydro Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Nepal and India have agreed on
the size of a joint multi-purpose hydro project on their border
river with a view to maximizing its benefit, Nepali Foreign
Minister Prakash Chandra Lohani said today.
</P>
<P>
The two countries have narrowed down many of the differences in
their respective detailed project reports for the Pancheshwar
project especially its designed generating capacity, Lohani was
quoted by the Kathmandu Post daily as saying today.
</P>
<P>
The agreement on the project's size came during a two-day
meeting of the Nepal-India high-level task force for the project
held here over the weekend, Nepali officials said.
</P>
<P>
India's acceptance of the concept of maximizing the project's
benefit was seen as a concession for Nepal, which has been
proposing to design the project to its full generating potential
of 6,480 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
Earlier India insisted that a smaller project with the
generating capacity between 2,000 to 4,000 megawatts be built
under the consideration of giving more emphasis to the project's
irrigation function.
</P>
<P>
The Pancheshwar project is the centerpiece of a bilateral
treaty between the two neighbors on the integrated development of
the Mahakali border river, about 450 kilometers west of Kathmandu.
</P>
<P>
The treaty was signed at the prime minister level in New Delhi
in March 1996 and ratified by the Nepali Parliament six months
later.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that the two governments will exchange the
documents of the Mahakali Treaty's ratification during Indian
Prime Minister I. K. Gujral's visit to Nepal later this week.
</P>
<P>
Nepali officials said the two countries will have to finalize a
joint detailed report for the Pancheshwar project within six
months after the exchange of the ratification documents, formally
bringing the treaty into force.

Dhaka, June 3 (Xinhua) -- the main opposition Bangladesh
Nationalist Party (BNP) will take part in the June 30 by-election
in Manikganj-3 constituency "for the sake of democracy and
following the assurance by the Election Commission," BNP sources
said.
</P>
<P>
The BNP had earlier announced that it would not contest any
by-election under the present Chief Election Commissioner Abu
Hena, blaming the latter for his alleged partisan role in the
elections.
</P>
<P>
The Manikganj-3 seat was vacated after the death of the BNP
lawmaker Alhaj Nizamuddin Khan in March this year.
</P>
<P>
Following mounting pressure from within the party to contest
the polls in the BNP's traditional stronghold, the BNP's Standing
Committee gave this decision at a meeting on Monday night,
according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
The meeting noted that the Election Commission has given a
positive reply to the BNP's 10-point demand, set by the party as a
precondition to join the by-election. The commission has
reportedly accepted all the suggestions of the BNP except the
demand for the removal of the chief election commissioner.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the ruling Awami League has also invited
applications from intending candidates for contesting the
Manikganj-3 constituency by-elections, a party press release said.

Ryozo Kato, director general of the Japanese Foreign Ministry's

Kato asked Kim for a halt in construction of the wharf and
cancellation of a development plan announced in South Korea late
last week.
</P>
<P>
South Korea said last Friday it would build berth facilities
and lighthouses, conduct surveys and establish a maritime and
scientific base on the islands.\

SHANGHAI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The Shanghai Metallurgical
Holdings Company and the Shanghai Metallurgical Workers' Union
recently reached agreement on democratic participation of business
operations by the employees and protection of their rights.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed after negotiations between the two
sides.
</P>
<P>
Local observers say that the enterprise-trade union negotiation
system is a significant aspect of the democratic status of the

The president of the firm and the trade union chairman took
part in the talks on behalf of the respective sides. They came to
the conclusion that workers must be made well-informed about the
major issues of the industry, including mergers and bankruptcy,
and employees must participate in decision-making on important
matters.
</P>
<P>
As the ongoing industrial restructuring has laid off more
employees, the two sides agreed to protect the rights of layoffs,
to help them find new jobs, and to set up more funds to finance

NEW DELHI, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister I. K. Gujral is
expected to expand his council of ministers today by inducting
five women ministers into it in a bid to reaffirm his commitment
to giving adequate representation to women in government, an
informed source said here today.
</P>
<P>
At the moment, there is only one woman minister in the

</P>
<P>
Gujral's plan to induct women members into his cabinet is in
keeping with his commitment soon after his cabinet was sworn in on
April 21 this year. His move is also seen as an attempt to placate
women members who have been resentful of the concerted bid to
block passage of the women's bill in the parliament to reserve
one-third of seats in the parliament and state assemblies for
women. Last year the United Front government tabled the women's
bill before the parliament, yet it has not been passed due to
strong opposition by various parties and men MPs.

Today's cabinet expansion will be the first one by Gujral after
he assumed office as the prime minister on April 21.

BANGKOK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- More than 300 ethnic Mon rebels
have surrendered to the Myanmar authorities and handed over some
1,700 pieces of arms and ammunition at a camp near the
Thai-Myanmar border, local newspaper the Bangkok Post reported

</P>
<P>
A ceremony for the surrender was held on Monday in the last Mon

close to the Thai border district of Bang Saphan in Prachuap Khiri
Khan province, report said.

The 300 rebels, under the command of Aung Hlaing, broke away
from the mainstream New Mon State Party (NMSP) nearly two years
ago, denouncing NMSP leader Nai Shwe Kyin for signing a ceasefire
agreement with the government, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
However, about 700 family members of the 300 rebels did not
follow them and moved into the Bang Saphan district as the fate of
the surrenders remained unclear.
</P>
<P>
There are an estimated four million ethnic Mons in Myanmar who
were seeking autonomy for the Mon state. Thailand currently also
accommodates 17,000 Mon refugees.

<HEADLINE> Liberals to Form Canada's Majority Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Canada's ruling Liberal Party is to
form a majority government, CBC Television reported today.
</P>
<P>
At press time, Jean Chretien's Liberal Party has won 154 seats
of a total of 301.
</P>
<P>
The party led others in the preliminary results of the poll
which has just closed.
</P>
<P>
It was followed by the Progressive Conservative, the Reform,
the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Quebecois.
</P>
<P>
Voting began at 9:30 a.m. (local time) and closed at 9:30
p.m. The final results are expected to be released at 11 p.m.
</P>
<P>
Across the country, about 19 million voters were eligible to
choose among the 1,672 candidates running. Many of them have said
that they would not come out and vote at the end of the five-week
campaign.
</P>
<P>
Chretien called the election one and half years early,
primarily because polls showed he would win. But he bungled at the
start, launching the five-week campaign as the worst flood of the
century ravaged the province of Manitoba.
</P>
<P>
In the last election held on October 25, 1993, the Liberals won
177 seats in the outgoing 295-member parliament.

<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Hunan Province in central China is
seeking enhanced overseas cooperation in environmental protection.
</P>
<P>
The province used 110 million US dollars of overseas capital
from international nature protection organizations by the end of
1996, and begun to witness good results from the improved
environment.
</P>
<P>
Farmers in Zhakou Township of Lixian County now live in a
better environment thanks to a 100,000-Australian-dollar project
financed by the Worldwide Fund for Nature, Australia.
</P>
<P>
The township was typical of the Dongting Lake areas, and
farmers there earned their living by exploiting small coalpits and
other resources. As a result, the lake areas have been polluted by
waste water and slags.
</P>
<P>
The fund has helped local farmers raise centipedes, plant trees
on waste hillsides, and tighten control over random mining, to
balance economic development and the eco-system.
</P>
<P>
The province is expected to receive 12 million Deutsche marks
from Germany to protect the Dongting Lake by building up the
Yangtze River shelterbelt.
</P>
<P>
Hunan Province has worked out a biological protection program
with Finland, which is to start in this autumn, with part of the
capital coming from the Federation of Nature and National Parks of
Europe.

<HEADLINE> Large Amount of Amphetamines Smuggled into Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- About 12 to 18 million tablets of
amphetamines have been smuggled into Thailand in the past six
months, according to a report issued by the Thai Narcotics Control
Board (ONCB).
</P>
<P>
Today's local press quoted the report as saying that the
majority of the drug smuggled into Thailand come from Myanmar. Mae
Sai district of northern Thailand's province of Chiang Rai was
found to have the highest rate of amphetamine smuggling with about
one million tablets a month coming across the Myanmar-Thai border
into Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The report said the production of amphetamines in Myanmar
increased following drug warlord Khun Sa's surrender to the
Myanmar government.
</P>
<P>
It said his surrender caused small ethnic groups, which were
once under Khun Sa's control, to turn to the production of
amphetamines for sale to Thailand because the trade has become
more lucrative than heroin production.
</P>
<P>
The report said manufacturers in Myanmar have begun to use Laos
as a transit route to smuggle the drug into Thailand following
increase checks along the Thai-Myanmar border.
</P>
<P>
The ONCB believed that amphetamine tablets are being produced
along the Lao-Thai border. The report also said some amphetamines
are produced in Koh Kong in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
The report said that because of the lucrative nature of the
business and because more people have turned to amphetamines, more
traffickers have joined the trade.
</P>
<P>
The ONCB proposed that the Thai government seek cooperation
from neighboring countries to crack down on manufacturers and
smugglers of the drug.
</P>
<P>
It also suggested that the Thai government launch a public
awareness campaign to warn people about the danger of amphetamines
abuse.

Kontic made the remarks in an interview with the Austrian

<P>
BANGKOK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations' Economic and
Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) has urged all
the related countries in the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) to
upgrade the transport system to boost tourism.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by ESCAP to representatives of tourism
organizations from Myanmar, Cambodia, Laos, Thailand, Vietnam, and
China's Yunnan province, who met here recently to work out ways to
cooperate in developing the subregional tourism.
</P>
<P>
Except in Thailand and China, road conditions within the
Subregion are extremely poor, which limit tourists to short
routes, ESCAP said in a report.
</P>
<P>
Airports or airfields in the Subregion, which play an
important role in tourism development, also needed to be upgraded,
it said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, ESCAP suggested that the six related countries ease
immigration restrictions for cross-border travel and develop a
single travel permit for touring within the Subregion.
</P>
<P>
In addition, ESCAP pointed out that although railway travel is
possible in Myanmar, Thailand and china's Yunnan province and
Vietnam, cross-border railway links are only available between
Yunnan and Vietnam.

But analysts believe that a Socialist cabinet in France is not
a good omen for the European Economic and Monetary Union (EMU),
which is to launch a single European currency, the euro, by the
end of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The victory of the Socialists, who are sceptical of the EMU and
opposed to Chirac's austerity policies to qualify France for the
EMU, makes France unlikely to be able to meet the budget deficit
criteria set down by the EMU.
</P>
<P>
The single currency requires a budget deficit ceiling of less
than three percent of the GDP.
</P>
<P>
Leader of Italy's largest left-wing party, Massio D'Alema, also
hailed the election victory of Jospin today, saying people in
Europe favor leftist governments, the ANSA news agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The leader of the former communist Democratic Party of the
Left, the largest partner in Italy's ruling center-left Olive Tree
coalition government, pointed out that 13 of the 15 member states
of the EU now had leftist governments.
</P>
<P>
"The clear success of Lionel Jospin, after the earlier one of
Tony Blair (in Britain), is a sign that the European people want
it to be left, with its values, its ability to govern and its
sense of responsibility, to steer the process of European
unification," D'Alema said.
</P>
<P>
He said he felt "satisfaction not only for the left and for
France, but also for his personal success which rewards his gifts
of intelligence, seriousness and likableness."
</P>
<P>
He added that his party was working on an orientation document
for discussion at the conference of European socialist parties in
Malmoe, Sweden, on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, according to
ANSA.
</P>
<P>
The document seeks to find ways to create a Europe with the
right policies for growth and jobs, for a more equitable welfare
system and greater involvement of the European parliament, D'Alema
said.
</P>
<P>
Party officials said the election of Jospin following that of
Blair increased the importance of the Malmoe meeting, which comes
shortly before the concluding sessions of the Inter-governmental
Conference for the revision of the EU's Maastricht Treaty.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- The video game of "Opium War" will
hit Chinese and overseas markets in mid-June to celebrate Hong
Kong's return to the motherland.
</P>
<P>
China's first video game that depicts an anti-invasion event in
modern times was developed by the Optical Memory National
Engineering Research Center of Qinghua University. "Opium War" is
aimed at teaching players about China's humiliating history of the
Opium War and inspiring patriotic spirit among Chinese.
</P>
<P>
Through playing, people can gain a better understanding of Lin
Zexu, whose ban of Britain's notorious opium trade with China
touched off the historic Opium War between China and Britain from
1840 to 1842.
</P>
<P>
They will also become familiar with other anti-British generals
such as Deng Tingzhen and Guan Tianpei in the war, which resulted
the ceding of Hong Kong to Britain.
</P>
<P>
After experimenting with the game, teachers and students at
Beijing Fourth Secondary School said that it is "interesting and
instructive."

BANGKOK June 3 (Xinhua) -- Thai consumer price index (CPI) for

previous month, according to the Business Economic Department of
the Thai Commerce Ministry.
</P>
<P>
The monthly index was up 0.4 percent from April. That increase
was attributed to a jump of 0.7 percent in the price of goods
under the non-food sector. In particular the price of clothing was
up 1.2 and the cost of educational necessities up 3 percent.

<HEADLINE> EU Urged to Accept Thai Products Inspection Standards </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Thailand is pressuring the European
Union (EU) to accept Thai inspection standards for goods exported
to the EU, according to a local press report today.
</P>
<P>
A Thai delegation will raise the issue at a Thai-EU joint
committee meeting on Thursday and Friday in Brussels.
</P>
<P>
The Thai side wants the EU to accept the quality and standard
of Thai products inspected and passed by Thai officials, a Thai
Foreign Ministry source was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Thai delegation also plans to joint three
economic cooperation programs established by the EU a few years
ago under its Asian strategy: the Asia eco-best program that
promotes investment in environmental technology; the Asia invest
program aimed at promoting two-way investment; and an economic
research and development program for emerging economies.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the source said, the Thai delegation would
raise the touchy issue of the EU's decision to cut the generalized
system of preferences on Thai shrimp exports to the EU.
</P>
<P>
The EU is Thailand's fourth-largest trading partner after
ASEAN, the United States and Japan. Two-way trade last year was
500 billion baht (20 billion US dollars), with Thailand recording
a trade surplus of about 50 billion baht (2 billion US dollars).

Malanggah sub-district office of Serang, Indonesia's West Java
province, reports reaching here today said.
</P>
<P>
Serang police chief Capt. Abdul Rochim confirmed the incident

"Police are still searching for the arsonists," he said.
</P>
<P>
In Jakarta, the military is to begin today the withdrawal of
soldiers deployed since April to reinforce security in the capital
city during campaigning and the election, military sources said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no longer a reason to maintain such a strong security
presence here because Jakarta has now returned to normal," said
head of the Jakarta military command Major General Sutiyoso.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Return Expected to Boost Inland Growth (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong can provide a broader
array of intermediary financial services to inland areas after its
return to the motherland in July, a senior banking official from
Hong Kong said here today.
</P>
<P>
For years, Hong Kong has been a bridgehead for inland area's
cooperation and exchange with the rest of the world, Andrew
L. T. Sheng, vice-chairman of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority
(HKMA), said at a recent international seminar on reform and
development in Guizhou, a less-developed province in the southwest.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that trade between the inland areas and
Hong Kong made up nearly half of the inland's total with the
outside world last year.
</P>
<P>
Date provided by HKMA show that Hong Kong's direct investment
in the inland has totaled 770 billion Hong Kong dollars, the
largest among all overseas investors.
</P>
<P>
Besides close trade ties, relations in the financial sector
have been growing even more rapidly between Hong Kong and the
inland, Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the banks registered in Hong Kong had opened
branches or representative offices in the inland by the end of
last year. Some of them have been approved to deal in business in
RMB yuan by the People's Bank of China, the central bank.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, more inland banks have set up subsidiaries in Hong
Kong. The Bank of China Group now has the second largest
subsidiary network in Hong Kong and is Hong Kong's third
note-issuing bank.
</P>
<P>
The China Construction Bank, the Agricultural Bank of China,
and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the other three
state-owned banks in the inland, have also obtained licenses for
issuing notes in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong has become a major pipeline through which syndicated
bank loans are arranged for the inland. Estimates say that 90
percent of the syndicated loans to the inland are arranged by Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that banks in Hong Kong had 298 billion Hong
Kong dollars in liabilities to inland banks while having 358
billion Hong Kong dollars in creditor's rights.

<P>
Sheng also said that currently 50 companies listed on the Stock
Exchange of Hong Kong are controled by inland investors. The
companies account for six percent of the stock market
capitalization.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the market capitalization of H shares issued
by inland companies has exceeded 36 billion Hong Kong dollars.
Hong Kong investors have also participated actively in trading of
B shares issued by inland firms through the stock exchanges in
Shanghai and Shenzhen. B shares are reserved for overseas
investors.
</P>
<P>
Sheng said that the HKMA is fully confident about the
continuation of Hong Kong as an international financial center.
</P>
<P>
The economies of Hong Kong and the inland areas are
complementary to each other and this will benefit Hong Kong as a
financial center, he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank predicts that in the next ten years China's
inland areas will need 800 billion US dollars for construction of
basic facilities necessary for further economic growth.
</P>
<P>
In the process, Hong Kong will provide a wider scope of
intermediary financial services for the inland areas, especially
for the resource-rich central and western parts, Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Hong Kong's direct investment in the inland has
extended beyond the Pearl River delta, which is in nearby
Guangdong Province, and expanded to the interior areas.
</P>
<P>
More investment from Hong Kong is now being poured into
projects in the infrastructure, such as energy and transportation,
Sheng said.
</P>
<P>
He also pointed out that Hong Kong can help the inland develop
the financial sector, as it has an advanced financial market of
its own, a diversity of financial products, and experienced
professional and management personnel.

<HEADLINE> Liaoning Province to Shake Off Poverty This Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENYANG, June 3 (Xinhua) -- Poor farmers in northeast China's
Liaoning Province will leave poverty behind by the end of this
year, as the provincial government pledges to wind up the
anti-poverty campaign as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
The province plans to help farmers in its remaining five poor
counties lead a life with adequate food and clothing, by ensuring
every village has convenient transportation, electricity, and
clean drinking water.
</P>
<P>
More than two million poor farmers in 11 counties have been
freed from poverty over the past decade thanks to concerted
efforts from people in all walks of life, said a provincial
official.
</P>
<P>
More than 4,000 officials were grouped into poverty relief
working teams, and they managed to have over one billion yuan
invested in the poor areas, involving more than 2,000 projects.
</P>
<P>
The officials helped farmers develop forest industry, raise
cattle, and grow greenhouse vegetables. As a result, the poor
farmers have greatly improved their life, with 594 kg of grain and
1390 yuan of income per capita.

<HEADLINE> Fiat Company Wins La Fenice Contract </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, June 2 (Xinhua) -- A construction company of the Fiat
Group, Impregilo, has been awarded the contract to rebuild the
historic La Fenice opera house destroyed by fire last year, The
ANSA news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Designers of the winning bid are internationally-known
architects Gae Aulenti and Antonio Foscari, together with
Margherita Petranzan.
</P>
<P>
Aulenti and Foscari restored the Fiat-owned Palazzo Grassi, a
popular museum in Venice.
</P>
<P>
The Impregilo bid reportedly defeated the Bologna-based CCC
firm on aesthetic grounds and because of the relatively low
maintenance costs proposed.
</P>
<P>
La Fenice was completely gutted by fire on the night of January
29, 1996.
</P>
<P>
After considering suggestions that La Fenice be rebuilt as a
modern opera house, a team of experts ruled that the theater
should be recreated just as it was on the original site in Venice.
</P>
<P>
Prosecutors investigating the blaze are pursuing two lines of
inquiry, both of which carry arson charges. In one hypothesis, the
fire was started by the mafia as part of a campaign to sow terror
by striking famous Italian monuments, ANSA said.
</P>
<P>
On May 22, however, Judge Felice Casson ordered the arrest of two
electricians who had been working with a crew inside the theater at
the time of the fire.
</P>
<P>
But, Casson is continuing to look into the possibility of a
mafia crime, said ANSA.

<HEADLINE> Uzbekstan Expects Good Grain Harvest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Favorable weather has enabled
Uzbekstan a better grain harvest than in previous years, according
to reports from the Uzbek capital of Tashkent.
</P>
<P>
Experts estimate that total grain output this year will reach 4
million tons as compared to 3.35 million tons last year.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekstan, a country with a population of 2.3 million, needs
3.8 to 4 million tons of grain a year to meet the consumption
demand. Uzbekstan has been trying hard to meet the goal.
</P>
<P>
At present, harvesting has begun in the southern
grain-producing regions, with 200 more combines being mobilized
for the season.

<HEADLINE> Fredericks Wins 100 Meters at Athletics Grand Prix </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Frankie Fredericks defeated
younger sprint rival Ato Boldon to win the 100 meters at the Grand
Prix II meeting at St. Denis on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Fredericks, the Olympic 100 and 200m silver medallist, clocked
10.09 seconds on a damp track as Trinidadian Boldon, third in the
short sprint in Atlanta, faded badly to finish fourth in 10.23,
compared with his season's fastest of 9.89.
</P>
<P>
The usually fast St. Denis track was made sluggish by
intermittent rain during the early evening and Fredericks was
never likely to threaten his season's best of 9.90.
</P>
<P>
Indeed it was Boldon who broke fastest at the gun and he led
clearly at 50m before being swallowed up as Fredericks used his
200m strength to roar through the centre ahead of American Brian
Lewis (10.19) and Davidson Ezinwa of Nigeria (10.20).
</P>
<P>
Other highlights of Monday's programme included an
authoritative performance by Moroccan Hicham El Guerrouj, who
clocked 3:31.76 in the 1,500m.
</P>
<P>
Veteran Jamaican Merlene Ottey won the women's 100m in 11.19,
pipping Nigerian Chioma Ajunwa by 1/100th of a second.
</P>
<P>
There was disappointment for Britain's Colin Jackson, who
finished a lowly fifth in the 110m hurdles in 13.57. American Mark
Crear won the race in 13.29.
</P>
<P>
France's Olympic champion Jean Galfione also fared badly,
surprisingly failing to clear 5.60m in the pole vault.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian surprise-package Gustavo
Kuerten and Morocco's hero Hicham Arazi kept their giantkilling
exploits at the French Open on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The two unlikely quarter-finalists continued their remarkable
run at the Championships -- Kuerten completing a five-set win over
dangerous Ukrainian Andrei Medvedev and Arazi putting out
seventh-seed Marcelo Rios of Chile.
</P>
<P>
The wins put the South American into a showdown with Russia's
titleholder Yevgeny Kafelnikov, while Arazi now faces the 1993 and
1994 champion Sergi Bruguera.
</P>
<P>
Bruguera, who is seeded 16, put out the second-seed and 1989
champion Michael Chang 3-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 while Galo Blanco,
ranked a modest 111th, in the world rankings made sure Spain had
two players in the last eight by defeating Petr Korda of the Czech
Republic 1-6, 6-1, 7-5, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
Blanco, 20, now plays Patrick Rafter, who won the
all-Australian clash against his old mate Mark Woodforde 6-2, 5-7,
6-1, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Arazi is the first Moroccan ever to reach the quarter-finals of
a Grand Slam tournament, Kuerten the first Brazilian to reach the
last eight at Roland Garros since Tomas Koch in 1968 and Rafter
the first Australian since Peter McNamara in 1982.

<HEADLINE> UK PM Promises 3 Billion Pound to Create Jobs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- British Prime Minister Tony Blair
today promised a better future for Britons by pumping into 3
billion pound (4.9 billion U.S. dollars) to create jobs for those
unemployed who only rely on welfare.
</P>
<P>
In his first speech outside parliament since he took powed on
May 2, Blair said, "To be a citizen of Britain is not just to hold
its passport, it is to share its aspirations, to be part of the
British family."
</P>
<P>
He said the government's maiden budget, to be presented to
parliament later in the day, would invest three billion pound to
put 250,000 unemployed people back to work, financed by taxing the
excess profits of privatized utilities.
</P>
<P>
"It will be the Welfare to Work budget. This will be the
Welfare to Work government," he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The government plans to get a total of 5 billion pound to
reform welfare and education by a windfall tax to utilities and
lottery companies.
</P>
<P>
Blair said the basis of the modern civic society "is an ethic
of mutual responsibility or duty. It is something for something. A
society where we play by the rules."
</P>
<P>
He said the government, in drawing up ambitious plans to reform
Britain's 90 billion pound a year welfare state, would not fall
into the trap of short-termism.
</P>
<P>
"This is a government with a new sense of purpose. A government
that believes in giving everyone the chance to succeed and get on
in life. It is a government that has a will to win," the prime
minister added.

Kaklamanis and visiting Chinese leader Li Ruihuan today expressed
their hope that bilateral ties between the two countries should be
further developed and such ties conform to the fundamental
interests of both sides.

democracy could only be decided by each country in accordance with
their own realities.

ancient civilized countries, now face the common task of
developing their economies and improving people's living
standards.

he noted, adding that the two countries have common aspirations of
safeguarding world peace and stability.
</P>

He said that China and Greece have common interests in
developing bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that my current visit will help continue the high-level
contacts between the two countries and further develop friendship
and cooperation," he said.
</P>
<P>
He also briefed Kaklamanis on China's development of democracy,
saying that democracy is an objective, a way and also a process.
</P>
<P>
Li stressed that the Chinese people's general objective is to
build their country into a rich, democratical and civilized
country.
</P>
<P>
He said he hopes that China and Greece should strengthen
exchange and dialogue and make contributions to modern democracy.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Takes Action in S. Leone at Invitation, </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The Nigeria Television Authority
said tonight the military intervention by Nigeria-led
multinational troops in Sierra Leone this morning was at the
invitation of the country's ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
The attack by the west African peacekeeping force on the
coupists who a week ago overthrew the civilian government led by
Kabbah has won wide welcome from the international community, the
national TV station reported.
</P>
<P>
The action was commended by African leaders at the summit of
the Organization of African Unity (OAU) currently being held in
Harare, Zimbabwe, it said.
</P>
<P>
Those speaking in favor of Nigeria and its allies include
United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, OAU
General-Secretary Salim Ahmed Salim and Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe, it added.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, this is Africa's first regional
military intervention to crack down upon rebellious actions that
usually lead to crisis and instability.
</P>
<P>
Today's attack followed the failure last night to strike a
peace agreement between west African countries, Britain, and
Major Johnny Paul Koroma, leader of the coupist Armed Forces
Revolutionary Council set up in the wake of the May 25 coup that
toppled the elected government.
</P>
<P>
Koroma last night announced a 20-member cabinet, triggering
off the military intervention.
</P>
<P>
Intense fighting is going on in Freetown, capital of Sierra
Leone. The west African multinational troops have taken under
control the Lungi International Airport near Freetown and made it
a base for receiving reinforcements.

WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Commerce Department
reported today that people traveling to the United States in 1996
were 7 percent more than in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The boom followed three straight years when the number of
travelers declined.
</P>
<P>
The report said that Canada had the largest number of arrivals
to the United States last year, topping 15 million. The department
estimates more than 18 million Canadians will visit the United
States between now and the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
More than 9 million people from Mexico traveled to the United
States last year, the second largest.
</P>
<P>
Japan remained on top as the most frequent travelers overseas,
with arrivals surpassing 5 million.
</P>
<P>
The report said that in the last 30 years tourism receipts in
the U.S. have increased more than 3,400 percent, jumping from 12
billion dollars in 1965 to 23 billion in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. tourism industry is the largest in the world, with
growth rates of travel receipts advancing at four times the
international average rate, the report said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Dollar Rises on Fears of Delay of Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. dollar shot up against
the German mark and rose against most major currencies Monday on
fears of a delayed launching of the common European currency in
1999.
</P>
<P>
Investors began selling European currencies after France's
national elections Sunday. France promised to soften requirements
for joining the European Union's single currency.
</P>
<P>
In Germany, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and the central bank
continued their public battle over the government's plans to cut
debt by revaluing the central bank's gold reserves.
</P>
<P>
Hardest hit of the European currencies was the German mark,
which came under intense selling pressure. In New York, the dollar
settled at 1.7300 marks, up from 1.7063 on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Against the yen, the dollar rose to 116.58 yen from 116.22 yen
Friday. The pound fell against the dollar, dropping to 1.6359 U.S.
dollars from 1.6410 U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
The dollar was also boosted Monday by a stronger-than-expected
report from the U.S., saying growth in the U.S. manufacturing
economy was surprisingly robust in May.
</P>
<P>
Traders viewed the report as new evidence of strong economic
growth that could push the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates
next month to thwart inflationary pressures.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Clinton Praises Survivors of Oklahoma Bombing Victims </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Monday was "a very important and
long overdue day" for victims' families and others touched by the
Oklahoma City bombing, U.S. President Bill Clinton said after the
guilty verdicts were announced.

Instead of commenting directly on the verdicts against Timothy
McVeigh, Clinton focused on the survivors and the families of the
bombing victims.
</P>
<P>
The courage they displayed in the face of profound personal
loss "has been an inspiration to all Americans," he said.
</P>
<P>
"No single verdict can bring an end to your anguish. Our
prayers are with you," Clinton said in a written statement.
</P>
<P>

federal prosecutors to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and
Firearms, the FBI and Attorney General Janet Reno.

<HEADLINE> Jury Convicts Oklahoma Bombing Suspect </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Timothy McVeigh was convicted
Monday of blowing up the Oklahoma City federal building two years
ago.
</P>
<P>
McVeigh, a 29-year-old Gulf War veteran, could get the death
penalty for the April 19, 1995, bombing that killed 168 people and
injured hundreds more in the deadliest act of terrorism on U.S.
soil.
</P>
<P>
The federal jury that took more than 20 hours over four days to
convict McVeigh of all 11 counts of murder and conspiracy will
return to Denver federal courthouse Wednesday to decide if he
should pay with his life, according to news reports.
</P>
<P>
Cheers erupted outside the courthouse and at the bombing site,
where about 500 people gathered to hear the verdict. Victims'
relatives hugged and wept.
</P>
<P>
In Washington, U.S. President Bill Clinton said the verdict
heralded "a very important and long overdue day for the survivors
and families of those who died in Oklahoma City."
</P>
<P>
The verdict came just over two years after the explosion that
brought terror to the nation's heartland.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Sees no Change in Ties with France After Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The election of the Socialist
government in France will not influence the U.S.-French relations,
the White House said today.
</P>
<P>
White House Spokesman Michael McCurry told reporters that the
U.S. would "work closely" with a new French government, which is
to be formed by Lionel Jospin, the elected prime minister.
</P>
<P>
"We have a very close working relationship with the French
government. We continue to effectively explore our bilateral
concerns during periods of cohabitation, and we look forward to
working with the new government of Prime Minister Jospin," McCurry
said.
</P>
<P>
The French Socialist Party and its allies on the left scored a
decisive victory on Sunday, leaving French President Jacques
Chirac and U.S. President Bill Clinton in a similar position. Both
presidents have to work in tandem with their opposition.
</P>
<P>
"We've got an enduring interest that we explore through our
close and warm bilateral relationship with France...we would seek
a very active, productive, warm relationship with all elements of
the French government," McCurry stressed.
</P>
<P>
Late on Sunday, a U.S. State Department spokeswoman
congratulates France's Socialist Party for its victory and said
she looks forward to the establishment of the new government.

<HEADLINE> Waigel to Seek Compromise with Bundesbank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, June 2 (Xinhua) -- German Finance Minister Theo Waigel
today said he would try to reach a compromise with the German
central bank before going ahead with his plan to revalue its gold
reserves in a bid to qualify for the single European currency.
</P>
<P>
But, speaking to reporters in the southern German city of
Munich, Waigel stressed that he would proceed with the plan even
without the assent of the central bank, known as the Bundesbank.
</P>
<P>
He said the main question now was whether the revaluation plan
could begin this year or next year, adding that he thought the
Bundesbank would be amenable to a revaluation in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The German government has triggered a feud with the Bundesbank
with the plan announced last month to revalue the bank's gold
reserves in line with market prices and to use the windfall to
reduce its debt to qualify for the planned single European
currency, the Euro.
</P>
<P>
The Bundesbank has warned that the government plan would
infringe on the bank's independence, and risk "a loss in trust in
the stability of the future European currency".
</P>
<P>
Defending the move, German Chancellor Helmut Kohl told a
meeting of bankers Monday in Switzerland that the gold revaluation
payout for Bonn would help Germany in its difficult struggle to
meet the strict debt and budget criteria for join the Euro at its
launching on January 1, 1999.
</P>
<P>
"There are historic chances, which, if wasted once, will not
come again in the near future," Kohl was quoted by German media as
saying.
</P>
<P>
"Naturally Germany wants to, and will meet the Maastricht debt
criteria," Kohl added.
</P>
<P>
Amid growing political tensions at home, Kohl Monday canceled
a speech due to be delivered Wednesday to a Western European Union
assembly in Paris because he wants to take part in a parliament
debate called by the main opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD)
on its request for Waigel's resignation.
</P>
<P>
Kohl will also have to tackle a standoff with the junior
partner in his ruling coalition -- Free Democratic Party -- over
whether to raise taxes to meet budget shortfalls for this year and
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The quarrel is said to have threatened Kohl's centre-right
ruling coalition and has already prompted the SPD to call for an
early election.
