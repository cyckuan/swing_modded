<HEADLINE> Virginia Escapee Pleads Guilty </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- Nearly 25 years after he fled a  
Virginia jail work crew, Alfred Odell Martin III pleaded guilty 
Wednesday to escaping from his one-year term for selling $10 worth 
of marijuana. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 49, who built a respectable life in Michigan, faces up  
to five years in prison at his February sentencing, but his family 
is hoping for probation. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is a huge sense of relief that this cloud that has been  
over him now for 24 years is going to be resolved,'' defense 
attorney Ben Gardner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case prosecutor said she would not push for jail time for  
Martin, who returned to Virginia in December and is currently 
serving out his one-year drug term. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin had served less than two days of his sentence when he  
left a Martinsville jail work crew in February 1974. He married and 
settled in the Detroit suburb of Livonia where he raised three 
children and worked for a mortgage company. 
</P>
<P>
	Virginia first sought his extradition in 1974, but then-Gov.  
William Milliken granted Martin legal asylum. The state sought him 
again in November, and this time a Michigan judge ordered him 
returned.

<HEADLINE> Quorum To Leave Columbia/HCA Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRENTWOOD, Tenn. (AP) -- The U.S. Justice Department has agreed  
to remove Quorum Health Group Inc. from a whistleblower lawsuit 
accusing the hospital management chain and Columbia/HCA Healthcare 
Corp. of scheming to defraud Medicare and Medicaid, company 
officials said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The moves allows Brentwood, Tenn.-based Quorum to move forward  
with efforts to settle the case on its own, said James E. Dalton 
Jr., company president. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed in 1993 by James Alderson, then chief  
financial officer at North Valley Hospital in Whitefish, Mont. He 
claimed Quorum executives brought in to manage the hospital filed 
false Medicaid and Medicare claims. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit claims Quorum followed the same billing procedure as  
Nashville-based HCA, which owned the company until 1989. HCA merged 
with Columbia in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit is separate from the wide-ranging federal fraud  
investigation targeting Columbia/HCA, the nation's largest private 
hospital chain. Investigators are looking into whether Columbia 
overbilled government health care programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Nashville, Tenn.-based Columbia/HCA owns about 330 hospitals in  
35 states. Quorum manages 240 hospitals and owns 20.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Home shoppers can buy airline tickets, Beanie  
Babies and garden tools via computer. Why not a $9 million 
Rembrandt painting? 
</P>
<P>
	Sotheby's, the New York auction house, said Tuesday that it will  
spend $25 million to launch sothebys.com, an Internet site where 
the public will be able to bid on antiques, art, jewelry, sports 
memorabilia and other collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of items on the virtual auction block initially will  
be capped at about $10,000. More expensive items will be posted 
when imaging technology improves enough to give clear views of 
items from multiple angles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no point in having a fuzzy image on a $100,000 item,''  
said Susan Solomon, head of the new venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotheby's first major online auction, planned for July, will  
feature baseball memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	While online auction sites have become extremely popular,  
consumer groups say the sites have produced more consumer 
complaints than any other Internet category because of shoddy 
merchandise and other fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotheby's said it would only sell merchandise from the auction  
house itself or reputable art dealers. And bids will only be 
accepted from customers who have registered their charge card 
numbers in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Christie's, another leading New York auction house,  
said they were also considering an online auction site.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tobacco Remarks Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The jury in the first class-action lawsuit by  
smokers to reach trial could have been tainted by President 
Clinton's remarks about a tobacco suit during the State of the 
Union address, industry attorneys said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Robert Heim, who represents Philip Morris Inc., said an  
estimated 60 million viewers watched Clinton say on television that 
the federal government will sue cigarette makers to recover 
smoking-related costs spend through Medicare and other federal 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a substantial concern about the jury,'' Heim said.  
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department action follows the lead of the states,  
which settled similar lawsuits for a total of $246 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Rosenblatt, attorney for the nine plaintiffs  
representing an estimated half-million sick Floridians who blame 
smoking for their illnesses, said there was nothing new in the 
president's words. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we look at this thing realistically, tobacco issues,  
tobacco and health have been very controversial in this country for 
several years now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Circuit Judge Robert Kaye questioned four jurors who said they'd  
either heard Clinton's speech or heard about it. All said it would 
not influence their judgment. Kaye said he was satisfied that no 
court rules were broken. 
</P>
<P>
	The sick smokers claim tobacco makers conspired to mislead them  
about the dangers of smoking and worked to keep smokers hooked. 
They are seeking at least $200 billion in damages.

<HEADLINE> ACLU Asks for Secrecy in Porn Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties  
Union asked a judge Wednesday to close parts of a hearing 
challenging a federal law to keep Internet pornography away from 
children. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU said some of the other plaintiffs wanted to present  
information containing trade secrets, business plans and other 
financial information as part of their case. Lawyers for the U.S. 
Justice Department opposed closing any part of the proceedings to 
the public. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. District Judge Lowell A. Reed recessed the hearing to allow  
lawyers for both sides to discuss the move. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU is challenging the Child Online Protection Act, the  
second major effort by Congress to protect children using the 
Internet. The law would require commercial Web sites to collect a 
credit card number or some other access code as proof of age before 
allowing Internet users to view material deemed ``harmful to 
minors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Violators would face up to six months in jail and a $50,000  
fine. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the law is a sensible way to keep Internet  
pornography away from children. Unlike the Communications Decency 
Act of 1996, which the Supreme Court struck down on First Amendment 
grounds, the new law applies only to commercial sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU says the law, signed by President Clinton in October  
but now on hold, also violates the First Amendment and could be 
used to unfairly prosecute homosexuals, AIDS activists, or doctors 
distributing gynecological information. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Reed temporarily blocked enforcement of the law.  
The judge is expected to decide by Feb. 1 whether a preliminary 
injunction -- a more permanent delay -- should be issued. 
</P>
<P>
	As the three-day hearing began Wednesday, Donna Hoffman, a  
professor of management at Vanderbilt University, was the ACLU's 
first witness. She testified that 75 percent of Web users would not 
give up personal information to gain access to a site. She said 66 
percent would not give up personal information even if registration 
were anonymous. 
</P>
<P>
	``The issue is one of privacy,'' Ms. Hoffman said.

<HEADLINE> Many Agendas On Capitol Hill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lest anyone forget, Democrats in Congress have  
their own agenda apart from the one advanced by President Clinton 
in the State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats outlined a list of 11 priority bills on  
Tuesday, including a patient's bill of rights, a 50-cent increase 
in the minimum wage, expanded access to Medicare for people aged 
55-64, cleanup of old industrial sites and campaign finance reforms 
that include a ban on ``soft'' money. 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats, in the minority in both the House and Senate, have a  
difficult time moving their agenda forward unless Clinton is firmly 
behind them. And some say that Republican insistence to the 
contrary, the Senate impeachment trial will be a major hindrance to 
progress on the issues. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the kinds of issues the Senate should already be  
taking up,'' said Sen. Edward M. Kennedy, D-Mass. ``It is time to 
bring the impeachment trial to a fair and quick conclusion.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	One group whose job is to be influential says Congress should be  
exceptionally active this year, apart from the Senate impeachment 
trial of President Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I ask my fellow lobbyists what they expect this year,  
they often tell me that they don't expect much but then add they 
are quite busy,'' said Kenneth E. Feltman, president of the 
American League of Lobbyists. 
</P>
<P>
	Feltman, also head of the Employers Council on Flexible  
Compensation, said lobbyists have been working quietly with 
congressional staff on research that will lead to major pieces of 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The public is watching,'' Feltman said Tuesday. ``Both the  
White House and Republicans must demonstrate that they can get 
things done.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Before impeachment trial proceedings began Tuesday, it was the  
first chance for senators to introduce bills for this session of 
Congress. They were popping up right and left to get their items in 
the hopper during the morning. 
</P>
<P>
	One important proposal that might not get a lot of public  
attention was introduced by Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M., to reduce 
use of so-called ``emergency spending'' often requested by 
presidents for items that aren't actually emergencies. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans objected last year to President Clinton's request  
for $21 billion for such things as the long-standing military 
operation in Bosnia and the Year 2000 computer problem. They saw 
those requests are poor planning, rather than actual emergencies 
such as plummeting farm prices and natural disasters. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill by Domenici, who is chairman of the Senate Budget  
Committee, would require that 60 of the 100 senators vote for any 
spending item designated as an emergency, instead of a simple 
51-vote majority. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have accomplished a great deal in recent years and now we  
need to find a way to change our budget process in such a manner to 
stop erosion on the spending side,'' Domenici said. 
</P>
<P>
	Among other things, the legislation also would prevent future  
government shutdowns by providing for automatic continuation of 
current levels of spending if a budget isn't passed before the end 
of the fiscal year. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Some House Democrats offered sharp denunciations of President  
Clinton's desire to increase military spending by $112 billion over 
the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
	In delivering the second annual ``Progressive State of the Union  
Address,'' Rep. Peter DeFazio, D-Ore., urged Clinton to focus on a 
``fairness agenda,'' including jobs, livable wages, health 
insurance, better education and Social Security reform. 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized Clinton's plans to increase defense spending,  
beginning with a $12 billion installment and a 4 percent boost in 
military pay for fiscal 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's time for the Pentagon to make the hard choices necessary  
to meet the challenges of the next century,'' DeFazio said. ``The 
Pentagon needs to start dwelling in the reality of the current 
world instead of a Tom Clancy novel.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Barbara Lee, D-Calif., said the economic recovery has been  
lopsided -- ``only for some Americans and not all Americans'' -- and 
that the money should be used to meet vital, human needs instead of 
to increase the military arsenal. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's proposals to increase military funding is  
simply wrong,'' she said.

<HEADLINE> Chancellor Media May Sell Assets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Shares of Chancellor Media soared 20 percent  
Wednesday as the nation's biggest radio broadcasting group said it 
is considering selling off some or all of its assets. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor's stock had been lagging those of other media groups  
even as it has spent billions of dollars buying up competitors. The 
company's directors hope that by putting assets on the market it 
might gain more favor among investors. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to radio stations, the company also has television  
holdings and an outdoor advertising business. Chancellor has 
retained BT Alex Brown Inc. to analyze how the company should be 
reshaped. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's in the shareholders' interest to go through with this,''  
Chancellor spokesman Joe Jaffoni said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor stock, which trades under the symbol AMFM, closed up  
$9.18 3/4 at $54.75 a share in trading on the Nasdaq Stock Market. 
</P>
<P>
	Although each of Chancellor's operating areas has had the best  
results in the industry, there is a ``substantial disparity'' 
between the market valuation of Chancellor and its peers, said 
Jeffrey A. Marcus, president and chief executive officer. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been the Rodney Dangerfield of the radio business,''  
said Marcus. ``We were languishing in the $40s, and that's just not 
right.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The results we turn in quarter after quarter, if not the best,  
they're at the top of the class, and yet we can't get any 
recognition on Wall Street,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The options for Chancellor could range from the sale of a single  
company unit to selling the entire company. Marcus declined to 
comment whether any deals were in the works following the 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	When pending transactions close, Chancellor Radio Group will  
have 465 stations in 105 markets and a weekly listener base of 65 
million, and Chancellor Television Group will operate 13 
network-affiliated television stations in eight markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Chancellor Outdoor Group is the nation's fifth-largest outdoor  
advertising company with more than 36,000 billboards in 37 states, 
the company said.

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Rebuffs Baby Bells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's biggest local phone companies  
lost a bid Tuesday to provide long-distance service to customers 
without having to meet requirements of a 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court, without comment, rejected appeals by three  
Bell telephone companies -- SBC Communications, US West and Bell 
Atlantic -- that the law unconstitutionally singles them out for 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The law requires the five Baby Bells to open their local phone  
markets to long-distance companies and other potential rivals 
before the Federal Communications Commission will let them sell 
their own long-distance service to local customers. This 
requirements doesn't apply to other local phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	No Bell company has yet won such FCC approval because, the  
commission says, none has sufficiently opened its market. 
</P>
<P>
	In other business-related decisions Tuesday, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Left intact a $2 billion class-action settlement over  
allegations that insurance agents for Prudential Insurance Co. 
misled policyholders over a 13-year period. The justices, without 
comment, rejected appeals from some policyholders who challenged 
the 1997 settlement's fairness. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement covered more than 8 million policyholders who may  
have been duped into buying devalued insurance policies. Of the 
potential class members, only 1.1 million had applied by last 
summer to receive any compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to revive a massive civil rights lawsuit against many  
of the nation's largest insurance companies filed on behalf of 
93,000 homeowners living in predominantly black neighborhoods of 
St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo. The justices, without comment, left 
intact rulings that threw out the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 lawsuit accused insurance companies of discriminatory  
``redlining'' -- refusing to sell homeowners insurance on equal 
terms based on the racial composition of their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	--Left intact the $1-per-head fee cattle producers must pay on  
all cattle sold in or imported to the United States to fund generic 
advertising for beef and beef products. The court, without comment, 
rejected a Kansas cattle rancher's challenge to the fee required by 
a 1985 federal law, the Beef Promotion and Research Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Goetz's lawsuit, filed on behalf of all other cattle  
producers, contended that the fee violates free-speech and 
equal-protection rights and amounts to an unlawful tax. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to revive an effort by ticket buyers' to force  
Ticketmaster to pay triple damages for alleged overcharges. The 
lawsuit accused Ticketmaster of monopolizing the ticket-sales 
business for large popular music concerts and of using its 
advantage to charge sales and handling fees as high as $20 per 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC hailed the Supreme Court's decision to let stand rulings  
by courts in New Orleans and the District of Columbia, that upheld 
the constitutionality of the long-distance requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The companies should stop litigating and give Americans what  
they want -- choice,'' said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West called the court decision ``a real setback for  
consumers. It further delays long-distance choice for customers,'' 
said spokesman David Beigie. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, meanwhile, is working to open its markets to  
competitors and is expected this year to ask the FCC for permission 
to provide long-distance to local customers in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our long-distance effort is alive and well and strong despite  
the high court's decision,'' said Bell Atlantic spokeswoman Shannon 
Fioravanti. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC said it will continue to work with federal and state  
regulators to get into the long-distance business. ``We are more 
determined than ever to win the right to provide the full range of 
services our customers demand and deserve,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Bell company, BellSouth, said it has no plans to  
withdraw an appeal to the Supreme Court based on the same 
constitutional arguments made by Bell Atlantic, U S West and SBC. 
That appeal, however, challenges electronic publishing provisions 
in the 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining Bell company, Ameritech, didn't have any immediate  
comment on the Supreme Court's action. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution bars a law that is punitive as it applies to an  
individual or a specific group. The three phone companies' argued 
in their appeals that the 1996 law subjected them to such a ``bill 
of attainder.'' Government lawyers, defending the provisions, 
disagreed.

<HEADLINE> Court Hears Race-Districting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Supreme Court hostile to election districts  
drawn with race in mind soon may provide important new guidelines 
for policing the map-making efforts of state and local lawmakers. 
</P>
<P>
	While hearing arguments in a North Carolina case Wednesday, the  
justices wrestled with a key issue: How much evidence is needed to 
conclude that an election district is the product of unlawful 
gerrymandering because racial considerations played too large a 
role? 
</P>
<P>
	The court's decision, expected by late June, could have enormous  
influence on political redistricting nationwide after the 2000 
census. 
</P>
<P>
	A redistricting plan based on partisan politics cannot be ruled  
unlawful just because ``it happens to correlate with race,'' 
Washington lawyer Walter Dellinger argued in defending the makeup 
of North Carolina's 12th congressional district, now represented by 
Democrat Mel Watts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a Democratic district that makes sense,'' Dellinger  
told the court. 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson Everett, a Durham, N.C., lawyer representing voters who  
successfully challenged the 12th District in a lower court, said 
state legislators had ``used code'' in considering how to draw it 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said 'Democrats' but these are particular Democrats who  
are African-Americans,'' Everett contended in discussing how some 
of the district's boundary lines were drawn. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of decisions since 1993, the Supreme Court has  
scuttled attempts by state and local lawmakers to draw districts 
that preserve or enhance minority candidates' chances to win if 
race was a ``predominant factor.'' Most of those rulings were 
reached by 5-4 votes that traced the court's ideological divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Redrawing 12 congressional districts after the 1990 census, the  
North Carolina Legislature created two majority-black districts in 
1992 -- the 1st and 12th -- and voters that year sent the state's 
first blacks to Congress since 1901. 
</P>
<P>
	That 1992 redistricting sparked two Supreme Court decisions, one  
in 1996 that struck down the 12th District as unlawful. The 
Legislature redrew the district in 1997, one in which blacks 
comprise 47 percent of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge federal court ruled last April that the 1997 plan  
was unlawful, too. The three-judge court did not conduct a full 
trial but made what lawyers call a ``summary judgment'' after 
considering the district's shape and its racial makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a key member of the highest court's  
slender majority in past redistricting cases, appeared sympathetic 
Wednesday to North Carolina's district-drawing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may well have been sufficient evidence to preclude the  
(lower) court from granting summary judgment,'' she told Everett at 
one point. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Antonin Scalia seemed to think the three-judge court  
was entitled to take recent history into account. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a legislature that has been pulled, kicking and  
dragging, into drawing a district that does not take race into 
account,'' Scalia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions and comments from other justices suggested the court  
may be closely divided again. Its eventual decision is sure to be 
studied by political map drawers for new insights into the ``dos'' 
and ``don'ts'' of redistricting efforts.

<HEADLINE> Year Ago, America Woke Up to Monica </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- One year ago, America awoke to a shocking  
story of a presidential affair with a young intern, complete with 
ominous allegations of a White House cover-up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton Accused of Urging Aide to Lie,'' boomed The Washington  
Post's headline on Jan. 21, 1998. ``Starr Examines Clinton Link to 
Female Intern,'' intoned the Los Angeles Times, the other newspaper 
to break news of Whitewater prosecutor Kenneth Starr's new case 
involving the little-known Monica Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters swarmed the White House. TV networks carried live  
updates throughout the day. The three top anchormen -- all in Cuba 
to cover the Pope's historic visit -- rushed home to cover the sex 
story. Suddenly Ms. Lewinsky's acquaintances from Beverly Hills 
High and Lewis &AMP; Clark College found themselves hot sources. 
</P>
<P>
	Three times that first, frantic day, President Clinton denied  
the story. Already, officials in Washington were speculating about 
impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would not say he is immune from consideration of impeachment  
should these allegations prove to be correct,'' House Judiciary 
Committee Henry Hyde said that day. 
</P>
<P>
	One year later, Clinton is on trial in the Senate, only the  
second president ever impeached by the House. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Lewinsky, who spent her first day of fame holed up in her  
apartment in the Watergate complex, has fled Washington. She's been 
working on a book, lining up interviews and awaiting a possible 
summons from the Senate for further questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Her former attorney William Ginsburg, a constant presence on  
television in the early days of the scandal, has returned to his 
medical malpractice firm in Los Angeles after being replaced by two 
veteran Washington lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Betty Currie, the secretary whose testimony about secret phone  
calls and gifts hidden under her bed is central to the impeachment 
charges, still works just outside the Oval Office. 
</P>
<P>
	And Linda Tripp, the woman whose recordings of telephone  
conversations with Ms. Lewinsky prompted Starr's investigation, is 
herself the focus of an investigation into whether her secret 
tapings violated Maryland law.

<HEADLINE> Couple Leaves $60M to Caltech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PASADENA, Calif. (AP) -- The California Institute of Technology  
has received a $60 million bequest from the estate of a San Diego 
couple, the school said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The gift from philanthropists Rea and Lela ``Jackie'' Axline is  
one of the largest in higher education for direct student support, 
Caltech said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Providing sufficient graduate and undergraduate student aid to  
attract the very best students to Caltech is one of our greatest 
challenges,'' Caltech President David Baltimore said in a 
statement. 
</P>
<P>
	The award follows the Dec. 24 death of Mrs. Axline. She was 88.  
Her husband, Rea, who died in 1992 at age 85, graduated from 
Caltech in 1931 and made a fortune from a process for coating metal 
alloys onto other metal objects. 
</P>
<P>
	It was announced earlier this month that the Axlines left $60  
million to the Museum of Contemporary Art in La Jolla and the San 
Diego Museum of Art in Balboa Park. 
</P>
<P>
	Axline patented his coating process during the Depression. It  
became particularly important during World War II, when the U.S. 
military began coating submarines, tanks and other vehicles.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Y2K Czar: Systems Will Be OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The president's Y2K point man said Wednesday the  
federal government is responding well to the computer bug, but 
small businesses and other countries are falling behind. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony in Washington before the House's Government Reform  
and Oversight committee and the Committee on Science, John Koskinen 
said more than 80 percent of the government's systems would meet 
President Clinton's March 31 deadline for being ready to begin 
final testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that all of the government's critical systems will  
be Y2K compliant before Jan. 1, 2000,'' he said, according 
transcripts of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug occurs because many computers programmed to  
recognize only the last two digits of a year won't work properly 
beginning Jan. 1, 2000, when machines will assume it is 1900. Some 
computers can be reprogrammed, but many devices have embedded 
microchips that must be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of Management and Budget estimates the problem will  
cost the federal government $5.4 billion, although some private 
groups estimate it could run closer to $6 billion. The agency said 
last month that roughly 60 percent of the government's 6,696 most 
important computers are compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the agency's reports and Koskinen's testimony, Rep.  
Stephen Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the science committee, was not 
so optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish him well and I hope he's right,'' he said. ``We'll soon  
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horn has long criticized the Clinton administration's efforts on  
Y2K, giving the government a ``D'' grade in November for its 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The OMB had set Sept. 30 as the deadline for all agencies to  
have their mission-critical systems renovated. Most agencies missed 
that deadline, as Tim Wilson, publisher of Y2K News, a magazine 
dedicated to the bug, pointed out. ``I don't blame Congressman Horn 
for being skeptical,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Radio Stations in Legal Battle </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EASTON, Pa. (AP) -- Sundays are definitely Italian time in  
Easton. 
</P>
<P>
	Over at the lobby of WEST-AM radio, platters of steaming pasta  
and crunchy biscotti are passed around while first- and 
second-generation Italians sing along to the croonings of Louis 
Prima and Frank Sinatra. 
</P>
<P>
	Across town, some of the same Italian pop and folk songs fill  
the air on WEEX-AM, prompting dozens of listeners to call in and 
request their favorite tunes or just recall their Italian roots. 
</P>
<P>
	``It brings back memories of when mom would make the sauce, the  
meatballs,'' said Turiddi Sal Bartolotta, 67, a first-generation 
American from neighboring Phillipsburg who favors the show on WEST. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents now get to choose whether they want to listen to John  
and Pam Richetta, hosts of ``Tempo Italiano'' on WEST from 9 a.m. 
to 3 p.m., or former Easton Mayor Sal Panto Jr., host of WEEX's 
``Festa Musica D'Italia,'' from 7 a.m. to 2 p.m. 
</P>
<P>
	The dueling radio shows have spurred legal wrangling in this  
eastern Pennsylvania town of 27,000 about 50 miles north of 
Philadelphia. Both stations have filed injunctions seeking to use 
the name ``Tempo Italiano,'' which means ``It's Italian Time'' in 
English. 
</P>
<P>
	A judge has given the Richettas the temporary right to use the  
name. A final hearing on the matter was scheduled for today at the 
Northampton County Courthouse. 
</P>
<P>
	The Richettas started ``Tempo Italiano'' in January 1998 at the  
request of WEEX, which found support for the idea in marketing 
surveys and focus groups among its target listening audience, 
people between age 35 and 64. 
</P>
<P>
	The new show was an immediate hit, in large part because of  
extensive research by Pam Richetta, who talked to friends in Milan, 
watched Italian variety shows and monitored Italy's Top 20 charts. 
</P>
<P>
	WEEX has said that the Richettas' show increased its Arbitron  
ratings -- which rates radio shows in much the same way as Nielsen 
does for television -- by 220 percent and accounted for more than 50 
percent of the station's advertising income. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have been so surprised and pleased with the response. It's  
something I'd done at Italian weddings and parties,'' John Richetta 
said. ``I'd always wanted to do a show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In December, after failing to negotiate a multi-year contract  
with WEEX, the Richettas agreed to move their show -- name and all -- 
to WEST. Two weeks ago, WEEX aired its version of ``Tempo 
Italiano'' with Panto as host. 
</P>
<P>
	Though both shows play Italian music, the similarities end  
there. ``Tempo Italiano'' is more international, with about 
three-quarters of the music sung in Italian and the remainder sung 
in English by Italian stars. 
</P>
<P>
	Panto's rival show is clearly more dedicated to  
Italian-Americans, with Frank Sinatra, Perry Como and Tony Bennett 
in heavy rotation. Ninety percent of the music is in English, with 
a few popular Italian songs or operas thrown in. 
</P>
<P>
	``Judging from the phone calls and requests, there are enough  
listeners for both shows,'' Panto said. ``I'm not competing with 
John and Pam. It's just a chance for me to give something back to 
the Italian community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Richettas also believe there are enough listeners in the  
Italian community of about 4,000 to support both shows, neither one 
of which reaches too far outside the Lehigh Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, there are die-hard fans on either side of the radio dial.  
</P>
<P>
	``I like to hear old-time music, just like the old folks used to  
listen to,'' said WEEX listener Mary Wallaesa, 72, of Easton, whose 
parents are from Sicily. ``I just enjoy the upbeat Italian music 
while I'm starting dinner for my family.''

<HEADLINE> Portland Is No Ordinary Beer Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PORTLAND, Ore. (AP) -- What does it take to get a Miller Lite in  
this town? 
</P>
<P>
	Oregon has more microbreweries per capita than any other place  
in the nation, turning out all sorts of exotic brews in hues of 
amber, brown and black. Nowadays, ordering up an ordinary beer in 
some places can draw a haughty stare. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you had the choice between Spam and filet mignon, which  
would you choose?'' says beer drinker Spike Cornelius. ``That's the 
problem with the typical mass-produced American beers -- they're 
insipid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In a town where loggers and salmon fishermen once ended the day  
by guzzling nickel brew in dark saloons, beer geeks with goatees 
now sit behind gleaming brass bars, swirling beer in their glass 
like bordeaux and discussing the finer points of hoppiness and 
drinkability. 
</P>
<P>
	``People never really considered beer a cuisine before,'' says  
Mike Sherwood, director of the Oregon Brewers' Guild. ``We've got 
juniper-flavored, chamomile, rosemary, basil, raspberry and 
lavender beers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``These are sipping-around-the-fireplace-type beers. You don't  
chug down a six-pack of microbrew. It stays on the palate a lot 
longer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Each year, Oregon's 72 breweries churn out 1 million kegs and  
more than 1,000 varieties of wheat beers, pale ales, porters and 
stouts with such names as Pyramid, Blue Heron and Obsidian. 
</P>
<P>
	At Portland-area supermarkets, microbrews now account for 10  
percent of the market, compared with 3 percent nationwide. Beer 
aisles brim with apricot ales, hazelnut stouts, blackberry wheat 
beers, and honey-tinged lagers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a lot different than it used to be in high school and  
college,'' says Steve Uchida, 31. ``The last time I had a Miller 
was a couple years ago. I'm maturing as a drinker. Now I try to 
enjoy the flavor of it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	About 60 percent of all draft beers poured at Portland bars are  
brewed locally. But there are still pockets of resistance. 
</P>
<P>
	At Patty's Retreat, 55-year-old barmaid Kay Scott pulls the  
handle on the solitary tap and draws another pint of Pabst Blue 
Ribbon. ``I've had people come in here and ask for microbrews, and 
when I tell them what I've got, they just walk out,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	At the bar, old-timer Eugene McIntyre cradles his glass of pale  
yellow suds and scoffs at gourmet beer. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a fad,'' the 69-year-old says as a Neil Diamond tune  
drones from the jukebox. ``I never drink the stuff. After two 
beers, a man doesn't really know what he's drinking anyway.''

<HEADLINE> 11 Deaths Blamed on Tainted Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A strain of a deadly bacteria traced to a Zeeland, Mich., meat  
plant is now blamed with causing 11 deaths and three miscarriages 
in 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday  
its tests trace the contamination back to listeria bacteria found 
in hot dogs and deli meats made at Sara Lee Corp.'s Bil Mar Foods 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	The fatalities have been reported Arizona, Connecticut, Georgia,  
Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New York, Ohio, Oregon, 
Tennessee, Vermont and West Virginia. An exact breakdown of the 
deaths was not available. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,800 cases of food poisoning caused by listeria are  
reported annually in the United States. Healthy people usually can 
fight off the bacterium with no more than flu-like symptoms. But 
listeria can kill, causing meningitis or blood infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest listeria outbreak occurred in California in  
1985, according to the CDC. Forty-eight people died and 66 
miscarriages were reported from contaminated Mexican-style cheese.

<HEADLINE> NATO Disunity May Benefit Milosevic </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Any show of disunity by NATO allies in  
confronting Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic will embolden him 
to defy threats of air strikes that would punish him for breaking 
the Kosovo cease-fire accord, Balkan analysts warn. 
</P>
<P>
	``What Milosevic is doing is playing a strategic game; he's  
calibrating what the alliance and the Clinton administration is 
capable of mustering in way of a response at this stage,'' George 
Biddle, vice president of the International Crisis Group, said 
Wednesday. The group is an independent organization monitoring the 
peace process in the Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, the Yugoslav strongman sent packing NATO's two top  
generals who had gone to Belgrade to deliver a tough warning that 
the Yugoslav security forces had to stop attacking ethnic Albanian 
rebels in Serbia's Kosovo province. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic had left the two -- Gen. Wesley Clark, the allied  
commander in Europe, and Gen. Klaus Naumann, the chairman of the 
NATO Military Committee -- waiting for an entire day before 
receiving them. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, State Department spokesman James P. Rubin  
described the talks in Belgrade as ``deeply troubling.'' He said 
the Serbian leader's responses were ``unsatisfactory across the 
board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At least 2,000 people died and 200,000 were left homeless in  
seven months of combat in Kosovo between Yugoslav security forces 
and ethnic Albanian insurgents fighting for the independence of the 
province. 
</P>
<P>
	The conflict ended in a cease-fire in October after NATO had  
threatened to carry out massive air strikes against Serb targets. 
</P>
<P>
	But last week, at least 45 ethnic Albanians were killed in a  
village in southern Kosovo that had been under attack by the 
security forces. 
</P>
<P>
	When William Walker, the American head of a mission to verify  
compliance with the truce, accused the Serbs of responsibility for 
the massacre, he was ordered to leave the country, although Deputy 
Prime Minister Vuk Draskovic said Wednesday that issue might be 
resolved with a compromise. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, U.N. war crimes prosecutor Louise Arbour was barred  
from entering Kosovo when she tried to investigate the killings. 
</P>
<P>
	``If all that isn't poking your finger in the eye of the West, I  
don't know what is,'' Biddle said. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that NATO credibility was now on the line and that  
strong U.S. leadership would be required to formulate a united 
response to Milosevic's ``provocations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Hooper, head of the Balkan Action Council, a private  
Washington think tank that aims to educate the public on the Balkan 
crises, warned that Milosevic was bent on undermining NATO 
credibility before the alliance's 50th anniversary summit in 
Washington in April. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he may be shooting Kosovo Albanians, but he's taking  
aim at NATO credibility and American leadership of the alliance,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	He said Milosevic apparently wastrying to do the same thing  
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein had accomplished with the 
international monitors in his country: ``neuter them or kick them 
out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He has calculated that only decisive leadership by the  
president of the United States will be able to mobilize the NATO 
allies to intervene militarily, and he calculates that with the 
president's focus on his impeachment defense, Clinton will be too 
distracted to exercise leadership required to do that,'' Hooper 
said.

<HEADLINE> CEOs Scale Peaks, Staff Worries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Millionaire entrepreneur Dick Bass doesn't work out in gyms.  
He's climbing the world's highest peaks -- for a second time. No 
leisurely rounds of golf tempt Virgin Atlantic Airway's chairman. 
Richard Branson breaks hot-air ballooning records in his off-hours. 
</P>
<P>
	More and more, business leaders are pushing themselves as hard  
in their spare time as they do at the office, searching for 
thrills, chills and new worlds to conquer. 
</P>
<P>
	``There aren't any regulators or competitors up there telling me  
'no','' explains Bass, a Dallas financier who founded the popular 
Utah ski resort Snowbird. ``It's a great sense of freedom.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But adventures can go wrong. Disney's No. 2 executive Frank  
Wells died helicopter skiing in 1994, setting off a power struggle 
at the company. Only weeks ago, software mastermind Larry Ellison 
emerged shaken from a stormy Australian yachting race in which six 
fellow sailors died. 
</P>
<P>
	Such accidents raise the question: Are chief executive officers  
risking too much in pursuit of adventure? Not only do company 
insurance premiums burgeon and workers worry when the boss is at 
play, but the future of the company may be at stake. 
</P>
<P>
	``To have a solid succession plan in place -- that will  
definitely be on my agenda when I get back to work,'' says Nick 
Williams, a CEO who suffered severe frostbite last month after 
spending three days alone on a blizzard-swept California mountain. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams, who heads Premisys Communications, a  
telecommunications company, says his ordeal began when he 
accidentally strayed from a demanding ski slope trail during an 
unexpected storm. Although he pushes himself hard in off-hours 
sports to relieve stress, he says, ``I don't take risks with my 
life.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, his chief financial officer says -- with great respect for  
his boss -- that the independent streak of good leaders can be a 
mixed blessing. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're a little more accustomed to going it alone,'' says  
John Hagedorn. ``There's some relationship to that and the fact 
that he would consider skiing alone at a resort he'd never been to 
before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In an age when tourists go miles down in the ocean to gawk at  
the sunken Titanic or fly Russian fighter jets for fun, it's 
natural that CEOs who have the money and mindset can do almost 
anything. 
</P>
<P>
	Alistair Ballantine, president of the luxury travel company  
Abercrombie &AMP; Kent, recalls that at least half a dozen CEOs flew to 
Africa last year on private jets to climb 19,340-foot Mount 
Kilimanjaro with A&AMP;K guides. Others went whitewater rafting in New 
Zealand or gorilla tracking in Uganda. 
</P>
<P>
	Compared to previous generations, executives don't even have to  
take much time off to go far. ``I used to leave on my vacations and 
within two days be in a remote area of Borneo,'' says Robert Young 
Pelton, author of ``The World's Most Dangerous Places'' and former 
CEO of his own advertising firm. ``For me, that's relaxation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's not just the accessibility of adventuring that attracts  
CEOs. In today's rapidly shifting business world, more CEOs are 
risk-takers, so they prefer risky hobbies, believes Chrysler's 
retired vice chairman, Robert Lutz, who races motorcycles and flies 
his own Soviet fighter plane. 
</P>
<P>
	``Before, (CEOs) exhibited very little flash, flair and  
charisma, and they all went out in their cashmere sweaters and 
played golf with each other,'' says Lutz, who says that 
motorcycling was forbidden and skiing was discouraged when he 
started his career in the auto industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``Many more people who make it to the top today are bold and  
aggressive leaders,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Yet a CEO's adventures can be costly to companies -- literally.  
Companies whose executives engage in risky sports pay between 45 
percent and 270 percent more for the ``key man'' insurance that 
most large organizations buy on their CEOs, according to New 
York-based H&AMP;R Phillips insurance agency. 
</P>
<P>
	That means a company paying $10,135 annually on $1 million worth  
of insurance on a healthy 50-year-old CEO would pay nearly $17,235 
if the chief likes to hang glide or climb mountains. 
</P>
<P>
	High-profile, high-flying executives who tend to love adventure  
the most are also the hardest to replace, says Jeffrey Christian, 
CEO of a Cleveland-based executive search firm. ``They carry a 
public image that's almost impossible to replace,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian has firsthand experience with the issue: He fell 30  
feet while rock climbing on vacation, luckily suffering only cuts 
and a broken tooth. ``My partners were probably worrying,'' he says 
dryly. 
</P>
<P>
	Branson, too, has close calls. In December, he and two other  
adventurers ditched their balloon into the Pacific Ocean, 
abandoning a fourth effort to float around the world nonstop. 
``We're glad to be alive,'' Branson said after their rescue. 
</P>
<P>
	A week later, during a vacation taken to recover from the  
ballooning trip, Branson broke a rib and cracked another when his 
sailboat capsized in strong winds off the British Virgin Islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Before expeditions, Branson does take precautions. He updates  
succession and contingency plans, and checks the key man insurance 
taken on his new ventures. ``I don't want to lose what's 
achieved,'' he says in a telephone interview from his country house 
in Kidlington, England. 
</P>
<P>
	That doesn't keep his colleagues from worrying. Virgin  
Atlantic's board has tried to discourage Branson from further 
exploits -- in vain, says David Tait, a board member and executive 
director at the airline. ``The more you complain about it, the more 
you set his will to do it,'' sighs Tait.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Defense Six Years Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration said Wednesday it  
probably will take two years longer than previously believed to 
build a defense against a long-range missile attack on the United 
States. But, it added, the need for such a defense system is 
greater than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration moved its target date for deploying a  
national missile defense from 2003 to 2005, Defense Secretary 
William Cohen told a Pentagon news conference. The cost of building 
the system is estimated to reach $10.5 billion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said President Clinton's proposed 2000 budget, to be  
submitted to Congress on Feb. 1, will include an extra $6.6 billion 
for missile defense work through the year 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on whether to actually deploy a national missile  
defense will be made in June 2000, Cohen said. The decision will 
depend on two things: the level of threat of a missile attack and 
the Defense Department's technical readiness to build such a 
defense, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are affirming that there is a threat, and the threat is  
growing, and that it will pose a danger not only to our troops 
overseas but also to Americans here at home,'' Cohen said. He said 
the main worry was of a limited missile attack from a hostile 
nation such as North Korea or Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen noted that North Korea, which remains in a state of war  
with U.S.-backed South Korea, shocked the world last August by 
test-firing a medium-range ballistic missile over Japan. The 
missile, called the Taepo-dong 1, showed a surprising level of 
technical advancement. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there is no indication that the missile could reach  
U.S. territory, the North Koreans are believed to be working on one 
capable of reaching Hawaii or Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Taepo-dong 1 test was another strong indicator that the  
United States will, in fact, face a rogue nation missile threat to 
our homeland, against which we will have to defend the American 
people,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the revised timetable provides a more realistic  
chance of building a successful missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the reality of the threat, we cannot afford to fail,''  
the defense secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two decades the United States has spent tens of  
billions of dollars on missile defense, yet no working system is in 
place. Until recently, the Clinton administration said it was too 
early to judge whether the threat of attack was high enough to 
justify deploying one. The Russians have strongly opposed a U.S. 
national missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty between the United States  
and the former Soviet Union prohibits deployment of the kind of 
missile defense system Cohen described. He said U.S. officials will 
talk to the Russians about amending the ABM treaty, but that if the 
Russians refuse, the United States will abandon the treaty and 
build the anti-missile system anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen stressed that the administration prefers to keep an  
amended ABM treaty in force as a means of discouraging the 
development of offensive missiles by other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The missile defense system Cohen described would include a  
sensor based in space that would detect the plume of a ballistic 
missile at liftoff, providing early warning of an attack. 
Ground-based radars in the United States would calculate the 
missile's trajectory and guide a ground-launched interceptor rocket 
to destroy the missile outside the earth's atmosphere. The 
interceptor rockets might be based in Alaska or North Dakota, Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Cohen announced changes in the administration's  
approach to defenses against shorter-range missiles, such as the 
Scud missiles Iraq launched during the 1991 Gulf War or those which 
North Korea could fire at U.S. and allied troops in South Korea or 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Army's Theater High-Altitude Area Defense system, or  
THAAD, will resume flight tests even though it has failed five 
consecutive times to hit its test target, most recently last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Late next year, he said, the Pentagon will decide whether THAAD  
or a sea-based system the Navy has been working on should be given 
the lead priority. In either case, the goal is to have one of the 
two systems ready for use by 2007, Cohen said.

<HEADLINE>  Bill Walsh Returns to 49ers As GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- Trying to recharge a front office  
left in disarray by the departures of its top people, the San 
Francisco 49ers reached into their past for stability and direction 
Wednesday by hiring Bill Walsh as general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh, the Hall of Fame coach who laid the groundwork for the  
49ers' long-running success, signed a four-year contract. Terms 
weren't disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	It is his third tour with the club. He coached the 49ers to  
three Super Bowl victories in the 1980s and had an uncomfortable 
year-long stint under George Seifert as a consultant in 1996 in 
which his suggestions were routinely ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't return to the San Francisco 49ers in a  
subordinate role, and I think that's understandable,'' Walsh said. 
``Not that I haven't worked well with others or for others. I did 
that for George Seifert for one year. But the role has changed, 
where I can really, truly express my beliefs and implement those 
beliefs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	During a wide-ranging news conference, the 67-year-old Walsh  
alternately portrayed himself as a mentor for the team's young 
executives and coaches, a personnel guru and iron-fisted 
decision-maker in the mold of Russian President Boris Yeltsin. 
</P>
<P>
	``I still believe I can be a value to the organization,'' Walsh  
said. ``I certainly have the health and energy -- of course you've 
heard Boris say the same thing -- to sustain my efforts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the 49ers facing a salary cap crunch -- they're a projected  
$24 million over next season's limit -- Walsh said he and his staff 
face major challenges in holding the roster together. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be easy but you have a choice of pyramiding  
or mortgaging into the future further or trying to deal with it 
directly,'' Walsh said. ``We can't do it cold turkey but we 
certainly have to be looking closely at where we are with our squad 
and the cap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He took pains to say he was there to complement the efforts of  
coach Steve Mariucci, signed to a new five-year contract last week, 
and praised him as one of the finest coaches in the league. San 
Francisco went 12-4 this season and beat Green Bay in a wild card 
playoff before losing to Atlanta in the divisional round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly not going to interfere with Steve, other than a  
play or two I might try to call during a game,'' Walsh said, 
laughing. 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Walsh in the front office will be Terry Donahue, 54. The  
former UCLA coach and broadcaster, Donahue was hired as the team's 
player personnel director. Walsh said Donahue also will be groomed 
to eventually succeed him as general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a brilliant executive, a great coach and a dynamic  
person,'' Walsh said. ``He's a super addition to this 
organization.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team also hopes to hire former 49ers receiver Gene  
Washington as an executive vice president, which would make him one 
of the highest ranking blacks in a front office role. Washington, 
52, currently is the NFL's director of football development. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's arrival in the San Francisco front office probably  
wouldn't be completed until the 49ers' muddled ownership picture is 
resolved. 
</P>
<P>
	Eddie DeBartolo is awaiting NFL clearance to resume active  
ownership of the team. He ceded day-to-day control to his sister, 
co-owner Denise DeBartolo York, in December 1997 when he was 
targeted in a Louisiana gambling fraud probe. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo pleaded guilty last October to failing to report a  
felony crime and was placed on probation and fined $2 million. He 
also must testify against former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards, who 
allegedly received $400,000 from DeBartolo as part of an 
influence-peddling scheme involving issuance of riverboat casino 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL is expected to decide by this spring whether to allow  
DeBartolo to regain control of the team. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh's return puts the 49ers' front office back on a stable  
course after a series of departures that began in July when Carmen 
Policy quit as team president because of a falling-out with 
DeBartolo. Policy joined Al Lerner's successful bid for the 
Cleveland expansion franchise and is now a minority owner and 
president of the Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	Dwight Clark resigned as San Francisco's general manager in late  
November to join Policy in assembling the Browns. Larry Thrailkill, 
who succeeded Policy on an interim basis, quit this month and Vinny 
Cerrato was fired last week as director of player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	John McVay, who came out of retirement to become acting general  
manager and added acting president in the aftermath of Thrailkill's 
departure, is expected to remain with the club through next season 
to help Walsh run the team.

	Clinton Takes Message on the Road  
</P>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton is leaving behind a  
chilly political clime in Washington, taking his State of the Union 
proposals for education, Social Security and other initiatives to 
the public today. Clinton set off today to appeal to Americans for 
support at a pair of campaign-style appearances open to the public 
in Buffalo, N.Y., and suburban Philadelphia. Today's travels were 
in keeping with Clinton's efforts to focus on the nation's business 
and underscored his intention to pursue what aides called an 
``activist agenda'' midway through his second term in office. 

</P>
<P>
	Greenspan Faults Social Security Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today  
criticized a key part of President Clinton's Social Security rescue 
plan. He says the government could damage the economy by investing 
huge sums of money in the stock market. Greenspan said he had 
serious objections to a a provision allowing a government board to 
direct about a quarter of those savings into stock market 
investments. It is unlikely that these investments could be 
insulated from political considerations, he said. 

</P>
<P>
	Stocks Advance; Dow Up 93  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Just before 1 p.m. EST, the Dow industrials were  
up 93.72 to 9,448.94. NYSE advancers led decliners 1,608-1,201. The 
Nasdaq was up 59.97 to 2,468.14. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Poll Ratings Are Strong  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Almost four out of five Americans who watched  
President Clinton's State of the Union address approved of most the 
proposals he made. They also agreed with his decision not to 
mention his impeachment trial. Polls released today by ABC, CBS and 
NBC showed the public's approval of his job performance near his 
all-time highs at the same time the Senate is hearing evidence on 
whether he should be removed from office. 

</P>
<P>
	Bush Worried About White House Bid  
</P>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his wife,  
Laura, said today they are worried that a White House bid would be 
``a major life change.'' A day after being sworn in for a second 
four-year term, the potential Republican presidential candidate 
also said he has done nothing in his personal life that would hurt 
him in a national campaign. 

</P>
<P>
	Tobacco States, Cigarette Cos. Talk  
</P>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Representatives from tobacco states and  
cigarette companies are meeting again to discuss proposed payments 
to tobacco growers hurt financially by a $206 billion settlement of 
tobacco-related health care costs. But this time the cigarette 
makers, who believed they had settled many of their legal problems, 
are working under the threat of a federal lawsuit over health care 
costs. 

</P>

	Magazine Says Pol Pot Killed Self  
</P>
<P>
	PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) -- Khmer Rouge leader Pol Pot committed  
suicide last year after learning that his comrades had offered to 
hand him over to the United States for trial, a Hong Kong-based 
magazine reported. The Far Eastern Economic Review, in a press 
release preceding its latest edition, said Washington turned down 
the chance to take Pol Pot into custody because it was unprepared 
to arrest and try him. The magazine has broken several stories on 
the disintegration of the Khmer Rouge.

the Adriatic Sea today but despite the growing threat of 
airstrikes, Serb police launched another assault in Kosovo. 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic showed no sign he is willing 
to put a stop to the fighting between Serb forces and ethnic 
Albanians in the separatist province.

</P>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Gary Barnett, wooed by many schools since  
leading Northwestern to the 1996 Rose Bowl, resigned as coach of 
the Wildcats amid reports he has accepted an offer to coach 
Colorado. Northwestern said today Barnett resigned last night after 
seven seasons with the team. The Wildcats will announce their new 
coach today at a 4:30 p.m. EST news conference.

<HEADLINE> Lockout Settlement Delayed Again </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With opening night less than 2 1/2 weeks away, the  
NBA lockout settlement still hasn't been finalized. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the lawyers are finished, who knows? Maybe Dennis  
Rodman will be unretired and Antonio McDyess will finally have made 
up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	The laborious task of reducing the lockout settlement into  
written form continued to drag along, and for the third straight 
day Tuesday, the league office sent out a memo telling all teams 
they'll have to wait another day. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the rumors kept coming and the plots kept  
twisting as teams maneuvered to get ready for the scheduled Feb. 5 
start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll get done. It always gets done,'' agent David Falk said.  
``This just gives us more time to talk to people and refine our 
numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman added a strange subplot to the day's events as his agent,  
Dwight Manley, announced that Rodman was retiring. Hours later, the 
league's leading rebounder for the past seven seasons said he was 
more in a state of ``limbo'' than retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Strickland, meanwhile, was reportedly miffed at the offer  
being made by the Washington Wizards. Falk refused to comment on 
the status of Strickland's negotiations, but talk around the league 
was that the point guard was considering signing with another team. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess put off until today a decision on where he'll play --  
Denver or Phoenix, and several signs seemed to be pointing to the 
Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tom Gugliotta rumors were strong, too, with the Nuggets,  
Suns and Lakers all interested. A source close to the Lakers said 
Los Angeles was offering Elden Campbell, Eddie Jones and rookie Sam 
Jacobsen to the Timberwolves in a sign-and-trade deal for 
Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	``It defies logic, in my opinion,'' Suns owner Jerry Colangelo  
said of the deliberations concerning McDyess. ``We think this is a 
great spot for him. He seemed very happy here. We love him as a 
young guy and a future star in this league. But a lot of things 
have happened this offseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets also were wondering whether they would be spurned by  
Gugliotta in the event that McDyess stays in Phoenix. If so, they 
were expected to look to sign free-agent center Vlade Divac. 
</P>
<P>
	No event symbolized the day's craziness like the ``retirement''  
of Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to play this year,'' Rodman told Fox Sports  
News. ``I am in limbo, but I'm not going to say I'm retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not how his former coach heard it. In a strange twist  
earlier in the day, Chuck Daly of the Orlando Magic said he heard 
Rodman was traded to the New York Knicks for Buck Williams -- a 
rumor that was quickly shot down. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, it was learned that John Starks and Chris Mills  
are the players who will be traded from the Knicks to the Golden 
State Warriors for Latrell Sprewell. Word of the Sprewell trade got 
out Monday night, just a few hours after another major trade was 
revealed -- Scottie Pippen going from the Chicago Bulls to the 
Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls also have sign-and-trade deals worked out for Luc  
Longley and Steve Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo confirmed that the Suns will trade three of the five  
players they have under contract -- Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and 
Bubba Wells -- for Longley. 
</P>
<P>
	In another agreed-upon deal, the Seattle SuperSonics were set to  
send center Jim McIlvaine to the New Jersey Nets for veteran 
forwards Michael Cage and Don MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Jazz were expected to sign Nuggets free-agent forward  
Johnny Newman, who would take the place of free agent Chris Morris. 
The Jazz also went looking for another big man after learning that 
Greg Foster fractured an ankle. Utah was believed to have spoken to 
Chicago about a sign-and-trade deal involving Bill Wennington, 
although no trade agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Heat and Golden State Warriors, who couldn't agree on  
a Sprewell deal, nonetheless continued to discuss several 
multiplayer deals. Heat coach Pat Riley was thought to have 
interest in reuniting with Starks, and a deal was being discussed 
that would sent Brent Barry, Terry Mills and Duane Causwell to the 
Warriors for Clarence Weatherspoon, Tony Delk and Felton Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports of a possible Starks-Barry deal, but it would  
not work salary-cap wise under the league's complicated trade 
rules.

<HEADLINE> WTO Remains Split on New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- With a deadline approaching, members of the World  
Trade Organization on Wednesday remained divided over a new leader. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the four candidates vying for the top post commands  
support from a majority of the 133 nations belonging to the trade 
organization. The United States and the 15-nation European Union 
have yet to back a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision on a successor to Renato Ruggiero was to have been  
made by the end of December, but the nations extended the search by 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading candidate so far is Thai Deputy Prime Minister  
Supachai Panitchpakdi, who has the backing of 40 delegations, 
followed by Moroccan trade ambassador Hassan Abouyoub with 23. 
Former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore has the support of 15 
delegations, while former Canadian Trade Minister Roy Maclaren has 
13. 
</P>
<P>
	The post of director-general is regarded as key, as the  
liberalized trade system championed by the WTO faces growing 
pressure due to global economic turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Pluto May Lose Planet Designation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBUQUERQUE, N.M. (AP) -- Poor Pluto -- its days as one of our  
solar system's nine major planets may be numbered. 
</P>
<P>
	Two groups within the International Astronomical Union are  
thinking about reclassifying the relatively puny planet, either 
calling it a ``minor planet'' or lumping it in with an entirely new 
class of objects. 
</P>
<P>
	``For at least 20 years, it's been obvious that Pluto doesn't  
fit,'' said University of Maryland astronomer Mike A'Hearn, who 
heads the Planetary Systems Sciences Division of the International 
Astronomical Union. 
</P>
<P>
	With a diameter of only 1,440 miles, Pluto, the planet farthest  
from the sun, is smaller than Earth's moon. And while other ``major 
planets'' have roughly circular orbits, Pluto carves out a sweeping 
ellipse that frequently takes it closer than Neptune, planet No. 8, 
to the sun. 
</P>
<P>
	A'Hearn wants to create a new class of objects for ice balls  
that orbit beyond Neptune and call them Trans-Neptunian Objects. 
Pluto would be Trans-Neptunian Object No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Brian Marsden of the union's Minor Planet Center said he has a  
better idea. He'd like to see Pluto classified as a ``minor 
planet,'' of which there are thousands, then make it take a number. 
The prized number 10,000 will probably come up next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not a demotion,'' for Pluto to be referred to as the  
10,000th minor planet, Marsden insisted. ``It's an honor.'' 
</P>
<P>
	New Mexico astronomer Alan Hale, co-discoverer of Comet  
Hale-Bopp, suggested the debate is somewhat silly since there's 
really no clear definition of what a planet is. And, besides, ``a 
hypothetical resident of Jupiter would probably laugh at our 
calling Earth a `major planet.'''

<P>
	``We believe, short of a declaration of war, there is nothing  
more serious for our elected representatives to contemplate than 
through the process of impeachment to undo the result of a national 
election and to remove the man chosen by the American people to be 
their president.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Can anyone imagine anything more damaging to the Constitution  
of the United States than for a presidential election to be 
reversed for conduct that the vast majority of the American people 
does not believe warrants the president's removal from office?'' -- 
Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I appeal to you, do not turn your back on those millions of  
Americans who cast their votes in the belief that they and they 
alone decide who will lead this country as president. Do not throw 
our politics into the darkness of endless recrimination. Do not 
inject a poison of bitter partisanship into the body politic, which 
like a virus can move through our national bloodstream for years to 
come, with results none can know or calculate. 
</P>
<P>
	``Do not let this case and these charges, as flawed and as  
unfair as they are, destroy a fundamental underpinning of American 
democracy: the right of the people and no one else to select the 
president of the United States.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``As a lawyer, as an American, and as an African-American, it is  
a principle in which I believe to the very core of my being. It is 
what many have struggled and died for, the right to be equal before 
the law, without regard to race or gender or ethnicity, disability, 
privilege, or station in life. The rule of law applies to the weak 
and the strong, the rich and the poor, the powerful and the 
powerless. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you love the rule of law, you must love it in all of its  
applications. 
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot only love it when it provides the verdict you seek,  
you must love it when the verdict goes against you as well. We 
cannot uphold the rule of law only when it is consistent with our 
beliefs, we must uphold it even when it protects behavior that we 
don't like or is unattractive or is not admirable or that might 
even be hurtful.'' -- Cheryl Mills, White House deputy counsel.

</P>
<P>
	``His conduct, while clearly not attractive or admirable, is not  
criminal.'' -- Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``So what is the big picture? The big picture is this: The  
president had a relationship with a young woman. His conduct was 
inappropriate, but it was not obstruction of justice. During the 
course of their relationship, the president and the young woman 
pledged not to talk about it with others. That is not obstruction 
of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president ended their relationship before anyone knew  
about it. He ended it not because he thought it would place him in 
legal jeopardy. He ended it because he knew it was wrong. That is 
not obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president hoped that no one would find out about his  
indiscretion, about his lapse in judgment. That is not obstruction 
of justice either.'' -- Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``For conviction, each and every element must be proven beyond a  
reasonable doubt. If the prosecution fails to prove even one 
element, a jury is obliged to acquit. In this case, none of the 
elements are present.'' -- Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's intent was never to obstruct justice in the  
Jones case, it was to manage a looming media firestorm, which he 
correctly foresaw.'' -- Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	``The house of civil rights is strong because its foundation is  
strong. And with all due respect, the foundation of the house of 
civil rights was never at the core of the Jones case. It was never 
at the heart of the Jones case. The foundation of the house of 
civil rights is in the voices of all the great civil rights leaders 
and the soul of every person who heard them.'' -- Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I stand here before you today because America decided that the  
way things were was not how they're going to be. We the people 
decided that we all deserved a better deal. I stand here before you 
today because President Bill Clinton believed I could stand here 
for him.'' -- Mills. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Your decision whether to remove President Clinton from office  
based on the articles of impeachment, I know, will be based on the 
law and the facts and the Constitution. It would be wrong to 
convict him on this record. You should acquit him on this record. 
And you must not let imagined harms to the house of civil rights

<HEADLINE> Clinton Tobacco Remarks Questioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- Jurors in the first class-action lawsuit by smokers  
to reach trial could have been tainted by President Clinton's 
remarks about a tobacco suit during the State of the Union address, 
industry attorneys contend. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney Robert Heim, who represents Philip Morris Inc., said an  
estimated 60 million viewers watched Clinton say on television that 
the federal government will sue cigarette makers to recover 
smoking-related costs spend through Medicare and other federal 
programs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a substantial concern about the jury,'' Heim said  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Circuit Judge Robert Kaye questioned four jurors who  
said they'd either heard Clinton's speech or heard about it and all 
said it would not influence their judgment. 
</P>
<P>
	Kaye said he was satisfied that no court rules were broken.  
</P>
<P>
	The Justice Department action follows the lead of the states,  
which settled similar lawsuits for a total of $246 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Stanley Rosenblatt, attorney for the nine plaintiffs  
representing an estimated half-million sick Floridians who blame 
smoking for their illnesses, said there was nothing new in the 
president's words. 
</P>
<P>
	The sick smokers claim tobacco makers conspired to mislead them  
about the dangers of smoking and worked to keep smokers hooked. 
They are seeking at least $200 billion in damages.

<HEADLINE> Falcons Ride Andersen to Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Morten Andersen usually went to the Super  
Bowl as a television analyst for his native Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, they'll have to find someone else.  
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Andersen, long regarded as one of the NFL's  
dominant kickers, will finally be on the field for a Super Bowl 
rather than behind the microphone when his Atlanta Falcons meet the 
Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the two choices,'' he said Wednesday after the Falcons  
held their first practice for the Jan. 31 game in Miami, ``I'm real 
glad where I'm at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took 17 long seasons -- the first 13 with the New Orleans  
Saints, the last four in Atlanta -- before his dream came into 
focus, standing 38 yards away between two tall, yellow posts at the 
Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got my target,'' Andersen said Wednesday, recalling his  
game-winning kick in the 30-27 overtime victory over Minnesota in 
the NFC championship game. ``I looked through to see all the arms 
waving (in the crowd), but there were no distractions. I was very 
single-minded of purpose, really. I felt very comfortable. It was 
surprising, really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, not that surprising. Andersen has been making those type  
of kicks throughout his career, 26 in all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people love the pressure,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves  
said. ``It's like Michael Jordan wants the basketball when a lot of 
people want to pass it. It's like John Elway wants the football 
with two minutes to go and the game on the line. He's better in 
that situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Morten is that way, too.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tight end O.J. Santiago, who caught a crucial pass on the  
winning drive in overtime, figured the game was over as soon as the 
Falcons crossed midfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew Morten was automatic,'' Santiago said. ``I went over to  
the sideline and some of the guys were grabbing hands and wanted to 
grab my hand. I looked at them and said, `Hey, I've not held hands 
on one field goal all year. I've not been on my knees (in prayer) 
for one field goal all year. This is just another field goal for 
Mort. It's automatic.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen holds the NFL record with 35 field goals of at least 50  
yards in his career, but the conversation focuses on his steadfast 
mental outlook rather than his strong left leg when he's discussing 
the finer points of kicking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if you guys believe this, but visualization -- if  
you do it enough -- is a very powerful thing,'' he told a group of 
reporters. ``Your mind is so powerful, it tells the body what to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've trained for many years now. My mind is pretty well  
trained to do what I want it to do. That's what I rehearse. That's 
what I take pride in. That's a big part of my routine. My dominant 
response came to the forefront when I needed it, and that was a 
positive response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen can sympathize with his Minnesota counterpart, Gary  
Anderson, who had not missed a kick all season until a 38-yarder 
late in the fourth quarter slid just outside the left upright. 
</P>
<P>
	That provided Atlanta with an opening. The Falcons scored the  
tying touchdown with less than a minute to go in regulation, then 
Andersen won it almost 12 minutes into the extra period. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how he must feel,'' the Atlanta kicker said. ``I think  
it's important that everybody who watched that game, watched this 
year, to not put all the blame in his lap. That's really not fair. 
He had a tremendous year, and no one should take that away from 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen kept hoping he would one day play in a Super Bowl,  
though his chances seemed more and more remote with each passing 
year. Until this season, he had never been on the winning side in a 
playoff game, much less gotten a chance to play for the NFL title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would always say at the end of the year, `Man, another year  
and we didn't do it,''' Andersen said. ``But I kept the faith. I 
just felt that patience and faith was going to pay off. That's what 
I kept saying. The prize was still hanging there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's got a chance to grab it.

<HEADLINE> NCAA Wants Shield From Bias Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The NCAA, accused of discriminating against  
female athletes in the way it enforces eligibility rules, asked the 
Supreme Court today to shield it from lawsuits based on a federal 
law banning sexual bias in educational programs receiving federal 
financial aid. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is not enough just to trace the money,'' argued the  
organization's lawyer, John Roberts Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	A focal point of the three-year legal battle is whether the  
powerful college body can be considered an indirect recipient of 
federal aid because of the dues it collects from its 1,200 member 
schools -- virtually all federally subsidized. 
</P>
<P>
	If so, it could be subject to the anti-bias law known as Title  
IX of the Education Amendments of 1972. 
</P>
<P>
	If Title IX applies to the NCAA, the organization will have to  
defend itself against Renee Smith's accusations that she illegally 
was declared ineligible years ago for intercollegiate volleyball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to establish a precedent, so other intercollegiate  
athletes don't have to start at zero,'' Smith said outside the 
court building. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Carter Phillips, asked the justices to send the case  
back to a lower court and allow Smith to pursue her discrimination 
complaint. 
</P>
<P>
	Arguing that the NCAA should be considered an indirect recipient  
of federal aid and therefore covered by the federal law, Phillips 
said, ``You can't stop at the federal funds recipient'' such as a 
university. ``You have to go beyond that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts argued that the NCAA is not an aid recipient under the  
law, and that athletes should take up discrimination complaints 
with the individual schools. 
</P>
<P>
	``How do you pin this on the university?'' Justice Antonin  
Scalia asked. An individual school, after all, is just following 
the NCAA rules, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It hasn't done anything except deny a waiver under  
circumstances that are perfectly reasonable,'' Scalia said. 
</P>
<P>
	The justices are expected to make a decision by late June.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith has some firepower on her side. The Clinton administration  
is urging the court to rule for her and keep her 1996 lawsuit 
alive. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith, who lives in Wintersville, Ohio, played volleyball for  
St. Bonaventure during the 1991-92 and 1992-93 seasons. She chose 
not to participate the following season, and graduated in less than 
three years. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith later pursued a graduate degree at Hofstra University and  
a law degree at the University of Pittsburgh. At each, her attempts 
to play two more seasons of volleyball were thwarted by an NCAA 
rule that bars graduate students from competing at a school other 
than the one from which they earned undergraduate degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith's lawsuit says the NCAA grants male student-athletes a  
disproportionate number of waivers from that eligibility rule. But 
the NCAA, noting that many more men apply for such waivers, says a 
higher percentage of female applicants are granted them. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge threw out Smith's lawsuit, but the 3rd U.S.  
Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated her Title IX claim last year. 
``The NCAA is not merely an incidental beneficiary of federal 
funds,'' the appeals court ruled. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith is now a lawyer, licensed to practice in California and  
about to take the Ohio bar examination in February. She works for 
her father's mining and industrial supply company, and last fall 
was an assistant volleyball coach at Weir High School in Weirton, 
W.Va.

<HEADLINE> Fiber Doesn't Reduce Colon Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A large new study has found no evidence that eating lots of  
high-fiber foods like bran, beans and whole wheat bread helps lower 
the risk of colon cancer, a surprising conclusion that contradicts 
years of dietary advice. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in today's New England Journal of Medicine,  
tracked the colon and rectal health of 88,757 women who 
participated in the Harvard-based Nurses Health Study over 16 
years. It is one of the biggest cancer studies of its kind ever. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1980 to 1996, 787 of the women developed cancer of the  
colon or the rectum. The risk was the same, regardless of how much 
fiber they ate. The researchers said they believe the findings 
apply to men as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Charles S. Fuchs and his colleagues at the Dana-Farber  
Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical 
School said they were astounded to find that women who ate 
low-fiber foods were no more likely to develop colon cancer than 
those who stuck to bran muffins and broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a practicing physician and as a researcher, this is a  
hypothesis that has stood the test of time,'' Fuchs said. ``There 
has been such an abundant enthusiasm for this hypothesis, so the 
important message here is that fiber, overall, has no protective 
effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, previous studies have found that a diet rich in fruits,  
vegetables and whole grains has other health benefits, including 
reducing the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure and certain 
types of diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	And Fuchs said the benefits of fiber in protecting against other  
problems like high blood pressure and heart disease -- the No. 1 
killer in the country -- are undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people are taking fiber for any of those reasons, then keep  
doing it. If the primary concern is to prevent colon cancer, then I 
wouldn't try fiber. I'm not sure that's going to work,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study participants were healthy women, 34 to 59, who had no  
history of cancer. They filled out dietary questionnaires in 1980, 
1984 and 1986, and researchers followed up with the women until 
mid-1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael Thun, who heads epidemiological research for the  
American Cancer Society, said he was surprised by the findings but 
doubts his organization will change its nutritional guidelines 
because people who eat more fruits and vegetables generally suffer 
fewer cases of cancer of the mouth, throat, larynx, esophagus, 
stomach, and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should base their behavior on all of the evidence  
rather than on one study,'' Thun said. ``One shouldn't either 
zigzag erratically with each new study or lapse into cynicism. The 
fact is that the main components of a healthy lifestyle have been 
clear and steady for some years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed that there may be other properties of vegetables,  
including the vitamin folate, that could lower the risk of cancer 
and that people who eat more fruits, vegetables and whole grains 
also tend to be less obese and suffer fewer health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. John Potter of the Fred  
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle wondered whether 
questionnaires about a person's past eating habits can be accurate 
and if nurses, who are generally more health-conscious than other 
people, are a representative sample. 
</P>
<P>
	Potter said there is evidence to suggest that high sugar and  
calorie consumption and a lack of exercise may be to blame for 
colon cancer, but more research is necessary. ``We have barely 
begun,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> AT&AMP;T Buys Phone-Card Company </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DUBLIN, Ohio (AP) -- AT&AMP;T is buying SmarTalk Tele-Services Inc.,  
a prepaid phone-card company, for $192.5 million in cash, giving 
the telecommunications giant an entry into the phone-card market. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement on Tuesday came as SmarTalk, based in Dublin,  
Ohio, sought protection under federal bankruptcy laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal, which needs bankruptcy court and regulatory approval,  
includes $10 million to keep the company operating until the sale 
is closed, probably in late March, AT&AMP;T spokeswoman Eileen Connolly 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	SmarTalk and 19 affiliates filed for Chapter 11 protection in  
U.S. Bankruptcy Court in Wilmington, Del., on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	SmarTalk sells the cards in increments of 15 to 300 minutes  
through 100,000 retail outlets and the U.S. Postal Service. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of SmarTalk have been halted since Tuesday. The Nasdaq  
Stock Market has asked the company for more information on the 
press release it issued on the AT&AMP;T deal, but a Nasdaq spokesman 
would not disclose details of the request.

<HEADLINE> Former Senator To Defend Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just-retired Sen. Dale Bumpers, who built a  
reputation as a keen orator during his 24 years in the Senate, is 
closing the defense arguments on behalf of his friend and fellow 
Arkansan, Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending Clinton on constitutional grounds, Bumpers is arguing  
that the House impeachment charges of perjury and obstruction 
amount to a ``partisan rush to judgment'' that does not meet with 
the ``higher duty the Senate has always had,'' an adviser to the 
White House said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	An alumnus of the exclusive Senate club, Bumpers brings to the  
closing arguments today the credibility and substance that ``only 
one senator can have talking to another senator,'' said this 
adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers has expressed his dismay at Clinton's conduct and is  
likely to focus on constitutional issues and the institutional 
duties that bind senators, said a second White House official close 
to the legal team. 
</P>
<P>
	The former senator was keeping mum Wednesday about what he  
planned to say. His recent statements, though, provide a preview of 
his likely line of attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In a farewell speech to the Senate last fall, Bumpers likened  
the investigation of Clinton to one of the most unjust government 
probes in history. ``You'd have to go back to the Salem witchcraft 
trials to find anything comparable,'' he said then. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers, 73, is, like Clinton, a former governor of Arkansas,  
and goes way back with the president. ``He knows Bill Clinton from 
the word go,'' said Ralph Shelby, sergeant-at-arms of the Arkansas 
State Senate and Bumpers' childhood friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sort of wish I was over there to help out,'' Bumpers said in  
an interview with The Associated Press earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House this week granted that wish. Bumpers was present  
at the defense table in the well of the Senate when Clinton's 
lawyers opened their case Tuesday, and the White House announced 
that the famously blunt-spoken orator would close the president's 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Republicans praised Clinton's choice.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the White House couldn't have picked anyone better  
from an oratory standpoint,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., one 
of the House prosecutors. ``Will he have an impact? Sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, called Bumpers ``one of the great  
orators of our time'' but added he was ``usually not persuaded by 
the things he said on the Senate floor. But we'll see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas Democrats say Bumpers still feels the same way about  
Clinton as he did when he gave his farewell speech to the Senate, 
but has softened his rhetoric in speeches around the state and cast 
the issue more in constitutional terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that he likes to say when he talks about  
this is that Republicans in Congress have often treated the Bill of 
Rights like a rough draft,'' said Glen Hooks, executive director of 
the state Democratic party. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would see this as the same type of situation where the  
Republicans don't have the same type of reverence to the 
Constitution that they should have -- and that Dale Bumpers does 
have.''

<HEADLINE> Questions, Answers About 'Portals' </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Companies like Excite, Yahoo! and Netscape are  
among the hottest properties on the Internet all because they 
operate Web sites known simply as ``portals.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Portals are the launching pad for surfers of the World Wide Web  
to begin their online journeys, a place for them to go when they 
want other things. 
</P>
<P>
	So why are they worth billions of dollars? Some questions and  
answers. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: Where did portals come from?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Portals grew out of the Web concept called a ``search  
engine,'' which is a service that allows a user to find Web sites 
simply by typing in the topic. These rapidly became the most 
popular sites as the Internet grew. Now, they've been vastly 
expanded and provide a wealth of online services such as free 
e-mail, news, chat and personalized functions like stock quotes, 
local weather, sports, even local lottery numbers. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: Why are they so important and valuable?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Web sites get much of their revenue from advertising, but one  
of the biggest problems for advertisers is the short attention span 
of Web surfers, who often jump from place to place rapidly. If 
portals like Excite offer enough services in one place, the theory 
is that the audience will grow and spend enough time on the site to 
convince advertisers to buy more space on the site and potentially 
reach millions of people. Portals that personalize their services 
offer another bonus for advertisers. To personalize Excite, users 
enter their names, Zip code and interests, such as their favorite 
stocks or sports teams. Excite's advertisers can use this data to 
reach only New York Jets fans living in Manhattan, for example. 

</P>
<P>
	Q: What are the big portals?  
</P>
<P>
	A: According to Media Metrix, which tracks Internet usage, the  
top five portals, based on November 1998 measurements, are: 
aol.com, with 27.6 million visitors; Yahoo.com, with 26.7 million; 
MSN.com, Microsoft's portal, with 18.5 million; Geocities.com, a 
provider of home pages to individuals with 18.2 million; and 
Netscape.com, with almost 17 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite.com is next, with 14.2 million unique visitors.  

</P>
<P>
	Q: What makes these portals distinctive?  
</P>
<P>
	A: Each portal offers many of the same standard features, but  
there are some differences, if only of degree. 
</P>
<P>
	Yahoo! offers more services than the others including a search  
engine, stocks, news, weather, ski reports, chats, bulletin boards 
and large selection of links to online shopping. 
</P>
<P>
	Excite.com is lauded for its search technology and its functions  
to personalize news, local weather, horoscopes and sports scores. 
Users can even decide what appears on their Excite page and what 
color it is. 
</P>
<P>
	AOL.com, is a free service offered as a supplement to America  
Online's member-only online service. It allows AOL members to check 
their e-mail and sign up for the AOL Instant Messenger, a program 
that allows Internet users to send real-time private messages to 
anyone on the Net, whether they subscribe to AOL or not. 
</P>
<P>
	Msn.com is primarily a central organizer for all of Microsoft's  
Web properties such as the city guide Sidewalk.com; its travel 
site, Expedia.com; and its news site, MSNBC.com. 
</P>
<P>
	Netscape's portal, Netcenter, does stand out for its focus on  
business users. It offers research, career information, and help 
for small businesses in addition to more standard offerings.

<HEADLINE> Lawsuit Filed Against Nine West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- A federal class-action lawsuit has  
been filed against Nine West Group and several large department 
store chains, claiming they kept prices artificially high for years 
on 12 brands of women's shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	The suit claims that Nine West enforced the price list by  
threatening to cut off supplies to any retailer who didn't toe the 
line. Violations were reported to the company by ``agents'' from 
the stores, who spied on each other. 
</P>
<P>
	``The defendants sold millions of pairs of Nine West footwear,  
at prices inflated by the illegal price-fixing conspiracy,'' 
according to the lawsuit, filed last week in White Plains, where 
Nine West is headquartered. 
</P>
<P>
	Joshua Rubin, lawyer for the plaintiffs, is asking federal Judge  
Barrington Parker to certify the lawsuit as a class action on 
behalf of anyone who bought, or considered buying, Nine West models 
that were on the alleged price-fixing lists between 1988 and the 
present. 
</P>
<P>
	It seeks unspecified damages, plus an injunction against  
price-fixing agreements. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine West is also under investigation by the Federal Trade  
Commission for price-fixing allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	``The law prohibits you from telling a retailer how to market  
his goods. You can't tell a retailer not to lower his price,'' said 
Larry Schulsinger, a partner at the retail consulting firm 
Management Ventures Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	``But manufacturers know that price-cutting hurts the value of  
brand, and they have reasons to want their brand to continue to 
command strong prices.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Calls to Nine West were referred to Chief Financial Officer Bob  
Galvin, who did not return them. 
</P>
<P>
	Nine West, which makes such popular brands as Enzo Angiolini,  
Bandolino, Easy Spirit, Calvin Klein, Westies and Pappagallo, fits 
into a niche between designer shoes and discount shoes with prices 
generally between $50 and $90. 
</P>
<P>
	It claims one-fifth of all the shoes sold to women in America.  
Its shoes are sold primarily in department stores, company-owned 
retail outlets and independent shoe stores. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the suit, Nine West's top management meets at least  
four times a year with high-ranking representatives of the 
retailers that buy their shoes. Minimum prices -- and time periods 
during which the prices will be enforced -- are agreed upon for the 
various brands and models, the suit says. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, it says, ``The department stores and Nine West each  
monitor the retail prices charged ... by sending agents into other 
retailers' stores.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Each department store reports to Nine West whenever it learns  
of any violation,'' the suit says, and then the company enforces 
the restrictions ``by refusing to sell them its footwear products, 
by interfering with their advertising programs and by other 
coercive retaliatory measures.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stores named in the suit include Federated Department Stores  
Inc., which owns Macy's and Bloomingdale's, and May Department 
Stores Co., which owns Lord &AMP; Taylor, Dillard's Inc., Dayton Hudson 
Corp. and Nordstrom Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	Federated has denied involvement in price-fixing. May declined  
comment. Dayton Hudson did not return calls for comment. Officials 
at Dillard's could not be reached. 
</P>
<P>
	Nordstrom spokeswoman Brooke White said that the department  
store will contest the suit and plays ``no part in determining what 
vendors' suggested retail prices are.''

<HEADLINE> Jordan Thrills Hope Classic Crowd  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA QUINTA, Calif. (AP) -- At one point, Michael Jordan laughed so  
hard at pal Charles Barkley's wildly scattered shots that he fell 
to the ground and lay on his back guffawing. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, Jordan rolled in a 35-foot birdie putt to cap his day,  
the gallery roaring its approval. 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously enjoying life after basketball, the relaxed Jordan  
showed Wednesday that he can still hit some shots. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing in a Bob Hope Chrysler Classic group that included  
former NFL wide receiver Roy Green in the trio of amateurs teamed 
with the PGA's Payne Stewart, Jordan hit several long drives down 
the middle, made a few good chips and had one birdie per side. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he imposed a no-interview rule when he agreed to play  
in the tournament, Jordan chatted with fans and reporters during 
his round. 
</P>
<P>
	He and the loquacious Barkley kidded each other, with Stewart  
and Green often joining in, as they made their way around Bermuda 
Dunes Country Club, with an enthusiastic gallery, usually some 
six-deep, trailing them. 
</P>
<P>
	``Man, this is some group, kidding back and forth all day  
long,'' Jordan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Barkley started the round calmly before finally yelling and  
throwing a club when he hit over the green on the fourth hole. He 
hit his approach shot at the ninth hole over the green, over the 
crowd and bouncing toward the clubhouse. Jordan could hardly stop 
laughing after that shot. 
</P>
<P>
	``Charles hit so many bad shots ...'' Jordan said afterward,  
grinning and shaking his head. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Jordan didn't hit many really bad shots, Barkley still  
was able to taunt him. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's a better golfer than I am and a better liar,'' Barkley  
said as the two warmed up on the driving range. ``He says he's a 12 
(handicapper) and I know I'm a lot closer to my handicap than he 
is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan actually was listed with a 10 handicap for the  
tournament, and Barkley with a 14. The team competition is best 
ball, so individual scores weren't kept for the amateurs. 
</P>
<P>
	As far as the professionals were concerned, John Huston, Tom  
Pernice and Ben Bates shared the first-round lead in the 90-hole 
tournament with 9-under-par scores of 63. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Fred Couples opened with a 72 and David  
Duval, a runaway winner of the 1999 tour opener two weeks ago, shot 
a 70 in the first round. 
</P>
<P>
	Dressed completely in black but for his tan Panama hat, Jordan  
on one hole jokingly challenged Barkley and Green to $50 for 
birdies, then turned to the crowd and said, ``Hey, I don't have a 
job.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The fans ate it up.  
</P>
<P>
	``Michael Jordan's still Michael Jordan,'' said Gene Andersen,  
who said he was both a basketball and golf fan. ``He looks just 
about as athletic on the golf course as he did on the basketball 
court. He hits the ball well, although he's a little erratic.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan played like a touring pro at the start, then drove out of  
bounds on the fifth hole. Since he obviously wasn't going to get 
the low score in his group, he strolled up the fairway, unlit cigar 
in his mouth, watching his partners. 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan revealed when he announced his retirement from the  
Chicago Bulls last week that he wouldn't have been able to play 
basketball for awhile, anyway, because he cut a tendon in his right 
index finger with a cigar cutter. 
</P>
<P>
	That also may keep him from playing golf for awhile. He said he  
plans to have surgery on the finger next Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's killing me,'' he said late in his opening round. ``It  
hurts my swing. I have to take this finger off the club on every 
swing and it still hurts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought he was going to be able to finish the  
tournament, which features pro-am competition the first four days 
of the five-day event, Jordan said ``I don't know.''

<HEADLINE> Town's Last Operating Mine Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LEADVILLE, Colo. (AP) -- Leadville's last operating mine will  
shut down at the end of the month, ending the town's 140-year 
history of hauling lead, zinc, gold and silver out of the ground 
high in the Colorado Rockies. 
</P>
<P>
	The closure of Asarco's Black Cloud mine means the loss of 100  
high-paying jobs in this economically depressed town that once 
spawned the fortunes of such famous families as Guggenheim, Dow, 
Boettcher and Tabor. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now all we're left with is... a mining ghost town,'' said  
state Sen. Ken Chlouber, a former miner. ``That should make 
everybody in Colorado a bit sad.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prompted by declining metals prices and an ore vein expected to  
be exhausted by September, the shutdown was not a surprise. Still, 
the news hit hard in this town of 2,600 people 60 miles east of 
Aspen. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is an absolutely crushing blow,'' Leadville Mayor Pete  
Moore said Tuesday. ``Here we are, a mining community, and our 
largest active mine is going to be inactive. I think it's going to 
affect the entire community.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's left people speechless,'' said Esther Mellott, executive  
director of the National Mining Hall of Fame and Museum in 
Leadville. ``Mining is Leadville's heritage.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was in the nearby California Gulch where gold and lead were  
discovered in the 1860s, prompting an epic gold rush and making 
Leadville second only to Denver in importance and size. 
</P>
<P>
	Started in 1969 and operated by Asarco in Iowa Gulch southeast  
of town, the Black Cloud was the largest private employer left in 
Leadville and contributed about $6 million annually to the local 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 1980s, the closure of the Climax Molybdenum Mine left  
thousands of miners without jobs and plunged Leadville into a deep 
economic slump that still lingers.

<HEADLINE> Five Questions With Jane Krakowski </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The face is familiar. Those big eyes. That curly  
blond hair. 
</P>
<P>
	She's Jane Krakowski, who plays Ally McBeal's nosy secretary on  
the hit Fox television show. 
</P>
<P>
	Krakowski describes Elaine Vassal as ``a gold mine of a  
character.'' She credits creator/writer David Kelley with making 
everyone on the show ``full and ever-changing characters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All the characters are complete and flawed,'' she says. ``I  
think that makes them all very interesting -- to play and to 
watch.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Hollywood Foreign Press Association agrees. ``Ally McBeal,''  
Krakowski and co-star Calista Flockhart were nominated this year 
for Golden Globe awards. 
</P>
<P>
	Krakowski, 30, has been with ``Ally McBeal'' since the pilot.  
She was pleased that her character sang at the office Christmas 
parties both seasons and hopes the show will be picked up for a 
third season. A break in shooting allowed her to spend the 
Christmas and New Year's holidays with her parents in Parsippany, 
N.J. 
</P>
<P>
	She was among the performers on a recent ``Great Performances''  
special, ``The Rodgers &AMP; Hart Story: Thou Swell, Thou Witty,'' on 
PBS. She sang ``My Funny Valentine.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a bittersweet song,'' she says. ``I learned it was much  
harder to do than I expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She has a small part in the upcoming movie ``Go,'' to be  
released in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Krakowski, who has appeared in several Broadway shows, became  
interested in performing at a young age. 
</P>
<P>
	``My parents had been involved in community theater in  
Montville, N.J.,'' she says. ``Instead of getting a baby sitter, 
they took me along. I saw them having fun. They were in `Company.' 
To be doing April, the stewardess in `Company' on Broadway with 
Sondheim, felt to me like an out-of-body experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	1. Did you always want to be a singer and an actress?  
</P>
<P>
	Krakowski: I focused more to be a dancer than anything else. I  
was taking dance at 3. I thought I wanted to be a ballerina until I 
became a preteen and realized I didn't have the discipline or the 
body shape to make it into the professional ballet world. 
</P>
<P>
	2. How did you get involved in show business?  
</P>
<P>
	Krakowski: I was hired to do commercials and for acting jobs. I  
found it fascinating playing other people. I had been singing 
increasingly. I was in `Starlight Express' on Broadway. My agent 
called and said he had good news and bad news. `The good news is 
you've got your first Broadway show and the bad news is it's on 
roller skates.' I kept losing my voice. I went to vocal therapy and 
relearned how to speak and sing. 
</P>
<P>
	2 1/2. Besides ``Starlight Express'' and ``Company,'' what other  
Broadway shows were you in? 
</P>
<P>
	Krakowski: One of the most creative was `Grand Hotel.' You  
rarely get to create a new musical these days. We started from 
scratch, with workshops and hardly any script. We read the novel it 
was based on and improvised. The show was born through all those 
sessions. It culminated in me being nominated for a Tony. It was a 
full-package Broadway experience for me. 
</P>
<P>
	3. How did you get from Broadway musicals to television and  
film? 
</P>
<P>
	Krakowski: I was doing `Once Upon a Mattress.' It got mixed  
reviews and we were on a week-to-week notice. I started auditioning 
for other things. I got `Ally McBeal' and the film `Dance With Me' 
in the same week. It must have been a good hair week. It worked out 
with the schedule. I could go to L.A. and do the TV pilot and stay 
and do the movie. `Ally McBeal' was picked up for a full season. I 
went with one suitcase and never went back to New York. 
</P>
<P>
	4. What changes has ``Ally McBeal'' brought into your life?  
</P>
<P>
	Krakowski: I don't take anything for granted. Enjoy it while you  
have it, it probably will go away at some point. When `Ally McBeal' 
won a Golden Globe last year, I was still renting a car. I still 
rent a furnished apartment and a TV, but I bought a car. 
</P>
<P>
	5. Did you ever consider taking a stage name?  
</P>
<P>
	Krakowski: For many years I did. But I could not come up with  
anything I thought was me. When I was in `Grand Hotel,' Tommy Tune 
used to call me asking if I'd come up with anything yet. He thought 
I should. I never got anywhere with it. I think you can keep your 
original names in this day and age and be successful.

<HEADLINE> 2 Japan Banks Form Pension Alliance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Two major Japanese banks said Wednesday they have  
agreed to form an alliance in the pension business, the latest step 
in a reorganization of the nation's financial industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanwa Bank and Toyo Trust and Banking Co. will jointly establish  
a company to promote sales 401k-type pension plans, which are 
expected to be introduced in Japan as early as next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes as Japanese banks struggle to dispose of piles of  
bad loans left from the collapse of property prices nearly a decade 
ago. Many banks have been left holding land as collateral for 
soured loans. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, two other trust banks -- Chuo Trust and Banking Co.  
and Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. -- announced a tentative agreement 
to merge. A wave of consolidations has swept Japan's financial 
industry recently amid wide-ranging reforms. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanwa and Toyo are also considering joining forces in securities  
custody, and other investment trust businesses, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Sanwa, a commercial bank, caters to retail customers while trust  
banks, such as Toyo, specialize in managing funds for corporations, 
pensions and big individual investors. 
</P>
<P>
	Developing the infrastructure to manage pension program, such as  
401k plans, requires a huge investment. Plans for similar ventures 
have already been announced by the Industrial Bank of Japan and 
Nomura Securities Co.

<HEADLINE>  NBA Lockout Officially Ends </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After 204 days, hundreds of millions of dollars  
in losses and countless fits, starts, fights and snags, the NBA 
lockout finally came to an official end Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a great feeling,'' commissioner David Stern said after he  
and union president Patrick Ewing affixed their signatures to the 
nearly 300-page collective bargaining agreement. '' It was an 
incredible relief.'' 
</P>
<P>
	All league business will officially begin at 2 p.m. Thursday,  
with training camps opening and trades and free agent signings 
going through. 
</P>
<P>
	The 50-game schedule for the upcoming season will be released,  
Scottie Pippen will officially join the Houston Rockets, Latrell 
Sprewell will become a member of the New York Knicks, Antonio 
McDyess will return to Denver and the Chicago Bulls will renounce 
their rights to Michael Jordan -- all of it happening at once in 
what promises to be busiest day in league history. 
</P>
<P>
	``For us, we're just incredibly relieved and feel very good  
about going back to work,'' said Stern, who attended a party at the 
NBA Store after the agreement was signed. 
</P>
<P>
	Still unanswered are dozens of questions about who will play  
where, what the schedule will look like and whether the fans who 
were so turned off by the prolonged process will return with their 
old enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	Two of the most pressing issues on the free agent front were the  
futures of McDyess and Tom Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess decided early in the evening to return to the Nuggets,  
the team he played for in his first two NBA seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real close call,'' said McDyess' agent, James Bryant.  
``It came down to a question of do you want to inherit a contender 
or do you want to build one? Phoenix is a great franchise, but 
Denver is doing a lot of exciting things that haven't come out yet. 
</P>
<P>
	``Antonio has a chance to be the main guy there,'' Bryant said.  
``And as you know, he played about 24 minutes per game in Phoenix 
last year and will play more than 40 a game in Denver. This is a 
player they will build a franchise around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns, who surrendered two players and four draft picks when  
they acquired McDyess from the Nuggets, immediately turned their 
attention to Gugliotta. But there remained a chance that Gugliotta 
would end up in Minnesota or with the Lakers. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, Rod Strickland was wondering whether the Washington  
Wizards would improve their offer of $30 million guaranteed for 
three years, with two additional non-guaranteed years. 
</P>
<P>
	Strickland's agent, David Falk, was trying to engineer a  
sign-and-trade deal while also contemplating whether to advise 
Strickland to sign a one-year deal with another team and then 
re-enter the free agent market next summer. 
</P>
<P>
	Other players and their agents worked feverishly to finalize  
deals. Among the tentative agreements: 
</P>
<P>
	-- Christian Laettner heading to the Detroit Pistons in a  
sign-and-trade deal sending Charles O'Bannon and Scot Pollard to 
Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Derek Harper was joining the Los Angeles Lakers.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Billy Owens was signing with Seattle.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Jud Buechler was set to sign with Detroit.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Michael Stewart was close to signing with Boston.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Jerome Kersey was headed to San Antonio.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Sam Perkins was ready to sign with Indiana.  
</P>
<P>
	-- Eric Murdock was joining New Jersey.  
</P>
<P>
	``Tomorrow will be the craziest day in the history of the  
league,'' agent Keith Glass said, ``and I'm looking forward to 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Among the other unresolved questions was where Charlotte free  
agent center Vlade Divac would sign. The Suns were interested if 
they lost both McDyess and Gugliotta, and the Sacramento Kings were 
weighing whether they should renounce the rights to free agent 
Corliss Williamson in order to clear enough salary cap room to meet 
Divac's asking price. One agent, who spoke on condition of 
anonymity, insisted that the Seattle SuperSonics were making a late 
push for Divac. 
</P>
<P>
	Other free agents, including Hot Rod Williams, Brent Barry and  
Charlie Ward, still were not sure where they would be signing. 
</P>
<P>
	There also were a slew of unconfirmed trade rumors involving  
Donyell Marshall, Bob Sura and John Starks. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a pent-up demand for information about players and  
playing, not about negotiators and negotiating,'' Stern said. 
``We're ready to get back to work.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The league released the schedule of exhibition games, with the  
first Sunday night at the United Center with the Indiana Pacers 
taking on a team no one will recognize -- the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The regular season will begin Feb. 5.  
</P>
<P>
	The new collective bargaining agreement wasn't finalized without  
a final round of snags. 
</P>
<P>
	After meeting all night, lawyers for the owners and union broke  
off talks late in the morning. The main sticking point had been 
whether the new middle-class exception could be used for a 
three-year contract (the league's contention) or a six-year 
contract (the union's contention). 
</P>
<P>
	The union won that argument, but a final hitch developed over  
the league's insistence upon having discipline authority over 
agents involved in salary cap circumvention. Another snag concerned 
whether bonus money would be counted in trade calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	The final issues were resolved over the phone and the lawyers  
went through a final proofreading before Stern and Ewing finally 
put pen to paper at about 6 p.m. in a conference room on the 21st 
floor of a midtown Manhattan skyscraper. No photographers were 
present to record the moment, and the opposing lawyers, most of 
whom had been working all night on the agreement, offered only a 
smattering of applause. 
</P>
<P>
	``The overriding emotion was shock from looking at the lawyers  
for both sides,'' Stern said. ``We were looking for some 
intravenous feeding and other ways to take care of them. We hope 
they will be accepted back by their families.''

<HEADLINE> Another Look Into the Sweet Science </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- ``H'' on the elevator button at the Downtown  
Athletic Club stands for Heisman because it takes you to the 
Heisman Room. 
</P>
<P>
	A cynic thought it might be better if the ``H'' button was  
replaced by the correct floor number -- ``13'' -- when hearings on 
professional boxing, a sport many consider themselves unlucky to be 
in -- were held this week at the home of college football's Heisman 
Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	Some promoters, representatives of boxing governing bodies,  
physicians, people concerned about boxing and boxers appeared 
before the National Association of Attorneys General Boxing Task 
Force. 
</P>
<P>
	The group of state attorneys general is looking into the ills  
and evils of the Sweet Science and could propose national 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	``It never seems like anything comes of these things,'' promoter  
Cedric Kushner said of the hearings. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Sen. John McCain of Arizona has pushed through some  
modest legislation to benefit boxers, it does seem that numerous 
hearings held to clean up the sport have usually achieved nothing 
more than to draw some media attention to those conducting them. 
</P>
<P>
	Jim Ryan, attorney general in Illinois, vice chairman on the  
Task Force, chaired by attorney general Eliot Spitzer of New York, 
scoffed at critics who saw the hearings as another exercise in 
futility. 
</P>
<P>
	Ryan noted that the state attorneys general took on and beat the  
tobacco industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, some saw the idea that boxing can be governed like  
professional team sports as a pipe dream. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to get fighters a fair shake and make their often brutal  
profession safer, however, is a worthy endeavor. 
</P>
<P>
	IBF middleweight champion Bernard Hopkins cited one instance of  
his purse being severely reduced because his management was working 
with a promoter. He also said many fighters often don't know what 
they're signing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're coming from the street,'' he said. ``We don't have no  
high education. I'm one of the fortunate. I picked up a book.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Obviously, he also read it.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a lot of investments,'' the 33-year-old Hopkins said.  
``I have a $500,000 home paid for. I might be one of the safest 
boxers in boxing. I don't spend a dime. I don't leave tips, so 
don't eat with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Unfortunately, a lot of boxers throw away money faster than they  
throw punches. 
</P>
<P>
	Fighters should have legal help in understanding contracts, but  
many can't afford it or they listen to ``friends'' and family 
members, who have no more understanding about the business of 
boxing than the boxers. 
</P>
<P>
	Promoters argue that they need exclusive contracts so that after  
they spend money developing fighters to championship or 
near-championship levels, the boxers don't leave them for another 
promoter. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't see anything wrong with exclusive contracts with  
boxers and promoters,'' promoter Dino Duva said. ``A long-term 
contract protects a promoter's investment. If the deal is fair, 
then a boxer can benefit. The key is fairness.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It should be noted that a small percentage of boxers have  
long-term contracts with promoters. Many boxers are journeymen who 
fight for small purses because they like being fighters. They are 
boxing's backbone, and often their treatment by the sport's movers 
and shakers is boxing's black eye. 
</P>
<P>
	Long-term contracts are sometimes signed by star fighters with  
HBO and Showtime. Both networks deny being promoters or 
matchmakers, but they control when their contracted big-money stars 
fight, and they have a lot to say about the opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives of both cable networks did not appear at the  
hearings, but they were invited. 
</P>
<P>
	Kushner put the business of boxing in perspective when he said,  
``There's two sides to every story, or as we say in boxing . . . 
three sides.''

<HEADLINE> Court Dilutes Subcontractors' Rights </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Companies that serve as subcontractors on  
federal projects may not force the government to pay them in full 
when the prime contractors fail to do so, the Supreme Court ruled 
today in an Oregon dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for a unanimous  
court, cited ``the established rule that, unless waived by 
Congress, sovereign immunity bars subcontractors and other 
creditors from enforcing liens on government property or funds to 
recoup their losses.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers had warned the court against allowing  
such legal actions, saying government agencies should not be 
concerned ``with whether new money will have to be found to pay 
unpaid subcontractors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Army signed a $432,000 contract in 1993 with Verdan  
Technologies for installation of a telephone switching system at an 
outpost in Umatilla, Ore. 
</P>
<P>
	Verdan, in turn, hired Blue Fox Inc. as a subcontractor to  
construct a concrete block building to house the telephone system 
and install certain safety and support systems. Verdan agreed to 
pay Blue Fox $186,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Government contractors usually are required to post bonds  
guaranteeing payment to project subcontractors and suppliers but 
Verdan's contract was treated as a services agreement and it was 
not required to post such a payment bond. 
</P>
<P>
	When Blue Fox completed its work, Verdan paid it a little less  
than $140,000 -- leaving more than $46,000 unpaid. Blue Fox sued and 
won a default judgment against Verdan but concluded that it would 
never be able to collect the owed money. So it sued the Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law allows people and companies with a grievance against  
some agency to sue the government as long as the lawsuit seeks some 
relief other than ``money damages.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Blue Fox contended that is was seeking an ``equitable lien'' and  
not damages. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge threw out the lawsuit in 1996, but the 9th  
U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reinstated it. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's decision said the appeals court was wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear,'' Rehnquist said, ``that the equitable nature of  
the lien sought by ... (Blue Fox) does not mean that its ultimate 
claim was not one for `money damages' within the meaning'' of 
federal law. ``Liens, whether equitable or legal, are merely a 
means to the end of satisfying a claim for the recovery of money,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Department of Army vs. Blue Fox Inc., 97-1642.

<HEADLINE> Midshipman Cited in Sex Encounter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) -- A sexual encounter between midshipmen in a  
Naval Academy dormitory could result in the expulsion of one of the 
students for misconduct. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Pilson Jr. acknowledged having sex in the dorm, an  
offense punishable by expulsion. He says the sex was consensual, 
but the female midshipman accused him of rape last July. 
</P>
<P>
	Pilson contends the woman made up the allegation to avoid  
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	A military judge threw out charges of rape, burglary and conduct  
unbecoming an officer during the service's equivalent of a

intoxicated and could not recall the events in detail.

	Pilson's attorney is fighting the expulsion, which could result  
in the Navy forcing Pilson to pay $70,000 in educational costs. 
</P>
<P>
	The academy is not seeking to expel the female midshipman, The  
Washington Times reported Tuesday. Pilson and his father accused 
the academy of racism for treating Pilson, who is black, 
differently from the woman, who is white. 
</P>
<P>
	The woman, who is not being named by The Associated Press  
because of her rape allegation, declined requests for interviews, 
said Cmdr. Mike Brady, an academy spokesman.

<P>
	Brady denied that race or gender play any role in the  
investigation.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes Message on the Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Leaving behind a chilly political clime in  
Washington, President Clinton road-tested his State of the Union 
proposals for education, Social Security and other initiatives 
today. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton told an overflow audience that he had come to Buffalo  
with Vice President Al Gore, his wife, Tipper, and Hillary Rodham 
Clinton to demonstrate ``how committed we are'' to the agenda he 
laid out before Congress Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``We want you to be committed to it, too,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	In an address to the more than 20,000 people inside the arena,  
Clinton was to emphasize the need to use the federal budget surplus 
to shore up Social Security despite Republican calls for a broad 
tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is going to be a debate about the right way to use the  
surplus,'' White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton urged Congress to join him in bolstering education and  
shoring up the retirement system, and set off today to appeal to 
Americans for support at campaign-style appearances in Buffalo and 
suburban Philadelphia. 
</P>
<P>
	``With our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our  
confidence rising, now is the time for this generation to meet our 
historic responsibility to the 21st century,'' Clinton exhorted the 
joint session of Congress convened for his prime-time address. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's get to work,'' he said in the House chamber just hours  
after his impeachment trial in the Senate recessed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's travels were in keeping with Clinton's efforts to focus  
on the nation's business and underscored his intention to pursue 
what aides called an ``activist agenda'' midway through his second 
term in office. 
</P>
<P>
	The Gores and Mrs. Clinton were accompanying Clinton later in  
the day to a Norristown, Pa., high school rally. Meanwhile, members 
of Clinton's Cabinet were traveling on their own to highlight the 
president's initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley was amplifying on the State of  
the Union proposals at a roundtable in Dallas, while Housing 
Secretary Andrew Cuomo was addressing residents of an empowerment 
zone in St. Louis. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna 
Shalala was participating in a child care event with Chicago Mayor 
Richard Daley. Education Secretary Richard Riley was meeting with 
high school students in Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said 20,000 tickets were distributed to  
people who wanted to see Clinton at Marine Midland Arena in 
Buffalo, which has had five feet of snow this winter. Clinton has 
made several public appearances since he was impeached on Dec. 19, 
but all were before smaller and more exclusive audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton and his Secret Service detail passed up the usual  
presidential limo in favor of a tan four-wheel-drive vehicle with 
the presidential seal on the door. Crowds braved long lines in 
freezing temperatures to gain entry to the arena. Supporters 
shouted down a small knot of protesters who stood outside the arena 
with signs urging Clinton to resign. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials concede they face a challenge in  
getting lawmakers caught up in the impeachment process to embrace 
Clinton's initiatives. One way is for Clinton to address it is to 
speak past Washington's political establishment directly to the 
public and make the case that he can still be effective. 
</P>
<P>
	``It bothers me that he lied to everybody,'' said 18-year-old  
Amy Brandau, a senior lunching in the Norristown High School 
cafeteria on Tuesday. ``But I'm willing to put those things aside 
to see him in person. It sounds corny, but when am I ever going to 
see a president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's Social Security proposal would use most of the $4  
trillion in projected budget surpluses over 15 years to shore up 
Social Security and create new 401(k)-style retirement accounts. 
That is sure to set up a legislative battle with Republicans, who 
want to use a big portion of the surpluses for a 10 percent 
across-the-board tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Other items he unveiled included $1 billion to help about  
200,000 welfare families get jobs; $1 billion in tax credits to 
encourage investment in impoverished urban and rural areas; a tax 
credit of up to $250 per child age 1 or younger for parents who 
stay home to care for them; and $600 million for after-school and 
summer-school programs helping 1.1 million children. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also proposed a $1 increase in the minimum wage and  
spending $12 billion to improve military readiness and 
modernization in fiscal year 2000.

<HEADLINE> McCain Pushing Air Competition Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Sen. John McCain pledged quick action this  
year on legislation to increase flights out of major airports, 
expand air access for people in smaller communities and ensure 
competition in the aviation industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must pass legislation that will bring competition to  
communities that are paying astronomical air fares that hurt their 
economy,'' McCain, R-Ariz., the chairman of the Senate Commerce 
Committee, said Wednesday at a hearing on his bill. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain and House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster,  
R-Pa., are both pushing sweeping bills that would reauthorize the 
Federal Aviation Administration, enhance competition and generate 
more money for airport improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The two chambers failed to reach agreement on differing bills  
last year, and Congress had to pass a stopgap six-month extension 
to keep the FAA operating through March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's bill, nearly identical to legislation that passed the  
Senate 92-1 last year, would reauthorize the FAA for two years and 
provide about $2.4 billion each year for the Airport Improvement 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
	It would increase flights out of Chicago's O'Hare, LaGuardia and  
JFK in New York and Reagan National in Washington. Thirty new slots 
-- each equivalent to a takeoff and landing -- would be allocated to 
O'Hare, with 18 to go to underserved communities. 
</P>
<P>
	It would create 12 new round-trip flights at National, six which  
would go beyond 1,250 miles, a distance limit set under the 1986 
``perimeter rule'' set up to protect the economic viability of 
Dulles and Baltimore-Washington, the region's two long-haul 
airports. Only aircraft with the lowest noise levels could be 
added. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Murphy, deputy assistant secretary for aviation at the  
Transportation Department, agreed with McCain that perimeters and 
slots hurt consumers and ``are no longer required for safety and 
operational control.'' But he said noise and local development 
remain issues in expanding flights out of busy airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill died last year in part because House Judiciary  
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., resisted the addition of 
flights at O'Hare. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's bill would also establish a four-year program to  
develop air service in small communities and require the 
Transportation Department to review marketing and other airline 
practices that could inhibit competition. 
</P>
<P>
	He noted that because of the reluctance of airlines to service  
smaller markets, it's cheaper to fly from Chicago to Tokyo than to 
Des Moines, Iowa. 
</P>
<P>
	It tightens restrictions on commercial air tour flights over  
national parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster's legislation would reauthorize the FAA for five years  
and would ensure that all airline ticket tax revenues be devoted to 
aviation improvements. 
</P>
<P>
	The ranking Democrat on the Senate committee, Sen. Ernest  
Hollings of South Carolina, said it was ``downright outrageous'' 
that a large portion of airport taxes goes into the general budget 
for non-aviation programs. In fiscal 1999, he said, there will be 
$10 billion in revenues but only $5.8 billion in spending on 
airport improvement. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA assistant administrator David Traynham said the  
administration will submit legislation in the next few weeks on 
raising the airport ticket tax, called the passenger facility 
charge. The administration last year failed in an effort to raise 
the charge from $3 to $4, and reportedly is looking at a $2 boost. 
</P>
<P>
	Murphy also said Britain had suggested informal talks next month  
on seeking a broad ``open-skies'' agreement expanding flights 
across the Atlantic. The United States walked out of the talks last 
October, citing a lack of progress after six years of negotiations.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Tempting for Gamblers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- For compulsive gamblers, this is a dangerous time.  
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl represents a way to win back the money lost on  
all those bad bets made during the season. And that's why, experts 
say, the big game is so tempting and the consequences can be so 
dire. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very stressful time,'' said Pat Fowler, executive  
director of the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling. ``Not just 
for the gambler, but people living with them. It's extremely 
stressful and a sometimes abusive time for family members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The council's New Jersey chapter estimates that at least $85  
million will be wagered legally on the Denver Broncos or Atlanta 
Falcons when they meet in Miami on Jan. 31. Another $4 billion will 
be bet illegally through bookies, office pools and between friends. 
</P>
<P>
	For compulsive gamblers -- with the game hyped nearly everywhere  
and office betting pools almost mandatory -- trying to stay on the 
wagon is not easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here I am trying to remain abstinent and here comes a pal at  
the office, asking, 'Where's your money for the pool? You can't be 
the only one in the office who doesn't participate,''' Fowler said 
of the typical gambler. ``Their futures, their families are being 
threatened by being in this environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The council has found that many women who get hooked on gambling  
become initiated by the office betting pool at Super Bowl time or 
during the Final Four college basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Talley, a reformed gambler and counselor in St. Petersburg,  
said his business always picks up immediately after the Super Bowl. 
The game often is seen as a panacea by the problem bettor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get more calls after Super Bowl than any other time of the  
year,'' Talley said. ``This is the last hurrah. Some people are 
going to put it all on the last game. And that's when the calls 
start coming in because you are going to lose. All compulsive 
gamblers do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The days leading to the Super Bowl offer an opportunity for  
authorities to uncover gambling rings. Police in Broward County, 
just north of Miami, confiscated $93,000 this week and arrested 
seven people from four bookmaking sites. 
</P>
<P>
	One Orlando man knows how devastating gambling can be. He would  
wager anywhere between $25,000 to $50,000 a week. Eventually, his 
life came crashing down. 
</P>
<P>
	``You alienate the people closest to you,'' said Paul, who spoke  
only on condition his surname was not used. ``Your money is 
controlled by your betting. You hold back money that you might use 
to improve your financial situation. It takes over your whole life. 
It's like a drug. You don't care about your family or anything. You 
just want to get a bet down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greed is not on the problem gambler's mind. Paul, who had won  
fortunes only to lose them, said he craved the excitement. When he 
won, he said, he felt like ``a big shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those unwilling to accept their problem can bottom out at this  
time of year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't get treatment you are going to get back into the  
gambling, you are going to ruin your life and end up in jail or 
committing suicide,'' said Ed Looney, who runs the Trenton, N.J., 
chapter of the council. 
</P>
<P>
	Compulsive sports gambling is increasing, he said, thanks partly  
to the proliferation of Internet betting sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a 22-year old kid call three months ago. He had maxed  
out his father's credit card at $18,000 gambling on sports on the 
Internet,'' Looney said. ``His mom called crying on telephone, 
asking: 'Is this legal? Can I get my money back?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Talley was flying this week to Michigan to counsel a problem  
gambler who had embezzled from the family business and pilfered his 
retirement and children's college funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can testify that life is great after quitting gambling,''  
said Talley, who had to take a second mortgage to repay his debt 
after kicking the habit. ``Gamblers are very talented people, they 
average an IQ of 120 or better. They just have this horrible 
disease.''

<HEADLINE> Kleiber Conducts After Long Absence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAS PALMAS, Grand Canary (AP) -- Like a comet streaking back to  
Earth after a long journey, Carlos Kleiber ended his 1 1/2-year 
absence from the podium, popping up on this island 180 miles off 
the western edge of the Sahara. 
</P>
<P>
	His Jan. 7 concert, which opened the Canary Islands music  
festival, was just the fifth performance given by the reclusive 
conductor since 1994 and only the 23rd since 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	He repeated the program -- Beethoven's Fourth and Seventh  
symphonies and an encore of Johann Strauss's ``Die Fledermaus'' 
overture -- two nights later in nearby Santa Cruz de Tenerife, the 
festival's other site. It is not known when Kleiber, 68, will 
conduct again or why he even chose to conduct on these Spanish 
islands. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleiber, who lives near Munich, Germany, has not held a regular  
job since 1968, turns down dozens of invitations each year from 
major orchestras and opera houses, and has not given an interview 
in decades. 
</P>
<P>
	When encountered in his hotel's rooftop restaurant after the  
performance and asked whether he had plans to conduct again in New 
York, he replied, ``Maybe next year,'' sounding more like he was 
trying to end the conversation quickly than give an accurate 
answer. 
</P>
<P>
	Why the fuss?  
</P>
<P>
	Kleiber, the son of famed German conductor Erich Kleiber, gives  
electric performances, where the fast notes sound faster, the slow 
notes sound slower, the climaxes seem louder and the soft passages 
are musical whispers. Colors are heard that do not come out under 
the batons of other maestros. 
</P>
<P>
	These performances were with the Bavarian Radio Symphony  
Orchestra, the Bayerischen Rundfunks, which he had never conducted 
before. Yet, after five rehearsals (which were closed to the 
public), it sounded as if he had led the orchestra all his life. 
</P>
<P>
	On a rainy night with 60 mph winds -- local newspapers said it  
was the worst storm in the area in two decades -- 1,600 people 
filled the sparkling Auditorio Alfredo Kraus, which opened in 
December 1997. A large contingent came from Japan, where Kleiber is 
revered, and critics from around the world were in attendance, 
hoping this would not be another of his frequent cancellations. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleiber, looking a bit frail, walked stiffly to the podium to a  
loud and prolonged ovation. He arranged the orchestra with eight 
double basses on a platform behind the brass and woodwinds, rather 
than off to the right behind the violas. The playing was exquisite. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleiber, criticized for his limited repertoire -- 10 operas, 10  
symphonies and a handful of other pieces -- had not conducted a 
Beethoven symphony since 1987, according to records compiled by 
Toru Hirasawa, who has researched a comprehensive performance 
history. Such a gap would be unimaginable for any other major 
conductor. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there were tiny scorebooks of each symphony on the  
stand in front him, he did not refer to them a single time all 
night. 
</P>
<P>
	He knew what he wanted to do. The sounds coming out of the  
orchestra were more sublime than heard from any other conductor 
since the deaths of Herbert van Karajan, Leonard Bernstein and Sir 
Georg Solti, the three giants who dominated classical music in the 
second half of the 20th century. 
</P>
<P>
	When Kleiber chops his left hand down, the sound is amazingly  
short and sharp. For marches, the baton often is fixed at his right 
hip while his left hand massages the details. 
</P>
<P>
	During the allegretto, the slow second movement of the Seventh  
Symphony, the double basses sounded sweeter than chamber music, 
almost like purring cats. During the allegro con brio that closes 
the work, his arms seemed to fly through the air like birds, 
coaxing ever more triumphant sounds from sections that were both on 
their own and working together. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleiber, according to those who have worked with him, is so shy  
that he often is afraid to appear before orchestras and the public, 
not wanting to deal with the acclaim. Indeed, when a fan walked to 
the lip of the stage and presented a rose to him during one of the 
ovations, he immediately walked to a female violist and gave the 
flower to her. 
</P>
<P>
	After the concert, instead of following the normal practice of  
greeting fans in a ``green room,'' Kleiber quickly changed out of 
his white-tie-and-tails and left. He seems upset when attention is 
focused on him, and orchestra managers say it is nearly impossible 
to get him to agree to perform. 
</P>
<P>
	``Carlos Kleiber will conduct only where and when he wants to,''  
Joseph Volpe, general manager of the Metropolitan Opera, said a few 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Kleiber has conducted just 25 times in the United States: six  
performances with the Chicago Symphony in 1978 and 1981, and 19 at 
the Met from 1988-90. Since leading the Vienna State Opera in 
Richard Strauss' ``Der Rosenkavalier'' during its 1994 Japan tour, 
he has been virtually retired, appearing mainly off the beaten 
track: in Ljubljana, Slovenia; Ravenna, Italy; and Ingolstadt, 
Germany. 
</P>
<P>
	He had not appeared at all since the Ravenna performance on June  
19, 1997. The Ingolstadt concert, according to the German magazine 
Der Spiegel, was done in exchange for a $100,000 Audi, rather than 
a fee. 
</P>
<P>
	Just another oddity in an odd career.  
</P>
<P>
	Even his colleagues have been puzzled.  
</P>
<P>
	``You cannot get better,'' Solti said shortly before his death  
in 1997, ``if you conduct once a year.''

<HEADLINE> Bonds Prices Are Mostly Lower / Bonds  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Bond prices were mostly lower Wednesday as  
investors had little reaction to fresh warnings from Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan about the likelihood of more global 
economic turbulence. 
</P>
<P>
	The price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond fell 13/32  
point, or $4.06 per $1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in 
the opposite direction, rose to 5.17 percent from 5.14 percent 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan told the House Ways and Means Committee that he saw  
three primary threats to the U.S. economy -- a mushrooming trade 
deficit caused by spreading recessions overseas, a potentially 
inflationary shortage of workers and an unsustainably high stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	A slowing economy would be bullish for bonds by raising the  
chances for additional declines in interest rates while holding 
down inflation. In addition, a turbulent stock market usually 
drives up demand for Treasury securities as a haven. 
</P>
<P>
	But Greenspan's testimony suggested the central bank has no  
immediate plans to cut interest rates and could even be taken as 
justification for a rate increase later in the year, some analysts 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In other bond trading Wednesday, prices of short-term Treasury  
securities fell between 1/32 point and 1/16 point, and intermediate 
maturities fell 1/8 point to 9/32 point, reported Bridge Telerate, a 
financial information service. 
</P>
<P>
	The Lehman Brothers Daily Treasury Bond Index, reflecting price  
movements on bonds with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.57 
points from Tuesday to 1,313.98. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields on three-month Treasury bills were 4.36 percent as the  
discount fell 0.02 percentage point from the Treasury auction on 
Tuesday to 4.26 percent. Six-month yields were 4.44 percent as the 
discount fell 0.02 percentage point from the Treasury auction to 
4.29 percent. Auctions were delayed until Tuesday because of the 
federal holiday Monday. 
</P>
<P>
	One-year yields were 4.50 percent as the discount rose by 0.03  
percentage point from Tuesday to 4.31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Yields are the interest bonds pay by maturity, while the  
discount is the interest at which they are sold. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between  
banks, rose to 4.50 percent from 4.38 percent Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively  
traded municipal bonds fell to 124 11/32 from 124 19/32 Tuesday. 
The average yield to maturity rose to 5.18 percent from 5.17 
percent.

	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures moved higher early  
today on the Chicago Board of Trade in a technical correction 
following heavy losses a day earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Futures prices moved higher as low values prompted opportunistic  
buying, but analysts said the market remained fundamentally weak 
amid a poor export demand picture. 
</P>

	Corn and soybeans faced pressure from beneficial rains for  
competing crops in Argentina and Brazil, while the entire grain and 
soybean complex suffered from jitters that Brazil's economic 
troubles could spread to the rest of Latin America.

	Wheat for March delivery rose 1 cent to $2.69 1/2 a bushel; March  
corn rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.15 a bushel; March oats rose 2 cents to 
$1.07 3/4 a bushel; March soybeans rose 2 1/2 cents to $5.27 1/2 a bushel.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- The Associated Press, in a Jan. 20 story  
about Michael Ovitz's $25 million donation to help rebuild the 
earthquake-damaged UCLA Medical Center, erroneously reported the 
contribution was made Jan. 19. It was made in February 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The AP also paraphrased the former Walt Disney Co. president as  
saying he was one credit shy of a degree when he graduated in 1968. 
In fact, Ovitz earned the proper number of credits before 
graduation and his comment was meant as a joke, said UCLA 
spokeswoman Roxanne Yamaguchi Moster.

<HEADLINE> Armored Car Robber Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- An armored car driver who stole a  
record $18.8 million and fled to Mexico was sentenced to 25 years 
in prison Wednesday, claiming all the while that he committed the 
crime to punish his employer and help the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Noel Johnson, 35, pulled a gun on two Loomis, Fargo &AMP; Co.  
co-workers in 1997 and loaded a van floor-to-ceiling with bags of 
cash. He then drove one of the guards to North Carolina, where he 
stashed most of the money in a mini-warehouse and left the 
co-worker handcuffed to a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was arrested in Texas five months later after crossing  
back from Mexico by bus. A border agent who thought he sounded like 
a liar ran the name he gave through a computer and discovered it 
was an alias for Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded guilty to kidnapping, money laundering and  
interfering with interstate commerce with violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want any more than 1 or 2 million for myself,'' he  
told U.S. District Judge Harvey Schlesinger at his sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he planned to use 20 percent of the haul to help poor  
people in Central America and offer 80 percent of the money back to 
Loomis if it changed the way it treated its employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their employees are little more than slaves,'' Johnson said.  
``There are people risking their lives for $7 an hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had complained of a life of disappointment before  
committing the robbery, and had plotted the crime for six years. 
Most of the money was later found in the mini-warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the nation's biggest armored car heist was $10.8  
million, taken in Rochester, N.Y., in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's attorney, Tom Cushman, said: ``He didn't take the  
money to have a good time. And I don't think he had a good time.''

<HEADLINE> Midwife Charged With Manslaughter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STAFFORD, Va. (AP) -- An unlicensed midwife and her assistant  
were charged with involuntary manslaughter in the case of a woman 
who bled to death after they helped her give birth at home. 
</P>
<P>
	A grand jury also charged the dead woman's mother-in-law with  
perjury for allegedly lying to the special grand jury that 
investigated the death of Julia A. Peters. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Peters, 30, died on Sept. 8, 1997 after giving birth to a  
healthy baby girl. 
</P>
<P>
	A Stafford County grand jury indicted Cynthia L. Caillagh, 45,  
and her assistant, M. Elizabeth Haw, 41, and Claire E. Peters, 57, 
the mother-in-law. The indictments were issued in September and on 
Jan. 4 but were sealed until Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Telephone listings could not be found for Ms. Caillagh and Ms.  
Haw. Peter D. Greenspun, Ms. Caillagh's attorney, is out of town 
this week and unavailable for comment, his office said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Haw's attorney, David Bracken, said: ``There's a motivation  
behind these charges by people that are adamantly opposed to home 
births.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Haws did everything she could to save Ms. Peters, Bracken  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Claire Peters declined to comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Caillagh and Ms. Haw each were charged with one felony count  
of involuntary manslaughter, one misdemeanor count of practicing 
medicine without a license and one misdemeanor count of practicing 
midwifery without a license. Ms. Peters was indicted on a felony 
perjury charge. 
</P>
<P>
	The felony charges carry either prison terms of one to 10 years,  
or jail terms of up to 12 months and/or fines of up to $2,500. The 
misdemeanor charges carry jail terms of up to 12 months and/or 
fines of up to $2,500.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Advance / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks advanced today, buoyed largely by  
reports that some ruling party legislators were calling for 
injection of public funds into real estate to stimulate the 
economy. The dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 257.61 points,  
or 1.87 percent, ending the day at 14,028.05. On Tuesday, the 
average closed down 34.62 points, or 0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.40 yen at late afternoon, down 0.64 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 113.49 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, traders said the afternoon rally was fueled  
by a report in Britain's Financial Times that a group of 
legislators in the Liberal Democratic Party was proposing that 20 
trillion yen ($176 billion) of public funds be injected into the 
real estate market to stimulate activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Such proposals have been made in the past, but traders  
nevertheless jumped on the report to buy property developer issues, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expectations rose for a radical handling of the bad debt  
problem in the real estate market,'' said Kenji Karikomi, deputy 
general manager at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also supported by other reports that suggested  
further consolidation within Japan's banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese news media reported that Sanwa Bank Ltd. and Toyo Trust  
and Banking Co. have reached a basic agreement to form alliance in 
the pension business, sending investors to buy banking issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks later officially announced the agreement.  
</P>
<P>
	Japan's banking industry is strugginng to dispose of mountains  
of bad loans left from the collapse of property price in the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyo Trust ended the day up 19 yen (17 cents) to 280 ($2.48) and  
Sanwa Bank up 34 yen (30 cents) to 1,020 ($9.03). 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices fell slightly in the morning session as players  
showed skepticism about Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's optimism on 
Japan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, players were paying more attention to  
overseas developments, including testimony by Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan later today in the United States and the 
Brazilian economy, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most selling came from short term interbank players who bought  
the yen, said Shuji Takano, assistant foreign exchange manager at 
ABN-Amro Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 5.27 points, or 1.42 percent, to 1,090.07. The 
TOPIX closed down 0.99 points, or 0.09 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.770 percent from Tuesday's finish of 
1.865 percent, driving its price up to 100.24 yen from 99.47 yen.

<HEADLINE> GM Reports Record Profit of $1.8B </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. turned in  
stronger-than-expected results in its North American automotive 
operations, more than offsetting losses in Asia and Latin America 
and enabling the world's largest automaker to post a record 
fourth-quarter profit of $1.8 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts said Wednesday's report indicated the industry's  
long-lumbering giant was finally awakening after years of 
restructuring, labor unrest, cost-cutting and overhauling its vast 
line of cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	``The new GM's earnings power is just starting to show now that  
they have some hot new products and have overhauled the cost 
structure,'' said analyst Scott Merlis of Wasserstein Perella 
Securities Inc. ``A much healthier GM is emerging from the one we 
once knew.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM credited healthy demand for its new vehicles in North America  
and Europe, increased production of high-profit light trucks and 
aggressive cost-cutting for its results. Analysts said they were 
re-evaluating their 1999 earnings estimates for GM in light of the 
fourth-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was definitely an over-the-top quarter,'' said analyst Nick  
Colas of Credit Suisse First Boston. ``It was way ahead of 
analysts' expectations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM's stock rose 1 percent, or 93 3/4 cents, to close at $88.93 3/4 a  
share in trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's October-December profit equaled $2.61 a fully diluted  
share, compared with the previous fourth-quarter record of $1.7 
billion, or $2.33 a share, set in 1997. Revenues totaled $46.4 
billion, down 2 percent from $47.1 billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, GM had less to cheer about. Last summer's strikes  
left it with a profit of $3 billion, or $4.18 a share, down 53 
percent from $6.3 billion, or $8.62 a share, earned in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues for the year totaled $161.3 billion, down from $171.2  
billion in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The year's performance will result in profit-sharing checks of  
only about $200 for GM's 231,000 union workers in the United 
States. That compares with 1997's profit-sharing of $750. Salaried 
workers will get $200 each, or 1 percent of their base salary, 
whichever is higher. 
</P>
<P>
	GM chairman Jack Smith said he was encouraged by the  
fourth-quarter performance. ``We came back strong following the 
work stoppage in midyear and we intend to keep this momentum going 
in the future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's home market was largely responsible for the big gain. North  
American operations earned $1.6 billion, a record for any quarter; 
the previous record was $841 million in last year's first quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	More vehicles were produced by GM's North American plants than  
in any fourth quarter in a decade as they rushed to restore 
strike-depleted inventories. Production totaled about 1.51 million 
cars and trucks; first quarter production is estimated at 1.47 
million vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings were boosted by lower spending on rebates and other  
incentives, down to $1,161 a vehicle from $1,732 during the third 
quarter. J. Michael Losh, chief financial officer, said he expected 
incentives to increase somewhat this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Less-profitable fleet sales were up to about 25 percent of all  
GM vehicles sold in the United States, compared with 20 percent a 
year ago. Losh said GM was catching up on orders it was unable to 
fill in the third quarter because of the strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Earnings were less impressive overseas. GM-Europe posted a $146  
million profit, thanks to healthy sales of the redesigned Opel 
Astra. But the automaker's Latin America-Africa-Mideast operations 
lost $212 million and Asia-Pacific operations lost $213 million. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economic problems and uncertainty in Asia and Latin  
America will be a continuing challenge in 1999,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's earnings were reduced by after-tax charges totaling $420  
million, or 64 cents a share. They included $80 million for 
employee severance packages and buyouts resulting from the 
restructuring of the North American field sales and service staff; 
$192 million for underperforming assets, early retirement packages 
and the closing of unprofitable joint ventures at the Delphi parts 
unit; $97 million primarily for the effect of the Asian recession 
on GM's investments in India and Thailand; and $51 million for 
underperforming assets and severance packages related to 
cost-cutting in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding those special items, GM's fourth-quarter profit  
totaled $2.2 billion, or $3.25 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, 
or $1.93 a share a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The company restated its fourth-quarter 1997 results to reflect  
the $10.1 billion sale of its Hughes Electronics defense unit. GM 
also had after-tax charges totaling $4 billion in that quarter for 
underperforming assets, the closure of the Buick City assembly 
complex in Flint, the sale of parts plants and leasing losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. was expected to report improved earnings  
Thursday.

<HEADLINE> RNC Chair Wary of Right-Wing Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The head of the Republican National Committee  
wants his fellow party members to quit the Council of Conservative 
Citizens because ``it appears that this group does hold racist 
views.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``A member of the party of (Abraham) Lincoln should not belong  
to such an organization,'' GOP Chairman Jim Nicholson said in a 
statement released Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholson also appealed directly to Buddy Witherspoon, one of  
the party's national committee members from South Carolina, to 
resign from the council. 
</P>
<P>
	Witherspoon, an orthodontist from Columbia, told Nicholson he  
would do nothing of the sort. He insisted the council's South 
Carolina chapter holds no racist views, but is simply an advocate 
for conservative causes, especially the right to display the 
Confederate flag in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	``Never have I heard anything said about race in any way, shape  
or form,'' Witherspoon said in an interview. 
</P>
<P>
	The St. Louis-based council has caused the RNC grief recently  
because of reports that both Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, 
R-Miss., and Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., spoke at council meetings. 
</P>
<P>
	Barr and Lott have said they were not aware of the council's  
racist positions. Barr said last month he disagreed ``with many of 
this group's ridiculous views.'' Last week, Lott also distanced 
himself from the group. 
</P>
<P>
	The council's Web site includes numerous articles suggesting  
that the white race is under siege. On Tuesday, visitors were urged 
to forget ``petty pretenders'' such as Martin Luther King Jr. and 
celebrate the birthday of ``the greatest American who ever lived'' 
-- General Robert E. Lee, leader of Confederate forces during the 
Civil War. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no room for racist views in the Republican Party,''  
said Nicholson. ``I never heard of the CCC until a few days ago, 
but it appears that this group does hold racist views. The 
Republican Party rejects and condemns such views forcefully and 
without hesitation or equivocation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The issue is likely to come up at this week's RNC's winter  
meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	At the meeting, Witherspoon is also planning to propose a  
resolution that would require the GOP to stop taking donations from 
gambling interests, and require that party donations be withheld 
from any candidate who supports legalized gambling. 
</P>
<P>
	Common Cause, a government finance watchdog, reports that from  
1988 to 1998, the gambling industry made $7.2 million in so-called 
soft money donations to the GOP, versus $6.3 million to the 
Democratic Party. 
</P>
<P>
	The video poker lobby also played an instrumental role this fall  
in defeating South Carolina Gov. David Beasley, a Republican who 
opposed creating a state lottery. Witherspoon said he supported 
Beasley.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Has Strong Approval Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton bolstered his already robust  
standing in the polls with a State of the Union address that 
focused on problems facing Americans but didn't mention his own 
biggest problem -- the Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls released Wednesday by ABC, CBS and NBC suggested the  
public's approval of Clinton's job performance are near all-time 
highs even as the Senate is hearing evidence on whether the 
president should be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	His job approval rating ranged from 66 percent in the ABC poll  
to 72 percent in the CBS poll to 76 percent in the NBC poll. His 
approval numbers were three to five points higher after the speech, 
depending on the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost four out of five Americans who watched President  
Clinton's State of the Union address approved of most of his 
proposals and agreed with his decision not to mention his 
impeachment trial, according to several polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-fourths of those questioned in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll  
of people who watched the State of the Union said the proposals 
suggested by Clinton will save Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	By better than a 2-to-1 margin, those polled by ABC said it's  
more important for the federal government to use the surplus for 
Medicare and Social Security rather than tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans favor applying part of the surplus for Social  
Security, but want to use the remainder for tax cuts. The president 
advocated using the surplus to bolster a number of areas of 
spending, most notably Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's ebullient description of the nation's economic  
growth had an effect on those who watched the speech. After the 
speech, 40 percent thought the nation's economy was excellent, 
compared to 27 percent before the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The bump in Clinton's approval rating comes at a time when his  
sustained job approval numbers are among the strongest for a 
president in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's average job approval rating for the last quarter  
of 1998 was 66 percent in the Gallup poll, one of the highest 
sustained performances by a president since President Lyndon 
Johnson's early years, according to Frank Newport, editor in chief 
of the Gallup Poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport noted that the public's approval in a poll of Clinton's  
handling of the economy was at 81 percent this weekend, as high as 
Gallup has recorded for any president on that measure, while his 
ratings on honesty and moral character have steadily dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``His handling of the economy is apparently more important to  
Americans than the fact that they can't describe him as honest and 
trustworthy,'' Newport said, adding that apparently ``one is more 
important to them than the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only time in the last three decades that presidents have  
enjoyed stronger approval rates in the Gallup poll for a sustained 
period were the first quarter of President Carter's term and the 
surge of popularity enjoyed by President Bush after the capture of 
Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega and the victory in the Persian 
Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other presidents in the last 50 years have served two  
full terms, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan. Newport noted that 
Eisenhower was at 57 percent and Reagan was at 48 percent job 
approval at similar points in their presidencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday night's State of the Union address, Clinton's  
salesmanship for his programs helped sell people on Clinton 
personally as well. The number of people with a positive view of 
Clinton grew to 51 percent in Gallup's poll, compared to 38 percent 
before the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of those polled by ABC said they trust Clinton to do a  
better job than the Republicans over the next few years in dealing 
with the country's problems, while about a third said they trust 
the Republicans more. That's a dramatic turnaround from the GOP's 
heady days in early 1995 after their takeover of Congress, when 
more than half trusted the Republicans more with the nation's 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	About six out of 10 oppose Clinton's removal, saying his actions  
do not warrant such an action, according to several of the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS poll of 930 adults had a margin of error of plus or  
minus 3 percentage points. The ABC poll of 584 adults had a margin 
of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. The NBC poll of 
620 adults had margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage 
points. The CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll of 454 adults had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes Message on the Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Riding a bump in the polls, President  
Clinton argued vigorously Wednesday for his plan to save the budget 
surplus for protecting Social Security, saying it will give the 
nation stronger economic footing ``long after I'm gone from the 
White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joined by the vice president and both their wives, Clinton  
promoted the agenda he revealed in his State of the Union address 
at the first public rally since Clinton was impeached Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he is ready for a major clash with Congress over  
whether some 60 percent of the federal surplus he anticipates -- $4 
trillion over 15 years -- should be reserved for shoring up Social 
Security or go for a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have a big argument about this, and we  
should,'' he said. ``It may sound good if somebody says this is 
your surplus and we ought to give it back to you. What I'm trying 
to do is give you a way to maximize the chances that we will have a 
strong economy'' in the future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's job approval rating got a lift following Tuesday  
night's speech and ranged from 66 percent to 76 percent, according 
to several network polls. His approval ratings also rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnstorming by ``all four principals,'' as the two Clintons and  
two Gores are known among White House staff, was unusual. Except 
for big-ticket party fund-raisers and personal outings, the 
foursome has not really traveled together and appeared as a package 
deal since the 1996 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	More than 20,000 people buoyantly received the visitors from  
Washington at the Marine Midland Arena in Buffalo. The White House 
said it was the largest crowd to greet Clinton since the 
presidential campaign of 1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has made several public appearances since he was  
impeached on Dec. 19, but all were before smaller and more 
exclusive audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting financial upheaval in other parts of the world, Clinton  
said a tax cut right now could hurt efforts to sustain surpluses. 
Avoiding debt now, he said, means ``you would be somewhat more 
protected.'' The Republicans are calling for a 10 percent tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he believes Congress ultimately will see his side  
after healthy debate and negotiation involving not only lawmakers 
and the White House but the American people as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask you to talk to your friends and neighbors about it,''  
Clinton told the crowd. ``When people come out and disagree with my 
approach, listen to them, sit down and have a discussion about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd fell quiet as Clinton spoke, offering only sporadic  
cheers as he rattled off his agenda. At one point, Clinton 
apologized for his tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry if I made the atmosphere too serious. We've had a  
lot of fun today,'' he said. ``But I want you to think about 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yolanda Reed Hunt, a missionary with the Seventh-day Adventist  
Church, pushed forward to the barricade to shake the president's 
hand. 
</P>
<P>
	She said she was impressed with his sincerity and his desire  
``to help all people,'' and the issue of his private life shouldn't 
bear upon his public position. ``That's between him and God,'' she 
said. ``He's doing a great job for the country and that's what they 
should be worried about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bruce Beyer, a stagehand union member, said he was surprised  
that the president didn't raise the impeachment issue. ``I think 
he's got to take the Republicans head-on,'' he said. His fellow 
union member, Lucy Orlando, was too exited to talk. ``I just shook 
his hand,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president, the vice president and their wives lingered along  
the rope line greeting well-wishers. At one point, Clinton leapt up 
to slap hands with a little girl who was straining through the bars 
to greet him. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's travels were in keeping with Clinton's efforts to  
focus on the nation's business despite his impeachment trial in the 
Senate and underscored his intention to pursue what aides called an 
``activist agenda'' midway through his second term in office. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton's lawyers were set to renew their defense of the  
president in the impeachment proceedings, first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton heaped praise on her husband's record. The Rev. Bennett W. 
Smith offered an invocation ``in full support'' of Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Precious Master, comfort our president with your holy word,''  
he prayed, ``that no weapon formed against you shall prosper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore underscored the uphill battle Clinton's  
proposals face in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last night was a turning point for our country,'' Gore said,  
raising his voice. ``Are you going to fight for his agenda? That's 
what it's going to take!'' The crowd responded enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and his wife, Tipper, and Mrs. Clinton were accompanying  
Clinton later in the day to a Norristown, Pa., high school rally. 
Meanwhile, members of Clinton's Cabinet were traveling on their own 
to highlight the president's initiatives.

<HEADLINE> Machines Now Reading Half of Mail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Machines are now reading and sorting as many  
as half of all handwritten addresses, the post office reports. 
</P>
<P>
	High-speed sorting machines read 50 percent of the estimated 3  
billion handwritten addresses on cards and letters sent during the 
holiday season, postal officials said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We doubled the amount of handwritten mail that is  
electronically sorted using postal automation in less than one 
year,'' said William Dowling, U.S. Postal Service vice president 
for engineering. 
</P>
<P>
	Sorting out the many individual styles of handwriting has been a  
job for human eyes since the time of Benjamin Franklin. 
</P>
<P>
	``Today's postal computers have been taught to read handwriting  
using sophisticated software and hardware,'' said Dowling. 
</P>
<P>
	Automation sorts letters at a rate of $5 per thousand while  
manual sorting costs $45 per thousand. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our next goal is to increase the amount of computer-sorted  
handwritten mail to more than 70 percent in 2000,'' he said. Mail 
volume is expected to reach 210 billion pieces by the end of 2002, 
of which 17 percent will still be hand-addressed or poorly printed. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently sorting machines that can read handwriting are in use  
at 211 sorting centers across the country and eventually will be 
used in 250 centers, officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	They admitted, however, that there will always be some  
handwriting that no machine can read.

<HEADLINE> Jones Settlement Check Not Cashed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LITTLE ROCK, Ark. (AP) -- Lawyers for Paula Jones suggested  
Wednesday that a federal judge hold onto the $850,000 from the 
settlement with President Clinton until she rules how the money 
should be divided. 
</P>
<P>
	The check, made out to Mrs. Jones and her past and present  
lawyers, has yet to be cashed because of a disagreement over the 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas firm of Radar, Campbell, Fisher and Pyke -- Mrs.  
Jones's most recent lawyers -- say her original lawyers, Joseph 
Cammarata and Gilbert Davis, should get none of the money because 
they abandoned the case. Cammarata and Davis say they are owed 
$875,000. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dallas lawyers filed papers Wednesday asking Judge Susan  
Webber Wright to order all parties to endorse the check. Then, they 
suggested, the court should deposit the check in an 
interest-bearing account until the issue is settled.

<HEADLINE> Books &AMP; Authors: Yaffa Eliach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Standing on the grass-covered mass graves in the  
Lithuanian town of Eishyshok, Yaffa Eliach heard the voices of the 
dead buried beneath her feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Her grandmothers, aunts, cousins, friends and neighbors -- who  
were among 3,500 people murdered in this small town by the Nazis 
during two days in September 1941 -- were asking her to remember 
them ``not as a heap of skulls,'' she said, ``but as the vibrant, 
dynamic people I had known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Since that experience two decades ago, Mrs. Eliach has brought  
them back to life in ``There Once Was A World: A 900-Year Chronicle 
of the Shtetl of Eishyshok,'' (Little Brown &AMP; Co., 960 pages, $40)a 
comprehensive account of the life and death of the town and its 
people. 
</P>
<P>
	The book, named a National Book Award finalist before it was  
published in October, is a follow-up to Mrs. Eliach's ``Tower of 
Life'' exhibit at the U.S. Holocaust Museum in Washington. That 
exhibit features 1,500 photographs of the town's residents in 
everyday settings. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were a creative people. We were a demonstrative people. We  
were a normal people,'' she said during a recent interview at a 
Manhattan bookstore. ``That's what this book says about us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Wrapping history, personal accounts and her own memories  
together in a rich, narrative writing style, Mrs. Eliach brings 
alive centuries of weddings, business deals and other parts of 
daily life in Eishyshok. But it is the last few chapters, which 
deal partly with her memories, that are the most moving and, 
perhaps, the most controversial. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing in the third person, Mrs. Eliach, 61, recounts the final  
days of the shtetl. She was 4 when the Nazis invaded Eishyshok and 
massacred its people. She survived the purge -- one of only 36 to do 
so -- by hiding in caves with her family, then returned to the 
village after the war and witnessed the murder of her mother and 
baby brother by partisans in the Polish Home Army. 
</P>
<P>
	Soon after, her father was arrested and thrown in a Russian jail  
on what she says were trumped-up theft charges made by the men 
responsible for her mother's murder. She emigrated to Israel, then 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	A professor of Judaic studies at Brooklyn College, Mrs. Eliach  
says her childhood memories inspired her book but did not 
overshadow her historical research. ``My memories are not what 
wrote the book,'' she says. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics, however, have said those memories create an unfair  
history of Eishyshok. 
</P>
<P>
	John Radzilowski, president of the Polish American Cultural  
Institute of Minnesota and professor of Eastern European history, 
said Mrs. Eliach's verdict on the Polish resistance fighters, many 
of whom she portrays as violently anti-Semitic, is false, skewed by 
her personal experience. 
</P>
<P>
	``Even though the Germans killed most of the town, the Poles get  
most of the blame in the book,'' he said. ``Like in every group, 
there were a few bad apples. But she makes it out to be all 
Poles.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Jewish publication Forward criticized the book on the same  
grounds, saying Mrs. Eliach focused too much on bad elements in the 
Polish resistance in her closing chapters. 
</P>
<P>
	She shrugs off the criticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some people feel that everybody who lived through the  
Holocaust suffers a trauma,'' she said. ``I must say I do not. I 
approached this as a professor of history ... I don't care what's 
socially correct. I don't care what's politically correct. I only 
care about what is historically correct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The book is based, Mrs. Eliach says, on thousands of yellow  
legal pads, cassette tapes, pictures, and photocopied documents 
stored in 800 gray cardboard boxes that take up five rooms in her 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	She came up with the idea for the book during a trip to Warsaw  
as a member of President Carter's U.S. Holocaust Commission in 
1979. The commission was charged with recommending exhibits for the 
U.S. Holocaust Museum then being proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	When commission members suggested displaying prison clothing,  
Star of David patches, a cattle car used to transport Jews to 
concentration camps, and other Holocaust memorabilia, Mrs. Eliach 
thought there was too much focus on death. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were speaking about death and death and death. They were  
focusing on the victimization ... not who the victims were,'' said 
Mrs. Eliach. 
</P>
<P>
	She decided to write about the people in her town, and for the  
next 17 years the project consumed her life, finances and, to some 
extent, defined her relationship with her family: husband David, 
their two children and nine grandchildren. Unable at first to sell 
colleagues on the idea, she used her own money, borrowed against 
life insurance policies and ran up credit card bills to make 
research trips from her Brooklyn home to Belarus, Lithuania and 
Poland. 
</P>
<P>
	``Every penny, every moment was an investment in my research,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	It wasn't until she was awarded a Guggenheim grant in 1987 that  
the book felt real. 
</P>
<P>
	In Eastern Europe, Mrs. Eliach often walked from town to town  
searching for survivors, scouring cemeteries and cajoling 
suspicious residents into giving her information. She sometimes 
missed her children's school and sporting events, but always had 
their support. 
</P>
<P>
	``They'd climb into my lap and ask me to tell them stories,''  
she said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the years, chance encounters helped acquaint Mrs. Eliach  
with centuries of Eishyshok's residents. She met one woman, for 
example, who tended a cemetery before it was destroyed during World 
War II and who could remember every name and date on every 
tombstone. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	Excerpts from ``There Once Was A World: The 900-Year Chronicle  
of the Shtetl of Eishyshok'': 
</P>
<P>
	History: ``As one of the oldest Jewish communities in Lithuania,  
Eishyshok has a history that encompasses much of the drama and 
vitality, the triumph and tragedy, of nine centuries worth of 
Jewish settlements throughout Eastern Europe. Indeed, its history 
can be seen as a paradigm for that of hundreds and even thousands 
of small Jewish towns in Lithuania and beyond ...'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	Setting: ``Eishyshok is part of a landscape of gentle rolling  
hills and thick, deep, quiet forests. Its rivers flow peacefully, 
its lakes and marshes are still. But its mild, tranquil scenery is 
in sharp contrast to the natural disasters and devastating plagues 
that have afflicted it, and the violent wars that have been fought 
there during the long course of its lifetime -- wars waged in the 
name of land, of faith, of riches, of ideology, of nationality, and 
of sheer ethnic hatred.'' 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------

<P>
	Massacre: ``Friday at sundown, after having been kept alive in  
order to witness wave after wave of death at the killing fields, 
after having been forced to watch the murder of thousands of people 
from his beloved flock, the rabbi himself was finally killed. 
According to some eyewitness accounts, he was shot; according to 
others, a machine gun was fired over his head and he was then 
buried alive. ... The German document ... reports that on September 
27, 1941, 989 Jewish men, 1,636 Jewish women and 821 Jewish 
children from Eishyshok were killed.''

<HEADLINE> Court OKs Suits Against Insurers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- People sometimes may use a federal  
anti-racketeering law to sue their health insurer for alleged 
fraud, the Supreme Court said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The court's unanimous ruling let customers of Humana Health  
Insurance of Nevada pursue a class-action lawsuit that claims the 
insurance company got secret discounts it did not share with them. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit was filed under the federal Racketeering Influenced  
and Corrupt Organizations Act, known as RICO, which allows private 
lawsuits to collect triple damages for fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana sought dismissal of the lawsuit, citing another federal  
law that seeks to preserve states' primary role in regulating 
insurance companies. The McCarran-Ferguson Act says federal laws 
cannot be used to ``impair or supersede'' a state insurance law 
unless the federal law specifically involves insurance. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the court, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg said suing  
under RICO would not impair Nevada's own insurance laws but 
appeared to complement the remedies available under state law. 
</P>
<P>
	``We see no frustration of state policy in the RICO litigation  
at issue here,'' Ginsburg wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1989 lawsuit involving about 84,000 Humana insurance  
customers says the company in 1985 started shifting costs to 
customers who bought insurance policies in which Humana paid 80 
percent of a patient's expenses and the patient paid the rest. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit says Humana negotiated secret discounts with Humana  
Hospital Sunrise in Las Vegas, in which the entire discount was 
applied to the insurance company's share of the bill. The customers 
said they wound up paying much more than 20 percent of the actual 
cost. 
</P>
<P>
	Humana no longer owns the hospitals, which were acquired by  
Columbia-HCA. 
</P>
<P>
	A federal trial judge ruled that the customers could not sue  
under RICO because that law did not specifically involve insurance. 
Allowing customers to seek RICO's higher penalties would impair 
Nevada law, the judge said. 
</P>
<P>
	The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals reversed, saying the  
differing penalties did not create a conflict between the federal 
and state laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court upheld the 9th Circuit court.  
</P>
<P>
	Ginsburg cautioned that today's ruling does not provide ``a  
green light for federal regulation whenever the federal law does 
not collide head on with state regulation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, she said a federal law can be applied when it does not  
directly conflict with state insurance regulations and when relying 
on the federal law would not frustrate any state insurance policy. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Humana Inc. vs. Forsyth, 97-303.

<HEADLINE> Weyerhaeuser Profit Down 69 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- Low prices for wood products are  
hurting Weyerhaeuser Co., which reported Wednesday that profits for 
the fourth quarter were down 69 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyerhaeuser had net earnings of $30 million or 15 cents a  
diluted share for the quarter ended Dec. 27, compared with profits 
of $98 million or 49 cents a share a year earlier. Revenues were 
$2.75 billion, down from $2.87 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The most recent net earnings include a one-time charge of $45  
million, primarily for streamlining pulp and paper operations and 
closing a chemical plant in Longview. In fourth-quarter 1997, 
Weyerhaeuser took a $10 million charge. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a difficult year for Weyerhaeuser and our industry,''  
said Steven R. Rogel, president and chief executive officer. ``Most 
of our markets experienced very difficult pricing conditions, 
especially pulp and paper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A soft export market weakened prices for both export and  
domestic logs, while lower prices for lumber offset the higher 
demand from domestic housing starts. Prices for most grades of pulp 
and paper were below 1997 levels. 
</P>
<P>
	Weyerhaeuser also took a $42 million pre-tax charge last year  
for efforts to fix problems due to the Year 2000 computer bug, with 
$26 million occurring during the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's stock closed up 50 cents at $56 in trading on the  
New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, net earnings were $294 million or $1.48 a diluted  
share, down from $342 million or $1.72 a share in 1997. Net sales 
dropped to $10.77 billion from $11.21 billion.

<HEADLINE> GM Subsidiaries See Mixed Results </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- Delphi Automotive Systems, the big parts-making  
subsidiary of General Motors Corp., reported Wednesday that its 
fourth-quarter earnings declined 20 percent because of the economic 
downturn in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's financial subsidiary, General Motors Acceptance Corp., and  
its Hughes Electronics Corp. unit each posted improved earnings for 
the quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Delphi earned $280 million, compared with $349 million in the  
fourth quarter of 1997. For all of 1998, Delphi earned $370 
million, down 67 percent from the $1.2 billion earned in 1997. All 
the figures were adjusted for charges related to last year's 
strikes and other one-time items. 
</P>
<P>
	``Continuing worldwide price pressures were offset by Delphi's  
aggressive cost-reduction efforts, particularly in the areas of 
manufacturing, material and engineering,'' Chairman J. T. 
Battenberg III said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM plans to sell about 18 percent of Delphi in an initial public  
stock offering later this quarter, and spin off the rest to GM 
shareholders by year's end. Analysts said the lower earnings were 
expected and should not affect the IPO. 
</P>
<P>
	GMAC reported a $298 million profit for the fourth quarter, up 7  
percent from $279 million a year ago. For the year, GMAC earned 
$1.33 billion, up 2 percent from the $1.30 billion earned in 1997 
and its highest annual profit since 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	Hughes Electronics Corp. earned $119 million, up 70 percent from  
the $70 million it earned in the fourth quarter of 1997. For the 
year, Hughes earned $272 million, up from $153 million in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	GM said the growth in DirectTV subscriptions and sales of  
commercial satellites helped boost fourth-quarter earnings.

<HEADLINE> Dallas NAACP Chapter in Turmoil </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Brenda Fields gets an adrenaline rush when she  
recalls the old days: marching in front of all-white lunch 
counters, protesting outside the Majestic Theatre and lining up at 
the Texas State Fair ticket booth only to be turned away. 
</P>
<P>
	The 55-year-old Dallas resident said she can hardly imagine life  
without the National Association for the Advancement of Colored 
People, of which she is a lifetime member. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, however, she is disheartened by discord within the Dallas  
chapter. 
</P>
<P>
	Since last fall, incumbent chapter president Lee Alcorn's  
candidacy has been challenged, and three executive committee 
members have been suspended by the national office, leading to a 
lawsuit against the NAACP and President Kweisi Mfume. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think what has brought about some of the this turmoil is  
that under the leadership of Mr. Alcorn the branch has really taken 
aggressive action to try to eradicate some of the racism in 
Dallas,'' Ms. Fields said. ``And so doing, it has really rattled 
some cages of what I would call the white corporate structure in 
Dallas. 
</P>
<P>
	``I really believe that some of that pressure from the white  
corporate structure has been placed on the national office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The turmoil began in November.  
</P>
<P>
	Presidential challenger Dwaine Caraway filed a complaint against  
Alcorn, arguing the two-term incumbent was ineligible to seek 
office in Dallas because he lived in a suburb and did not work in 
the city. 
</P>
<P>
	The national office in Baltimore investigated and sided with  
Alcorn. 
</P>
<P>
	After Alcorn and about two dozen other officers and committee  
members were elected in December, Caraway filed another complaint 
questioning whether the election was run properly. Specific 
allegations were not made public. 
</P>
<P>
	The NAACP's national office ordered the branch to delay  
installing the officers until election results were certified. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, the officers -- with the exception of Alcorn -- were  
installed Jan. 5. The next day, Mfume suspended Alcorn and 
executive committee members John Wiley Price and Ronald Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	``These are the things that cause some people to believe there  
is a conspiracy against this chapter,'' Alcorn said. 
</P>
<P>
	Added Price, a Dallas County commissioner: ``I think there are  
some people in this community that would conspire with national to 
muzzle us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The national office has taken a similar position before.  
</P>
<P>
	Elections were postponed in two Maryland branches because of  
disputes over eligibility. The national office in December also 
suspended all officers of the Asheville, N.C., branch for 
noncompliance with state and national mandates. 
</P>
<P>
	Mfume said the Texas suspensions were strictly procedural.  
</P>
<P>
	``There are clear directives that branches whose elections are  
challenged must follow,'' he said. ``Branches cannot operate 
outside of these rules.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Price and Davis have sued the national office, the local chapter  
and Mfume. Earlier this month, a state district judge issued a 
temporary restraining order, allowing the suspended officers to 
take their seats until a hearing on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Courtland Hayes, general counsel for the national office,  
said he's confident the court will side with his office. 
</P>
<P>
	Glen Linden, a history professor at Southern Methodist  
University, said the problems within the Dallas branch and its 
clash with the national office may be rooted in blacks' 
disagreement about the direction they want to take their fight for 
civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a kind of energy and anger that fuels Lee  
Alcorn,'' he said. ``I think what's happening now is internal 
problems as to whether or not to go along with Lee Alcorn and his 
aggressive style. It's a '60s style in the '90s.''

<HEADLINE> Doctors: Yeltsin Won't Need Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Doctors decided today that President Boris  
Yeltsin, hospitalized for a bleeding ulcer, won't need an 
operation, the Kremlin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Yeltsin received a ``controlled gastroscopy'' this morning, in  
which a fiber-optic thread with a tiny camera passed through his 
mouth into his stomach, allowing doctors to examine the ulcer. 
</P>
<P>
	Presidential spokesman Dmitry Yakushkin said the exam showed  
Yeltsin's ulcer had ``stopped bleeding, the inflammation and 
swelling of tissue stopped and initial signs of healing appeared,'' 
Russian news agencies said. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors will continue treating him with medicine, the  
presidential press service announced. 
</P>
<P>
	Yakushkin said the president's condition was stable, and that he  
had begun working while in the hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting today, doctors allowed Yeltsin to get out of bed to  
walk around his room and work at a table, Yakushkin said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, chief presidential doctor Sergei Mironov said Yeltsin  
would need up to three weeks in the hospital, and would not be 
allowed to travel for up to three months. 
</P>
<P>
	The Interfax news agency quoted unidentified medical experts as  
saying Yeltsin's treatment could take up to six weeks, including a 
recovery period in a sanitarium.

<HEADLINE>  A Fifth Inquiry for Olympic Scandal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- The bribery scandal surrounding the 2002  
Winter Olympics has prompted a fifth investigation -- this one by 
the Utah Attorney General. 
</P>
<P>
	Jan Graham, the state's attorney general, said Wednesday her  
inquiry will not begin until the Salt Lake Organizing Committee's 
ethics panel and the International Olympic Committee release their 
reports. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Olympic Committee and the Justice Department also are  
investigating. Justice officials met with at least one potential 
witness Wednesday and empaneled a grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham said her office will not ``duplicate the work of the  
federal investigation,'' and instead will examine potential 
violations of Utah criminal laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our work will be done carefully, but as quickly and  
professionally as possible so that questions surrounding potential 
criminal conduct do not linger,'' Graham said. ``Those questions 
need to be answered with confidence and finality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The attorney general's office will use its own staff  
investigators, but Graham said they would rely heavily on the 
information uncovered in the SLOC report and in the Justice 
Department probe, which will likely take months to complete. 
</P>
<P>
	The SLOC ethics committee's findings are expected to be released  
before Feb. 11, though no exact date has been mandated, SLOC 
spokesperson Frank Zang said. Graham said her office's 
investigation ``will not be very active'' before the report is 
released. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham is the only Democrat elected to statewide office in Utah.  
She has frequently locked horns with Republican governor Mike 
Leavitt, an ardent supporter of the state's Olympic efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	Attorney general spokesman Palmer DePaulis said the governor's  
office didn't learn of the new probe until it was announced. 
Spokespersons at SLOC and in Leavitt's office hadn't yet learned of 
the investigation when contacted for comment by The Associated 
Press. 
</P>
<P>
	Leavitt's spokeswoman, Vicki Varela, declined to comment late  
Wednesday, saying it was the attorney general's decision to 
investigate. 
</P>
<P>
	DePaulis said his boss's decision to launch an investigation  
should not surprise anyone, least of all Leavitt. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a reasonable expectation by the people of Utah that we  
would review the findings of the other investigations,'' DePaulis 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	State Rep. Jordan Tanner, R-Provo, has been an advocate of more  
state oversight of the Olympic bid and is sponsoring a bill that 
would allow the state to examine SLOC's books. He applauded 
Graham's announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	``If criminal laws of Utah look like they have been broken, I  
think it is an appropriate responsibility of the attorney general 
to look into it,'' Tanner said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government's investigation continued Wednesday.  
Stephanie Pate, the onetime secretary of former bid committee head 
Tom Welch, met with two Justice Department lawyers and an FBI agent 
for several hours, said her lawyer, David Watkiss. 
</P>
<P>
	Though unable to answer specific questions about the federal  
officials' lines of questioning, Watkiss intimated that Pate was 
asked about many bid committee activities in which she was never 
involved. 
</P>
<P>
	``She answered their questions to the best of her ability,''  
Watkiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Max Wheeler, attorney for former SLOC senior vice president Dave  
Johnson, said Wednesday his client had not yet received a federal 
subpoena. Wheeler and Johnson were also waiting for the results of 
SLOC's ethics investigation before deciding on their next move. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson and SLOC president Frank Joklik, the top two officials  
in the Salt Lake Olympic effort, resigned Jan. 8. Joklik admitted 
the Salt Lake bid committee's work had been tainted by unscrupulous 
activities, including the giving of lavish gifts, cash, 
scholarships and free medical care to IOC members who awarded the 
city the games in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheeler maintained his client did nothing wrong.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's been segregated out of all this as the  
instigator, and that's not the case,'' Wheeler said. ``We're trying 
to fend off the blows that are coming his way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The USOC inquiry, primarily intended to recommend new guidelines  
for American cities bidding for future Olympics, will be finished 
before March, said the investigation's leader, former Senate 
Majority Leader George Mitchell. 
</P>
<P>
	``There has been a series of revelations almost on a daily  
basis,'' Mitchell told the Deseret News. ``And we are doing the 
best we can to follow every lead to clarify every fact and, if 
possible, to investigate every allegation.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC report is scheduled to be released Sunday. IOC Vice  
President Richard Pound and IOC director general Francois Carrard 
met with IOC lawyers in New York Wednesday to finalize the report.

<HEADLINE>  Lawmakers Offer Steel Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers from steel-producing states offered  
legislation today to help a struggling steel industry combat the 
rising tide of cheap steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came as thousands of steelworkers held a rally  
at the Capitol and planned a march to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``This surge of imports in steel has been devastating and  
unfair,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate 
Steel Caucus. The legislation ``will improve the posture of 
industry and improve the standing of the workers themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steel imports reached record levels in 1998 and has been blamed  
for at least 10,000 layoffs and bankruptcies at some domestic steel 
companies. U.S. steel producers and steelworkers say they cannot 
compete with foreign steel that they say is entering the nation at 
prices dramatically below production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can work for zero wages and they still can't compete  
against foreign steel at the prices they are coming in,'' said 
George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a thousand steelworkers blared horns and held signs  
urging policy makers to ``Stand Up for Steel'' outside the Capitol. 
Inside, the Senate prepared for another day of the impeachment 
trial against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the steel industry has many allies among Democrats and  
Republicans from steel-producing states, passing legislation would 
not be easy because Republicans from other states tend to oppose 
measures viewed as harming free trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation offered by Specter and Sen. Jay Rockefeller,  
D-W.Va., would lower standards for proving injury in trade 
disputes, making it easier for the industry to obtain quotas and 
broad tariffs against foreign steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also would set up an import permitting and  
monitoring program so that the industry could prove injury earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, proposed a separate measure to give  
the steel industry a share of any duties collected from foreign 
steel. Those levies now go to the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen steel producers and two unions already have filed trade  
complaints against Japan, Russia and Brazil, seeking the imposition 
of duties. A ruling is not expected by the summer, so the industry 
has pressed the Clinton administration to take more immediate 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton earlier this month offered $300 million in tax  
breaks for the steel industry, a gesture that many producers 
denounced because it would first require them to post losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, who heads the House steel caucus,  
said he hoped today's rally would put a ``human face'' on the 
crisis and persuade both Congress and Clinton to act.

<HEADLINE> Dropping Race in Cancer Study Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Essential research into why some minorities  
are more prone to cancer can be successfully pursued without 
classifying people into four broad racial categories, the Institute 
of Medicine said today. 
</P>
<P>
	A report from the institute, which advises the government on  
health issues, urged scientists to abandon the traditional racial 
categories because they are ``of limited utility for the purpose of 
health research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the report urged scientists to study cancer rates among  
``special populations'' to more accurately measure the impact of 
such things as ``cultural and behavioral factors, beliefs, 
lifestyle patterns, diet, environmental living conditions and other 
factors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report, nevertheless, calls on the National Institutes of  
Health to increase its efforts to determine why some minorities are 
more prone to develop and die from certain types of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the population becoming increasingly diverse, it is  
critical that we learn why some ethnic minorities and the medically 
underserved are more prone to cancer and less likely to survive 
it,'' said M. Alfred Haynes, chairman of the committee that 
prepared the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Cancer research traditionally has used four racial  
classifications: white, black, Asian or Pacific Islander and 
American Indian or Alaska Native. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, black men have unusually high rates of prostate  
cancer, Asians are more likely to develop stomach and liver cancer 
than whites are, cervical cancer is higher among Hispanic and 
Vietnamese-American women and Alaska natives have high rates of 
colon and rectal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	These classifications, the committee said, ``are of limited  
utility for purposes of health research because the concept of race 
rests on the unfounded assumptions that there are fundamental 
biological differences among racial groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For example, the current Asian and Pacific Islander category  
includes a wide spectrum of people such as Southeast Asians, 
Koreans, Japanese, Chinese and Indians. Grouping them together 
makes it difficult to pinpoint health problems particular to one or 
the other, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	Collecting data on smaller, more specific, ethnic or regional  
groups would also allow researchers to sort out such things as 
differences between blacks living in large cities and those in 
rural Southern communities. 
</P>
<P>
	The broad categories also hinder attempts to measure cancer  
rates among Hispanics of different national origins, among the 
various American Indian populations and among rural poverty-level 
whites such as those living in Appalachia, the report said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this respect the diversity of the U.S. population offers an  
excellent opportunity to clarify issues relating to prevention and 
control,'' the report adds. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Institutes of Health funded the study by the  
Institute of Medicine, an affiliate of the National Academy of 
Sciences.

<HEADLINE> Browns Give Palmer Second Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Chris Palmer spent the day with Browns  
executives in owner Al Lerner's office, dined with the group 
Wednesday night and appears likely to become the expansion team's 
coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, the offensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars,  
met with Browns president Carmen Policy, football operations 
director Dwight Clark and Lerner into the evening at Lerner's 
office in suburban Beachwood. 
</P>
<P>
	At one point in the afternoon the group waved to reporters, but  
gave no indication that a deal had been finalized. Later, after 
dinner with Palmer, Policy told The Associated Press that details 
still needed to be worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not yet. Not yet,'' Policy said when asked if he had a deal.  
``We're meeting at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Was he confident the deal would be completed?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm reasonably optimistic that things are rolling in a  
positive direction, and it appears things could turn out very 
well,'' he said. ``I think there's a strong possibility it could 
happen tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Without citing sources, WOIO-TV reported that Palmer would be  
named the Browns coach on Thursday and will get a five-year 
contract worth $8-12 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Team spokesman Alex Martins said he did not know if the parties  
had reached an agreement, and that negotiations were continuing. 
The team has not yet scheduled a news conference or planned any 
announcements. 
</P>
<P>
	The Browns brought in Palmer for a second interview so he could  
talk with Lerner and Clark, who were both out of town last week 
when Palmer visited Policy at the team's headquarters in Berea. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, 49, is the only coach to get a second formal interview  
with the Browns, who are running out of time and quality coaching 
candidates to choose from with just seven months left to build a 
team from scratch. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Policy had said that no coach would be hired by the  
Browns ``without meeting with and having a pretty good serious 
sitdown with Al Lerner.'' Lerner, a local billionaire banker, 
bought the Browns last summer for $530 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With the expansion draft less than three weeks away, the Browns  
realize they need to end their scrambled coaching search. Policy 
had hoped to hire Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian Billick but 
dropped him as a candidate on Monday when Billick decided to follow 
through with a job interview with the Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick signed a six-year, $9 million contract with the Ravens  
on Tuesday, leaving the Browns with three coaches they had 
interviewed to choose from: Palmer, Atlanta offensive line coach 
Art Shell and Oakland defensive coordinator Willie Shaw. 
</P>
<P>
	Denver offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak had removed himself  
from consideration with the Browns on Monday when he said he would 
be staying with the Broncos beyond the Super Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	After his interview with Shaw on Tuesday, Policy said the  
Browns' coaching search would ``go off the radar screen'' and that 
the search could widen to include college coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is very little time,'' he said. ``And some of the people  
we'll be talking to may wish to have total anonymity. We'd like to 
keep everything under wraps until we're ready to announce who the 
head coach is.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That could soon be Palmer, who in his first interview had  
shocked Policy with his thoroughness and an engaging personality 
that Policy said he hadn't expected. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer was in Mobile, Ala., on Tuesday preparing for Saturday's  
Senior Bowl when Policy called. He had been scheduled to interview 
with the Kansas City Chiefs about their coaching vacancy this week, 
but after hearing from Cleveland, Palmer flew back to Jacksonville 
to grab a suit for his interview with the Browns.

<HEADLINE> Bush Dodges Impeachment Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Six years after handing over authority to Bill  
Clinton, former President George Bush returned to the Capitol to 
tell an audience of senators he regrets ``a deficit of decency'' in 
recent years -- although he said he had no impeachment-trial advice 
for them. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush declined an opportunity to discuss Clinton's ongoing trial  
in the Senate, although he told reporters, ``I have to admit, the 
timing is a little peculiar'' regarding his own appearance. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Republican president was back in town to attend a  
Senate lecture series sponsored by Senate Majority Leader Trent 
Lott, R-Miss. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my chance to serve. And I did my best. I messed up some  
things and, hopefully, got some things right,'' Bush, 74, said. He 
spoke in the Old Senate Chamber, used in the 1800s, and just down 
the hall from the current chamber where the impeachment trial is 
taking place. 
</P>
<P>
	Although he has been back a few times since leaving office, Bush  
said that for the most part he has tried to stay away from 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``But that does not mean I lack interest in events here,'' he  
said. ``I have refrained from commenting on the serious matter now 
before the Senate -- and will continue to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As a former president, he did not want to put outside pressure  
on the Senate -- and felt that it was better for the Senate to chart 
its own course, Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he added, ``I confess that the lack of civility in our  
political debate and official dealings with one another concerns 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``All in all, it seems to me that, whereas the problems looming  
over this town dealt more with budget deficits in times past, today 
we are confronted with a deficit of decency -- one that deepens by 
the day.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he regretted ``the bitter rancor that has divided us as  
people in recent times.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry, too, about sleaze -- about excessive intrusion into  
private lives.'' He complained about ``tabloid journalism -- giving 
us sensationalism at best, smut at worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush called it ``a very traumatic time, a very busy time'' for  
the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks, he told his audience of senators and invited  
guests, many of whom served in his administration, that the most 
important Senate vote of his presidency was the 52-47 vote in 
January 1991 authorizing use of force in the Persian Gulf to drive 
Iraqi forces out of Kuwait. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, so contentious was the issue at the time that some  
critics even discussed attempting to impeach him if he went to war 
without first obtaining congressional support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We honored Congress' right to be heard before a single shot  
had been fired,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	His audience included Colin Powell, who was chairman of the  
Joint Chiefs of Staff during the Gulf War. Bush said he regretted 
being unable to muster a wider margin in support of the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we stayed the course, and I hope history will say not only  
that we won, but that we won with honor,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said that in the days he presided over the Senate as vice  
president, ``I loved interacting with senators of both parties.'' 
Bush never served in the Senate, losing Senate races in 1964 and 
1970. But he served in the House, and as ambassador to the United 
Nations, CIA director and chairman of the Republican National 
Committee. He was Ronald Reagan's vice president for all eight 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott noted that Bush's address came on the 10th anniversary of  
his being sworn in as the nation's 41st president. Playfully, Bush 
reminded Lott that it was also ``six years ago to this very day 
that I was sworn out of office.''

<HEADLINE> Pitcher Bob Tewksbury Retires </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CONCORD, N.H. (AP) -- Pitcher Bob Tewksbury tearfully announced  
his retirement Wednesday, ending a 13-year major league career to 
spend more time with his family. 
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old right-hander said he had an offer to play in  
Montreal this year but decided he was losing the edge necessary to 
play. 
</P>
<P>
	``My desire to be with my family was greater than my desire to  
play baseball,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tewksbury said injuries the last two seasons while playing for  
the Minnesota Twins also helped in his decision. He was 7-13 in 26 
games last year, and spent time on the disabled list because of 
tendinitis. 
</P>
<P>
	Tewksbury was 110-102 in 13 seasons with the New York Yankees,  
Chicago Cubs, St. Louis Cardinals, Texas Rangers, San Diego Padres 
and Minnesota. 
</P>
<P>
	He had his best seasons with the Cardinals in the early 1990s,  
going 16-5 with in 1992 and 17-10 in 1993. He also appeared in the 
All-Star game in 1992.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Court Case Has Weaknesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is focusing part of this week  
on what is widely seen as the weakest link in its antitrust case 
against Microsoft: the company's decision to build Internet browser 
software into its popular Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	But its questioning of Richard Schmalensee of the Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology largely broke down over semantics Tuesday, 
as both sides argued over the meaning of ``browser,'' the software 
that lets people view information on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The government charges that Microsoft Corp. illegally ``tied''  
separate products by distributing its browser free within Windows, 
a move that dramatically changed the industry but was partially 
vindicated last year by a federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	When precisely Microsoft made that decision was the issue the  
government tried to highlight Tuesday. The government maintains 
that the decision was made after June 1995 to try to ``crush'' 
Netscape, whose own rival Internet software once earned tens of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft maintains that its browser isn't a separate product  
from newer versions of Windows and therefore can't be subject to 
antitrust ``tying'' claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Microsoft's plans for its browser, Schmalensee  
described the company's decision to build ``browser functionality'' 
into Windows, a catchall phrase that can include the software 
underpinnings used by many third-party Windows communications 
programs, including Netscape's browser. 
</P>
<P>
	The distinction is important. The government has argued a  
difference between support for browsers under Windows and the free 
distribution of such products. 
</P>
<P>
	In a February 1998 e-mail made public last week, Microsoft  
executive Nathan Myhrvold cautioned about using precise language 
for a poll the company was conducting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The name 'browser' suggests a separate thing,'' Myhrvold  
wrote. ``... Instead you need to ask a more neutral question about 
how Internet technology needs to merge with local computing. I have 
been pretty successful in trying this on various journalists and 
industry people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies asked Schmalensee Tuesday  
whether any internal Microsoft document about the Internet ever 
included the words ``browser functionality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever see one before 1998, sir?'' Boies asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't done an exhaustive survey of the language,''  
Schmalensee answered. ``Certainly by early 1995, the decision had 
been made ... that the browser would be part of Windows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee also acknowledged that the earliest versions of  
Windows 95 didn't include Microsoft's browser, which was sold 
separately but added into Windows later. 
</P>
<P>
	The government claimed that was further evidence that Microsoft  
had illegally combined separate products to compete against 
Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``They combined it after the fact, bolted it on after the  
fact,'' Boies said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft frequently cites a June appeals court ruling that  
bundling of its Internet software with Windows 95 was legal and a 
``genuine integration'' because consumers benefited. Legal experts 
have said the appeals court decision largely undermines the 
government's tying claim, which had been filed months earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The antitrust trial had little impact on Microsoft's earnings.  
The company on Tuesday reported a 72 percent increase in 
second-quarter profits. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft had net income of $1.98 billion and diluted earnings  
per share of 73 cents for the quarter ending Dec. 31, up from $1.13 
billion or 42 cents a share a year ago. Revenues for the quarter 
were $4.94 billion, up 38 percent from $3.59 billion a year ago. 
The quarterly profits and revenues were records. 
</P>
<P>
	The antitrust trial -- and other cases Microsoft is fighting --  
has effected the company's general and administrative costs. Greg 
Maffei, Microsoft's chief financial officer, noted that those 
expenses had risen to $149 million from $106 million, ``due, in 
part, to higher legal costs.''

<HEADLINE> Tobacco States, Cigarette Cos. Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Representatives from tobacco states and  
cigarette companies are meeting again to discuss proposed payments 
to tobacco growers hurt financially by a $206 billion settlement of 
tobacco-related health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	But this time the cigarette makers, who believed they had  
settled many of their legal problems, are working under the threat 
of a federal lawsuit over health care costs. President Clinton said 
in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night the Justice 
Department will follow the states' lead and sue cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	The threatened lawsuit didn't go over well in tobacco country  
and it wasn't clear how Clinton's actions would affect discussions 
about the farmers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would devastate our farm families and their communities,  
who have already endured great hardship through drastic quota 
reductions and the impact the tobacco settlement will have on their 
livelihoods,'' North Carolina Gov. Jim Hunt said of Clinton's 
announcement. 
</P>
<P>
	Phil Carlton, the lawyer who represents the four tobacco  
companies involved in the discussions, said today he did not think 
the threat would affect today's discussions. The state leaders and 
tobacco company representatives will talk about a proposed $5.15 
billion trust fund or farmers and distressed tobacco communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Carlton said a federal lawsuit would take too long to resolve.  
He said the companies would fight any suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John Edwards, D-N.C., said his initial impression is that a  
lawsuit to recover Medicare-related smoking costs would bankrupt 
the cigarette makers. But Virginia Gov. Jim Gilmore said of a 
possible suit, ``to be fair, the tobacco companies have always 
known it's a prospect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	North Carolina Attorney General Mike Easley said earlier Tuesday  
he would fight any attempt by the federal government to take part 
of the settlement with the states for federal health care costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's meeting was called to continue, and hopefully resolve,  
discussions between tobacco states and cigarette companies on how 
to help farmers. The master settlement agreement signed last year 
required a second settlement to help farmers and quota holders. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm positive that all four companies are committed to getting  
a program in place for the farmer,'' Easley said. ``They would love 
to walk away this week not having to deal with this again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Governors from six tobacco-producing states issued a statement  
Monday saying a trust fund financed by cigarette companies is ``the 
only viable course of action to ensure the protection of our 
farmers and their future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The statement was issued by Govs. Jim Hunt of North Carolina,  
Paul Patton of Kentucky, Jim Gilmore of Virginia, Jim Hodges of 
South Carolina, Roy Barnes of Georgia and Don Sundquist of 
Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	One company, Philip Morris, already has said it will contribute  
to the trust fund. But the company also said future payments would 
depend on what is done by the other tobacco companies -- R.J. 
Reynolds, Brown &AMP; Williamson and Lorillard. 
</P>
<P>
	Reynolds initially opposed the trust fund, saying a better way  
to help farmers was to promise to buy more American-grown tobacco.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Medals Sought in Drug Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The White House will try to have duplicate  
medals awarded to Olympic athletes known to have lost to 
competitors using illegal drugs, the federal drug czar said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control  
Policy, plans to pursue the matter at next month's world doping 
summit despite the IOC's recent rejection of at least two similar 
pleas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our voice should be listened to,'' he said, noting two-thirds  
of the International Olympic Committee's revenue comes from U.S. 
television networks and corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the IOC turned down requests from the U.S. Olympic  
Committee and the British Olympic Association for duplicate medals 
for swimmers beaten by East Germans in the 1976 and 1980 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent testimony in Germany has shown that the winning East  
German athletes were helped by banned steroids administered as part 
of a secret government program. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said it was impossible to rewrite the record books,  
despite court evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to look at the notion of supplemental medals when it  
can be proved in the courts where medals were lost to chemically 
engineered competition,'' McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said he had asked USOC president Bill Hybl at a White  
House meeting Wednesday to add 1972 Olympic marathon champion Frank 
Shorter to his delegation to the summit in Lausanne, Switzerland, 
Feb. 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Shorter is considering pursuit of a second gold medal from the  
1976 Olympic marathon, where he finished second to East Germany's 
Waldemar Cierpinski. He says evidence from files of the Stasi, the 
East German secret police, show that Cierpinski also was involved 
in the doping program, and that information will eventually wind up 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a related issue to what is really most important, and  
that is trying to help the IOC know what is really going on,'' 
Shorter said by phone from his Colorado home. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his interest in drug issues has been heightened in  
recent years by the success of his 19-year-old son in distance 
running at the University of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do everything I can so he feels it's not necessary  
to resort to illegal drugs to compete and win at a high level,'' 
Shorter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, McCaffrey's office announced an unprecedented $1  
million federal pledge toward research for drug testing in sports. 
He said Wednesday that was a ``down payment'' on future government 
action but denied federal funding would be linked to the medals 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pursuing arguments on an emerging, universal opinion  
that we have to protect the beliefs of 12-year-olds that you don't 
have to use drugs and there will be a level playing field if you 
chose to compete,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey will head a six-member federal delegation to the  
summit, including representatives of the State Department and the 
National Institute for Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to meet with delegations from 10 countries, including  
China, to form a ``common understanding'' before the session.

<HEADLINE> Comcast Sells Cellular Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Comcast Corp., the nation's fourth-largest  
cable television company, is selling its cellular phone operations 
to regional phone company SBC Communications Inc. as it focuses on 
its core cable television and programming businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC, based in San Antonio, is one of the nation's largest  
wireless companies with 6.5 million cellular subscribers in 16 
states and the District of Columbia. 
</P>
<P>
	It is paying $400 million in cash to add 850,000 Comcast  
Metrophone and Cellular One subscribers in southeastern 
Pennsylvania, northeast Maryland and most of New Jersey. In 
addition, SBC will assume Comcast Cellular's current debt of $1.274 
billion, under the deal announced Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal underscores the rapid transformation in the telephone  
industry, where providers of traditional phone service are 
positioning themselves to reap big profits expected from cellular 
phones. 
</P>
<P>
	Stan Sigman, the chief executive of SBC Wireless, said the  
addition of Comcast Cellular leaves SBC in better shape to serve 
its wireless customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Analyst Bob Egan at the Gartner Group in Stamford, Conn., said  
cellular companies must expand their service areas to survive. 
``There is a need for a national footprint. For SBC, this filled in 
a piece of their puzzle,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The smaller, very local, very regional carriers are going to  
struggle,'' said Egan, Gartner Group's research director for 
wireless. ``What we are seeing is clearly the game of musical 
chairs being played by the cellular giants. Twenty-four months out, 
when everybody sits down, there are likely to be only four or five 
national players in the United States.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast Cellular's president, David N. Watson, said in a memo to  
the company's 1,600 employees that it was a positive move to join 
one of the largest and fastest-growing cellular phone providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast battled increasingly tough competition in the cellular  
phone business from major companies that are building national 
networks and can avoid ``roaming'' and other costs that companies 
on Comcast Cellular's scale must charge their customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``You look at the landscape today and find national footprints,  
national players ... so the dynamics have changed dramatically,'' 
Comcast spokesman John Alchin said. He said Comcast will use some 
of the proceeds from the sale to expand its cable and online 
services. 
</P>
<P>
	``This transaction makes strategic sense for both Comcast and  
SBC,'' said Comcast's president, Brian L. Roberts. Pending approval 
by regulators, the sale is expected to close in the third quarter 
of 1999, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to operating and developing cable systems and  
investing in programming, Comcast's cable interests include 
principal ownership of QVC, Comcast-Spectacor and Comcast 
SportsNet, and a controlling interest in E! Entertainment 
Television. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past six months, Comcast has announced that it is  
snapping up Jones Intercable with about 1 million subscribers in 
the Washington, D.C., and Baltimore areas, and Prime Communications 
in Montgomery County and Gaithersburg, Md; Arlington County, Va.; 
and portions of Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	The company bought the Philadelphia Flyers hockey and 76ers  
basketball teams in 1996 to enhance its cable programming. 
</P>
<P>
	``Part of cable is also having content -- the media to deliver it  
and then the actual content,'' said Mark Lowenstein, analyst at the 
Yankee Group in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	With cellular telephone companies becoming national in scale,  
said Lowenstein, Yankee Group's director of wireless practice, ``I 
think Comcast did not see any great opportunity in wireless. I 
think Comcast's share of the market would have diminished.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The sale was timely, said Lowenstein, because with larger  
companies looking for smaller ones to snap up to build national 
networks, ``Wireless properties are trading at a premium right 
now.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There was little reaction to the deal on Wall Street, with  
Comcast shares up 18 3/4 cents at $66.31 1/4 a share on the Nasdaq Stock 
Market and SBC down 50 cents at $58.50 on the New York Stock 
Exchange.

<HEADLINE> Grains, Soybeans Finish Higher / Board of Trade  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Grain and soybean futures prices finished higher  
Wednesday on the Chicago Board of Trade amid forecasts for drier 
weather to return to South American growing regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants who have seen days of heavy losses took  
solace in predictions that a dry weather pattern was likely to move 
into key corn and soybean growing regions in Argentina in Brazil, 
possibly providing a setback to the competing crops. 
</P>
<P>
	Prices also were supported by talk that the Clinton  
administration was considering more donations of foodstuffs to 
beleaguered Russia, a move that could prop cash prices that have 
sank amid ample U.S. supplies and weaker than normal world demand. 
</P>
<P>
	Wheat for March delivery rose 2 cents to $2.70 1/2 a bushel; march  
corn rose 1 1/4 cents to $2.15 a bushel; March oats rose 1 1/4 cents to 
$1.07 a bushel; March soybeans rose 3 cents to $5.28 a bushel. 
</P>
<P>
	Beef futures finished mixed on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange,  
while pork futures rose sharply amid perceptions the worst of a 
pork glut may be coming to an end. 
</P>
<P>
	February live cattle rose .18 cent to 63.15 cents a pound; March  
feeder cattle was unchanged at 73.92 cents a pound; February lean 
hogs rose the limit 2 cents to 40.82 cents a pound; February pork 
bellies jumped the limit 3 cents to 56.05 cents a pound.

                     *Frances Gershwin Godowsky    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Frances Godowsky, who tried out songs for her  
brothers George and Ira Gershwin before emerging as a respected 
painter, died Monday at age 92. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Godowsky, known as Frankie Gershwin, was the youngest  
Gershwin sibling behind Ira, George and Arthur. 
</P>
<P>
	She began as a child dancer, sang in a few Broadway shows in the

<HEADLINE> Denny's Accused of Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- A Denny's restaurant may have deliberately  
slipped bacon and ham into the meals of two Muslims who had 
requested no-pork dishes, an investigator with the Montana Human 
Rights Bureau says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the ingredients for these meals are packaged  
separately and do not contain any pork products ... implies that 
these products were placed in the food intentionally,'' according 
to the investigator's report. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Muslims, Abdussalam Sipes and Clarence Watson, filed a  
religious discrimination complaint with the bureau, seeking an 
apology and $1 million each. The investigator's report was made 
public this week by an Islamic organization. 
</P>
<P>
	If the two sides cannot settle the complaint, it will go before  
a Human Rights Bureau hearing officer. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Denny's, which has been dogged by charges of racism  
for years, did not return calls. The manager of the Billings 
restaurant, Richard Graves, denied the incident was intentional. 
</P>
<P>
	Sipes, whose religion forbids the eating of pork, said in an  
interview Tuesday, ``My soul was poisoned.'' Watson said he had to 
purge himself by vomiting the meal and was unable to read the Koran 
or pray for 40 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations arose from a March lunch at which the men asked  
that their meals of eggs and hash browns be prepared in separate 
skillets to avoid contamination by pork. 
</P>
<P>
	Sipes said he noticed pieces of ham hidden in the food and  
complained. The manager offered them another dish, but Sipes said 
that when he inspected the grilled chicken dish, he found a strip 
of bacon buried. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're claiming it's a giant coincidence that ham -- not once  
but twice -- found its way into both of their meals,'' said the 
men's attorney, Jeff Ferguson. ``They're saying it was a comedy of 
errors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denny's, based in Spartanburg, S.C., settled a $46 million  
discrimination suit in 1994 filed by black Secret Service agents 
who complained they were denied service at a Maryland restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant chain recently launched a $2 million anti-racism  
campaign consisting of a series of TV commercials. Denny's 
employees are now also required to undergo anti-discrimination 
sensitivity training.

<HEADLINE> Stakes Rise Over Budget Surpluses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's call to divide federal  
budget surpluses among Social Security, Medicare and other programs 
is emboldening Republicans itching to use some of it for big tax 
cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	As he did last year, Clinton still is insisting that surpluses  
be reserved until Social Security is revamped so it can provide 
baby boomers' benefits when they retire beginning in a decade. 
</P>
<P>
	But his acknowledgment that surpluses over the next 15 years --  
projected at a gigantic $4.4 trillion by the White House -- will be 
big enough to also beef up other programs has changed the political 
dynamic. Many Republicans said Wednesday that portions of the 
surpluses should be used for cutting taxes, or else Clinton will 
simply spend them. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's not for freezing all of the surplus for Social  
Security,'' said Sen. Sam Brownback, R-Kan., among several 
conservatives who unsuccessfully pressed Senate GOP leaders last 
year to offer large tax reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	The fight over federal surpluses, perhaps this year's most  
overarching legislative issue, was altered last week when Senate 
Republican budget analysts estimated that federal surpluses over 
the next decade could be $600 billion larger than was expected just 
six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's comments again have reshaped the debate. It has  
changed from whether to use hundreds of billions of dollars for 
programs other than Social Security to a struggle over which ones 
will benefit -- tax cuts Republicans want or domestic spending 
Democrats prefer. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clinton declared, ``Save Social Security first.''  
That became code for leaving surpluses untouched until Democrats 
and Republicans agree on girding Social Security for the impending 
retirement of baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the political popularity of the pension program for  
the elderly, the line effectively blocked Republicans from winning 
tax cuts. It did not, however, prevent Clinton and Republicans from 
pushing a huge spending package through Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Clinton  
repeated his plea to fix Social Security before anything else. But 
he added a new twist, saying only 62 percent of the $4.4 trillion 
in surpluses expected over the next 15 years is needed to bolster 
Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest -- about $1.7 trillion -- should be spent on Medicare,  
new retirement accounts, and defense and domestic programs, Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials emphasize that the president would still  
oppose using any of the surplus for anything until a Social 
Security cure is enacted. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's words gave many Republicans political cover for  
proposing to use the remaining $1.7 trillion mostly for tax cuts, 
and perhaps for other purposes like defense and education. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a huge difference'' between last year and this, said  
Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., a moderate who has moved from opposing 
tax cuts last year to favoring them now. ``We'd be in an untenable 
position if we didn't save some of it (the surplus) for taxpayers, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Such comments are crucial because skepticism among moderate  
Republican senators helped kill last year's GOP tax reduction 
drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Other moderates, including Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said  
Wednesday that they still prefer narrow tax cuts to broad ones. But 
GOP leaders, united behind an across-the-board 10 percent income 
tax cut, believe they will have more Republican support for cutting 
taxes than they did a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats, particularly liberals, might also be more  
inclined this year to insist on using surpluses to increase 
spending on domestic programs. 
</P>
<P>
	But House Democrats questioned Wednesday said they still wanted  
to heed Clinton's call to leave surpluses alone until Social 
Security's problems are solved. They realize their party's claim to 
protect the program is a valuable political tool to use against 
Republicans, especially looking ahead to a 2000 election in which 
they have a chance to recapture control of the House.

<HEADLINE> White House Attacks Perjury Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A White House lawyer today dismissed the  
charge that President Clinton lied before a grand jury as nothing 
more than ``arguments over semantics'' and accused House 
Republicans of drawing conclusions more extreme than those of 
Kenneth Starr. ``It is hard to take the charges seriously,'' the 
lawyer told senators. 
</P>
<P>
	White House special counsel Gregory Craig opened a second day of  
defense arguments by urging senators in the impeachment trial to 
read the grand jury testimony and ``see the president is 
truthful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Craig denounced the impeachment article that accuses Clinton of  
perjury before a grand jury last August as ``really bad .... 
legally, structurally and constitutionally.'' He said House 
prosecutors had wrongly tried to criminalize ``utterly 
meaningless'' conflicts in testimony, going through each of them 
point by point. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, Craig said the House prosecutors were wrong to  
argue that Clinton had lied under oath when he told the grand jury 
that he engaged in intimate contact and sexual banter with Monica 
Lewinsky ``on certain occasions'' in 1996 and 1997 when Ms. 
Lewinsky was a White House employee. She testified the activity 
began in late 1995 when she was still an intern. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is simply no way that a reasonable person can look at  
this testimony and conclude or agree with the managers that it is 
a, quote, 'direct lie.' What message do the managers send to 
America and to the rest of the world when they include these kinds 
of allegations as reasons to remove this president from office?'' 
Craig asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is hard to take the charges seriously, when in each case  
they boil down to arguments over semantics,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig tried to support admittedly legalistic arguments with  
video segments from Clinton's testimony and with testimony by 
several former federal prosecutors who argued that the case against 
Clinton did not meet the perjury standard. Craig charged that the 
House prosecutors had stretched far beyond the evidence as well as 
conclusions made by Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is most remarkable is the fact that that the managers  
made many, many allegations of grand jury perjury that the 
independent counsel declined to make,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was out of Washington today, lobbying for policies  
he introduced in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	One prominent Republican, former presidential candidate Pat  
Robertson, said today that Clinton had ``hit a home run'' in his 
speech and had dashed any possibility that he would be convicted at 
the impeachment trial. ``From a public relations standpoint, he's 
won. ... They might as well dismiss this impeachment hearing and 
get on with something else, because it's over as far as I'm 
concerned,'' Robertson said on ``The 700 Club'' television show. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the defense resumed its rebuttal, senators met privately  
in party caucuses. Republicans emerged sounding more certain they 
will seek to call at least some witnesses during the trial to 
resolve conflicts in testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``This all doesn't need to go beyond mid-February, even with the  
deposition of witnesses,'' said John Czwartacki, the spokesman for 
Majority Leader Trent Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House arguments at the trial a day earlier showed  
``there are conflicts in testimony that witnesses might resolve,'' 
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said today. He speculated that most of 
those who might be called could be helpful to Clinton's case. ``I 
don't know why the White House is so panic-stricken about it,'' he 
said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., opposing the calling of any  
witnesses, noted that key figures in the case have been interviewed 
numerous times already. ``They said the same thing each time,'' he 
told NBC. ``Why are we going through this again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House Deputy Counsel Cheryl Mills was to follow Craig to  
argue against an obstruction-of-justice charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig argued that House prosecutors had wrongly lumped charges  
together -- he called it as ``dubious prosecutorial practice'' -- and 
that the perjury article was so vague that it failed to identify 
any false statement Clinton made before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most frightening thing about article one, it alleges  
perjury generally but it does not allege a single perjurious 
statement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig said Clinton's vindication could be found in the grand  
jury transcript, and he encouraged senators to read it carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will see this president make painful, difficult  
admissions,'' he said. ``You will see that the president is 
truthful and after reading, seeing, hearing and studying the 
evidence for yourself ... we believe you will conclude that what 
the president did and said in the grand jury was not unlawful and 
that you must not remove him from office,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig also accused House prosecutors of trying ``to twist the  
scope'' of the perjury case to include allegations that Clinton had 
wrongly denied under oath his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in the 
Paula Jones case even though the House rejected that charge in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	``The managers have sought to merge the Jones testimony with the  
grand jury testimony,'' Craig argued, reminding senators they 
weren't to try Clinton for originally denying his affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's trial session ended at midafternoon, providing a break  
before senators walked over to the House chamber to hear Clinton's 
State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deal with absurdities and contradictions around here every  
day,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Counsel Charles Ruff, in his opening remarks to the  
Senate on Tuesday, offered a point-by-point rebuttal to the House 
prosecution's case. Clinton, he said, did not lie under oath and 
did not try to obstruct Mrs. Jones' case by trying to keep Ms. 
Lewinsky from testifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff accused the House team of ``prosecutorial ... fudge'' on  
key evidence, and declared, ``We will defend the president on the 
facts and on the law and on the constitutional principles that must 
guide your deliberations.''

<HEADLINE> Fiber Doesn't Reduce Colon Cancer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Contradicting years of dietary wisdom, a large new study found  
no evidence that eating lots of high-fiber foods like bran, beans 
and whole wheat bread does anything to lower the risk of colon 
cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	But don't put down that apple yet: Previous studies have found  
that a diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains has other 
health benefits, including reducing the risk of heart disease, high 
blood pressure and certain types of diabetes. 
</P>
<P>
	The study, published in Thursday's New England Journal of  
Medicine, tracked the colon and rectal health of 88,757 women who 
participated in the Harvard-based Nurses Health Study over 16 
years. It is one of the biggest cancer studies of its kind ever 
undertaken. 
</P>
<P>
	From 1980 to 1996, 787 of the women developed cancer of the  
colon or the rectum. The risk was the same, regardless of how much 
fiber they ate. The researchers said they believe the findings 
apply to men as well. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Charles S. Fuchs and his colleagues at the Dana-Farber  
Cancer Institute, Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical 
School said they were astounded to find that women who ate 
low-fiber foods were no more likely to develop colon cancer than 
those who stuck to bran muffins and broccoli. 
</P>
<P>
	``As a practicing physician and as a researcher, this is a  
hypothesis that has stood the test of time,'' Fuchs said. ``There 
has been such an abundant enthusiasm for this hypothesis, so the 
important message here is that fiber, overall, has no protective 
effect.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, he said the benefits of fiber in protecting against  
other problems like high blood pressure and heart disease -- the No. 
1 killer in the country -- are undeniable. 
</P>
<P>
	``If people are taking fiber for any of those reasons, then keep  
doing it. If the primary concern is to prevent colon cancer, then I 
wouldn't try fiber. I'm not sure that's going to work,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The study participants were healthy women, 34 to 59, who had no  
history of cancer. They filled out dietary questionnaires in 1980, 
1984 and 1986, and researchers followed up with the women until 
mid-1996. 
</P>
<P>
	Dr. Michael Thun, who heads epidemiological research for the  
American Cancer Society, said he was surprised by the findings but 
doubts his organization will change its nutritional guidelines 
because people who eat more fruits and vegetables generally suffer 
fewer cases of cancer of the mouth, throat, larynx, esophagus, 
stomach, and lungs. 
</P>
<P>
	``People should base their behavior on all of the evidence  
rather than on one study,'' Thun said. ``One shouldn't either 
zigzag erratically with each new study or lapse into cynicism. The 
fact is that the main components of a healthy lifestyle have been 
clear and steady for some years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He stressed that there may be other properties of vegetables,  
including the vitamin folate, that could lower the risk of cancer 
and that people who eat more fruits, vegetables and whole grains 
also tend to be less obese and suffer fewer health problems. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Dr. John D. Potter of the Fred  
Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle wondered whether 
questionnaires about a person's past eating habits can be accurate 
and if nurses, who are generally more health-conscious than other 
people, are a representative sample. 
</P>
<P>
	Potter said there is evidence to suggest that high sugar and  
calorie consumption and a lack of exercise may be to blame for 
colon cancer, but more research is necessary. ``We have barely 
begun,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Astros Executive Sues Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A former Houston Astros executive is suing the  
team, alleging it refused to promote her and fired her because she 
is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Ann Leary's lawsuit, seeking $300,000, was filed Tuesday  
in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	It alleges the Astros fired her in late 1997 from her position  
as assistant to the club's director of player development, telling 
her the position was being ``eliminated for financial reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros then hired a less-experienced and less-qualified man,  
who was given the job title of minor league administrator with the 
same duties she had performed, the lawsuit says, adding Leary was 
not considered for the new position. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accuses team management of engaging in a pattern of  
discrimination against women and relegating women to jobs ``with 
less visibility, prestige, responsibility and prospects'' than 
those held by men. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is reflective of a pervasive problem in sports,'' said  
her lawyer, Patricia Flannery of Boston. ``Women are not 
penetrating upper-management levels of professional sports, and 
Leslie Leary is just the tip of the iceberg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	An Astros spokesman did not return a message seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Leary claims Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker once told  
her: ``It is my personal philosophy that someone in your position 
should aspire to the next level (director of player development). 
In order to do so, I believe that you have to have played 
baseball.''

<HEADLINE>  Walsh Appointed 49ers GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- After six months of uncertainty  
caused by a front-office exodus, questions about who's in charge of 
the San Francisco 49ers were answered by Bill Walsh's appointment 
as general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be my job to manage the organization, the operational  
side of it, in particular, and to deal with the real challenges 
that will be occurring in the next few months,'' said Walsh, back 
for his third tour with the 49ers, but his first exclusively as an 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh originally came to San Francisco in 1979, winning three  
Super Bowls in 10 years as coach while overseeing drafts or trades 
that produced such players Joe Montana, Steve Young and Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also an awkward stint under George Seifert as a  
consultant in 1996 in which his suggestions were routinely ignored. 
That won't be the case this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't return to the San Francisco 49ers in a  
subordinate role, and I think that's understandable,'' Walsh said. 
``Not that I haven't worked well with others or for others. I did 
that for George Seifert for one year. But the role has changed, 
where I can really, truly express my beliefs and implement those 
beliefs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joining Walsh in the executive ranks will be Terry Donahue, 54.  
The former UCLA coach and broadcaster, Donahue was hired as the 
team's player personnel director. Walsh said Donahue also will be 
groomed to eventually succeed him as the team's chief football 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	The additions bring a sense of closure to six months of  
organizational upheaval marked by the resignations of Carmen Policy 
and Larry Thrailkill as team president and Dwight Clark as general 
manager and the firing of Vinny Cerrato as player personnel 
director. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think now there's a sense of stability,'' said Walsh, who  
was signed to a four-year contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I didn't come here, for example, to clean house or to get  
this thing straight. It could be that everyone is doing a solid job 
and performing well and there could be no changes. It could be that 
there will be some changes. We're just going to go to work, 
continue as we have and see where that takes us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh took pains to say he was there to complement the efforts  
of coach Steve Mariucci, signed to a new five-year contract last 
week, and praised him as one of the finest coaches in the league. 
San Francisco went 12-4 this season and beat Green Bay in the 
playoffs before losing to Atlanta in the divisional round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm certainly not going to interfere with Steve, other than a  
play or two I might try to call during a game,'' Walsh said, 
laughing. ``I'm in total harmony with Steve Mariucci.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With the 49ers facing a salary cap crunch -- they're a projected  
$24 million over next season's limit -- Walsh said he and his staff 
face major challenges in holding the roster together. He also said 
he expects to focus more on the draft than free agency in 
addressing team needs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's not going to be easy, but you have a choice of pyramiding  
or mortgaging into the future further or trying to deal with it 
directly,'' Walsh said. ``We can't do it cold turkey, but we 
certainly have to be looking closely at where we are with our squad 
and the cap.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team also hopes to hire former 49ers receiver Gene  
Washington as an executive vice president, which would make him one 
of the highest ranking blacks in a front office role. Washington, 
52, currently is the NFL's director of football development. 
</P>
<P>
	Washington's addition to the 49ers front office could coincide  
with the resolution of exiled co-owner Eddie DeBartolo's bid for 
reinstatement. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo is awaiting NFL clearance to resume active ownership  
of the team. He ceded day-to-day control to his sister, co-owner 
Denise DeBartolo York, in December 1997 when he was targeted in a 
Louisiana gambling fraud probe. 
</P>
<P>
	DeBartolo pleaded guilty last October to failing to report a  
felony crime and was placed on probation and fined $2 million. He 
also must testify against former Louisiana Gov. Edwin Edwards, who 
allegedly received $400,000 from DeBartolo as part of an 
influence-peddling scheme involving issuance of riverboat casino 
licenses. 
</P>
<P>
	The NFL is expected to decide by this spring whether to allow  
DeBartolo to regain control of the team.

<HEADLINE> Koreas Peace Talks Move Forward </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Negotiators discussed the basics of Korean peace  
Wednesday despite North Korea's warning that a row over one of its 
diplomats could affect the talks. 
</P>
<P>
	Delegates from the two Koreas, the United States and China met  
in working groups to discuss how to reduce tension on the Korean 
peninsula and establish a permanent peace. With an armistice rather 
than a formal peace treaty ending fighting in 1953, the Koreas 
technically remain at war. 
</P>
<P>
	The four-party talks started in December 1997 and went through  
two rounds last year. In October, the conference agreed to set up 
two working groups which got under way Wednesday. The new 
committees have no negotiating power and will submit proposals to 
heads of delegation. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee meetings would continue Thursday, said Li Gun, North  
Korea's deputy delegation leader. He didn't say what had been 
discussed, and the other delegations refused to comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The process of replacing the armistice that ended the 1950-53  
Korean War with a formal peace treaty is expected to take years. 
``To talk about these issues will take a tremendous time,'' Li 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Previous rounds of the talks have largely been taken up by  
procedural wrangling. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and China are attending as major combatants in  
the Korean War. This round of talks was expected to end Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Wednesday, the North accused the South of kidnapping one  
of its diplomats in Germany and handing him over to the United 
States to avoid responsibility. The incident ``shows clearly that 
(the United States and South Korea) are not willing to work with us 
for peace,'' Li said. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean officials say Kim Kyong Pil and his wife defected  
about a week ago on a trip to Frankfurt and are seeking asylum in 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	North Korea claims South Korean intelligence agents abducted Kim  
and his wife on Jan. 13 in front of the Hilton Hotel in Berlin.

<HEADLINE> Blue Chips End Lower; Dow Down 19.31 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks gave back strong early gains in  
the final hour of today's session to close lower on the day, after 
investors sold their holdings to lock in profits. 
</P>
<P>
	At the close of trading on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial  
average was down 19.31 at 9,335.91. The Dow got as high as 
9,480.09, up nearly 125, before sellers stepped in late in the 
session. Volume was heavy at nearly 900 million shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Most broader indexes ended higher, but technology stocks trimmed  
strong early gains as well. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 4.61 to 1,256.61, and the  
technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index rose 7.41 to 2,415.58. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues outnumbered advancers by 1,593 to 1,476 on the  
New York Stock Exchange, with 507 unchanged. 
</P>
<P>
	NYSE volume totaled 899.17 million shares as of 4 p.m., vs.  
785.54 million in the previous session. 
</P>
<P>
	The NYSE composite index rose 1.26 to 596.09 , and the American  
Stock Exchange composite index rose 4.76 to 712.37. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russell 2000 index of smaller companies fell 0.28 to 430.61.  
</P>
<P>
	Stocks were higher earlier on positive earnings reports and  
relief that Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan didn't say 
anything too damaging when he testified before a Congressional 
committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks, meanwhile, put in a strong day, pushing broad  
indexes sharply higher until profit-taking set in in the final 
hour. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite still managed to close higher on the day,  
setting a new record for the second day in a row. The S&AMP;P 500 also 
closed higher. 
</P>
<P>
	Blue chip stocks opened tentatively but picked up steam around  
10 a.m. after Greenspan began testifying about the state of the 
economy before the House Ways and Means Committee. There had been 
concerns that Greenspan would send prices lower by reprising his 
famous admonition about ``irrational exuberance'' in the stock 
market. That speech, made in December 1996, sparked a big sell-off 
by investors concerned that the Fed would raise interest rates in 
an attempt to slow the economy and the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, Greenspan did say that ``the current level of equity  
prices would appear to envision a substantially greater growth in 
profits than have been experienced of late.'' But he also signaled 
that he was unlikely to take any action soon to try to dampen the 
market's advances, saying that ``policymakers are going to have to 
be particularly wary of actions that unnecessarily sow 
uncertainties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Willmore, senior economist at Barclays Capital, took that  
to mean that the Fed wouldn't ease credit soon, but also wouldn't 
tighten it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market would have gone down sharply if he had said  
something that indicates that he is leaning toward a tightening of 
monetary policy,'' Willmore said. '' And I would describe his 
comments as pretty even-handed or neutral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, technology stocks continued to press higher, boosted  
by a strong earnings report from software giant Microsoft. The 
company said Tuesday that its second-quarter net income was 73 
cents per share, beating analysts' estimates of 59 cents. Texas 
Instruments also rallied after reporting better-than-expected 
fourth-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Among blue chip industrial names, General Motors shares rose  
after the automaker reported record fourth-quarter earnings of 
$2.61 a share, on target with analysts' expectations, compared with 
$2.33 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T was higher after investment firm Morgan Stanley Dean Witter  
raised its 12-month price targets the telecommunications giant. 
</P>
<P>
	But Philip Morris shares fell on concerns that President Clinton  
said in his State of the Union address late Tuesday that the 
federal government should pursue compensation from tobacco 
companies for smoking-related medical costs.

<HEADLINE>  Walsh Appointed 49ers GM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SANTA CLARA, Calif. (AP) -- After six months of uncertainty  
caused by a front-office exodus, questions about who's in charge of 
the San Francisco 49ers were answered by Bill Walsh's appointment 
as general manager. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll be my job to manage the organization, the operational  
side of it, in particular, and to deal with the real challenges 
that will be occurring in the next few months,'' said Walsh, back 
for his third tour with the 49ers, but his first exclusively as an 
administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Walsh originally came to San Francisco in 1979, winning three  
Super Bowls in 10 years as coach while overseeing drafts or trades 
that produced such players Joe Montana, Steve Young and Jerry Rice. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also an awkward stint under George Seifert as a  
consultant in 1996 in which his suggestions were routinely ignored. 
That won't be the case this time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just couldn't return to the San Francisco 49ers in a  
subordinate role, and I think that's understandable,'' Walsh said. 
``Not that I haven't worked well with others or for others. I did

<HEADLINE> New Air-traffic Computer Debuts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUBURN, Wash. (AP) -- Pacific Northwest air traffic controllers  
have become the first to get new computer equipment as part of the 
federal government's $1 billion plan to replace its vacuum-tube 
radar display system that is prone to breakdowns. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey and Transportation Secretary  
Rodney Slater dedicated the new system Wednesday at the Seattle Air 
Route Traffic Control Center, which oversees flights over 
Washington, most of Oregon and portions of Idaho, Montana, Northern 
California and Nevada. 
</P>
<P>
	Slater said the new system will ``help keep our skies the safest  
in the world while air traffic continues to grow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Auburn system was installed last October and air traffic  
controllers began using it about a month ago. Salt Lake City and 
Cleveland are next, and by the summer of 2000, all of the nation's 
20 regional air-traffic control centers are scheduled to have the 
new system. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the new system is considered faster and more reliable  
than the 1970s-era technology it is replacing, it is not immune to 
glitches like the one Auburn controllers dealt with on Friday. A 
battery failure during a routine check of a backup power supply cut 
power to the center and the new equipment. 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers were able to maintain contact with jetliners with a  
backup radio system, but radar used to prevent collisions was shut 
down for 35 minutes. Hundreds of flights were delayed and airline 
traffic was frozen for an hour. There were no reports of planes 
flying too close together. 
</P>
<P>
	Controllers said one of the advantages of the new system is that  
it's easier to maintain. Parts needed for the old system are no 
longer made, controller Mark Blair said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem was the components -- they would break and you just  
couldn't get them anymore,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other improvements under way or planned by the Federal Aviation  
Administration include a new system that helps pilots make 
precision landings guided by the Global Positioning System, and an 
e-mail system between computers on the ground and in the cockpit. 
That should reduce the time lag and chance of errors in voice 
communications.

<HEADLINE> Sydney Bid Info Won't Be Released </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SYDNEY, Australia (AP) -- The New South Wales state government  
will not release documents on Sydney's Olympic bid, despite the 
current Games bribery scandal, Olympics Minister Michael Knight 
said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Claims of bribery by bidding cities eager to impress  
International Olympic Committee (IOC) members have rocked the 
sports world. Up to 13 IOC members have been implicated in 
allegations of misconduct stemming from Salt Lake City's winning 
bid for the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Knight said there was nothing to suggest Sydney's bid for the  
2000 Games was corrupt, but maintained his refusal to prove it by 
releasing the documents. 
</P>
<P>
	While he said he was happy to provide the material to the IOC if  
it requested it, the public release of the documents would spark a 
witch hunt against the previous government. 
</P>
<P>
	``I actually place a high value on fairness and integrity and I  
don't want to be involved in some tacky political exercise to try 
and smear people in a previous government,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Sherm Lewis Interviews With Bears </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKE FOREST, Ill. (AP) -- Green Bay Packers offensive coordinator  
Sherm Lewis knows he's different from other coaches who've come 
through the Chicago Bears' door in the last week. 
</P>
<P>
	He doesn't have a stint as a Bears assistant on his resume. And  
he's never worked with Mark Hatley, Chicago's vice president of 
player personnel. 
</P>
<P>
	What he does have is a long resume, filled with success.  
</P>
<P>
	``I've been in the league 16 years, and I've been to the  
playoffs 13 of those 16 years,'' Lewis said Wednesday. ``I've been 
to five Super Bowls, winning four of them. I've been to eight NFC 
championship games. So my credentials are pretty outstanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis interviewed Wednesday with Bears president Michael  
McCaskey for Chicago's coaching vacancy, created when Dave 
Wannstedt was fired three weeks ago. Arizona Cardinals defensive 
coordinator Dave McGinnis will meet with McCaskey on Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	Three other coaches -- Jacksonville defensive coordinator Dick  
Jauron, Buffalo offensive coordinator Joe Pendry and Kansas City 
defensive coordinator Gunther Cunningham -- already have 
interviewed. The Bears have permission to talk with Jets assistant 
head coach Bill Belichick, but McCaskey sounded as if he is off the 
list. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am getting a little bit to the point where I want to bring  
it to a close. I think we have enough excellent candidates in hand 
right now,'' McCaskey said. ``(An announcement) might be the end of 
this week, it might be into next week or even a little bit later.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay became one of the NFL's best and most dangerous  
offenses under Lewis, the Packers' coordinator the past seven 
seasons. Brett Favre developed into one of the league's best 
quarterbacks, winning three straight MVP titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Green Bay led the league in points (456) and touchdowns (56) in  
1996 on its way to a Super Bowl victory over New England. That's a 
big selling point for the Bears, whose offense has been anemic, at 
best, the past few seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know what works. I know what we've done. I know what we've  
done to be successful, and I would try to implement that to a 
tee,'' Lewis said. ``I'm not so much worried about what's gone on 
(here) in the past. I would come in and put my program in, and it's 
proven to be successful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lewis, an assistant at San Francisco before he moved to Green  
Bay, has worked with the West Coast offense for 16 seasons. That, 
plus his knowledge of the NFC Central, also sets him apart, he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a great knowledge of the division and the opponents and  
the teams we're trying to overtake,'' he said. ``The teams we're 
trying to beat, I've been going against them for seven years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Despite his solid reputation, Lewis has been passed over for  
several head coaching jobs. Dallas chose Chan Gailey over him last 
year. And when Mike Holmgren left Green Bay earlier this month, the 
Packers chose former assistant Ray Rhodes. 
</P>
<P>
	But Lewis said he's not worrying about that.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think I bring a lot to the table, and I'm looking forward to  
the opportunity to convince (McCaskey) I am the man for the job,'' 
he said. ``That's what my objective coming here is, to convince him 
I'm a little different than any other guy he's looking at and I'll 
make a difference.''

<HEADLINE> U.S. Missile Defense Six Years Away </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration said Wednesday it  
probably will take two years longer than previously believed to 
build a defense against a long-range missile attack on the United 
States. But, it added, the need for such a defense system is 
greater than ever. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration moved its target date for deploying a  
national missile defense from 2003 to 2005, Defense Secretary 
William Cohen told a Pentagon news conference. The cost of building 
the system is estimated to reach $10.5 billion, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said President Clinton's proposed 2000 budget, to be  
submitted to Congress on Feb. 1, will include an extra $6.6 billion 
for missile defense work through the year 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	A decision on whether to actually deploy a national missile  
defense will be made in June 2000, Cohen said. The decision will 
depend on two things: the level of threat of a missile attack and 
the Defense Department's technical readiness to build such a 
defense, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are affirming that there is a threat, and the threat is  
growing, and that it will pose a danger not only to our troops 
overseas but also to Americans here at home,'' Cohen said. He said 
the main worry was of a limited missile attack from a hostile 
nation such as North Korea or Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen noted that North Korea, which remains in a state of war  
with U.S.-backed South Korea, shocked the world last August by 
test-firing a medium-range ballistic missile over Japan. The 
missile, called the Taepo-dong 1, showed a surprising level of 
technical advancement. 
</P>
<P>
	Although there is no indication that the missile could reach  
U.S. territory, the North Koreans are believed to be working on one 
capable of reaching Hawaii or Alaska. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Taepo-dong 1 test was another strong indicator that the  
United States will, in fact, face a rogue nation missile threat to 
our homeland, against which we will have to defend the American 
people,'' Cohen said. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen said the revised timetable provides a more realistic  
chance of building a successful missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the reality of the threat, we cannot afford to fail,''  
the defense secretary said. 
</P>
<P>
	Over the past two decades the United States has spent tens of  
billions of dollars on missile defense, yet no working system is in 
place. Until recently, the Clinton administration said it was too 
early to judge whether the threat of attack was high enough to 
justify deploying one. The Russians have strongly opposed a U.S. 
national missile defense. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile treaty between the United States  
and the former Soviet Union prohibits deployment of the kind of 
missile defense system Cohen described. He said U.S. officials will 
talk to the Russians about amending the ABM treaty, but that if the 
Russians refuse, the United States will abandon the treaty and 
build the anti-missile system anyway. 
</P>
<P>
	Cohen stressed that the administration prefers to keep an  
amended ABM treaty in force as a means of discouraging the 
development of offensive missiles by other countries. 
</P>
<P>
	The missile defense system Cohen described would include a  
sensor based in space that would detect the plume of a ballistic 
missile at liftoff, providing early warning of an attack. 
Ground-based radars in the United States would calculate the 
missile's trajectory and guide a ground-launched interceptor rocket 
to destroy the missile outside the earth's atmosphere. The 
interceptor rockets might be based in Alaska or North Dakota, Cohen 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, Cohen announced changes in the administration's  
approach to defenses against shorter-range missiles, such as the 
Scud missiles Iraq launched during the 1991 Gulf War or those which 
North Korea could fire at U.S. and allied troops in South Korea or 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the Army's Theater High-Altitude Area Defense system, or  
THAAD, will resume flight tests even though it has failed five 
consecutive times to hit its test target, most recently last May. 
</P>
<P>
	Late next year, he said, the Pentagon will decide whether THAAD  
or a sea-based system the Navy has been working on should be given 
the lead priority. In either case, the goal is to have one of the 
two systems ready for use by 2007, Cohen said.

<HEADLINE> Bush Dodges Impeachment Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former President Bush, saying he wasn't going  
to get into current events, sidestepped remarking on the Senate 
impeachment trial of his successor on Wednesday. But he told 
senators he was concerned about a rising ``lack of civility in our 
political debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the speaker at a Senate lecture series, called it ``a very  
traumatic time, a very busy time'' for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Defeated by President Clinton in 1992 after serving one term,  
the former president reflected on his presidency and on his long 
political career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my chance to serve. And I did my best. I messed up some  
things and, hopefully, got some things right,'' Bush said in the 
address in the Old Senate Chamber, used by the Senate until the 
1850s. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, at a picture-taking session with Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., Bush 
was asked by a reporter if he had any reflections on the 
impeachment trial taking place in the current Senate quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to admit, the timing is a little peculiar,'' he said.  
However, he added, ``I'm not going to go into current events.'' He 
suggested it would be beneath the dignity of the lecture series. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks, Bush told his audience of senators and invited  
guests, many of whom served in his administration, ``I have 
refrained from commenting on the serious matter now before the 
Senate -- and will continue to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he added, ``I confess that the lack of civility in our  
political debate and official dealings with one another concerns 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry, too, about sleaze -- about excessive intrusion into  
private lives,'' he said. He complained about ``tabloid journalism 
-- giving us sensationalism at best, smut at worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who also served eight years as vice president to President  
Reagan, said the most important Senate vote of his presidency was 
the 52-47 vote in January 1991 authorizing use of force in the 
Persian Gulf to drive Iraq out of Kuwait. So contentious was the 
issue at the time that some critics even discussed attempting to 
impeach him if he went to war without first obtaining congressional 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We honored Congress' right to be heard before a single shot  
had been fired,'' Bush said. The audience included Colin Powell, 
who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time. Bush 
said he regretted having been unable to muster a wider margin in 
support of the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we stayed the course, and I hope history will say not only  
that we won, but that we won with honor,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said that in the days he presided over the Senate as vice  
president, he ``loved interacting with senators of both parties.'' 
Bush never served in the Senate -- he lost Senate races in 1964 and 
1970. But he served in the House, and as ambassador to the United 
Nations, CIA director and chairman of the Republican National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott noted that Bush's address came on the 10th anniversary of  
his being sworn in as the nation's 41st president. Playfully, Bush 
reminded Lott that it was also ``six years ago to this very day 
that I was sworn out of office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bush, who now lives in Houston with wife Barbara, said he  
has no regrets that his own political career has ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time has moved on. And in our family, the torch has passed to  
two boys,'' he said, referring to son George, who is governor of 
Texas and a possible presidential contender in 2000; and son Jeb, 
who is governor of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush joked that he did not feel qualified to ``lecture'' anyone  
in the Senate 
</P>
<P>
	``So to be clear, this is not a lecture. Nor is it a  
filibuster,'' he said. ``Speaking of filibusters, Barbara is sorry 
she couldn't be here this evening.''

<HEADLINE> Norfolk Southern, CSX To Close Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Norfolk Southern Corp. and CSX Corp. will  
close their deal to acquire Conrail on June 1. The two Virginia 
railroads also will begin operating their respective portions of 
Conrail on that date. 
</P>
<P>
	The railroads said Wednesday that customer service planning,  
capital improvement projects, employee training and labor 
agreements needed for the deal are largely complete, while old and 
new computers are being tested to make sure they can communicate. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern is buying 58 percent of Philadelphia-based  
Conrail and Richmond-based CSX Corp. is buying the rest in a $10.3 
billion deal approved last summer by the federal Surface 
Transportation Board. The agreement took effect Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The June 1 date allows enough time to make sure operations will  
be seamless and safe, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring will introduce competition to several  
Northeastern markets for the first time since 1976, when Conrail 
began operating as a monopoly created by Congress out of six 
bankrupt railroads. 
</P>
<P>
	After closing the deal, Norfolk-based Norfolk Southern will  
operate 7,200 miles of Conrail routes, creating a 21,600-mile rail 
system serving 22 states in the East, as well as Washington, D.C. 
and Ontario, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX will operate 4,000 miles of Conrail routes, resulting in a  
22,300-mile rail system serving 23 states east of the Mississippi, 
Washington, D.C. and Montreal and Ontario, Canada.

<HEADLINE> China Stock Markets Said Expanding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Despite a prolonged slump in prices, China's  
stock markets expanded and improved operations in 1998, the 
country's top securities regulator said Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	By the end of last year, the total market value of companies  
listed on the Shanghai and Shenzhen exchanges had risen to $236 
billion, accounting for almost one-quarter of the gross domestic 
product, Zhou Zhengqing, chairman of the China Securities 
Regulatory Commission, told a financial conference. 
</P>
<P>
	The number of companies listed on the markets rose in 1998 to  
851 from 745 the year before, the state-run Xinhua News Agency 
quoted Zhou as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	The national legislature recently approved China's first  
national securities law, which takes effect July 1. The law is 
intended to reinforce efforts by the Securities Regulatory 
Commission to curb market manipulation, fraud and insider trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhou said the commission's crackdown on such abuses had helped  
reduce volatility and improve market operations, Xinhua reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Zhou's pro-market comments came amid a flurry of profit warnings  
from listed companies. In the past two weeks, more than 60 listed 
firms have announced that they will report losses in 1998 -- the 
highest number since China set up stock exchanges in 1990. The 
number is expected to rise further during the 1998 corporate 
reporting season, which ends in April. 
</P>
<P>
	Shielded by rules that ban foreigners from most trading, Chinese  
stock prices remained high through mid-1998, but they have been 
falling steadily since June. The Shanghai market is down 21 
percent, while Shenzhen is off 31 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The new securities law, which closes loopholes that allowed  
illicit funds into the market, and the collapse of several major 
investment firms, chief among them Guangdong International Trust 
and Investment Corp., has further soured market sentiment.

<HEADLINE> CFTC Chair Won't Seek Another Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brooksley Born has told President Clinton she  
will not seek another term as chairwoman of the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Born, who got caught up in a recent flap over the  
near-collapse of a huge private investment fund, told Clinton in a 
brief letter on Tuesday that she has decided to return to private 
law practice at the end of her term in April or soon after rather 
than seek a second five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've accomplished most of what I set out to do,'' Ms. Born  
told a small group of reporters. She cited as an example the 
independent agency's effort to streamline regulation of the 
commodity futures industry, which she said was ``well launched and 
on its way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Born got caught up in controversy in November following a  
news report that she had advance knowledge of the near-demise of 
Long-Term Capital Management, a high-flying hedge fund for wealthy 
investors. According to the report, she knew Long-Term Capital was 
dangerously leveraged in March 1998, months before it nearly 
collapsed and threatened to disrupt world financial markets in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	When the issue surfaced, Ms. Born insisted she was given  
outdated annual information about the hedge fund in March that 
offered no hint of the potential for disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of the hedge fund's collapse prompted Federal Reserve  
officials to help arrange a $3.6 billion private bailout of 
Long-Term Capital by a group of big banks and brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the matter Tuesday, Ms. Born said the hedge fund  
debacle was a factor in her decision to leave the government ``only 
to the extent that it did bring the spotlight onto'' 
over-the-counter derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I applaud this new attention (to derivatives) and am highly  
optimistic that the regulatory issues are going to be addressed in 
a meaningful way,'' Ms. Born added. 
</P>
<P>
	Derivatives, complex financial instruments whose value depends  
on the value or change in value of an underlying security, 
commodity or asset, are used by businesses to guard against losses 
from unexpected market movements but also by hedge funds such as 
Long-Term Capital to speculate. Over-the-counter derivatives are 
traded away from futures exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Highlights From Impeachment Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Highlights from Wednesday's developments in the Senate  
impeachment trial against President Clinton: 
</P>
<P>
	--Greg Craig, special counsel to the president, argued against  
the accusation by Clinton committed perjury. The Republican-written 
indictment, Craig said, ``falls well below the most basic, minimal 
standards and should not be used to impeach and remove this 
president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Cheryl Mills, White House deputy counsel, arguing against the  
House charge that Clinton obstructed justice. She said the 
president's ``conduct, while clearly not attractive or admirable, 
is not criminal.'' Mills attacked the articles themselves, saying 
that ``for conviction, each and every element must be proven beyond 
a reasonable doubt. ...In this case, none of the elements are 
present.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- Mills argued emotionally against the notion that the president  
infringed upon Paula Jones' civil rights, saying, ``I'm not worried 
about civil rights, because this president's record on civil 
rights, on women's rights, on all of our rights is unimpeachable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- President Clinton spent the day in New York and Pennsylvania  
supporting his call in Tuesday's State of The Union address for 
Social Security reform. 
</P>
<P>
	-- The Senate prepared for Thursday's closing arguments in the  
president's defense by presidential attorney David Kendall and 
former Sen. Dale Bumpers, D-Ark.

<HEADLINE> Intel Antitrust Hearing Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A judge agreed Wednesday to delay for two  
weeks a hearing of the federal antitrust charges against Intel 
Corp., saying the computer-chip maker did not turn over requested 
documents. 
</P>
<P>
	James P. Timony, an administrative law judge for the Federal  
Trade Commission, moved the hearing to March 9. He indicated 
Intel's failure to hand over information caused delays questioning 
witnesses and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel spokesman Chuck Mulloy said the new schedule was requested  
by both sides and declined further comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The FTC sued Intel last summer, accusing the company of denying  
three competitors access to important technical information about 
then-upcoming Intel computer chips. It said Intel sought to punish 
them for refusing to license key patents on Intel's terms. 
</P>
<P>
	Intel chips run about 80 percent of the world's computers. The  
company has denied allegations it abused its market influence to 
freeze out and punish competitors.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Takes Message on the Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Leaving behind a chilly political clime,  
President Clinton is road-testing proposals for education, Social 
Security and other initiatives from his State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	The president told Congress on Tuesday night, ``I reach out my  
hand to those of you of both parties in both houses and ask you to 
join me'' in acting this year to shore up Social Security and make 
other bold initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, with campaign-style appearances open to the public in  
Buffalo, N.Y., and suburban Philadelphia, Clinton was reaching out 
to Americans for help in pushing along an impeachment-preoccupied 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``With our budget surplus growing, our economy expanding, our  
confidence rising, now is the time for this generation to meet our 
historic responsibility to the 21st century,'' Clinton exhorted the 
joint session of Congress convened for his prime-time address. 
</P>
<P>
	``Let's get to work,'' he said in the House chamber just hours  
after his impeachment trial in the Senate recessed for the day. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's travels were in keeping with Clinton's efforts to focus  
on the nation's business as the Senate trial against him wears on 
and underscored his intention to pursue what aides called an 
``activist agenda'' midway through his second term in office. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillary Rodham Clinton was accompanying him on the trip, and  
Vice President Al Gore and his wife, Tipper, were joining the 
Clintons later in the day at a Norristown, Pa., high school rally. 
Meanwhile, members of Clinton's Cabinet were fanning out across 
America to highlight the president's initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	Commerce Secretary William Daley was amplifying on the State of  
the Union proposals at a roundtable in Dallas, while Housing 
Secretary Andrew Cuomo was addressing residents of an empowerment 
zone in St. Louis. Health and Human Services Secretary Donna 
Shalala was participating in a child care event with Chicago Mayor 
Richard Daley. Education Secretary Richard Riley was meeting with 
high school students in Wilmington, Del. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said 20,000 tickets were distributed to  
people who wanted to see Clinton at Marine Midland Arena in 
Buffalo, which has had five feet of snow this winter. Clinton has 
made several public appearances since he was impeached on Dec. 19, 
but all were before smaller and more exclusive audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Administration officials concede they face a challenge in  
getting lawmakers caught up in the impeachment process to embrace 
Clinton's initiatives. One way is for Clinton to address it is to 
speak past Washington's political establishment directly to the 
public and make the case that he can still be effective. 
</P>
<P>
	``It bothers me that he lied to everybody,'' said 18-year-old  
Amy Brandau, a senior lunching in the Norristown High School 
cafeteria on Tuesday. ``But I'm willing to put those things aside 
to see him in person. It sounds corny, but when am I ever going to 
see a president?'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's Social Security proposal would use most of the $4  
trillion in projected budget surpluses over 15 years to create new 
401(k)-style retirement accounts. That is sure to set up a 
legislative battle with Republicans who want to use a big portion 
of the surpluses for a 10 percent across-the-board tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Other items he unveiled included $1 billion to help about  
200,000 welfare families get jobs; $1 billion in tax credits to 
encourage investment in impoverished urban and rural areas; a tax 
credit of up to $250 per child age 1 or younger for parents who 
stay home to care for them; and $600 million for after-school and 
summer-school programs helping 1.1 million children. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also proposed a $1 increase in the minimum wage and  
spending $12 billion to improve military readiness and 
modernization in fiscal year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Albright To Discuss Kosovo, Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Secretary of State Madeleine Albright will go  
to London and Paris late next week for talks on Kosovo and Iraq 
with the British and French foreign ministers, her spokesman, James 
P. Rubin, said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The stops Jan. 28 and 29, which include an overnight in London,  
were added to Albright's travel schedule amid rising tensions with 
Yugoslavia over Kosovo and a standoff with Iraq over weapon sites 
inspections. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if Albright's scheduled meetings with British Foreign  
Secretary Robin Cook and French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine 
meant a threat to bomb Serb installations was being put on hold at 
least until then, Rubin said ``I wouldn't draw any conclusions'' 
from her plans. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, tensions were rising over what U.S. officials consider to  
be stiff resistance by Yugoslav President Sloboan Milosevic to a 
series of demands, including his refusal to cooperate with probes 
of human rights abuses in Kosovo. 
</P>
<P>
	This could mean discussions with Cook and Vedrine would be  
followed by a joint meeting of the foreign ministers of Russia, 
Italy, Germany, France and Britain with Albright at the end of next 
week. With the United States, the five nations make up the 
so-called ``Contact Group'' that oversees the restive Balkans. 
</P>
<P>
	Albright is due to leave Sunday for Moscow and talks with  
Russian leaders over three days, then stop briefly in Egypt and fly 
to Saudi Arabia. The talks in the two countries are centered on 
Iraq. 
</P>
<P>
	Rubin called the meeting two top NATO generals had with Yugoslav  
President Slobodan Milosevic ``deeply troubling.'' He said the 
Serbian leader's responses were ``unsatisfactory across the 
board.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``NATO is taking certain military steps to put NATO in a  
position to move rapidly if NATO makes a decision to use military 
force,'' the spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Nugent Seeks To Boycott Canada </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TORONTO (AP) -- American rocker Ted Nugent is so angry at  
Ontario's decision to ban its spring bear hunt that he's organizing 
a U.S. boycott of Canadian tourism. 
</P>
<P>
	Nugent, an outspoken hunting and pro-gun crusader who lives in  
rural Jackson County, Mich., said he wants Canada to pay for what 
he calls the province's ``tomfoolery.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I am going to shut off the flow of American dollars into  
Canada, not just for bear hunting, for anything, and I can do it,'' 
said Nugent, who believes the ban will bring a surplus of bears. 
</P>
<P>
	Ontario's Natural Resources Minister John Snobelen announced  
last week he was banning the spring hunt because it resulted in too 
many orphaned cubs. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nugent, the self-proclaimed Motor City Madman who found fame  
in the 1970s with the hit ``Cat Scratch Fever,'' said the ban 
``only helps the touchy-feely fantasy of a bunch of people who 
would ban you and I from ever wearing leather or having a steak.''

<HEADLINE> Unions Say Merger Talks Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Merger negotiations are underway between the  
International Union of Electronic Workers and the United Mine 
Workers, the Dayton Daily News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in heavy merger talks and I hope it happens because  
both unions would be much stronger,'' said Mike Bindas, president 
of an IUE chapter in Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
	The IUE represents 130,000 members across the nation -- including  
13,500 workers at five Dayton-area auto plants -- and the UMW has 
60,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way the IUE can truly protect its independence is by  
buddying up with another independent union, so a merger like that 
would make a lot of sense,'' said Sean McAlinden, a labor 
researcher at the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	If an agreement is reached, the unions would start with an  
affiliation before completing a full merger, Bindas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IUE also has discussed merging with the United Auto Workers  
and the United Steel Workers of America, but a deal with those 
unions is unlikely at this time, Bindas said. 
</P>
<P>
	A message requesting additional comment from the IUE was left  
today at the union's national headquarters in Washington. There was 
no answer to calls to UMW headquarters, also in Washington.

<HEADLINE> Walker Named Coach at Northwestern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Wearing a Northwestern-purple tie and a  
wide grin, Randy Walker called himself the luckiest guy in the 
world. Again. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach at Miami of Ohio the past nine seasons was introduced  
as the Wildcats' new coach Wednesday afternoon. He replaces Gary 
Barnett, who was hired as Colorado's coach earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just keep having good things happen to me,'' he said.  
``You're looking at an old farm boy from Troy, Ohio, who didn't 
have a whole lot of resources going for him when he came out of 
high school. I thank God every night I'm alive that football is a 
game I could play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gave me a chance to do the things I want to do in life,''  
he added. ``... And that's coach football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett's departure and Walker's hiring puts an end to a  
tumultuous few weeks for the Wildcats. Barnett, who returned the 
Wildcats to glory in 1995 and 1996 with a trip to the Rose Bowl and 
consecutive Big Ten championships, has flirted with leaving almost 
since he arrived in Evanston in late 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a candidate for jobs at UCLA and Notre Dame, and linked  
to jobs at Georgia, Oklahoma and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all sad coach Barnett left, but what can you do?''  
sophomore offensive lineman Lance Clelland said. ``I'm excited for 
a fresh start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Walker is excited to give his new players one. The former  
Northwestern assistant is Miami's winningest coach, compiling a 
record of 59-35-5 in the past nine seasons, including a 10-1 mark 
last year. His 59 victories are best in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Miami which handed Northwestern its only loss in the  
regular season during its 1995 Rose Bowl year, a 30-28 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted someone with Division I experience who had  
demonstrated a record of winning,'' athletic director Rick Taylor 
said. ``We got the person we were after.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker is the latest in a long line of coaches to come out of  
Miami. Sid Gillman, Woody Hayes, Bo Schembechler and Bill Mallory 
all coached there, as did former Northwestern coach Ara Parseghian. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randy is for real, and we've said that to the people who have  
asked about him,'' said Joel Maturi, Miami's athletic director. 
``Northwestern is very fortunate to get a person of his character 
and work ethic and passion for kids. Not to mention his ability to 
win games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker isn't walking into an easy job. After years of permanent  
residence in the Big Ten basement -- just two teams won four games 
after 1971 -- Barnett had the Wildcats in the Rose Bowl after his 
fourth season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Northwestern has faltered the past two seasons. The Wildcats  
went 5-7 in 1997 and 3-8 last season. The school was rocked by a 
sports betting scandal that saw four former football players 
indicted Dec. 3 for allegedly lying about their gambling 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I, for one, don't tend to dwell on the past,'' Walker said.  
``Let's talk about going forward, where are we going tomorrow. 
Let's worry about getting one day better as a football team. That's 
kind of how I start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker has only two weeks before national signing day for  
recruits. Aside from putting together a new staff and getting 
familiar with his new players, he has to find a way to keep 
recruits who might have been scared off by Barnett's impending 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll get my feet on the ground and hit it running,'' said  
Walker, who met with his new players for the first time after the 
news conference. ``Trust me, once I hit it running, I'm going to go 
real fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker played at Miami and was the team's MVP in 1975. Drafted  
by the Cincinnati Bengals, he chose to stay at Miami as a graduate 
assistant under coach Dick Crum. He accompanied Crum to North 
Carolina and spent 10 years there as an assistant. He then spent 
two years at Northwestern, where he coached the first back-to-back 
1,000-yard rushers in school history -- Byron Sanders and Bob 
Christian. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was named coach at Miami on Dec. 1, 1989, he inherited a  
program that had won two games over the two previous seasons and 
went 5-5-1 in 1990. He had a winning record every season thereafter 
except 1993, when Miami went 4-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to coach at the highest level and I want to coach in  
the national championship,'' he said. ``I believe Northwestern is 
that kind of program.

<HEADLINE> Norfolk Southern, CSX To Close Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NORFOLK, Va. (AP) -- Norfolk Southern Corp. and CSX Corp. said  
Wednesday they will close their deal to acquire Conrail on June 1. 
The two Virginia railroads also will begin operating their 
respective portions of Conrail on that date. 
</P>
<P>
	Norfolk Southern is buying 58 percent of Philadelphia-based  
Conrail and Richmond-based CSX Corp. is buying the rest in a $10.3 
billion deal approved last summer by the federal Surface 
Transportation Board. The agreement took effect Aug. 22. 
</P>
<P>
	The railroads said customer service planning, capital  
improvement projects, employee training and labor agreements needed 
for the deal are largely complete, while old and new computers are 
being tested to make sure they can communicate. 
</P>
<P>
	The June 1 date allows enough time to make sure operations will  
be seamless and safe, the companies said. 
</P>
<P>
	The restructuring will introduce competition to several  
Northeastern markets for the first time since 1976, when Conrail 
began operating as a monopoly created by Congress out of six 
bankrupt railroads. 
</P>
<P>
	After closing the deal, Norfolk-based Norfolk Southern will  
operate 7,200 miles of Conrail routes, creating a 21,600-mile rail 
system serving 22 states in the East, as well as Washington, D.C. 
and Ontario, Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	CSX will operate 4,000 miles of Conrail routes, resulting in a  
22,300-mile rail system serving 23 states east of the Mississippi, 
Washington, D.C. and Montreal and Ontario, Canada.

<HEADLINE> Tokyo Stock Prices Advance / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks advanced today, buoyed largely by  
reports that some ruling party legislators were calling for 
injection of public funds into real estate to stimulate the 
economy. The dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 257.61 points,  
or 1.87 percent, ending the day at 14,028.05. On Tuesday, the 
average closed down 34.62 points, or 0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.40 yen at late afternoon, down 0.64 yen  
from late Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level 
of 113.49 yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	On the stock market, traders said the afternoon rally was fueled  
by a report in Britain's Financial Times that a group of 
legislators in the Liberal Democratic Party was proposing that 20 
trillion yen ($176 billion) of public funds be injected into the 
real estate market to stimulate activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Such proposals have been made in the past, but traders  
nevertheless jumped on the report to buy property developer issues, 
traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expectations rose for a radical handling of the bad debt  
problem in the real estate market,'' said Kenji Karikomi, deputy 
general manager at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	The market was also supported by other reports that suggested  
further consolidation within Japan's banking industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese news media reported that Sanwa Bank Ltd. and Toyo Trust  
and Banking Co. have reached a basic agreement to form alliance in 
the pension business, sending investors to buy banking issues. 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks later officially announced the agreement.  
</P>
<P>
	Japan's banking industry is strugginng to dispose of mountains  
of bad loans left from the collapse of property price in the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Toyo Trust ended the day up 19 yen (17 cents) to 280 ($2.48) and  
Sanwa Bank up 34 yen (30 cents) to 1,020 ($9.03). 
</P>
<P>
	Share prices fell slightly in the morning session as players  
showed skepticism about Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi's optimism on 
Japan's economy. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, players were paying more attention to  
overseas developments, including testimony by Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan later today in the United States and the 
Brazilian economy, traders said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most selling came from short term interbank players who bought  
the yen, said Shuji Takano, assistant foreign exchange manager at 
ABN-Amro Bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section was up 5.27 points, or 1.42 percent, to 1,090.07. The 
TOPIX closed down 0.99 points, or 0.09 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 203 10-year Japanese  
government bond fell to 1.770 percent from Tuesday's finish of 
1.865 percent, driving its price up to 100.24 yen from 99.47 yen.

<HEADLINE> Housing Starts Rise to 11-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Housing construction shot to 11-year highs in  
both December and all of 1998, propelled by record home sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders started construction on new units at a seasonally  
adjusted annual rate of 1.72 million units last month, up 3.5 
percent from November and the most since March 1987, the Commerce 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Unseasonably mild weather during the early part of December  
helped boost housing starts, particularly in the Midwest, where 
they soared 25 percent to a seasonally adjusted rate of 414,000, 
the most in nearly 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But fundamental economic conditions -- plentiful employment,  
rising income, low mortgage rates -- are driving most of the 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, builders began work on 1.62 million units, up  
9.6 percent from 1997 and the most since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of builders this month by the National Association of  
Home Builders shows they are optimistic -- but not quite as 
optimistic -- as they were during November and December. In 
particular, their expectations for home sales six months from now 
were lower. 
</P>
<P>
	But, in 1998, housing was supported by mortgage rates holding  
below 7 percent for much of the year, the lowest sustained level 
since the 1960s, and by an average unemployment rate at a 29-year 
low of 4.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, record stock-market levels helped some home buyers with  
down payments, particularly for trade-up and vacation homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Regionally in 1998, starts increased 10.5 percent in the South  
to 741,000, 9.2 percent in the Midwest to 331,000, 8.6 percent in 
the Northeast to 149,000 and, in the West, also 8.6 percent, to 
395,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Starts of single-family homes rose 12 percent to 1.27 million  
and starts of apartments increased 1.7 percent to 346,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, in addition to the big gain in the Midwest, starts  
increased 3.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
158,000 in the Northeast and 3.1 percent to a rate of 428,000 in 
the West. They fell 5.6 percent to a rate of 720,000 in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Single-family home starts edged 0.7 percent lower to a rate of  
1.36 million in December while apartment starts jumped 23 percent 
to a rate of 363,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Building permit applications -- a barometer of future  
construction -- rose 4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 1.72 million in December, a nine-year high.

<HEADLINE> Coca-Cola May Launch Clothing Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Coca-Cola, the world's biggest soft-drink maker,  
plans to introduce a line of fashion and sports clothing that will 
be marketed worldwide, the Financial Times reported in Thursday's 
editions. 
</P>
<P>
	The Atlanta-based company, which controls nearly half of the  
global soft-drink market, is signing up franchise and retail 
partners worldwide to sell the Coca-Cola Wear line, expected to 
include ``jeans, sports clothing and other casual items,'' the 
newspaper said. 
</P>
<P>
	Britain will be the first European market for the new line,  
which will be sold in department stores and fashion outlets. The 
Times did not say when the clothing would hit the stores. 
</P>
<P>
	``The range will be designed to connect back with the brand,''  
the newspaper quoted a company spokesman as saying. ``The clothes 
will reflect Coca-Cola's values of authenticity, genuineness and 
part of people's lives.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Coke already licenses the use of its logo, can design and other  
symbols for more than 10,000 products, including clothing, in 40 
countries. But this will be the first time the company has used its 
brand name to market products that are not primarily designed to 
display its logo.

<HEADLINE> Super Bowl Tempting for Gamblers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- For compulsive gamblers, this is a dangerous time.  
</P>
<P>
	The Super Bowl represents a way to win back the money lost on  
all those bad bets made during the season. And that's why, experts 
say, the big game is so tempting and the consequences can be so 
dire. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a very stressful time,'' said Pat Fowler, executive  
director of the Florida Council on Compulsive Gambling. ``Not just 
for the gambler, but people living with them. It's extremely 
stressful and a sometimes abusive time for family members.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The council's New Jersey chapter estimates that at least $85  
million will be wagered legally on the Denver Broncos or Atlanta 
Falcons when they meet in Miami on Jan. 31. Another $4 billion will 
be bet illegally through bookies, office pools and between friends. 
</P>
<P>
	For compulsive gamblers -- with the game hyped nearly everywhere  
and office betting pools almost mandatory -- trying to stay on the 
wagon is not easy. 
</P>
<P>
	``Here I am trying to remain abstinent and here comes a pal at  
the office, asking, 'Where's your money for the pool? You can't be 
the only one in the office who doesn't participate,''' Fowler said 
of the typical gambler. ``Their futures, their families are being 
threatened by being in this environment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The council has found that many women who get hooked on gambling  
become initiated by the office betting pool at Super Bowl time or 
during the Final Four college basketball tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Talley, a reformed gambler and counselor in St. Petersburg,  
said his business always picks up immediately after the Super Bowl. 
The game often is seen as a panacea by the problem bettor. 
</P>
<P>
	``We get more calls after Super Bowl than any other time of the  
year,'' Talley said. ``This is the last hurrah. Some people are 
going to put it all on the last game. And that's when the calls 
start coming in because you are going to lose. All compulsive 
gamblers do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The days leading to the Super Bowl offer an opportunity for  
authorities to uncover gambling rings. Police in Broward County, 
just north of Miami, confiscated $93,000 this week and arrested 
seven people from four bookmaking sites. 
</P>
<P>
	One Orlando man knows how devastating gambling can be. He would  
wager anywhere between $25,000 to $50,000 a week. Eventually, his 
life came crashing down. 
</P>
<P>
	``You alienate the people closest to you,'' said Paul, who spoke  
only on condition his surname was not used. ``Your money is 
controlled by your betting. You hold back money that you might use 
to improve your financial situation. It takes over your whole life. 
It's like a drug. You don't care about your family or anything. You 
just want to get a bet down.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greed is not on the problem gambler's mind. Paul, who had won  
fortunes only to lose them, said he craved the excitement. When he 
won, he said, he felt like ``a big shot.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Those unwilling to accept their problem can bottom out at this  
time of year. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you don't get treatment you are going to get back into the  
gambling, you are going to ruin your life and end up in jail or 
committing suicide,'' said Ed Looney, who runs the Trenton, N.J., 
chapter of the council. 
</P>
<P>
	Compulsive sports gambling is increasing, he said, thanks partly  
to the proliferation of Internet betting sites. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had a 22-year old kid call three months ago. He had maxed  
out his father's credit card at $18,000 gambling on sports on the 
Internet,'' Looney said. ``His mom called crying on telephone, 
asking: 'Is this legal? Can I get my money back?''' 
</P>
<P>
	Talley was flying this week to Michigan to counsel a problem  
gambler who had embezzled from the family business and pilfered his 
retirement and children's college funds. 
</P>
<P>
	``I can testify that life is great after quitting gambling,''  
said Talley, who had to take a second mortgage to repay his debt 
after kicking the habit. ``Gamblers are very talented people, they 
average an IQ of 120 or better. They just have this horrible 
disease.''

<HEADLINE> Williams Accepts Doak Walker Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Ricky Williams said he would be happy wherever he  
plays pro football. His mother is more discriminating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really care where I play, I just want to go and play  
football,'' the Heisman Trophy winner said Tuesday night before 
receiving his second Doak Walker Award as the nation's top college 
running back. ``I'm sure I'll have fun wherever I go, and I'll be 
on a decent team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sandy Williams said she wants her son to be either the first  
player chosen in the April NFL draft, by Cleveland, or go to the 
Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' mother and Ricky's two sisters, Cassie, 21, and Nisey,  
20, who now live in Austin, visited the Cowboys' training facility 
on Tuesday, and she had a message for owner Jerry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to leave a note: `Dear Jerry, please draft my son.  
Love, Sandy,''' Sandy Williams said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams received his Walker trophy at a banquet of the SMU  
Athletic Forum, which also gave former University of Kansas and 
Chicago Bears star halfback Gale Sayers a special award for retired 
athletes who contribute to their communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sayers and other former greats chipped in their advice for  
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make sure that he's in training camp on time,'' Sayers said.  
``Pro football is a Grand Canyon above college football ... and 
he's a marked man coming in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got what it takes,'' said former Dallas star Tony  
Dorsett, whose NCAA career rushing record was broken by Williams. 
``But you've got to be put in the right system, you've got to stay 
healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll have a long, productive career if he goes to a team with  
balance'' between running and throwing the ball, said former SMU 
and New England Patriots runner Craig James. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he goes to Philadelphia (which holds the second pick),  
defenses will play 8-man lines and stuff him,'' James warned. 
``He'll have a good career wherever he goes, but this is a guy who 
could be special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the draft, Williams will give baseball another shot.  
He signed a one-year contract with the Texas Rangers on Tuesday and 
will report to the team's spring-training camp in Florida next 
month. But he apparently has no illusions about becoming a football 
and baseball star like Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have so far to go in baseball ... I'm just trying to keep  
getting better,'' said Williams, who played A-league ball last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he was especially honored to win the Doak Walker  
Award again because he met Walker last year, striking up a 
friendship that crossed racial and generational lines. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Southern Methodist All-America and 1948 Heisman winner  
was paralyzed in a skiing accident and died last spring at 71. 
Williams, who wore 34 on his jersey as a Longhorns senior, honored 
Walker by wearing his number, 37, when Texas played Oklahoma at the 
Cotton Bowl -- ``the house that Doak built.''

<HEADLINE> Broncos' Schlereth Is Set To Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- His sliced-and-diced body tells him it's time to  
quit, but his heart won't let him. Mark Schlereth, a medical 
marvel, keeps going strong despite 21 operations. 
</P>
<P>
	On Jan. 31, the Denver Broncos offensive guard will once more  
block out his anatomical ruination and play in the Super Bowl, his 
third. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's who I am,'' he said Tuesday with a shrug.  
</P>
<P>
	Schlereth's latest surgery came last October, the 12th operation  
he has had on his left knee. Before that, he had bone chips removed 
from his left elbow in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, he has had 17 knee operations, including reconstructive  
surgery on his left knee in 1985. He has had three elbow surgeries 
and underwent back surgery to repair two herniated disks in 
November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlereth also was rushed to the hospital in 1995, where he  
passed a kidney stone. Hours later, he was playing in a Monday 
night game against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the injuries and operations, Schlereth had an even  
scarier moment. In 1993 he contracted Guillain-Barre syndrome, a 
neurological condition that left him tripping over himself, unable 
to play, with no feeling in his hands or legs. He missed the last 
seven games of that season but recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Unique recuperative abilities and an incredible tolerance for  
pain have marked Schlereth's 10-year pro career, which included six 
seasons in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors were unsure if he would be able to return from back  
surgery in November 1997, but he returned five games later and 
started in the line that contributed to the Broncos' Super Bowl win 
over Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	He tore cartilage in his left knee in Denver's first  
regular-season game this season but played in the next five games. 
He had arthroscopic surgery before a bye week and was back playing 
in 13 days without missing a snap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless he has the surgery the day of the game, I expect him to  
be back there each week, performing at a level like he's never 
missed a beat,'' Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe said. ``He's 
unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, Schlereth had a bone chip the size of a molar  
removed from his left elbow. The next day, he was back at training 
camp, carrying the bone chip in a plastic container in his 
knapsack, proudly showing it to teammates and reporters. He still 
keeps the bone chip at home, a souvenir of the injury that 
sidelined him for one preseason game. 
</P>
<P>
	In his locker he has posted a picture of debris removed from his  
elbow. Also hanging from his locker is a small bottle containing 
cartilage removed from his knee in his first operation in 1983, 
when he was in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	He could have avoided all those macabre memories, he admitted,  
by finding another line of work. 
</P>
<P>
	``In high school I could have said, `You know what, this ain't  
worth it,''' he said. ``But what are you going to do? This is what 
I've done my whole life. Even though I've been hurt, I've always 
felt I could play at a high level, and I always had a desire to be 
out there. And I still do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Pro Bowl selection with the Redskins in 1991, Schlereth has  
been a stalwart in the Denver line that protects John Elway and 
clears holes for Terrell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlereth, the first native born Alaskan to play in the NFL,  
conceded he is sore nearly every waking hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the morning, I just hobble around looking crippled for a  
while, and that's pretty much every day,'' he said. ``I always have 
a certain amount of pain and stiffness.

<HEADLINE> Charlotte Star Faces Elbow Surgery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHARLOTTE (AP) -- Glen Rice, the Charlotte Hornets' top scorer  
and a model of reliability since joining the team, needs elbow 
surgery that could sideline him for up to 1 1/2 months. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice, who averaged 21.6, 26.8 and 22.3 points while missing just  
six games the past three seasons, has a bone chip in his right 
elbow and plans to undergo arthroscopic surgery in the next few 
days. 
</P>
<P>
	Rice said doctors have told him the normal recovery time  
following the procedure is 3-6 weeks, meaning that if the surgery 
is done this week, he could miss nearly the first four weeks of the 
season. An absence of that length could amount to almost 20 games 
in what is expected to be a 50-game season. 
</P>
<P>
	``Not having Glen from the start will be a real challenge,''  
Hornets general manager Bob Bass said Tuesday. ``We are waiting for 
Glen to get some additional opinions on the injury.'' 
</P>
<P>
	One of the NBA's best 3-point shooters and an All-Star in each  
of the past two seasons, Rice has been wearing a neoprene sleeve on 
his right elbow for most of the past two years. Rice, who is 
right-handed, said he didn't consider the problem with the elbow 
anything more than minor until recently, when increasing stiffness 
and pain prompted him to see a doctor. The bone chip was discovered 
by a magnetic resonance imaging test. 
</P>
<P>
	The injury marks the first time in his pro career that Rice, 31,  
will be sidelined for a significant length of time. He has missed 
just 20 games in nine NBA seasons and has played 240 of a possible 
246 regular season games since joining the Hornets in November 
1995, including all 82 last year. 
</P>
<P>
	In Rice's absence, Charlotte will look to several sources for  
offense, including free-agent center Derrick Coleman, who has 
agreed to join the Hornets once the lockout ends. 
</P>
<P>
	Bobby Phills, Charlotte's starting shooting guard, could be  
rotated into Rice's small forward spot. Phills could be replaced 
temporarily at guard by free-agent Eldridge Recasner, who is 
negotiating a four-year, $5 million deal with the Hornets. 
</P>
<P>
	The odd man out for the Hornets could be shooting guard Dell  
Curry, 34, the only remaining member of the 10-year-old franchise. 
Curry, a free agent, is seeking a three-year deal, but Charlotte 
appears unwilling to accommodate him.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Congress OKs Reform Measure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BRASILIA, Brazil (AP) -- Brazil's lower house of Congress passed  
an important austerity measure Wednesday, giving a strong, timely 
boost to the government's efforts to right the nation's ailing 
economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chamber of Deputies voted 335-147 to pass a bill to cut  
federal pensions. The Senate must also vote on the measure, and its 
president, Antonio Carlos Magalhaes, said preparations for a vote 
will begin immediately. 
</P>
<P>
	The controversial pension cuts, previously rejected by the  
Chamber four times, affect about 300,000 retirees, cutting their 
benefits and saving the government an estimated $2.5 billion a 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	More important than any savings, however, was the message that  
the bill's passage sends to international investors -- that Congress 
is willing to embrace the measures deemed essential to 
reinvigorating Latin America's largest economy. 
</P>
<P>
	``The vote demonstrates Congress's understanding of Brazil's  
deepest problems,'' said President Fernando Henrique Cardoso 
minutes after voting ended. ``The deputies demonstrated the 
necessary firmness and feeling of urgency regarding the measure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, congressman and former Finance Minister Antonio Delfim  
Netto said that although he didn't agree with the measure, he would 
vote for it ``to stop the dollar going through the roof.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition party deputies took a different view.  
</P>
<P>
	``Any economist knows this vote will not resolve the (economic)  
situation,'' said Paulo Paim of the Worker's Party in Rio Grande do 
Sul. ``We're taking money from the elderly just to show foreign 
investors we're working on the crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The bill's passage gives the government a much-needed boost,  
showing investors that it can spur Congress into action on crucial 
economic reform measures. 
</P>
<P>
	The global financial crisis engulfed Brazil in August, when  
investors withdrew funds for fear the government would not be able 
to cover a $65 billion budget deficit and might default on its 
loans. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's recent problems in approving fiscal reforms  
helped rekindle investor fears. After spending billions of dollars 
in foreign reserves trying to prop up its overvalued currency, the 
real, Brazil began last week to take a series of steps to devalue 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	The real has lost about 24 percent of its value since then. On  
Wednesday, the real closed at 1.58 to the dollar, slightly weaker 
than Tuesday's close of 1.56. 
</P>
<P>
	The Sao Paulo Stock Exchange closed up 4 percent Wednesday. The  
smaller Rio de Janeiro Stock Exchange was closed due to a state 
holiday. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States fears that if Brazil succumbs to an  
Asian-style currency crisis, it could undermine other countries in 
the region -- and that would likely hurt the U.S. economy, which 
depends on Latin America as a major market for exports. 
</P>
<P>
	The president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, William  
McDonough, played down those fears Wednesday, saying that Brazil's 
economic crisis was not a threat to the U.S. financial system. He 
spoke after meeting in New York with Brazilian Finance Minister 
Pedro Malan. 
</P>
<P>
	Fernando Gabeira, an opposition congressman from Rio de Janeiro,  
said he supported the measure even though he thinks its importance 
has been blown out of proportion. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're trying to make us believe that the international  
financial system depends on Brazil cutting pensions,'' he said. 
``If that's the case there's something wrong with the international 
financial system.''

<HEADLINE> Unusual Russia Ballet Comes to N.Y. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *An AP Entertainment Review    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The Eifman Ballet, a ballet with indelible  
imagery, startling and striking in its inventiveness, strong 
dramatic conception and powerful dancers, has opened a two-week 
season at the City Center. 
</P>
<P>
	The full-length 1995 ballet ``The Karamazovs'' was danced  
Tuesday night by the company from St. Petersburg, Russia, as an 
American premiere. The expressed idea of choreographer Boris 
Eifman, who formed the company in 1977, is to present psychodrama, 
philosophy and interpretations instead of following the plot on 
which the dance is based. 
</P>
<P>
	In this case, it's Dostoyevsky's ``The Brothers Karamazov,'' the  
story about how a domineering father's death affects his sons. 
</P>
<P>
	It's interesting to note that this boldly presented ballet is  
done by a company that has never had a government subsidy. The 
company has toured widely in Europe and was in the United States 
last spring, stirring much interest in the dance community. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday's ``Karamazovs,'' the brothers are Dmitri (Yuri  
Ananyan), Ivan (Albert Galichanin) and Alexei (Igor Markov). Their 
gray-haired father, Fyodor, was danced by Andrei Gordeev. There are 
two ballerinas, Yelena Kuzmina and Vera Arbuzova, and a large corps 
of men and women. 
</P>
<P>
	Eifman choreographs with such physicality and intensity that his  
dancers are almost always moving with brutality, menace or passion. 
</P>
<P>
	Act 1 ends with Dmitri, accused of murdering his father, caught  
and held by other dancers in the center of a spider web of ropes 
that pulls him into the air. A two-story structure of metal bars 
becomes Dmitri's prison in Act 2. 
</P>
<P>
	The recorded music included the prelude to Wagner's  
``Tannhauser'' and some gypsy songs. But too much of the music 
sounded like a movie soundtrack reaching for a climax. 
</P>
<P>
	Like rich food, it may be possible to get too much of the  
flamboyant Eifman Ballet. But one evening is enormously impressive.

<HEADLINE> Woman Sentenced in Infants Death </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	COLLINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A woman who fatally stabbed her  
8-month-old daughter on Mother's Day was sentenced to 36 years in 
prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Sharon Alley, 29, stood quietly Tuesday during sentencing for  
felony child abuse and second-degree murder. She had pleaded 
guilty. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Alley was charged with abuse for throwing the baby, Brooke,  
across a room and fracturing her skull when the child was five 
weeks old. 
</P>
<P>
	She had lost custody of her children after the abuse charge, but  
regained custody after she and her husband, Bobby Alley, told a 
judge they planned to reconcile. Two months later, Brooke was dead. 
</P>
<P>
	An autopsy report concluded the girl died of a stab wound to the  
heart. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Alley's 9-year-old son, Eric, told the court Tuesday that he  
wanted his mother sentenced ``as high as it goes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Kimble Reynolds said medical and mental  
problems that arose during Ms. Alley's pregnancy lingered after the 
birth. ``The only thing she wants is some understanding of her 
condition,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In seeking the maximum 50-year sentence, prosecutor Bob Bushnell  
said Ms. Alley ``is capable of unspeakable evil.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Defense psychologist Evan Nelson said Ms. Alley suffered from  
postpartum depression at the time of the killing. But prosecution 
expert Joseph Leizer said Ms. Alley appeared mentally stable when 
he evaluated her 10 days after the slaying last May.

<HEADLINE> Housing Starts Rise to 11-Year High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Housing construction shot to 11-year highs in  
both December and all of 1998, propelled by record home sales. 
</P>
<P>
	Builders started construction on new units at a seasonally  
adjusted annual rate of 1.72 million units last month, up 3.5 
percent from November and the most since March 1987, the Commerce 
Department said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Unseasonably mild weather during the early part of December  
helped boost housing starts, particularly in the Midwest, where 
they soared 25 percent to a seasonally adjusted rate of 414,000, 
the most in nearly 12 years. 
</P>
<P>
	But fundamental economic conditions -- plentiful employment,  
rising income, low mortgage rates -- are driving most of the 
activity. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of 1998, builders began work on 1.62 million units, up  
9.6 percent from 1997 and the most since 1987. 
</P>
<P>
	A survey of builders this month by the National Association of  
Home Builders shows they are optimistic -- but not quite as 
optimistic -- as they were during November and December. In 
particular, their expectations for home sales six months from now 
were lower. 
</P>
<P>
	But, in 1998, housing was supported by mortgage rates holding  
below 7 percent for much of the year, the lowest sustained level 
since the 1960s, and by an average unemployment rate at a 29-year 
low of 4.5 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Plus, record stock-market levels helped some home buyers with  
down payments, particularly for trade-up and vacation homes. 
</P>
<P>
	Regionally in 1998, starts increased 10.5 percent in the South  
to 741,000, 9.2 percent in the Midwest to 331,000, 8.6 percent in 
the Northeast to 149,000 and, in the West, also 8.6 percent, to 
395,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Starts of single-family homes rose 12 percent to 1.27 million  
and starts of apartments increased 1.7 percent to 346,000. 
</P>
<P>
	In December, in addition to the big gain in the Midwest, starts  
increased 3.9 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 
158,000 in the Northeast and 3.1 percent to a rate of 428,000 in 
the West. They fell 5.6 percent to a rate of 720,000 in the South. 
</P>
<P>
	Single-family home starts edged 0.7 percent lower to a rate of  
1.36 million in December while apartment starts jumped 23 percent 
to a rate of 363,000. 
</P>
<P>
	Building permit applications -- a barometer of future  
construction -- rose 4 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate 
of 1.72 million in December, a nine-year high.

<HEADLINE> Miners Advance to Bucharest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TARGU JIU, Romania (AP) -- Thousands of striking coal miners  
headed for the capital today in buses, trucks and on foot to 
protest low wages and possible layoffs, defying government efforts 
to halt their advance. 
</P>
<P>
	An estimated 4,000 miners staged an early-morning rally in this  
central Romanian city on the third day of their march to Bucharest, 
shouting ``Down with the government!'' and ``We won't be lied to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Some 400 miners set off on foot to the capital, 150 miles to the  
east, where police were on alert. In two previous visits to the 
capital in 1990 and 1991, nine people were killed, dozens injured 
and one government was forced to resign in days of street violence. 
</P>
<P>
	Twenty-three people -- 15 miners and nine security officers --  
were injured in the first two days of the march, when riot police 
tried to stop miners by spraying tear gas, throwing smoke bombs and 
erecting roadblocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Hundreds of riot troops in dozens of large military vehicles  
stationed near Horezu, 50 miles east of Targu Jiu, planned to try 
to stop the miners' advance today, according to broadcast reports. 
</P>
<P>
	Miners who rode open trucks waved flags and cheered. They are  
led by the fiery Miron Cozma, whom authorities accuse of having a 
political agenda. Cozma is a member of an opposition extremist 
Greater Romania Party. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are on a peaceful march,'' said Romeo Beja, a miners'  
leader on private television station PRO-TV. ``Our aim in going to 
the capital is to get what we are demanding.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miners are demanding 35 percent wage hikes and the equivalent of  
$10,000 severance pay if they are laid off, which the government 
says it cannot afford. 
</P>
<P>
	Calling the miners' demands ``absurd,'' Prime Minister Radu  
Vasile said Tuesday that Romania is burdened by debts of $3 billion 
it has to pay back this year. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the 16-day-old dispute is politically motivated and  
claimed miners are jeopardizing Romania's future and credibility.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Mission Faces Critical Voices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LUANDA, Angola (AP) -- Outside the heavily guarded U.N. compound  
on the edge of this port city, it is hard to find anyone who has a 
kind word for the U.N. mission monitoring Angola's failed peace 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	Both the government and UNITA rebels -- the parties to the 1994  
U.N.-brokered peace deal that ended a two-decade civil war -- have 
accused the United Nations of failing to secure the peace. Many 
Angolans agree. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.N. observer mission spent four years overseeing  
implementation of the agreement, including the disarmament and 
demobilization of the rebel forces and the establishment of a 
multiparty democracy. 
</P>
<P>
	But U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan has proposed that the  
world body withdraw its 1,000 staff members from this southwest 
African nation where savage fighting restarted last month, 
shattering the peace pact. 
</P>
<P>
	The army has suffered some resounding defeats since the war  
resumed, prompting government anger at the United Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The government says that, under the nose of the United Nations,  
UNITA secretly maintained a 30,000-strong fighting force and spent 
millions of dollars on sophisticated modern weaponry, including 
tanks and long-range artillery, bought on the black market. 
</P>
<P>
	Mauricio Gomes, a taxi driver in the capital, Luanda, said the  
United Nations had done more harm than good. 
</P>
<P>
	``They let (UNITA leader) Jonas Savimbi keep his troops and even  
allowed him time to rearm and prepare for war,'' Gomes said. 
``Where was the U.N. while he was doing that?'' 
</P>
<P>
	UNITA, too, turned hostile to the United Nations after the  
Security Council imposed sanctions on the group -- including 
freezing its bank accounts -- for failing to comply with the peace 
accord. 
</P>
<P>
	The group had refused to hand over territory still under its  
control, accusing the government of committing human rights abuses 
in areas already yielded. Those claims were corroborated by U.N. 
observers. 
</P>
<P>
	Issa Diallo, the U.N. special representative to Angola, insists  
that the U.N. observer mission has no reason to be ashamed of its 
work. 
</P>
<P>
	He points to the unity government, which embraces officials from  
both factions, and the functioning parliament as evidence of 
progress. 
</P>
<P>
	But Alberto Neto, the leader of the Angolan Democratic Party who  
placed third in the 1991 presidential election, says those two 
entities failed to eliminate the deeper problems of a country that 
continues to be run by a deeply corrupt elite. 
</P>
<P>
	Neto blames not the mission, but its mandate.  
</P>
<P>
	``The United Nations has just been a monitor, not an enforcer,  
and it couldn't hold the two sides to their deal,'' Nato said, 
adding that the United Nations would need a 20,000-strong, 
rapid-intervention force to implement any peace deal in Angola. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you put water and oil in a bottle, they won't mix no matter  
how much you shake it. That is the government and UNITA,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Neto said the mission should have brought other political  
parties and independent civic leaders into the peace process, 
thereby dissipating the rivalry. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil war first erupted in Angola after its 1975 independence  
from Portugal. A 1991 peace deal between the government and UNITA -- 
a Portuguese acronym for the National Union for the Total 
Independence of Angola -- collapsed the following year when the 
rebels rejected their defeat at the ballot box. 
</P>
<P>
	The United Nations spent $1.5 billion over the past four years  
and initially deployed 7,000 staff members in Angola. Its mission 
came to be seen as an acid test of its peacemaking credibility, 
especially in the tumultuous world of African politics. 
</P>
<P>
	Annan wants the United Nations to leave Angola in an orderly  
fashion, so as not to give the impression that it is fleeing. 
Either way, it is leaving under a hail of criticism.

<HEADLINE> Bush Worried About White House Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Gov. George W. Bush, weighing whether to  
seek the presidency in 2000, is hearing from a small group of 
Texans who aren't so eager for him to run: His family. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm reluctant. Absolutely,'' said his wife, Laura, at a news  
conference Thursday with her husband. The couple's twin 17-year-old 
daughters also are worried about losing their privacy in the ``meat 
grinder'' of national politics, the governor told reporters at the 
same event. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, the twice-elected Bush is seriously considering a White  
House bid, and says nothing about his private life would disqualify 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had done anything in the past that would have  
disqualified me for being in public office, you'd have found it,'' 
he said. ``When I put my hand on the Bible and was sworn to uphold 
the laws of the land of the state, I also implicitly said I'd 
uphold the dignity of the office I was elected to, and I have done 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While the governor lingers on the sidelines, other presidential  
prospects are busy lining up political talent. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., has tapped veteran operative Rick  
Davis to manage his presidential exploratory committee. If, as 
expected, McCain formally becomes a candidate, Davis would be his 
campaign manager. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain called Davis ``a very experienced political hand'' who  
would be an asset to any campaign. ``I am honored that Rick has 
chosen mine,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Davis worked in the 1980 and 1984 campaigns of Ronald Reagan,  
serving in the former president's administration. He was debate 
coordinator for George Bush in the 1988 presidential campaign and 
convention manager for 1996 GOP presidential nominee Bob Dole. 
</P>
<P>
	Representatives for Dole's wife, Elizabeth, had talked with  
Davis about possibly working for her. The former Cabinet secretary 
is determining whether she has the support to seek the GOP 
nomination. 
</P>
<P>
	She plans to travel Feb. 8 to New Hampshire, a critical  
presidential state. 
</P>
<P>
	On the Democratic side, House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt of  
Missouri is almost certain not to challenge Vice President Al Gore 
for the Democratic nomination, allies said Thursday. They say he 
has not quite finalized the decision, but will soon make his 
intentions known. 
</P>
<P>
	Several GOP presidential candidates will be in Washington this  
week to address the Conservative Political Action Conference. Lamar 
Alexander, the former Tennessee governor who failed to win the 
nomination in 1996, plans to attack Bush for espousing 
``compassionate conservatism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A text of his speech, obtained by The Associated Press, reminds  
the audience that Bush's father also had a label for his ideology: 
``kinder and gentler.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Not long after we qualified our language, we were qualifying  
our principles,'' Alexander says. ``We accepted a tax increase -- 
violating the bedrock conservative principle of lower taxes and 
smaller government -- and soon found ourselves vacating the White 
House for the first time in 12 years.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush dismissed the criticism.  
</P>
<P>
	``Some people choose to campaign based on what they believe and  
some people choose to campaign on talking about the other person,'' 
the governor said at the news conference. 
</P>
<P>
	Told that Alexander was asking Bush to simply call himself a  
conservative -- with no modifier -- the governor said, ``I'm a 
conservative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sitting behind a small table in a corner of a small room at the  
governor's mansion, the Bushes answered a wide range of questions 
from state and local reporters one day after his inauguration. 
</P>
<P>
	Though close advisers say he is likely to run, Bush left himself  
some wiggle room by saying his family's concerns will be heavily 
weighed. 
</P>
<P>
	``My daughters are normal. They don't want to be put through the  
meat grinder of national politics and I understand that,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Bush, not often quoted about her reluctance, said, ``I just  
think it's a major life change. We have a very nice life in 
Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She said she is not concerned about the family's safety.  
``Privacy,'' she said. ``I'm very worried about privacy. That's the 
main thing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bush, who is actively courting supporters and donors in  
the event that he runs, sounds like a man on the brink of a 
presidential bid. 
</P>
<P>
	He said, for example, that this might be his one and only shot  
at the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``Should I choose not to run for president, I understand the  
window of opportunity might close,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Those are the types of answers that leave supporters like Ralph  
Brown awaiting a Bush bid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm inclined to think that when a decision is made, he will  
run,'' said Brown, a GOP activist in Iowa. ``But that decision has 
not been made in an ironclad way yet.''

<HEADLINE>  Clinton Takes Message on the Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Riding a bump in the polls, President  
Clinton argued vigorously Wednesday for his plan to save the budget 
surplus for protecting Social Security, saying it will give the 
nation stronger economic footing ``long after I'm gone from the 
White House.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Joined by the vice president and both their wives, Clinton  
promoted the agenda he revealed in his State of the Union address 
at the first public rally since Clinton was impeached Dec. 19. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he is ready for a major clash with Congress over  
whether some 60 percent of the federal surplus he anticipates -- $4 
trillion over 15 years -- should be reserved for shoring up Social 
Security or go for a tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to have a big argument about this, and we  
should,'' he said. ``It may sound good if somebody says this is 
your surplus and we ought to give it back to you. What I'm trying 
to do is give you a way to maximize the chances that we will have a 
strong economy'' in the future, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, at a rally in Norristown, Pa., Clinton said he did not  
oppose tax cuts, as long as they are targeted. ``Yes, we ought to 
give some tax cuts. But they ought to be the right kind,'' Clinton 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	If his Social Security plan is approved, Clinton said, the  
nation will continue to prosper. ``And long after I'm gone from the 
White House, you would have ... a better future,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's job approval rating got a lift following Tuesday  
night's speech and ranged from 66 percent to 76 percent, according 
to several network polls. His approval ratings also rose. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnstorming by ``all four principals,'' as the two Clintons and  
two Gores are known among White House staff, was unusual. Except 
for big-ticket party fund-raisers and personal outings, the 
foursome has not really traveled together and appeared as a package 
deal since the 1996 campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	A crowd of 21,790 greeted the visitors from Washington at the  
Marine Midland Arena in Buffalo. The White House said it was the 
largest group Clinton has addressed since last year's post-State of 
the Union appearance in LaCrosse, Wis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton has made several public appearances since he was  
impeached on Dec. 19, but all were before smaller and more 
exclusive audiences. 
</P>
<P>
	Noting financial upheaval in other parts of the world, Clinton  
said a tax cut right now could hurt efforts to sustain surpluses. 
Avoiding debt now, he said, means ``you would be somewhat more 
protected.'' The Republicans are calling for a 10 percent tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he believes Congress ultimately will see his side  
after healthy debate and negotiation involving not only lawmakers 
and the White House but the American people as well. 
</P>
<P>
	``I ask you to talk to your friends and neighbors about it,''  
Clinton told the crowd. ``When people come out and disagree with my 
approach, listen to them, sit down and have a discussion about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crowd fell quiet as Clinton spoke, offering only sporadic  
cheers as he rattled off his agenda. At one point, Clinton 
apologized for his tone. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sorry if I made the atmosphere too serious. We've had a  
lot of fun today,'' he said. ``But I want you to think about 
this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The president, the vice president and their wives lingered along  
the rope line greeting well-wishers. At one point, Clinton leapt up 
to slap hands with a little girl who was straining through the bars 
to greet him. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's travels were in keeping with Clinton's efforts to  
focus on the nation's business despite his impeachment trial in the 
Senate and underscored his intention to pursue what aides called an 
``activist agenda'' midway through his second term in office. 
</P>
<P>
	As Clinton's lawyers were set to renew their defense of the  
president in the impeachment proceedings, first lady Hillary Rodham 
Clinton heaped praise on her husband's record. The Rev. Bennett W. 
Smith offered an invocation ``in full support'' of Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	``Precious Master, comfort our president with your holy word,''  
he prayed, ``that no weapon formed against you shall prosper.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Vice President Al Gore underscored the uphill battle Clinton's  
proposals face in Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``Last night was a turning point for our country,'' Gore said,  
raising his voice. ``Are you going to fight for his agenda? That's 
what it's going to take!'' The crowd responded enthusiastically. 
</P>
<P>
	Gore and his wife, Tipper, and Mrs. Clinton were accompanying  
Clinton later in the day to a Norristown, Pa., high school rally. 
Meanwhile, members of Clinton's Cabinet were traveling on their own 
to highlight the president's initiatives. 
</P>
<P>
	The vice president was to continue the road show with Thursday  
appearances in Orlando and Tampa, Fla., to announce yet another 
series of Clinton budget initiatives: $110 million over five years 
to let states expand Medicaid coverage to community- and home-based 
long-term care; expanded tax credits and zero-interest bonds to 
help pay for billions in school construction costs; a $750-million 
plan to modernize public housing for the elderly.

<HEADLINE> Mich. Man Pleads in Escape Caper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MARTINSVILLE, Va. (AP) -- A man who fled from a Virginia jail  
term for selling $10 worth of marijuana 25 years ago and built an 
``exemplary'' life as a Michigan businessman pleaded guilty today 
to escape. 
</P>
<P>
	Commonwealth's Attorney Joan Ziglar said she will not make a  
recommendation for Alfred Odell Martin III's sentencing on Feb. 8. 
He faces up to five years in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin, 49, had served less than two days of a one-year sentence  
when he left a Martinsville jail work crew in 1974. He also stopped 
making payments on furniture and a television when he left to start 
a new life in Detroit -- where he married, raised three children and 
went to work for a mortgage company. 
</P>
<P>
	After Virginia sought his return last year, a judge handling the  
legal dispute in Detroit praised Martin as being ``exemplary'' and 
called his family ``a credit to Michigan,'' but ruled that he had 
no choice but to honor Virginia's request. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin's parents, who live in the Martinsville area, and five of  
his 14 brothers and sisters watched in the courtroom. 
</P>
<P>
	Jason Martin, the youngest of Martin's siblings, told reporters  
his brother was relieved that the case was nearing an end. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's glad all this is coming off his shoulders. He's always  
wanted to be able to come home to see his family. He's relieved 
he's home but not the way it's going on,'' Jason Martin said. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was returned to Martinsville on Dec. 9 to finish serving  
the drug sentence, Martin was charged with escape and larceny. 
Martinsville Circuit Judge Charles Stone dismissed the larceny 
charge Jan. 6 after Ms. Ziglar said Martin had paid the $819.25 he 
owed for the merchandise. 
</P>
<P>
	Martin originally was given a 10-year sentence with all but one  
year suspended. If he didn't escaped, Martin likely would have 
spent about three months in jail, Ms. Ziglar said.

<HEADLINE> ITC Finds Cattle Dumping Evidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The U.S. International Trade Commission has  
found evidence that American farmers might have been hurt by 
imports of live Canadian cattle. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision on Wednesday means the case now moves to the  
Commerce Department, which will investigate whether Canadian cattle 
have indeed been dumped or subsidized into this country at less 
than fair value. 
</P>
<P>
	``The crisis in the cattle industry is real and imports are part  
of the problem,'' said Leo McDonnell, president of the 
Ranchers-Cattlemen Action Legal Foundation, or R-CALF, which 
brought the trade petition. 
</P>
<P>
	Leland Swenson, president of the National Farmers Union, said,  
``Many family ranchers have already gone out of business due to low 
cattle prices and those who are still in business are barely making 
ends meet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In its petitions filed late last year, R-CALF charged Canada and  
Mexico with unfair policies in live cattle trade with United 
States. The commission's ruling found there was no indication of 
injury from imports from Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition process, though over a significant hurdle, is still  
far from over. A decision from Commerce is not expected until early 
May. Once the Commerce Department finishes its investigation, the 
case could go back to the ITC. 
</P>
<P>
	If successful, the R-CALF action could require foreign producers  
to sell their products at a fair price or importers to pay the 
difference to the U.S. government as an additional duty. 
</P>
<P>
	R-CALF supporters blame the North American Free Trade Agreement  
approved by Congress in 1993 for opening the gates to Canadian and 
Mexican imports -- many of which are believed to be subsidized by 
their governments -- without providing U.S. producers equal benefits 
in exports. 
</P>
<P>
	Many ranchers believe those imported cattle have driven down  
market prices in the United States and increased the financial 
pressure that can force cattle producers out of business. 
</P>
<P>
	Farm state lawmakers praised the ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	``This ruling is an important step forward in stopping unfair  
Canadian trade,'' said Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D. 
``It means that an independent international board has finally 
recognized that Canada is unfairly flooding the American market and 
that U.S. producers are being forced to compete on an unlevel 
playing field.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Dodges Impeachment Questions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Former President Bush, saying he wasn't going  
to get into current events, sidestepped remarking on the Senate 
impeachment trial of his successor on Wednesday. But he told 
senators he was concerned about a rising ``lack of civility in our 
political debate.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, the speaker at a Senate lecture series, called it ``a very  
traumatic time, a very busy time'' for the Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	Defeated by President Clinton in 1992 after serving one term,  
the former president reflected on his presidency and on his long 
political career. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had my chance to serve. And I did my best. I messed up some  
things and, hopefully, got some things right,'' Bush said in the 
address in the Old Senate Chamber, used by the Senate until the 
1850s. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier, at a picture-taking session with Senate Majority Leader  
Trent Lott, R-Miss., and Minority Leader Tom Daschle, D-S.D., Bush 
was asked by a reporter if he had any reflections on the 
impeachment trial taking place in the current Senate quarters. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have to admit, the timing is a little peculiar,'' he said.  
However, he added, ``I'm not going to go into current events.'' He 
suggested it would be beneath the dignity of the lecture series. 
</P>
<P>
	In his remarks, Bush told his audience of senators and invited  
guests, many of whom served in his administration, ``I have 
refrained from commenting on the serious matter now before the 
Senate -- and will continue to do so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he added, ``I confess that the lack of civility in our  
political debate and official dealings with one another concerns 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I worry, too, about sleaze -- about excessive intrusion into  
private lives,'' he said. He complained about ``tabloid journalism 
-- giving us sensationalism at best, smut at worst.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush, who also served eight years as vice president to President  
Reagan, said the most important Senate vote of his presidency was 
the 52-47 vote in January 1991 authorizing use of force in the 
Persian Gulf to drive Iraq out of Kuwait. So contentious was the 
issue at the time that some critics even discussed attempting to 
impeach him if he went to war without first obtaining congressional 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	``We honored Congress' right to be heard before a single shot  
had been fired,'' Bush said. The audience included Colin Powell, 
who was chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff at the time. Bush 
said he regretted having been unable to muster a wider margin in 
support of the war. 
</P>
<P>
	``But we stayed the course, and I hope history will say not only  
that we won, but that we won with honor,'' Bush said. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush said that in the days he presided over the Senate as vice  
president, he ``loved interacting with senators of both parties.'' 
Bush never served in the Senate -- he lost Senate races in 1964 and 
1970. But he served in the House, and as ambassador to the United 
Nations, CIA director and chairman of the Republican National 
Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	Lott noted that Bush's address came on the 10th anniversary of  
his being sworn in as the nation's 41st president. Playfully, Bush 
reminded Lott that it was also ``six years ago to this very day 
that I was sworn out of office.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Bush, who now lives in Houston with wife Barbara, said he  
has no regrets that his own political career has ended. 
</P>
<P>
	``Time has moved on. And in our family, the torch has passed to  
two boys,'' he said, referring to son George, who is governor of 
Texas and a possible presidential contender in 2000; and son Jeb, 
who is governor of Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	Bush joked that he did not feel qualified to ``lecture'' anyone  
in the Senate 
</P>
<P>
	``So to be clear, this is not a lecture. Nor is it a  
filibuster,'' he said. ``Speaking of filibusters, Barbara is sorry 
she couldn't be here this evening.''

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Resumes Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a second day before Senate jurors, White  
House lawyers are challenging contentions by House prosecutors that 
President Clinton lied to a federal grand jury and obstructed 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the defense resumed its rebuttal today in the historic  
impeachment trial, each party in the Senate and the prosecution 
team were to hold separate strategy sessions to prepare for the 
next steps: senators' written questions, a motion to dismiss the 
case and a decision on calling witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's White House arguments showed ``there are conflicts in  
testimony that witnesses might resolve,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, 
said today. He speculated that most of those who might be called 
could be helpful to Clinton's case. ``I don't know why the White 
House is so panic-stricken about it,'' he said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he doubts  
Clinton wants to call any witnesses in his behalf. ``I think he 
would be nuts if he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., opposing the calling of any  
witnesses, noted that key figures in the case have been interviewed 
numerous times already. ``They said the same thing each time,'' he 
told NBC. ``Why are we going through this again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	An invitation to the president to testify was still under  
discussion. At a meeting of Senate Republicans on Tuesday, Sen. 
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he thought Clinton could be compelled to 
testify under Senate rules and court decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said special counsel Gregory Craig would  
open today's trial session by attacking prosecutors' allegations 
that Clinton lied at least four times in his Aug. 17 grand jury 
appearance. The president contended then that he did not lie during 
his deposition a year ago in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case 
when he denied an affair with former White House intern Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	After Craig's presentation, White House Deputy Counsel Cheryl  
Mills was to argue against an obstruction-of-justice charge. She 
will maintain, for instance, that Clinton did not ask his 
secretary, Betty Currie, to retrieve presidential gifts from Ms. 
Lewinsky after they had been subpoenaed in December 1997 by the 
Mrs. Jones' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's trial session ended at midafternoon, providing a break  
before senators walked over to the House chamber to hear Clinton's 
State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deal with absurdities and contradictions around here every  
day,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Counsel Charles Ruff, in his opening remarks to the  
Senate on Tuesday, offered a point-by-point rebuttal to the House 
prosecution's case. Clinton, he said, did not lie under oath and 
did not try to obstruct Mrs. Jones' case by trying to keep Ms. 
Lewinsky from testifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff accused the House team of ``prosecutorial ... fudge'' on  
key evidence, and declared, ``We will defend the president on the 
facts and on the law and on the constitutional principles that must 
guide your deliberations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats made a special point of praising Ruff's rebuttal to  
prosecutors' contention that a job search for Ms. Lewinsky was an 
attempt to keep her from revealing her affair with Clinton to Mrs. 
Jones' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff told the Senate that an order from the Jones trial judge,  
which was damaging to Clinton, was issued hours after presidential 
friend Vernon Jordan met with Ms. Lewinsky in an intensified effort 
to find her a job. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had left an impression that the order triggered the  
Lewinsky-Jordan meeting the morning of Dec. 11, 1997, Democrats 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people didn't know the order came ... late at night  
when Vernon Jordan was on an airplane,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, 
D-Iowa. ``He really poked some holes ... as big as a barn door in 
the prosecution's case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., speaking on the same point, asserted,  
``It is a very serious problem for the House of Representatives, 
which presented this fact erroneously. They made a representation 
that is a serious error.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans mostly held their fire after Ruff's presentation,  
offering few comments. But prosecutors struck back in written 
responses that contrasted the ``White House claim'' with ``the 
truth'' on a number of allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said of Ruff's presentation: ``He's  
done the best job with what is an inherently weak case.'' Rep. 
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said it was ``hard to buy'' denials that 
Clinton obstructed justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., one of the managers, said he didn't  
believe prosecutors ``should press the Senate'' for witnesses at 
this point, even though the prosecution team believes they're 
crucial to the House case. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson said he ``would welcome the opportunity for the  
president to testify'' and said Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan, Mrs. Currie 
and others would ``help resolve conflicts that have been raised by 
Mr. Ruff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff sharply attacked the prosecutors' case but did so mostly in  
a soft voice that only became emotional near the end of his 
two-hour presentation. His voice quavered as he responded to 
remarks last week by lead prosecutor Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who 
spoke of soldiers who died defending the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling that his father fought at Omaha Beach on D-Day, Ruff  
said: ``He didn't fight -- no one fought -- for one side of this case 
or the other. He fought as all those did for our country, our 
Constitution.''

<HEADLINE> Jagger Marriage Claim May Be Flawed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Rolling Stones frontman Mick Jagger may have  
``shot himself in the foot'' by claiming he never married Jerry 
Hall, a divorce specialist said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Jagger's publicity agents, LD Publicity, released a statement  
Monday saying the singer's lawyers were contesting the divorce 
petition filed by Texas-born model Jerry Hall ``on the grounds that 
Mick Jagger and Jerry Hall are not, and never have been, married.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But divorce attorney Mark Stephens said the English courts were  
unlikely to give credence to Jagger's claim that his 1990 
Indonesian marriage to Hall was not legally valid. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Mick Jagger will get pretty short shrift from the  
judiciary in this country and they'll not like it,'' Stephens said 
on the British Broadcasting Corp.'s morning news show. 
</P>
<P>
	Newspapers said Jagger's lawyers are expected to argue that the  
religious part of the Hindu marriage ceremony on the island of Bali 
was completed but not the civil part, and that consequently the 
marriage cannot be legally recognized in Britain. 
</P>
<P>
	Due to a two-day national holiday in Indonesia on Tuesday and  
Wednesday, marriage records were not immediately accessible. 
</P>
<P>
	Although their wedding ceremony took place in 1990, Jagger and  
Hall have been together for 21 years and have four children -- 
Elizabeth, 14; James, 13; Georgia May, 6; and 1-year-old Gabriel. 
</P>
<P>
	Stephens predicted the judiciary ``will be going out of their  
way to find Jerry Hall a fair settlement as she's entitled to and 
for the children and to make sure the children are properly looked 
after.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, family law attorney Hilary Siddle said that if the  
couple were not married, a court might treat them as co-habitees, 
who are not protected in the same way as divorcees. 
</P>
<P>
	Hall's divorce proceedings followed newspaper reports that  
Jagger was involved with 29-year-old Luciana Giminez Morad, whose 
mother claims Ms. Morad is five months pregnant with his child. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Morad's attorney, Raoul Felder of New York City, on Tuesday  
called threats of a lawsuit to prove paternity ``premature.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked why Ms. Morad had a lawyer, he said, ``Let's just say  
every single woman who is pregnant should have a lawyer as well as 
a gynecologist.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jagger was divorced from his first wife, Bianca, in 1979.

<HEADLINE> NBA Lockout Is Officially Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA lockout was officially settled this  
afternoon, and teams were told they can begin signing players, 
making trades and opening training camps at 2 p.m. EST Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an agreement, and we expect to have the deal signed  
tonight,'' league spokesman Chris Brienza said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams can immediately begin talking to their players, something  
that was forbidden since commissioner David Stern and union 
director Billy Hunter agreed two weeks ago on the terms of a new 
collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening night is less than 2 1/2 weeks away, and the NBA is  
expected to release a new schedule by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a relief to know it's behind us,'' new Chicago Bulls  
coach Tim Floyd said. ``We have a chance to sit down and visit with 
players, talk to players, which is what this is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Day 204 of the longest and costliest work  
stoppage in league history, the laborious task of reducing the 
settlement into written form hit a few last-minute snags after 
lawyers for the owners and players spent the whole night meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the rumors kept coming and the plots kept  
twisting as teams maneuvered to get ready for the scheduled Feb. 5 
start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll get done. It always gets done,'' agent David Falk said.  
``This just gives us more time to talk to people and refine our 
numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main sticking point between the sides had been whether the  
new middle-class exception can be used for a three-year contract 
(the league's contention) or a six-year contract (the union's 
contention). 
</P>
<P>
	The union won that argument, but a final snag developed over the  
league's insistence upon having discipline authority over agents 
involved in salary cap circumvention. Another snag concerned 
whether bonus money would be counted in trade calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known how those issues were resolved.  
</P>
<P>
	Rod Strickland, meanwhile, was miffed at the offer the  
Washington Wizards made. The Washington Post said the Wizards 
offered $30 million for three years, with two additional years 
non-guaranteed, and had given Strickland a deadline of midnight 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he'll be back here,'' Falk told The Associated  
Press today. ``We're trying to get him to New York. He loves it 
that they have (Latrell) Sprewell, Allan Houston and Larry Johnson 
there, and he thinks they can win a championship. I'd like to get 
him there so Patrick (Ewing) can win a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falk was exploring other options for Strickland, including  
several sign-and-trade deals that would send last season's NBA 
assist leader to another team. He said four or five teams were 
making bids, but refused to name anyone other than the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Rodman added a strange subplot to Tuesday's events as his  
agent, Dwight Manley, announced that Rodman was retiring. Hours 
later, the league's leading rebounder for the past seven seasons 
said he was more in a state of ``limbo'' than retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	And Antonio McDyess put off until today a decision on where  
he'll play -- Denver or Phoenix -- but several signs seemed to be 
pointing to the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It defies logic, in my opinion,'' Suns owner Jerry Colangelo  
said of the deliberations concerning McDyess. ``We think this is a 
great spot for him. He seemed very happy here. We love him as a 
young guy and a future star in this league. But a lot of things 
have happened this offseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tom Gugliotta rumors were strong, too, with the Nuggets,  
Suns and Lakers all interested. A source close to the Lakers said 
the team was offering Elden Campbell, Eddie Jones and rookie Sam 
Jacobsen to the Timberwolves in a sign-and-trade deal for 
Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets were wondering whether they would be spurned by  
Gugliotta in the event that McDyess stays in Phoenix. If so, they 
were expected to look to sign free-agent center Vlade Divac. 
</P>
<P>
	But no event symbolized Tuesday's craziness like the  
``retirement'' of Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to play this year,'' Rodman told Fox Sports  
News. ``I am in limbo, but I'm not going to say I'm retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not how his former coach heard it. In a strange twist  
earlier in the day, Chuck Daly of the Orlando Magic said he heard 
Rodman was traded to the New York Knicks for Buck Williams -- a 
rumor that was quickly shot down. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, it was learned that John Starks and Chris Mills  
are the players who will be traded from the Knicks to the Golden 
State Warriors for Latrell Sprewell. Word of the Sprewell trade got 
out Monday night, just a few hours after another major trade was 
revealed -- Scottie Pippen from the Chicago Bulls to the Houston 
Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls also have sign-and-trade deals worked out for Luc  
Longley and Steve Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo confirmed that the Suns will trade three of the five  
players they have under contract -- Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and 
Bubba Wells -- for Longley. 
</P>
<P>
	In another agreed-upon deal, the Seattle SuperSonics were set to  
send center Jim McIlvaine to the New Jersey Nets for veteran 
forwards Michael Cage and Don MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Jazz were expected to sign Nuggets free-agent forward  
Johnny Newman, who would take the place of free agent Chris Morris. 
The Jazz also went looking for another big man after learning that 
Greg Foster fractured an ankle. Utah was believed to have spoken to 
Chicago about a sign-and-trade deal involving Bill Wennington, 
although no trade agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Heat and Golden State Warriors, who couldn't agree on  
a Sprewell deal, nonetheless continued to discuss several 
multiplayer deals. Heat coach Pat Riley was thought to have 
interest in reuniting with Starks, and a deal was being discussed 
that would send Brent Barry, Terry Mills and Duane Causwell to the 
Warriors for Clarence Weatherspoon, Tony Delk and Felton Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports of a possible Starks-Barry deal, but it would  
not work under the salary cap in the league's complicated trade 
rules.

<HEADLINE> Ca. Freeze Won't Hurt Fla. Growers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LAKELAND, Fla. (AP) -- The Christmas-week freeze that devastated  
California's citrus crops is not likely to have a negative effect 
on Florida growers, according to state agricultural officials. 
</P>
<P>
	California, which sells 95 percent of its drier, easier-to-peel  
oranges as fresh, is expected to lose nearly $500 million of its 
crop due to the freeze. Some growers are trying to cut their losses 
by converting some of the fruit to juice. 
</P>
<P>
	And that had some Florida officials concerned that juice prices  
could drop, hurting Florida growers who typically sell 95 percent 
of their crop as juice. 
</P>
<P>
	But Ivy Leventhal, spokeswoman for the Florida Department of  
Citrus, said she does not expect that to happen. 
</P>
<P>
	``They produce such an infinitesimal amount (of juice) compared  
to what we produce that we don't expect that to affect us,'' she 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Florida is expected to produce about 190 million boxes of  
oranges this year, compared to 38 million boxes in California. 
Before the freeze, it was predicted that California would produce 
up to 62 million boxes. 
</P>
<P>
	According to Robert R. Terry, agricultural statistics  
administrator for the Florida Department of Agriculture, Florida 
will sell ``a few more'' fresh oranges than usual at slightly 
higher prices, but he does not expect any dramatic increases. 
</P>
<P>
	Consumers did see an increase in juice prices last month, but  
Leventhal said that was due to a smaller than expected Florida crop 
caused by wet conditions last winter and extreme heat over the 
summer.

<HEADLINE> Cooke Can't Bid for Redskins </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- If NFL owners still want John Kent Cooke to  
buy the Washington Redskins, they'll have to turn down the people 
who outbid him first. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press learned Wednesday that trustees overseeing  
the sale of the Redskins will tell the league's finance committee 
that they can only submit one bid -- the $800 million offer from 
Howard and Edward Milstein and Daniel Snyder -- when the two sides 
meet next week before the Super Bowl in Miami. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have a binding agreement,'' said a source connected with  
the trustees who requested anonymity. ``If a bidder put in a bid 
for $900 million today, we couldn't accept it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, NFL senior vice president Joe Browne said the  
finance committee believes that the trustees' proposals should 
include a bid from Cooke, who has represented the Redskins at team 
meetings since the early 1980s and is well-liked by the owners, 
three-fourth of whom must approve the sale. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's some amount of sympathy for his position,'' said  
Denver Broncos president and finance committee member Pat Bowlen. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke's father, Jack Kent Cooke, was the majority owner of the  
Redskins from 1974 until his death in April 1997. When he was 
alive, the elder Cooke indicated that he would leave the team to 
his son. Instead, his will directed that the Redskins and Jack Kent 
Cooke Stadium be sold and that the proceeds be used to establish a 
charitable foundation. 
</P>
<P>
	Two sources told the AP that Cooke was unable to win the bidding  
war for the Redskins even though the trustess were ``more than 
fair'' to Cooke and ``bent over backwards'' to keep him in the 
process. 
</P>
<P>
	In the end, Cooke was able to piece together a heavily leveraged  
$680 million bid, $150 million more than the record $530 million 
paid for the Cleveland Browns last year but $120 million short of 
the Milstein-Snyder bid. 
</P>
<P>
	At next week's meeting, the trustees will explain to the finance  
committee the details of the bidding process and how the winner was 
selected. The full NFL ownership could vote on the Milstein-Snyder 
bid as early as Feb. 16 in Atlanta. 
</P>
<P>
	Cooke's only hope is that the owners find a reason to turn down  
the Milstein-Snyder bid, but the trustees have said the bid meets 
all NFL guidelines.

<HEADLINE> Md. Police Paramedic in Civil Court </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- A Maryland State Police paramedic who sought  
parental leave after his daughter's birth was told by a boss that 
wouldn't happen unless his wife were ``dead or in a coma,'' his 
lawyer said at a civil trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Knussman repeatedly asked for leave to care for his  
newborn daughter and ailing wife, who suffered serious 
complications in her pregnancy, lawyer Robin Cockey said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Each time, he was rudely rebuffed, she said.  
</P>
<P>
	``(Knussman) was taking care of his child and he was taking care  
of his sick wife,'' Cockey said. ``He was the primary provider.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knussman and the American Civil Liberties Union say in their  
lawsuit that state police violated his rights and broke federal and 
state laws allowing parents time off to care for newborns. 
</P>
<P>
	In court papers, Knussman said one request was rejected by a  
supervisor who said, ``God decided only women can give birth.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Knussman was expected to testify today.  
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Donald Hoffman said police could only grant  
Knussman 10 days off, the maximum possible leave for ``secondary'' 
caregivers or parents who are not mainly responsible for the care 
of newborn children. 
</P>
<P>
	Maryland law says state employees who are ``primary'' caregivers  
can get 12 weeks of parental leave, but Hoffman said the law 
doesn't clearly define what a primary caregiver is. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal law mandates up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave a year for  
occasions such as the birth or adoption of a child or the need to 
care for a sick relative. The law applies to workers in state 
agencies or companies with large numbers of employees. 
</P>
<P>
	The presiding judge earlier denied Knussman's request to seek  
reparations from the state but allowed him to seek damages from 
individuals if he can show they violated his rights. Defendants 
include three of Knussman's superiors and a police administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	As a result of a complication late in her pregnancy in 1994,  
Knussman's wife suffered high blood pressure, swelling and kidney 
problems. Doctors said she needed several weeks of bed rest after 
the birth of their daughter, Paige, according to Cockey. The mother 
was eventually hospitalized.

<HEADLINE> Court Hears Race-Districting Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, intent on minimizing the  
use of race in drawing election districts, heard arguments 
Wednesday in a North Carolina case that could have enormous 
influence on political redistricting nationwide after the 2000 
census. 
</P>
<P>
	In a spirited session, the justices wrestled with a key issue:  
How much evidence is needed to conclude that an election district 
is the product of unlawful gerrymandering because racial 
considerations played too large a role? 
</P>
<P>
	A redistricting plan based on partisan politics cannot be ruled  
unlawful just because ``it happens to correlate with race,'' 
Washington lawyer Walter Dellinger argued in defending the makeup 
of North Carolina's 12th congressional district, now represented by 
Democrat Mel Watts. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a Democratic district that makes sense,'' Dellinger  
told the court. 
</P>
<P>
	But Robinson Everett, the Durham, N.C., lawyer representing  
voters who successfully challenged the 12th District in a lower 
court, said state legislators had ``used code'' in considering how 
to draw it in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``They said 'Democrats' but these are particular Democrats who  
are African-Americans,'' Everett contended in discussing how some 
of the district's boundary lines were drawn. 
</P>
<P>
	In a series of decisions since 1993, the Supreme Court has  
scuttled attempts by state and local lawmakers to draw districts to 
preserve or enhance minority candidates' chances to win if race was 
a ``predominant factor.'' Most of those rulings were reached by 5-4 
votes that traced the court's ideological divisions. 
</P>
<P>
	Redrawing 12 congressional districts after the 1990 census, the  
North Carolina Legislature created two majority-black districts in 
1992 -- the 1st and 12th -- and voters that year sent the state's 
first blacks to Congress since 1901. 
</P>
<P>
	That 1992 redistricting sparked two Supreme Court decisions, one  
in 1996 that struck down the 12th District as unlawful. The 
Legislature redrew the district in 1997, one in which blacks 
comprise 47 percent of registered voters. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-judge federal court ruled last April that the 1997 plan  
was unlawful, too. The three-judge court did not conduct a full 
trial but made what lawyers call a ``summary judgment'' after 
considering the district's shape and its racial makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, a key member of the highest court's  
slender majority in past redistricting cases, appeared sympathetic 
Wednesday to North Carolina's district-drawing efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may well have been sufficient evidence to preclude the  
(lower) court from granting summary judgment,'' she told Everett at 
one point. 
</P>
<P>
	But Justice Antonin Scalia seemed to think the three-judge court  
was entitled to take recent history into account. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a legislature that has been pulled, kicking and  
dragging, into drawing a district that does not take race into 
account,'' Scalia said. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions and comments from other justices suggested the court  
may well be closely divided again. A decision is expected by late 
June and will be studied by political map drawers for new 
guidelines on the ``dos'' and ``don'ts'' of redistricting efforts. 
</P>
<P>
	In other matters Wednesday, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Heard arguments in a case in which the justices must decide  
whether the National Collegiate Athletic Association can be sued 
under a federal law banning sexual bias in educational programs 
that get federal money because of the dues it collects from its 
1,200 member schools. 
</P>
<P>
	--Ruled in a California case that some local governments must get  
federal approval before changing their election systems even when 
the revisions are required by state law. 
</P>
<P>
	--Used a Nevada case to decide that people sometimes may use a  
federal anti-racketeering law to sue their health insurer for 
alleged fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	--Said in a case from Oregon that companies serving as  
subcontractors on federal projects cannot force the government to 
pay them in full when the prime contractors fail to do so.

</P>
<P>
	The creator of the smiley face has declared commercial warfare  
on those who have profited from the friendly yellow icon he 
squiggled for an insurance company 35 years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Graphic artist Harvey Ball, who earned $45 for designing the  
joyful face, has formed the World Smile Corp. His ``signature 
smiley'' products will include his signature inside the smiley 
drawing. Profits from greeting cards, buttons and other products 
will go to charity. 
</P>
<P>
	Last spring, Ball learned that French entrepreneur Franklin  
Loufrani had registered the smiley trademark in more than 75 
countries and was threatening to sue U.S. companies that sell 
smiley products overseas. 
</P>
<P>
	The 77-year-old Ball thought about a lawsuit but decided he just  
couldn't sue over a smile. ``It's repugnant. Yucky,'' he said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Suing Loufrani would also tie him up for years, perhaps decades,  
in litigation without a certain outcome, said Ball's son, Charlie, 
a lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Smiley's been pretty successful in the commercial arena,''  
Charlie Ball said. ``If we're going to take it to Loufrani, let's 
do it in the marketplace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nicholas Loufrani, Franklin Loufrani's son and vice president of  
marketing for London-based Smiley Licensing Corp., wishes Ball the 
best. 
</P>
<P>
	``He has the right to use the smiley character in the U.S.,'' he  
said. ``If he's able to sell smiley products and give the money to 
charity, that's great.''

<HEADLINE> Sumitomo Trust Denies Merger Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sumitomo Trust &AMP; Banking Co. and Daiwa Bank Ltd.  
denied a Japanese newspaper report today that they have begun 
merger negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is absolutely no truth to the report. We are not in any  
way in such talks,'' Sumitomo said in a statement. A Daiwa Bank 
spokesman also denied the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Kogyo Shimbun, an industrial daily, reported that the  
two banks have started negotiations with a goal to merge around 
April next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Stock Exchange suspended morning trading in Sumitomo  
and Daiwa shares as officials worked to verify the report, though 
trading resumed in the afternoon. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo is a top Japanese trust bank, while Daiwa is one of  
Japan's 10 largest city banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger report comes amid a major reconsolidation of Japan's  
financial industry, especially the bad-loan plagued banking sector. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, two trust banks -- Chuo Trust and Banking Co. and  
Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. -- announced a tentative agreement to 
merge. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, Daiwa Bank issued a statement Thursday saying it was  
not considering joining an alliance between Asahi Bank Ltd. and 
Tokai Bank Ltd. 
</P>
<P>
	The Yomiuri, Japan's largest nationally circulated newspaper,  
reported Thursday that Daiwa might participate in the alliance 
between the two banks. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, Asahi and Tokai said they agreed to form a  
strategic alliance and aimed to create a multiregional bank as well 
as possibly forming joint holding company. Details of the alliance 
were still being worked out. 
</P>
<P>
	In a related development, U.S. credit rating agency Moody's  
Investors Service Inc. said Thursday it has placed the credit 
worthiness of Asahi and Tokai under review for a possible 
downgrade. 
</P>
<P>
	It cited concerns over the outlook for Japan's economy and  
financial markets.

<HEADLINE>  Netanyahu: Wash. Break-Ins Are Setup </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu today  
suggested that burglaries at the Washington offices of political 
strategists for his main rival may have been set up to embarrass 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	For the second time in a week, burglars broke in Tuesday to the  
Washington offices of U.S. pollster Stanley Greenberg and 
reportedly took information related to Ehud Barak's campaign for 
the prime ministership. 
</P>
<P>
	``We witness, suddenly, a second break-in. The first was absurd  
but the second, in the same place, occurred while the FBI was 
watching,'' Netanyahu told Israel Radio. ``I hope that we aren't 
dealing with political provocations whose intent is to create false 
accusations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barak said he wasn't worried that the stolen material could  
damage him. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think a failing government can use or somehow improve  
from ... papers,'' Barak, leader of the opposition Labor Party, 
told the radio. ``Someone is in a serious panic if he is willing to 
pay so much money so that people will carry out criminal 
break-ins.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Another Barak associate, American political consultant Steve  
Rabinowitz, was quoted by the Haaretz newspaper today as saying 
that Barak's political opponents were responsible for the 
burglaries. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's clear beyond a shadow of a doubt that there's no  
coincidence,'' Rabinowitz was quoted as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a theater of the absurd,'' Netanyahu told Israel radio  
in reaction to the reported Rabinowitz charges. ``It's an attempt 
to spread clouds of false accusations against the Likud.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Seven Israeli aides to Barak have also reported break-ins at  
their homes and offices over the past few months. 
</P>
<P>
	Barak's campaign manager, Tal Silberstein, said ``it's too much  
of a coincidence'' for the break-ins in Washington and Israel not 
to be related. 
</P>
<P>
	Elections have been called for May 17.  
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday's break-in, burglars managed to get past a new, more  
comprehensive security system installed in the Capitol Hill offices 
of the polling firm Greenberg Quinlan Research Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	The system was put in place after burglars entered through the  
roof last week, taking confidential records, a laptop and other 
items, including petty cash, according to police.

<HEADLINE> WTO Remains Split on New Leader </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- With a deadline approaching, members of the World  
Trade Organization on Wednesday remained divided over a new leader. 
</P>
<P>
	None of the four candidates vying for the top post commands  
support from a majority of the 133 nations belonging to the trade 
organization. The United States and the 15-nation European Union 
have yet to back a candidate. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision on a successor to Renato Ruggiero was to have been  
made by the end of December, but the nations extended the search by 
a month. 
</P>
<P>
	The leading candidate so far is Thai Deputy Prime Minister  
Supachai Panitchpakdi, who has the backing of 40 delegations, 
followed by Moroccan trade ambassador Hassan Abouyoub with 23. 
Former New Zealand Premier Mike Moore has the support of 15 
delegations, while former Canadian Trade Minister Roy Maclaren has 
13. 
</P>
<P>
	The post of director-general is regarded as key, as the  
liberalized trade system championed by the WTO faces growing 
pressure due to global economic turmoil.

<HEADLINE> Barnett Exits Northwestern for Colo. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Gary Barnett, who led a turnaround of the  
Northwestern football program that included an appearance in the 
Rose Bowl, on Wednesday was hired as coach at Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado athletic director Dick Tharp said Barnett's hiring is  
subject to the approval of the university's board of regents, which 
will meet on Thursday morning to discuss the matter. 
</P>
<P>
	If the board approves the hiring, as expected, Barnett was  
scheduled to be introduced during a press conference on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, 52, planned to meet with the current Colorado team on  
Thursday, as well as assemble his staff and familiarize himself 
with the status of Colorado's recruiting effort. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm pleased to bring forward to the board an individual who is  
deeply committed to young people and the University of Colorado,'' 
Tharp said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, returning to the school where he was an assistant for  
eight seasons under Bill McCartney, replaces Rick Neuheisel, who 
left Colorado on Jan. 9 to coach Washington at $1 million a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett was Tharp's original choice last week, but when  
negotiations broke down, the Buffaloes turned to Denver Broncos 
offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak. Kubiak turned down the offer on 
Monday, and Tharp renewed his campaign to woo Barnett, contacting 
the coach in Houston where he was on a recruiting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett had nine years remaining on an 11-year contract he  
signed with Northwestern in 1996. An expensive buyout clause in his 
contract apparently was a stumbling block in the original talks 
with Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	In seven seasons at Northwestern, Barnett compiled a 35-45-1  
record, including 3-9 in 1998. He took over a perennial 
cellar-dweller, however, and guided the team to two conference 
titles and a Rose Bowl appearance after the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Barnett arrived, Northwestern failed to win more than  
four games in a season since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats won only eight games in Barnett's first three  
seasons, but the following year he led them to a 10-2 mark, 
including a 41-32 loss to Southern California in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats went 9-3 the following season, which ended with a  
48-28 loss to Tennessee in the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwestern returned to its losing ways the last two years. The  
school also was rocked by a sports betting scandal in which four 
former Wildcats football players were indicted Dec. 3, accused of 
lying about their gambling activities. Barnett was not implicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett has been a hot coaching commodity in recent years. His  
name was mentioned in connection with openings at Georgia, Texas, 
UCLA, Notre Dame and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	His only other head coaching job was at Fort Lewis, a Division  
II school in Durango, Colo., where he had an 8-11-1 record in 
1982-83. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado players applauded the hiring.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge load off,'' quarterback Mike Moschetti said.  
``He is a hell of a coach. 
</P>
<P>
	``Just getting a coach this time of the year is important for  
recruiting efforts. It is exciting to get a guy who has been a 
Buffalo before. He was part of the national championship team here 
and is going to be here for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Offensive lineman Adam Reed, who played for Barnett one year at  
Northwestern, said, ``This will be a change for the players coming 
back. The whole attitude will change. Coach Barnett is a 
disciplinarian. He lays down guidelines, which players need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebackers coach Brian Cabral, one of several Colorado  
assistants who are expected to remain, said, ``I'm glad. Gary 
brings a lot to the program. Just the fact we have a head coach 
helps. We can schedule the in-house visits during a key period in 
the recruiting process. We can all go about our business.''

<HEADLINE> Mariners To Give Taylor a Chance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- The Seattle Mariners are going to take a look at  
left-hander Brien Taylor, the top pick in the 1991 draft. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor, 27, has struggled since undergoing reconstructive  
surgery on his pitching shoulder in December 1993. He signed a 
$1.55 million contract in August 1991 with the New York Yankees. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the Mariners signed Taylor to a contract as a  
minor league free agent. His minor league contract with the 
Yankees, with whom he has spent his entire career, ran out. 
</P>
<P>
	At Class A Greensboro in 1998, he was 0-1 with a 9.59 ERA in 13  
games, including one start. Since his surgery, he has pitched in 41 
minor league games. 
</P>
<P>
	At Double-A Albany in 1993, he was 13-7 with a 3.48 ERA in 27  
starts with 150 strikes in 163 innings. 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners said Taylor will report to Peoria, Ariz., with the  
rest of the team's minor league pitchers March 7. 
</P>
<P>
	``Brien is a project, but has a very high upside,'' said Benny  
Looper, the Mariners' director of minor league operations. ``We're 
eager to get him into our system and see what we've got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Mariners also announced that they have designated outfielder  
Tarrik Brock for assignment. The team has 10 days to trade or 
release Brock, 25. 
</P>
<P>
	The move was done to make room on Seattle's 40-man major league  
roster for outfielder John Mabry. Brock 25, split last season 
between Triple-A Tacoma and Double-A Orlando.

<HEADLINE> East Coast Shipwrecks Confounding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ATLANTIC CITY, N.J. (AP) -- For 21 years, Joe Crumb has worked on  
clamming boats up and down the East Coast, and every time he 
buttons up his canvas coveralls and steps onto the deck of the 
Arthur M., he knows he is courting danger. 
</P>
<P>
	``If anything happens, you've got nowhere to go,'' Crumb, 40,  
said as he stood next to the 105-foot vessel on a dock littered 
with broken clamshells. ``If the boat goes, you're a goner.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past two weeks, as many as 10 clam fishermen have met  
such a fate off the East Coast. 
</P>
<P>
	The sinking Monday of the Adriatic, a 74-footer with four crew  
members, marked the fourth serious accident involving an East Coast 
clamming vessel since Jan. 6. The crewmen are presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	The wrecks -- three off New Jersey, one off Massachusetts -- have  
underscored the unforgiving nature of commercial fishing, which is 
ranked the most dangerous occupation in America by the U.S. 
Occupational Safety and Health Administration, with 131 deaths a 
year per 100,000 employees. 
</P>
<P>
	Still, veteran seamen and marine science experts alike are  
stunned by the rash of accidents. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm as dumbfounded as everyone else,'' said Tom McCoy,  
fisheries administrator for the state Division of Fish, Game and 
Wildlife. ``Over the years, there have been periodic problems, 
where boats sank for one reason or another. But it's unusual to 
have this many in so short a time span.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The string of accidents began when the 84-foot Beth Dee Bob sank  
in rough seas off Manasquan. Two crew members died and two others 
are presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	Two days later, the 107-foot Cape Fear went down off the coast  
of New Bedford, Mass., killing two. 
</P>
<P>
	On Sunday, the 65-foot Ellie B. struck a jetty in Manasquan when  
its skipper fell asleep at the wheel. Three crew members jumped 
overboard and were rescued. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, the Adriatic got caught in a squall as it made its  
way down the coast toward Atlantic City for repairs. After issuing 
a frantic mayday call, the boat went down in about 60 feet of water 
off Barnegat. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's serious when one goes down. It's very serious when two go  
down. It's tragic when more than two go down,'' said Jack O'Dell, a 
Coast Guard spokesman in Washington. The Coast Guard will 
investigate the wrecks, individually and collectively, to see if 
there is some common cause. 
</P>
<P>
	In both fatal New Jersey wrecks, the boats sank during storms  
while returning to shore loaded with clams. The cause of the Cape 
Fear's sinking, which happened in relatively mild weather, has not 
been determined. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those in the marine industry say clamming boat owners  
put profits ahead of safety, sending fishermen out in bad weather 
and overloading the vessel. 
</P>
<P>
	New Jersey leads the nation in surf clam harvesting, with $27  
million worth landed at docks last year. Typically, 500 to 1,000 
bushels are harvested per trip. Manned by three- to five-member 
crews, clam boats generally go out for 24 hours at a time. Each 
crewman makes about $1,500 a week. 
</P>
<P>
	The boats use huge steel dredges to scrape clams off the ocean  
floor. The dredges, which are controlled by hydraulic winches, dump 
the catch into steel cylinders and onto a belt, where the clams are 
washed and sorted. 
</P>
<P>
	The clams are then dumped into steel cages, brought ashore and  
taken by truck to processing plants for sale as clam strips, minced 
clams or clam chowder. 
</P>
<P>
	When loaded, the cages can weigh more than 3,000 pounds each.  
The Adriatic was said to be carrying 27 full cages when it went 
down. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1990, the state modified regulations to eliminate weekly  
quotas for clam harvesting. The idea was to stop skippers trying to 
meet their quota from heading out to sea in spite of severe weather 
warnings, said James Joseph, state director of shell fisheries. 
</P>
<P>
	Now, there is a 600,000-bushel annual limit for the 57 boats  
with licenses to harvest clams in state waters. 
</P>
<P>
	Rik Van Hemmen of Red Bank, an engineer and marine consultant  
whose firm investigates sinkings and groundings, said operators of 
fishing boats get lulled into ignoring safety procedures. 
</P>
<P>
	``People realize the dangers, but if nothing happens, they take  
gradually more risks. Over time, safety features disappear and they 
start to stretch into a range where they're more dangerous,'' Van 
Hemmen said. ``It's what we call human failure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, he said the sinkings may just be a coincidence: ``Once  
something like this rears its head, it's seen as a trend, but 
that's not always the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some clammers are shaken.  
</P>
<P>
	``Nothing happens like this for five years, then all of a  
sudden, bam, bam, bam,'' said Jack Willis, 41. ``It makes you 
think.''

<HEADLINE>  White House Attacks Perjury Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A White House lawyer today dismissed the  
charge that President Clinton lied before a grand jury as nothing 
more than ``arguments over semantics'' and accused House 
Republicans of drawing conclusions more extreme than those of 
Kenneth Starr. ``It is hard to take the charges seriously,'' the 
lawyer told senators. 
</P>
<P>
	White House special counsel Gregory Craig opened a second day of  
defense arguments by urging senators in the impeachment trial to 
read the grand jury testimony and ``see the president is 
truthful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Craig denounced the impeachment article that accuses Clinton of  
perjury before a grand jury last August as ``really bad .... 
legally, structurally and constitutionally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you convict and remove President Clinton on the basis of  
these allegations, no president of the United States will ever be 
safe from impeachment again,'' Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged senators ``to not throw our politics into the darkness  
of incrimination, not to inject the poison of bitter partisanship 
into the body politic that like a virus can move through our 
national bloodstream for years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, White House Deputy Counsel Cheryl Mills tried to use  
against House prosecutors their argument that Clinton must be 
removed to uphold ``the rule of law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As a lawyer, as an American, and as an African-American, it is  
a principle in which I believe to the very core of my being,'' said 
Mills, the first woman to address the impeachment trial. ``If you 
love the rule of law, you must love it in all of its applications. 
... If it is applied equally, the rule of law exonerates Bill 
Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mills argued that the House prosecutors had ``dramatically  
shortchanged the truth'' in making their case that Clinton 
obstructed justice and was behind his secretary's retrieval and 
hiding of subpoenaed evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig argued that House prosecutors had wrongly tried to  
criminalize ``utterly meaningless'' conflicts in testimony. For 
example, Craig said the House prosecutors were wrong to argue that 
Clinton had lied under oath when he told the grand jury that he 
engaged in intimate contact and sexual banter with Monica Lewinsky 
``on certain occasions'' in 1996 and 1997 when Ms. Lewinsky was a 
White House employee. She testified the activity began in late 1995 
when she was still an intern. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is simply no way that a reasonable person can look at  
this testimony and conclude or agree with the managers that it is 
a, quote, 'direct lie.' What message do the managers send to 
America and to the rest of the world when they include these kinds 
of allegations as reasons to remove this president from office?'' 
Craig asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is hard to take the charges seriously, when in each case  
they boil down to arguments over semantics,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig tried to support admittedly legalistic arguments with  
video segments from Clinton's testimony and with testimony by 
several former federal prosecutors who argued that the case against 
Clinton did not meet the perjury standard. Craig charged that the 
House prosecutors had stretched far beyond the evidence as well as 
conclusions made by Starr.

<P>
	``What is most remarkable is the fact that that the managers  
made many, many allegations of grand jury perjury that the 
independent counsel declined to make,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was out of Washington today, lobbying for policies  
he introduced in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	One prominent Republican, former presidential candidate Pat  
Robertson, said today that Clinton had ``hit a home run'' in his 
speech and had dashed any possibility that he would be convicted at 
the impeachment trial. ``From a public relations standpoint, he's 
won. ... They might as well dismiss this impeachment hearing and 
get on with something else, because it's over as far as I'm 
concerned,'' Robertson said on ``The 700 Club'' television show. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the defense resumed its rebuttal, senators met privately  
in party caucuses. Republicans emerged sounding more certain they 
will seek to call at least some witnesses during the trial to 
resolve conflicts in testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``This all doesn't need to go beyond mid-February, even with the  
deposition of witnesses,'' said John Czwartacki, the spokesman for 
Majority Leader Trent Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House arguments at the trial a day earlier showed  
``there are conflicts in testimony that witnesses might resolve,'' 
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said today. He speculated that most of 
those who might be called could be helpful to Clinton's case. ``I 
don't know why the White House is so panic-stricken about it,'' he 
said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., opposing the calling of any  
witnesses, noted that key figures in the case have been interviewed 
numerous times already. ``They said the same thing each time,'' he 
told NBC. ``Why are we going through this again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House Deputy Counsel Cheryl Mills was to follow Craig to  
argue against an obstruction-of-justice charge. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig argued that House prosecutors had wrongly lumped charges  
together -- he called it as ``dubious prosecutorial practice'' -- and 
that the perjury article was so vague that it failed to identify 
any false statement Clinton made before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most frightening thing about article one, it alleges  
perjury generally but it does not allege a single perjurious 
statement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig said Clinton's vindication could be found in the grand  
jury transcript, and he encouraged senators to read it carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will see this president make painful, difficult  
admissions,'' he said. ``You will see that the president is 
truthful and after reading, seeing, hearing and studying the 
evidence for yourself ... we believe you will conclude that what 
the president did and said in the grand jury was not unlawful and 
that you must not remove him from office,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig also accused House prosecutors of trying ``to twist the  
scope'' of the perjury case to include allegations that Clinton had 
wrongly denied under oath his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in the 
Paula Jones case even though the House rejected that charge in 
December. 
</P>
<P>
	``The managers have sought to merge the Jones testimony with the  
grand jury testimony,'' Craig argued, reminding senators they 
weren't to try Clinton for originally denying his affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE>  White House Attacks Perjury Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A White House lawyer today dismissed the  
charge that President Clinton lied before a grand jury as nothing 
more than ``arguments over semantics'' and accused House 
Republicans of drawing conclusions more extreme than those of 
Kenneth Starr. ``It is hard to take the charges seriously,'' the 
lawyer told senators. 
</P>
<P>
	White House special counsel Gregory Craig opened a second day of  
defense arguments by urging senators in the impeachment trial to 
read the grand jury testimony and ``see the president is 
truthful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Craig denounced the impeachment article that accuses Clinton of  
perjury before a grand jury last August as ``really bad .... 
legally, structurally and constitutionally.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``If you convict and remove President Clinton on the basis of  
these allegations, no president of the United States will ever be 
safe from impeachment again,'' Craig said. 
</P>
<P>
	He urged senators ``to not throw our politics into the darkness  
of incrimination, not to inject the poison of bitter partisanship 
into the body politic that like a virus can move through our 
national bloodstream for years to come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Later, White House Deputy Counsel Cheryl Mills tried to use  
against House prosecutors their argument that Clinton must be 
removed to uphold ``the rule of law.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``As a lawyer, as an American, and as an African-American, it is  
a principle in which I believe to the very core of my being,'' said 
Mills, the first woman to address the impeachment trial. ``If you 
love the rule of law, you must love it in all of its applications. 
... If it is applied equally, the rule of law exonerates Bill 
Clinton.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mills argued that the House prosecutors had ``dramatically  
shortchanged the truth'' in making their case that Clinton 
obstructed justice and was behind his secretary's retrieval and 
hiding of subpoenaed evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig argued that House prosecutors had wrongly tried to  
criminalize ``utterly meaningless'' conflicts in testimony. For 
example, Craig said the House prosecutors were wrong to argue that 
Clinton had lied under oath when he told the grand jury that he 
engaged in intimate contact and sexual banter with Monica Lewinsky 
``on certain occasions'' in 1996 and 1997 when Ms. Lewinsky was a 
White House employee. She testified the activity began in late 1995 
when she was still an intern. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is simply no way that a reasonable person can look at  
this testimony and conclude or agree with the managers that it is 
a, quote, 'direct lie.' What message do the managers send to 
America and to the rest of the world when they include these kinds 
of allegations as reasons to remove this president from office?'' 
Craig asked. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is hard to take the charges seriously, when in each case  
they boil down to arguments over semantics,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig tried to support admittedly legalistic arguments with  
video segments from Clinton's testimony and with testimony by 
several former federal prosecutors who argued that the case against 
Clinton did not meet the perjury standard. Craig charged that the 
House prosecutors had stretched far beyond the evidence as well as 
conclusions made by Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is most remarkable is the fact that that the managers  
made many, many allegations of grand jury perjury that the

<HEADLINE> 2 Clemson Hoops Players Suspended </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEMSON, S.C. (AP) -- Clemson's struggling basketball team took  
another hit before the start of Wednesday's game with No. 2 Duke as 
coach Larry Shyatt suspended two players. 
</P>
<P>
	Guard Johnny Miller and forward Vincent Whitt were suspended for  
violating unspecified team rules, the school said about three hours 
before tip-off. 
</P>
<P>
	Neither player would be courtside, Shyatt said. Both would be  
studying at Vickery Hall, Clemson's academic learning center for 
athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Shyatt did not say how long the suspensions would last.  
</P>
<P>
	Clemson (12-6, 1-4 Atlantic Coast Conference) has been ranked  
most of this season. But the Tigers fell out of the top 25 after 
Sunday's 65-58 loss to Virginia, Clemson's fifth in six games. 
</P>
<P>
	Miller, a senior, had started every game this season, averaging  
5.9 points and 4.3 assists per game. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitt, who started 11 of 18 games, is Clemson's No. 3 scorer  
with a 7.1 points-per-game average.

<HEADLINE> Study Explores Fertility Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Combining artificial insemination with hormone treatments  
appears to give infertile couples a better chance of pregnancy than 
either method alone, researchers reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors routinely try to achieve pregnancy by injecting sperm  
directly into the uterus or by stimulating the ovaries with 
hormones to release eggs. Some doctors use both methods. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there have been few careful studies of how well these  
methods work, separately or together. 
</P>
<P>
	A study in today's New England Journal of Medicine looked at 932  
couples. In each case, there was no diagnosable reason for the 
woman to be infertile, and the man had either a normal or 
borderline sperm count. 
</P>
<P>
	Drs. David Guzick of the University of Rochester, Sandra Ann  
Carson of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and colleagues 
found that women who received hormones with artificial insemination 
were three times more likely to become pregnant than those who 
received the equivalent of no treatment and twice as likely to 
become pregnant as those who received only one form of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the essentially untreated comparison group in this study,  
doctors simply released the husband's sperm onto the wife's cervix. 
</P>
<P>
	Couples who received hormones with insemination had a 33 percent  
rate of pregnancy, vs. roughly 19 percent for couples who had one 
form of treatment and 10 percent for those who received the 
equivalent of none at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormones alone were about as effective as artificial  
insemination alone: 19 percent vs. 18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers noted the risks of using hormones include  
multiple pregnancy and possibly an increased chance of ovarian 
cancer. During the study, there were three quadruplet pregnancies, 
four sets of triplets and 18 sets of twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormone treatments cost about $1,300 per monthly cycle,  
artificial insemination about $500. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Egbert Te Velde and Bernard  
Cohlen of University Hospital Utrecht in the Netherlands said 
reproductive technology is being marketed too heavily in the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Many couples are too quick to try medical treatment and  
underestimate their chances of becoming pregnant through regular 
intercourse, they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Treatment of infertility usually does not make the difference  
between conceiving and not conceiving; the difference lies in 
conceiving sooner rather than later,'' they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's authors noted, however, that the couples they  
examined had been trying to become pregnant an average of 3 1/2 to 4 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with waiting is that we tend to delay our  
childbearing, and then by the time we're in our mid-30s, upper 30s, 
you're in an age group where these drugs are far less effective,'' 
Carson said. ``Waiting is fine if you're 25, but it's harder to 
make that argument at age 38 or 39.''

<HEADLINE> `Silent' Senators To Get Their Turn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- What was the president doing that Sunday  
afternoon when he summoned secretary Betty Currie to his office and 
said: ``Monica came on to me, and I never touched her, right?'' He 
says he was just refreshing his memory. But didn't he already know 
the answer? 
</P>
<P>
	After days of sitting silently and listening to House  
prosecutors and presidential lawyers make their cases, the 100 
senators finally get a chance at week's end to ask their own 
questions. They'll be submitted in writing to Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist to be read aloud at the impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been collating questions on behalf of the party, and  
there are a pile of them,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican senators have submitted 50 questions so far, said  
John Czwartacki, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	Senators have just 16 hours for the inquiries, but there's  
plenty of room for probing questions. 
</P>
<P>
	Did the Founding Fathers really intend to remove a president for  
lying about a sexual relationship with a former White House intern? 
Wouldn't it be more appropriate to let prosecutors try him in 
criminal court after he leaves office and spare the country? 
</P>
<P>
	``What is the lie that Clinton told the grand jury? I don't  
think the impeachment article specifies. That's what I'd ask the 
House managers,'' said Kathleen Clark, an associate law professor 
at Washington University in St. Louis. ``That's a flaw in the case 
of the House Judiciary Committee.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For Republican senators, pounding away at the evidence against  
Clinton may form a fruitful basis for questions about alleged 
perjury and obstruction, and to make a strong case that some 
witnesses might need to be summoned for live testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Democrats could zero in on the House managers' mistakes,  
such as their assertion that Vernon Jordan's job-hunting effort on 
behalf of Ms. Lewinsky kicked into high gear because of a critical 
ruling in the Paula Jones case. White House lawyers showed Jordan 
had met with Ms. Lewinsky hours before the ruling came down. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Counsel Charles Ruff's strong rebuttal on Tuesday  
left senators with some questions for the prosecution team. 
</P>
<P>
	For instance, Ruff argued that Jordan's motivation for stepping  
up his efforts to find a job for Ms. Lewinsky wasn't related to the 
Jones case. Since the court ruling came down after Jordan began the 
effort, is there any other evidence that prosecutors have to back 
up their assertion? 
</P>
<P>
	Did Clinton and Jordan know at that point that Ms. Lewinsky was  
a probable witness in the Jones case even before the ruling? If 
there is no support for the assertion that the two events are 
linked, will prosecutors withdraw the statement? 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's legal team could be asked:  
</P>
<P>
	--Is Monica Lewinsky lying when she says the president touched  
her in a sexual manner? Clinton denies that he did. Will Clinton 
assert there is an honest difference of recollection on this 
subject? 
</P>
<P>
	--Clinton claims he was refreshing his recollection when he  
summoned Mrs. Currie to his office and was not trying to influence 
her as a potential witness. If so, what exactly had the president 
forgotten about his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky the day after he 
testified he didn't have a sexual affair with the ex-intern? 
</P>
<P>
	In his grand jury testimony, Clinton said he called Mrs. Currie  
to the White House on her day off because ``I wanted to know what 
Betty's memory was about what she heard, what she could hear.'' 
Clinton said he asked a ``series of questions'' in order ``to try 
to quickly refresh my memory.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton testified he was preparing for an onslaught of media  
inquiries that would be generated by leaks to reporters. Cheryl 
Mills, a member of the Clinton legal team, underscored that in her 
presentation Wednesday to the Senate. The president's purpose in 
talking to Mrs. Currie, Mills said, was ``never to obstruct 
justice'' but to deal with the ``looming media firestorm which he 
correctly'' predicted would result. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Olympia Snowe, R-Maine, said Wednesday night that some  
questions came to her mind as she watched the presentation by 
Mills, such as: Why did Clinton talk to Betty Currie, when Judge 
Susan Webber Wright had issued a protective order for the president 
not to discuss his testimony? 
</P>
<P>
	``And yet the next day he invited Betty Currie to the White  
House to have a discussion,'' Snowe said on CNN's ``Larry King 
Live'' show. 
</P>
<P>
	After the day's impeachment proceedings concluded, a House  
manager, Rep. Bob Barr, R-Ga., asked why if Clinton was worried 
about the media why he didn't just talk to then-White House 
spokesman Mike McCurry? 
</P>
<P>
	--Did Ms. Lewinsky lie when she testified that Clinton reminded  
her that they had a previous agreement to use cover stories shortly 
after it became clear she would become a witness in the Jones case? 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said that ``I don't recall whether I might have done  
something like that.'' Ms. Lewinsky says the president reminded of 
her of these ``cover'' stories in a 2 a.m. phone call on Dec. 17, 
1997, a month before he used the stories in his testimony in the 
Jones case. 
</P>
<P>
	Questions dealing with the law on perjury and obstruction could  
put House managers on the spot. 
</P>
<P>
	--Do you believe a U.S. attorney could secure an indictment  
against the president if he were not in office? What makes you 
believe a jury would convict Clinton? 
</P>
<P>
	--Why didn't the House call fact witnesses in its investigation  
before impeaching the president? Was this a rush to judgment to 
accept the conclusions of prosecutor Kenneth Starr? 
</P>
<P>
	--Did the Republican majority invite the Democrats to participate  
in the process by which articles of impeachment were drafted?

<HEADLINE> Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 65.65 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks rose this afternoon, as investors cheered  
some positive earnings news and weren't ruffled by Federal Reserve 
Chairman Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	At 3 p.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average was  
up 65.65 at 9,420.87. The blue-chip index fell as much as 54 points 
in early trading, then rallied nearly 125 points before pulling 
back. 
</P>
<P>
	Broad-market indexes were also higher today. A surge in  
technology shares lifted the Nasdaq composite 51.80 to a record 
high of 2,459.97. 
</P>
<P>
	Stocks fell in early trading amid concerns that Greenspan would  
reprise his 1996 admonition about ``irrational exuberance'' in the 
stock market. During his speech today, he did say that ``the 
current level of equity prices would appear to envision a 
substantially greater growth in profits than have been experienced 
of late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	However, Greenspan also signaled that he was unlikely to take  
any action soon to try to arrest the market's advances, saying that 
``policymakers are going to have to be particularly wary of actions 
that unnecessarily sow uncertainties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry Willmore, senior economist at Barclays Capital, took that  
to mean that the Fed wouldn't ease credit soon, but also wouldn't 
tighten it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market would have gone down sharply if he had said  
something that indicates that he is leaning toward a tightening of 
monetary policy,'' Willmore said. '' And I would describe his 
comments as pretty even-handed or neutral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, technology stocks continued to press higher, boosted  
by a strong earnings report from software giant Microsoft. The 
company said Tuesday that its second-quarter net income was 73 
cents per share, beating analysts' estimates of 59 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft shares were up 9 3/8 at 165 in leading volume in Nasdaq  
trading. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas Instruments also rallied today, rising 6 7/8 to 99 7/8 after  
reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Among blue chip industrial names, General Motors shares were up  
2 1/16 at 90 1/16 after the automaker reported record 
fourth-quarter earnings of $2.61 a share, on target with analysts' 
expectations, compared with $2.33 a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T rose 3 1/16 at 94 7/16 after investment firm Morgan Stanley  
Dean Witter raised its 12-month price targets the 
telecommunications giant. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Morris shares were down 2 1/8 at 48 11/16 on concerns that  
President Clinton said in his State of the Union address late 
Tuesday that the federal government should pursue compensation from 
tobacco companies for smoking-related medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by an 10-o-9 margin on  
the New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 722.60 million 
shares, up from Tuesday's pace of 632.84 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 14.26 at 1,266.26, the  
NYSE composite index was up 5.15 at 599.98, and the American Stock 
Exchange composite index was up 7.87 at 715.48.

<HEADLINE> DaimlerChrysler To Consolidate </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- DaimlerChrysler AG is merging its financial  
services into a worldwide unit that will lend money for airplanes, 
ships and real estate, as well as cars and trucks. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler Services AG, which the German-American automaker  
calls its ``debis'' division, has a loan portfolio of $81 billion 
and ambitions of rapid growth around the globe. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have begun a major undertaking. We have established the  
fourth-largest non-banking financial company in the world,'' 
DaimlerChrysler management board member Klaus Mangold said 
Wednesday in a teleconference. 
</P>
<P>
	Mangold becomes chairman of debis. He called the move ``another  
example of the record pace of the DaimlerChrysler integration 
process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler stock rose $1.37 1/2 to $106.75 on the New York  
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Debis will be based in Berlin but will continue to maintain its  
offices in the Detroit suburb of Southfield, Mich., and in Norwalk, 
Conn. Mangold said no layoffs are planned, and he expects the work 
force to expand. 
</P>
<P>
	The new division should meet or exceed the 10 percent to 12  
percent annual growth rate of the financial arms of the former 
Daimler-Benz AG and Chrysler Corp., he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The consolidation had been planned since the creation of  
DaimlerChrysler AG in November. 
</P>
<P>
	While Chrysler Financial was involved only in automotive  
financing, debis already was diversified with business in such 
areas as train systems, insurance, telecommunications and real 
estate management. Debis now will enter those areas in North 
America and other markets, Mangold said. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1998, debis and Chrysler Financial reported combined revenues  
of $14 billion and, through the first nine months of last year, 
operating profits of $842 million. 
</P>
<P>
	DaimlerChrysler will not release debis' full-year earnings until  
its annual press conference March 31, a spokesman said.

<HEADLINE> Feds May Need To OK Voting Changes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Some local governments must get federal  
approval under the Voting Rights Act to change their election 
systems even when the revisions are required by state law, the 
Supreme Court said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The court ruled 8-1 for a group of Hispanic voters who  
challenged a revised system for electing municipal judges in 
Monterey County, Calif. 
</P>
<P>
	The Voting Rights Act law requires some areas of the country to  
get federal approval before changing their voting practices to 
ensure that minority voters' rights are not harmed. Monterey County 
is covered by the law, but California is not. 
</P>
<P>
	``We conclude that the county is required to seek preclearance  
before implementing California laws that effect voting changes in 
the county,'' Justice Sandra Day O'Connor wrote for the court. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision reversed a lower court ruling that said federal  
approval was not needed because Monterey's consolidation of 
municipal judge voting districts was enacted into state law. 
</P>
<P>
	Between 1972 and 1983, the county gradually consolidated its  
nine municipal court districts into a single county-wide district 
in which candidates run at-large. California enacted the Monterey 
County voting plan into state law in 1979. 
</P>
<P>
	Hispanic voters sued in 1991, saying the county never got the  
required federal approval for the changes. 
</P>
<P>
	After years of litigation, a three-judge federal court ruled  
that federal approval was not needed. But the Justice Department 
and the Hispanic voters argued the state law did not remove the 
county's need to get federal approval for its voting changes. 
</P>
<P>
	Today, the Supreme Court agreed and rejected arguments that the  
ruling would encroach on state powers. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Voting Rights Act, by its nature, intrudes on state  
sovereignty,'' O'Connor wrote, adding that such intrusion is 
allowed by the Constitution's 15th Amendment. 
</P>
<P>
	She noted that before voter literacy tests were banned  
nationwide in 1970, the Voting Rights Act was relied upon to ban 
literacy tests in covered areas even when they were located in a 
state that allowed such tests. 
</P>
<P>
	Her opinion was joined by Justices John Paul Stevens, Antonin  
Scalia, David H. Souter, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen G. Breyer. 
</P>
<P>
	Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist and Justice Anthony M.  
Kennedy also ruled for the Hispanic voters but disagreed with 
O'Connor's reasoning. 
</P>
<P>
	Writing for the two, Kennedy said areas covered by the Voting  
Rights Act should have to get federal approval only of those voting 
changes that they chose to make. However, because the 1979 
California law stated it was enacted at the county's request, such 
approval should be required in this case, Kennedy said. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Clarence Thomas dissented, saying governments should  
have to get approval only of voting changes that are the ``direct 
product'' of their policy choices. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is Lopez vs. Monterey County, 97-1396.

<HEADLINE> Scott Weiland Released From Jail </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Stone Temple Pilots lead singer Scott Weiland  
has been released from jail five days after his arrest on a 
possible probation violation. 
</P>
<P>
	Weiland, placed on three years' probation last summer after  
pleading guilty to felony heroin possession, was arrested Friday 
after a drug rehabilitation program director told a judge Weiland 
hadn't been following the rules. The nature of the violation wasn't 
disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	At Wednesday's hearing, Superior Court Judge Larry Fidler  
released Weiland, put him back on probation and reinstated him in 
an outpatient rehab program. Fidler also warned that ``rules are 
rules,'' and said if Weiland breaks them, ``You're going to jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Weiland has had a string of drug arrests dating back to 1995.  
</P>
<P>
	The Stone Temple Pilots won a Grammy Award in 1994 for the song  
``Plush.''

<HEADLINE> Russia Probed for Misspending Loans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Police are investigating claims by international  
lenders that the Russian government misspent $10 billion in loans 
intended to help revive its crippled economy, a top official said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	First Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Maslyukov made the comments  
hours before a mission from the International Monetary Fund was to 
arrive in Moscow to assess Russia's economy before deciding whether 
to extend badly needed new loans. 
</P>
<P>
	Maslyukov, who was in Washington last week for talks on new  
loans, bristled at the lenders' claims. He said an investigation by 
Russian police would prove the government's innocence, the Interfax 
news agency reported. He did not identify the loans that were 
allegedly misappropriated, nor did he give any other details of the 
accusations. 
</P>
<P>
	The IMF has scrapped a $22.6 billion loan package it assembled  
last summer to help Russia avert a looming economic crisis. The 
loans were frozen after Russia devalued the ruble and defaulted on 
some of its debts in August. 
</P>
<P>
	With its coffers now almost bare, the Russian government  
desperately hopes to win new IMF loans. 
</P>
<P>
	In an apparent bid to please the IMF, Finance Minister Mikhail  
Zadornov said Russia will make its scheduled debt repayments in the 
first quarter of the year while it continues talks on rescheduling 
the rest of its foreign debts. Russia must repay $493 million in 
the first quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Zadornov added that he hoped the government could reach a loan  
agreement with the IMF next month. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our only interest is to refinance our own debt to the fund''  
and not to finance domestic spending, Maslyukov said. 
</P>
<P>
	IMF officials have said any loans will hinge largely on Russia's  
ability to approve and put into effect a feasible budget 
</P>
<P>
	The lower house of Russian parliament approved the draft 1999  
budget Tuesday, in the second of four required readings. But the 
IMF has criticized even this austere budget as unrealistic and has 
faulted Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov's government for factoring 
in loans that haven't been promised. 
</P>
<P>
	Primakov and other officials have said Russia must reach an  
agreement with the IMF before it can reschedule its foreign debts. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Russia's top privatization official submitted his  
resignation because of illness and was temporarily replaced by his 
deputy, news reports said Wednesday. State Property Minister Farit 
Gazizullin suffered a heart attack in August and has not fully 
recovered, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported, citing the 
government press service.

<HEADLINE> Scandinavian Phone Cos. To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The state telephone companies of Sweden  
and Norway on Wednesday announced plans to merge and to sell 
one-third of the merged company's shares on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger aims to keep the state-owned telecoms operations  
competitive in an increasingly tough market. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger between Sweden's Telia and Norway's Telenor would  
create one of the Nordic countries' largest companies, worth about 
155 billion Swedish kronor ($20 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, Sweden will hold 60 percent of the shares in the new  
concern and Norway the other 40 percent. But by the end of next 
year, each country's share is to be reduced to 33.4 percent and the 
remainder put up for sale on the Stockholm bourse. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, which must be approved by the parliaments of both  
countries and by the European Union, was announced simultaneously 
in Stockholm and Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new company will be very competitive,'' said Norwegian  
Communications Minister Odd Einar Doerum in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that this Nordic combination is the right way to go  
if we are to retain our leading position in the telecommunications 
area,'' said his Swedish counterpart, Bjoern Rosengren. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1998, the two companies called off merger talks  
because the governments failed to agree on a corporate structure. 
There is now broad political support for the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Telia, which is the Nordic countries' biggest phone company,  
employs about 32,000 people, and had 1997 profits of about 4 
billion kronor ($540 million). Telenor, Norway's sixth largest 
company, employs 19,600 people and reported a profits of 1.9 
billion kroner ($260 million) for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is expected to mean that some jobs will become  
redundant, but there were no estimates as to how many positions 
might be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will have its headquarters in the Swedish  
capital of Stockholm, and will be led by Norwegian Tormod 
Harmansen, the managing director of Telenor. Swedish Jan Stenberg, 
chairman of the board of Telia, will be chairman of the new 
company. Stenberg is managing director of the Scandinavian Airlines 
System, which is owned by Norway, Sweden and Denmark.

<HEADLINE> Malcolm X Honored With Stamp </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Malcolm X, who was shadowed by the FBI because  
of his activism, was honored by the government Wednesday with a new 
commemorative stamp. 
</P>
<P>
	Postal Service Governor S. David Fineman unveiled the 33-cent  
stamp at the Apollo Theatre in the Harlem section of New York. 
</P>
<P>
	Malcolm X, who was assassinated in a Harlem ballroom in 1965,  
was ``a modern-day revolutionary who openly fought for the end of 
oppression and injustice,'' said Fineman. ``He was a visionary, a 
man who dreamed of a better world and dared to do something about 
it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Guests at the presentation included Malcolm's daughters --  
Attallah, Gamilah, Ilyasah, Malaak, Malikah and Qubilah Shabazz. 
</P>
<P>
	Malcolm X, born Malcolm Little in Omaha, Neb., joined the Nation  
of Islam in 1952. A former street hustler, he became a fiery orator 
who advocated black nationalism in the early 1960s. He was often 
followed by government agents suspicious of his motives and 
provocative views toward whites. 
</P>
<P>
	A 1964 falling out with Nation founder Elijah Muhammad led  
Malcolm to start a splinter group, the Organization of 
Afro-American Unity, and to found a mosque in Harlem. Three black 
Muslims were convicted of Malcolm's murder, which was witnessed by 
his family. 
</P>
<P>
	Also present Wednesday were actors Ossie Davis and Ruby Dee,  
singer Harry Belafonte and ``60 Minutes'' correspondent Mike 
Wallace. The Boys Choir of Harlem performed. 
</P>
<P>
	The new stamp is to go on sale Thursday. It's the 22nd in the  
Black Heritage series that also includes stamps honoring Martin 
Luther King Jr., Harriet Tubman and W.E.B. DuBois.

<HEADLINE> Heston Wants Director Kazan Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charlton Heston is asking Hollywood to bestow  
honors on Elia Kazan, the ``On the Waterfront'' director whose 
naming of names before the House Un-American Activities Committee 
during the 1950s made him an outcast among his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter published Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal,  
Heston said Kazan deserves a Life Achievement Award from the 
American Film Institute. Heston was once chairman of the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood has already tried to make its peace with Kazan with a  
special Oscar to be given him at the Academy Awards in March, but 
Heston said he deserved more. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quality of his work as a director, both on Broadway and in  
Hollywood, is beyond dispute,'' Heston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan, who won Oscars for ``Gentleman's Agreement'' in 1947 and  
``On the Waterfront'' in 1954, joined the Communist party in the 
1930s, but resigned soon after World War II. Called before HUAC, 
Kazan admitted his past and acknowledged the communist ties of some 
of his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	Heston suggested Kazan's naming of names cost him an achievement  
award and said that should not prevent him from being recognized 
for his work.

<HEADLINE> Silicon Graphics Cuts Loss to $20M </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) -- Silicon Graphics Inc. on Wednesday  
said it narrowed its quarterly loss to $20.3 million, beating Wall 
Street expectations, amid cost cutting and a shift to selling more 
mainstream computers. 
</P>
<P>
	The maker of powerful desktop computers said its loss in the  
second fiscal quarter, ended Dec. 31, came to 11 cents a share on a 
diluted basis. Silicon Graphics lost $31.5 million, or 17 cents a 
diluted share, in the year-ago quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Second-quarter revenues fell 19 percent to $684.8 million from  
$850.8 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Silicon Graphics chief executive Richard Belluzzo credited the  
company's recent turnaround efforts, which include a shift to 
selling lower priced computers running on standard technology: 
Intel Pentium chips and Microsoft Windows NT software. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past, all of Silicon Graphics machines have been based on  
its own chips and Unix operating software. 
</P>
<P>
	The results topped analysts' expectations for a loss of 19 cents  
per diluted share, according to First Call Corp. Silicon Graphics 
announced its results after the close of financial markets Tuesday, 
when shares ended 37 1/2 cents lower at $15 on the New York Stock 
Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	The company is struggling to regain some of its former glory as  
a darling of the technological world, celebrated for making the 
computers used to create the special effects in such movies as 
``Jurassic Park.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Silicon Graphics has been hurt by growing competition by  
workstation makers such as Sun Microsystems Inc. and 
Hewlett-Packard Co. It also has been hurt by less costly 
workstations and high-end personal computers using Intel chips and 
Microsoft's Windows NT operating software. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to selling lower-priced computers, Silicon Graphics  
has announced plans to gradually shed its nearly $1 billion stake 
in microprocessor subsidiary MIPS Technologies Inc. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first half of fiscal 1998, Silicon Graphics lost $64  
million, or 34 cents a share, compared with a loss of $87 million, 
or 47 cents a share for the year-ago period. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue fell 19 percent to $1.31 billion from $1.62 billion.

	Clinton: Surplus to Social Security  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is making dramatic  
concessions to Republicans on revamping Social Security, but the 
spotty GOP response to his State of the Union address shows that 
bitter fights lie ahead on the retirement program, tax cuts and 
White House plans for higher spending. Clinton strode into the 
House chamber last night and confidently delivered a 77-minute 
speech laden with proposals ranging from more defense spending to 
helping communities fight pollution. 

</P>
<P>
	GOP Has Its Own Agenda  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans' response to President Clinton's  
speech included promises of a 10 percent income tax cut. ``No 
matter what the outcome of the president's situation, life in 
America will go on,'' Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., said last night, 
referring to Clinton's impeachment trial. At events throughout the 
day and in the official TV response, Republicans repeatedly said 
the 10 percent across-the-board reduction in income tax rates was 
their top priority for the next two years. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Lawyers To Resume Rebuttal  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House lawyers are challenging  
contentions by House prosecutors that President Clinton lied to a 
federal grand jury and obstructed justice. Before the defense 
resumes its rebuttal today in the historic impeachment trial, each 
party in the Senate and the prosecution team were to hold strategy 
sessions to prepare for written questions, a motion to dismiss the 
case and a decision on whether to call witnesses. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Military Jet Down Near Japan  
</P>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- A U.S. Marine jet apparently collided with another  
American military airplane during training maneuvers today and 
crashed into the Pacific off southwestern Japan, U.S. military 
officials said. The pilot was rescued. The FA-18 Hornet from Marine 
Corps Air Station Iwakuni plunged into the ocean about 20 miles 
south of Kochi prefecture. The pilot was rescued from his life raft 
by a Japanese crew and was later transported to the Branch Medical 
Clinic in Iwakuni, where he was reported to be in good condition, 
the Marine Corps said. 

</P>
<P>
	Doctors: Yeltsin Won't Need Surgery  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Doctors decided today that they don't need to  
operate on President Boris Yeltsin after he was hospitalized with a 
bleeding ulcer, the Kremlin said. After examining Yeltsin's stomach 
with a tiny camera on a fiber-optic thread, doctors determined the 
ulcer had ``stopped bleeding, the inflammation and swelling of 
tissue stopped and initial signs of healing appeared,'' Russian 
news agencies said. 

</P>
<P>
	Defiant Milosevic Defends Crackdown  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic is  
defending his right to crush Kosovo's ethnic Albanian rebels, 
despite a NATO warning to halt the violence. During a meeting 
yesterday with Gen. Wesley Clark, the American who serves as 
supreme allied commander in Europe, and Gen. Klaus Naumann, the 
German who chairs the NATO Military Committee, a defiant Milosevic 
showed no sign of backing down on his refusal to allow a U.N. war

<HEADLINE> This Frenchman Seduces Thousands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Thousands of Americans are seduced by Frenchman  
Eric Ripert each year. His passion draws them in, his creativity 
and excellence wins them over. 
</P>
<P>
	Some have had a committed relationship with Ripert for years.  
</P>
<P>
	Ripert is the four-star head chef at Le Bernardin, setting the  
course for the seafood restaurant's kitchen and educating the 
staff, helping them appreciate their fine product. Ripert joined Le 
Bernardin as executive chef in 1991 and took over the kitchen 
completely in 1994. He says the fame and good fortune of the 
restaurant is a nice compliment, but it is not what he thinks about 
each day. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's my job to be here from 11 in the morning to 11 at night,  
making sure everything is running smoothly, the timing is right and 
the quality is there. That tiny bite mark in every dish is mine, 
making sure it is OK,'' he jokes. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1999 Zagat Survey of New York City's restaurants lists Le  
Bernardin as No. 1 in the Top 50 Food Ranking. The survey also 
lists Le Bernardin as having the top seafood cuisine. 
</P>
<P>
	Says Zagat:  
</P>
<P>
	``Surfacing at the top of New York's food rankings this year,  
Maguy Le Coze's 'exquisite' French 'temple to seafood' inspires a 
tidal wave of praise from over 2,400 surveyors; from the 'unrivaled 
piscatorial pleasures' provided by chef Eric Ripert, to the 
'handsome' decor and 'impeccable service,' it's 'as good as it 
gets, and keeps getting better,' making it 'worth every (prix fixe) 
penny.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Lunch is $42; dinner is $70, according to Zagat's.  
</P>
<P>
	Maguy Le Coze and her brother, Gilbert, opened the original Le  
Bernardin in Paris in 1972. Le Bernardin opened in New York in 
1986. Gilbert died in 1994. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripert won two 1998 James Beard Foundation awards for best  
restaurant and best chef in New York City. He is co-author of ``Le 
Bernardin Cookbook -- Four-Star Simplicity'' with Maguy Le Coze 
(Doubleday). 
</P>
<P>
	But the 33-year-old chef says the praise has not gone to his  
head. 
</P>
<P>
	``It may be all compliments when I'm out in the dining room, but  
when I go into the kitchen and have my hand in the gut of a fish, 
it's hard to feel like a celebrity,'' he says, with more than a 
trace of a French accent. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have a passion for food, and I like to produce a good  
product. Celebrity is just a product of public relations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He credits mentors Joel Robuchon at Jamin in Paris and  
Jean-Louis Palladin at the Watergate Hotel in Washington for his 
success. 
</P>
<P>
	``No one is born a cooking genius. It's important for chefs to  
share their knowledge. If I'm a celebrity now, it's because someone 
took the time to teach me,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripert's promise of napoleon of curried crab and apple salad was  
a likely incentive for guests who paid $1,000 each for a 
five-course meal at the St. Regis Hotel to benefit Thirteen/WNET, 
New York's public television station. The Jan. 20 event also drew 
four-star chefs David Waltuck from Chanterelle; Sottha Khunn and 
Jacques Torres from Le Cirque 2000; and Christian Delouvrier from 
Lespinasse. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides the gratification he receives from participating in  
charity events, Ripert says he enjoys ``cooking and partying a 
little'' with his fellow chefs. 
</P>
<P>
	When more than one four-star chef is in the kitchen, there is  
sure to be some friendly rivalry, he says, noting that ``a little 
competition is good for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His interest in cooking was born in his grandmother's kitchen in  
Antibes, France. Even at a young age, he recalls, he wanted to know 
how she prepared her Mediterranean specialties. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripert's family moved to Andorra, which lies between Spain and  
France, when he was a child. When it came time to choose a 
profession, Ripert decided to attend a culinary school in 
Perpignan, which is located in the south of France near the Spanish 
border. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a passion for food even as a kid,'' he says. ``I wasn't  
a picky eater either. I liked the herbs and spices of the south of 
France and the olive oils we used in Spain.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ripert, who is newly married, devotes Sundays to cooking for his  
wife -- his toughest critic -- and small groups of friends. 
</P>
<P>
	He also treats himself to some indulgences.  
</P>
<P>
	``I love all fish, but I also love all food. Since I spend my  
week with fish, I like to cook steak at home. I also eat a lot of 
chocolate,'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	He also likes to ski and travel, always booking a table at his  
destination's top eateries before he leaves. 
</P>
<P>
	Ripert plans to hang up his chef whites when he turns 40 -- a  
goal he set for himself a decade ago. When he does, he will likely 
turn his attention to teaching or consulting. He would like to 
develop a television cooking show or write more cookbooks. 
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	The Zagat guides are based on reviews from thousands of  
consumers who fill out questionnaires rating food, decor, service 
and cost. This year's New York City guide contains reviews from 
over 18,000 diners of some 1,900 restaurants.

<HEADLINE> Four Found Dead in Missouri Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SPRINGFIELD, Mo. (AP) -- A woman and her three children were  
found dead inside their home Wednesday on a quiet street, in what 
one policeman called the city's worst homicide case in at least a 
decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The four were found shortly after 5:30 p.m. when a neighbor went  
to check on the woman, who friends said was nine months pregnant. 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently she had gone to the door, and I don't know if she  
found the body or just knew something was wrong,'' police Maj. 
Darrell Crick said of the woman, who was being interviewed by 
authorities late Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused to say how the woman and her children died, but said  
the case was being investigated as a homicide. Crick said it 
matched the most fatalities in a single homicide case that he could 
remember in his 23 years with the Springfield Police Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The names and ages of the victims were withheld pending  
notification of relatives, but several neighbors said the woman had 
two boys and a girl and they ranged in age from about 8 to 11.

<HEADLINE> GOP Promotes Tax Cut Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Even before President Clinton's State of the  
Union address, Republicans outlined their own agenda -- led by a 10 
percent income tax cut -- partly to demonstrate they will tackle 
issues other than impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	``No matter what the outcome of the president's situation, life  
in America will go on,'' Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., said in the 
GOP's nationally broadcast response to Clinton's speech Tuesday 
night. ``Our lives will continue to be filled with practical 
matters, not constitutional ones.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But some Republicans said the Senate impeachment trial of the  
president would make gaining bipartisan support for any substantive 
legislation all the more difficult. 
</P>
<P>
	``Progress this year may depend largely on working around the  
corrosive effects of the White House predicament,'' said Sen. Dick 
Lugar, R-Ind. 
</P>
<P>
	At events throughout the day and in the official TV response,  
Republicans repeatedly said the 10 percent across-the-board 
reduction in income tax rates was their top priority for the next 
two years. 
</P>
<P>
	Following close behind were elimination of the ``marriage  
penalty'' -- millions of two-earner couples pay more tax than if 
they had remained single -- and scrapping estate taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	``The time has come for major tax change,'' said the Senate  
Finance Committee Chairman, Sen. William Roth, R-Del. ``We need a 
broad tax cut.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing today before the House Ways and Means Committee,  
Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan said the best use of 
projected budget surpluses would be to pay down public debt. But 
short of that, reducing taxes would be far more attractive than 
more government spending, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would clearly prefer that if you can't run the surpluses,  
you have to get rid of the surpluses, I would far prefer reducing 
taxes than increasing spending. I don't think it's a close call,'' 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans said they could accomplish these cuts while still  
safeguarding Social Security for the future. They were heartened 
that the president embraced some form of new GOP-proposed 
individual retirement account, but Republicans want them kept in 
private hands and not overseen by the government as Clinton wants. 
</P>
<P>
	``The American people would clearly prefer to have control of  
their own private investment accounts,'' said Senate Majority 
Leader Trent Lott, R-Miss. ``They don't have confidence in the 
government.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Beyond taxes and Social Security, the Republican legislative  
priorities include: 
</P>
<P>
	--Shifting more money and authority for schools from the federal  
government to local educators and permitting families more choice 
in where their children attend school. 
</P>
<P>
	--Boosting military pay by 4.8 percent and continuing work on a  
national missile defense system. 
</P>
<P>
	--Stepping up anti-drug efforts through tougher laws on  
money-laundering and making it easier to extradite fugitives in 
drug cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Steve Largent, R-Okla., who gave part of the GOP response,  
briefly mentioned a cornerstone issue for social conservatives: an 
end to so-called partial-birth abortions, a measure previously 
passed by Congress but vetoed by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	``We must uphold the sanctity of life,'' Largent said.  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were eager to prove they have a popular agenda even  
before the impeachment trial after a lack of issues was blamed by 
some to their r setbacks in the 1998 elections. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an aggressive agenda, one we're going to work very  
hard to pass,'' said Senate Majority Whip Don Nickles, R-Okla.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Now Says He Will Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dennis Rodman changed his mind Wednesday and  
decided not to retire after all. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA's most outrageous player posted a message on his  
Internet site announcing his un-retirement, and his agent, Dwight 
Manley, confirmed that the seven-time rebounding champion wants to 
return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been reviewing my options,'' Rodman wrote, ``and those  
options still include playing in the NBA this season with a 
contender. Chicago, New York and L.A. are all cities I'd like to 
play in. Playing overseas could be pretty cool, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman had announced his retirement on Tuesday as rumors spread  
that he was about to be traded to the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley, who had said he would no longer represent Rodman, said  
he spoke on the telephone with the player for 10-15 minutes 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's true,'' Manley said of Rodman's change of heart.  
``Technically, I'm still his agent. There's nothing else I'm 
willing to say at this point.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the Bulls plan to resuscitate a sign-and-trade deal for  
Rodman, they'll have to do so by 2 p.m. EST Thursday when teams can 
start making deals. Chicago is expected to renounce its rights to 
Michael Jordan and execute sign-and-trade deals for Scottie Pippen 
(to Houston), Luc Longley (to Phoenix) and Steve Kerr (to San 
Antonio). 
</P>
<P>
	Word around the league Tuesday was that Chicago was ready to  
make a sign-and-trade deal with the Knicks, trading Rodman for Buck 
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	Knicks general manager Ernie Grunfeld did not immediately return  
a call seeking comment. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman said he would elaborate on his change of heart Friday  
night on ``The Tonight Show.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``OK, so here's the deal,'' Rodman's website message began.  
``I've had some long discussions with the people I love, the ones 
whose opinions matter most to me, and I've decided not to retire 
after all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know yesterday I said I was history, and with the NBA  
lockout and everything going on, I really thought I should stop 
playing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	After going on about his supposed options in Chicago, New York  
and Los Angeles, Rodman wrote: 
</P>
<P>
	``There's one thing I have always told my fans I would do in my  
last game that I still haven't done. I'm sure you know what it is, 
but I still have to come back for at least one more game so that I 
can get buck naked on the court,'' Rodman wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman said several times in the past that he would strip off  
his uniform and walk off the court naked when he was truly ready to 
retire. 
</P>
<P>
	If true, it would merely be the latest act of outrageousness  
from the renegade rebounder with wild hair colors and bountiful 
body piercings and tattoos. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, anyone remotely familiar with Rodman's ways could have  
seen this un-retirement coming. On Tuesday, hours after Manley said 
Rodman is finished with the game because he wants to go to 
Hollywood, Rodman backed off and said he was in a state of 
``limbo.'' 
</P>
<P>
	What remains to be seen is whether anyone is willing to bend  
over backwards to take another chance on Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley said Tuesday there were several teams still interested in  
signing the wacky, 37-year-old Rodman, known for his ferocious 
workouts, frequent forays to Las Vegas and an ability to hit the 
boards that led to seven straight rebounding titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley refused to elaborate on those possibilities Wednesday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have nothing else to say on the subject,'' he said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman won championships with Chicago in 1996, 1997 and 1998,  
and titles with the Detroit Pistons in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's off-court activities earned him much more notoriety  
than his rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	He once announced his marriage, only to show up at a New York  
book signing in a wedding gown and blond wig -- sans groom; he 
offended Mormons and was fined $50,000 for making derogatory 
comments during the 1997 finals in Salt Lake City; he skipped 
practice during the NBA Finals last summer to attend a wrestling 
match in Detroit; and as ``Rodzilla'' teamed with Hulk Hogan to 
beat Karl Malone and Diamond Dallas Page. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew a six-game suspension for head-butting referee Ted  
Bernhardt in 1996 and drew another for 11 games in 1997 for kicking 
a courtside cameraman in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	He was always in trouble, first with the Pistons, then during a  
brief stay in San Antonio, where his behavior damaged Spurs' 
chances at the NBA title, and finally during his three championship 
years with the Bulls, where he became a Chicago fan favorite for 
tossing his jersey into the stands after games. 
</P>
<P>
	His tardiness and selfish antics away from the court often  
tested his teammates' patience and that of coach Phil Jackson, who 
handled him as well as anyone could. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman has appeared in movies and TV shows, had a stint on MTV,  
and wrote his life story, ``Bad As I Wanna Be,'' which became a 
bestseller. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been sued -- most recently by a cocktail waitress who said  
he jammed a $100 bill down her blouse and grabbed her breast. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who once courted Madonna recently married Carmen  
Electra, his longtime girlfriend, although days later there were 
reports of an annulment filing. In another bizarre chapter, 
however, the former ``Baywatch'' actress later denied the marriage 
was off. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman, an excellent defender, is the rare player who doesn't  
need the ball to be effective. His career scoring average is just 
7.5 points, but at 6-foot-8 he is one of the great rebounders in 
league history with a 13.2 average. No other player ever won seven 
straight rebounding titles.

<HEADLINE>  Walker Named Coach at Northwestern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Wearing a Northwestern-purple tie and a  
wide grin, Randy Walker called himself the luckiest guy in the 
world. Again. 
</P>
<P>
	The coach at Miami of Ohio the past nine seasons was introduced  
as the Wildcats' new coach Wednesday afternoon. He replaces Gary 
Barnett, who was hired as Colorado's coach earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just keep having good things happen to me,'' he said.  
``You're looking at an old farm boy from Troy, Ohio, who didn't 
have a whole lot of resources going for him when he came out of 
high school. I thank God every night I'm alive that football is a 
game I could play. 
</P>
<P>
	``It gave me a chance to do the things I want to do in life,''  
he added. ``... And that's coach football.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett's departure and Walker's hiring puts an end to a  
tumultuous few weeks for the Wildcats. Barnett, who returned the 
Wildcats to glory in 1995 and 1996 with a trip to the Rose Bowl and 
consecutive Big Ten championships, has flirted with leaving almost 
since he arrived in Evanston in late 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a candidate for jobs at UCLA and Notre Dame, and linked  
to jobs at Georgia, Oklahoma and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all sad coach Barnett left, but what can you do?''  
sophomore offensive lineman Lance Clelland said. ``I'm excited for 
a fresh start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Walker is excited to give his new players one. The former  
Northwestern assistant is Miami's winningest coach, compiling a 
record of 59-35-5 in the past nine seasons, including a 10-1 mark 
last year. His 59 victories are best in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Miami which handed Northwestern its only loss in the  
regular season during its 1995 Rose Bowl year, a 30-28 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted someone with Division I experience who had  
demonstrated a record of winning,'' athletic director Rick Taylor 
said. ``We got the person we were after.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker is the latest in a long line of coaches to come out of  
Miami. Sid Gillman, Woody Hayes, Bo Schembechler and Bill Mallory 
all coached there, as did former Northwestern coach Ara Parseghian. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randy is for real, and we've said that to the people who have  
asked about him,'' said Joel Maturi, Miami's athletic director. 
``Northwestern is very fortunate to get a person of his character 
and work ethic and passion for kids. Not to mention his ability to 
win games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker isn't walking into an easy job. After years of permanent  
residence in the Big Ten basement -- just two teams won four games 
after 1971 -- Barnett had the Wildcats in the Rose Bowl after his 
fourth season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Northwestern has faltered the past two seasons. The Wildcats  
went 5-7 in 1997 and 3-8 last season. The school was rocked by a 
sports betting scandal that saw four former football players 
indicted Dec. 3 for allegedly lying about their gambling 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I, for one, don't tend to dwell on the past,'' Walker said.  
``Let's talk about going forward, where are we going tomorrow. 
Let's worry about getting one day better as a football team. That's 
kind of how I start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker has only two weeks before national signing day for  
recruits. Aside from putting together a new staff and getting 
familiar with his new players, he has to find a way to keep 
recruits who might have been scared off by Barnett's impending 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll get my feet on the ground and hit it running,'' said  
Walker, who met with his new players for the first time after the 
news conference. ``Trust me, once I hit it running, I'm going to go 
real fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker played at Miami and was the team's MVP in 1975. Drafted  
by the Cincinnati Bengals, he chose to stay at Miami as a graduate 
assistant under coach Dick Crum. He accompanied Crum to North 
Carolina and spent 10 years there as an assistant. He then spent 
two years at Northwestern, where he coached the first back-to-back 
1,000-yard rushers in school history -- Byron Sanders and Bob 
Christian. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was named coach at Miami on Dec. 1, 1989, he inherited a  
program that had won two games over the two previous seasons and 
went 5-5-1 in 1990. He had a winning record every season thereafter 
except 1993, when Miami went 4-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to coach at the highest level and I want to coach in  
the national championship,'' he said. ``I believe Northwestern is 
that kind of program.

since he arrived in Evanston in late 1991. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a candidate for jobs at UCLA and Notre Dame, and linked  
to jobs at Georgia, Oklahoma and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all sad coach Barnett left, but what can you do?''  
sophomore offensive lineman Lance Clelland said. ``I'm excited for 
a fresh start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And Walker is excited to give his new players one. The former  
Northwestern assistant is Miami's winningest coach, compiling a 
record of 59-35-5 in the past nine seasons, including a 10-1 mark 
last year. His 59 victories are best in school history. 
</P>
<P>
	It was Miami which handed Northwestern its only loss in the  
regular season during its 1995 Rose Bowl year, a 30-28 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	``We wanted someone with Division I experience who had  
demonstrated a record of winning,'' athletic director Rick Taylor 
said. ``We got the person we were after.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker is the latest in a long line of coaches to come out of  
Miami. Sid Gillman, Woody Hayes, Bo Schembechler and Bill Mallory 
all coached there, as did former Northwestern coach Ara Parseghian. 
</P>
<P>
	``Randy is for real, and we've said that to the people who have  
asked about him,'' said Joel Maturi, Miami's athletic director. 
``Northwestern is very fortunate to get a person of his character 
and work ethic and passion for kids. Not to mention his ability to 
win games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker isn't walking into an easy job. After years of permanent  
residence in the Big Ten basement -- just two teams won four games 
after 1971 -- Barnett had the Wildcats in the Rose Bowl after his 
fourth season. 
</P>
<P>
	But Northwestern has faltered the past two seasons. The Wildcats  
went 5-7 in 1997 and 3-8 last season. The school was rocked by a 
sports betting scandal that saw four former football players 
indicted Dec. 3 for allegedly lying about their gambling 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I, for one, don't tend to dwell on the past,'' Walker said.  
``Let's talk about going forward, where are we going tomorrow. 
Let's worry about getting one day better as a football team. That's 
kind of how I start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker has only two weeks before national signing day for  
recruits. Aside from putting together a new staff and getting 
familiar with his new players, he has to find a way to keep 
recruits who might have been scared off by Barnett's impending 
departure. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll get my feet on the ground and hit it running,'' said  
Walker, who met with his new players for the first time after the 
news conference. ``Trust me, once I hit it running, I'm going to go 
real fast.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker played at Miami and was the team's MVP in 1975. Drafted  
by the Cincinnati Bengals, he chose to stay at Miami as a graduate 
assistant under coach Dick Crum. He accompanied Crum to North 
Carolina and spent 10 years there as an assistant. He then spent 
two years at Northwestern, where he coached the first back-to-back 
1,000-yard rushers in school history -- Byron Sanders and Bob 
Christian. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was named coach at Miami on Dec. 1, 1989, he inherited a  
program that had won two games over the two previous seasons and 
went 5-5-1 in 1990. He had a winning record every season thereafter 
except 1993, when Miami went 4-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to coach at the highest level and I want to coach in  
the national championship,'' he said. ``I believe Northwestern is 
that kind of program.

<HEADLINE> CFTC Chair Won't Seek Another Term </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brooksley Born has told President Clinton she  
will not seek another term as chairwoman of the Commodity Futures 
Trading Commission. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Born, who got caught up in a recent flap over the  
near-collapse of a huge private investment fund, told Clinton in a 
brief letter on Tuesday that she has decided to return to private 
law practice at the end of her term in April or soon after rather 
than seek a second five-year term. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've accomplished most of what I set out to do,'' Ms. Born  
told a small group of reporters. She cited as an example the 
independent agency's effort to streamline regulation of the 
commodity futures industry, which she said was ``well launched and 
on its way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Born got caught up in controversy in November following a  
news report that she had advance knowledge of the near-demise of 
Long-Term Capital Management, a high-flying hedge fund for wealthy 
investors. According to the report, she knew Long-Term Capital was 
dangerously leveraged in March 1998, months before it nearly 
collapsed and threatened to disrupt world financial markets in 
September. 
</P>
<P>
	When the issue surfaced, Ms. Born insisted she was given  
outdated annual information about the hedge fund in March that 
offered no hint of the potential for disaster. 
</P>
<P>
	The threat of the hedge fund's collapse prompted Federal Reserve  
officials to help arrange a $3.6 billion private bailout of 
Long-Term Capital by a group of big banks and brokerage firms. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about the matter Tuesday, Ms. Born said the hedge fund  
debacle was a factor in her decision to leave the government ``only 
to the extent that it did bring the spotlight onto'' 
over-the-counter derivatives. 
</P>
<P>
	``I applaud this new attention (to derivatives) and am highly  
optimistic that the regulatory issues are going to be addressed in 
a meaningful way,'' Ms. Born added. 
</P>
<P>
	Derivatives, complex financial instruments whose value depends  
on the value or change in value of an underlying security, 
commodity or asset, are used by businesses to guard against losses 
from unexpected market movements but also by hedge funds such as 
Long-Term Capital to speculate. Over-the-counter derivatives are 
traded away from futures exchanges.

<HEADLINE> Editorial Roundup  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Here are excerpts from editorials in newspapers in the United  
States and abroad: 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 19  
</P>
<P>
	The San Diego Union-Tribune, on impeachment trial:  
</P>
<P>
	The Senate soon will begin one of the most eventful debates in  
its history as members deliberate whether to convict President 
Clinton on the two articles of impeachment passed by the House. But 
as matters stand now, that debate will be cloaked in secrecy, 
conducted entirely behind locked doors in accordance with the 
Senate's 19th century rules. 
</P>
<P>
	For the trial of Andrew Johnson in 1868, the Senate adopted  
procedures that reflected the times. Senators were required to sit 
in silence -- under penalty of imprisonment -- as witnesses were 
heard and arguments were made for and against the president in open 
session. Then, the public was removed from the chamber and the 
doors closed while members debated their verdict in secret. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the final vote was conducted in public.  
</P>
<P>
	Lamentably, those antiquated rules remain in effect. Changing  
them requires a two-thirds vote of the Senate. ... Barring the 
public and the press from the Senate proceedings would be an 
affront to democratic principles, which demand that the people's 
business be conducted in the open. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Sens. Tom Harkin, D-Iowa, and Paul Wellstone, D-Minn., have  
announced their intention to ask the Senate to lift the rule 
requiring closed impeachment sessions. But their plan has met a 
cool reception among many senators, who claim confidential debates 
would promote consensus among senators. ... (S)enators have an 
obligation to conduct their deliberations in the open -- especially 
if the fate of a presidency hangs in the balance. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 15.  
</P>
<P>
	The Advertiser-Tribune, Tiffin, Ohio, on impeachment trial:  
</P>
<P>
	In a desperate effort to avoid having witnesses called in  
President Clinton's impeachment trial, his lawyers have made a 
rather startling move. They have agreed to ``stipulate'' that the 
Starr report -- which only weeks ago they were deriding as the work 
of a madman -- is the factual account of l'affaire Lewinsky and 
related obstructions of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	In other words, in order to avoid network broadcast of witnesses  
who would dramatically focus national attention on presidential 
wrongdoing, his lawyers have agreed that the president has 
committed the crimes of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
</P>
<P>
	It is now almost one year since Clinton promised to provide the  
full truth, ``sooner rather than later.'' Sooner, perhaps, than the 
Cubs will win a World Series, but a lot later than should be 
expected of a president. 
</P>
<P>
	The trial should focus on facts, not political expediency.  

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 13  
</P>
<P>
	The New Mexican, Santa Fe, on U.N. vacancy and Clinton:  
</P>
<P>
	Among the lesser-noted, but potentially serious, casualties of a  
White House in crisis is America's ambassadorship to the United 
Nations. 
</P>
<P>
	The position has been vacant since summer, when former New  
Mexico congressman Bill Richardson, who had served as U.S. 
Permanent Representative, became Secretary of Energy. ... 
</P>
<P>
	At a time when the U.S. remains at sword's point with Iraq, and  
the U.N. plays such an important role in tempering the belligerence 
of Saddam Hussein, our nation's mission to the U.N. needs a 
top-ranking ambassador shuttling between New York and Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	And this is only the beginning; many other key diplomatic posts  
remain unfilled. 
</P>
<P>
	If President Clinton is too distracted by his own trial before  
the Senate to effectuate his own appointment to the U.N., his 
fellow Americans must wonder what other vital duties are not being 
performed. 
</P>
<P>
	This confirms our view that Clinton should take constitutionally  
permitted leave from the presidency until his conflict with 
Congress is resolved. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 14  
</P>
<P>
	Naples (Fla.) Daily News, on harrassment:  
</P>
<P>
	A fifth-grade boy plagued a classmate in a Georgia school by  
grabbing her breasts, bumping against her in a hallway, spewing 
crudities her direction and even stuffing a doorknob down the front 
of his pants. Despite complaints from the girl's mother, the school 
did nothing, the mother sued the school board and now ... the case 
is being heard by none other than the U.S. Supreme Court. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the many things that is outlandish here is that the case  
was filed under Title IX. ... 
</P>
<P>
	In this instance, The National Women's Law Center ... is leading  
the charge. ... Should the Supreme Court dreamily agree that Title 
IX means what it does not say, it's the lawsuits brought against 
schools by money-grubbing parents that will be doing the harassing. 
...
</P>
<P>
	Most teachers, principals, administrators and school boards are  
not going to sit by idly while boys behave as intolerably as the 
one in Georgia allegedly did, and if they do, there are a variety 
of remedies short of appealing to the federal courts on the basis 
of non-applicable laws. The Supreme Court must consistently uphold 
such truths. 

</P>

<P>
	Fort Worth (Texas) Star-Telegram, on attorneys' tobacco fees:  
</P>
<P>
	John Cornyn has never been pleased with the contingency fee deal  
worked out for the private attorneys who represented Texas in the 
tobacco litigation. The idea of five law firms pocketing 15 
percent-plus of a $17.3 billion settlement rankled him as a former 
Texas Supreme Court justice and candidate for the attorney 
general's office, and it rankles him as he begins his 16th day as 
the state's top attorney. 
</P>
<P>
	Cornyn is toying with the idea of trying to seize for the state  
some of the $3.3 billion awarded to the attorneys last month. The 
money is being paid by the tobacco companies under a special 
arbitration deal reached separately from the settlement itself. 
</P>
<P>
	We would caution the attorney general to shelve that idea.  
</P>
<P>
	Texas is not an island unto itself in this situation; the  
arbitration agreement included attorneys' fees for Mississippi and 
Florida. Although Texas negotiated its own $17.3 billion payment 
from the cigarette manufacturers independent of what other states 
will receive, the formula used to calculate each state's take could 
unravel like a cheap sweater if Texas starts picking at the 
agreement. ... 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 11  
</P>
<P>
	Rochester (N.Y.) Democrat and Chronicle, on long-term care  
proposal: 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton has come up with a plan that would help  
elderly Americans and those caring for aging parents. The plan 
represents at least a start toward addressing long-term care 
concerns of a growing legion of Americans. 
</P>
<P>
	At the core of Clinton's plan is a provision that would give a  
$1,000-a-year tax credit to people who need long-term care in a 
nursing home or at home. With nursing home costs averaging more 
than $46,000 a year, such a tax credit might not seem like much. 
But remember that it's $1,000 more in tax credit than currently 
permissible. With the tax credit people who already provide 
informal, unpaid care to spouses and parents would get an overdue 
benefit. 
</P>
<P>
	Under current law, the government does not pay for long-term  
care until a beneficiary exhausts all financial resources. This 
policy has been blamed for many people hiding their assets to 
qualify for Medicaid, the government insurance plan for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's plan reflects the overdue realization of the need to  
do more to help aging Americans who are living longer. It marks the 
first time since the collapse of Clinton's efforts to reform health 
care in 1994 that there has been a significant attempt to address 
long-term care needs. ...

</P>
<P>
	The Herald, Rock Hill, S.C., on NBA fan reactions:  
</P>
<P>
	The NBA is back but Michael Jordan isn't, and the departure of  
basketball's best practitioner ever (this time for real?) may have 
more significance than simply the retirement of a superstar. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Jordan took the sport to a higher level.  
</P>
<P>
	And the question is whether the sport can sustain itself without  
him and the pizzazz he and his fellow Chicago Bulls brought to the 
game. Specifically, will the fans come back after being forced to 
find something else to entertain them for the past four months? ... 
</P>
<P>
	Then again, baseball was counted down and out a few seasons ago.  
And then Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa came along to revive it. 
</P>
<P>
	The next Michael Jordan probably is honing new skills on a  
playground court, at a YMCA, in a church league or a school gym 
somewhere. Someday he -- or she -- will arrive and dazzle us. ...

<P>

</P>
<P>
	The Seattle Times, on spelling bee:  
</P>
<P>
	How do you spell relief? The American organizers of the  
world-famous annual spelling bee think it's spelled 
``protectionism'' -- that sore-loser antidote to outside 
competition. 
</P>
<P>
	The Associated Press reports that young spellers from Jamaica,  
which boasts the current spelling-bee champ, have been disqualified 
from this year's event. Why? Not because they taped vocabulary crib 
sheets to their palms during competition. Not because they tested 
positive for a new spelling-muscle-enhancing steroid. No the 
Jamaican kids were reportedly dropped after spelling-bee busybees 
complained the island nation encouraged their students to study too 
much for the contest. 
</P>
<P>
	Spelling-bee organizers are hiding behind a bureaucratic excuse;  
they say Jamaica was required to hold a qualifying regional contest 
no earlier than this Feb. 1. But for almost 40 years, Jamaica has 
held its qualifying contest the August before the event. The rule 
seems to have been crafted selectively to punish this tiny country. 
...

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 16  
</P>
<P>
	The Palm Beach (Fla.) Post, on spelling bee rules:  
</P>
<P>
	Now, Jamaica is learning something about the ABCs of spelling  
bees. 
</P>
<P>
	A. Don't beat America.  
</P>
<P>
	B. See A.  
</P>
<P>
	C. See B.  
</P>
<P>
	For 70 straight years, a U.S. citizen won the annual national  
spelling bee. But last year, Jamaica's Jody-Anne Maxwell spelled 
C-H-I-A-R-O-S-C-U-R-I-S-T (an artist who works with light and 
shade) and became the first noncitizen to triumph. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, Jamaica is out. It traditionally picks its winner in  
August. New rules disqualify any representative who wins her 
regional spell-off before February. Spellers chosen before February 
have too much time to study, spelling bee officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	Huh? It's not as if Jamaica is becoming the East Germany of  
spellers, force-feeding kids alphabet-soup steroids. Too bad 
America can't recruit professionals, as we did when foreign 
basketball teams challenged our Olympic dominance. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials of the Scripps-Howard event swear there's nothing  
retributive in the rule change that disqualified Jamaica's 
up-and-spellers. It's just a coincidence. Even people who haven't 
studied under the Jamaican system can spell F-I-S-H-Y. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 19  
</P>
<P>
	The Express, London, on Clinton impeachment:  
</P>
<P>
	At every stage of the impeachment proceedings America's  
wiseacres have predicted that President Clinton would be let off 
the hook. And at every stage he has been further embroiled. So it 
is impossible to predict how the Senate will vote. 
</P>
<P>
	But what matters most about this entire episode is the disrepute  
into which it has brought the American political process. Whatever 
one's view of Bill Clinton -- and The Express believes he has made 
his own unique contribution to dragging down American political 
life -- impeachment has been used in a purely partisan fashion, as 
no more than a political weapon with which to embarrass a political 
foe. And that is contemptible. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 19  
</P>
<P>
	The Times, London, on Clinton impeachment:  
</P>
<P>
	It was condemned in advance as a partisan putsch based on  
``sexual McCarthyism.'' In fact, the opening three-day presentation 
offered by the prosecution team from the House of Representatives 
was more effective -- in both content and tone -- than even their 
sympathizers had dared to suspect. Few now in Washington are 
talking of kangaroo courts and show trials. Even Sen. Tom Harkin of 
Iowa, a prominent liberal Democrat, who had earlier dismissed the 
House accusation as ``a pile of dung,'' had by the weekend 
acknowledged ``a forceful case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That force has made it far more likely that, by a week today,  
the majority of senators will have voted to call at least a short 
list of witnesses, and that at least some Democrats will support 
that request. Even if only a limited number of central players come 
to the stand, that will lengthen events and render them more 
unpredictable. The President may be obliged to reverse his own 
brash assertion that he would refuse to testify. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 19  
</P>
<P>
	Tages Anzeiger, Zurich, Switzerland, on Brazilion economy.  
</P>
<P>
	Brazil is getting ready for what, for many natives, is most  
important: the carnival. The samba rhythm is already sounding in 
the economy. And if we say economy, we mean in the Brazilian 
crisis. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Just the size of the Brazilian market means that a number of  
South American countries direct a part of their exports and imports 
at Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	In the next days and weeks the congress must approve the program  
of reform and economic measures. Internal and external investors 
are making their help dependent upon this program and its 
implementation. 
</P>
<P>
	If the congress refuses, then the descent into hell will  
continue. And the first to fry would be the half of all Brazilians 
who are today living below the poverty line.

<P>

</P>
<P>
	Asahi Shimbun, Tokyo, on Olympic bribery scandal:  
</P>
<P>
	The revelations (of bribery) provide a good opportunity for  
putting a scalpel into the root cause of corruption. A radically 
new way of administering the International Olympic Committee (IOC) 
must be sought. 
</P>
<P>
	Juan Antonio Samaranch, who became IOC president in 1980, played  
a large part in establishing and promoting a commercializing trend. 
He adopted a policy that allowed the participation of professional 
athletes, throwing amateurism overboard, while firming up 
mechanisms for recruiting sponsors on a global basis. These were 
bold turns toward commercialism. 
</P>
<P>
	Mikio Oda, Japan's first Olympic gold-medal winner who died last  
year, used to say: ``We must take back power from those who make 
money out of the Olympics. Real athletes must join hands to rebuild 
the Olympic Games as soon as possible.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The money-worship introduced to the Olympic Games by the  
Samaranch regime must be eradicated. 
</P>
<P>
	The ancient Olympic Games began a pattern of commercialized  
victory after winners began to take home prize money and 
privileges. The Games subsequently went into decline because of 
corruption. Will the modern Olympics follow the same path as the 
ancient Olympics?

<P>
	The Sydney (Australia) Morning Herald, on massacre at Racak:  
</P>
<P>
	Back in October when the United States envoy Richard Holbrooke  
brokered a cease-fire agreement over Kosovo, President Clinton was 
asked if his Yugoslav counterpart, Slobodan Milosevic, could be 
trusted to stick to his promises. ``Balkan graveyards are filled 
with President Milosevic's broken promises,'' Clinton replied. Now 
there are at least 45 more bodies to be buried in a Balkan 
graveyard -- victims of what appears to be a massacre of ethnic 
Albanians by Serb security forces near the village of Racak outside 
the provincial capital of Pristina. ... 
</P>
<P>
	If the brutality continues in Kosovo, international public  
opinion will eventually demand outside intervention, whatever the 
risks or unresolved consequences. The Racak massacre may not mark 
the decisive turning point but it does bring it that much closer. 
Western diplomats would be well advised to ponder the ``What 
then?'' question -- and come up with some answer quickly. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 18  
</P>
<P>
	Sydsvenska Dagbladet, Malmoe, Sweden, on massacre at Racak:  
</P>
<P>
	The killing of Kosovo Albanian civilians in the village of Racak  
was condemned together by a shocked world. But what then? 
</P>
<P>
	.... The truce that was negotiated in October after NATO  
threatened to attack Serbian military targets is now not worth very 
much. Obviously, those guilty in the massacre should stand before 
the Hague tribunal, but the question is how this will come to pass. 
The Serbian leadership in Belgrade hardly will cooperate. There is 
also the risk that the rebels in the Kosovo Albanian KLA will 
escalate the fighting. Anxiety about a new drawn-out war in the 
Balkans should not be underrated. ... 
</P>
<P>
	Condemnation, goodwill and demands that Saturday's outrage be  
investigated don't count for anything. Power must be placed behind 
the words. Only NATO has that power. 

</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
	La Repubblica, Rome, on the Russian political situation:  
</P>
<P>
	President Boris Yeltsin's latest illness makes the situation in  
Russia even more delicate than it was before. The ``deep coma'' of 
the Russian economy, which has had serious repercussions on the 
world markets, could become even more critical in the absence of a 
clear political leadership. 
</P>
<P>
	Since months now, Yeltsin has been turning over most  
responsibilities to (Prime Minister Yevgeny) Primakov. 
</P>
<P>
	For this reason both opposition parties and foreign investors  
call for early elections. Despite his public denials, even Primakov 
would now welcome the possibility, being considered Yelstin's most 
likely successor. ... 
</P>
<P>
	A strong political leadership, capable of reassuring the  
international markets, is the only possibility Russia has to 
rebuild its economy. 
</P>
<P>
	If this uncertainty and this unclear ``balance of powers''  
continues, even those investors who believe Russia can still find a 
way out of the crisis, would definitively abandon their 
investments. 

</P>
<P>
	Jan. 19  
</P>
<P>
	The Times of India, New Delhi, on Pakistan and China:  
</P>
<P>
	Where did Pakistan get its plutonium for (its May, 1998 nuclear)  
tests when it was clearly not producing any? The obvious answer is 
China. Some U.S. analysts with official connections who visited 
Delhi last week attempted to provide cover for the continuing 
China-Pakistan proliferation linkage by arguing that Pakistan's 
nuclear program is far more advanced tha Indians think and, 
therefore, India should negotiate strategic restraint with 
Pakistan. India should make it clear that in its view, the 
Pakistani arsenal is only an extension of the Chinese arsenal. ... 
India also should officially take up the issue of China's 
continuing breach of the NPT (Nonproliferation Treaty) with the 
other nuclear weapons powers, as well as Japan and Germany.

	KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) -- Jacksonville offensive coordinator Chris  
Palmer and Tampa Bay secondary coach Herman Edwards are the latest 
additions to the list of candidates for the Kansas City Chiefs' 
head coaching job. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chiefs have received permission from the Jaguars to talk to  
Palmer, who has been Jacksonville's offensive coordinator for two 
seasons. He has also been an assistant at New England and Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, who was Kansas City's secondary coach from 1992-94,  
interviewed Tuesday night in Mobile, Ala., with Chiefs general 
manager Carl Peterson. 
</P>
<P>
	Edwards, who also scouted for the Chiefs from 1990-92 and in  
1995, was a defensive back in Philadelphia when Peterson was in the 
Eagles' player personnel department. 
</P>
<P>
	``My whole pro career has really revolved around Carl, other  
than this time in Tampa,'' Edwards said. 
</P>
<P>
	Other candidates for the job include Jets defensive coordinator  
Bill Belichick, former Carolina coach Dom Capers and three Chiefs 
assistants: offensive coordinator Jimmy Raye, defensive coordinator 
Gunther Cunningham and receivers coach Al Saunders.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Speech Not Century's Last </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's declaration that Tuesday's  
speech was the last State of the Union address of the 20th century 
sounded logical, but wasn't quite correct. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, next year's State of the Union speech, in January 2000,  
will be the last of this century. 
</P>
<P>
	When the current Gregorian calendar was devised in the sixth  
century by a monk named Dionysius Exiguus, counting was done using 
Roman numerals, which do not include a zero. 
</P>
<P>
	So he called the first year ``I'' and counted from there.  
</P>
<P>
	That results in a century running from 1 through 100 and the  
next from 101 through 200, a millennium from 1 through 1000 and the 
next from 1001 through 2000, and so forth. 
</P>
<P>
	Thus, 2000 -- not 1999 -- is the last year of the 20th century and  
2001 will be the first year of the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Penalty Phase Begins in Capano Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WILMINGTON, Del. (AP) -- Prosecutors began presenting evidence  
today to persuade jurors to recommend the death penalty for the 
politically connected lawyer convicted of murdering his mistress. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury could recommend one of two options for Thomas Capano --  
life in prison or death. The final decision, however, rests with 
Superior Court Judge William Swain Lee. 
</P>
<P>
	The jury found Capano, the former state prosecutor and political  
adviser, guilty of murdering Anne Marie Fahey, Gov. Thomas Carper's 
scheduling secretary, in June 1996. Prosecutors say Capano murdered 
Ms. Fahey because she wanted to end their secret, three-year 
affair. 
</P>
<P>
	``Despite all his efforts, he was not able to conceal the truth  
that you spoke Sunday, truth that on June 27, 1996, he murdered 
Anne Marie Fahey,'' prosecutor Ferris Wharton said in opening 
arguments this morning. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense attorney Eugene Maurer, pleading for a recommendation of  
life in prison, said the jury should consider Capano's four 
daughters and elderly mother. 
</P>
<P>
	``If there is a mitigating circumstance in this hearing, it is  
the love Thomas Capano feels for his daughters and the love they 
feel for him,'' Maurer said. ``If you don't think he's worth saving 
for him, he's worth saving for others.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two of Capano's brothers, who testified against him during the  
three-month trial, have suggested they would plead for mercy during 
the penalty phase and ask that he be sentenced to life in prison. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Gerard Capano and Louis Capano Jr. confirmed Tuesday  
that both want the opportunity to go before the jury. 
</P>
<P>
	Lead defense lawyer Joseph Oteri said he would want the brothers  
to speak to the jury, as long as Capano agrees. ``It would be up to 
Tom because I would certainly want it,'' Oteri said.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Welcomes Clinton Pledge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- President Clinton was a hit at the United  
Nations when he pledged in his State of the Union address to work 
with Congress to pay the United States' U.N. dues and debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Members of the U.N. Security Council watching the address  
Tuesday night during breaks in negotiations on Kosovo burst into 
applause when the president said he wanted the money paid. U.N. 
Secretary-General Kofi Annan was also pleased to hear Clinton renew 
his pledge, spokesman Fred Eckhard said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States owes about $1.4 billion to the United Nations  
and is perennially late in paying its annual dues. 
</P>
<P>
	In his address to Congress, Clinton said: ``The United Nations  
plays a crucial role, with allies sharing burdens America might 
otherwise bear alone. America needs a strong and effective U.N. I 
want to work with this new Congress to pay our dues and our 
debts.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the United Nations, U.S. envoy Nancy Soderberg said there was  
``quite a bit of interest'' in Clinton's speech by Security Council 
members. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked how council members responded, Soderberg replied: ``They  
clapped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eckhard noted that while Clinton was speaking to Congress, Annan  
was addressing the Council on Foreign Relations on the importance 
of the U.S.-U.N. relationship. 
</P>
<P>
	``The United Nations needs the United States to achieve our  
goals, and I believe the United States needs the United Nations no 
less,'' Annan said. ``I hope that together we can ensure an ever 
closer relationship in the years ahead.''

<HEADLINE> Virginia Executes Convicted Killer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JARRATT, Va. (AP) -- A drug dealer convicted in the shooting  
deaths of a couple was executed by injection Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Arlo Sheppard, 27, was found guilty in the 1993 slayings of  
Richard and Rebecca Rosenbluth in their suburban Richmond home. 
Sheppard insisted he was not the trigger man. 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard, asked for a final statement by Warden David Garraghty,  
mumbled four dates and, after each one, said, ``I love you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sheppard's attorney, Chris Collins, said he believes the dates  
were birthdays of family members or close friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Sheppard and an accomplice, Andre Graham, were  
cocaine dealers who killed the Rosenbluths when their finances 
began to dwindle. Autopsies detected cocaine in the Rosenbluths' 
bodies, and drug paraphernalia was found in their home. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosenbluth, 40, was shot twice in the head and his wife, 35, was  
shot four times in the head and neck. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham received a life term in the Rosenbluths' slayings and is  
on death row for another murder.

<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Home shoppers can buy airline tickets, Beanie  
Babies and garden tools via computer. Why not a $9 million 
Rembrandt painting? 
</P>
<P>
	Sotheby's, the New York auction house, said Tuesday that it will  
spend $25 million to launch sothebys.com, an Internet site where 
the public will be able to bid on antiques, art, jewelry, sports 
memorabilia and other collectibles. 
</P>
<P>
	The value of items on the virtual auction block initially will  
be capped at about $10,000. More expensive items will be posted 
when imaging technology improves enough to give clear views of 
items from multiple angles. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no point in having a fuzzy image on a $100,000 item,''  
said Susan Solomon, head of the new venture. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotheby's first major online auction, planned for July, will  
feature baseball memorabilia. 
</P>
<P>
	While online auction sites have become extremely popular,  
consumer groups say the sites have produced more consumer 
complaints than any other Internet category because of shoddy 
merchandise and other fraud. 
</P>
<P>
	Sotheby's said it would only sell merchandise from the auction  
house itself or reputable art dealers. And bids will only be 
accepted from customers who have registered their charge card 
numbers in advance. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials at Christie's, another leading New York auction house,  
said they were also considering an online auction site.

<HEADLINE>  Falcons Ride Andersen to Super Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Morten Andersen usually went to the Super  
Bowl as a television analyst for his native Denmark. 
</P>
<P>
	This year, they'll have to find someone else.  
</P>
<P>
	The 38-year-old Andersen, long regarded as one of the NFL's  
dominant kickers, will finally be on the field for a Super Bowl 
rather than behind the microphone when his Atlanta Falcons meet the 
Denver Broncos. 
</P>
<P>
	``Given the two choices,'' he said Wednesday after the Falcons  
held their first practice for the Jan. 31 game in Miami, ``I'm real 
glad where I'm at.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It took 17 long seasons -- the first 13 with the New Orleans  
Saints, the last four in Atlanta -- before his dream came into 
focus, standing 38 yards away between two tall, yellow posts at the 
Metrodome. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got my target,'' Andersen said Wednesday, recalling his  
game-winning kick in the 30-27 overtime victory over Minnesota in 
the NFC championship game. ``I looked through to see all the arms 
waving (in the crowd), but there were no distractions. I was very 
single-minded of purpose, really. I felt very comfortable. It was 
surprising, really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Well, not that surprising. Andersen has been making those type  
of kicks throughout his career, 26 in all. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some people love the pressure,'' Falcons coach Dan Reeves  
said. ``It's like Michael Jordan wants the basketball when a lot of 
people want to pass it. It's like John Elway wants the football 
with two minutes to go and the game on the line. He's better in 
that situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think Morten is that way, too.''  
</P>
<P>
	Tight end O.J. Santiago, who caught a crucial pass on the  
winning drive in overtime, figured the game was over as soon as the 
Falcons crossed midfield. 
</P>
<P>
	``I knew Morten was automatic,'' Santiago said. ``I went over to  
the sideline and some of the guys were grabbing hands and wanted to 
grab my hand. I looked at them and said, `Hey, I've not held hands 
on one field goal all year. I've not been on my knees (in prayer) 
for one field goal all year. This is just another field goal for 
Mort. It's automatic.''' 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen holds the NFL record with 35 field goals of at least 50  
yards in his career, but the conversation focuses on his steadfast 
mental outlook rather than his strong left leg when he's discussing 
the finer points of kicking. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know if you guys believe this, but visualization -- if  
you do it enough -- is a very powerful thing,'' he told a group of 
reporters. ``Your mind is so powerful, it tells the body what to 
do. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've trained for many years now. My mind is pretty well  
trained to do what I want it to do. That's what I rehearse. That's 
what I take pride in. That's a big part of my routine. My dominant 
response came to the forefront when I needed it, and that was a 
positive response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen can sympathize with his Minnesota counterpart, Gary  
Anderson, who had not missed a kick all season until a 38-yarder 
late in the fourth quarter slid just outside the left upright. 
</P>
<P>
	That provided Atlanta with an opening. The Falcons scored the  
tying touchdown with less than a minute to go in regulation, then 
Andersen won it almost 12 minutes into the extra period. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know how he must feel,'' the Atlanta kicker said. ``I think  
it's important that everybody who watched that game, watched this 
year, to not put all the blame in his lap. That's really not fair. 
He had a tremendous year, and no one should take that away from 
him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Andersen kept hoping he would one day play in a Super Bowl,  
though his chances seemed more and more remote with each passing 
year. Until this season, he had never been on the winning side in a 
playoff game, much less gotten a chance to play for the NFL title. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would always say at the end of the year, `Man, another year  
and we didn't do it,''' Andersen said. ``But I kept the faith. I 
just felt that patience and faith was going to pay off. That's what 
I kept saying. The prize was still hanging there.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Now, he's got a chance to grab it.

<HEADLINE> Senate Honors Michael Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As if Michael Jordan hasn't had enough  
accolades and best wishes from all over the globe, the U.S. Senate 
has added its voice to the list. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday -- at the bipartisan behest of Illinois Sens. Dick  
Durbin, a Democrat, and Peter Fitzgerald, a Republican -- the Senate 
took a break from President Clinton's impeachment trial to honor 
the former Chicago Bulls great. 
</P>
<P>
	The Senate unanimously approved Resolution No. 23 -- so named for  
Jordan's now-retired jersey -- to celebrate how Jordan ``helped make 
the long, hard winters bearable for millions of Chicagoans.'' It 
was the only legislative business conducted Wednesday by the 
Senate. 
</P>
<P>
	The two-page resolution noted Jordan's six championships, five  
MVP awards, 10 scoring titles, Olympic gold medals, ``unsurpassed 
level of professionalism,'' and contributions to the community 
through charities he has established. It praised Jordan for 
inspiring others to follow their dreams when he retired once before 
to try to play baseball for the Chicago White Sox and to finish 
college at the University of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Given all those accomplishments, the Senate officially  
congratulated the 35-year-old superstar and millionaire and 
expressed ``its wishes that Michael Jordan enjoy his life after 
basketball with his wife, Juanita, and their three children, 
Jeffrey, Marcus and Jasmine.''

<HEADLINE> Greenspan Faults Soc. Security Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today  
criticized a key part of President Clinton's Social Security rescue 
plan, saying the government could damage the economy by investing 
huge sums of money in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, an influential voice Congress often turns to on  
economic matters, said he supported Clinton's major idea to put 62 
percent of the government's budget surpluses into Social Security's 
cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he had serious objections to a a provision allowing  
a government board to direct about a quarter of those savings into 
stock market investments. It is unlikely that these investments 
could be insulated from political considerations, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, Greenspan said it is more important to use budget  
surpluses to reduce the federal debt as a way of boosting the 
national savings rate.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Education Plan Is Ambitious </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's five-step education plan  
would push goals even his Republican opponents can applaud -- annual 
report cards on school performance, more choice for parents and no 
automatic promotions for failing students. 
</P>
<P>
	But on Wednesday, the Education Department said it had yet to  
draft a plan to accomplish Clinton's goals. Many states already are 
spending millions on their own plans to achieve similar goals, and 
it's unclear how the federal effort -- if approved by Congress -- 
would fit into that. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union speech Tuesday night, Clinton said he  
would send Congress a bill to ensure that: 
</P>
<P>
	--Schools stop promoting students who are failing.  
</P>
<P>
	--Teachers are qualified to teach subjects they are assigned.  
</P>
<P>
	--States fix or shut down low-performing schools.  
</P>
<P>
	--Parents get annual report cards on schools' performance.  
</P>
<P>
	--Schools maintain disciplined classrooms.  
</P>
<P>
	Clinton said he would seek in his budget $200 million to help  
states fix their schools and $600 million to triple funding for 
after-school and summer catch-up programs for failing students. But 
he didn't elaborate on how to reach his other goals. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, department officials said they were busy working  
out proposals that would tie the $15 billion that states get from 
the federal education budget to Clinton's accountability goals. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to invest the people's money more in what works and  
eliminate what doesn't,'' said Education Secretary Richard Riley. 
He stopped short of calling the plan a ``crackdown'' on states that 
are not moving quickly enough against failing schools. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans will want to ensure that states and local school  
districts maintain adequate control over their schools without 
interference from the federal government, said Rep. William 
Goodling, R-Pa., chairman of the House committee on education. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans want those common-sense education ideas -- not more  
regulations, nor federal tests, nor unfunded mandates, nor 
duplicative programs,'' Goodling said in a written response. ``We 
must guard against arbitrary standards to be imposed on local 
schools.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Congress never approved Clinton's previous plan to establish  
national voluntary tests for students. 
</P>
<P>
	Gerald N. Tirozzi, assistant education secretary for elementary  
and secondary education, said the department would work with 
education advocates to develop plenty of guidance and help for 
states. 
</P>
<P>
	Existing state plans are a mixed bag. For example, 48 states  
test their students, but only 19 make those test scores a condition 
for graduating high school. And 36 states issue report cards on 
schools, but just 16 give themselves the power to close, take over 
or even fix the failures. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are not setting federal standards. States will decide what  
their assessments will be,'' Riley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republican Gov. Ed Schafer of North Dakota said high-scoring  
states like his don't need Clinton's proposals. ``If you ask 
teachers, they say get rid of the federal regulations, get rid of 
the federal bureaucracy, let us get into our classrooms and 
teach,'' Schafer said in a Republican Governors' Association 
conference call. 
</P>

<HEADLINE>  Boxer Hopkins Speaks Out at Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- IBF middleweight champion Bernard Hopkins lashed  
out Wednesday during a hearing into the business of professional 
boxing -- a session he was warned not to attend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I got 10 calls in the last two days when it was found out I  
was coming here,'' Hopkins said. ``They said, `Man, you're messing 
your career up.' '' 
</P>
<P>
	Hopkins said the callers were promoters.  
</P>
<P>
	``Fighters have no chance against promoters,'' Hopkins said.  
``It's like a welterweight fighting Mike Tyson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm 33 years old,'' Hopkins continued. ``My business is  
boxing. I'm not a cop on the side. I'm not a security guard. I have 
nothing against cops and security guards. I don't want to get 
arrested when I go outside here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hopkins, a champion for the last four years of a career that  
began in 1989, said he has made money and saved it. 
</P>
<P>
	``I might be one of the safest boxers in boxing,'' he said. ``I  
don't spend a dime. I don't leave tips, either -- so don't eat with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hopkins, of Philadelphia, appeared on the second of three days  
of hearings conducted by the National Association of Attorneys 
General Boxing Task Force at the Downtown Athletic Club, home of 
college football's Heisman Trophy. 
</P>
<P>
	The task force chairman is New York Attorney General Eliot  
Spitzer. He wasn't present Wednesday, but Illinois Attorney General 
Jim Ryan, the vice chairman, was there. 
</P>
<P>
	Spitzer has said the hearings could lead to proposed federal  
legislation to benefit boxers. 
</P>
<P>
	A year ago, Sen. John McCain of Arizona mustered enough support  
to pass a law mandating modest safety reforms in boxing, including 
the introduction of identification cards designed to keep suspended 
or injured fighters from returning to the ring in other states, or 
under assumed names. 
</P>
<P>
	Appearing during the public hearing Wednesday were promoters  
Dino Duva, Cedric Kushner and Dan Goosen, president of America 
Presents. Bob Arum and Butch Lewis did not appear as scheduled. Don 
King was not scheduled to appear. 
</P>
<P>
	Others scheduled to appear who did not were Jay Larkin of  
Showtime, Lou DiBella of HBO and Bob Yalen of ESPN. Showtime and 
HBO and their pay-per-view arms are the major television players in 
boxing. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopkins, scheduled to defend the title against Robert Allen of  
Atlanta Feb. 6 at Washington, was the star of the show. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he had a four-fight deal with Lewis. Hopkins said when  
he won a world title, Lewis claimed the contract called for a 
four-year extension. Hopkins went to court, got out of the contract 
in 1997 and currently is promoted by American Presents. 
</P>
<P>
	Hopkins said when he fought Roy Jones Jr. for the vacant IBF  
title in 1993 -- he still was under contract to Lewis -- he and Jones 
were to split $1.4 million, but instead split $500,000. Hopkins, 
who lost a decision to Jones, said he ended up $150,000 after 
paying his then manager $100,000, 
</P>
<P>
	Duva, Kushner and Goosen all said fighters deserve a fair share  
of profits and should be represented in contract negotiations. They 
also said promoters spend a lot of money developing fighters and 
often lose money when prospects don't succeed. 
</P>
<P>
	Because it takes time to develop a fighter, Kushner noted, a  
promoter needs exclusive contracts to protect his interests -- to 
keep a fighter from leaving him when he becomes successful. 
</P>
<P>
	``I believe a boxer needs a promoter, especially if all aspects  
of boxing are functioning as they should,'' Duva said. ``Boxers 
should focus on boxing.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Has Strong Approval Ratings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton bolstered his already robust  
standing in the polls with a State of the Union address that 
focused on problems facing Americans but didn't mention his own 
biggest problem -- the Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls released Wednesday by ABC, CBS and NBC suggested the  
public's approval of Clinton's job performance are near all-time 
highs even as the Senate is hearing evidence on whether the 
president should be removed from office. 
</P>
<P>
	His job approval rating ranged from 66 percent in the ABC poll  
to 72 percent in the CBS poll to 76 percent in the NBC poll. His 
approval numbers were three to five points higher after the speech, 
depending on the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Almost four out of five Americans who watched President  
Clinton's State of the Union address approved of most of his 
proposals and agreed with his decision not to mention his 
impeachment trial, according to several polls. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-fourths of those questioned in a CNN/USA Today/Gallup poll  
of people who watched the State of the Union said the proposals 
suggested by Clinton will save Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	By better than a 2-to-1 margin, those polled by ABC said it's  
more important for the federal government to use the surplus for 
Medicare and Social Security rather than tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans favor applying part of the surplus for Social  
Security, but want to use the remainder for tax cuts. The president 
advocated using the surplus to bolster a number of areas of 
spending, most notably Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's ebullient description of the nation's economic  
growth had an effect on those who watched the speech. After the 
speech, 40 percent thought the nation's economy was excellent, 
compared to 27 percent before the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The bump in Clinton's approval rating comes at a time when his  
sustained job approval numbers are among the strongest for a 
president in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The president's average job approval rating for the last quarter  
of 1998 was 66 percent in the Gallup poll, one of the highest 
sustained performances by a president since President Lyndon 
Johnson's early years, according to Frank Newport, editor in chief 
of the Gallup Poll. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport noted that the public's approval in a poll of Clinton's  
handling of the economy was at 81 percent this weekend, as high as 
Gallup has recorded for any president on that measure, while his 
ratings on honesty and moral character have steadily dropped. 
</P>
<P>
	``His handling of the economy is apparently more important to  
Americans than the fact that they can't describe him as honest and 
trustworthy,'' Newport said, adding that apparently ``one is more 
important to them than the other.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only time in the last three decades that presidents have  
enjoyed stronger approval rates in the Gallup poll for a sustained 
period were the first quarter of President Carter's term and the 
surge of popularity enjoyed by President Bush after the capture of 
Panamanian leader Manuel Noriega and the victory in the Persian 
Gulf War. 
</P>
<P>
	Only two other presidents in the last 50 years have served two  
full terms, Dwight Eisenhower and Ronald Reagan. Newport noted that 
Eisenhower was at 57 percent and Reagan was at 48 percent job 
approval at similar points in their presidencies. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tuesday night's State of the Union address, Clinton's  
salesmanship for his programs helped sell people on Clinton 
personally as well. The number of people with a positive view of 
Clinton grew to 51 percent in Gallup's poll, compared to 38 percent 
before the speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Half of those polled by ABC said they trust Clinton to do a  
better job than the Republicans over the next few years in dealing 
with the country's problems, while about a third said they trust 
the Republicans more. That's a dramatic turnaround from the GOP's 
heady days in early 1995 after their takeover of Congress, when 
more than half trusted the Republicans more with the nation's 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	About six out of 10 oppose Clinton's removal, saying his actions  
do not warrant such an action, according to several of the polls. 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS poll of 930 adults had a margin of error of plus or  
minus 3 percentage points. The ABC poll of 584 adults had a margin 
of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. The NBC poll of 
620 adults had margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage 
points. The CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll of 454 adults had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 5 percentage points.

<HEADLINE> Sumitomo Trust Denies Merger Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sumitomo Trust &AMP; Banking Co. denied Thursday a  
Japanese newspaper report that it and Daiwa Bank Ltd. have begun 
merger negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is absolutely no truth to the report. We are not in any  
way in such talks,'' Sumitomo Trust said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo is a top Japanese trust bank, while Daiwa is one of  
Japan's 10 largest city banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Kogyo Shimbun, an industrial daily, reported Thursday  
that the two banks have started negotiations with a view to merge 
around April next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said it would suspend trading  
Thursday in Sumitomo Trust and Daiwa shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger report comes amid a major reconsolidation of Japan's  
financial industry, especially the bad-loan plagued banking sector. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, two trust banks -- Chuo Trust and Banking Co. and  
Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. -- announced a tentative agreement to 
merge.

<HEADLINE> Hawaii Now Starts the News On Time </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- Many things make this a tropical paradise, like  
the year-round warm weather and the relaxed way of life. 
</P>
<P>
	But until recently, TV scheduling was a little too relaxed.  
</P>
<P>
	Now Hawaii is saying ``Aloha'' (as in hello) to ``The 10 O'clock  
News'' at 10 p.m. No more nights of late starts because TV stations 
let more commercials run overtime. 
</P>
<P>
	For decades, Hawaii's network TV affiliates gave ``late news'' a  
new meaning, starting up to 10 minutes past the hour. But Fox's 
KHON and ABC's KITV now start their 10 o'clock news on time. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think it's a very good idea,'' said Roberta Weatherford, who  
often gets home from her job at the state Capitol too late to watch 
the evening news. 
</P>
<P>
	``Like, how come you're advertising the 10 O'clock News and it  
doesn't come on until 10:15? If it's going to come on at 10:15 ... 
tell me,'' she said. ``Then it's my choice on whether I'm going to 
pry my eyes open or not.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hawaii's two other network affiliates -- CBS' KGMB and NBC's KHNL  
-- will continue their tardy ways for now, although they expect to 
make the change at some point to what the industry calls ``clock 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So far, reviews of the change are positive.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's something new for us to try to hit 10 o'clock exactly and  
have everything ready to go,'' reported KHON general manager Kent 
Baker. ``We've never had to worry about it before.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nine of 10 Hawaii viewers subscribe to cable, where only the  
network stations deviate from ``clock time'' programming that 
starts on the hour or the half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``To compete in a 70-channel universe, you have to be on the  
clock. You can't be expecting your viewers to wait to watch the 
news when they switch over from a show that ended on time,'' said 
Walter Zimmerman, news director at KITV. 
</P>
<P>
	``The viewers will like it better. They'll be able to set their  
VCRs at the right time,'' he added. 
</P>
<P>
	CBS and NBC affiliates are taking a wait-and-see stance.  
</P>
<P>
	February ratings, released March 15, should reflect any viewer  
impact by the change. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to hold off right now and see how this plays  
out,'' said KHNL general manager John Fink. ``This has been going 
on for 30 years, and it'll take more time to make the adjustment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Late news is a practice that dates to the early years of  
television, before satellite transmissions, when tapes of network 
programs were shipped by air from the mainland. These programs were 
shown a week late and not necessarily in the same time slots as on 
the mainland. 
</P>
<P>
	To cover the added shipping costs, networks allowed local  
stations to delay successive program starts, beginning at 6:30 
p.m., in order to squeeze in a few more prime-time ads. 
</P>
<P>
	Satellite transmissions, introduced in the 1970s, allowed  
same-day network programming, but the ad padding didn't stop. ``The 
local people are used to it,'' Baker said, ``but we get calls from 
newcomers who wonder why it's happening.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He believes change is likely because all four network affiliates  
are owned by mainland companies that can support them financially 
during the transition. ``We'll lose some (money) at the 
beginning,'' Baker said, ``but we expect that will change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The switch, he said, should increase competition in the market,  
raise the price of prime-time commercials, and help keep 
advertisers from getting lost in a series of back-to-back 
commercials. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now,'' Baker added, ``we take any ad that comes in the  
door'' and make it fit by pushing back the start of the local news. 
</P>
<P>
	Fink and KGMB general manager Ray Depa said the switch may  
double what advertisers now pay since there would be less time 
available. 
</P>
<P>
	But Zimmerman said the switch should help most advertisers  
because viewers would no longer be deluged. 
</P>
<P>
	And for viewers ... that would be paradise at last.  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Bank of Japan: Economy Still Severe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's economic deterioration is showing signs of  
slowing, but the overall outlook for the economy remains bleak, the 
central bank said Thursday in its monthly report. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising public investment is helping to rein in production  
declines, but private consumption remains stagnant and corporate 
profits continue to worsen, the Bank of Japan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The economic deterioration in Japan is moderating gradually,  
mainly due to the increase in public investment,'' the central bank 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The bank said that the government's fiscal stimulus measures  
seem to have improved financial conditions at Japanese 
corporations. 
</P>
<P>
	In spite of the bright signs, the bank warned that an immediate  
self-sustained recovery in private demand was ``hardly expected.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The central bank said that a long-term appreciation in the yen  
could hurt exports, one of the only positive sectors of Japan's 
economy. Stock prices have weakened in reaction to the yen's 
strength and the rise in long-term rates. 
</P>
<P>
	Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi promised this week at the opening of  
the regular session of Parliament to turn Japan's recessionary 
economy around in 1999 and bring about growth of 0.5 percent in the 
gross domestic product.

<HEADLINE> Wall Street Surge Worries Greenspan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A week after Wall Street shrugged off a new  
bout of global turbulence, this one coming from Brazil, Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan issued a fresh warning to the 
high-flying stock market. But investors barely flinched. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan told lawmakers Wednesday that he saw three primary  
threats to the U.S. economy -- a mushrooming trade deficit caused by 
spreading recessions overseas, a potentially inflationary shortage 
of workers and an unsustainably high stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	Wall Street's recent performance ``will have difficulty in being  
sustained'' given a slowdown in corporate profit growth, he told 
the House Ways and Means Committee. In fact, the market's quick 
rebound after a scare this fall from the collapse of the Russian 
economy was of an ``unusual nature,'' the central bank chairman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average fell 54 points from the  
previous day's close upon the release of Greenspan's remarks, his 
first comprehensive assessment of economic conditions in three 
months. But it soon recovered and was up as much as 125 points 
before closing at 9,336 for a loss of 19 points. 
</P>
<P>
	``The markets aren't listening,'' said economist Mark Zandi of  
Regional Financial Associates in West Chester, Pa. ``They're 
running to the beat of their own drummer.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Greenspan, an influential voice Congress often turns  
to on economic matters, said he supported President Clinton's 
proposal to put 62 percent of the government's budget surpluses 
into the Social Security trust fund. 
</P>
<P>
	But he said he opposed Clinton's plan to have a government board  
direct about a quarter of those savings -- more than $600 billion 
over 15 years -- into stock investments. It's not feasible to 
completely insulate such a board from political influence, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans on the committee sought his endorsement of an  
across-the-board 10 percent tax cut. Greenspan said he preferred 
using surpluses to reduce the $5.5 trillion national debt. But, he 
said, a tax cut was far preferable to a spending increase and an 
across-the-board cut was a relatively simple way to do it. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's testimony on the economy suggested the central bank  
has no immediate plans to cut interest rates and could even be 
taken as justification for a rate increase later in the year, Zandi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fed policy-makers cut rates three times in the space of seven  
weeks this fall, cushioning the financial system against spillover 
from Russia. Greenspan said he and his colleagues were concerned 
about the likely impact of the turmoil on U.S. economic activity 
but ``were not attempting to prop up equity prices'' at a specific 
level. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has not been, and is not now, our policy or intent,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said Wall Street has reacted reasonably well to  
Brazil's decision to devalue its currency but Brazil must follow 
through by curbing its budget deficit and containing inflation. 
</P>
<P>
	Financial markets remain fragile, he said, and the Fed ``must  
continue to pay particular attention'' to them because a big drop 
might precipitate a ``considerable weakening of consumer demand,'' 
which accounts for two-thirds of economic activity. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also warned that America's chronic trade deficit was  
``not sustainable indefinitely'' and at some point would ``create a 
major reverberation back on the American economy. 
</P>
<P>
	But he cautioned that erecting trade barriers -- to foreign  
steel, for instance -- could touch off a cycle of retaliation 
between nations. Fear of growing protectionism hurts stock prices, 
he said.

	Greenspan called current economic conditions ``outstanding'' but  
said some moderation in economic growth might be required to 
sustain the expansion. 
</P>
<P>
	``Through the end of 1998, the economy continued to grow more  
rapidly than can be currently accommodated on an ongoing basis,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Improved productivity has so far prevented labor shortages from  
igniting inflation, but cannot be expected to do so indefinitely, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Federal Reserve survey of regional economic conditions through  
Jan. 11, released Wednesday, found labor-market tightness in all 
parts of the country. Prices, however, were stable or declining. 
</P>
<P>
	Most regions are showing solid economic growth overall, said the  
survey known as the ``beige book,'' but growth in some areas -- 
manufacturing, farming, oil and mining -- had slowed in some 
regions. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, housing construction shot to 11-year highs in both  
December and all of 1998, propelled by plentiful jobs and low 
mortgage rates. Builders started construction on new units at a 
seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.72 million units last month, 
up 3.5 percent from November, the government said. During the year, 
builders began work on 1.62 million units, up 9.6 percent from 1997 
and the most since 1987.

<HEADLINE>  Scandinavian Phone Cos. To Merge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The state telephone companies of Sweden  
and Norway on Wednesday announced plans to merge and to sell 
one-third of the merged company's shares on the open market. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger aims to keep the state-owned telecoms operations  
competitive in an increasingly tough market. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger between Sweden's Telia and Norway's Telenor would  
create one of the Nordic countries' largest companies, worth about 
155 billion Swedish kronor ($20 billion). 
</P>
<P>
	Initially, Sweden will hold 60 percent of the shares in the new  
concern and Norway the other 40 percent. But by the end of next 
year, each country's share is to be reduced to 33.4 percent and the 
remainder put up for sale on the Stockholm bourse. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger, which must be approved by the parliaments of both  
countries and by the European Union, was announced simultaneously 
in Stockholm and Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
	``This new company will be very competitive,'' said Norwegian  
Communications Minister Odd Einar Doerum in Oslo. 
</P>
<P>
	``We think that this Nordic combination is the right way to go  
if we are to retain our leading position in the telecommunications 
area,'' said his Swedish counterpart, Bjoern Rosengren. 
</P>
<P>
	In February 1998, the two companies called off merger talks  
because the governments failed to agree on a corporate structure. 
There is now broad political support for the merger. 
</P>
<P>
	Telia, which is the Nordic countries' biggest phone company,  
employs about 32,000 people, and had 1997 profits of about 4 
billion kronor ($540 million). Telenor, Norway's sixth largest 
company, employs 19,600 people and reported a profits of 1.9 
billion kroner ($260 million) for 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is expected to mean that some jobs will become  
redundant, but there were no estimates as to how many positions 
might be eliminated. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company will have its headquarters in the Swedish  
capital of Stockholm, and will be led by Norwegian Tormod 
Harmansen, the managing director of Telenor. Swedish Jan Stenberg, 
chairman of the board of Telia, will be chairman of the new 
company. Stenberg is managing director of the Scandinavian Airlines 
System, which is owned by Norway, Sweden and Denmark.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Defense Excerpts-1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Excerpts from President Clinton's defense team presentation  
before the Senate, as transcribed by the Federal Document Clearing 
House: 

</P>
<P>
	``I welcome this opportunity to speak for President Clinton. He  
has a strong and a compelling case, one that is based on the facts, 
in the record, on the law and on the Constitution.'' -- Greg Craig, 
special counsel to the president. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``But first and foremost, the president's defense is based on  
the grand jury transcript itself. I urge you to read that 
transcript, watch the videotape. You will see this president make 
painful, difficult admissions, beginning with his acknowledgment of 
an improper and wrongful relationship with Monica Lewinsky. You 
will see that the president was truthful. 
</P>
<P>
	``And after reading, seeing, hearing and studying the evidence  
for yourself, not relying on what someone else says it is, not 
relying no someone else's description, characterization or 
paraphrase of the president's testimony, we believe that you will 
conclude that what the president did and said in the grand jury was 
not unlawful and that you must not remove him from office.'' -- 
Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``I plan to divide my presentation into three parts.  
</P>
<P>
	``First, to tell you how really bad this article is legally,  
structurally and constitutionally, and to argue that it falls well 
below the most basic, minimal standards and should not be used to 
impeach and remove this president or any president from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Second, to address the various allegations directly.  
</P>
<P>
	``And third, to give you a few larger thoughts in response to  
some of the arguments from last week.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Simply put, if the president didn't obstruct justice, he  
didn't commit perjury when he denied it.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``But the most striking thing about Article I is what it does  
not say. It alleges perjury generally, but it does not allege a 
single perjurious statement specifically. 
</P>
<P>
	``The majority drafted the article this way despite pleas from  
other members of the committee and from counsel for the president 
that the article take care to be precise when it makes its 
allegations.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The requirement that a defendant be given adequate notice of  
what he is charged with carries constitutional dimensions, and the 
failure to provide that notice violates due process of law. ... 
Imagine a robbery indictment that failed to indicate who or what 
was robbed and what property was stolen. How could you possibly 
defend against the charge that you just stole something, but you 
don't know what it is, and it's nothing specific.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``This requirement is even more stringent for perjury  
prosecutions. Descriptions, paraphrases, summaries of testimony 
that is alleged to be perjurious are not accepted. The quotation 
must be there, or the definition should be so close that there can 
be no doubt as to what is intended.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``By failing to be specific in this article as to what it is  
precisely that the president said that should cause him to be 
removed from office, has the House effectively and 
unconstitutionally ceded its authority under this provision of the 
Constitution to the managers, who are not authorized to exercise 
that authority? 
</P>
<P>
	``By bringing general charges in this article, the House  
Judiciary Committee, and then the House of Representatives 
generally, gave enormous discretion, power and authority to the 
floor managers and their lawyers to decide what precisely the 
president was going to be charged with.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now when it comes to perjury before the grand jury, the  
majority report argued that the president had made not two, not 
three, but a whole host of perjurious statements before the grand 
jury. Some statements that were not contained in Starr referral had 
never been identified, charged, discussed or debated by the members 
during the impeachment inquiry.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``To our knowledge, many of these allegations were never  
discussed or debated by the members of the committee. And if you 
read the closing arguments of the members of the House Judiciary 
Committee, you will search in vain for any specific reference to 
many of these new allegations which are the subject of Article I. 
</P>
<P>
	``Then, we found ourselves in the Senate. Our only guide being  
the articles themselves, which as you know are general, and the 
majority report, which has no formal standing and which was filled 
with allegations and theories that had never been discussed, much 
less adopted.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The managers have sought to merge the Jones testimony with the  
grand jury testimony -- to confuse these two events, to blend and 
blur them together. The Senate must understand that these two 
events were different in every way. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the president's testimony in the Jones case, the president  
was evasive, misleading, incomplete in his answers, and as I said 
to the House Judiciary Committee, maddening. 
</P>
<P>
	``But in the federal grand jury, President Clinton was  
forthright and forthcoming. He told the truth, the whole truth and 
nothing but the truth for four long hours. And the American people 
saw that testimony, and they know that President Clinton, when he 
appeared before the grand jury, did not deny a sexual relationship 
with Miss Lewinsky. He admitted to one. They know that he did not 
deny that he was alone with Ms. Lewinsky. He repeatedly 
acknowledged that he had been alone with her on many occasions.'' -- 
Craig.

<HEADLINE> Reeves Relives His Denver Downfall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SUWANEE, Ga. (AP) -- Dan Reeves' past caught up with him  
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Faced with questions about the 12 years he spent in Denver, the  
Atlanta Falcons coach transformed a Super Bowl news conference into 
a personal catharsis, exposing his heart and soul to a hushed room 
of reporters as he openly discussed his falling out with the 
Broncos for almost a half-hour. 
</P>
<P>
	So much for putting aside old feelings heading into the Jan. 31  
game in Miami. From Reeves' point of view, it's apparent that 
there's a personal element to this game that can't be ignored. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's still a lot of hurt that won't ever go away,'' said  
Reeves, who took the Broncos to three Super Bowls before he was 
fired in 1992. ``I don't think any time you're fired -- and you've 
been in a place for 12 years and had the success we had -- that you 
understand it or say it doesn't hurt you.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves' ouster in Denver followed his well-chronicled firing of  
Mike Shanahan as quarterback coach for alleged insubornination. 
Shanahan was extremely close to quarterback John Elway, who would 
later say that playing for Reeves was ``hell.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves lasted only one more season in Denver after the ouster of  
Shanahan, who returned in 1995 as Denver's coach with Elway's 
enthusiastic blessing. Last year, they captured the Super Bowl 
victory that was never achieved during the Reeves era. 
</P>
<P>
	``You never forget those things,'' Reeves said. ``But am I a  
person that's not going to speak to (Broncos owner) Pat Bowlen or 
Mike Shanahan or John Elway? I don't live my life like that. I had 
a lot of great times with those guys. I can be cordial to them. I 
can play golf with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``I won't go out to eat with them or go socially to a function  
with them. But if I was sitting next to them at a function, I would 
have no problem carrying on a conversation. I can look back on a 
lot of great things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves recounted his version of events, beginning with his  
hiring of Shanahan in 1984 as Denver's receivers coach. A year 
later, he promoted Shanahan to offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was very impressive in his knowledge of the game,'' Reeves  
said. ``It was similar to how I was (as an assistant) with coach 
(Tom) Landry in Dallas. As I stayed with coach Landry longer and 
longer, he had more and more confidence in me. That's the way I was 
with Mike.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Reeves recommended Shanahan as coach of the Raiders in 1988,  
then hired him back as quarterback coach when Shanahan was fired by 
Al Davis four games into the '89 season. 
</P>
<P>
	But the relationship began to deteriorate when Elway was  
critical of Reeves in a 1990 column by late Denver Post columnist 
Dick Connor. Specifically, Elway said there was poor communication 
between coach and quarterback. 
</P>
<P>
	``If John Elway had a problem with me and you're coaching a  
position (such as Shanahan), why did I not know about that prior to 
reading it in the paper?'' Reeves said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	He also believes Shanahan revealed things to the quarterback  
that were said in private meetings among the coaching staff. 
</P>
<P>
	``You say things in a coaches meeting as far as critiquing a  
player that you would never say to a player,'' Reeves said. ``If 
John ever got any bad feelings about something I said, it was never 
done publicly. It had to be something coming from a staff meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, does that mean Mike did it? You have a lot of people on  
your staff. I have no proof of it. Nothing. But I did what I felt 
was best for our football team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shanahan and Elway were not available for comment Wednesday. The  
Broncos, who are playing in their second straight Super Bowl, took 
the day off.

<HEADLINE> Gary Barnett Heads to Colorado </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- In Gary Barnett, Colorado is getting a  
disciplinarian who represents a departure from the laid-back style 
of his predecessor, Rick Neuheisel. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, who revived a moribund program at Northwestern, on  
Wednesday was named the 22nd head football coach in Colorado 
history. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado athletic director Dick Tharp said Barnett's hiring is  
subject to the approval of the university's board of regents, which 
was to meet today to discuss the hiring. 
</P>
<P>
	If the board approves, as expected, Barnett will be introduced  
at a press conference Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, 52, planned to meet with the team today, as well as  
assemble his staff and familiarize himself with the status of 
Colorado's recruiting. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, returning to the school where he was an assistant for  
eight seasons under Bill McCartney, replaces Neuheisel, who left 
Colorado on Jan. 9 for the head coaching job at the University of 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett was Tharp's original choice last week, but when  
negotiations broke down, the Buffaloes turned to Denver Broncos 
offensive coordinator Gary Kubiak. Kubiak turned down the offer on 
Monday, and Tharp renewed his campaign to lure Barnett, contacting 
the coach in Houston, where he was on a recruiting trip. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett had nine years remaining on an 11-year contract he  
signed with Northwestern in 1996. An expensive buyout clause in his 
contract apparently was a stumbling block in the original talks 
with Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	In seven seasons at Northwestern, Barnett compiled a 35-45-1  
record, including 3-9 in 1998. He took over a perennial 
cellar-dweller, however, and guided the team to two conference 
titles and a Rose Bowl appearance after the 1995 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Before Barnett arrived, Northwestern failed to win more than  
four games in a season since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats won only eight games in Barnett's first three  
seasons, but the following year he led them to a 10-2 mark, 
including a 41-32 loss to Southern California in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats went 9-3 the following season, which ended with a  
48-28 loss to Tennessee in the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwestern returned to its losing ways the last two years. The  
school also was rocked by a sports betting scandal in which four 
former Wildcat football players were indicted Dec. 3, accused of 
lying about their gambling activities. Barnett was not implicated. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett has been a hot coaching commodity in recent years. His  
name was mentioned in connection with openings at Georgia, Texas, 
UCLA, Notre Dame and Oklahoma. 
</P>
<P>
	His only other head coaching job was at Fort Lewis, a Division  
II school in Durango, Colo., where he had an 8-11-1 record in 
1982-83. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado players applauded the hiring.  
</P>
<P>
	``This is a huge load off,'' quarterback Mike Moschetti said.  
``Just getting a coach this time of the year is important for 
recruiting efforts. It is exciting to get a guy who has been a 
Buffalo before. He was part of the national championship team here 
and is going to be here for a long time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cornerback Ben Kelly called the hiring ``a big relief.''  
</P>
<P>
	Offensive lineman Adam Reed, who played for Barnett one year at  
Northwestern, said, ``This will be a change for the players coming 
back. The whole attitude will change. Coach Barnett is a 
disciplinarian. He lays down guidelines, which players need.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Linebackers coach Brian Cabral, one of several Colorado  
assistants who are expected to remain, said, ``I'm glad. Gary 
brings a lot to the program. Just the fact we have a head coach 
helps. We can schedule the in-house visits during a key period in 
the recruiting process. We can all go about our business.''

<HEADLINE> Barnett May Become Colorado Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOULDER, Colo. (AP) -- Gary Barnett, wooed by many schools since  
leading Northwestern to the 1996 Rose Bowl, has accepted an offer 
to coach Colorado, according to broadcast reports. 
</P>
<P>
	KCNC-TV in Denver and WGN radio in Chicago said Barnett has been  
hired to replace Rick Neuheisel, who left Colorado on Jan. 9 to 
accept a lucrative contract at the University of Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, who spent seven years as an assistant at Colorado  
before being hired at Northwestern in 1992, was to be introduced 
today as the Buffaloes' new coach, KCNC reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett, 52, met with Colorado athletic director Dick Tharp on  
Tuesday in Houston, where the agreement was finalized, according to 
the Denver station. 
</P>
<P>
	Colorado spokesman Dave Plati said late Tuesday that he could  
not confirm or deny the report. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have not been notified to call a press conference or write a  
release,'' Plati said. ``That doesn't mean I won't be told to.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The reports came one day after Denver Broncos offensive  
coordinator Gary Kubiak turned down a chance at the Colorado job. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett was Colorado's original choice, but Tharp had trouble  
dealing with Barnett's expensive buyout clause. 
</P>
<P>
	Barnett signed an 11-year contract with Northwestern in 1996,  
but KCNC said Colorado won't have to pay Barnett's $250,000 buyout 
fee. Barnett apparently will settle with Northwestern on his own. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwestern was one of the worst programs in the country before  
Barnett arrived, having failed to win more than four games in a 
season since 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats won only eight games in Barnett's first three  
seasons, but the following year he led them to a 10-2 mark, 
including a 41-32 loss to Southern California in the Rose Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats went 9-3 the following season, which ended with a  
48-28 loss to Tennessee in the Citrus Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Northwestern returned to its losing ways the last two years,  
going 5-7 in 1997 and 3-8 in 1998. Barnett's overall record at 
Northwestern was 35-45-1 in seven seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	His only other head coaching job was at Fort Lewis, a Division  
II school in Durango where he compiled a 8-11-1 record in 1982-83. 
</P>
<P>
	Candidates for the Northwestern opening reportedly include Miami  
of Ohio coach Randy Walker and Jacksonville Jaguars offensive 
coordinator Chris Palmer.

<HEADLINE> Martian Landscape Tied to Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Underground volcanic action on ancient Mars sculpted gorges far  
larger than the Grand Canyon and melted enough water to feed floods 
of biblical proportions, two geologists suggest in a study 
published today. 
</P>
<P>
	Most scientists have attributed the gorges to the bowing and  
stretching of the terrain from surface forces. Under the new 
theory, such features were instead shaped from below by rising 
wedges of molten rock known as dikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the theory, the dikes would have also melted vast  
quantities of ice. This would explain the colossal floods that 
scientists generally believe scoured Mars 2 billion to 3 billion 
years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory, which appeared today in the journal Nature, was  
devised by geologists Dan McKenzie and Francis Nimmo at the 
University of Cambridge in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Under their scenario, dikes pushed up to within several miles of  
the surface, forcing the rock above to jut upward and outward. The 
area in the middle sagged, forming a canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the molten rock melted ice in the frozen ground,  
underground pools formed and spread and the rock above -- as if 
afloat -- shifted into the broken, chaotic pattern characteristic of 
Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The water trapped underground could have offered the sort of  
warm, moist oases where some have suggested that life could have 
survived.

<P>
	When the water ultimately found its way to the surface, it  
collected in the canyons. The two geologists calculated that such a 
process could have let loose floods of 400 trillion gallons or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie argued that a gigantic dike larger than any on Earth,  
or a series of smaller ones, could run beneath the canyon network 
known as the Valles Marineris, the planet's best-known landmark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Valles Marineris stretches about 2,500 miles -- roughly the  
distance from New York to San Francisco -- and runs as deep as six 
miles. Its walls tower more than five times higher than the Grand 
Canyon's. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred McEwen, a geologist at the University of Arizona,  
challenged the molten dike theory as a full explanation for Mars' 
canyons. He said there is scant evidence that there was full-scale 
volcanic activity, such as volcanoes or lava flow, at the time the 
gorges took shape.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Exudes Confidence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Impeached? A presidency imperiled? What trial?  
</P>
<P>
	Listening to President Clinton's address to Congress, you  
couldn't tell the mess he's in. 
</P>
<P>
	Playing to his wonkish strengths -- and to a nation happier with  
him than so many in his audience -- Clinton bundled himself up in 
his policies Tuesday night against the Republican cold. 
</P>
<P>
	That famous compartmentalizer clenched his fists or cupped and  
rolled his hands in rhythmic accompaniment to his oratory. He 
seemed as comfortable as he's ever been making a policy speech to 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	``My fellow Americans,'' he said, wrapping up it up. ``This -- is  
-- our -- moment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Polite overall, Republicans couldn't get out of the House  
chamber quickly enough when it was over, piling to the doors even 
as the Democratic applause was fading and before the president 
himself had left. 
</P>
<P>
	``I consider it a very awkward evening,'' Sen. Jeff Sessions,  
R-Ala., said after the speech. ``A lot of us (senators) were 
troubled coming here right in the middle of a trial where we're 
supposed to be deciding matters fairly and objectively.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton did what he has always managed to do, stand up there and  
talk past his immediate audience, to a nation now settled into a 
prosperous and relatively contented time. 
</P>
<P>
	His favorite phrase, ``We must,'' was delivered several dozen  
times -- 41 times in his text, somewhat fewer in his remarks, 
because he was riffing off his written speech. 
</P>
<P>
	The message to Congress was clear: There is so much left to do.  
``We'' -- together. 
</P>
<P>
	House Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, was having none of  
it. Although he did not stay away as several Republicans did, he 
boycotted in spirit. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey adjusted his tie when others applauded Clinton's  
introduction. He and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, a fellow Texan, 
fell into quick chatter during the applause lines that came in 
rapid succession throughout. 
</P>
<P>
	The center aisle was a breaker where the waves of Democratic  
ovations weakened or died, spreading through the Republican side 
mainly as ripples. 
</P>
<P>
	But a few lines on issues close to Republicans, such as success  
in welfare reform, got many of them out of their seats despite the 
stony countenance of some of their leaders. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the heroes sitting in the gallery united the politicians,  
the greatest ovation coming for Rosa Parks, of civil rights fame. 
Special guest Sammy Sosa, the home run slugger who didn't quite get 
the crown, came second, again. 
</P>
<P>
	Two acts, constitutionally derived, played on the same strange  
day. The impeachment trial, hearing Clinton's opening defense, 
continued to examine whether the president's actions were high 
crimes and misdemeanors. 
</P>
<P>
	The Framers' call on presidents to report on the state of the  
nation ``from time to time'' followed in the evening, the more 
comforting ritual. 
</P>
<P>
	In filed the Supreme Court justices in their robes, minus Chief  
Justice William Rehnquist, who is presiding in the trial. In came 
the leaders of the armed forces, their medals shining in the 
lights. Diplomats were ushered to their seats and the Cabinet's 
arrival was heralded too. 
</P>
<P>
	As usual, the justices applauded none of the policy -- indeed,  
Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg fought to stay awake. 
</P>
<P>
	The military brass sat respectfully immobile through anything  
domestic, while the Cabinet radiated enthusiasm. 
</P>
<P>
	Altogether, the separated powers and their institutions played  
out their accustomed roles, a touch of the familiar in a time 
overshadowed by the unknown.

<HEADLINE> Rockies' Owner Blasts Big Spending </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Colorado Rockies owner Jerry McMorris says  
baseball has to ``put the brakes on'' skyrocketing free-agent 
spending by a few ``mega-media ballclubs.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Case in point is the Rupert Murdoch media empire-owned Los  
Angeles Dodgers, who signed pitcher Kevin Brown to a $105 million 
contract over seven years. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not owned by a Murdoch, Disney or Ted Turner, and  
baseball can't afford the kind of imbalance where the Dodgers' 
Kevin Brown alone makes twice the Montreal Expos' entire payroll,'' 
McMorris said during a speech Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In the NFL, he added, each team gets the same TV revenue --  
``whether you're in Green Bay or New York.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Baseball, McMorris said, needs to come up with ways to share  
more funds to help smaller-market clubs compete and ``to put a 
brake on those who simply want to spend their way to the moon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McMorris said he hoped major league baseball will address the  
question of revenue-sharing during upcoming meetings in New York. 
He also wouldn't mind starting discussions of a salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	With the highest average attendance in baseball, the Rockies are  
not a have-not team. 
</P>
<P>
	However, Colorado's revenue package lags far behind teams such  
as the New York Yankees, who have a $486 million, 12-year cable 
contract and had about $170 million in revenue last season. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have no intention of becoming the Pittsburgh Penguins of  
baseball,'' McMorris said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NHL's Penguins, who have had successful records in recent  
years, have an extremely high payroll for a small-market city and 
have filed for bankruptcy protection.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Stocks Rise at Midday / Japanese Stocks  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japanese stocks gained moderately Thursday morning  
as domestic and foreign investors bought major bank issues. The 
dollar slipped against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nikkei Stock Average rose 114.91 points, or 0.82 percent, to  
14,142.96 points at the end of the morning session. On Wednesday, 
the average surged 257.61 points, or 1.87 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar bought 113.21 yen at late morning, down 0.19 yen from  
late Wednesday in Tokyo but above its level of 112.85 yen in New 
York. 
</P>
<P>
	Players welcomed reported merger talks between a major Japanese  
trust bank and a major commercial bank. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Kogyo Shimbun, an industrial daily, reported Thursday  
that Sumitomo Trust and Banking Co. and Daiwa Bank Ltd. have 
started negotiations for a merger around April of next year. 
</P>
<P>
	The two banks later denied the report.  
</P>
<P>
	The Tokyo Stock Exchange temporarily suspended trading in shares  
in the two banks as officials tried to verify the report. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger report comes amid a major reconsolidation of Japan's  
financial industry, in particular the bad-loan plagued banking 
sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the  
first section added 6.81 points, or 0.62 percent, to 1,096.88. The 
TOPIX rose 5.27 points, or 1.42 percent, the day before. 
</P>
<P>
	In currency dealings, the dollar moved higher against the yen  
from its levels in New York, but its move upward was capped by 
concerns of possible heightened trade friction between Japan and 
the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky warned Japan  
Wednesday that its December steel exports to the U.S. must show 
``substantial'' reduction or the United States will take 
retaliatory action. Threats of such action often help to boost the 
yen. 
</P>
<P>
	Also weighing on the dollar was yen-buying by Japanese  
companies, which often repatriate yen from overseas ahead of the 
end of their fiscal year on March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar showed little reaction to the Bank of Japan's latest  
monthly report, in which the central bank moderately improved its 
assessment of the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the euro was traded at 130.82 yen, down from 131.26  
yen late Wednesday in Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	The yield on the 10-year Japanese government bond rose to 1.775  
percent from Wednesday's finish of 1.770 percent, driving its price 
down to 100.20 yen from 100.24 yen.

<HEADLINE> Pinochet Hearing Resumes in London </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Lawyers for Britain and Spain contend that  
international law leaves the House of Lords no choice but to uphold 
the arrest of former Chilean dictator Gen. Augusto Pinochet on 
charges of human rights violations. 
</P>
<P>
	The 83-year-old general was arrested Oct. 16 in London on a  
Spanish warrant alleging he ordered murders, kidnapping and torture 
-- including the death of Spaniards -- during his 1973-1990 rule. 
</P>
<P>
	An official government report says 3,197 people were killed or  
disappeared at the hands of his secret police after Pinochet 
overthrew elected Marxist Salvador Allende. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyers for Spain and Britain argued Tuesday, the second day  
of a hearing before Britain's highest court, that international 
conventions deny heads of state any special protection or immunity 
if the crimes alleged are significantly grievous. 
</P>
<P>
	``We submit that in some circumstances there is an actual duty  
not to accord immunity,'' lawyer Christopher Greenwood said. 
</P>
<P>
	He cited the Nuremberg trials of World War II Nazi leaders and  
the more recent international tribunals trying Bosnia Serbs. 
</P>
<P>
	The House of Lords is being asked to decide again whether the  
aging general's arrest can stand, therefore allowing the 
extradition request against him to proceed. Pinochet claims 
immunity from arrest in Britain as Chile's former head of state. 
</P>
<P>
	Alun Jones, one of the lawyers for Britain and Spain, has argued  
that international conventions recognize torture as a global crime 
that can be prosecuted by any nation. He said under that law, Spain 
has every right to seek Pinochet's arrest and Britain is compelled 
to extradite him. 
</P>
<P>
	Jones also noted that Chile signed the International Convention  
against Torture in 1988. 
</P>
<P>
	Lord Chief Justice Nicolas Browne-Wilkinson, who heads the  
seven-judge panel, said he found it ``very difficult'' to reconcile 
how Chile could ascribe to the convention, yet argue that Pinochet 
could not be arrested by a foreign government. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, another House of Lords panel ruled against Pinochet  
in a 3-2 decision. But that ruling was set aside last month by the 
House of Lords, which conceded that one of the judges voting 
against the general had close ties with Amnesty International, the 
human rights group campaigning to put him on trial. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet's lawyers will present their arguments later this week.  
</P>
<P>
	In the first hearing, they had claimed that most of the  
allegations against Pinochet occurred before the international 
convention on torture was ratified. 
</P>
<P>
	If Pinochet again loses in the House of Lords, a lengthy  
extradition battle would begin. But if the lords uphold the Nov. 25 
High Court decision quashing his arrest, he would be free to go 
home. 
</P>
<P>
	Pinochet, who was arrested while recuperating from back surgery,  
remains under police guard in a rented mansion west of London. He 
is not attending the proceedings.

<HEADLINE> GE Has Record Profit in 4th Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- Profit at General Electric Co. rose 13.7  
percent to set a record in the fourth quarter, meeting analysts' 
expectations, and the industrial and financial service giant passed 
another milestone as annual revenue topped $100 billion for the 
first time. 
</P>
<P>
	In its report Wednesday, GE said profit in the final three  
months of 1998 rose to $2.67 billion, or 80 cents a diluted share, 
from $2.35 billion, or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Per share 
profit rose faster than overall earnings as a result of a $17 
billion stock buyback program that was begun in 1994 and has 
reduced the number of shares outstanding. 
</P>
<P>
	John F. Welch, GE's chairman, attributed the growth to  
acquisitions, an efficiency and quality improvement drive known as 
Six Sigma that has bolstered profit margins, and the company's 
worldwide diversification. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenue for the quarter climbed 7.3 percent to $28.64 billion  
from $26.70 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The results met expectations of analysts surveyed by First Call,  
but GE stock closed down $1.06 1/4 to $100.37 1/2 a share on the New York 
Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	For all of last year, GE earned $9.30 billion, or $2.80 a  
diluted share, on revenue of $100.47 billion. That compared with 
1997 earnings of $8.20 billion, or $2.46 a share, on revenue of 
$90.84 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Among highlights:  
</P>
<P>
	--GE's financial arm accounted for just over 40 percent of the  
company's profits last year as its earnings rose 17 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	--GE's jet engine business won more than half of the large  
commercial engine orders for the year. 
</P>
<P>
	--GE continued its emphasis on global operations in 1998, despite  
Asian market concerns, making more than 70 acquisitions outside the 
United States and increasing revenue from foreign operations by 10 
percent. In all, GE made 108 acquisitions valued at more than $18 
billion in 1998.

<HEADLINE> Court Upholds ADM Funds Ruling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- An evenly divided Supreme Court today killed a  
complaint by two of the nation's largest pension funds against 
Archer Daniels Midland Co. for illegal acts that lowered the value 
of the stock they own in the agribusiness giant. 
</P>
<P>
	By a 4-4 vote, the justices upheld rulings that threw out the  
two pension funds' case. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Sandra Day O'Connor did not participate in the decision,  
setting up the even split among the court's other eight members. It 
was not disclosed which way those eight justices voted. 
</P>
<P>
	ADM pleaded guilty in 1996 to violating federal antitrust laws  
by seeking to fix prices and volume in the lucrative world market 
for lysine, a feed additive. The company paid a $100 million fine, 
and later settled three civil antitrust lawsuits that cost it an 
additional $90 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Various shareholder lawsuits also were filed against ADM. They  
were consolidated in a federal trial court in Illinois. Those cases 
yielded a 1997 settlement worth $8 million, with half earmarked for 
attorney fees. 
</P>
<P>
	The California Public Employees' Retirement System and the  
Florida State Board of Administration, two pension funds that are 
among the largest ADM shareholders, objected to the settlement. 
They complained that ``not one dime was returned to the corporation 
for shareholders who lost $190 million in value as a result of 
their fiduciaries' misconduct.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A federal judge nevertheless approved the settlement, and the  
7th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals threw out the two pension funds' 
ensuing appeal last January. 
</P>
<P>
	The appeals court, in a ruling at odds with those of other  
federal appeals courts, ruled that shareholders must formally 
intervene in a derivative lawsuit before they can appeal its 
settlement. 
</P>
<P>
	And even though the 1998 ruling overturned past 7th Circuit  
court rulings, it was applied retroactively to the two pension 
funds. 
</P>
<P>
	Today's 4-4 vote automatically upheld the appeals court ruling.  
</P>
<P>
	The case is California Public Employees' Retirement System vs.  
Felzen, 97-1732.

<HEADLINE> General Motors Reports Record Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. overcame last summer's  
strikes and weak results overseas and posted a record 
fourth-quarter profit today of $1.8 billion, up 8 percent over the 
same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's earnings exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations.  
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest automaker reported today that it earned  
$2.61 a fully diluted share, compared with the previous record of 
$1.7 billion, or $2.33 a share, in the last three months of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues totaled $46.4 billion, down 2 percent from $47.1  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors weclomed the news, pushing GM's stock up 3 percent, or  
$2.62 1/2, to $90.62 1/2 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overseas results are still kind of tough, but they're being  
overwhelmed by good results in North America,'' said analyst David 
Healy of Burnham Securities Inc. ``They blew out the estimates as 
far as North America is concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, GM earned $3 billion, or $4.18 a share, down 53  
percent from the $6.3 billion, or $8.62 a share, earned in 1997. 
The decline largely reflected the cost of the strikes. Revenues for 
the year totaled $161.3 billion, down 6 percent from $171.2 billion 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The year's performance will result in profit-sharing checks of  
about $200 for 231,000 union workers in the United States. That 
compares with 1997's profit-sharing total of $750. Salaried workers 
will get $200 each, or 1 percent of their base salary, whichever is 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	GM Chairman Jack Smith said he was encouraged by the  
fourth-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came back strong following the work stoppage in midyear and  
we intend to keep this momentum going in the future,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's earnings report included after-tax charges totaling $420  
million, or 64 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges included $80 million for the cost of severance  
packages and buyouts for employees let go as a result of the 
restructuring of GM's North American field sales and service staff 
and $192 million for underperforming assets, early retirement 
packages and the closing of unprofitable joint ventures at GM's 
Delphi Automotive Systems parts subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges also included $97 million primarily for the effect  
of the Asian recession on GM's investments in India and Thailand, 
and $51 million for underperforming assets and severance packages 
related to cost-reduction efforts in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding special items, GM's fourth-quarter profit totaled $2.2  
billion, or $3.25 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or $1.93 a 
share in October-December 1997. The average fourth-quarter earnings 
estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. was $2.61 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's North American operations were responsible for the bulk of  
GM's fourth-quarter gain. The unit earned a record $1.6 billion; 
the previous record was $841 million in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The performance was enough to boost GM's cash reserves to $14.1  
billion, over the $13 billion that GM considers necessary to 
support new-product development, its pension plans and stockholder 
initiatives. The cash total was up from $11.5 billion at the end of 
1998's third quarter, when the strikes took their toll. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith credited the restoration of the cash reserve to  
cost-cutting and GM's ability to quickly resume full production 
after the strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's North American plants produced more vehicles in last year's  
fourth quarter than in any fourth quarter in a decade as they 
rushed to restore strike-depleted inventories. Production totaled 
about 1.51 million cars and trucks; first quarter production is 
estimated at 1.47 million vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said GM plans to reinstate its share-repurchase program  
during the first quarter; it had been postponed during the strikes. 
He said GM also plans to redeem its Series B 9 1/8 preference stock 
``in the near future.'' There are about 20 million depository 
shares of that stock with a face value of more than $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, the earnings were not as impressive. GM-Europe earned  
$146 million, while the automaker's Latin America-Africa-Mideast 
operations lost $212 million and Asia-Pacific operations lost $213 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect strong market conditions to continue in the United  
States and Europe in 1999, and fully intend to maintain our 
momentum in the market and to further strengthen our financial 
position,'' Smith said. ``However, the economic problems and 
uncertainty in Asia and Latin America will be a continuing 
challenge in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM's big Delphi parts unit earned $280 million in the fourth  
quarter after adjustments for special items, down 20 percent from 
the $349 million it earned a year ago. Delphi Chairman J.T. 
Battenberg III blamed the economic downturn in Latin America. GM 
plans to spin off about 18 percent of Delphi in an initial public 
stock offering later this quarter, and distribute the rest to GM 
shareholders by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company restated its fourth-quarter 1997 results to reflect  
the $10.1 billion sales of its Hughes Electronics defense unit in 
December of that year. GM also had after-tax charges totaling $4 
billion in that quarter for underperforming assets, the planned 
closure of the Buick City assembly complex in Flint, the sale of 
parts plants and leasing losses. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Acceptance Corp., the automaker's finance  
subsidiary, reported a $298 million profit for the fourth quarter, 
up 7 percent from $279 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary earned $119 million, up  
70 percent from the $70 million it earned in the fourth quarter of 
1997. 
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Iranian Hard-liners Threaten Cleric </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TEHRAN, Iran (AP) -- Hard-liners have threatened suicide attacks  
against a Shiite Muslim cleric for supporting a religious leader 
who has questioned the clergy's right to rule Iran, a newspaper 
reported Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The hard-line Hezbollah of Isfahan group threatened to ``carry  
out its political, revolutionary and religious duty, even to the 
point of martyrdom'' against Ayatollah Jalaledin Taheri, according 
to comments published in the daily Asr-e-Azadegan newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	The group was apparently angered by a prayer service Taheri led  
in the city of Isfahan in favor of Grand Ayatollah Ali Montazeri, 
who was once expected to become Iran's supreme religious leader but 
was cast aside after he openly criticized the hard-line rule of the 
clerics. 
</P>
<P>
	The prayer service was attended by about 70,000 people. Critics  
of Taheri disrupted the service by heckling and throwing an iron 
bar and other objects at the senior cleric. 
</P>
<P>
	Afterward, several of Montazeri's supporters were arrested after  
they shouted slogans in his favor, The Tehran Times reported. The 
prayers were held to mark Eid al-Fitr, the Muslim feast at the end 
of the holy month of Ramadan. 
</P>
<P>
	Montazeri had been expected to succeed the late Ayatollah  
Ruhollah Khomeini as Iran's supreme leader. But just months before 
dying in June 1989, Khomeini dismissed him because of his comments 
against the clergy. 
</P>
<P>
	Montazeri still enjoys a large following among Iranians, despite  
efforts by hard-liners to sideline him. 
</P>
<P>
	The government of President Mohammed Khatami on Wednesday called  
for an investigation of the disruption of the prayer service. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Cabinet expressed regret over the kind of incidents which  
have taken place in Isfahan a number of times and stressed the need 
for investigations and the punishment of those responsible,'' 
state-run television reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Since he was dismissed by Khomeini, Montazeri has been under  
house arrest in the city of Qom, about 80 miles southwest of the 
capital Tehran. 
</P>
<P>
	In November 1997, Montazeri was publicly repudiated after he  
questioned the legitimacy of rule by the clergy, including Iran's 
powerful spiritual leader Ali Khamenei, who replaced Khomeini. 
</P>
<P>
	Khamenei accused him of treason and, days later, hard-liners  
attacked Montazeri's home and office in Qom, forcing him to flee 
under police protection.

<HEADLINE> Japan Worries Over Steel Complaints </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Japan's finance chief said Wednesday he is worried  
that the United States is growing increasingly antagonistic toward 
Japan because of the large volume of Japanese steel exports. 
</P>
<P>
	``Steel is something about which we need to be extremely  
careful,'' Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa told reporters, noting 
that President Clinton warned Japan to cut exports during his State 
of the Union address Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese steel imports to the United States surged 400 percent  
last year, and the U.S. steel industry and the steelworkers union 
have filed complaints accusing Tokyo of ``dumping'' steel in the 
U.S. market. The industry is seeking higher tariffs on Japanese 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene Barshefsky and  
Commerce Secretary William Daley said the United States would file 
a government trade complaint against Japan if its steel exports 
don't drop fast. 
</P>
<P>
	Trade Minister Kaoru Yosano brushed aside Washington's  
complaints then, saying that Japan cannot promise to reduce its 
steel exports. 
</P>
<P>
	But Miyazawa met Thursday with Sen. John D. Rockefeller IV,  
D-W.Va., and said the volume of Japanese steel exports to the 
United States was bigger than he expected. Miyazawa said he 
realized that a growing political constituency in the United States 
is specifically displeased about Japan's steel industry. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought the U.S. didn't have that many steel mills, but they  
actually have more than Japan,'' Miyazawa said.

<HEADLINE> Rodman Now Says He Will Play </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Dennis Rodman changed his mind Wednesday and  
decided not to retire after all. 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA's most outrageous player posted a message on his  
Internet site announcing his un-retirement, and his agent, Dwight 
Manley, confirmed that the seven-time rebounding champion wants to 
return to professional basketball. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been reviewing my options,'' Rodman wrote, ``and those  
options still include playing in the NBA this season with a 
contender. Chicago, New York and L.A. are all cities I'd like to 
play in. Playing overseas could be pretty cool, too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman had announced his retirement on Tuesday as rumors spread  
that he was about to be traded to the New York Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley, who had said he would no longer represent Rodman, said  
he spoke on the telephone with the player for 10-15 minutes 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's true,'' Manley said of Rodman's change of heart.  
``Technically, I'm still his agent. There's nothing else I'm 
willing to say at this point.''

<HEADLINE> Davenport Adds to Drug Controversy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Lindsay Davenport, ignoring a  
request that tennis players put a drug controversy behind them, 
admitted today that she is suspicious of the ``superhuman'' efforts 
of some players on the men's tour. 
</P>
<P>
	On a day when the head of the International Tennis Federation,  
Brian Tobin, urged players to leave the drug debate behind for the 
good of the sport, its top female player said she agreed with Jim 
Courier, who has been outspoken in his criticism of drug users. 
</P>
<P>
	Courier was criticized by players and officials alike for  
suggesting tennis has a problem with blood doping and the use of 
banned substances that cannot be detected in urine samples. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he might have a very good point,'' Davenport said.  
</P>
<P>
	She then made the sort of comments Tobin was trying to prevent,  
first admitting she did not know the difference between a number of 
different performance-enhancing substances, then offering opinions 
about them. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending Australian Open winner Petr Korda is the center of the  
drug controversy after testing positive for the steroid nandrolone 
at Wimbledon last year. Courier said he suspects some players use 
substances such as erythropoietin (EPO) -- the drug at the center of 
cycling's Tour de France doping scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know really know the difference between blood doping  
and steroids and then taking another drug to try and mask the 
steroids,'' she said. ``I'm still trying to learn about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport's lack of background did not stop her suggesting  
tennis was behind the ball on drug testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``In terms of testing for drugs a lot of other sports are a lot  
more sophisticated in scoping it out,'' Davenport said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Tennis, because we have never had to worry about it before, is  
probably a couple of steps behind in testing for every type of 
drugs and infraction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Like Courier, Davenport said she had no evidence that blood  
drugs, to boost endurance, were being used. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have never seen anybody shoot up or anything,'' Davenport  
said. ``I mean there are some people that are running like no 
problem at 8-all in the fifth and some men you watch play are not 
even winded after running for five hours. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't know, it's a guess. I mean, you can just see, some  
people are superhuman out there, it seems.''

<HEADLINE> Meat Recall Hurts Sara Lee's Image </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GRAND RAPIDS, Mich. (AP) -- With 11 deaths already linked to its  
Michigan meat plant, Sara Lee Corp. hopes newspaper ads will 
reassure customers that its products are safe. 
</P>
<P>
	The full-page ads appeared in nearly 80 newspapers Wednesday,  
including The New York Times and USA Today, according to Sara Lee 
spokesman Jeffrey Smith. 
</P>
<P>
	They feature a letter from Sara Lee's chairman and president  
reminding consumers to check their freezers for hot dogs and deli 
meats with certain batch numbers. 
</P>
<P>
	Sara Lee's Bil Mar Foods plant in Zeeland voluntarily recalled  
the products Dec. 22 after reports they might be contaminated with 
listeria, a type of bacteria. 
</P>
<P>
	The ads also assure customers that ``safety and wholesomeness''  
are its top priorities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think consumers have appreciated having an 800 number that  
they can call at any time. I'm hopeful ... consumers appreciate the 
clarity with which we've communicated the recall,'' Smith said. 
``We're looking to recover all products purchased.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Jack Kinard of Memphis, Tenn., lost his 64-year-old wife, Mary  
Jo, to listeriosis after she ate Sara Lee hot dogs and ham. 
</P>
<P>
	Kinard said he believes the ad shows the company is taking  
responsibility for what happened, but he's not sure if he'll ever 
trust its products again. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not angry, nothing will bring her back,'' he said. ``But  
it would be a long time before I would even consider buying from 
them again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ads pleased Nomi Ghez, an analyst with Goldman Sachs in New  
York, who said the company needs to act quickly to reassure its 
customers, even though meat processing is only a small part of its 
operations. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a short-term crisis ... and the recall has been fairly  
limited,'' she said. ``But because the updates of deaths keep 
coming, this creates a lot of negative publicity for the company.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In the past three weeks, the Centers for Disease Control and  
Prevention has linked 11 deaths and three miscarriages in 13 states 
to a distinctive strain of listeria found in hot dogs and deli 
meats produced at the Zeeland plant. More than 50 other cases of 
illness have been reported. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawsuit filed last month in Chicago seeks class-action status  
for anyone who ate the recalled products. 
</P>
<P>
	Bil Mar shut down the production lines which made the products.  
The company is conducting its own investigation into what happened, 
and estimates the recall will cost between $50 million and $70 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	The USDA also wants to find out where the contamination  
occurred, but it appears likely that it originated in the plant 
since all the products sold were already cooked. 
</P>
<P>
	``The cooking process should have killed any listeria,'' said  
Beth Gaston, a USDA spokeswoman. Bil Mar won't resume production 
and sale of the recalled products without federal approval. 
</P>
<P>
	What Sara Lee needs to concentrate on now is maintaining the  
public trust, said Gerry Meyers, a professor at the University of 
Michigan Business School. 
</P>
<P>
	``They need to talk to their customers, take their temperature  
and see how they're doing ... what the anger level is,'' said 
Meyers, who specializes in corporate crisis management. ``There's 
only one right way to fight something like this ... to come forward 
to be completely open about what you know and what you don't.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Retailers may also need extra assurance.  
</P>
<P>
	Ron Cox, spokesman for D&AMP;W Food Centers Inc., said the Grand  
Rapids-based grocery store chain first found out about the recall 
through media reports, not Bil Mar. 
</P>
<P>
	``There probably could have been some better communication, but  
since then it's been good,'' he said, adding the company will 
welcome the affected products back on the shelf when the government 
clears their sale. 
</P>
<P>
	But fighting public perception may be Sara Lee's greatest  
challenge. 
</P>
<P>
	Meyers said his wife wanted to throw out all the Sara Lee  
products in the freezer when she first heard about the recall. 
</P>
<P>
	``I told her to check the numbers to see if they matched the  
recall, and they didn't, so we put them back,'' he said. ``People 
are very sensitive about food safety.''

<HEADLINE> Kournikova Serve Is Still the Talk </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Anna Kournikova made nearly everyone  
do a double take. 
</P>
<P>
	She served 23 double faults and she still won her first-round  
match at the Australian Open. 
</P>
<P>
	``I turned the match on myself to see if it was still happening,  
if it was possible,'' No. 1 seed Lindsay Davenport said Wednesday. 
``It has to be mental. I mean, something is definitely wrong 
technically with the serve but to miss them as badly as she does, I 
don't know what is going on. She definitely needs to change it 
soon.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kournikova, the No. 12 seed, beat Jill Craybas of East  
Greenwich, R.I., 7-6 (7-1), 7-5 Tuesday, advancing to a 
second-round matchup against Miho Saeki of Japan. She made 62 
double faults in her last three matches and had 56 in her last 
three in 1998, all losses. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad for her,'' Davenport said. ``I mean, she is not  
like one of my greatest friends, but I think you feel badly for 
anybody who goes through that. It definitely has to be 
embarrassing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport said she would not offer Kournikova any advice, but  
Kournikova could expect to get it from defending singles champion 
Martina Hingis if the 17-year-old serves badly when the two start 
doubles play. 
</P>
<P>
	``Martina is not going to let her double fault that many  
times,'' Davenport said. ``Martina wants to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hingis and Kournikova, the No. 3 seed, opened doubles Wednesday  
by routing Eva Melicharova and Julie Pullin 6-3, 6-0.

<HEADLINE> Pa. Radio Station Lawsuit Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EASTON, Pa. (AP) -- The original hosts of an Italian radio show  
can use the program's name at least until June, as they battle with 
their former radio station to keep the show, an attorney said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	WEEX, where Tempo Italiano originated, agreed to continue to  
allow John and Pamela Richetta to use the name for the program, now 
broadcast on WEST, said Richetta's attorney Steve Goudsouzian. 
</P>
<P>
	The parties agreed to abide by a judge's earlier decision about  
the ownership of the name until the civil actions they filed 
against each other go to trial in June or otherwise get resolved, 
Goudsouzian said. 
</P>
<P>
	The Richettas hosted their six-hour Sunday morning show on WEEX  
for a year before signing a contract with rival station WEST 
beginning this year. 
</P>
<P>
	After the Richettas' defection, WEEX started a replacement show,  
Festa Musica D'Italia, which airs at the same time on Sunday 
mornings and is hosted by a childhood friend of the Richettas, 
former Mayor Sal Panto Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	The two stations then filed competing injunctions, each seeking  
to prevent the other station from using the name Tempo Italiano. 
WEEX claimed that it owned the name because it hired the Richettas; 
the Richettas said they owned it because they had registered the 
name under their promotion company, which did all the marketing for 
the show. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's exciting. .. And hopefully, in six months it will be as  
if this never happened,'' Pam Richetta said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	WEEX's parent company, Clear Channel, decided to abide by the  
preliminary decision by Northampton County Judge Alfred T. 
Williams, who approved a temporary injunction Jan. 8 giving 
Richetta Promotions the right to use the name. 
</P>
<P>
	WEEX general manager Jeff Frank did not return messages seeking  
comment Wednesday.

<HEADLINE> Clash Gets Diaz Arce in 3-Team Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Raul Diaz Arce, Major League Soccer's career  
scoring leader, was traded for the second time in less than a year 
Wednesday, part of three-team deal that sent the Salvadoran striker 
to the San Jose Clash. 
</P>
<P>
	The New England Revolution swapped Diaz Arce for Giovanni  
Savarese and a 2000 draft selection from the New York-New Jersey 
MetroStars. The MetroStars then packaged Diaz Arce and Chilean 
midfielder Marcelo Vega to the Clash for a player to be named, 
possibly by the league, and future considerations. 
</P>
<P>
	Unlike other pro leagues, the MLS signs all players, assigning  
the star acquisitions among the 12 clubs. 
</P>
<P>
	Wednesday's moves means the MetroStars essentially will move to  
the top of the list for the next star acquisition. 
</P>
<P>
	It also could bring U.S. scoring star Eric Wynalda to the  
MetroStars, according to league sources. Wynalda has been on loan 
to Leon of the Mexican first division and will remain there until 
May. 
</P>
<P>
	Wynalda has been disappointing the last three seasons with San  
Jose, and it is almost assured he will not return to the Clash. 
</P>
<P>
	If Wynalda joins the MetroStars, he will reunite with his former  
coach and four members of the 1994 U.S. World Cup squad: Tony 
Meola, Tab Ramos, Alexi Lalas and Mike Sorber. New York-New Jersey 
hired former U.S. coach Bora Milutinovic at the end of last season. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal comes as the MetroStars are trying to trim their roster  
to get under the league's approximately $1.7 million per team 
salary cap. 
</P>
<P>
	Savarese is the MetroStars' career scoring leader with 42 goals,  
but has never been a regular starter with any of the club's five 
coaches. 
</P>
<P>
	New England's reason for the deal reportedly stems from friction  
between Diaz Arce, who has 56 goals in his three seasons in MLS, 
and Italian player-coach Walter Zenga. 
</P>
<P>
	Diaz Arce, who was traded from D.C. United before the 1998  
season in a salary cap move, rejoins Salvadoran national teammate 
Ronald Cerritos at San Jose. The Clash are rebuilding after 
finishing three seasons at or near the bottom the standings. 
</P>
<P>
	In another deal Wednesday, D.C. United traded goalkeeper Scott  
Garlick to Tampa Bay for a first-round selection in this year's 
college draft.

<HEADLINE> India Arrests 4 in Embassy Bomb Plot </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW DELHI, India (AP) -- U.S. counter-terrorism experts have  
arrived in India to assess what police say was a plot by Saudi 
dissident Osama bin Laden to bomb the U.S. Embassy and two consular 
offices, an embassy spokeswoman said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have arrested four people, including a Bangladeshi man  
accused of working for Pakistan's intelligence agency, according to 
newspaper reports in New Delhi. 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Embassy in New Delhi and consulates in the southern  
city of Madras and the eastern city of Calcutta were targeted, 
according to the reports. The attacks were to have taken place 
before next Tuesday's national holiday marking the anniversary of 
India's constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Security at U.S. embassies and consulates around the world,  
including those in India, has been tightened following the August 
bombings of the U.S. embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, which killed 
a total of 224 people, including 12 Americans. Washington has 
accused bin Laden of being behind those attacks. 
</P>
<P>
	A U.S. Embassy spokeswoman, speaking on customary condition of  
anonymity, said today that U.S. counter-terrorism experts from 
several federal agencies arrived Tuesday to assess the reported 
plot. No other details were available. 
</P>
<P>
	Indian Police Minister Lal Krishna Advani has assured the U.S.  
Embassy of full government protection, the Press Trust of India 
reported. 
</P>
<P>
	In Islamabad, Zameer Akram, the senior Pakistani Foreign  
Ministry official for south Asia, told The Associated Press that 
``Indian authorities have not informed us about any arrests and we 
don't have any information about the case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ringleader of the plot was identified as Sayed Abu Nasir,  
27, of Bangladesh. Nasir, said to be working for Pakistani 
intelligence, was arrested last week and is now in a high-security 
prison in New Delhi, city police chief R.N. Singh was quoted as 
telling the Indian Express. 
</P>
<P>
	He said 4 1/2 pounds of powerful explosives were recovered from  
Nasir at the time of his arrest at New Delhi's railroad station. 
</P>
<P>
	Three Indian associates of Nasir were arrested in the eastern  
resort of Siliguri on Sunday following Nasir's interrogation. 
</P>
<P>
	Six others were still at large and believed to be in Madras,  
Singh said. 
</P>
<P>
	India routinely accuses neighboring Pakistan of fomenting  
violence here through its spy agency. Pakistani denies the charges. 
</P>
<P>
	Pakistan backs Afghanistan's ruling Taliban army, which has  
given bin Laden refuge. Bin Laden, a wealthy Saudi dissident, is 
believed to have trained and funded an international, anti-American 
terrorist network.

<HEADLINE> Texas Instruments Reports Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Texas Instruments Inc. earned $189 million in the  
final three months of 1998, bouncing back from a loss in the same 
period a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The earnings were equivalent to 48 cents per diluted share,  
compared with the year-earlier loss of $285 million, or 73 cents 
per diluted share. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1998 results included a charge of $72 million, mainly due to  
the closing of an venture with Samsung Electronica in Portugal and 
the sale of a plant in Aversa, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year's results included special charges of $461 million for  
research and development and $42 million for cost reductions. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors reacted positively to the results, pushing Texas  
Instruments' stock up 7 percent, or $6.62 1/2, to close at $99.62 1/2 on 
the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues were $1.99 billion, down from $2.43 billion in the same  
fourth quarter the year before. 
</P>
<P>
	The company reported that the decrease in revenue was due to  
TI's exit from the memory chip business and new concentration on 
digital signal processing and analog technology. 
</P>
<P>
	``TI is a much different company today than we were a year  
ago,'' said Tom Engibous, TI chairman and chief executive. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, Texas Instruments earned $407 million, or $1.02  
per share, down from $1.83 billion, or $4.54 per share, in the year 
previous. Revenues were $8.46 billion, down from $9.75 billion.

	``Walking Distance'' (Arista Austin) -- Robert Earl Keen  

</P>
<P>
	As the title suggests, moving is a big part of Robert Earl  
Keen's fine new album. But while his characters seem forever to be 
headed down a trail, running toward home or away from it, what 
makes them more interesting is the movement inside of them -- they 
are moving toward some kind of peace, acceptance or 
self-realization. At their core, Keen's stories of drifters and 
drinkers in search of redemption (and barbecue) contain a kind of 
weather-beaten sentimentality. Keen leads a fine country-rock band 
and while he's no golden throat, he is one of the most consistently 
excellent performers on the alt-country landscape.

	``In Progress &AMP; In Motion 1965-1998'' (Columbia/Legacy) -- Taj  
Mahal 

</P>
<P>
	Here's a three-disc romp through the career of an American  
original. From his early work with fellow traveler Ry Cooder, 
through a tuba-intensive big band, explorations of Caribbean music, 
and always the blues, Taj Mahal has always been on a quest for the 
essence of music and rhythm. Listeners will find just that on these 
54 tracks. This is an essential work for anyone with a taste for 
American roots music.

	``Live on Two Legs'' (Epic) -- Pearl Jam  

</P>
<P>
	R.E.M. and Smashing Pumpkins abandoned rock on their latest  
releases because of drummer problems. Not Pearl Jam. 
</P>
<P>
	The Seattle band went out and hired Soundgarden's Matt Cameron  
as their fourth stickman. As a result, Pearl Jam's first recorded 
concert -- ``Live on Two Legs'' -- rocks like few releases in the 
last year, catching the urgency of one of last year's two best rock 
tours. (Jane's Addiction was the other.) 
</P>
<P>
	Maybe, it's because the tour came off one of the band's  
strongest works to date, ``Yield.'' And, as singer Eddie Vedder 
says, ``We are making up for lost time here'' after the band's 
bitter struggle with Ticketmaster. 
</P>
<P>
	The 17 songs here span much of Pearl Jam's catalog, but except  
for ``Evenflow,'' the band spurns the radio standards such as 
``Jeremy'' and ``Alive.'' They're not missed at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Standouts include ``Daughter'' with its interlude from Neil  
Young's ``Rockin' in the Free World,'' ``Nothingman'' and ``Red 
Mosquito.''

	``King Biscuit -- The Best of 25 Years of Rock'' (King Biscuit)  

</P>
<P>
	Some of the most explosive live rock ever recorded must be  
locked in a vault somewhere with the name of the syndicated radio 
program ``King Biscuit Flower Hour'' on it -- because it's not on 
this compilation. 
</P>
<P>
	The songs read like some cheap ``Best of the '70s'' collection.  
Only Queen's ``We Will Rock You'' and The Who's ``Won't Get Fooled 
Again'' are worthy contributors. Billy Squier's ``The Stroke'' 
shows why he quickly faded. It's horrible.

	``Flowers in the Desert'' (MRX/Eversound) -- Manuel Iman  

</P>
<P>
	Manuel Iman bills himself foremost as a flamenco guitarist, but  
he could easily bill himself as a jazz or rock instrumentalist. 
</P>
<P>
	Iman's ``Flowers in the Desert'' flows with a cocktail of genres  
at times mesmerizing but mostly cloying. 
</P>
<P>
	The New Age tinge of ``Gypsy Tears'' puts Iman in the league of  
Enya, while ``Journey Itself'' is phrased a la Stanley Jordan. 
</P>
<P>
	But many songs -- ``Care'' and ``This Moment Called Now'' -- are  
simply too syrupy even for a Disney soundtrack. And Iman's love of 
the electronic gadgets weighs down his more up-tempo tunes.

	White House Attacks Perjury Charge  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House special counsel Gregory Craig  
opened a second day of defense arguments in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial by urging senators to read the grand jury 
testimony and ``see the president is truthful.'' He dismissed the 
charge that Clinton lied before a grand jury as nothing more than 
``arguments over semantics.'' He said House prosecutors had wrongly 
tried to criminalize ``utterly meaningless'' conflicts in 
testimony. For example, Craig said the prosecutors were wrong to 
argue that Clinton had perjured himself when he said that he 
engaged in intimate contact and sexual banter with Monica Lewinsky 
in 1996 and 1997. She testified the activity began in late 1995. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Takes Message on the Road  
</P>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- Leaving behind Washington's chilly  
political clime, President Clinton road-tested his State of the 
Union proposals for education, Social Security and other 
initiatives before 20,000 people who received him buoyantly at the 
Marine Midland Arena. He said he is ready for a major clash with 
Congress over whether the federal budget surplus should go to 
Social Security or a tax cut. Clinton said he believes Congress 
ultimately will see his side after healthy debate and negotiation 
between not only lawmakers and the White House but the American 
people as well.

	Court Hears Race-Districting Case  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Supreme Court, intent on minimizing the  
use of race in drawing election districts, heard arguments today in 
a North Carolina case that could influence political redistricting 
nationwide after the 2000 census. A redistricting plan based on 
partisan politics cannot be ruled unlawful just because ``it 
happens to correlate with race,'' lawyer Walter Dellinger argued in 
defending the makeup of North Carolina's 12th congressional 
district. But Robinson Everett, representing voters, said state 
legislators had ``used code'' in considering how to draw it in 
1997.

	Kosovo Fighting Defies NATO Warning  
</P>
<P>
	SIPOLJE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb forces battled ethnic Albanian  
rebels in northwestern Kosovo today as both sides ignored NATO 
warnings to halt the fighting. In Brussels, Belgium, two top NATO 
officials admitted they made little progress during talks yesterday 
with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. NATO's policy-making 
body ordered the USS Enterprise into the Adriatic Sea and moved an 
eight-vessel Mediterranean naval force to Brindisi, Italy. It also 
reduced the notice to pilots and others for carrying out airstrikes 
from four to two days.

	Guatemala Rape Trial Opens  
</P>
<P>
	ESCUINTLA, Guatemala (AP) -- Four U.S. women who were raped while  
on a college trip were in Guatemala today to testify against three 
men charged in the 1998 attack. The women were among 13 students 
and three faculty members from St. Mary's College in Maryland, who 
were traveling as part of a study tour last January. The alleged 
gunmen forced their bus to stop, robbed the passengers and raped 
the women in a sugar cane field.

	China Rules on Internet Dissent  
</P>
<P>
	SHANGHAI, China (AP) -- China extended its crackdown on dissent  
into cyberspace for the first time, sentencing a software 
entrepreneur to two years in prison for giving e-mail addresses to 
dissidents abroad. Lin Hai was convicted of subversion. China 
polices Internet use closely. Service providers are required to 
register users, while barriers have been installed to block sites 
deemed subversive or pornographic.

	High Stock Prices Worry Greenspan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
expressed worries today that the high-flying stock market could be 
headed for a tumble. His concern about the altitude of the stock 
market gave support to views that the central bank is unlikely to 
rush to cut interest rates unless global turmoil sends markets into 
a severe downturn. Separately, a survey prepared for the Fed's next 
interest-rate meeting in two weeks found ``most regions are showing 
solid economic growth overall'' through early January.

	Stocks Push Ahead; Dow Up 3.35

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks climbed back this afternoon, as General  
Motors reported record earnings and investors shrugged off Federal 
Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan's congressional testimony. Just 
before the close, the Dow industrials were up 3.35 at 9,358.57. On 
the NYSE, decliners led advancers 1,545-1,447. The Nasdaq was up 
13.57 at 2,421.74.

	NBA Lockout Is Officially Settled

	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA lockout was officially settled this  
afternoon, and teams were told they can begin signing players, 
making trades and opening training camps at 2 p.m. EST Thursday. 
``We have an agreement, and we expect to have the deal signed 
tonight,'' league spokesman Chris Brienza said.

<HEADLINE> Grand Jury To Hear Olympic Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Independent investigations of the  
widespread Olympic bribery scandal are taking a toll. 
</P>
<P>
	An IOC member -- one of 13 implicated by IOC investigators --  
resigned Tuesday. Pirjo Haeggman of Finland denied any wrongdoing, 
but said she could no longer function as an IOC member. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman's ex-husband, Bjarne, reportedly worked briefly for the  
Salt Lake City bid committee and for 20 months in an Ontario 
government job initiated by the Toronto committee bidding for the 
1996 Summer Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Bjarne Haeggman's job with Ontario's Natural Resources Ministry  
was arranged with the help of the Toronto committee that bid for 
the 1996 Summer Games. The committee also paid the Haeggmans' 
$650-a-month rent in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario. 
</P>
<P>
	Paul Henderson, who was head of the Toronto bid committee, said  
the rent money was supposed to be repaid by the Haeggmans, but he 
was unsure whether it was. He denied it was an attempt to win Pirjo 
Haeggman's vote. 
</P>
<P>
	Haeggman said in Helsinki that she had been ``rash and perhaps  
naive in my trust in other people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wall Street Journal said today that a draft report on the  
scandal, written by IOC Vice President Richard Pound, implicates as 
many as 16 IOC members. 
</P>
<P>
	The report said the members might face expulsion for accepting  
more than $780,000 in payments and gifts from Salt Lake City 
Olympic officials during and after the successful effort to play 
host to the 2002 Winter Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound and IOC director general Francois Carrard were meeting  
with IOC lawyers in New York today to finalize the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Pound also was quoted in today's Kitchener-Waterloo (Ontario)  
Record as saying he himself once turned down a $1 million bribe 
offer in connection with a television deal. He cited the declined 
offer as evidence of the high standards of some IOC officials. 
</P>
<P>
	Pirjo Haeggman was among nine IOC members accused of serious  
violations who faced possible expulsion, an official close to the 
investigation told The Associated Press. Four other members have 
been cited for minor violations and face warnings or no sanctions. 
</P>
<P>
	While Haeggman was the first IOC member to resign since the  
scandal broke, three other Olympic officials also have quit. They 
are Salt Lake Organizing Committee President Frank Joklik and 
Senior Vice President Dave Johnson, and Alfredo La Mont, the U.S. 
Olympic Committee's senior director of international relations. 
</P>
<P>
	Tom Welch, who headed the Salt Lake bid committee, resigned in  
1997 after being accused of spousal abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	Welch's former secretary, Stephanie Pate, was to talk to federal  
investigators in Salt Lake City today. 
</P>
<P>
	Her attorney, David Watkiss, said she was subpoenaed to appear  
before a federal grand jury, but asked instead to meet with 
investigators privately. 
</P>
<P>
	Pate was not a ``player,'' in the actions that have given rise  
to allegations of bribery, Watkiss said. ``We just did what we were 
instructed to do,'' Watkiss said, using the plural form lawyers 
sometimes use for their clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Watkiss said he assumes investigators want to ask Pate about the  
reports of lavish gifts, cash, scholarships and free medical care 
given to IOC members by Salt Lake bid boosters. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to meet with the government and then the  
government can decide whether it wishes to present Ms. Pate before 
a grand jury,'' Watkiss said Tuesday. ``The grand jury appearance 
can be much shorter once the government understands what she knows 
and what she doesn't know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawyer said he advised Pate against talking to other  
investigators looking into the Olympic mess until after she talks 
with the Department of Justice. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our bottom line is we're trying to cooperate with the  
Department of Justice investigation to the best of our ability,'' 
Watkiss said. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's attorney, Max Wheeler, said today that his client had  
not yet been subpoenaed and that they were waiting for the results 
of SLOC's ethics investigation before deciding on their next course 
of action. Wheeler has maintained that his client did nothing 
wrong. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think he's been segregated out of all this as the  
instigator, and that's not the case,'' Wheeler said. ``We're trying 
to fend off the blows that are coming his way.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other lawyers representing key players in Salt Lake's bid have  
either not returned calls or made no comment when contacted by The 
Associated Press on Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	A Justice Department official confirmed that more than one  
subpoena for grand jury testimony has been issued. The Salt Lake 
Tribune, without citing a source, said as many as a dozen people 
have been subpoenaed. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition to the investigations by the federal government and  
the IOC, a probe is being made by SLOC's ethics committee, which is 
due Feb. 11 but could be finished sooner. USOC's investigation 
should be finished in February. 
</P>
<P>
	FBI spokesman George Dougherty said Tuesday the federal  
investigation likely will take months. 
</P>
<P>
	``These types of investigations take a long time ... but we  
understand the urgency here to get this matter resolved quickly and 
so we're going to expedite our investigation,'' Dougherty said. 
``Obviously, we don't want it to drag out for a year or so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He declined to give specifics about the status of the  
investigation or whether the grand jury would hear evidence on 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	--A member of an Olympic promotional group said at least two IOC  
members accepted offers of prostitutes from the Amsterdam committee 
that bid for the 1992 Summer Games. Prostitution is licensed in 
parts of Amsterdam. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was there and saw it, IOC members being offered women and  
two accepting,'' said Prince Frederic von Saxe-Lauenberg, a member 
of the Pierre de Coubertin International Committee. He said the two 
were African members, but declined to name them. 
</P>
<P>
	Von Saxe-Lauenberg said IOC members also were given video  
cassette recorders and their wives were offered diamond broaches by 
the Amsterdam committee. Roel Walraven, a member of Amsterdam's bid 
committee, admitted that IOC members had been given VCRs, but said 
he knew nothing ``about visits to brothels or diamonds in hotel 
rooms.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--Melbourne's bid committee for the 1996 Olympics arranged for an  
IOC delegate's daughter to play with the Melbourne Symphony 
Orchestra, a bid member said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Shane Maloney, who was the committee's cultural events  
organizer, also said he collected a $9,600 Aboriginal painting for 
a European museum after a suggestion from IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch. 
</P>
<P>
	Maloney told Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio that the  
musician was the daughter of a South Korean delegate the committee 
wanted to impress. 
</P>
<P>
	Melbourne lost the games to Atlanta.

<HEADLINE> China Legal System Seen Progressing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Hard-core Communists used to settle ideological  
arguments in China with shrill posters on city walls and Mao-suited 
thugs. Now they go to court. 
</P>
<P>
	A widely publicized lawsuit by an influential communist  
ideologue is revealing the progress China has made in molding a 
modern legal system -- and how the concept of legal rights has been 
accepted even by staunch Communists. 
</P>
<P>
	Although Duan Ruofei's lawsuit preceded the Communist Party's  
latest crackdown on dissent, its outcome is being closely watched 
as a political omen. A harsh judgment would add evidence that the 
party is further retreating from the more tolerant promise of last 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is the first time that an ideological crossing of swords  
has gone to court,'' said Ma Licheng, one of two authors of a 
popular liberal book on reform that is at the heart of the lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1996, Duan wrote one of four anonymous tracts, known as  
``10,000 character essays,'' that criticized capitalist influences 
in China. Duan urged the Communist Party to keep away from private 
ownership. Otherwise, he warned, socialism would collapse and China 
would become ``a vassal of international capitalism.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The essay was the talk of Beijing's politically connected,  
passed around by hand and fax before a pivotal Communist Party 
meeting that decided on new reform policies. 
</P>
<P>
	Then in April, Duan picked up a copy of the much talked-about  
reformist tome ``Crossing Swords.'' On the jacket, the book offered 
readers the scoop on the ``10,000 character essays.'' Inside, Duan 
found his article reprinted in part and attacked as a senseless 
scare tactic. 
</P>
<P>
	``This was a violation of my copyright,'' said Duan,  
editor-in-chief of the Marxist journal Contemporary Trends in 
Thought. ``Marxism advocates public ownership of the means of 
production. That doesn't mean everything belongs to everyone.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit's defendants maintain that Duan was passing out  
copies of his essay and its contents were published by media in 
Hong Kong and Taiwan. 
</P>
<P>
	``They did this out of revenge for our vicious attack on their  
hard-line,'' said Ma, the ``Crossing Swords'' co-author and 
commentator at People's Daily, the Communist Party's flagship 
newspaper. 
</P>
<P>
	Duan has demanded an apology, a stop to further printing of  
``Crossing Swords'' and $24,000 in compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	The one-day hearing at the Beijing No. 2 Intermediate People's  
Court drew 60 spectators, an unusually large audience for China's 
recently opened courts. Judges, at first reluctant to admit the 
throng, had extra seats brought in. 
</P>
<P>
	Duan didn't show up because he said his social status is much  
higher than the defendants. ``He was afraid,'' Ma said. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for both sides veered from their legal arguments and  
ventured into ideology, drawing swift rebukes from the court, the 
People's Daily said. 
</P>
<P>
	'' `The court doesn't judge ideologies. Stick to the facts,' ''  
Ma recalled the judge as saying. ``He was quite progressive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chinese courts haven't always been like this. Mao Tse-tung's  
radical Cultural Revolution 20 years ago largely did away with 
courts. In their place were revolutionary tribunals that combined 
law with political struggle. Youthful Red Guards often brought 
political miscreants, heads bowed and arms outstretched, before 
outraged crowds. 
</P>
<P>
	Judges have yet to rule on Duan's case. However, already at  
least one of his demands has been met. Party leaders have 
prohibited further printings of ``Crossing Swords'' and threatened 
to close down its publishing house.

	LIMA, Peru (AP) -- Five Maoist rebels and one civilian were  
killed in two separate clashes with army patrols in Peru's Amazon 
jungle, the armed forces said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Four Shining Path rebels were killed and two were captured on  
Monday when an army patrol fought a rebel column in the jungle 
community of Pucayacu-Tamshi, 200 miles northeast of the capital, 
Lima, an armed forces news release said. 
</P>
<P>
	In the second clash, one Shining Path rebel and one civilian  
were killed, and six rebels were captured on Tuesday in the 
district of Nuevo Porvenir, 285 miles northeast of Lima. 
</P>
<P>
	The military did not list any army casualties in either clash.  
</P>
<P>
	Peru's war against leftist guerrillas has left 30,000 dead since  
1980, but its intensity has fallen sharply since the capture of top 
rebel leaders in the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	Intelligence sources say rebel columns still operate in remote  
parts of Peru's central and northern jungle, sporadically battling 
soldiers.

	SAO PAULO, Brazil (AP) -- Brazilian police have escorted three  
Swiss citizens home to face kidnapping charges, authorities said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The two men and a woman flew to Geneva on Tuesday, said a  
statement by Brazil's Justice Ministry. 
</P>
<P>
	Pascal Rene Schumacher, Christian Pidoux, and Katia Claude  
Pastori are accused of kidnapping lawyer Stephane Lagonico in 
Switzerland on Dec. 24, said the statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Further details on the case were not immediately available.

three, who were found in Sao Paulo, the statement said. They agreed

	CARACAS, Venezuela (AP) -- Venezuela's Supreme Court has cleared  
the way for a controversial referendum on adopting a new 
constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	A three-member panel of the court ruled unanimously late Tuesday  
that President-elect Hugo Chavez may call a public vote on 
convening a constituent assembly to rewrite the constitution. 
</P>
<P>
	Venezuela's traditional political parties had argued that a  
referendum could take place only after amending the current 
constitution -- a process that could take years. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez, who led a failed coup attempt in 1992, made the issue  
the centerpiece of his recent election campaign, saying Venezuela's 
1961 constitution no longer addresses society's needs. 
</P>
<P>
	Chavez won a landslide victory Dec. 6, capitalizing on  
discontent among millions of poor Venezuelans. He takes office Feb.

	SAN CRISTOBAL DE LAS CASAS, Mexico (AP) -- Zapatista rebels on  
Wednesday accused the Mexican government of trying to cover up 
problems in Chiapas state and the rest of Mexico ahead of this 
week's visit by Pope John Paul II. 
</P>
<P>
	Subcommandante Marcos, the Zapatista leader, said in a statement  
that President Ernesto Zedillo and Interior Minister Francisco 
Labastida ``are rushing to apply cosmetics and makeup to hide from 
his holiness the face of the war in Chiapas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Zapatistas staged a brief uprising in the southern state of  
Chiapas in January 1994 in the name of greater democracy and Indian 
rights. Peace talks have been stagnant. 
</P>
<P>
	The government ``is crossing its fingers and praying that his  
holiness John Paul II doesn't make political declarations'' about 
Chiapas, Marcos said.

	Angel Figueroa Lozano, leader of the Institutional Revolutionary

<HEADLINE> GOP Governors Rap Clinton Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State of the Union address delivered by  
the president was ``quintessentially Bill Clinton,'' a polished 
speech that promised lots but set unrealistic expectations, a group 
of Republican governors said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The speech was a ``candy store'' for lawmakers that offered  
``caramels for conservatives,'' in the form of education reform, 
and ``lemon drops for liberals,'' with a pledge to increase the 
minimum wage, said Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, chairman of the 
Republican Governors Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was something for everyone. The only person who was  
missing was Michael Jordan,'' Keating said during a conference call 
with two other governors. 
</P>
<P>
	Noticeably missing from the president's address was a tax cut,  
said Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not give the money back to the people that earned it? Put  
the money back in their pocket,'' he said. ``The greatest economic 
recoveries we've seen in America are when you give it back to the 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Ed Schafer of North Dakota called the president a ``great  
deliverer -- he said something for everyone'' in his address. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's speech also signaled an attempt to return the  
country to ``the era of big government,'' Schafer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``More programs, more bureaucracy, more expenditures -- binding  
our future generations to government costs and that is the 
most-focused thing that we saw come from the president's speech,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors also felt that Clinton should have acknowledged  
the role that Republicans played in balancing the budget and 
reforming welfare laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the president could have been much more olive branch  
with the Republicans,'' Keating said.

<HEADLINE> Ex-Astros Executive Sues Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HOUSTON (AP) -- A former Houston Astros executive is suing the  
team, alleging it refused to promote her and fired her because she 
is a woman. 
</P>
<P>
	Leslie Ann Leary's lawsuit, seeking $300,000, was filed Tuesday  
in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	It alleges the Astros fired her in late 1997 from her position  
as assistant to the club's director of player development, telling 
her the position was being ``eliminated for financial reasons.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Astros then hired a less-experienced and less-qualified man,  
who was given the job title of minor league administrator with the 
same duties she had performed, the lawsuit says, adding Leary was 
not considered for the new position. 
</P>
<P>
	The lawsuit accuses team management of engaging in a pattern of  
discrimination against women and relegating women to jobs ``with 
less visibility, prestige, responsibility and prospects'' than 
those held by men. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is reflective of a pervasive problem in sports,'' said  
her lawyer, Patricia Flannery of Boston. ``Women are not 
penetrating upper-management levels of professional sports, and 
Leslie Leary is just the tip of the iceberg.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The team declined comment, spokesman Rob Matwick said.  
</P>
<P>
	An Astros spokesman did not return a message seeking comment.  
</P>
<P>
	Leary claims Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker once told  
her: ``It is my personal philosophy that someone in your position 
should aspire to the next level (director of player development). 
In order to do so, I believe that you have to have played 
baseball.''

<HEADLINE> Venus Williams Sparkles in the Night </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Two days after declaring it was not  
her fate to fall in the first round of the Australian Open, and 
divining a way out of a third-set predicament, Venus Williams 
decided all is right again in her world. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' confidence always borders on cockiness, a trait that  
doesn't quite endear her to fellow players. But when she's on, 
she's got the game to back it up. 
</P>
<P>
	And Williams was, indeed, on Wednesday night. Performing, not  
just playing. Glowing under the lights in her banana-yellow halter 
top and crayon-colored beads. Reaching out with those long, rubbery 
arms and cracking winners from every conceivable position. Drumming 
baseline shots and fairly pirouetting to the net for overhead 
smashes. Ripping serves at up to 117 mph, a tournament high for 
women. 
</P>
<P>
	The fifth-seeded Williams spotted Sweden's Asa Carlsson the  
first two games, then reeled off the next 11 en route to a 6-2, 6-1 
romp and a berth in the third round. 
</P>
<P>
	``I guess I displayed the more modern Venus,'' Williams said.  
``The first round was the Venus from the '80s that disappeared a 
long time ago, because I really quit playing those type of matches, 
unless I was playing someone like the No. 1 player. I really don't 
want to go through that anymore. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very happy tonight because I was able to have more  
control of my game. Everything that I had been practicing was 
really coming together.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked what she did to turn herself around after the close call  
in the first round against Croatia's Silvija Talaja, who finally 
yielded at 9-7 in the third set, Williams said she looked to her 
younger sister Serena for inspiration. 
</P>
<P>
	``I watched Serena's example, how to put an opponent away, and  
wondered why I wasn't doing those things,'' Williams said. ``She 
played a girl who was really hitting the ball well. She hit it flat 
and deep, and Serena took care of it. She said, 'Venus, what's the 
problem?' I'm supposed to set a better example for her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	If the ``modern Venus'' sticks around and doesn't revert to the  
'80s version, she could be on her way to a quarterfinal duel 
against top seed Lindsay Davenport, who has won six of their seven 
matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the past I have had some trauma against her,'' Williams  
said. ``Every time she played me, she has definitely had to play 
her best. No matter who I'm playing, they know they're going to 
have to play their best to beat me. Whether I'm playing good, 
whether I'm playing bad. And she has done that and gone ahead and 
defeated me. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the future, the very near future, I want to change that.  
She has made it known that she wants to be a competitor, a grand 
slam winner, a No. 1. I have made it known that I can be No. 6, so 
I have to do better.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The U.S. Open men's finalists, Australians Patrick Rafter and  
Mark Philippoussis, moved within a victory apiece of a fourth-round 
confrontation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rafter had little trouble dispatching compatriot Mark Woodforde  
6-2, 6-4, 6-4. Philippoussis, though, had all he could handle 
against Michael Chang before eking out a 7-6 (1), 2-6, 6-3, 5-7, 
7-5 victory. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippoussis survived not only on the strength of his serve --  
he had 24 aces and only two double faults to Chang's 13 and 5 -- but 
in the way he went for winners more often from the baseline and the 
net. That showed up in the statistics, with Philippoussis 
accounting for 95 winners to Chang's 43, and a correspondingly 
higher number of unforced errors, 78-31. Philippoussis, 
essentially, was willing to take more chances, and in the end that 
paid off. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was hard sometimes to be aggressive on his serves because  
he would get the first serve in right away, and I started playing 
defensive,'' Chang said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I went for the big shots a lot and I feel like I'm hitting the  
ball well,'' Philippoussis said. ``I felt really good in the fifth 
set, just like it was the second set.''

<HEADLINE> Most Asian Markets Close Higher </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONG KONG (AP) -- Most Asian stock markets -- including the big  
Tokyo exchange -- closed higher in quiet trading Wednesday as 
investors shrugged off fears about Brazil's financial turmoil. 
</P>
<P>
	As Brazil's crisis deepens, some foreign fund managers may be  
shifting their money from the troubled Latin American markets and 
into Asia, said Fitzgerald Aklan, assistant vice president for 
Orion-Squire Securities Inc., in Manila, the Philippines. 
</P>
<P>
	``Investors are putting Brazil's problems at the back of their  
minds and concentrating on Asia,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	In Tokyo, stocks rallied on a report that some legislators in  
the ruling Liberal Democratic Party were calling for injection of 
public funds into real estate to stimulate the economy. 
</P>
<P>
	The benchmark 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average rose 257.61 points,  
or 1.87 percent, to close at 14,028.05. On Tuesday, the Nikkei had 
fallen 34.62 points, or 0.25 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	``Expectations rose for a radical handling of the bad debt  
problem in the real estate market,'' said Kenji Karikomi, deputy 
general manager at Daiwa Securities. 
</P>
<P>
	On the currency market, the U.S. dollar fell against the yen. In  
late trading, the dollar bought 113.40 yen, down 0.64 yen from late 
Tuesday in Tokyo and also below its late New York level of 113.49 
yen overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	In Bangkok, prices surged in brisk trading as investors welcomed  
news that Thailand's central bank had estimated lending by 
commercial banks would grow 7 percent this year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Stock Exchange of Thailand index rose 8.40 points, or 2.2  
percent, to 394.85. 
</P>
<P>
	At the Thai central bank, Deputy Governor Kitti Patpongpibul  
said the 7 percent increase in lending would be enough to ensure 
that the local economy would return to growth after two straight 
years of decline. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, in Hong Kong and Taiwan, worries over Brazil were  
more pronounced, as investors fear problems in Latin American would 
lead to a credit crunch in China. Some companies there with strong 
ties to the government, dubbed ``red chips,'' are on the brink of 
bankruptcy as bad debts mount. 
</P>
<P>
	Hong Kong's blue-chip Hang Seng Index rose 24.80 points, or 0.24  
percent, at 10,314.91, but a more specialized index tracking the 
red chips plunged 5.17 percent. Losses from bad bank loans in China 
fueled the fears. 
</P>
<P>
	In Taiwan, worries over China combined with those over corporate  
earnings at home to drag the Weighted Price Index 32.65 points, or 
0.5 percent, lower to 6,310.71. 
</P>
<P>
	Markets were closed in Malaysia and Indonesia to mark the end of  
Ramadan, the Islamic holy month, which muted trading in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere:  
</P>
<P>
	MANILA: Philippine stocks rallied on strong foreign demand for  
bargain stocks. The 30-company PSE index closed up 42.55 points, or 
2 percent, at 2,146.39. 
</P>
<P>
	SEOUL: Share prices fell, after traders discounted news that  
international ratings agency Fitch IBCA Ltd. had upgraded South 
Korea. The key Kospi index lost 4.69 points, or 0.76 percent, to 
613.43. 
</P>
<P>
	SINGAPORE: The key stock index rose slightly as investors bought  
blue chips but sold shares in smaller companies. The Straits Times 
Index closed 1.17 points, or 0.08 percent, higher at 1,548.27. 
</P>
<P>
	SYDNEY: Australian share prices ended narrowly higher in quiet  
trading. The All Ordinaries index closed at 2,872.7, up 16.9 points 
or 0.59 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	WELLINGTON: New Zealand shares rose for the third straight day,  
fueled by continued investor support for market heavyweight Telecom 
Corp. of New Zealand Ltd. The benchmark NZSE-40 capital index rose 
24.92 points, 1.1 percent, to 2,219.62.

<HEADLINE> Am. Airlines Has Weak 4th Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, said weak  
international demand pushed its fourth-quarter earnings below Wall 
Street's expectations, but results for the year were strong. 
America West, a Phoenix-based carrier, posted a slight gain for the 
quarter and a major rise for the full year. 

</P>
<P>
 *AMR Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp. said Wednesday its fourth-quarter profits slipped 12.5  
percent compared to the same period last year because of decreasing 
demands in the international market. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest airline earned $167 million, or $1  
per diluted share, after a $15 million one-time charge related to 
food costs on flights. In last year's fourth-quarter, the airline 
earned $195 million, or $1.09 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected earnings of about $1.16 a diluted share.  
</P>
<P>
	AMR's fourth-quarter revenues rose 1.3 percent to $4.6 billion,  
compared to $4.5 billion in last year's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, AMR's earnings rose 33.4 percent. Including  
the charge, AMR reported earnings of $1.3 billion, or $7.52 a 
diluted share, compared to $985 million, or $5.39 per diluted 
share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Donald Carty, AMR's chairman and chief executive  
officer, said the strong domestic economy and lower fuel prices 
helped results. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1999, Carty said, the company plans to add 45 new Boeing  
aircraft and 31 new regional jets, upgrade airport facilities and 
improve passenger service. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AMR fell $2.87 1/2, or 4 percent, to $61.37 1/2 on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
 *America West    	
</P>
<P>
	America West Holdings Corp., which owns the airline and The  
Leisure Company, earned $20.15 million, or 51 cents per share, in 
the fourth quarter, up from $20.09 million, or 43 cents a share in 
last year's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had estimated the company  
would earn 39 cents per share. This year's results include a 
one-time $3.7 million charge for signing bonuses for mechanics and 
writing off some software applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the charge, the company would have earned $22.4 million  
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	America West said its net income for 1998 was $108.6 million, up  
45 percent from the previous record in 1997 of $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong report helped America West shares rise 5.5 percent,  
or $1, to $19.12 1/2 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	William Franke, chairman and chief executive officer of the  
America West Holding Corp., said earnings were bolstered by 
better-than-expected performance by The Leisure Company, the 
company's vacation-package branch. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's strong performance continued despite an ongoing  
dispute with its flight attendants' union. The flight attendants 
have gone without a contract since 1994, and the union has asked 
federal permission to begin striking. The union has already 
authorized a strike if that permission is given.

<HEADLINE> Court To Decide on Internet Porn </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- In its second attempt to keep Internet  
pornography away from children, Congress took aim at commercial Web 
sites with a law that would require users to provide concrete proof 
of their ages. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Child Online Protection Act has met with just as much  
opposition as its predecessor, leading to a three-day hearing 
scheduled to begin today in federal court. The law for now is on 
hold. 
</P>
<P>
	The act would require commercial Web sites to collect a credit  
card number or some other access code as proof of age before 
allowing Internet users to view online material deemed ``harmful to 
minors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Violators would face penalties of up to six months in jail and a  
$50,000 fine. 
</P>
<P>
	``If Congress wins this, the Internet would go from being the  
most revolutionary, creative technology in history to a pretty 
tame, often meaningless means of communicating only about things 
that are fit for a 6-year-old,'' said Stefan Presser, legal 
director of the ACLU of Pennsylvania. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties Union and the Justice  
Department each have 1 1/2 days to argue their cases and call 
witnesses in the hearing before U.S. District Judge Lowell Reed. 
</P>
<P>
	In November, Reed temporarily blocked enforcement of the law.  
Now, the judge will decide whether a preliminary injunction -- a 
more permanent delay -- should be issued. A ruling is expected by 
Feb. 1, when the restraining order expires. 
</P>
<P>
	Supporters say the law is a sensible way to keep Internet  
pornography away from children. Unlike the Communications Decency 
Act of 1996, which the Supreme Court struck down on First Amendment 
grounds, the new law applies only to commercial Web sites. 
</P>
<P>
	The law would act as a ``brown paper wrapper'' protecting  
children from pornographic and obscene material, said Donna Rice 
Hughes, a spokeswoman for the advocacy group Enough Is Enough. 
</P>
<P>
	``Playboy and Penthouse are protected speech for adults, not  
kids,'' she said. ``We want to do the same thing in cyberspace with 
respect to the World Wide Web.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The ACLU has argued that the law, signed by President Clinton in  
October, violates the First Amendment and could be used to unfairly 
prosecute gays and lesbians, AIDS activists, or doctors 
distributing gynecological information. 
</P>
<P>
	Others are concerned that a bill aimed mainly at pornographic  
Web sites might inadvertently snare mainstream sites, especially as 
the Internet matures into an entertainment medium that could 
include movies. 
</P>
<P>
	A court brief on the ACLU's behalf has been filed by more than  
20 organizations representing publishers, Internet service 
providers, journalists and the technology industry. The groups 
contend that filtering software and other technologies do a far 
better job as porn watchdogs in a global medium than any U.S. law 
ever could.

<HEADLINE> China To Tackle Bad Bank Debts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- China plans to establish four asset management  
companies to assume the bad debts of its four major state 
commercial banks, the central bank governor was reported Wednesday 
as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai Xianglong said the reclassification of the banks' lending  
portfolios in line with international norms also would be finished 
this year, the China Daily reported. The new accounting standards 
will present a clearer picture of the banks' assets, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai outlined the steps to reduce the commercial banks' bad loans  
to a meeting of banking officials Tuesday in Beijing, the newspaper 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	It gave few details, but Dai has estimated that about 20 percent  
of China's bank loans are non-performing and that 6 to 7 percent 
are unrecoverable. Years of government-ordered lending and risky 
investments contributed to the debts that have left China's 
troubled banking system technically insolvent. 
</P>
<P>
	The weight of bad loans also has hampered efforts to overhaul  
banks to support other economic reforms, including modernizing the 
ailing state industrial sector. 
</P>
<P>
	The idea behind formation of the four asset management companies  
is to separate bad assets from banks. The pilot institutions will 
each acquire and try to recover part of the bad debts of the 
Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of 
China, the Bank of China and the China Construction Bank, the China 
Daily paraphrased Dai as saying. 
</P>
<P>
	It did not give a timetable. But the institutions are expected  
to be modeled after the U.S. Resolution Trust Corp., which rescued 
bankrupt savings and loans associations in the United States during 
the early 1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	An Agricultural Bank of China official told Dow Jones Newswires  
on Tuesday that the bank will act as the parent for its new 
debt-management company, and that only unrecoverable loans will be 
transferred to the institution.

<HEADLINE> GOP State of Union Response Text 2 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
 *UNDATED: here. Steve --    	
</P>
<P>
	Thanks, Jennifer. Again, my name is Steve Largent and I  
represent Oklahoma's 1st Congressional District. Tonight, I want to 
share some brief, but important, thoughts with you. 
</P>
<P>
	First, let me say what a special privilege it is to speak to you  
and give my response and the Republican response to the president's 
remarks. 
</P>
<P>
	Let me tell you a bit about myself. I grew up in Oklahoma and  
was born in the very district I'm now proud to represent. I was 
raised in a broken home and thanks to my Mom, I stayed in school, 
stayed out of most trouble, and went to college. I married my high 
school sweetheart, Terry, a cheerleader. And, for the next 14 
years, I got to live every boy's dream -- playing in the National 
Football League for the Seattle Seahawks. 
</P>
<P>
	After I concluded my career in the NFL, I started my own  
marketing and advertising business back in Tulsa. But in 1994 I 
campaigned for the first elective office in my life and won. I came 
to Washington with a group of Republicans committed to balancing 
the budget, slowing the growth of government, cutting taxes, 
reforming welfare and saving Medicare. And that's exactly what we 
did. 
</P>
<P>
	But as Babe Ruth once said, ``Yesterday's home runs don't win  
today's games.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It's time to step up to the plate once again.  
</P>
<P>
	Prior to 1994, my wife and I were not political. We were like  
most families -- raising four kids, hustling from one school or 
sports event to another, our car littered by fast-food wrappers and 
French fries. In fact, it wasn't until after I was elected that I 
attended a Republican function where a banner hung that read 
``GOP.'' I had to ask what those letters stood for. 
</P>
<P>
	They said, ``Grand Old Party, of course.''  
</P>
<P>
	I believe tonight is an appropriate time to ask once again, what  
does the GOP stand for? What does the party of Lincoln and Reagan 
stand for today? What are the lasting bedrock principles that 
personify and distinguish the Republican party? It's these 
questions I want to answer tonight because the answer is why I ran 
for office in the first place. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's the 15-second sound bite answer -- the Republican party's  
mission is to promote, preserve, and protect individual liberty, 
free enterprise and limited government. But what does that mean to 
my family and your family? 
</P>
<P>
	Individual Liberty  
</P>
<P>
	First, we must preserve the notion that true liberty and freedom  
come from God and are his blessing on this land and that freedom 
reigns only as we act responsibly toward God, each other, and his 
creation. Our freedom was bought at a great price, and our most 
important responsibility is to defend this sacred gift and keep our 
country secure. Tonight we support our troops that are stationed in 
Bosnia, the Middle East and around the world. And the good news is 
that after six years of cutting spending for our armed forces, the 
president has signaled that he is ready to join us in strengthening 
our national defense. 
</P>
<P>
	We must never be complacent in what is still a dangerous world.  
Terrorists and rogue nations are rapidly acquiring technology to 
deliver weapons of mass destruction to our very doorstep. Most 
Americans are shocked to discover that our country is unshielded 
from the accidental or ruthless launch of even a single missile 
over our skies. Mr. President, we urge you to join Congress in 
establishing a viable missile defense system to protect the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	Protecting individual liberty also means protecting the unborn.  
Again this year, overwhelming majorities in both houses will urge 
the president to end the dreadful and unwarranted practice of 
partial-birth abortion. We must uphold the sanctity of life amidst 
the tragedies of abortion, euthanasia, and assisted suicide. 
</P>
<P>
	Free Enterprise  
</P>
<P>
	Republicans also promote free enterprise. We believe market  
principles like competition work. At the heart of free enterprise 
is good education. For far too long we've allowed Washington to 
dictate how our children are taught. One of our priorities is to 
give control of our schools to local communities, We want the most 
important election affecting your children's education to be the 
one that decides who sits on the school board, not who you send to 
Washington. Parents deserve the opportunity to choose the best 
school, with the best curriculum, best teachers, and safest 
environment for their children. 
</P>
<P>
	I recently met with a room full of teachers in Jenks, Okla. I  
came out of that meeting convinced more than ever that teachers 
like these know best how federal education dollars should be spent. 
That's why Republicans are leading the effort that will ensure 90 
cents of every federal education dollar goes directly to the 
classroom, empowering parents and teachers, not bureaucrats. 
</P>
<P>
	And if we really want to ``free'' enterprise and the economy,  
let's scrap the Internal Revenue tax code. The 8,000-plus pages of 
confusion, contradiction and confiscation are choking small 
business and driving the average taxpayer mad. Republicans want to 
establish a date by which the tax code will be abolished and 
replaced by something that's simple, fair, and takes a smaller bite 
from the family's pocket book. 
</P>
<P>
	Limited Government  
</P>
<P>
	Finally, Republicans stand for limited government. Ronald Reagan  
warned that ``a government that is big enough to give you 
everything you want is also big enough to take everything you 
have.'' And tonight the federal government is still too big and 
taking more than it should. We will continue our efforts to control 
Washington's wasteful spending and its insatiable appetite for your 
money. 
</P>
<P>
	Well, this is what the Grand Old Party stands for and if this  
represents your hopes and dreams, we ask not that you pull for us, 
but that you push with us. 
</P>
<P>
	Reconciliation  
</P>
<P>
	Back in my district, Oklahomans are steeped in America's deep  
tradition of faith, family, hard work and strong neighborhoods, 
They represent the values that hold communities together, And they 
believe in the power of a better tomorrow. There's still a lot to 
be done, But I, too, am more optimistic than ever, These last four 
years have given me the unique opportunity to witness the grit and 
determination of the American people -- our greatest resource. 
</P>
<P>
	Yesterday marked the 70th year since the birth of a great  
American leader and hero, Dr. Martin Luther King, In one of his 
last sermons in 1968, Dr. King warned that, while the world is a 
closer neighborhood, we are experiencing less brotherhood. That's 
just as true today. It is no longer the aggression from without 
that is America's greatest threat, but alienation from within; 
alienation at every level -- husband from wife, mother from father, 
parent from child, black from white, Republican from Democrat, 
liberal from conservative. 
</P>
<P>
	There is only one solution -- reconciliation. Ironically, the  
word Congress itself is made of two Latin words that mean ``to walk 
together.'' Reconciliation requires the humility and courage to 
say, ``I'm sorry, I was wrong, will you forgive me.'' Therein lies 
the healing salve for the wounded soul of our nation. You see, the 
body of our country is strong. It's the heart that needs attention. 
</P>
<P>
	On Christmas Eve my family and I packed up kids and gifts and  
headed to Grandma's house. In the car we sang along with Vince 
Gill's Christmas tape. As we sang one particular song, I was struck 
by the words and by their poignancy for our country tonight. The 
chorus went, ``Let there be peace on Earth, and let it begin with 
me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So, let there be peace on Earth, and let it begin with me. Let  
it begin with Republicans and Democrats and blacks and whites, moms 
and especially dads. Let there be peace on Earth and let it begin 
with all of us who comprise one nation, under God, indivisible. 
</P>
<P>
	And if we work together and walk together, and if we have a  
Congress motivated not by the maintenance of power, but principle, 
then I believe historians will tell our children's children: There 
walked a great people, a nation that preserved the wonderful 
promise that we call America. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you for taking a few moments tonight. May God bless you  
and your family, and may God continue to bless this great nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Thank you for listening. Good night.  
</P>

<HEADLINE> Former Senator To Defend Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Just-retired Sen. Dale Bumpers, who built a  
reputation as a keen orator during his 24 years in the chamber, 
will make the closing arguments Thursday on behalf of his old 
friend, Bill Clinton. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers will argue that the House case is a ``partisan rush to  
judgment'' that doesn't meet with the ``higher duty the Senate has 
always had,'' an adviser to the White House said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	As an alumnus of the exclusive club that is the Senate, Bumpers  
was picked by the White House so he could talk ex-senator to 
senator, something presidential lawyers couldn't do, said this 
adviser, speaking on condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers, who has expressed his dismay at Clinton's conduct, was  
mum Wednesday about what he planned to say. His recent statements, 
though, provide a preview of a likely line of attack. 
</P>
<P>
	In a farewell speech to the Senate last fall, Bumpers likened  
the investigation of Clinton to one of the most unjust government 
probes in history. ``You'd have to go back to the Salem witchcraft 
trials to find anything comparable,'' he said then. 
</P>
<P>
	Bumpers, 73, was one of Clinton's predecessors as Arkansas'  
governor and goes way back with the president. ``He knows Bill 
Clinton from the word go,'' said Ralph Shelby, sergeant-at-arms of 
the Arkansas State Senate and Bumpers' childhood friend. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sort of wish I was over there to help out,'' Bumpers said in  
an interview with The Associated Press earlier this month. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House this week fulfilled that wish. Bumpers was  
present at the defense table in the well of the Senate when 
Clinton's lawyers opened their case Tuesday, and the White House 
announced that the famously blunt-spoken orator would close its 
defense. 
</P>
<P>
	Even Republicans praised Clinton's choice.  
</P>
<P>
	``I think the White House couldn't have picked anyone better  
from an oratory standpoint,'' said Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., one 
of the House prosecutors. ``Will he have an impact? Sure.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, called Bumpers ``one of the great  
orators of our time.'' But Bennett added he was ``usually not 
persuaded by the things he said on the Senate floor. But we'll 
see.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Arkansas Democrats say Bumpers still feels the same way about  
Clinton as he did when he gave his farewell speech to the Senate, 
but has softened his rhetoric in speeches around the state and cast 
the issue more in constitutional terms. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that he likes to say when he talks about  
this is that Republicans in Congress have often treated the Bill of 
Rights like a rough draft,'' said Glen Hooks, executive director of 
the state Democratic party. 
</P>
<P>
	``He would see this as the same type of situation where the  
Republicans don't have the same type of reverence to the 
Constitution that they should have - and that Dale Bumpers does 
have,'' Hooks said.

<HEADLINE> Quick Look at Clinton Polls </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Some results from polls released Wednesday on President Clinton,  
the State of the Union address and the impeachment trial in the 
Senate. When percentages do not add up to 100 percent, the 
remainder had no response. 
</P>
<P>
	--Do you approve or disapprove of the way Bill Clinton is  
handling his job as president? 
</P>
<P>
	Approve -- 66 percent; disapprove -- 32 percent (ABC News).  
Approve -- 72 percent; disapprove -- 23 percent (CBS News). Approve -- 
76 percent; disapprove -- 22 percent (NBC News). His approval 
ratings before the speech were three to five points lower, 
depending on the poll. 
</P>
<P>
	--Do you think the proposals President Clinton made tonight (in  
the State of the Union address) concerning the Social Security 
system will or will not save Social Security for the next century? 
</P>
<P>
	Will -- 75 percent; will not -- 18 percent (CNN/USA Today/Gallup).  
</P>
<P>
	--In the president's speech, do you think he should have said  
more about the impeachment trial? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, should have said more -- 15 percent; No, should not -- 85  
percent (CBS News). 
</P>
<P>
	--Do you think President Clinton's actions are serious enough to  
warrant his being convicted by the Senate and removed from the 
Presidency, or not? 
</P>
<P>
	Yes, serious enough -- 39 percent; no, not serious enough -- 61  
percent (CBS News). The percentage a week ago in a CBS poll that 
thought his actions serious enough to warrant his removal was 35 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Who do you trust to do a better job coping with the main  
problems the nation faces over the next few years -- Clinton or the 
Republicans in Congress? 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton -- 50 percent; Republicans -- 32 percent (ABC News). In  
early 1995, 54 percent trusted the Republicans who had just taken 
over Congress in coping with the nation's problems more than they 
trusted Clinton, who was more trusted by 30 percent. 
</P>
<P>
                            	 *------	 
</P>
<P>
	The CBS poll of 930 adults had a margin of error of plus or  
minus 3 percentage points. The ABC poll of 584 adults had a margin 
of error of plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. The NBC poll of 
620 adults had margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage 
points. The CNN/USA Today/Gallup Poll of 454 adults had a margin of 
error of plus or minus 5 percentage points. The polls were taken 
Tuesday night.

<HEADLINE>  NFL Hall Welcomes Diehard Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CANTON, Ohio (AP) -- Not far from where Joe Namath and Weeb  
Ewbank are immortalized in bronze, Ed Anzalone climbed on someone's 
shoulders and began the war cry that rocks the Meadowlands. 
</P>
<P>
	``J-E-T-S! Jets! Jets! Jets!'' screamed Anzalone, also known as  
``Fireman Ed. 
</P>
<P>
	The Pro Football Hall of Fame never had heard or seen anything  
like it. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time since its doors opened for fans in 1963, the  
hall has fans among its members. It christened its Visa Hall of 
Fans exhibit on Tuesday by recognizing 31 of the most diehard NFL 
fans in the land -- one from each team, including the Cleveland 
Browns. 
</P>
<P>
	``Fireman Ed'' was part of the Hall's Class of '99 along with  
``Mr. Cheer or Die,'' ``Mama Blue,'' ``Jersey John,'' ``Boltman,'' 
``Arrowman,'' ``Green Man,'' ``The Packalope'' and ``Big Dawg,'' 
the leader of the Cleveland Browns' Dawg Pound. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Jerry Vecchia, who has worn at least one piece of clothing  
with the New York Giants logo on it since 1983. ``Twenty-four hours 
a day, seven days a week,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Da Pope'', also known as Lionel Alphonso Sr., who began  
dressing like the Pope for every New Orleans Saints home game since 
Pope John Paul II visited the Superdome in 1987. ``Bless you,'' he 
said upon enshrinement. 
</P>
<P>
	-- ``Barrel Man,'' also known as Tim McKernan, who wears an  
orange cowboy hat, boots and an orange barrel supported by 
suspenders over his bare chest -- and bare bottom -- at every Denver 
Broncos home game. ``Gets a little cold sometimes,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a dream come true for all fans and especially for  
these 31,'' said Lido Starelli, who has missed one San Francisco 
49ers game in 53 years. 
</P>
<P>
	Starelli, a San Francisco season-ticket holder since the team's  
founding in 1946, has a room dedicated to the 49ers in his home, 
which includes every program, media guide, lapel pin, stationary, 
Christmas card and pocket schedule from the last 50 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I saw the 49ers first play, I just fell in love with it.  
My first game was like the birth of my first child,'' he said. 
``The 49ers have given me so many great memories.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The only time Starelli missed a 49ers home game was in 1959 when  
his father died. 
</P>
<P>
	``December fifth, against the Baltimore Colts,'' he said when  
asked if he remembered the date of that game. 
</P>
<P>
	Joe Curtis saw the Atlanta Falcons play their first preseason  
home game in 1965 and hasn't missed one since. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've been to 252 regular season games, 62 preseason and 75 out  
of town,'' said Curtis, a retired Air Force colonel. ``And now I'm 
finally going to a Super Bowl.''

<HEADLINE> Supreme Court Rebuffs Baby Bells </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The nation's biggest local phone companies  
lost a bid Tuesday to provide long-distance service to customers 
without having to meet requirements of a 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court, without comment, rejected appeals by three  
Bell telephone companies -- SBC Communications, US West and Bell 
Atlantic -- that the law unconstitutionally singles them out for 
punishment. 
</P>
<P>
	The law requires the five Baby Bells to open their local phone  
markets to long-distance companies and other potential rivals 
before the Federal Communications Commission will let them sell 
their own long-distance service to local customers. This 
requirements doesn't apply to other local phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	No Bell company has yet won such FCC approval because, the  
commission says, none has sufficiently opened its market. 
</P>
<P>
	In other business-related decisions Tuesday, the court:  
</P>
<P>
	--Left intact a $2 billion class-action settlement over  
allegations that insurance agents for Prudential Insurance Co. 
misled policyholders over a 13-year period. The justices, without 
comment, rejected appeals from some policyholders who challenged 
the 1997 settlement's fairness. 
</P>
<P>
	The settlement covered more than 8 million policyholders who may  
have been duped into buying devalued insurance policies. Of the 
potential class members, only 1.1 million had applied by last 
summer to receive any compensation. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to revive a massive civil rights lawsuit against many  
of the nation's largest insurance companies filed on behalf of 
93,000 homeowners living in predominantly black neighborhoods of 
St. Louis and Kansas City, Mo. The justices, without comment, left 
intact rulings that threw out the case. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1996 lawsuit accused insurance companies of discriminatory  
``redlining'' -- refusing to sell homeowners insurance on equal 
terms based on the racial composition of their neighborhoods. 
</P>
<P>
	--Left intact the $1-per-head fee cattle producers must pay on  
all cattle sold in or imported to the United States to fund generic 
advertising for beef and beef products. The court, without comment, 
rejected a Kansas cattle rancher's challenge to the fee required by 
a 1985 federal law, the Beef Promotion and Research Act. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Goetz's lawsuit, filed on behalf of all other cattle  
producers, contended that the fee violates free-speech and 
equal-protection rights and amounts to an unlawful tax. 
</P>
<P>
	--Refused to revive an effort by ticket buyers' to force  
Ticketmaster to pay triple damages for alleged overcharges. The 
lawsuit accused Ticketmaster of monopolizing the ticket-sales 
business for large popular music concerts and of using its 
advantage to charge sales and handling fees as high as $20 per 
ticket. 
</P>
<P>
	The FCC hailed the Supreme Court's decision to let stand rulings  
by courts in New Orleans and the District of Columbia, that upheld 
the constitutionality of the long-distance requirements. 
</P>
<P>
	``The companies should stop litigating and give Americans what  
they want -- choice,'' said FCC Chairman Bill Kennard. 
</P>
<P>
	U S West called the court decision ``a real setback for  
consumers. It further delays long-distance choice for customers,'' 
said spokesman David Beigie. 
</P>
<P>
	Bell Atlantic, meanwhile, is working to open its markets to  
competitors and is expected this year to ask the FCC for permission 
to provide long-distance to local customers in New York. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our long-distance effort is alive and well and strong despite  
the high court's decision,'' said Bell Atlantic spokeswoman Shannon 
Fioravanti. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC said it will continue to work with federal and state  
regulators to get into the long-distance business. ``We are more 
determined than ever to win the right to provide the full range of 
services our customers demand and deserve,'' the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another Bell company, BellSouth, said it has no plans to  
withdraw an appeal to the Supreme Court based on the same 
constitutional arguments made by Bell Atlantic, U S West and SBC. 
That appeal, however, challenges electronic publishing provisions 
in the 1996 law. 
</P>
<P>
	The remaining Bell company, Ameritech, didn't have any immediate  
comment on the Supreme Court's action. 
</P>
<P>
	The Constitution bars a law that is punitive as it applies to an  
individual or a specific group. The three phone companies' argued 
in their appeals that the 1996 law subjected them to such a ``bill 
of attainder.'' Government lawyers, defending the provisions, 
disagreed.

<HEADLINE> Heston Wants Director Kazan Honored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Charlton Heston is asking Hollywood to bestow  
honors on Elia Kazan, the ``On the Waterfront'' director whose 
naming of names before the House Un-American Activities Committee 
during the 1950s made him an outcast among his colleagues. 
</P>
<P>
	In a letter published Wednesday in The Wall Street Journal,  
Heston said Kazan deserves a Life Achievement Award from the 
American Film Institute. Heston was once chairman of the 
organization. 
</P>
<P>
	Hollywood has already tried to make its peace with Kazan with a  
special Oscar to be given him at the Academy Awards in March, but 
Heston said he deserved more. 
</P>
<P>
	``The quality of his work as a director, both on Broadway and in  
Hollywood, is beyond dispute,'' Heston said. 
</P>
<P>
	Kazan, who won Oscars for ``Gentleman's Agreement'' in 1947 and  
``On the Waterfront'' in 1954, joined the Communist party in the 
1930s, but resigned soon after World War II. Called before HUAC, 
Kazan admitted his past and acknowledged the communist ties of some 
of his colleagues.

<HEADLINE> 22 Hurt After Jet Hits Turbulence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- A Continental Airlines flight from Tokyo to  
Honolulu hit severe turbulence Wednesday, injuring 18 passengers 
and four flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	The injuries were mostly bumps and bruises, said Sarah Anthony,  
an airline spokeswoman. Thirteen passengers were treated at The 
Queen's Medical Center and released, spokeswoman Karen Winpenny 
said. The flight attendants were treated at another hospital for 
contusions and strains. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 910 landed safely at the Honolulu airport about three  
hours after hitting turbulence at 33,000 feet, said Marilyn Kali of 
the state Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was carrying 330 passengers, 15 flight attendants and  
three pilots, Ms. Anthony said. Most of the injured passengers were 
sitting in the back of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, one woman was killed and 102 other passengers  
were injured when a United Airlines Tokyo-to-Honolulu flight hit 
turbulence and dropped about 100 feet over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, passengers on China Airlines and Japan Airlines  
flights were injured by turbulence on their way to Honolulu.

<HEADLINE> 11 Deaths Blamed on Tainted Meat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	A strain of a deadly bacteria traced to a Zeeland, Mich., meat  
plant is now blamed with causing 11 deaths and three miscarriages 
in 13 states. 
</P>
<P>
	The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said Wednesday  
its tests trace the contamination back to listeria bacteria found 
in hot dogs and deli meats made at Sara Lee Corp.'s Bil Mar Foods 
division. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths and miscarriages have been reported Arizona,  
Connecticut, Georgia, Iowa, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, New 
York, Ohio, Oregon, Tennessee, Vermont and West Virginia. An exact 
breakdown was not available. 
</P>
<P>
	About 1,800 cases of food poisoning caused by listeria are  
reported annually in the United States. Healthy people usually can 
fight off the bacterium with no more than flu-like symptoms. But 
listeria can kill, causing meningitis or blood infection. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's largest listeria outbreak occurred in California in  
1985, according to the CDC. Forty-eight people died and 66 
miscarriages were reported from contaminated Mexican-style cheese.

<HEADLINE> Olympic Medals Sought in Drug Cases </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The White House will try to have duplicate  
medals awarded to Olympic athletes known to have lost to 
competitors using illegal drugs, the federal drug czar said 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Barry McCaffrey, director of the Office of National Drug Control  
Policy, plans to pursue the matter at next month's world doping 
summit despite the IOC's recent rejection of at least two similar 
pleas. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our voice should be listened to,'' he said, noting two-thirds  
of the International Olympic Committee's revenue comes from U.S. 
television networks and corporate sponsors. 
</P>
<P>
	Last month, the IOC turned down requests from the U.S. Olympic  
Committee and the British Olympic Association for duplicate medals 
for swimmers beaten by East Germans in the 1976 and 1980 Games. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent testimony in Germany has shown that the winning East  
German athletes were helped by banned steroids administered as part 
of a secret government program. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC said it was impossible to rewrite the record books,  
despite court evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``We need to look at the notion of supplemental medals when it  
can be proved in the courts where medals were lost to chemically 
engineered competition,'' McCaffrey said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey said he had asked USOC president Bill Hybl at a White  
House meeting Wednesday to add 1972 Olympic marathon champion Frank 
Shorter to his delegation to the summit in Lausanne, Switzerland, 
Feb. 2-4. 
</P>
<P>
	Shorter is considering pursuit of a second gold medal from the  
1976 Olympic marathon, where he finished second to East Germany's 
Waldemar Cierpinski. He says evidence from files of the Stasi, the 
East German secret police, show that Cierpinski also was involved 
in the doping program, and that information will eventually wind up 
in court. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a related issue to what is really most important, and  
that is trying to help the IOC know what is really going on,'' 
Shorter said by phone from his Colorado home. 
</P>
<P>
	He said his interest in drug issues has been heightened in  
recent years by the success of his 19-year-old son in distance 
running at the University of Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to do everything I can so he feels it's not necessary  
to resort to illegal drugs to compete and win at a high level,'' 
Shorter said. 
</P>
<P>
	Last November, McCaffrey's office announced an unprecedented $1  
million federal pledge toward research for drug testing in sports. 
He said Wednesday that was a ``down payment'' on future government 
action but denied federal funding would be linked to the medals 
request. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are pursuing arguments on an emerging, universal opinion  
that we have to protect the beliefs of 12-year-olds that you don't 
have to use drugs and there will be a level playing field if you 
chose to compete,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McCaffrey will head a six-member federal delegation to the  
summit, including representatives of the State Department and the 
National Institute for Drug Abuse. 
</P>
<P>
	He plans to meet with delegations from 10 countries, including  
China, to form a ``common understanding'' before the session.

<HEADLINE> Anthology Battles for Acceptance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- An upstart is trying to dethrone the Norton  
Anthology of English Literature, the king of college literary 
texts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Longman Anthology of British Literature is battling for  
academic acceptance with an infusion of more female writers, 
political and cultural commentary accompanying the classics, even 
snippets of Monty Python. 
</P>
<P>
	``Literature should come across as exciting and compelling,''  
said David Damrosch, general editor of the anthology and an English 
professor at Columbia University. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding savage reviews and historical context makes literary  
masterpieces ``more human and less like timeless monuments,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than simply presenting poet William Wordsworth's ethereal  
``I Wandered Lonely as a Cloud'' by itself, the Longman offers a 
withering review of another one of his works. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will never do ... The case of Mr. Wordsworth, we perceive  
is manifestly hopeless; and we give him up as altogether incurable 
and beyond the power of criticism,'' wrote one critic about 
Wordsworth's poem ``The Excursion.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's also an excerpt from the comedy troupe Monty Python  
tucked alongside ``Cruise,'' Evelyn Waugh's 1936 satire of British 
tourists. 
</P>
<P>
	But some scholars feel the Longman's approach is too politically  
correct, sacrificing some fine literature for a trendy cultural 
payoff. Reducing the amount of Tennyson and Spenser, critics say, 
is harmful to the field. 
</P>
<P>
	The tempest raged at the Modern Language Association's annual  
meeting in San Francisco last month when several hundred scholars 
attended a lively debate on the future of literary criticism. 
</P>
<P>
	There's much more at stake here than Brit Lit bragging rights.  
Nearly 100,000 anthologies -- at a cost of more than $100 each -- are 
purchased each year, with W.W. Norton's flagship book capturing 
more than 90 percent of the market. 
</P>
<P>
	But more than 200 professors converted to the Longman this  
school year at schools including the University of California, Los 
Angeles, Baylor University, the University of Arizona, Northeastern 
University, the University of Michigan, the University of Hawaii 
and the University of North Carolina. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite its new rival's inroads, the Norton's editors aren't  
surrendering without a fight. 
</P>
<P>
	Acknowledging the splash Longman made, Norton editor Julia  
Reidhead urges critics to wait until the book's seventh edition 
appears this summer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Right now it's comparing an apple to an orange,'' Reidhead  
said of the current Norton edition, last updated in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	``The next edition is going to give much greater attention to  
women writers overall,'' she said, listing such names as Aphra 
Behn, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Christina Rossetti, Frances 
Burney, Elizabeth Gaskell and Jean Rhys. 
</P>
<P>
	The newest Norton will have the full text of Virginia Woolf's  
``A Room of One's Own,'' as well as material from former parts of 
the British empire, such as India, the Caribbean and Africa. 
</P>
<P>
	Authors like J.M. Coetzee of South Africa and Nigeria's Chinua  
Achebe will make appearances, along with in-depth cultural 
perspectives of medieval Arthurian legends and offbeat 16th-century 
travel essays. 
</P>
<P>
	To top it off, the Norton has another trick up its sleeve: a  
one-of-a-kind translation of the eighth-century poem ``Beowulf'' by 
Nobel Prize-winning Irish poet Seamus Heaney. 
</P>
<P>
	``This will be an emblem of world culture,'' said Stephen  
Greenblatt, a professor of English at Harvard University and 
associate general editor of the Norton anthology. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenblatt says he has nothing against a little Monty Python  
mixed into the highbrow study of canonical authors. But he said 
Norton intends to weigh current trends with a deep sense of respect 
for literary ghosts of the past. 
</P>
<P>
	``My question is: What are you going to take out to put  
something in?'' he asked. ``It's like a museum with so much 
wonderful art -- what gets chosen to go on the walls?'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said Norton will not drop traditional poems and Shakespearean  
sonnets that have been left out of the Longman collection. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the changes that Longman has made we will not be  
making,'' Greenblatt said. ``Our book will be more in touch with 
the traditional artistic values than cultural assessments of 
them.''

<HEADLINE> NY Fed Chief Downplays Brazil Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The U.S. financial system isn't being threatened  
by Brazil's ongoing financial problems, the president of the 
Federal Reserve Bank of New York said after meeting with Brazil's 
finance minister. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no concern at all about systemic risk coming from any  
country, including (Brazil),'' said William McDonough. ``I believe 
the United States banking system is sound and solid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough made his comments at a speaking engagement at the  
Japan Society Wednesday after earlier meeting with Brazil's Pedro 
Malan and several representatives from the world of private 
finance. 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil churned world markets last week when it devalued its  
currency, the real, and then let it float on world foreign 
exchanges without government attempts to prop up its value. Even as 
the real plunged, financial markets were relieved once Brazil 
stopped spending billions of dollars to defend its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	There continue to be worries over Brazil, Latin America's  
largest economy, on top of the problems in Asia and Russia over the 
past 18 months. There are about 2,000 U.S. multinational 
corporations with dealings in Brazil and U.S. banks have great 
exposure there and in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	But McDonough said that by using the standard tools to gauge an  
economy's strength, such as the ratio of debt to gross domestic 
product, there is no need to renegotiate Brazil's foreign debt. 
Recovering those debts ``are not a problem for U.S. institutions,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough is the U.S. Treasury's banker and currency dealer,  
with the New York Fed carrying out transactions in bond and foreign 
exchange markets to implement monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough's comments about Brazil not having to renegotiate its  
foreign debt brought relief in some corners of the foreign exchange 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at Bank Leumi USA,  
said that if McDonough doesn't see a need for renegotiating debt, 
then ``it means he sees some sense of stabilization for the market 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This means he sees some type of light at the end of the  
tunnel, and there won't be a Russia case or a Venezuela,'' Waxman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The morning meeting with Malan ``was basically an exchange of  
views,'' said McDonough, where Malan asked for suggestions. Malan 
arrived in Washington on Friday, conferring with officials from the 
U.S. Treasury, the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan has been trying to reassure those officials his country  
can persevere during this crisis but he wanted a $9 billion 
installment of an IMF-led rescue package that includes a $41.5 
billion emergency line of credit. Brazil already has received about 
$9 billion.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Addresses Foreign Affairs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Challenges in Kosovo and by Iraq, concerns  
about the stability of Russia and human rights in China and a 
looming battle with Japan over trade got little more than a 
sentence each in President Clinton's State of the Union address 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, Clinton devoted the foreign affairs segments of his  
speech to addressing Americans' fear of terrorists, asking for more 
money for the military, the United Nations and to dismantle 
Russia's still dangerous nuclear weapons industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's biggest challenge, according to Sen. Joseph Biden,  
D-Del., may be working with Congress after a year of discord. ``In 
some areas, the president's ability to lead is limited by the 
uncertainty of congressional support,'' Biden said after Clinton's 
speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers last year rejected appropriating enough money to pay  
all U.N. dues, blocked appointments, cut Clinton's requests for 
foreign aid and offered little bipartisan support for any of his 
foreign policy initiative. 
</P>
<P>
	The president devoted only 15 minutes to foreign policy, trade  
and defense in a speech dominated by concerns at home: Social 
Security, education and taxes. 
</P>
<P>
	He asked Congress to help him ``pursue peace, fight terrorism,  
increase our strength and renew our alliances ... to build a 
stronger 21st century America in a freer, more peaceful world.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He criticized Cuba, China, Iraq and Serbia on human rights, and  
close ally Japan for its surging steel exports. 
</P>
<P>
	He scored Cuba as the only non-democratic government in the  
Western Hemisphere and criticized China, Iraq and Serbia on human 
rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``Stability can no longer be bought at the expense of liberty,''  
he said of China, but warning tht it must not be isolated. 
</P>
<P>
	On Iraq, he said America will ``continue to contain Saddam -- and  
will work for the day when Iraq has a government worthy of its 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton offered no indication of imminent U.S. action to stop  
the violence in Kosovo, saying only that the United States and its 
NATO allies ``are pressing the Serbian government to stop its 
brutal repression.'' 
</P>
<P>
	On the economic front, Clinton urged a new round of world trade  
negotiations, hoping to counter protectionist forces set loose by 
current financial turmoil. ``We must tear down barriers, open 
markets and expand trade,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also warned Japan that if its steel exports ``are not  
reversed, America will respond.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton called for a $12 billion increase in defense spending --  
part of a plan to add $110 billion over six years. Republicans 
quickly endorsed that plan, claiming it as their own. 
</P>
<P>
	``The president has signaled that he is ready to join us in  
strengthening our national defense,'' said Rep. Steve Largent, 
R-Okla. In the GOP's response, Largent called for new missile 
defense system to protect the United States -- a controversial 
proposal Clinton did not address. 
</P>
<P>
	The president did not mention the failing health of Russian  
President Boris Yeltsin. But he proposed assistance to Russia that 
would add to the Nunn-Lugar program aimed at dismantling nuclear 
weapons. He said it would increase funding by nearly two-thirds 
over five years -- $4.2 billion the first year -- to help redirect 
the work of Russian scientists from weapons research to peacetime 
pursuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton asked for increased support for U.S. diplomacy around  
the world and called again for Senate ratification of the 
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, which is opposed by many 
conservative Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	He also pledged to increase efforts to restrain the spread of  
nuclear weapons in North Korea, India and Pakistan and urged 
Congress to continue to provide funds for Mideast peace and to 
support the transition to democracy ``now beginning to take hold in 
Nigeria.''

 *Celebrity Spotlight &AMP; Birthdays    	
</P>
<P>
	In the spotlight: Heather Graham, golden Rollergirl  

</P>
<P>
	 *Claim to fame:* One word: Rollergirl. Few can forget Heather  
Graham's bombshell turn as a roller-skating porn star in ``Boogie 
Nights,'' a moveable feast for the eyes -- an actress with a 
spectacular figure and a face like a younger Michelle Pfeiffer. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Personal stats:* Born Jan. 29, 1970, in Milwaukee, the doe-eyed  
Graham was raised in a pristine suburb just outside the San 
Fernando Valley. She moved to Los Angeles in the 1980s and began 
working in commercials before landing her first film role in 
``License to Drive.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her recent films include ``Scream 2,'' ``Lost in Space'' and  
``Two Girls and a Guy,'' which also starred Robert Downey Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Graham traces her dreams of acting back to when she was 9 or 10.  
``I thought acting in films with big stars would be so 
incredible,'' she recalls. ``I'd see an actress like Meryl Streep 
on the screen and I'd want to be like her.'' 
</P>
<P>
	She was offered a role in ``Heathers'' -- the film that launched  
Christian Slater and Winona Ryder -- but turned it down because her 
parents thought it was too dark. Then she accepted the addict's 
role in Gus Van Sant's ``Drugstore Cowboy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a chance to leave behind that white, upper-middle-class  
suburban life I had been leading,'' she explains. ``That life is 
fine if you fit in, but I never fit in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	 *Up next:* Graham will appear in ``Alien Love Triangle'' with  
Kenneth Branagh; ``Bofinger's Big Thing'' with Steve Martin and 
Eddie Murphy; and ``Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me'' with 
Mike Myers. 
</P>
<P>
	 *Too Sexy?* ``I think there are people who thought I was this  
actress who could play a sexy character and that's it. I can do 
sexy stuff and I don't mind doing it. But that's not all I can do. 
It's not just about how I look.''

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Will Find NY Is Tough Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tough guy. Tougher town.  
</P>
<P>
	The first thing that comes to mind after hearing Latrell  
Sprewell will be playing in New York is that NBA principal David 
Stern's office is only a cab ride away. Good thing, too. Because 
the next thing that comes to mind is that Spree, if he's lucky 
enough to find a cab, will be dropping by often. 
</P>
<P>
	The rumor mill had it that only three clubs -- the Knicks, Miami  
Heat and Indiana Pacers -- made serious offers to Golden State for 
Sprewell. Some people hear that and assume the league's 26 other 
teams were either too principled or too scared to trade for a guy 
who learned everything he knows about dispute resolution from 
``Dirty Harry'' movies. 
</P>
<P>
	But those people assume wrong. The truth is all those other  
clubs thought Spree was still under house arrest, a small 
inconvenience a judge tagged him with after a traffic altercation 
last year. But the Knicks apparently did their homework. They 
arranged a secret meeting recently, and when Sprewell showed up no 
longer dragging a ball and chain behind him, they set out in 
earnest to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's original offer was to send Chris Mills and Chris  
Childs to the Warriors, but after some haggling, they agreed to 
part with John Starks instead of Childs. Too bad. Imagine the scene 
if two matchheads like Sprewell and Starks wound up in the same 
backcourt and got into an argument over which one was going to 
inbound the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the chemistry problem in New York is far from solved.  
Coach Jeff Van Gundy may know a thing or two about chokeholds. But 
clamping one on Alonzo Mourning's ankle, which Van Gundy did during 
last May's Knicks-Heat playoff melee, doesn't land him in 
Sprewell's class. Spree does very few things like a real 
professional -- he undermines coaches and teammates, busts set plays 
on a whim and treats practice like it was a waste of his time -- but 
channeling anger is something he's very good at. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that the kid is evil incarnate. But like a handful of  
talented young malcontents who have turned up in the NBA in recent 
years, he's developed a warped view of life. Sprewell has been 
accorded a status he doesn't deserve, paid a salary he has yet to 
earn, and tolerated even when he acts out. 
</P>
<P>
	He still doesn't get it. Anyone who doubts that has only to look  
at what Sprewell did after the NBA whacked him with a one-year 
suspension and arbitrator John Feerick cushioned the blow. First, 
Sprewell sued to get his lost wages back. About the time the judge 
in that case quit laughing long enough to dismiss it, he considered 
suing agent Arn Tellem, his staunchest defender, for failing to 
include a clause in his contract guaranteeing his salary no matter 
what. 
</P>
<P>
	We'll hear plenty in the next few weeks about rehabilitation,  
and we'll probably see Sprewell diving after loose balls, playing 
the best basketball of his career. On that score, there's no 
argument. He can play. Despite 14 months away from NBA-caliber 
competition, he'll give the Knicks 20-some points, a handful of 
rebounds and assists every night, and play defense like only a 
handful of guys in the league are capable of. 
</P>
<P>
	But in time, he'll give them plenty of heartache, too. It's a  
guarantee. Sprewell has run three coaches out of jobs -- four if you 
count hanging-on-by-his-fingernails P.J. Carlesimo. And he's driven 
off a few talented teammates -- Tom Gugliotta and Tim Hardaway -- as 
well. What's different is that in New York, he might have finally 
met his match. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell wasn't due many more chances wherever he wound up, but  
one might be all he gets in the Big Apple. The Knicks took a flyer 
on him, in part, because with Michael Jordan's departure and the 
season cut almost in half, their chance of winning an NBA 
championship might never be better. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding the three-time All-Star to a lineup that already includes  
Patrick Ewing, Allan Houston and Larry Johnson could be just enough 
to get New York past Miami and even Indiana, especially since 
Sprewell figures to match up very well against Reggie Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	The trick, of course, is how to keep Sprewell from  
self-destructing along the way. And make no mistake: It won't be 
easy. Sprewell's teammates will only cut him so much slack. He will 
have the NBA's toughest fans on his back every time he sets foot on 
the floor at Madison Square Garden. The next morning, his grades 
will be splashed on the back pages of the toughest newspapers in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	There were a few other places Sprewell could have wound up in,  
but none of them would have schooled him the way New York will. 
It's one instance where the punishment might actually fit the 
crime.

<P>
	SECAUCUS, N.J. (AP) -- The MetroStars traded their all-time  
leading scorer, Giovanni Savarese, to the New England Revolution on 
Wednesday and sent Marcelo Vega to San Jose in a deal to satisfy 
league rules about the number of foreign players on a team. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange for Savarese and a 2000 draft selection, the

</P>
<P>
	Savarese, a Venezuelan drafted by the MetroStars in 1996, is the  
team's career leading scorer, with 42 goals and 12 assists in 90

<HEADLINE> Clinton Speech Rough on GOP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- They knew it was coming, but that does not  
spare Republicans the frustration of seeing President Clinton get 
the boost that always endows to the maestro in the State of the 
Union. 
</P>
<P>
	Especially after a scandalous year in which he has defied  
political gravity with performance ratings that went up as his 
personal standing went down. 
</P>
<P>
	And now with an impeached president again taking on issues  
bearing the GOP imprint. He is putting them in Democratic 
translations the Republicans will not buy but close enough that 
Clinton can say he is striving for civil bipartisanship. 
</P>
<P>
	Increased defense spending, the investment of Social Security  
funds in the stock market, a system of individual retirement 
accounts subsidized by the government. 
</P>
<P>
	That was Clinton aiming ideas toward the center, while he sought  
minimum-wage increases, targeted tax breaks, gun control and other 
steps looking toward his Democratic base. 
</P>
<P>
	All told, he had close to 60 proposals for legislation or budget  
increases that Congress would have to approve. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was just a wish list of a lot of things that people want to  
hear,'' said Sen. Orrin Hatch, a Utah Republican. He said it was no 
wonder the president's poll approval ratings bumped up overnight. 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, that capsule review could cover most State of the  
Union performances, not only those of this Democratic president. 
The annual ceremonial reports usually are lists immersed in 
rhetoric. They put the agenda of each president out front, although 
seldom to stay. Clinton's will not in the Republican Congress. But 
they deal with legislation piece by piece, away from the national 
stage in the confines of hearing rooms and drafting sessions. 
</P>
<P>
	Even when they are debated and voted in the House and Senate,  
the proceedings seldom command much attention outside the beltway. 
Legislating is dry, often dull work. 
</P>
<P>
	But on State of the Union night, the proposing of it is prime  
political theater, played to a vast television audience, perhaps 60 
million. And at this point, it makes no difference that most of 
what he seeks will be overhauled or blocked by the Republicans who 
run Congress. That will happen piecemeal, later. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's job approval ratings went up in the polls after his  
1998 State of the Union message -- a week after the Monica Lewinsky 
investigation was disclosed. 
</P>
<P>
	Richard Nixon's poll standing bumped up past the two-thirds  
level after his State of the Union address in 1974, in which he set 
his agenda, said there had been enough of Watergate and pledged not 
to resign, as he finally did. But there was more to Watergate, and 
as that scandal wore on, into impeachment proceedings, his job 
approval steadily sank, to 23 percent at the point he finally quit. 
</P>
<P>
	There has been no such erosion in Clinton's approval, despite  
months of disclosures about the Lewinsky affair, his confession to 
it and to his own dishonesty, and then impeachment. 
</P>
<P>
	They have stayed high, higher than those of Dwight D. Eisenhower  
and Ronald Reagan at this point in their two-term presidencies. 
</P>
<P>
	His approval went up again in polls released Wednesday by ABC,  
CBS and NBC, past 70 percent in the latter two. 
</P>
<P>
	And before that State of the Union boost, Americans were telling  
pollsters that they did not want Clinton convicted by the Senate 
and thus ousted as president. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite Republican insistence that the polls should not be a  
factor in impeachment decisions, the jurors are politicians, too. 
Some Republicans are worried about their footing on the limb of 
impeachment, after elections in which the case was an issue and the 
Democrats defied history to gain six House seats. 
</P>
<P>
	To expel a president with those ratings, when the voters want  
him to serve the final two years of his term, would risk worse GOP 
trouble at the polls in 2000. By any political logic, the case will 
end short of the 67 votes it would take to fire the president. 
</P>
<P>
	House Speaker Dennis Hastert doubts it will happen. ``I'm going  
to turn around and work with that president if he stays in office, 
and I presume he probably will,'' Hastert said on ABC. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, meanwhile, was on the road, advertising his State of  
the Union wares and joking about his duels with the Republican 
Congress. 
</P>
<P>
	Speaking in the arena of hockey's Buffalo Sabres, Clinton spoke  
of swatting away flying pucks like a goaltender in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just wish one day they would give me a mask and a few pads  
when I dodge that stuff,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Pitt Basketball Season in Shambles </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- The problems on the court are unpleasantly  
familiar, those off it are disturbing. Pitt's once-promising 
basketball team is in a chaotic freefall, its season in shambles 
and its coach's future in doubt. 
</P>
<P>
	Seven weeks after upsetting defending champion Kentucky to start  
6-0 and move into the Top 25, the Panthers (9-8) returned home 
Wednesday with two more losses, two fewer players and problems that 
threaten coach Ralph Willard's job. 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the Panthers finished a 86-65 loss Tuesday at  
Villanova, athletic director Steve Pederson was investigating 
freshman guard Fred Primus' arrest earlier that day on charges of 
grand theft and receiving stolen property. Primus was immediately 
kicked off the team. 
</P>
<P>
	The 19-year-old Primus was charged with stealing $2,200 worth of  
jewelry from a home in Malvern, a small community 25 miles west of 
Villanova. He was sent to Chester County prison on $10,000 bond, 
and a preliminary hearing was scheduled for Jan. 27. 
</P>
<P>
	An outstanding shooter who played last season at Notre Dame  
Academy in Middleburg, Va., Primus was averaging 4.4 points in 14 
games and was seen as a possible starter next season. 
</P>
<P>
	Walk-on guard Jason Boyd, who apparently hosted a get-together  
for some players Monday at his Malvern home, was dismissed for 
violating team rules. 
</P>
<P>
	``We took Jason home to see his family and for his family to see  
him, and that facilitated the other thing (the theft incident),'' 
Willard said. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting guard Jarrett Lockhart and forward Ricardo Greer also  
did not play for what Willard termed a separate violation of team 
policy. But Pederson said Wednesday they would play Saturday 
against Georgetown. 
</P>
<P>
	Greer and Lockhart were questioned about the theft, but were not  
detained and Malvern police said no more arrests were likely. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have tried to bring this incident to closure as soon as we  
had the facts to make those decisions,'' Pederson said. ``We have 
been informed by the appropriate investigative authorities that 
they have no plans to take action against anyone else in this 
matter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Because of the disciplinary action, Pitt had nine players in  
uniform Tuesday, and only seven played. Point guard Kellii Taylor 
has missed the last six games for what Willard termed ``personal 
reasons'' and reportedly is undergoing alcohol rehabilitation. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard's five-year tenure has been marked by a succession of  
underachieving teams, player defections and a 58-74 record that is 
the second worst by a Pitt coach this century. But this is the 
first time that Willard's players have been involved in incidents 
that tarnish the university's image. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's very sad,'' said Willard, who did not hold practice  
Wednesday. ``I never would have expected this. If you would have 
asked me 1,000 times if this could happen with this young man 
(Primus), I'd say no. It's a sad day for him. It's an embarrassment 
to our program and, really, to our kids.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pederson did not return phone calls Wednesday, but it is  
believed he will undertake a thorough review of Willard's job 
performance once the season ends. 
</P>
<P>
	The Panthers have had only one winning season -- 18-15 in 1996-97  
-- and have never reached the NCAA tournament since Willard's hiring 
in 1994. His predecessor, Paul Evans, made five NCAA appearances in 
eight years. 
</P>
<P>
	Willard, who signed a contract extension in 1997 after turning  
down an offer to become the Boston Celtics' general manager, said 
he must restore the confidence of a depleted team that is 1-6 in 
the Big East. 
</P>
<P>
	``Basketball is a little mirror of life sometimes,'' said  
Willard, whose team has lost eight of its last 11 games. 
``Sometimes life is not always fair, and it doesn't always do the 
things we expect it to do. The biggest thing is to keep these kids 
together and have them learn from experience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Until now, Willard's biggest problem at Pitt has been keeping  
the players he recruited. 
</P>
<P>
	Forwards Michael Gill, Andre Howard and Michael Shin left after  
one season. Promising 7-foot center Mark Blount turned pro after 
two seasons. Willie Cauley, an Evans holdover, and recruit Rashon 
Burno were academic casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	The departures have depleted Pitt's depth. Only six players saw  
extensive playing time last season, when, because of overtime 
games, guard Vonteego Cummings averaged 40.1 minutes per game.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Expands Shuster Probe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The House ethics committee has decided to  
investigate the House Transportation Committee chairman's campaign 
operations over the past six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Bud Shuster, R-Pa., already was under investigation for his  
professional and personal ties with Ann Eppard, a transportation 
lobbyist who was his chief of staff for 22 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to widen to probe was disclosed in a one-sentence  
statement in the ethics committee's 1997-98 wrap-up report, which 
said the panel will consider whether Shuster's last three campaigns 
broke any federal law or House rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster spokesman Scott Brenner said Tuesday that Shuster would  
have no comment beyond a pledge to cooperate. ``I look forward to 
being fully exonerated as I have complied with all House and 
Federal Election Commission rules,'' Shuster said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster is one of the most powerful lawmakers in Congress. Last  
year, he helped steer into law a $203 billion transportation 
measure containing several projects that benefit Ms. Eppard's 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Eppard is facing federal criminal charges in Boston. She  
denies charges that she embezzled $27,500 from Shuster's campaign 
committee and took $230,000 in illegal payments while she was his 
top aide to influence an $11 billion highway construction project 
in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster was named in some of the backup documents filed by  
prosecutors, but has not been charged with wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster, who employs Ms. Eppard as a fund-raiser and assistant  
treasurer, regularly spends campaign funds on meals, lodging and 
travel despite not having significant opposition. An Associated 
Press review found tens of thousands of dollars in spending at 
restaurants, hotels, Broadway theaters and liquor stores under the 
banner of ``political meetings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster has been criticized for combining fund-raising trips  
with official business.

<HEADLINE> Battery Blamed for Air Radar Outage </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SEATTLE (AP) -- Investigators say battery failure during a  
routine check of a backup power supply to a new air traffic control 
system disrupted air travel in the Northwest last week. 
</P>
<P>
	The failure caused the Federal Aviation Administration's new  
computer system to crash and delayed hundreds of flights affecting 
more than 8,000 passengers on Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were no reports of pilot complaints,'' nor of airplanes  
flying too close to each other, FAA spokesman Mitch Barker said 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	FAA Administrator Jane Garvey and Transportation Secretary  
Rodney Slater were scheduled today to dedicate the new technology, 
which is regarded as the most significant equipment upgrade to the 
nation's air traffic system in three decades. 
</P>
<P>
	The control center outside Seattle is the first of 21 regional  
air-traffic centers to use the FAA's new computer system, which 
lets each controller operate on a personal computer instead of 
being tied to a central system. The others are scheduled to go into 
operation by February 2000. 
</P>
<P>
	Friday's breakdown was caused by a flawed battery, not the new  
system. Barker said the battery failed for ``half a second'' after 
outside power was cut off, causing the computer system to crash 
before the emergency generators kicked in.

<HEADLINE> Alaska Gov. Proposes Budget Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JUNEAU, Alaska (AP) -- Alaska would impose an income tax and use  
billions from its massive oil-royalty savings account to pay for 
state services under a politically risky plan devised by Gov. Tony 
Knowles. 
</P>
<P>
	Low prices for the oil that provides most of the state's general  
revenue are expected to cause billion-dollar budget shortfalls in 
each of the next three years. Balancing the budget will require big 
infusions of cash from a reserve that could be exhausted in three 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, Alaskans pay no state income tax and no state sales  
tax while taking home an annual dividend from the $24 billion 
Alaska Permanent Fund, a payout that reached a record $1,540.88 
this year and is immensely popular with residents. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact is we have the wealth and resources to fix the  
problem of stabilizing our fiscal future,'' Knowles said in the 
prepared text for Wednesday's State of the State speech. ``The 
question is, do we have the wisdom and will to make the savings and 
investment necessary to achieve a sustainable balanced budget or 
will we continue to borrow from the future?'' 
</P>
<P>
	The plan would reinstate the income tax the Legislature junked  
after oil money from the Prudhoe Bay fields began flowing into the 
treasury more than two decades ago. The new tax would have a twist, 
falling most heavily on people who come to Alaska only to work 
before returning to homes in the Lower 48. 
</P>
<P>
	A family of four with a household income of less than $60,000  
would pay nothing, said David Ramseur, Knowles' deputy chief of 
staff. 
</P>
<P>
	The tax is expected to take in about $350 million, or about a  
third of the projected shortfall. 
</P>
<P>
	The part of the plan that could send nervous politicians  
screaming for the exits is the proposal to dip into the earnings of 
the sacrosanct permanent fund. The fund, created as a rainy-day 
account to guard against an inevitable decline in oil revenue, has 
become beloved by the people for its annual dividend. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowles, a Democrat, wants to take $4 billion of the paper  
profits the fund has rolled up in the booming stock market and beef 
up the state's cash reserve, which would then earn enough every 
year to bridge the remaining budget gap. 
</P>
<P>
	Knowles has promised to submit any plan to spend the permanent  
fund to a vote of the people. 
</P>
<P>
	The first hurdle the proposal must clear is the  
Republican-dominated Legislature, where any mention of an income 
tax is unpopular. Tapping the permanent fund is no more attractive, 
because elections for the House and Senate often turn on promises 
to guard the fund at all costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has unpalatable components,'' Senate President Drue Pearce,  
R-Anchorage, said of Knowles' plan. ``Any solution to the fiscal 
gap will not be adopted by this Legislature until we make further 
reductions to state spending.''

<HEADLINE> Hockey Medal Winners Need a Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Olympic gold medal hockey winners Tricia Dunn and  
Katie King are players without a home. 
</P>
<P>
	At rinks and gyms around the country, women hockey players  
hoping to compete for the U.S. team train five days a week 
following a regimen faxed to them -- their only link to a team 
without a training facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn and King say they are fortunate to drive from their New  
Hampshire homes to a workout facility in Burlington, where they 
work with Boston Bruins trainers Mike Boyle and Walter Norton. But 
they would prefer to have some teammates with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely frustrating,'' said King, of Salem, N.H. ``We  
don't want that much. We would like a place to skate with 19 other 
women -- even if we're based just around the same area -- maybe a 
place to live and some food.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So goes the dilemma of women hockey players, trying to find a  
home and a national team. 
</P>
<P>
	When they returned last winter from Nagano, Japan, as champions  
after playing in the first-ever women's hockey competition, King 
and Dunn didn't have high expectations. They wanted to play hockey 
and hoped for a place to skate. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk of a women's professional league never came to fruition.  
And unlike in Canada and Finland, there are no women's leagues for 
players in the United States after they leave college. 
</P>
<P>
	So Dunn and King, who recently co-wrote a book on hockey, ``Gold  
Medal Hockey for Women and Girls,'' were forced to join a men's 
league in Walpole to keep in shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a bummer for us who are out of school to play in  
a men's league to train,'' said Dunn, a Derry, N.H. resident. 
``It's a little discouraging, but we have to continue to go through 
the process until USA Hockey comes up with a team,'' referring to 
the organization that oversees the women's national team. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the national team members, which vary depending on the  
tournament, practice together only a few times a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Three Nations Cup last month in Finland, for example,  
players practiced together for the first time when they arrived for 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	And the national team will get together just two weeks before  
the World Championship in Finland in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Smith, head coach of the national and Olympic women's teams,  
doesn't think the situation will change soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that's a reality is there's not an economic  
demand for women hockey players once they've concluded their 
collegiate careers,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith cited several reasons for the lack of a high-level league,  
including the lack of players to choose from. Canada, for example, 
has about 50,000 players to feed its women's hockey league -- 
compared to about 25,000 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	And, as far as Smith is concerned, a gradual process is not all  
bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sometimes think organization is the ruination of the  
sports,'' Smith said. ``I think the people who want to play should 
play, and that was the beauty of our players. There was no question 
about their desire to play ice hockey. The challenge and love was 
so great that it made the challenge worthwhile.''

<HEADLINE> Duke May Move Home Game to Florida </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DURHAM, N.C. (AP) -- Duke officials are negotiating a plan to  
move the Blue Devils' 1999 home game against Florida State to 
Florida, according to the Seminoles' athletics director. 
</P>
<P>
	Duke sold its 1995 game with the Seminoles for a reported $1  
million, and afterward former Duke coach Fred Goldsmith said Duke 
would never move a home game. 
</P>
<P>
	But two months ago Goldsmith was fired and Duke athletics  
director Joe Alleva is discussing another move. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know they're discussing it,'' Florida State athletics  
director Dave Hart told the Herald-Sun of Durham on Tuesday. ``I 
don't know where they are in their discussions. It would be 
inappropriate for me to comment.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Neither Alleva nor new Duke football coach Carl Franks could be  
reached for comment. 
</P>
<P>
	The game, scheduled for Oct. 2 could be moved to the Alltel  
Stadium, formerly the Gator Bowl, in Jacksonville, Fla. 
</P>
<P>
	``I know that Joe Alleva wants to move the game,'' Rick Catlett,  
executive director of the Gator Bowl told The Florida Times-Union 
Tuesday. ``We're working with the Sports Authority and the 
Jacksonville Economic Development Council to formulate proposals 
for FSU to play here in Jacksonville this season and in the 
future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The 1995 Duke-Florida State and 1996 Wake Forest-Florida State  
games were bought out by the Citrus Bowl in Orlando, but neither 
game was a sellout. Citrus Bowl officials have reportedly dropped 
out of trying to stage the 1999 game. 
</P>
<P>
	Jacksonville, home of Florida State's second-largest alumni  
club, has been trying for years to bring the Seminoles to the 
73,000-seat Alltel Stadium. Florida plays its annual game against 
Georgia there. 
</P>
<P>
	Atlantic Coast Conference officials have tried to discourage  
schools from selling home games, but there is no rule against it. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was a feeling that it was unfair -- it gives that team an  
advantage to have five home games when its competitors only have 
four. But the ADs did not vote to disallow it,'' said ACC associate 
commissioner Tom Mickle.

<HEADLINE> Sprewell Will Find NY Is Tough Town </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Tough guy. Tougher town.  
</P>
<P>
	The first thing that comes to mind after hearing Latrell  
Sprewell will be playing in New York is that NBA principal David 
Stern's office is only a cab ride away. Good thing, too. Because 
the next thing that comes to mind is that Spree, if he's lucky 
enough to find a cab, will be dropping by often. 
</P>
<P>
	The rumor mill had it that only three clubs -- the Knicks, Miami  
Heat and Indiana Pacers -- made serious offers to Golden State for 
Sprewell. Some people hear that and assume the league's 26 other 
teams were either too principled or too scared to trade for a guy 
who learned everything he knows about dispute resolution from 
``Dirty Harry'' movies. 
</P>
<P>
	But those people assume wrong. The truth is all those other  
clubs thought Spree was still under house arrest, a small 
inconvenience a judge tagged him with after a traffic altercation 
last year. But the Knicks apparently did their homework. They 
arranged a secret meeting recently, and when Sprewell showed up no 
longer dragging a ball and chain behind him, they set out in 
earnest to get him. 
</P>
<P>
	New York's original offer was to send Chris Mills and Chris  
Childs to the Warriors, but after some haggling, they agreed to 
part with John Starks instead of Childs. Too bad. Imagine the scene 
if two matchheads like Sprewell and Starks wound up in the same 
backcourt and got into an argument over which one was going to 
inbound the ball. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, the chemistry problem in New York is far from solved.  
Coach Jeff Van Gundy may know a thing or two about chokeholds. But 
clamping one on Alonzo Mourning's ankle, which Van Gundy did during 
last May's Knicks-Heat playoff melee, doesn't land him in 
Sprewell's class. Spree does very few things like a real 
professional -- he undermines coaches and teammates, busts set plays 
on a whim and treats practice like it was a waste of his time -- but 
channeling anger is something he's very good at. 
</P>
<P>
	It's not that the kid is evil incarnate. But like a handful of  
talented young malcontents who have turned up in the NBA in recent 
years, he's developed a warped view of life. Sprewell has been 
accorded a status he doesn't deserve, paid a salary he has yet to 
earn, and tolerated even when he acts out. 
</P>
<P>
	He still doesn't get it. Anyone who doubts that has only to look  
at what Sprewell did after the NBA whacked him with a one-year 
suspension and arbitrator John Feerick cushioned the blow. First, 
Sprewell sued to get his lost wages back. About the time the judge 
in that case quit laughing long enough to dismiss it, he considered 
suing agent Arn Tellem, his staunchest defender, for failing to 
include a clause in his contract guaranteeing his salary no matter 
what. 
</P>
<P>
	We'll hear plenty in the next few weeks about rehabilitation,  
and we'll probably see Sprewell diving after loose balls, playing 
the best basketball of his career. On that score, there's no 
argument. He can play. Despite 14 months away from NBA-caliber 
competition, he'll give the Knicks 20-some points, a handful of 
rebounds and assists every night, and play defense like only a 
handful of guys in the league are capable of. 
</P>
<P>
	But in time, he'll give them plenty of heartache, too. It's a  
guarantee. Sprewell has run three coaches out of jobs -- four if you 
count hanging-on-by-his-fingernails P.J. Carlesimo. And he's driven 
off a few talented teammates -- Tom Gugliotta and Tim Hardaway -- as 
well. What's different is that in New York, he might have finally 
met his match. 
</P>
<P>
	Sprewell wasn't due many more chances wherever he wound up, but  
one might be all he gets in the Big Apple. The Knicks took a flyer 
on him, in part, because with Michael Jordan's departure and the 
season cut almost in half, their chance of winning an NBA 
championship might never be better. 
</P>
<P>
	Adding the three-time All-Star to a lineup that already includes  
Patrick Ewing, Allan Houston and Larry Johnson could be just enough 
to get New York past Miami and even Indiana, especially since 
Sprewell figures to match up very well against Reggie Miller. 
</P>
<P>
	The trick, of course, is how to keep Sprewell from  
self-destructing along the way. And make no mistake: It won't be 
easy. Sprewell's teammates will only cut him so much slack. He will 
have the NBA's toughest fans on his back every time he sets foot on 
the floor at Madison Square Garden. The next morning, his grades 
will be splashed on the back pages of the toughest newspapers in 
the country. 
</P>
<P>
	There were a few other places Sprewell could have wound up in,  
but none of them would have schooled him the way New York will. 
It's one instance where the punishment might actually fit the 
crime. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Jimmy Stewart Ranch To Be Sold </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SOUTH KONA, Hawaii (AP) -- The late Jimmy Stewart's Hawaii cattle  
ranch has been sold to a California doctor for $3.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The 1,500-acre Hoomau Ranch, which the Academy Award-winning  
actor bought in 1958, was sold to Dr. Thomas Atwood. The deal was 
to be closed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The property is still a working ranch with Black Angus cattle  
and Atwood plans to maintain it, said John Michael White, president 
of Hawaii Land Company, which represents the Stewart family. 
</P>
<P>
	``The ranch was loved by Stewart,'' White said. ``But the family  
felt they couldn't spend enough time here to manage the property.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Stewart died in July 1997. He and his wife, Gloria, honeymooned  
in Hawaii in 1949 and returned often to the islands.

<HEADLINE> NASA Launch of X-ray Scope Delayed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAPE CANAVERAL, Fla. (AP) -- NASA's newest and most powerful  
X-ray telescope has been grounded for weeks and perhaps months 
because of bad circuit boards. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chandra X-ray Observatory was to have soared aboard space  
shuttle Columbia on April 8. Now it won't fly until mid-May or even 
summer, NASA said Wednesday, a delay that will add millions of 
dollars to the $1.5 billion project. 
</P>
<P>
	The flawed circuit boards are in the telescope's crucial command  
and data unit and must be replaced. Copper plating needed for 
electrical conductivity somehow came off. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the latest in a series of setbacks for the X-ray telescope,  
a Hubble-caliber instrument that should have rocketed into orbit 
last summer but was hampered by software trouble and other 
problems. 
</P>
<P>
	NASA is being extra cautious with Chandra for fear of another  
Hubble-type debacle. The Hubble Space Telescope was launched in 
1990 with a defective mirror that had to be fixed by spacewalking 
astronauts. 
</P>
<P>
	``To us, failure is not an option,'' said Kenneth Ledbetter,  
director of development for NASA's space science office. ``Unlike 
Hubble, it's not serviceable. It goes into a very high orbit and 
will not be reachable with the shuttle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chandra, in development since the 1970s, is meant to detect  
faint sources of cosmic X-rays, such as quasars, exploded stars and 
possibly black holes. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, NASA has delayed the launch by five weeks to May 13,  
the same day Discovery is supposed to lift off with equipment for 
the new international space station. NASA said it's too soon to 
know which flight will go first. 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope's 129 circuit boards which were made by an  
Albuquerque, N.M., company that has since been acquired by BF 
Goodrich. So far, at least two boards are believed to have 
problems. At worst, 22 boards will need to be replaced, which could 
mean a delay of several months, Ledbetter said. 
</P>
<P>
	The telescope-delivery flight will be the first NASA mission  
commanded by a woman, Eileen Collins.

<HEADLINE> GOP Governors Rap Clinton Address </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The State of the Union address delivered by  
the president was ``quintessentially Bill Clinton,'' a polished 
speech that promised lots but set unrealistic expectations, a group 
of Republican governors said today. 
</P>
<P>
	The speech was a ``candy store'' for lawmakers that offered  
``caramels for conservatives,'' in the form of education reform, 
and ``lemon drops for liberals,'' with a pledge to increase the 
minimum wage, said Oklahoma Gov. Frank Keating, chairman of the 
Republican Governors Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``There was something for everyone. The only person who was  
missing was Michael Jordan,'' Keating said during a conference call 
with two other governors. 
</P>
<P>
	Noticeably missing from the president's address was a tax cut,  
said Gov. Jim Geringer of Wyoming. 
</P>
<P>
	``Why not give the money back to the people that earned it? Put  
the money back in their pocket,'' he said. ``The greatest economic 
recoveries we've seen in America are when you give it back to the 
people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Ed Schafer of North Dakota called the president a ``great  
deliverer -- he said something for everyone'' in his address. 
</P>
<P>
	But Clinton's speech also signaled an attempt to return the  
country to ``the era of big government,'' Schafer said. 
</P>
<P>
	``More programs, more bureaucracy, more expenditures -- binding  
our future generations to government costs and that is the 
most-focused thing that we saw come from the president's speech,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The governors also felt that Clinton should have acknowledged  
the role that Republicans played in balancing the budget and 
reforming welfare laws. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think the president could have been much more olive branch  
with the Republicans,'' Keating said.

<HEADLINE> Amtrak To Take On Some Freight </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Amtrak's passenger trains are going into the  
freight business -- at least in a limited way. 
</P>
<P>
	The national passenger railroad will carry urgent packages, pull  
refrigerated cars and move freight under new business partnerships 
signed Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Amtrak officials said passenger travel will always be their  
primary mission. But four new partnerships are expected to bring in 
more than $20 million a year in additional income -- a welcome 
addition with Congress' insisting the railroad become financially 
self-sufficient by the end of 2002. 
</P>
<P>
	The new deals included:  
</P>
<P>
	-- An agreement with Burlington Northern Santa Fe that will have  
Amtrak provide transportation for United Parcel Service and four 
other carriers between Kansas City and Albuquerque on Amtrak's 
Southwest Chief. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Expansion of an existing arrangement with the U. S. Postal  
Service to move mail between Philadelphia and Springfield, Mass. in 
the East and Los Angeles and Oakland, Calif. in the West via 
Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Entering the refrigerated-carload business in a partnership  
with ExpressTrak Inc. of Michigan. The primary routes served will 
be between California and the Northeast, and between California and 
Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Introduction in February of Amtrak's ``Premium Package  
Express'' service in conjunction with Dynamex, a same-day delivery 
service. The service will move packages on Amtrak's Metroliners 
between New York City and Washington, D.C. 
</P>
<P>
	In addition, a fifth new agreement will save an estimated $28  
million over five years by turning over food service at 11 Amtrak 
commissaries to Dobbs International Services. Food served on trains 
is prepared at the commissaries. 
</P>
<P>
	Displaced commissary employees will receive new jobs at Amtrak  
or compensation packages, the railroad said.

<HEADLINE> High Stock Prices Worry Greenspan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While calling the economy's current  
performance ``outstanding,'' Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan expressed worries today that the high-flying stock market 
could be headed for a tumble that could spell serious trouble down 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also criticized a key part of President Clinton's  
Social Security rescue plan, saying the government could damage the 
economy by investing huge sums of money in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	None of Greenspan's comments today suggested to analysts that  
the Fed would be changing interest rates any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But his expressions of concern about the altitude of the stock  
market gave support to views that the central bank is unlikely to 
rush to cut rates further unless global turmoil sends markets into 
a severe downturn such as occurred last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	At midday, the Dow Jones average was up 75 points.  
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, an influential voice Congress often turns to on  
economic matters, said he supports Clinton's major idea to put 62 
percent of the government's budget surpluses into Social Security's 
cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	But he expressed serious reservations about a part of Clinton's  
plan that would allow a government board to direct about a quarter 
of those savings into stock market investments. It is unlikely that 
these investments could be insulated from political considerations, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, Greenspan said it is more important to use budget  
surpluses to reduce the federal debt as a way of boosting the 
national savings rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's channeling trillions of dollars over the years  
into U.S. companies would eventually lower America's productivity 
rates, the key to rising standards of living, because of pressures 
to help less efficient industries rather than letting market forces 
decide what companies to fund, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe that it is politically feasible to insulate  
such huge funds from government direction,'' Greenspan told the 
House Ways and Means Committee. ``I am fearful that we would use 
those assets in a way that would create a lower rate of return for 
social Security recipients and even greater concern it would create 
sub-optimal use of capital and a lower standard of living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks today on the level of the stock market were  
his most extensive worrying aloud about whether prices had risen 
too high since his famous comments about ``irrational exuberance'' 
in December 1996, when the Dow Jones industrial average was nearly 
3,000 points lower than it is today. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan noted that stocks have been climbing into record  
territory this year and called this fact unusual, given that 
corporate profits, the underpinning of stock prices, have been 
weaker. 
</P>
<P>
	He said this weakness in profits raised the ``possibility that  
the recent performance of the equity markets will have difficulty 
in being sustained. The level of equity prices would appear to 
envision substantially greater growth of profits than has been 
experienced of late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said a tumble in stock prices could quickly over into  
the real economy through what economists call the ``wealth 
effect,'' the fact that consumers spend more when their net worth 
is rising and cut back when they face reversals. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been robust consumer spending that in large part has kept  
the U.S. economy steaming ahead in the face of the severe global 
turmoil that began in Asia in mid-1977. 
</P>
<P>
	``A decline in equity (stock) values, especially a severe one,  
could lead to a considerable weakening of consumer demand,'' 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan stressed today that the Fed's actions last year were  
not prompted by a desire to protect investors from a drop in stock 
prices, but rather to protect the overall economy from a downturn 
caused by a cut in consumer spending that could result from 
tumbling markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Greenspan said some slowing in the U.S. economy this  
year would be desirable, given the rapid pace of recent growth that 
has pushed the nation's unemployment rate to a three-decade low. 
</P>
<P>
	The global economic crisis threatened to flare anew last week  
when Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, was forced to 
devalue its currency. ``So far, markets seem to have reacted 
reasonably well to the decisions by the Brazilian authorities to 
float their currency and redouble efforts at fiscal discipline,'' 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economists are looking for growth to slow markedly in 1999  
as the drag from foreign turmoil finally begins to bite. But the 
slowdown has yet to occur and for that reason, economists don't 
believe the Fed will move anytime soon to cut rates.

<HEADLINE> Dollar Down Vs. Yen; Up Vs. Euro </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The dollar fell against the yen Wednesday as  
Japanese companies brought yen back into the country ahead of the 
end of their fiscal year and as President Clinton raised the 
profile of a major trade dispute. 
</P>
<P>
	Otherwise, the dollar rose against the euro and most other major  
currencies as Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan gave the U.S. 
economy a thumbs-up. 
</P>
<P>
	The dollar fell to 112.85 yen in late New York trading, down  
from 113.49 late Tuesday. The euro was quoted at $1.1555, falling 
from $1.1614 late Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Japanese corporations typically sell U.S. assets and bring home  
yen to shore up their balance sheets ahead of the end of Japan's 
fiscal year on March 31. Currency traders attributed the trend as 
an ongoing seasonal factor in the dollar's fall against the yen. 
</P>
<P>
	In another factor pressuring the yen higher, President Clinton,  
in his State of the Union address Tuesday night, threatened Japan 
if it continued to export steel to U.S. markets well below 
production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's raised to a high political level,'' said Hillel Waxman,  
chief foreign exchange dealer at Bank Leumi USA. ``Now he's put it 
on the national agenda.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Trade disputes with Japan often result in upward pressure on the  
yen since currency traders believe that U.S. financial authorities 
are willing to tolerate a stronger yen as a way to make Japanese 
exports less competitive on world markets. 
</P>
<P>
	Overall steel imports hit record levels last year. At least  
10,000 layoffs and bankruptcies at U.S. steel companies are blamed 
on those imports. The industry, from steel producers to 
steelworkers, say they cannot compete. 
</P>
<P>
	In Washington Wednesday, thousands of steelworkers rallied at  
the Capitol to protest the rising imports. Inside, lawmakers from 
steel-producing states were offering legislation to help the 
industry. 
</P>
<P>
	In other markets, the dollar was quoted at 1.3883 Swiss francs,  
up from 1.3753 Tuesday, and 1.5210 Canadian dollars, down from 
1.5306. The British pound fell to $1.6453 from $1.6554. 
</P>
<P>
	Currencies of the 11 countries participating in the euro are no  
longer traded separately and are tied to the euro by a fixed rate. 
Based on Monday's euro rate, the dollar was worth: 1.6926 German 
marks, up from 1.6841; 5.6754 French francs, up from 5.6465; and 
1,675.04 Italian lire, up from 1,666.67.

<HEADLINE> Browns Give Palmer Second Interview </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CLEVELAND (AP) -- Running out of time and head coaching  
candidates by the day, the Cleveland Browns brought Chris Palmer in 
for a second interview on Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Palmer, the offensive coordinator for the Jacksonville Jaguars,  
spent most of the day visiting with Browns president Carmen Policy, 
football operations director Dwight Clark and Cleveland owner Al 
Lerner at Lerner's office in suburban Beechwood. 
</P>
<P>
	If the length of the meeting means anything, then it appears the  
Browns may have finally found their man after a scrambled search. 
</P>
<P>
	The 49-year-old Palmer had impressed Policy in his initial  
interview last week, but did not get to meet with Lerner, who was 
out of town at the time. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, Policy had said that no coach would be hired by the  
Browns ``without meeting with and having a pretty good serious 
sitdown with Al Lerner.'' Lerner, a local billionaire banker, 
bought the Browns last summer for $530 million. 
</P>
<P>
	With the expansion draft less than three weeks away, the Browns  
realize they need to put their coaching search behind them. Policy 
had hoped to hire Minnesota offensive coordinator Brian Billick but 
dropped him as a candidate on Monday when Billick decided to follow 
through with a job interview with the Baltimore Ravens. 
</P>
<P>
	Billick signed a six-year, $9 million contract with the Ravens  
on Tuesday, leaving the Browns with three coaches they had 
interviewed to choose from: Palmer, Atlanta offensive line coach 
Art Shell and Oakland defensive coordinator Willie Shaw.

</P>
<P>
	The merger aims to keep the state-owned telecoms operations

<P>
	STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) -- The state telephone companies of Sweden  
and Norway on Wednesday announced plans to merge and to sell 
one-third of the merged company's shares on the open market.

<HEADLINE> Books &AMP; Authors: Jerry Bledsoe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Jerry Bledsoe is on a roll. A TV movie  
based on his ``Before He Wakes'' was telecast last month. His novel 
``The Angel Doll'' was optioned to a film studio. And now there's 
``Death Sentence,'' Bledsoe's latest true-crime story. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the compelling tale of Velma Barfield, the North Carolina  
grandmother who murdered four people with arsenic and in 1984 
became the first woman executed in the United States since 1962 
(two other women since have been put to death). 
</P>
<P>
	The 57-year-old ex-newspaperman is considered one of the top  
true-crime writers. His first major success was ``Bitter Blood,'' a 
1989 story about three wealthy families connected by marriage and 
nine murders. It became a 1994 made-for-TV movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Bledsoe's ``Death Sentence'' goes beyond his earlier  
crime-and-punishment sagas to include the themes of personal 
redemption and the death penalty's politics and morality. A former 
believer in capital punishment as ``society's self-defense,'' 
Bledsoe isn't so sure after writing ``Death Sentence'' (E.P. 
Dutton, 400 pages, $24.95). 
</P>
<P>
	Barfield was arrested in March 1978 for the arsenic murder of  
her fiance, Stuart Taylor. Her son, Ronnie Burke, turned her in. 
</P>
<P>
	Taylor's death turned out to be just the tip of the iceberg. In  
the months that followed, she admitted to three other fatal 
poisonings -- her mother's death in 1974 and two murders in 1977 
while working as a caregiver. ``I didn't mean to kill them, only to 
make them sick,'' she told her lawyer plaintively. 
</P>
<P>
	She killed to conceal the checks she forged for the painkillers  
and tranquilizers to which she had become addicted, wrote Bledsoe, 
and she killed because of petty pique. 
</P>
<P>
	Later, she admitted to Ronnie that she set the 1969 fire that  
killed his father, her first husband. 
</P>
<P>
	She was convicted of Taylor's death and sentenced to die. In  
November 1984, at age 52, Barfield was executed by lethal injection 
in Raleigh, wearing pink pajamas embroidered with flowers. 
</P>
<P>
	While Barfield's trial, lengthy appeals and execution frame the  
story, Barfield's profound personality change in jail, where she 
found religion and weaned herself from pills, is the fulcrum. 
</P>
<P>
	Bledsoe said Barfield's epiphany occurred in the Robeson County  
jail one Saturday night as she listened to a gospel music station a 
guard had tuned in. She was struck hard by the words, ``Yes, 
somebody loves you and his name is Jesus! He loves you tonight no 
matter where you are or what you've done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Her anger and depression began to lift, replaced by a growing  
inner peace, wrote Bledsoe. But she kept her evangelism a secret 
for months, even during her trial, when she might have used it to 
argue for a lighter sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	In time, people started noticing the new Velma. She began  
ministering to fellow prisoners, many of whom came to call her 
``Sweet Velma.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bledsoe admits to being skeptical at first about her  
transformation. 
</P>
<P>
	``The question is: Is it possible for a sociopath to be  
redeemed, someone whose conscience shut down at some point back in 
life, who essentially deals only with the self?'' he says. 
</P>
<P>
	In Barfield's case, Bledsoe says, yes. He points to her  
dedicated study of the Bible, the seemingly genuine remorse she 
later expressed to her victims' families, and the uplifting effect 
she had on others. Former inmates wrote her letters of gratitude. 
</P>
<P>
	``They would write saying, `I don't deserve to know somebody as  
good as you. I know what way I have to go now.' Over and over, 
letters like that by unsolicited people who had gone home after 
knowing her in prison,'' Bledsoe says. 
</P>
<P>
	As her execution date neared, Barfield's story was told on the  
front pages of national newspapers and on network television. 
Evangelist Billy Graham, whose wife Ruth had exchanged letters with 
Barfield for three years, telephoned her and promised to pray for 
her. But when the end finally came, it was Barfield who gave 
encouragement. 
</P>
<P>
	``She faced this with astounding peace and was comforting to  
people,'' Bledsoe says. 
</P>
<P>
	Barfield's son persuaded Bledsoe to write the book. Still  
tormented years later by his mother's actions and his role in her 
arrest, he approached Bledsoe at a book signing in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	``I realized it had the good, strong family story that I  
require,'' Bledsoe says. ``It is about as strong a mother-son story 
as I have encountered.''

<HEADLINE> 92 Cuban Refugees Land in Fla. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- The recent surge in Cuban and Haitian refugees  
wading ashore in south Florida will continue as long as good 
weather holds, authorities said. 
</P>
<P>
	Ninety-two refugees landed over the three-day weekend from Key  
West to Palm Beach, 120 miles farther north. Since the start of the 
month, more than 150 have been picked up by U.S. Border Patrol 
agents. 
</P>
<P>
	``It seems simplistic, but watch the Weather Channel,'' said Dan  
Geoghegan, assistant chief for the patrol's Miami region. ``If the 
seas are 2 or 3 feet and the weather's 75 degrees, we'll probably 
have more landings.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Two people were arrested and a boat was seized late Monday in  
Key West on suspicion of alien smuggling. Coast Guard agents also 
intercepted vessels carrying 14 Haitian refugees Monday night and 
eight Cubans the night before. 
</P>
<P>
	``Gone are the days of the rafter,'' Geoghegan said. ``These  
guys now are smuggled by professional alien smugglers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	In 1995, the United States halted a decades-old policy of  
accepting most Cuban refugees rescued at sea. That ended a mass 
exodus of refugees who set out in makeshift vessels to cross the 90 
miles separating Cuba and Key West. 
</P>
<P>
	But authorities still accept refugees who make it to U.S. soil,  
which has created a burgeoning industry for smugglers who charge 
refugees up to $8,000 and have boats that can outrun Coast Guard 
patrols. 
</P>
<P>
	In the 12 months ending in September 1998, Border Patrol agents  
picked up about 1,200 refugees. They are on pace to double that 
amount, detaining 600 since October. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a busy summer, a busy fall, a busy Christmas,'' said  
Geoghegan, noting that the only lull came when a cold front passed 
through in early January. ``Except for a 10-day spell, it's been 
busy.''

	White House Attacks House Charges  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House special counsel Gregory Craig  
opened a second day of defense arguments in President Clinton's 
impeachment trial by urging senators to read the grand jury 
testimony in the Monica Lewinsky investigation and ``see the 
president is truthful.'' He dismissed the charge that Clinton lied 
before a grand jury as nothing more than ``arguments over 
semantics.'' Later, White House Deputy Counsel Cheryl Mills 
targeted the House prosecutors' argument that Clinton must be 
removed to uphold ``the rule of law.'' One prominent Republican, 
former presidential candidate Pat Robertson, said today that 
Clinton had ``hit a home run'' in his State of the Union speech, 
dashing any possibility that he would be convicted. 

</P>
<P>
	Obstacles for Social Security Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
swiftly joined congressional Republicans in shooting down the most 
controversial part of President Clinton's Social Security plan, 
saying the government should not invest hundreds of billions of 
dollars in the stock market. ``I do not believe it is politically 
feasible to insulate such huge funds'' from political interference, 
Greenspan said. He added, however, that he enthusiastically 
supports most of Clinton's plan, which would use 62 percent of 
government surpluses over the next 15 years to bolster Social 
Security's cash reserves. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Takes Message on the Road  
</P>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton tested his State of the  
Union proposals for Social Security, education and other 
initiatives with the public today, speaking to what the White House 
labeled as the largest U.S. crowd to greet him since his 1996 
campaign. Stressing the need to use the federal budget surplus to 
shore up Social Security, he told nearly 22,000 people at Marine 
Midland Arena he is ready for a major clash with congressional 
Republicans who want a broad tax cut. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Warns Kosovo Rebels, Serbs  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rebels fighting for Kosovo's independence from  
Serbia should not expect NATO to do their bidding on the 
battlefield, Defense Secretary William Cohen said today. While NATO 
shortened pilots' readiness time for airstrikes to 48 hours, Cohen 
said, ``We don't intend to be an air force for'' the Kosovo 
Liberation Army.'' He noted that both parties to last October's 
cease-fire agreement -- Serb forces and ethnic Albanians -- must stop 
violating it. Serb police launched a new operation today that 
killed at least two rebels and left a Serb mother and her two 
children injured. 

</P>
<P>
	U.S. Missile Defense Six Years Away  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Clinton administration said today it  
probably will take two years longer than previously believed to 
build a defense against a long-range missile attack on the United 
States. But, it added, the need for such a defense system is 
greater than ever. Defense Secretary William Cohen noted that North 
Korea shocked the world last year by test-firing a medium-range 
ballistic missile over Japan. The target date for deploying the 
estimated $10.5 billion system was moved from 2003 to 2005, Cohen 
said. 

</P>
<P>
	Meat Inspectors Find Safety Lapses  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A new food inspection program for meat and  
poultry plants is so loosely regulated that meat is sometimes 
spotted with chipped paint, shards of metal and even maggots, 
federal inspectors alleged today. The National Joint Council of 
Food Inspection Locals said the government's new Hazard Analysis 
Critical Control Point program too often lets the meat industry 
regulate itself, forcing inspectors to sit on the sidelines. 
Already in use in the country's 300 largest processing plants, 
nearly 3,000 smaller plants are scheduled to begin using the 
program on Monday. 

</P>
<P>
	Fiber Doesn't Reduce Colon Cancer  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Contradicting years of dietary wisdom, a large  
new study found no evidence that eating lots of high-fiber foods 
like bran, beans and whole wheat bread does anything to lower the 
risk of colon cancer. But previous studies also have found that a 
diet rich in fruits, vegetables and whole grains has many other 
health benefits. The colon cancer study is published in tomorrow's 
New England Journal of Medicine. 

</P>
<P>
	Blue Chips End Lower; Dow Down 19.31  
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Investors sold holdings to lock in profits  
today, pushing the Dow industrials down 19.31 to 9,335.91. On the 
NYSE, losers led gainers 1,593-1,476. The Nasdaq rose 7.41 to 
2,415.58, another record. 

</P>
<P>
	Walker Is New Northwestern FB Coach  
</P>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- Randy Walker, head coach the last nine  
seasons at Miami of Ohio, will be the Northwestern Wildcats' new 
football coach. He replaces Gary Barnett, who earlier today was 
hired as Colorado's new coach. Walker was 59-35-5 at Miami, 
including a 10-1 mark last season.

<HEADLINE> $470 Million Shipbuilding Merger Completed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEWPORT NEWS, Va. (AP) -- A $470 million merger will combine  
Newport News Shipbuilding and Avondale Industries and create a 
company that can design, build and maintain every type of warship 
in the Navy fleet. 
</P>
<P>
	The combined company will be known as Newport News Avondale  
Industries and will have almost 24,000 employees. It will have 
estimated 1999 revenues of $2.6 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	Byron Callan, a shipbuilding industry analyst at Merrill Lynch  
in New York, said the merger announced Tuesday reflects a trend 
that is likely to continue among ship construction companies. 
</P>
<P>
	``This has been an ongoing process,'' said Callan. ``... It  
looks like you're going to have two yards, possibly three, when all 
is said and done.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The transaction approved by the boards of directors of the two  
companies will give Avondale shareholders 1.196 shares of Newport 
News stock for each share of Avondale stock. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger is subject to approval by the shareholders of both  
companies and by federal regulators. The deal is expected to close 
in the second quarter of 1999. 
</P>
<P>
	Newport News Shipbuilding builds and maintains all of the Navy's  
aircraft carriers and many of its submarines.The New Orleans-based 
Avondale Industries builds many Navy surface warships. 
</P>
<P>
	The new company's chief competitors will be General Dynamics,  
which owns Electric Boat, Bath Iron Works and National Steel and 
Shipbuilding Co., and Litton Industries, parent of Ingalls 
Shipbuilding. 
</P>
<P>
	William P. Fricks, chairman and chief executive officer of  
Newport News Shipbuilding, noted that the combined company will 
have operations on the East, West and Gulf coasts. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our geographic diversity enhances the combined company's  
ability to deliver high-quality, cost-effective fleet maintenance 
services to the U.S. Navy, and arguably makes us the most capable 
and flexible shipbuilder in the nation,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Fricks will become chairman and chief executive in the new  
company, and Albert L. Bossier Jr., will serve as vice chairman 
while remaining president and chief executive of Avondale. 
</P>
<P>
	Fricks said the new company will start with a $6 billion backlog  
in contract work. The total includes more than $2.5 billion for 
aircraft carrier construction, refueling and maintenance through 
2002. Submarine construction programs represent nearly $1 billion, 
and the first two ships of a new class of amphibious assault ships 
represent $2 billion.

<HEADLINE> McDyess Chooses Nuggets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- Antonio McDyess has decided to sign with the  
Denver Nuggets, the team that traded him to Phoenix just 15 months 
ago, his agent said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess had narrowed his choices to re-signing with the Suns or  
going back to Denver, and after several delays finally chose the 
Nuggets, even though it meant less money than Phoenix could offer 
him. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was a real close call,'' said McDyess' agent, James Bryant.  
``It came down to a question of do you want to inherit a contender 
or do you want to build one? Phoenix is a great franchise, but 
Denver is doing a lot of exciting things that haven't come out 
yet.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns, stung that McDyess would abandon them to return to  
such a struggling franchise, immediately turned their attention to 
signing free agent Tom Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	Phoenix can make moves that would put them about $8 million  
under the salary cap, Suns general manager Bryan Colangelo said. 
That would mean the Suns could not offer Gugliotta the maximum $9 
million, but could give him a clause to opt out of his deal after 
five years and get a big raise. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're not going to be specific about any names, but we expect  
to have some people on the horn, possibly in town, over the next 
day or two,'' Suns owner Jerry Colangelo said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess is expected to sign a contract with Denver as soon as  
the lockout officially ends at 2 p.m. EST on Thursday. While 
Phoenix would have given him a seven-year, $86.5 million contract, 
Denver can offer a maximum of $67 million over six year. However, 
he will get an opt-out clause that would allow him to sign a bigger 
deal after five years. 
</P>
<P>
	``Antonio has a chance to be the main guy there,'' Bryant said.  
``And as you know, he played about 24 minutes per game in Phoenix 
last year and will play more than 40 a game in Denver. This is a 
player they will build a franchise around.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Actually, McDyess averaged 30 minutes per game, and Suns coach  
Danny Ainge said McDyess never complained about playing time. 
</P>
<P>
	``Antonio had every opportunity to tell me that during the  
course of the year,'' Ainge said. ``He never did. All he ever said 
to me was `I wish I was playing better.' We never had any inkling 
he was dissatisfied with his role. ... By giving him the maximum 
proposal of $86 million and our offense pretty much being designed 
around Jason Kidd and Antonio McDyess is evidence of what we felt 
about Antonio and his future.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess, 24, was acquired by Phoenix in a three-team trade in  
October 1997. The Suns sent Wesley Person and Tony Dumas to 
Cleveland, and gave Denver two first-round draft picks, two 
second-round picks and an undisclosed amount of cash. Cleveland 
also sent a first-round pick to Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	Jerry Colangelo said he spoke with McDyess at length Tuesday  
night. 
</P>
<P>
	``I had a very in-depth conversation with him and was told by  
him that he would get back to me at noon today,'' Colangelo said. 
``That did not happen. I'm personally disappointed that it turned 
out the way it did. He's a good young man. I think he's a guy of 
high character. ...This is not about reasoning or trying to figure 
out why. It just is. It just flat out is. Now we move on.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo has said he and McDyess' agent at the time, Arn  
Tellem, were in agreement that the young forward would get a big 
contract when his existing deal expired at the end of the 1997-98 
season. 
</P>
<P>
	``You have to take risks, calculated risks, because you'll never  
succeed if you're not willing to fail,'' Jerry Colangelo said. 
``And the fact is when we made the decision to go after Antonio 
McDyess there was some risk, and definitely only calculated risk. 
Those of you who know me would understand we wouldn't go into that 
blindly. We had some kind of understanding that he was interested 
in coming and there would not be a problem in him remaining.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NBA lockout ruined that plan, and the new rules limit how  
much the Suns could give. Meanwhile, McDyess fired Tellem and 
replaced him with Bryant and Tony Dutt. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess was considering Denver because he likes Dan Issel, the  
former Nuggets coach hired as general manager last March, and has 
many friends in that city. He also is good friends with Denver 
guard Nick Van Exel, who has been at McDyess' Houston home in 
recent days trying to persuade him to sign with the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns, meanwhile, say they had trouble getting reliable  
information from Bryant and Dutt. 
</P>
<P>
	``Yes, we did get return phone calls,'' Ainge told reporters,  
``but we did get more information from you people and from other 
agents than we did from Antonio's camp.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess averaged 15.1 points and 7.6 rebounds in 81 games for  
the Suns last season, and was especially strong down the stretch, 
scoring a career-high 37 against the Los Angeles Lakers.

<HEADLINE> Northwestern Women's Coach Retiring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- On the same day Northwestern lost its  
football coach, the Big Ten university announced that women's 
basketball coach Don Perrelli will retire at the end of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrelli has led the Wildcats to six postseason appearances and  
five 20-victory seasons. 
</P>
<P>
	``In his 15 years at Northwestern he has come to embody the  
combination of excellence in athletics and academics to which we 
all strive. We will miss him greatly,'' Northwestern athletic 
director Rick Taylor said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	His record is 422-244 at Northwestern, St. John's and Southern  
Connecticut State, where he graduated in 1961. 
</P>
<P>
	Perrelli said he announced his decision now so the school will  
have plenty of time to find a replacement. 
</P>
<P>
	Also on Wednesday, Northwestern lost Gary Barnett to Colorado  
and named Miami of Ohio coach Randy Walker, a former Wildcats 
assistant, as its new football coach.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Defense Excerpts-3 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	``There is no dispute about the critical facts that Ms. Lewinsky  
was young, very young, too young when she got involved with 
President Clinton. But her age didn't change between November 1995 
and January 1996. Her birthday is in July. She was 22 years old in 
November and 22 years old in January, despite the fact that every 
manager persists in stating, erroneously -- not perjuriously, 
erroneously -- that she was 21 years old when she first became 
involved with the president.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``How can you accept the argument of the House managers that the  
president should be removed from office because his definition, 
which is the dictionary definition, does not comport with theirs?'' 
-- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The true nub of the managers' allegation that the president  
committed perjury is that he described some of the contact one way, 
and she described it another. Not surprisingly, the managers choose 
to believe Ms. Lewinsky's description of these events. 
</P>
<P>
	``And so, even in the absence of any evidence to the contrary,  
other than Ms. Lewinsky's own recollection of these events, the 
managers have concluded that the president lied under oath about 
the details of his sexual activity, that he somehow shortchanged 
the grand jury and should be removed from office.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The possibility that the question of whether the president of  
the United States should be removed from his office, the fact that 
that might hinge on whether you believe him or her on this issue, 
is a staggering thought.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president acknowledged to the grand jury the existence of  
an improper intimate relationship with Monica Lewinsky but argued 
with the prosecutors questioning him that his acknowledged conduct 
was not a sexual relationship as he understood the definition of 
that term being used in the Jones deposition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Engaging in such a debate, whether wise or wise politically,  
simply does not form the basis for a perjury prosecution. Indeed, 
in the end, the entire basis for a grand jury perjury prosecution 
comes down to Monica Lewinsky's assertion that there was a 
reciprocal nature to their relationship and that the president 
touched her private parts with the intent to arouse or gratify her, 
and the president's denial that he did so.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In fact, President Clinton did not ratify, he did not reaffirm  
his Jones testimony when he testified before the grand jury, and 
you will see that when you read the transcript of his testimony. 
Quite the contrary is true. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at that transcript carefully, you'll find that  
without admitting wrongdoing, the president elaborated, he 
modified, he amended and he clarified his testimony in Jones.'' -- 
Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If you look at the president's grand jury testimony, you will  
see that he provided much more complete and much more accurate, 
much more reliable testimony about many of the topics covered in 
Jones. And the notion that he reaffirmed, confirmed or ratified his 
Jones testimony is just unsupported by the evidence. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be astonishing to think that the Senate would  
conclude that the president should be removed from office because 
in the grand jury he gave voice to a legal opinion and stated his 
own personal belief that his testimony in the Jones deposition did 
not break the law. I submit to you that if that was the case, the 
Office of the Independent Counsel would have included that in the 
referral, and they did not.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Let me just say right now: None of the rest of the allegations  
that we're going to be discussing in the Article that we're talking 
about today are included in the Starr referral. The rest are 
entirely the product of the managers.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The charge is that the president misled the grand jury when he  
said that he wasn't paying attention. While the videotape shows 
that the president was looking in Bennett's direction, there is 
nothing that can be read in his face or in his body language to 
show that he is listening to, understanding or affirming Mr. 
Bennett's statement, no nod of the head, no movement at all, no 
comment, nothing.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Both Ms. Lewinsky and the president had a definition of sexual  
relations that would have allowed Ms. Lewinsky in her own mind, 
honestly and accurately in their view, to swear an affidavit that 
she had never had sexual relations, meaning what she meant in the 
exhibits we distributed, with the president.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Think, just for a moment, and ask yourself if whether these  
allegations about this testimony is really an effort to vindicate 
the rule of law, or is it something else, and ask yourself what 
coming generations will think about these charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``If you convict and remove President Clinton on the basis of  
these allegations, no president of the United States will ever be 
safe from impeachment again, and it will happen, and people will 
look back at us and they will say, 'We should have stopped it then, 
before it was too late.''' -- Craig.

<HEADLINE> Firemen Die in Calif. Plane Crash </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CORONA, Calif. (AP) -- Four off-duty firefighters on a  
snowboarding trip were killed Tuesday when their single-engine 
plane crashed into a fog-shrouded hillside shortly after takeoff. 
</P>
<P>
	The firemen died on impact about 4:54 a.m. just east of Chino  
Hills State Park, said Nancy Kidd of the Chino Valley Fire 
Department. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Chantry, 36, Donald Butts, 28, Daniel Alleman, 27, and  
John Jeffries III, 25, were headed for a Lake Tahoe snowboarding 
vacation when the plane crashed, department spokesman Fred Lynch 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The identity of the pilot was not disclosed, but Chantry, an  
airplane mechanic and pilot, was believed to be at the controls, 
said friend and co-worker Mike Ponn. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would fly with Mike in a minute. Anybody would,'' Ponn said.  
``He was a fantastic pilot. He was meticulous with everything he 
did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The crash left the plane's tail section intact and snowboards  
and other snow gear littered the crash site. Firefighters 
extinguished a small brush fire. 
</P>
<P>
	It was foggy and dark at the time but it wasn't known if weather  
was a factor in the crash, Ms. Kidd said. National Transportation 
Safety Board investigators were trying to determine the cause of 
the crash. 
</P>
<P>
	It was the first loss of active firemen in the Corona  
department's 100-year history, fire chief Mike Warren said.

<HEADLINE> McCain Pushing Air Competition Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Facing a March 31 deadline, Congress is  
pushing for early action on major legislation to improve airports 
and ensure aviation competition. 
</P>
<P>
	``Americans are paying more and more for less and less real  
service,'' Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz. 
</P>
<P>
	He is sponsoring legislation to reauthorize the Federal Aviation  
Administration and help some of the smaller aviation markets hit by 
deregulation of the industry. 
</P>
<P>
	The House and Senate last year failed to reconcile differences  
on competing bills, forcing lawmakers to pass a temporary six-month 
measure to keep the FAA operating. That extension March 31. 
</P>
<P>
	Both McCain, chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee, and  
House Transportation Committee Chairman Bud Shuster, R-Pa., have 
promised to move quickly to pass their respective bills. 
</P>
<P>
	The two bills are similar in many respects, but differ in key  
goals. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster wants to make sure that all future airline ticket tax  
revenues go to aviation improvements and not the general federal 
budget. McCain is committed to increasing flights, particularly to 
underserved smaller markets, from four large airports -- O'Hare in 
Chicago, LaGuardia and JFK in New York and Ronald Reagan Washington 
National. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain's bill, nearly identical to legislation that passed the  
Senate 92-1 last year, would reauthorize the FAA for two years and 
provide about $2.4 billion each year for the Airport Improvement 
Program. 
</P>
<P>
	It would create 30 new slots -- each equivalent to a takeoff and  
landing -- at O'Hare, with 18 to go to underserved communities. 
</P>
<P>
	National would add 12 round-trip flights, six of which would go  
beyond 1,250 miles. That is the limit set by the 1986 ``perimeter 
rule'' to protect the economic viability of Dulles and 
Baltimore-Washington, the region's two long-haul airports. Only 
aircraft with the lowest noise levels could be added. 
</P>
<P>
	Patrick Murphy, deputy assistant secretary for aviation at the  
Transportation Department, agreed with McCain that perimeters and 
slots hurt consumers and ``are no longer required for safety and 
operational control.'' But he said noise and local development 
remain issues in expanding flights out of busy airports. 
</P>
<P>
	The bill died last year in part because House Judiciary  
Committee Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill., resisted the addition of 
flights at O'Hare. 
</P>
<P>
	McCain also would set up a four-year pilot program to expand  
service to smaller markets; require the Transportation Department 
to look into marketing and other aviation industry practices that 
may inhibit competition; and put regulations on commercial air tour 
flights over national parks. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster said last week that his committee would pass a sweeping  
aviation bill by the end of February that reauthorizes the FAA for 
five years and ensures that all the money in the Airport and Airway 
Trust Fund goes to airport programs. 
</P>
<P>
	Airport taxes this year will generate some $10 billion in  
revenues, but less than $6 billion will be used on airport 
construction. The rest remains in the general budget, to be used to 
balance the budget or on other programs.

<HEADLINE> Music Makers: Taiwan's Indigenous </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) -- As a reigning pop diva, Chang Hui-mei must  
fight to keep her private life private. But when asked about her 
childhood in a tribal village, her wariness dissolves into a wide 
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've always considered myself lucky that I could not only be a  
singer, but also that my personal background could permit more 
people to understand indigenous people,'' Chang says. ``I think 
that's great.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Chang belongs to a new generation of musicians from Taiwan's  
indigenous tribes finding success in the island's entertainment 
business -- and highlighting the vibrancy of this island's native 
non-Chinese culture. 
</P>
<P>
	Indigenous performers have emerged as chart favorites in a  
variety of musical styles -- from traditional vocal music to Chang's 
dance records and the modern rock of Chang Chen-yueh and Power 
Station. 
</P>
<P>
	And though they sing in the dominant Mandarin Chinese dialect  
spoken throughout Taiwan, the natural ease and depth of emotion of 
their performances sets them apart from the island's overwhelming 
Chinese majority, music critics say. 
</P>
<P>
	They're also selling millions of records -- in Taiwan and  
throughout the Chinese-speaking world. 
</P>
<P>
	``Indigenous people, when they sing, when they dance, when  
they're making music, it's a very natural feeling,'' said Landy 
Chang, president of Magic Stone Records, which features several 
indigenous singers in its lineup. 
</P>
<P>
	Ethnic Chinese tend to be more stilted in their performances, he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Singing and dancing were a natural extension of Puyuma tribal  
life in southeastern Taitung County, says Chang, the island's 
undisputed top female star who mixes aboriginal chants into her 
trademark pop. 
</P>
<P>
	``People think I took years of lessons, but everything you see  
on stage is what I learned growing up,'' she said in an interview 
conducted between takes of her new music video. 
</P>
<P>
	Though tribal music has long been a fixture in Taiwan's music  
scene, being an aboriginal performer has never carried such cachet. 
</P>
<P>
	The German group Enigma's 1995 hit ``Return to Innocence''  
lifted a recording of a melody sung by Amis tribesman Difang that 
popularized indigenous music in a modern format -- though Difang 
didn't know of his fame until a friend heard the song on the radio. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawyers for Difang, a 76-year-old farmer from Taitung, are now  
fighting for a share of the royalties, while his own album of 
traditional chants set to a world music beat has won steady record 
sales and critical praise. 
</P>
<P>
	Taiwan's tribal music can also be heard on numerous ethnological  
CDs, and sampled on albums by bands such as world music group Deep 
Forest. 
</P>
<P>
	The notoriety brings new attention to the 380,000 indigenous  
tribal people who make up less than 2 percent of Taiwan's 
population and still face an uphill battle in mainstream society. 
</P>
<P>
	Descendants of Pacific island hoppers who migrated to Taiwan  
thousands of years ago, the tribal people speak a variety of 
Austronesian languages similar to native tongues of the 
Philippines, New Zealand and Hawaii. 
</P>
<P>
	For many, the Mandarin and Taiwanese Chinese spoken by most  
people on the island are second languages. 
</P>
<P>
	Highland groups mostly held out against assimilation during 400  
years of Chinese immigration to the island, until the 1980s sparked 
a wave of migration to the cities for jobs. 
</P>
<P>
	Recent changes have had their ups and downs, says Kao  
Cheng-shang, director of Taipei city's Commission for Native 
Taiwanese Affairs 
</P>
<P>
	Traditional jobs in mining fishing and construction have been  
lost to industrial upgrading or cheaper foreign workers, causing 
aboriginal incomes to lag behind those of most Taiwanese, he says. 
</P>
<P>
	Without steady income, many urban tribal people can't afford  
rent, so they live in shanty communities without electricity and 
running water. 
</P>
<P>
	Life in the mountains sometimes isn't much better.  
</P>
<P>
	In Wufeng township two hours south of Taipei, Presbyterian  
church social worker Chien Ching-nan says poverty, alcoholism and 
low education levels have denied tribal people a decent share of 
Taiwan's prosperity. 
</P>
<P>
	But music abounds in the villages, schools and dozens of tiny  
churches that dot the area. 
</P>
<P>
	``For a lot of people, a career in music or as a baseball player  
offers the best chance to escape poverty,'' says Chien. ``It's 
something God has given us.''

<HEADLINE> Rescuers Try To Reach Buried Worker </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A 40-year-old construction worker buried when  
the wall of a trench collapsed was being kept alive Wednesday by an 
oxygen line as rescue crews feverishly worked to extricate him. 
</P>
<P>
	Five hours after being trapped under several feet of earth,  
rescue workers were ``face to face'' with the man, who was not 
immediately identified, said Bob Collis, a spokesman for the Los 
Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
	About 100 rescue workers were at the site.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's air going down to him and he's communicating with  
(rescue workers),'' Collis said. ``But we don't know if he's 
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rescue workers were shoring up the side walls of the trench  
to prevent a further collapse, Collis said. Crews also used a 
machine called an ``air knife,'' which works like a big vacuum. 
They also carried dirt out with buckets. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Pacific railroad and Metrolink trains that run on the  
tracks next to the construction site were stopped out of fear that 
the vibration could cause further collapse of the trench. 
</P>
<P>
	One train was carrying 260 people. ``A lot of people will be  
late for dinner,'' Collis said. 
</P>
<P>
	Officials did not immediately know what caused the walls to  
collapse at the construction site in Pacoima, about 10 miles north 
of downtown. 
</P>
<P>
	The worker was helping place a 54-inch pipeline for the  
Department of Water and Power, said Walter Zeisl, spokesman for the 
company. The crew was placing the last 200 yards of a 13-mile 
project when the trench collapsed.

<HEADLINE> Female Lawyer Defends Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Following 15 male lawyers, deputy White House  
counsel Cheryl Mills made a spirited argument Wednesday that her 
boss did not deny a woman her civil rights. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not worried about civil rights, because this president's  
record on civil rights, on women's rights, on all of our rights, is 
unimpeachable,'' Mills told the Senate. President Clinton ``has 
worked every day to give all of us a better deal.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mills opened her argument in the president's impeachment trial  
by saying that ``as a lawyer, as an American, and as an 
African-American,'' she believed strongly in the rule of law. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is what many have struggled and died for, the right to be  
equal before the law,'' she said, speaking quietly and 
deliberately. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills joined the White House counsel's office six years ago when  
she was 27. She has worked at the center of some of the White 
House's most tangled controversies, including the 1994 
investigation of Clinton friend Webster Hubbell and the 1996 furor 
over Democratic fund raising and favors to Asian donors. 
</P>
<P>
	She graduated from the University of Virginia and Stanford Law  
School. During law school, she co-founded a nonprofit group that 
helps underprivileged minority high school seniors go to college. 
</P>
<P>
	Several House prosecutors emphasized last week that Clinton's  
effort to hide his affair with Monica Lewinsky came in a sex 
harassment lawsuit filed by Paula Jones under federal civil rights 
law. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., called the president ``an  
articulate spokesman for civil rights'' but added that ``when it 
was his case, when those rights had to be applied to him, he failed 
miserably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mills accused House prosecutors of suggesting that if the Senate  
did not remove Clinton from office, ``the entire house of civil 
rights might well fall.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I can't let their comments go unchallenged,'' she said. She  
told senators about Clinton's grandfather, whose store was one of 
the few in their town that would do business with black customers. 
</P>
<P>
	``He taught his grandson that the African Americans who came  
into his store were good people, and they worked hard, and they 
deserved a better deal in life,'' Mills said. 
</P>
<P>
	Mills' tenure at the White House has not been without  
controversy. Republicans on a House subcommittee accused her last 
year of withholding two documents from investigators on an 
unrelated matter. She has denied withholding documents. 
</P>
<P>
	On the eve of her questioning by Senate Whitewater Committee  
staff in 1995, Mills' car was broken into and copies of notes were 
stolen. The copies were her personal notes related to the processes 
for reviewing and producing documents that were in deputy White 
House counsel Vincent Foster's possession at the time of his 1993 
suicide.

<HEADLINE> Minority Cancer Study Changes Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Scientists studying why some minorities are  
more prone to certain types of cancer should focus on regional and 
ethnic groups rather than the current four broad racial categories, 
the Institute of Medicine said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Studying cancer rates among smaller groups it termed ``special  
populations'' will allow researchers to more accurately measure the 
impact of such things as ``cultural and behavioral factors, 
beliefs, lifestyle patterns, diet, environmental living conditions 
and other factors,'' said the institute, which advises the 
government on health issues. 
</P>
<P>
	At the same time, the report called on the National Institutes  
of Health to increase its efforts to determine why minorities are 
more prone to develop and die from certain types of cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	The call for additional research was quickly endorsed by the  
Intercultural Cancer Council, which lobbies for the interests of 
minority cancer victims. 
</P>
<P>
	``This study confirms what we've known all along -- that ethnic  
minorities and the medically underserved have not shared equally in 
the nation's progress against cancer,'' said Lovell A. Jones, ICC 
co-chairman. ``To reverse this tragic imbalance, these 
recommendations must be acted upon immediately.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Studies have found that black men have unusually high rates of  
prostate cancer, for example, while Asians are more likely to 
develop stomach and liver cancer than whites are. Studies also have 
found that cervical cancer is higher among Hispanic and 
Vietnamese-American women and that Alaska natives have high rates 
of colon and rectal cancer. 
</P>
<P>
	``With the population becoming increasingly diverse, it is  
critical that we learn why some ethnic minorities and the medically 
underserved are more prone to cancer and less likely to survive 
it,'' said M. Alfred Haynes, chairman of the committee that 
prepared the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal programs, including medical research, focus on four  
racial classifications: white, black, Asian or Pacific Islander and 
American Indian or Alaska Native. There is also a separate Hispanic 
category that can include people of any race. 
</P>
<P>
	These classifications, the committee said, ``are of limited  
utility for purposes of health research because the concept of race 
rests on the unfounded assumptions that there are fundamental 
biological differences among racial groups.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Collecting data on smaller, more specific, ethnic or regional  
groups would allow researchers to sort out such things as 
differences between blacks living in large cities and those in 
rural Southern communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the current Asian and Pacific Islander category includes a  
wide spectrum of people, such as Southeast Asians, Koreans, 
Japanese, Chinese and Indians. Grouping them together makes it 
difficult to pinpoint health problems particular to one or the 
other, the report says. 
</P>
<P>
	And the current broad categories hinder attempts to measure  
cancer rates among Hispanics of different national origins, among 
the various American Indian populations and among rural 
poverty-level whites such as those living in Appalachia, the report 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In this respect the diversity of the U.S. population offers an  
excellent opportunity to clarify issues relating to prevention and 
control,'' the report adds.

<HEADLINE> Govt. Helps Save California Desert </HEADLINE>

<P>
	PALM DESERT, Calif. (AP) -- The federal government took title  
Wednesday to 10,000 acres of sagebrush and solitude, the first 
installment in a deal aimed at preserving a large chunk of 
California desert from development. 
</P>
<P>
	Nelson Rising, president of Catellus Development Corp., helped  
Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt paste a ``SOLD'' sign on one of 
his company's ``For Sale'' billboards. Catellus, a remnant of 
Southern Pacific Railroad, has wanted to sell its land along 
Interstate 40 for years. 
</P>
<P>
	Rising thanked David Myers, executive director of the Wildlands  
Conservancy, for brokering a deal ``that I can justify to my 
shareholders.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This project literally prevents the California desert from  
being sliced in half'' by development along the interstate, Myers 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	The conservancy helped raise $25.5 million in cash and land for  
the deal. Congress must approve another $36 million for its share 
of the bill. 
</P>
<P>
	In exchange, the federal government gets 487,000 acres to  
manage; 437,000 from Catellus and the rest from smaller 
acquisitions. 
</P>
<P>
	Babbitt doubted Congress would pass up such a public-private  
partnership, part of a conservation initiative touted Tuesday by 
President Clinton in his State of the Union Address. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal pleased many groups, from hikers and environmentalists  
to property owners. 
</P>
<P>
	Developers want to preserve open space because it's good for  
property values, said Ed Kibbey, executive director of the Desert 
Chapter of the Building Industry Association of Southern 
California. 
</P>
<P>
	As a whole, the deal would complete a network of private and  
public nature preserves stretching from the fringes of Los Angeles, 
120 miles west of here, to the Colorado River, and from Death 
Valley southward almost to Mexico. 
</P>
<P>
	The spot where the first 10,000 acres was transferred overlooks  
Joshua Tree National Park. It marks the boundary between the golf 
greens of Palm Springs and arid mountains where bighorn sheep are 
fast disappearing.

<HEADLINE> Actor Robert Guillaume Recuperating </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Actor Robert Guillaume was recuperating after  
suffering a stroke in his dressing room on the set of his ABC 
series ``Sports Night,'' his publicist said. 
</P>
<P>
	Guillaume, who won Emmy Awards for roles as a level-headed  
butler on the ``Soap'' and ``Benson'' TV shows, was stricken Jan. 
14, publicist Marcy DeVeaux said Wednesday 
</P>
<P>
	The 71-year-old actor was released from the hospital on Tuesday.  
The name of the Los Angeles-area hospital wasn't disclosed for 
privacy reasons. 
</P>
<P>
	The stroke was described by doctors as mild and he was talking  
and walking without any problem, Ms. DeVeaux said. Doctors expect 
full recovery and the actor will return to ``Sports Night'' within 
a month, she said. 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Upstate N.Y. Hotel Auctioned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KIAMESHA LAKE, N.Y. (AP) -- The Concord Hotel -- the largest of  
the Catskills' famed ``Borscht Belt'' hotels -- has been auctioned 
off for $10.25 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The investment group Concord Associates LLP made the bid during  
a federal bankruptcy auction Tuesday, said Sullivan County Manager 
Jonathan Drapkin. 
</P>
<P>
	The Concord closed its doors in November after operating under  
Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings for more than a year. Like many 
other upstate New York hotels, the Concord's heyday was in the 
1920s and '30s when thousands of tourists visited the area. 
</P>
<P>
	With 1,220 rooms, a 2,000-seat dining area, 40 tennis courts and  
three swimming pools, the Concord, about 75 miles north of New York 
City, also was a proving ground for dozens of comedians and 
crooners. 
</P>
<P>
	The new investors, headed by New York City real estate developer  
Joseph Murphy, intend to run the Concord as a modern hotel, said 
Glen Pontier, a spokesman for Sullivan County.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Y2K Czar: Systems Will Be OK </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The president's Y2K point man said Wednesday the  
federal government is responding well to the computer bug, but 
small businesses and other countries are falling behind. 
</P>
<P>
	In testimony in Washington before the House's Government Reform  
and Oversight committee and the Committee on Science, John Koskinen 
said more than 80 percent of the government's systems would meet 
President Clinton's March 31 deadline for being ready to begin 
final testing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect that all of the government's critical systems will  
be Y2K compliant before Jan. 1, 2000,'' he said, according 
transcripts of the meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The Y2K bug occurs because many computers programmed to  
recognize only the last two digits of a year won't work properly 
beginning Jan. 1, 2000, when machines will assume it is 1900. Some 
computers can be reprogrammed, but many devices have embedded 
microchips that must be replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of Management and Budget estimates the problem will  
cost the federal government $5.4 billion, although some private 
groups estimate it could run closer to $6 billion. The agency said 
last month that roughly 60 percent of the government's 6,696 most 
important computers are compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the agency's reports and Koskinen's testimony, Rep.  
Stephen Horn, R-Calif., chairman of the science committee, was not 
so optimistic. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wish him well and I hope he's right,'' he said. ``We'll soon  
know.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Horn has long criticized the Clinton administration's efforts on  
Y2K, giving the government a ``D'' grade in November for its 
performance. 
</P>
<P>
	The OMB had set Sept. 30 as the deadline for all agencies to  
have their mission-critical systems renovated. Most agencies missed 
that deadline, as Tim Wilson, publisher of Y2K News, a magazine 
dedicated to the bug, pointed out. ``I don't blame Congressman Horn 
for being skeptical,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> GOP State of Union Response Text 1 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Text of the Republican response, by Reps. Jennifer Dunn,  
R-Wash., and Steve Largent, R-Okla., to President Clinton's State 
of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	Good evening, I'm Jennifer Dunn. I represent the people of the  
8th District of Washington state. 
</P>
<P>
	And I'm Steve Largent from the 1st District of Oklahoma.  
</P>
<P>
	(Dunn):  
</P>
<P>
	As you might imagine -- if you'd been sitting with us in the  
House Chamber tonight as the president was giving his speech -- you 
could have felt the swirl of history, These are disturbing and 
controversial times in our nation's capital. 
</P>
<P>
	A couple of weeks ago, I heard a network anchor say, ``The  
capital is in chaos.'' Another proclaimed we were in the midst of a 
constitutional crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Ladies and gentlemen, our country is not in crisis. There are no  
tanks in the streets. Our system of government is as solid as the 
Capitol dome you see behind me. 
</P>
<P>
	Our democracy is sound. Our economy is prosperous. The State of  
our Union is strong. And no matter what the outcome of the 
president's situation, life in America will go on. Our lives will 
continue to be filled with practical matters, not constitutional 
ones. 
</P>
<P>
	I've been a single mother since my boys were little -- 6 and 8.  
My life in those days was taken up with making ends meet, trying to 
get to two soccer games at the same time on two different fields, 
worrying about dropping the boys off early at school in order to 
get to work on time. I know how that knot in the pit of your 
stomach feels. I've been there. 
</P>
<P>
	I'm still a practical person.  
</P>
<P>
	You heard the president make a lot of promises to a lot of  
people tonight, but I'd like to talk to you about two very 
practical Republican priorities -- tax relief and Social Security 
reform. 
</P>
<P>
	Our current tax system is a burden on the economy and on the  
American people. Let me tell you a story about a fellow I represent 
from North Bend, Wash. His name is Robert Allan. 
</P>
<P>
	A few years ago, the IRS denied his right to file a joint return  
with his wife, because they said his wife Shirley was deceased. 
Well, I've seen Shirley -- she looks pretty good for a dead person! 
</P>
<P>
	Robert took Shirley to the IRS office in Seattle. The IRS was  
not convinced. So the Allans brought in their family doctor, who in 
his medical opinion pronounced Shirley alive -- the IRS was still 
not convinced. 
</P>
<P>
	It took intervention by a member of Congress, me, to resolve  
this comedy, which in truth is a tragedy because it's symbolic of 
how removed our entire tax system has become from reality and 
common sense. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, we passed legislation reining in the IRS -- so that  
taxpayers are now considered innocent until proven guilty. But so 
much more needs to be done. 
</P>
<P>
	Next year there will be a $63 billion-dollar budget surplus. Mr.  
President, give it back. Last year, a typical mother and father who 
both work paid nearly 40 percent of their income in taxes -- that 
means 40 cents of every dollar they earned went to the government 
in federal, state or local taxes -- that's the highest percentage of 
income ever paid in taxes by American families. 
</P>
<P>
	I don't know about you but that really bothers me; no wonder so  
many American families are struggling: 
</P>
<P>
	Get married, and your taxes go up.  
</P>
<P>
	Save for your children's education, and your taxes go up.  
</P>
<P>
	And when you die -- that's right -- your taxes go up. The  
government gets a bigger piece of your life's work than all your 
children put together. So what can you expect from Republicans? 
Expect action. 
</P>
<P>
	First, tonight we're proposing a 10 percent, across-the-board  
cut in tax rates for every working American. That is the down 
payment on a simpler, fairer, flatter tax system. 
</P>
<P>
	Second, we must end the marriage penalty. We should honor  
commitment, not tax it. 
</P>
<P>
	And third, we must cut death taxes so that families don't have  
to sell their businesses and farms when Mom and Dad die. 
</P>
<P>
	In all our tax policies, we start from this premise: The  
people's money belongs to the people, not to the government. 
</P>
<P>
	The second thing I want to talk about is Social Security. A year  
ago in his State of the Union speech, the president said he was 
committed to saving Social Security. I'm glad to hear him discuss 
it again this evening. We are interested in his ideas on how to 
spend the surplus. Unfortunately, the president still hasn't given 
us his plan to save Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	Mr. President, we're still waiting for that legislation.  
</P>
<P>
	Social Security will begin to go bankrupt in about 15 years -- if  
we don't find solutions now. We have reserved H.R. 1 -- the very 
first bill of this Congress -- for the president's Social Security 
plan. 
</P>
<P>
	Words may be a comfort, but we need action. There's one thing we  
can all agree on -- one nonnegotiable principle -- we must keep our 
contract with our senior citizens who depend on Social Security for 
part or all of their retirement income, This nation made that 
promise long ago and we will keep that promise. 
</P>
<P>
	But Social Security needs not just to be saved; it needs to be  
updated for the 21st century. People today want and expect to have 
more control over their lives and their money. But President 
Clinton's approach, as you've just heard, gives the government more 
control of your retirement income. 
</P>
<P>
	The Social Security dollars deducted from your paycheck  
currently earn less than 3 percent a year. That's not enough of a 
return; that's not going to keep Social Security solvent; and it's 
especially not fair to young people and women. For example, the 
current system works against mothers who choose to step out of 
their job for a while, away from their career, to raise children or 
to care for parents. 
</P>
<P>
	It works against wives, who more often than not, survive their  
husbands and end up living for more years on fewer dollars. And it 
works against young people who believe they'll never see a Social 
Security check. 
</P>
<P>
	Here's a better way: Give working Americans the choice to invest  
some of their Social Security dollars in personal retirement 
accounts. We can do this without touching a dime in Social Security 
funds -- without raising one nickel in taxes -- without touching one 
penny of current benefits. 
</P>
<P>
	A new century requires a new beginning -- in approaches, in  
ideas, and, yes, in civility and cooperation between political 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
	I'd like to close on a personal note. I'm a mother, a gardener,  
a Republican and a member of Congress. Believe me, all four take 
patience. 
</P>
<P>
	My boys thankfully turned out to be wonderful young men. My  
plants at home unfortunately need a lot of work. And as for my 
efforts in the Congress, I am constantly planting and watering. 
</P>
<P>
	And as one citizen to another, in spite of all the troubling  
things you hear about our nation's capital, I believe that good 
ideas can take root here, good things can grow here and good things 
can blossom here. Steve --

<HEADLINE> Unions Say Merger Talks Under Way </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DAYTON, Ohio (AP) -- Merger negotiations are underway between the  
International Union of Electronic Workers and the United Mine 
Workers, the Dayton Daily News reported today. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are in heavy merger talks and I hope it happens because  
both unions would be much stronger,'' said Mike Bindas, president 
of an IUE chapter in Dayton. 
</P>
<P>
	The IUE represents 130,000 members across the nation -- including  
13,500 workers at five Dayton-area auto plants -- and the UMW has 
60,000 members. 
</P>
<P>
	``The only way the IUE can truly protect its independence is by  
buddying up with another independent union, so a merger like that 
would make a lot of sense,'' said Sean McAlinden, a labor 
researcher at the University of Michigan. 
</P>
<P>
	If an agreement is reached, the unions would start with an  
affiliation before completing a full merger, Bindas said. 
</P>
<P>
	The IUE also has discussed merging with the United Auto Workers  
and the United Steel Workers of America, but a deal with those 
unions is unlikely at this time, Bindas said. 
</P>
<P>
	A message requesting additional comment from the IUE was left  
today at the union's national headquarters in Washington. There was 
no answer to calls to UMW headquarters, also in Washington.

<HEADLINE> House Aide Has Fatal Heart Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A congressional aide who never missed a State  
of the Union speech in 33 years working for the House died Tuesday 
night from a heart attack immediately after President Clinton's 
address. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles ``Billy'' Malry, 63, was pronounced dead at George  
Washington University Hospital, where he was rushed by a Navy 
ambulance after collapsing in the Democratic cloakroom next to the 
House floor following Clinton's speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Cloakroom manager Barry Sullivan said Malry had been released  
from the hospital four days earlier after being treated for heart 
disease. 
</P>
<P>
	``He said, 'I feel better and this is the State of the Union,  
and I haven't missed one. This is where I want to be,''' Sullivan 
recalled Malry telling people a few hours before Clinton's speech. 
</P>
<P>
	Malry worked for the Office of the Clerk as an attendant in the  
cloakroom and occasionally delivered messages to lawmakers from 
people not allowed on the House floor. 
</P>
<P>
	``He always had a warm greeting for everybody,'' Sullivan said.  
</P>
<P>
	Malry lived in Alexandria, Va. He is survived by his wife and  
son.

<HEADLINE> McNown Leaves UCLA To Focus on NFL </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- UCLA quarterback Cade McNown, who finished  
third in the Heisman Trophy voting last month, has left school to 
focus on preparing for the NFL draft. 
</P>
<P>
	McNown was based in Bradenton, Fla., for over two weeks and  
engaged in full-time training sessions at the International 
Performance Institute on the grounds of the Bollettieri Sports 
Academy, the Los Angeles Times reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The 22-year-old quarterback left Bradenton last weekend to  
prepare for Saturday's Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala. He is expected 
to return to Florida after the game to prepare for the NFL combine 
Feb. 18-22 in Indianapolis and the NFL draft April 17-18. 
</P>
<P>
	UCLA spokesman Marc Dellins confirmed Wednesday that McNown, who  
holds just about every single-season and career passing record at 
the school, was not enrolled in school for the winter quarter, but 
added, ``It's very possible he'll re-enroll for the spring 
quarter.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McNown's agent, Tom Condon of IMG, hired veteran NFL assistant  
coach Larry Kennan to serve as McNown's private quarterback coach 
in Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	At the performance institute, close to a dozen football players  
train six days a week under the guidance of coaches and trainers.

<HEADLINE>  Marlins Owner Woos Fans </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- New Florida Marlins owner John Henry interrupted  
his news conference Wednesday to hold up a sign for the cameras 
that read: ``CALL 930-HITS.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Anybody want to buy season tickets?'' Henry asked with a  
smile. 
</P>
<P>
	The campaign to win back disgruntled Marlins fans began hours  
after Henry completed his $150 million purchase of the troubled 
franchise from founding owner H. Wayne Huizenga. Major league 
owners approved the sale last week, and the deal closed Tuesday 
when Henry paid Huizenga. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't worry about the investment,'' said the 49-year-old  
Henry, a multimillionaire commodities trader from Boca Raton. ``I 
can't take it with me.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He's unlikely to recoup his investment anytime soon. Henry  
projects that the Marlins will lose $5 million to $9 million this 
year despite a payroll of just $25 million, one of the lowest in 
baseball. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1997, the Marlins won the World Series but lost $34 million,  
according to Huizenga, who ordered the team dismantled. Last year, 
with a payroll of just $13 million by the end of the season, 
Florida lost 108 games and the support of many fans. 
</P>
<P>
	But if fans want a winning team again, Henry said, they must pay  
for it. He'll seek a taxpayer-financed ballpark. 
</P>
<P>
	``In baseball, more than in any other sport, revenues determine  
success,'' he said. ``The more the community will do, the better 
the team will do. It comes down to people deciding whether baseball 
is important in South Florida.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new ballpark is the only way to generate the revenue needed to  
pay high-priced players, Henry said. He pointed to the turnaround 
of the Cleveland Indians in their new stadium as an example. 
</P>
<P>
	``To compete in the National League today, a team needs a  
payroll of at least $50 million,'' he said. ``The Marlins in Pro 
Player Stadium can't break even with a $20 million payroll. The 
future of baseball in South Florida depends on playing in a new 
ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry said the Marlins will be able to afford a $50 million  
payroll as soon as they move into a new ballpark -- if taxpayers 
help build it. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to such a plan prompted the sale of the team by  
Huizenga, who was perceived as a villain for breaking up the World 
Series champions. Henry provides a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me he represents real promise for South Florida baseball,''  
Marlins general manager Dave Dombrowski said. ``It's been a 
year-and-a-half roller-coaster ride. The ride has stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry, a native of Quincy, Ill., described himself Wednesday as  
``a farmer who studied philosophy in college but failed to 
graduate.'' More important is that he's a lifelong baseball fan who 
grew up listening to Harry Caray broadcast St. Louis Cardinals 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the kind of guy who would be playing baseball if he  
could,'' said Marlins pitcher Alex Fernandez, one of several 
players attending the news conference. ``That makes me want to play 
for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry will have an office at Pro Player Stadium, and he won't  
hire a replacement for departed team president Don Smiley, a 
Huizenga confidant. But Henry said he won't be involved in baseball 
decisions. Smiley's duties will be assumed by Jonathan Mariner, 
senior vice president for finance and administration, and Jim Ross, 
vice president for sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins' new owner pledged last year to pay for a new  
ballpark himself if necessary, a comment he may regret. He'd rather 
spend the money on players. 
</P>
<P>
	``My responsibility to you is not to commit financial suicide,''  
he said Wednesday. ``My responsibility to you is to stabilize this 
franchise financially so that South Florida baseball is winning 
baseball, and to alter the economics so that after I'm gone, no one 
will ever think there's an advantage to the team playing anywhere 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry has promised to keep the team in South Florida. He said he  
has no desire to make a profit on the Marlins, and he'll open the 
books so the public understands their financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to tell you how much money we're losing,'' he  
said, ``and we want you to believe us.''

the team will do. It comes down to people deciding whether baseball 
is important in South Florida.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A new ballpark is the only way to generate the revenue needed to  
pay high-priced players, Henry said. He pointed to the turnaround 
of the Cleveland Indians in their new stadium as an example. 
</P>
<P>
	``To compete in the National League today, a team needs a  
payroll of at least $50 million,'' he said. ``The Marlins in Pro 
Player Stadium can't break even with a $20 million payroll. The 
future of baseball in South Florida depends on playing in a new 
ballpark.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry said the Marlins will be able to afford a $50 million  
payroll as soon as they move into a new ballpark -- if taxpayers 
help build it. 
</P>
<P>
	Opposition to such a plan prompted the sale of the team by  
Huizenga, who was perceived as a villain for breaking up the World 
Series champions. Henry provides a fresh start. 
</P>
<P>
	``To me he represents real promise for South Florida baseball,''  
Marlins general manager Dave Dombrowski said. ``It's been a 
year-and-a-half roller-coaster ride. The ride has stopped.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry, a native of Quincy, Ill., described himself Wednesday as  
``a farmer who studied philosophy in college but failed to 
graduate.'' More important is that he's a lifelong baseball fan who 
grew up listening to Harry Caray broadcast St. Louis Cardinals 
games. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's the kind of guy who would be playing baseball if he  
could,'' said Marlins pitcher Alex Fernandez, one of several 
players attending the news conference. ``That makes me want to play 
for him.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry will have an office at Pro Player Stadium, and he won't  
hire a replacement for departed team president Don Smiley, a 
Huizenga confidant. But Henry said he won't be involved in baseball 
decisions. Smiley's duties will be assumed by Jonathan Mariner, 
senior vice president for finance and administration, and Jim Ross, 
vice president for sales and marketing. 
</P>
<P>
	The Marlins' new owner pledged last year to pay for a new  
ballpark himself if necessary, a comment he may regret. He'd rather 
spend the money on players. 
</P>
<P>
	``My responsibility to you is not to commit financial suicide,''  
he said Wednesday. ``My responsibility to you is to stabilize this 
franchise financially so that South Florida baseball is winning 
baseball, and to alter the economics so that after I'm gone, no one 
will ever think there's an advantage to the team playing anywhere 
else.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Henry has promised to keep the team in South Florida. He said he  
has no desire to make a profit on the Marlins, and he'll open the 
books so the public understands their financial situation. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to tell you how much money we're losing,'' he  
said, ``and we want you to believe us.''

<HEADLINE> Crude Falls on Ample Supply Worries  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Crude oil futures retreated Wednesday on the New York Mercantile  
Exchange amid predictions new inventory data would show U.S. 
supplies continue to build amid a world supply glut. 
</P>
<P>
	On other markets, pork futures rose sharply, while sugar futures  
continued their retreat. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude and its products retreated as market participants bet the  
trade group the American Petroleum Institute would report that oil 
inventories grew in the past week despite cold weather that boosted 
demand for heating oil. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, the report released after the end of trading Wednesday  
showed oil inventories slipped to 321.9 million barrels, from a 
revised total of 324.05 in the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Gasoline stocks rose by 5 million barrels to 224.372 million  
barrels, while refineries were operating at 95.5 percent of 
capacity, down from 97.6 percent the previous week. 
</P>
<P>
	Energy futures prices have been in the doldrums for months as  
members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and 
other key world oil producers remain reluctant to make the output 
cuts that analysts say are necessary to boost prices. 
</P>
<P>
	World demand for crude and its products have been sharply lower  
amid economic problems in Asia, Africa, Russia and now Latin 
America. Demand in the United States, meantime, has not been strong 
enough to overcome weakness elsewhere. 
</P>
<P>
	In particular, the major Midwest and Northeast heating regions  
enjoyed above-normal temperatures through most of the fall and 
early winter, cutting demand further for heating oil. 
</P>
<P>
	Crude oil for February delivery fell 27 cents to $11.81 a  
barrel; February heating oil fell .88 cent to 31.34 cents a gallon; 
February unleaded gasoline fell 1.46 cents to 33.73 cents a gallon. 
</P>
<P>
	Natural gas futures advanced amid forecasts for cooler Northeast  
temperatures next week, with the February contract rising 1 cent to 
$1.827 for each 1,000 cubic feet. 
</P>
<P>
	Pork futures rose sharply on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange  
amid hopes the worst of a nation pork glut could be coming to an 
end. 
</P>
<P>
	There was market talk that the Clinton administration in coming  
days would offer additional food aid to beleaguered Russia, just as 
record hog marketings begin to slow following severe weather 
recently in several large producing states. 
</P>
<P>
	Market participants also discussed the possibility that Japan,  
one of the largest buyers of U.S. pork, is planning to increase its 
imports in coming weeks as it replenishes inventories. 
</P>
<P>
	February lean hogs rose 2 cents to 40.82 cents a pound; February  
pork bellies rose the limit 3 cents to 56.05 cents a pound. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures prices continued to be hammered on the Board of  
Trade of the City of New York by fears Brazil, the world's largest 
sugar producer, will sell heavily into the market in coming days. 
</P>
<P>
	Economic troubles in that country could result in a flood of  
exports since most commodities are priced in U.S. dollars. 
Following Brazil's devaluation of its real, marketers would be able 
to boost exports and receive more of their own currency. 
</P>
<P>
	Sugar futures prices have been plagued for months by ample world  
supplies and reduced demand, and the Brazilian situation has 
accelerated the slide in prices. 
</P>
<P>
	March raw sugar fell .17 cent to 7.52 cents a pound.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Must Be Resourceful in 1999 / Farm Scene  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PADUCAH, Ky. (AP) -- Kentucky's farmers are being urged to become  
smarter marketers in 1999 and, where possible, to use the Internet 
to solve their price problems. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think you're looking at a year that's going to demand our  
best marketing techniques for survival,'' said Steve Stanley, 
president of the Kentucky Soybean Association and a 
Madisonville-area farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	Independent farmers must use the Internet and other technology  
to find markets and lock in prices in advance, rather than waiting 
and gambling on getting the best price, said Benny Cooper, chairman 
of the Kentucky Soybean Board. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think all of us want to get the top prices, but we can't  
operate that way anymore,'' said Cooper, a Ballard County farmer. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Stanley were among nearly 300 members of Kentucky corn,  
soybean and small grain growers' associations who met this week to 
discuss the price problem and ways to become more competitive. 
</P>
<P>
	In the past 20 years, competition has spread from national to  
international markets such as South America, which produces huge 
grain crops and does not have the same environmental restrictions 
as the United States, Cooper said. As a result, many large firms 
that buy and use grain have moved parts of their operations to 
foreign countries. 
</P>
<P>
	Foreign production and domestic overproduction were factors that  
caused grain prices to hit 40-year lows last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Perhaps an even greater factor was currency trouble that  
prompted Asian and other countries to reduce imports of grain from 
the United States, said Bob Wade Jr., president of the Kentucky 
Corn Growers' Association. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were developing a middle class that puts meat on the  
table, which helps the livestock and grain producers,'' said Wade, 
a Hardin County farmer. ``A lot of that was set back over the past 
year because of the crumbling economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Although many farmers resist it, agriculture is moving rapidly  
toward contracting prices with large companies, said Scott Wilferd, 
a Purchase area director on the corn growers board. 
</P>
<P>
	He and Cooper said environmental restrictions, particularly on  
the swine industry, have forced large companies to avoid building 
facilities in Kentucky, which in turn hurts grain producers. 
</P>
<P>
	Besides being smarter marketers and locking in prices at least a  
year in advance, commodity producers must look at specialty, 
``value-added'' farming to stabilize their income, Wade said. 
</P>
<P>
	An example is high-oil corn, which has twice the oil of regular  
field corn, adding fat and energy to livestock. 
</P>
<P>
	``The value-added business helps small farmers because specialty  
crops usually don't require large acreage,'' Wilferd said. 
</P>
<P>
	During the next decade, yellow corn farming will evolve into a  
wide variety of corn production for industry, Wade said, ``so we'll 
become less commodity producers and more input producers for 
manufacturers.''

<HEADLINE> Nashville Sound: Bill Anderson </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) -- When Bill Anderson was asked to make his  
first album in eight years, he thought it was a joke. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm like, `Yeah, sure -- where's the punch line?''' Anderson  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	During a career that started 42 years ago and produced seven No.  
1 hits, the 61-year-old Anderson learned how fast one can fall out 
of fashion. He'll never forget the day in the mid-1980s when he 
excitedly pitched a new song to a publisher. 
</P>
<P>
	``I said, `I think I've got a smash hit for a girl!' Without  
even listening to it, he looked up at me and said, `Who do you want 
me to play it for, Kitty Wells?''' Anderson recalled. (Wells, born 
in 1919, had her heyday in the 1950s and 1960s.) 
</P>
<P>
	``And everybody in the room laughed.'' Anderson said. ``I  
carried that hurt with me for a while.'' 
</P>
<P>
	While he continued performing, Anderson accepted the harsh  
assessment: He was out-of-touch with the younger generation of 
country music fans. 
</P>
<P>
	``Looking back on it now I kind of tucked my tail between my  
legs and went and sat in the corner and pouted for about 10 
years,'' he said during a recent backstage interview at the Grand 
Ole Opry House. 
</P>
<P>
	So he had reason to be cautious last year when his friend,  
country singer Steve Wariner, approached him on behalf of Jim Ed 
Norman, who runs Warner Bros. Records in Nashville. Now he's 
clearly tickled to have a new album, ``Fine Wine,'' to promote. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Georgia sportswriter and disc jockey broke into the  
music business in 1957 when he recorded his song ``City Lights'' 
for a small Texas record company. Nashville star Ray Price heard 
the song, recorded it, and took it to No. 1. 
</P>
<P>
	Anderson soon scored a recording deal with Decca. He got the  
nickname ``Whisperin' Bill'' for his relaxed, conversational vocal 
style, which was born of necessity -- his airy tenor is short on 
range and power. 
</P>
<P>
	But he was a strong songwriter and natural entertainer, writing  
smashes like ``Still'' and ``Mama Sang a Song'' for himself, as 
well as hits for Connie Smith, Lefty Frizzell, Roger Miller and 
others. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time his string of hits ran out in 1982 with ``Make Mine  
Night Time,'' he'd had 37 Top 10 records. 
</P>
<P>
	``My last contract was up, and they (MCA, which had acquired  
Decca) didn't renew it,'' Anderson said. ``I could feel country 
music changing. Country music in the early- and mid-1980s, if you 
remember, had a decidedly pop feel to it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He continued to perform his old hits on the Grand Ole Opry radio  
show and on tour. He hosted the game show ``Fandango'' on The 
Nashville Network from 1983 to '89 and now hosts ``Backstage at the 
Opry'' each Saturday night on TNN. 
</P>
<P>
	Then Wariner took Anderson's 1960 hit ``The Tips of My Fingers''  
to No. 3 in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	``The first time I heard that record on the radio my stomach did  
flip-flops,'' Anderson said. ``I hadn't felt this in a long time, 
and I would look in Billboard and I'd see it going up the charts 
... and all of a sudden it was 1963 again. 
</P>
<P>
	``When I was doing the game show and all that stuff, I was  
enjoying all of that, but I didn't realize that that part of me was 
missing until I found it again.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He sought songwriting collaborators and hooked up with Wariner  
and Skip Ewing. 
</P>
<P>
	``Getting with Vince (Gill), I think, was probably the thing  
that put me over the hump,'' Anderson said. ``He was the first one 
that we really had some success, with `Which Bridge to Cross (Which 
Bridge to Burn),''' a No. 4 hit for Gill in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Gill helped him modernize his lyrics.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's just certain things today that you don't write about  
that they wrote about back in the '60s. You don't write a song 
today that puts a woman down -- women write songs and put men 
down,'' Anderson said with a chuckle. 
</P>
<P>
	Wariner produced ``Fine Wine,'' and country stars Hal Ketchum  
and Lee Ann Womack co-wrote songs with Anderson. The album is 
vintage Whisperin' Bill, especially on genteel love songs like 
``Good Love and a Bottle of Wine'' and ``Now That's Love.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There's a redo of ``The Tips of My Fingers'' featuring the four  
other singers who've scored a hit with it: Wariner, Roy Clark, Eddy 
Arnold and Jeanie Shepard. 
</P>
<P>
	Warner Bros. is marketing the album on television, over the  
Internet, and in magazine and direct mail advertising. There's not 
much hope of getting his new material played on the radio, Anderson 
concedes. 
</P>
<P>
	``If they're not going to play George Jones and Merle Haggard,  
they're not going to play Bill Anderson,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``But I'm very active, I still work the road. Warner Brothers  
told me they just believed there were a lot of Bill Anderson fans 
out there who would buy an album if they knew it was out.'' 
</P>

<HEADLINE> Pentagon: Defense Hikes Too Small </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The $12 billion in extra military spending  
President Clinton is proposing falls short of meeting many pressing 
Pentagon needs, the nation's top military commanders told Congress 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers, in turn, told the chiefs of the Army, Navy, Air Force  
and Marines not to count on any savings in the near future from 
additional base closings. 
</P>
<P>
	Even though Clinton plans to ask for another round of closings  
in the budget he sends Congress next month, ``he's not going to get 
a base closing bill. We were burned once. We're not going to be 
burned again,'' said Rep. Curt Weldon, R-Pa. 
</P>
<P>
	The service chiefs and Gen. Henry Shelton, chairman of the Joint  
Chiefs of Staff, testified before the House Armed Services 
Committee on the state of military readiness. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union address on Tuesday, Clinton reiterated  
his intention to request $12 billion in increased Pentagon spending 
in his fiscal 2000 budget, part of a plan to spend $110 billion 
over the next six years. 
</P>
<P>
	Shelton said the $12 billion ``will go a long way toward meeting  
our most critical requirements.'' But, he added, it falls short of 
the $20.1 billion in increased spending the services believe they 
need next year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Readiness is very fragile and the indicators are not good,''  
said Adm. Jay L. Johnson, chief of naval operations. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the other military chiefs, Johnson voiced support for the  
administration request -- but also made it clear he wouldn't mind 
one bit if Congress wanted to throw some more money the Navy's way. 
</P>
<P>
	``The administration understands our issues and is working hard  
to assist us, but congressional help will also be crucial,'' 
Johnson said in prepared testimony. ``Your enduring support is 
greatly appreciated.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gen. Charles Krulak, commandant of the Marine Corps, cautioned:  
``If we are going to maintain our technological advantage in 
defense, we simply must modernize the force.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Overall, the Pentagon chiefs have told Congress they need about  
$150 billion more over the next six years, instead of the 
additional $110 billion Clinton has proposed. 
</P>
<P>
	Committee Republicans complained that, of the $12 billion for  
next year, only about $4 billion would be in real new money. The 
remaining $8 billion would come from savings due to lower inflation 
and lower fuel costs. ``I hope the budget contains real spending 
increases to apply against real shortfalls,'' said the committee 
chairman, Rep. Floyd Spence, R-S.C. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House has said that Clinton will ask Congress to  
approve two new rounds of base closings -- one in 2001 and another 
in 2005. 
</P>
<P>
	But lawmakers still are reeling from earlier rounds in 1991,  
1993 and 1995 that shut down 70 bases. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans are also suspicious of the administration's  
commitment to the base-closing process, which was established in an 
effort to take politics out of the system by having an independent 
commission make binding recommendations. 
</P>
<P>
	They accused the White House of improperly intervening in this  
process last year to keep defense jobs in California when McClellan 
Air Force Base in Sacramento closes -- and fulfill a 1996 
re-election campaign promise made by Clinton in the state. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Joel Hefley, R-Colo., told the service chiefs to detail  
exactly which bases they think are wasteful and should be closed. 
</P>
<P>
	The chiefs talked generally about excess infrastructure, but  
none presented any specific proposals to the panel. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, three Senate advocates of base closings -- Sens. John  
McCain, R-Ariz., Carl Levin, D-Mich., and Charles Robb, D-Va -- 
introduced a bill in the Senate to authorize rounds of base 
closings in 2001 and 2003. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can continue to maintain a military infrastructure that we  
don't need, or we can provide the necessary funds to ensure our 
military can fight and win future wars,'' McCain said in a 
statement. ``Every dollar we spend on bases we do not need is a 
dollar we cannot spend on training our troops, keeping personnel 
quality of life at an appropriate level, maintaining force 
structure, replacing old weapons systems and advancing our 
military.''

<HEADLINE> Suns Wait on McDyess </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHOENIX (AP) -- With the indecision of Antonio McDyess holding up  
the Phoenix Suns' efforts to settle their roster, owner Jerry 
Colangelo is working on backup deals to land Tom Gugliotta or other 
free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns have a bushel of personnel decisions to make before  
training camp finally opens, but everything hinged on McDyess' 
choice of re-signing with Phoenix or moving back to his former 
team, the Denver Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess' agent, James Bryant, said the decision would come  
sometime today. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo, his patience obviously wearing thin, was beside  
himself trying understand why McDyess, who seemed so happy to get 
out of Denver when he was traded to Phoenix in the fall of 1997, 
would consider switching back to such a struggling franchise. 
</P>
<P>
	``It defies logic in my opinion,'' Colangelo said Tuesday. ``We  
think this is a great spot for him. He seemed very happy here. We 
love him as a young guy and a future star in this league. But a lot 
of things have happened this offseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo was developing ``Option B'' and ``Option C'' should  
McDyess decide to bolt for Colorado. 
</P>
<P>
	``All of our efforts right now are hopefully for a return of  
Antonio McDyess to the Phoenix Suns,'' Colangelo said. ``Option B, 
and a very strong Option B, is looking at some other top free 
agents.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta heads a list that also includes Vlade Divac and Brent  
Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	The Suns will need all the players they can get. When a  
sign-and-trade deal is completed to bring Luc Longley from Chicago 
for Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells, Phoenix will be 
down to three players. And training camp is supposed to start on 
Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The team postponed an open scrimmage and ``Fan Festival''  
scheduled for Saturday because of the roster uncertainty. 
</P>
<P>
	Longley obviously expects the Chicago trade to go through. He  
was in Phoenix and worked out on the Suns' practice court on 
Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think there's a good chance I will be here and I'd like to  
be here,'' Longley said. ``First of all, it seems like a good town. 
The franchise always seems to put together a good team and seems 
serious about winning. If we can agree to terms, this is probably 
my favorite choice of towns to be in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Under the deal, Longley would earn about $4 million this season,  
while the Suns would rid themselves of $3.125 million in salaries 
by sending Bryant, Muursepp and Wells to Chicago. 
</P>
<P>
	That would clear more cap room and allow the Suns to go after  
Gugliotta or other free agents. 
</P>
<P>
	Gugliotta, who stands to make more money by re-signing with  
Minnesota, also reportedly was considering Denver. 
</P>
<P>
	If the Suns were to go after the less expensive Divac, they  
would have more resources left for other players, including Barry. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess' agents have said that the 24-year-old forward likes  
Denver, has many friends there and is comfortable with general 
manager Dan Issel. He also is good friends with Nuggets point guard 
Nick Van Exel. 
</P>
<P>
	``With Phoenix, you know you have a contender, with Denver you  
know you'll have a good young team,'' Bryant said on Tuesday. ``So 
Phoenix is a known quantity, and Denver is intriguing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess fired agent Arn Tellem two months ago, and Colangelo  
said he has had a hard time getting through to James Bryant or 
McDyess' other agent, Tony Dutt. Colangelo also has been hamstrung 
by the league prohibition on teams contacting players directly. 
</P>
<P>
	``He's an introverted kind of a guy and he's been gone all  
summer,'' Colangelo said of McDyess. ``We've had very, very little 
contact with anyone around him. That puts us in a very weak 
position, unfortunately, but hopefully logic will prevail and he'll 
end up back in Phoenix.''

<HEADLINE> NCAA Wants Shield From Bias Suits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- A lawsuit drafted by a rookie law student  
angry that she was denied a spot on her college volleyball team 
will help the Supreme Court answer whether the NCAA is subject to 
federal discrimination laws. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA told the court Wednesday that a key anti-bias law  
guaranteeing federal protection against sex discrimination in most 
schools does not apply to it. 
</P>
<P>
	``The NCAA is an association of its members and its members ...  
receive federal money. The NCAA does not,'' argued the tax-exempt 
organization's lawyer, John G. Roberts Jr. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts said a federal appeals court was wrong when it ruled  
that the NCAA is an indirect recipient of federal aid because of 
the dues it collects from its 1,200 member schools. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal law known as Title IX of the Education Amendments of  
1972 applies only to educational programs receiving federal money. 
</P>
<P>
	The Supreme Court is expected to rule in Renee Smith's case by  
summer. If the court allows her to continue her lawsuit, the NCAA 
could be on the hook in a host of other discrimination lawsuits 
based on race or disability, both sides have said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA argues that individual universities are fair game for  
discrimination complaints, but said it is a step removed. 
</P>
<P>
	``You don't just follow the money,'' Roberts argued.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith, 26, sued in federal court after the NCAA said she was  
ineligible for the volleyball teams at two schools where she did 
postgraduate work. 
</P>
<P>
	``I want to establish a precedent, so other intercollegiate  
athletes don't have to start at zero,'' Smith said outside the 
court building Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA first judged her ineligible in 1993, based on the  
sports organization's rules. Although Smith had two years of 
eligibility remaining after her early graduation from St. 
Bonaventure in upstate New York, she lost them when she moved to 
Hofstra in Hempstead, N.Y., for graduate school, the NCAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA refused to grant Smith a waiver.  
</P>
<P>
	Smith tried again when she moved on to law school at the  
University of Pittsburgh in 1995. Again, the NCAA denied her a 
waiver. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith sued in 1996, after completing her first year of law  
school, alleging that the NCAA was more inclined to grant waivers 
to male student athletes. 
</P>
<P>
	Her lawyer, Carter Phillips, argued that the NCAA ought to be  
subject to the same anti-discrimination rules as its member 
universities. 
</P>
<P>
	``You can't stop at the federal funds recipient'' such as a  
university, Phillips told the court. ``You have to go beyond 
that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The NCAA claims it actually grants waivers to women more often  
than men. The raw numbers of waivers are much higher for men 
because far more men ask for them, the NCAA said. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Supreme Court is not deciding whether the NCAA does or  
does not favor male athletes -- only whether Smith may continue her 
lawsuit. 
</P>
<P>
	``We dispute the case on the merits, but the merits are not  
before the court,'' NCAA lawyer Roberts said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith wants the case sent back to a trial court, where she can  
seek more evidence about the NCAA's practices. She could lose all 
legal avenues if the justices rule the NCAA is exempt from Title 
IX. 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg seemed sympathetic to Smith's  
difficulties framing her original legal argument without help from 
a full-fledged lawyer. 
</P>
<P>
	``Usually before you cut off a plaintiff's head you allow him a  
chance to flesh out an allegation,'' she said. 
</P>
<P>
	The case is NCAA vs. Smith, 98-84.

<HEADLINE> NYC Mayor Touts Film, TV Industry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Producers of commercials, feature films, TV  
shows and music videos spent $2.5 billion in the city in 1998, 
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The amount of money spent by the industry expanded for the fifth  
consecutive year and tax revenues generated by those productions 
climbed nearly 80 percent over five years, to $257 million in 1998, 
Giuliani said. 
</P>
<P>
	``It does interrupt things,'' the mayor conceded, but quickly  
added the industry creates jobs for New Yorkers. 
</P>
<P>
	As for grumbling about crowded streets, glaring lights and  
noise, ``There's a balance that has to be achieved,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Film and TV crews logged nearly 23,000 shooting days last year --  
up from about 15,000 in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	Residents on some streets feel overrun, said Alan Jay Gerson,  
chairman of the community board that covers the popular shooting 
locations like Greenwich Village and Soho in Manhattan. 
</P>
<P>
	``They have these big vehicles they use for makeup, idling their  
motors. There are lights shining into people's eyes,'' Gerson said. 
``There needs to be a greater sensitivity to the human impact.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The most dramatic increase in production in 1998 was in feature  
films, which climbed from 4,200 shooting days in 1997 to nearly 
5,000 last year. The number of commercials shot on city streets 
dropped in 1996 and 1997, but rebounded in 1998 to 3,700. That's 
down from a peak of nearly 5,000 in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The city has no written policy for deciding if a crew is allowed  
to shoot in a particular neighborhood, but each permit application 
is reviewed by city officials who determine if the site is 
acceptable. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is no written policy because every production request is  
different, and every neighborhood is different,'' said Julianne 
Cho, a spokeswoman for the city Office of Film, Theater and 
Broadcasting.

<HEADLINE> Fed To Stand Pat on Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Last year, with the global economy threatening  
to spin out of control following the collapse of the Russian ruble, 
the Federal Reserve came to the rescue with a string of interest 
rate cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	But economists are not looking for that pattern to be repeated  
now that the global crisis has jumped to Brazil. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, the widespread belief is that the central bank will  
remain on the sidelines for now, expressing watchful concern about 
developments in Latin America but constrained from lowering rates 
further by a U.S. economy that, despite the global crisis, has 
shown little sign of slowing. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Fed eased pre-emptively in late 1998. What did it get for  
this?'' said Paul Kasriel, chief economist at Northern Trust Co. in 
Chicago. ``An economy stronger than it bargained for and a stock 
market higher than the Fed feels is justified.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Fed's views on the 18-month-old global financial crisis,  
which last week struck in Brazil, were to be revealed today with an 
appearance by Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan before the 
House Ways and Means Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	The appearance marked Greenspan's first congressional testimony  
on the economy since September. At that time, financial markets in 
the United States and around the world were plunging as investors 
feared that the global crisis that began in Asia in mid-1997 had 
entered a new and far more virulent phase with the decision by 
Russia to default on billions of dollars in foreign debt. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan declared then that the Fed was ready to prevent the  
market turmoil from ``really spilling over and creating some very 
significant difficulties for all of us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He followed up that pledge with three rapid-fire reductions in  
the central bank's federal funds rate, the interest that banks 
charge each other on overnight loans. The last reduction on Nov. 17 
pushed the funds rate down to 4.75 percent, its lowest level in 
four years. 
</P>
<P>
	Those Fed rate cuts were enough to do the trick, calming  
investor fears and pushing U.S. stock prices back into record 
territory. The renewed investor confidence helped the U.S. economy 
weather the pummeling applied to American factories and farms by 
the big loss in export sales to Asia. 
</P>
<P>
	Bolstered by a confident consumer sector, the overall economy  
was probably growing at a brisk 4 percent annual rate in the 
just-completed October-December quarter, many analysts believe, a 
growth rate that pushed unemployment back down to a three-decade 
low of 4.3 percent. In December, the current expansion notched 
another record, becoming at 93 months the longest peacetime period 
of uninterrupted growth in U.S. history. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economists are looking for growth to slow markedly in 1999  
as the drag from foreign turmoil finally begins to bite. But the 
slowdown has yet to occur and for that reason, economists don't 
believe Greenspan is likely to signal any change in Fed policy. 
</P>
<P>
	While the rapid U.S. growth rate and low unemployment would  
normally have the central bank pondering rate increases because of 
inflation fears, prices have continued to be well-behaved. Consumer 
inflation was up just 1.6 percent last year, capping the best 
back-to-back inflation performance in 33 years. 
</P>
<P>
	The combination of a strong U.S. economy and unsettled  
conditions overseas will keep the central bank on hold at least 
through the first half of this year, analysts said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The bottom line is that the Fed will stand pat and not do  
anything,'' said Sung Won Sohn, chief economist at Wells Fargo in 
Minneapolis.

<HEADLINE> Calif. Lawmakers Urge Bush To Run </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SACRAMENTO, Calif. (AP) -- Twenty-five California legislators on  
Wednesday called on Texas Gov. George W. Bush to run for president, 
saying his education policies and ``compassionate conservatism'' 
make him the strongest candidate in a growing GOP field. 
</P>
<P>
	``He represents to me a new generation of Republican leaders,  
and I think that's what the country needs in 2000,'' Assemblyman 
Bill Leonard said. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition was signed by 22 of 32 Republicans in the state  
Assembly and three of 15 Republican senators. They represent 
moderates and conservatives, and included all four Hispanic 
Republicans. 
</P>
<P>
	Their petition was sent to Bush one day after he was sworn in  
for a second term. Bush has not announced whether he will run for 
president, but some polls put him in front of all other comers. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm sure Governor Bush very much appreciates their words of  
support,'' said Karen Hughes, Bush's director of communications. 
</P>
<P>
	The petition and the accompanying rhetoric represent a double  
slap to California's last Republican governor, Pete Wilson, who is 
considering a White House run himself. Some Republicans believe 
Wilson cost the party dearly by fostering racial divisiveness with 
his stands against aid to illegal immigrants and against 
affirmative action.

<HEADLINE> Caterpillar Profits Down 33 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PEORIA, Ill. (AP) -- Caterpillar Inc. saw its fourth-quarter  
profits tumble 33 percent as global financial turmoil reduced 
demand for its heavy machinery. 
</P>
<P>
	Strong sales of smaller equipment failed to offset the losses,  
the company said. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar's net income for the period ending Dec. 31 fell to  
$301 million, or 83 cents a diluted share, from $451 million, or 
$1.20 a diluted share, in the comparable period a year earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	The results matched Wall Street expectations, according to a  
survey of analysts by First Call Corp. Shares closed down 75 cents 
on the New York Stock Exchange, to $45.18 3/4 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had lowered their fourth-quarter profit expectations  
after Caterpillar warned in December that price-cutting and 
discounting of heavy equipment by its rivals would hurt earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Worldwide sales rose 4.2 percent to $5.41 billion from $5.19  
billion, the company reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Donald Fites, chief executive officer and chairman, called the  
profit solid in the face of declines in overseas sales and spending 
on Caterpillar's purchase of the British engine maker Perkins in 
1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the weaker fourth-quarter results, 1998 was  
Caterpillar's second most profitable year ever. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar earned $1.51 billion for the year, 6 percent less  
than in the record-setting year of 1997, when the company earned 
$1.67 billion. Stockholders earned $4.11 per diluted share for the 
year, down 6 percent from $4.37 per diluted share in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar saw North American machinery and engine sales creep  
up to slightly more than half of all worldwide sales, while 
recessions, low commodity rates and cuts in overseas government 
spending contributed to poor sales in Asia, Africa and Latin 
America. 
</P>
<P>
	Caterpillar forecast a moderate decline in sales, revenues and  
profits for 1999, citing low demand for construction and mining 
machinery.

<HEADLINE> Construction Worker Buried Alive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- A construction worker buried alive when the  
wall of a trench collapsed was being kept alive Wednesday by an 
oxygen line as rescue crews feverishly worked to extricate him. 
</P>
<P>
	Only the man's hand was visible to the 60 rescue workers, who  
were called to the site Wednesday afternoon, said Bob Collis of the 
Los Angeles Fire Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The man was alive and was able to move his hand, he said.  
</P>
<P>
	``There's air going down to him and he's communicating with  
(rescue workers),'' Collis said. ``But we don't know if he's 
hurt.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The rescue workers were shoring up the side walls of the trench  
to prevent a further collapse, Collis said. Crews also used a 
machine called an ``air knife,'' which works like a big vacuum. 
They also carried dirt out with buckets. 
</P>
<P>
	Southern Pacific railroad and Metrolink trains that run on the  
tracks next to the construction site were stopped out of fear that 
the vibration could cause further collapse of the tench. One train 
was carrying 260 people. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people will be late for dinner,'' Collis said.  
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known what sort of construction was being  
done at the site, about 10 miles north of downtown.

<HEADLINE> 1999 Budget Fight Is Now Redefined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As lawmakers begin their second year of  
battling over federal surpluses, President Clinton has helped 
transform what may be this year's most over-arching legislative 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The nature of the battle was altered last week when Senate  
Republican budget analysts estimated that federal surpluses over 
the next decade could be $600 billion larger than was expected just 
six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But by proposing to spend part of those huge projected federal  
surpluses on programs besides Social Security, Clinton reshaped 
that fight once again. It has begun evolving from a debate over 
whether to use hundreds of billions of dollars for programs besides 
Social Security into a struggle over which ones will benefit -- tax 
cuts like Republicans want or domestic spending like Democrats 
prefer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the issue of the day,'' Senate Budget Committee  
Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said Wednesday regarding GOP 
demands to use part of the surplus for tax cuts. ``I've stated the 
issue that will be with us the rest of this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clinton declared ``Save Social Security first.'' That  
became code for leaving surpluses untouched until Democrats and 
Republicans agree on girding Social Security for the impending 
retirement of baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	And because of the political popularity of the pension program  
for the elderly, the line effectively blocked Republicans from 
winning tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Clinton  
repeated his plea to fix Social Security before anything else. But 
he added a new twist, saying only 62 percent of the enormous $4.4 
trillion in surpluses expected over the next 15 years is needed to 
bolster Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest -- about $1.7 trillion -- should then be spent on  
Medicare, new retirement accounts for Americans, and defense and 
domestic programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials emphasize that Clinton would still oppose  
using any of the surplus for anything at all until a Social 
Security cure is enacted. 
</P>
<P>
	But for many Republicans, Clinton's words gave them political  
cover for proposing to use the remaining $1.7 trillion mostly for 
tax cuts, and perhaps other purposes like defense and education. 
After all, if Clinton had said those dollars are not needed for 
shoring up Social Security, why not use them for cutting taxes, 
they reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a huge difference'' between last year and this, said  
Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., a moderate who has moved from opposing 
tax cuts last year to favoring them now. ``He's gone from using 100 
percent of the surplus for Social Security to 60. We'd be in an 
untenable position if we didn't save some of it for taxpayers, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly fair to say the budget situation looks  
different,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., another moderate who 
said his doubts about tax cuts last year have been replaced by 
support. ``It has evolved considerably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comments like those are crucial because skepticism among  
moderate Republican senators helped kill last year's GOP tax 
reduction drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Other moderates, including Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said  
Wednesday that they still prefer narrow tax cuts to broad ones. But 
GOP leaders, who have united initially behind an across-the-board 
10 percent income tax cut, believe they will likely have more 
Republican support for cutting taxes than they did a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats, particularly liberals, might also be more  
inclined this year to insist on using surpluses for higher spending 
on domestic programs. Already, liberal Sen. Paul Wellstone, 
D-Minn., has called Clinton's speech ``wanting'' because he didn't 
propose enough to improve health care, child care and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	But House Democrats questioned Wednesday said they still wanted  
to heed Clinton's call to leave surpluses alone until Social 
Security's problems are solved. They realize their party's claim to 
protect the program is a valuable political tool to use against 
Republicans, especially looking ahead to a 2000 election in which 
they have a chance to capture House control. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always temptation in life,'' said Rep. Robert  
Menendez, D-N.J., a member of the House Democratic leadership, 
regarding the billions that could be available to help domestic 
programs. ``But I think it's a temptation that will be overcome.''

<HEADLINE> Clinton Concedes on Social Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton is making dramatic  
concessions to Republicans on revamping Social Security, but the 
spotty GOP response to his State of the Union address shows that 
bitter fights lie ahead on the retirement program, tax cuts and 
White House plans for higher spending. 
</P>
<P>
	``Are you willing to fight for his agenda? That's what it's  
going to take!'' Vice President Al Gore bellowed to a roar of 
applause at a campaign-style, morning-after rally today in Buffalo, 
N.Y. 
</P>
<P>
	Barely six hours after the Senate ended another day in Clinton's  
impeachment trial, the president strode Tuesday night into the 
House chamber and confidently delivered a 77-minute speech laden 
with proposals ranging from more defense spending to helping 
communities fight pollution. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also announced the Justice Department would sue the  
tobacco industry, and that he would again seek a tax increase on 
cigarettes, this time 55 cents a pack. It drew an icy response from 
Republicans, as it did last year. 
</P>
<P>
	A centerpiece of Clinton's speech -- a plan to let the government  
invest some Social Security's money in the stock market -- drew fire 
today from Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan, who said it 
could hurt the economy. Even as he voiced a preference for more 
money being used to reduce the national debt, the influential 
Greenspan endorsed Clinton's idea of putting 62 percent of the 
budget surplus into Social Security's cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Nonetheless, many Republicans said they sensed chances for  
accommodation this year on Social Security, defense, education and 
patients' rights. Still, GOP leaders emphasized the differences 
that remained -- including Clinton's omission of tax cuts as a way 
to use federal surpluses projected to total an enormous $4.4 
trillion over the next 15 years. 
</P>
<P>
	``A $4 trillion surplus, and not a penny for tax cuts?'' House  
Majority Leader Dick Armey, R-Texas, said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't work this hard to get a balanced budget to ... spend  
it all on new programs,'' said the Senate Budget Committee 
chairman, Sen. Pete Domenici, R-N.M. 
</P>
<P>
	House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt, D-Mo., said today that  
Clinton ``has stepped out smartly with a very, very creative, and I 
think, a sound, plan'' to safeguard Social Security. Interviewed on 
ABC's ``Good Morning America,'' Gephardt said he expects the 
president to flesh out his proposal in the next few weeks and 
called on House and Republican leaders to schedule hearings as soon 
as possible so the problem can be resolved this year. 
</P>
<P>
	Polls indicated more than three-quarters of Americans surveyed  
approved of what Clinton said. And his job-approval ratings rose 
after his speech -- to 66 percent in an ABC News poll, from 63 
percent a week earlier, and to 72 percent in a CBS News poll, up 
from 67 percent. He registered similar gains after his address a 
year ago. The polls have error margins of 4.5 percent and 4 
percent, respectively. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's audience on the House floor -- Democrats sitting to his  
right, Republicans to his left -- reacted throughout as if listening 
to two different speeches. Democrats lustily cheered his entrance, 
and led the way in interrupting his address 95 times with applause. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans were unusually quiet, with many often not responding  
to what might normally be GOP applause lines, like Clinton's 
prediction of budget surpluses for the next 25 years. Small numbers 
of them didn't attend, and many who did conceded that it felt eerie 
listening to a president whom their party has pushed to the brink 
of removal from office. 
</P>
<P>
	``Of course it was awkward,'' Sen. John Ashcroft, R-Mo., said.  
``But does that mean it shouldn't have happened? Not necessarily.'' 
</P>
<P>
	As Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott left the chamber,  
photographers overheard him asking a companion whether Clinton had 
``no shame.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton made no mention of the sex and cover-up case that led to  
his impeachment and imperils his presidency. 
</P>
<P>
	Armey and House Majority Whip Tom DeLay, R-Texas, sat side by  
side looking pained and bored, applauding only for spectators whom 
Clinton introduced, such as civil rights figure Rosa Parks and 
Chicago Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't mean to look grim,'' Armey said later. ``Obviously,  
we were all concerned about how we were going to respond to the 
president, and I had made up my mind ahead of time I would applaud 
everything he said that I thought was good for the country and 
where I thought he actually meant it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Yet there was periodic applause from other Republicans,  
including new House Speaker Dennis Hastert, R-Ill. -- in his first 
State of the Union sitting on the rostrum behind the president -- 
and from Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	Early on, Clinton cited Hastert's call for bipartisanship and  
said, ``Mr. Speaker, let's do exactly that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton then used his remarks to take some giant steps toward  
GOP demands for shoring up Social Security for the baby boomers, 
which he said would keep the program afloat until 2055. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather than insisting that all federal surpluses be left  
untouched until the Social Security problem is resolved, as he said 
last year, he said only 62 percent of the money -- $2.7 trillion 
over 15 years -- was needed for the program. 
</P>
<P>
	Many Republicans have insisted that surpluses are going to be  
big enough to help Social Security and cut taxes, too. Clinton's 
new plan moves that debate forward. 
</P>
<P>
	For the first time, Clinton embraced investing up to one-fourth  
of the new Social Security funds in the stock market -- an idea 
favored by many Republicans. Clinton wants a government board to 
make the investment decisions. GOP lawmakers would prefer that 
individuals have their own accounts and make their own investment 
choices. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also endorsed giving part of the surplus to individuals  
to invest in new, personal retirement accounts, another idea many 
Republicans have pushed. 
</P>
<P>
	``I reach out my hand to all of you in both houses and both  
parties and ask that we join together in saying to the American 
people: We will save Social Security now,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton wants to use the rest of the surpluses to strengthen  
Medicare and for defense and domestic programs. He would spend 
billions for new programs in child care, education, crime-fighting, 
the environment and the military. He also called for raising the 
minimum wage by $1 an hour over two years to $6.15. 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans prefer using the leftover money for a 10 percent,  
across-the-board income tax cut. 
</P>
<P>
	And the GOP has pushed its own bills for schools, anti-crime  
programs and defense. Both sides want to give managed-care patients 
more power in dealing with health-care providers. That gives the 
two parties common ground, many Republicans said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was very energized by much of what I heard,'' said Rep.  
David Dreier, R-Calif.

<HEADLINE> Russian Athletes Waiting for Money </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Russia's government still hasn't paid most Russian  
medalists their prize money from the 1998 Winter Olympics at 
Nagano, the head of Russia's ski federation said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am confident that our money was stolen,'' Anatoly Akentev  
told the Russian newspaper Kommersant in a story published 
Wednesday. ``I am ready to prove my words any place, any time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The report did not cite any evidence, however, or say how much  
money was missing. 
</P>
<P>
	Russian athletes won nine gold medals, six silver and three  
bronze at last year's games. In addition to the official Olympic 
winnings, the medalists were promised special bonuses by President 
Boris Yeltsin -- up to $50,000 extra for each gold medal. 
</P>
<P>
	But that was before Russia's ruble and financial markets  
collapsed and the government went into partial default on major 
debts. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian Bank for Reconstruction and Development, which was  
charged with distributing the money, said it hadn't been able to 
pay out the winnings because of Russia's financial crisis, 
Kommersant reported. 
</P>
<P>
	Akentyev also blamed the problem on bureaucratic delays. He said  
only a handful of the athletes, coaches, doctors and technical 
staff had received any money from the government for their work at 
the Olympics. 
</P>
<P>
	The Russian ski team won five gold medals, two silver and one  
bronze medal.

<HEADLINE> 1999 Budget Fight Is Now Redefined </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- As lawmakers begin their second year of  
battling over federal surpluses, President Clinton has helped 
transform what may be this year's most over-arching legislative 
issue. 
</P>
<P>
	The nature of the battle was altered last week when Senate  
Republican budget analysts estimated that federal surpluses over 
the next decade could be $600 billion larger than was expected just 
six months ago. 
</P>
<P>
	But by proposing to spend part of those huge projected federal  
surpluses on programs besides Social Security, Clinton reshaped 
that fight once again. It has begun evolving from a debate over 
whether to use hundreds of billions of dollars for programs besides 
Social Security into a struggle over which ones will benefit -- tax 
cuts like Republicans want or domestic spending like Democrats 
prefer. 
</P>
<P>
	``That's the issue of the day,'' Senate Budget Committee  
Chairman Pete Domenici, R-N.M., said Wednesday regarding GOP 
demands to use part of the surplus for tax cuts. ``I've stated the 
issue that will be with us the rest of this year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, Clinton declared ``Save Social Security first.'' That  
became code for leaving surpluses untouched until Democrats and 
Republicans agree on girding Social Security for the impending 
retirement of baby boomers. 
</P>
<P>
	And because of the political popularity of the pension program  
for the elderly, the line effectively blocked Republicans from 
winning tax cuts. 
</P>
<P>
	In his State of the Union address Tuesday night, Clinton  
repeated his plea to fix Social Security before anything else. But 
he added a new twist, saying only 62 percent of the enormous $4.4 
trillion in surpluses expected over the next 15 years is needed to 
bolster Social Security. 
</P>
<P>
	The rest -- about $1.7 trillion -- should then be spent on  
Medicare, new retirement accounts for Americans, and defense and 
domestic programs, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials emphasize that Clinton would still oppose  
using any of the surplus for anything at all until a Social 
Security cure is enacted. 
</P>
<P>
	But for many Republicans, Clinton's words gave them political  
cover for proposing to use the remaining $1.7 trillion mostly for 
tax cuts, and perhaps other purposes like defense and education. 
After all, if Clinton had said those dollars are not needed for 
shoring up Social Security, why not use them for cutting taxes, 
they reason. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's a huge difference'' between last year and this, said  
Sen. Gordon Smith, R-Ore., a moderate who has moved from opposing 
tax cuts last year to favoring them now. ``He's gone from using 100 
percent of the surplus for Social Security to 60. We'd be in an 
untenable position if we didn't save some of it for taxpayers, 
too.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It's certainly fair to say the budget situation looks  
different,'' said Sen. Slade Gorton, R-Wash., another moderate who 
said his doubts about tax cuts last year have been replaced by 
support. ``It has evolved considerably.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Comments like those are crucial because skepticism among  
moderate Republican senators helped kill last year's GOP tax 
reduction drive. 
</P>
<P>
	Other moderates, including Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said  
Wednesday that they still prefer narrow tax cuts to broad ones. But 
GOP leaders, who have united initially behind an across-the-board 
10 percent income tax cut, believe they will likely have more 
Republican support for cutting taxes than they did a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Some Democrats, particularly liberals, might also be more  
inclined this year to insist on using surpluses for higher spending 
on domestic programs. Already, liberal Sen. Paul Wellstone, 
D-Minn., has called Clinton's speech ``wanting'' because he didn't 
propose enough to improve health care, child care and schools. 
</P>
<P>
	But House Democrats questioned Wednesday said they still wanted  
to heed Clinton's call to leave surpluses alone until Social 
Security's problems are solved. They realize their party's claim to 
protect the program is a valuable political tool to use against 
Republicans, especially looking ahead to a 2000 election in which 
they have a chance to capture House control. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's always temptation in life,'' said Rep. Robert  
Menendez, D-N.J., a member of the House Democratic leadership, 
regarding the billions that could be available to help domestic 
programs. ``But I think it's a temptation that will be overcome.''

<HEADLINE> NY Fed Chief Downplays Brazil Woes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- After meeting with Brazil's finance minister  
Wednesday, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York 
said Brazil's economic crisis is not a threat to the U.S. financial 
system. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have no concern at all about systemic risk coming from any  
country, including'' Brazil, William McDonough said. ``I believe 
the United States banking system is sound and solid.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Brazil churned world markets last week when it devalued its  
currency, the real, and then let it float on world foreign 
exchanges without government attempts to prop up its value. While 
the real plunged, financial markets were relieved once Brazil 
stopped spending billions of dollars to defend its currency. 
</P>
<P>
	There continue to be worries over Brazil, Latin America's  
largest economy, on top of the problems in Asia and Russia over the 
past 18 months. There are about 2,000 U.S. multinational 
corporations with dealings in Brazil and U.S. banks have great 
exposure there and in the region. 
</P>
<P>
	But McDonough said that by using the standard tools to gauge an  
economy's strength, such as the ratio of debt to gross domestic 
product, there is no need to renegotiate Brazil's foreign debt. 
Recovering those debts ``are not a problem for U.S. institutions,'' 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough is the U.S. Treasury's banker and currency dealer,  
with the New York Fed carrying out transactions in bond and foreign 
exchange markets to implement monetary policy. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough's comments about Brazil not having to renegotiate its  
foreign debt brought relief in some corners of the foreign exchange 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	Hillel Waxman, chief foreign exchange dealer at Bank Leumi USA,  
said that if McDonough doesn't see a need for renegotiating debt, 
then ``it means he sees some sense of stabilization for the market 
place.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``This means he sees some type of light at the end of the  
tunnel, and there won't be a Russia case or a Venezuela,'' Waxman 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	McDonough spent the morning meeting with Brazil's finance  
minister, Pedro Malan, along with representatives from the world of 
private finance, including billionaire investor George Soros. The 
New York Fed president's comments came later in the day during a 
speaking engagement at the Japan Society. 
</P>
<P>
	``It was basically an exchange of views,'' said McDonough, where  
Malan asked for suggestions. Malan arrived in Washington on Friday, 
conferring with officials from the U.S. Treasury, the International 
Monetary Fund, the World Bank and others. 
</P>
<P>
	Malan has been trying to reassure those officials his country  
can persevere during this crisis but he wanted a $9 billion 
installment of an IMF-led rescue package that includes a $41.5 
billion emergency line of credit. Brazil already has received about 
$9 billion.

	Greenspan Expresses Stock Worries  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan  
expressed concern over the high-flying stock market today, although 
he also noted that the economy is performing splendidly. He said 
it's unusual for stocks to be climbing to record levels, as they 
have been, while corporate profits, the underpinning of stock 
prices, have been weaker. He told the House Ways and Means 
Committee that a fall in stock prices could spill over quickly into 
the real economy, given that consumers spend more when their net 
worth is rising and less when they face reversals. Greenspan gave 
no indication that the Fed may be likely to change interest rates 
soon.

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip stocks gave back strong early gains in  
the final hour of today's session to close lower on the day, after 
investors sold their holdings to lock in profits. The Dow Jones 
industrial closed down 19.31 at 9,335.91. The Dow got as high as 
9,480.09, up nearly 125, before sellers stepped in late in the 
session. Most broader indexes ended higher, but technology stocks 
trimmed strong early gains as well. The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 rose 
4.61 to 1,256.61, and the technology-heavy Nasdaq composite index

	Greenspan Criticizes Social Security Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today  
criticized a key part of President Clinton's Social Security rescue 
plan. He said the government could damage the economy by investing 
huge sums of money in the stock market. Greenspan said he supports 
Clinton's major idea to put 62 percent of the government's budget 
surpluses into Social Security's cash reserves. But he said he had 
serious objections about allowing a government board to direct 
about a quarter of those savings into stock market investments. ``I 
do not believe that it is politically feasible to insulate such 
huge funds from government direction,'' Greenspan told the House 
Ways and Means Committee.

	Housing Starts Rise to 11-Year High  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Housing construction shot to 11-year highs in  
both December and all of 1998. Record home sales propelled the 
drive, the Commerce Department said today. Builders started 
construction on new units at a seasonally adjusted 1.72 million 
units last month, the most since March 1987, The December increase 
was 3.5 percent. Unseasonably mild weather during the early part of 
December helped boost housing starts by 25 percent, particularly in 
the Midwest, where they soared 25 percent to a seasonally adjusted 
414,000, the most in nearly 12 years.

	DETROIT (AP) -- Analysts say General Motors Corp. is finally  
awakening after years of restructuring, labor unrest, cost-cutting 
and overhauling its vast line of cars and trucks. GM turned in 
stronger-than-expected results in its North American automotive 
operations, more than offsetting losses in Asia and Latin America 
and enabling the world's largest automaker to post a record 
fourth-quarter profit of $1.8 billion. Analyst Scott Merlis of 
Wasserstein Perella Securities Inc. said: ``A much healthier GM is 
emerging from the one we once knew.'' GM stock was 15/16 to 88 
15/16.

	GE Has Record Profit in 4th Quarter  
</P>
<P>
	FAIRFIELD, Conn. (AP) -- Profit at General Electric Co. rose 13.7  
percent to set a record in the fourth quarter, meeting analysts' 
expectations. The industrial and financial service giant passed 
another milestone as annual revenue topped $100 billion for the 
first time. GE said profit in the final three months of 1998 rose 
to $2.67 billion, or 80 cents a diluted share, from $2.35 billion, 
or 70 cents a share, a year earlier. Per share profit rose faster 
than overall earnings as a result of a $17 billion stock buyback 
program that began in 1994 and has reduced the number of shares 
outstanding. Despite the good figures, GE stock fell 1 1/16 to 100.

	Weyerhaeuser Profit Down 69 Percent

	FEDERAL WAY, Wash. (AP) -- Low prices for wood products are

fourth quarter were down 69 percent. Weyerhaeuser had net earnings 
of $30 million or 15 cents a diluted share for the quarter ended 
Dec. 27, compared with profits of $98 million or 49 cents a share a 
year earlier. Revenues were $2.75 billion, down from $2.87 billion. 
The most recent net earnings include a one-time charge of $45 
million, primarily for streamlining pulp and paper operations and 
closing a chemical plant in Longview. In fourth-quarter 1997, 
Weyerhaeuser took a $10 million charge.

	Microsoft Trial Discusses Contracts

<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government sought in court today to  
portray Microsoft Corp. as a jealous master who enforced fidelity 
with corporate contracts so restrictive they violated federal 
antitrust laws. Turning to what legal experts consider some of the 
strongest evidence against Microsoft, the government asked an 
economist testifying for the company about alleged exclusionary 
agreements with the nation's computer makers and Internet 
providers. Microsoft limits, for example, how PC makers can alter 
the basic appearance of its dominant Windows operating system, such 
as by preventing them from hiding or removing easy access to some 
preinstalled software including Microsoft's Internet browser.

	American Airlines Has Weak Quarter

<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, said  
today fourth-quarter profits slipped 12.5 percent compared to the 
same period last year because of decreasing demands in the 
international market. The nation's second-largest airline earned 
$167 million, or $1 per diluted share, after a $15 million one-time 
charge related to food costs on flights. Analysts had expected 
earnings of about $1.16 a diluted share. America West Holdings 
Corp., which owns the airline America West and The Leisure Company, 
earned $20.15 million, or 51 cents per share, in the fourth 
quarter, up from $20.09 million, or 43 cents a share in last year's 
fourth quarter. AMR Corp. stocks were down 4 7/16 at 59 13/16.

are packaged separately and do not contain any pork products ... 
implies that these products were placed in the food 
intentionally,'' according to the investigator's report. Two 
Muslims, Abdussalam Sipes and Clarence Watson, had filed a 
religious discrimination complaint with the bureau, seeking an 
apology and $1 million each. If the two sides cannot settle the 
complaint, it will go before a Human Rights Bureau hearing officer.

introduced in Japan as early as next year. The deal comes as 
Japanese banks struggle to dispose of piles of bad loans left from 
the collapse of property prices nearly a decade ago. Many banks

<HEADLINE> Salt Lake Bribery Report Prepared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The lead IOC investigator into the Olympics'  
biggest scandal met with lawyers Wednesday to complete his report, 
while marketing chiefs said the bribery case has made at least two 
potential sponsors skittish. 
</P>
<P>
	Dick Pound, an International Olympic Committee vice president  
from Canada, and IOC director general Francois Carrard tried to 
work out final details of the month-long investigation that is 
expected to recommend the expulsion of eight committee members. 
</P>
<P>
	The report is scheduled to be released in Lausanne, Switzerland,  
on Sunday. The Wall Street Journal said Wednesday a draft version 
implicated as many as 16 IOC members and warned committee officials 
they might be subpoenaed by the Justice Department in its inquiry. 
</P>
<P>
	Since the scandal broke last month with news that Salt Lake City  
gave college scholarships to relatives of IOC members as part of 
the winning bid for the 2002 Winter Games, committee officials have 
relentlessly tried to convince corporate sponsors that their 
multimillion-dollar Olympic investments would not be tainted. 
</P>
<P>
	And while they reiterated that all sponsors remained committed  
to their Olympic contracts as the scandal grew to include cash, 
free medical care and lavish gifts, they said for the first time 
that the bribery allegations had affected negotiations in progress. 
</P>
<P>
	John Krimsky, the U.S. Olympic Committee's marketing director,  
said two companies that were close to final agreement on Salt Lake 
City sponsorships had ``asked that the announcement of sponsorship 
be withheld until the results of the investigation are behind us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The negotiations are ongoing. I believe they are solid,''  
Krimsky said. ``But until there is a signed contract, they could 
back out.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Krimsky refused to identify the companies but said their  
involvement would be ``above entry level,'' each worth more than 
$25 million in cash and services. 
</P>
<P>
	Salt Lake still has almost $250 million in sponsorships to raise  
toward its $1.453 billion budget, with Krimsky overseeing the 
project in a partnership between the USOC and the Salt Lake 
Organizing Committee. 
</P>
<P>
	He and IOC marketing director Michael Payne told reporters they  
remained confident the full amount would be raised and that the 
scandal would not affect the Salt Lake Winter Games themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	Payne, who has spent much of the last month reassuring the IOC's  
biggest sponsors, also said the corporations were most concerned 
that the scandal be dealt with quickly and completely. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want us to get to the bottom of this. That is exactly  
what we are doing,'' Payne said. ``I told the sponsors the IOC 
wants to deal with any improprieties of any dimension. That the IOC 
is in control of rooting out improprieties. That the 2002 Winter 
Games will be held in Salt Lake City and be a success. That the IOC 
will be open in its response.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The inquiries by Pound and the Justice Department are among five  
investigations of the bribery scandal, along with those ordered by 
the USOC, SLOC and the state of Utah. 
</P>
<P>
	The Salt Lake committee's report is expected to follow quickly  
on the heels of Pound's findings, with the USOC panel headed by 
former Senate Majority Leader George Mitchell reporting by the end 
of February. 
</P>
<P>
	Subpoenas have been issued through a federal grand jury in Salt  
Lake that reportedly is looking at possible tax and bribery 
charges. An FBI spokesman said that investigation could take 
months. 
</P>
<P>
	Utah Attorney General Jan Graham said Wednesday that her inquiry  
won't begin until the SLOC and IOC reports on their investigations 
are released. 
</P>
<P>
	It's the Justice Department review and the threat of criminal  
prosecution that appears to have the IOC most concerned. The draft 
report quoted in the Journal called it ``the biggest potential 
problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It also showed that the IOC will try to convince federal  
authorities that no laws had been broken. 
</P>
<P>
	``There may have been questionable and objectionable behavior,  
but nothing criminal,'' the draft said. 
</P>
<P>
	Trying to explain the American legal system to a 115-member  
international assembly, the report also said that the IOC would 
``have to consider'' what to do if it was subpoenaed to appear 
before the grand jury. It tried to explain the dangers with a case 
known around the world. 
</P>
<P>
	``This is a particularly odious procedural part of criminal law,  
in which the accused virtually have no rights,'' the draft said. 
``It was a grand jury that dealt with Clinton matters.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pound and Carrard were in day-long conferences working on the  
report, Payne and IOC spokesmen said. Payne, who works closely with 
Pound on marketing deals and has been in touch with the vice 
president daily during the scandal, said he did not know what was 
in the report. 
</P>
<P>
	Messages left for Pound at his hotel and the offices of  
O'Melveny &AMP; Myers, the IOC's law firm, were not immediately 
returned. 
</P>
<P>
	In other developments:  
</P>
<P>
	-- Some IOC officials inspecting Nagano as a site for the 1998  
Winter Games were entertained by geisha paid by the city's bidders, 
a bid official said. Sumikazu Yamaguchi, a senior member of the 
bidding committee, said all the geishas did ``was pour drinks and 
perform Japanese dance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	-- A day after Finnish IOC member Pirjo Haeggman became the first  
international official to resign in the scandal, questions have 
been raised another member from Finland. The former head of 
Toronto's failed 1996 Olympic bid said he hired the son of Peter 
Tallberg, the head of the IOC athletes' commission, to work at his 
plumbing company and had the young man live at his home. Tallberg 
said he and Toronto's Paul Henderson were longtime friends and 
denied any wrongdoing. 
</P>
<P>
	-- Vitaly Smirnov, head of the Russian Olympic Committee and a  
former IOC vice president and executive board member, said the 
bribery scandal was part of a plot to oust IOC president Juan 
Antonio Samaranch. Smirnov has been implicated in the scandal but 
reiterated his innocence in an interview with the Russian daily 
Kommersant. 
</P>
<P>
	Several present and former Olympic officials have called on  
Samaranch to take responsibility for the scandal and resign. Payne 
and Krimsky said that would be wrong, and that no sponsor had 
suggested such a change. 
</P>
<P>
	``President Samaranch has had 20 years of dealing with global  
crises,'' Krimsky said. ``This is the president who has the 
experience and the support of the membership to effect significant 
change.''

<HEADLINE> United May Acquire America West </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- UAL Corp's United Airlines confirmed Wednesday  
night it is in talks to acquire America West Airlines, the nation's 
ninth-largest carrier. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, United Airlines, the nation's largest air  
carrier, said ``it has expressed to America West Airlines an 
interest in a possible acquisition of America West.'' UAL spokesman 
Andy Plews would not elaborate further. 
</P>
<P>
	America West Holdings Corp., the parent of America West, issued  
a separate statement late Wednesday saying it has been contacted by 
a number of airlines expressing interest in a possible deal, 
ranging from a strategic alliance to a merger or similar business 
combination. 
</P>
<P>
	America West did not identify the airlines in its statement and  
said it would have no additional comment on the possible 
discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	An America West spokesman reached Wednesday night also would not  
elaborate. 
</P>
<P>
	United Airlines, based in Elk Grove Village, Ill., serves more  
than 150 destinations in the United States and another 29 
worldwide. Along with Chicago, it has hubs in Denver, London, San 
Francisco, Tokyo, and Washington, DC. 
</P>
<P>
	America West has 111 aircraft, 12,000 employees and hubs in  
Phoenix, its base, Las Vegas and Columbus, Ohio. It flies to more 
than 90 cities in the United States, Mexico and Canada. 
</P>
<P>
	A United-America West pairing would come as the nation's largest  
airlines are vying to achieve market dominance with strategic 
partnerships, alliances and purchases of competitors. 
</P>
<P>
	Pending combinations between Northwest and Continental airlines  
and between American Airlines and British Airways touched a 
scramble to achieve or maintain market dominance, leading United 
last year to propose a sweeping alliance with Delta Air Lines. That 
deal fell apart after Delta pilots balked at approving it unless 
given seats on the board of directors. 
</P>
<P>
	While the airlines have praised their plans for linkages as ways  
to promote seamless global air travel, consumer advocates have said 
they're worried such alliances will mean higher fares for 
passengers. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, there are no laws governing the formation of such  
alliances, although lawmakers and the Clinton administration have 
said they will act if the agreements begin to hurt consumers. 
</P>
<P>
	Any deal between United and America West would likely face  
government scrutiny. Last October, the Justice Department filed a 
lawsuit over the planned purchase by Northwest -- the nation's 
fourth-largest airline -- of a controlling stake in Continental -- 
the nation's fifth-largest -- saying it would reduce competition, 
raise prices for travelers and lower the quality of service. 
</P>
<P>
	United is strongest in the Midwest and West, and its possible  
acquisition of a fast-growing low-cost carrier such as America West 
could serve as a competitive blow to American, Delta and Southwest 
airlines. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, American Airlines reached a deal to require low-cost  
carrier Reno Air in an effort to bulk up its California traffic. 
</P>
<P>
	America West, founded in 1983 as a no-frills carrier with just  
three Boeing 737s, filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in 
1991, saying it had tried to grow too big, too fast and lost too 
much money on its ill-fated service to Nagoya, Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	America West emerged from bankruptcy in 1994 and quickly turned  
a profit as a regional carrier competing in the West with Southwest 
Airlines. In recent years America West has cultivated business 
travelers, who pay more for tickets. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline has been beset with labor problems since emerging  
from bankruptcy. The airline's 2,100 flight attendants have been 
without a contract since voting to unionize in 1994, and have 
threatened to strike. 
</P>
<P>
	The airline fired 375 mechanics in 1995 and began contracting  
heavy aircraft maintenance to outside shops. In July 1998, the 
Federal Aviation Administration hit America West with a $5 million 
fine for lapses in aircraft maintenance and operation. Half of the 
fine was waived as long as the airline complied with maintenance 
and safety regulations. 
</P>
<P>
	Last October, the airline's mechanics signed a five-year  
contract and the airline agreed to rehire some of the mechanics who 
were fired in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Based on Wednesday's closing price of $19.50 on the New York  
Stock Exchange, America West is worth about $880 million. 
</P>
<P>
	UAL shares closed Wednesday on the NYSE at $61.18. 3/4.

<HEADLINE> Mailers Tape Pennies on Envelopes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Confronted with the one-cent increase in  
postage rates a few Americans have resorted to taping pennies on 
envelopes to cover the increased cost. 
</P>
<P>
	The post office would like them to stop.  
</P>
<P>
	Pennies can damage some automatic canceling machines, and if  
they fall off the envelopes they can damage other machinery, postal 
officials said. 
</P>
<P>
	There have been some spot shortages of one-cent stamps, but post  
offices should have plenty of new 33-cent stamps and 1-cent stamps

<HEADLINE> First Lady Cheers President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Smiling often, a relaxed Hillary Rodham  
Clinton applauded frequently as her husband delivered a second 
consecutive State of the Union shadowed by the Monica Lewinsky 
scandal. 
</P>
<P>
	She smiled broadly, applauded and stood when Democrats led the  
chamber in successive standing ovations during President Clinton's 
77-minute address to the nation. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton took her customary front-row seat in the visitors'  
gallery overlooking the House floor, sandwiched between Chicago 
Cubs slugger Sammy Sosa and Loc Truong, a 23-year-old Vietnam 
refugee and AmeriCorps member who mentors high school students in 
California. Tipper Gore and Rosa Parks sat in the same row. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton, after reciting a grab bag of policy proposals and new  
spending initiatives, took time during his speech to pay 
recognition to his wife for spearheading a project celebrating the 
nation's past and its future as the year 2000 draws near. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'd like to take just a minute to honor her, for leading our  
millennium project, for all she's done for our children, for all 
she has done in her historic role to serve our nation and our best 
ideals at home and abroad, I honor her,'' Clinton said, slowly 
emphasizing his last three words. 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Clinton smiled, rose from her seat and mouthed ``Thank  
You'' to the crowd applauding below. 
</P>
<P>
	Last year, news of her husband's relationship with Ms. Lewinsky,  
the former White House intern, became public just a few days before 
his 1998 address, and Mrs. Clinton quickly stepped into the role of 
chief presidential defender. 
</P>
<P>
	In New York that morning, she appeared on NBC's ``Today''  
program and blamed the scandal on a ``vast right-wing conspiracy 
that has been conspiring against my husband since the day he 
announced for president.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That evening, she was in the House gallery listening to her  
husband. 
</P>
<P>
	And the day before that speech, she stood beside Clinton in the  
White House as he issued his own finger-wagging denial of a sexual 
relationship with Ms. Lewinsky.

<HEADLINE> Bulls in Midst of Major Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Normal has never described Dennis Rodman.  
</P>
<P>
	So why should the end of his career be any different? His agent  
says he is retiring. Rodman says he's just taking a year off and 
isn't sure what's ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	For sure, the renegade rebounder whose wild hair colors and  
bountiful body piercings and tattoos made him the NBA's most 
flamboyant and often troubled character, is not coming back to the 
Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-time NBA champions are in the midst of a major overhaul  
following Michael Jordan's retirement. Scottie Pippen is headed to 
Houston, Steve Kerr to San Antonio and Luc Longley to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	You will, indeed, need a program this year to identify the team  
that won six NBA titles this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rodman?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to play this year,'' he told Fox Sports News on  
Tuesday night. ``I am in limbo, but I'm not going to say I'm 
retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier, his West Coast-based agent Dwight Manley said  
Rodman is finished with the game because he wants to go to 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	There was even a rumor swirling that Rodman would be signed and  
then traded to the New York Knicks for Buck Williams. That was 
quickly brushed off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dennis is retiring,'' Manley said, although Rodman has  
considered retiring in each of the last five years. ``He doesn't 
want to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to go into the sports and entertainment field. Some  
people have convinced him that he wants to become a movie star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manley said there are several teams still interested in signing  
the wacky, 37-year-old Rodman, known for his ferocious workouts, 
frequent forays to Las Vegas and an ability to hit the boards that 
led to seven straight rebounding titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley, who said he is severing his relationship with Rodman,  
declined to identify those teams who might want Rodman's services. 
The Bulls traded for him in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman won championships with Chicago in 1996, 1997 and 1998,  
and two titles with the Detroit Pistons in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bulls are rebuilding, shipping out the nucleus of a team  
that won the last three titles. They certainly don't need an aging 
rebounder who doesn't score and causes trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, meanwhile, is the biggest winner in the Bulls  
sweepstakes. He will sign a five-year, $67.2 million deal with the 
Bulls -- with an additional $15 million in incentives -- who will 
then ship him to Houston once the lockout officially ends. In 
return, the Bulls get Roy Rogers -- Trigger not included -- and a 
second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-point specialist Kerr gets a five-year, $11 million deal  
before heading to San Antonio for draft picks. And center Longley 
will get a five-year, $30 million package before being traded to 
Phoenix for Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's off-court activities earned him much more notoriety  
than his rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	He once announced his marriage, only to show up at a New York  
book signing in a wedding gown and blond wig -- sans groom; he 
offended Mormons and was fined $50,000 for making derogatory 
comments during the 1997 finals in Salt Lake City; he skipped 
practice during the NBA Finals last summer to attend a wrestling 
match in Detroit, and later as ``Rodzilla'' teamed with Hulk Hogan 
to beat Karl Malone and Diamond Dallas Page. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew a six-game suspension for head-butting referee Ted  
Bernhardt in 1996 and drew another for 11 games in 1997 for kicking 
a courtside cameraman in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	He was always in trouble, first with the Pistons; then during  
his brief stay in San Antonio, where his behavior damaged Spurs' 
chances at the NBA title; and finally during his three 
championships years with the Bulls, where he became a Chicago fan 
favorite for tossing his jersey into the stands after games. 
</P>
<P>
	His tardiness and selfish antics away from the court often  
tested his teammates' patience and that of coach Phil Jackson, who 
handled him as well as anyone could. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson once suggested an ultimate therapy for his bad-boy board  
man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Electric shock is the next treatment,'' Jackson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman has appeared in movies and TV shows, had a stint on MTV,  
and wrote his life story, ``Bad As I Wanna Be,'' that became a 
bestseller. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been sued -- most recently by a cocktail waitress who said  
he jammed a $100 bill down her blouse and grabbed her breast. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who once courted Madonna recently married Carmen  
Electra, his longtime girlfriend, although days later there were 
reports of an annulment filing. In another bizarre chapter, 
however, the former ``Baywatch'' actress later denied the marriage 
was off. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman didn't need the ball to be effective. His career scoring  
average was just 7.5 points, but at 6-foot-8 he was one of the 
great rebounders in league history with a 13.2 average and seven 
straight titles. 
</P>
<P>
	He had an uncanny sense of where the ball would come off the  
rim, in addition to the ability to tip rebounds to himself with his 
long arms. 
</P>
<P>
	And he was also one of the game's most bothersome defenders --  
grabbing, shoving and holding under the basket -- to the frustration 
of his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was selected by the Pistons in the second round of 1986  
and spent seven years there -- often roughing up Jordan and Pippen -- 
before being traded to the Spurs in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to the Bulls in 1995 and blended with Jordan and Pippen  
to help Chicago capture three straight titles.

<HEADLINE> Australian Open Notebook </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) -- Disbelieving players turned on the  
TV to see it with their own eyes -- how can you serve 23 
double-faults in three sets in a Grand Slam tournament match and 
still win? 
</P>
<P>
	Russian Anna Kournikova's service performance in her first-round  
match at the Australian Open has become the prime topic of 
conversation in the women's locker room. 
</P>
<P>
	``I turned the match on myself to see if it was still happening,  
if it was possible,'' top-seeded Lindsay Davenport said today. 
</P>
<P>
	``It has to be mental. Something is definitely wrong technically  
with the serve, but to miss them as badly as she does, I don't know 
what is going on. 
</P>
<P>
	``She definitely needs to change it soon.''  
</P>
<P>
	Kournikova had 23 double-faults in beating American qualifier  
Jill Craybas at the Open on Tuesday. In her last three matches of 
1998, all losses, she gave up 56 double-faults. 
</P>
<P>
	But the rising star's ugly serving contrasts sharply with the  
fluidity of the rest of her game. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel bad for her,'' Davenport said. ``She is not one of my  
greatest friends, but I think you feel badly for anybody who goes 
through that. It definitely has to be embarrassing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Davenport said she would not offer Kournikova any advice, but  
that she could expect to get it from defending singles champion 
Martina Hingis if the 17-year-old serves badly when the two begin 
their doubles matches. 
</P>
<P>
	``Martina is not going to let her double-fault that many  
times,'' Davenport said. ``Martina wants to win.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And win the Hingis-Kournikova duo did -- in straight sets against  
Czechoslovakia's Eva Melicharova and Britain's Julie Pullin. 
</P>
<P>

	 *DAVIS CUP DRAMA:* Amid calls to end the bickering on  
Australia's Davis Cup team, former standout Ken Rosewall said it 
appears Pat Cash is trying to settle old scores by attacking Cup 
captain John Newcombe. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash, a former Wimbledon champion and now a part-time coach for  
Mark Philippoussis, said the 1998 U.S. Open finalist has no respect 
for Newcombe, and he believed Newcombe did not respect 
Philippoussis. 
</P>
<P>
	Cash also accused Tennis Australia of an uncaring attitude  
toward players and of being interested only in money. 
</P>
<P>
	Rosewall said Cash was showing a personal bitterness to  
Newcombe. 
</P>
<P>
	``Pat's opened his mouth on a lot of occasions -- sometimes it's  
sensible and sometimes it's not,'' Rosewall, a former Australian 
Davis Cup player and winner of four Grand Slam events, told 
Australian Broadcasting Corp. radio. 
</P>
<P>
	``As far as play is concerned, he can be a good help to Mark,  
but I don't think he can help as far as his personal relationships, 
and shouldn't be adding fuel to the fire.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Cash's comments threaten to crack a shaky truce between the  
Australian Davis Cup team and Philippoussis' camp. 
</P>
<P>
	Philippoussis has agreed to return to the team, albeit only for  
the first-round tie against Zimbabwe in April, but has made it 
clear he has not made peace with Newcombe and Cup coach Tony Roche. 
</P>
<P>
	Newcombe has called for an end to the Davis Cup bickering.  
</P>
<P>
	``The Australian Open is on, and we've got a very important  
Davis Cup tie to think about,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``The whole thing has gone on too long. It's a joke.''  
</P>
<P>
                             	------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *GO GIRLS OF TENNIS:* Martina Spice. Venus Spice. Serena Spice.  
Anna Spice. Britain's biggest pop music export since the Beatles 
should watch out: The Spice Girls of sport may be on the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Martina Hingis says the teen-age sensations of women's tennis  
have thought about getting together off the court and going into 
the movies or television. 
</P>
<P>
	The 18-year-old defending Australian Open champion said she  
loves posing for photo shoots, and that doubles partner Anna 
Kournikova was spending an increasing amount of time on her makeup. 
</P>
<P>
	``Everybody is saying we are the Spice Girls of tennis,'' Hingis  
said. ``Even that we would make a movie together -- me, Anna, the 
Williams sisters. 
</P>
<P>
	``(It) will be fun, maybe a new TV show or something.''  
</P>
<P>
	The on-screen career would probably have to wait five years or  
so. 
</P>
<P>
	``First is tennis, then who knows what it going to happen in the  
future,'' said Hingis, currently ranked No. 2 on the tour. 
</P>
<P>
                            	--------	 
</P>
<P>
	 *WORLD OUTSIDE TENNIS:* With NATO threatening air strikes  
against Yugoslavia and war crimes investigators denied access to 
the region where 45 Albanians were massacred in Kosovo, some 
European players at the Australian Open are keeping up with the 
world outside tennis. 
</P>
<P>
	Defending champion Petr Korda has been avoiding other players  
and reporters during the scandal over his positive drugs test at 
Wimbledon in July. 
</P>
<P>
	But despite the news media's daily appetite for new cheating  
claims and stories on the struggle to restore his game amid the 
scandal, the Czech player said he reads the papers daily to stay 
current with world events. 
</P>
<P>
	``I always read the newspapers because I am trying to keep up  
with what is happening in my country,'' Korda said. 
</P>
<P>
	Germany's Steffi Graf said she watches cable news channels at  
her hotel when she isn't on the court. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do follow what is going on in the world,'' she said. ``It  
has been pretty difficult to watch what is going on in Kosovo, but 
I am interested in that. I don't want to shut myself off.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Graf is a spokeswoman for the environmental group Worldwide  
Wildlife Foundation, and in December founded the Children for 
Tomorrow foundation, an international charity designed to aid 
children suffering from psychological trauma resulting from war, 
persecution or violence.

<HEADLINE> Blue Chips End Lower; Dow Off 19.31 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Blue-chip shares gave back strong early gains  
Wednesday to close lower, but broader stock indexes managed to stay 
on the positive side and the Nasdaq composite index reached its 
eighth record high of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones industrial average ended down 19.31 at 9,335.91,  
breaking a two-day wining streak. The Dow got as high as 9,480.09, 
up nearly 125, before profit takers stepped in late in the session. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nasdaq composite ended 7.32 higher at 2,415.49. The Standard  
&AMP; Poor's 500 rose 4.61 to 1,256.61. 
</P>
<P>
	Declining issues barely outdistanced advancers on the Big Board,  
and volume on the New York Stock Exchange was heavy at 1.1 billion 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	``Some of the stocks that had rallied up significantly early in  
the day, like IBM, traded down significantly on profit-taking 
toward the end of the day,'' said Charles White, portfolio manager 
at Avatar Associates in New York. ``The market was susceptible to a 
little bit of profit-taking, and probably still is.'' IBM closed up 
1 13/16 at 194 1/16, after trading as high as 199 1/4. 
</P>
<P>
	After a shaky opening, the Dow picked up steam in the morning on  
positive earnings reports and relief that Federal Reserve Chairman 
Alan Greenspan didn't say anything too damaging when he testified 
before a Congressional committee. 
</P>
<P>
	There had been concerns that Greenspan would send prices lower  
by reprising his famous admonition about ``irrational exuberance'' 
in the stock market. That speech, made in December 1996, sparked a 
big sell-off by investors concerned that the Fed would raise 
interest rates in an attempt to slow the economy and the stock 
market. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his regular testimony before the House Ways and Means  
Committee on Wednesday, Greenspan did suggest that stock prices are 
high compared to slowing growth in corporate profits. 
</P>
<P>
	But he also signaled that he was unlikely to take any action,  
such as raising interest rates, that might dampen the market's 
advances, saying that ``policymakers are going to have to be 
particularly wary of actions that unnecessarily sow 
uncertainties.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow dropped 55 points as Greenspan read his statement. But  
it recovered as economists concluded that the central bank, while 
not likely to lower interest rates, is also not likely to raise 
them unless global turmoil sends markets into a severe downturn 
such as occurred last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	``The stock market would have gone down sharply if he had said  
something that indicates that he is leaning toward a tightening of 
monetary policy,'' said Henry Willmore, senior economist at 
Barclays Capital, ``and I would describe his comments as pretty 
even-handed or neutral.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also threw cold water on a suggestion by President  
Clinton in his State of the Union address Tuesday evening, that the 
government should invest a portion of the Social Security fund in 
stocks. Greenspan said such a policy would politicize the stock 
market, subsidize poorly performing companies and jeopardize the 
high return that stocks have given in the last several years. 
</P>
<P>
	``I am fearful that we would use those assets in a way that  
would create a lower rate of return for Social Security recipients 
and even greater concern it would create sub-optimal use of capital 
and a lower standard of living,'' Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, technology stocks continued to press higher, boosted  
by a strong earnings report from software giant Microsoft, which 
rose 6 15/16 to 162 9/16. 
</P>
<P>
	Computer chip maker Texas Instruments also rallied after  
reporting better-than-expected fourth-quarter earnings. 
</P>
<P>
	Among blue chip industrial names, General Motors shares rose  
15/16 to 88 15/16, after the automaker reported record 
fourth-quarter earnings that surpassed analyst expectations. 
</P>
<P>
	AT&AMP;T rose 5/16 to 91 11/16 after investment firm Morgan Stanley  
Dean Witter raised its 12-month price targets for the 
telecommunications giant. 
</P>
<P>
	But Philip Morris shares fell 2 3/8 to 48 7/16 on leading volume on  
the Big Board, responding to a threat by Clinton in his speech that 
the federal government will sue tobacco companies for 
smoking-related medical costs. 
</P>
<P>
	In overseas markets, the Nikkei Index in Tokyo roes 0.31  
percent, the DAX index in Frankfurt rose 1.20 percent, the CAC 
index in Paris rose 1.80 percent, and the FT-SE 100 index in London 
rose 1.29 percent.

<HEADLINE> Stocks Mixed; Dow Down 11.07 / Wall Street Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Stocks had a mixed opening on Wall Street, with  
technology shares again pulling the Nasdaq composite sharply 
higher. But blue chips were under pressure as Federal Reserve Alan 
Greenspan began testifying before a Congressional committee in 
Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	At 10 a.m. on Wall Street, the Dow Jones industrial average  
stood at 9,344.15, down 11.07 and falling. 
</P>
<P>
	Broader stock indicators, however, were higher. The Nasdaq  
composite rose in the wake of a surprisingly strong earnings report 
issued by Microsoft late Tuesday. The Nasdaq was up 40.68 at 
2,448.85 after climbing to a record closing high Tuesday. The 
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500 index was up 2.35 at 1,254.35. 
</P>
<P>
	Advancing issues outnumbered decliners by a 6-to-5 margin on the  
New York Stock Exchange, where volume came to 114.24 million 
shares. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan was set to open his quarterly testimony before the  
House Ways and Means Committee. Blue chip stocks were lower most of 
Tuesday, partially on concerns that Greenspan would dash any hopes, 
however, slim, of a cut in interest rates. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow rallied in the final hour Tuesday, however, closing up  
14.67 at 9,355.22. 
</P>
<P>
	Technology stocks, meanwhile, continue to press higher this  
morning. Microsoft shares were up 10 11/16 at 166 5/16 in leading 
volume in Nasdaq trading. The company said Tuesday that its 
second-quarter net income was 73 cents per share, beating analysts' 
estimate of 59 cents. 
</P>
<P>
	Overseas, Japan's Nikkei stock average rose 1.87 percent. In  
afternoon trading, Germany's DAX index was up 0.21 percent, 
Britain's FT-SE 100 was up 0.83 percent, and France's CAC-40 was up 
87 percent.

<HEADLINE> Boston Murder Suspect Freed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- The murder case against Edmund Burke appeared  
strong. 
</P>
<P>
	He was a reclusive handyman whose teeth matched bite marks left  
on a grandmother slain during her morning stroll in a park near 
Burke's home. He was a man so strange he kept four dead pet cats in 
his freezer because he couldn't bear to part with them. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, however, prosecutors dropped the charges for lack  
of evidence and released the 48-year-old Burke from jail after six 
weeks behind bars. 
</P>
<P>
	Saliva from the bite marks on Irene Kennedy's body did not match  
Burke's DNA, and two hand prints on the victim were not his, 
either. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an ethical decision,'' said District Attorney William  
Keating, who inherited the case from the incumbent he defeated in 
November. ``People's freedom should not be abridged when you do not 
have evidence that is mature enough or advanced enough to keep 
moving along in the legal process.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Mrs. Kennedy, 75, was found bitten, beaten and stabbed more than  
29 times Dec. 1 at a park in Walpole where she and her husband had 
gone for their usual walk. 
</P>
<P>
	Burke, a brother-in-law of one of Mrs. Kennedy's daughters, was  
arrested nine days later. A police dog had followed a scent to his 
house, where he lived with his mother and more than 20 cats. 
</P>
<P>
	On Wednesday, the district attorney said no one has been  
excluded as a suspect, and Burke could be brought back to court if 
new evidence arises. However, his attorney, Jeffrey Denner, said 
that as far as his client is concerned, ``the case is over.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, Burke denied killing Mrs. Kennedy and said  
the police dog was drawn to his house by the scent of his cats. He 
said he was relieved to be out of jail. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's the worst thing that can happen to you,'' Burke said. ``A  
month in jail for something you didn't do is much worse than a 
month in jail.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Back in Burke's neighborhood, Beth Cunningham, who lives down  
the street from him, wondered: ``If it's not him, who did it? We 
felt some closure when he was first taken in because of the 
evidence we thought they had on him.''

<HEADLINE> Steelers Hire New Receivers Coach </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PITTSBURGH (AP) -- Bob Bratkowski, the Seattle Seahawks'  
offensive coordinator for four years, was hired Wednesday as the 
Pittsburgh Steelers' receivers coach. 
</P>
<P>
	Bratkowski replaces Dave Culley, fired earlier this month after  
Steelers coach Bill Cowher began overhauling a passing offense that 
was the lowest-rated in the AFC in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	Culley will coach the Philadelphia Eagles' receivers next  
season. 
</P>
<P>
	Since finishing their first losing season (7-9) in Cowher's  
seven seasons as coach, the Steelers have hired a former NFL head 
coach (Kevin Gilbride) and a former offensive coordinator 
(Bratkowski) to make over their offense. 
</P>
<P>
	Bratkowski, 43, was the offensive coordinator for former  
Seahawks coach Dennis Erickson in Seattle and at the University of 
Miami. The son of former NFL quarterback Zeke Bratkowski also once 
coached the Seahawks' receivers. 
</P>
<P>
	Under Bratkowski, the Seahawks had the NFL's top-rated passing  
offense in 1997 before slumping to No. 23 in total offense in 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The Steelers' offense produced only 21 touchdowns in 16 games  
last season, two fewer than Denver's Terrell Davis scored himself.

<HEADLINE> Nagano Geisha Entertained IOC Aides </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NAGANO, Japan (AP) -- Some IOC officials inspecting Nagano as a  
site for the 1998 Winter Games were entertained by geisha paid by 
the city's bidders. 
</P>
<P>
	``We couldn't very well have had the governor pour drinks,''  
Sumikazu Yamaguchi, a senior member of the bidding committee, told 
The Associated Press on Wednesday. ``All they did was pour drinks 
and perform Japanese dance.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said they were not prostitutes, although some geisha are.  
</P>
<P>
	Most International Olympic Committee officials did not get  
entertained Japanese-style by geisha during Nagano's 1989-1991 bid 
because they preferred to stay at Western-style hotels, Yamaguchi 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	IOC officials being offered prostitutes are among the  
accusations to have surfaced in the bribery investigation at Salt 
Lake City. 
</P>
<P>
	The IOC has said it is preparing to expand that investigation to  
other host cities, heightening scrutiny of Nagano's bid. 
</P>
<P>
	Last week, Yamaguchi acknowledged that the bidding committee's  
expense records, which have been missing for years, had been 
intentionally destroyed in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano Mayor Tasuku Tsukada, one of the top officials of the  
bidding committee, said Wednesday the destruction of the books 
reflected the ``Japanese way of doing things.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tsukada said he left the decision of how to destroy the expense  
books to other officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The expenses were approved at the committee's general meeting  
and that meant, as a matter of course, that the records could be 
destroyed, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	``In Japan, that means it's all done and finished,'' Tsukada  
said from his office. ``We just followed the Japanese custom,'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was widely understood that IOC officials didn't want their  
activities in Nagano to be known, Yamaguchi said. 
</P>
<P>
	And so he had the books picked up with other city hall papers  
set to be disposed. They went up in smoke in 1992, less than a year 
after Nagano won the games. 
</P>
<P>
	``I just did my job,'' Yamaguchi said. ``I have never done  
anything against my conscience.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Increased scrutiny of Olympics sites has also prompted Nagano  
officials to disclose that they gave at least two expensive gifts 
to the IOC before the city was chosen for the games. 
</P>
<P>
	Yamaguchi said he delivered a painting by famous Nagano painter  
Eisetsu Shiratori, believed to be worth thousands of dollars, to 
IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch while he was visiting Tokyo. 
</P>
<P>
	Samaranch has said there is no limit on the value of gifts he  
can accept because he does not vote in the selection of host 
cities. 
</P>
<P>
	Nagano Gov. Goro Yoshimura, who chaired the bidding committee,  
said Tuesday that Samaranch was also presented a sword reportedly 
worth about $13,000.

<HEADLINE> Felons Driving Privileges Yanked </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALEM, Ore. (AP) -- Andrew Whitaker fantasized about running  
people down with his car, prosecutors said, right up until the 
moment he took aim at a 12-year-old girl and hit her so hard it 
knocked her out of her shoes. 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa Doell was killed instantly.  
</P>
<P>
	Now the 22-year-old Whitaker, who spent 2 1/2 years in state  
custody for manslaughter, is free and wants to drive again. He will 
have to wait until 2003 under new rules adopted Tuesday by the 
state after intense lobbying by the girl's father. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker now falls under the stricter 1995 penalties of the  
``Lisa Doell Law,'' even though it was enacted two years after his 
conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	Like the 600 other people in Oregon who have been convicted of  
violent crimes involving a motor vehicle, Whitaker must undergo an 
eight-year driver's license revocation period; the waiting period 
began upon his release from prison in March 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	The Oregon Driver and Motor Vehicle Services Division adopted  
the new rule under strong urging from Steve Doell, whose daughter 
was run down as she walked to her grandparents' home in Lake Oswego 
in 1992. 
</P>
<P>
	Police tracked Whitaker through a license plate found in the  
road. They were stunned when the 16-year-old driver told them, ``It 
wasn't an accident. I did it on purpose.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Lisa was killed only an hour after Whitaker showed his teacher a  
poem he wrote called ``The People's Possum,'' which graphically 
described a possum being run over by a car. 
</P>
<P>
	``They've done the right thing,'' Doell said Tuesday. ``I don't  
think any rational person who reads Mr. Whitaker's writings would 
want to hand him the keys to a motor vehicle.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ten of Whitaker's jurors wanted to convict him of murder, but  
two held out for second-degree manslaughter after Whitaker claimed 
he suffered from long-term depression and was in a mental fog when 
his car struck Lisa. 
</P>
<P>
	Whitaker lawyer William Lyons said he planned to challenge the  
new rule. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the DMV's original interpretation of the law passed in  
September 1995, Whitaker's case would have fallen under the old 
law, meaning he would be eligible to have his license restored five 
years from the date of his 1993 conviction. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is clear that the Legislature did not want driving  
revocations to run concurrently with jail or prison time, and we 
have corrected this policy as a result of Mr. Doell's inquiry,'' 
said Mari Miller, manager of the DMV's program services unit. 
</P>
<P>
	Some of those affected by the rule change are on parole and  
``driving now,'' Miller said. ``We have to weigh the public good 
against the rights of the individuals.''

<HEADLINE>  Kosovo Fighting Defies NATO Warning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SIPOLJE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- Serb forces battled ethnic Albanian  
rebels in northwestern Kosovo on Wednesday as both sides ignored 
NATO warnings to halt the fighting. At least two guerrillas were 
killed and a Serb mother and her two children were reported 
injured. 
</P>
<P>
	The deaths came in a gunbattle that broke out near Kosovska  
Mitrovica, 25 miles northwest of Pristina, the capital of the 
separatist province. There were no reports of Serb casualties. 
</P>
<P>
	Each side blamed the other for starting the fighting. Serb  
police said the Kosovo Liberation Army rebels began shooting when 
officers entered a nearby village to search for guerrillas who 
wounded five policemen two days earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Reporters saw the bodies of two ethnic Albanians, including one  
covered with ammunition belts with a machine gun at his side. The 
other was carrying a pistol. 
</P>
<P>
	Rebels said they opened fire after Serb forces shelled the  
nearby village of Vraganica. Dozens of frightened ethnic Albanian 
civilians fled the fighting aboard horse-drawn carts. 
</P>
<P>
	Serb media reported a Serb mother and her two children were  
injured before dawn Wednesday when a mortar exploded on their home 
in a village near here. A 14-year-old girl was reported to be in 
serious condition. 
</P>
<P>
	In Brussels, Belgium, NATO's supreme commander, Gen. Wesley  
Clark, and German Gen. Klaus Naumann admitted they made little 
progress during more than seven hours of talks Tuesday with 
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic. 
</P>
<P>
	Clark told alliance ambassadors Wednesday that Milosevic showed  
``no flexibility.'' 
</P>
<P>
	With diplomacy making little headway, NATO's policy-making body,  
the North Atlantic Council, ordered the USS Enterprise, currently 
in the Aegean Sea, to steam into the Adriatic Sea and moved an 
eight-vessel Mediterranean naval force to Brindisi, Italy. 
</P>
<P>
	The council also reduced the notice to pilots and others for  
carrying out airstrikes from four to two days. 
</P>
<P>
	In London, British Prime Minister Tony Blair said that Milosevic  
``risks a rapid military response from NATO'' if he fails to abide 
by the Oct. 12 cease-fire, which temporarily ended seven months of 
fighting. 
</P>
<P>
	Milosevic also showed no sign of backing down on a decision to  
expel the American head of the international peace verification 
team, William Walker. 
</P>
<P>
	But late Wednesday, the new Yugoslav deputy prime minister  
indicated a resolution might be nearing for Walker, the former U.S. 
ambassador to El Salvador. 
</P>
<P>
	Vuk Draskovic, named to the post Monday, was quoted by the  
independent Fonet agency as saying: ``The case of Ambassador Walker 
will be solved through compromise and to the mutual satisfaction.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the chief U.N. war crimes prosecutor, Louise Arbour,  
left neighboring Macedonia on Wednesday for The Hague, Netherlands, 
after having been refused permission twice in two days to enter 
Yugoslavia to investigate the massacre of 45 ethnic Albanians near 
the village of Racak. 
</P>
<P>
	On Monday, Walker, who accused Serb police of the Racak  
massacre, was given 48 hours to leave the country. The deadline was 
extended Tuesday by 24 hours. Walker told reporters Wednesday that 
he was remaining in Yugoslavia but did not explain how. 
</P>
<P>
	The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe, which  
oversees the verification mission, is demanding the government 
rescind the expulsion order. 
</P>
<P>
	After a meeting Wednesday with Milosevic, Russia's deputy  
foreign minister, Alexander Avdeyev, told reporters that as long as 
the verifiers remain in Kosovo ``there won't be any bombing.'' 
</P>
<P>
	There has been concern that the 750 or so verifiers could be  
held as hostages if NATO carries through with airstrikes. A 
French-led NATO rapid reaction force is stationed in Macedonia to 
evacuate the mission if necessary.

	Greenspan Faults Soc. Security Plan  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan today  
criticized a key part of President Clinton's Social Security rescue 
plan. He says the government could damage the economy by investing 
huge sums of money in the stock market. Greenspan said he had 
serious objections to a a provision allowing a government board to 
direct about a quarter of those savings into stock market 
investments. It is unlikely that these investments could be 
insulated from political considerations, he said.

were up 29.09 to 9,384.31. NYSE advancers edged decliners

	Poll: People Liked Clinton Speech  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Polls indicated more than three-quarters of  
Americans surveyed approved of what President Clinton said in his 
State of the Union address last night. And his job-approval ratings 
rose after his speech -- to 66 percent in an ABC News poll, from 63 
percent a week earlier, and to 72 percent in a CBS News poll, up 
from 67 percent. Members of both parties on the House floor reacted 
throughout as if listening to two different speeches. Democrats 
cheered his remarks, while Republicans sat stony-faced and silent. 

</P>
<P>
	GOP Has Its Own Agenda  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Republicans' response to President Clinton's  
speech included promises of a 10 percent income tax cut. ``No 
matter what the outcome of the president's situation, life in 
America will go on,'' Rep. Jennifer Dunn, R-Wash., said last night, 
referring to Clinton's impeachment trial. At events throughout the 
day and in the official TV response, Republicans repeatedly said 
the 10 percent across-the-board reduction in income tax rates was 
their top priority for the next two years.

	Lawyers Argue Against Pinochet  
</P>
<P>
	LONDON (AP) -- Spain's request to extradite Gen. Augusto Pinochet  
is valid under international laws developed since World War I, 
lawyers for Britain and Spain argued today. The laws allow nations 
to try people accused of crimes against humanity. The former 
Chilean dictator was arrested in London on a Spanish warrant on 
Oct. 16 alleging he ordered murders, kidnapping and torture during 
his 1973-90 rule.

	Defiant Milosevic Defends Crackdown  
</P>
<P>
	BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) -- President Slobodan Milosevic is  
showing no signs of backing down in Kosovo today despite NATO 
preparations for possible military action. A NATO strike force has 
been dispatched to the Adriatic Sea. The chief war crimes 
prosecutor, meanwhile, called off her effort to enter the Serbian 
province to investigate the massacre of 45 ethnic Albanians last 
week. Louise Arbour was refused entry twice this week and is 
heading back to The Hague, Netherlands.

	Doctors: Yeltsin Won't Need Surgery  
</P>
<P>
	MOSCOW (AP) -- Doctors decided today that they don't need to  
operate on President Boris Yeltsin after he was hospitalized with a 
bleeding ulcer, the Kremlin said. After examining Yeltsin's stomach 
with a tiny camera on a fiber-optic thread, doctors determined the 
ulcer had ``stopped bleeding, the inflammation and swelling of 
tissue stopped and initial signs of healing appeared,'' Russian 
news agencies said.

	Rodman Won't Play This Year  
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Dennis Rodman's agent announced yesterday that  
the Chicago Bulls player was retiring, but now Rodman himself is 
denying it. ``I'm not going to play this year,'' Rodman told Fox 
Sports News. ``I am in limbo, but I'm not going to say I'm 
retired.'' Rodman, whose multicolored hair, body piercings and 
tattoos made a fashion statement across the NBA and beyond, has 
become the latest star to leave the Bulls after the retirement of 
Michael Jordan.

<HEADLINE> Lost Impressionist Treasures Restored </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GARDENA, Calif. (AP) -- Dozens of early 20th century California  
Impressionist oil paintings that spent nearly four decades in a 
musty school basement have been rescued and restored for public 
display. 
</P>
<P>
	Starting in 1919, graduating seniors from what was then Gardena  
High School would vote on a favorite painting, then buy it for a 
collection that hung in the school library. 
</P>
<P>
	The tradition ended about the time a new high school was built  
in 1956 and the old Gardena High became what is now Robert Peary 
Middle School. 
</P>
<P>
	Thirty-one of the paintings went on exhibition Tuesday in  
``Painted Light: California Impressionist Paintings,'' which opened 
at Cal State Dominguez Hills in Carson. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like seeing old friends,'' said Bill Best, class of 1950,  
as he attended a preview. 
</P>
<P>
	The paintings were among 90 kept in the school's basement until  
the W.M. Keck Foundation donated $300,000 for restoration. 
</P>
<P>
	Los Angeles is in the process of doing an inventory of the  
enormous collection of an estimated $20 million in artwork tucked 
away in schools throughout the sprawling district. State law 
prohibits their sale. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the paintings on exhibit are Maynard Dixon's ``Men of the  
Red Earth,'' Franz A. Bischoff's ``A Cool Fog Drifting,'' and John 
Frost's ``Desert Twilight.'' Anchoring the exhibit is the mammoth 
``The Betatakin Ruins,'' by James Guifford Swinnerton.

<HEADLINE> Ravens New Coach Gets To Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BALTIMORE (AP) -- Brian Billick probably would have preferred to  
celebrate his first few days as an NFL head coach with a relaxing 
family vacation. 
</P>
<P>
	Instead, he spent it with Ozzie Newsome in Alabama.  
</P>
<P>
	Billick, hired by the Baltimore Ravens on Tuesday, savored the  
moment for only a few hours before turning his attention toward 
assembling a staff. 
</P>
<P>
	Less than 90 minutes after being introduced to the media,  
Billick was on his way to the Senior Bowl with Newsome, the Ravens 
vice president of player personnel. If all goes well, Billick will 
have his new staff in place by the end of next week. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are a number of individuals I plan to talk to at the  
Senior Bowl, which tends to be a coaching convention,'' Billick 
said. ``I have a very clear-cut idea about what my staff is going 
to be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	His staff could include former Ravens defensive coordinator  
Marvin Lewis and several other members of the staff dismissed with 
head coach Ted Marchibroda on Dec. 28. 
</P>
<P>
	``I've addressed that issue,'' Billick said. ``Having gone  
through 25 years as an assistant, I'm very sensitive to what 
they're going through right now. There are a number of fine coaches 
on this staff that I'm going to be interested in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billick was the offensive coordinator of the Minnesota Vikings  
before signing a six-year contract to coach the Ravens. He said he 
will call his own plays from the sideline but still plans to hire 
an offensive coordinator. 
</P>
<P>
	There is also the matter of getting the right players for his  
system, but Billick will address that chore at a later time. 
</P>
<P>
	``My first priority has to be in putting the staff together.  
That's a big process,'' he said. ``Then we will move into free 
agency and then the draft.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Billick got familiar with the Ravens last month when the Vikings  
played in Baltimore. Although Minnesota registered an easy 38-28 
victory, he was impressed by the Baltimore defense. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you go through an intense week of preparation you get to  
know them intimately, so to speak,'' he said. ``They had an 
extremely athletic, active and aggressive front seven.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the changes will likely take place on the other side of  
the line, given that Baltimore averaged fewer than 17 points per 
game and finished last in the NFL with 243 first downs. 
</P>
<P>
	``Probably by the middle of next week we will get together and  
see who's available and what our plans are. ... Obviously the 
strength of this team, initially, will be based on the defense,'' 
he said. ``It's my job now to maintain that level and see if we can 
do some things offensively to balance that out.''

<HEADLINE> Bush Worried About White House Bid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Texas Gov. George W. Bush and his wife,  
Laura, said today they are worried that a White House bid would be 
``a major life change.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A day after being sworn in for a second four-year term, the  
potential Republican presidential candidate also said he has done 
nothing in his personal life that would hurt him in a national 
campaign. 
</P>
<P>
	``If I had done anything in the past that would have  
disqualified me for being in public office, you'd have found it,'' 
he told state and national reporters gathered in the governor's 
mansion. ``When I put my hand on the Bible and was sworn to uphold 
the laws of the land of the state, I also implicitly said I'd 
uphold the dignity of the office I was elected to, and I have done 
so.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Bush and his wife sat behind a small wooden table, facing dozens  
of television cameras, photographers and reporters. Bush has said 
he's interested in running for president, but would weigh his 
family's concerns. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm reluctant, absolutely'' about the prospect of being part  
of a national campaign, Mrs. Bush said. ``I just think it's a major 
life change and we have a very nice life in Texas.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Their twin 17-year-old daughters are also reluctant, the Bushes  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``Our daughters are normal,'' the governor said. ``They don't  
want to be put through the meat grinder of national politics. I 
understand that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Bush sounded every bit like a man prepared to take the  
plunge. He said: 
</P>
<P>
	--He may form a presidential exploratory committee before making  
a final decision about whether to run. 
</P>
<P>
	--This may be his last chance to run for president. ``Should I  
choose not to run for president, I understand the window would 
probably close.'' 
</P>
<P>
	--He will continue to meet with national GOP leaders and donors  
to help him make an ``informed decision.'' The next such meeting 
takes place in the mansion Thursday, with a group of Florida 
operatives visiting Austin. 
</P>
<P>
	--He wasn't worried about critics such as Lamar Alexander, a  
likely GOP candidate who has denounced Bush for calling himself a 
``compassionate conservative.'' Why not just call yourself a 
conservative, with no modifiers? OK, Bush said with a grin, ``I'm a 
conservative.''

<HEADLINE> Barkley Interested in Three Teams </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	LA QUINTA, Calif. (AP) -- Although Charles Barkley is expected to  
re-sign with Houston, on Wednesday he said the Rockets are among 
three teams he's considering. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll decide between the Atlanta Hawks, Houston and the Seattle  
SuperSonics,'' the free agent forward said. ``I'm just trying to 
decide who has the best chance to win a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He added with a grin: ``I'm going to consult with my financial  
adviser, Michael (Jordan), and make a decision by the end of the 
week. In the meantime, I'm just going to play some golf.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At the time, Barkley was on the driving range at Bermuda Dunes  
Country Club, waiting to tee off in the Bob Hope Chrysler Classic. 
He, Jordan and former NFL receiver Roy Green were the amateurs 
playing in a foursome with the PGA's Payne Stewart. 
</P>
<P>
	The Rockets' acquisition of Scottie Pippen from Chicago should  
provide Barkley added incentive to return to Houston. 
</P>
<P>
	He, Pippen and Hakeem Olajuwon would give the Rockets an  
imposing front line, and Barkley ostensibly would be able to sign 
for the $1 million minimum and keep his Larry Bird-exception rights 
for another year. 
</P>
<P>
	``Picking up Scottie, who's one of the best players in the  
league, definitely will help the Rockets,'' Barkley said. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about a Larry Bird-exception for him next season, Barkley  
replied, ``I'm just trying to get this old body through this 
year.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was flattered that a number of teams expressed  
interest in him. 
</P>
<P>
	``There were seven or eight, which made me feel good,'' he said.  
``Now I've got it down to three teams I think have a chance to win 
it all. 
</P>
<P>
	``I love Seattle and I love playing in Houston, but I just want  
to look at everything.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Asked if he thought the NBA lockout had been necessary, Barkley  
said, ``Not really.'' 
</P>
<P>
	And what did he think of the outcome?  
</P>
<P>
	``The deal is rotten,'' he said, shaking his head.

<HEADLINE> Survey Finds U.S. Cities Vibrant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- For a third straight year, local officials  
across America report that cities are strong, vibrant centers of 
industry and culture with improving opportunities for their 
residents. 
</P>
<P>
	The 15th annual State of America's Cities survey, scheduled for  
release Wednesday, paints a largely rosy picture of urban America, 
noting improvements in overall economic conditions, 
police-community relations and recreational opportunities. 
</P>
<P>
	``The state of our union depends on our cities,'' said Clarence  
Anthony, mayor of South Bay, Fla., and president of the National 
League of Cities. 
</P>
<P>
	``This report says we are moving in the right direction and it  
points out some things that need attention to keep us moving on 
that course,'' Anthony said. 
</P>
<P>
	According to the study, nearly 90 percent of city officials  
questioned called current levels of municipal government services 
as good or very good compared to community needs. And 40 percent of 
officials -- the largest percentage since the survey began -- said 
they expect to improve current levels of service to residents this 
year. 
</P>
<P>
	More than half of the officials said their cities had improved  
quality of life measures like vitality of neighborhoods and overall 
sense of community. The optimism expressed in the survey marks the 
third consecutive year of upbeat reports on the condition of 
America's cities and towns. 
</P>
<P>
	``The continuing trend of improving conditions for most of our  
cities and towns is good news that we should all applaud,'' said 
Donald Borut, executive director of the National League of Cities. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials saw growth as having mixed results for cities.  
</P>
<P>
	About three of four officials said growth had positive impacts  
on business development, job opportunities, and their local tax 
base but 66 percent listed increased traffic congestion as a down 
side of development. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the few discordant notes sounded in the report is that 34  
percent of officials saw the need for survival services such as 
emergency food and clothing distribution, shelter and health care 
increase since last year.

<HEADLINE> Viewership Drops for Clinton Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An estimated 43.5 million viewers watched  
President Clinton deliver his State of the Union address Tuesday 
night on television, Nielsen Media Research said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the spectacle of Clinton speaking on the same day as his  
Senate impeachment trial, the numbers were down from 1998, when 
Nielsen said there were 51.3 million viewers. Clinton delivered his 
speech last year just after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
	But Monday's viewership level was consistent with several other  
Clinton State of the Union addresses. Between 1995 and 1997, the 
annual address drew either 41 or 42 million viewers. Clinton's peak 
came in 1993, when his first State of the Union speech had 66.9 
million people watching. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen's numbers, released Wednesday, estimate viewership on  
ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox and MSNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Those six networks had a combined 48 audience share, meaning  
that more than half the people watching TV at that time were 
watching something else. 
</P>
<P>
	During the speech, NBC led the networks with a 9.5 rating, down  
14 percent from last year. ABC's 8.1 rating was down 35 percent 
from 1998 and CBS's 7.4 rating was a 9 percent drop.

<HEADLINE> House Panel Expands Shuster Inquiry </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House investigators will expand their inquiry  
of Rep. Bud Shuster to include the House Transportation Committee 
chairman's campaign operations since 1993, House documents say. 
</P>
<P>
	The House ethics committee already had been looking into the  
Pennsylvania Republican's professional and personal ties with Ann 
Eppard, a transportation lobbyist who was his chief of staff for 22 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster spokesman Scott Brenner said Tuesday that Shuster would  
have no comment beyond a statement pledging to cooperate. 
</P>
<P>
	``I look forward to being fully exonerated, as I have complied  
with all House and Federal Election Commission rules,'' Shuster 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster is one of the most powerful lawmakers in Congress. Last  
year, he helped steer into law a $203 billion transportation 
funding measure with several projects that benefit Ms. Eppard's 
clients. 
</P>
<P>
	The decision to widen the inquiry was disclosed in a  
one-sentence statement in the ethics committee's 1997-98 wrap-up 
report, dated Jan. 2. The report said the panel would consider 
whether Shuster's 1994, 1996 or 1998 campaign broke any federal law 
or House rules. 
</P>
<P>
	Ms. Eppard is facing federal criminal charges in Boston. She  
denies the charges that she embezzled $27,500 from Shuster's 
campaign committee and took $230,000 in illegal payments while she 
was Shuster's top aide to influence the $11 billion ``Big Dig'' 
highway construction project in Boston. 
</P>
<P>
	Shuster was named in some of the backup documents filed by  
prosecutors, but he has not been charged with any wrongdoing. He 
now employs Ms. Eppard as a fund-raiser and assistant treasurer.

                           *Gordon H. Coe    	
</P>
<P>
	SPOKANE, Wash. (AP) -- Gordon H. Coe, whose long newspaper career  
ended when his son and wife were prosecuted in a notorious serial 
rape case, died Saturday of complications from a stroke. He was 82. 
</P>
<P>
	As managing editor of The Spokane Chronicle, Coe headed the  
paper's coverage of the so-called South Hill rapist. His son, Fred 
-- who later changed his name to Kevin -- was charged with some of 
the attacks in 1981. 
</P>
<P>
	Coe, who oversaw a tips hotline on the rapes, turned over  
day-to-day coverage of the case to others and retired after his 
son's arrest. 
</P>
<P>
	Kevin Coe was convicted in 1981 of four rape counts and was  
sentenced to life in prison. After the convictions were overturned 
on appeal, he was convicted of three counts in a 1985 retrial. Two 
counts were later vacated and he was left with a 25-year sentence. 
</P>
<P>
	Gordon Coe's wife, Ruth, was convicted in 1982 of trying to hire  
someone to kill the judge and prosecutor in her son's rape trial. 
</P>
<P>
	The case was later the subject of a true-crime book, ``Son,'' by  
Jack Olsen. It was later made into a television movie. 
</P>
<P>
	Coe became a reporter for The Spokane Chronicle in 1938. He was  
city editor for 25 years and became managing editor in 1975. The 
Chronicle ceased publication in 1992. 
</P>
<P>

60,000-member organization, in 1953, and was Maine commissioner of 
agriculture for 11 years beginning in 1964.

<P>
	Farnsworth was executive editor of ``Holiday'' from 1949 to  
1964, then edited ``Vista,'' the magazine of the United Nations 
Association, from 1964 to 1976. He was Waldheim's speechwriter from 
1976 to 1982. 
</P>
<P>
	He also worked as an editor at Little-Brown Publishing Co. in

Gershwin's little sister, Frankie Gershwin, died Monday. She was 
92. 
</P>
<P>
	Godowsky, the youngest of four Gershwin children -- including  
another brother, Arthur -- was its first big breadwinner, touring in 
a children's musical, ``Daintyland,'' when she was 11. 
</P>
<P>
	She sang in a couple of Broadway shows in the 1920s, but was  
better known as the favored chanteuse of her brother George, who 
often had her try out his new songs and performed with her at 
parties. 
</P>
<P>
	She married one of George's poker pals, Leopold Godowsky Jr.,  
son of the Austrian pianist, in 1930. She later took up painting 
and turned out hundreds of well-received works.

	She returned to singing with a widely praised 1975 album,

<HEADLINE> Denny's Accused of Discrimination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	HELENA, Mont. (AP) -- A Denny's restaurant may have deliberately  
slipped bacon and ham into the meals of two Muslims who had 
requested no-pork dishes, an investigator with the Montana Human 
Rights Bureau says. 
</P>
<P>
	``The fact that the ingredients for these meals are packaged  
separately and do not contain any pork products ... implies that 
these products were placed in the food intentionally,'' according 
to the investigator's report. 
</P>
<P>
	Two Muslims, Abdussalam Sipes and Clarence Watson, filed a  
religious discrimination complaint with the bureau, seeking an 
apology and $1 million each. The investigator's report was made 
public this week by an Islamic organization. 
</P>
<P>
	If the two sides cannot settle the complaint, it will go before  
a Human Rights Bureau hearing officer. 
</P>
<P>
	A lawyer for Denny's, which has been dogged by charges of racism  
for years, did not return calls. The manager of the Billings 
restaurant, Richard Graves, denied the incident was intentional. 
</P>
<P>
	Sipes, whose religion forbids the eating of pork, said in an  
interview Tuesday, ``My soul was poisoned.'' Watson said he had to 
purge himself by vomiting the meal and was unable to read the Koran 
or pray for 40 days. 
</P>
<P>
	The accusations arose from a March lunch at which the men asked  
that their meals be prepared in separate skillets to avoid 
contamination by pork. 
</P>
<P>
	Sipes said he noticed pieces of ham hidden in the food and  
complained. The manager offered them another dish, but Sipes said 
that when he inspected it, he found a strip of bacon buried 
underneath. 
</P>
<P>
	``They're claiming it's a giant coincidence that ham -- not once  
but twice -- found its way into both of their meals,'' said the 
men's attorney, Jeff Ferguson. ``They're saying it was a comedy of 
errors.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Denny's, based in Spartanburg, S.C., settled a $46 million  
discrimination suit in 1994 filed by black Secret Service agents 
who complained they were denied service at a Maryland restaurant. 
</P>
<P>
	The restaurant chain recently launched a $2 million anti-racism  
campaign consisting of a series of TV commercials. Denny's 
employees are now also required to undergo anti-discrimination 
sensitivity training.

<HEADLINE> N. Korea: Peace Talks May Go Sour </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	GENEVA (AP) -- Controversy over a North Korean diplomat could  
affect four-party talks aimed at bringing a permanent peace to the 
divided Korean peninsula, a North Korean official said today. 
</P>
<P>
	Communist North Korea has accused South Korea of kidnapping one  
of its diplomats based in Berlin and handing him over to the United 
States. 
</P>
<P>
	South Korean officials said Monday that the diplomat, identified  
as Kim Kyong Pil, 54, defected with his wife, Kim Kum Sun, 52, 
about a week ago while on a trip to Frankfurt, Germany. They said 
the pair were seeking asylum in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Li Gun, deputy leader of the North Korean delegation to the  
peace talks here, claimed that the incident showed the United 
States and South Korea ``are not willing to work with us for 
peace.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Li was speaking to reporters after delegates from the two  
Koreas, the United States and China started consultations on ways 
to reduce tensions on the Korean peninsula. The other delegations 
made no comment after the morning meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	The United States and China are participating in the talks by  
virtue of their major roles in the 1950-53 Korean War, which ended 
with an armistice but no formal peace treaty. North Korea is 
chairing this round of four-party talks, expected to end Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	``Another session will go on tomorrow morning,'' Li said,  
despite his government's claims that South Korean intelligence 
agents abducted Kim and his wife on Jan. 13. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think this is a good opportunity for the United States and  
the South to show ... if they are willing to go on with the peace 
talks,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The latest round of talks follows the failure of the United  
States to gain access to an underground site where it suspects 
North Koreans are trying to develop nuclear weapons. Two-way talks 
between the Americans and North Koreans are to resume next weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Tensions on the peninsula have worsened since North Korea  
test-fired a missile over Japan in August and fears rose over the 
North's nuclear ambitions.

<HEADLINE> 4 Feared Dead As N.J. Boat Vanishes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BARNEGAT LIGHT, N.J. (AP) -- Four crew members were feared dead  
after their clamming boat sank several miles off the coast of New 
Jersey, the fourth accident involving East Coast clammers in just 
two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Adriatic, a 74-foot steel-hulled ship, had sent a distress  
call but it was too garbled to hear, delaying rescue efforts, Coast 
Guard officials said Tuesday. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's a shock. I don't know what's going on this year,'' said  
Jack Keith, a diver who was scheduled to perform repairs on the 
ship. 
</P>
<P>
	The Coast Guard found the ship in about 70 feet of water. Petty  
Officer Al Bennett said today that divers who inspected the wreck 
did not find any bodies. He said it's possible the crew could have 
escaped on a life raft. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're going to search as long as there's a remote chance of  
finding them alive,'' Bennett said. 
</P>
<P>
	A Coast Guard dispatcher heard a static-garbled ``mayday'' call  
Monday afternoon. A return request for information identifying the 
vessel that sent the call received no response, the Coast Guard 
said. Four hours later, a dockworker reported the Adriatic missing. 
</P>
<P>
	``We didn't know the ship, the location or the type of  
distress,'' said Lt. John Brenner, a Coast Guard spokesman. ``And 
until you have a position, it's tough to go out and search the 
entire ocean.'' 
</P>
<P>
	It was not clear if bad weather played a role. Waves were 4 to 5  
feet Monday night and the water temperature was 45 degrees. 
</P>
<P>
	Other clamming boat accidents the past two weeks:  
</P>
<P>
	--On Jan. 6, a boat sank off the coast of Manasquan. Two crew  
members died and two others were presumed dead. 
</P>
<P>
	--On Jan. 8, a boat went down off New Bedford, Mass. One crew  
member died, three were saved and one remains missing. 
</P>
<P>
	--On Sunday, a boat struck jetty rocks in the Manasquan Inlet.  
Its three crew members jumped overboard and were rescued by the 
Coast Guard. 
</P>
<P>
	The Adriatic crew members were identified as George Evans,  
Michael Hager, Frank Jannicelli and Douglas Oland.

<HEADLINE> Archaeologist Finds Treasure Chest </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DEATH VALLEY NATIONAL PARK, Calif. (AP) -- An archaeologist has  
found a wooden chest filled with gold and silver coins that may 
have been hidden during an ill-fated Gold Rush expedition across 
Death Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Archaeologist Jerry Freeman uncovered the treasure in November  
as he recreated the steps of a group known as The Lost Pioneers of 
1849. He and four others retraced the entire journey in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``I was just blown away,'' Freeman said Monday. ``Nothing  
prepared me for this.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The chest was in a cave, propped up on boulders and a board and  
in mint condition. The find is worth an estimated $500,000, said 
Freeman, a 56-year-old semi-retired substitute high school teacher. 
</P>
<P>
	The National Park Service is examining the find to determine if  
it is authentic, but has not raised any questions. Freeman said he 
hopes to donate the find to a museum. 
</P>
<P>
	With the coins were well-worn baby shoes, photographs and a  
letter documenting the wagon train trek of '49er William Robinson, 
who was among some 100 men, women and children seeking the 
gold-laden foothills of the Sierra Nevada. The group wound up in 
the merciless California desert. 
</P>
<P>
	The letter was tucked inside a small hymnal.  
</P>
<P>
	``My Dear Edwin,'' Robinson wrote. ``Knowed, now we should have  
gone arownd. ... Ifen I don't raturn by end of fifty I wont never 
come.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Robinson died 26 days later on Jan. 28, 1850. According to  
journals, Robinson drank too much cold water at the first spring 
the party came to at what is known today as Barrel Springs near 
Palmdale. He lay down for a nap and never awakened. 
</P>
<P>
	The group, well-known to historians, was originally from the  
Midwest. The pioneers started out from Salt Lake City in October 
1849, on an ill-conceived attempt to skirt the southern end of the 
Sierra Nevada and ended up crossing Death Valley. 
</P>
<P>
	Most of the rest made it to what is now Valencia, in Los Angeles  
County, some 300 miles southwest of their destination. Freeman said 
he believes 13 died on the trek. 
</P>
<P>
	The team found a manifest of the trunk's contents dated Jan. 2,  
1850, along with nearly 80 pieces of currency, including $5 and $10 
gold pieces and a number of silver dollars. None of the money 
appears to have dates after 1849, Freeman said. 
</P>
<P>
	There was also a holstered pistol, a wooden powderhorn, a locket  
adorned with pearls and china bowls. A knitted shawl covered it 
all.

<HEADLINE> Schlereth Shrugs Off Injuries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DENVER (AP) -- Call it the Mark Schlereth Museum, a macabre  
collection of torn cartilage, bone chips and other debris removed 
from various parts of his sliced-and-diced body. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlereth keeps mementos of his surgical procedures, some of  
which he hangs from his locker. 
</P>
<P>
	It's a reminder of what a medical marvel he is. Despite 21  
operations, the Denver Broncos offensive guard keeps going strong. 
</P>
<P>
	Although his body tells him it's time to quit, his heart won't  
let him, and on Jan. 31, Schlereth will once more block out his 
anatomical ruination and play in the Super Bowl, the third of his 
career. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's who I am,'' he said Tuesday with a shrug.  
</P>
<P>
	Schlereth's latest surgery came last October, the 12th operation  
he has had on his left knee. He had bone chips removed from his 
left elbow in the preseason. 
</P>
<P>
	In all, he has had 17 knee operations, including reconstructive  
surgery on his left knee in 1985. He has had three elbow surgeries 
and underwent back surgery to repair two herniated disks in 
November 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlereth also was rushed to the hospital in 1995, where he  
passed a kidney stone. Hours later, he was playing in a Monday 
night game against Oakland. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite all the injuries and operations, Schlereth had an even  
scarier moment. In 1993 he contracted Guillain-Barre syndrome, a 
neurological condition that left him tripping over himself, unable 
to play, with no feeling in his hands or legs. He missed the last 
seven games of that season but recovered. 
</P>
<P>
	Unique recuperative abilities and an incredible tolerance for  
pain have marked Schlereth's 10-year pro career, which included six 
seasons in Washington. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors were unsure if he would be able to return from back  
surgery in November 1997, but he returned five games later and 
started in the line that contributed to the Broncos' Super Bowl win 
over Green Bay. 
</P>
<P>
	He tore cartilage in his left knee in Denver's first regular  
season game this season, but played in the next five games. He had 
arthroscopic surgery before a bye week and was back playing in 13 
days without missing a snap. 
</P>
<P>
	``Unless he has the surgery the day of the game, I expect him to  
be back there each week, performing at a level like he's never 
missed a beat,'' Broncos tight end Shannon Sharpe said. ``He's 
unbelievable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Last August, Schlereth had a bone chip the size of a molar  
removed from his left elbow. The next day, he was back at training 
camp, carrying the bone clip in a plastic container, proudly 
showing it to teammates and reporters. He was sidelined for only 
one preseason game. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the surgical souvenirs hanging from his locker is a small  
bottle containing cartilage removed from his knee in his first 
operation in 1983, when he was in high school. 
</P>
<P>
	This all could have been avoided, he admitted.  
</P>
<P>
	``In high school I could have said, `You know what, this ain't  
worth it,''' he said. ``But what are you going to do? This is what 
I've done my whole life. Even though I've been hurt, I've always 
felt I could play at a high level, and I always had a desire to be 
out there. And I still do.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A Pro Bowl selection with the Redskins in 1991, Schlereth has  
been a stalwart in the Denver line that protects John Elway and 
clears holes for Terrell Davis. 
</P>
<P>
	Schlereth, the first native born Alaskan to play in the NFL,  
conceded he is sore nearly every waking hour. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the morning, I just hobble around looking crippled for a  
while, and that's pretty much every day,'' he said. ``I always have 
a certain amount of pain and stiffness. 
</P>
<P>
	``My body tells me it's time to go (retire) all the time. I've  
got the gift of stupidity and the ability not to listen to it, 
though. I'll go when I'm ready to go. It's not my body that will 
tell me, it's my heart that will tell me that I don't want to do it 
anymore. I'm still waiting for that time to come. 
</P>
<P>
	``Physically, I feel as good as I've felt in a long time.''  
</P>
<P>
	He attributes his relatively good health to the fact that the  
Broncos practice with a minimum of contact. 
</P>
<P>
	``I could not have continued my career in Washington, where we  
hit on Wednesday, Thursday and Friday,'' he said. ``I would be out 
of the game.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schlereth, who turns 33 on Monday, will need additional surgery  
after he retires -- to replace both knees. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no sense worrying about it,'' he said, ``because the  
damage is done. I can't change the past.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He loves the present, however.  
</P>
<P>
	``Going to the Super Bowl is like nothing else you can do,'' he  
said. ``It's very exciting. When I'm retired and gone and none of 
you guys remember who I was, I'll still have all the memories of 
the guys I played with and this special time.''

	JARRATT, Va. (AP) -- A drug dealer convicted in the shooting  
deaths of a couple was executed by injection Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Mark Arlo Sheppard, 27, was found guilty in the shootings of  
Richard and Rebecca Rosenbluth in their suburban Richmond home. 
Sheppard insisted he was not the trigger man. 
</P>

</P>
<P>
	Sheppard's attorney, Chris Collins, said he believes the dates  
were birthdays of family members or close friends. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors said Sheppard and an accomplice, Andre Graham, were  
cocaine dealers who killed the Rosenbluths when their finances 
began to dwindle. Autopsies detected cocaine in the Rosenbluths' 
bodies, and drug paraphernalia was found in their home.

<HEADLINE> American Airlines Has Weak Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	AMR Corp., the parent of American Airlines, said weak  
international demand pushed its fourth-quarter earnings below Wall 
Street's expectations, but results for the year were strong. 
America West, a Phoenix-based carrier, posted a slight gain for the 
quarter and a major rise for the full year. US Airways saw its 
profits fall sharply, but mostly because its taxes went up. 

</P>
<P>
 *AMR Corp.    	
</P>
<P>
	AMR Corp. said Wednesday its fourth-quarter profits slipped 12.5  
percent compared to the same period last year because of decreasing 
demands in the international market. 
</P>
<P>
	The nation's second-largest airline earned $167 million, or $1  
per diluted share, after a $15 million one-time charge related to 
food costs on flights. In last year's fourth-quarter, the airline 
earned $195 million, or $1.09 a share. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts had expected earnings of about $1.16 a diluted share.  
</P>
<P>
	AMR's fourth-quarter revenues rose 1.3 percent to $4.6 billion,  
compared to $4.5 billion in last year's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	For the full year, AMR's earnings rose 33.4 percent. Including  
the charge, AMR reported earnings of $1.3 billion, or $7.52 a 
diluted share, compared to $985 million, or $5.39 per diluted 
share, in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement, Donald Carty, AMR's chairman and chief executive  
officer, said the strong domestic economy and lower fuel prices 
helped results. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1999, Carty said, the company plans to add 45 new Boeing  
aircraft and 31 new regional jets, upgrade airport facilities and 
improve passenger service. 
</P>
<P>
	Shares of AMR fell $4.43 3/4, or 7 percent, to $59.81 1/4 on the New  
York Stock Exchange. 

</P>
<P>
 *America West    	
</P>
<P>
	America West Holdings Corp., which owns the airline and The  
Leisure Company, earned $20.15 million, or 51 cents per share, in 
the fourth quarter, up from $20.09 million, or 43 cents a share in 
last year's fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	Analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. had estimated the company  
would earn 39 cents per share. This year's results include a 
one-time $3.7 million charge for signing bonuses for mechanics and 
writing off some software applications. 
</P>
<P>
	Without the charge, the company would have earned $22.4 million  
in the fourth quarter. 
</P>
<P>
	America West said its net income for 1998 was $108.6 million, up  
45 percent from the previous record in 1997 of $75 million. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong report helped America West shares rise 7.6 percent,  
or $1.37 1/2, to $19.50 on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	William Franke, chairman and chief executive officer of the  
America West Holding Corp., said earnings were bolstered by 
better-than-expected performance by The Leisure Company, the 
company's vacation-package branch. 
</P>
<P>
	The company's strong performance continued despite an ongoing  
dispute with its flight attendants' union. The flight attendants 
have gone without a contract since 1994, and the union has asked 
federal permission to begin striking. The union has already 
authorized a strike if that permission is given. 
</P>
<P>
	In a separate statement late Wednesday, America West said it has  
been contacted by a number of airlines expressing interest in a 
possible deal, ranging from a strategic alliance to a merger or 
similar business combination. It did not identify the airlines and 
said it would have no further comment on the possible discussions. 
</P>
<P>
	However, United Airlines said in a statement that ``it has  
expressed to America West Airlines an interest in a possible 
acquisition of America West.'' 

</P>
<P>
 *US Airways Group Inc.    	
</P>
<P>
	The airline said its net earnings fell 78 percent to $104  
million, or $1.18 per share, from $479 million, or $4.66 per share 
in the same period of 1997. Earnings per share were three cents 
short of analyst estimates as measured by First Call. Revenues 
gained 2 percent to $2.12 billion, vs. $2.09 billion in the last 
quarter of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Part of the reason for the big decline in earnings was a major  
tax credit of $467 million in the fourth quarter of 1997. As the 
company returned to profitability, its tax rate rose to 40.3 
percent, compared with 15.8 percent in 1997, US Airways said. 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, profits fell 48 percent to $538 million, or $5.60  
per share, from $1.03 billion, or $9.87 per share. Revenues rose 2 
percent to $8.6 billion, from $8.51 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	US Airways shares fell $6.31 1/4 to $51.12 1/2 on the New York Stock  
Exchange

<HEADLINE> Walker Returns to Northwestern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	EVANSTON, Ill. (AP) -- When Randy Walker was at the Fiesta Bowl  
earlier this month, he was overwhelmed by the desire to someday be 
on the sidelines for a national title game. 
</P>
<P>
	Now he's at a place where he believes he can get that chance.  
</P>
<P>
	``I want to coach at the highest level, and I want to coach in  
the national championship,'' he said. ``I believe Northwestern is 
that kind of program.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker, coach at Miami of Ohio the past nine seasons, was  
introduced Wednesday as Northwestern's new coach. He replaces Gary 
Barnett, who was hired as Colorado's coach earlier in the day. 
</P>
<P>
	A fullback at Miami, Walker spent almost 15 years at the school  
as a player or coach. He compiled a 59-35-5 record, including a 
10-1 mark last year. Leaving wasn't easy, but when he heard Barnett 
was a candidate for the Colorado job, Walker made a phone call and 
let Northwestern know he was interested. 
</P>
<P>
	The former Wildcats assistant interviewed with Northwestern last  
week, only to have the Barnett-Colorado deal fall through. Then, on 
Tuesday night, he heard Barnett was definitely on his way. 
</P>
<P>
	Shortly after, he was packing his bags for Evanston.  
</P>
<P>
	``I have a strong feeling about what we should be as  
student-athletes, about what our game should represent,'' said 
Walker, sporting a Northwestern-purple tie. ``Northwestern 
represents that. It's about what college athletics should be.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That wasn't always the case. Before Barnett arrived in December  
1991, only two squads had won four games since 1971. The Wildcats 
seemed to have a permanent home in the Big Ten's basement. 
</P>
<P>
	But in his fourth season, Barnett led Northwestern on a wild  
ride. The Wildcats lost only one regular-season game -- to Walker's 
RedHawks, no less -- won the Big Ten championship and went to the 
Rose Bowl, where they lost to Southern California. 
</P>
<P>
	The next year, the Wildcats were co-champions of the Big Ten.  
</P>
<P>
	``It's a visible commitment to excellence,'' Walker said of how  
Northwestern has changed since he was an assistant in 1988-89. 
``Northwestern is a very unique situation. It has some things to 
offer no one else can.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Wildcats have slipped back into their old ways, though,  
going 5-7 in 1997 and 3-8 last season. The school was rocked by a 
sports betting scandal that saw four former football players 
indicted Dec. 3 for allegedly lying about their gambling 
activities. 
</P>
<P>
	``I, for one, don't tend to dwell on the past,'' Walker said.  
``Let's talk about going forward, where are we going tomorrow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He has only two weeks before national signing day for recruits.  
Aside from putting together a new staff and getting familiar with 
his new players, he has to find a way to keep recruits who might 
have been scared off by Barnett's impending departure. 
</P>
<P>
	This wasn't the first time Barnett flirted with leaving. He was  
a candidate for jobs at UCLA and Notre Dame and linked to jobs at 
Georgia, Oklahoma and Texas. 
</P>
<P>
	``We were all sad coach Barnett left, but what can you do?''  
sophomore offensive lineman Lance Clelland said. ``I'm excited for 
a fresh start.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Walker is the latest in a long line of coaches to come out of  
Miami, ``The Cradle of Coaches.'' Sid Gillman, Woody Hayes, Bo 
Schembechler and Bill Mallory all coached there, as did former 
Northwestern coach Ara Parseghian. 
</P>
<P>
	Drafted by the Cincinnati Bengals, Walker chose to stay at Miami  
as a graduate assistant under coach Dick Crum. He accompanied Crum 
to North Carolina and spent 10 years there as an assistant. He then 
moved to Northwestern. 
</P>
<P>
	When he was named coach at Miami on Dec. 1, 1989, he inherited a  
program that had won two games over the two previous seasons and 
went 5-5-1 in 1990. He had a winning record every season thereafter 
except 1993, when Miami went 4-7. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'll get my feet on the ground and hit it running,'' said  
Walker, who met with his new players for the first time after the 
news conference. ``Trust me, once I hit it running, I'm going to go 
real fast.''

<HEADLINE> Study Explores Fertility Treatment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Combining artificial insemination with hormone treatments  
appears to give infertile couples a better chance of pregnancy than 
either method alone. 
</P>
<P>
	Doctors routinely try to achieve pregnancy by injecting sperm  
directly into the uterus or by stimulating the ovaries with 
hormones to release eggs. Some doctors use both methods. 
</P>
<P>
	However, there have been few careful studies of how well these  
methods work, separately or together. 
</P>
<P>
	A study in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine looked at  
932 couples. In each case, there was no diagnosable reason for the 
woman to be infertile, and the man had either a normal or a 
borderline sperm count. 
</P>
<P>
	Drs. David S. Guzick of the University of Rochester, Sandra Ann  
Carson of the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston and colleagues 
found that women who received hormones with artificial insemination 
were three times more likely to become pregnant than those who 
received the equivalent of no treatment and twice as likely to 
become pregnant as those who received only one form of treatment. 
</P>
<P>
	In the essentially untreated comparison group in this study,  
doctors simply released the husband's sperm onto the wife's cervix. 
This is the equivalent of intercourse. 
</P>
<P>
	Couples who received hormones with insemination had a 33 percent  
rate of pregnancy, vs. roughly 19 percent for couples who had one 
form of treatment and 10 percent for those who received the 
equivalent of none at all. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormones alone were about as effective as artificial  
insemination alone: 19 percent vs. 18 percent. 
</P>
<P>
	The researchers noted the risks of using hormones include  
multiple pregnancy and possibly an increased chance of ovarian 
cancer. During the study, there were three quadruplet pregnancies, 
four sets of triplets and 18 sets of twins. 
</P>
<P>
	Hormone treatments cost about $1,300 per monthly cycle,  
artificial insemination about $500. 
</P>
<P>
	In an accompanying editorial, Drs. Egbert R. Te Velde and  
Bernard J. Cohlen of University Hospital Utrecht in the Netherlands 
said reproductive technology is being marketed too heavily in the 
United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Many couples are too quick to try medical treatment and  
underestimate their chances of becoming pregnant through regular 
intercourse, they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	``Treatment of infertility usually does not make the difference  
between conceiving and not conceiving; the difference lies in 
conceiving sooner rather than later,'' they wrote. 
</P>
<P>
	The study's authors noted, however, that the couples they  
examined had been trying to become pregnant an average of 3 1/2 to 4 
years. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem with waiting is that we tend to delay our  
childbearing, and then by the time we're in our mid-30s, upper 30s, 
you're in an age group where these drugs are far less effective,'' 
Carson said. ``Waiting is fine if you're 25, but it's harder to 
make that argument at age 38 or 39.''

<HEADLINE>  NBA Lockout Is Officially Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- The NBA lockout was officially settled this  
afternoon, and teams were told they can begin signing players, 
making trades and opening training camps at 2 p.m. EST Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	``We have an agreement, and we expect to have the deal signed  
tonight,'' league spokesman Chris Brienza said. 
</P>
<P>
	Teams can immediately begin talking to their players, something  
that was forbidden since commissioner David Stern and union 
director Billy Hunter agreed two weeks ago on the terms of a new 
collective bargaining agreement. 
</P>
<P>
	Opening night is less than 2 1/2 weeks away, and the NBA is  
expected to release a new schedule by the end of the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's just a relief to know it's behind us,'' new Chicago Bulls  
coach Tim Floyd said. ``We have a chance to sit down and visit with 
players, talk to players, which is what this is all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier today, Day 204 of the longest and costliest work  
stoppage in league history, the laborious task of reducing the 
settlement into written form hit a few last-minute snags after 
lawyers for the owners and players spent the whole night meeting. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the rumors kept coming and the plots kept  
twisting as teams maneuvered to get ready for the scheduled Feb. 5 
start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll get done. It always gets done,'' agent David Falk said.  
``This just gives us more time to talk to people and refine our 
numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main sticking point between the sides had been whether the  
new middle-class exception can be used for a three-year contract 
(the league's contention) or a six-year contract (the union's 
contention). 
</P>
<P>
	The union won that argument, but a final snag developed over the  
league's insistence upon having discipline authority over agents 
involved in salary cap circumvention. Another snag concerned 
whether bonus money would be counted in trade calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	It was not immediately known how those issues were resolved.  
</P>
<P>
	Rod Strickland, meanwhile, was miffed at the offer the  
Washington Wizards made. The Washington Post said the Wizards 
offered $30 million for three years, with two additional years 
non-guaranteed, and had given Strickland a deadline of midnight 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he'll be back here,'' Falk told The Associated  
Press today. ``We're trying to get him to New York. He loves it 
that they have (Latrell) Sprewell, Allan Houston and Larry Johnson 
there, and he thinks they can win a championship. I'd like to get 
him there so Patrick (Ewing) can win a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falk was exploring other options for Strickland, including  
several sign-and-trade deals that would send last season's NBA 
assist leader to another team. He said four or five teams were 
making bids, but refused to name anyone other than the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Dennis Rodman added a strange subplot to Tuesday's events as his  
agent, Dwight Manley, announced that Rodman was retiring. Hours 
later, the league's leading rebounder for the past seven seasons 
said he was more in a state of ``limbo'' than retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	And Antonio McDyess put off until today a decision on where  
he'll play -- Denver or Phoenix -- but several signs seemed to be 
pointing to the Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	``It defies logic, in my opinion,'' Suns owner Jerry Colangelo  
said of the deliberations concerning McDyess. ``We think this is a 
great spot for him. He seemed very happy here. We love him as a 
young guy and a future star in this league. But a lot of things 
have happened this offseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Tom Gugliotta rumors were strong, too, with the Nuggets,  
Suns and Lakers all interested. A source close to the Lakers said 
the team was offering Elden Campbell, Eddie Jones and rookie Sam 
Jacobsen to the Timberwolves in a sign-and-trade deal for 
Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets were wondering whether they would be spurned by  
Gugliotta in the event that McDyess stays in Phoenix. If so, they 
were expected to look to sign free-agent center Vlade Divac. 
</P>
<P>
	But no event symbolized Tuesday's craziness like the  
``retirement'' of Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to play this year,'' Rodman told Fox Sports  
News. ``I am in limbo, but I'm not going to say I'm retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not how his former coach heard it. In a strange twist  
earlier in the day, Chuck Daly of the Orlando Magic said he heard 
Rodman was traded to the New York Knicks for Buck Williams -- a 
rumor that was quickly shot down. 
</P>
<P>
	Also Tuesday, it was learned that John Starks and Chris Mills  
are the players who will be traded from the Knicks to the Golden 
State Warriors for Latrell Sprewell. Word of the Sprewell trade got 
out Monday night, just a few hours after another major trade was 
revealed -- Scottie Pippen from the Chicago Bulls to the Houston 
Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls also have sign-and-trade deals worked out for Luc  
Longley and Steve Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo confirmed that the Suns will trade three of the five  
players they have under contract -- Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and 
Bubba Wells -- for Longley. 
</P>
<P>
	In another agreed-upon deal, the Seattle SuperSonics were set to  
send center Jim McIlvaine to the New Jersey Nets for veteran 
forwards Michael Cage and Don MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Jazz were expected to sign Nuggets free-agent forward  
Johnny Newman, who would take the place of free agent Chris Morris. 
The Jazz also went looking for another big man after learning that 
Greg Foster fractured an ankle. Utah was believed to have spoken to 
Chicago about a sign-and-trade deal involving Bill Wennington, 
although no trade agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Heat and Golden State Warriors, who couldn't agree on  
a Sprewell deal, nonetheless continued to discuss several 
multiplayer deals. Heat coach Pat Riley was thought to have 
interest in reuniting with Starks, and a deal was being discussed 
that would send Brent Barry, Terry Mills and Duane Causwell to the 
Warriors for Clarence Weatherspoon, Tony Delk and Felton Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports of a possible Starks-Barry deal, but it would  
not work under the salary cap in the league's complicated trade 
rules.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Co. Develops New Laser </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Beating large electronics companies to the punch, a  
small Japanese firm has developed a short-wavelength laser that 
could have many practical applications, including eye surgery and 
high-definition videos. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichia Chemical Industries Ltd., an obscure high-tech firm based  
in southern Japan, plans to offer samples of its blue- or 
violet-light laser to commercial companies as soon as next month, 
company spokesman Kazu Miyazaki said Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	Experts say Nichia's breakthrough provides the key to developing  
high-definition video disks, higher-resolution laser printers, more 
precise laser surgery and scores of as-of-yet unimagined 
applications. 
</P>
<P>
	``There are obvious uses in digital storage'' of information,  
said Gerhard Fasol, president of the company Eurotechnology Japan 
and a specialist in blue-laser technology. ``But it's a completely 
new product, so there will be a lot of other applications that 
aren't yet known.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The innovation's main importance lies in its wavelength. The  
wavelength of Nichia's blue laser -- 400 nanometers -- is about 
one-third shorter than that of conventional red-light lasers, 
allowing it to blast smaller grooves into CD-ROMS and therefore 
triple their storage capacity. 
</P>
<P>
	Shorter wavelengths could also make household lighting several  
times more energy-efficient. And the laser's blue color could be 
used together with conventional red and yellow lasers to pave the 
way for much more accurate computer displays and scanners. 
</P>
<P>
	Because of its far-reaching commercial potential, the  
short-wavelength blue laser has been one of the holy grails of high 
technology, and global conglomerates like Hewlett-Packard and 
Japan's Toshiba and Sony have placed a high priority on developing 
it. 
</P>
<P>
	But Nichia's chief researcher Shunji Nakamura and a handful of  
assistants at the 1,350-employee firm defeated larger rivals by 
using materials called gallium nitrides, which are also used to 
make semiconductors. Few companies took gallium nitrides seriously 
when Nakamura began exploring their potential for blue lasers in 
the late 1980s. 
</P>
<P>
	But after Nichia produced the first light-emitting blue laser  
diode in 1993, many competitors switched their research to focus 
also on gallium nitrides. By then, Nichia was way ahead in the race 
to develop a functional blue laser. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichia, based in the small city of Anan, 320 miles southwest of  
Tokyo, is widely recognized to be one to two years ahead of others 
in its research on blue lasers -- a virtual eternity in high-tech 
research. 
</P>
<P>
	``Nichia succeeded because they are a totally unconventional  
company,'' said Fasol, who wrote a book about blue lasers with 
Nichia's Nakamura. ``They were also lucky in hitting upon the right 
material for their research.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Nichia's laser has a life span of 10,000 hours, sufficient for  
commercial purposes, and a constant power output at room 
temperature. 
</P>
<P>
	Other companies have developed lasers in the blue-violet range,  
but none that operate at room temperature and with the stable beam 
needed for practical use. 
</P>
<P>
	Short-wavelength laser technology is expected to be available  
for use in commercial products within half a year. Many of Nichia's 
rivals are rushing to be the first to adapt the new laser to 
CD-ROMS and computer printers, but they will have to contend with 
patents owned by the Japanese company. 
</P>
<P>
	Nichia created its short-wavelength laser with what analysts  
said was a low budget and a research and development team of a few 
dozen people.

<HEADLINE> Strip-for-groceries Teacher Cleared </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CINCINNATI (AP) -- A male stripper who offered to perform at a  
party in return for groceries has been cleared of charges he 
misused food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	Benford Clay, a substitute teacher in Dayton, attracted the  
attention of authorities with posters advertising his 
``Nastymixxx'' dance service. 
</P>
<P>
	In the posters, Clay, 31, offered to dance at baby showers,  
birthday parties and family reunions -- all of which is not illegal 
in itself -- but he also offered to accept food stamps as payment. 
</P>
<P>
	An undercover officer testified that Clay went shopping with  
her, picked out $300 in groceries and insisted she use her food 
stamp debit card to pay. In return, he gave her a contract agreeing 
to perform at her party. 
</P>
<P>
	But Judge Thomas Crush ruled Tuesday that because Clay himself  
did not use the cards, he could not be convicted of illegal use of 
food stamps. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's an interesting method of using food stamps,'' the judge  
said. ``What can you say about this use of public funds, except 
that maybe some people aren't as hungry as they appear to be?''

<HEADLINE> Gov't Confronts Microsoft Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government is focusing part of this week  
on what is widely seen as the weakest link in its antitrust case 
against Microsoft: the company's decision to build Internet browser 
software into its popular Windows operating system. 
</P>
<P>
	But its questioning of Richard Schmalensee of the Massachusetts  
Institute of Technology largely broke down over semantics Tuesday, 
as both sides argued over the meaning of ``browser,'' the software 
that lets people view information on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	The government charges that Microsoft Corp. illegally ``tied''  
separate products by distributing its browser free within Windows, 
a move that dramatically changed the industry but was partially 
vindicated last year by a federal appeals court. 
</P>
<P>
	When precisely Microsoft made that decision was the issue the  
government tried to highlight Tuesday. The government maintains 
that the decision was made after June 1995 to try to ``crush'' 
Netscape, whose own rival Internet software once earned tens of 
millions of dollars. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft maintains that its browser isn't a separate product  
from newer versions of Windows and therefore can't be subject to 
antitrust ``tying'' claims. 
</P>
<P>
	Asked about Microsoft's plans for its browser, Schmalensee  
described the company's decision to build ``browser functionality'' 
into Windows, a catchall phrase that can include the software 
underpinnings used by many third-party Windows communications 
programs, including Netscape's browser. 
</P>
<P>
	The distinction is important. The government has argued a  
difference between support for browsers under Windows and the free 
distribution of such products. 
</P>
<P>
	In a February 1998 e-mail made public last week, Microsoft  
executive Nathan Myhrvold cautioned about using precise language 
for a poll the company was conducting. 
</P>
<P>
	``The name 'browser' suggests a separate thing,'' Myhrvold  
wrote. ``... Instead you need to ask a more neutral question about 
how Internet technology needs to merge with local computing. I have 
been pretty successful in trying this on various journalists and 
industry people.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies asked Schmalensee Tuesday  
whether any internal Microsoft document about the Internet ever 
included the words ``browser functionality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Ever see one before 1998, sir?'' Boies asked.  
</P>
<P>
	``I haven't done an exhaustive survey of the language,''  
Schmalensee answered. ``Certainly by early 1995, the decision had 
been made ... that the browser would be part of Windows.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee also acknowledged that the earliest versions of  
Windows 95 didn't include Microsoft's browser, which was sold 
separately but added into Windows later. 
</P>
<P>
	The government claimed that was further evidence that Microsoft  
had illegally combined separate products to compete against 
Netscape. 
</P>
<P>
	``They combined it after the fact, bolted it on after the  
fact,'' Boies said outside court. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft frequently cites a June appeals court ruling that  
bundling of its Internet software with Windows 95 was legal and a 
``genuine integration'' because consumers benefited. Legal experts 
have said the appeals court decision largely undermines the 
government's tying claim, which had been filed months earlier.

<HEADLINE> Senate Offers Internet Schools Bill </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Schools and libraries getting federally  
subsidized Internet hookups would have to install computer software 
to block material inappropriate for children under a Senate bill 
offered Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation, which aims to shield kids from sexually  
explicit material on the Web, recommends no specific screening 
device, leaving it to schools and libraries to decide. 
</P>
<P>
	Libraries would have to have at least one computer equipped with  
the software. 
</P>
<P>
	Senate Commerce Committee chairman John McCain, R-Ariz., and its  
top Democrat, Ernest Hollings of South Carolina, wrote the bill, 
which to become law would have to pass both chambers of Congress 
and be signed by the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools and libraries that already have federally subsidized  
hookups also would have to install the screening software because 
the bill would apply retroactively, committee spokeswoman Pia 
Pialorsi said. 
</P>
<P>
	Schools and libraries can use the subsidies to cover costs of  
the filtering software. 
</P>
<P>
	Civil liberties groups said a different version of the bill  
offered last year was unconstitutional.

<HEADLINE> Comcast Sells Cellular Operations </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- The cable television system operator Comcast  
Corp. is selling its cellular telephone operations to the regional 
phone company SBC Communications for about $1.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	The deal announced today underscores the rapid transformation in  
the telephone industry where providers of traditional phone service 
are positioning themselves to reap big profits expected from 
cellular phones. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC, originally Southwestern Bell and one of the seven so-called  
Baby Bells created by the 1984 breakup of AT&AMP;T, is one of the 
nation's largest local phone companies. 
</P>
<P>
	San Antonio-based SBC has 6.5 million cellular subscribers in 16  
states and the District of Columbia, while Comcast has about 
850,000 cellular customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast President Brian L. Roberts said the sale is also an  
acknowledgment by Comcast of the trend toward national and global 
competitors in the wireless industry. 
</P>
<P>
	Only last Friday, Britain's Vodafone Group PLC bought San  
Francisco-based AirTouch Communications Inc. for $56 billion in 
cash and stock to become the world's largest cellular phone 
company. 
</P>
<P>
	That mammoth deal followed a two-week bidding war for AirTouch,  
the nation's second-largest independent cellular phone company. 
Bell Atlantic, a formidable East Coast phone company, had also bid 
for AirTouch. 
</P>
<P>
	Comcast added 50,000 cellular subscribers last year but has  
shown little inclination to build its own national network. 
</P>
<P>
	Roberts said Comcast -- which also owns the Philadelphia Flyers  
hockey and 76ers basketball teams -- plans to focus on its cable TV 
systems and programming businesses. 
</P>
<P>
	SBC Wireless's chief executive, Stan Sigman, said the addition  
of Comcast Cellular will enable SBC to offer greater services to 
its wireless customers. 
</P>
<P>
	The sale needs the approval of state and federal regulators.

leading the Quakers to a 13-13 season, the team's best mark since 
the 1990-91 season. 
</P>
<P>
	Currently, Penn is 3-10 overall and 1-2 in the Ivy League.  
</P>
<P>
	Prior to joining Penn, Soriero was head coach at Philadelphia  
Textile for seven season. While there she compiled a record of 
122-37, guiding the Lady Rams to the NCAA Division II Final Four in 
1986 and to the NCAA Divison II first round in 1989.

<HEADLINE> NBA Lockout Deal Still Not Settled </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- With opening night less than 2 1/2 weeks away, the  
NBA lockout settlement still hasn't been completed. 
</P>
<P>
	By the time the lawyers are finished, who knows? Maybe Dennis  
Rodman will be unretired and Antonio McDyess will finally have made 
up his mind. 
</P>
<P>
	The laborious task of reducing the lockout settlement into  
written form dragged on today. After meeting all night and settling 
the most contentious issue, lawyers for the league and the union 
were still haggling over a few last sticking points. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides seemed to think an agreement could be reached later  
today, which would clear the way for deals to commence and training 
camps to open before the weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	In the meantime, the rumors kept coming and the plots kept  
twisting as teams maneuvered to get ready for the scheduled Feb. 5 
start of the season. 
</P>
<P>
	``It'll get done. It always gets done,'' agent David Falk said.  
``This just gives us more time to talk to people and refine our 
numbers.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The main sticking point between the sides had been whether the  
new middle-class exception can be used for a three-year contract 
(the league's contention) or a six-year contract (the union's 
contention). 
</P>
<P>
	The union won that argument, but a final snag developed over the  
league's insistence upon having discipline authority over agents 
involved in salary cap circumvention. Another snag concerned 
whether bonus money would be counted in trade calculations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rod Strickland, meanwhile, was miffed at the offer being made by  
the Washington Wizards. The Washington Post said the Wizards were 
offering three years and $30 million, with two additional years 
non-guaranteed, and had given Strickland a deadline of midnight 
tonight. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't think he'll be back here,'' Falk told The Associated  
Press today. ``We're trying to get him to New York. He loves it 
that they have (Latrell) Sprewell, Allan Houston and Larry Johnson 
there, and he thinks they can win a championship. I'd like to get 
him there so Patrick (Ewing) can win a championship.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Falk was exploring other options for Strickland, including  
several sign-and-trade deals that would send last season's NBA 
assist leader to another team. He said four or five teams were 
making bids, but refused to name anyone other than the Knicks. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman added a strange subplot to Tuesday's events as his agent,  
Dwight Manley, announced that Rodman was retiring. Hours later, the 
league's leading rebounder for the past seven seasons said he was 
more in a state of ``limbo'' than retirement. 
</P>
<P>
	McDyess put off until today a decision on where he'll play --  
Denver or Phoenix, and several signs seemed to be pointing to the 
Nuggets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Tom Gugliotta rumors were strong, too, with the Nuggets,  
Suns and Lakers all interested. A source close to the Lakers said 
Los Angeles was offering Elden Campbell, Eddie Jones and rookie Sam 
Jacobsen to the Timberwolves in a sign-and-trade deal for 
Gugliotta. 
</P>
<P>
	``It defies logic, in my opinion,'' Suns owner Jerry Colangelo  
said of the deliberations concerning McDyess. ``We think this is a 
great spot for him. He seemed very happy here. We love him as a 
young guy and a future star in this league. But a lot of things 
have happened this offseason.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Nuggets also were wondering whether they would be spurned by  
Gugliotta in the event that McDyess stays in Phoenix. If so, they 
were expected to look to sign free-agent center Vlade Divac. 
</P>
<P>
	No event symbolized the day's craziness like the ``retirement''  
of Rodman. 
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to play this year,'' Rodman told Fox Sports  
News. ``I am in limbo, but I'm not going to say I'm retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	That's not how his former coach heard it. In a strange twist  
earlier in the day, Chuck Daly of the Orlando Magic said he heard 
Rodman was traded to the New York Knicks for Buck Williams -- a 
rumor that was quickly shot down.	   Also Tuesday, it was learned that John Starks and Chris Mills 
are the players who will be traded from the Knicks to the Golden 
State Warriors for Latrell Sprewell. Word of the Sprewell trade got 
out Monday night, just a few hours after another major trade was 
revealed -- Scottie Pippen going from the Chicago Bulls to the 
Houston Rockets. 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls also have sign-and-trade deals worked out for Luc  
Longley and Steve Kerr. 
</P>
<P>
	Colangelo confirmed that the Suns will trade three of the five  
players they have under contract -- Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and 
Bubba Wells -- for Longley. 
</P>
<P>
	In another agreed-upon deal, the Seattle SuperSonics were set to  
send center Jim McIlvaine to the New Jersey Nets for veteran 
forwards Michael Cage and Don MacLean. 
</P>
<P>
	The Utah Jazz were expected to sign Nuggets free-agent forward  
Johnny Newman, who would take the place of free agent Chris Morris. 
The Jazz also went looking for another big man after learning that 
Greg Foster fractured an ankle. Utah was believed to have spoken to 
Chicago about a sign-and-trade deal involving Bill Wennington, 
although no trade agreement was reached. 
</P>
<P>
	The Miami Heat and Golden State Warriors, who couldn't agree on  
a Sprewell deal, nonetheless continued to discuss several 
multiplayer deals. Heat coach Pat Riley was thought to have 
interest in reuniting with Starks, and a deal was being discussed 
that would sent Brent Barry, Terry Mills and Duane Causwell to the 
Warriors for Clarence Weatherspoon, Tony Delk and Felton Spencer. 
</P>
<P>
	There were reports of a possible Starks-Barry deal, but it would  
not work salary-cap wise under the league's complicated trade 
rules.

<HEADLINE> Mall Bans Smoking on Tobacco Road </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WINSTON-SALEM, N.C.(AP) -- The mall in the hometown of the  
nation's second-largest tobacco company is banning smoking in all 
common areas. 
</P>
<P>
	The ban at the Hanes Mall will begin Monday. Stores and  
restaurants in the mall will continue to set their own policies. 
</P>
<P>
	R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Co. is no longer the largest employer in  
town, but many in Winston-Salem are unwilling to offend those whose 
livelihoods depend on tobacco, and hospitals, stores and other 
public places were relatively late in banning smoking. 
</P>
<P>
	Hanes Mall manager Dennis Cerny said the shopping center had put  
off a decision ``due to our sensitivity to the local tradition and 
the tobacco-based economy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``However, we can no longer delay our implementation of a  
no-smoking policy due to our concern for the health of our 
employees and customers,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Tameka Joyner, 25, almost dropped the cigarette out of her mouth  
when told she would have to go outside if she wanted to light up. 
</P>
<P>
	``Oh, no, stop playing. It's stressful already,'' she said.  
``They should have a designated smoking area in there, especially 
when it's cold.'' 
</P>
<P>
	A spokesman for Reynolds said the smoking bans discriminate  
against adult smokers and have no basis in science.

<HEADLINE> Martian Landscape Tied to Volcano </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Underground volcanic action on ancient Mars sculpted gorges far  
larger than the Grand Canyon and melted enough water to feed floods 
of biblical proportions, two geologists theorize. 
</P>
<P>
	Most scientists have attributed Mars' gorges to the bowing and  
stretching of the terrain from surface forces. Under the new 
theory, such features were instead shaped from below by rising 
wedges of molten rock known as dikes. 
</P>
<P>
	Under the new theory, the dikes would have also melted vast  
quantities of ice. This would explain the colossal floods that 
scientists generally believe scoured Mars 2-3 billion years ago. 
</P>
<P>
	The theory, which appears Thursday in the journal Nature, was  
devised by geologists Dan McKenzie and Francis Nimmo at the 
University of Cambridge in England. 
</P>
<P>
	Under their scenario, dikes pushed up to within several miles of  
the surface, forcing the rock above to jut upward and outward. The 
area in the middle sagged, forming a canyon. 
</P>
<P>
	Meanwhile, the molten rock melted ice in the frozen ground,  
underground pools formed and spread, and the rock above -- as if 
afloat -- shifted into the broken, chaotic pattern characteristic of 
Mars. 
</P>
<P>
	The water trapped underground could have offered the sort of  
warm, moist oases where some have suggested that life could have 
survived. 
</P>
<P>
	When the water ultimately found its way to the surface, it  
collected in the canyons. The two geologists calculated that such a 
process could have let loose floods of 400 trillion gallons or 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	McKenzie argued that a gigantic dike larger than any on Earth,  
or a series of smaller ones, could run beneath the canyon network 
known as the Valles Marineris, the planet's best-known landmark. 
</P>
<P>
	The Valles Marineris stretches about 2,500 miles -- roughly the  
distance from New York to San Francisco -- and runs as deep as six 
miles. Its walls tower more than five times higher than the Grand 
Canyon's. 
</P>
<P>
	Alfred McEwen, a geologist at the University of Arizona,  
challenged the molten dike theory as the explanation for Mars' 
canyons. He said there is scant evidence that there was full-scale 
volcanic activity, such as volcanoes or lava flow, at the time the 
gorges took shape.

<HEADLINE> Feds To Sue Tobacco Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- President Clinton's promised federal suit  
seeking hundreds of billions of dollars from the tobacco companies 
will not put to rest his fight for a share of the $246 billion 
states already have won from cigarette makers. 
</P>
<P>
	``We still believe we are entitled to a portion of the state  
settlement under the law. ...That is separate and apart from this 
suit,'' an administration official told The Associated Press after 
Clinton announced the suit in his State of the Union address 
Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier Tuesday, Sen. George Voinovich, R-Ohio, introduced a  
bill that would forbid the federal government from grabbing a share 
of the settlement money states negotiated from tobacco companies. 
</P>
<P>
	The administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity,  
said a task force from the Justice Department's civil division 
would decide on the timing and best legal arguments for the suit. 
</P>
<P>
	It will claim that tobacco companies owe the government for tax  
dollars spent on treating smoking-related illnesses through 
Medicare, the Defense Department, Veterans Affairs, federal 
employee health benefits and other federal programs 
</P>
<P>
	``We feel it's more important this be done right than be done  
quickly,'' this official said. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton cast the litigation as an effort to combat youth  
smoking: ``Our children are targets of a massive media campaign to 
hook them on cigarettes.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He told Congress that ``the states have been right about this.  
Taxpayers shouldn't pay for the cost of lung cancer, emphysema and 
other smoking-related illnesses; the tobacco companies should.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyers, he said, were ``preparing a  
litigation plan to take the tobacco companies to court and, with 
the funds we recover, to strengthen Medicare.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Tobacco-state lawmakers of both parties were not pleased. Rep.  
Ron Lewis, R-Ky., called Clinton's plan ``another blow that's 
probably going to be the end of tobacco if he's not already 
accomplished that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Kentucky Democratic Rep. Ken Lucas agreed. ``What's bad for the  
tobacco companies is bad for the farmer, so I have some heartburn 
about that.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Through Medicare, the federal government pays for health care  
for 35 million elderly and disabled Americans. The Defense 
Department, Veterans Affairs programs and federal employee health 
benefit programs also use federal funds to pay for individuals' 
health treatment. The states and the federal government jointly pay 
for Medicaid insurance for the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	The Medical Care Recovery Act gives the government the right to  
recover the costs of treating people if a third party's negligence 
is to blame for their illnesses. In a fact sheet on planned suit, 
the Justice Department also cited the Medicare Secondary Payer Act, 
which permits the government to recover costs for injury done to 
Medicare recipients under certain circumstances. 
</P>
<P>
	Scott Williams, a tobacco industry spokesman, called Clinton's  
announcement ``a blatantly political act,'' saying the Justice 
Department had looked at the issue in the past and decided not to 
act on it. 
</P>
<P>
	He said the federal government will have a more difficult time  
arguing its case than the states did because the Office of the 
Surgeon General has been filing reports for decades on the dangers 
of smoking. ``The federal government cannot claim ignorance to the 
health risks associated with tobacco use,'' Williams said. 
</P>
<P>
	Some workers at the Philip Morris plant outside Richmond, Va.,  
said today it is unfair for the federal government to target the 
tobacco industry. ``I think it's a case of double jeopardy,'' said 
Tony Easter. ``First the states sue the tobacco companies, now the 
federal government. ``I think the federal government knew about the 
hazards of smoking when they put warning labels on cigarettes in 
the 1960s.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department spokesman Myron Marlin said Attorney General  
Janet Reno decided in September to draw up the suit ``after 
reviewing the relevant facts and the law and after deciding that 
there are appropriate bases on which to recover funds from the 
tobacco industry.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Four states reached independent deals last year with the tobacco  
industry worth a total of $40 billion, and the 46 others signed a 
separate $206 billion deal to recover the cost of treating 
Medicaid-eligible smokers. 
</P>
<P>
	For Clinton, who was stung by the failure of his much-hyped  
anti-youth-smoking campaign last year, a federal lawsuit held out 
the political benefit of pressuring the tobacco industry back to 
the negotiating table. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of his proposed budget for fiscal year 2000, Clinton  
also will seek an increase of 55 cents pack in the federal tax on 
cigarettes. A similar proposal last year failed with the tobacco 
bill. Clinton would use the increase to pay for some of his 
domestic spending plans.

<HEADLINE> Impeachment Trial Resumes Today </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- In a second day before Senate jurors, White  
House lawyers are challenging contentions by House prosecutors that 
President Clinton lied to a federal grand jury and obstructed 
justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the defense resumed its rebuttal today in the historic  
impeachment trial, each party in the Senate and the prosecution 
team were to hold separate strategy sessions to prepare for the 
next steps: senators' written questions, a motion to dismiss the 
case and a decision on calling witnesses. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's White House arguments showed ``there are conflicts in  
testimony that witnesses might resolve,'' Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, 
said today. He speculated that most of those who might be called 
could be helpful to Clinton's case. ``I don't know why the White 
House is so panic-stricken about it,'' he said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hatch, who chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, said he doubts  
Clinton wants to call any witnesses in his behalf. ``I think he 
would be nuts if he did.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., opposing the calling of any  
witnesses, noted that key figures in the case have been interviewed 
numerous times already. ``They said the same thing each time,'' he 
told NBC. ``Why are we going through this again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	An invitation to the president to testify was still under  
discussion. At a meeting of Senate Republicans on Tuesday, Sen. 
Arlen Specter, R-Pa., said he thought Clinton could be compelled to 
testify under Senate rules and court decisions. 
</P>
<P>
	White House officials said special counsel Gregory Craig would  
open today's trial session by attacking prosecutors' allegations 
that Clinton lied at least four times in his Aug. 17 grand jury 
appearance. The president contended then that he did not lie during 
his deposition a year ago in the Paula Jones sexual harassment case 
when he denied an affair with former White House intern Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	After Craig's presentation, White House Deputy Counsel Cheryl  
Mills was to argue against an obstruction-of-justice charge. She 
will maintain, for instance, that Clinton did not ask his 
secretary, Betty Currie, to retrieve presidential gifts from Ms. 
Lewinsky after they had been subpoenaed in December 1997 by the 
Mrs. Jones' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's trial session ended at midafternoon, providing a break  
before senators walked over to the House chamber to hear Clinton's 
State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deal with absurdities and contradictions around here every  
day,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Counsel Charles Ruff, in his opening remarks to the  
Senate on Tuesday, offered a point-by-point rebuttal to the House 
prosecution's case. Clinton, he said, did not lie under oath and 
did not try to obstruct Mrs. Jones' case by trying to keep Ms. 
Lewinsky from testifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff accused the House team of ``prosecutorial ... fudge'' on  
key evidence, and declared, ``We will defend the president on the 
facts and on the law and on the constitutional principles that must 
guide your deliberations.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Democrats made a special point of praising Ruff's rebuttal to  
prosecutors' contention that a job search for Ms. Lewinsky was an 
attempt to keep her from revealing her affair with Clinton to Mrs. 
Jones' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff told the Senate that an order from the Jones trial judge,  
which was damaging to Clinton, was issued hours after presidential 
friend Vernon Jordan met with Ms. Lewinsky in an intensified effort 
to find her a job. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors had left an impression that the order triggered the  
Lewinsky-Jordan meeting the morning of Dec. 11, 1997, Democrats 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	``A lot of people didn't know the order came ... late at night  
when Vernon Jordan was on an airplane,'' said Sen. Tom Harkin, 
D-Iowa. ``He really poked some holes ... as big as a barn door in 
the prosecution's case.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Carl Levin, D-Mich., speaking on the same point, asserted,  
``It is a very serious problem for the House of Representatives, 
which presented this fact erroneously. They made a representation 
that is a serious error.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Republicans mostly held their fire after Ruff's presentation,  
offering few comments. But prosecutors struck back in written 
responses that contrasted the ``White House claim'' with ``the 
truth'' on a number of allegations. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Charles Canady, R-Fla., said of Ruff's presentation: ``He's  
done the best job with what is an inherently weak case.'' Rep. 
Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., said it was ``hard to buy'' denials that 
Clinton obstructed justice. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Asa Hutchinson, R-Ark., one of the managers, said he didn't  
believe prosecutors ``should press the Senate'' for witnesses at 
this point, even though the prosecution team believes they're 
crucial to the House case. 
</P>
<P>
	Hutchinson said he ``would welcome the opportunity for the  
president to testify'' and said Ms. Lewinsky, Jordan, Mrs. Currie 
and others would ``help resolve conflicts that have been raised by 
Mr. Ruff.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff sharply attacked the prosecutors' case but did so mostly in  
a soft voice that only became emotional near the end of his 
two-hour presentation. His voice quavered as he responded to 
remarks last week by lead prosecutor Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., who 
spoke of soldiers who died defending the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	Recalling that his father fought at Omaha Beach on D-Day, Ruff  
said: ``He didn't fight -- no one fought -- for one side of this case 
or the other. He fought as all those did for our country, our 
Constitution.''

<HEADLINE>  Guatemala Rape Trial Opens </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ESCUINTLA, Guatemala (AP) -- Two men accused of raping a group of  
American college students in Guatemala last year told a court 
Wednesday they had nothing to do with the crime. 
</P>
<P>
	A third suspect declined to testify, but a three-judge panel  
heard a statement he gave police after his arrest, in which he also 
denied involvement. 
</P>
<P>
	One of the five rape victims took the stand Wednesday morning.  
The court was closed to the public and the media beforehand. 
</P>
<P>
	The three men, charged with rape and robbery in the January 1998  
attack, are accused of forcing a bus carrying 13 students and three 
faculty members from Maryland's St. Mary's College to stop at 
gunpoint, robbing the passengers, and raping five women in a sugar 
cane field near this southern Guatemalan town. 
</P>
<P>
	They face up to 30 years in prison if convicted.  
</P>
<P>
	One suspect, Cosbi Gamaliel Urias Ortiz, 37, who was arrested  
near the crime scene, said he had been traveling through the area 
on a bus, had stomach pains, and asked the driver to stop so he 
could relieve himself. The bus left without him, he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Another suspect, Rony Leonel Polanco Sil, 25, testified he was  
home with his family when the rapes occurred. 
</P>
<P>
	The third suspect, Reyes Buch Ventura, 25, was arrested near his  
home outside Guatemala City when he was spotted near a pickup truck 
believed to have been used by the attackers. He was carrying 8,000 
quetzales -- then about $1,230. He told police he had nothing to do 
with the attack and had earned the money selling wool hats. 
</P>
<P>
	Arrest warrants have been issued for five other suspects who  
remain at large. 
</P>
<P>
	Four of the rape victims planned to testify at the trial, which  
is expected to last one and a half weeks. Three of the students are 
recent graduates of St. Mary's and the fourth is still enrolled. 
</P>
<P>
	A professor who was in the bus during the attack, William Cecil  
Roberts, also was expected to testify. 
</P>
<P>
	Accompanying the victims to the trial were Maryland Deputy  
Attorney General Carmen M. Shepard, who is acting as a legal 
adviser, and college officials. 
</P>
<P>
	The study-abroad program at St. Mary's College remains largely  
unchanged after the attack, college spokeswoman Stacy Pruitt said.

<HEADLINE> Louis Armstrong Honored by Archive </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Louis Armstrong's gravelly laughter was  
contagious as it spilled from the speakers, filling a small 
conference room and drifting down the hallway. 
</P>
<P>
	Dozens of people giggled and howled as they listened to the  
recording at the Queens College library -- the late jazz king was 
being badgered by his wife about giving the wrong date during a 
home recording session, then trying to correct it only to get it 
wrong again. 
</P>
<P>
	It's one of many private moments that Armstrong captured in home  
recordings and now can be heard at the little-known Louis Armstrong 
House and Archive, the largest collection of Armstrong memorabilia 
in the country. 
</P>
<P>
	``Louis recorded everything. He had a trunk custom-made with  
recording equipment so he could take it with him on the road. It 
was like a 1950s Walkman,'' said archive Director Michael Cogswell. 
``Sometimes he would turn it on and leave it running for hours at a 
time.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The result: more than 650 tapes -- each more than four hours long  
-- that give a glimpse of Armstrong's wonderful world: his 
relationships with family and friends, and his love of singing and 
playing the trumpet. 
</P>
<P>
	The recordings, along with Armstrong's home and its contents,  
were left to the New York City Department of Cultural Affairs by 
Armstrong's wife, Lucille, after her death in 1983. Armstrong died 
in 1971. 
</P>
<P>
	The house is scheduled to open to visitors on July 4, 2000 --  
thought to be the 100th anniversary of Armstrong's birth. (The 
archive will still be housed at the library.) 
</P>
<P>
	Armstrong's belongings sat from 1983 to 1987 in the vacant house  
before they were extensively examined and the extent of the 
treasure trove was known. 
</P>
<P>
	``The Armstrong estate knew what was in the house. The  
conservators had told us, `You have got to get that stuff out of 
the house,''' Cogswell said. ``When we brought the stuff to the 
college, we found what the recordings were all about.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The archive, operated by the college, is copying every one of  
Armstrong's original recordings, which have become fragile over 
time. Because of the sheer volume of the recordings, the process is 
time-consuming and nobody has documented every word. 
</P>
<P>
	But gems have already been uncovered, such as a recording  
Armstrong made in a hotel room in 1960 that features him playing 
the trumpet along with a 1927 recording of himself with the 
legendary King Oliver. 
</P>
<P>
	And perhaps the greatest revelation about Armstrong is ``what  
you saw is what you got.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``The same person who was visiting with his buddies in the house  
in Corona (a section of Queens) was the same one who was on 
stage,'' Cogswell said. 
</P>
<P>
	That good nature made Armstrong an ambassador of good will, said  
first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton during a recent visit to the 
archive to promote her Save America's Treasures tour. 
</P>
<P>
	``He was not only an American ambassador overseas,'' Mrs.  
Clinton said. ``He was an ambassador of another kind ... between 
and among the races.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The archive is financed by public and private donations, and the  
house has been declared a national landmark. 
</P>
<P>
	Visitors to the archive are treated to a history lesson of  
Armstrong's life. According to Cogswell, Armstrong was called 
satchel mouth as a child because of his big, toothy smile. During a 
trip to London in 1932, a magazine editor shortened the nickname 
when he greeted Armstrong with ``Hello, Satchmo.'' Armstrong liked 
the name so much he used it as an album title. 
</P>
<P>
	Years of blowing the horn took their toll on Armstrong, who blew  
out his lip during a tour in Europe. After that, he used a special 
lip cream made for him by a pharmacist. 
</P>
<P>
	Four years before his death, Armstrong recorded ``What A  
Wonderful World,'' but it was far from a success. It wasn't until 
the Robin Williams movie ``Good Morning Vietnam'' in 1987 -- 16 
years after Armstrong's death -- that the song became a Top 40 hit. 
</P>
<P>
	Interest in Armstrong has grown in recent years. More than 1,200  
visitors went to the archive last year, and Cogswell gets five to 
10 e-mails a day. 
</P>
<P>
	Bernice and Jim Green from suburban Long Island sat in a small  
room off the main library during a recent presentation at the 
archives, hanging on every word as Armstrong's trademark scratchy 
voice blended with the static from the old recording. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's like going home -- listening to him as I was growing up,''  
Mrs. Green said.

<HEADLINE> Bulls in Midst of Major Overhaul </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CHICAGO (AP) -- Normal has never described Dennis Rodman.  
</P>
<P>
	So why should the end of his career be any different? His agent  
says he is retiring. Rodman says he's just taking a year off and 
isn't sure what's ahead. 
</P>
<P>
	For sure, the renegade rebounder whose wild hair colors and  
bountiful body piercings and tattoos made him the NBA's most 
flamboyant and often troubled character, is not coming back to the 
Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	The six-time NBA champions are in the midst of a major overhaul  
following Michael Jordan's retirement. Scottie Pippen is headed to 
Houston, Steve Kerr to San Antonio and Luc Longley to Phoenix. 
</P>
<P>
	You will, indeed, need a program this year to identify the team  
that won six NBA titles this decade. 
</P>
<P>
	And Rodman?  
</P>
<P>
	``I'm not going to play this year,'' he told Fox Sports News on  
Tuesday night. ``I am in limbo, but I'm not going to say I'm 
retired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Hours earlier, his West Coast-based agent Dwight Manley said  
Rodman is finished with the game because he wants to go to 
Hollywood. 
</P>
<P>
	There was even a rumor swirling that Rodman would be signed and  
then traded to the New York Knicks for Buck Williams. That was 
quickly brushed off. 
</P>
<P>
	``Dennis is retiring,'' Manley said, although Rodman has  
considered retiring in each of the last five years. ``He doesn't 
want to play.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He wants to go into the sports and entertainment field. Some  
people have convinced him that he wants to become a movie star.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Manley said there are several teams still interested in signing  
the wacky, 37-year-old Rodman, known for his ferocious workouts, 
frequent forays to Las Vegas and an ability to hit the boards that 
led to seven straight rebounding titles. 
</P>
<P>
	Manley, who said he is severing his relationship with Rodman,  
declined to identify those teams who might want Rodman's services. 
The Bulls traded for him in 1995. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman won championships with Chicago in 1996, 1997 and 1998,  
and two titles with the Detroit Pistons in 1989 and 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Bulls are rebuilding, shipping out the nucleus of a team  
that won the last three titles. They certainly don't need an aging 
rebounder who doesn't score and causes trouble. 
</P>
<P>
	Pippen, meanwhile, is the biggest winner in the Bulls  
sweepstakes. He will sign a five-year, $67.2 million deal with the 
Bulls -- with an additional $15 million in incentives -- who will 
then ship him to Houston once the lockout officially ends. In 
return, the Bulls get Roy Rogers -- Trigger not included -- and a 
second-round draft pick. 
</P>
<P>
	Three-point specialist Kerr gets a five-year, $11 million deal  
before heading to San Antonio for draft picks. And center Longley 
will get a five-year, $30 million package before being traded to 
Phoenix for Mark Bryant, Martin Muursepp and Bubba Wells. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman's off-court activities earned him much more notoriety  
than his rebounding. 
</P>
<P>
	He once announced his marriage, only to show up at a New York  
book signing in a wedding gown and blond wig -- sans groom; he 
offended Mormons and was fined $50,000 for making derogatory 
comments during the 1997 finals in Salt Lake City; he skipped 
practice during the NBA Finals last summer to attend a wrestling 
match in Detroit, and later as ``Rodzilla'' teamed with Hulk Hogan 
to beat Karl Malone and Diamond Dallas Page. 
</P>
<P>
	He drew a six-game suspension for head-butting referee Ted  
Bernhardt in 1996 and drew another for 11 games in 1997 for kicking 
a courtside cameraman in Minneapolis. 
</P>
<P>
	He was always in trouble, first with the Pistons; then during  
his brief stay in San Antonio, where his behavior damaged Spurs' 
chances at the NBA title; and finally during his three 
championships years with the Bulls, where he became a Chicago fan 
favorite for tossing his jersey into the stands after games. 
</P>
<P>
	His tardiness and selfish antics away from the court often  
tested his teammates' patience and that of coach Phil Jackson, who 
handled him as well as anyone could. 
</P>
<P>
	Jackson once suggested an ultimate therapy for his bad-boy board  
man. 
</P>
<P>
	``Electric shock is the next treatment,'' Jackson said.  
</P>
<P>
	Rodman has appeared in movies and TV shows, had a stint on MTV,  
and wrote his life story, ``Bad As I Wanna Be,'' that became a 
bestseller. 
</P>
<P>
	He has been sued -- most recently by a cocktail waitress who said  
he jammed a $100 bill down her blouse and grabbed her breast. 
</P>
<P>
	The man who once courted Madonna recently married Carmen  
Electra, his longtime girlfriend, although days later there were 
reports of an annulment filing. In another bizarre chapter, 
however, the former ``Baywatch'' actress later denied the marriage 
was off. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman didn't need the ball to be effective. His career scoring  
average was just 7.5 points, but at 6-foot-8 he was one of the 
great rebounders in league history with a 13.2 average and seven 
straight titles. 
</P>
<P>
	He had an uncanny sense of where the ball would come off the  
rim, in addition to the ability to tip rebounds to himself with his 
long arms. 
</P>
<P>
	And he was also one of the game's most bothersome defenders --  
grabbing, shoving and holding under the basket -- to the frustration 
of his opponents. 
</P>
<P>
	Rodman was selected by the Pistons in the second round of 1986  
and spent seven years there -- often roughing up Jordan and Pippen -- 
before being traded to the Spurs in 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	He came to the Bulls in 1995 and blended with Jordan and Pippen  
to help Chicago capture three straight titles.

<HEADLINE> Lawyer Recounts Fatal Shooting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RIVERSIDE, Calif. (AP) -- Hearing a boom and thinking he'd been  
wounded, a policeman began shooting at an incoherent woman inside a 
locked car with a gun, the officers' attorney said. 
</P>
<P>
	The origin of the sound wasn't clear, and it may have been one  
of the three other officers firing into the car, said Bill Hadden, 
who represents the four officers involved in the Dec. 28 killing of 
19-year-old Tyisha Miller, who was shot 12 times. 
</P>
<P>
	Police have released few details in the death. Some black  
activists and family members charged it was racially motivated. 
</P>
<P>
	The victim was black and the officers were white and Hispanic.  
</P>
<P>
	Two of the officers told investigators they fired after seeing  
Ms. Miller grab her gun. The fourth said the woman grabbed in the 
area of the gun, Hadden said. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were left to do something according to their best  
judgment at the time,'' Hadden said. 
</P>
<P>
	Hadden told The Press-Enterprise on Tuesday that the officers  
tried to help Ms. Miller, who appeared ill. 
</P>
<P>
	``They were there to save this person,'' he said. ``As far as  
this being a racially motivated killing, that's just an 
absurdity.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Rev. Bernell Butler, Ms. Miller's cousin, disputed the  
account. 
</P>
<P>
	``They can't even put together a viable story,'' Butler said.  
``They did what they came to do, and the proof is in the amount of 
bullets fired.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Officers fired 24 bullets at the woman in this city 60 miles  
east of Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	The officers called to the scene by relatives at about 2 a.m.  
said they found Ms. Miller sitting in the car at a gas station 
parking lot, a gun in her lap. The car had a flat tire, its doors 
were locked, the windows were rolled up and the engine was running. 
</P>
<P>
	Hadden said Ms. Miller was mostly unresponsive to the officers'  
screaming and banging on the door. 
</P>
<P>
	An officer then broke the driver's side window with his baton.  
The officer was about to reach into the car for the gun when he 
heard a ``boom,'' and jumped back, Hadden said. He and one or two 
other officers thought he had been shot. 
</P>
<P>
	Hadden would not specify the individual officers' roles.  
</P>
<P>
	Police have not said whether Ms. Miller fired at the officers.  
Preliminary toxicology results showed Ms. Miller had a 
blood-alcohol level of 0.13 percent. A driver in California is 
considered intoxicated at .08 percent.

<HEADLINE> Economic Outlook by Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	Summaries of regional economic conditions before Jan. 1,  
compiled by the 12 regional banks of the Federal Reserve: 
</P>
<P>
	BOSTON -- The ... economy shows somewhat mixed results. ... Only  
half of the contacted manufacturers report increases in business. 
... Slightly more than half the retail respondents cite sales above 
expectations, while the others report disappointing sales because 
of warm weather. Firms are doing little net hiring; wage increases 
continue in a 3- to 6-percent range. ... Prices are generally 
falling or stable. ... Residential real estate markets and the 
investment management industry are strong. 
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK -- Growth ... has picked up further ... with very few  
signs of upward price pressures. Although retailers report mixed 
sales results for December, all experienced a strong pickup toward 
the end of the month. ... The housing market continued to gain 
momentum. 
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA -- Activity ... was moving up as the new year began.  
On balance, manufacturers reported a slight improvement in business 
conditions, although weak Asian markets continued to hamper 
recovery for some industrial sectors. Retail sales ... met or came 
close to meeting most retailers' goals, and auto sales remained 
strong. ... Lending to both consumers and businesses was increasing 
and that mortgage activity was still robust. 
</P>
<P>
	CLEVELAND -- The ... economy continues to grow, though industrial  
activity has clearly moderated in a few industries. Most sectors 
and regions report strong production and steady income growth. 
Finding enough workers to meet demand is the No. 1 problem among 
temporary employment agencies. ... Workers with good communications 
skills have been in great demand. ... Union wage patterns are 
mixed, but the majority indicate little, if any, change from the 3 
percent average reported earlier. ... Job security is still a major 
concern, particularly among steelworkers. 
</P>
<P>
	RICHMOND -- The ... economy expanded at a faster pace ... boosted  
by a pickup in consumer spending. Retailers reported busy stores 
and stronger than expected sales. ... Service sector activity was 
flat, held back in part by inclement weather. ... Manufacturing 
activity was mixed. ... Growth in commercial and residential real 
estate held up well and lending activity remained strong. ... Wage 
growth continued strong in retail and services, but slowed in 
manufacturing. Prices of both goods and services were little 
changed. 
</P>
<P>
	ATLANTA -- The Southeast began 1999 with a healthy and balanced  
economic expansion. Retailers report that post-Christmas Day sales 
and heavy discounting helped to offset a slower than normal holiday 
shopping season. .... Home sales and construction increased 
slightly, and financial activity expanded moderately. ... 
Manufacturing production and new orders ... are soft ... but the 
outlook remains generally positive. Tight labor markets continue to 
be a major business concern, with some signs of increasing wage 
pressures. Prices generally remain stable. 
</P>
<P>
	CHICAGO -- The ... economy continued its modest pace of  
expansion. ... Consumers appeared to be the major driving force 
behind economic growth. Retail sales were generally above 
merchants' plans for the holiday season. ... New and existing home 
sales were, again, exceptionally strong. ... While some key 
manufacturing sectors continued to feel the adverse impacts of 
turmoil overseas, the motor vehicle industry and 
construction-related industries remained very robust. ... Employers 
in the region continued to find qualified labor in short supply, 
and there were a few new reports of intensifying wage pressures in 
some entry-level positions. 
</P>
<P>
	ST. LOUIS -- Economic growth ... continues at a moderate pace,  
despite less-than-glowing reports from retailers. ... Other 
business contacts saw relatively healthy conditions, with some 
reporting an unexpected growth in sales because of unusually warm 
weather. Labor markets remain tight, and worker ``poaching'' is on 
the rise again. ... Residential real estate markets remain strong. 
</P>
<P>
	MINNEAPOLIS -- The economy ... is strong. ... Business leader  
sentiment ... remains optimistic overall despite a few signs of 
caution. Construction ... is an economic locomotive with a full 
head of steam barreling through one record after another. ... 
Consumer spending continues very strong, as do most manufacturing 
operations. Labor markets remain tight and employment high. There 
are few signs, if any, of higher prices. 
</P>
<P>
	KANSAS CITY -- The ... economy grew moderately again last month,  
although widespread signs of easing remain. Holiday retail sales 
were very brisk. ... Construction activity also remained strong. 
But manufacturing activity in the district declined again and the 
energy sector weakened. ... Hog producers continued to have 
difficulties due to record-low prices. Labor markets remained very 
tight ... but wage pressures subsided somewhat. ... Prices remained 
flat at the retail level. 
</P>
<P>
	DALLAS -- Activity ... expanded at roughly the same pace. ...  
Demand for business services remained generally strong, and 
retailers reported a robust finish to the holiday sales period. 
Overall manufacturing activity was unchanged. Construction activity 
continued at a brisk pace. ... Crop and livestock conditions have 
been generally good. 
</P>
<P>
	SAN FRANCISCO -- Contacts indicated a solid, but tempered, pace  
of economic expansion. ... Retailers reported moderate sales 
growth. ... Manufacturing activity remained weak, although 
producers of some high-tech products noted a pickup in demand. ... 
Demand for residential and commercial real estate cooled slightly. 
... Financial conditions remained strong ... although commercial 
borrowers faced tighter terms.

<HEADLINE> General Motors Reports Record Profit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DETROIT (AP) -- General Motors Corp. overcame last summer's  
strikes and weak results overseas and posted a record 
fourth-quarter profit today of $1.8 billion, up 8 percent over the 
same period last year. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's earnings exceeded Wall Street analysts' expectations.  
</P>
<P>
	The world's largest automaker reported today that it earned  
$2.61 a fully diluted share, compared with the previous record of 
$1.7 billion, or $2.33 a share, in the last three months of 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Revenues totaled $46.4 billion, down 2 percent from $47.1  
billion a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	Investors weclomed the news, pushing GM's stock up 3 percent, or  
$2.62 1/2, to $90.62 1/2 in early trading on the New York Stock Exchange. 
</P>
<P>
	``Overseas results are still kind of tough, but they're being  
overwhelmed by good results in North America,'' said analyst David 
Healy of Burnham Securities Inc. ``They blew out the estimates as 
far as North America is concerned.'' 
</P>
<P>
	For the year, GM earned $3 billion, or $4.18 a share, down 53  
percent from the $6.3 billion, or $8.62 a share, earned in 1997. 
The decline largely reflected the cost of the strikes. Revenues for 
the year totaled $161.3 billion, down 6 percent from $171.2 billion 
in 1997. 
</P>
<P>
	The year's performance will result in profit-sharing checks of  
about $200 for 231,000 union workers in the United States. That 
compares with 1997's profit-sharing total of $750. Salaried workers 
will get $200 each, or 1 percent of their base salary, whichever is 
higher. 
</P>
<P>
	GM Chairman Jack Smith said he was encouraged by the  
fourth-quarter results. 
</P>
<P>
	``We came back strong following the work stoppage in midyear and  
we intend to keep this momentum going in the future,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's earnings report included after-tax charges totaling $420  
million, or 64 cents a share. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges included $80 million for the cost of severance  
packages and buyouts for employees let go as a result of the 
restructuring of GM's North American field sales and service staff 
and $192 million for underperforming assets, early retirement 
packages and the closing of unprofitable joint ventures at GM's 
Delphi Automotive Systems parts subsidiary. 
</P>
<P>
	The charges also included $97 million primarily for the effect  
of the Asian recession on GM's investments in India and Thailand, 
and $51 million for underperforming assets and severance packages 
related to cost-reduction efforts in Latin America. 
</P>
<P>
	Excluding special items, GM's fourth-quarter profit totaled $2.2  
billion, or $3.25 a share, compared with $1.4 billion, or $1.93 a 
share in October-December 1997. The average fourth-quarter earnings 
estimate of analysts surveyed by First Call Corp. was $2.61 a 
share. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's North American operations were responsible for the bulk of  
GM's fourth-quarter gain. The unit earned a record $1.6 billion; 
the previous record was $841 million in the first quarter of 1998. 
</P>
<P>
	The performance was enough to boost GM's cash reserves to $14.1  
billion, over the $13 billion that GM considers necessary to 
support new-product development, its pension plans and stockholder 
initiatives. The cash total was up from $11.5 billion at the end of 
1998's third quarter, when the strikes took their toll. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith credited the restoration of the cash reserve to  
cost-cutting and GM's ability to quickly resume full production 
after the strikes. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's North American plants produced more vehicles in last year's  
fourth quarter than in any fourth quarter in a decade as they 
rushed to restore strike-depleted inventories. Production totaled 
about 1.51 million cars and trucks; first quarter production is 
estimated at 1.47 million vehicles. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith said GM plans to reinstate its share-repurchase program  
during the first quarter; it had been postponed during the strikes. 
He said GM also plans to redeem its Series B 9 1/8 preference stock 
``in the near future.'' There are about 20 million depository 
shares of that stock with a face value of more than $500 million. 
</P>
<P>
	Elsewhere, the earnings were not as impressive. GM-Europe earned  
$146 million, while the automaker's Latin America-Africa-Mideast 
operations lost $212 million and Asia-Pacific operations lost $213 
million. 
</P>
<P>
	``We expect strong market conditions to continue in the United  
States and Europe in 1999, and fully intend to maintain our 
momentum in the market and to further strengthen our financial 
position,'' Smith said. ``However, the economic problems and 
uncertainty in Asia and Latin America will be a continuing 
challenge in 1999.'' 
</P>
<P>
	GM's big Delphi parts unit earned $280 million in the fourth  
quarter after adjustments for special items, down 20 percent from 
the $349 million it earned a year ago. Delphi Chairman J.T. 
Battenberg III blamed the economic downturn in Latin America. GM 
plans to spin off about 18 percent of Delphi in an initial public 
stock offering later this quarter, and distribute the rest to GM 
shareholders by the end of the year. 
</P>
<P>
	The company restated its fourth-quarter 1997 results to reflect  
the $10.1 billion sales of its Hughes Electronics defense unit in 
December of that year. GM also had after-tax charges totaling $4 
billion in that quarter for underperforming assets, the planned 
closure of the Buick City assembly complex in Flint, the sale of 
parts plants and leasing losses. 
</P>
<P>
	General Motors Acceptance Corp., the automaker's finance  
subsidiary, reported a $298 million profit for the fourth quarter, 
up 7 percent from $279 million a year ago. 
</P>
<P>
	GM's Hughes Electronics Corp. subsidiary earned $119 million, up  
70 percent from the $70 million it earned in the fourth quarter of 
1997. 
</P>
<P>
	Ford Motor Co. plans to report its earnings Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Steelworkers Seek Clinton's Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Steelworkers rallied in the capital Wednesday  
in hopes of persuading the Clinton administration to get tougher on 
cheap steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	A few thousand mill workers and supporters, blaring horns and  
carrying ``Stand Up For Steel'' signs, closed Pennsylvania Avenue's 
westbound lanes for an hour with a march from the Capitol to the 
White House. 
</P>
<P>
	Their chief complaint: Imports are coming in at prices so low  
that domestic producers cannot compete and have had to lay off at 
least 10,000 steelworkers. The industry wants an administration 
review that could lead to quotas and broad tariffs on foreign 
steel. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have four children at home. Unemployment doesn't make it for  
me,'' said Dan Stewart of Weirton, W.Va., a 22-year employee at 
Weirton Steel Corp., which recently laid off 858 workers. The 
company's management and workers helped organize Wednesday's rally. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton was in Buffalo, N.Y., at the time, to promote  
initiatives he outlined in his Tuesday night State of the Union 
address. But Rep. Bob Ney, R-Ohio, and a union leader were able to 
hold an unscheduled meeting with a top White House aide. 
</P>
<P>
	At a rally outside the Capitol, members of Congress, steel  
executives and union leaders blamed Clinton for focusing too much 
on the world economy. 
</P>
<P>
	As Joe Vojvodich, a retired Weirton steelworker from Richmond,  
Ohio, walked pass the Treasury building, he shouted: ``Wake up. 
Wake up. Your job could be next.'' Marchers carried ``Dump Rubin, 
Not Steel'' signs. 
</P>
<P>
	Some administration figures, led by Treasury Secretary Robert  
Rubin, believe that increasing U.S. trade barriers would send the 
wrong message as the United States tries to help other countries 
recover from the Asian financial crisis. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton offered $300 million in tax breaks for the steel  
industry this month, a gesture that many producers denounced 
because it would first require them to post losses. 
</P>
<P>
	White House spokesman Barry Toiv said administration officials  
``fully understand the concerns of the workers and the industry'' 
and are considering several other relief options. 
</P>
<P>
	``Clinton has the power to stop this if he wants to,'' said  
William Ferrelli, 47, a 27-year mill veteran from Burgettstown, Pa. 
``I don't think this will change his mind, but at least it will 
open his eyes and let him know we're not going to forget.'' 
</P>
<P>
	At a news conference, U.S. Trade Representative Charlene  
Barshefsky said the United States would waste no time filing a case 
against Japan's rising steel imports if they are not decisively 
lower in December's yet-unannounced trade figures. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton pledged during his State of the Union address that  
``America will respond'' if the import surge from Japan is not 
reversed. 
</P>
<P>
	Lawmakers from steel-producing states offered several  
legislative remedies Wednesday, including a quota bill that Sen. 
Jay Rockefeller, D-W.Va., termed the ``nuclear bomb'' of trade 
legislation. 
</P>
<P>
	Rockefeller and Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., also proposed a  
program of import permits and monitoring and to make it easier to 
prove injury in trade disputes. 
</P>
<P>
	``This surge of imports in steel has been devastating and  
unfair,'' said Specter, chairman of the Senate Steel Caucus. 
</P>
<P>
	Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan warned at a House  
hearing that quotas and other remedies ``will create retaliation 
and undercut our whole trading system.'' 
</P>
<P>
	He said he was ``very chagrined'' about the plight of the  
domestic steel industry but believed that offering ``very generous 
basic support for the workers'' was a more favorable alternative.

	White House Attacks Perjury Charge  
</P>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- House-passed articles of impeachment are  
``flawed and unfair,'' President Clinton's legal team argued before 
the Senate today in a finely detailed, sometimes emotional defense 
that challenged each claim of perjury and obstruction of justice. 
The allegations ``do not justify the nullification of a free 
election,'' said Special Counsel Gregory Craig. Craig and Deputy 
White House Counsel Cheryl Mills spliced together videotape, 
transcripts and even the words of House prosecutors as they 
challenged claims that Clinton broke the law to cover up a sexual 
affair with Monica Lewinsky. 

</P>
<P>
	Clinton Takes Message on the Road  
</P>
<P>
	BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) -- President Clinton, at his first public  
rally since his impeachment, said today he was ready for a major 
clash with Congress over his plan to save Social Security. Clinton 
has proposed using some 60 percent of the federal surplus he 
anticipates, totaling $4 trillion over 15 years. Republicans want 
to use at least part of that for a tax cut. Clinton was on the road 
promoting the agenda he laid out in the State of the Union address. 
The speech boosted his job approval rating, which ranged from 66 
percent to 76 percent in new polls.

	NATO Moves Forces Near Yugoslavia  
</P>
<P>
	BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) -- While still seeking a diplomatic  
solution to the escalating violence in Kosovo, NATO ambassadors 
dispatched frigates, destroyers and planes closer to Yugoslavia. 
They also shortened pilots' readiness time for airstrikes from 96 
to 48 hours after Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic rebuffed 
their demands to halt the fighting. New fighting erupted today in 
northern Kosovo between Serb police and ethnic Albanians fighting 
to secede from Yugoslavia, killing at least two rebels and leaving 
a Serb mother and her two children injured.

	Israel: Statehood Delay Not Enough  
</P>
<P>
	JERUSALEM (AP) -- Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said that  
even if Yasser Arafat postpones a declaration of statehood until 
the end of the year, Israel will not resume West Bank troop 
withdrawals promised in recent peace accords. Netanyahu froze 
implementation of the land-for-security deal with the Palestinians 
five weeks after it was signed, in part because of Arafat's 
repeated pledges to declare independence. But Netanyahu said today 
that Arafat must agree to negotiate a permanent settlement, and 
also carry out other security commitments.

	ACLU Asks for Secrecy in Porn Case  
</P>
<P>
	PHILADELPHIA (AP) -- Lawyers for the American Civil Liberties  
Union asked a judge today to close parts of a hearing challenging a 
federal law to keep Internet pornography away from children. The 
ACLU said some of the plaintiffs wanted to present information 
containing trade secrets, business plans and other financial 
information. Claiming a First Amendment violation, the ACLU is 
challenging the Child Online Protection Act, which would require 
commercial Web sites to require proof of age before allowing users 
to view material deemed ``harmful to minors.''

nation's largest air carrier, said ``it has expressed to America 
West Airlines an interest in a possible acquisition of America 
West.'' America West Holdings Corp. issued a statement that said it

	NEW YORK (AP) -- Combining artificial insemination with hormone  
treatments appears to give infertile couples a better chance of 
pregnancy than either method alone. A study in tomorrow's New 
England Journal of Medicine looked at 932 couples. Researchers

<HEADLINE> Iraqi Opposition Group Rejects U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	CAIRO, Egypt (AP) -- A prominent Iraqi opposition group on  
Wednesday turned down support offered by President Clinton for 
efforts to oust Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein, saying accepting 
American help would hurt their cause. 
</P>
<P>
	However, two other groups -- the London-headquartered Iraqi  
National Congress and the Jordanian-based Iraqi National Accord -- 
welcomed the American offer, which stems from the Iraq Liberation 
Act adopted last year. 
</P>
<P>
	Rejection came from the Tehran-based Supreme Council for Islamic  
Revolution in Iraq, an umbrella for several Shiite Muslim groups. 
</P>
<P>
	``We don't get support under this act,'' said Hamid al-Bayati,  
the council's representative in London. ``We haven't asked for it, 
and nobody took our opinion about it.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Al-Bayati added that ``receiving such support from America would  
harm the opposition's reputation inside Iraq.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton on Tuesday designated seven organizations opposed to  
Saddam to receive U.S. support under the 1998 act, which calls for 
providing up to $97 million in overt military aid to Iraqi 
opposition groups. The Supreme Council for Islamic Revolution in 
Iraq was among them. 
</P>
<P>
	In a statement faxed to The Associated Press in Cairo, the Iraqi  
National Congress -- an umbrella organization of Kurdish, Shiite and 
leftist groups based in London -- welcomed its nomination for U.S. 
support. 
</P>
<P>
	Maad Abdel-Rahim, a leader of the Iraqi National Accord, said in  
a telephone interview from Amman that his group accepts ``any 
support from the international community and the big powers which 
believe that the change of the regime should come from inside 
Iraq.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Other groups named to receive U.S. support were three Kurdish  
factions based in northern Iraq: the Kurdistan Democratic Party, 
the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Islamic Movement of Iraqi 
Kurdistan. Also selected was the Movement for a Constitutional 
Monarchy, based in London. 
</P>
<P>
	In related events Wednesday:  
</P>
<P>
	--A U.S. Embassy official in Ankara, Turkey, said the United  
States delivered Patriot anti-missile batteries to Turkey as extra 
defense against any Iraqi attack. The missiles arrived at Incirlik 
Air Base, home to U.S. and British planes enforcing a northern 
``no-fly'' zone in Iraq, the official told the AP in Ankara on 
condition of anonymity. 
</P>
<P>
	The official refused to say how many Patriot batteries arrived,  
adding deployment would take several days. About 150 U.S. Army 
personnel will be stationed in Incirlik to operate the missile 
systems, the official said. 
</P>
<P>
	--Saddam made what was believed to be his first publicized trip  
outside of the Iraqi capital since American and British airstrikes 
Dec. 16-19 to punish Baghdad for failing to cooperate with U.N. 
weapons inspectors. Saddam supervised the cooking of a village 
feast Wednesday and fired a rifle in the air to celebrate the 
Muslim holiday of Eid al-Fitr. 
</P>
<P>
	State-run Iraqi television also showed Saddam watching the  
traditional slaughter of a sheep and praying. The broadcast, 
monitored in Cairo, did not indicate exactly where the village was.

<HEADLINE> Tornado Victims Start Rebuilding </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSON, Tenn. (AP) -- Tornado survivors and cleanup volunteers  
paused for a brief prayer service Wednesday amid the debris and 
rubble that once was a thriving, well-kept subdivision. 
</P>
<P>
	The service came as officials reported being overwhelmed with  
offers of help and donations. 
</P>
<P>
	``Lord, we need your healing hands to be with us,'' said  
Dietrich Kirk, youth pastor at Northside United Methodist Church of 
Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	The 60 or so people gathered for the service, many of them young  
volunteers from area churches, sang ``Lord, you are more precious 
than silver,'' and prayed for the victims and their families. 
</P>
<P>
	The tornado that ripped through the Charles Latham subdivision  
Sunday demolished two-thirds of the houses in the neighborhood. It 
was spawned by a storm system that killed eight people and damaged 
or destroyed more than 1,600 homes and businesses across West and 
Middle Tennessee. 
</P>
<P>
	Many of the survivors starting the long cleanup and rebuilding  
were joined by friends and relatives. Professional builders and 
even a crew of inmates from the Madison County Penal Farm also were 
busy at work. 
</P>
<P>
	City officials said donations of food, clothing and other  
emergency supplies have been pouring in, and many volunteers have 
stepped forward to help with the cleanup.

<HEADLINE>  High Stock Prices Worry Greenspan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While calling the economy's current  
performance ``outstanding,'' Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan expressed worries today that the high-flying stock market 
could be headed for a tumble that could spell serious trouble down 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also criticized a key part of President Clinton's  
Social Security rescue plan, saying the government could damage the 
economy by investing huge sums of money in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	None of Greenspan's comments today suggested to analysts that  
the Fed would be changing interest rates any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But his expressions of concern about the altitude of the stock  
market gave support to views that the central bank is unlikely to 
rush to cut rates further unless global turmoil sends markets into 
a severe downturn such as occurred last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	The Dow Jones average fell 55 points as he read his statement,  
but at midafternoon it was up 85 points. 
</P>
<P>
	Separately, a survey prepared for the Fed's next interest-rate  
meeting in two weeks found ``most regions are showing solid 
economic growth overall'' through early January. Still, the survey 
of regional conditions, known as the ``beige book,'' noted that 
growth in some areas -- manufacturing, farming, oil and mining -- had 
slowed in some parts of the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, an influential voice Congress often turns to on  
economic matters, said he supports Clinton's major idea to put 62 
percent of the government's budget surpluses into Social Security's 
cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	But he expressed serious reservations about a part of Clinton's  
plan that would allow a government board to direct about a quarter 
of those savings into stock market investments. It is unlikely that 
these investments could be insulated from political considerations, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, Greenspan said it is more important to use budget  
surpluses to reduce the federal debt as a way of boosting the 
national savings rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's channeling trillions of dollars over the years  
into U.S. companies would eventually lower America's productivity 
rates, the key to rising standards of living, because of pressures 
to help less efficient industries rather than letting market forces 
decide what companies to fund, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe that it is politically feasible to insulate  
such huge funds from government direction,'' Greenspan told the 
House Ways and Means Committee. ``I am fearful that we would use 
those assets in a way that would create a lower rate of return for 
social Security recipients and even greater concern it would create 
sub-optimal use of capital and a lower standard of living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks today on the level of the stock market were  
his most extensive worrying aloud about whether prices had risen 
too high since his famous comments about ``irrational exuberance'' 
in December 1996, when the Dow Jones industrial average was nearly 
3,000 points lower than it is today. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan noted that stocks have been climbing into record  
territory this year and called this fact unusual, given that 
corporate profits, the underpinning of stock prices, have been 
weaker. 
</P>
<P>
	He said this weakness in profits raised the ``possibility that  
the recent performance of the equity markets will have difficulty 
in being sustained. The level of equity prices would appear to 
envision substantially greater growth of profits than has been 
experienced of late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said a tumble in stock prices could quickly over into  
the real economy through what economists call the ``wealth 
effect,'' the fact that consumers spend more when their net worth 
is rising and cut back when they face reversals. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been robust consumer spending that in large part has kept  
the U.S. economy steaming ahead in the face of the severe global 
turmoil that began in Asia in mid-1997. 
</P>
<P>
	``A decline in equity (stock) values, especially a severe one,  
could lead to a considerable weakening of consumer demand,'' 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan stressed today that the Fed's actions last year were  
not prompted by a desire to protect investors from a drop in stock 
prices, but rather to protect the overall economy from a downturn 
caused by a cut in consumer spending that could result from 
tumbling markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Greenspan said some slowing in the U.S. economy this  
year would be desirable, given the rapid pace of recent growth that 
has pushed the nation's unemployment rate to a three-decade low. 
</P>
<P>
	The global economic crisis threatened to flare anew last week  
when Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, was forced to 
devalue its currency. ``So far, markets seem to have reacted 
reasonably well to the decisions by the Brazilian authorities to 
float their currency and redouble efforts at fiscal discipline,'' 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economists are looking for growth to slow markedly in 1999  
as the drag from foreign turmoil finally begins to bite. But the 
slowdown has yet to occur and for that reason, economists don't 
believe the Fed will move anytime soon to cut rates.

<HEADLINE> Top Canadian Skier To Miss a Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KITZBUEHEL, Austria (AP) -- Brian Stemmle, a 15-year veteran of  
Canada's ski team, will miss a month of the World Cup season after 
injuring his shoulder today during a downhill practice run. 
</P>
<P>
	Skiing on the world's most dangerous downhill course, Stemmle  
was injured almost 10 years to the day after he was nearly killed 
on the same slopes. 
</P>
<P>
	He partially tore ligaments in his shoulder after hitting a gate  
at top speed. He veered out of control and crashed into the 
security fence almost three-quarters through his run. 
</P>
<P>
	He refused a rescue helicopter and made his way down the Streif  
course before being taken to a hospital. 
</P>
<P>
	In 1989, Stemmle broke his pelvis and sustained massive internal  
injuries on this course, and doctors were convinced he would not 
live. 
</P>
<P>
	Stemmle put off a return to Kitzbuehel for several years, and  
successfully sued organizers for negligence. 
</P>
<P>
	The Canadian has never won a World Cup race or a world  
championship or Olympic title. The 32-year-old's best World Cup 
performance was second place in a downhill in Germany two years 
ago.

<HEADLINE> Why Do We Discourage Saving? / Commentary  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
                        *AP Business Analyst    	
</P>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- There is irony of a monumental sort in  
government proposing to help Americans save for their retirement. 
If only government would let them, Americans might do it 
themselves. 
</P>
<P>
	This has been pointed out so many times it is almost impossible  
to count the number. And by many and varied sources -- concerned 
individuals, academics, institutions and even by the government's 
own studies. 
</P>
<P>
	Allow people to save. Provide incentives to do so. Let people  
protect their savings from taxes. Discourage wasteful spending. Cut 
government deficits and lower its interest expenses and other 
costs. 
</P>
<P>
	Then, perhaps, America's households might catch on to the idea  
that, even with a small amount of money, an average rate of return 
and a period of time for the economy to do its work, they could 
have real wealth. 
</P>
<P>
	Steve Moore of the Cato Institute and Tom Kelly of the Savers  
and Investors Foundation, provide a simple illustration of how this 
mixture can produce stunning results that every household can 
appreciate. 
</P>
<P>
	Moore puts it simply: If your grandparents had scraped together  
$100 in 1926 and the money was allowed to grow at the stock 
market's average rate of return, you would now have access to a 
fund worth $266,139. 
</P>
<P>
	Or consider this scenario: If your parents placed $1,000 in a  
mutual fund in 1950, they would now have $217,630, based again on 
the average long-term rate of return in stocks. 
</P>
<P>
	Fortunes have been built by low-wage earners saving regularly  
during their work years. You hear about them once or twice a year, 
and inevitably the stories are discussed in tones of amazement. 
</P>
<P>
	Why amazement? The growth of the American economy is capable of  
doing amazing things routinely. What's amazing is how casually and 
almost totally the reality is all but ignored by government, 
parents and kids. 
</P>
<P>
	Savings receive only token recognition from Washington, mainly  
in the form of Individual Retirement Accounts, 401(k)s and the 
like, but the amounts in any such plans are rigidly limited. 
Otherwise, they are taxed. 
</P>
<P>
	And to a great extent, savings receive only token recognition  
from families. Why save, they ask, if government is going to 
penalize us for doing so? Let us live for the moment; let us spend 
and enjoy instead. 
</P>
<P>
	That habit is written all over the statistics and the American  
way of life. Late last year the savings rate fell below zero, 
meaning Americans were spending all their take-home pay and 
borrowing to spend more. 
</P>
<P>
	What do you expect? Economists tell consumers that their  
spending keeps the economy afloat. Retailers provide almost 
irresistible lures, such as no payments for six months. Lenders 
shovel money at borrowers. 
</P>
<P>
	Much of the borrowed money comes right out of home equity, but  
why worry when that equity is building so fast? Besides, owners 
rationalize, they need tax deductions and equity loan interest may 
be deductible. 
</P>
<P>
	Spending has many sponsors -- articulate sponsors trained in the  
arts of persuasion. Saving has few but dedicated sponsors; their 
funds are limited and their message is drowned by the roar of 
spending. 
</P>
<P>
	Americans once had a habit of thrift that was thought to be  
indelibly written on their character. Maybe it is, but it has been 
layered over by a message that says it pays to spend and it costs 
to save. 
</P>
<P>
	The terrible irony now is that the federal government,  
supposedly exasperated by the inability of Americans to save, 
proposes that it do it for them. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government -- with the most inept savings record of  
all!

<TEXT>
<P>
	HONOLULU (AP) -- A Continental Airlines flight from Tokyo to  
Honolulu hit severe turbulence Wednesday, injuring 18 passengers 
and four flight attendants. 
</P>
<P>
	One passenger was in serious condition with possible rib  
fractures, but everyone else received bumps, bruises and other 
minor injuries, said Sarah Anthony, an airline spokeswoman. 
</P>
<P>
	Flight 910 landed safely at the Honolulu airport about three  
hours after hitting turbulence at 33,000 feet, said Marilyn Kali of 
the state Transportation Department. 
</P>
<P>
	The plane was carrying 330 passengers, 15 flight attendants and  
three pilots, Ms. Anthony said. Most of the injured passengers were 
sitting in the back of the plane. 
</P>
<P>
	In December 1997, one woman was killed and 102 other passengers  
were injured when a United Airlines Tokyo-to-Honolulu flight hit 
turbulence and dropped about 100 feet over the Pacific. 
</P>
<P>
	Last September, passengers on China Airlines and Japan Airlines  
flights were injured by turbulence on their way to Honolulu.

<HEADLINE> Viewership Drops for Clinton Speech </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- An estimated 43.5 million viewers watched  
President Clinton deliver his State of the Union address Tuesday 
night on television, Nielsen Media Research said. 
</P>
<P>
	Despite the spectacle of Clinton speaking on the same day as his  
Senate impeachment trial, the numbers were down from 1998, when 
Nielsen said there were 51.3 million viewers. Clinton delivered his 
speech last year just after the Monica Lewinsky scandal broke. 
</P>
<P>
	But Tuesday's viewership level was consistent with several other  
Clinton State of the Union addresses. Between 1995 and 1997, the 
annual address drew either 41 or 42 million viewers. Clinton's peak 
came in 1993, when his first State of the Union speech had 66.9 
million people watching. 
</P>
<P>
	Nielsen's numbers, released Wednesday, estimate viewership on  
ABC, CBS, NBC, CNN, Fox and MSNBC. 
</P>
<P>
	Those six networks had a combined 48 audience share, meaning  
that more than half the people watching TV at that time were 
watching something else. 
</P>
<P>
	During the speech, NBC led the networks with a 9.5 rating, down  
14 percent from last year. ABC's 8.1 rating was down 35 percent 
from 1998 and CBS's 7.4 rating was a 9 percent drop.

	LOS ANGELES (AP) -- Entertainment industry giant Michael Ovitz  
has announced a $25 million donation to the University of 
California, Los Angeles. 
</P>
<P>
	Ovitz said he will donate the money toward a $1.3 billion plan

	As a model of the replacement hospital was unveiled Tuesday,  
Ovitz confessed that he was one credit shy of meeting graduation

	Ovitz said he hoped work on the hospital will either prevent the  
issue from being raised or count as extra credit, UCLA spokeswoman 
Roxanne Yamaguchi Moster said.

<HEADLINE> Clinton Appeals for Y2K Help </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Applause interrupted President Clinton nearly  
100 times during his State of the Union address -- but not after he 
sought help to make the Year 2000 computer problem ``the last 
headache of the 20th century.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton's unexpected reference to the so-called Y2K problem  
Tuesday night left the House chamber unusually quiet, a stark 
contrast to the 95 times he was interrupted by applause during 
other parts of his speech. 
</P>
<P>
	``We had one member of Congress stand up and applaud,'' Clinton  
said. ``Remember this is a big, big problem.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``I want all the folks at home listening to this to know that we  
need every state and local government, every business large and 
small, to work with us,'' Clinton said. 
</P>
<P>
	The federal government previously set a deadline to have all its  
computers fixed and tested by the end of March, just 10 weeks away. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also noted last month's announcement that the nation's  
600 million Social Security payments each year won't be affected by 
the Year 2000 problem. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Robert Bennett, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate's Special  
Year 2000 Committee, called Clinton's remarks ``appropriate,'' but 
chided the president for not taking a more active role earlier and 
for waiting so long into his 77-minute speech before broaching the 
subject. 
</P>
<P>
	``I would have thought (Clinton's remarks) would be appropriate  
a year ago,'' said Bennett. ``I'm delighted he's on board and 
spreading the word. I'm not sure anybody was listening by the time 
he got to that because the speech was very long.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Many computers originally programmed to recognize only the last  
two digits of a year won't work properly beginning Jan. 1, 2000, 
when machines will assume it is 1900. Some computers can be 
reprogrammed, but many devices have embedded microchips that must 
be physically replaced. 
</P>
<P>
	The Office of Management and Budget estimates the problem will  
cost the federal government $5.4 billion, although some private 
industry groups estimate it could run closer to $6 billion. The 
agency said last month that roughly 60 percent of the government's 
6,696 most important computers are compliant. 
</P>
<P>
	Clinton also proposed a 28 percent increase in federal spending  
on long-term computing research. 
</P>
<P>
	That closely tracks a recommendation made last August by the  
President's Information Technology Advisory Committee, which 
proposed increasing research investments by roughly $1 billion over 
the next five years. 
</P>
<P>
	The committee, whose members include some of the nation's  
leading high-tech scientists, warned that the United States is 
``gravely under-investing'' in the field.

cents, less than the bottled water on gas station shelves. 
</P>
<P>
	``In towns like ours throughout Oklahoma, either a brother, a  
sister, a mother, father, aunt, uncle -- somebody works in oil,'' 
said William Ricketts, the public works director in Pawhuska. ``If 
it goes much lower, everything will come to a standstill.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The same fear can be heard from Louisiana to Alaska. With oil  
prices at some of their lowest levels since the Depression, jobs 
are disappearing, businesses are folding and states have less money 
to spend on citizens who need more. 
</P>
<P>
	In Oklahoma, where the governor has called a special legislative  
session beginning today to consider $29 million in tax relief for 
the industry, spending on everything from welfare and Medicaid to 
prisons and roads may have to be cut. 
</P>
<P>
	``Instead of tightening our belt another notch, we may have to  
go another couple of notches,'' said state Sen. Kelly Haney, 
chairman of the Appropriations Committee. ``It's not going to be 
easy or comfortable, but we really don't have any other choice.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gas that sells for 70 to 80 cents a gallon in Oklahoma is a  
blessing for drivers but a curse for independent oil producers like 
Dean Eyler. He has laid off all six of his employees, shut down 15 
wells and is beginning to sell assets to stay afloat. 
</P>
<P>
	Like others here in Pawhuska, 50 miles northwest of Tulsa, he's  
not sure anyone out there cares. 
</P>
<P>
	``I feel like we have subsidized the rest of the economy,'' he  
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Across the state, the pump jacks that usually bob up and down,  
drawing crude from the ground, sit idle, and producers fear an 
estimated 10,000 oil industry jobs in Oklahoma could be lost if 
prices don't pick up. 
</P>
<P>
	Alaska, which loses $95 million for every $1 drop in the price  
of oil per barrel, had to draw nearly $1 billion from cash reserves 
this year to balance its budget. The gap is expected to widen in 
the next few years. 
</P>
<P>
	Gov. Tony Knowles was expected today to propose an income tax --  
something Alaska hasn't had since 1980, when the oil money started 
pouring in -- and dip into the Alaska Permanent Fund, the $24 
billion oil royalty savings account that pays a yearly dividend to 
every state resident. 
</P>
<P>
	Louisiana faces a possible budget deficit of $15 million to $60  
million, though most of the problem is tied to a college tuition 
program that is more costly than expected. Gov. Mike Foster has 
responded with a six-month freeze on hiring and purchases. 
</P>
<P>
	Texas, the biggest oil state, has remained financially strong  
despite the price drop. The state is projecting big surpluses 
during the next two years, and Gov. George W. Bush wants to reduce 
taxes by $2.7 billion. 
</P>
<P>
	After oil prices took a similar drop in the 1980s, Texas and  
other oil-producing states diversified their economies to become 
less dependent on oil. In Oklahoma, for example, oil taxes made up 
20 percent of the revenue in 1982. Now they account for less than 1 
percent. 
</P>
<P>
	Even so, state officials and oil producers say damage is being  
done. 
</P>
<P>
	Largely because of a glut of foreign oil, Oklahoma oil prices  
crashed to $8 a barrel in December and stood at $9.75 as of Friday. 
When the state budget was drawn up last spring, it assumed an 
average price of $17.02 a barrel. 
</P>
<P>
	E.W. Carter, an Oklahoma oilman since the 1960s, said this  
downturn is ``100 times worse'' than the bust of the 1980s. Even 
giants like Phillips Petroleum haven't been spared. The company 
just announced 900 layoffs in Bartlesville. 
</P>
<P>
	In nearby Hominy, Joyce Whitewing points out a restaurant, an  
antiques store, a variety store and an oil equipment supplier that 
have closed in the past year. Some restaurants in Pawhuska stopped 
serving dinner because no one shows up. 
</P>
<P>
	``I think everybody has been slow in responding,'' said Mrs.  
Whitewing, executive vice president of the Osage Producers 
Association. ``This is a crisis.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Eyler, meanwhile, hopes the worldwide oil glut will pass.  
</P>
<P>
	``We're just almost down to a week-by-week basis,'' said Eyler,  
who wears overalls stained by work he and his son now do alone. 
``We're hanging on for a little higher prices.''

<HEADLINE> China Promises Stable Yuan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BEIJING (AP) -- Despite the economic slump in Asia and financial  
jitters in Brazil, China's central bank chief has pledged to keep 
the country's currency strong in 1999, state-run media reported 
Wednesday. 
</P>
<P>
	People's Bank of China Governor Dai Xianglong told a group of  
banking officials the government would continue to crack down on 
illegal foreign exchange transactions to protect foreign exchange 
reserves, the China Daily and other newspapers reported. 
</P>
<P>
	The Chinese government last year held to a pledge to keep the  
yuan steady as currency markets around the region convulsed. 
Speculation that China may devalue the yuan strengthened demand for 
U.S. dollars in China and led to a leveling off of official foreign 
exchange reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the yuan trades at an official rate of 8.28 to the U.S.  
dollar, those buying on the black market pay at least 10 percent 
more. 
</P>
<P>
	To shield the yuan, Beijing has sought to restrict outflows of  
foreign exchange and illegal currency trading. At the end of 1998, 
official reserves topped $145 billion, second in the world only to 
Japan. 
</P>
<P>
	Dai's statement on currency stability follows Brazil's decision  
to devalue the real. 
</P>
<P>
	At the national financial conference, which opened Tuesday, Dai  
also outlined steps to reduce bad loan levels at state-owned 
commercial banks, estimated at more than one-fifth of all lending. 
</P>
<P>
	China's four state commercial banks are to set up asset  
management companies to assume and then try to recover bad debts. 
</P>
<P>
	To boost domestic spending and fuel economic growth, Dai  
encouraged ``qualified'' banks to expand loans for housing and 
automobile purchases, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Report: Jazz Give Malone Big Deal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	SALT LAKE CITY (AP) -- Karl Malone hasn't shown his face in Utah  
since the NBA lockout ended, although he may have already agreed to 
a contract extension that would keep him with the Jazz through the 
next decade. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Post, citing unnamed sources, reported Wednesday  
that Malone will sign a four-year extension with an option year 
that would pay him an average of $16.5 million per season. 
</P>
<P>
	The potential deal represents the maximum the Jazz can offer  
their franchise player under the new collective bargaining 
agreement. Malone, who has never been an unrestricted free agent, 
is in the final year of a four-year, $20.2 million contract. 
</P>
<P>
	Jazz executives are unable to comment on potential player deals  
until Thursday, when the NBA lockout is officially lifted. 
</P>
<P>
	Malone's agent, Dwight Manley, was en route to Salt Lake on  
Wednesday. For nearly two months, there have been scattered reports 
of a handshake deal between Malone and Jazz owner Larry Miller, 
though Manley has always denied any agreement had been reached. 
</P>
<P>
	``Karl is a very important person to this franchise, and I've  
always tried to do whatever we could to accommodate him,'' Miller 
said last week. ``I want him back (in Utah), and I expect he will 
be back.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Malone is the only one of 10 Jazz players under contract who  
hasn't attended the team's workouts the last two weeks. 
</P>
<P>
	If Malone and Miller have a deal in place, it would be another  
twist in Malone's strange odyssey since the Jazz lost in the NBA 
Finals for their second straight year to the Chicago Bulls. 
</P>
<P>
	While the lockout dragged on, Malone took up professional  
wrestling and started a sports talk show. On Nov. 11, he said he 
would demand a trade when the lockout ended. 
</P>
<P>
	Though he retracted the comment days later, the father-son  
relationship between Malone and Miller appeared strained. But Jazz 
executives remained confident that the Mailman, who has never 
played for another team, would be back for the final year of his 
contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``We've had too many great years with Karl Malone. That type of  
commitment is something you don't take lightly and you don't 
forget,'' Jazz general manager Tim Howells said earlier this month. 
``We want Karl back. We want Karl to finish his career here.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Though many Utah fans felt Malone turned his back on them during  
the offseason, their love for the Jazz hasn't dimmed. The team sold 
or gave away every ticket to its single exhibition game and an 
intrasquad scrimmage hours after they became available this week.

<TEXT>
<P>
	``Even if you believe that the president crossed the line in his  
Jones' deposition, you cannot conclude that he should be removed 
for it. He was not impeached for it. This case is about the grand 
jury and the grand jury alone.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Now, in fact, the vagueness and uncertainty as to the specific  
allegations of perjury, whether in the grand jury or in the Paula 
Jones' deposition, have created enormous confusion in the public 
about the president's conduct and about his testimony.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Keep an open mind and look at the real record. Read the  
transcript. Watch the videotape. Do not rely upon anyone else's 
version. We speak from some disappointing experience on this issue. 
Over and over again, inaccurate descriptions of the president's 
grand jury testimony have been launched into the public debate -- 
sometimes innocently, sometimes negligently, but the result has 
been the same.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The president's critics have created a conventional wisdom  
about the president's grand jury that is based on myth, not 
reality. There has been a merging of the president's testimony in 
the Jones deposition with that of his testimony in the grand jury. 
And this dynamic has been unfair to the president.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of the Senate, those descriptions of the president's  
grand jury testimony are absolutely false. When he appeared before 
the grand jury, the president admitted, he did not deny, an 
inappropriate, intimate, wrongful personal relationship with Miss 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	``When he made this admission, there was no doubt in anyone's  
mind what he meant.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``The lawyers for the Office of the Independent Counsel asked  
many questions and engaged in extensive colloquy with the president 
about being alone with Ms. Lewinsky. But they never asked him to 
explain, affirm, defend or justify his testimony about that same 
topic in the Jones deposition. And he did not do so. 
</P>
<P>
	``Members of the Senate, if justice is to be done, these  
misstatements and mischaracterizations must not be allowed to stand 
and must not be allowed to influence your judgment as you look at 
the evidence. So please look at the real record. 
</P>
<P>
	``It is the record of the president's testimony, not the Jones  
deposition, his testimony before the grand jury, that should be the 
Senate's sole concern.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``To the extent that we have relied on overly legal or technical  
arguments to defend the president from his attackers, we apologize 
to him, to you, and to the American public. We do the president no 
earthly good if in the course of defending him, we offend both the 
judges, the jurors and the American public.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``When an individual, any individual, is accused of committing a  
crime, such as perjury, the prosecutors must be put to their full 
proof. Every element of the crime must be proven. And if a criminal 
standard is going to be used here, it must be proven beyond a 
reasonable doubt.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``If he didn't obstruct justice or witness tamper or commit  
perjury, no one believes -- no one believes he should be removed 
from office. Allegations of legal crimes invite, indeed they call 
out, for legal defenses. 
</P>
<P>
	``And you will not be surprised to learn that in defending the  
president of the United States, we intend, and we will use, all the 
legal defenses that are available to us.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``In a perjury case, where the precise language of a question  
and answer are so relevant, this makes perjury prosecutions 
difficult because the prosecutor must establish that the witness 
understood the question, intended to give a false -- not simply an 
evasive answer -- and in fact, did so. 
</P>
<P>
	``The problem of establishing such intentional falsity is  
compounded in civil cases by the reality that lawyers routinely 
counsel their clients: Answer only the question asked, not to 
volunteer and not to help out an inarticulate questioner. 
</P>
<P>
	``Legalistic though some of these legal defenses may be, these  
are the respectable and respected, acceptable and expected defenses 
available to anyone charged with this kind of a crime. So, to 
accuse us of using legalisms to defend the president when he's 
being accused of perjury is only to accuse us of defending the 
president.'' -- Craig 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``What is most remarkable is the fact that the managers make  
many, many allegations of grand jury perjury that the independent 
counsel declined to make that were not included in the referral. 
Think about it for a moment. The lawyers working for the Office of 
the Independent Counsel, they were in charge of this investigation. 
They were the ones that called the president. They were the ones 
running the grand jury. It was their grand jury.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``Apparently, the managers believe that Ken Starr and his  
prosecutors have been simply too soft on the president. This should 
cause the members of the Senate some concern and some additional 
reason to give very careful scrutiny to these charges. 
</P>
<P>
	``When you do, you will find the following: The allegations are  
frequently trivial, almost always technical, often immaterial and 
always insubstantial. Certainly not a good or justifiable basis for 
removing any president from office.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``As you will see in these allegations in subpart one, it is the  
managers who resort to legalisms; who use convoluted definitions 
and word games to attack the president. It is the managers who 
employ technicalities and legal mumbo-jumbo; who distort the true 
meaning of words and phrases in an effort to convict the president. 
And we are the ones who must cry foul.'' -- Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``We are the ones who must point out what the managers are  
trying to do here. They seek to convict the president and remove 
him from office for perjury before a grand jury by transforming 
wholly innocent statements about immaterial issues into what are 
alleged to be perjurious, false and misleading testimony.'' -- 
Craig. 
</P>
<P>
	------	 
</P>
<P>
	``There is simply no way that a reasonable person can look at  
this testimony and conclude or agree with the managers that it is a 
quote 'direct lie.' What message do the managers send to America 
and to the rest of the world when they include these kinds of 
allegations as reasons to remove this president from office? 
</P>
<P>
	``It is hard to take the charges seriously when in each case  
they boil down to arguments over semantics. Does anyone here really 
believe that the members of the House of Representatives would have 
voted to approve these allegations as the basis for impeaching and 
removing this president, if they had been given the chance, with 
specific identified perjurious testimony in a proposed article of 
impeachment?'' -- Craig.

<HEADLINE> Sumitomo Trust Denies Merger Report </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	TOKYO (AP) -- Sumitomo Trust &AMP; Banking Co. denied Thursday a  
Japanese newspaper report that it and Daiwa Bank Ltd. have begun 
merger negotiations. 
</P>
<P>
	``There is absolutely no truth to the report. We are not in any  
way in such talks,'' Sumitomo Trust said in a statement. 
</P>
<P>
	Sumitomo is a top Japanese trust bank, while Daiwa is one of  
Japan's 10 largest city banks. 
</P>
<P>
	The Nihon Kogyo Shimbun, an industrial daily, reported Thursday  
that the two banks have started negotiations with a view to merge 
around April next year. 
</P>
<P>
	Also, the Tokyo Stock Exchange said it would suspend trading  
Thursday in Sumitomo Trust and Daiwa shares. 
</P>
<P>
	The merger report comes amid a major reconsolidation of Japan's  
financial industry, especially the bad-loan plagued banking sector. 
</P>
<P>
	On Tuesday, two trust banks -- Chuo Trust and Banking Co. and  
Mitsui Trust and Banking Co. -- announced a tentative agreement to 
merge.

<HEADLINE> Miami Crimes Raise Tourism Concern </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	MIAMI (AP) -- With the Super Bowl less than two weeks away,  
tourism officials insist that two violent robberies -- one of them a 
fatal attack -- were random and not a sign of renewed assaults on 
visitors to Florida. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're at the height of the tourist season, with Super Bowl  
coming,'' Miami-Dade County Manager Merrett Stierheim said Tuesday. 
``Without question, this is a sensitive time for us.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Miami is the site of the Super Bowl on Jan. 31.  
</P>
<P>
	Benoit Lessard, 69, a retired truck driver from Quebec, was shot  
to death early Sunday by a gunman who may have followed him home 
from Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, police said. 
He was killed one day after wealthy Panamanian Lynn Motta was 
robbed and shot several times at a shopping mall. 
</P>
<P>
	Although officials said the victims' backgrounds had nothing to  
do with the attacks, the shootings have brought back memories of 
killings that panicked many vacationers to Florida in the early 
1990s. 
</P>
<P>
	The state's tourism industry took two years to recover after 10  
tourist-related slayings in 1992 and 1993. Six were committed in 
the Miami area. 
</P>
<P>
	In response, law officers created a police patrol at Miami  
International Airport and nearby car rental agencies, where much of 
the crime took place. They also posted new highway signs and 
created maps to keep tourists from venturing into dangerous areas. 
</P>
<P>
	Tourist robberies investigated by the Miami-Dade Police  
Department dropped 86 percent from 1992 to 1997. ``This is not the 
Miami we saw in 1993,'' Stierheim said. 
</P>
<P>
	No one has been arrested in the latest attacks.  
</P>
<P>
	``This doesn't fit the profile of a tourist target,'' said Nicki  
Grossman, president of the Greater Fort Lauderdale Convention &AMP; 
Visitors Bureau. ``If somebody had followed (Lessard) to a hotel 
and done this, it would be a different story.''

<HEADLINE> Hockey Medal Winners Need a Team </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOSTON (AP) -- Olympic gold medal hockey winners Tricia Dunn and  
Katie King are players without a home. 
</P>
<P>
	At rinks and gyms around the country, women hockey players  
hoping to compete for the U.S. team train five days a week 
following a regimen faxed to them -- their only link to a team 
without a training facility. 
</P>
<P>
	Dunn and King say they are fortunate to drive from their New  
Hampshire homes to a workout facility in Burlington, where they 
work with Boston Bruins trainers Mike Boyle and Walter Norton. But 
they would prefer to have some teammates with them. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's definitely frustrating,'' said King, of Salem, N.H. ``We  
don't want that much. We would like a place to skate with 19 other 
women -- even if we're based just around the same area -- maybe a 
place to live and some food.'' 
</P>
<P>
	So goes the dilemma of women hockey players, trying to find a  
home and a national team. 
</P>
<P>
	When they returned last winter from Nagano, Japan, as champions  
after playing in the first-ever women's hockey competition, King 
and Dunn didn't have high expectations. They wanted to play hockey 
and hoped for a place to skate. 
</P>
<P>
	Talk of a women's professional league never came to fruition.  
And unlike in Canada and Finland, there are no women's leagues for 
players in the United States after they leave college. 
</P>
<P>
	So Dunn and King, who recently co-wrote a book on hockey, ``Gold  
Medal Hockey for Women and Girls,'' were forced to join a men's 
league in Walpole to keep in shape. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's kind of a bummer for us who are out of school to play in  
a men's league to train,'' said Dunn, a Derry, N.H. resident. 
``It's a little discouraging, but we have to continue to go through 
the process until USA Hockey comes up with a team,'' referring to 
the organization that oversees the women's national team. 
</P>
<P>
	For now, the national team members, which vary depending on the  
tournament, practice together only a few times a year. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the Three Nations Cup last month in Finland, for example,  
players practiced together for the first time when they arrived for 
the tournament. 
</P>
<P>
	And the national team will get together just two weeks before  
the World Championship in Finland in March. 
</P>
<P>
	Ben Smith, head coach of the national and Olympic women's teams,  
doesn't think the situation will change soon. 
</P>
<P>
	``One of the things that's a reality is there's not an economic  
demand for women hockey players once they've concluded their 
collegiate careers,'' Smith said. 
</P>
<P>
	Smith cited several reasons for the lack of a high-level league,  
including the lack of players to choose from. Canada, for example, 
has about 50,000 players to feed its women's hockey league -- 
compared to about 25,000 in the United States. 
</P>
<P>
	And, as far as Smith is concerned, a gradual process is not all  
bad. 
</P>
<P>
	``I sometimes think organization is the ruination of the  
sports,'' Smith said. ``I think the people who want to play should 
play, and that was the beauty of our players. There was no question 
about their desire to play ice hockey. The challenge and love was 
so great that it made the challenge worthwhile.''

<HEADLINE> Rebels Suspend Colombia Peace Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	BOGOTA, Colombia (AP) -- Thrusting incipient peace talks into  
confusion, Colombia's most powerful rebel group says it is 
suspending the negotiations until the government proves itself 
serious about dismantling right-wing paramilitary death squads. 
</P>
<P>
	``We are demanding that you, the government, take efficient  
action to stop the murder of defenseless people,'' the seven-man 
ruling junta of the leftist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, 
or FARC, said Tuesday in a communique read to reporters in the 
southern town of San Vicente del Caguan. 
</P>
<P>
	The startling announcement, less than two weeks after President  
Andres Pastrana's government and the FARC inaugurated the talks, 
was ostensibly a reaction to a 72-hour killing spree by 
paramilitary gunmen that claimed the lives of more than 130 alleged 
rebel sympathizers. 
</P>
<P>
	It forced the postponement until next week of a meeting that had  
been planned for near San Vicente today to discuss the FARC's 
proposal to swap 452 jailed rebels for more than 350 captive 
soldiers and police. 
</P>
<P>
	Both sides said they also intended to hold separate  
negotiations, as planned, on Sunday and Monday in the 
rebel-controlled region. Pastrana formally initiated the peace 
dialogue in San Vicente on Jan. 7. 
</P>
<P>
	Raul Reyes, the FARC junta member who read the communique to  
reporters, said the fate of further talks would depend on 
government efforts to get rid of paramilitary groups, whose latest 
killing spree coincided with the talks' commencement. 
</P>
<P>
	He alleged that the military -- which the U.S. government and  
human rights groups have accused of tacitly and sometimes actively 
backing the private, landowner-backed militias -- had a hand in the 
massacres. 
</P>
<P>
	``We Colombians are drowning in blood from the slaughter of the  
unarmed civilian population by paramilitaries in coordination with 
the military,'' Reyes said. 
</P>
<P>
	The armed forces has denied any complicity in the killings and  
Pastrana this week announced the creation of a special military 
unit he said would pursue the private militias, which arose nearly 
two decades ago in response to rebel kidnapping and extortion. 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana's peace commissioner, Victor G. Ricardo, said Tuesday  
night that the government was committed to combating paramilitary 
groups and that the issue was independent of its talks with the 
FARC on ending Colombia's 34-year-old civil conflict. 
</P>
<P>
	The rebels' Tuesday announcement proved they don't agree with  
Ricardo. But it did not necessarily indicate they intend to break 
off talks, many analysts agreed. 
</P>
<P>
	``The FARC is not going to get up from the (negotiating)  
table,'' predicted Alfredo Rangel, a former national security 
advisor. ``It is merely underlining the importance it is giving to 
eliminating paramilitarism, something it has always demanded.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pastrana's government, by offering this week to eventually enter  
into separate peace talks with paramilitary leaders, proved ``it 
doesn't know the FARC, which is absolutely consistent and 
impressively rigid in its position,'' said National University 
political science professor Alejo Vargas. 
</P>
<P>
	Illustrating its security concerns, the FARC insisted as a  
condition for the negotiations that the government pull its troops 
from a swath of southern Colombia the size of Switzerland. 
</P>
<P>
	Critics of the FARC have accused it of taking advantage of the  
government withdrawal to strengthen its political and military 
positions. 
</P>
<P>
	But FARC commanders are quick to note that more than 3,000  
former FARC militants who demobilized in the 1980s and formed a 
political party, the Patriotic Union, were systematically 
slaughtered by death squads. 
</P>
<P>
	The party no longer exists.

<HEADLINE> Gotti Says Feds Are Out for Blood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. (AP) -- Prosecutors want John A. ``Junior''  
Gotti to stand trial twice. 
</P>
<P>
	``They want to get as much blood as they can possibly get,''  
Gotti said Tuesday after the plan was presented in federal court. 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutor Carol Sipperly, in a letter to Judge Barrington  
Parker, sought two trials for Gotti, who is the only one of six 
defendants charged in two alleged sets of crimes. 
</P>
<P>
	Three defendants are accused only with an alleged scheme to sell  
worthless phone cards. Two are charged only with what Ms. Sipperly 
called ``more traditional Cosa Nostra crimes such as extortion, 
loansharking, robbery, financial fraud, construction-related 
racketeering and gambling.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti is the only link in the cases, Ms. Sipperly said. With a  
single trial, defendants would have to sit through weeks of 
testimony irrelevant to their cases. 
</P>
<P>
	Judge Parker, who has been trying to streamline the case, said  
the idea seems to have some merit. 
</P>
<P>
	But Gotti's lawyers called the idea ``a burden.''  
</P>
<P>
	``The states are always high,'' defense attorney Bruce Cutler  
said. ``To go through high stakes twice is always difficult.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The judge gave the defense two days to file written arguments.  
</P>
<P>
	Another Gotti lawyer, Sarita Kedia, said she would suggest to  
the judge a slightly different plan, in which the three phone card 
defendants would be tried separately but Gotti would face phone 
card charges along with the other charges against him. 
</P>
<P>
	Gotti, son of imprisoned mafia don John J. Gotti, could be  
sentenced to up to 20 years in prison if convicted. His trial -- or 
his first trial -- is expected to start in March or April.

<HEADLINE> Perkins Gets ABC Morning Show Gig </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- Tony Perkins, anchor of a Fox's local morning  
show in Washington, D.C., was chosen Wednesday to replace Spencer 
Christian as weather forecaster on ABC's ``Good Morning America.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins has been co-anchor of the ``Fox Morning News'' on  
Washington's WTTG-TV since 1997. He was the weather forecaster for 
that program before he took over as host. 
</P>
<P>
	Perkins, who also worked in radio and as a comedian, will  
deliver forecasts every 30 minutes on ABC's morning program. Like 
Christian did, he will frequently travel across the country to 
showcase special events. 
</P>
<P>
	Christian left ABC last month for a local weather forecasting  
job in San Francisco. 
</P>
<P>
	Earlier this week, ABC News appointed Antonio Mora as full-time  
newscaster on ``Good Morning America.'' Charles Gibson and Diane 
Sawyer took over this week as temporary co-hosts as ABC tries to 
turn the struggling show around.

<HEADLINE> White House Attacks Perjury Charge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Rebutting the charge that President Clinton  
lied under oath, a White House lawyer today accused House 
Republicans of drawing conclusions from evidence that were more 
extreme than those of prosecutor Kenneth Starr. He urged senators 
to read the grand jury testimony and ``see the president is 
truthful.'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House special counsel Gregory Craig opened a second day of  
defense arguments by denouncing the impeachment article accusing 
Clinton of perjury before a grand jury as ``really bad .... 
legally, structurally and constitutionally.'' He said House 
prosecutors had wrongly tried to criminalize ``utterly 
meaningless'' conflicts in testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig reminded senators that Clinton admitted to an illicit  
affair with Monica Lewinsky in his grand jury testimony last fall, 
and he charged that the prosecutors had gone far beyond the 
evidence as well as conclusions made by Starr. 
</P>
<P>
	``What is most remarkable is the fact that that the managers  
made many, many allegations of grand jury perjury that the 
independent counsel declined to make,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig argued that House prosecutors had wrongly lumped charges  
together -- he denounced it as ``dubious prosecutorial practice'' -- 
and that the perjury article was so vague that it failed to 
identify any false statement Clinton made before the grand jury. 
</P>
<P>
	``The most frightening thing about article one, it alleges  
perjury generally but it does not allege a single perjurious 
statement,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig said Clinton's vindication could be found in the grand  
jury transcript, and he encouraged senators to read it carefully. 
</P>
<P>
	``You will see this president make painful, difficult  
admissions,'' he said. ``You will see that the president is 
truthful and after reading, seeing, hearing and studying the 
evidence for yourself ... we believe you will conclude that what 
the president did and said in the grand jury was not unlawful and 
that you must not remove him from office,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	The president was out of Washington today, lobbying for policies  
he introduced in his State of the Union speech Tuesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	Before the defense resumed its rebuttal, senators met privately  
in party caucuses. Republicans emerged sounding more certain they 
will seek to call at least some witnesses during the trial to 
resolve conflicts in testimony. 
</P>
<P>
	``This all doesn't need to go beyond mid-February, even with the  
deposition of witnesses,'' said John Czwartacki, the spokesman for 
Majority Leader Trent Lott. 
</P>
<P>
	The White House arguments at the trial a day earlier showed  
``there are conflicts in testimony that witnesses might resolve,'' 
Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said today. He speculated that most of 
those who might be called could be helpful to Clinton's case. ``I 
don't know why the White House is so panic-stricken about it,'' he 
said on NBC's ``Today.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., opposing the calling of any  
witnesses, noted that key figures in the case have been interviewed 
numerous times already. ``They said the same thing each time,'' he 
told NBC. ``Why are we going through this again?'' 
</P>
<P>
	White House Deputy Counsel Cheryl Mills was to follow Craig to  
argue against an obstruction-of-justice charge. She will maintain, 
for instance, that Clinton did not ask his secretary, Betty Currie, 
to retrieve presidential gifts from Ms. Lewinsky after they had 
been subpoenaed in December 1997 by the Mrs. Jones' lawyers. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig accused House prosecutors of trying ``to twist the scope''  
of the perjury case to include allegations that Clinton had wrongly 
denied under oath his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky in the Paula 
Jones case even though the House rejected that charge in December. 
</P>
<P>
	``The managers have sought to merge the Jones testimony with the  
grand jury testimony,'' Craig argued, reminding senators they 
weren't to try Clinton for originally denying his affair with Ms. 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig also assailed the prosecutors' assertion that Clinton had  
lied when he testified before the grand jury that ``I wasn't paying 
a great deal of attention'' during his earlier testimony in the 
Jones case and also believed at that time that he could give 
unhelpful but still truthful testimony about Ms. Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	The special counsel argued the president wasn't affirming the  
accuracy of his earlier testimony and was simply trying to describe 
his ``state of mind.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Prosecutors ``never asked him to explain, affirm, defend or  
justify his testimony about that same topic in the Jones 
deposition. And he did not do so. If justice is to be done, these 
misstatements and mischaracterizations must not be allowed to 
stand,'' Craig argued, his hands frequently chopping the air. 
</P>
<P>
	Craig showed video clips of testimony in the House last year by  
former federal prosecutors who argued the threshold for proving 
perjury was extremely high and that Clinton's case didn't meet the 
standard. 
</P>
<P>
	Tuesday's trial session had ended at midafternoon, providing a  
break before senators walked over to the House chamber to hear 
Clinton's State of the Union address. 
</P>
<P>
	``We deal with absurdities and contradictions around here every  
day,'' said Sen. John Kerry, D-Mass. 
</P>
<P>
	White House Counsel Charles Ruff, in his opening remarks to the  
Senate on Tuesday, offered a point-by-point rebuttal to the House 
prosecution's case. Clinton, he said, did not lie under oath and 
did not try to obstruct Mrs. Jones' case by trying to keep Ms. 
Lewinsky from testifying. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff accused the House team of ``prosecutorial ... fudge'' on  
key evidence, and declared, ``We will defend the president on the 
facts and on the law and on the constitutional principles that must 
guide your deliberations.''

<HEADLINE> CBS Rides 2 `60 Minutes' to Top / TV Ratings  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	NEW YORK (AP) -- CBS's reproduction of its ``60 Minutes''  
stopwatch is among several new things that are working for networks 
during television's second season. 
</P>
<P>
	The debut of ``60 Minutes II'' made it the second straight week  
that a new show was in the Nielsen Media Research top 10. The 
newsmagazine teamed with its more famous father to help CBS beat 
NBC for the week. 
</P>
<P>
	``60 Minutes II'' was the most-watched program last Wednesday  
night, drawing the highest ratings of any regularly scheduled CBS 
program in its time slot since 1993. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's drama ``Providence'' didn't quite match the ratings of its  
highly-rated premiere. But it still finished tied for 12th in the 
week's rankings and was the top-rated show on any network last 
Friday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new animated Fox comedy, ``The PJ's,'' isn't quite in that  
lofty company and was sharply criticized for its depiction of 
blacks this week by filmmaker Spike Lee. But Fox could be heartened 
that ``The PJ's'' drew more viewers than the show that immediately 
preceded it, ``King of the Hill'' on Tuesday's schedule. 
</P>
<P>
	The strong showings by some of January's new programs are a  
marked contrast to the fall season, when none of network TV's new 
shows established themselves as hits. 
</P>
<P>
	Season ratings leader CBS had a 10.4 rating and 17 share last  
week, Nielsen said Tuesday. NBC had a 9.1 rating and 15 share, ABC 
had a 7.6 rating and 12 share and Fox was at 6.9 and 11. 
</P>
<P>
	Among the developing networks, the WB had a 3.4 rating and 5  
share, nearly double UPN's 1.8 rating and 3 share. Pax TV had a 0.8 
rating and 1 share. 
</P>
<P>
	The original ``60 Minutes'' was the week's most popular  
entertainment or news show, benefiting from the big audience that 
watched the National Football League conference championship game 
immediately preceding it. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC had alarmingly low ratings for some of its comedies,  
including the once-strong ``Mad About You.'' ``Working'' snuck back 
onto the NBC schedule only to be the lowest-rated series entry 
among any show broadcast by NBC, CBS, ABC or Fox. 
</P>
<P>
	NBC's ``Nightly News'' won the evening news competition for the  
10th straight week. Its 9.2 rating and 17 share narrowly beat ABC's 
``World News Tonight,'' which had a 9.1 rating and 17 share. The 
``CBS Evening News'' had an 8.2 rating and 15 share. 
</P>
<P>
	A rating point represents 994,000 households, or 1 percent of  
the nation's estimated 99.4 million TV homes. Share is the 
percentage of in-use televisions tuned to a given show. 
</P>
<P>
	For the week of Jan. 11-17, the top 10 shows, their networks and  
ratings were: ``AFC Championship Post-Game Show,'' CBS, 19.6; ``60 
Minutes,'' CBS, 17.6; ``Friends,'' NBC, 15.6; ``ER,'' NBC, 14.8; 
``Frasier,'' NBC, 14.3; ``Jesse,'' NBC, 13.8; ``Touched By an 
Angel,'' CBS, 12.8; ``60 Minutes II,'' CBS, 12.3; ``Law and 
Order,'' NBC, 11.7; ``NYPD Blue,'' ABC, 11.7.

<HEADLINE> Microsoft Trial Discusses Contracts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- The government sought in court today to  
portray Microsoft Corp. as a jealous master who enforced fidelity 
with corporate contracts so restrictive they violated federal 
antitrust laws. 
</P>
<P>
	Turning to what legal experts consider some of the strongest  
evidence against Microsoft, the government asked an economist 
testifying for the company about alleged exclusionary agreements 
with the nation's computer makers and Internet providers. 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft limits, for example, how PC makers can alter the basic  
appearance of its dominant Windows operating system, such as by 
preventing them from hiding or removing easy access to some 
preinstalled software including Microsoft's Internet browser. 
</P>
<P>
	In an important concession, Richard Schmalensee of the  
Massachusetts Institute of Technology admitted that computer makers 
have no choice but to agree demands because there is effectively no 
alternative to Windows. 
</P>
<P>
	``In the short run, the answer is no,'' Schmalensee said.  
</P>
<P>
	Justice Department lawyer David Boies showed Schmalensee an  
angry e-mail to Microsoft from an executive at Hewlett-Packard Co., 
the world's second-largest computer company, complaining about such 
restrictions. 
</P>
<P>
	``If we had a choice of another supplier, based on your actions  
in this area, I assure you would not be our supplier of choice,'' 
wrote John Romano, a manager at Hewlett-Packard. He added that 
Microsoft's restrictions caused ``significant and costly problems'' 
for his company. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee called Romano ``clearly an angry person.'' But he  
said there were many examples of what he called ``channel 
conflict,'' where a manufacturer's legal actions make its 
distributors irate. 
</P>
<P>
	``It would be surprising ... if Microsoft reducing the freedom  
of action in some respects didn't cause them upset,'' Schmalensee 
testified. 
</P>
<P>
	As part of its antitrust case, the government alleges that  
Microsoft imposed restrictions as early as 1996 to discourage 
distribution of competing Internet software from rival Netscape 
Communications Corp. 
</P>
<P>
	Sworn statements from executives at several PC companies  
indicated they were reluctant to sell Netscape's browser if already 
forced to distribute Microsoft's. Both products let people view 
information on the Internet. 
</P>
<P>
	In some agreements with Internet providers, Microsoft offered  
its browser free -- despite spending millions of dollars on its 
design -- if they agreed to limit distribution of Netscape's 
software below thresholds, often to fewer than 15 percent of their 
customers. 
</P>
<P>
	Boies suggested Wednesday that Microsoft has spent $500 million  
to develop its Internet browser since 1994. Schmalensee said the 
estimate ``would not strike me as unreasonable.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Microsoft maintains that its agreements with computer makers and  
Internet companies are legal. It calls its distribution deals 
similar to those in other industries and says limits on PC makers 
ensure a ``common Windows experience'' even for customers using 
computers from different manufacturers. 
</P>
<P>
	Schmalensee called Microsoft's attempt to protect its design of  
Windows a ``plausible rationale'' for its restrictions on PC 
makers. 
</P>
<P>
	But Boies confronted Schmalensee with e-mail from a Microsoft  
employee, Bill Koszewski, about limited waivers the company had 
granted to some PC makers to offer specialized Internet accounts. 
</P>
<P>
	``We're headed down the slippery slope,'' he wrote to Microsoft  
executive Brad Chase in May 1998, just days before the Justice 
Department and a group of states filed their antitrust lawsuits. 
</P>
<P>
	Koszewski added that Microsoft's lawyers didn't approve of those  
waivers because ``changes like this undermine our whole case in 
defense of Windows experience.''

<HEADLINE> Lawmakers Offer Steel Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers from steel-producing states offered  
legislation today to help a struggling steel industry combat the 
rising tide of cheap steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came as thousands of steelworkers held a rally  
at the Capitol and planned a march to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``This surge of imports in steel has been devastating and  
unfair,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate 
Steel Caucus. The legislation ``will improve the posture of 
industry and improve the standing of the workers themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steel imports reached record levels in 1998 and has been blamed  
for at least 10,000 layoffs and bankruptcies at some domestic steel 
companies. U.S. steel producers and steelworkers say they cannot 
compete with foreign steel that they say is entering the nation at 
prices dramatically below production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can work for zero wages and they still can't compete  
against foreign steel at the prices they are coming in,'' said 
George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a thousand steelworkers blared horns and held signs  
urging policy makers to ``Stand Up for Steel'' outside the Capitol. 
Inside, the Senate prepared for another day of the impeachment 
trial against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the steel industry has many allies among Democrats and  
Republicans from steel-producing states, passing legislation would 
not be easy because Republicans from other states tend to oppose 
measures viewed as harming free trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation offered by Specter and Sen. Jay Rockefeller,  
D-W.Va., would lower standards for proving injury in trade 
disputes, making it easier for the industry to obtain quotas and 
broad tariffs against foreign steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also would set up an import permitting and  
monitoring program so that the industry could prove injury earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, proposed a separate measure to give  
the steel industry a share of any duties collected from foreign 
steel. Those levies now go to the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen steel producers and two unions already have filed trade  
complaints against Japan, Russia and Brazil, seeking the imposition 
of duties. A ruling is not expected by the summer, so the industry 
has pressed the Clinton administration to take more immediate 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton earlier this month offered $300 million in tax  
breaks for the steel industry, a gesture that many producers 
denounced because it would first require them to post losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, who heads the House steel caucus,  
said he hoped today's rally would put a ``human face'' on the 
crisis and persuade both Congress and Clinton to act.

which is what this is all about,'' Floyd said Wednesday after the 
lockout was officially settled. 
</P>
<P>
	Many on the team's roster this season will be wearing a Chicago  
uniform for a first time. All of them will be as unfamiliar with 
the rookie coach as he is with them. 
</P>
<P>
	The dismantling of the six-time champions should become official  
Thursday when teams are allowed to finally conduct business with 
trades and signings. Teams were allowed to talk with players for 
the first time Wednesday, and some of the Bulls took their 
preseason physicals. 
</P>
<P>
	Michael Jordan has retired and so has Dennis Rodman -- well,  
maybe. He says he's taking a year off. Scottie Pippen is headed to 
Houston after he signs with the Bulls and is then dealt to the 
Rockets. Steve Kerr is off to San Antonio, Luc Longley to Phoenix 
and Jud Buechler to Detroit. 
</P>
<P>
	Buechler, a reserve on three straight title teams, will sign a  
two-year, $1.7 million deal with the Pistons, his agent Mark 
Bartelstein said Wednesday night. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's been a weird, weird feeling,'' guard Randy Brown, one of  
four Bulls already under contract, said Wednesday. ``We were just 
talking about it this morning. The team we had the last three years 
is no longer here. You don't want to think it's true, but obviously 
it's going to come to reality.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Toni Kukoc, Ron Harper and Keith Booth also have contracts, but  
now Harper, who turned 35 Wednesday, said it's time for him to get 
out of town as well. He said he wouldn't mind a trade. 
</P>
<P>
	``There's no real reason for me to stick around,'' Harper told  
the Chicago Tribune. ``If everybody else is gone, it might be 
better for me to pack my bags, too. Maybe I can go someplace 
warm.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Harper is scheduled to make $5.2 million this season in the  
final year of his contract. 
</P>
<P>
	``Ron's contract makes it difficult for him to be traded,'' his  
agent, Mark Termini, said Wednesday. ``He's prepared to go to camp 
Thursday. We anticipate him being a Bull.'' 
</P>
<P>
	The Bulls roster will be a mash of veterans, relative unknowns  
and a few familiar faces. Some will know the triangle offense that 
Floyd is expected to continue; others will be lost. Victories will 
be rare in a shortened season, where the purpose is apparently to 
prepare for next summer when the team goes free-agent hunting with 
salary cap room. 
</P>
<P>
	Brown played his first four seasons with the Sacramento Kings,  
who were chronic losers, but said this situation is entirely 
different. 
</P>
<P>
	``Sacramento was not used to winning. They were complacent.  
We're the Chicago Bulls, and everybody is being shipped out,'' he 
said. 
</P>
<P>
	Veteran center Bill Wennington said he expects to sign and stay  
with the Bulls, who will have just four practices and a scrimmage 
before their exhibition opener Sunday against the Indiana Pacers. 
</P>
<P>
	``It's about time, that's all I can say,'' Wennington said.  
``It's been difficult just lifting weights, working out and 
running. We're anxious just to get to practice, just to do 
something different. We've been in limbo.''

<HEADLINE> Pataki Setting Up Federal PAC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) -- Gov. George Pataki, with an eye on a  
possible run for president next year, announced Wednesday he has 
created political action committees to finance forays across the 
country. 
</P>
<P>
	The New York Republican said his travel plans were ``not about a  
specific person's candidacy at all,'' but reflected his desire to 
give the national party a kick in the pants. 
</P>
<P>
	``What I want to do is make sure the Republican Party refocuses  
on the policies that unite us with the American people and unite us 
as a party,'' Pataki said. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki's two PACs, one a federal entity and the other created in  
Virginia -- where campaign rules are more flexible about how 
candidates can use their money -- are both called the ``21st Century 
Freedom PAC.'' They also will make contributions to GOP candidates 
across the country. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki aides said the money raised by the PACs could not be used  
to finance a presidential run by the governor. Nonetheless, the 
activity could help set the stage for a national run by the 
53-year-old governor, who easily won a second term in November. 
</P>
<P>
	When asked about a possible run for the White House, all Pataki  
would say Wednesday was, ``What happens there, happens.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki has been highly critical of the party's national  
leadership for focusing on the Monica Lewinsky scandal. He has said 
it was up to the nation's Republican governors to show the way. 
</P>
<P>
	Pataki spokeswoman Zenia Mucha said the governor plans a series  
of speeches across the country stressing his fiscally conservative 
and socially moderate views.

<HEADLINE>  Lawmakers Offer Steel Legislation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- Lawmakers from steel-producing states offered  
legislation today to help a struggling steel industry combat the 
rising tide of cheap steel imports. 
</P>
<P>
	The announcement came as thousands of steelworkers held a rally  
at the Capitol and planned a march to the White House. 
</P>
<P>
	``This surge of imports in steel has been devastating and  
unfair,'' said Sen. Arlen Specter, R-Pa., chairman of the Senate 
Steel Caucus. The legislation ``will improve the posture of 
industry and improve the standing of the workers themselves.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Steel imports reached record levels in 1998 and has been blamed  
for at least 10,000 layoffs and bankruptcies at some domestic steel 
companies. U.S. steel producers and steelworkers say they cannot 
compete with foreign steel that they say is entering the nation at 
prices dramatically below production costs. 
</P>
<P>
	``We can work for zero wages and they still can't compete  
against foreign steel at the prices they are coming in,'' said 
George Becker, president of the United Steelworkers of America. 
</P>
<P>
	More than a thousand steelworkers blared horns and held signs  
urging policy makers to ``Stand Up for Steel'' outside the Capitol. 
Inside, the Senate prepared for another day of the impeachment 
trial against the president. 
</P>
<P>
	Although the steel industry has many allies among Democrats and  
Republicans from steel-producing states, passing legislation would 
not be easy because Republicans from other states tend to oppose 
measures viewed as harming free trade. 
</P>
<P>
	The legislation offered by Specter and Sen. Jay Rockefeller,  
D-W.Va., would lower standards for proving injury in trade 
disputes, making it easier for the industry to obtain quotas and 
broad tariffs against foreign steel. 
</P>
<P>
	The measure also would set up an import permitting and  
monitoring program so that the industry could prove injury earlier. 
</P>
<P>
	Sen. Mike DeWine, R-Ohio, proposed a separate measure to give  
the steel industry a share of any duties collected from foreign 
steel. Those levies now go to the Treasury. 
</P>
<P>
	A dozen steel producers and two unions already have filed trade  
complaints against Japan, Russia and Brazil, seeking the imposition 
of duties. A ruling is not expected by the summer, so the industry 
has pressed the Clinton administration to take more immediate 
action. 
</P>
<P>
	President Clinton earlier this month offered $300 million in tax  
breaks for the steel industry, a gesture that many producers 
denounced because it would first require them to post losses. 
</P>
<P>
	Rep. Ralph Regula, R-Ohio, who heads the House steel caucus,  
said he hoped today's rally would put a ``human face'' on the 
crisis and persuade both Congress and Clinton to act.

<HEADLINE> High Stock Prices Worry Greenspan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- While calling the economy's current  
performance ``outstanding,'' Federal Reserve Chairman Alan 
Greenspan expressed worries today that the high-flying stock market 
could be headed for a tumble that could spell serious trouble down 
the road. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan also criticized a key part of President Clinton's  
Social Security rescue plan, saying the government could damage the 
economy by investing huge sums of money in the stock market. 
</P>
<P>
	None of Greenspan's comments today suggested to analysts that  
the Fed would be changing interest rates any time soon. 
</P>
<P>
	But his expressions of concern about the altitude of the stock  
market gave support to views that the central bank is unlikely to 
rush to cut rates further unless global turmoil sends markets into 
a severe downturn such as occurred last fall. 
</P>
<P>
	At midday, the Dow Jones average was up 75 points.  
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan, an influential voice Congress often turns to on  
economic matters, said he supports Clinton's major idea to put 62 
percent of the government's budget surpluses into Social Security's 
cash reserves. 
</P>
<P>
	But he expressed serious reservations about a part of Clinton's  
plan that would allow a government board to direct about a quarter 
of those savings into stock market investments. It is unlikely that 
these investments could be insulated from political considerations, 
he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Rather, Greenspan said it is more important to use budget  
surpluses to reduce the federal debt as a way of boosting the 
national savings rate. 
</P>
<P>
	The government's channeling trillions of dollars over the years  
into U.S. companies would eventually lower America's productivity 
rates, the key to rising standards of living, because of pressures 
to help less efficient industries rather than letting market forces 
decide what companies to fund, Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not believe that it is politically feasible to insulate  
such huge funds from government direction,'' Greenspan told the 
House Ways and Means Committee. ``I am fearful that we would use 
those assets in a way that would create a lower rate of return for 
social Security recipients and even greater concern it would create 
sub-optimal use of capital and a lower standard of living.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan's remarks today on the level of the stock market were  
his most extensive worrying aloud about whether prices had risen 
too high since his famous comments about ``irrational exuberance'' 
in December 1996, when the Dow Jones industrial average was nearly 
3,000 points lower than it is today. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan noted that stocks have been climbing into record  
territory this year and called this fact unusual, given that 
corporate profits, the underpinning of stock prices, have been 
weaker. 
</P>
<P>
	He said this weakness in profits raised the ``possibility that  
the recent performance of the equity markets will have difficulty 
in being sustained. The level of equity prices would appear to 
envision substantially greater growth of profits than has been 
experienced of late.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan said a tumble in stock prices could quickly over into  
the real economy through what economists call the ``wealth 
effect,'' the fact that consumers spend more when their net worth 
is rising and cut back when they face reversals. 
</P>
<P>
	It has been robust consumer spending that in large part has kept  
the U.S. economy steaming ahead in the face of the severe global 
turmoil that began in Asia in mid-1977. 
</P>
<P>
	``A decline in equity (stock) values, especially a severe one,  
could lead to a considerable weakening of consumer demand,'' 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Greenspan stressed today that the Fed's actions last year were  
not prompted by a desire to protect investors from a drop in stock 
prices, but rather to protect the overall economy from a downturn 
caused by a cut in consumer spending that could result from 
tumbling markets. 
</P>
<P>
	In fact, Greenspan said some slowing in the U.S. economy this  
year would be desirable, given the rapid pace of recent growth that 
has pushed the nation's unemployment rate to a three-decade low. 
</P>
<P>
	The global economic crisis threatened to flare anew last week  
when Brazil, the largest economy in Latin America, was forced to 
devalue its currency. ``So far, markets seem to have reacted 
reasonably well to the decisions by the Brazilian authorities to 
float their currency and redouble efforts at fiscal discipline,'' 
Greenspan said. 
</P>
<P>
	Most economists are looking for growth to slow markedly in 1999  
as the drag from foreign turmoil finally begins to bite. But the 
slowdown has yet to occur and for that reason, economists don't 
believe the Fed will move anytime soon to cut rates.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Denies Bribing for Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) -- Malaysia did not dole out gifts or  
offer bribes to win its bid to stage the 1998 Commonwealth Games, 
according to a top sports administrator. 
</P>
<P>
	Reacting angrily to accusations of bribery by an Australian  
official who failed to win the bid for Adelaide, the president of 
the Olympic Council of Malaysia, Tunku Imran Tuanku Ja'afar, said 
Kuala Lumpur's bid was clean. 
</P>
<P>
	``I do not see why the officials from Adelaide are saying these  
things now. It surely sounds like sour grapes,'' the official was 
quoted as saying in the Star newspaper Thursday. 
</P>
<P>
	The new allegations came as the Olympic Games corruption scandal  
unfolded, following claims that organizers of the successful Salt 
Lake City bid for the 2002 Winter Games used bribery to win votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Nearly seven years after the South Australian city was beaten by  
Kuala Lumpur for the right to stage the Commonwealth Games, former 
Adelaide Lord Mayor Steve Condous and former Sports Minister Kym 
Mayes said officials from three countries asked for incentives to 
win their votes. 
</P>
<P>
	Condous, who was the president of the Adelaide bid and is now a  
state government politician, said the requests were made by 
officials from Pakistan, Sri Lanka and an African country which he 
could no longer recall. 
</P>
<P>
	``They all asked for the same thing, they wanted us to set up  
one of their children at Adelaide University and pay for their five 
or six years' tuition there. I said: `I'm sorry, we don't do 
business like that.''' 
</P>
<P>
	At the final presentation of votes in Barcelona, Spain, Condous  
said Kuala Lumpur, the winning bidder for 1998, delivered gifts of 
gold watches to the delegates and gold pens for the delegates' 
spouses at a dinner dance. 
</P>
<P>
	``We did not give away gold watches and pens to the delegates  
and their wives,'' said Tunku Imran, who was a member of Malaysia's 
bid committee. ``The only thing we had extra was a dinner for the 
delegates, but this was only to further highlight our 
capabilities.''

	Condous said he did not make the requests public at the time  
because he didn't want to damage Australia's trading relations with 
the countries. 
</P>
<P>
	He also said each of the 63 visiting delegates at the time were  
given a cricket bat autographed by retired cricket superstar Sir 
Donald Bradman, who lives in Adelaide. He also said an African 
delegate had sought and was given spare car parts during the bid 
attempt.

<HEADLINE> Armored Car Robber Sentenced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	JACKSONVILLE, Fla. (AP) -- An armored car driver who stole a  
record $18.8 million and fled to Mexico was sentenced to 25 years 
in prison, even as he insisted he was trying to punish his employer 
and help the poor. 
</P>
<P>
	Philip Johnson, 35, pulled a gun on two Loomis, Fargo &AMP; Co.  
co-workers in 1997 and loaded a van floor-to-ceiling with bags of 
cash. He drove one of the guards to North Carolina, where he 
stashed most of the money in a mini-warehouse, and left the 
co-worker handcuffed to a tree. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson was arrested in Texas five months later after crossing  
back from Mexico by bus. A border agent who thought he sounded like 
a liar ran the name he gave through a computer and discovered it 
was an alias for Johnson. 
</P>
<P>
	He pleaded guilty to kidnapping, money laundering and  
interfering with interstate commerce with violence. 
</P>
<P>
	``I didn't want any more than 1 or 2 million for myself,''  
Johnson told U.S. District Judge Harvey Schlesinger at Wednesday's 
sentencing. 
</P>
<P>
	He said he planned to use 20 percent of the haul to help poor  
people in Central America and offer 80 percent of the money back to 
Loomis if it changed the way it treated its employees. 
</P>
<P>
	``Their employees are little more than slaves,'' Johnson said.  
``There are people risking their lives for $7 an hour.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson had complained of a life of disappointment before  
committing the robbery, and had plotted the crime for six years. 
Most of the money was later found in the mini-warehouse. 
</P>
<P>
	Previously, the nation's biggest armored car heist was $10.8  
million, taken in Rochester, N.Y., in 1990. 
</P>
<P>
	Johnson's attorney, Tom Cushman, said: ``He didn't take the  
money to have a good time. And I don't think he had a good time.''

<HEADLINE> N.C. St.'s Holt To Miss Senior Bowl </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- North Carolina State star wide receiver  
Torry Holt underwent arthroscopic surgery on his right knee 
Wednesday and will not play in the Senior Bowl this weekend. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt, the All-America player whose jersey was retired Saturday  
night during the Wolfpack's basketball game against North Carolina, 
tore his right medial meniscus during practice Tuesday for the 
Senior Bowl in Mobile, Ala. He was on the North team's roster. 
</P>
<P>
	N.C. State team physician Mike Fajgenbaum performed the  
procedure Wednesday, and Holt was expected to return to full 
activity within 10-14 days, said Annabelle Vaughan, director of 
sports information. 
</P>
<P>
	While Holt was invited to play in many postseason bowls, Vaughan  
said he chose to only play in the Senior Bowl. 
</P>
<P>
	Holt is expected to be a high pick in the NFL draft this year,  
and the injury should not hamper his prospects, Vaughan said. He 
will not miss the NFL combine or individual workouts that NFL 
officials use to rate potential players, she said.

<HEADLINE> Lawyers Praise Clinton Attorney </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	WASHINGTON (AP) -- White House counsel Charles Ruff's opening  
defense of President Clinton was praised by lawyers as low-key but 
compelling. 
</P>
<P>
	``I thought Mr. Ruff was extraordinarily effective in  
undermining and poking holes in the factual case presented by the 
House,'' New York lawyer Bruce Yannett said Tuesday after Ruff 
opened the president's defense in the Senate impeachment trial. 
</P>
<P>
	``He spoke forcefully but without histrionics and without  
raising his voice and without being theatrical,'' said Yannett, a 
former Iran-Contra prosecutor. He said Ruff also argued effectively 
against calling witnesses and in stressing the gravity of removing 
a president from office. 
</P>
<P>
	Defense lawyer Ira Reiner called Ruff's 2 1/2-hour presentation  
``superlative.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``It isn't that he soared to heights of eloquence,'' added  
Reiner, a former Los Angeles district attorney. ``It was just the 
power of words, particularly when he talked about what impeachment 
means.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Still, Reiner and others said Clinton's lawyers will have a hard  
time convincing enough senators not to call witnesses in the case. 
If all 45 Democratic senators voted next week to end the trial, 
they would need six Republicans to join them. 
</P>
<P>
	Calm and low-key through most of his 2 1/2-hour presentation, Ruff  
displayed some emotion in a closing that responded to House 
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde's invocation of war dead during the 
prosecution's presentation last week. 
</P>
<P>
	In a quivering voice, Ruff spoke of his father who fought in the  
Normandy invasion in World War II. ``He didn't fight -- no one 
fought -- for one side of this case or the other,'' he said. 
</P>
<P>
	Charles Geyh, director of the American Judicature Society's  
center for judicial independence, said Ruff ``sort of met the 
managers blow for blow.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``Until the closing it was every bit as methodical and  
non-charismatic as the House managers. It was a remarkable 
finish,'' said Geyh, an Indiana University law professor. 
</P>
<P>
	Joseph Di Genova, a Washington lawyer and former U.S. attorney,  
said Ruff's presentation ``was sober. He did the only thing he 
could do, which was parse and deconstruct'' the facts alleged by 
House prosecutors. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff spoke in almost professorial tones as he argued that  
Clinton was innocent of perjury and obstructing justice in trying 
to cover up his affair with former White House intern Monica 
Lewinsky. 
</P>
<P>
	He used detailed timelines to rebut House prosecutors'  
interpretation of facts. 
</P>
<P>
	For example, prosecutors had argued that efforts to get Ms.  
Lewinsky a job intensified on Dec. 11, 1997, the day a federal 
judge's ruling increased the liklihood that the intern might have 
to testify in the Paula Jones' sexual harassment suit. 
</P>
<P>
	Ruff retorted that Ms. Lewinsky's Dec. 11 meeting with  
presidential adviser Vernon Jordan about a job actually occurred 
before the judge's ruling at the end of the day, as did the phone 
calls Jordan made to potential employers on her behalf. 
</P>
<P>
	Countering charges that the president has based his defense on  
legal hair-splitting, Ruff argued that the impeachment charges 
passed by the House were too vague. ``This is not some mere 
technicality, it's the law,'' he said.

<HEADLINE> Williams Accepts Doak Walker Award </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
	DALLAS (AP) -- Ricky Williams said he would be happy wherever he  
plays pro football. His mother is more discriminating. 
</P>
<P>
	``I don't really care where I play, I just want to go and play  
football,'' the Heisman Trophy winner said Tuesday night before 
receiving his second Doak Walker Award as the nation's top college 
running back. ``I'm sure I'll have fun wherever I go, and I'll be 
on a decent team.'' 
</P>
<P>
	But Sandy Williams said she wants her son to be either the first  
player chosen in the April NFL draft, by Cleveland, or go to the 
Dallas Cowboys. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams' mother and Ricky's two sisters, Cassie, 21, and Nisey,  
20, who now live in Austin, visited the Cowboys' training facility 
on Tuesday, and she had a message for owner Jerry Jones. 
</P>
<P>
	``I wanted to leave a note: `Dear Jerry, please draft my son.  
Love, Sandy,''' Sandy Williams said with a laugh. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams received his Walker trophy at a banquet of the SMU  
Athletic Forum, which also gave former University of Kansas and 
Chicago Bears star halfback Gale Sayers a special award for retired 
athletes who contribute to their communities. 
</P>
<P>
	Sayers and other former greats chipped in their advice for  
Williams. 
</P>
<P>
	``Make sure that he's in training camp on time,'' Sayers said.  
``Pro football is a Grand Canyon above college football ... and 
he's a marked man coming in.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He's got what it takes,'' said former Dallas star Tony  
Dorsett, whose NCAA career rushing record was broken by Williams. 
``But you've got to be put in the right system, you've got to stay 
healthy.'' 
</P>
<P>
	``He'll have a long, productive career if he goes to a team with  
balance'' between running and throwing the ball, said former SMU 
and New England Patriots runner Craig James. 
</P>
<P>
	``If he goes to Philadelphia (which holds the second pick),  
defenses will play 8-man lines and stuff him,'' James warned. 
``He'll have a good career wherever he goes, but this is a guy who 
could be special.'' 
</P>
<P>
	Even before the draft, Williams will give baseball another shot.  
He signed a one-year contract with the Texas Rangers on Tuesday and 
will report to the team's spring-training camp in Florida next 
month. But he apparently has no illusions about becoming a football 
and baseball star like Bo Jackson. 
</P>
<P>
	``I have so far to go in baseball ... I'm just trying to keep  
getting better,'' said Williams, who played A-league ball last 
spring. 
</P>
<P>
	Williams said he was especially honored to win the Doak Walker  
Award again because he met Walker last year, striking up a 
friendship that crossed racial and generational lines. 
</P>
<P>
	But the Southern Methodist All-America and 1948 Heisman winner  
was paralyzed in a skiing accident and died last spring at 71. 
Williams, who wore 34 on his jersey as a Longhorns senior, honored 
Walker by wearing his number, 37, when Texas played Oklahoma at the 
Cotton Bowl -- ``the house that Doak built.''
