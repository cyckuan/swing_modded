	   UNCASVILLE, Connecticut (AP) _ Lennox Lewis huffed and puffed,
but he couldn't knock Zeljko Mavrovic down.
	   The WBC heavyweight champion, however, did beat the challenger
from Croatia in a unanimous decision Saturday night before about
4,000 fans in a tent at Mohegan Sun casino.
	   ``Lennox definitely was huffing and puffing by the third
round,'' his trainer, Emanuel Stewart, said. ``I can't explain why.
Lennox definitely trained hard for this fight.''
	   The 243-pound (110.2-kilo) Lewis, however, had enough stamina to
be in complete control over the last eight rounds when he landed
several solid right uppercuts and stiff left jabs, which were his
two most effective punches.
	   ``In the later rounds, 8, 9, 10 and 11, he caught me and I
couldn't come inside,'' the 214\-pound (97.1-kilo) Mavrovic said.
``I'm tired, and he punched me unlike anyone else in the world.''
	   It was the European champion's first defeat after 27 victories,
22 by knockout.
	   The victory moved Lewis, 34-1 with 27 knockouts, a step closer
to a unification bout with IBF-WBA champion Evander Holyfield.

Lopez wins NABO junior welterweight championship
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAKE TAHOE, Nevada (AP) _ Before a very partisan crowd, Tony
Lopez won the NABO junior welterweight championship when he stopped
Jaime Ocegueda in the third round at Caesars Tahoe.
	   The easy victory Saturday night gave Lopez, of Sacramento,
California, a 50-7-1 record. The former IBF and WBA lightweight
champion has 34 knockouts.
	   Ocegueda, of Artesia, California, fell to 20-3-4 with nine
knockouts.
	   Aggressive from the opening bell, Lopez won the first two
rounds. He sent Ocegueda to the canvas with an overhead right and
then again with a left hook before referee Mitch Halpern stopped
the fight 42 seconds into the third round.

Prairie View snaps 80-game losing streak
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) _ Prairie View A and M snapped its
NCAA-record, 80-game losing streak, while Nebraska extended the
nation's longest home winning streak to 45.
	   Prairie View won for the first time in nine years Saturday
night, stopping a 2-point conversion in the final minute for a
14-12 victory over Langston in Oklahoma City.
	   ``It was well overdue,'' said Prairie View coach Greg Johnson,
who left Langston two years ago to rebuild the Panthers program.
``There wasn't any doubt in my mind what we could do. We just had
to believe and come through in the stretch.''
	   The victory was the Panthers' first since Oct. 28, 1989, when
they defeated Mississippi Valley 21-12. The streak started the
following week with a 19-18 loss at Langston.
	   At Lincoln, Nebraska, DeAngelo Evans and Bobby Newcombe returned
from injuries and scored three touchdowns apiece as second-ranked
Nebraska routed No. 9 Washington 55-7.
	   ``This stings, this hurts,'' Washington quarterback Brock Huard
said ``You just want to crawl into a hole. You can't believe this
happened on national TV.''
	   Nebraska (4-0) hasn't lost at home since a 36-21 defeat to
Washington on Sept. 21, 1991. Evans and Newcombe made sure the
Huskies (2-1) didn't pull off another upset in Lincoln.
	   Evans, returning to the lineup for the first time since 1996,
scored on runs of 60, 14 and 19 yards and finished with 146 yards
on 13 carries in just over 2 1/2 quarters. He missed last season
with an abdominal muscle problem and sat out Nebraska's first three
games this year with a knee injury.
	   Newcombe, the flashy quarterback who missed the past two games
with a knee injury, scored on a 3-yard run and a pair of 2-yard
dashes.
	   The Cornhuskers, who have won or shared a national title three
of the past four years, extended the nation's longest winning
streak to 18 games and improved to 11-0 against Top 10 teams since
a loss to No. 1 Florida State in the 1994 Orange Bowl.
	   In other Top 25 games, it was No. 4 Tennessee 42, Houston 7; No.

No. 8 Florida 51, Kentucky 35; No. 10 Florida State 30, No. 18

Air Force 34.
 &UR; No. 4 Tennessee 42, Houston 7 &QC; 
	   At Knoxville, Tennessee, Tee Martin threw four touchdown passes
and Jamal Lewis rushed for 135 yards and scored twice.
	   The Volunteers (3-0) were sloppy a week after their big victory
over Florida. They drew 11 penalties and committed two turnovers,
but still beat the Cougars (0-4) in the first meeting between the
teams since 1965.
 &UR; No. 5 Kansas St. 62, NE Louisiana 7 &QC; 
	   At Manhattan, Kansas, Michael Bishop threw for 441 yards and
four touchdowns, including a school-record 97-yarder to Aaron
Lockett, as Kansas State won its 12th straight.
	   Bishop, who set a school record with 475 yards in total offense,
completed 23 of 40 passes and was 48 yards away from Chad May's
school record for passing yards in a game when he went to the bench
with 11 minutes remaining and Kansas State (4-0) leading 48-7.
 &UR; No. 6 LSU 53, Idaho 20 &QC; 
	   At Baton Rouge, Louisian, Kevin Faulk scored four touchdowns and
set a school record for all-purpose yardage as No. 6 LSU beat
Idaho.
	   Faulk increased his yardage total to 5,397, breaking the mark of
5,326 set by Dalton Hilliard in 1982-85. Faulk had 268 yards
against the Vandals _ 178 rushing, 50 receiving and 40 in returns.
LSU is 3-0.
 &UR; No. 8 Florida 51, Kentucky 35 &QC; 
	   At Gainesville, Florida, Doug Johnson threw for five touchdowns
and Nafis Karim caught three touchdown passes in less than three
minutes for Florida (3-1, 1-1 SEC).
	   Tim Couch broke Kentucky's record for career passing yards,
completing 40-of-61 for 406 yards and three TDs, including a
school-record 97-yarder to Craig Yeast. But two interceptions in
the final quarter killed any chance of the Wildcats (3-1, 0-1)
beating the Gators.
 &UR; No. 10 Florida St. 30, No. 18 Southern California 10
	   At Tallahassee, Florida, Chris Weinke threw for 228 yards and
two touchdowns in a game that featured periodic downpours caused by
Hurricane Georges.
	   The Seminoles (3-1) forced five turnovers and held Southern
California (3-1) to three completions for 23 yards passing.
 &UR; No. 11 Virginia 24, Duke 0 &QC; 
	   At Durham, North Carolina, Virginia's defense forced eight
turnovers and Aaron Brooks atoned for a poor passing day with a
57-yard scoring run.
	   Virginia (4-0, 3-0 ACC) is off to its best ACC start in three
years. Duke (2-2, 0-2) lost a record 20th straight league game and
was shut out for the first time in 55 games.
 &UR; No. 14 Wisconsin 38, Northwestern 7 &QC; 
	   At Madison, Wisconsin, Wisconsin (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) scored
touchdowns on a pass, a run, a blocked punt and a punt return.
 &UR; No. 17 Texas A and M 28, North Texas 9 &QC; 
	   At College Station, Texas, Chris Cole caught six passes for 174
yards and three touchdowns to push No. 17 Texas A and M (1-2) to
victory.
 &UR; No. 19 West Virginia 44, Tulsa 21 &QC; 
	   At Morgantown, West Virginia, Amos Zereoue rushed for 192 yards
and three touchdowns to lead West Virginia (2-1) over Tulsa (2-1).
 &UR; No. 20 Oregon 63, Stanford 28 &QC; 
	   At Eugene, Oregon, Reuben Droughns rushed for 214 yards and
three touchdowns and Akili Smith threw for four first-half scores
for Oregon (4-0, 1-0 Pac-10).
 &UR; No. 21 Virginia Tech 27, Pittsburgh 7 &QC; 
	   At Blacksburg, Virginia, Keion Carpenter had three
interceptions, including one he returned for a fourth-quarter
touchdown, and Virginia Tech (4-0, 2-0 Big East) won despite
playing much of the game without its top two quarterbacks.
 &UR; Arkansas 42, No. 22 Alabama 6 &QC; 
	   At Fayetteville, Arkansas, Clint Stoerner threw three touchdown
passes and Arkansas (3-0, 1-0 SEC) shut down Alabama (2-1, 1-1).
 &UR; No. 23 Notre Dame 31, Purdue 30 &QC; 
	   At South Bend, Indiana, Tony Driver made two key interceptions
in the closing minutes and Jim Sanson kicked a 17-yard field goal
with 57 seconds to put Notre Dame (2-1) over Purdue (2-2).
 &UR; TCU 35, No. 23 Air Force 34 &QC; 
	   At Fort Worth, Texas, LaDainian Tomlinson scored the second of
two touchdowns in a madcap fourth quarter as TCU (2-1) upset Air
Force (3-1).

Americans capture Grand Slam of Skating crowns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NORTH CHARLESTON, South Carolina (AP) _ Americans Michelle Kwan
and Todd Eldredge captured the Grand Slam of Skating titles
Saturday night, besting Russian competitors Maria Butyrskaya and
1998 Olympic gold medalist Ilia Kulik.
	   Kwan and Eldredge, both gold medalists in July's Goodwill Games,
led their divisions through all three Grand Slam segments at the
North Charleston Coliseum. The event is sanctioned by the
International Skating Union.
	   Kwan, who stepped out of a jump in her semifinal routine but
skated flawlessly in the finals, stayed in first place throughout.
Butyrskaya, who held the third spot after semifinals, skated
cleanly to advance to face Kwan in the championship round.
	   Seven international judges scored technique and presentation on
a scale of 1 to 6. Kwan received straight 5.8 scores for technique
and all 5.9s for presentation. Butyrskaya earned one 5.6, two 5.8s
and the rest 5.7s for technique. The judges gave her two 5.7s and
five 5.8s for presentation.
	   In the men's final, Eldredge and Kulik both skated cleanly, but
Eldredge received all 5.8s for techniques and 5.9s for
presentation, while Kulik's marks were mostly 5.7s, with two 5.6s
and one 5.8 for technique and two 5.7s and five 5.8s for
presentation.
	   Kulik was deducted one-tenth of a point in technique because his
program was less than 3 minutes, 30 seconds.
	   ``When we went out for the warmups, Ilia and I looked at each
other and said, `Do we really need to warm up,''' Eldredge said.
	   Kulik added: ``We had just skated. We were ready to skate and
yet tired.''
	   In head-to-head semifinal matchups, Eldredge advanced after
defeating Russian Evgeni Plushenko, who hit the ice twice during
his routine, despite having one-tenth deducted because his routine
was longer than four minutes. Kulik bested Browning.
	   The event allows Olympic-eligible and professional skaters to
compete for a dlrs 40,000 first-place prize. The eligible skaters
remain qualified for the Olympics and world championships.

Worried Hindus on Bali pray for for peace ahead of opposition

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Having been spared from deadly rioting
that rocked other parts of Muslim-dominated Indonesia this year,
Hindus on the tourist island of Bali are praying that violence
won't break out at a big opposition gathering planned there for
next month, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Thousands of supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter
of Indonesia's founding President Sukarno, are expected to attend
the congress of her faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party,
PDI, on Bali between Oct. 8 and 10. Many are coming from the
neighboring main island of Java, which was badly hit by riots in
May and subsequent unrest.
	   The Sunday Observer said Balinese Hindus fear that unrest could
erupt on their island and have prayed for peace at a series of
recent religious ceremonies.
	   ``The ceremonies do not only have to do with the PDI congress
but also for the whole of Indonesia,'' it quoted Ida Bagus Wijaya
Kusama, a Hindu leader, as saying.
	   Megawati and her supporters resent the government for not
officially recognizing her as the rightful leader of the party,
which has been wracked by political squabbling and violence for
years.
	   She maintains she was deposed illegally as head of the party in
1996, when dozens of her supporters were later killed or injured in
a clash with police and troops in the capital, Jakarta.
	   She accuses former President Suharto as being behind her ouster
by a rival faction.
	   Suharto resigned and ended 32 autocratic years in power after a
wave of protests and riots in May. About 1,200 died in the
violence.
	   The new government of President B.J. Habibie still refuses to
recognize Megawati as the true PDI chief. It maintains the party is
rightfully controlled by her rivals.
	   Authorities have said that they will not issue a permit for the
gathering to go ahead in Bali.
	   The so-called ``Island of the Gods'' is Indonesia's biggest
international tourist destination and a major source of foreign
exchange badly needed during its worst economic crisis in 30 years.
	   ``Bali, through tourism, is one of Indonesia's main sources of
income,'' said the Jakarta Post Saturday quoted Dunidja, a senior
Home Affairs Ministry official, as saying.
	   Dunidja said the government would help Megawati move the
congress to another location. However, her aides say she has
rejected the offer.
	   Police have said that the gathering will be deemed illegal if no
permit is issued and if Megawati tries to use the name, PDI.

South Korean civil group sends 104 milk cows to North Korea
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SEOUL, South Korea (AP) _ A South Korean civic group on Sunday
shipped 104 milk cows to hunger-stricken North Korea, government
officials said.
	   A 3,000-ton freighter leased from the Caribbean state of Saint
Vincent left Inchon port west of Seoul to arrive in the North's
Nampo port on Monday, said the officials at the Ministry of Marine
Affairs and Fisheries.
	   The cows were donated by a civic group named Iwutsaranghoi,
meaning an association for neighborly love.
	   Ministry officials said the civic group plans to send 96 more
milk cows and 23 tons of stock feed next month.
	   It was the second South Korean cattle donation to North Korea.
In June, Chung Ju-yung, founder and honorary chairman of the giant
Hyundai group, gave North Korea 500 cattle as a gift during his
visit to the North.
	   So far, South Korea has given North Korea dlrs 352 million worth
of free food since the communist country turned to the
international community to feed its 22 million people in 1995.
	   North Korea has suffered dire food shortages after three years
of disastrous weather that aggravated problems caused by
inefficient cooperative farming techniques.

Worried Hindus on Bali pray for peace ahead of opposition congress
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: DELETES extraneous word in overline &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Having been spared from deadly rioting
that rocked other parts of Muslim-dominated Indonesia this year,
Hindus on the tourist island of Bali are praying that violence
won't break out at a big opposition gathering planned there for
next month, a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Thousands of supporters of Megawati Sukarnoputri, the daughter
of Indonesia's founding President Sukarno, are expected to attend
the congress of her faction of the Indonesian Democratic Party,
PDI, on Bali between Oct. 8 and 10. Many are coming from the
neighboring main island of Java, which was badly hit by riots in
May and subsequent unrest.
	   The Sunday Observer said Balinese Hindus fear that unrest could
erupt on their island and have prayed for peace at a series of
recent religious ceremonies.
	   ``The ceremonies do not only have to do with the PDI congress
but also for the whole of Indonesia,'' it quoted Ida Bagus Wijaya
Kusama, a Hindu leader, as saying.
	   Megawati and her supporters resent the government for not
officially recognizing her as the rightful leader of the party,
which has been wracked by political squabbling and violence for
years.
	   She maintains she was deposed illegally as head of the party in
1996, when dozens of her supporters were later killed or injured in
a clash with police and troops in the capital, Jakarta.
	   She accuses former President Suharto as being behind her ouster

wave of protests and riots in May. About 1,200 died in the

	   The new government of President B.J. Habibie still refuses to

Howard appeals to voters in upcoming election
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ROHAN SULLIVAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard Sunday urged
voters not to throw out his government at Australia's Oct. 3
election, saying his government deserved another term in office.
	   With his ruling coalition trailing in the polls as the campaign
enters its last week, Howard stuck to his strategy of promoting the
government's economic management record and said he does not think
Australians want a change of government.
	   ``I don't sense that there is a mood to throw out the
government. In the 24 years I've been in politics I've sensed that
mood on three occasions, 1975, 1983 and 1996,'' Howard said in a
television interview.
	   ``However, you can still lose an election even though there's
not any profound mood to throw you out. It can still happen.''
	   Howard said the election was tight but the coalition had earned
a win.
	   ``We deserve to get reelected because we're better able to
manage the Australian economy in a sea of international economic
turbulence. But elections are unpredictable these days and I've
never taken this one for granted.''
	   Howard's ruling Liberal-National coalition trailed the
opposition Labor Party in opinion polls last week.
	   If those results are repeated on election day, Labor would win
the 27 electoral seats it needs for a majority in the House of
Representatives and to form government.
	   A Quadrant opinion poll reported in The Sunday Telegraph
newspaper showed the election result will be very close with Labor
and the coalition running level. It showed either major party might
need to rely on the support of independent members to gain a
majority in the 148-member House of Representatives.
	   Labor needs a 4 percent swing toward it in total votes to win
the seats it needs for a majority.
	   Howard has pinned his reelection hopes on his economic
management and a plan for a new 10 percent goods and services tax
and personal tax cuts of Australian dollars 13 billion (U.S. dlrs
7.5 billion) a year.
	   Labor is campaigning on promises to reduce unemployment and
retain government-owned utilities such as telecommunications giant
Telstra Corp., which Howard has said he will privatize.
	   Howard said the last week of the campaign will be especially
important because of the number of voters who appeared undecided.
	   ``There are fewer people who are rusted on to one or other
political party, therefore the last week is important,'' he said.

Official: Philippines has more than 137,000 unlicensed guns
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ There are more than 137,000
unlicensed guns in the Philippines and the weapons are a cause of
rampant crime the country, a senator said Sunday.
	   More than half of the estimated 137,645 unlicensed guns were in
southern Mindanao island, where Muslim separatist guerrillas and
other armed groups are active, said Sen. Loren Lagarda, citing a
police intelligence report.
	   ``We have more unlicensed guns in our neighborhoods than
policemen,'' she said.
	   Legarda, an anti-crime advocate, urged President Joseph Estrada
to launch a campaign to seize unlicensed guns, saying they would
continue to threaten peace and order.
	   Legarda said a separate report made recently by the National
Police showed that 90 percent of guns used in murders, bank
robberies and kidnappers, are unlicensed.
	   In metropolitan Manila, where bank robberies and ransom
kidnappings are widespread, there are 8,165 loose firearms, said
Legarda.
	   Despite a pledge by Estrada to combat them, organized crime is
still on rise. In Mindanao, government and police troops continue a
search for several recent kidnapping victims, including an Italian
missionary, the family of a Taiwanese businessman and three Hong
Kong nationals.
	   Early this month, armed men abducted the daughter of Agrarian
Reform Secretary Horacio Morales and freed her unharmed with a
warning they would harm his family if he continues to distribute
land to poor farmers.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australian rugby union coach Rod
Macqueen said Sunday his team is on track for next year's World Cup
after sweeping its Pacific Zone qualifiers.
	   But Macqueen, who warned the team needed to improve to catch
favorite South Africa, viewed the qualifying tournament as the most
important part of the year and were happy to have achieved their
goal of qualifying first.
	   Victories over Fiji (66-20), Tonga (74-0) and Saturday night
over Samoa (25-13) assured Australia would land in its preferred
pool in Ireland where it would probably play that country, the
United States and a European nation.
	   Australia finished its first domestic and southern hemisphere
campaign under Macqueen with a highly creditable record of nine
wins and two losses, with both defeats being inflicted by eventual
Tri Nations champion, South Africa.
	   Internationals away to England and France in November will
conclude a 13-test year, the heaviest in its history.
	   ``Obviously our goals are all around next year and I think the
team realizes we have to improve if we're going to be successful in
the World Cup,'' Macqueen said Sunday.
	   ``But having said that, I think there is definitely some
improvement that can come out of the side. It's been basically the
side's first year together, considering there were eight new
players at the start of the year.''
	   ``I think South Africa were clearly a better side than us this
year and we have to take that other step up.''
	   He said a 26-man squad for the tour of England and France would
be announced after next month's inaugural State of the Union
tournament between New South Wales, Queensland and the Australian
Capital Territory.

Seles beats Sanchez-Vicario for title third year in a row
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHIl BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Monica Seles beat Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario for the
Toyota Princess Cup title for the third consecutive year Sunday,
again using her firepower to overcome the Spaniard's speed and
wiles.
	   Seles' 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory in the 2-hour, 17-minute match left
Sanchez-Vicario with four straight losses in the Toyota finals
after she had won the tournament in 1994. She lost to Mary Pierce
in 1995.
	   Sanchez-Vicario came back from a 3-1 deficit to win the first
set, and threatened to rebound from 3-1 and 5-3 gaps in the third.
But at 30-all in the final game, Seles produced two good serves _
one drawing a miss from Sanchez-Vicario and the other setting up a
vicious forehand crosscourt winner.
	   Seles, seeded second here behind the French Open champion, saved
two break points in the second game _ which she closed out with two
aces _ and two more in the fourth on her way to winning the final
set.
	   Sanchez-Vicario, ranked No. 4 by the WTA, gained her key break
in the first set against No. 6 Seles in the seventh game, coming
back from 40-15. She gained her third deuce thanks to a reflex lob
off a Seles overhead, and then won on two misses by her opponent.
	   But Seles charged back, taking a 5-0 lead in the second set
before Sanchez-Vicario closed the gap to 5-3 by keeping serve twice
and breaking once. Seles finished that set by serving a love game.
	   She now has won 17 of their 20 meetings.
	   The two were to meet again later Sunday in the doubles final.
Seles was playing with 17-year-old Russian Anna Kournikova, and
Sanchez-Vicario with American Mary Joe Fernandez.

	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A major Thai film festival, at which
South Korean and Argentine entries took top prizes, has ended
amidst criticism of censors who banned three films, newspapers said
Sunday.
	   Using a 58-year-old statute, police forced withdrawal of the
films from the first annual Bangkok Film festival after deeming
they contained pornography or negative social or cultural messages.
	   Organizers and others defended the three banned films and
criticized the censors, saying they were destructive to the local
film industry and Thailand's international image.
	   One of the banned films, ``Bugis Street'' from Singapore, had
been shown in the island republic where censors are particularly
zealous. The others were ``My Teacher Eats Biscuits'' from Thailand
and ``Topless Women Talk About Their Lives,'' an entry from New
Zealand.
	   A South Korean film, ``A Petal,'' won the best Asian feature
award while ``Moebius,'' by Argentine director Gustavo Mosquera,
captured the best feature in the non-Asian category.
	   Directed by Jang Sunwoo, ``A Petal'' portrays how political
oppression can devastate society.
	   The nine-day festival, which attracted 20,000 viewers, ended
Saturday.

	   BRISBANE, Australia (AP) _ Thirty demonstrators waving
antinuclear banners Sunday marched on wharves where the
nuclear-powered submarine USS San Francisco is berthed during a
visit to Australia.
	   The demonstrators called on Prime Minister John Howard to end
visits by nuclear-capable warships, claiming the San Francisco was
capable of carrying up to 26 nuclear missiles, spokesman Drew
Hutton said.
	   ``By allowing such visits Australia is firmly linked to the
international nuclear industry,'' Hutton said.
	   ``These ships are part of a culture of death that has no
positive role to play in a sustainable future.''
	   The protest ended peacefully.

Drought-stricken Cyprus in frantic search for water
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LEFKARA, Cyprus (AP) _ The sign on a hill overlooking the nearly
empty reservoir behind Lefkara Dam warns: ``Swimming is
prohibited.''
	   That may be all that is funny about the severe water shortage
gripping this island at the eastern end of the Mediterranean.
	   Drought has parched Cyprus for three years, leaving vital
government reservoirs at just 6 percent of capacity and authorities
faced with the prospect of water running out by year's end without
substantial rains.
	   The shortage was exacerbated by record temperatures in July and
August. At one point, the mercury hit 110 degrees (43 degrees
Celsius), pushing water consumption even higher.
	   Some farms are already deserted for a lack of water, and
rain-fed reservoirs _ like the one behind the Lefkara Dam near the
southern port of Limassol _ have been reduced to muddy puddles.
	   A sense of emergency pervades the island, long a major resort
destination for European travelers, and authorities are scrambling
for quick-fixes.
	   Some of the ideas touted: importing fresh water from faraway
Canada, building more costly desalination plants, introducing even
more stringent water rationing.
	   More likely the shortfall will be made up by greatly expanding
the use of underground water, a prospect that environmentalists
warn could prove an ecological disaster.
	   ``Underground water has already been overtaxed,'' said Nicos
Georgiades, director of the Agriculture Ministry's environment
services.
	   Excessive use of the aquifers would lead to sea water seeping in
and mixing with scarce fresh water, he warned.
	   Cyprus has no more than half of the groundwater that it had in
1960, said Michael Peppis, a government hydrologist.
	   The shortage has already made for changing lifestyles.
	   Homes in Nicosia, the capital of 250,000 people, get water for
just 30 hours a week, the tightest ration ever.
	   Hotels in the seaside resorts are so short of water that they
now buy it from private companies to meet the needs of some of the
more than 2 million tourists who visit Cyprus every year. In
Larnaca, several hotels are paying nearly dlrs 6,000 a month for
extra water.
	   Irrigation water delivered to farmers has been cut 75 percent
more this year. Such cutbacks are blamed in part for the drop in
Cyprus' farm exports, such as citrus fruit and potatoes, which
earned dlrs 76 million last year, down nearly a third from 1996.
	   At present, wells tapping the island's aquifers supply at least
80 percent of Cyprus' water. The rest comes from reservoirs and a
desalination plant. The plant, which began operations last year,
produces 8.7 million gallons (33 million liters) of fresh water a
day _ about half the needs of the Nicosia, Larnaca and Famagusta
districts.
	   Another plant with the same capacity is under construction and
should begin operating by 2000. And the government announced
contracts in September for two more desalination plants that are to
begin operating in 1999 each with production of 3.3 million gallons
(12.5 million liters) daily.
	   Another proposal is to ship fresh water by sea from Canada,
although many Cypriots feel that would prove too expensive.
	   ``If we don't get any rain this winter, we shall take all
necessary measures to see us through,'' said Andreas Panayiotou of
the State Water Development Department.
	   Parliament recently voted to impose a dlrs 60 fine for anyone
caught wasting water. And the government is considering mandating
water-saving devices for homes, taking over private wells and
increasing water prices to encourage conservation.
	   Agriculture Minister Costas Themistocleous recently offered a
public apology for the water crisis. He said it was inappropriate
for an island as wealthy as Cyprus to be faced with a shortage of a
basic item that affects the economy and the quality of life.
	   Yet, in September, the government announced it was issuing
permits for construction of four water-hungry golf courses as part
of its campaign to increase tourism to 3 million visitors a year by
2003.
	   ``It is crazy,'' said Evi Theopemptou, an environmental
activist. ``There is no logic behind it.''

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ The Lisbon world's fair is coming to a
rueful end, with attention focused as much on waste and corruption
as on what the fair was supposed to show: Portugal's arrival on the
world stage.
	   Expo 98 was touted by its organizers as a symbol of a new
Portugal, yanked from decades of economic backwardness by
membership in the European Union.
	   They hoped the four-month, dlrs 2.4 billion fair would spotlight
the fast-paced modernization _ fueled by EU development aid _ of
the country of 9.8 million people on Europe's southwestern corner.
	   But with the exposition ringing to a close Wednesday, attendance
has been only half what was predicted.
	   And officials are uncovering corruption at high levels. A
land-sale scam resulted in the arrest of one of the fair's top
executives and the suspensions or resignations of others.
	   ``The whole thing was disgraceful,'' said Jose Sousa, a
41-year-old Lisbon banker with international connections. ``It made
us look like a country of second-rate con men.''
	   Auditors alleged millions of dollars were skimmed off the top of
real estate sales of land zoned for building after the fair ends.
	   Police are also investigating graft in the awarding of computer
contracts and in the leasing of three luxury cruise ships intended
to provide lodging during the fair. Hotels never filled up, and the
ships sat idle in Lisbon harbor.
	   The final admission total is now projected at around 8 million,
instead of the 15 million originally forecast to visit the 150-acre
(60-hectare) fairgrounds occupying a strip along Lisbon's eastern
riverfront.
	   Few of the 100-plus national pavilions _ prefabricated
structures that will be dismantled after the fair _ were
sophisticated enough to stir much interest, except as
air-conditioned havens from the heat and unrelieved glare of white
paving stones.
	   The biggest draws have been the multimillion-dollar theme
exhibits, such as the Oceans Pavilion featuring Europe's biggest
aquarium and the high-tech Pavilion of the Future.
	   Expo 98 has not been a wholesale disaster. At the least, it
prompted a vast modernization of the capital.
	   But the financial deficit, estimated at dlrs 400 million,
probably will have to be paid by the taxpayers, turning the fair
into a political liability for the governing Socialist Party in
next year's elections.
	   The opposition is already saying that in a country with a
minimum monthly wage of only about dlrs 320, the money could have
been better spent on such things as pensions, medical care and
education.
	   Antonio Mega Ferreira, an Expo 98 director, concedes the land
fraud scandal bruised the fair's image. But he remains upbeat.
	   He said in an interview that revenue from real estate sales and
sponsorship deals was almost twice what was projected and the
fair's deficit would not increase.
	   He insisted the number of admissions, while below expectations,
was not bad.
	   ``More than seven million visitors in four months is not exactly
chicken feed,'' Mega Ferreira said.
	   He disagrees with suggestions that world fairs _ launched more
than 100 years ago to showcase the latest technology for people
with little chance to travel _ are an anachronism in an age of
dazzling theme parks and international tourism.
	   World expositions are scheduled for Hanover, Germany, in 2000,
and in Manila, Philippines, in 2002.
	   ``World's fairs still have a market niche,'' Mega Ferreira said.
``They must offer cultural enrichment as well as the type of pure
entertainment that EuroDisney or the Epcot Center offer.''
	   He said Expo 98 attempted to convey its message _ the need to
preserve the oceans and topical issues like El Nino and global
warming _ by blending science with the high-tech thrills of virtual
reality.
	   For many restaurant and bar operators, the fair fizzled.
	   ``We're pretty disappointed, obviously,'' said California-born
Rob Murray at the expo's Tex Mex Saloon, owned by an American
company that has run restaurants at 14 world fairs since 1951.
	   ``I think Expo 98's marketing was weak,'' he said. ``It's too
expensive for most Portuguese and, well, I think it's just not a
very interesting fair.''

Japan condemns U.S. subcritical nuclear test
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the only
cities ever to suffer an atomic bombing, on Sunday condemned a U.S.
nuclear experiment to test the reliability of its nuclear
stockpile.
	   ``At a time when hopes are rising for the development of nuclear
disarmament, it is necessary to criticize the United States at the
international level,'' Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito said in a
statement.
	   The United States conducted its fourth subcritical nuclear test
on Saturday at its Nevada Test Site. In such tests, plutonium is
blasted with explosives too weak to set off the self-sustaining
nuclear reaction of an atomic explosion.
	   The United States says the tests are to obtain information on
plutonium samples at varying ages and do not violate the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
	   But anti-nuclear campaigners in Japan say that any kind of
nuclear test is likely to tempt other countries to develop atomic
weapons.
	   Hiroshima Mayor Takashi Hiraoka said in a statement that
America's subcritical test ``will inevitably cause a build-up in
the nuclear weapons race.''
	   ``The failure to faithfully accomplish nuclear disarmament as
dictated by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty led to nuclear
tests by India and Pakistan,'' Hiraoka said.

Prairie View snaps 80-game losing streak
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Colorado-Baylor game &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   OKLAHOMA CITY (AP) _ Prairie View A and M snapped its
NCAA-record, 80-game losing streak, while Nebraska extended the
nation's longest home winning streak to 45.
	   Prairie View won for the first time in nine years Saturday
night, stopping a 2-point conversion in the final minute for a
14-12 victory over Langston in Oklahoma City.
	   ``It was well overdue,'' said Prairie View coach Greg Johnson,
who left Langston two years ago to rebuild the Panthers program.
``There wasn't any doubt in my mind what we could do. We just had
to believe and come through in the stretch.''
	   The victory was the Panthers' first since Oct. 28, 1989, when
they defeated Mississippi Valley 21-12. The streak started the
following week with a 19-18 loss at Langston.
	   At Lincoln, Nebraska, DeAngelo Evans and Bobby Newcombe returned
from injuries and scored three touchdowns apiece as second-ranked
Nebraska routed No. 9 Washington 55-7.
	   ``This stings, this hurts,'' Washington quarterback Brock Huard
said ``You just want to crawl into a hole. You can't believe this
happened on national TV.''
	   Nebraska (4-0) hasn't lost at home since a 36-21 defeat to
Washington on Sept. 21, 1991. Evans and Newcombe made sure the
Huskies (2-1) didn't pull off another upset in Lincoln.
	   Evans, returning to the lineup for the first time since 1996,
scored on runs of 60, 14 and 19 yards and finished with 146 yards
on 13 carries in just over 2 1/2 quarters. He missed last season
with an abdominal muscle problem and sat out Nebraska's first three
games this year with a knee injury.
	   Newcombe, the flashy quarterback who missed the past two games
with a knee injury, scored on a 3-yard run and a pair of 2-yard
dashes.
	   The Cornhuskers, who have won or shared a national title three
of the past four years, extended the nation's longest winning
streak to 18 games and improved to 11-0 against Top 10 teams since
a loss to No. 1 Florida State in the 1994 Orange Bowl.
	   In other Top 25 games, it was No. 4 Tennessee 42, Houston 7; No.
5 Kansas State 62, Northeast Louisiana 7; No. 6 LSU 53, Idaho 20;
No. 8 Florida 51, Kentucky 35; No. 10 Florida State 30, No. 18

and TCU 35, co-No. 23 Air Force 34.
 &UR; No. 4 Tennessee 42, Houston 7 &QC; 
	   At Knoxville, Tennessee, Tee Martin threw four touchdown passes
and Jamal Lewis rushed for 135 yards and scored twice.
	   The Volunteers (3-0) were sloppy a week after their big victory
over Florida. They drew 11 penalties and committed two turnovers,
but still beat the Cougars (0-4) in the first meeting between the
teams since 1965.
 &UR; No. 5 Kansas St. 62, NE Louisiana 7 &QC; 
	   At Manhattan, Kansas, Michael Bishop threw for 441 yards and
four touchdowns, including a school-record 97-yarder to Aaron
Lockett, as Kansas State won its 12th straight.
	   Bishop, who set a school record with 475 yards in total offense,
completed 23 of 40 passes and was 48 yards away from Chad May's
school record for passing yards in a game when he went to the bench

set a school record for all-purpose yardage as No. 6 LSU beat
Idaho.
	   Faulk increased his yardage total to 5,397, breaking the mark of
5,326 set by Dalton Hilliard in 1982-85. Faulk had 268 yards

beating the Gators.
 &UR; No. 10 Florida St. 30, No. 18 Southern California 10
	   At Tallahassee, Florida, Chris Weinke threw for 228 yards and
two touchdowns in a game that featured periodic downpours caused by
Hurricane Georges.
	   The Seminoles (3-1) forced five turnovers and held Southern
California (3-1) to three completions for 23 yards passing.
 &UR; No. 11 Virginia 24, Duke 0 &QC; 
	   At Durham, North Carolina, Virginia's defense forced eight
turnovers and Aaron Brooks atoned for a poor passing day with a
57-yard scoring run.
	   Virginia (4-0, 3-0 ACC) is off to its best ACC start in three
years. Duke (2-2, 0-2) lost a record 20th straight league game and
was shut out for the first time in 55 games.
 &UR; No. 14 Wisconsin 38, Northwestern 7 &QC; 
	   At Madison, Wisconsin, Wisconsin (4-0, 1-0 Big Ten) scored

 &UR; No. 17 Texas A and M 28, North Texas 9 &QC;

	   At Blacksburg, Virginia, Keion Carpenter had three
interceptions, including one he returned for a fourth-quarter
touchdown, and Virginia Tech (4-0, 2-0 Big East) won despite
playing much of the game without its top two quarterbacks.
 &UR; Arkansas 42, No. 22 Alabama 6 &QC; 
	   At Fayetteville, Arkansas, Clint Stoerner threw three touchdown

Government reports decline in drug abusers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) _ The number of drug abusers in the territory
continued to fall in the first half of the year, the government
reported Sunday.
	   Illegal drug users dropped by 5.1 percent, while those below the
age of 21 fell by 15.1 percent, compared with the first half 1997,
a government statement said.
	   Of the 10,599 drug abusers reported in the first half, newly
reported users accounted for 1,643, down 15.4 percent from the same
period last year.
	   ``Despite this downward trend, we've not relaxed our anti-drug
efforts,'' Commissioner for Narcotics, Clarie Lo, said in the
statement. She did not provide any reason for the reported decline.
	   Earlier this month, a survey indicated that the percentage of
social workers reporting drug abuse cases has dropped by more than
half since a privacy law came into effect in late 1996, local
papers reported. The law protects the privacy rights of social
workers' clients.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After one of the tightest races in postwar
Germany, voters Sunday choose a chancellor to shepherd Europe's

to Berlin, and the switch from the trusted German mark to the euro,
Europe's common currency.

Seles beats Sanchez-Vicario for title third year in a row
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Monica Seles beat Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario for the
Toyota Princess Cup title for the third consecutive year Sunday,
again using her firepower to overcome the Spaniard's speed and
wiles.
	   Seles' 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory in the 2-hour, 17-minute match left
Sanchez-Vicario with four straight losses in the Toyota finals
after she had won the tournament in 1994. She lost to Mary Pierce
in 1995.
	   Sanchez-Vicario came back from a 3-1 deficit to win the first
set, and threatened to rebound from 3-1 and 5-3 gaps in the third.
But at 30-all in the final game, Seles produced two good serves _
one drawing a miss from Sanchez-Vicario and the other setting up a
vicious forehand crosscourt winner.
	   Seles, seeded second here behind the French Open champion, saved
two break points in the second game _ which she closed out with two
aces _ and two more in the fourth on her way to winning the final
set and the 43rd singles title of her career.
	   This one was worth dlrs 79,000. The loser received dlrs 36,000.
	   ``It was an extremely hard-fought match,'' said Seles, ranked
No. 6 by the WTA. ``In the third set, I was lucky with shots and
had chances to put the match away, but Arantxa came back. The first
and second sets were the same _ they could have gone either way.''
	   Seles that in her four matches during the week, ``I played
better with each game, although it was difficult to adjust to the
changing conditions with the roof open and closed.''
	   After a quarterfinals day of gusty winds Friday, the Ariake
Colosseum Roof was closed for the semifinals and final because of
rain.
	   Sanchez-Vicario, ranked No. 4, said, ``I just think that it was
one or two points that made the difference. ... The luck today was
on her side. Both both ran a lot and played very good points.''
	   In her semifinal victory over Anke Huber, Sanchez-Vicario had
taken a medical timeout after the second set to have the wrist
taped on her hitting arm and said it had helped her strokes in the
final set.
	   In the final, she said, ``my wrists were tight, but that was not
the difference in the match.''
	   She gained her key break in the first set against No. 6 Seles in
the seventh game, coming back from 40-15. She gained her third
deuce thanks to a reflex lob off a Seles overhead, and then won on
two misses by her opponent.
	   But Seles charged back, taking a 5-0 lead in the second set
before Sanchez-Vicario closed the gap to 5-3 by keeping serve twice
and breaking once. Seles finished that set by serving a love game.
	   She now has won 17 of their 20 meetings.
	   The two have met in three finals this year. Sanchez-Vicario beat
Seles for the French Open title, but then lost to her in the Du
Maurier Open final.
	   The two were to meet again later Sunday in the doubles final.
Seles was playing with 17-year-old Russian Anna Kournikova, and
Sanchez-Vicario with American Mary Joe Fernandez.

Broncos win fourth title of the 90s
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Brisbane held Canterbury scoreless in
the second half Sunday to beat the Bulldogs 38-12 and claim the
National Rugby League championship.
	   Trailing 12-10 at halftime, the Broncos scored two quick tries
then dominated a deflated Canterbury team that had come back from
big deficits to win two previous playoff matches, both of them in
extra time.
	   But on Sunday, Brisbane was too strong in defense to allow the
Bulldogs any similar comeback, winning the Australian title for the
fourth time this decade.
	   Brisbane won last year's Super League championship when that
group and the Australian Rugby League had a one-year split. The
Broncos also finished the regular season in first place to win the
minor premiership.
	   Canterbury dominated the 1980s with premierships in 1980, 1984,
1985 and 1988. (djp)

Friend of Rabin's assassin sentenced to nine months jail
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A young woman who knew of the plan to
kill Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin but failed to inform the police
was sentenced Sunday to nine months in prison.
	   Margalit Har-Shefi, 22, a friend of the assassin, Yigal Amir,
was convicted in June of failure to prevent a crime, after she
acknowledged that he boasted to her of his intentions.
	   Amir is serving a life sentence for killing Rabin at a Tel Aviv
peace rally in November 1995. He wanted to stop Israel from making
peace with Palestinians through the transfer of disputed land.
	   Prosecutor Pnina Guy had asked for the maximum penalty of two
years. She said Har-Shefi knew of Amir's two previous aborted
attempts to kill Rabin, and of a cache of weapons hidden at the
West Bank Jewish settlement of Beit El.
	   However District Court Judge Mira Lidski took account of
Har-Shefi's youth and the fact that she has no previous criminal
record.

Japan condemns U.S. subcritical nuclear test
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES with fresh quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ The mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on Sunday
condemned a U.S. test to gauge the reliability of its nuclear
stockpile, saying the experiment will impede nuclear disarmament.
	   Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito said the test ``trampled on the request
by Nagasaki citizens and the people of the world'' not to carry it
out.
	   Takashi Hiraoka, mayor of Hiroshima, said the test ``will
inevitably cause a build-up in the nuclear weapons race.''
	   ``The failure to faithfully accomplish nuclear disarmament as
dictated by the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty led to nuclear
tests by India and Pakistan,'' he said.
	   The United States conducted its fourth subcritical nuclear test
on Saturday at its Nevada Test Site. In such tests, plutonium is
blasted with explosives too weak to set off the self-sustaining
nuclear reaction of an atomic explosion.
	   The United States says the tests are to obtain information on
plutonium samples at varying ages and do not violate the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
	   But anti-nuclear campaigners in Japan say that any kind of
nuclear test is likely to tempt other countries to develop atomic
weapons.
	   ``At a time when hopes are rising for the development of nuclear
disarmament, it is necessary to criticize the United States at the
international level,'' Ito said.
	   Hiroshima and Nagasaki are the only cities ever to suffer atomic
bombings.

Vladivostok residents vote in chaotic elections
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIKE ECKEL &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Residents of the Far Eastern port of
Vladivostok cast votes Sunday in a chaotic election for mayor.
	   In some polling stations, election officials were scrambling to
cross the names of two disqualified candidates off the ballots:
incumbent Mayor Viktor Cherepkov and Vladimir Murashov.
	   A city court ruled Thursday that Cherepkov could not run in the
election because he had illegally paid for his campaign with city
money, while Murashov was barred by the territorial election
commission on Saturday because of anti-Semitic statements.
	   The commission instructed polling stations to strike both names
from the ballots just six hours before polls were to open.
	   ``Why did they remove Cherepkov? I don't understand. This is a
completely illegal election,'' said Galina Ivanova, an agitated
70-year-old voter who is representative of the mayor's loyal
following of mostly senior citizens.
	   Still, many of Vladivostok's 800,000 residents turned out for
the vote. By mid-afternoon, more than the minimum 25 percent of
voters had cast ballots, the city election commission said. Results
were expected on Tuesday.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's representative in the region, Viktor
Kondratov, and the regional parliament chairman Sergei Dudnik had
appealed to Yeltsin on Saturday to leave Cherepkov on the ballot in
order to prevent unrest, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Kondratov said Sunday that tensions were building ``because of
unlawful acts ... against the background of deteriorating economic
problems,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Kondratov alleged that the situation was being deliberately
exacerbated so that ``the whole indignant population of (the
region) will take to the streets on Oct. 7, the day of the
All-Russian protest action.''
	   Communists and their hard-line allies, as well as trade unions,
are joining forces to organize the Oct. 7 protests against Yeltsin.
	   Vladivostok's mayoral election has been delayed for months as
Cherepkov has feuded with regional governor Yevgeny Nazdratenko.
Cherepkov's term expired on July 5.
	   The regional government had Cherepkov ousted in 1994, only to
see him reinstated by Yeltsin two years later. The regional
parliament, backed by Nazdratenko, tried to throw out Cherepkov
last September _ again unsuccessfully.
	   Since taking office in 1993, Cherepkov, a former military man,
has launched an energetic campaign to build roads. However, the
city's economy has continued to decline, with doctors, ambulance
workers and teachers on strike.

	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ For Roger Maris, the magic number was 61 in
'61. For Mark McGwire, it may be 68 in '98.
	   Big Mac hit Nos. 67 and 68 Saturday in the St. Louis Cardinals'
7-6 loss to Montreal, moving two in front of Slammin' Sammy Sosa
with one game left and an incredible seven ahead of the record
Maris set in 37 years ago.
	   ``I might never let this season go. ... It might never happen
again,'' McGwire said.
	   McGwire may have ended the great home run derby a day early.
Cardinals backup catcher Tom Lampkin wouldn't be surprised if
McGwire reaches 70 in Sunday's season finale.
	   ``All it takes is a couple of mistakes, and he's got it,''
Lampkin said. ``I told some guys this morning, `You watch him
today. There's something special about the way he's going about his
business.' ''
	   Sosa was all but conceding.
	   ``It doesn't look good, but I still have a chance,'' he said
after going 2-for-4 with a pair of singles in Chicago's 3-2 win at
Houston. ``I've always been saying Mark is going to finish ahead of
me. He'll probably hit two more Sunday.''
	   Still, McGwire is envious of Sosa.
	   ``Obviously, it feels nice,'' McGwire said. ``But I've got one
more game, and so does he. I think he's got bigger and better
things on his mind, helping the Cubs get into the playoffs.''
	   Only one game remains in the regular season, although there's a
chance Sosa's Cubs could wind up in a wild-card playoff, which
would give him an extra game to catch up.
	   ``McGwire finishes tomorrow and Sosa may not be finished,''
Expos manager Felipe Alou said. ``I know Babe Ruth or Roger Maris
will not hit any more.''
	   McGwire said he wouldn't mind if Sosa caught or surpassed him
with an extra game.
	   ``There's nothing I can do about it,'' he said. ``I'll be home
on the beach, so, sorry.''
	   Manager Tony La Russa said that no matter what happens, McGwire
simply can't lose.
	   ``I think he's trying to do exactly what he said, he's trying to
take his best shot and whatever the numbers are, they are,'' La
Russa said. ``If somebody wants to call him a failure, stand up and
call it, and have your house burned, have your children
kidnapped.''
	   McGwire reclaimed the lead he's relinquished only twice all
season _ and then for only 103 minutes in all _ hitting No. 67 off
Dustin Hermanson in the fourth inning. He connected again in the
seventh, a two-run, 435-foot (133-meter) shot off rookie Kirk
Bullinger that gave him his ninth multihomer game this season and
the 52nd of his career.
	   Although his actions say otherwise, McGwire said he's not in a
better zone than ever.
	   ``My focus has been pretty deep for the last two or three
months,'' McGwire said. ``I don't think it can get any deeper.''
	   Both pitchers followed Alou's instructions and went after
McGwire.
	   ``It's fun to face him,'' Hermanson said. ``I gave him a 96 mph
(155 kph) heater and he hit it. I'm in the business of challenging
hitters.''
	   Bullinger, a former Cardinals farmhand, said he was just trying
to avoid being embarrassed.
	   ``It's fun watching him hit home runs, although it's not
necessarily fun when he does it to you,'' Bullinger said. ``The way
he's swinging, he might hit two more tomorrow.''
	   Sosa led the race for 58 minutes on Aug. 19 before McGwire
regained the lead with his 48th and 49th homers in the same game at
Chicago.
	   Sosa led for 45 minutes on Friday when he hit his 66th before
McGwire answered. That was the 21st time the pair had homered on
the same day. Two at-bats later, McGwire had the lead again.
	   With one out in the fourth Saturday and a sellout crowd of
48,212 on their feet and cheering, he lined a first-pitch fastball
from Hermanson an estimated 403 feet (123-meters) into the
left-field seats.
	   J.D. Drew doubled to chase Tim Young in the seventh and McGwire
hit a 1-1 pitch from Bullinger into the left-center field
bleachers, prompting a second curtain call. Fans remained standing
throughout the three-run rally, which tied the game 6-all.

Friend of Rabin's assassin sentenced to nine months jail

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A young woman who knew of the plan to
kill Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin but failed to inform the police
was sentenced Sunday to nine months in prison.
	   Margalit Har-Shefi, 22, a friend of the assassin, Yigal Amir,
was convicted in June of failure to prevent a crime, after she
acknowledged that he boasted to her of his intentions.
	   Amir is serving a life sentence for killing Rabin at a Tel Aviv
peace rally in November 1995. He wanted to stop Israel from making
peace with Palestinians through the transfer of disputed land.
	   Prosecutor Pnina Guy had asked for the maximum penalty of two
years. She said Har-Shefi knew of Amir's two previous aborted
attempts to kill Rabin and of a cache of weapons hidden at the West
Bank Jewish settlement of Beit El.
	   However District Court Judge Mira Lidski took account of
Har-Shefi's youth and the fact that she has no previous criminal
record.

	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ The sweet singing of hymns came from a
cathedral in this burned and looted capital Sunday as worshippers
prayed for the salvation of this African kingdom.
	   About 450 additional South African troops were being deployed to
areas outside the capital to end a mutiny by Lesotho troops and
halt looting and arson attacks which erupted with South Africa's
military intervention.
	   The capital was calm on Sunday. Long lines of cars queued up at
gas stations, which opened for the first time since the
intervention began on Tuesday.
	   In the capital's sandstone cathedral, 25-year-old bank clerk
Neboang Sebatane bowed her head and prayed for her country.
	   ``I wonder how we are going to survive now that the town is in
ashes,'' she murmured to a reporter. ``So many people are going to
lose their jobs. What then after that?''
	   Sebatane also gave thanks that her bank was spared the attacks
which destroyed at least 80 percent of Maseru's business district.
	   About 1,000 Lesotho soldiers _ half of the army _ streamed into
their headquarters Saturday, raising hopes that clashes between
them and South African troops were ending.
	   South African Col. Jorrie Jordaan told them to return to duty
Monday and to turn in their weapons then, and to tell the other
soldiers to do the same.

Adelaide out in force for AFL champions
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ADELAIDE, Australia (AP) _ Adelaide continued to celebrate the
successful defense of its Australian Football League title Sunday
with a crowd of about 50,000 welcoming home the Australian Rules
football side which beat North Melbourne by 35 points on Saturday.
	   Fans started arriving at the Adelaide Showgrounds early Sunday
morning to get a prime position and entertained themselves with
repeated singing of the club song until the players arrived.
	   Adelaide won Saturday's final 15.15.(105) to 8.22.(70) at the
Melbourne Cricket Ground. The team will be honored again on Tuesday
with a motorcade through the city, an event that attracted 120,000
people last year.
	   The biggest cheers Sunday were reserved for dual premiership
coach Malcolm Blight.
	   Captain Mark Bickley said this year's victory was probably even
more special than last year's first premiership for the club.
	   ``It was just fantastic,'' said Bickley. ``A lot of people
thought we wouldn't go as far as we did but we hung in there and
came up trumps.''
	   Adelaide made a remarkable second-half comeback before a crowd
of almost 95,000, including former boxing great Muhammad Ali, the
halftime guest of honor.
	   Adelaide's Darren Jarman and Andrew McLeod starred for the
second year in a row _ Jarman was the top scorer while McLeod was
voted best player in the final.
	   North, which won its past 11 matches and was the pre-match
favorite, should have delivered a knockout by halftime but wasted
the opportunity with poor kicking. Only six of its 21 scoring shots
went through for goals but it led 51-27 at halftime. (djp)

Broncos win fourth title of the 90s
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: adds scores line, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Brisbane held Canterbury scoreless in
the second half Sunday to beat the Bulldogs 38-12 and claim
Australia's National Rugby League championship at Sydney Football
Stadium.
	   Trailing 12-10 at halftime, the Broncos scored two quick tries
then dominated a deflated Canterbury team that had come back from
big deficits to win two previous playoff matches, both of them in
extra time.
	   But on Sunday, Brisbane was too strong in defense to allow the
Bulldogs any similar comeback, winning the Australian title for the
fourth time this decade.
	   With the hopes of most of the 40,857 Canterbury supporters
alive, Brisbane lock Tonie Carroll charged onto an Allan Langer
pass two minutes into the second half to score the most important
try of the match.
	   It put Brisbane back in front 16-12 after Darren Lockyer's
conversion and from that point it was the Broncos at their
attacking best .
	   Brisbane scored the first try through late inclusion Michael
Devere, who started ahead of veteran Michael Hancock. But
Canterbury struck back through a penalty by winger Darryl Halligan
and a muscling try to forward Tony Grimaldi converted by Halligan
to lead 8-6.
	   Kevin Campion scored for Brisbane in the 28th minute to put
Brisbane back in front 10-8 before Canterbury's New Zealand center
Willie Talau scored after Steve Price busted Brisbane out wide.
	   The Bulldogs returned to the field charged with emotion after
every player _ as they left the dressing room _ shook hands with
club patriarch Peter Moore, who is battling cancer.
	   But Brisbane also came out firing and was uncontrollable at
times in the second 40 minutes.
	   Canterbury forward Troy Stone played 59 minutes with a suspected
broken arm, while five-eighth Craig Polla-Mounter and halfback
Corey Hughes played in the second half with major injuries.
	   Referee Bill Harrigan was involved in several contentious
decisions.
	   Late in the game Canterbury fullback Rod Silva grabbed an
intercept and ran 75 meters before being collared for being
offside.
	   While played continued in Brisbane's 20-meter zone, the stunned
Canterbury players complained to Harrigan 80 meters back after he
awarded the Broncos an offside penalty and recalled the ball.
	   The Broncos won last year's Super League championship when that
group and the Australian Rugby League had a one-year split. The
Broncos also finished the regular season in first place to win the
minor premiership.
	   Brisbane won previous titles in 1992, 1993 and last year.
Canterbury dominated the 1980s with premierships in 1980, 1984,
1985 and 1988.
	   Scores:
	   BRISBANE 38 (Darren Smith, Wendell Sailor, Phil Lee, Gord
Tallis, Tonie Carroll, Michael Devere, Kevin Campion tries, Darren
Lockyer 5 goals) def. CANTERBURY 12 (Willie Talau, Tony Grimaldi
tries, Daryl Halligan 2 goals).

	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ A young woman who knew of the plan to
kill Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin but failed to inform the police
was sentenced Sunday to nine months in prison.
	   Margalit Har-Shefi, 22, a friend of the assassin, Yigal Amir,
was convicted in June of failure to prevent a crime, after she
acknowledged that he boasted to her of his intentions. She also
received a 15-month suspended sentence.
	   In a prepared statement read at the Tel Aviv Magistrates Court,
Har-Shefi said she thought Amir was only boasting and never took
him seriously.
	   ``Had I even the slightest suspicion that that man meant what he
said, not only would I have reported him, I would have seen it as
my civic and religious duty,'' she said.
	   Wearing a white sweater, ankle-length skirt and white tennis
shoes, Har-Shefi rarely looked up as Judge Mira Lidski read out the
grounds for the sentence.
	   ``If she had shown more responsibility and taken more vigorous
action to prevent this crime, it is possible that the murder would
not have occurred,'' Lidski said.
	   Har-Shefi's lawyer Yosef Eilon said his client intends to appeal
the sentence. Har-Shefi will remain free on bail until the Tel Aviv
District Court rules on the appeal, which will be heard on Oct. 27.
	   Amir is serving a life sentence for killing Rabin at a Tel Aviv

	   Prosecutor Pnina Guy had asked for the maximum penalty of two

to which she has been subjected since police began investigating
her.

	   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ U.S. troops arrested a
former Bosnian Serb police chief indicted by the international
criminal court for murder, rape and other crimes against humanity
during the 1992-1995 Bosnian War, officials announced Sunday.
	   Stevan Todorovic was apprehended by without incident in the
northern Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac, about 70 kms (44 miles)
northwest of here, a NATO statement said.
	   International sources in Sarajevo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the troops who made the arrest were Americans.
	   Tododrovic, 41, has been indicted by the U.N. war crimes court
in The Hague, Netherlands, for `` grave breaches, violations of the
laws or customs of war and crime against humanity'' allegedly
committed in 1992 when he was police chief of Bosanski Samac.
	   Specific charges include murder, rape and torture.
	   ``This action serves as yet another warming to all those
indicted for war crimes who are still at large that they will not
escape justice,'' NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said in a
statement early Sunday morning.
	   The arrest was made a few hours before U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen arrived in Bosnia for a one-day visit.

anonymity, said U.S troops made the arrest.
	   Todorovic, 41, was indicted by the U.N. war crimes court in The
Hague, Netherlands, for ``grave breaches, violations of the laws or
customs of war and crimes against humanity'' allegedly committed in
1992 when he was police chief of Bosanski Samac.
	   Specific charges include murder, rape and torture.
	   ``This action serves as yet another warning to all those
indicted for war crimes who are still at large that they will not
escape justice,'' NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said in a
statement issued Sunday morning.
	   The arrest was made a few hours before U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen was to arrive in Bosnia for a one-day visit.

Cathay Pacific to start servicing Philippine domestic routes

	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Cathay Pacific Airways will start
flying domestic routes in the Philippines to fill a vacuum left by
the closure of Philippine Airlines, an official of the Hong
Kong-based carrier said Sunday.
	   Philippine President Joseph Estrada and other officials have
begun discussions with Cathay Pacific executives over the details
of the airlines's sudden route expansion, which was scheduled to
begin Monday.
	   PAL's closure last Wednesday left many areas of the sprawling
Philippine archipelago without air service, and officials were
struggling to bridge the gap to avoid serious damage to the
economy.
	   A Cathay Pacific official in Manila, Betina Palpal-latoc, said
the airline was initially prepared to start flight connecting
Manila, central Cebu city and the port city of Davao in the
southern region of Mindanao.
	   She said the company did not expect to earn a profit from the
temporary flight service, which entails the use of Cathay Pacific
aircraft leased by the Philippine government.
	   ``This is not a revenue-generating exercise,'' Palpal-latoc
said, adding the carrier was trying to help the Philippines at
Estrada's request.
	   Estrada said Saturday that Cathay Pacific was also willing to
take over management of PAL if the shutdown of the Philippine
flag-carrier becomes permanent.
	   At least three Philippine domestic carriers have committed to
expand their operations and air force planes were helping carry
vital cargo, including mail, medicine and newspapers, officials
said.
	   Despite PAL's closure, labor department officials have said they
would still try to reconcile differences between PAL's management
and its largest workers' union, Estrada said.
	   PAL shut down after a union representing ground personnel
refused to accept a management-proposed rehabilitation plan in
which workers would have received 20 percent of the airline's stock
in exchange for a 10-year suspension of their collective bargaining
agreement.
	   Union leaders, however, offered Saturday not to strike for 10
years and to accept cuts in various benefits as long as their
current grievance mechanisms were maintained.
	   ``We affirm our commitment to cooperate with PAL management,''
the ground crew union said.
	   A committee formed by Manila's Securities and Exchange
Commission has been charged with studying whether or not there is
any chance of reopening the carrier, which has been unable to make
payments on dlrs 2.1 billion in debts to domestic and international
creditors.
	   Estrada has refused to sign onto a government take-over of PAL,
saying it could not afford to underwrite daily losses of up to 45
million pesos (dlrs 1 million) which have been incurred by the
airline.
	   Both PAL and Cathay Pacific have been hit hard by Asia's
currency crisis, which has reduced passenger volume. PAL had
launched a dlrs 4 billion modernization and refleeting program
shortly before the crisis hit.
	   The Philippine flag carrier also was badly hurt by labor
disputes, including a 22-day pilots' strike in June.

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen arrived Sunday for a one-day visit and a first-hand
look at implementation of the U.S.-brokered peace accord that ended
Bosnia's three and one-half year war.
	   The results of this month's national elections, in which an
ultranationalist beat the U.S.-backed candidate for a key post in
the Bosnian Serb entity, have raised questions about the program to
implement the 1995 Dayton peae accords.
	   Shortly before his arrival, NATO announced its peacekeepers
arrested a Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect, Stevan Todorovic, in
the northern town of Bosnaski Samac. Sources in Sarajevo, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said American troops made the arrest.
	   NATO's failure to arrest key war crimes suspects, notably former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, is often cited as one of the
reasons for slow progress in implementing the Dayton accords.
	   Cohen, who flew here from Italy, is to meet commanders of the
NATO-led peace force and top international mediators charged with
political and economic reconstruction of the country.
	   A U.S. Embassy statement said the visit is ``part of his
continuing interest in the civilian aspect of the Dayton (peace
accord) implementation.''
	   On Friday, international officials who supervised Bosnia's Sept.
12-13 election confirmed that ultranationalist Nikola Poplasen had
won election as president of the Bosnian Serb republic.
	   Poplasen promised to preserve ``all the good that the
international community and the previous moderate Serb government
accomplished'' and strive for a democratic society based on a
market economy.
	   However, Poplasen has also said that the Dayton accord war never
envisioned the same kind of single state for Bosnia's Serbs, Croats
and Muslims as the Americans and other Western countries insist it
does.
	   U.S. official have indicated that they're putting more stock in
Poplasen's past record as a nationalist hard-liner than his
promises of cooperation.
	   The Dayton accord left Bosnia divided between a Bosnian Serb
republic and a federation of Muslims and Croats. Both of those
entities have their own governments but are linked by a third joint
central government.
	   On Saturday, Cohen signed an agreement in Skopje, Macedonia,
establishing a southeast European peace force. The force would
engage in humanitarian activities, such as aid relief and keeping
truces.

	   LONDON (AP) _ Police on Sunday charged one of seven men arrested
in an anti-terrorist operation days earlier with illegally
possessing a firearm.
	   A second man arrested in the raids in northwest and west London
on Wednesday was released without charge early Sunday, said a
Scotland Yard spokesman, speaking anonymously. The remaining five
are being held on suspicion that they are illegal immigrants.
	   Police have refused to say why the men were arrested. But the
British news agency Press Association said at the time that the
operation was aimed at associates of Osama bin Laden, the Saudi
dissident who has been linked to the bombings of U.S. embassies in
Kenya and Tanzania.
	   Scotland Yard said the arrests that they were not thought to be
linked with any unsolved terrorist incident and has not provided
any information on whether those detained were suspected of
plotting actions in Britain or abroad.
	   It has also not identified the suspects in any way. The
spokesman would say only that a 38-year-old man was charged Sunday
with possessing a prohibited firearm and would appear before London
magistrates on Monday.
	   Five of the men ''have been detained in the interests of
national security pending a decision on their immigration status,''
the spokesman said.
	   Bin Laden, a multimillionaire Islamic fundamentalist is
suspected of using his wealth to finance the two Aug. 7 bombings of
the U.S. embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam that killed 259
people and injured thousands more.
	   The attacks prompted American missile attacks on suspected
terrorist facilities in Sudan and Afghanistan, where bin Laden is
based. He escaped injury and remains at large.

Mahathir's former deputy defends his old boss against criticism
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir
Mohamad's controversial firing of his protege, Anwar Ibrahim, was
defended Sunday by the country's former deputy leader, a man who
was replaced by Anwar in 1993.
	   Mahathir faces rising protests at home and growing international
criticism abroad over the firing and subsequent arrest of Anwar,
his former deputy prime minister, on a number of sex-related and
other charges.
	   But Ghafar Baba, also a former deputy premier, said Malaysia's
constitution gives Mahathir full authority to choose and remove
members of his Cabinet, including the No. 2 post of deputy prime
minister.
	   ``Mahathir found Anwar to be not fit to lead the nation because
he has evidence that Anwar had engaged in improper sexual behavior
that cannot be tolerated,'' Ghafar Baba, speaking at a news
conference in Jakarta, where several small protests have been
staged recently in support of Anwar.
	   The former Malaysian deputy leader said he planned his visit to
Indonesia as a concerned individual to clear up any erroneous
perceptions about recent events in his country due to misreporting.
	   Some analysts have drawn parallels between Mahathir's behavior
and that of neighboring Indonesia's longtime autocrat, President
Suharto, who was forced to quit after protests and deadly riots in
May.
	   But Ghafar Baba said it was wrong to compare Mahathir with
Suharto.

Opposition coalition formation snagged by Malaysian police

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The planned launch of a coalition
of opposition parties and non-governmental groups touting political
reform in Malaysia appeared jeopardized Sunday following clashes
between police and anti-government protesters in the Southeast
Asian country.
	   The Coalition for People's Democracy was scheduled to hold its
first meeting Sunday at a hotel in the capital city of Kuala
Lumpur, but hotel management was being pressured by police to
cancel the gathering, said an organizer of the group who requested
anonymity.
	   Opposition to the detention of fired deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim has sparked mass demonstrations and a newfound sense of
unity among political opposition groups in Malaysia.
	   The umbrella organization of political groups has called for an
end to restrictions on assembly and speech, along with the
abolition of the draconian Internal Security Act, under which Anwar
and 16 of his associates have been jailed without trial.
	   Police beat demonstrators and used a water cannon to disperse a
rally of more than 3,000 people Saturday in downtown Kuala Lumpur.
Twenty-nine Malaysians were arrested for gathering illegally,
police said.
	   Public gatherings require police permits in Malaysia.
	   Such street demonstrations, unheard of in Malaysia until
recently, have grown in size and frequency. They started after
Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar on Sept. 2 and have
gained momentum since Anwar's arrest and disappearance into police
custody last Sunday.
	   Islamic fundamentalist opposition Parti Islam Se-Malaysia, known
as PAS, planned to stage a rally Sunday night outside the capital
to launch another coalition called the Malaysian Justice Movement,
also backed by opposition parties and non-governmental
organizations.
	   Anwar, who has not yet been formally charged in court, stands
accused of crimes that include unlawful sex acts and leaking state
secrets. He has denied the charges, saying they were politically
motivated. Anwar said his only fault was challenging Mahathir's
17-year-reign.
	   Mahathir said Saturday Anwar will be brought to court when the
activists stop the protests.
	   ``I want to advise them to allow the courts to decide whether
the charges against Anwar are true or not. Do not disrupt the
process of the law in the country,'' he said.
	   Anwar supporters have called on people to gather at Merdeka
Square, or Independence Square, on Monday, a national holiday.
	   The lush green park, one of Kuala Lumpur's tourist attractions,
was closed off to the public on Sunday, ostensibly for maintenance.
The announcement by the city hall came Saturday after police had
dispersed people that had gathered outside the square.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties won enough seats

Vladimir Meciar if they join forces as pledged, unofficial results
released Sunday showed.

that has dominated this country throughout its nearly six years of
independence.
	   The Central Election Commission, which released the figures
Sunday morning, said they should remain virtually unchanged when
official results are released Tuesday.
	   Meciar's hard-line nationalist ruling party, the Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia, finished ahead of all other 16 parties with 27
percent of the vote, based on the unofficial results. That would
give it 43 seats in the 150-seat Parliament.
	   But the top opposition party, the Slovak Democratic Coalition,
was right behind it _ leading a strong showing by four opposition
parties with 26.3 percent and 42 seats.

Malaysia appears headed for more turbulence as protests intensify

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ One week after Malaysia's former
deputy prime minister was arrested by armed police, the movement
against Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's 17-year rule appears to
be gaining momentum.
	   Police batons, tear gas and water cannons and more than 150
arrests have not been enough to deter protesters from swarming onto
the streets in a show of solidarity with ousted deputy premier
Anwar Ibrahim.
	   Anwar's wife, nominated by him to lead the Southeast Asian
nation's nascent reform campaign, has been silenced by police
threats. His main political supporters, like him, have been put
behind bars under an Internal Security Act which allows detention
without trial.
	   But thousands of ordinary Malaysians have joined protest
rallies, many of whom chanted ``reform, reform!'' and demanded
Mahathir's resignation.
	   Deprived of its leadership, the movement was expected by some
observers to fade away. Yet support has grown, attracting
opposition parties and volunteer groups which risk Mahathir's wrath
by openly joining Anwar's campaign.
	   ``We don't know where the leadership is coming from. People
themselves are taking the lead,'' said Anil Netto of the Aliran, a
social reform group.
	   Because Anwar's supporters have been denied access to the local
press and television, they have turned to the Internet to help
publicize their agenda using new pro-Anwar websites which have
mushroomed in recent weeks.
	   They also rely on old-fashioned word of mouth to keep people
informed.
	   Mahathir, 72, fired his right-hand man on Sept. 2. Relieved of
his official duties, the 51-year-old Anwar immediately began a
campaign against his former boss. Touring the countryside giving
speeches, Anwar drew huge crowds _ even in areas traditionally
considered to be bastions of support for Mahathir.
	   The speeches, which called for increased political freedom,
culminated in a rally attended by 35,000 people in downtown Kuala
Lumpur which took place just hours before Anwar's arrest.
	   By the time he had brought his roadshow to the capital's
Independence Square, Anwar had stepped up his criticism to the
point where he openly called for the resignation of his mentor,
Mahathir _ the man he was designated to succeed.
	   Analysts say Anwar is getting most of his support from a Malay
Muslim Youth group, the ABIM, which claims a membership of 50,000
people. As a young activist, he led the group before joining the
government.
	   But protests in the wake of his arrest also appear to be drawing
in political moderates who have no affiliation with Muslim student
groups or known anti-establishment organizations.
	   Of the 29 people arrested during Saturday's scattered
demonstrations in the capital, only four were Muslim students. The
others were government employees, workers at private companies or
self-employed entrepreneurs.
	   ``We've got no savior, but it doesn't matter,'' said a
37-year-old nuclear scientist, one of the 3,000 involved in
Saturday's protest, who wanted to be identified only as Ahmad.
	   ``Look what happened in Tiananmen (Square) and in Indonesia.
There were no leaders, but it did not stop the flames from
igniting.''
	   Authorities' refusal so far to bring Anwar to trial to face the
multitude of charges which Mahathir has leveled against him has
also stoked anger among pro-reform activists.
	   Anwar stands accused of crimes ranging from illegal homosexual
acts to treason.
	   ``I think there is a lot of resentment because Anwar is not
being fairly treated,'' said Netto of the social reform group
Aliran.
	   Despite repeated assurances from Mahathir and the head of
Malaysia's federal court that Anwar would be given a fair trail,
the accused has yet to be brought to court. Neither his lawyers nor
his family have seen him.
	   ``Many feel that this (protest) is the only avenue'' to vent
feelings of frustration with the heavy-hand of the Malaysian
government, said Khoo Boo Teik, author of a 1996 biography of
Mahathir titled ``Paradoxes of Mahathirism.''
	   The growing protests have exploded the myth that Malaysians are
politically apathetic, he said in an interview.
	   Political activity in Malaysia is strictly controlled by the
state.
	   The last time Malaysians dared to protest on the streets was 11
years ago, when opponents within the governing United Malays
National Organization made an abortive attempt at a leadership
change. The party split, but Mahathir survived.
	   This year, recognized political parties were routinely denied
permission for meetings and riot police broke up a meeting
organized by the Democratic Action Party, the main opposition group
in Parliament.
	   Even when a consumer group wanted to organize a meeting of
residents to discuss water rationing three months ago, police
ordered them to call it off.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties won enough seats
in national elections to be able to oust Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar if they join forces as pledged, unofficial results released
Sunday showed.
	   The results, based on full but unofficial tallies from all 5,000
precincts in Slovakia, may signal the end of the authoritarian rule
that has dominated this country throughout its nearly six years of
independence.
	   The Central Election Commission, which released the figures
Sunday morning, said they should remain virtually unchanged when

Israeli lawmaker calls for pre-emptive strike on Iran
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MARK LAVIE &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Branding the leaders of Iran ``insane,'' a
member of the moderate wing of Israel's parliament Sunday called on
Israel to consider a pre-emptive strike, after Iran paraded
missiles that could reach Israel.
	   But Uzi Landau, chairman of the Israeli parliament's foreign
affairs and security committee, criticized that call, saying such
remarks could heighten the likelihood of Israel being targeted.
	   Ephraim Sneh, a general in the Israeli Army reserves and a
leading member of the moderate Labor party, asserted that
international efforts to keep Iran from acquiring long-range
missiles and atomic weapons have failed. He said Israel does not
have the capability to defend against this threat.
	   ``I am talking about the possibility, if we have no choice, to
deliver a conventional counter-strike or pre-emptive strike,'' he
told Israel's Channel Two.
	   Iran displayed its medium-range Shahab-3 missile during a
military parade Friday. The missile, which Iran tested in July, has
a range of 1,300 kilometers (800 miles).
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has
``exceptional'' means to counter the threat from Iran, but warned
in an interview from New York on Israel radio that ``a strategic
threat against us is developing.''
	   He said it confirmed Israeli assessments over the past two
years, and called for international efforts to stop Iran's missile
and weapons programs.
	   Landau told Israel radio that nations actually planning a
pre-emptive strike don't talk about it in advance, giving the other
side a chance to prepare. In addition, he said, ``unnecessary
chatter makes Israel a higher-priority target.''
	   Landau said he was not playing down the threat to Israel from
Iran, but noted that Iran has other potential enemies, like Iraq,
Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan.
	   Sneh said Iran's Shahab-3 missile will be operational next year,
before the Arrow anti-missile system, a joint Israel-U.S. project
now in the testing stage. He said Iran is developing atomic weapons
at the same fast rate.
	   ``Together with the insane heads of state in Teheran...this
constitutes a threat Israel cannot live with,'' he said.
	   He discounted recent moderate statements from Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami, saying he is not the one who makes policy in
Teheran.

Greek minister hits Turkish-Israeli military cooperation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Greece's defense minister was quoted on
Sunday as criticizing military cooperation between Israel and
Turkey as destabilizing to the Middle East.
	   The minister, Akis Tzochatzopoulos, said in an interview
published by the Cypriot daily Phileleftheros that the cooperation
pact ``creates concern among a series of people because of the
given destabilizing policy of Turkey in the region.''
	   He added: ``The Arab and other people do not see this
cooperation with pleasure.''
	   The Greek Minister said he raised the issue with the Israeli
ambassador in Athens and will discuss it in detail when Israel's
defense minister visits Greece in coming weeks.
	   The Israel-Turkey military cooperation has been criticized by
Arab states and by Cyprus. Turkey has occupied the northern third
of Cyprus since 1974, when it invaded to protect Turkish Cypriots
following an abortive coup by Greek Cypriot supporters of union
with Greece.
	   Arab nations, especially Syria, have accused Turkey of helping
to strengthen Israeli military capabilities at their expense.
	   Relations between NATO allies Greece and Turkey have been tense
for years over Cyprus and Ankara's territorial claims in the
Aegean.
	   The Turkish-Israeli military cooperation agreement allows for
joint air and naval exercises and the use of Turkish airspace by
Israeli pilots during their training.
	   Last week, Israel announced that it will upgrade 48 Turkish air
force F-5 training planes for dlrs 70 million. Israel earlier won a
contract to upgrade 54 Turkish air force Phantom jet fighters.

	   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO troops arrested a
former Bosnian Serb police chief indicted by the international war
crimes court for murder, rape and other crimes during the 1992-1995
Bosnian War, officials announced Sunday.
	   Stevan Todorovic was apprehended by without incident in the
northern Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac, about 70 kms (44 miles)
northwest of here, a NATO statement said.
	   A NATO source in Sarajevo, speaking on condition of anonymity,
said the troops who made the arrest were Americans, although there
was no official confirmation. The operation took place a few hours
before U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen arrived in Bosnia for a
one-day visit.
	   Todorovic, 41, has been indicted by the U.N. war crimes court in
The Hague, Netherlands, for ``grave breaches, violations of the
laws or customs of war and crime against humanity'' allegedly
committed in 1992 when he was police chief of Bosanski Samac.
	   Specific charges include murder, rape and torture.
	   In The Hague, tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said
Todorovic was indicted in July 1995 on 15 counts _ five war crimes;
five ``grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions;'' and five crimes
against humanity.
	   Among his alleged offenses, he is charged with murdering one
Muslim, beating at least six others and forcing two prisoners whose
identities were not released to perform unspecified sexual acts on
each other in front of other prisoners and Serb guards _ an
allegation which carries a rape charge.
	   ``This action serves as yet another warming to all those
indicted for war crimes who are still at large that they will not
escape justice,'' NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said in a
statement early Sunday morning.
	   NATO spokeswoman Maj. Sheena Thomson said Todorovic would be
transported later in the day to The Hague.
	   Todorovic is the ninth indicted suspect to be picked up in
Bosnia by NATO forces and becomes the 26th suspect in custody out
of 58 suspects indicted. He is the fourth Bosnian Serb suspect in
custody charged with offenses committed after the Serb takeover of
Bosanski Samac.
	   It was not immediately clear if he would be tried together with
the other three.
	   The arrest took place two days after the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe confirmed that a Bosnian Serb
ultranationalist, Nikola Poplasen, had defeated the U.S.-backed
incumbent for president of the Bosnian Serb republic in this
month's national election.
	   Poplasen's election has raised concern about Bosnian Serb
cooperation with terms of the 1995 Dayton agreement which ended the
three and one-half year Bosnian war, especially the return of
refugees to areas from which they were driven by rival Bosnian
groups.
	   One Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
suggested the arrest was intended as an ``early test'' of
Poplasen's assurances that he would cooperate with international
officials overseeing implementation of Dayton.
	   Thomson described that, however, as ``pure speculation.''

	   Two other opposition parties came next. The Party of the
Democratic Left _ former communists turned Social Democrats _ got
14.7 percent to earn 23 seats. The Hungarian Coalition Party,
representing Slovakia's largest minority ethnic group, had 9.1
percent for 15 seats.
	   A fourth party that has declared its intent to join in an
opposition alliance _ the six-month-old Party of Civic
Understanding, led by the popular mayor of Kosice, Slovakia's
second-largest city _ got 8 percent for 13 seats.
	   If confirmed by official results, that would give the opposition
forces 93 deputies in Parliament, which selects both the prime
minister and the president.
	   Meciar's weakened HZDS, which fared much better in the last
elections in 1994, appears to have only potential ally among the
six parties who received the minimum 5 percent required for
Parliament seats. The far-right Slovak National Party, its main
partner in the current ruling coalition, got 9 percent for 13
seats.
	   The HZDS' other coalition partner, the Slovak Workers'
Association, failed to get 5 percent, according to the unofficial
results.

BRATISLAVA: unofficial results
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   Opposition parties already had proclaimed victory and celebrated
with champagne Saturday, based on similar exit poll numbers and a
sampling of unofficial results. They scheduled talks later Sunday
to try to seal their alliance and form a governing majority.
	   But the political demise of Meciar, whose anti-democratic
practices have left Slovakia diplomatically isolated in Central
Europe, is not yet certain.
	   Meciar has promised to accept the results, but rumors still
swirled Sunday that ruling authorities might try something out of
desperation to stay in power, including invalidating the election
or meddling with the results, as international human rights groups
have warned.
	   Officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which had more than 200 monitors in Slovakia for the
elections, said the voting process from parliamentary elections
Friday and Saturday appeared to have gone well.
	   The key, foreign officials said, will be in the official results
and how they are implemented.
	   If it is the top vote-getting party, the HZDS would likely be
given first chance to put together another governing coalition.
Even though its prospects for finding allies are bleak because of
strong anti-Meciar sentiments, political jockeying and posturing
began as soon as the voting ended.
	   Opposition leaders said without exception Saturday that they
were assured a joint majority in Parliament.
	   ``This is a vote for new hope and for a new beginning for
Slovakia,'' said coalition leader Mikulas Dzurinda, who stands to
be prime minister if the opposition alliance takes power.
	   But ruling party official Milan Topoli insisted the HZDS could
still put together a majority coalition with the help of the Party
of the Democratic Left, former Communists.
	   The vice chairwoman of that party, Brigita Schmognerova,
dismissed such a notion and said the ruling party leaders ``only
want to give us a bad name by saying we will cooperate with them.''
	   She stopped short of guaranteeing they would join the opposition
alliance, saying the other parties must ``accept our
requirements.''

leading member of the Labor party, asserted that international
efforts to keep Iran from acquiring long-range missiles and atomic
weapons have failed. He said Israel does not have the capability to
defend against this threat.
	   ``I am talking about the possibility, if we have no choice, to
deliver a conventional counter-strike or pre-emptive strike,'' he
told Israel's Channel Two.
	   Iran displayed its medium-range Shahab-3 missile during a
military parade Friday. The missile, which Iran tested in July, has
a range of 1,300 kilometers (800 miles).
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has
``exceptional'' means to counter the threat from Iran, but warned
in an interview from New York on Israel radio that ``a strategic
threat against us is developing.''
	   He said it confirmed Israeli assessments over the past two
years, and called for international efforts to stop Iran's missile
and weapons programs.
	   Landau told Israel radio that nations actually planning a
pre-emptive strike don't talk about it in advance, giving the other
side a chance to prepare. In addition, he said, ``unnecessary
chatter makes Israel a higher-priority target.''
	   Landau said he was not playing down the threat to Israel from
Iran, but noted that Iran has other potential enemies, like Iraq,
Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan.
	   Sneh said Iran's Shahab-3 missile will be operational next year,
before the Arrow anti-missile system, a joint Israel-U.S. project
now in the testing stage. He said Iran is developing atomic weapons
at the same fast rate.
	   ``Together with the insane heads of state in Teheran...this
constitutes a threat Israel cannot live with,'' he said.
	   He discounted recent moderate statements from Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami, saying he is not the one who makes policy in
Teheran.

Opposition meeting halted by Malaysian police

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The launch of a coalition of
opposition parties and non-governmental groups touting political
reform in Malaysia was canceled Sunday after police ordered a hotel
not to rent its venue for the gathering.
	   One day after clashes between police and anti-government
protesters, the first meeting of The Coalition for People's
Democracy was scheduled to convene at a hotel in downtown Kuala
Lumpur, the Malaysian capital.
	   But nearly 200 people who had assembled for the gathering were
told the Federal Hotel had been ordered by police not to allow the
use of the room where the meeting was to be held.
	   ``The government is sensitive to the latest developments and
pressured the hotel management to refuse the use the hall,'' said
Tien Chua, chairman of the coalition, an umbrella organization of
four opposition parties and 14 volunteer groups.
	   Hotel and police officials declined to comment on the incident.
	   Opposition to the firing and subsequent arrest of deputy prime
minister Anwar Ibrahim has sparked mass demonstrations and a
newfound sense of unity among political opposition groups in the
Southeast Asian country.
	   ``The peoples' struggle to protect democracy and justice will be
a difficult and long one, but the truth will prevail,'' said Syed
Husin Ali, leader of the opposition Malaysian Peoples' Party.
	   Organizers said a new date would be announced soon for the
formal launch of their umbrella organization, which seeks an end to
restrictions on assembly and speech. It also wants the abolishment
of the draconian Internal Security Act, under which Anwar and 16 of
his associates have been jailed without trial.
	   Pro-reform activists have distributed leaflets and stickers
demanding the repeal of the harsh security law. Postcards addressed
to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad reading ``What's Up doc?'' have
likewise been distributed by critics of the 72-year old premier.
	   Mahathir, a physician by training, is often referred to as ``Dr.
M'' in Malaysia.
	   On Saturday, police beat demonstrators and used a water cannon
to disperse a rally of more than 3,000 people. Twenty-nine
Malaysians were arrested for gathering illegally, police said.
	   Even small public gatherings and outdoor assemblies require
police permits.
	   Street demonstrations, unheard of until recently in Malaysia,
have grown in size and frequency. They started after Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad fired Anwar on Sept. 2 and have gained momentum
since Anwar's arrest and disappearance into police custody last
Sunday.
	   Islamic fundamentalist opposition Parti Islam Se-Malaysia, known
as PAS, planned to stage a rally Sunday night outside the capital
to launch another coalition called the Malaysian Justice Movement,
also backed by opposition parties and non-governmental
organizations.
	   Anwar, who has not yet been formally charged in court, stands
accused of crimes that include unlawful sex acts and leaking state
secrets. He has denied the charges, saying they were politically
motivated. Anwar said his only fault was challenging Mahathir's
17-year-reign.
	   Mahathir said Saturday Anwar will be brought to court when the
activists stop the protests.
	   ``I want to advise them to allow the courts to decide whether
the charges against Anwar are true or not. Do not disrupt the
process of the law in the country,'' he said.
	   Anwar supporters have called on people to gather at Merdeka
Square, or Independence Square, on Monday, a national holiday.
	   The lush green park, one of Kuala Lumpur's tourist attractions,
was closed off to the public on Sunday, ostensibly for maintenance.
The announcement by the city hall came Saturday after police had
dispersed people that had gathered outside the square.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties won enough seats
in two-day national elections to be able to oust Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar if they join forces as pledged, according to
unofficial results released Sunday.
	   The results, based on full but unofficial tallies from all 5,000
precincts in Slovakia, may signal the end of the authoritarian rule
that has dominated this country throughout its nearly six years of
independence.
	   The Central Election Commission, which released the figures
Sunday morning, said they should remain virtually unchanged when
official results are released Tuesday.
	   Meciar's hard-line nationalist ruling party, the Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia, finished ahead of all other 16 parties with 27
percent of the vote, based on the unofficial results. That would
give it 43 seats in the 150-seat Parliament.
	   But the top opposition party, the Slovak Democratic Coalition,
was right behind it _ leading a strong showing by four opposition
parties with 26.3 percent and 42 seats.
	   Two other opposition parties came next. The Party of the
Democratic Left _ former communists turned Social Democrats _ got
14.7 percent to earn 23 seats. The Hungarian Coalition Party,
representing Slovakia's largest minority ethnic group, had 9.1
percent for 15 seats.
	   A fourth party that has declared its intent to join in an
opposition alliance _ the six-month-old Party of Civic
Understanding, led by the popular mayor of Kosice, Slovakia's
second-largest city _ got 8 percent for 13 seats.
	   If confirmed by official results, that would give the opposition
forces 93 deputies in Parliament, which selects both the prime
minister and the president.
	   Meciar's weakened HZDS, which fared much better in the last
elections in 1994, appears to have only potential ally among the
six parties who received the minimum 5 percent required for
Parliament seats. The far-right Slovak National Party, its main
partner in the current ruling coalition, got 9 percent for 13
seats.
	   The HZDS' other coalition partner, the Slovak Workers'
Association, failed to get 5 percent, according to the unofficial
results.
	   Opposition parties already had proclaimed victory and celebrated
with champagne Saturday, based on similar exit poll numbers and a
sampling of unofficial results. They scheduled talks later Sunday
to try to seal their alliance and form a governing majority.
	   But the political demise of Meciar, whose anti-democratic
practices have left Slovakia diplomatically isolated in Central
Europe, is not yet certain.
	   Meciar has promised to accept the results, but rumors still
swirled Sunday that ruling authorities might try something out of
desperation to stay in power, including invalidating the election
or meddling with the results, as international human rights groups
have warned.
	   Officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which had more than 200 monitors in Slovakia for the
elections, said the voting process from parliamentary elections
Friday and Saturday appeared to have gone well.
	   The key, foreign officials said, will be in the official results
and how they are implemented.
	   If it is the top vote-getting party, the HZDS would likely be
given first chance to put together another governing coalition.
Even though its prospects for finding allies are bleak because of
strong anti-Meciar sentiments, political jockeying and posturing
began as soon as the voting ended.
	   Opposition leaders said without exception Saturday that they
were assured a joint majority in Parliament.
	   ``This is a vote for new hope and for a new beginning for
Slovakia,'' said coalition leader Mikulas Dzurinda, who stands to
be prime minister if the opposition alliance takes power.
	   But ruling party official Milan Topoli insisted the HZDS could
still put together a majority coalition with the help of the Party
of the Democratic Left, former Communists.
	   The vice chairwoman of that party, Brigita Schmognerova,
dismissed such a notion and said the ruling party leaders ``only
want to give us a bad name by saying we will cooperate with them.''
	   She stopped short of guaranteeing they would join the opposition
alliance, saying the other parties must ``accept our
requirements.''

Seles beats Sanchez-Vicario for title third year in a row
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with doubles, new quotes &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Monica Seles beat Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario for the
Toyota Princess Cup title for the third consecutive year Sunday,
again using her firepower to overcome the Spaniard's speed and
wiles.
	   Seles' 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory in the 2-hour, 17-minute match left
Sanchez-Vicario with four straight losses in the Toyota finals
after she had won the tournament in 1994. She lost to Mary Pierce
in 1995.
	   Sanchez-Vicario came back from a 3-1 deficit to win the first
set, and threatened to rebound from 3-1 and 5-3 gaps in the third.
But at 30-all in the final game, Seles produced two good serves _
one drawing a miss from Sanchez-Vicario and the other setting up a
vicious forehand crosscourt winner.
	   Seles, seeded second here behind the French Open champion, saved
two break points in the second game _ which she closed out with two
aces _ and two more in the fourth on her way to winning the final
set and the 43rd singles title of her career.
	   This one was worth dlrs 79,000. The loser received dlrs 36,000.
	   ``I felt I played some great tennis at key times but I also at
times let Arantxa back into the match,'' said Seles, ranked No. 6
by the WTA. ``Overall, I'm happy with my fitness _ my movement and
stamina _ but I can't say I'm happy that I didn't get a single drop
shot.
	   ``She's a fighter, she never keeps up and she keeps improving,''
Seles added. ``I'm a fighter too, and it brings out the best in
both of us.''
	   Sanchez-Vicario, ranked No. 4, said, ``My serve was probably
less effective than hers. She served better when she needed to.
There were good points, good strategy, but I probably needed a
little more luck. ... Her shots came with the right timing when she
needed them on the line.''
	   In her semifinal victory over Anke Huber, Sanchez-Vicario had
taken a medical timeout after the second set to have the wrist
taped on her hitting arm and said it had helped her strokes in the
final set.
	   In Sunday's final, she said, ``my wrists were tight, but that
was not the difference in the match.''
	   She gained her key break in the first set against No. 6 Seles in
the seventh game, coming back from 40-15. She gained her third
deuce thanks to a reflex lob off a Seles overhead, and then won on
two misses by her opponent.
	   But Seles charged back, taking a 5-0 lead in the second set
before Sanchez-Vicario closed the gap to 5-3 by keeping serve twice
and breaking once. Seles finished that set by serving a love game.
	   She now has won 17 of their 20 meetings.
	   The two have met in three finals this year. Sanchez-Vicario beat
Seles for the French Open title, but then lost to her in the Du
Maurier Open final.
	   They also met in Sunday's doubles final, with Seles dominating
the match. She and 17-year-old Russian Anna Kournikova beat
Sanchez-Vicario and American Mary Joe Fernandez 6-4, 6-4, and
shared the winners' prize of dlrs 23,750.
	   It was Kournikova's first victory in any event on the pro tour.
	   In a match with 12 service breaks, only Seles held the majority
of her games, with a 5-1 record.
	   After a quarterfinals day of gusty winds Friday, the Ariake
Colosseum Roof was closed for the semifinals and final because of
rain.

Takanohana wins Autumn Grand Sumo tournament
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Takanohana beat fellow yokozuna (grand champion)
Akebono and won the 15-day Autumn Grand Sumo tournament with a 13-2
record Sunday, as yokozuna Wakanohana suffered his third defeat.
	   In the day's final bout, Takanohana grabbed Akebono's belt, put
his head in the foe's chest and sent him out of the ring at Tokyo's
Ryogoku Kokugikan Sumo Arena. Akebono, or Chad Rowan, finished at
10-5.
	   The win gave the 26-year-old Takanohana his 20th tournament
victory and the second straight grand sumo championship.
	   Takanohana received the winner's trophy from Prime Minister
Keizo Obuchi and also collected the top prize of 10 million yen
(dlrs 74,000).
	   ``I tried to do the best for my fans,'' said Takanohana, who
entered the ring after his elder brother Wakanohana, who tied with
him for the lead on Saturday, was defeated by ozeki (champion)
Musashimaru.
	   Musashimaru bulldozed Wakanohana, handing the yokozuna his third
defeat against 12 victories. Musashimaru, or Fiamalu Penitan from
Hawaii, finished at 11-4.
	   Ozeki Takanonami fought off sekiwake (junior champion)
Chiyotaikai's hand thrusts, grasped his foe's belt and threw him
down to improve to a 10-5 record.
	   Although Chiyotakiai lost his bout, he received his second
technique prize of 2 million yen (dlrs 14,800) for a 9-6 record,
including a victory over Akebono on the ninth day.
	   No. 2 maegashira (senior wrestler) Kotonowaka sent out No. 11
maegashira Ganyu and received his second outstanding performance
award of 2 million yen for a 9-6 record, including victories over
Wakanohana and Takanonami.
	   In other major bouts, komusubi (junior champion) Dejima held on
No. 5 maegashira Kyokushuzan's initial charge of sidestep and
forced him out. Dejima finished at 8-7 and Kyokushuzan, or
Mongolian Batbayar Davaa, at 4-11.
	   Because of his poor record, Kyokushuzan may be demoted from the
present rank before the next tournament in Kyushu beginning Nov. 8.
	   In the 26-member juryo division, just below the senior makuuchi
rank, No. 5-ranked Kyokutenho, or Mongolian Tsevegnyam Nyamjav,
ended at 8-7 as he was beaten by No. 6-ranked Daishi (7-8).
	   No. 13-ranked Hoshitango, or Argentine Imach Marcelo Salomon,
was pulled down by No. 4-ranked Zenshinyama (7-8) for his ninth
victory against six defeats.
	   In the top junior division of Makushita, 20-ranked Wakaazuma, or
Yoshinobu Kuroda from Brazil, crushed No. 16-ranked Yutakafuji and
finished at 5-2.
	   No. 7-ranked Hoshiandesu, or Argentine Jose Antonio Juarez,
ended at 4-3, losing to No. 6-ranked Yachi.
	   In sandanme, the second-highest junior division, No. 6-ranked
Kyokutenzan, or Mongolian Enkhbat Batmunkha, was sent out by No.
9-ranked Sumanofuji for a 4-3 record.
	   Wrestlers in junior divisions had only seven bouts during the
15-day tournament.
	   Meanwhile, the Japan Sumo Association said it accepted
Hawaii-born former ozeki Konishiki's resignation from the JSA
member on Sunday. Konishiki is no longer a stable master and no
longer belongs to the association.
	   Officials declined to provide further details.
	   Konishiki, formerly Salevaa Atisanoe, retired on Nov. 21 last
year after wrestling in Japan for 15 years. Upon retiring he
assumed the name Sanoyama and became a stable master to train young
wrestlers.

Fukushima wins Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MIYAGI, Japan (AP) _ Long-hitting Akiko Fukushima shot a
1-under-par 71 Sunday and won the Miyagi TV Cup Dunlop Ladies Open
by four strokes over two South Koreans _ veteran Ku Ok-hee and
rookie Han Hee-won.
	   Japan's Fukushima, the leading money winner in 1996 and 1997,
offset three bogeys with four birdies, including three straight
from the 14th hole, en route to an 8-under 208 total.
	   The 25-year-old Fukushima, who is planning to join the U.S. tour
next year, was tied at 6-under with her overnight co-leader Ku
before she strung together the three birdies in a row and pulled
away from her rival.
	   ``It's been frustrating until the birdie putt from 5 meters (16
feet) went in on the 14th,'' said Fukushima. ``And I was lucky to
score the birdie on the 16th from 7 meters (23 feet).''
	   Fukushima often hits a 280-yard (250-meter) drive that leaves
her just a wedge shot away from the green on par-4 holes.
	   The victory, Fukushima's second this season and 13th overall,
was worth 10.8 million yen (dlrs 80,200) from a purse of 60 million
yen (dlrs 446,000).
	   Fukushima now stands second on this year's money list with 50.56
million yen (dlrs 375,900).
	   Michiko Hattori, who leads the earnings list so far with 52.57
million yen (dlrs 390,000) and three victories, missed the cut on
Friday.
	   Ku, seeking her second victory of the season and 15th overall in
Japan, shot a final round of 75, having suffered a bogey on the
16th hole and a double bogey on the 17th hole.
	   Former South Korean amateur star Han Hee-won, in her third
tournament after qualifying for the Japan tour in August, posted a
69 to share second place at 4-under 212 with Ku.
	   Han was the low amateur at the 1995 and the 1997 Japan Women's
Opens.
	   The 20-year-old Han, who hails from Seoul, missed the cut in the
Japan LPGA Championship two weeks ago, and tied for eighth in the
Yukijirushi Ladies last week.
	   ``I'm satisfied with today's round partly because I had a good
finish with a birdie on the final hole,'' said Han. ``It's only my
third tournament, so I feel that I still have a long, long way to
go to be somebody.''
	   Kaori Harada had a 71 and was alone in fourth at 213, followed
by Natsuko Noro, who shot the day's best round of 67, and four
others tied for fifth at 214.

Gulf Coast residents prepare for onslaught of Hurricane Georges

	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Forecasters predicted Hurricane Georges would
begin lashing the Gulf Coast with hurricane force winds Sunday, and
more than a million residents have been told to evacuate.
	   ``This is kind of like looking down the barrel of a shotgun and
hoping it turns,'' said Louisiana State Police Lt. Col. Ronnie
Jones.
	   Georges ripped slowly but furiously through the Caribbean,
killing more than 300 people before it smashed into the Florida
Keys with winds over 100 mph (160 kilometers).
	   Forecasters said Sunday the storm may strengthen before it makes
landfall, pushing tides up to 15 feet (4.5 meters) above normal.
	   While New Orleans is protected by 130 miles (210 kilometers) of
levees, city officials worried that Lake Pontchartrain and Lake
Maurepas could spill over their banks and send flood waters into
the city and its suburbs.
	   At 5 a.m. EDT (0900 GMT) Sunday, Georges was centered about 200
miles (320 kilometers) southeast of New Orleans, moving northwest
at 10 mph (16 kph) with 110 mph (177 kph) winds.
	   Hurricane warnings were posted along 330 miles (530 kilometers)
of coast from Morgan City, Louisiana, to Panama City, Florida.
Hurricane watches were posted on the flanks of the warning area
east to St. Marks, Florida, and west to Intracoastal City,
Louisiana.
	   More than 1.5 million people were ordered or urged to leave New
Orleans and low-lying coastal areas. Bumper-to-bumper traffic
jammed Interstate 10 out of the city into the early hours Sunday,
and the American Red Cross said it expects to house 35,000 evacuees
in dozens of shelters around Louisiana.
	   Thousands more were told to leave coastal sections of
Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida Panhandle.
	   Mike McCarty and his wife said they didn't feel safe waiting for
a flight scheduled to take them home to Columbus, Ohio, on Sunday
afternoon.
	   ``We decided it would be best to just rent a car and drive
home,'' he said Saturday night at New Orleans International
Airport. ``We're getting out of Dodge.''
	   The center of the storm was expected to reach the mouth of the
Mississippi River, about 75 miles (120 kilometers) southeast of New
Orleans, sometime between Sunday and Monday afternoon. When its
hits, the storm could have strengthened into a Category 3 storm
with winds at 111 mph (179 kph) or greater.
	   ``It could wreak havoc,'' said Paul Trotter of the National
Weather Service. ``A slow-moving, Category 3 storm would give us
some high tides, heavy winds and lots of rain. When they coexist
all together, that's where we'll get the devastation.''
	   Forecasters said Georges could slow as it neared land, drenching
some areas in Louisiana with up to 20 inches (50 centimeters) of
rain.
	   Emergency officials in Mississippi closed beaches and the 11
casinos on the state's coast. Boats were moved inland, and the
Coast Guard closed the Port of Gulfport to all commercial traffic.

	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Election officials pronounced
Vladivostok's long-delayed mayoral vote valid, despite complaints
that the leading candidate had been stricken from Sunday's ballot
at the last minute.
	   The chaotic election capped a campaign dominated by the bitter
rivalry between city and regional leaders.
	   As voters arrived at some polling stations Sunday morning,
election officials were still scrambling to cross the names of two
disqualified candidates off the ballots: incumbent Mayor Viktor
Cherepkov, the leading candidate, and Vladimir Murashov.
	   A city court ruled Thursday that Cherepkov could not run because
he had illegally paid for his campaign with city money, while
Murashov was barred because of anti-Semitic statements.
	   The commission instructed polling stations to strike both names
from the ballots just six hours before polls were to open.
	   ``Why did they remove Cherepkov? I don't understand. This is a
completely illegal election,'' said Galina Ivanova, an agitated
70-year-old voter who is representative of the mayor's loyal
following of mostly senior citizens.
	   Still, many of Vladivostok's 800,000 residents turned out for
the vote. By late afternoon, 30 percent of voters had cast ballots,
making the election valid, said Ilya Grinchenko, chairman of the
city election commission. Official results were expected on
Tuesday.
	   President Boris Yeltsin's representative in the region, Viktor
Kondratov, and the regional parliament chairman Sergei Dudnik had
appealed to Yeltsin on Saturday to leave Cherepkov on the ballot in
order to prevent unrest, the ITAR-Tass news agency said.
	   Kondratov said Sunday that tensions were building ``because of
unlawful acts ... against the background of deteriorating economic
problems,'' ITAR-Tass reported.
	   Kondratov alleged that the situation was being deliberately
exacerbated so that ``the whole indignant population of (the
region) will take to the streets on Oct. 7, the day of the
All-Russian protest action.''
	   Communists and their hard-line allies, as well as trade unions,
are joining forces to organize the Oct. 7 protests against Yeltsin.
	   Vladivostok's mayoral election has been delayed for months as
Cherepkov has feuded with regional governor Yevgeny Nazdratenko.
Cherepkov's term expired on July 5.
	   The regional government had Cherepkov ousted in 1994, only to
see him reinstated by Yeltsin two years later. The regional
parliament, backed by Nazdratenko, tried to throw out Cherepkov
last September _ again unsuccessfully.
	   Since taking office in 1993, Cherepkov, a former military man,
has launched an energetic campaign to build roads. However, the
city's economy has continued to decline, with doctors, ambulance
workers and teachers on strike.
	   Many of the 14 candidates in the race campaigned on pledges to
restore law and order to the port, where crime and corruption have
soared.

Kournikova wins first title, taking doubles prize with Seles
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Anna Kournikova, the 17-year-old Russian admired
for both her looks and her tennis talent, won her first title on
the pro tour Sunday, joining Monica Seles to win the Toyota
Princess Cup doubles.
	   ``It feels great winning it, especially with Monica. It couldn't
be better,'' said Kournikova, who was paired with the former No. 1
singles player for the first time.
	   They won 6-4, 6-4 in the final against two players who have
well-established doubles reputations, although with other partners
_ Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario and Mary Joe Fernandez. Sanchez-Vicario
has shared in 55 WTA tour doubles titles and Fernandez in 19.
	   Kournikova, currently 14th in the singles rankings, had reached
three other finals this year but lost in all _ two doubles paired
with Larisa Neiland and a singles against Venus Williams.
	   In this week's tournament, for which she was the poster girl,
she lost in the singles quarterfinals to Sanchez-Vicario, the
eventual runner-up to Seles.
	   For the doubles title, she shared dlrs 23,750 with Seles, and
each received a new car.
	   Since Seles plays less doubles, Kournikova was asked which
player led in deciding strategy.
	   ``Sometimes one person leads. If one person is down, the other
helps. We really helped each other,'' she replied.
	   Seles agreed, adding, ``It was 50-50 in saying what to do.''
	   The pressure of a final made Sunday's match more difficult,
Seles said.
	   ``We're still finding out what each other's habits are in the
game. Once we do that we can keep improving,'' she said.
	   The pair planned to join for doubles again in Moscow next month,
she added.

	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ Some 40 people were
injured in an explosion at a cafeteria in the center of this
popular Mediterranean island town Sunday, police said.
	   It was not immediately known what caused the blast although news
reports cited firefighters as saying it may have been due to a gas
leak.
	   The explosion at the Gran Cafe Capuccino on Palma's Paseo
Maritimo sea-front avenue occurred shortly before 12 a.m. (1000
gmt) completely destroying the premise's front terraces, the
national news agency Efe said.

Efe said.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties won enough seats
in two-day national elections to be able to oust Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar if they join forces as pledged, according to
unofficial results released Sunday.
	   The results, based on full but unofficial tallies from all 5,000
precincts in Slovakia, may signal the end of the authoritarian rule
that has dominated this country throughout its nearly six years of
independence.
	   The Central Election Commission, which released the figures
Sunday morning, said they should remain virtually unchanged when
official results are released Tuesday.
	   Meciar's hard-line nationalist ruling party, the Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia, finished ahead of all other 16 parties with 27
percent of the vote, based on the unofficial results. That would
give it 43 seats in the 150-seat Parliament.
	   But the top opposition party, the Slovak Democratic Coalition,
was right behind it _ leading a strong showing by four opposition
parties with 26.3 percent and 42 seats.
	   Two other opposition parties came next. The Party of the
Democratic Left _ former communists turned Social Democrats _ got
14.7 percent to earn 23 seats. The Hungarian Coalition Party,
representing Slovakia's largest minority ethnic group, had 9.1
percent for 15 seats.
	   A fourth party that has declared its intent to join in an
opposition alliance _ the six-month-old Party of Civic
Understanding, led by the popular mayor of Kosice, Slovakia's
second-largest city _ got 8 percent for 13 seats.
	   If confirmed by official results, that would give the opposition
forces 93 deputies in Parliament, which selects both the prime
minister and the president.
	   Meciar's weakened HZDS, which fared much better in the last
elections in 1994, appears to have only potential ally among the
six parties who received the minimum 5 percent required for
Parliament seats. The far-right Slovak National Party, its main
partner in the current ruling coalition, got 9 percent for 13
seats.
	   The HZDS' other coalition partner, the Slovak Workers'
Association, failed to get 5 percent, according to the unofficial
results.
	   Opposition parties already had proclaimed victory and celebrated
with champagne Saturday, based on similar exit poll numbers and a
sampling of unofficial results. They scheduled talks later Sunday
to try to seal their alliance and form a governing majority.
	   Commentators in neighboring countries welcomed the prospect of
change in Slovakia.
	   ``The result means a fundamental change of the political
situation in Slovakia,'' speaker of the Czech parliament, Vaclav
Klaus, said. ``The decision was up to the voters, and they decided
well.''
	   In Hungary, a senior official in the foreign ministry, Zsolt

the rights of the country's minorities _ notably the Hungarians _
so that Slovakia ``can return to the road leading to the European
integration.''

Clashing soccer fans kill at least two in Bangladesh
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Frenzied fans clashed and fired
gunshots during a soccer match, killing at least two people and
injuring 40 others in a tribal area in Bangladesh, an official said
Sunday.
	   The military was called in as the fighting spread to the streets
of Dighinala, a township 175 kilometers (110 miles) southeast of
Dhaka, on Sunday.
	   The clash erupted 12 minutes before the final whistle as one of
the teams took a 2-0 lead. Two tribal youths died of bullet wounds,
the official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The relatives of those killed said the deaths were caused by
police, a charge denied by the government.
	   Police said they used wooden sticks to disperse the clashing
tribal and non-tribal groups.

Tuberculosis killing lions ``like flies'' at Kruger wild game park
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) _ Lions at Kruger National Park,
the famed tourist attraction, are dying of tuberculosis so
widespread and severe that the entire population is at risk, the
Sunday Times reported.
	   Lions catch the incurable disease, to which they have no natural
resistance, from infected buffalo, scientists said. It weakens and
emaciates them, leading to death.
	   ``Lions are dying like flies'' and every one could be dead
within 10 years, Dr. Johan Krige, deputy director of the Department
of Agriculture, was quoted as saying in Sunday's front-page
article.
	   Lions tested in the southern part of the 10,000 square kilometer
(4,000 sq. mile) wild game park, located about four hours' drive
from Johannesburg, showed an infection rate of 90 percent.
Scientists said most of those would die.
	   Park officials were considering isolating the lions by
constructing a fence dividing the park in two _ or killing infected
animals to try and protect healthy ones.
	   Tests show that herds of buffalo are infected with TB, which
also has been diagnosed in cheetah, baboons and kudu.
	   A recent study of lions disclosed there are only about 12 left
in an sprawling area of the park that was home to at least twice
that many in 1995, and 67 in 1974. Scientists said the most likely
cause of death was TB.
	   In neighboring parts of the park, 34 emaciated lions tested in
1995 showed that 29 were terminally ill with TB. In another area,
32 of 33 lions tested were infected.

Australian state ordered to switch off gas as fire threat
</HEADLINE>
continues &QL; 
 &UR; EDS: RECASTS; UPDATES thruout with factory shutdowns, hospitals
affected, other details &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Natural gas supplies to Australia's
second most populous state were crippled Sunday after a series of
explosions at the state of Victoria's largest gas plant.
	   At least five explosions and several fires ripped through the
Esso plant on Friday near Sale, about 110 miles (180 km) east of
Melbourne, killing two men and injuring eight others.
	   The blaze was extinguished late Sunday, but not before it had
extensively damaged the 29-year-old facility and some pipes to two
other gas plants.
	   Robert Olsen, a managing director at Esso _ an affiliate of
Exxon Corp., said experts, including 12 flown in from overseas,
have been given the task of trying to restore supplies and
determine the cause of the accident.
	   ``Our focus is entirely on restoring gas production at this
time,'' Olsen said Sunday. ``This is a very difficult matter; it
was a serious accident.''
	   The damaged plant supplies 80 percent of Victoria's gas. About
1.4 million homes and businesses were ordered to turn off their gas
meters after the state's supply authority, VENCorp, ordered the
shutdown of the state's system.
	   The blast has shut down of factories, forced hospitals to cancel
elective surgery and led to warnings that nearby residents may be
without gas for cooking and water heaters for at least a week.
	   Only three areas of the state which receive gas from a different
source are unaffected.
	   David Whiting, director of the Australia Industry Group in
Victoria, said the range of businesses affected was massive,
ranging from major industries such as carmakers and breweries to
small companies using heat to make ceramics, office equipment or
cement.
	   ``It is too early to put any real price on it, but we are
talking hundreds of millions ( of dollars in losses),'' Whiting
said.
	   Car manufacturers Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. said
Sunday that they had asked a combined 4,600 workers not to show up
for work on Monday. Another 3,000 workers could be affected on
Tuesday.
	   Electrical retailers were besieged Sunday by people snapping up
electrical cooking appliances such as kettles and electric frying
pans.
	   Hospitals which depended on gas to sterilize equipment were
moving to diesel and electricity as alternative sources of power,
Health Minister Rob Knowles said. Most would continue to handle
emergency cases but many had suspended elective surgery, he said.
	   And lawyers have already begun talking about suing the gas
supplier.
	   ``This could be the largest class action in Australian
history,'' involving every Victorian gas consumer, said Nick
Styant-Browne of law firm Slater and Gordon.
	   Victorian Premier Jeff Kennett said a judicial inquiry may be
held into what caused the problem.
	   ``We have not had an incident like this ever before ... this is
going to cost hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars and that
is regrettable, but there is just nothing anyone can do about it,''
Kennett said.
	   If the gas supply grid empties and has to be shut down, it will
take weeks to clear air and water from the pipes and restart the
grid, VENCorp said.
	   Gas from neighboring New South Wales state was being fed into
Victoria's grid in an effort to keep it open, and was supplying
about 10 percent of normal requirements, the company said.
	   Police named the two dead men Sunday as maintenance supervisors
John Francis Lowery and Peter Wilson.

Fighting kills at least 49 combatants in northern Sri Lanka
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: This copy was submitted to the Sri Lankan military censor but
no changes were made &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOMBO, Sri Lanka (AP) _ In a battle to control a strategic
highway, at least 49 combatants were killed in fighting between
government soldiers and Tamil Tiger rebels in northern Sri Lanka on
Sunday, the military said.
	   The dead included 40 rebels and nine soldiers in the fiercest
fighting in the past two months, the military said. There was no
immediate statement by the guerrillas.
	   The rebels attacked soldiers manning defense lines near
Paranthan, a town 280 kilometers (175 miles) north of Colombo, the
Sri Lankan capital.
	   ``At present, troops are in full control of the situation and
clearing operations are in progress,'' said the military statement,
adding that a large number of rebels also were wounded.
	   Paranthan is close to a 70-kilometer (45 mile) highway passing
through rebel-held territory that the military has been trying to
capture for more than a year. Its control would open a road link to
Jaffna Peninsula, a former rebel stronghold at the northern tip of
Sri Lanka that was captured by the military two years ago.
	   Since then, the government has been airlifting or shipping food
and other supplies to Jaffna's half a million people, an expensive
means of transportation.
	   So far, government troops have captured nearly two-thirds of the
highway, with a 24-kilometer (15-mile) stretch still controlled by
the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam.
	   Rebels among Sri Lanka's 3.3 million Tamils have been fighting a
separatist war since 1983. They accuse the Sinhalese majority of
widespread discrimination in education and jobs. At least 54,000
people have been killed in the fighting.

China Airlines plane forced to abort flight due to engine trouble
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ A China Airlines charter flight carrying
263 passengers made an emergency landing due to engine trouble
detected about ten minutes after the plane took off from Taiwan's
Hsiaokang Airport, the airline said Sunday.
	   Passengers on the flight bound for the northern Japanese city of
Sapporo were transferred to another Airbus A300 and departed the
airport in southern Kaohsiung city later Sunday, said company
official Chen Chih-cheng.
	   Incomplete burning of jet fuel in one or both engines was
thought to be responsible for the problem, the airline said.
	   Passengers told reporters that they smelled fuel in the cabin
before the plane took off, and said the engines made an abnormal
noise during the brief flight.
	   On Saturday, another China Airlines aircraft made an emergency

Suspect in French bank heist caught by Cambodian police
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PHNOM PENH, Cambodia (AP) _ Cambodian police said Sunday they
have arrested a leading suspect in a recent robbery of the local
branch office of French bank Credit Agricole-Indosuez.
	   Him Samai, 23, a security guard at the bank, was apprehended by
police Friday in the central province of Kompong Cham, according to
senior municipal police official Ek Kreth.
	   A bank employee for several years, Him Samai allegedly held up
his co-workers after closing hours on Sept. 1.
	   While ordering bank staffers to hand over bags of cash from the
bank's vault, witnesses said the suspect opened fire and shot the
bank's Filipino-Australian manager, wounding him in the legs.
	   Police said more than dlrs 300,000 was taken in the heist. It
was not clear, however, if any of the stolen cash was recovered.

Seles beats Sanchez-Vicario for title third year in a row
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: CORRECTS to `... never gives up, ...' 7th graf &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Monica Seles beat Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario for the
Toyota Princess Cup title for the third consecutive year Sunday,
again using her firepower to overcome the Spaniard's speed and
wiles.
	   Seles' 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 victory in the 2-hour, 17-minute match left
Sanchez-Vicario with four straight losses in the Toyota finals
after she had won the tournament in 1994. She lost to Mary Pierce
in 1995.
	   Sanchez-Vicario came back from a 3-1 deficit to win the first
set, and threatened to rebound from 3-1 and 5-3 gaps in the third.
But at 30-all in the final game, Seles produced two good serves _
one drawing a miss from Sanchez-Vicario and the other setting up a
vicious forehand crosscourt winner.
	   Seles, seeded second here behind the French Open champion, saved
two break points in the second game _ which she closed out with two
aces _ and two more in the fourth on her way to winning the final
set and the 43rd singles title of her career.
	   This one was worth dlrs 79,000. The loser received dlrs 36,000.
	   ``I felt I played some great tennis at key times but I also at
times let Arantxa back into the match,'' said Seles, ranked No. 6
by the WTA. ``Overall, I'm happy with my fitness _ my movement and
stamina _ but I can't say I'm happy that I didn't get a single drop
shot.
	   ``She's a fighter, she never gives up and she keeps improving,''
Seles added. ``I'm a fighter too, and it brings out the best in
both of us.''
	   Sanchez-Vicario, ranked No. 4, said, ``My serve was probably
less effective than hers. She served better when she needed to.
There were good points, good strategy, but I probably needed a
little more luck. ... Her shots came with the right timing when she
needed them on the line.''
	   In her semifinal victory over Anke Huber, Sanchez-Vicario had
taken a medical timeout after the second set to have the wrist
taped on her hitting arm and said it had helped her strokes in the
final set.
	   In Sunday's final, she said, ``my wrists were tight, but that
was not the difference in the match.''
	   She gained her key break in the first set against No. 6 Seles in
the seventh game, coming back from 40-15. She gained her third
deuce thanks to a reflex lob off a Seles overhead, and then won on
two misses by her opponent.
	   But Seles charged back, taking a 5-0 lead in the second set
before Sanchez-Vicario closed the gap to 5-3 by keeping serve twice
and breaking once. Seles finished that set by serving a love game.
	   She now has won 17 of their 20 meetings.
	   The two have met in three finals this year. Sanchez-Vicario beat
Seles for the French Open title, but then lost to her in the Du
Maurier Open final.
	   They also met in Sunday's doubles final, with Seles dominating
the match. She and 17-year-old Russian Anna Kournikova beat
Sanchez-Vicario and American Mary Joe Fernandez 6-4, 6-4, and
shared the winners' prize of dlrs 23,750.
	   It was Kournikova's first victory in any event on the pro tour.
	   In a match with 12 service breaks, only Seles held the majority
of her games, with a 5-1 record.
	   After a quarterfinals day of gusty winds Friday, the Ariake
Colosseum Roof was closed for the semifinals and final because of
rain.

Cathay Pacific to start servicing Philippine domestic routes

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Cathay Pacific Airways will begin
flying domestic routes in the Philippines on Monday to fill a
vacuum left by the closure of flag-carrier Philippine Airlines,
officials said Sunday.
	   David Turnbull, Cathay Pacific's chief executive officer,
announced the move and said his Hong Kong-based company also has an
interest in buying a stake in Philippine Airlines if it is put up
for sale.
	   No formal takeover talks have begun, but Turnbull said he did
meet recently with Lucio Tan, PAL's chairman and chief stockholder.
	   ``We do have some interest in PAL in the long run,'' he said.
	   PAL's closure last Wednesday left many areas of the sprawling
Philippine archipelago without air service, and officials have been
struggling to bridge the gap to avoid serious damage to the
economy.
	   In talks Sunday at the home of Philippine President Joseph
Estrada, Turnbull agreed that as a first step in reinstating
nationwide service two Cathay Pacific planes and crews will be
leased to PNB Holdings, a unit of Philippine National Bank, which
is partially owned by the government.
	   The flights will nominally be operated by PNB Holdings since
Philippine law prohibits foreign carriers from servicing domestic
routes.
	   One plane will begin flights between Manila and the central city
of Cebu on Monday, airline officials said. A second is to begin
flying later in the week. Additional planes may be added later if
they are needed, they said.
	   ``We are doing it at cost,'' Turnbull said. ``This is being done
at very short notice, and it's a temporary arrangement.''
	   Estrada called the agreement ``a good development in order to
fill the vacuum left by PAL.''
	   At least three smaller Philippine domestic carriers have said
they plan to expand their operations in response to PAL's closure,
and air force planes are helping carry vital cargo, including mail,
medicine and newspapers, officials said.
	   PAL shut down after a union representing ground personnel
refused to accept a management-proposed rehabilitation plan in
which workers would have received 20 percent of the airline's stock
in exchange for a 10-year suspension of their collective bargaining
agreement.
	   Government labor officials are continuing to try to reconcile
differences between the two sides, Estrada said.
	   On Saturday, union leaders offered not to strike for 10 years
and to accept cuts in various benefits as long as their current
grievance mechanisms were maintained.
	   A committee formed by Manila's Securities and Exchange
Commission is also studying whether there is a chance of reopening
the carrier, which has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1
billion in debts to domestic and international creditors.
	   Estrada says the government is unable to take over PAL because
there is no money in public coffers to underwrite daily losses of
up to 45 million pesos (dlrs 1 million) incurred by the airline.
	   Both PAL and Cathay Pacific have been hit hard by Asia's
currency crisis, which has reduced passenger volume. PAL had
launched a dlrs 4 billion modernization and refleeting program
shortly before the crisis hit.
	   The Philippine flag carrier also was badly hurt by labor
disputes, including a 22-day pilots' strike in June.

	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ Some 40 people were
injured in an explosion at a cafeteria in the center of this
popular Mediterranean island town Sunday, police said.
	   It was not immediately known what caused the blast although news
reports cited firefighters as saying it may have been due to a gas
leak.
	   The explosion at the Gran Cafe Capuccino on Palma's Paseo
Maritimo sea-front avenue occurred shortly before 12 a.m. (1000
gmt), completely destroying the premise's front terraces, the
national news agency EFE said.
	   At least two people were believed to be trapped inside the cafe,
EFE said.

Non-governmental organizations lobby against nuclear power
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Representatives of 48 environmental
organizations ended a three-day conference Sunday with an appeal
for the European Union to pressure would-be members in Eastern
Europe to phase out nuclear power as a condition of EU membership.
	   In an open letter, the delegates to the Global 2000 conference
urged the London-based European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development to reject the Ukraine's request to finance construction
of two new nuclear reactors to replace those at Chernobyl.
	   The bank indicated last year that it would finance completion of
the reactors, but it has delayed a final decision due to concerns
about the safety and financial soundness of the project and doubts
that the projected dlrs 1.2 billion loan will be repaid.
	   An organizer of the conference, Patricia Lorenz, said that in
the coming year, the EU must raise nuclear issues during membership
talks with Eastern European countries.
	   ``Now it is especially important to speak with one voice'' on
the issue, she said.
	   Lorenz said the non-governmental organizations oppose any
attempt to accept lower nuclear security and environmental
standards for Eastern European applicants.
	   ``We will mount a massive lobbying effort in the European
Parliament in this regard,'' she said.
	   In a 1995 agreement with the Group of Seven industrialized
countries, Ukraine pledged to close the Chernobyl plant by 2000 in
exchange for international aid.
	   The plant, north of Kiev, was the scene of the world's worst
nuclear accident, in 1986.
	   Ukraine's president, Leonid Kuchma, has said his country would
not be able to close down Chernobyl unless the G-7 finances
completion of the Khmelnitsky and Rovno nuclear plants, which are
90 percent complete.

	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ A gas explosion
destroyed a packed cafeteria in the center of this popular
Mediterranean island town Sunday, injuring up to 40 people, three
seriously, police said.
	   The explosion at the Gran Cafe Capuccino on Palma's Paseo
Maritimo sea-front avenue occurred shortly before 12 a.m. (1000

said.
	   He said only three of the injured were in serious condition, the
majority suffering cuts and bruises. There were no details on the
nationalities or identities of the injured.
	   The spokesman said earlier reports that two people trapped
inside the cafe proved to be untrue.
	   The Balearic island of Mallorca is one of Europe's and the

Sudan braces for major battle at southern capital Juba
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By MOHAMED OSMAN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) _ Sudan's president, Lt. Gen. Omar
el-Bashir, paid a surprise visit to the strategic town of Juba in
Equatoria province and warned of a major battle to keep the town in
government hands.
	   The visit Saturday came 10 days after Sudanese rebels claimed
they had captured the garrison town of Liria, 72 kilometers (45
miles) southeast of Juba, and two smaller army outposts.
	   Meanwhile, Ibrahim Ahmed Omar, the minister of higher education,
suspended classes at Sudanese universities for one month to enable
the students to take part in the fighting. An exception was made
for all-women universities.
	   After the Sudan People's Liberation Army rebel group claimed
Liria, el-Bashir's government said it had repulsed the attack and
accused Ugandan troops of involvement.
	   ``This is the final battle,'' state-run Sudan television quoted
el-Bashir as saying at Juba. ``They (the SPLA and the Ugandans)
have brought the best they have to this battlefield. They wanted it
to be the final, and they will have it.''
	   He added: ``We call on all young men in Sudan to take part in
this lofty deed, to take part in this battle.''
	   El-Bashir was accompanied by his defense minister, Maj. Gen.
Ibrahim Suleiman, on the trip to Juba, which is 1,200 kilometers
(740 miles) south of the capital Khartoum.
	   The education minister, dressed in military fatigues, told state
television on Saturday that ``as the rebels and the enemies have
massed all their forces, we are massing, too.
	   He said volunteers from the universities would be taken to the
front Sunday and Monday.
	   The government has long used volunteers in a paramilitary force
that fights alongside the army.
	   On Sunday, civilians in Khartoum were seen flocking to blood
donation centers set up by the government and various social
organizations.
	   The Sudanese army claimed Friday that 400 rebels and 50 Ugandan
troops were killed in two weeks of fighting near Juba.
	   Sudan did not report how many casualties it suffered, saying
only that the number was insignificant.
	   El-Bashir's allegation of Ugandan involvement was the latest
claim by Sudan that neighboring Uganda has sent troops to fight
with southern Sudanese rebels involved in a 15-year civil war.
Uganda has repeated denied it.
	   Uganda borders Sudan in the south, and each country has accused
the other of supporting rebels within its borders.
	   The SPLA, which is seeking autonomy for the south's Christians
and adherents of tribal faiths from the Muslim, Arab-led north, has
long seen capturing Juba as crucial to its campaign.

	   A summary of late news from The Associated Press. Some items
have moved on this circuit in expanded form with ``i'' or ``f''
category codes:
	   NEW ORLEANS (AP) _ Forecasters predicted Hurricane Georges would
begin lashing the Gulf Coast with hurricane force winds Sunday, and
more than a million residents have been told to evacuate. Georges
ripped slowly but furiously through the Caribbean, killing more
than 300 people before it smashed into the Florida Keys with winds
over 100 mph (160 kilometers). Forecasters said Sunday the storm
may strengthen before it makes landfall, pushing tides up to 15
feet (4.5 meters) above normal. While New Orleans is protected by
130 miles (210 kilometers) of levees, city officials worried that
Lake Pontchartrain and Lake Maurepas could spill over their banks
and send flood waters into the city and its suburbs.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After one of the tightest races in postwar
Germany, voters Sunday choose a chancellor to shepherd Europe's
largest nation through historic changes: the government's move back
to Berlin, and the switch from the trusted German mark to the euro,
Europe's common currency. Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 68, who merged
communist East Germany with the West in 1990, is seeking an
unprecedented fifth term after 16 years in office. His appeal is
stability and his clout with world powers at a time of economic
turmoil in Russia and conflict in the Balkans. His challenger,
Gerhard Schroeder, 54, has campaigned as the voice of change,
appealing to Germans who feel the nation has stagnated under Kohl,
the West's longest-serving leader. (GERMANY-ELECTION)
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Laying the groundwork for President Bill
Clinton's Mideast peacemaking, Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright hoped Saturday to persuade Yasser Arafat to put his drive
for Palestinian statehood into low gear. ``Our view is that it
would be a mistake and not helpful for Chairman Arafat to make a
unilateral statement'' that he intends to set up a state on the
West Bank and in Gaza, said the State Department spokesman, James
P. Rubin. Arafat and the secretary met one-on-one. Rubin said
Albright hoped to seal a deal on at least some key points with
Arafat and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on a West Bank
agreement, raising the prospect of a partial accord that Clinton
could announce next week.
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties won enough seats
in national elections to be able to oust Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar if they join forces as pledged, according to unofficial
results released Sunday. The results, based on full but unofficial
tallies from all 5,000 precincts in Slovakia, may signal the end of
the authoritarian rule that has dominated this country throughout
its nearly six years of independence. Commentators in neighboring
countries welcomed the results. In Hungary, a senior official in
the foreign ministry, Zsolt Nemeth, said whatever government
emerges in Bratislava must respect the rights of the country's
minorities _ notably the Hungarians _ so that Slovakia ``can return
to the road leading to the European integration.''

	   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO troops arrested a
former Bosnian Serb police chief indicted by the international war
crimes court for murder, rape and other crimes during the 1992-1995
Bosnian War, officials announced Sunday. Stevan Todorovic was
apprehended without incident in the northern Bosnian town of
Bosanski Samac, about 70 kms (44 miles) northwest of here, a NATO
statement said. A NATO source in Sarajevo, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said the troops who made the arrest were Americans,
although there was no official confirmation. The operation took
place a few hours before U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
arrived in Bosnia for a one-day visit.Todorovic is the ninth
indicted suspect to be picked up in Bosnia by NATO forces and
becomes the 26th suspect in custody out of 58 suspects indicted.

Angered by U.S.-brokered Iraqi Kurd pact, Turkey restores
</HEADLINE>
diplomatic ties with Iraq &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Iraq's charge d'affaires in Ankara on
Sunday welcomed Turkey's decision to restore full diplomatic
affairs, after nearly six years of all-but-frozen relations between
the neighbors.
	   Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit announced Saturday that Turkey was
sending an ambassador to Baghdad. Iraq's own ambassador to Ankara
left last year for what Iraqi charge d'affaires T. Hamandi said was
administrative reasons, rather than political; Hamani did not say
whether Iraq's ambassador would return.
	   ``It is a step in the right direction,'' Hamandi said Sunday of
Turkey's initiative.
	   Relations between the two countries have been helped by their
common worry about two Iraqi Kurdish groups. Both countries oppose
a U.S.-brokered pact that the two groups signed Sept. 17 ending
their rivalry in northern Iraq, which the groups have controlled
since Western allies set up a haven for Iraqi Kurds after the 1991
Gulf War.
	   In the past, disputes over Turkey's close ties with the United
States, water resources and the de factor Iraqi Kurd autonomous
zone have all served to sour relations between Turkey and Iraq.
	   Turkey, like Iraq, strongly opposes creation of an independent
Kurdish state in northern Iraq. Turkey fears that would encourage
the aspirations of Turkish Kurdish rebels, which are fighting for
autonomy within Turkey.
	   The Sept. 17 pact in Washington between the Iraqi Kurdish
groups, the Kurdish Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of
Kurdistan, unites them in the common goal of establishing an
elected government by summer 1999.
	   On Saturday, Ecevit said the deal threatened Iraq's territorial
unity.
	   ``It has been understood that the final goal is a federation
through a fait accompli,'' the Turkish official said.
	   Ecevit also warned that Turkey would reject any restrictions on
pursuing its security interests in northern Iraq. Turkey launches
frequent offensives into northern Iraq to hunt Turkish Kurds, who
use the region as a base for attacks in Turkey.
	   In the Washington accord, the Iraqi Kurdish groups committed
themselves to fighting the Turkish Kurd rebels _ an apparent
attempt to soothe and appease Turkey.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After one of the tightest races in postwar
Germany, voters on Sunday elect a chancellor to shepherd Europe's
largest nation through historic changes: the government's move back
to Berlin, and the switch from the trusted German mark to the euro,
Europe's common currency.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 68, who merged communist East Germany
with the West in 1990, is seeking an unprecedented fifth term after
16 years in office. His appeal is stability and his clout with
world powers at a time of economic turmoil in Russia and ongoing
conflict in the Balkans.
	   His challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, 54, has campaigned as the
voice of change, appealing to Germans who feel the nation has
stagnated under Kohl, the West's longest-serving leader.
	   Kohl voted with his wife, Hannelore, in his Rhine River hometown
of Oggersheim after attending Mass Sunday morning.
	   ``I'm very pleased with how the campaign has gone,'' Kohl told
around 100 reporters and photographers who trailed his limousine
from church to the polling station.
	   Schroeder cast his ballot in Hanover, capital of Lower Saxony
state, which he governs. After voting, he and his wife, Doris, both
confessed to a case of nerves.
	   ``I'm doing well,'' Schroeder told reporters. ``I won't deny
that I'm a little anxious.''
	   Both candidates were expected at their parties' headquarters in
Bonn later Sunday to watch the election results come in after polls
close at 6 p.m. (1400 gmt).

Despite NATO threats of intervention, violence rages on in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian forces have launched a new
offensive in southern Kosovo against armed ethnic Albanian rebels
who apparently regrouped in the area, Serb and Albanian sources
said Sunday.
	   A police source speaking on condition of anonymity said a number
of police units, including specially trained elite troops, have
begun a mop-up operation aimed at purging the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army from the area some 45 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of the province's capital Pristina.
	   The latest action followed a strong Serb offensive against KLA
rebels in another area _ Drenica _ located northwest of here. That
offensive came as the U.N. Security Council demanded an end to the
Serb crackdown and NATO finalized plans for airstrikes if unless
the fighting stops.
	   The separatists had suffered defeats in southern Kosovo earlier
this year, but apparently regrouped. According to the police
sources, the rebels recently kidnapped two local Serbs, a
25-year-old and a teenager, which prompted the new action.
	   In Kosovo, a province of Serbia, ethnic Albanians outnumber
Serbs 9 to 1 and nearly all demand independence. Hundreds have died
and about quarter of a million have become displaced since the
fighting erupted earlier this year.
	   The Kosovo Information Center, close to ethnic Albanian
pro-independence leaders, said seven Albanian-populated villages in
southern Kosovo were showered with grenade fire early Sunday, with
Serbian infantry gradually advancing toward them.
	   An estimated 15,000 civilians have begun evacuating there.
	   The Serbian troops are by far stronger militarily than the
rebels but are stretched thin in Kosovo's rugged countryside. The
Serbs have had trouble maintaining control over the areas from
which they drive out the rebels, mostly local farmers recruited by
the KLA.
	   The Serb Media Center said three policemen were killed Saturday
and seven on Friday. Five of the seven died when their car hit a
land mine.
	   The continued violence in Kosovo has led Western powers to
threat Milosevic with a NATO intervention in Kosovo unless violence
ends. The alliance has finalized plans to hit strategic targets
throughout Serbia, the dominant republic of present-day Yugoslavia.
	   U.S. Defense Secretary, William Cohen, at a Saturday meeting
with several European counterparts in neighboring Macedonia,
reiterated the warning, saying ``We should take action sooner
rather than later in the event that Mr. Milosevic doesn't
respond.''
	   While Milosevic has agreed in principle to grant a degree of
autonomy to Kosovo, his forces continue to battle the
``terrorists'' and deem NATO threats unjustified.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties won enough seats
in two-day national elections to oust Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar if they join forces as pledged, according to unofficial
results released Sunday.
	   The results, based on full but unofficial tallies, may signal
the end of the authoritarian rule that has dominated this country
throughout its nearly six years of independence.
	   Proclaiming victory, opposition parties planned to meet later
Sunday to try to seal their informal alliance and put together a
majority coalition in Parliament, which elects both the prime
minister and the president.
	   ``The opposition won the elections,'' said Milan Ftacnik, deputy
chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left. ``The HZDS (ruling
party) is not going to buy out anybody.''
	   The Central Election Commission, which released the figures the
day after parliamentary elections ended Saturday, said they should
remain virtually unchanged when official results are released
Tuesday. It said turnout was a record 84 percent.
	   Meciar's hard-line nationalist ruling party, the Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia, finished ahead of all other 16 parties with 27
percent of the vote, based on the unofficial results. That would
give it 43 seats in the 150-seat Parliament.
	   But the top opposition party, the Slovak Democratic Coalition,
was right behind _ leading a strong showing by four opposition
parties with 26.3 percent and 42 seats.
	   Two other opposition parties came next. The Party of the
Democratic Left _ former communists turned Social Democrats _ got
14.7 percent to earn 23 seats. The Hungarian Coalition Party,
representing Slovakia's largest minority ethnic group, had 9.1
percent for 15 seats.
	   A fourth party that has declared its intent to join in an
opposition alliance _ the six-month-old Party of Civic
Understanding, led by the popular mayor of Kosice, Slovakia's
second-largest city _ got 8 percent for 13 seats.
	   If confirmed by official results, opposition forces would have
93 deputies in Parliament, more than the three-fifths majority
needed to vote for a president.
	   Meciar's weakened HZDS, which fared much better in the last
elections in 1994, appears to have only one potential ally among
the six parties who received the minimum 5 percent required for
Parliament seats. The far-right Slovak National Party, its main
partner in the current ruling coalition, got 9 percent for 13
seats.
	   The HZDS' other coalition partner, the Slovak Workers'
Association, failed to get 5 percent, according to the unofficial
results.
	   Opposition parties already had proclaimed victory and celebrated
with champagne Saturday, based on similar exit poll numbers and a
sampling of unofficial results. They scheduled talks later Sunday
to try to seal their alliance and form a governing majority.
	   Officials in the neighboring Czech Republic and Hungary welcomed
the prospect of change in Slovakia.
	   ``The result means a fundamental change of the political
situation in Slovakia,'' said the speaker of Czech Parliament,
Vaclav Klaus. ``The decision was up to the voters, and they decided
well.''
	   But the political demise of Meciar, whose anti-democratic
practices have left Slovakia diplomatically isolated in Central
Europe, is not yet certain.
	   Meciar has promised to accept the results, but rumors still
swirled Sunday that authorities might try something out of
desperation to stay in power, including invalidating the election
or meddling with the results, as international human rights groups
have warned.
	   Officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which monitored voting at 1,700 polling stations, said
``the election as such was carried out in an apparently correct and
acceptable manner.'' But they said they could not assess whether it
was free and fair until final official results were published and
carried out.
	   If it is the top vote-getting party, the HZDS would be given
first chance to try to put together another governing coalition.
Even though its prospects for finding allies are bleak because of
strong anti-Meciar sentiments, political jockeying and posturing
began as soon as the voting ended.
	   Leaders of the Party of the Democratic Left denounced the ruling
party's suggestions the two might cooperate in a ruling coalition,
saying they would never work with the HZDS.

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Australia, the host nation for the
Sydney 2000 Olympic Games, finished atop the medal count Sunday
when the Sydney Harbor Regatta for Olympic sailing classes ended a
week-long run.
	   The regatta, the first test event conducted by the Sydney
Organizing Committee for the Olympic Games (SOCOG), saw Australian
sailors take two gold medals, three silver and two bronze medals
while New Zealand and Germany also won two gold medals each.
	   Chris Nicholson, a champion sailor from the Sydney 18-footers
and his new crew, Ed Smyth, out sailed a world-ranked fleet to win
the gold medal in the 49er class, the new Olympic skiff class.
	   Darren Bundock and John Forbes won the gold medal in the Tornado
catamaran class, regaining the overall lead in the final race from
Australia's Atlanta silver medalists, Mitch Booth and Andrew
Landenberger, who won the silver.
	   With other silver medals to Lars Kleppich in the Mistral
sailboard class for men and to Sarah Blanck in the Europe dinghy
for women, plus bronze medals to Jessica Crisp in the Mistral
sailboard class for women and Michael Blackburn in the Laser class,
Australia was the top nation in the regatta.
	   Despite light winds which saw the start of racing Sunday delayed
between two and three hours, race management said each of the 10
classes sailed all of its scheduled races for the regatta.
	   Other gold medal winners were Sweden's Fredrik Loof in the Finn
single-handed dinghies for men, Germany's Atlanta gold medalist
Jochen Schuemann and his crew in the Soling keelboat match racing
and Germany's Nicola Birkner and Wibke Buelle in the 470
double-handed class for women.
	   Portugal's Alvaro Marinho and Miguel Nunes won in the 470
double-handed class for men.
	   Competition manager Glenn Bourke said the regatta was a good
test for 2000.
	   ``It was beyond our expectations from an organizational point of
view,'' said Bourke. ``The weather gave the sailors a variety of
challenging conditions.'' (djp)

	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ A gas explosion
destroyed a packed cafeteria in the center of this popular
Mediterranean island town Sunday, injuring up to 40 people, three
seriously.
	   The explosion at the Gran Cafe Capuccino on Palma's Paseo
Maritimo sea-front avenue occurred shortly before 12 a.m. (1000
gmt), sending tables and glass flying in all directions and
wrecking the premise's front terrace, a Municipal Police spokesman
said.
	   There were no details on the nationalities or identities of the
injured. Most suffered only cuts and bruises, but three were in
serious condition. Earlier reports that two people were trapped
inside the cafe proved unfounded.
	   The Balearic island of Mallorca is one of Europe's top tourist
destinations.

Belly dancer's bid to sue Egyptian ambassador rejected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ An Israeli court, citing diplomatic
immunity, ruled Sunday that an Israeli belly dancer cannot sue the
Egyptian ambassador, whom she accuses of sexual assault.
	   The dancer, Shlomit Shalom, accused Ambassador Mohammed
Bassiouny of sexually attacking her in August 1997, but police said
there was no supporting evidence.
	   Bassiouny denied the charge and accused the dancer of
harassment.
	   Shalom then submitted a civil action seeking 1 million shekels
(dlrs 286,000) in damages to the Tel Aviv Magistrates Court. She
said her reputation had been ruined and she no longer received
offers of work.
	   Her lawyer, Nitzana Darshan-Leitner, said Bassiouny's alleged
actions were not covered by diplomatic immunity, but Attorney
General Eliakim Rubinstein argued that it did apply. The judge,
Avraham Tal, agreed.
	   Darshan-Leitner said her client would appeal.

Indonesian academic urges corruption investigators to consult
</HEADLINE>
Internet

<TEXT>
	   JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) _ An Indonesian academic who fled his
homeland after facing accusations of slander against ex-President
Suharto returned to the Southeast Asian nation Sunday and urged the
government to consult Internet websites for details about Suharto's
alleged corruption.
	   Sociology professor George Aditjondro called on investigators to
look up research he has posted on the Internet which allegedly
shows Suharto illegally enriched himself and his family before
stepping down in May.
	   The former leader has flatly denied any wrongdoing and dismissed
the allegations of corruption against him as baseless.
	   But Indonesian Attorney General Andi Muhammad Ghalib has called
on citizens with knowledge about Suharto's wealth to come forward
with any information substantiating the claims of corruption.
	   Aditjondro, who has been teaching at neighboring Australia's
University of Newcastle since his self-imposed exile began in 1995,
made his suggestion after arriving for a weeklong visit to speak at
a pro-democracy conference.
	   The academic left Indonesia after police started an inquiry into
his public criticism of Suharto. During Suharto's autocratic rule
insulting the head of state was regarded as a serious offense and
those convicted of it were often imprisoned.
	   Suharto relinquished his 32-year-long hold on power after riots
and protests shook the world's fourth most populous nation amid its
worst economic crisis in decades.

Australia beats Uzbekistan 5-0, Rafter's knee injury flares up 
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; EDs: changes headline, UPDATES with Rafter injury and pullout from
Grand Slam Cup &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOWNSVILLE, Australia (AP) _ Australia moved back into the top
ranks of Davis Cup tennis on Sunday, but it was Pat Rafter's knee
that was the center of attention.
	   U.S. Open champion Rafter, who has decided to pull out of this
week's Grand Slam Cup in Germany to rest his sore left knee, and
Jason Stoltenberg both breezed through their reverse singles
matches Sunday against Uzbekistan to produce a 5-0 result in the
qualifying tie at the Townsville Entertainment Center.
	   Rafter hardly worked up a sweat in winning 6-2, 6-4 against
395th-ranked Dmitri Tomashevich while Stoltenberg blew away
254th-ranked Oleg Ogorodov 6-3, 6-3.
	   The Australians' win atoned for the humbling first-round home
loss to Zimbabwe at Mildura, Victoria in April and means they will
be one of the top 16 nations to play in the World Group in 1999.
	   With Todd Woodbridge and Mark Woodforde giving Australia an
unbeatable 3-0 lead by beating Ogorodov and Tomashevich in straight
sets Saturday, the main interest in the post-match press conference
turned to Rafter's knee.
	   The injury hampered Rafter during last year's Australian circuit
and Wimbledon campaign, but he learned to handle the problem well
enough to win his second straight U.S. Open title two weeks ago.
	   ``It's a little bit of a problem at the moment,'' Rafter said of
the knee.
	   ``It's been for years, it's come and gone _ but now it's more
coming than going. I've eight weeks to go until the end of the year
and I don't think it's going to get a lot worse in that time, so
I'm fine with it.
	   ``When the adrenalin's pumping you don't really feel it _ I get
more upset with it if I feel it on my serve and I can't push off.''
	   Rafter said he had decided to bypass the Grand Slam Cup in
Hanover this week in order to rest the knee.
	   He will stay in Australia until late this week before flying out
to start an eight-week European campaign in Switzerland and then
return to Australia for more rest.
	   ``I really have to address the situation (with the knee) when I
get home, maybe while I'm over there,'' said Rafter, ruling out any
chance of surgery. ``There's probably a bit of tendinitis so it
really needs a good rest.''
	   Rafter and Stoltenberg laid the foundations for Australia's
clean sweep of Uzbekistan in Friday's singles rubbers when Rafter
beat Ogorodov 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 and Stoltenberg beat Vadim Kutsenko
7-5, 6-1, 6-0. (djp)

with 26.3 percent and 42 seats.
	   Among other opposition parties, the Party of the Democratic Left
_ former communists turned Social Democrats _ got 14.7 percent to
earn 23 seats; the Hungarian Coalition Party, representing
Slovakia's largest minority ethnic group, had 9.1 percent for 15
seats; and the six-month-old Party of Civic Understanding, led by
the popular mayor of Kosice, Slovakia's second-largest city _ got 8
percent for 13 seats.
	   If confirmed by official results, opposition forces would have
93 deputies in Parliament, more than the three-fifths majority
needed to vote for a president.
	   Only one ally of Meciar's weakened HZDS, the far-right Slovak
National Party, received the minimum 5 percent required for
Parliament seats. It got 9 percent for 13 seats.
	   Opposition parties already had proclaimed victory and celebrated
with champagne Saturday, based on similar exit poll numbers and a
sampling of unofficial results.
	   Officials in the neighboring Czech Republic and Hungary welcomed
the prospect of change in Slovakia. But the political demise of
Meciar, whose anti-democratic practices have left Slovakia
diplomatically isolated in Central Europe, is not yet certain.
	   Meciar has promised to accept the results, but rumors still
swirled Sunday that authorities might try something out of
desperation to stay in power, including invalidating the election
or meddling with the results, as international human rights groups
have warned.
	   Officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which monitored voting at 1,700 polling stations, said
``the election as such was carried out in an apparently correct and
acceptable manner.'' But they said they could not assess whether it
was free and fair until final official results were published and
carried out.
	   If it is the top vote-getting party, the HZDS would be given
first chance to try to put together another governing coalition,
although its prospects for finding allies are bleak because of
strong anti-Meciar sentiments.

Belly dancer's bid to sue Egyptian ambassador rejected
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ An Israeli court, citing diplomatic
immunity, ruled Sunday that an Israeli belly dancer cannot sue the
Egyptian ambassador, whom she accuses of sexual assault.
	   The dancer, Shlomit Shalom, accused Ambassador Mohammed
Bassiouny of sexually attacking her in August 1997, but police said
there was no supporting evidence.
	   Bassiouny denied the charge and accused the dancer of
harassment.
	   Shalom then submitted a civil action seeking 1 million shekels
(dlrs 286,000) in damages to the Tel Aviv Magistrates Court. She
said her reputation had been ruined and she no longer received
offers of work.
	   Her lawyer, Nitzana Darshan-Leitner, said Bassiouny's alleged
actions were not covered by diplomatic immunity, but Attorney
General Eliakim Rubinstein argued that it did apply. The judge,
Avraham Tal, agreed.
	   Darshan-Leitner said her client would appeal.

 &UR; Malaysia tells visiting reporters not to outstay Games permits

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ The Malaysian government on Sunday
warned visiting foreign journalists with expired credentials from
the Commonwealth Games not to overstay without permission in order
to cover the political unrest triggered by the firing of the
country's former deputy prime minister.
	   ``They can come but must first register,'' Malaysia's official
Bernama news agency quoted Information Minister Mohamad Rahmat as
saying about foreign correspondents who originally came to report
on the sporting event.
	   The Commonwealth Games, which ended Sept. 21, drew some 2,000
international journalists to Kuala Lumpur, the Southeast Asian
nation's capital city.
	   Many have stayed in the country to cover mass demonstrations
which riot police have broken up with tear gas and water cannons.
Anwar was fired on Sept. 2 and arrested last Sunday, one day before
the Games ended.
	   The government last week ordered its state-owned broadcasting
house, Radio Television Malaysia, not to allow foreign broadcasters
to use its satellite facilities and other equipment for
transmitting footage.
	   ``The foreign media will be given the freedom to cover this
country but they are not allowed to use the equipment and
facilities at the Information Ministry,'' Mohamad said Sunday. RTM
is part of the information ministry.
	   As international criticism over Anwar's case has become more
vocal, Malaysian officials have become harsher with foreign
reporters. On Saturday, foreign reporters were barred from
attending a news conference by Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad.
	   Anwar, who has not yet been formally charged, has been detained
under the country's Internal Security Act, which allows indefinite
detention without trial. He has been accused of a number of crimes
ranging from illegal homosexual acts to leaking state secrets.

Czechs beat South Africa 5-0
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PRAGUE, Czech Republic (AP) - Bohdan Ulihrach defeated David
Nainkin and Slava Dosedel crushed Piet Norval, completing the Czech
Republic's 5-0 victory Sunday over South Africa in Davis Cup World
Group qualifying.
	   The victory gives the Czechs a place in next season's 16-team
World Group, the elite of the Davis Cup. Ulihrach won 6-1, 6-0 over
Nainkin and Dosedel had it just as easy, winning 6-1, 6-1.
	   Both teams were allowed to nominate substitutes for Sunday's
singles after the Czechs gained an unbeatable 3-0 lead Saturday.
South Africa swopped Nainkin for Wayne Ferreira and Norval for
Marcos Ondruska.
	   Ulihrach, ranked 32nd on the ATP Tour, gave the South African no
chance, clinching the first set 6-0 in a mere 21 minutes. The
second was just as quick with Ulihrach winning 6-1 despite playing
in a relaxed, exhibition tempo.
	   Ulihrach, a clay court specialist, drubbed Nainkin with precise
baseline play, powerful forehands and clever drop shots.
	   ``I can't remember the last time I won this easily,'' Ulihrach
said.
	   The other match was close in the first few games, but Dosedel
took the iniciative and beat Norval, a doubles specialist. Neither
player took the match too seriously as both played a number of
theatrical shots to entertain the fans.
	   ``It was an exhibition, a show,'' Dosedel said.

Yeltsin to meet with Primakov, new ministers
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economic crisis will again top President
Boris Yeltsin's agenda this week.
	   On Monday, Yeltsin is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, and with three ministers appointed to the
government on Friday: Economy Minister Andrei Shapovalyants, Trade
Minister Georgy Gabunia, and Science and Technology Minister
Mikhail Kirpichnikov.
	   Shapovalyants is expected Monday to complete the formation of
the new working group established Saturday to negotiate with banks
over Russia's repayment of billions of dollars worth of treasury
bonds held by Russian and foreign banks. The cash-strapped
government announced in mid-August that it would have to set new
terms and timing for repayment, in effect freezing the bonds.
	   The working group will offer Russia's proposed terms for
repaying the debt at a meeting with bank representatives on
Tuesday, Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov has said.

Tudjman: WW II Cardinal supported wartime state, not its fascist

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's president is defending a
controversial cleric to be beatified by Pope John Paul II next
weekend, saying the late cardinal supported Croatia's Nazi-backed
wartime state but not its ``fascist methods.''
	   Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac was Zagreb's archbishop during World
War II, when a Croat puppet state persecuted tens of thousands of
Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents. The pontiff is to beatify
Stepinac on Saturday during a visit to Croatia.
	   The Simon Wiesenthal Center has asked the Vatican to postpone
Stepinac's beatification, a step in the lengthy process toward
sainthood, pending further study of his actions during World War
II.
	   ``Stepinac supported a right of Croatian people to have their
own state,'' Croatian President Franjo Tudjman told the Roman
Catholic magazine Mi. ``But he decisively opposed ... fascist
methods.''
	   Stepinac ``opposed racist laws and crimes, but he also opposed
communist regime,'' Tudjman said.
	   Stepinac stood by the leader of the pro-German state, Ante
Pavelic, in early days of his rule. By 1942, however, Stepinac
denounced the regime's genocidal policies.
	   His own notes and recent studies say he spoke out against the
atrocities and worked to save lives, but many Serbs and Jews still
consider him a war criminal.
	   After the war, Stepinac was tried by Yugoslavia's communist
government and sentenced to jail for his collaboration. He died
under house arrest in 1962.
	   Controversy surrounding Stepinac surfaced again when the Vatican
announced plans to beatify him. The Vatican has not responded to
requests for a delay in the beatification.
	   Croatia's government has lobbied strongly to proceed with the
ceremony. Roman Catholics make up more than 70 percent of the
country's 4.5 million people. Beatifying Stepinac is seen as a step
toward reinforcing the Church's position in a country which was
part of Communist Yugoslavia until it declared independence on June
25, 1991.
	   Croatian Catholics see Stepinac as a hero for his resistance to
attempts by the former Communist government to suppress religion
and split the Croatian church from the Vatican.
	   Croatia's vice premier, Jure Radic, said Saturday that the
request for a delay is ``indecent.''
	   ``The Church has its standards ... and the beatification
procedure has been strengthened on thousands of cases throughout
2,000 years,'' Radic said. ``It is indecent to position itself
beyond that procedure.''
	   Tudjman himself is often accused by critics of cultivating a
sort of nationalism that harks back to the World War II state. He
has repeatedly declared that wartime Croatia was not simply a
fascist state but also an expression of Croats' long-term desire
for independence.

Congolese rebels rally for U.S. support
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HRVOJE HRANJSKI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels said Sunday they will seek
help from the U.S. government in hopes of breaking their diplomatic
isolation in a 9-week civil war.
	   Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, leader of the rebel Congolese Democratic
Coalition, said the group's vice president, Jacques Depelchin, was
due to meet U.S. officials in Washington Monday.
	   ``We want to get across the notion that the resolution to the
Congolese problem will at the same time guarantee peace and
security in the subregion, and not the other way around,'' Wamba
said.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice, the State
Department's top official for Africa, recently denied Congo's
allegations that the United States tacitly approved of Rwandan and
Ugandan support for the rebels.
	   The United States have called for the withdrawal of all foreign
troops. But Rice told Congress on Sept. 15 that she shared regional
and international frustration with President Laurent Kabila's
failure to open Congo to democracy.
	   Wamba did not say whom Depelchin, a former lecturer at Berkeley
University, would meet.
	   The rebels _ ethnic Tutsis, disenchanted soldiers and officers
and exiled politicians and academics _ took up arms Aug. 2 to
topple Kabila, accusing him of mismanagement, corruption and
creating division among the country's 400 ethnic groups.
	   Kabila's allies from Angola, Zimbabwe and Nabimia beat back
rebel who were advancing on the capital, Kinshasa, and has
contained them in the eastern third of the country.
	   Since then, little has changed on battlefields far apart in this
vast African nation.
	   ``We're trying to develop aggressive diplomacy to move the
conflict from an external affair into an internal problem _ whether
it is a cease-fire or a political settlement,'' Wamba said.
	   He said he met Friday in Lusaka, Zambia with officials from the
Southern African Development Community on the possibility of direct
negotiations between Kabila and rebels.
	   So far, Kabila has refused to talk with the rebels, accusing
them of being the puppets of Rwanda and Uganda, and has vowed to
defeat them militarily.
	   Recent attacks by government troops in southern Katanga province
and allied Rwandan Hutu militiamen in eastern Congo appear to have
slowed down the rebel force. In turn, rebels have forcibly
recruited thousands of young men, sometimes at gunpoint, residents
said.
	   Rebel leaders said up to 20,000 people, most of them ethnic
Tutsis, fled government attacks last week on Vyura, about 680
kilometers (425 miles) southwest of Goma.
	   On Saturday, Wamba said, the Rwandan Hutus allegedly trained by
the government attacked rebel positions at Nyiragongo volcano, 10
kilometers (6 miles) west of Goma. The attackers were beaten back
and many Hutu militiamen killed, he said, without elaborating.
	   Hutu fighters fled Rwanda in fear of reprisals from Rwandan
Tutsi-led soldiers for the genocide of more than 500,000 Rwandan
Tutsis in 1994.
	   The Hutus are fed and sheltered by the local population in
eastern Congo, most of whom accuse Tutsis of land-grabbing and
dominating local politics.
	   Rwanda, which installed Kabila in power last year but is
disappointed with his performance, has repeatedly said it will not
stand idle while its Tutsi brethren are killed in Congo.
	   The conflict has drawn in most of Congo's nine neighbors, most
recently Chad, which reportedly sent 1,000 soldiers to fight on the
government side.

Serb moderate looks ahead to work in Bosnia's joint presidency
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By KATARINA KRATOVAC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The pro-Western Bosnian
Serb moderate who won a seat in Bosnia's three-member presidency in
this month's election pledged Sunday to work closely with his
Muslim and Croat counterparts.
	   ``We shall not be judged by our sweet-talk and promises but by
concrete results in implementing democratic and economic reforms,''
Zivko Radisic, from the Western-backed Harmony alliance, said.
	   Under the 1995 Dayton peace agreement which ended the war in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav republic was divided into
two parts _ a Bosnian Serb-run entity and a federation of Muslims
and Croats.
	   The agreement also provided for central governing bodies, headed
by a three-member presidency _ one each from the Bosnian Serb,
Croat and Muslim communities.
	   ``The three-member presidency is a unique body in a very unique
country,'' Radisic said. He promised smooth cooperation with the
others.
	   Speaking at a press conference in Banja Luka, the largest town
in the Serb entity, Radisic said ``there can be no return to the
past'' and that Bosnia is at ``the beginning of a new phase for the
whole country.''
	   The elections brought Radisic to the post previously held by a
hard-line Serb, Momcilo Krajisnik, who was often criticized by
international officials as uncooperative and stubbornly
nationalistic.
	   However, in a separate race for president of the Serb entity,
another hardliner, Nikola Poplasen, triumphed over Radisic's fellow
moderate Biljana Plavsic.
	   Earlier Sunday, NATO announced the arrest of Stevan Todorovic, a
former Bosnian Serb police chief who has been indicted by the
international war crimes court for murder, rape and other crimes
during the 1992-1995 Bosnian War.
	   Radisic said that prosecuting war crimes suspects can relieve
his people from any collective guilt from the bloody ethnic
conflict.
	   ``No one has the right to equate an individual's actions and
responsibilities with the responsibility of an entire people,''
Radisic said.

Cathay Pacific to start servicing domestic routes in Philippines

<TEXT>
	   MANILA, Philippines (AP) _ Cathay Pacific Airways will begin
flying domestic routes in the Philippines on Monday to fill a
vacuum left by the closure of flag-carrier Philippine Airlines,
officials said Sunday.
	   David Turnbull, Cathay Pacific's chief executive officer,
announced the move and said his Hong Kong-based company also has an
interest in buying a stake in Philippine Airlines if it is put up
for sale.
	   No formal takeover talks have begun, but Turnbull said he did
meet recently with Lucio Tan, PAL's chairman and chief stockholder.
	   ``We do have some interest in PAL in the long run,'' he said.
	   PAL's closure last Wednesday left many areas of the sprawling
Philippine archipelago without air service, and officials have been
struggling to bridge the gap to avoid serious damage to the
economy.
	   In talks Sunday at the home of Philippine President Joseph
Estrada, Turnbull agreed that as a first step in reinstating
nationwide service two Cathay Pacific planes and crews will be
leased to PNB Holdings, a unit of Philippine National Bank, which
is partially owned by the government.
	   The flights will nominally be operated by PNB Holdings since
Philippine law prohibits foreign carriers from servicing domestic
routes.
	   One plane will begin flights between Manila and the central city
of Cebu on Monday, airline officials said. A second is to begin
flying later in the week. Additional planes may be added later if
they are needed, they said.
	   ``We are doing it at cost,'' Turnbull said. ``This is being done
at very short notice, and it's a temporary arrangement.''
	   Estrada called the agreement ``a good development in order to
fill the vacuum left by PAL,'' adding that Cathay's move may have
resolved the crisis caused by PAL's sudden termination of flight
service.
	   Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said up to six Cathay planes
may be leased with accompanying crews.
	   At least three smaller Philippine domestic carriers have also
said they plan to expand their operations in response to PAL's
closure, and air force planes are helping carry vital cargo,
including mail, medicine and newspapers, officials said.
	   PAL shut down after a union representing ground personnel
refused to accept a management-proposed rehabilitation plan in
which workers would have received 20 percent of the airline's stock
in exchange for a 10-year suspension of their collective bargaining
agreement.
	   Government labor officials are continuing to try to reconcile
differences between the two sides, Estrada said.
	   On Saturday, union leaders offered not to strike for 10 years
and to accept cuts in various benefits as long as their current
grievance mechanisms were maintained.
	   A committee formed by Manila's Securities and Exchange
Commission is also studying whether there is a chance of reopening
the carrier, which has been unable to make payments on dlrs 2.1
billion in debts to domestic and international creditors.
	   Estrada says the government is unable to take over PAL because
there is no money in public coffers to underwrite daily losses of
up to 45 million pesos (dlrs 1 million) incurred by the airline.
	   Both PAL and Cathay Pacific have been hit hard by Asia's
currency crisis, which has reduced passenger volume. PAL had
launched a dlrs 4 billion modernization and refleeting program
shortly before the crisis hit.
	   The Philippine flag carrier also was badly hurt by labor
disputes, including a 22-day pilots' strike in June.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ After one of the tightest races in postwar
Germany, voters on Sunday elect a chancellor to shepherd Europe's
largest nation through historic changes: the government's move back
to Berlin, and the switch from the trusted German mark to the euro,
Europe's common currency.
	   Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 68, who merged communist East Germany
with the West in 1990, is seeking an unprecedented fifth term after
16 years in office. His appeal is stability and his clout with
world powers at a time of economic turmoil in Russia and ongoing
conflict in the Balkans.
	   His challenger, Gerhard Schroeder, 54, has campaigned as the
voice of change, appealing to Germans who feel the nation has
stagnated under Kohl, the West's longest-serving leader.
	   Kohl's Christian Democrats narrowed the Social Democrats'
12-point lead last spring to within a point in the days before the
election, and up to 21 percent of Germany's 60.5 million voters
remained undecided on the eve of the vote.
	   With the race so tight, pollsters predicted that the Christian
Democrats and Social Democrats would have to share power in a
so-called ``grand coalition.'' The two main parties have not
governed together in almost 30 years.
	   Kohl voted with his wife, Hannelore, in his Rhine River hometown
of Oggersheim after attending Mass. ``I'm very pleased with how the
campaign has gone,'' Kohl told around 100 reporters and
photographers who trailed his limousine from church to the polling
station.
	   Schroeder cast his ballot in Hanover, capital of Lower Saxony
state, where he is governor. He and his wife, Doris, confessed to
jitters.
	   ``I'm doing well,'' Schroeder said. ``I won't deny that I'm a
little anxious.''
	   Both candidates were to watch results at their parties'
headquarters in Bonn after polls close at 6 p.m. (1400 gmt).
	   Voters were choosing a new 656-seat parliament, where the party
with the most seats proposes the chancellor. If no party wins a
majority, as is likely, the strongest party forms a coalition.
	   Christine Sander, a 25-year-old computer consultant, has known
no other leader than Kohl in her adult life. She voted for change _
meaning Schroeder _ hoping that the Social Democrats will win
enough support to rule in a coalition with the liberal Greens.
	   ``I'm not so convinced they will do everything so great and so
different, but I want to experience what it will be like with
something else,'' Sander said outside a polling station in Bonn.
	   Besides tackling grand projects as Germany moves into the 21st
century _ NATO and European Union expansion, as well as the
government move and the common currency _ the new chancellor has
serious domestic problems to address during his four-year term.
	   Unemployment, running above 10 percent, was the main campaign
issue this year, and the candidates offered only cautious proposals
for modernizing Germany's prosperous but over-regulated economy.
	   Both Kohl and Schroeder said they wanted to reduce regulations
sapping the German competitiveness. But Kohl has proposed a bigger
tax cut than Schroeder.
	   Schroeder, a populist who has tried to move his traditionally
leftist party toward the center, promised few specifics in an
effort to appeal to the widest possible audience. Where he offered
details, his plans called for repealing modest cuts in social
welfare and retirement programs that Kohl pushed through in the
last four years.
	   The survival of Kohl's center-right government depended not only
on his popularity but also on the tiny pro-business Free Democrats,
his junior coalition partner. Polls suggested they might not make
it into parliament this time.
	   If Schroeder wins enough votes to form a coalition on his own,
his likely partner would be the environmentalist Greens party,
which has the best shot yet at entering government.
	   The biggest threat to a Social Democrat-Greens coalition were
swing voters in the former communist east who pollsters predicted
could opt for the ex-communist Party for Democratic Socialism as a
protest vote against Bonn politics.

Hamilton wins Gene Sarazen Jun Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SHIOYA, Japan (AP) _ American Todd Hamilton fired a 7-under-par
65 Sunday as he surged ahead of the two overnight leaders and won
his first title in two years by a pair of strokes in the Gene
Sarazen Jun Classic.
	   After starting three shots off the pace, Hamilton birdied the
first two holes and went on to add five more birdies in a
bogey-free trek over the par-72 Rope Club course. It was a tie for
the day's best round.
	   At an 18-under 270 total, Hamilton finished two strokes ahead of
Australian Craig Parry.
	   The victory, Hamilton's first since winning the 1996 PGA
Philanthropy, was worth 19.8 million yen (dlrs 147,000) from a
purse of 110 million yen (dlrs 818,000).
	   The 32-year-old Hamilton, winner of the 1992 Order of Merit on
the Asian Tour, has won seven tournaments overall in six years on
the Japan tour.
	   ``I've been in bad shape and playing bad golf for two long
years,'' Hamilton said. ``This win really means a lot to me and to
my golf.''
	   Parry, winner of the Japan Open last year, sank four birdies in
the first seven holes and went ahead of overnight leader Carlos
Franco of Paraguay to grab the lead before the turn.
	   But Parry was overtaken by Hamilton on the back side, finishing
with a 68 for 272.
	   Ryoken Kawagishi and Nobuhito Sato shot 67s to share third at
274.
	   Franco, winner of two tournaments this season, struggled to a 73
and fell to a fifth-place tie at 275 with Hajime Meshiai, who had a
68.
	   Masashi ``Jumbo'' Ozaki, who leads the money list with two
victories so far this season, shot a 66 and shared seventh at 277
with first-round leader Eduardo Herrera of Colombia and three
others.

Slovak opposition wins majority, unofficial results show

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties won enough seats
in two-day national elections to oust Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar if they join forces as pledged, according to unofficial
results released Sunday.
	   The results, based on full but unofficial tallies, may signal
the end of the authoritarian rule that has dominated this country
throughout its nearly six years of independence. The governing
party said it accepted them but was not giving up hope for leading
the next government.
	   Proclaiming victory, opposition party leaders huddled to try to
seal their informal alliance and put together a majority coalition
in Parliament, which elects both the prime minister and the
president.
	   ``The opposition won the elections,'' said Milan Ftacnik, deputy
chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left. ``The HZDS (ruling
party) is not going to buy out anybody.''
	   The Central Election Commission, which released the figures the
day after parliamentary elections ended Saturday, said they should
remain virtually unchanged when official results are released
Monday night or Tuesday. It said turnout was a record 84 percent.
	   Meciar's hard-line nationalist ruling party, the Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia, finished ahead of all other 16 parties with 27
percent of the vote, based on the unofficial results. That would
give it 43 seats in the 150-seat Parliament.
	   But the top opposition party, the Slovak Democratic Coalition,
was right behind _ leading a strong showing by four opposition
parties with 26.3 percent and 42 seats.
	   Two other opposition parties came next. The Party of the
Democratic Left _ former communists turned Social Democrats _ got
14.7 percent to earn 23 seats. The Hungarian Coalition Party,
representing Slovakia's largest minority ethnic group, had 9.1
percent for 15 seats.
	   A fourth party that has declared its intent to join in an
opposition alliance _ the six-month-old Party of Civic
Understanding, led by the popular mayor of Slovakia's
second-largest city Kosice _ got 8 percent for 13 seats.
	   If confirmed by official results, that would give opposition
forces 93 deputies in Parliament, more than the three-fifths
majority needed to vote for a president.
	   Meciar's weakened HZDS, which fared much better in the last
elections in 1994, appears to have only one potential ally among
the six parties who received the minimum 5 percent required for
Parliament seats. The far-right Slovak National Party, its main
partner in the current ruling coalition, got 9 percent for 13
seats.
	   The HZDS' other coalition partner, the Slovak Workers'
Association, failed to get 5 percent, according to the unofficial
results.
	   Opposition parties already had proclaimed victory and celebrated
with champagne Saturday, based on similar exit poll numbers and a
sampling of unofficial results.
	   But the political demise of Meciar, whose anti-democratic
practices have left Slovakia diplomatically isolated in Central
Europe, is not yet certain.
	   ``We accept the results of the elections,'' said Sergej Kozlik,
the ruling party's vice chairman, focusing on the HZDS' apparent
finish atop the list of parties.
	   ``Our goal is to have a majority in Parliament, but we will see
later if that will become true.''
	   Officials in the neighboring Czech Republic and Hungary welcomed
the prospect of change in Slovakia.
	   ``The result means a fundamental change of the political
situation in Slovakia,'' said the speaker of Czech Parliament,
Vaclav Klaus. ``The decision was up to the voters, and they decided
well.''
	   Despite Meciar's promises, rumors still swirled Sunday that
authorities might try something out of desperation to stay in
power, including invalidating the election or meddling with the
results, as international human rights groups have warned.
	   Officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which monitored voting at 1,700 polling stations, said
``the election as such was carried out in an apparently correct and
acceptable manner.'' But they said they could not assess whether it
was free and fair until final official results were published and
carried out.
	   If it is the top vote-getting party, the HZDS would be given
first chance to try to put together another governing coalition.
Even though its prospects for finding allies are bleak because of
strong anti-Meciar sentiments, political jockeying and posturing
began as soon as the voting ended.
	   Leaders of the Party of the Democratic Left denounced the ruling
party's suggestions the two might cooperate in a ruling coalition,
saying they would never work with the HZDS.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's president is defending a
controversial cleric to be beatified by Pope John Paul II next
weekend, saying the late cardinal supported Croatia's Nazi-backed
wartime state but not its ``fascist methods.''
	   Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac was Zagreb's archbishop during World
War II, when a Croat puppet state persecuted tens of thousands of
Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents. The pontiff is to beatify
Stepinac on Saturday during a visit to Croatia.
	   The Simon Wiesenthal Center has asked the Vatican to postpone
Stepinac's beatification, a step in the lengthy process toward
sainthood, pending further study of his actions during World War
II.
	   ``Stepinac supported a right of Croatian people to have their
own state,'' Croatian President Franjo Tudjman told the Roman
Catholic magazine Mi. ``But he decisively opposed ... fascist
methods.''
	   Stepinac ``opposed racist laws and crimes, but he also opposed
communist regime,'' Tudjman said.
	   Stepinac stood by the leader of the pro-German state, Ante
Pavelic, in early days of his rule. By 1942, however, Stepinac
denounced the regime's genocidal policies.
	   His own notes and recent studies say he spoke out against the
atrocities and worked to save lives, but many Serbs and Jews still
consider him a war criminal.
	   After the war, Stepinac was tried by Yugoslavia's communist
government and sentenced to jail for his collaboration. He died
under house arrest in 1962.
	   Controversy surrounding Stepinac surfaced again when the Vatican
announced plans in July to beatify him. The Vatican has not
responded to requests for a delay in the beatification.
	   Croatia's government has lobbied strongly to proceed with the
ceremony. Roman Catholics make up more than 70 percent of the
country's 4.5 million people. Beatifying Stepinac is seen as a step
toward reinforcing the Church's position in a country which was
part of Communist Yugoslavia until it declared independence on June
25, 1991.
	   Croatian Catholics see Stepinac as a hero for his resistance to
attempts by the former Communist government to suppress religion
and split the Croatian church from the Vatican.
	   Croatia's vice premier, Jure Radic, said Saturday that the
request for a delay is ``indecent.''
	   Tudjman himself is often accused by critics of cultivating a
nationalism that harks back to the World War II state. He has
repeatedly declared that wartime Croatia was not simply a fascist
state but also an expression of Croats' long-term desire for
independence.

Serb moderate looks forward to work in Bosnia's joint presidency

	   BANJA LUKA, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ The pro-Western Bosnian
Serb moderate who won a seat in Bosnia's three-member presidency in
this month's election pledged Sunday to work closely with his
Muslim and Croat counterparts.
	   ``We shall not be judged by our sweet-talk and promises but by
concrete results in implementing democratic and economic reforms,''
Zivko Radisic, from the Western-backed Harmony alliance, said.
	   Under the 1995 Dayton peace agreement which ended the war in
Bosnia-Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav republic was divided into
two parts _ a Bosnian Serb-run entity and a federation of Muslims
and Croats.
	   The agreement also provided for central governing bodies, headed
by a three-member presidency _ one each from the Bosnian Serb,
Croat and Muslim communities.
	   ``The three-member presidency is a unique body in a very unique
country,'' Radisic said. He promised smooth cooperation with the
others.
	   Speaking at a press conference in Banja Luka, the largest town
in the Serb entity, Radisic said ``there can be no return to the
past'' and that Bosnia is at ``the beginning of a new phase for the
whole country.''
	   The elections brought Radisic to the post previously held by a
hard-line Serb, Momcilo Krajisnik, who was often criticized by
international officials as uncooperative and stubbornly
nationalistic.
	   In a separate race for president of the Serb entity, another
hardliner, Nikola Poplasen, triumphed over Radisic's fellow
moderate Biljana Plavsic.

Report: Officials reconsidering China investment limits
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Government officials in Taiwan will meet
business leaders this week to discuss relaxing restrictions on
investments in China in a sign of improving relations with Beijing,
a newspaper reported Sunday.
	   Premier Vincent Siew will meet Wednesday with Taiwan's top 200
investors in China, where Taiwanese entrepreneurs have sunk an
estimated U.S. dlrs 30 billion, the United Daily News said.
	   President Lee Teng-hui, who introduced the regulations on
Chinese mainland investments, will meet the same group on Friday,
it said.
	   Taiwan's Economics Ministry has prepared a report saying it
might be willing to adjust economic policies toward China if a
meeting next month between the two sides' top negotiators goes
well, the paper said.
	   The changes come amid growing hope for a breakthrough in
relations between China and Taiwan during top Taiwanese negotiator
Koo Chen-fu's visit to Beijing, which begins on Oct. 14.
	   Expectations the visit will help end a three-year suspension in
talks were stoked last week after successful preliminary meetings
held by lower level officials.
	   Taiwan, which became a refuge for anti-communist nationalist
Chinese forces after the establishment of the People's Republic of
China, has banned direct trade, transportation and communications
with the mainland.
	   The restrictions have forced companies based in Taiwan to use
roundabout means to do business with China.
	   Beijing claims Taiwan as a breakaway province and has threatened
to use force to restore rule over the island if necessary.

Pope calls contrast between world's rich, poor `truly intolerable'
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CASTEL GANDOLFO, Italy (AP) _ Pope John Paul II decried Sunday
what he called the ``truly intolerable contrast'' between the rich
and poor of the world, saying the well-off were wrong to ignore the
hungry, the homeless and the jobless.
	   The pope spoke on the feast day of St. Vincent de Paul, founder
of a charity that fed and nursed the poor and sick.
	   John Paul told the faithful gathered for his weekly Sunday
address of the ``truly intolerable contrast'' between ``the portion
of humanity who enjoy all the advantages of economic well-being and
scientific progress and the enormous masses who live in conditions
of extreme poverty.
	   ``It isn't right to be resigned to the immoral spectacle of a
world in which there are still those who die of hunger, who don't
have homes, who lack the most elementary education, who don't have
access to health care in case of sickness, who cannot find work.''
	   In their interest, he invoked his own insistence that a
commitment to peace and justice must be an essential part of the
preparations for the Roman Catholic Church's preparations for its
2000 Jubilee.
	   The pope spoke at his vacation retreat at Castel Gandolfo
outside Rome, following his Sunday practice of interspersing a
serious message with good-tempered acknowledgments of the chanting,
singing, banner-waving pilgrims gathered below his window.

diplomatic ties with Iraq &QL;

background, PICK UP 6th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Iraq's charge d'affaires in Ankara on
Sunday welcomed Turkey's decision to restore full diplomatic
affairs, after more than seven years of sour relations between the
neighbors.
	   Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit announced Saturday that Turkey was
sending an ambassador to Baghdad. Iraq's own ambassador to Ankara
left last year for what Iraqi charge d'affaires T. Hamandi said
were administrative reasons, rather than political.
	   ``It is a step in the right direction,'' Hamandi said Sunday of
Turkey's initiative, without saying whether Iraq would reciprocate
by sending an ambassador back to Turkey.
	   Relations between the two countries have been helped by their
common worry about two Iraqi Kurdish groups. Both countries oppose
a U.S.-brokered pact that the two groups signed Sept. 17 ending
their rivalry in northern Iraq, which the groups have controlled
since Western allies set up a haven for Iraqi Kurds after the 1991
Gulf War.
	   In the past, disputes over Turkey's close ties with the United
States, over sharing of water resources, and over Iraqi Kurds' de
facto autonomous zone have all served to sour relations between
Turkey and Iraq. Turkey has not had an ambassador in Iraq since the
Gulf War.

Russian travel industry hit hard by economic crisis
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's economic crisis has badly bruised the
nation's tourism industry, driving demand for transportation down
25 percent, the ITAR-Tass news agency reported Sunday.
	   Sergei Shpilko, deputy chairman of the Russian State Committee
for Physical Culture and Tourism, said that at least 30 percent of
employees of travel agencies would probably be laid off in October,
ITAR-Tass said. He said that many travel agencies had been forced
to halt their activities because of the paralysis of the nation's
banking system.
	   Shpilko called on the government to support the industry, which
was until recently one of the fastest developing sectors of the
economy, ITAR-Tass said. He said the government should reduce visa
fees and customs duties on imported buses and hotel equipment.

Western officials laud Slovak election process, high turnout
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ International officials on Sunday
praised the Slovak election procedure and the 84 percent turnout,
but withheld judgement on whether the vote was fair until final
results are issued and carried out.
	   Despite criticism of anti-democratic practices by the hard-line
government, the elections ``show a serious attempt by authorities
to have a fair electoral process,'' said Franciszelk Adamczyk, a
representative of the Council of Europe.
	   More than 200 monitors from the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe were present for Friday-Saturday
parliamentary elections, visiting 1,700 polling stations across
Slovakia.
	   The OSCE observer mission expressed satisfaction that voting
generally was conducted in a peaceful and orderly manner, with no
serious incidents reported. It did voice concern, however, about
media bias and other perceived problems during the campaign,
particularly involving pro-government Slovak State Television.
	   ``Although an atmosphere of political polarization led to a lack
of confidence in the overall process by many Slovak citizens, the
election as such was carried out in an apparently correct and
acceptable manner,'' the security group said in a statement read by
Helle Degn, president of the OSCE Parliamentary Assembly.
	   ``No final assessment can be drawn until the vote count and
verification procedure have been completed, and the final results
have been published.''

Carp defeat BayStars 3-1
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Kenji Tomashino and Koichi Ogata of the Hiroshima
Toyo Carp each hit a home run Sunday as their team beat the Central
League's front-running Yokohama BayStars 3-1 at a home game in
Hiroshima.
	   Tomashino's fourth homer of the season came in the first inning
and Ogata's 15th homer of the season was knocked out in the two-run
fourth.
	   The BayStars ended their winning streak at five, but still have
a 5 1/2 game lead over the second-place Chunichi Dragons, who
blanked the Hanshin Tigers 2-0 in a game which was called after the
top of the seventh because of torrential rain.
	   The Dragons' Lee Jong Beom, formerly with the Hai Tai Tigers of
South Korea's professional baseball league, got Chunichi off to a
strong start in the two-run first inning with a double.
	   Lee scored the first run, thanks to a single by teammate Koichi
Sekikawa. That was followed by Takeshi Yamasaki's one-run single.
	   At the Tokyo Dome, meanwhile, rookie Yoshinobu Takahashi smashed
a two-run home run in a four-run third inning and Masumi Kuwata
scattered seven hits as the Yomiuri Giants beat the Yakult Swallows
6-2.
	   Takahashi has 19 homers and Kuwata is 15-5.
	   In the Pacific League, Harvey Jerome Pulliam Jr. drove in the
tie-breaking run in a two-run second inning with a sacrifice fly,
leading the Orix BlueWave to a 7-1 victory over the Fukuoka Daiei
Hawks at Kobe.
	   The Hawks led 1-0 in the first inning on a home run by Luis
Lopez, formerly with the Cleveland Indians, against Mark Mimbs, but
Yasuo Fujii hit a tying-one run single before Pulliam's
tie-breaking sacrifice fly.
	   The BlueWave added one run in the fourth and four runs in the
eight.
	   Starter Mimbs hurled a three-hitter over 5 1/2 innings for his
second victory against four defeats.
	   Lopez has 17 homers.
	   Two other scheduled games were rained out.

	   ZURICH (AP) _ Kenyans dominated at the World Half Marathon
Championships Sunday, with Paul Koech and defending champion Tegla
Loroupe taking home the men's and women's titles.
	   Under cool, gray skies Koech covered the 21.1 kilometer (13
mile) course through the hilly Swiss countryside in 1 hour, 1
second, to finish 23 seconds ahead of his closest rival.
	   Loroupe, meanwhile, overcame rival Elana Meyer of South Africa
again this year, crossing in 1:08:29 to become the first athlete to
successfully defend a title in the seven year history of the event.
	   Behind Koech, South Africa's Hendrick Ramaala took silver in
1:00:24, followed by 1994 champion Khalid Skah of Morocco, third
with an identical time.

Iran missile threat prompts fresh debate in Israel

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ Iran's parading of a missile capable of
reaching Israel set off sharp debate in Israel Sunday, with one
prominent politician scolding another for saying Israel should
consider a pre-emptive strike.
	   Uzi Landau, chairman of the Israeli parliament's foreign affairs
and security committee, told Israel radio Sunday that such
``unnecessary chatter'' could heighten the likelihood of Israel
being targeted.
	   Landau was responding to remarks by Ephraim Sneh, a general in
the Israeli army reserves and a leading member of the opposition
Labor party, who asserted that international efforts to keep Iran
from acquiring long-range missiles and atomic weapons have failed,
leaving Israel vulnerable.
	   ``I am talking about the possibility, if we have no choice, to
deliver a conventional counter-strike or pre-emptive strike,'' Sneh
told Israel's Channel Two.
	   Iran on Friday displayed its medium-range Shahab-3 missile
during a military parade. The missile, which Iran tested in July,
has a range of 1,300 kilometers (800 miles).
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has
``exceptional'' means to counter the threat from Iran, but warned
in an interview from New York on Israel radio that ``a strategic
threat against us is developing.''
	   He said the Iranian moves confirm Israeli assessments over the
past two years, and called for international efforts to stop Iran's
missile and weapons programs.
	   Sneh said the Shahab-3 missile will be operational next year,
before the Arrow anti-missile system, a joint Israel-U.S. project
now in the testing stage. He said Iran is developing atomic weapons
at the same fast rate.
	   ``Together with the insane heads of state in Tehran...this
constitutes a threat Israel cannot live with,'' he said.
	   He discounted recent moderate statements from Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami, saying he is not the one who makes policy in
Iran.
	   Landau said he was not playing down the threat to Israel from
Iran, but noted that Iran has other potential enemies, like Iraq,
Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan.

	   VLADIVOSTOK, Russia (AP) _ Election officials pronounced
Vladivostok's long-delayed mayoral vote valid, despite complaints
that the leading candidate had been stricken from Sunday's ballot
at the last minute.
	   The chaotic election capped a campaign dominated by the bitter
rivalry between city and regional leaders.
	   As voters arrived at some polling stations Sunday morning,
election officials were still scrambling to cross the names of two
disqualified candidates off the ballots: incumbent Mayor Viktor
Cherepkov, the leading candidate, and Vladimir Murashov.
	   A city court ruled Thursday that Cherepkov could not run because
he had illegally paid for his campaign with city money, while
Murashov was barred because of anti-Semitic statements.
	   The commission instructed polling stations to strike both names
from the ballots just six hours before polls were to open.
	   ``Why did they remove Cherepkov? I don't understand. This is a
completely illegal election,'' said Galina Ivanova, an agitated
70-year-old voter who is representative of the mayor's loyal
following of mostly senior citizens.
	   Some disgruntled citizens scattered photocopied leaflets around
the city urging people not to vote at all.
	   Still, many of Vladivostok's 800,000 residents turned out for
the vote. By the time polls closed at 10 p.m. (1100 GMT), nearly 40
percent of voters had cast ballots, making the election valid, said
Ilya Grinchenko, chairman of the city election commission. Official
results were expected on Tuesday.

Rolls Royce wins contract to supply jet engines for British
</HEADLINE>
Airways &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Rolls Royce has won a 580 million-pound (dlrs 930
million) contract to supply jet engines for British Airways' new
fleet of Boeing 777 jets, beating competition from U.S. rivals
General Electric Co. and Pratt and Whitney, the airline said
Sunday.
	   British Airways said the British aero-engineering firm will
supply up to 64 of its Trent 895 engines to be fitted to the
airline's new twinjet Boeing 777s. British Airways has placed an
order for 16 of the new jets and taken an option on another 16.
	   ''The race to win this engine order has been one of the most
competitive in our history,'' British Airways' Chief Executive Bob
Ayling said in a statement.
	   ''The Trent 895 best suited our needs.''
	   The deal is significant in securing jobs at Rolls Royce, which
lost out to General Electric of Fairfield, Connecticut, in 1991
when British Airways bought engines for the airline's first fleet
of 29 Boeing 777s.
	   The Trent engines are assembled at Rolls Royce's plant in Derby,
northeast England, from components made at its factories across
England that employ more than 25,000 people. Another 8,000 people
are employed in some 1,500 other related British companies.

State vote in eastern Germany shows strength of extremist parties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Election &QL; 
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ While Germany's two main parties
battled for control of the federal parliament Sunday, a state race
in the former communist east could provide political drama to
Germans concerned about smaller extreme parties on the right and
the left.
	   The ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism, which already
enjoys strong support in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, had its
first shot at being a part of a state government coalition.
	   The Social Democrats, who have been governing in a strained
coalition with the Christian Democrats, have said they will turn to
the PDS as a partner if they win.
	   Polls show the Social Democrats at just under 40 percent _ 10
percent higher than 1994 _ due in part to their popular chancellor
candidate, Gerhard Schroeder. Kohl's Christian Democrats were
running close behind in the state.
	   The PDS was running about 20 percent.
	   Any government including the ex-communist party is a concern for
mainstream politicians in Bonn, who deride the party as the
remnants of the anti-democratic East German regime. But many
easterners feel the PDS better represents their interests in a
political system dominated by westerners.
	   On the extreme-right, three rival parties were competing for
voters angry at unemployment running nearly 20 percent in the
state, the poorest in the former east. They capitalized on fears
that foreigners were taking jobs for Germans _ plastering streets
with posters demanding ``Work for Germans first!'' and ``Criminal
Foreigners Out!'' _ although less than 1 percent of the state's 1.8
million people are foreigners.
	   Pollsters put the support for the far-right at between 10
percent and 20 percent. And with the vote split, it was likely that
none of the parties would reach the 5-percent hurdle needed to
enter parliament.
	   But pollsters also suggested support could be higher, because
many surveyed won't admit backing the extreme right. That fear was
born out in eastern Saxony-Anhalt state in the spring, when the
anti-foreigner German People's Union won a surprising 13 percent of
the vote.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties won enough seats
in two-day national elections to be able to oust Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar if they join forces as pledged, according to
unofficial results released Sunday.
	   The results, based on full but unofficial tallies, may signal
the end of the authoritarian rule that has dominated this country
throughout its nearly six years of independence. The governing
party said it accepted them but was not giving up hope for leading
the next government.
	   Proclaiming victory, opposition party leaders huddled to try to
seal their informal alliance and put together a majority coalition
in Parliament, which elects both the prime minister and the
president.
	   ``The opposition won the elections,'' said Milan Ftacnik, deputy
chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left. ``The HZDS (ruling
party) is not going to buy out anybody.''
	   The Central Election Commission, which released the figures the
day after parliamentary elections ended Saturday, said they should
remain virtually unchanged when official results are released
Monday night or Tuesday. It said turnout was a record 84 percent.
	   Meciar's hard-line nationalist ruling party, the Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia, finished ahead of all other 16 parties with 27
percent of the vote, based on the unofficial results. That would
give it 43 seats in the 150-seat Parliament.
	   But the top opposition party, the Slovak Democratic Coalition,
was right behind _ leading a strong showing by four opposition
parties with 26.3 percent and 42 seats.
	   Two other opposition parties came next. The Party of the
Democratic Left _ former communists turned Social Democrats _ got
14.7 percent to earn 23 seats. The Hungarian Coalition Party,
representing Slovakia's largest minority ethnic group, had 9.1
percent for 15 seats.
	   A fourth party that has declared its intent to join in an
opposition alliance _ the six-month-old Party of Civic
Understanding, led by the popular mayor of Kosice, Slovakia's
second-largest city _ got 8 percent for 13 seats.
	   If confirmed by official results, that would give opposition
forces 93 deputies in Parliament, more than the three-fifths
majority needed to vote for a president.
	   Meciar's weakened HZDS, which fared much better in the last
elections in 1994, appears to have only one potential ally among
the six parties who received the minimum 5 percent required for
Parliament seats. The far-right Slovak National Party, its main
partner in the current ruling coalition, got 9 percent for 13
seats.
	   The HZDS' other coalition partner, the Slovak Workers'
Association, failed to get 5 percent, according to the unofficial
results.
	   Opposition parties already had proclaimed victory and celebrated
with champagne Saturday, based on similar exit poll numbers and a
sampling of unofficial results.
	   But the political demise of Meciar, whose anti-democratic
practices have left Slovakia diplomatically isolated in Central
Europe, is not yet certain.
	   ``We accept the results of the elections,'' said Sergej Kozlik,
the ruling party's vice chairman, focusing on the HZDS' apparent
finish atop the list of parties.
	   ``Our goal is to have a majority in Parliament, but we will see
later if that will become true.''
	   Former President Michal Kovac, whose powers were mostly assumed
by Meciar when his term ended in March, said the results meant
voters had rejected authoritarian ``Meciarism.''
	   ``The majority of people showed a desire for big political
change, and an interest to enter the European Union and NATO,'' he
said in an interview. ``This is an important turning point which
shows that Slovakia will walk faster toward the EU.''
	   Officials in the neighboring Czech Republic and Hungary also
welcomed the prospect of change in Slovakia.

	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Police ordered the evacuation of a busy Moscow
train station on Sunday after receiving a telephoned threat that a
bomb had been planted in the building.
	   It was the latest of several telephone bomb threats over the
past two months concerning the Kazan railway station. It is one
terminus for trains from Chechnya, and also serves trains from the
southern Urals region.
	   Police bomb experts accompanied by sniffer dogs found no trace
of an explosive, and the station was reopened within a few hours,
Russian news agencies reported.

two singles but India stayed alive with a doubles win Saturday as
Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi defeated Henman and Neil Broad.
	   The match, delayed 45 minutes by rain, saw Henman take a 4-2
lead in the first set, but Paes _ the India No. 1 _ rallied to
force a tiebreaker.
	   In the tiebreaker, Henman went up 6-3 as Paes missed two volleys
and then won with a backhand service return that Paes hit into the
net.
	   Henman won the second set in 29 minutes as Paes won the first
game but lost the next five. The third set also went to a
tiebreakder after Henman blew an early lead.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Jonas Bjorkman came from 1-4 in the
second set to beat Carlos Moya 6-3, 7-5 Sunday and gave Sweden a
4-0 lead over Spain in the Davis Cup semifinal.
	   It was the third victory for Bjorkman this weekend. He won
Friday's first singles in four sets against Alex Corretja and
teamed with Nicklas Kulti to win Saturday's doubles that clinched
Sweden's 12th trip to the finals.
	   The defending champions will face Italy, which took an
unbeatable 3-0 lead over the United States in the other semifinal
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the Dec. 4-6 final in Italy.
	   Davis Cup rookie Thomas Johansson was to play Corretja in the
last singles match later Sunday at the Royal Tennis Hall, the site
of Sweden's first Davis Cup triumph in 1975.

<TEXT>
	   KUWAIT (AP) _ The Kuwait-based Organization of Arab Petroleum
Exporting Countries said Sunday it would sponsor a seminar next
month on environmental protection and the oil industry.
	   The three-day meeting is to open in the Egyptian capital Cairo
on Oct. 5, OAPEC said in a statement.
	   Specialists from international companies will speak about
protecting the environment during oil operations from drilling to
refining and transport. And they will discuss ``promotion for
gradual switching to unleaded gasoline in Arab countries.''
	   The organization also said it was sponsoring a two-day meeting
for Arab environmental experts starting Oct. 3 in Cairo.
	   It is aimed at ``coordinating stances'' ahead of U.N.
negotiations for an agreement on climate changes and the Kyoto
protocol.
	   OAPEC, which was founded in 1968, groups 10 Arab countries.
 &UR; ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ An Egyptian delegation is visiting China for
meetings on labor issues and worker training programs, the Egyptian
Gazette reported Sunday.
	   The delegation, headed by Trade Unions Federation
secretary-general Sayed Rashed, is expected to sign a protocol
under which China would provide Egypt with technical expertise in
development of rural industries, the English-language daily said.
	   The agreement also will call for joint training sessions, the
paper quoted Rashed as saying.
	   The delegation, which left for China Saturday, is to visit a
number of factories in Shanghai to study production methods, Rashed
told the paper.
	   The federation is an umbrella group for Egyptian labor unions.
 &UR; ___
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A joint Egyptian-Libyan committee has
selected 900 Egyptians to teach in Libyan institutions of higher
education during this school year, Egypt's Middle East News Agency
reported Sunday.
	   The teachers are scheduled to assume their posts in Libya within
the next few days, MENA said.
	   Some will teach courses including Arabic, English, mathematics,
physics and engineering. Others will be posted at vocational
training centers to teach carpentry, electronics and hospitality
management, MENA said.
	   Currently, about 500,000 Egyptians work in Libya, many in the
oil industry.
	   Earlier this month, Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi asked Egypt to
send a million farmers to work newly reclaimed desert land.
 &UR; ___
	   AMMAN, Jordan (AP) _ The state-run Jordan Industrial Development
Bank registered a 7 percent increase in profits during the first
six months of this year, the bank's general manager said Sunday.
	   Rajab Al-Saad attributed the higher profits to more industrial
activity in Jordan, which led to more demand for loans.
	   The bank is one of the 10 largest financial institutions in
Jordan.
	   Al-Saad told The Associated Press profits in the first six
months totaled 1.98 million Jordanian dinars (dlrs 2.78 million),
up from 1.85 million dinars (dlrs 2.60 million) in the year-earlier
period.
	   He said the state has given the bank credit facilities and soft
loans of 40 million dinars (dlrs 56 million) this year to assist in
underwriting industrial and tourism projects.

Two killed, six wounded as Shiite Muslims clash with Pakistani

	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Hundreds of Shiites Muslim mourners
exchanged gunfire Sunday with security forces in the southern port
city of Karachi, leaving two people killed and six others wounded,
police said.
	   The Shiite protesters blocked roads and attacked vehicles in
Karachi's eastern district during a funeral procession of their
religious leader and his son who were killed Saturday. Two soldiers
were among the injured.
	   Shiite leader Safar Ali, 60 and his son Rajab Ali, 28, were shot
to death by two unidentified gunmen outside their shop in Eidgah
area of Karachi. Police suspects rival Sunni extremists were
involved in Saturday's killings.
	   The mourners, chanting anti-government slogans and calling for
revenge, damaged scores of vehicles and burned tires.
	   ``Paramilitary soldiers opened unprovoked firing on peaceful
funeral procession, killing two of our supporters,'' said Allama
Hasan Turrabi, a leader of thwe militant Shiite Tehrik-e-Jafria, or
the movement for the implementation of Shiite rights.
	   Police denied the allegation and said the protesters fired
first.
	   Turrabi has called for a strike on Tuesday in the southern Sindh
province, of which Karachi is the capital, to protest the killings
of the Shiite leader.
	   Sunni and Shiite Muslim extremist groups are locked in a fierce
sectarian war which has left hundreds of people dead over the last
few years.
	   Sectarian violence has intensified after the killing of four
Sunni Muslim leaders in the capital Islamabad earlier this month.
Since then, several Shiite Muslims have become victims of revenge
killings in various parts of the country.
	   Sunni groups accuse neighboring Iran of helping the Shiite
extremists, while Shiite groups blame Saudi Arabia of funding the
Sunni militant organizations. Both these countries deny the charge.
	   Shiites Muslims comprise 15 percent of the population in
Sunni-dominated Pakistan.

Far right, Socialists in by-election; third of Senate renewed
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ Voters went to the polls Sunday in a key
by-election in the southern port city of Toulon where the far right
National Front was defending its sole parliamentary seat.
	   Meanwhile, an electoral college was renewing one third of the
French Senate.
	   In last week's first round, the National Front's Cendrine Le
Chevallier edged out Socialist candidate Odette Casanova by 39.6
percent to 36.7 percent.
	   It was the fourth time voters in Toulon have cast ballots to
choose a National Assembly representative.
	   In February, the election of Le Chevallier's husband,
Jean-Marie, a National Front deputy, was annulled after he was
found guilty of breaking campaign financing rules.
	   In May, Casanova beat Le Chevallier by just 33 votes. But the
vote was annulled after the National Front protested the count.
	   The National Front, which has won about 15 percent in recent
elections, blames immigrants, particularly from North Africa, for
high unemployment and urban violence. It has also been accused of
anti-Semitism.
	   The makeup of the Senate was being decided by municipal and
regional councillors and National Assembly members.
	   Some 102 seats were being renewed in the 321-seat chamber where
the right enjoys a clear majority. Polls say France's right and
left stand to gain seats to the detriment of the centrist Union for
French Democracy (UDF).
	   Senators serve nine-year terms and about a third of the chamber
is elected every three years.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who recently described it as ``an
anomaly,'' says the chamber must undergo reform.
	   Althouth the Senate has far less power than the National
Assembly, it can amend legislation and occasionally has thwarted
government projects.

reaching Israel set off sharp debate in Israel Sunday, with one
prominent politician scolding another for saying Israel should
consider a pre-emptive strike.
	   Uzi Landau, chairman of the Israeli parliament's foreign affairs
and security committee, told Israel radio Sunday that such
``unnecessary chatter'' could heighten the likelihood of Israel
being targeted.
	   Landau was responding to remarks by Ephraim Sneh, a general in
the Israeli army reserves and a leading member of the opposition
Labor party, who asserted that international efforts to keep Iran
from acquiring long-range missiles and atomic weapons have failed,
leaving Israel vulnerable.
	   ``I am talking about the possibility, if we have no choice, to
deliver a conventional counter-strike or pre-emptive strike,'' Sneh
told Israel's Channel Two.
	   Iran on Friday displayed its medium-range Shahab-3 missile
during a military parade. The missile, which Iran tested in July,
has a range of 1,300 kilometers (800 miles).
	   Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said Israel has
``exceptional'' means to counter the threat from Iran, but warned
in an interview from New York on Israel radio that ``a strategic
threat against us is developing.''
	   He said the Iranian moves confirm Israeli assessments over the
past two years, and called for international efforts to stop Iran's
missile and weapons programs.
	   Sneh said the Shahab-3 missile will be operational next year,
before the Arrow anti-missile system, a joint Israel-U.S. project
now in the testing stage. He said Iran is developing atomic weapons
at the same fast rate.
	   ``Together with the insane heads of state in Tehran...this
constitutes a threat Israel cannot live with,'' he said.
	   He discounted recent moderate statements from Iranian President
Mohammad Khatami, saying he is not the one who makes policy in
Iran.
	   Landau said he was not playing down the threat to Israel from
Iran, but noted that Iran has other potential enemies, like Iraq,
Saudi Arabia and Afghanistan.

Koech wins half marathon title, Loroupe defends hers

	   ZURICH (AP) _ Kenyans dominated at the World Half Marathon
Championships Sunday, with defending champion Tegla Loroupe and
Paul Koech claiming the men's and women's titles, giving the nation
a sweep of gold for the second year in a row.
	   Under cool, gray skies Loroupe covered the 21.1 kilometer (13
mile) course through the hilly Swiss countryside in 1 hour, 8
minutes and 29 seconds, to become the first runner to successfully
defend a title in the seven year history of the event.
	   Koech, meanwhile, broke away mid-way through the men's race,
overcoming a tough field to finish in 1:00:01, a convincing 23
seconds ahead of his closest rival.
	   South Africa's Hendrick Ramaala took silver in 1:00:24, followed
by 1994 champion Khalid Skah of Morocco, third with an identical
time.
	   Loroupe, holder of the best female marathon time, set the pace
from the start, breaking away about 5 km (3 miles) into the race.
	   The 1994 champion Elana Meyer, who failed to finish last year
after staying with Loroupe for 10 km, managed to hang on this time
around, staying on Kenyan's heels for the majority of the race.
	   But with just under two kilometers to go, Loroupe pulled away
from her rival, with Meyer unable to make up a three second
disadvantage.
	   ``I had a really good race today,'' said Loroupe, who won the
New York marathon on her debut in the distance. ``I know Elena is
one of the best runners there is.
	   ``With about a kilometer and a half to go I decided to pull away
from Elana,'' said Loroupe. ``She was really tough but I knew at
the end I had more kick left in me.''
	   Meyer was not unhappy with her silver.
	   ``Today, silver was worth gold for me,'' said Meyer, who
finished ahead of bronze medallist Lidia Simon of Romania. ``Last
year I had so many injuries, I feel lucky I was able to come back
and have such a tough competition with Tegla.''
	   In the men's race, Koech made it look easy.
	   The 29-year-old Kenyan made his move about 12 km into the race,
pulling away from Skah and the Ethiopian trio of Ibrahim Seid,
Alene Emere and Alemayehu Girma.
	   ``The pace was too slow,'' said Koech, a 10 km (6.2 mile)
specialist. ``So I decided to speed up to a more comfortable pace
for me. When I saw a few others pushing up to come with me, I went
a little faster.
	   ``I couldn't see anybody behind me after that but there were a
lot of corners,'' Koech said. ``So it was only with about 500
meters (545 yards) to go that I told myself victory was mine.''
	   Koech took the title from last year's champion, compatriot Shem
Kororia, who settled for 10th, 1:29 back.
	   Track's newest star Ronaldo da Costa, who snapped a 10-year best
time in Berlin last week in only his second marathon, finished 12th
in 10:01:40, waving the Brazilian flag as he crossed the
finishline.

<TEXT>
	   EINDHOVEN, Netherlands (AP) _ Wins for Jan Siemerink and Sjeng
Schalken Sunday gave the Netherlands' a 5-0 shutout over Ecuador in
this Davis Cup World Group Qualifying Round tie.
	   Siemerink, ranked 20 in the world, calmly strolled through what
was effectively an exhibition match, routing Ecuador's Giovanni
Lapentti 6-2, 6-1 in just 40 minutes.
	   The 15-year-old Lapentti was relacing his older brother Nicolas,
the Ecuador No.1, to gain experience.
	   Then Schalken, stepping in to replace Dutch No.2 Paul Haarhuis,
was equally ruthless but slightly slower in dismissing Luis Morejon
6-0, 6-3 in 48 minutes.
	   Sunday's reverse singles were played as best-of-three-sets dead
rubbers, with the Netherlands already unbeatable at 3-0 up after
Haarhuis and Jacco Eltingh won Saturday's doubles.
	   The Netherlands will be now be among the 16 countries contesting
the World Group next year.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties won enough seats
in two-day national elections to be able to oust Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar if they join forces as pledged, according to
unofficial results released Sunday.
	   The results, based on full but unofficial tallies, may signal
the end of the authoritarian rule that has dominated this country
throughout its nearly six years of independence. The governing
party said it accepted them but was not giving up hope for leading
the next government.
	   Proclaiming victory, opposition party leaders huddled to try to
seal their informal alliance and put together a majority coalition
in Parliament, which elects both the prime minister and the
president.
	   ``The opposition won the elections,'' said Milan Ftacnik, deputy
chairman of the Party of the Democratic Left. ``The HZDS (ruling
party) is not going to buy out anybody.''
	   The Central Election Commission, which released the figures the
day after parliamentary elections ended Saturday, said they should
remain virtually unchanged when official results are released
Monday night or Tuesday. It said turnout was a record 84 percent.
	   Meciar's hard-line nationalist ruling party, the Movement for a
Democratic Slovakia, finished ahead of all other 16 parties with 27
percent of the vote, based on the unofficial results. That would
give it 43 seats in the 150-seat Parliament.
	   Among other opposition parties, the Party of the Democratic Left
_ former communists turned Social Democrats _ got 14.7 percent to
earn 23 seats; the Hungarian Coalition Party, representing
Slovakia's largest minority ethnic group, had 9.1 percent for 15
seats; and the six-month-old Party of Civic Understanding, led by
the popular mayor of Kosice, Slovakia's second-largest city _ got 8
percent for 13 seats.
	   If confirmed by official results, that would give opposition
forces 93 deputies in Parliament, more than the three-fifths
majority needed to vote for a president.
	   Only one ally of Meciar's weakened HZDS, the far-right Slovak
National Party, received the minimum 5 percent required for
Parliament seats. It got 9 percent for 13 seats.
	   Opposition parties already had proclaimed victory and celebrated
with champagne Saturday, based on similar exit poll numbers and a
sampling of unofficial results.
	   But the political demise of Meciar, whose anti-democratic
practices have left Slovakia diplomatically isolated in Central
Europe, is not yet certain.
	   ``Our goal is to have a majority in Parliament, but we will see
later if that will become true,'' said Sergej Kozlik, the ruling
party's vice chairman, accepting the results.
	   Former President Michal Kovac, whose powers were mostly assumed
by Meciar when his term ended in March, said the results meant
voters had rejected authoritarian ``Meciarism.''
	   ``The majority of people showed a desire for big political
change, and an interest to enter the European Union and NATO,'' he
said in an interview. ``This is an important turning point which
shows that Slovakia will walk faster toward the EU.''
	   Officials in the neighboring Czech Republic and Hungary also
welcomed the prospect of change in Slovakia.
	   Officials of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
Europe, which monitored voting at 1,700 polling stations, said
``the election as such was carried out in an apparently correct and
acceptable manner.''
	   If it is the top vote-getting party, the HZDS would be given
first chance to try to put together another governing coalition,
although its prospects for finding allies are bleak because of
strong anti-Meciar sentiments.

Britain advances to World Group; takes unbeatable 3-1 lead
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: ADDS Henman quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Tim Henman defeated Leander Paes of
India 7-6 (7-3), 6-2, 7-6 (7-5) Sunday to move Britain into next
year's World Group, the elite 16 of the Davis Cup, for the first
time since 1992.
	   The victory, in just over two hours, gave Britain an unbeatable
3-1 lead over India in the best-of-five tie. Britain won Friday's
two singles but India stayed alive with a doubles win Saturday as
Paes and Mahesh Bhupathi defeated Henman and Neil Broad.
	   ``It just shows how important the tiebreaks are,'' Henman said.
``We lost both yesterday in doubles and we won both today and that
was probably the difference.''
	   ``It was an important match to get back into the World Group and
it was nice to come through,'' Henman added. ``We've got the team
that deserves to be among the top 16 nations.''
	   Added coach David Lloyd, ``I think it's extremely important for
British tennis. Hopefully, we can get a good draw and win it.''
	   The match, delayed 45 minutes by rain, saw Henman take a 4-2
lead in the first set, but Paes _ the India No. 1 _ rallied to
force a tiebreaker.
	   In the tiebreaker, Henman went up 6-3 as Paes missed two volleys
and then won with a backhand service return that Paes hit into the
net.
	   Henman won the second set in 29 minutes as Paes won the first
game but lost the next five. The third set also went to a
tiebreaker after Henman blew an early lead.

Israeli Arabs clash with police in land dispute; 40 said hurt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ About 40 people were hurt Sunday in violent
clashes in north-central Israel between Israeli police and Israeli
Arabs involving a land dispute, army radio said.
	   Police confirmed that eight officers were among the injured in
the fighting near the predominantly Arab town of Umm al-Fahm, 30
kilometers (20 miles) southeast of the port city of Haifa.
	   The fighting erupted as Israeli police moved in to tear down a
tent erected by protesters who claimed the land was unfairly
confiscated. Demonstrators threw rocks and firebombs at the police,
who responded with tear gas.
	   Radio reports said dozens of protesters were hurt, including the
mayor of Umm al-Fahm.
	   A demonstrator told army radio that police fired rubber-coated
bullets and live ammunition. The Israeli police commander, Alik
Rom, said the reports were being checked.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin did not confirm live ammunition
was used, but said police lives were endangered in the clash. Under
Israeli regulations, soldiers and police may open fire with live
bullets if their lives are in danger.
	   Israeli authorities say the disputed area, near the northern
edge of the West Bank, is an Israeli army firing range. They say an
agreement was reached with the residents to nationalize about 125
acres (50 hectares) of land, in exchange for about six times as
much land elsewhere.
	   Residents of Umm el-Fahm put up a tent on the disputed land
three weeks ago. Israeli officials said they tried to negotiate
with the protesters and persuade them to leave on their own, and
sent in police to evict them after those efforts failed.
	   About 20 percent of Israel's citizens are Arabs. They live
within the original boundaries of the state, and do not include
more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

NUERBURGRING: 80 points.

	   In the final race, Hakkinen can afford to finish second to
Schumacher and still clinch his first Formula One championship.
	   If the two drivers are tied on points at the end of the season,
the greater number of second-place finishes will be decisive and
Hakkinen would be ahead of Schumacher in the tie-breaking formula.
	   Schumacher, starting from the pole, was upstaged at the start of
the 67-lap race by Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine, who was also in
the front row. Irvine had a faster start and was ahead of
Schumacher into the first turn. But just before the first lap was
over, Schumacher moved into the lead.
	   The German started pulling away and opened a five-second lead
over Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes, with Irvine holding up the Finn.
	   Hakkinen finally passed Irvine in the 14th lap and began closing
the gap by consistently putting in the fastest time lap after lap.
But Hakkinen's left front wheel locked in a turn on lap 17 and the
gap grew again to eight seconds.
	   By lap 22, the gap was down to five seconds as Hakkinen's
McLaren consistently drew closer.
	   Schumacher made his first pit stop for fuel and new tires on lap
25 and Hakkinen zoomed into the lead, driving another fastest lap.
	   Hakkinen made his stop on lap 28 and came out just ahead of
Schumacher, who had been slowed down by traffic.
	   For the next few laps the gap between the two remained under a
second and halfway into the race, Schumacher was tailgating
Hakkinen, just .6 seconds behind.
	   But on lap 43, Schumacher had problems holding his line coming
out of two turns and Hakkinen's lead grew to 1.8 seconds and
increased to 2.2 seconds three laps later.
	   Schumacher pitted for the second time on lap 48, Hakkinen one
lap later and the Finn again came out ahead of the German, 2.9
seconds faster, with the gap growing to five seconds in a few laps.
	   Hakkinen maintained his lead until the end, losing a couple of
seconds in the last lap.
	   He finished the race distance of 305.252 kilometers (189.674
miles) in one hour, 23.718 seconds, beating Schumacher by 2.2
seconds at the checkered flag.
	   David Coulthard in the second McLaren was third, while Irvine
finished fourth.
	   Heinz-Harald Frentzen in a Williams was fifth, while Giancarlo
Fisichella in a Benetton finished sixth.

Israeli Arabs clash with police in land dispute; 40 said hurt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ About 40 people were hurt Sunday in violent
clashes in north-central Israel between Israeli police and Israeli
Arabs involving a land dispute, army radio said.
	   Police confirmed that eight officers were among the injured in
the fighting near the predominantly Arab town of Umm al-Fahm, 30
kilometers (20 miles) southeast of the port city of Haifa.
	   The fighting erupted as Israeli police moved in to tear down a
tent erected by protesters who claimed the land was unfairly
confiscated. Demonstrators threw rocks and firebombs at the police,
who responded with tear gas.
	   Radio reports said dozens of protesters were hurt, including the
mayor of Umm al-Fahm.
	   A demonstrator told army radio that police fired rubber-coated
bullets and live ammunition. The Israeli police commander, Alik
Rom, said the reports were being checked.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin did not confirm live ammunition
was used, but said police lives were endangered in the clash. Under
Israeli regulations, soldiers and police may open fire with live
bullets if their lives are in danger.
	   Israeli authorities say the disputed area, near the northern
edge of the West Bank, is an Israeli army firing range. They say an
agreement was reached with the residents to nationalize about 125
acres (50 hectares) of land, in exchange for about six times as
much land elsewhere.
	   Residents of Umm el-Fahm put up a tent on the disputed land
three weeks ago. Israeli officials said they tried to negotiate
with the protesters and persuade them to leave on their own, and
sent in police to evict them after those efforts failed.
	   About 20 percent of Israel's citizens are Arabs. They live
within the original boundaries of the state, and do not include
more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

Somali basketball players held hostage
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Humanitarians called Sunday for the
immediate release of six basketball players who were being punished
for participating in a tournament for peace.
	   It was the first time in eight years of civil strife in Somalia
that athletes were targeted by militiamen for political reasons.
	   The six players were taken hostage 11 days ago by militiamen of
Muse Sudi Yalahow, faction leader of the Medina district of
southern Mogadishu, who accused them of being traitors.
	   He was punishing the players from Medina for competing with
other Mogadishu teams for the Peace Cup. The match was sponsored by
a fledgling local administration for Mogadishu forged by Hussein
Aidid and Sudi Yalahow's rival Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
	   Somalia has not had a central government since late 1991, when
President Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown by a coalition of
clan-based factions that later began fighting among themselves.
	   Dr. Ismail Jumale Human Rights Center called for the players'
release, saying their detentions were illegal and against the
wishes of Somalis.
	   A team fan, who asked not to be named, said the players were not
being given enough food or water and were being kept in a dark
room.
	   Also Sunday, militiamen exchanged machine-gun and grenade fire
at the K-7 junction of south Mogadishu controlled by faction leader
Osman Ali Atto.
	   Witnesses said at least two militiamen were killed and five
others wounded in a fight involving 10 battlewagons.
	   Source close to the militiamen said the gunfire started when a
convoy of six battlewagons belonging to a contractor delivering
supplies for the U.N. World Food Program tried to pass through the
K-7 junction.
	   The militiamen were annoyed by the heavy use of weaponry by the
WFP contractor, said sources who refused to be identified.

Vatican representative leads earthquake memorial Mass at Assisi
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ASSISI, Italy (AP) _ Presiding at an open-air altar surrounded
by scaffolding, the Vatican undersecretary of state led a memorial
Mass on Sunday for the four victims of the quake collapse of the
ceiling of Assisi's St. Francis' Basilica.
	   More than 1,500 attended the service, held on a piazza outside
the badly damaged landmark
	   It marked the first anniversary of two Sept. 26, 1997, quakes
that hit the hill towns of central Italy, killing 10, rendering
thousands homeless and crumbling priceless works of art and
architecture.
	   ``The truly difficult wounds to heal are those that the
earthquake has left inside those who experienced it,'' Archbishop
Giovanni Battista Re said, conveying Pope John Paul II's sympathies
to the families of the four victims at Assisi and to those still
homeless.
	   The second of the two earthquakes brought down the vaulted
ceiling of the 13th-century structure, killing two structural
experts, a friar and a man about to take his vows as they inspected
damage from the first quake.
	   Church leaders hope to have the church restored in time for
Christmas services in 1999, if not earlier.

Di Canio could face long ban _ a la Cantona
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Eric Cantona of Manchester United received an
eight-month ban for his infamous kung-fu kick in 1995.
	   Paolo Di Canio of Sheffield Wednesday may be heading for a
similar punishment by the English F.A. for shoving referee Paul
Alcock to the ground in Saturday's 1-0 win over Arsenal at
Hillsborough.
	   Danny Wilson, Sheffield Wednesday's coach, announced an
immediate suspension of Di Canio pending sanctions from the F.A.
	   F.A. chief executive Graham Kelly declined Sunday to speculate
on the penalty pending a hearing by the body's disciplinary
commission.
	   ``The rules in the rulebook are fairly wide and well known but
it is not for me to get involved in quoting anything,'' Kelly said.
	   ``It could be unfair for any commission that deals with a case
and for the player himself because whatever he has done he deserves
a fair hearing and we are always at pains to ensure that is done.
	   ``All the circumstances will be considered by the commission
when the case appears and they will be examined carefully. For now
we welcome that Sheffield Wednesday have taken such a responsible
attitude (in suspending Di Canio).''
	   After Saturday's incident, Alcock told the league's top referee
Philip Don that he may quit the profession.
	   ``I have spoken to Paul three times to give him support as he
was very shocked _ it is something you don't expect to happen,''
Don said. ``He's obviously going to think about his future _
whether he continues as a referee has entered his mind.''
	   Alcock was pushed to the ground by the 30-year-old Italian after
he was shown a red card for his part in a brawl in the final
minutes of the first half.
	   Arsenal's Martin Keown was also sent off as a melee among a
dozen players broke out following a tussle between Arsenal's
Patrick Vieira and Wim Jonk.

Salmonella outbreak sickens 800 in Georgia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TBILISI, Georgia (AP) _ Eight hundred people in western Georgia
have become sick with salmonella poisoning that is believed to have
been caused by tainted water, authorities said Sunday.
	   The outbreak began Saturday in the Kabuletti region, 300
kilometers west of Tbilisi, the Georgian capital. Fifty of those
stricken have been hospitalized, according to Tariel Khalvashi, the
head of the local administration.
	   Salmonella is a bacteria that can cause headache, diarrhea,
vomiting and fever, and can be particularly dangerous for elderly
people or those in poor health. It is usually associated with
undercooked chicken, pork and eggs.

Japan expresses concern over subcritical nuclear test by U.S.
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS; UPDATES 4th-5th grafs with comments from Japanese
prime minister.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Political leaders in Japan, the only country ever
to suffer an atomic bombing, on Sunday expressed concern over a
nuclear experiment carried out by the Unites States to test the
reliability of its nuclear stockpile.
	   The mayors of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, the two Japanese cities
destroyed by nuclear bombs at the end of World War II, condemned
the U.S. action, saying it would impede nuclear disarmament
efforts.
	   The experiment Saturday at a test site in Nevada, the fourth
such subcritical nuclear test by the U.S., involved blasting
plutonium with explosives too weak to set off the self-sustaining
nuclear reaction of an nuclear explosion.
	   Japanese Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi made a more muted statement
of concern, calling for increased international discussion of such
testing.
	   ``Although it was subcritical, we want to discuss the matter
with other countries in the international community in the
future,'' Obuchi was quoted as saying by Kyodo News agency. He
provided no details about the proposed talks.
	   Obuchi added that subcritical nuclear tests are commonly
understood to be in compliance with the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty as they do not involve a nuclear explosion, Kyodo said.
	   But Nagasaki Mayor Itcho Ito offered a blunter assessment,
saying the test ``trampled on the request by Nagasaki citizens and
the people of the world'' not to carry it out.
	   Takashi Hiraoka, mayor of Hiroshima, said the test ``will
inevitably cause a build-up in the nuclear weapons race.''
	   The United States says the tests are to obtain information on
plutonium samples at varying ages and do not violate the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
	   But anti-nuclear campaigners in Japan counter that any kind of
nuclear test is likely to tempt other countries to develop atomic
weapons.
	   ``At a time when hopes are rising for the development of nuclear
disarmament, it is necessary to criticize the United States at the
international level,'' Nagasaki mayor Ito said.

Montgomerie grabs money lead, captures German Masters in dramatic

finish &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie's final putt Sunday
staved off several challengers as he captured the German Masters by
one stroke while firing a final round 67.
	   The Scotsman also took over as Europe's leading money-winner
when his six-foot par putt dropped on the final hole, ending the
hopes of a charging Vijah Singh and Sweden's Robert Karlsson.
	   Montgomerie, who had the lead wrestled away on the 13th hole by
Karlsson, finished at 22-under 266 at the dlrs 1.68 million event.
	   Montgomerie swept past England's Lee Westwood on the earnings
list by taking home dlrs 270,000 and moved close to a record sixth
straight Order-of-Merit title with just two events left.
	   The 35-year-old led through most of the round until Karlsson,
riding five birdies, dropped a spectacular eagle on the par-5 13th
hole to jump ahead by a stroke.
	   But Karlsson's bogey on the following hole dropped him back into
a tie with Montgomerie. The Scotsman, playing behind him, then
wrestled back the lead with birdies at the 13th and 15th holes.
	   But Singh, playing his first tournament in Europe since winning
his first major, made another charge at Montgomerie, closing to a
stroke with birdies on the 16th and 17th holes.

<TEXT>
	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Frenzied fans clashed and fired
gunshots during a soccer match, killing at least two people and
injuring 40 others in a tribal area in Bangladesh, an official said
Sunday.
	   The military was called in as the fighting spread to the streets
of Dighinala, a township 175 kilometers (110 miles) southeast of
Dhaka, on Sunday.
	   The clash erupted 12 minutes before the final whistle as one of
the teams took a 2-0 lead. Two tribal youths, both fans, died of
bullet wounds, the official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The relatives of those killed said the deaths were caused by
police, a charge denied by the government.
	   Police said they used wooden sticks to disperse the clashing
tribal and non-tribal groups.
	   Buddhist Chakma tribespeople dominate the region and they often
clash with Muslim settlers who have migrated in thousands from
overcrowded plains to settle on tibal lands in the hilly area.

<TEXT>
	   GOMA, Congo (AP) _ Congolese rebels said Sunday they will seek
help from the U.S. government in hopes of breaking their diplomatic
isolation in a 9-week civil war.
	   Ernest Wamba dia Wamba, leader of the rebel Congolese Democratic
Coalition, said the group's vice president, Jacques Depelchin, was
due to meet U.S. officials in Washington Monday.
	   ``We want to get across the notion that the resolution to the
Congolese problem will at the same time guarantee peace and
security in the subregion, and not the other way around,'' Wamba
said.
	   U.S. Assistant Secretary of State Susan Rice, the State
Department's top official for Africa, recently denied Congo's
allegations that the United States tacitly approved of Rwandan and
Ugandan support for the rebels.
	   The United States have called for the withdrawal of all foreign
troops. But Rice told Congress on Sept. 15 that she shared regional
and international frustration with President Laurent Kabila's
failure to open Congo to democracy.
	   Wamba did not say whom Depelchin, a former lecturer at the
University of California at Berkeley, would meet.

Jackie Chan says Chinese stereotyped in Hollywood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ Hong Kong motion picture star Jackie Chan
has finally begun enjoying a taste of success in Hollywood, but
says that Chinese people in American films are too often typecast
as cops or killers.
	   ``There are few roles for Chinese unless they specially write a
script for us. Then its cop, cop, cop, killer, killer killer,''
Chan was shown as saying in a broadcast televised Sunday in Taipei,
where the actor-director is promoting his latest film ``Rush
Hour.''
	   Rush Hour, Chan's first Hollywood production in over a decade,
shocked industry insiders by grossing U.S. dlrs 33 million in its
mid-September opening week in the United States.
	   Chan plays a policeman in the movie, and Hollywood rookie actors
Chow Yun-fat and Jet Lee were cast as hit men. All three are
veteran actors in Hong Kong's movie industry.
	   Chan also revealed that he had a close brush with death during
the filming of a ``Rush Hour'' chase scene. Chan said he slipped
during the shot and nearly fell to his death.
	   ``I thought to myself, `how could I have been so stupid','' Chan
said, speaking to reporters late Saturday.
	   Chan, made an honorary officer by Taiwan's police
administration, also said he would donate 1 million Taiwan dollars
(U.S. dlrs 29,000) of the movie's proceeds to a fund for families
of officers killed on duty.

	   NUERBURGRING, Germany (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen seized the lead in
the Formula One championship when he won Sunday's Luxembourg Grand
Prix by holding off Michael Schumacher, his only rival for the
title.
	   In a close battle between the two title contenders, Hakkinen
twice beat Schumacher out of the pit stops and preserved his lead
to capture the penultimate race of the season.
	   ``Yes, indeed, this win is fantastic,'' Hakkinen said. ``It
makes my situation a lot different than it was two hours ago.''
	   The championship will now be decided in the final race Nov. 1 in
Suzuka, Japan.
	   Hakkinen picked up 10 points for his seventh win of the season
to open a four-point lead over Schumacher, 90-86. The two drivers
went into the race tied on 80 points.
	   In the final race, Hakkinen can afford to finish second and
still clinch his first Formula One championship.
	   ``It was great to win today, but nothing is over yet,'' said
Hakkinen, who turns 30 Monday. ``The fight continues and we have to
have very good preparation for the final race.''
	   Schumacher, starting from the pole, was upstaged at the start of
the 67-lap race by Ferrari teammate Eddie Irvine, who was also in
the front row. Irvine had a faster start and was ahead of
Schumacher into the first turn. But just before the first lap was
over, Schumacher moved into the lead.
	   The German started pulling away and opened a five-second lead
over Hakkinen's McLaren-Mercedes, with Irvine holding up the Finn.
	   Hakkinen finally passed Irvine in the 14th lap and began closing
the gap by consistently putting in the fastest time lap after lap.
But Hakkinen's left front wheel locked in a turn on lap 17 and the
gap grew again to eight seconds.
	   By lap 22, the gap was down to five seconds as Hakkinen's
McLaren consistently drew closer.
	   Schumacher made his first pit stop for fuel and new tires on lap
25 and Hakkinen zoomed into the lead, driving another fastest lap.
	   Hakkinen made his stop on lap 28 and came out just ahead of
Schumacher, who had been slowed down by traffic.
	   ``I was quite surprised that he came out ahead,'' Schumacher
said. ``I knew it would be tight but I thought I could still be
ahead.''
	   ``All in all I am surely a bit disappointed,'' said Schumacher,
who is chasing his third Formula One title and trying to become the
first Ferrari driver to become champion since Jody Scheckter in
1979.
	   ``After the first pit stop, we had no chance. We have to accept
that we were not fast enough in this race. But we are four points
behind and it's still not lost,'' the 29-year-old German said.
	   For the next few laps the gap between the two remained under a
second and halfway into the race, Schumacher was tailgating
Hakkinen, just .6 seconds behind the Finn.
	   But on lap 43, Schumacher had problems holding his line coming
out of two turns and Hakkinen's lead grew to 1.8 seconds and
increased to 2.2 seconds three laps later.
	   Schumacher pitted for the second time on lap 48, Hakkinen one
lap later and the Finn again came out ahead of the German, 2.9
seconds faster, with the gap growing to five seconds in a few laps.
	   Hakkinen maintained his lead until the end, losing a couple of
seconds in the last lap.
	   He finished the race distance of 305.252 kilometers (189.674
miles) in one hour, 23.718 seconds, beating Schumacher by 2.2
seconds at the checkered flag.
	   David Coulthard in the second McLaren was third, while Irvine
finished fourth.
	   Heinz-Harald Frentzen in a Williams was fifth, while Giancarlo
Fisichella in a Benetton finished sixth.
	   Dark clouds threatened throughout the race, but the weather
stayed dry.
	   Although the race is officially called the Luxembourg Grand
Prix, it is actually held across the border in Germany.

Bomb kills four, injures 15, in south west Algeria
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) _ A homemade bomb exploded in a town in
south west Algeria on Sunday, killing four people and injuring 15
others, authorities said.
	   The explosion occurred shortly after midday in Khemis, a town
near Ain Defla, 120 kilometers (75 miles) south west of Algiers.
	   A statement by the security forces read out over national radio
described the bombing as an act of ``cowardice.''
	   It gave no further details, but hospital sources, who requested
customary anonymity, said the victims were civilians and that most
received fatal head and chest wounds.
	   There was no claim of reponsibility, but such attacks are
normally blamed on the Armed Islamic Group which has been waging a
six-year insurgency against Algeria's military-backed government.
	   The Ain Defla region has been hit frequently by bombings which
authorities attribute to the Armed Islamic Group.
	   An estimated 75,000 people have died in the insurgency which
began when the army annulled 1992 elections which the now-banned
Islamic Salvation Front was set to win.

	   KATMANDU, Nepal (AP) _ Immigration authorities Saturday arrested
17 Afghans trying to enter China on their way to Britain using
forged passports, a domestic news agency said.
	   Nine carried forged Canadian passports and eight carried forged
Spanish passports. They planned to travel to Britain via Tibet and
Hong Kong, the National News Agency quoted Ratna Bajracharya, the
chief district officer, as saying.
	   Bajracharya said they claimed to have bought the fake passports
in the southern Indian city of Madras. They left Afghanistan to

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Jonas Bjorkman beat Carlos Moya 6-3,
7-5 on Sunday for his third match victory in the Davis Cup
semifinals this weekend as defending champion Sweden eliminated
Spain 4-1.
	   Julian Alonzo picked up the only point for Spain in the last
''dead'' singles match, winning 6-1, 7-6 (7-3) against Davis Cup
newcomer Thomas Johansson. Alonzo replaced Spanish second-string
Alex Corretja.
	   Bjorkman won Friday's first singles in four sets against
Corretja and teamed with Nicklas Kulti to win Saturday's doubles
that clinched Sweden's 12th trip to the finals.
	   The defending champions will face Italy, which took an
unbeatable 3-0 lead over the United States in the other semifinal
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the Dec. 4-6 final in Italy.
	   Last year, the Swedes trounced the United States 5-0 in the
final at Goteborg, Sweden.
	   Sweden is the most successful Davis Cup nation in the last two
decades with six wins. Former great Bjorn Borg led Sweden to its
first triumph in 1975 at Stockholm's Royal Tennis Hall, the site of
the semifinals against Spain.

<TEXT>
	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties won enough seats
in two-day national elections to be able to oust Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar if they join forces as pledged, according to
unofficial results released Sunday.
	   The results, based on full but unofficial tallies, may signal
the end of the authoritarian rule that has dominated this country
throughout its nearly six years of independence. The governing
party said it accepted them but was not giving up hope for leading
the next government.
	   Proclaiming victory, opposition party leaders huddled to try to
seal their informal alliance and put together a majority coalition
in Parliament, which elects both the prime minister and the
president.
	   They reiterated their intention to unite but said more
negotiations are needed before the coalition is set.

	   ZAGREB, Croatia (AP) _ Croatia's president is defending a
controversial cleric to be beatified by Pope John Paul II next
weekend, saying the late cardinal supported Croatia's Nazi-backed
wartime state but not its ``fascist methods.''
	   Cardinal Alojzije Stepinac was Zagreb's archbishop during World
War II, when a Croat puppet state persecuted tens of thousands of
Serbs, Jews, Gypsies and Croat opponents. The pontiff is to beatify
Stepinac on Saturday during a visit to Croatia.
	   The Simon Wiesenthal Center has asked the Vatican to postpone
Stepinac's beatification, a step in the lengthy process toward
sainthood, pending further study of his actions during World War
II.
	   ``Stepinac supported a right of Croatian people to have their
own state,'' Croatian President Franjo Tudjman told Sunday's
edition of the Roman Catholic magazine Mi. ``But he decisively
opposed ... fascist methods.''

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties won enough seats
in two-day national elections to be able to oust Prime Minister
Vladimir Meciar if they join forces as pledged, according to
unofficial results released Sunday.
	   The results, based on full but unofficial tallies, may signal
the end of the authoritarian rule that has dominated this country
throughout its nearly six years of independence. The governing
party said it accepted them but was not giving up hope for leading
the next government.
	   Proclaiming victory, opposition party leaders huddled to try to
seal their informal alliance and put together a majority coalition
in Parliament, which elects both the prime minister and the
president.
	   They reiterated their intention to unite but said more
negotiations are needed before the coalition is set.

 &UR; Ed: LEADS to UPDATE with new details of fighting &QL;

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Serbian forces have launched a new
offensive in southern Kosovo against armed ethnic Albanian rebels
who apparently regrouped in the area, Serb and Albanian sources
said Sunday.
	   A police source speaking on condition of anonymity said a number
of police units, including specially trained elite troops, have
begun a mop-up operation aimed at purging the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army from the area some 45 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of the province's capital Pristina.
	   The latest action followed a strong Serb offensive against KLA
rebels in another area _ Drenica _ located northwest of here. That
offensive came as the U.N. Security Council demanded an end to the
Serb crackdown and NATO finalized plans for airstrikes if unless
the fighting stops.
	   The separatists had suffered defeats in southern Kosovo earlier
this year, but apparently regrouped. According to the police
sources, the rebels recently kidnapped two local Serbs, a
25-year-old and a teenager, which prompted the new action.
	   In Kosovo, a province of Serbia, ethnic Albanians outnumber
Serbs 9 to 1 and nearly all demand independence. Hundreds have died
and about quarter of a million have become displaced since the
fighting erupted earlier this year.
	   The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb forces were
attacking from three directions near the towns of Suva Reka,
Urosevac and Stimlje southwest of Pristina.
	   According to the Albanians, the attack was focusing on 11
villages in the area, three of which were on fire Sunday. Albanian
sources said 47 Serb tanks and 57 trucks were seen massing in the
area late Saturday.

 &UR; EDS: ADDS Montgomerie QUOTES, details, RECASTS in parts &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   COLOGNE, Germany (AP) _ Colin Montgomerie's final putt Sunday
ended the hopes of several challengers as he captured the German
Masters by a stroke while firing a final round 67.
	   The Scotsman also took over as Europe's leading money-winner
when his six-foot par putt dropped on the final hole, staving off a
charging Vijah Singh and Sweden's Robert Karlsson.
	   ``I'm happy to be back,'' said an overjoyed Montgomerie, who
endured the deepest slump of his 12-year career earlier this
season.
	   Montgomerie, who had the lead wrestled away when Karlsson's
eight meter (25-foot) shot from the rough dropped in for a 13th
hole eagle, finished at 22-under 266 at the dlrs 1.68 million
event.
	   ``When Karlsson played a birdie and eagle, I came under the kind
of pressure where its hard to win,'' the Scotsman said. ``I know
now that I can again and that's good.''
	   Montgomerie, whose confidence had nosedived when he missed
several cuts in mid-season, has rebounded to win his second
tournament this month after the One 2 One British Masters.
	   Both Karlsson and Singh, the PGA Championship winner who
pressured the Scotsman by sinking two late birdies, finished at 267
with a final round 67.
	   Montgomerie's third title this year was worth dlrs 270,000 and
swept him past England's Lee Westwood on the earnings list. With
just two events left, he closed in on a record sixth straight
Order-of-Merit title.
	   The Scotsman led through most of the round until Karlsson,
riding five birdies, dropped his spectacular eagle on the par-5
13th hole to jump ahead by a stroke.
	   But Karlsson bogeyed the following hole, while the Scotsman
wrestled back the lead with birdies at the 13th and 15th holes.
	   ``That I could win two tournaments in four weeks is because my
putting is better, my hands are lighter,'' said Montgomerie.
	   But both Karlsson, who closed to a stroke again with a birdie
15th, and Singh kept the pressure on Montgomerie, forcing the final
winning putt for par.
	   Singh, playing his first European event since winning his major,
also sliced Montgomerie's lead to a stroke with his second straight
birdie on the 17th hole.
	   England's Steve Webster finished two strokes back at 268,
followed by Sweden's Per-Ulrik Johansson at 269 and Westwood, whose
271 was good for dlrs 53,000, dropping him 182,000 behind
Montgomerie on the Order-of-Merit.

Increase in tourism raising Iraq's hard-currency income
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Tourism has become Iraq's second largest
earner of foreign currency, with revenue likely to approach dlrs
480 million a year, diplomats in Baghdad said Sunday.
	   Most of the cash comes from Shiite Muslim pilgrims who come to
visit the shrines at Karbala and Najaf in southern Iraq, the
diplomats said.
	   They estimated that at least 25,000 Shiites were visiting the
shrines each month. These include about 15,000 Iranian Shiites who
began coming under an official program launched in mid-August,
according to an Iranian diplomat.
	   Small groups of tourists from France, Germany, Japan and other
countries also are coming to Iraq on special package tours, the
diplomats said.
	   They estimated tourism income at about dlrs 40 million a month.
As is usual in Baghdad, all the diplomats spoke on condition their
names not be used.
	   Oil is Iraq's largest foreign currency earner. Iraq expects to
earn dlrs 5 billion from crude oil sales this year under the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food program.
	   The program, an exception from U.N. trade sanctions, allows Iraq
to sell oil to buy needed food and medicine for its 20 million
people. The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   Most of the Shiite pilgrims are coming via Iran, including some
Pakistani and Azerbaijani nationals, the diplomats said. But others
travel via Syria and Jordan, they added.
	   A key site for Shiite pilgrims is Karbala, about 80 kilometers
(50 miles) southwest of Baghdad, where Imam Hussein, the grandson
of Islam's Prophet Mohammed is buried. Najaf 160 kilometers (100
miles) south of Baghdad, is where Imam Ali, the son-in-law of the
Prophet, is buried.

	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ Hours after authorities blocked an
opposition group meeting in the heart of Malaysia's capital Sunday,
more than 10,000 supporters of ousted deputy prime minister Anwar
Ibrahim gathered at another rally held on the outskirts of the
city.
	   People walked for several kilometers (miles) along a poorly-lit
village road to attend the rally organized by Malaysia's opposition
Islamic party after police prevented cars from entering the area,
about 20 kilometers (12 miles) northeast of Kuala Lumpur.
	   The meeting at the headquarters of the Parti Islam Se-Malaysia,
or PAS, was held after the planned launch of a coalition of
opposition parties and non-governmental groups promoting political
reform was canceled because of police pressure.
	   Opposition to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's firing and
subsequent arrest of Anwar, formerly his right-hand man and
designated successor, has sparked mass demonstrations and led to a
newfound sense of unity among political opposition groups in the
Southeast Asian country.
	   Earlier Sunday, the first meeting of The Coalition for People's
Democracy had to be called off because the hotel were the event was
to be held was pressured by police not to allow use of its hall by
activists, organizers said.
	   ``The government is sensitive to the latest developments and
pressured the hotel management to refuse the use the hall,'' said
Tien Chua, chairman of the coalition, an umbrella organization of
four opposition parties and 14 volunteer groups.
	   Hotel and police officials declined to comment on the incident.
	   ``The peoples' struggle to protect democracy and justice will be
a difficult and long one, but the truth will prevail,'' said Syed
Husin Ali, leader of the opposition Malaysian Peoples' Party.
	   The rally held later Sunday set up another reformist coalition
called the Malaysian Justice Movement. It, too, has the backing of
a group of opposition parties and non-governmental organizations.
	   One woman at the gathering, who declined to be named for fear of
arrest under the country's Internal Security Act, was heard
shouting out for the resignation of Malaysia's 72-year-old premier.
	   The security law has been used often in recent weeks to quell
the growing discontent with Mahathir's 17-year-rule.
	   Former deputy leader Anwar and 16 of his associates have been
held under the law, which dates from the era of British colonial
rule over the country and allows indefinite imprisonment without
trial. Neither Anwar, arrested last Sunday, nor any of his detained
allies have been formally arraigned in a court of law.
	   Anwar stands accused of crimes that include unlawful sex acts
and leaking state secrets. He has denied the charges, however,
saying they were politically motivated.
	   Anwar supporters have called on people to gather at Merdeka
Square, or Independence Square, on Monday, a national holiday.
	   The lush green park, one of Kuala Lumpur's tourist attractions,
was closed off to the public on Sunday, ostensibly for maintenance.
The announcement by the city hall came Saturday after police had
dispersed people that had gathered outside the square.
	   On Saturday, police beat demonstrators and used a water cannon
to disperse a rally of more than 3,000 people. Twenty-nine
Malaysians were arrested for gathering illegally, police said.
	   Even small public gatherings and outdoor assemblies in Malaysia
require police permits.

Karachi in deep trouble against Australia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By RIZWAN ALI &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 
 &UR; AP Photos KAR101-KAR102

<TEXT>
	   KARACHI, Pakistan (AP) _ Karachi faced defeat after Australia
set up an improbable victory target of 457 on the third day of the
four-day match Sunday.
	   Glenn McGrath struck early blows clean bowling hard-hitting
batsman Shahid Afridi for one and then dismissing night watchman
Atiquz Zaman on the last ball of the day. At stumps, Karachi had
its back to the wall at 11 for two, still needing a huge 446 on the
last day with eight wickets in hand.
	   Australia earlier in the day did not enforce the follow-on to
give its players batting practice ahead of the first Test against
Pakistan beginning Oct. 1 at Rawalpindi.
	   The visitors made a mammoth 540 for 9 declared in their first
innings with Michael Slater stroking a brilliant double century on
the first day.
	   Karachi, which required 391 runs to avoid a follow on, was
struggling at 192 for five when third day's play began Sunday. Its
innings folded 15 minutes before lunch at 278 with Waqar Younis
hammering nearly run-a-ball 41 which featured three towering sixes
off the bowling of off-spinner Gavin Robertson.
	   Medium fast McGrath (3-52), Michael Kasprowicz (3-67) and Stuart
MacGill (3-91) all were among the wickets that pleased Coach Geoff
Marsh. ``Our bowlers bowled to a disciplined line and length and I
think it's a very good start for them ahead of the three-Test
series against Pakistan.''
	   The Australian coach said that his team did not enforce the
follow-on because he wanted his batsmen to utilise maximum time
before the test. ``It's a very good sign that all our batsmen got
the maximum batting practice. Slater in the first innings was quite
impressive and so were Mark Waugh, Steve Waugh and Ricky Ponting.
	   ``Later today Justin Langer too played a good innings and scored
a fine century,'' he said.
	   With a commanding 262-run first innings lead at its back,
left-hander Justin Langer led the run charge for Australia with a
resolute century before captain Mark Taylor declared the second
innings at 194 for 2, half an hour before close.
	   Langer staked his Test claim with an impressive unbeaten 101 off
146 balls, inclusive of 11 fours and two big sixes off part-time
spinner Saeed Azad.
	   He was ably supported by wicketkeeper batsman Ian Healy, who
remained unbeaten on 45, and the two put on 92 runs for the
unfinished third wicket partnership.
	   Taylor, who scored just a single in his team's mammoth first
innings total, once again struggled a bit in making 19 runs but
coach Geoff Marsh hoped that the Australian captain would do much
better in the first Test.
	   ``Today he spent some time in the middle and I hope he would
play much longer in the first Test,'' Marsh, a former Australian
test opener, said.

U.S. composer stages world premiere of his new opera in Lisbon
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ America's best known living composer
Philip Glass won local acclaim for his new opera ``The White
Raven'', which had its world premiere this weekend at the Lisbon
world's fair.
	   ``A tranquil piece with magnificent moments,'' was how the Daily
Diario de Noticias on Sunday described the work performed the
previous evening.
	   The opera, directed and designed by Glass' usual partner Robert
Wilson, was staged to mark the final days of the Expo '98 world
fair, due to close Sept. 30.
	   ``It's a historic piece. It's serious and very moving
sometimes,'' Glass said.
	   The opera is expected to be staged in Madrid, Spain, in
November.

State vote in eastern Germany shows strength of extremist parties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to CLARIFY; ADDS quote
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Election
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ While Germany's two main parties
battled for control of the federal parliament Sunday, a state race
in the former communist east could provide political drama to
Germans concerned about smaller extreme parties on the right and
the left.
	   The ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism, which already
enjoys strong support in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, had its
first shot at being a part of a state government coalition.
	   The Social Democrats, who have been governing in a strained
coalition with the Christian Democrats, have said they will
consider the PDS as a partner if they win.
	   Polls show the Social Democrats at just under 40 percent _ 10
percent higher than 1994 _ due in part to their popular chancellor
candidate, Gerhard Schroeder. Kohl's Christian Democrats were
running close behind in the state.
	   The PDS was running about 20 percent.
	   Any government including the ex-communist party is a concern for
mainstream politicians in Bonn, who deride the party as the
remnants of the anti-democratic East German regime. But many
easterners feel the PDS better represents their interests in a
political system dominated by westerners.
	   ``They understand us better,'' said Elke Polkin, a 45-year-old
office worker who's been unemployed since 1996, when the company
she worked for went bankrupt. Besides, she said after voting in a
drab, concrete school building, ``not everything in East Germany
was bad.''
	   On the extreme-right, three rival parties were competing for
voters angry at unemployment running nearly 20 percent in the
state, the poorest in Germany. They capitalized on fears that
foreigners were taking jobs from Germans _ plastering streets with
posters demanding ``Work for Germans first!'' and ``Criminal
Foreigners Out!'' _ although less than 1 percent of the state's 1.8
million people are foreigners.
	   Pollsters put the support for the far-right at between 10
percent and 20 percent. And with the vote split, it was likely that
none of the parties would reach the 5-percent hurdle needed to
enter parliament.
	   But pollsters also suggested support could be higher, because
many surveyed won't admit backing the extreme right. That fear was
borne out in eastern Saxony-Anhalt state in the spring, when the
anti-foreigner German People's Union won a surprising 13 percent of
the vote.

Increase in tourism raising Iraq's hard-currency income
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By LEON BARKHO &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BAGHDAD, Iraq (AP) _ Tourism has become Iraq's second largest
earner of foreign currency, with revenue likely to approach dlrs
480 million a year, diplomats in Baghdad said Sunday.
	   Most of the cash comes from Shiite Muslim pilgrims who come to
visit the shrines at Karbala and Najaf in southern Iraq, the
diplomats said.
	   They estimated that at least 25,000 Shiites were visiting the
shrines each month. These include about 15,000 Iranian Shiites who
began coming under an official program launched in mid-August,
according to an Iranian diplomat.
	   Small groups of tourists from France, Germany, Japan and other
countries also are coming to Iraq on special package tours, the
diplomats said.
	   They estimated tourism income at about dlrs 40 million a month.
As is usual in Baghdad, all the diplomats spoke on condition their
names not be used.
	   Oil is Iraq's largest foreign currency earner. Iraq expects to
earn dlrs 5 billion from crude oil sales this year under the
U.N.-approved oil-for-food program.
	   The program, an exception from U.N. trade sanctions, allows Iraq
to sell oil to buy needed food and medicine for its 20 million
people. The sanctions were imposed after Iraq's 1990 invasion of
Kuwait.
	   Most of the Shiite pilgrims are coming via Iran, including some
Pakistani and Azerbaijani nationals, the diplomats said. Others
travel via Syria and Jordan.
	   A key site for Shiite pilgrims is Karbala, about 80 kilometers
(50 miles) southwest of Baghdad, where Imam Hussein, the grandson
of Islam's Prophet Mohammed is buried. Najaf 160 kilometers (100
miles) south of Baghdad, is where Imam Ali, the son-in-law of the
Prophet, is buried.

Jalabert considering pulling out of world championships
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The world's top-ranked cyclist, Laurent Jalabert,
says he is considering pulling out of next month's world
championships, saying he is exhausted and in poor health.
	   ``It's time to finish,'' the Frenchman was quoted as saying in
an interview published Sunday by sports daily L'Equipe. ``I'm
sinking. I'm tired, and what's more, I'm ill.''
	   ``I just don't feel like cycling,'' he added.
	   Jalabert, who has been struggling in the Tour of Spain, said he
had been suffering from bronchitis, but that he didn't want people
to think he was making excuses. He described health problems as,
``vagaries of life.''
	   He said that normally at this stage of the season he is still on
a high.
	   ``I always finish the Vuelta with my form on the up,'' he said.
``But this year it's the other way round. I'm telling myself that
if I can't play an important role (in the world championships) then
there's no point going.''

Italian League game held up by tear gas as fans clash in stands
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERUGIA, Italy (AP) _ The referee suspended play for about five
minutes during an Italian League game Sunday between Perugia and
Lazio of Rome after police tossed tear gas into the stands to quell
unruly spectators.
	   Fans, players and the referee himself had trouble seeing after
smoke drifted onto the field close to the end of the first half.
The referee held up play and then sent the teams to the locker
rooms without allowing for injury-time play.
	   The start of the second half was also delayed, while police
continued to battle with supporters of visiting Lazio in the stands
and outside the stadium.
	   No injuries were immediately reported.

State vote in eastern Germany shows strength of extremist parties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to CLARIFY; ADDS quote
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Election
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ While Germany's two main parties
battled for control of the federal parliament Sunday, a state race
in the former communist east could provide political drama to
Germans concerned about smaller extreme parties on the right and
the left.
	   The ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism, which already
enjoys strong support in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, had its
first shot at being a part of a state government coalition.
	   The Social Democrats, who have been governing in a strained
coalition with the Christian Democrats, have said they will
consider the PDS as a partner if they win.
	   Polls show the Social Democrats at just under 40 percent _ 10
percent higher than 1994 _ due in part to their popular chancellor
candidate, Gerhard Schroeder. Kohl's Christian Democrats were
running close behind in the state.
	   The PDS was running about 20 percent.
	   Any government including the ex-communist party is a concern for
mainstream politicians in Bonn, who deride the party as the
remnants of the anti-democratic East German regime. But many
easterners feel the PDS better represents their interests in a
political system dominated by westerners.
	   ``They understand us better,'' said Elke Polkin, a 45-year-old
office worker who's been unemployed since 1996, when the company
she worked for went bankrupt. Besides, she said after voting in a
drab, concrete school building, ``not everything in East Germany
was bad.''
	   On the extreme-right, three rival parties were competing for
voters angry at unemployment running nearly 20 percent in the
state, the poorest in Germany. They capitalized on fears that
foreigners were taking jobs from Germans _ plastering streets with
posters demanding ``Work for Germans first!'' and ``Criminal
Foreigners Out!'' _ although less than 1 percent of the state's 1.8
million people are foreigners.
	   Pollsters put the support for the far-right at between 10
percent and 20 percent. And with the vote split, it was likely that
none of the parties would reach the 5-percent hurdle needed to
enter parliament.
	   But pollsters also suggested support could be higher, because
many surveyed won't admit backing the extreme right. That fear was
borne out in eastern Saxony-Anhalt state in the spring, when the
anti-foreigner German People's Union won a surprising 13 percent of
the vote.

Despite NATO threats of intervention, violence rages on in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside NATO threats, Serbian
forces have launched a new offensive in southern Kosovo against
ethnic Albanian rebels who apparently regrouped in the area, Serb
and Albanian sources said Sunday.
	   A police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
number of police units, including specially trained elite troops,
have begun a mop-up operation aimed at purging the secessionist
Kosovo Liberation Army from the area some 45 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of the province's capital Pristina.
	   The latest action followed a strong Serb offensive against KLA
rebels in another area _ Drenica _ located northwest of here. That
offensive came as the U.N. Security Council last week demanded an
end to the Serb crackdown and NATO finalized plans for airstrikes
if unless the fighting stops.
	   In Bosnia-Herzegovina, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
repeated warnings that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has
only ``a short period of time'' to comply with international
demands to end the Kosovo conflict.
	   ``A failure to do so presents the possibility that a military
operation against Mr. Milosevic would be necessary,'' Cohen told
reporters in Sarajevo. ``A failure to do so on his part will be met
with very strong NATO action in my judgment.''
	   The separatists have suffered defeats in southern Kosovo earlier
this year, but apparently regrouped. According to the police
sources, the rebels recently kidnapped two local Serbs, a
25-year-old and a teenager, which prompted the new action.
	   In Kosovo, a province of Serbia, ethnic Albanians outnumber
Serbs 9 to 1 and nearly all demand independence. Hundreds have died
and about quarter of a million have become displaced since the
fighting erupted earlier this year.
	   The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb forces were
attacking from three directions near the towns of Suva Reka,
Urosevac and Stimlje southwest of Pristina.
	   According to the Albanians, the attack was focusing on 11
villages in the area, three of which were on fire Sunday. Albanian
sources said 47 Serb tanks and 57 trucks were seen massing in the
area late Saturday.
	   An estimated 15,000 civilians are believed trying to flee the
area, adding to an already grave humanitarian situation throughout
the province.
	   The Serbian troops are by far stronger militarily than the
rebels but are stretched thin in Kosovo's rugged countryside. The
Serbs have had trouble maintaining control over the areas from
which they drive out the rebels, mostly local farmers recruited by
the KLA.
	   Also Sunday, British politician, Paddy Ashdown, leader of
Liberal Democrats, arrived in Kosovo for a tour of the war zones.
He is expected to meet Milosevic, who is widely blamed for ordering
the ruthless actions against the rebels.
	   The Serb Media Center said three policemen were killed Saturday
and seven on Friday. Five of the seven died when their car hit a
land mine.
	   The continued violence in Kosovo has led Western powers to
threaten Milosevic with a NATO intervention in Kosovo unless
violence ends. The alliance has finalized plans to hit strategic
targets throughout Serbia, the dominant republic of present-day
Yugoslavia.
	   On Saturday, Cohen and European defense ministers, meeting in
neighboring Macedonia, reiterated the warning, saying ``We should
take action sooner rather than later in the event that Mr.
Milosevic doesn't respond.''
	   Also on Saturday, the top U.N. official for refugees, Sadako
Ogata, visited in Kosovo some of the most affected by the fighting
and warned of the likely humanitarian disaster when winter takes
on.
	   The West has coupled the threats of intervention with efforts to
make the two sides reach a negotiated solution, but without visible
results so far.
	   While Milosevic has agreed in principle to grant a degree of
autonomy to Kosovo, his forces continue to battle the
``terrorists'' and deem NATO threats unjustified.
	   A close Milosevic aide, Yugoslav deputy premier Nikola Sainovic,
on Saturday reiterated the government, while ready for negotiations
with Kosovo Albanians, would nevertheless defend ``integrity of the
country.''

operation against Mr. Milosevic would be necessary,'' Cohen told
reporters in Sarajevo. ``A failure to do so on his part will be met
with very strong NATO action in my judgment.''
	   The separatists have suffered defeats in southern Kosovo earlier
this year, but apparently regrouped. According to the police
sources, the rebels recently kidnapped two local Serbs, a
25-year-old and a teenager, which prompted the new action.
	   In Kosovo, a province of Serbia, ethnic Albanians outnumber
Serbs 9 to 1 and nearly all demand independence. Hundreds have died
and about quarter of a million have become displaced since the
fighting erupted earlier this year.
	   The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb forces were
attacking from three directions near the towns of Suva Reka,
Urosevac and Stimlje southwest of Pristina.
	   According to the Albanians, the attack was focusing on 11
villages in the area, three of which were on fire Sunday. Albanian
sources said 47 Serb tanks and 57 trucks were seen massing in the
area late Saturday.
	   An estimated 15,000 civilians are believed trying to flee the
area, adding to an already grave humanitarian situation throughout
the province.
	   The Serbian troops are by far stronger militarily than the
rebels but are stretched thin in Kosovo's rugged countryside. The
Serbs have had trouble maintaining control over the areas from
which they drive out the rebels, mostly local farmers recruited by
the KLA.
	   The Serb Media Center said three policemen were killed Saturday
and seven on Friday. Five of the seven died when their car hit a
land mine.
	   The continued violence in Kosovo has led Western powers to
threaten Milosevic with NATO intervention in Kosovo unless violence
ends. The alliance has finalized plans to hit strategic targets
throughout Serbia, the dominant republic of present-day Yugoslavia.
	   On Saturday, the top U.N. official for refugees, Sadako Ogata,
visited areas most affected by the fighting and warned of the
likely humanitarian disaster when winter takes on.
	   While Milosevic has agreed in principle to grant a degree of
autonomy to Kosovo, his forces continue to battle the
``terrorists'' and deem NATO threats unjustified.

Zimbabwe in strong position in second one-day international against
</HEADLINE>
India

<TEXT>
	   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) _ Zimbabwe cricket captain Alistair
Campbell raced to his second big quickfire innings against India in
two days Sunday, scoring 74 off 82 balls to add to his 53 in 41
balls Saturday.
	   He also partnered Murray Goodwin, who made 66, to a 125 runs
second wicket partnership and this enabled Zimbabwe to reach a
respectable 237-7 after Mohamad Azharuddin again put them into bat
after winning the toss.
	   Play in the second of three one day cricket internationals was
curtailed from 50 overs to 45 following unseasonal overnight rain
at Queens Club in the second city of Bulawayo.
	   The Indian bowling lacked the penetration which featured in
their victory over Zimbabwe yesterday and the fielding was somewhat
below par.
	   Campbell is undoubtedly the form player for Zimbabwe and he
thrives on the captaincy. He struck a six and six fours, the six
being taken off Harbhajan Singh's second ball with a premeditated
straight drive.
	   He has now reached 2,000 runs in one-day international cricket.
He appeared to be set for his third century but he holed out to
Saurav Ganguly a yard (meter) inside the long off boundary.
	   Goodwin began slowly in giving Campbell most of the strike, but
when he got going he was full of good shots, particularly off his
legs.
	   None of the Indian bowlers were quite able to gain any
initiative and runs flowed from the middle order following on the
good start, as opposed to the first match yesterday when Zimbabwe
struggled.
	   Azharuddin's men may find it much more difficult this time to
win and take an unassailable 2-0 lead in the series.

	   PONCE, Puerto Rico (AP) _ On the dusty, sun-drenched hill called
Diamond Point, people are used to fending for themselves. They're
squatters, living on property the government doesn't develop and
insurers refuse to protect.
	   ``We have to rely on each other here,'' said resident Luz Vidro,
holding a clipboard as local volunteers scoured the wreckage left
by Hurricane Georges, carefully recording their neighbors' needs
from the aid mission they hoped would arrive.
	   Diamond Point, with its dazzling view of the Caribbean, was a
picture of devastation. Homes that survived dozens of eviction
notices were smashed into kindling. Plastic cisterns built to
supplement spotty water service were crushed like paper cups.
	   About 500 families have lived on this hill since the 1980s, when
a shortage of low-cost housing in southern Puerto Rico prompted
them to build their own wooden homes in the barren countryside.
	   ``Here, at least, I had four walls to call my own,'' said
Francisco Collazo Santiago, 41. He laughed and added: ``Of course,
now I don't have a roof.''
	   Below, in the nearby town of Ponce, government workers were
busily feeding hundreds of refugees in shelters, clearing downed
trees and repairing utility lines.
	   Miriam Colon said her family of five preferred sleeping under
half a roof to a government shelter.
	   She said her deep mistrust of authorities stems from the
repeatedly unkept promises by politicians to develop Diamond Point
_ to buy the land from the real estate holding company that owns it
and give it to residents.
	   Ponce mayor Rafael Cordero Santiago claims the area's planned
development has been held up by the central government _ run by a
rival party _ for political reasons. The administration of Gov.
Pedro Rossello claims it supports the development, but can't agree
on a price for the land with the owners.
	   Meanwhile, the squatters have battled eviction notices while
officials produced halfhearted, bureaucratic gestures like the
renaming of would-be streets.
	   Armando Rodriguez, 39, said government surveyors visited a
half-dozen times over the years, speaking of never-implemented
plans to install sidewalks and drainage on roads residents carved
through the bramble, only a few of which are paved.
	   ``Every time, they give my street a new name _ once it was Jade
Street, then it was Sixth Street,'' he said. ``They've changed the
number of my house five times. When the Red Cross people asked me
my address after the hurricane, I couldn't even remember it.''
	   Insurance companies won't insure illegal homes, so some
residents were planning to dip into their savings to rebuild.
Others said they were relying on the Federal Emergency Management
Agency for aid.
	   Across the hill, family members in town were bringing some
residents water and food. One neighbor helped another spread a
bright blue tarpaulin across a hole in his roof.
	   Rodriguez's wooden house was one of the few left untouched on
the hill. It was held in place, he proudly reported, by a dozen
nylon ropes he had tossed over the roof and lashed _ tent-style _
to metal eyelets set in the concrete foundation.
	   An electric generator rattled as Rodriguez prepared to lift a
plastic cistern onto the roof.
	   ``You learn to do things for yourself around here,'' he said.

Financial secretary embarks on Europe-US tour
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   HONG KONG (AP) - Hong Kong Financial Secretary Donald Tsang left
Sunday for a three-week mission to Europe and the United States to
explain the government's intervention in the stock market.
	   During his visit to Germany, the Netherlands, United States, and
Britain, Tsang will meet with finance ministers and central
bankers.
	   Earlier this month, U.S. Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan
Greenspan criticised Hong Kong for its intervention in the stock
markets.
	   Greenspan said the intervention has eroded ``some of the
extraordinary credibility that the Hong Kong authorities have
achieved over the years.''
	   On Saturday, Tsang said he did not think he would have a tough
time justfying the government's action last month to prop up share
prices and defend the Hong Kong dollar, which is pegged at 7.80 to
the U.S. currency.
	   ``Sentiments around the world have changed over the past few
weeks on what we should do about monitoring the flow of hedge
funds,'' he said. Hedge funds make speculative bets with money from
wealthy investors.
	   Speculators have played on the currency peg's connection to
local interest rates to drive rates higher and share prices lower,
in an attempt to break the peg.
	   Tsang said he will reiterate Hong Kong's committment to free and
open markets.
	   ``Hong Kong is still one of the freest and most
liberally-regulated markets in the world,'' he said.
	   During his stay in the United States, Tsang will also attend the
annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and the Word
Bank in Washington on Oct. 6-8.
	   He will then fly to London before returning home on Oct. 20.

US defense secretary visits Bosnia

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen praised the progress made so far in rebuilding Bosnia
and promised continued U.S. help Sunday to all groups that support
the U.S.-brokered peace agreement that ended the 3 1-2 -year war.
	   ``Today, hope has replaced fear and life has replaced death and
building is now replacing destruction,'' Cohen told reporters at
the end of a one-day visit. The secretary said he was impressed
with the amount of progress since his last visit in 1996.
	   Cohen, who flew here from Italy, met commanders of the NATO-led
peace force and top international mediators overseeing the
political and economic reconstruction of the country after the
1992-1995 war.
	   It was the first visit by a U.S. Cabinet member since this
month's national elections, in which an ultranationalist beat the
U.S.-backed candidate for a key post in the Bosnian Serb entity.
	   That raised questions about the success of the multimillion
dollar international effort to implement terms of the 1995 Dayton
accords which ended the bloody conflict.
	   But Cohen said the Clinton Administration was pleased with the
overall results of the Sept. 12-13 election because of the strong
showing of moderate parties in other races.
	   ``Let me say that the United States is prepared to work with all
of the newly elected officials as long as they support the Dayton
accords and do so not only with their words but also by their
deeds,'' he said.
	   On Friday, international officials who supervised the election
confirmed that ultranationalist Nikola Poplasen had won election as
president of the Bosnian Serb republic.
	   Poplasen promised to preserve ``all the good that the
international community and the previous moderate Serb government
accomplished'' and strive for a democratic society based on a
market economy.
	   However, Poplasen has also said that the Dayton accord war never
envisioned the same kind of single state for Bosnia's Serbs, Croats
and Muslims as the Americans and other Western countries insist it
does.
	   U.S. officials have indicated that they're looking for tangible
evidence that Poplasen is ready to fulfill all commitments of
Dayton.
	   ``We have to wait and see whether he will match those rhetorical
promises with actual commitment,'' Cohen said. ``The challenge now
is to accelerate civil implementation'' of the peace accord, Cohen
said.
	   He said Washington is demanding more progress on such issues as
the return of refugees to areas from which they were driven during
the war by rival groups.
	   Cohen said the Muslim-dominated Bosnian capital Sarajevo stands
as the best example of both the problems and progress in
implementing the Dayton accord.
	   He cited improvements in the economy and reconstruction but also
noted that not all Bosnian Serb and Croat refugees have been able
to return here.
	   ``Sarajevo is not the cosmopolitan multiethnic city that it once
was, not yet,'' Cohen said before returning to Italy.
	   NATO and Western powers have ``sown the seeds of peace and
prosperity in Bosnia and now those seeds must be cultivated and
harvested by Bosnians themselves,'' he said.
	   Shortly before Cohen's arrival, NATO announced its peacekeepers
arrested a Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect, Stevan Todorovic, in
the northern town of Bosnaski Samac.
	   NATO's failure to arrest key war crimes suspects, notably former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, is often cited as one of the
reasons for slow progress in implementing the Dayton accords.

Hakkinen wins Luxembourg Grand Prix ahead of Schumacher

<TEXT>
	   NUERBURGRING, Germany (AP) _ Mika Hakkinen raced ahead of
Michael Schumacher after a pit stop Sunday and held off his only
rival for the Formula One championship to win the Luxembourg Grand
Prix and take a four-point lead into the final race of the season.
	   In the Japanese Grand Prix in Suzuka on Nov. 1, a second place
will guarantee Hakkinen his first Formula One title.
	   ``Yes, indeed, this win is fantastic,'' said the Finn, who turns
30 Monday. ``It makes my situation a lot different than it was two
hours ago.''
	   Hakkinen picked up 10 points for his seventh win of the season
in a McLaren-Mercedes to open a four-point lead over Schumacher,
90-86. The two drivers went into the race tied on 80 points.
	   Schumacher, who started the 67-lap race from the pole in his
Ferrari, led in the early stage, cheered by 140,000 home fans on
election day in Germany.
	   Although the race is officially called the Luxembourg Grand
Prix, it is actually held across the border in Germany, an hour's
drive away from Schumacher's home town of Kerpen.
	   Schumacher made his first pit stop for fuel and new tires on lap
25 and Hakkinen zoomed into the lead.
	   Hakkinen, who had earlier passed Schumacher's Ferrari teammate
Eddie Irvine to move from third to second, made his stop on lap 28
and came out just ahead of Schumacher, who had been slowed down by
traffic.
	   Schumacher pitted for the second time on lap 48, Hakkinen one
lap later and the Finn again came out ahead of the German.
	   ``Our race strategy proved to be right and the team did a
fantastic job in the pit stops to get me out ahead of Michael on
both occasions,'' Hakkinen said.
	   Hakkinen managed to keep a gap of about five seconds over
Schumacher and the German never came into a position to really
challenge Hakkinen.
	   The Finn finished the race distance of 305.235 kilometers
(189.667 miles) in one hour, 32 minutes, 14.789 seconds, beating
Schumacher by 2.2 seconds at the checkered flag.
	   ``It was great to win today, but nothing is over yet,'' said
Hakkinen, who now has eight career wins. ``The fight continues and
we have to have very good preparation for the final race.''
	   Schumacher conceded that he had no chance once he ended up
behind Hakkinen following both pit stops.
	   ``After the first pit stop, we had no chance,'' Schumacher said.
``I was quite surprised that he came out ahead. I knew it would be
tight but I thought I could still be ahead.''
	   ``All in all I am surely a bit disappointed,'' said Schumacher,
who is chasing his third Formula One title and trying to become the
first Ferrari driver to become champion since Jody Scheckter in
1979.
	   ``But we are four points behind and it's still not lost,'' the
29-year-old German said.
	   McLaren also leads in the constructors' standings, 142-127 over
Ferrari.
	   ``It was probably the most important race in the history of the
company,'' said McLaren chief Ron Dennis.
	   ``Today's race puts in a very strong position for the
constructors' championship and of course gives Mika the opportunity
to win the world championship,'' Dennis said.
	   The McLaren cars improved dramatically in the race, after
lagging behind the Ferraris in practice and qualifying.
	   Irvine upstaged Schumacher by getting off to a faster start and
grabbing the lead. But before the first lap was over, Irvine made a
mistake in a turn and Schumacher went ahead.
	   Hakkinen finally passed Irvine on lap 14 and was closing in on
Schumacher even before the first pit stop, consistently clocking
fastest laps.
	   ``I could not push as hard as I wanted to because the car was
not perfect,'' Schumacher said.
	   David Coulthard in the second McLaren was third, while Irvine
finished fourth.
	   Heinz-Harald Frentzen in a Williams was fifth, while Giancarlo
Fisichella in a Benetton finished sixth.
	   Dark clouds threatened throughout the race, but the weather
stayed dry.

Leftist setback for Blair at start of Labor annual conference
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With AP Photos &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Britain's governing Labor Party opened
its annual conference Sunday with left-wing victories in party
elections _ marking the first setback for Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his centrist policies.
	   Left-wingers, who see themselves as standard-bearers of the
socialist policies ditched by Blair's ``New Labor,'' took four of
the six places chosen by rank-and-file members on the party's
32-member National Executive Committee.
	   ``It clearly shows they (party members) want to increase taxes
and public spending and bring down interest rates,'' said leftist
lawmaker Ken Livingstone when the result of the ballot was
announced at the start of the six-day conference in this north
England town.
	   The victorious candidates included Liz Davies, a left-wing
lawyer barred by the party hierarchy from running for Parliament in
May 1997 national elections although she had won a nomination for a
solid Labor district.
	   Blair, however, remained in firm control of the governing body.
Most of the other seats will go, or are likely to go in ballots
announced during the week, to his supporters _ some his nominees
and others elected by trade unions and lawmakers.
	   Trade unions remain major funders of the party, despite Blair's
wooing of big business before his landslide election victory in
1997 which ended 18 years of Conservative Party rule.
	   The leftists, running on a joint ticket called Grassroots
Alliance, did well despite a 15,000-pound (dlrs 25,000) campaign
funded by the electricians' union, a moderate labor union and the
second largest in the country, to get six Blair loyalists elected.
The union paid a telephone canvassing company to call round
members.
	   Only 133,597 members voted _ a turnout of 35 percent.
	   Earlier, Blair stressed he will stick to an economic program
whose main objective is a Conservative-style drive to hold
inflation to 2.5 percent.
	   ``This is a government for the long term and we won't buy
short-term popularity at the expense of long-term prosperity,'' he
said writing in the mass circulation Sunday newspaper, the News of
the World.
	   Several thousand farmers demonstrated in Blackpool as delegates
arrived. Like many industrialists and labor union leaders, they are
upset about the high value of the British pound which makes exports
expensive.
	   Blair has turned over the responsibility for setting interest
rates _ now 7.5 percent and making the pound even more attractive
to investors _ to the Bank of England. Its political instructions
are to hold down inflation.
	   ``We need a government policy that adds up to something more
than disaster,'' National Farmers' Union leader Ben Gill said,
addressing the protestors in a soccer field.

Report: Hostage taker choked on vomit in prison hospital
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   ATHENS, Greece (AP) _ An escaped convict captured in a bloody
and bungled police raid later choked to death on his own vomit in a
prison hospital, according to a preliminary autopsy report Sunday.
	   A finding suggesting a natural cause in the Saturday death of
Sorin Matei could reduce some of the intense pressure on police and
the government, accused of incompetence in the ill-fated raid late
Wednesday to free a family held hostage by the 27-year-old
fugitive. Twelve people, including the former police chief and one
of the hostages, were injured when a hand grenade that was carried
by Matei exploded. Authorities had decided the hand grenade was
fake.
	   But some questions raised by government critics still remain
open, including why Matei was not continually monitored in the
maximum-security prison medical ward and whether he was too heavily
sedated. When he was transferred to the prison from public
hospital, Matei was considered to be lightly injured although he
had been continuously sedated since his arrest.
	   The preliminary autopsy report came following examinations by
two medical examiners and a private doctor hired by Matei's family.
Additional details were expected in coming days, including a
toxicology report.
	   The series of missteps by police in the hunt for Matei has
proved extremely embarrassing for security forces and could deepen
into a major political quagmire for Premier Costas Simitis. The
police chief has already been replaced and there have been growing
calls for higher-level dismissals.
	   The four-hour hostage drama was followed live by Greek
television viewers in an unprecedented broadcast. Matei called the
anchorman of a private television station to give his demands over
the air.
	   Matei, convicted of attempted murder and armed robberies, had
been on the run since he escaped from custody in July.
	   On Sept. 6, he used a hand grenade to take a police officer
hostage for almost eight hours before security forces released him.
He fled in a taxi and police were unable to track him down until
Wednesday, when they located him hiding inside an apartment
building near the capital's red light district.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ A bastion of authoritarian rule in
Central Europe appeared set to collapse Sunday after election
results showed most Slovak voters rejecting the government of
Vladimir Meciar.
	   The leaders of four opposition parties huddled and agreed to
seal their informal alliance after full, unofficial results
indicated they had won 93 of the 150 seats in Parliament. They said
they expect to form a governing coalition after more negotiations.
	   ``Slovakia has voted for change,'' declared top opposition
leader Mikulas Dzurinda, head of the Slovak Democratic Coalition.
``The opposition has won a constitutional majority.''
	   The results put the 43-year-old Dzurinda in position to replace
Meciar as prime minister if the opposition alliance can withstand
what promises to be weeks of political pressure and hard
bargaining.
	   The governing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) said
that while it accepted the results, it was not giving up hope for
putting together a majority to lead the next government. As the top
vote-getting party, it has one month to crack the opposition unity
and lure away deputies into its own coalition.
	   But noting its bleak chances for allies, others in Slovakia and
abroad said the results appear to signal the end of the
authoritarian rule that has dominated Slovakia throughout its
nearly six years of independence.
	   Czech President Vaclav Havel said the vote provided a mandate
for bolstering democracy in neighboring Slovakia, which split from
Czechoslovakia in 1993.
	   ``I hope and I believe that the young Slovak state is on the
right track,'' he said in a telegram to Dzurinda.
	   Western vote monitors praised the 84 percent turnout in the
two-day parliamentary election and said the balloting appeared to
have been carried out correctly. They stopped short of declaring
them free and fair until after official results are announced,
expected Monday night or Tuesday.
	   The Central Election Commission, however, said the figures it
released Sunday, the day after voting finished, should remain
virtually unchanged.
	   Meciar's hard-line HZDS was first with 27 percent of the vote,
based on the unofficial results, giving it 43 seats in Parliament.
	   The Slovak Democratic Coalition was right behind with 26.3
percent and 42 seats, and two other opposition parties came next.
The Party of the Democratic Left, former Communists, got 14.7
percent to earn 23 seats. The Hungarian Coalition Party,
representing Slovakia's largest minority ethnic group, had 9.1
percent for 15 seats.
	   A fourth party that has declared its intent to join in an
opposition alliance, the six-month-old Party of Civic
Understanding, got 8 percent for 13 seats. Its leaders, like those
of the other three, said they would never join a Meciar coalition.
	   All told, the opposition alliance got 58 percent of the vote.
But discounting the votes for the 11 parties that did receive the
minimum 5 percent needed to qualify, its share of seats is boosted
to a key 62 percent _ more than the three-fifths constitutional
majority needed to elect a president.
	   Slovakia has been without a president since March, when Michal
Kovac's term expired and Meciar assumed most of his powers. Kovac
could return in the post under an opposition alliance.
	   ``The majority of people showed a desire for big political
change, and an interest to enter the European Union and NATO,''
Kovac said Sunday. ``This is an important turning point for
Slovakia.''
	   Meciar's weakened HZDS fared significantly worse than in 1994
elections, and so did its main partner in the ruling coalition. The
ultranationalist Slovak National Party, whose billboards denounce
minority Hungarians and Gypsies as ``parasites,'' got 9 percent for
13 seats.
	   Opposition parties already had proclaimed victory and celebrated
with champagne Saturday, based on similar exit poll numbers and a
sampling of unofficial results.
	   But it's too early to proclaim the political demise of Meciar,
whose anti-democratic practices have left Slovakia diplomatically
isolated in Central Europe. He is still likely to lead the largest
party faction in Parliament.
	   ``We accept the results of the elections,'' said Sergej Kozlik,
the ruling party's vice chairman, focusing on the HZDS' apparent
finish atop the list of parties.
	   ``Our goal is to have a majority in Parliament, but we will see
later if that will become true.''

	   SARAJEVO, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ U.S. Defense Secretary
William Cohen praised the progress made so far in rebuilding Bosnia
and promised continued U.S. help Sunday to all groups that support
the U.S.-brokered peace agreement that ended the 3 1-2 -year war.
	   It was the first visit by a U.S. Cabinet member since this
month's national elections, in which an ultranationalist beat the
U.S.-backed candidate for a key post in the Bosnian Serb entity.
	   ``Today, hope has replaced fear and life has replaced death and
building is now replacing destruction,'' Cohen told reporters at
the end of a one-day visit. The secretary said he was impressed
with the amount of progress since his last visit in 1996.
	   Cohen, who flew here from Italy, met commanders of the NATO-led
peace force and top international mediators overseeing the
political and economic reconstruction of the country after the
1992-1995 war.
	   Ultranationalist Nikola Poplasen's election raised questions
about the success of the multimillion dollar international effort
to implement terms of the 1995 Dayton accords which ended the
bloody conflict.
	   But Cohen said the Clinton Administration was pleased with the
overall results of the Sept. 12-13 election because of the strong
showing of moderate parties in other races.
	   ``Let me say that the United States is prepared to work with all
of the newly elected officials as long as they support the Dayton
accords and do so not only with their words but also by their
deeds,'' he said.
	   Poplasen has promised to preserve ``all the good that the
international community and the previous moderate Serb government
accomplished'' and strive for a democratic society based on a
market economy.
	   However, Poplasen has also said that the Dayton accord war never
envisioned the same kind of single state for Bosnia's Serbs, Croats
and Muslims as the Americans and other Western countries insist it
does.
	   ``We have to wait and see whether he will match those rhetorical
promises with actual commitment,'' Cohen said. ``The challenge now
is to accelerate civil implementation'' of the peace accord, Cohen
said.
	   He said Washington is demanding more progress on such issues as
the return of refugees to areas from which they were driven during
the war by rival groups.
	   Cohen said the Muslim-dominated Bosnian capital Sarajevo stands
as the best example of both the problems and progress in
implementing the Dayton accord.
	   He cited improvements in the economy and reconstruction but also
noted that not all Bosnian Serb and Croat refugees have been able
to return here.
	   ``Sarajevo is not the cosmopolitan multiethnic city that it once
was, not yet,'' Cohen said before returning to Italy.
	   NATO and Western powers have ``sown the seeds of peace and
prosperity in Bosnia and now those seeds must be cultivated and
harvested by Bosnians themselves,'' he said.
	   Shortly before Cohen's arrival, NATO announced its peacekeepers
arrested a Bosnian Serb war crimes suspect, Stevan Todorovic, in
the northern town of Bosnaski Samac.
	   NATO's failure to arrest key war crimes suspects, notably former
Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, is often cited as one of the
reasons for slow progress in implementing the Dayton accords.

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder's Social Democrats looked
headed for victory in Germany's national election Sunday, according

U.S. cyclist Armstrong storms back from cancer sickness
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Virtually written off a year ago, U.S.
rider Lance Armstrong has shown he's racing back to the top in
championship cycling when he finished fourth in a grueling 22-day
Tour of Spain on Sunday.
	   The result was the best the 27-year-old Texan has ever had in a
major cycling tour.
	   Armstrong was diagnosed with testicular cancer in October 1996.
The cancer spread to his lungs and brain forcing him to take
extensive chemotherapy treatment.
	   Snubbed by the French team Cofidis, Armstrong stayed away from
competition for nearly a year but came back this season riding with
modest U.S. Postal Service team.
	   ``Armstrong is the best symbol of the struggle against the
impossible,'' Banesto cycling team coach Jose Miguel Echavarri said
this week.
	   Tour of Spain champion Abraham Olano said: ``He's gone somewhat
unnoticed, but his case must be given the praise it deserves.''
	   Armstrong finished 2 minutes, 18 seconds behind Olano in the
overall standings and missed the glory of the podium by one place.
	   He broke away from the pack and moved into the race's top 10 as
early as the ninth stage and stayed there.
	   On Saturday, he showed that even after 20 days he was still in
fine fettle when he finished third in an individual time trial,
eight seconds behind two-time defending Spanish tour champion Alex
Zuelle of Switzerland and seven behind Olano.
	   That performance shot him up to the No. 4 in the overall
standings, leading the Spanish daily El Mundo to describe him
Sunday as ``The race's other winner.''
	   He finished one place and 19 seconds ahead of world No. 1
Laurent Jalabert of France.
	   Armstrong was just beginning to make a good impression in the
fiercely competitive cycling world prior to the cancer blow. He was
world road racing champion in 1993 and took a stage in the Tour de
France the same year and then again in 1995.
	   This season, prior to the Spanish tour, he won the Tour of
Luxembourg in June and finished fourth in the Tour of Netherlands
two months later.
	   He skipped the recent Tour de France preferring to cycle in
Spain, following which he hopes to race the Paris-Tours and then
the world championships in the Netherlands in October.

Iranians debate government position on Rushdie
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ British writer Salman Rushdie sees new
safety for himself in Iran's distancing itself from the Islamic
edict calling for his murder, but many in Iran are debating whether
anything has really changed.
	   On Sunday, both newspapers and ordinary Iranians debated the
announcement made in New York Thursday by Iran's foreign minister
distancing his government from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for
Rushdie's death.
	   The hard-line Jomhuri Eslami said in an editorial that the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's ``fatwa,'' or Islamic edict, calling
for Rushdie's death was still applicable.
	   ``Any promise in this regard... is a personal interpretation and
has nothing to do with the Islamic Republic. There is no room for
optimism by Rushdie and his supporters,'' the paper said.
	   The Iran News, a moderate daily close to the foreign ministry,
said there was nothing new in Kharrazi's statement that his
``government disassociates itself from any reward ... and does not
support it.'' It pointed out that the government's position has for
several years been not to seek Rushdie's death.
	   The difference, however, was that ``Britain has now decided that
is sufficient for normalization of relations. Britain feels left
out of lucrative business deals Iran has struck with other European
countries,'' said the daily.
	   Ordinary Iranians also had mixed reactions to the announcement.
	   ``I think it's best that the government takes a stand on this
issue. What they did was logical and smart,'' said Amir
Mohammad-Nejad, a 29-year-old university student.
	   Fariba Saddiq, a 38-year old secretary, said Iran's position was
inevitable given President Mohammad Khatami's overtures to the West
since he took office last year.
	   However, she added: ``The world should realize the fatwa is
irrevocable.''
	   The Rushdie affair has been the main hurdle in Iran's efforts to
improve ties with the European Union. Britain has sought better
ties in order to benefit from lucrative projects in Iran, which
have gone to France and other European countries that have better
ties with Tehran.
	   Iran has been trying to change its foreign policy ever since
Khatami, a moderate cleric, became president in August 1997.
Khatami has underscored the need to replace confrontation with
dialogue in Iran's relations with the West, including the United
States.
	   But powerful hard-liners inside the Islamic regime have always
supported the death sentence and are likely to continue to do so.
	   Although relieved at Iran's announcement of distancing itself
from the reward for his death, the 51-year-old Rushdie said he was
still cautious since the fatwa itself was not lifted.
	   ``I feel there is a small, continued need for caution'' but
``this can be dealt with without the colossal apparatus of state
protection,'' he said a day after Kharrazi's announcement.
	   Rushdie has spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini
called for his death on Feb. 14, 1989, claiming his book, ``The
Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam.
	   In Pakistan, Islamic groups were outraged at Iran for softening
its stand toward Rushdie and some Sunni Muslim groups questioned
the legitimacy of Shiite Islam, the dominant sect in Iran.
	   ``The Iranian brand of Islam has been exposed,'' Sheik Hakim,
chief of Sunni Muslim militant Sipah-e-Sahaba, or the Guardians of
the Friends of the Prophet, said Saturday. ``According to Islam,
Rushdie is liable to death but Iran is changing its stance for
worldly gains.''
	   ``If Iran withdraws its decision, this means the country is
contradicting its faith and fundamental principles of Islam,'' said
Shah Faridul Haq, vice president of the right wing religious party
the Jamiat Ulema-e-Pakistan.

Lazio still winless after wild draw at Perugia
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Tear gas, two expulsions, another goal by Japanese
midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata, a spectacular free kick by Yugoslav
Sinisa Mihajlovic.
	   There was a little bit of everything in Sunday's Italian League
game between Perugia and Lazio of Rome. Everything, that is, except
talent-laden Lazio's first win of the season.
	   The match ended 2-2 as Lazio salvaged a draw _ its third
straight _ on Mihajlovic's curling, 30-meter (-yard) strike, which
found the roof of the net with 18 minutes remaining. Perugia had
led 2-1 in the 64th minute on Nakata's diagonal shot from 7 meters
(yards) out, the third goal of the season for the second Japanese
player in Serie A.
	   When police fired tear gas into the seating section holding
unruly Lazio supporters late in the first half, smoke drifted onto
the field and into the eyes of several players. The referee stopped
action for about five minutes, canceled first-half injury time, and
delayed the start of the second half.
	   While Lazio continues to languish in the middle of the standings
despite a dlrs 65 million offseason spending spree, Internazionale
of Milan moved into a tie for second place by escaping Empoli with
a 2-1 victory.
	   Once again, Nicola Ventola carried Inter Milan when established
stars Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio could not. With the two veterans
sidelined by injury, Ventola, a 20-year-old playing his first full
season in Serie A, hit the winner in the 37th minute. Empoli led
1-0 after 13 minutes, but finished the game with midfielder Pier
Paolo Bisoli between the posts after 'keeper Matteo Sereni and
captain Daniele Baldini were sent off.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Cagliari trampled Sampdoria 5-0, handing the
Genoa club its worst loss since the 1956-57 season, and Piacenza
defeated Vicenza 2-0.
	   Thanks in large part to Gabriel Batistuta, Fiorentina is alone
atop the standings for the first time since 1982. The Argentine
star, who is tied for the league lead with five goals, had a
hat-trick Saturday in Fiorentina's 3-1 win over AC Milan.
	   Fiorentina leads the table with nine points, two more than
Inter, AS Roma and Udinese. Juventus and Milan follow with six
points apiece.
	   On Saturday, Juventus lost 1-0 at AC Parma on Dino Baggio's
second-half goal; Roma beat Venezia 2-0 as Marco Delvecchio tallied
twice; Brazilian striker Marcio Amoroso raised his total to five
goals with two in Udinese's 2-0 win over Salernitana; and Bari and
Bologna drew 0-0.

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ A bastion of authoritarian rule in
Central Europe appeared set to collapse Sunday after election
results showed most Slovak voters rejecting the government of
Vladimir Meciar.
	   The leaders of four opposition parties huddled and agreed to
seal their informal alliance after full, unofficial results
indicated they had won 93 of the 150 seats in Parliament. They said
they expect to form a governing coalition after more negotiations.
	   ``Slovakia has voted for change,'' declared top opposition
leader Mikulas Dzurinda, head of the Slovak Democratic Coalition.
``The opposition has won a constitutional majority.''
	   The results put the 43-year-old Dzurinda in position to replace
Meciar as prime minister if the opposition alliance can withstand
what promises to be weeks of political pressure and hard
bargaining.
	   The governing Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) said
that while it accepted the results, it was not giving up hope for
putting together a majority to lead the next government. As the top
vote-getting party, it has one month to crack the opposition unity
and lure away deputies into its own coalition.
	   Its chances for building alliances are bleak, and others in
Slovakia and abroad said the results appear to signal the end of
the authoritarian rule that has dominated Slovakia throughout its
nearly six years of independence.
	   Czech President Vaclav Havel said the vote provided a mandate
for bolstering democracy in neighboring Slovakia, which split from
Czechoslovakia in 1993.
	   ``I hope and I believe that the young Slovak state is on the
right track,'' he said in a telegram to Dzurinda.
	   Western vote monitors praised the 84 percent turnout in the
two-day parliamentary election and said the balloting appeared to
have been carried out correctly. They stopped short of declaring
them free and fair until after official results are announced,
expected Monday night or Tuesday.
	   Meciar's hard-line HZDS was first with 27 percent of the vote,
based on the unofficial results, giving it 43 seats in Parliament.
	   The Slovak Democratic Coalition was right behind with 26.3
percent and 42 seats, and two other opposition parties came next.
The Party of the Democratic Left, former Communists, got 14.7
percent to earn 23 seats. The Hungarian Coalition Party,
representing Slovakia's largest minority ethnic group, had 9.1
percent for 15 seats. The six-month-old Party of Civic
Understanding, got 8 percent for 13 seats. Its leaders, like those
of the other three, said they would never join a Meciar coalition.
	   All told, the opposition's share of the seats is boosted to a
key 62 percent _ more than the three-fifths constitutional majority
needed to elect a president.
	   Slovakia has been without a president since March, when Michal
Kovac's term expired and Meciar assumed most of his powers. Kovac
could return in the post under an opposition alliance.
	   ``The majority of people showed a desire for big political
change, and an interest to enter the European Union and NATO,''
Kovac said Sunday. ``This is an important turning point for
Slovakia.''
	   Meciar's weakened HZDS fared significantly worse than in 1994
elections, and so did its main partner in the ruling coalition. The
ultranationalist Slovak National Party, whose billboards denounce
minority Hungarians and Gypsies as ``parasites,'' got 9 percent for
13 seats.
	   Meciar, whose anti-democratic practices have left Slovakia
diplomatically isolated in Central Europe, is still likely to lead
the largest party faction in Parliament.

Angered by U.S.-brokered Iraqi Kurd pact, Turkey restores ties with

<TEXT>
	   ANKARA, Turkey (AP) _ Iraq's top diplomat in Ankara on Sunday
welcomed Turkey's decision to restore full diplomatic ties after
more than seven years of sour relations between the neighbors.
	   Deputy Premier Bulent Ecevit announced Saturday that Turkey
would post an ambassador in Baghdad for the first time since the
Gulf War.
	   ``It is a step in the right direction,'' Iraqi charge d'affaires
T. Hamandi said Sunday.
	   He did not say whether Iraq would reciprocate by sending its own
ambassador back. The Iraqi ambassador left last year for what
Hamandi said were administrative reasons rather than political.
	   Relations between the two countries have been helped of late by
their common worry about two Iraqi Kurdish groups, the Kurdish
Democratic Party and the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan.
	   The Iraqi Kurd groups signed a U.S.-brokered accord Sept. 17 in
Washington ending their rivalry in northern Iraq, which they have
controlled since Western allies set up a haven for Iraqi Kurds
after the 1991 Gulf War.
	   The accord united the two Kurdish factions in the common goal of
establishing an elected government by summer 1999.
	   Ecevit said Saturday the accord threatened Iraq's territorial
unity.
	   ``It has been understood that the final goal is a federation
through a fait accompli,'' he said.
	   Turkey, like Iraq, strongly opposes creation of an independent
Kurdish state in northern Iraq. Turkey fears that would encourage
the aspirations of Turkish Kurdish rebels, who are fighting for
autonomy within Turkey.
	   In the past, disputes over Turkey's close ties with the United
States, sharing of water resources, and Iraqi Kurds' de facto
autonomous zone have all served to sour relations between Turkey
and Iraq.
	   Baghdad's Al-Thawra daily, the mouthpiece of the ruling Baath
party, said Sunday that Iraq ``has not given up its desire to
cooperate with Turkey to solve outstanding security issues and
still wants to continue joint cooperation and boost it in all
fields.''
	   Al-Thawra said Washington, with Turkey's blessing, was
encouraging Iraqi Kurds to establish their own state in Iraq.
``Today is Iraq's turn, and tomorrow will be Turkey's,'' the paper
warned.
	   It did not comment directly on the return of Turkey's
ambassador.

Swiss voters set to approve controversial truck tax
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss voters on Sunday appeared to have approved a
controversial new pollution tax on trucks that the government says
will help advance Switzerland's efforts to join the European Union.
	   In a finely-balanced referendum, early opinion polls indicated
that voters in this country of 7 million people would approve by 52
percent the imposition of a ``polluter pays'' duty on rigs rumbling
north to south through Switzerland's picturesque Alpine valleys.
	   The duty on trucks is primarily designed to offset the
environmental impact of a Swiss accord with Brussels which will
increase the permitted weight of trucks on Swiss roads from 28 to
40 tons. Switzerland is hoping the charge will encourage shippers
to transfer freight to rail.
	   The government says that without the tax, the higher weight
limit will lead to a twofold increase in trucks traveling the
country's road network by 2015.
	   But approval of the measure will also remove one of the
stumbling blocks Switzerland has faced in its efforts to gain EU
membership.
	   Since voters rejected plans to sign up to a loose European free
trade pact in 1992, the country has pursued bilateral accords with
Brussels as a way of furthering its membership ambitions and
ensuring that Swiss companies gain equal access to vast EU markets.
	   Progress in drawing up the accords has been hindered by
disagreement over the truck issue. The Swiss have been reluctant to
let too many heavy trucks cross the country from northern to
southern Europe and the government has opted to use the tax
initiative as a compromise.
	   The Swiss government says voters' approval will mean the deal
with Brussels can proceed, thereby advancing bilateral relations
and improving the country's negotiating stance.
	   However, even with the completion of this and other agreements,
the more complex membership issue will likely take years to
resolve.
	   The move has been opposed by a coalition of truckers and
anti-Europeans.
	   The results of two other votes Sunday have already been
announced. The electorate overwhelmingly rejected a proposal giving
government cash payments to small farmers who meet certain
environmental and animal welfare conditions. The plan, which got
the 50,000 signatures necessary to force a plebiscite, was
submitted by an unlikely alliance of small organic farmers and a
discount supermarket chain several years ago. Many bigger farmers
argued that the measure would penalize them and the government and
consumer groups said it is unnecessary.
	   Voters also threw out a plan supported by trade unions and the
Swiss socialist party to overhaul pensions, funded by provisions
allowing women voluntarily to work until the age of 64 if they are
willing and able. The proposal was opposed by the government.

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ British writer Salman Rushdie sees new
safety for himself in Iran's distancing itself from the Islamic
edict calling for his murder, but many in Iran are debating whether
anything has really changed.
	   On Sunday, both newspapers and ordinary Iranians debated the
announcement made in New York Thursday by Iran's foreign minister
distancing his government from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for
Rushdie's death.
	   The hard-line Jomhuri Eslami said in an editorial that the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's ``fatwa,'' or Islamic edict, calling
for Rushdie's death was still applicable.
	   ``Any promise in this regard... is a personal interpretation and
has nothing to do with the Islamic Republic. There is no room for
optimism by Rushdie and his supporters,'' the paper said.
	   The Iran News, a moderate daily close to the foreign ministry,
said there was nothing new in Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi's
statement that his ``government disassociates itself from any
reward ... and does not support it.'' It pointed out that the
government's position has for several years been not to seek
Rushdie's death.

	   At Perugia, hundreds of the 20,000 fans in attendance at Renato
Curi Stadium left the game at halftime, complaining they could not
see, the ANSA news agency reported. Police battled with Lazio fans
in the stands and outside the stadium.
	   Perugia (0-2-1) took a surprising lead after four minutes on a
header by striker Christian Bucchi, who played last season with an
amateur club and was making his Serie A debut. Portuguese defender
Fernando Cuoto equalized for Lazio (0-3-0) in the 20th minute, with
an acrobatic shot from 10 meters (yards) off a corner kick.
	   Nakata put the hosts ahead again with an assist from Croat
forward Milan Rapajic, and a minute later Lazio veteran Roberto
Mancini was sent off with a second yellow card for arguing. After
Mihajlovic made it 2-2, Perugia had midfielder Renato Olive
expelled in the 74th minute.
 &UR; Inter 2, Empoli 1 &QC; 
	   At Empoli, the hosts (0-1-2) went ahead in the 13th minute on
Marco Carparelli's low shot from the edge of the penalty area. But
Baldini received two quick yellow cards and left the game in the
25th. A minute later, sweeper Giuseppe Bergomi headed in Francesco
Moriero's free kick, the 19-year veteran's first goal since the
1994-95 season. After Ventola scored his third goal of the season,
Sereni was sent off in the closing minutes for a foul on the young
striker. Inter improved to 2-1-0.
 &UR; Cagliari 5, Sampdoria 0 &QC; 
	   At Cagliari, Sierra Leone striker Mohamed Kallon had two goals
(in the sixth and 75th minutes) and set up two others for the hosts
(1-1-1). Roberto Muzzi, rookie winger Gaetano Vasari and Daniele
Berretta added the other goals as Sampdoria, which finished the
game with nine players, fell to 0-2-1. Sampdoria lost 7-1 at
Udinese in the 1956-57 season.
 &UR; Piacenza 2, Vicenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Piacenza, defender Cleto Polonia scored from steps away after
a goalmouth scramble on the stroke of halftime and Davide Dionigi
sealed the win with a penalty kick with 12 minutes left. Piacenza
improved to 1-1-1, Vicenza is 0-1-2.
 &UR; Saturday's action &QC; 
 &UR; Fiorentina 3, Milan 1 &QC; 
	   At Milan, Batistuta scored in the sixth, 46th and 52nd minutes
as Fiorentina moved alone into first place for the first time since
Jan. 31, 1982. German striker Oliver Bierhoff, who led the league
with 27 goals while playing for Udinese last season, hit a penalty
kick for Milan in the 69th.
 &UR; Parma 1, Juventus 0 &QC; 
	   At Parma, Baggio cut across the penalty area and, beating Juve's
Alessio Tacchinardi to the ball, barely got his leg on striker
Enrico Chiesa's looping free kick. Parma (1-2-0) has yet to concede
in a goal.
 &UR; Udinese 2, Salernitana 0 &QC; 
	   At Udine, Amoroso scored twice in the first seven minutes for
his second straight two-goal game. Salernitana is the only team
with three losses.
 &UR; Roma 2, Venezia 0 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Delvecchio made a rare start and scored 20 seconds into
the game and again in the 14th minute to drop Venezia to 0-1-2.
 &UR; Bari 0, Bologna 0 &QC; 
	   At Bari, South African striker Phil Masinga beat Bologna 'keeper
Francesco Antonioli with a header in the 39th minute, but a
defender salvaged the draw by blocking the ball at the line with
his body. Bari is 1-2-0, Bologna 0-1-2.

Romania fights for having the Caspian oil pipeline
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By MIHAELA ARMASELU &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BUCHAREST, Romania (AP) _ Amid a tough competition from
neighboring countries, Romania is pushing forward a plan to build a
pipeline through its territory to transport crude oil from the
Caspian Sea to Western Europe.
	   ``All those involved in this project have the will and the
possibility to prove that the way from words to facts could be made
rapidly,'' President Emil Constantinescu said.
	   On Sunday, Constantinescu opened a two-day international
conference on the Caspian energy to Europe, organized by the
``Romania at the Crossroads'' forum and attended by officials and
businessmen from 12 countries.
	   The pipeline would transport crude from Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Ukraine and Russia to Western Europe.
	   The pipeline would mean a lot of money in taxes for each country
on the route. Romania could get benefits of dlrs 30 million a year
in royalties alone, Radu Popescu, a government expert, said.
	   He said Romania, which has tradition of 100 years of processing
oil, is ready to support three possible routes for building the
pipeline.
	   The route Romania-Yugoslavia-Croatia-Slovenia to the Italy's
port of Trieste is supported by the Italian oil concern Ente
Nazionale Idrocarburi (ENI).
	   ``From the economical point of view, this is the most profitable
route,'' ENI's head Guglielmo Moscato said Sunday.
	   The offer is aimed to transport 33 million tons of oil per year.
	   But the uncertain political situation in Yugoslavia has prompted
the European Union and the United States to support two other
routes which will go from Romania through Hungary and will reach
Italy too.
	   ``The oil will cross Romania anyway,''said Theodore Orasianu,
personal adviser of Constantinescu.
	   Turkey, Bulgaria and Ukraine have also proposed routes which
would bring Caspian crude oil to Western markets through their
territory. But Romanian officials claim their country offers the
best route.
	   ``This is the shortest route and we have the best refining
technology as the chemical industry was one of the former dictator
Nicolae's Ceausescu's hobbies,'' said Dan Capatana, president of
``Romania at the Crossroads'' forum.
	   There are 10 refineries in Romania with a capacity of 34 million
tons per year.
	   He told The Associated Press that the country offers an oil
terminal in Constanta which is already connected to an oil
distribution network and infrastructure.
	   Romania can also be linked to Rotterdam by waterways via the
Danube and Rhine rivers, allowing oil to be distributed to
countries from Hungary to Germany.
	   The network could be expanded and could ultimately link Finland.

Israeli Arabs clash with police in land dispute; 40 said hurt

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ About 40 people were hurt Sunday in violent
clashes in north-central Israel between Israeli police and Israeli
Arabs involving a land dispute.
	   Police said that 15 officers were among the injured in the
daylong fighting near the predominantly Arab town of Umm al-Fahm,
30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of the port city of Haifa.
	   Angry Arab demonstrators shouted ``Death to the Jews,'' and
``Throw them into the Sea,'' during the clashes, Israel radio
reported.
	   The fighting erupted as Israeli police moved in to tear down a
tent erected by protesters who claimed the land was unfairly
confiscated. Demonstrators threw rocks and firebombs at the police,
who responded with tear gas.
	   Dozens of protesters were hurt, including Raed Mahajna, the
mayor of Umm al-Fahm, who was taken to hospital for treatment.
	   ``I was beaten by the chief of police and then several soldiers
tackled me and beat me with their boots and fists until I could not
get up,'' Mahajna told Israel's army radio, speaking by telephone
from the hospital.
	   A demonstrator told army radio that police fired rubber-coated
bullets and live ammunition. The Israeli police commander, Alik
Rom, said the reports were being checked.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin did not confirm live ammunition
was used, but said police lives were endangered in the clash. Under
Israeli regulations, soldiers and police may open fire with live
bullets if their lives are in danger.
	   Menuhin said ``large numbers of police forces,'' were deployed
in the area and that 20 protesters had been arrested. Menuhin said
Arab and Jewish lawmakers had arrived in the town to try and bring
an end to the fighting.
	   Israeli authorities say the disputed area, near the northern
edge of the West Bank, is an Israeli army firing range. They say an
agreement was reached with the residents to nationalize about 125
acres (50 hectares) of land, in exchange for about six times as
much land elsewhere.
	   Residents of Umm el-Fahm put up a tent on the disputed land
three weeks ago. Israeli officials said they tried to negotiate
with the protesters and persuade them to leave on their own, and
sent in police to evict them after those efforts failed.
	   About 20 percent of Israel's citizens are Arabs. They live
within the original boundaries of the state, and do not include
more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

Zhirinovsky says he plans to run for president in 2000
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Vladimir Zhirinovsky, the flamboyant
ultranationalist leader who placed fifth in the 1996 presidential
election, said Sunday that he intends to run again in 2000.
	   ``I alone retain real chances for becoming president,'' Interfax
quoted Zhirinovsky as telling a news conference in Yaroslavl, a
city about 240 kilometers (150 miles) northeast of Moscow.
	   Zhirinovsky, who had a brief flash of national popularity in the
early 1990s, is no longer widely regarded as a serious presidential
contender.
	   He currently serves in the State Duma, the lower house of
parliament, where he heads the Liberal Democratic Party. He has
become known for a serious of attention-getting antics, such as
spitting and hurling water at fellow legislators, and shouting
obscenities in front of U.S. President Bill Clinton's hotel during
Clinton's recent trip to Moscow.
	   He announced last week that he intends to run for for governor
of the Leningrad region, which includes St. Petersburg.
	   Former Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin has announced his
intention to run for president in 2000, and speculation has focused
on several other potential candidates, including Moscow Mayor Yuri
Luzhkov, Krasnoyarsk Gov. Alexander Lebed and Yabloko party leader
Grigory Yavlinsky.

State vote in eastern Germany tests strength of extremist parties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with early projections
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Election
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ While Germany's two main parties
battled for control of the federal parliament Sunday, a state race
in the former communist east provided political drama to Germans
concerned about smaller extreme parties on the right and the left.
	   The ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism, which already
enjoys strong support in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, had its
first shot at being a part of a state government coalition.
	   The Social Democrats, who have been governing in a strained
coalition with the Christian Democrats, have said they will
consider the PDS as a partner if they win.
	   And early projections showed the Social Democrats finishing on
top with about 34 percent, compared to about 30 percent for the
Christian Democrats, the party of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   The PDS was running about 24 percent.
	   Any government including the ex-communist party is a concern for
mainstream politicians in Bonn, who deride the party as the
remnants of the anti-democratic East German regime. But many
easterners feel the PDS better represents their interests in a
political system dominated by westerners.
	   ``They understand us better,'' said Elke Polkin, a 45-year-old
office worker who's been unemployed since 1996, when the company
she worked for went bankrupt. Besides, she said after voting in a
drab, concrete school building, ``not everything in East Germany
was bad.''
	   The other option for the Social Democrats would be to continue a
``grand coalition'' with the Christian Democrats, only with the
Social Democrats as senior partner this time.
	   State Social Affairs Minister Heinrich Kuessner, a Social
Democrat, said it was too early to say which route his party would
take.
	   On the extreme-right, three rival parties were competing for
voters angry at unemployment running nearly 20 percent in the
state, the poorest in Germany. They sought to capitalize on fears
that foreigners were taking jobs from Germans _ plastering streets
with posters demanding ``Work for Germans first!'' and ``Criminal
Foreigners Out!'' _ although less than 1 percent of the state's 1.8
million people are foreigners.
	   But early projections showed none of them reaching the 5 percent
hurdle needed to enter parliament.
	   The German People's Union, which scored a shock 13 percent in
April in state elections in Saxony-Anhalt, another depressed
eastern state, finished with only between 3 and 4 percent,
projections showed. The other two parties had even less.
	   ``Democracy has won,'' state Interior Minister Armin Jaeger told
German television. ``The right-wing extremists are not in our state
parliament.''

<TEXT>
	   MASERU, Lesotho (AP) _ The sweet singing of hymns drifted from a
cathedral in this burned and pillaged capital Sunday as worshippers
prayed for the salvation of their mountain kingdom.
	   South African troops, backed by cannon-mounted armored fighting
vehicles, deploying for the first time in Mafeteng, 60 kilometers
(40 miles) south of the capital, found widespread destruction there
too.
	   Many businesses in Mafeteng had been looted and torched. Local
residents said outsiders had started the pillaging and burning and
that poor local residents joined the spree on Thursday.
	   Even a local brewery fell victim _ its exterior was littered
with emptied and broken beer bottles.
	   One resident blamed South Africa's military intervention for
triggering the looting.
	   ``Even if South Africa meant well, the way it was carried out
went wrong,'' the man, who did not want to give his name, told
Associated Press Television News. ``None of this started before
they came in.''
	   Maseru, the capital, was calm Sunday, but in ruins.
	   Most of its business district was destroyed by arson and looting
following last Tuesday's intervention by South Africa.
	   ``I wonder how we are going to survive now that the town is in
ashes,'' 25-year-old bank clerk Neboang Sebatane said at the
sandstone Catholic cathedral. ``So many people are going to lose
their jobs. What then after that?''
	   The intervention, which troops from Botswana joined on
Wednesday, aimed to prevent a military mutiny from escalating into
a coup and to bolster the civilian government elected last May.
South African troops, who had expected to easily secure the
military situation, fought Lesotho soldiers upon arriving because
they hadn't given advance warning of their peacekeeping mission.
	   Both regular Lesotho army troops and army mutineers fought the
South Africans, believing they were being invaded. At least 67
troops from both sides died, along with perhaps several dozen
civilians.
	   South African President Nelson Mandela on Sunday defended his
country's action, telling reporters in Cape Town: ``We went there
not to fight but ... so that the parties could sit down and explore
a peaceful settlement.''
	   ``We did not fire first,'' Mandela added.
	   South Africa boosted its troop strength by about 450 this
weekend from the initial force of 800. Botswana deployed about 200.
	   The 2,000-strong Lesotho Defense Force, some of whom mutineed in
support of opposition politicians and for pay increases, have been
ordered by their officers _ and by a South African commander _ to
report for work in uniform on Monday.
	   They are to bring in their weapons with the ammunition clips
removed and turn them in. South African officials said the weapons
will be returned once the Lesotho soldiers sort out their own power
struggle.
	   If many soldiers do not heed the order, that poses the risk of
guerrilla-style clashes and a crime wave.
	   Thousands of refugees have fled to towns in South Africa, which
encircles Lesotho, seeking shelter and food.
	   Government offices _ shut down since last Tuesday _ reportedly
would reopen Monday, and schools would follow by mid-week.
Thousands of people, believed to be supporters of the ruling
Lesotho Congress for Democracy party, converged Sunday on the
capital to begin a clean-up campaign.
	   Energy Minister Monyane Moleleki said officials plan to seek aid
from the
	   International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to help rebuild
this impoverished country of 2 million, the South African Press
Association reported.

Soldier and companion steal weapons from base
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ An army sentry and an unidentified
companion robbed a base of 11 automatic carbines and 1,200 rounds
of ammunition before dawn Sunday, officials said.
	   The robbery took place at a base in Strangnas, about 50
kilometers (30 miles) west of Stockholm. The robbers and their
booty have not been found, but police recovered the military
vehicle they used to flee.
	   The soldier, a 20-year-old doing his compulsory national
service, performed a patrol of the base about 2:30 a.m., and when
he returned to the guardhouse he raised his weapon against the
other soldiers in the guardhouse and then opened the door to a
masked and armed companion.
	   The two tied up the other 10 guards, took the weapons and
ammunition and fled in a military minibus, the army said.
	   ``We don't understand why someone would do such an idiotic thing
, where the draftee is completely visible while the other is
masked,'' Stockholm police spokesman Bjorn Pihlblad was quoted as
saying by the news agency TT.

On Rushdie, Iranian newspapers ask, `What's new?'
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By AFSHIN VALINEJAD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEHRAN, Iran (AP) _ British writer Salman Rushdie sees new
safety for himself in Iran's distancing itself from the Islamic
edict calling for his death, Iranian newspapers questioned whether
anything has really changed.
	   The hard-line Jomhuri Eslami said in an editorial that the late
Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini's ``fatwa,'' or Islamic edict, was
still applicable, even though Foreign Minister Kamal Kharrazi last
week distanced his government from a dlrs 2.5 million reward for
Rushdie's death.
	   ``Any promise in this regard... is a personal interpretation and
has nothing to do with the Islamic Republic. There is no room for
optimism by Rushdie and his supporters,'' the paper said.
	   The Iran News, a moderate daily close to Kharrazi's foreign
ministry, said there was nothing new in his statement that his
``government disassociates itself from any reward ... and does not
support it.''
	   The paper pointed out that the government's position has for
several years been not to seek Rushdie's death.
	   The difference now was that ``Britain has now decided that is
sufficient for normalization of relations,'' the newspaper said.
``Britain feels left out of lucrative business deals Iran has
struck with other European countries.''
	   The Rushdie affair has been the main hurdle in Iran's efforts to
improve ties with the European Union. Britain has sought better
ties in order to benefit from lucrative projects in Iran, which
have gone to France and other European countries that have better
ties with Tehran.
	   President Mohammad Khatami, a moderate cleric, has been trying
to change Iran's foreign policy ever since he became president in
August 1997. Khatami has underscored the need to replace
confrontation with dialogue in Iran's relations with the West,
including the United States.
	   But powerful hard-liners inside the Islamic regime have always
supported the death sentence and are likely to continue to do so.
	   Although relieved at Iran's announcement of distancing itself
from the reward for his death, the 51-year-old Rushdie said he was
still cautious since the fatwa itself was not lifted.
	   ``I feel there is a small, continued need for caution'' but
``this can be dealt with without the colossal apparatus of state
protection,'' he said a day after Kharrazi's announcement.
	   Rushdie has spent nearly a decade in hiding since Khomeini
called for his death on Feb. 14, 1989, claiming his book, ``The
Satanic Verses,'' blasphemed Islam.

	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ A gas explosion
destroyed a packed cafeteria in the center of this popular
Mediterranean island town Sunday, injuring 40 people, including
nine foreigners, police said.
	   The explosion at the Gran Cafe Capuccino on Palma's Paseo
Maritimo sea-front avenue occurred shortly before 12 a.m. (1000
gmt), bringing the down the premises' ceiling and sending concrete
and glass flying in all directions, a Municipal Police spokesman
said.
	   The 40 injured included four Britons, three French and two Dutch
citizens, the spokesman said. All but seven persons, including two
Britons and the two Dutch were released from hospital by
mid-afternoon. The seven were said to be in serious condition,
mostly with burns and cuts, but no one's life was in danger.
	   It was not known whether the seven foreigners were all tourists
or if some resided on the island. More than 100 people were at the
cafe when the blast occurred.
	   The Balearic island of Mallorca is one of Europe's and the
world's top tourist destinations.
	   The police spokesman, who in keeping with custom refused to be
identified, said investigations indicated the blast may have been
caused by a gas leak in the basement of the cafe or possibly in the
adjacent building.

	   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ U.S. troops on Sunday
arrested a former Bosnian Serb police chief indicted by the
international war crimes court for murder, rape and other crimes
during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.
	   Stevan Todorovic was apprehended by without incident in the
northern Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac, about 70 kilometers (44
miles) northwest of here, a NATO statement said.
	   In a statement released in Washington, President Clinton
confirmed that American and other, unspecified Allied troops took
part in the arrest. Clinton said Todorovic was responsible ``for
some of the most heinous crimes that took place during the conflict
in Bosnia.''
	   Clinton said the action ``shows our continued determination to
bring to justice those responsible for war crimes in Bosnia. This
message should not be lost on those indicted war criminals still at
large. ''
	   Todorovic, 41, has been indicted by the U.N. war crimes court in
The Hague, Netherlands, for ``grave breaches, violations of the
laws or customs of war and crime against humanity'' allegedly
committed in 1992 when he was police chief of Bosanski Samac.
	   Specific charges include murder, rape and torture.
	   In The Hague, tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said
Todorovic was indicted in July 1995 on 15 counts _ five war crimes;
five ``grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions;'' and five crimes
against humanity.
	   Among his alleged offenses, he is charged with murdering one
Muslim, beating at least six others and forcing two prisoners whose
identities were not released to perform unspecified sexual acts on
each other in front of other prisoners and Serb guards _ an
allegation which carries a rape charge.
	   ``This action serves as yet another warming to all those
indicted for war crimes who are still at large that they will not
escape justice,'' NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said in a
statement early Sunday morning.
	   NATO spokeswoman Maj. Sheena Thomson said Todorovic would be
transported later in the day to The Hague.
	   Todorovic is the ninth indicted suspect to be picked up in
Bosnia by NATO forces and the 26th suspect in custody out of 58
suspects indicted. He is the fourth Bosnian Serb suspect in custody
charged with offenses committed after the Serb takeover of Bosanski
Samac.
	   It was not immediately clear if he would be tried together with
the other three.
	   The operation took place a few hours before U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen arrived in Bosnia for a one-day visit. It
occurred two days after the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe confirmed that a Bosnian Serb
ultranationalist, Nikola Poplasen, had defeated the U.S.-backed
incumbent for president of the Bosnian Serb republic in this
month's national election.
	   Poplasen's election has raised concern about Bosnian Serb
cooperation with terms of the 1995 Dayton agreement which ended the
three and one-half year Bosnian war, especially the return of
refugees to areas from which they were driven by rival Bosnian
groups.
	   One Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
suggested the arrest was intended as an ``early test'' of
Poplasen's assurances that he would cooperate with international
officials overseeing implementation of Dayton.
	   Thomson described that, however, as ``pure speculation.''

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Social Democratic candidate Gerhard
Schroeder looked headed for victory in national elections Sunday,
according to exit polls showing that voters favored a new face over
four more years of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Chants of ``Kohl must go!'' broke out in Social Democrat
headquarters after results showing they had 41 percent of the vote.
With the Christian Democrats winning just 35 percent, Kohl appeared
to have lost his parliamentary majority.
	   The vote indicates the first change in government Germany has
seen after 16 years of Kohl's conservative rule.
	   ``Finally, finally. I have rarely been so happy,'' said Utta
Tiedtke, 51, dabbing tears as she stood among the SPD revelers.
``My two children have never known anything other than Kohl.
They've only lived in a time of mediocrity. This means the end of
stagnation. We've been waiting for this so long.''
	   Disappointment was the general mood at the Christian Democrats'
headquarters.
	   ``The results of this election are a bitter defeat for us. But
as good democrats, we will respect the people's decision,'' said
party secretary Peter Hintze.
	   He thanked Kohl for all he had accomplished in his 16 years in
power, specifically the unification of communist East Germany with
the West in 1990.
	   Unification was Kohl's historic moment. As the likely new
chancellor, Schroeder will oversee two more historic changes for
Europe's largest nation: the government's move back to Berlin, and
the switch from the trusted German mark to the euro, Europe's
common currency.
	   Schroeder has said he hopes to govern in a coalition with the
environmentalist Greens party, which won 6.5 percent. However it
was unclear whether the two were strong enough to form a stable
majority in parliament.
	   The other option for Schroeder is to share power with the
Christian Democrats in a so-called ``grand coalition''_ something
Germany hasn't seen in almost 30 years.
	   A leading Christian Democrat, Juergen Ruettgers, said the
results so far did not exclude a grand coalition.
	   Voters chose a new 656-seat parliament, where the party with the
most seats proposes the chancellor.
	   The junior partner in the old government, the liberal Free
Democrats, won 6.5 percent of the vote, maintaining its place in
parliament.
	   The ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism won 5 percent,
the minimum required for it to remain in parliament.
	   Exit polls, tallied by social scientists, are generally reliable
indicators of official results which were not expected until after
midnight.

Lazio still winless after wild draw at Perugia; action delayed by

 &UR; Eds: COMBINES pvs. RAISES references to trouble at Perugia, fans
leaving stadium. minor editing. &QL; 
 &UR; By HOWARD FENDRICH &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ROME (AP) _ Tear gas, two expulsions, another goal by Japanese
midfielder Hidetoshi Nakata, a spectacular free kick by Yugoslav
Sinisa Mihajlovic.
	   There was a little bit of everything in Sunday's Italian League
game between Perugia and Lazio of Rome. Everything, that is, except
talent-laden Lazio's first win of the season.
	   When police fired tear gas into the seating section holding
unruly Lazio supporters late in the first half, smoke drifted onto
the field and into the eyes of several players. The referee stopped
action for about five minutes, canceled first-half injury time, and
then delayed the start of the second half by 10 minutes.
	   Hundreds of the 20,000 fans at Renato Curi Stadium left at
halftime, complaining they could not see, the ANSA news agency
reported. Police battled in the stands and outside the stadium with
some of the 2,500 Lazio supporters.
	   The match ended 2-2 as Lazio salvaged a draw _ its third
straight _ on Mihajlovic's curling, 30-meter (-yard) strike, which
found the roof of the net with 18 minutes remaining. Perugia had
led 2-1 in the 64th minute on Nakata's diagonal shot from 7 meters
(yards) out, the third goal for the second Japanese player in Serie
A.
	   While Lazio continues to languish in the middle of the standings
despite a dlrs 65 million offseason spending spree, Internazionale
of Milan moved into a tie for second place by escaping Empoli with
a 2-1 victory.
	   Once again, Nicola Ventola carried Inter Milan when established
stars Ronaldo and Roberto Baggio could not. With the two veterans
sidelined by injury, Ventola, a 20-year-old playing his first full
season in Serie A, hit the winner in the 37th minute. Empoli led
1-0 after 13 minutes, but finished the game with midfielder Pier
Paolo Bisoli between the posts after 'keeper Matteo Sereni and
captain Daniele Baldini were sent off.
	   Elsewhere Sunday, Cagliari trampled Sampdoria 5-0, handing the
Genoa club its worst loss in more than 40 years, and Piacenza
defeated Vicenza 2-0.
	   Thanks in large part to Gabriel Batistuta, Fiorentina is alone
atop the standings for the first time in 16 years. The Argentine
star, who is tied for the league lead with five goals, had a
hat-trick Saturday in Fiorentina's 3-1 win over AC Milan.
	   Fiorentina leads the table with nine points, two more than
Inter, AS Roma and Udinese. Juventus and Milan follow with six
points apiece.
	   On Saturday, Juventus lost 1-0 at AC Parma on Dino Baggio's
second-half goal; Roma beat Venezia 2-0 as Marco Delvecchio tallied
twice; Brazilian striker Marcio Amoroso raised his total to five
goals with two in Udinese's 2-0 win over Salernitana; and Bari and
Bologna drew 0-0.
	   At Perugia, the hosts (0-2-1) took a surprising lead after four
minutes on a header by striker Christian Bucchi, who played last
season with an amateur club and was making his Serie A debut.
Portuguese defender Fernando Cuoto equalized for Lazio (0-3-0, 11th
in the 18-team league) in the 20th minute, with an acrobatic shot
from 10 meters (yards) off a corner kick.
	   Nakata put the hosts ahead again with an assist from Croat
forward Milan Rapajic, and a minute later Lazio veteran Roberto
Mancini was sent off with a second yellow card for arguing. After
Mihajlovic made it 2-2, Perugia had midfielder Renato Olive
expelled in the 74th minute.
 &UR; Inter 2, Empoli 1 &QC; 
	   At Empoli, the hosts (0-1-2) went ahead in the 13th minute on
Marco Carparelli's low shot from the edge of the penalty area. But
Baldini received two quick yellow cards and left the game in the
25th. A minute later, sweeper Giuseppe Bergomi headed in Francesco
Moriero's free kick, the 19-year veteran's first goal since the
1994-95 season. After Ventola scored his third goal of the season,
Sereni was sent off in the closing minutes for a foul on the young
striker. Inter improved to 2-1-0.
 &UR; Cagliari 5, Sampdoria 0 &QC; 
	   At Cagliari, Sierra Leone striker Mohamed Kallon had two goals
(in the sixth and 75th minutes) and set up two others for the hosts
(1-1-1). Roberto Muzzi, rookie winger Gaetano Vasari and Daniele
Berretta added the other goals as Sampdoria, which finished the
game with nine players, fell to 0-2-1. Sampdoria lost 7-1 at
Udinese in the 1956-57 season.
 &UR; Piacenza 2, Vicenza 0 &QC; 
	   At Piacenza, defender Cleto Polonia scored from steps away after
a goalmouth scramble on the stroke of halftime and Davide Dionigi
sealed the win with a penalty kick with 12 minutes left. Piacenza
improved to 1-1-1, Vicenza is 0-1-2.
 &UR; Saturday's action &QC; 
 &UR; Fiorentina 3, Milan 1 &QC; 
	   At Milan, Batistuta scored in the sixth, 46th and 52nd minutes
as Fiorentina moved alone into first place for the first time since
Jan. 31, 1982. German striker Oliver Bierhoff, who led the league
with 27 goals while playing for Udinese last season, hit a penalty
kick for Milan in the 69th.
 &UR; Parma 1, Juventus 0 &QC; 
	   At Parma, Baggio cut across the penalty area and, beating Juve's
Alessio Tacchinardi to the ball, barely got his leg on striker
Enrico Chiesa's looping free kick. Parma (1-2-0) has yet to concede
in a goal.
 &UR; Udinese 2, Salernitana 0 &QC; 
	   At Udine, Amoroso scored twice in the first seven minutes for
his second straight two-goal game. Salernitana is the only team
with three losses.
 &UR; Roma 2, Venezia 0 &QC; 
	   At Rome, Delvecchio made a rare start and scored 20 seconds into
the game and again in the 14th minute to drop Venezia to 0-1-2.
 &UR; Bari 0, Bologna 0 &QC; 
	   At Bari, South African striker Phil Masinga beat Bologna 'keeper
Francesco Antonioli with a header in the 39th minute, but a
defender salvaged the draw by blocking the ball at the line with
his body. Bari is 1-2-0, Bologna 0-1-2.

Leicester gets late goal for 1-1 draw; Di Canio faces ban
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By STEPHEN WADE &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Leicester's Matt Elliott scored in the 88th minute
Sunday to salvage a 1-1 draw, negating Robbie Earle's header for
Wimbledon in the 74th at Leicester.
	   A victory would have moved Wimbledon into second place behind
league-leading Aston Villa in England's Premier League. Instead,
Wimbledon moved into third behind Derby, both with 12 points.
	   Aston Villa's 1-0 home victory Saturday over Derby on Paul
Merson's 15th-minute strike kept the Birmingham side atop the
league with 17 points and an unbeaten record in seven league games.
	   Five teams have 11 points _ Newcastle, Manchester United, Leeds,
Liverpool, and Chelsea _ and Arsenal has 10.
	   Despite Villa's victory, Saturday's biggest story was Sheffield
Wednesday's Italian striker Paolo Di Canio, who pushed referee Paul
Alcock to the ground in a 1-0 win at Hillsborough over Arsenal.
	   His club immediately handed him an indefinite suspension.
Reports suggested he could face a ban rivaling the eight-month
suspension given Eric Cantona of Manchester United in 1995 for
kung-fu kicking a fan.
	   F.A. chief executive Graham Kelly declined Sunday to speculate
on Di Canio's penalty pending a hearing by the body's disciplinary
commission.
	   Alcock was pushed to the ground by the 30-year-old Italian after
he was shown a red card for his part in a brawl in the final
minutes of the first half.
	   Arsenal's Martin Keown was also sent off as a melee among a
dozen players broke out following a tussle between Arsenal's
Patrick Vieira and Wim Jonk.
	   In other matches Saturday, defending league and F.A. Cup
champion Arsenal suffered its first lost of the season, falling 1-0
at Sheffield Wednesday.
	   Newcastle won 2-0 at home against Nottingham Forest as England
international Alan Shearer scored both to give him six league
goals. It was Newcastle's fourth straight victory under new coach
Ruud Gullit.
	   In north London, Tottenham and Leeds played a 3-3 draw with
Spurs defender Sol Campbell scoring in second-half injury time. The
match was likely to be the last at Leeds for coach George Graham,
who seems set to move to Tottenham.
	   In other matches Saturday in the Premier League: Charlton 1,
Coventry 1; Chelsea 2, Middlesbrough 0; Everton 0, Blackburn 0.
	   On Monday, Southampton played at West Ham.
	   Sunday in England's first division, Crystal Palace defeated
Sheffield United 1-0. On Saturday, Sunderland moved into first
place with a 1-1 draw at Portsmouth. Huddersfield, which had been
No. 1, was beaten 3-0 at Bolton and was level on points with
Sunderland (19) but behind on goal difference.
	   In Scotland's Premier Division Saturday: Celtic 1, Hearts 1;
Dundee 1, Motherwell 0; Dunfermline 0, Rangers 2; St. Johnstone 1,
Dundee United 3. Rangers lead with 15 points followed by Kilmarnock
and Hearts with 12 each.

	   BULAWAYO, Zimbabwe (AP) _ India clinched a three-match one-day
international cricket series Sunday, scoring an impressive 236 for
the loss of only two wickets to win the first two matches.
	   Zimbabwe notched up 235 runs for seven wickets in its innings at
Queens Club in the second city of Bulawayo.
	   India's opening bat Saura Ganguly anchored the Indian victory
with an
	   impressive 107 not out.
	   His performance gave India an unassailable 2-0 lead in the
one-day series. The last one-day match is scheduled in the Zimbabwe
capital, Harare, on Wednesday.
	   Ganguly led a second wicket partnership of 153 with skipper
Mohamad Asharuddin, who scooped away 72 runs.
	   Ganguly's was the second century of the Indian tour so far.
Sachin Tendulkar hit 127 runs on Saturday, his 18th one-day
international century, a world cricketing record.
	   Tendulkar on Sunday scored just 29, and was the first victim of
17-year-old Zimbabwean bowler Mluleka Nkala who was making his
international debut.
	   The number of overs was reduced to 45 from the allocated 50 for
each side after rain and hazy conditions delayed the start of play.
	   For Zimbabwe, captain Alistair Campbell scored 74 off 82 balls
on Sunday.
	   He also partnered Murray Goodwin, who made 66, to a 125 runs
second wicket partnership and this enabled Zimbabwe to reach a
respectable 237-7 after Mohamad Azharuddin again put them into bat
after winning the toss.
	   When Campbell and Goodwin had left the crease, India snatched
five more wickets and Zimbabwe managed to gather 235, giving them
some hope of a win.
	   A five-day Test is scheduled in Harare starting on Oct. 8.

	   PALMA DE MALLORCA, Balearic Islands (AP) _ A gas explosion
destroyed a packed cafeteria in the center of this popular
Mediterranean island town Sunday, injuring 40 people, including
nine foreigners, police said.
	   The explosion at the Gran Cafe Capuccino on Palma's Paseo
Maritimo sea-front avenue occurred shortly before 12 a.m. (1000
gmt), bringing down the ceiling and sending concrete and glass
flying in all directions, a police spokesman said.
	   The 40 injured included four Britons, three French and two Dutch
citizens, the spokesman said. All but seven persons _ including two
Britons and the two Dutch _ were released from hospital by
mid-afternoon.
	   The seven were said to be in serious condition, mostly with
burns and cuts, but no one was critical.
	   It was not known whether the seven foreigners were all tourists
or if some resided on the island. More than 100 people were at the
cafe when the blast occurred.
	   The Balearic island of Mallorca is one of Europe's and the
world's top tourist destinations.
	   The police spokesman, who in keeping with custom refused to be
identified, said investigations indicated the blast may have been
caused by a gas leak in the basement of the cafe or possibly in the
adjacent building.

	   VIENNA, Austria (AP) _ Austria's chancellor declared Sunday that
the election victory of Germany's Social Democratic Party and its
leader Gerhard Schroeder was a ``success for a Europe of

	   Klima said the results of Sunday's German election constituted
not only a ``historic success for the SPD'' but also ``a success
for a Europe of employment, a success for a Europe with more social
justice and a success for a Europe of social democracy.''
	   Klima also said that this is a day ``in which one must express
respect and thanks to a truly great European, Helmut Kohl.''

Officer gets one-month suspension for novel on police in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A police officer was suspended for a month
Sunday for publishing without permission a novel about police
abuse, officials said.
	   The sentence is considered light since Brig. Hamdy el-Batran had
also been charged with defaming Egypt's security forces.
	   ``The Interior Ministry adheres to the country's policy which
stresses promoting democracy and freedom of expression'' as long as
what is published is just, said the court ruling.
	   It said it would not ``stop any pen on account of the country's
policies.''
	   El-Batran was brought before the police disciplinary committee
after publishing ``The Journal of an Officer in the Countryside,''
a novel that portrays police abuse in the southern province of
Assiut, once a hotbed of Muslim militant activity.
	   El-Batran maintained that the book was a work of fiction which
emerged from his love of writing. However, the cases described in
the novel mirror human rights reports which chronicled police
abuses in Assiut.
	   The book is filled with tales of bribery, brutality and
immorality _ as well as vivid descriptions of police work.
	   Human rights groups said that officials at the Interior Ministry
objected to the novel mainly because it was written by a
high-ranking officer in its security forces, making it difficult
for them to refute or dismiss any claims it made.
	   El-Batran will be reinstated with full pay at the end of his
suspension, said the officials, speaking on customary condition of

Spanish enclave holds memorial service for crash victims

	   MELILLA, Spain (AP) _ Thousands packed the main sport's pavilion
of this Spanish enclave in North Africa on Sunday to remember the
38 victims of Friday's air crash just over the border in Morocco.
	   The service culminated a weekend of grieving for Melilla _ a
small city that prides itself on coming together in difficult
times.
	   ``All of Melilla is here today. We all know each other here so
we all feel the pain, although not as much as the direct
relatives,'' said Manuel Sevilla, 75.
	   Representatives from the enclave's Jewish, Hindu, Moslem and
Christian communities all spoke at the service that was reminiscent
of last December's memorial held in the same setting for 11 people
killed when a torrent of water from a burst tank gushed through a
commercial district.
	   On Friday, a 86-seater plane belonging to the Spanish Pauknair
company flew into a hillside in Morocco morning killing all 38
people on board.
	   The British-built BAe 146 was approaching to land at Melilla
airport some 30 minutes after taking off from the southern Spanish
port of Malaga.
	   Authorities have so far refused to comment on possible causes of
the crash. The accident is being investigated by a mixed
Moroccan-Spanish commission.
	   ``It is very strange,'' said the Spanish military's No. 2 in
Melilla Gen. Jose Rodriguez. ``The weather was O.K., the plane it
seems was in good condition and the pilot was experienced.''
	   But Rodriguez said the two black boxes recovered from the
wreckage were in good condition and so should reveal the cause of
the accident.
	   The mass Sunday was attended by Princess Elena representing the
Spanish royal family.
	   Also Sunday medical teams identified the last of the victims and
the only non-Spaniard _ a young Moroccan Adhelaziz Bakkali.
According to relatives Bakkali was on his way back to Morocco after
spending a year living illegally in Malaga.

Leftist setback for Blair at start of Labor annual conference

<TEXT>
	   BLACKPOOL, England (AP) _ Britain's governing Labor Party opened
its annual conference Sunday with left-wing victories in party
elections marking the first setback for Prime Minister Tony Blair
and his centrist policies.
	   Outside the Winter Gardens conference center in this north
England town, several thousand left-wing demonstrators chanted
``tax the rich'' and ``workers united will never be defeated.''
	   Staff closed entrance doors and mounted police circled the
marching demonstrators, while inside Blair took questions from
delegates.
	   Left-wingers, who see themselves as standard-bearers of the
socialist policies ditched by Blair's ``New Labor,'' took four of
the six places chosen by rank-and-file members on the party's
32-member National Executive Committee.
	   Blair immediately warned Laborites against a return to the
internecine warfare that helped keep the party out of office for 18
years until his May 1997 landslide election victory over the
Conservative Party.
	   ``We have come a long way because we were prepared to make
changes that made us more relevant and that connected us with the
people,'' said Blair. ``That's why we won ... if people go into
outright opposition that doesn't help anyone.''
	   The victorious candidates included Liz Davies, a left-wing
lawyer barred by the party hierarchy from running for Parliament in
May 1997 national elections although she had won a nomination for a
solid Labor district.
	   ``It shows the party members don't care about the smears,''
declared Ms. Davies. ``They care about the politics we stood for _
redistribution of wealth and power from the rich to the poor, and
democracy and diversity in the Labor Party.''
	   Blair, however, remained in firm control of the governing body.
Most of the other seats will go, or are likely to go in ballots
announced during the week, to his supporters _ some his nominees
and others elected by trade unions and lawmakers. Trade unions are
major funders of the party, despite Blair's wooing of big business.
	   The leftists, running on a joint ticket called Grassroots
Alliance, did well although the electricians' union spent
15,000-pounds (dlrs 25,000) on a campaign to get sWorkinix Blair
loyalists elected. The union paid a telephone canvassing company to
call round members.
	   Only 133,597 members voted _ a turnout of 35 percent.
	   Earlier, Blair stressed he will stick to an economic program
whose main objective is to hold inflation to 2.5 percent.
	   Several thousand farmers also demonstrated in Blackpool. Like
many industrialists and labor union leaders, they are upset about
the high value of the British pound which makes exports expensive.

 &UR; By NERMINA DURMIC-KAHROVIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO troops arrested a
former Bosnian Serb police chief indicted by the international war
crimes court for murder, rape and other crimes during the 1992-1995
Bosnian War, officials announced Sunday.
	   Stevan Todorovic was apprehended without incident in the
northern Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac, about 70 kms (44 miles)
northwest of here, a NATO statement said.
	   In a statement released in Washington, President Bill Clinton
confirmed that U.S. and other unspecified Allied troops took part
in the arrest. Clinton said Todorovic was responsible ``for some of
the most heinous crimes that took place during the conflict in
Bosnia.''
	   Clinton said the action ``shows our continued determination to
bring to justice those responsible for war crimes in Bosnia. This
message should not be lost on those indicted war criminals still at
large. ''
	   The operation took place a few hours before U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen arrived in Bosnia for a one-day visit.
	   The U.N. war crimes court in The Hague, Netherlands had indicted
Todorovic, 41, in July 1995 on 15 counts _ five war crimes, five
``grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions'' and five crimes
against humanity, tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said.
	   Todorovic is accused of committing the crimes, which include
murder, rape and torture, when he was police chief of Bosanski
Samac in 1992.
	   Among his alleged offenses, he is charged with murdering one
Muslim, beating at least six others and forcing two prisoners whose
identities were not released to perform unspecified sexual acts on
each other in front of prisoners and Serb guards _ an allegation
which carries a rape charge.
	   ``This action serves as yet another warning to all those
indicted for war crimes who are still at large that they will not
escape justice,'' NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said in a
statement Sunday morning.
	   NATO spokeswoman Maj. Sheena Thomson said Todorovic would be
transported later in the day to The Hague.
	   Todorovic is the ninth indicted suspect to be picked up in
Bosnia by NATO forces and becomes the 26th suspect in custody out
of 58 suspects indicted.
	   He is the fourth Bosnian Serb suspect in custody charged with
offenses committed after the Serb takeover of Bosanski Samac. It
was not immediately clear if he would be tried together with the
other three.
	   The arrest took place two days after the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe confirmed that a Bosnian Serb
ultranationalist, Nikola Poplasen, had defeated the U.S.-backed
incumbent for president of the Bosnian Serb republic in this
month's national election.
	   Poplasen's election has raised concern about Bosnian Serb
cooperation with terms of the 1995 Dayton agreement that ended the
3 1/2-year Bosnian war, especially the return of refugees to areas
from which they were driven by rival Bosnian groups.

Swiss voters set to approve controversial truck tax
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES throughout with referendum result, comment. &QL; 
 &UR; By PHILIP WALLER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   GENEVA (AP) _ Swiss voters on Sunday approved a controversial
new pollution tax on trucks that the government says will advance
Switzerland's efforts to join the European Union.
	   In a finely-balanced referendum, voters in this country of 7
million people voted by 57 percent to approve the imposition of a
``polluter pays'' duty on rigs rumbling north to south through
Switzerland's picturesque Alpine valleys.
	   Ministers hope the tax, part of a compromise deal with Brussels
under which Switzerland will have to increase its weight limit for
trucks from 28 to 40 tons, will remove one of the stumbling blocks
the country has faced in its efforts to gain EU membership.
	   Transport minister Moritz Leuenberger said the result
represented a vindication of the government's transport policy.
	   Franz Steinegger, president of the centrist Radical Party, said
the ``yes'' vote is a relief.
	   ``The (truck accord) will greatly boost the signature of
agreements between Switzerland and the European Union,'' a
government statement said.
	   The duty on trucks is primarily designed to offset the
environmental impact of the Swiss accord with Brussels. Switzerland
is hoping the charge will encourage shippers to transfer freight to
rail.
	   Since voters rejected plans to sign up to a loose European free
trade pact in 1992, the country has pursued bilateral accords with
Brussels as a way of furthering its membership ambitions and
ensuring that Swiss companies gain equal access to vast EU markets.
	   However, progress in drawing up the accords has been hindered by
disagreement over the truck issue and Swiss reluctance to let too
many heavy trucks cross the country from northern to southern
Europe.
	   Voters' approval will mean Switzerland will now be able to move
to conclude the truck agreement and other accords reached with
Brussels, possibly as soon as next spring.
	   However, even with the completion of this and other agreements,
the more complex membership issue will likely take years to
resolve.
	   The move was opposed by a coalition of truckers and
anti-Europeans. The government argued that without the tax, the
higher weight limit will lead to a twofold increase in trucks
traveling the country's road network by 2015.
	   Two other votes were also held Sunday. Voters rejected by 77
percent a proposal giving government cash payments to small farmers
who meet certain environmental and animal welfare conditions. The
plan, which got the 50,000 signatures necessary to force a
plebiscite, was submitted by an unlikely alliance of small organic
farmers and a discount supermarket chain several years ago. Many
bigger farmers argued that the measure would penalize them and the
government and consumer groups condemned it as unnecessary.
	   Voters also rejected by 58 percent a plan supported by trade
unions and the Swiss socialist party to overhaul pensions, funded
by provisions allowing women voluntarily to work until the age of
64 if they are willing and able. The proposal was opposed by the
government.
	   Voter turnout was 51 percent, the highest since June 1993.

After exhausting, weeks-long trip, Mandela, 80, says he's fine
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PAUL HARRIS &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   CAPE TOWN, South Africa (AP) _ Seeking to calm worries about his
health after he was forced to cancel an engagement on a state visit
to Canada, President Nelson Mandela on Sunday said doctors had
pronounced him fit and well.
	   Wearing a trademark golden African shirt, Mandela, 80, joked
with reporters at a news conference at his official Cape Town home.
Within hours of his return home Sunday, doctors examined him, he
said.
	   ``They all gave me a clean bill of health. I thought that news
would reassure you and allay a great deal of uneasiness,'' he said,
sitting next to his new wife Graca Machel.
	   Fears over Mandela's health can spark jitters. Though he has
delegated day-to-day running of South Africa to Deputy President
Thabo Mbeki, Mandela is seen as a powerful unifying force in a
nation where racial divisions are still strong.
	   Rumors of his ill health contributed to a plunge in the value of
the rand currency in 1996. Mandela then underwent a thorough
physical examination that showed he had high blood pressure and an
enlarged heart, but generally was healthy.
	   However, he did admit his hectic recent schedule on a North
American tour had tired him, prompting him to cancel one appearence
and shorten a dinner in his honor hosted by Candian Prime Minister
Jean Chretien.
	   ``It was sheer exhaustion,'' he said.
	   Aside from his trip to Canada and the United States, during
which he addressed the United Nations in New York, Mandela has also
acted as chairman of two major international conferences this
month.
	   But far from looking tired, Mandela was in good spirits at the
news conference, asking reporters if they, too, were feeling well
and calling one of his doctors ``a vampire'' for taking a blood
sample.

Somali basketball players held hostage

<TEXT>
	   MOGADISHU, Somalia (AP) _ Humanitarians called Sunday for the
immediate release of six basketball players who were being punished
for participating in a tournament for peace.
	   It was the first time in eight years of civil strife in Somalia
that athletes were targeted by militiamen for political reasons.
	   The six players were taken hostage 11 days ago by militiamen of
Muse Sudi Yalahow, faction leader of the Medina district of
southern Mogadishu, who accused them of being traitors.
	   He was punishing the players from Medina for competing with
other Mogadishu teams for the Peace Cup. The match was sponsored by
a fledgling local administration for Mogadishu forged by Hussein
Aidid and Sudi Yalahow's rival Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
	   Somalia has not had a central government since late 1991, when
President Mohamed Siad Barre was overthrown by a coalition of
clan-based factions that later began fighting among themselves.
	   Dr. Ismail Jumale Human Rights Center called for the players'
release, saying their detentions were illegal and against the
wishes of Somalis.
	   A team fan, who asked not to be named, said the players were not
being given enough food or water and were being kept in a dark
room.
	   Also Sunday, militiamen exchanged machine-gun and grenade fire
at the K-7 junction of south Mogadishu controlled by faction leader
Osman Ali Atto.
	   Witnesses said at least two militiamen were killed and five
others wounded in a fight involving 10 battlewagons.
	   Source close to the militiamen said the gunfire started when a
convoy of six battlewagons belonging to a contractor delivering
supplies for the U.N. World Food Program tried to pass through the
K-7 junction.
	   The militiamen were annoyed by the heavy use of weaponry by the
WFP contractor, said sources who refused to be identified.

	   PERUGIA, Italy (AP) _ Police tossed tear gas into the stands to
quell unruly spectators at an Italian League game Sunday between
Perugia and Lazio of Rome, causing the referee to temporarily
suspend play.
	   Police clashed with some of the 2,500 visiting Lazio supporters
late in the first half. Smoke from tear gas drifted onto the field,
stinging the eyes of players and referee Stefano Farina. Hundreds
of the 20,000 in attendance left Renato Curi Stadium at halftime,
complaining they could not see, the ANSA news agency reported.
	   Farina stopped play and then sent the teams to the locker rooms
without allowing for injury-time play. After players returned to
the field for the second half, Farina delayed action for another 10
minutes until the smoke cleared.
	   Police continued to battle with Lazio supporters in the stands
and outside the stadium. People threw various objects, including
faucets ripped out of a stadium bathroom.
	   No injuries or arrests were immediately reported.
	   The game ended in a 2-2 draw.

<TEXT>
	   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO troops on Sunday
arrested a former Bosnian Serb police chief indicted by the
international war crimes court for murder, rape and other crimes
during the 1992-1995 Bosnian conflict.
	   Stevan Todorovic was apprehended by without incident in the
northern Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac, about 70 kilometers (44
miles) northwest of here, a NATO statement said.
	   In a statement released to reporters in Los Angeles, President
Clinton confirmed that American and other, unspecified Allied
troops took part in the arrest. Clinton, who was in California on a
fund-raising trip, said Todorovic was responsible ``for some of the
most heinous crimes that took place during the conflict in
Bosnia.''
	   Clinton said the action ``shows our continued determination to
bring to justice those responsible for war crimes in Bosnia. This
message should not be lost on those indicted war criminals still at
large.''
	   But Todorovic's lawyer, Igor Pantelic, said his client told him
by telephone from the U.N. detetention center in The Netherlands
that he had been ``kidnapped'' from a summer house in the Serbian
mountain resort Zlatibor by masked men who blindfolded him and took
across the border to Bosnia.
	   The lawyer said Todorovic told him he was taken across the Drina
river, which forms the border, in a rubber boat, put in a
helicopter and flown to Tuzla.
	   In a statement to Belgrade-based independent BK Television,
Pantelic said the arrest ``creates a dangerous precedent'' and is a
``violation of sovereignty of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,'' of
which Serbia is a part.
	   Todorovic, 41, has been indicted by the U.N. war crimes court in
The Hague, Netherlands, for ``grave breaches, violations of the
laws or customs of war and crime against humanity'' allegedly
committed in 1992 when he was police chief of Bosanski Samac.
	   Specific charges include murder, rape and torture.
	   In The Hague, tribunal spokesman Christian Chartier said
Todorovic was indicted in July 1995 on 15 counts _ five war crimes;
five ``grave breaches of the Geneva Conventions;'' and five crimes
against humanity.
	   Among his alleged offenses, he is charged with murdering one
Muslim, beating at least six others and forcing two prisoners whose
identities were not released to perform unspecified sexual acts on
each other in front of other prisoners and Serb guards _ an
allegation which carries a rape charge.
	   ``This action serves as yet another warming to all those
indicted for war crimes who are still at large that they will not
escape justice,'' NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said in a
statement early Sunday morning.
	   Todorovic is the ninth indicted suspect to be picked up in
Bosnia by NATO forces and the 26th suspect in custody out of 58
suspects indicted. He is the fourth Bosnian Serb suspect in custody
charged with offenses committed after the Serb takeover of Bosanski
Samac.
	   It was not immediately clear if he would be tried together with
the other three.
	   The operation took place a few hours before U.S. Defense
Secretary William Cohen arrived in Bosnia for a one-day visit. It
occurred two days after the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe confirmed that a Bosnian Serb
ultranationalist, Nikola Poplasen, had defeated the U.S.-backed
incumbent for president of the Bosnian Serb republic in this
month's national election.
	   Poplasen's election has raised concern about Bosnian Serb
cooperation with terms of the 1995 Dayton agreement which ended the
three and one-half year Bosnian war, especially the return of
refugees to areas from which they were driven by rival Bosnian
groups.
	   One Western diplomat, speaking on condition of anonymity,
suggested the arrest was intended as an ``early test'' of
Poplasen's assurances that he would cooperate with international
officials overseeing implementation of Dayton.
	   NATO spokeswoman Maj. Sheena Thomson described that, however, as
``pure speculation.''

	   DHAKA, Bangladesh (AP) _ Frenzied fans clashed and fired
gunshots during a soccer match, killing at least two people and
injuring 40 others in a tribal area in Bangladesh, an official said
Sunday.
	   The military was called in as the fighting spread to the streets
of Dighinala, a township 175 kilometers (110 miles) southeast of
Dhaka, on Sunday.
	   The clash erupted 12 minutes before the final whistle as one of
the teams took a 2-0 lead. Two tribal youths, both fans, died of
bullet wounds, the official said on condition of anonymity.
	   The relatives of those killed said the deaths were caused by
police, a charge denied by the government.
	   Police said they used wooden sticks to disperse the clashing
tribal and non-tribal groups.
	   Buddhist Chakma tribespeople dominate the region and they often
clash with Muslim settlers who have migrated in thousands from
overcrowded plains to settle on tibal lands in the hilly area.

Spaniards dominate the podium as Olano wins Tour of Spain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spaniard Abraham Olano clinched his first
major cycling trophy Sunday winning the 22-day Tour of Spain which
saw fellow countrymen Fernando Escartin and Jose Maria Jimenez also
take the podium.
	   Olano, 28, rode the 22-day tour in 93 hours, 43 minutes, 58
seconds, 1:23 ahead of Escartin and 2:12 in front of Jimenez.
	   American Lance Armstrong, back this season after serious cancer
treatment, finished No.4, 2:18 behind Olano and 19 second ahead of
the world's leading cyclist Laurent Jalabert of France.
	   ``It was great to win this,'' Olano told National Television
afterwards. ``We were badly accustomed to Perico (Delgado) and
Miguel (Indurain) winning every year that after the gap of
victories in recent years it's good to have another triumph for a
Spanish rider.''
	   Olano took over the tour leadership in the ninth stage and held
it until the 20th when he was relieved by fellow teammate and
countryman Jose Maria Jimenez.
	   But On Saturday he finished second in an individual time trial
ahead of Jimenez and took back the yellow shirt.
	   On Sunday he rode the 163-kilometer (101-mile) stage,
traditionally a ceremonial leg, in a relaxed manner chatting with
fellow cyclists.
	   Swiss rider Markus Zberg won the final stage edging out ahead of
the pack in a final meter sprint for a time of 4.08:38.
	   Zberg won the tour's opening stage too.
	   ``It's nice to end such a tough competition as the Vuelta in the
same fashion as I began,'' he said. `` Although winning today was
much more important.''
	   Fellow countryman and the tour's two-year defending champion,
Alex Zuelle, finished eighth in the overall standings, 6:05 behind
Olano.

Israeli Arabs clash with police in land dispute; 40 said hurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPGRADES attribution; UPDATES throughout with number of police
injured, 20 arrested, comment from town mayor, police spokeswoman &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ About 40 people were hurt Sunday in violent
clashes in north-central Israel between Israeli police and Israeli
Arabs involving a land dispute.
	   Arab and Jewish legislators had arrived in the predominantly
Arab town of Umm al-Fahm, 30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of the
port city of Haifa, to try and bring an end to the fighting, which
continued into the night.
	   Police said that 15 officers were among the injured. Dozens of
protesters were hurt, including Umm al-Fahm Mayor Raed Mahajna, who
was taken to hospital for treatment.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin said ``large numbers of police
forces,'' were deployed in the area and that 20 protesters had been
arrested.
	   Angry Arab demonstrators shouted ``Death to the Jews,'' and
``Throw them into the Sea,'' during the clashes, Israel radio
reported.
	   The fighting erupted as Israeli police moved in to tear down a
tent erected by protesters who claimed the land was unfairly
confiscated. Demonstrators threw rocks and firebombs at the police,
who responded with tear gas.
	   ``I was beaten by the chief of police and then several soldiers
tackled me and beat me with their boots and fists until I could not
get up,'' Mahajna, the mayor, told Israel's army radio, speaking by
telephone from the hospital.
	   A demonstrator told army radio that police fired rubber-coated
bullets and live ammunition. The Israeli police commander, Alik
Rom, said the reports were being checked.
	   Menuhin did not confirm live ammunition was used, but said
police lives were endangered in the clash. Under Israeli
regulations, soldiers and police may open fire with live bullets if
their lives are in danger.
	   Israeli authorities say the disputed area, near the northern
edge of the West Bank, is an Israeli army firing range. They say an
agreement was reached with the residents to appropriate about 125
acres (50 hectares) of land, in exchange for about six times as
much land elsewhere.
	   Residents of Umm el-Fahm put up a tent on the disputed land
three weeks ago. Israeli officials said they tried to negotiate
with the protesters and persuade them to leave on their own, and
sent in police to evict them after those efforts failed.
	   About 20 percent of Israel's citizens are Arabs. They live
within the original boundaries of the state, and do not include
more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

<TEXT>
	   NOTTINGHAM, England (AP) _ Tim Henman defeated Leander Paes of
India 7-6 (7-3), 6-2, 7-6 (7-5) Sunday to move Britain into next
year's World Group, the elite 16 of the Davis Cup, for the first
time since 1992.
	   In the second singles Sunday _ meaningless to the outcome _
India's Mahesh Bhupathi beat Chris Wilkinson 6-3, 6-4 as Britain
advanced 3-2 in the best-of-five tie.
	   Henman's deciding win in just over two hours gave Britain an
unbeatable 3-1 lead. Britain won Friday's two singles but India
stayed alive with a doubles win Saturday as Paes and Bhupathi
defeated Henman and Neil Broad.
	   ``It just shows how important the tiebreaks are,'' Henman said.
``We lost both yesterday in doubles and we won both today and that
was probably the difference.''
	   ``It was an important match to get back into the World Group and
it was nice to come through,'' Henman added. ``We've got the team
that deserves to be among the top 16 nations.''
	   Added coach David Lloyd, ``I think it's extremely important for
British tennis. Hopefully, we can get a good draw and win it.''
	   The match, delayed 45 minutes by rain, saw Henman take a 4-2
lead in the first set, but Paes _ the India No. 1 _ rallied to
force a tiebreaker.
	   In the tiebreaker, Henman went up 6-3 as Paes missed two volleys
and then won with a backhand service return that Paes hit into the
net.
	   Henman won the second set in 29 minutes as Paes won the first
game but lost the next five. The third set also went to a
tiebreaker after Henman blew an early lead.

Afghan's hand cut off for stealing in Saudi Arabia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi authorities on Sunday cut off
an Afghan man's right hand by sword for stealing at Islam's holiest
site in Mecca, the Interior Ministry said.
	   It did not say what Mumtaz Dirar Khawaja allegedly stole in the
mosque of Kaaba which Muslims all over the world face during their
daily prayers.
	   Khawaja was punished for defiling the sanctity of the mosque,
said the ministry statement. The punishment was carried out to set
an example, it added.
	   Saudi Arabia follows the Islamic law which prescribes the
cutting off of a thief's right hand.
	   Amputations are carried out in a public square on the rare
occasions they are implemented.

Officer gets one-month suspension for novel on police in Egypt
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   CAIRO, Egypt (AP) _ A disciplinary committee suspended a police
officer for a month on Sunday for publishing a novel about police
abuse without permission, but cited freedom of speech in dismissing
the more serious charge of defaming Egypt's security forces.
	   Brig. Hamdy el-Batran was brought before the police disciplinary
committee after publishing ``The Journal of an Officer in the
Countryside,'' a novel that portrays police abuse in the southern
province of Assiut, once a hotbed of Muslim militant activity.
	   ``The Interior Ministry adheres to the country's policy which
stresses promoting democracy and freedom of expression'' as long as
what is published is just, said the ruling by the ministry's
disciplinary committee.
	   El-Batran maintained that the book was a work of fiction which
emerged from his love of writing. However, the cases described in
the novel mirror human rights reports alleging police abuses in
Assiut.
	   The book is filled with tales of bribery, brutality and
immorality _ as well as vivid descriptions of police work.
	   Human rights groups said that officials at the Interior Ministry
objected to the novel mainly because it was written by a
high-ranking officer in its security forces, making it difficult
for them to refute or dismiss any claims it made.
	   El-Batran will be reinstated with full pay at the end of his
suspension, according to the ruling.

Spaniards dominate the podium as Olano wins Tour of Spain
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with details, quotes &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Spaniard Abraham Olano clinched his first
major cycling trophy Sunday, winning the 22-day Tour of Spain which
saw fellow countrymen Fernando Escartin and Jose Maria Jimenez also
take the podium.
	   Olano, 28, rode the 22-day tour in 93 hours, 43 minutes, 58
seconds, 1:23 ahead of Escartin, of Kelme-Costa Blanca, and 2:12 in
front of Jimenez.
	   American Lance Armstrong, on the U.S. Postal Service team and
back this season after battling cancer, finished No. 4, 2:18 behind
Olano and 19 seconds ahead of the world's leading cyclist Laurent
Jalabert of France, who was riding for Once.
	   ``It was great to win this,'' Olano told National Television
afterwards. ``We were badly accustomed to Perico (Delgado) and
Miguel (Indurain) winning every year that after the gap of
victories in recent years it's good to have another triumph for a
Spanish rider.''
	   Olano took over the tour leadership in the ninth stage and held
it until the 20th when he was relieved by Banesto teammate Jimenez.
	   But on Saturday he finished second in an individual time trial
ahead of Jimenez and took back the yellow shirt.
	   On Sunday he rode the 163-kilometer (101-mile) stage,
traditionally a ceremonial leg, in a relaxed manner chatting with
fellow cyclists.
	   Swiss rider Markus Zberg won the final stage edging out ahead of
the pack in a final meter (yard) sprint for a time of 4.08:38.
	   Zberg, riding for Post Swiss, won the tour's opening stage too.
	   ``It's nice to end such a tough competition as the Vuelta in the
same fashion as I began,'' he said. '' Although winning today was
much more important.''
	   Fellow countryman and the tour's two-year defending champion,
Alex Zuelle, finished eighth in the overall standings, 6:05 behind
Olano.

Afghan's hand cut off for stealing in Saudi Arabia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   JIDDAH, Saudi Arabia (AP) _ Saudi authorities on Sunday cut off
an Afghan man's right hand by sword for stealing at Islam's holiest
site in Mecca, the Interior Ministry said.
	   It did not say what Mumtaz Dirar Khawaja allegedly stole in the
Kaaba mosque, the focal point for prayers by which Muslims around
the world.
	   Khawaja was punished for defiling the sanctity of the mosque,
said the ministry statement. The punishment was carried out to set
an example, it added.
	   A strict interpretation of Islamic law prescribes the cutting
off of a thief's right hand. Amputations are carried out in a
public square on the rare occasions they are implemented in Saudi
Arabia.

PSV misery continues; Ajax edges win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Bobby Robson's PSV Eindhoven
continued its nightmare league season Sunday with a 4-1 hammering
at newly-promoted AZ Alkmaar.
	   Its third defeat means PSV, which came second in the Dutch
premiership last season, languishes in 11th position with just
seven points from six games.
	   Champion Ajax is also perfoming well below par, but in contrast
the Amsterdammers managed to play badly but still down NAC Breda
1-0 thanks to Ronald de Boer's first goal of the season.
	   Ajax is fourth with 14 points from seven games but Feyenoord
still leads with six wins from six.
	   Both Ajax and PSV face Portuguese Champions League opposition
Wednesday, with Ajax hosting Porto and PSV at Benfica.
	   PSV scored first through Ruud van Nistelrooy but attack-minded
AZ hit back with a vengance, and its main weapon was in-form
striker Michiel Langerak.
	   Langerak scored twice, hit the bar with a header and was pulled
down for a penalty, which Morrocan Youssef Fertout converted. The
AZ forward's six goals put him equal with Vitesse's Nikos Machlas
as joint league top-scorer.
	   A late strike from AZ's Robert van der Weert, the sending off of
Belgian defender Davy Oyen and an injury to Andre Ooijer finished
off a miserable afternoon for PSV.
	   In Sunday's evening game, FC Twente's 3-0 win at FC Utrecht took
it to tied second in the league with Vitesse Arnhem on 16 points.

Social Democrats lead, loss for Kohl, early returns show
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES WITH Kohl concession, Schroeder quote, details
throughout. NO pickup. &QL; 
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder and his Social Democrats
won national elections Sunday, ushering in the first change of
government Germany has seen after 16 years of conservative rule
under Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the West's longest-serving leader.
	   ``The Kohl era has come to an end,'' Schroeder proclaimed to the
cheering party faithful. ``Our task will be to thoroughly modernize
our country and to unblock the backlog of reform.''
	   Schroeder, 54, will be the first of his generation, rooted in
the 1960s leftist movement, to lead Europe's biggest nation. Many
voters have known no other chancellor than Kohl, and the prospect
of change brought tears of joy.
	   ``Finally, finally. I have rarely been so happy,'' said Utta
Tiedtke, 51, dabbing her eyes as she stood among the SPD revelers.
``My two children have never known anything other than Kohl.
They've only lived in a time of mediocrity. This means the end of
stagnation. We've been waiting for this so long.''
	   Kohl, 68, looked tired and sad as he stood on the stage of his
party's headquarters to concede defeat. The faithful chanted,
``Helmut! Helmut!''
	   ``I wish Herr Schroeder the best of luck and a successful time
in office,'' Kohl said.
	   Schroeder told the ARD television network that he would begin
talks Monday on building a coalition. His party won 41 percent of
the vote, according to exit polls. The Christian Democrats, winning
just 35 percent, lost its parliamentary majority.
	   Kohl's government will continue in a caretaker role until a new
coalition is formed. There is no deadline under the German
constitution.
	   The new chancellor has said he hopes to govern with the
environmentalist Greens party, which won 6.5 percent. However, it
was unclear whether the two were strong enough to form a stable
majority in parliament, and Schroeder would not say if coalition
talks would start with the Greens.
	   The other option for Schroeder is to share power with the
Christian Democrats in a so-called ``grand coalition''_ something
Germany hasn't seen in almost 30 years.
	   Kohl, however, saw no role for his party in the new government.
	   ``There is nothing more to say about this defeat. The voters
have fully and clearly decided for a Red-Green coalition,'' Kohl
said, using the German shorthand for the Social Democrats and the
Greens.
	   ``This will carry us through the transition time into the new
century,'' Kohl said.
	   Kohl had his historic moment in 1990, when he unified communist
East Germany with the West after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He
also has been a key player in preparing Europe and Germany for the
new common currency, the euro, as well as for NATO and European
Union expansion.
	   As the new chancellor, Schroeder will complete what Kohl
started, and oversee another historic change: the government's move
back to Berlin, its prewar capital, next year.
	   Besides tackling grand projects as Germany enters the 21st
century, Schroeder has serious domestic problems to address during
his four-year term.
	   Unemployment, running above 10 percent, was the main campaign
issue this year, and Schroeder has pledged to combat it primarily
by opening dialogue between unions, industry and government
officials.
	   He also has vowed to see through tax reforms that would relieve
average wage earners, as well promising to restore modest social
welfare programs cut by the Kohl government in an effort to trim
the budget.
	   ``We stand for inner security ... but also for continuity in
foreign policy,'' Schroeder said in his victory speech. ``My most
important job is the fight against the spirit of unemployment.''
	   Kohl had sought an unprecedented fifth term on the strength of
his image of stability and clout with world powers at a time of
economic turmoil in Russia and ongoing conflict in the Balkans.
	   One of the first tests of the new government will be foreign
policy, as NATO prepares for possible air strikes to quell fighting
in the Serb-led Yugoslav province of Kosovo. The issue is close to
home for Germany, which would participate in any military action
and where Kosovo refugees are already seeking asylum.
	   According to the results, the liberal Free Democrats also won
seats in the 656-seat parliament with 6.5 percent of the vote. The
ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism won 5 percent, the
minimum required for it to remain in parliament.
	   Exit polls, tallied by social scientists, are generally reliable
indicators of official results, which were not expected until after
midnight.

	   EAGLE BASE, Bosnia-Herzegovina (AP) _ NATO troops arrested a
former Bosnian Serb police chief indicted by the international war
crimes court for murder, rape and other crimes during the 1992-1995
Bosnian War, officials announced Sunday.
	   Stevan Todorovic was apprehended without incident in the
northern Bosnian town of Bosanski Samac, about 70 kms (44 miles)
northwest of here, a NATO statement said.
	   In a statement released to reporters in Los Angeles, President
Bill Clinton confirmed that U.S. and other unspecified Allied
troops took part in the arrest. Clinton said Todorovic was
responsible ``for some of the most heinous crimes that took place
during the conflict in Bosnia.''
	   Clinton said the action ``shows our continued determination to
bring to justice those responsible for war crimes in Bosnia. This
message should not be lost on those indicted war criminals still at
large. ''
	   Todorovic's lawyer, Igor Pantelic, said his client told him by
telephone from the U.N. detetention center in The Netherlands that
he had been ``kidnapped'' from a summer house in the Serbian
mountain resort Zlatibor by masked men who blindfolded him and took
across the border to Bosnia.
	   The lawyer said Todorovic told him he was taken across the Drina
river, which forms the border, in a rubber boat, put on a
helicopter and flown to Tuzla.
	   In a statement to Belgrade-based independent BK Television,
Pantelic said the arrest ``creates a dangerous precedent'' and is a
``violation of sovereignty of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia,'' of
which Serbia is a part.

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder and his Social Democrats
won national elections Sunday, ushering in the first change of
government Germany has seen after 16 years of conservative rule
under Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the West's longest-serving leader.
	   ``The Kohl era has come to an end,'' Schroeder proclaimed to the
cheering party faithful. ``Our task will be to thoroughly modernize
our country and to unblock the backlog of reform.''
	   Schroeder, 54, will be the first of his generation, rooted in
the 1960s leftist movement, to lead Europe's biggest nation. Many
voters have known no other chancellor than Kohl, and the prospect
of change brought tears of joy.
	   ``Finally, finally. I have rarely been so happy,'' said Utta
Tiedtke, 51, dabbing her eyes as she stood among the SPD revelers.
``My two children have never known anything other than Kohl.
They've only lived in a time of mediocrity. This means the end of
stagnation. We've been waiting for this so long.''
	   Kohl, 68, looked tired and sad as he stood on the stage of his
party's headquarters to concede defeat. The faithful chanted,
``Helmut! Helmut!''
	   ``I wish Herr Schroeder the best of luck and a successful time
in office,'' Kohl said.
	   Schroeder told the ARD television network that he would begin
talks Monday on building a coalition. His party won 41 percent of
the vote, according to exit polls. The Christian Democrats, winning
just 35 percent, lost its parliamentary majority.
	   Kohl's government will continue in a caretaker role until a new
coalition is formed. There is no deadline under the German
constitution.
	   The new chancellor has said he hopes to govern with the
environmentalist Greens party, which won 6.5 percent. However, it
was unclear whether the two were strong enough to form a stable
majority in parliament, and Schroeder would not say if coalition
talks would start with the Greens.
	   The other option for Schroeder is to share power with the
Christian Democrats in a so-called ``grand coalition''_ something
Germany hasn't seen in almost 30 years.
	   Kohl, however, saw no role for his party in the new government.
	   ``There is nothing more to say about this defeat. The voters
have fully and clearly decided for a Red-Green coalition,'' Kohl
said, using the German shorthand for the Social Democrats and the
Greens.
	   ``This will carry us through the transition time into the new
century,'' Kohl said.
	   Kohl had his historic moment in 1990, when he unified communist
East Germany with the West after the fall of the Berlin Wall. He
also has been a key player in preparing Europe and Germany for the
new common currency, the euro, as well as for NATO and European
Union expansion.
	   As the new chancellor, Schroeder will complete what Kohl
started, and oversee another historic change: the government's move
back to Berlin, its prewar capital, next year.
	   Besides tackling grand projects as Germany enters the 21st
century, Schroeder has serious domestic problems to address during
his four-year term.
	   Unemployment, running above 10 percent, was the main campaign
issue this year, and Schroeder has pledged to combat it primarily
by opening dialogue between unions, industry and government
officials.
	   He also has vowed to see through tax reforms that would relieve
average wage earners, as well promising to restore modest social
welfare programs cut by the Kohl government in an effort to trim
the budget.
	   ``We stand for inner security ... but also for continuity in
foreign policy,'' Schroeder said in his victory speech. ``My most
important job is the fight against the spirit of unemployment.''
	   Kohl had sought an unprecedented fifth term on the strength of
his image of stability and clout with world powers at a time of
economic turmoil in Russia and ongoing conflict in the Balkans.
	   One of the first tests of the new government will be foreign
policy, as NATO prepares for possible air strikes to quell fighting
in the Serb-led Yugoslav province of Kosovo. The issue is close to
home for Germany, which would participate in any military action
and where Kosovo refugees are already seeking asylum.
	   According to the results, the liberal Free Democrats also won
seats in the 656-seat parliament with 6.5 percent of the vote. The
ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism won 5 percent, the
minimum required for it to remain in parliament.
	   Exit polls, tallied by social scientists, are generally reliable
indicators of official results, which were not expected until after
midnight.

	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Jonas Bjorkman beat Carlos Moya 6-3,
7-5 on Sunday for his third match victory in the Davis Cup
semifinals this weekend as defending champion Sweden eliminated
Spain 4-1.
	   Julian Alonzo picked up the only point for Spain in the last
``dead'' singles match, winning 6-1, 7-6 (7-3) against Davis Cup
newcomer Thomas Johansson. Alonzo replaced Spanish second-string
Alex Corretja.
	   The 13th-ranked Bjorkman, 26, started with a four-set win Friday
over seventh-ranked Corretja and then clinched Sweden's 12th trip
to the final by winning Saturday's doubles with Nicklas Kulti in
straight sets.
	   Bjorkman, who hates to lose even ``dead'' matches, came from 1-4
in the last set to beat Moya and give the Swedes a 4-0 lead.
	   ``I have a good Davis Cup record and I'd rather improve it than
lose,'' Bjorkman said.
	   ``Maybe I didn't feel any pressure, but it's always nice to beat
Moya before next time we meet,'' he said.
	   The defending champions will face Italy, which took an
unbeatable 3-0 lead over the United States in the other semifinal
in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in the Dec. 4-6 final in Italy.
	   Last year, the Swedes trounced the United States 5-0 in the
final at Goteborg, Sweden, led by Bjorkman and Kulti in the
doubles.
	   Bjorkman was a member of the Swedish team that won the 1994
final 4-1 against Russia in Moscow, where he only played doubles.
In 1996, when France edged Sweden 3-2 at Malmoe, Sweden, Bjorkman
also played doubles only.
	   ``Even though I've won the final twice, it's always nice to get
a third one,'' Bjorkman said.
	   Bjorkman may only get doubles duty in the final if host Italy
picks clay as playing surface.
	   ``I think they'll choose clay and that means it will be
difficult for me to get a singles spot,'' said Bjorkman, whose
weakest surface is clay.
	   ``But I'm definitely going to try anything I can to be able to
play singles. But it might be that the clay court guys have to step
in and play the final.''
	   Sweden is the most successful Davis Cup nation in the last two
decades with six wins. Former great Bjorn Borg led Sweden to its
first triumph in 1975 at Stockholm's Royal Tennis Hall, the site of
the semifinals against Spain.

PSV misery continues; Ajax edges win
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) _ Bobby Robson's PSV Eindhoven
continued its nightmare league season Sunday with a 4-1 loss to
newly-promoted AZ Alkmaar.
	   Its third defeat means PSV, which came second in the Dutch
premier league last season, languishes in 11th position with just
seven points from six games.
	   Champion Ajax is also performing well below par, but still
managed to defeat NAC Breda 1-0 thanks to Ronald de Boer's first
goal of the season.
	   Ajax is fourth with 14 points from seven games while Feyenoord
leads with six wins from six.
	   Both Ajax and PSV face Portuguese Champions League opposition
Wednesday, with Ajax hosting Porto and PSV at Benfica.
	   In the game against AZ, PSV' Ruud van Nistelrooy scored first
but attack-minded AZ hit back with a vengeance.
	   Striker Michiel Langerak scored twice, hit the bar with a header
and was pulled down for a penalty, which Moroccan Youssef Fertout
converted. The AZ forward's six goals for the season made him joint
league top scorer with Vitesse's Nikos Machlas.
	   AZ's final goal was scored by Robert van der Weert.
	   PSV's miserable afternoon ended with Belgian defender Davy Oyen
being sent off and an injury to Andre Ooijer.
	   In Sunday's evening game, FC Twente's 3-0 win at FC Utrecht put
it in a tie for second place in the league with Vitesse Arnhem,
both with 16 points.

Ashdown says he sees no evidence of Serb compliance with UN
</HEADLINE>
resolution &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Following a tour of Kosovo province,
British Liberal Democrat leader Paddy Ashdown said Sunday it
appeared that Serb officials were disregarding the Security Council
warning to halt attacks on Albanian separatists.
	   Ashdown said he would withhold detailed comments until after he
meets with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Tuesday.
	   ``I am here on a fact-finding visit,'' he told reporters. ``But
we did see some villages being burnt, we saw some villages being
shelled. It is difficult to conclude that it is other than
disregard with Security Council resolution recently passed.'''
	   Ashdown toured the area west of Pristina _ Pec, Junik, Decane
and the Serbian monastery Decani.
	   ``I will look at both sides of this,'' he said. ``We want to see
some Serb refugees as well.''
	   Ashdown, a former soldier, declined to comment NATO threats
before Tuesday. But a Western diplomat, speaking on condition of
anonymity, said that the question of NATO action depends on Serb
compliance with last week's Security Council resolution.
	   ``I do not see very much compliance in this,'' he said.
	   Meanwhile, Serbian state media accused ethnic Albanian
politicians of staging a refugee gathering Saturday for the benefit
of the visiting U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees, Sadako Ogata.
	   Serb media said the ``refugees'' later returned to their homes
after Ogata left.
	   The top government official for Kosovo, Veljko Odalovic, was
quoted as saying this ``was another failed attempt by Albanian
separatists to sell lies to foreign public and humanitarian
organizations.''
	   He said the government was ``doing everything to solve the
existing humanitarian problems and provide all necessary assistance
to normalize life in the areas where Albanian terrorists and
extremists provoked conflicts.''
	   ``We hope that international organizations will understand that
Albanian separatists are using such lies to extend the life of the
defeated Albanian terrorism,'' Odalovic said.

Legend in Peruvian journalism dies at 91
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LIMA, Peru (AP) _ Aurelio Miro Quesada Sosa, co-director of
Peru's leading daily paper and one of the most distinguished
figures in Peruvian journalism, is dead at 91.
	   Miro Quesada, who had been hospitalized for several days and had
been suffering from cancer, died in a Lima hospital on Saturday.
Reports indicated the cause of death was a heart attack.
	   Intellectuals, politicians, business leaders and journalists
mourned his death on Sunday
	   Born in 1907, Miro Quesada began working at his family's paper
El Comercio at age 16, eventually rising to co-director of the
paper.
	   Fernando Belaunde Terry, the former president, referred to Miro
Quesada as ``the great teacher of all Peruvians and a great
journalist.''
	   ``For journalism this is sad news,'' said Miro Quesada's cousin
and co-director of El Comercio, Alejandro Miro Quesada. ``He
communicated the message of the great importance of ...
journalism's mission.''
	   Miro Quesada was also a professor of literature and served as
rector of the University of San Marcos. He was the author of
several books and headed various academic associations.
	   He was buried Sunday in the Presbyterian cemetery in Lima. He is
survived by his wife Elizabeth Martens and three daughters, Lucero,
Beatriz and Milagros.

Hurricane: Destitute Haitian farmers point fingers at leaders

	   BOURDETTE TI-PLACE, Haiti (AP) _ The floodwaters are receding in
Haiti's breadbasket, the Artibonite Valley, but the anger is
mounting.
	   Impoverished farmers in the central rice-growing valley long
warned of disaster if the government didn't clear silt-clogged
irrigation canals. Haiti's officials listened and did nothing.
	   Disaster struck.
	   Hurricane Georges dumped 20 inches (50 centimeters) of rain into
Haiti's central mountains last week, unleashing a terrestrial tidal
wave across the valley that swamped villages, killed dozens and
left many people missing.
	   Haiti's official death toll stood at 87 but was certain to rise,
the government said Sunday.
	   Some 250,000 acres (100,000 hectares) of tomato, onion, eggplant
and rice fields disappeared under chest-high water _ leaving the
Western Hemisphere's poorest nation more dependent than ever on
foreign emergency aid.
	   ``I personally warned government authorities that this would
happen,'' an angry Oreste Jean-Baptiste, 40, said as he churned
through the muddy lanes of the delta hamlet of Bourdette Ti-Place.
	   Jean-Baptiste, a farmer, was among 50 destitute people who took
refuge in a neighbor's compound until the waters caused by
Thursday's flooding could recede.
	   Surrounded by a tightly woven cactus hedge, the compound's seven
houses and courtyard sit on slightly higher ground than the rest of
this riverside settlement 80 miles (130 kilometers) north of
Port-au-Prince. Several hundred farm families lived here.
	   ``It sounded like an enormous engine revving up,'' Andre
Mesadieu, 63, said of the wave that rolled across the valley.
	   The mountain runoff threatened to burst the Peligre
hydroelectric dam, so technicians opened dam floodgates to avert an
even greater disaster. Hours later, Bourdette Ti-Place was
submerged.
	   Food, crops, livestock and frail, mud-and-wattle homes were
lost. Water became dangerous to drink. Refugees bed down on
roadsides and bridges. Many areas remained inaccessible by land.
	   ``Now we have questions to ask,'' said Jean-Baptiste.
	   Among them: Why weren't the canals dredged? Why was there no
flood warning? Who will bring disaster relief?
	   The farmers of Bourdette T-Place blamed the lack of action on
Haiti's politicians, who have been in political gridlock since the
Caribbean country's last prime minister resigned in June 1997.
	   Unwilling to agree on a new leader of government, unable to
adopt an economic policy, Haiti's officials haven't been able to
tap into a foreign aid fund of hundreds of millions of dollars.
	   For Hurricane Georges, the government could scrape together only
dlrs 130,000 for emergency assistance.
	   Marc Roger, international program manager for the Florida
International Volunteer Corps, spent a week training the government
civil defense bureau, which he said was ``unbelievably unprepared
and understaffed.''
	   Relief is trickling in. The U.N. Development Program donated
dlrs 100,000, Germany dlrs 95,000. The United States donated water,
food, blankets, sheets and clothing, and a mission from the U.S.
Agency for International Development was due Monday. France sent
specialists to help with water purification and to treat the
injured.
	   ``But, when you consider our needs, it is nothing but a
pittance,'' said Wesner Jordan, 35. ``The worst of it is our
feeling of abandonment.''

Despite NATO threats of intervention, violence rages on in Kosovo
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Ed: LEADS to UPDATE with Western official suggesting fewer than
15,000 refugees in the affected area &QL; 
 &UR; By ALEKSANDAR VASOVIC &QC;

<TEXT>
	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside NATO threats, Serbian
forces have launched a new offensive in southern Kosovo against
ethnic Albanian rebels who apparently regrouped in the area, Serb
and Albanian sources said Sunday.
	   A police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
number of police units, including specially trained elite troops,
have begun a mop-up operation to purge the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army from the area some 45 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of the province's capital Pristina.
	   The latest action followed a strong Serb offensive against KLA
rebels in another area _ Drenica _ located northwest of here. That
offensive came as the U.N. Security Council last week demanded an
end to the Serb crackdown and NATO finalized plans for airstrikes
if unless the fighting stops.
	   In Bosnia-Herzegovina, U.S. Defense Secretary William Cohen
repeated warnings that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic has
only ``a short period of time'' to comply with international
demands to end the Kosovo conflict.
	   ``A failure to do so presents the possibility that a military
operation against Mr. Milosevic would be necessary,'' Cohen told
reporters in Sarajevo. ``A failure to do so on his part will be met
with very strong NATO action in my judgment.''
	   The separatists have suffered defeats in southern Kosovo earlier
this year, but apparently regrouped. According to the police
sources, the rebels recently kidnapped two local Serbs, a
25-year-old and a teenager, which prompted the new action.
	   In Kosovo, a province of Serbia, ethnic Albanians outnumber
Serbs 9 to 1 and nearly all demand independence. Hundreds have died
and about quarter of a million have become displaced since the
fighting erupted earlier this year.
	   The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb forces were
attacking from three directions near the towns of Suva Reka,
Urosevac and Stimlje southwest of Pristina.
	   According to the Albanians, the attack was focusing on 11
villages in the area, three of which were on fire Sunday. Albanian
sources said 47 Serb tanks and 57 trucks were seen massing in the
area late Saturday.
	   Some estimates have placed the number of civilians displaced by
the fighting at 15,000. But an international aid official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said that figure is probably
exaggerated.

Opposition marches in Azerbaijan for third week in row
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BAKU, Azerbaijan (AP) _ For the third week in a row, thousands
of demonstrators marched through the streets of the Azerbaijani
capital Sunday to demand greater democracy and the release of
government opponents in prison.
	   No violence was reported at the march, which came two weeks
after police clashed with demonstrators and arrested dozens.
	   The Interior Ministry said there were marches in 10 other
regions of the former Soviet republic, and an unspecified number of
protesters were detained by police.
	   The political opposition in Azerbaijan has been boycotting the
upcoming presidential election and demanding changes in the
electoral system. Opposition leaders say the current system favors
incumbent President Geidar Aliyev.
	   After the latest march, opposition leaders drafted a resolution
demanding greater democracy in the country and a postponement of
the Oct. 11 presidential election.
	   They also demanded the release of all demonstrators arrested
during the march on Sept. 12, the release of all other political
prisoners and an international investigation into allegations of
torture in Azerbaijani prisons.
	   Estimates of the number of protesters in Baku on Sunday varied
wildly, with organizers of the march gauging the crowd at more than
100,000 and the Interior Ministry putting the number at 4,000.
Independent observers put the figure somewhere between, probably in
the low tens of thousands.

Israeli Arabs clash with police in land dispute; 40 said hurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS. UPDATES with fresh color, fresh quotes; officials
meeting to find solution to land dispute. Corrects police chief's
surname to Ron sted Rom &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In violent clashes reminiscent of the six-year
Palestinian uprising, Israeli troops fought with residents of an
Israeli-Arab town who rioted Sunday over a land dispute. At least
50 residents and 15 police were injured in the fighting.
	   Israeli police chief Alik Ron told reporters his forces were
having difficulty in trying to end the riots near the predominantly
Arab town of Umm al-Fahm, 30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of the
port city of Haifa, which began early Sunday and continued through
the evening.
	   Angry Arab demonstrators shouting ``Death to the Jews,'' and
``Throw them into the Sea,'' hurled firebombs and rocks at police
who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
	   As night fell, residents burned tires at the town's main access
roads. Large forces of Israeli troops wielding automatic weapons
and batons beat back demonstrators including Raed Mahajna, the
town's mayor. Israel's Magen David ambulance service said one of
the injured was taken to hospital in serious condition.
	   The fighting erupted as Israeli police moved in to tear down a
tent erected by protesters who claimed land was unfairly
confiscated from the town.
	   Israeli authorities say the disputed area, near the northern
edge of the West Bank, is an Israeli army firing range. They say an
agreement was reached with the residents to nationalize about 125
acres (50 hectares) of land, in exchange for about six times as
much land elsewhere.
	   Several hours into the fighting, Israel police had brought in
Israeli-Arab and Jewish legislators to help resolve the conflict.
	   Israel's Channel 2 TV said a deal was emerging between the army
and the town in which the land would remain in the hands of the
residents until December and officials from both sides would try to
reach a compromise over the next four months.
	   But despite the reports, unrest continued in the town, in the
heart of northern Israel.
	   ``I was beaten by the chief of police and then several soldiers
tackled me and beat me with their boots and fists until I could not
get up,'' Mahajna told Israel's army radio, speaking by telephone
from the hospital.
	   A demonstrator told army radio that police fired rubber-coated
bullets and live ammunition but Ron said the reports were being
checked.
	   ``What happened to today in this difficult and aggressive
outbreak is similar to what we saw in the Intifada,'' Ron said,
referring to the Palestinian uprising which ended in 1993.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin did not confirm live ammunition
was used, but said police lives were endangered in the clash. Under
Israeli regulations, soldiers and police may open fire with live
bullets if their lives are in danger.
	   Menuhin said ``large numbers of police forces,'' were deployed
in the area and that 20 protesters had been arrested. Menuhin said
Arab and Jewish lawmakers had arrived in the town to try and bring
an end to the fighting.
	   Residents of Umm al-Fahm put up a tent on the disputed land
three weeks ago. Israeli officials said they tried to negotiate
with the protesters and persuade them to leave on their own, and
sent in police to evict them after those efforts failed.
	   About 20 percent of Israel's citizens are Arabs. They live
within the original boundaries of the state, and do not include
more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

Despite NATO threats of intervention, violence rages on in Kosovo

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Brushing aside NATO threats, Serbian
forces have launched a new offensive in the southern separatist
province of Kosovo against ethnic Albanian rebels who apparently
regrouped, Serb and Albanian sources said Sunday.
	   A police source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said a
number of police units, including specially trained elite troops,
have begun a mop-up operation to purge the secessionist Kosovo
Liberation Army from the area some 45 kilometers (30 miles)
southwest of the provincial capital Pristina.
	   The latest action followed a strong Serb offensive against KLA
rebels in Drenica, northwest of Pristina. That offensive came as
the U.N. Security Council last week demanded an end to the Serb
crackdown and NATO finalized plans for airstrikes unless the
fighting stops in Kosovo, a province of Serbia.
	   In nearby Bosnia-Herzegovina, U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen repeated warnings that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic
has only ``a short period of time'' to comply with international
demands to end the Kosovo conflict.
	   ``A failure to do so presents the possibility that a military
operation against Mr. Milosevic would be necessary,'' Cohen told
reporters in Sarajevo. ``A failure to do so on his part will be met
with very strong NATO action in my judgment.''
	   The separatists have suffered defeats in southern Kosovo earlier
this year. According to the police sources, the rebels recently
kidnapped two local Serbs, a 25-year-old and a teen-ager, which
prompted the new action.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-to-1 in KOsovo, where nearly
all demand independence. Hundreds have died, and about quarter of a
million have become displaced since the fighting erupted earlier
this year.
	   The Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center said Serb forces were
attacking from three directions near the towns of Suva Reka,
Urosevac and Stimlje, southwest of Pristina.
	   According to the Albanians, the attack focused on 11 villages,
three of which were on fire Sunday. Albanian sources said 47 Serb
tanks and 57 trucks were seen massing in the area late Saturday.
	   Some estimates have placed the number of civilians displaced by
the fighting at 15,000. But an international aid official, speaking
on condition of anonymity, said that figure is probably
exaggerated.

State vote in eastern Germany shows strength of extremist parties
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: SUBS 3rd graf to CLARIFY; ADDS quote
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Election
 &UR; By PAUL GEITNER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SCHWERIN, Germany (AP) _ While Germany's two main parties
battled for control of the federal parliament Sunday, a state race
in the former communist east could provide political drama to
Germans concerned about smaller extreme parties on the right and
the left.
	   The ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism, which already
enjoys strong support in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, had its
first shot at being a part of a state government coalition.
	   The Social Democrats, who have been governing in a strained
coalition with the Christian Democrats, have said they will
consider the PDS as a partner if they win.
	   Polls show the Social Democrats at just under 40 percent _ 10
percent higher than 1994 _ due in part to their popular chancellor
candidate, Gerhard Schroeder. Kohl's Christian Democrats were
running close behind in the state.
	   The PDS was running about 20 percent.
	   Any government including the ex-communist party is a concern for
mainstream politicians in Bonn, who deride the party as the
remnants of the anti-democratic East German regime. But many
easterners feel the PDS better represents their interests in a
political system dominated by westerners.
	   ``They understand us better,'' said Elke Polkin, a 45-year-old
office worker who's been unemployed since 1996, when the company
she worked for went bankrupt. Besides, she said after voting in a
drab, concrete school building, ``not everything in East Germany
was bad.''
	   On the extreme-right, three rival parties were competing for
voters angry at unemployment running nearly 20 percent in the
state, the poorest in Germany. They capitalized on fears that
foreigners were taking jobs from Germans _ plastering streets with
posters demanding ``Work for Germans first!'' and ``Criminal
Foreigners Out!'' _ although less than 1 percent of the state's 1.8
million people are foreigners.
	   Pollsters put the support for the far-right at between 10
percent and 20 percent. And with the vote split, it was likely that
none of the parties would reach the 5-percent hurdle needed to
enter parliament.
	   But pollsters also suggested support could be higher, because
many surveyed won't admit backing the extreme right. That fear was
borne out in eastern Saxony-Anhalt state in the spring, when the
anti-foreigner German People's Union won a surprising 13 percent of
the vote.

Goodbye to Kohl: Germans elect a brand new government

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder and his Social Democrats
won national elections Sunday, bringing the first change of
government Germany has seen after 16 years of conservative rule
under Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the West's longest-serving leader.
	   The new chancellor will be the first of his generation, rooted
in the 1960s leftist movement, to lead Europe's biggest nation.
Throwing up his arms in a victory salute, the 54-year-old Schroeder
promised cheering supporters he would keep promises to fight
unemployment _ this year's major campaign issue _ as well as
achieve long-awaited tax and economic reforms.
	   ``The Kohl era has come to an end,'' Schroeder proclaimed. ``Our
task will be to thoroughly modernize our country.''
	   Kohl will be remembered best as the chancellor who unified
communist East Germany with the West in 1990, after the fall of the
Berlin Wall. Schroeder, too, will have his shot at history as he
oversees two monumental changes next year: the government's return
to Berlin, its prewar capital, and the switch from the trusted
German mark to the European common currency, the euro.
	   Kohl, 68, looked tired and sad as he conceded defeat. The party
faithful chanted, ``Helmut! Helmut!''
	   ``This is a hard evening for me, and for us all,'' Kohl said.
``... I wish Herr Schroeder the best of luck and a successful time
in office.'' He also announced he would not run for re-election as
chief of his party, likely making way for his protege, Wolfgang
Schaeuble.
	   Schroeder supporters streamed into the streets of Bonn, holding
balloons and chanting ``Kohl must go!'' Many voters have known no
other chancellor but Kohl, and the promise of change brought tears
of joy at party headquarters.
	   ``Finally, finally. I have rarely been so happy,'' said Uta
Tiedtke, 51, dabbing her eyes as she stood among the revelers. ``My
two children have never known anything other than Kohl. This means
the end of stagnation. We've been waiting for this so long.''
	   Schroeder, the popular governor of Lower Saxony state, has tried
to move his traditionally leftist party toward the middle to appeal
to the widest possible audience. His party's victory adds momentum
to the wave of center-left governments across Europe, after
Britain's Tony Blair and France's Lionel Jospin.
	   Schroeder told the ARD television network that he would begin
talks Monday on building a coalition. His party won 41 percent of
the vote, according to early official results. The Christian
Democrats won 35 percent.
	   Kohl's government will continue in a caretaker role until a new
coalition is formed. There is no deadline under the German
constitution.
	   The new chancellor has said he hopes to govern with the
environmentalist Greens party, which won 6.7 percent. It was
unclear, though, whether the two were strong enough to form a
stable majority in parliament. Schroeder would not say if coalition
talks would start with the Greens, who would have their first shot
at a role in government.
	   Together, the two parties would have 333 seats in the 656-seat
parliament, a shaky five-vote majority unlikely to survive
differences between the sometimes radical Greens and the more
pragmatic Social Democrats.
	   Schroeder reiterated he would not consider including in his
government the ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism, which
appeared to have won enough votes to stay in parliament. Many in
the west view the party as a troubling remnant of the former
communist East German state.
	   The other option for Schroeder is to share power with the
Christian Democrats in a so-called ``grand coalition'' _ something
Germany hasn't seen in almost 30 years.
	   Kohl, however, appeared to see no role for his party in the new
government.
	   ``There is nothing more to say about this defeat. The voters
have fully and clearly decided for a Red-Green coalition,'' Kohl
said, using the German shorthand for the Social Democrats and the
Greens.
	   Besides tackling grand projects as Germany enters the 21st
century _ European Union and NATO expansion as well as the euro and
the government move _ Schroeder has serious domestic problems to
address during his four-year term.
	   He has pledged to combat unemployment, running above 10 percent,
primarily by opening dialogue between unions, industry and
government officials. He also has vowed to see through tax reform
that would relieve average wage earners, as well to restore modest
social welfare programs cut by the Kohl government in an effort to
trim the budget.
	   ``We stand for inner security ... but also for continuity in
foreign policy,'' Schroeder said in his victory speech. ``My most
important job is the fight against the scourge of unemployment.''
	   Kohl had sought an unprecedented fifth term on the strength of
his image of stability and clout with world powers at a time of
economic turmoil in Russia and ongoing conflict in the Balkans.
	   One of the first tests of the new government will be foreign
policy, as NATO prepares for possible air strikes to quell fighting
in the Serb-led Yugoslav province of Kosovo. The issue is close to
home for Germany, which would participate in any military action
and where Kosovo refugees are already seeking asylum.
	   The liberal Free Democrats also won seats in the 656-seat
parliament with 6.2 percent of the vote.
	   Turnout was 81.5 percent of the 60.5 million voters, up from 79
percent in 1994.

Finance minister defends Russian government's economic decisions
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with Zadornov remarks. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MOSCOW (AP) _ Russia's finance minister defended the
government's decision to devalue the ruble and freeze foreign debt
last month, saying Sunday that it had little choice, a news agency
reported.
	   Finance Minister Mikhail Zadornov spoke after the government's
top economic official quit last week to protest his reappointment.
Alexander Shokhin had complained that Zadornov, as a holdover from
the government in office in August, was one of those responsible
for Russia's current economic crisis.
	   Zadornov said some of the decisions taken by the government and
Central Bank on Aug. 17, when the ruble was devalued and government
debt frozen, ``could be corrected,'' Interfax reported.
	   He noted that the government is still drafting a plan for
restructuring the frozen debt.
	   Zadornov added that the steps were dictated by the country's
financial situation.
	   Since then, he said, ``no decisions of principal importance have
been worked out. The situation remains undetermined, which is the
worst thing. Banks continue to die ... and many people transfer
money abroad.''
	   Prime Minister Yevgeny Primakov has announced some preliminary
measures to deal with the crisis, which continues to reverberate
through the economy. It will again top President Boris Yeltsin's
agenda this week.
	   On Monday, Yeltsin is scheduled to meet with Prime Minister
Yevgeny Primakov, and with three ministers appointed to the
government on Friday: Economy Minister Andrei Shapovalyants, Trade
Minister Georgy Gabunia, and Science and Technology Minister
Mikhail Kirpichnikov.
	   Shapovalyants is expected Monday to complete the formation of
the new working group established Saturday to negotiate with banks
over Russia's repayment of billions of dollars worth of treasury
bonds held by Russian and foreign banks.
	   These are the bonds frozen in August, when the cash-strapped
government announced that it would have to set new terms and timing
for repayment.
	   The working group will offer Russia's proposed terms for
repaying the debt at a meeting with bank representatives on
Tuesday, Zadornov has said.

Israeli Arabs clash with police in land dispute; 40 said hurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECASTS. UPDATES with fresh color, fresh quotes; officials
meeting to find solution to land dispute. Corrects police chief's
surname to Ron sted Rom &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In violent clashes reminiscent of the six-year
Palestinian uprising, Israeli troops fought Sunday with residents
of an Israeli-Arab town in a rioting over a land dispute, injuring
at least 50 residents and 15 police officers.
	   Israeli police chief Alik Ron told reporters his forces were
having difficulty trying to end rioting near the predominantly Arab
town of Umm al-Fahm, 30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of the port
city of Haifa. The riots began early Sunday and continued through
the evening in the heart of northern Israel.
	   Angry Arab demonstrators shouting ``Death to the Jews,'' and
``Throw them into the Sea,'' hurled firebombs and rocks at police
who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
	   As night fell, residents burned tires at the town's main access
roads. Large forces of Israeli troops wielding automatic weapons
and batons beat back demonstrators, including Mayor Raed Mahajna.
Israel's Magen David ambulance service said one of the injured was
taken to hospital in serious condition.
	   The fighting erupted as Israeli police moved in to tear down a
tent erected by protesters who claimed land was unfairly
confiscated from the town.
	   Israeli authorities say the disputed area, near the northern
edge of the West Bank, is an Israeli army firing range. They say an
agreement was reached with the residents to nationalize about 125
acres (50 hectares) of land, in exchange for about six times as
much land elsewhere.
	   Sl December, and officials from both sides would try
to reach a compromise over the next four months.
	   But despite the reports, unrest continued.
	   ``I was beaten by the chief of police and then several soldiers
tackled me and beat me with their boots and fists until I could not
get up,'' Mahajna told Israel's army radio, speaking by telephone
from the hospital.
	   A demonstrator told army radio that police fired rubber-coated
bullets and live ammunition but Ron said the reports were being
checked.
	   ``What happened to today in this difficult and aggressive
outbreak is similar to what we saw in the Intifada,'' Ron said,
referring to the Palestinian uprising which ended in 1993.
	   Police spokeswoman Linda Menuhin did not confirm live ammunition
was used, but said police lives were endangered. Under Israeli
regulations, soldiers and police may open fire with live bullets if
their lives are in danger.
	   Menuhin said ``large numbers of police forces,'' were deployed
and that 20 protesters had been arrested.
	   Residents of Umm al-Fahm put up a tent on the disputed land
three weeks ago. Israeli officials said they tried to negotiate
with the protesters and persuade them to leave on their own, and
sent in police to evict them after those efforts failed.
	   About 20 percent of Israel's citizens are Arabs. They live
within the original boundaries of the state, and do not include
more than 2 million Palestinians who live in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip.

	   The bus left the southern Andean city of Ayacucho late Saturday

midnight near the town of Larcay, 183 miles (295 kilometers)

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Key facts about Germany's national
election:
	   HISTORY: 14th national vote since German Federal Republic formed
in 1949, four years after Hitler's defeat.
	   WHAT'S AT STAKE: The 656-seat lower house of parliament, which
formally elects new chancellor. This government will usher in
German capital's return to Berlin next year after decades of being
relegated to sleepy, provincial Bonn after World War II.
	   MAIN POLITICAL PARTIES: Conservative Christian Democrats and
center-left Social Democrats, biggest parties, are only ones
fielding chancellor candidates. Also in parliament: Christian
Social Union, Bavarian sister party to Christian Democrats; Free
Democrats, small pro-business party also allied with Christian
Democrats; environmentalist Greens; Party of Democratic Socialism,
successor to East German communists.
	   CANDIDATES: Chancellor Helmut Kohl, 68, Christian Democrat,
running for unprecedented fifth term after 16 years in office.
Gerhard Schroeder, 54, Social Democrat, popular governor of Lower
Saxony state.
	   ISSUES: Jobs, with unemployment at postwar highs. Immigration,
with extreme-right parties saying foreigners are stealing German
jobs. Eastern Germany, economically depressed since Kohl brought it
into western fold in 1990, could swing national vote. Both major
parties agree on European Union and NATO expansion and Jan. 1
introduction of single European currency.
	   NUMBER OF VOTERS: About 60.5 million.

Goodbye to Kohl: Germans elect a brand new government

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder and his Social Democrats
won national elections Sunday, bringing the first change of
government Germany has seen after 16 years of conservative rule
under Chancellor Helmut Kohl, the West's longest-serving leader.
	   The new chancellor will be the first of his generation, rooted
in the 1960s leftist movement, to lead Europe's biggest nation.
Throwing up his arms in a victory salute, the 54-year-old Schroeder
promised cheering supporters he would keep promises to fight
unemployment _ this year's major campaign issue _ as well as
achieve long-awaited tax and economic reforms.
	   ``The Kohl era has come to an end,'' Schroeder proclaimed. ``Our
task will be to thoroughly modernize our country.''
	   Kohl will be remembered best as the chancellor who unified
communist East Germany with the West in 1990, after the fall of the
Berlin Wall. Schroeder, too, will have his shot at history as he
oversees two monumental changes next year: the government's return
to Berlin, its prewar capital, and the switch from the trusted
German mark to the European common currency, the euro.
	   Kohl, 68, looked tired and sad as he conceded defeat. The party
faithful chanted, ``Helmut! Helmut!''
	   ``This is a hard evening for me, and for us all,'' Kohl said.
``... I wish Herr Schroeder the best of luck and a successful time
in office.'' He also announced he would not run for re-election as
chief of his party, likely making way for his protege, Wolfgang
Schaeuble.
	   Schroeder supporters streamed into the streets of Bonn, holding
balloons and chanting ``Kohl must go!'' Many voters have known no
other chancellor but Kohl, and the promise of change brought tears
of joy at party headquarters.
	   ``Finally, finally. I have rarely been so happy,'' said Uta
Tiedtke, 51, dabbing her eyes as she stood among the revelers. ``My
two children have never known anything other than Kohl. This means
the end of stagnation. We've been waiting for this so long.''
	   Schroeder, the popular governor of Lower Saxony state, has tried
to move his traditionally leftist party toward the middle to appeal
to the widest possible audience. His party's victory adds momentum
to the wave of center-left governments across Europe, after
Britain's Tony Blair and France's Lionel Jospin.
	   Schroeder told the ARD television network that he would begin
talks Monday on building a coalition. His party won 41 percent of
the vote, according to early official results. The Christian
Democrats won 35 percent.
	   Kohl's government will continue in a caretaker role until a new
coalition is formed. There is no deadline under the German
constitution.
	   The new chancellor has said he hopes to govern with the
environmentalist Greens party, which won 6.7 percent. It was
unclear, though, whether the two were strong enough to form a
stable majority in parliament. Schroeder would not say if coalition
talks would start with the Greens, who would have their first shot
at a role in government.
	   Together, the two parties would have 334 seats in the 656-seat
parliament, a shaky six-vote majority that might not survive
differences between the sometimes radical Greens and the more
pragmatic Social Democrats.
	   Schroeder reiterated he would not consider including in his
government the ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism, which
won enough votes to stay in parliament. Many in the west view the
party as a troubling remnant of the former communist East German
state.
	   The other option for Schroeder is to share power with the
Christian Democrats in a so-called ``grand coalition'' _ something
Germany hasn't seen in almost 30 years.
	   Kohl, however, appeared to see no role for his party in the new
government.
	   ``There is nothing more to say about this defeat. The voters
have fully and clearly decided for a Red-Green coalition,'' Kohl
said, using the German shorthand for the Social Democrats and the
Greens.
	   Besides tackling grand projects as Germany enters the 21st
century _ European Union and NATO expansion as well as the euro and
the government move _ Schroeder has serious domestic problems to
address during his four-year term.
	   He has pledged to combat unemployment, running above 10 percent,
primarily by opening dialogue between unions, industry and
government officials. He also has vowed to see through tax reform
that would relieve average wage earners, as well to restore modest
social welfare programs cut by the Kohl government in an effort to
trim the budget.
	   ``We stand for inner security ... but also for continuity in
foreign policy,'' Schroeder said in his victory speech. ``My most
important job is the fight against the scourge of unemployment.''
	   Kohl had sought an unprecedented fifth term on the strength of
his image of stability and clout with world powers at a time of
economic turmoil in Russia and ongoing conflict in the Balkans.
	   One of the first tests of the new government will be foreign
policy, as NATO prepares for possible air strikes to quell fighting
in the Serb-led Yugoslav province of Kosovo. The issue is close to
home for Germany, which would participate in any military action
and where Kosovo refugees are already seeking asylum.
	   The liberal Free Democrats also won seats in the 656-seat
parliament with 6.2 percent of the vote.
	   Turnout was 81.5 percent of the 60.5 million voters, up from 79
percent in 1994.

McGwire hits No. 69

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire ended his season as mightily as he
started it.
	   McGwire hit his 69th homer on the season's final day, connecting
against Montreal rookie Mike Thurman in the third inning Sunday to
move three ahead of Sammy Sosa and eight in front of Roger Maris'
old record.
	   Big Mac, who got Nos. 67 and 68 Saturday, hit a 1-1 fastball 377
feet (115 meters) into the left-field seats. After stomping on home
plate, he took a few slow steps, then made several salutes to the
crowd.
	   The usual sellout crowd that had stood well before his at-bat
demanded and got not one, but two, curtain calls.
	   Kerry Woodson, a 22-year-old body shop worker from Maryland
Heights, Missouri, wound up with the ball and said he didn't know
what he would do with it.
	   ``I reached up, closed my eyes, and it landed in my glove,''
Woodson said. ``It's a dream come true. I hope he doesn't hit any
more today.''
	   McGwire began the season with a grand slam on March 31 against
the Dodgers' Ramon Martinez. He led the home run race all season
except when Sosa twice passed him briefly _ and then for only 103
minutes in all.
	   Sosa led for 58 minutes on Aug. 19 before McGwire regained went
back ahead with his 48th and 49th homers in the same game at
Chicago. Sosa led for 45 minutes on Friday when he hit his 66th
before McGwire answered.
	   Sunday was the Cardinals' final game of the season. Sosa's Cubs,
who played at Houston, did not know if their regular season would
end or if there would be a playoff game for the NL wild-card spot.
	   Before connecting Friday, McGwire had been homerless in 14
at-bats.

Madrid alone atop of league; Zaragoza moves into second place

<TEXT>
	   MADRID, Spain (AP) _ Bottom-placed division newcomer Villareal
thrashed Salamanca 5-0 Sunday in a round that left Real Madrid lone
league leader after Mallorca failed to keep up the chase on only
drawing 0-0 against Oviedo.
	   Madrid struck a two-point advantage on downing Athetlic de
Bilabo 3-2 away from home Saturday. It now lies one point above
Zaragoza which won its fourth-round game 3-1 against Racing.
	   Mallorca, coached by Argentine Hector Cuper, now lies No.3 with
eight points, one ahead of Arrigo Sacchi's Atletico de Madrid which
trounced Real Sociedad 4-1 Saturday.
	   Defending league champion FC Barcleona lags behind with six
points after only managing a 2-2 draw against Celta.
	   Other fourth-round results were: Valladolid 3, Valencia 1; Betis
1, Extremadura 1; Tenerife 1, Alaves 2 and Deportivo de La Coruna
1, Espanyol 1.
 &UR; Villareal 5, Salamanca 0
	   Rumanian World Cup star Gica Craioveanu scored two goals in the
20th and 54th minutes to set struggling Villareal on the road to a
5-0 victory, its first this season. Antonio Diaz got the third in
the 58th while Manuel Alfaro grabbed two in the 81st and 90th
minutes.
	   Craioveanu, with four goals, lies second in the leading scorers'
table behind Real Madrid's Raul Gonzalez who boasts five.
	   Villareal now has four points while Betis falls to last place
with two points.
 &UR; Zaragoza 3, Racing 1 &QC; 
	   Zaragoza moved into second place a point Real Madrid with this
victory. Brazilian Jamelli scored first for the host in the 32nd
minute with Santiago Aragon doubling it in the 46th. Uruguayan
defender snatched one back in the 62nd but teammate David Billabona
ruined the day for Racing by scoring an own goal in the 89th minute
to make it 3-1.

Far right loses only parliament seat; rightist gains in Senate
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with results; corrects to third ballot in Toulon in
4th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PARIS (AP) _ The far-right National Front lost its only
remaining seat in the French parliament after its candidate was
defeated in a by-election Sunday in the southern port city of
Toulon.
	   With almost all votes counted, Odette Casanova, a Socialist, had
51.5 percent, beating Cendrine Le Chevallier, of the National
Front, who won 48.5 percent.
	   Casanova overturned a narrow defeat in a first round of voting
last Sunday.
	   It was the third time voters in Toulon have cast ballots to
choose a National Assembly representative.
	   In February, the election of Le Chevallier's husband,
Jean-Marie, a National Front deputy, was annulled after he was
found guilty of breaking campaign financing rules.
	   In May, Casanova beat Le Chevallier by just 33 votes. But the
vote was annulled after the National Front protested the count.
	   The National Front, which has won about 15 percent in recent
elections, blames immigrants, particularly from North Africa, for
high unemployment and urban violence. It has also been accused of
anti-Semitism.
	   Although it has lost its voice in the National Assembly, or
parliament, it still remains a powerful force in regional politics.
	   Meanwhile, President Jacques Chirac's Rally for the Republic
Party was the main beneficiary in senatorial elections Sunday,
gaining five or six seats, according to preliminary results after a
day of voting by municipal and regional councillors and National
Assembly members to renew one third of the chamber.
	   The ruling Socialists stood to gain three seats _ below the
party's expectations. The centrist Union for French Democracy lost
two seats. Voting covered 38 departments and three overseas
territories.
	   Some 102 seats were being renewed in the 321-seat chamber where
the right enjoys a clear majority. Senators serve nine-year terms
and about a third of the chamber is elected every three years.
	   Prime Minister Lionel Jospin, who recently described it as ``an
anomaly,'' says the chamber must undergo reform.
	   Althouth the Senate has far less power than the National
Assembly, it can amend legislation and occasionally has thwarted
government projects.

Hackett sets world short-course mark
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PERTH, Australia (AP) _ Grant Hackett sliced more than six
seconds off Kieren Perkins' world short-course swimming record in
the 1,500 meters at the Australian short course championships
Sunday night.
	   Hackett went out fast in the first 500 meters and continued to
gather pace for the rest of the race the race to finish in 14
minutes, 19.55 seconds.
	   The Gold Coast swimmer later refused to speculate how much
faster he could race, saying he didn't want to set limitations on
himself.
	   Daniel Kowalski also put in a solid performance in the 1,500 to
finish second in 14:43.55.
	   Perkins, who had held the world record since 1993, missed the
race due to illness and missed selection for the Australian team
for next April's world short course championships. (djp)

Castro says speedy hurricane evacuation saved many from death
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ANITA SNOW &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   HAVANA (AP) _ President Fidel Castro said Sunday that the speedy
evacuation of hundreds of thousands of people probably saved many
from dying during Hurricane Georges' march across Cuba last week.
	   ``The first victory was to reduce the losses,'' Castro said in
government broadcasts of a Friday night ceremony honoring leaders
of the Committees for the Defense of the Revolution, which form a
kind of neighborhood watch organization that monitors
``anti-revolutionary.''
	   While some Cubans often criticize block leaders as ideological
busybodies, the committees are praised by party officials for their
ability to mobilize people during emergencies. Castro told the
group's leaders that the government must help the thousands left
homeless and assess agricultural damage from the hurricane.
	   The government said five people died when Georges cut across
Cuba on Thursday and Friday. The hurricane killed more than 300
people in its rampage through the Caribbean.
	   In Havana, activities were back to normal Sunday, two days after
schools and the airport were closed and public transportation was
suspended while heavy rains and winds lashed the capital.
	   Without providing specifics, he said banana and other crops in
the island's east were damaged, along with homes and electrical
plants.
	   Among the most affected regions, Castro mentioned the
easternmost province of Guantanamo, where coffee and banana
plantations were damaged.
	   Earlier reports said thousands of Cuban homes were flooded,
coffee, cacao and banana crops were damaged, and 200,000 people
were evacuated.
	   It remained unclear what the hurricane's passage will ultimately
mean for Cuba's drought-stricken east. While agricultural losses
appear to have been widespread, Cubans hope Georges filled eastern
reservoirs with enough water.

Game held up by tear gas as police, fans clash in stands

 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with eight arrests, one officer injured, ANSA report
that fan threw tear gas into stands. &QL; 
 &UR; With AP Photos ROM103, ROM104 &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   PERUGIA, Italy (AP) _ Tear gas was tossed into the stands at an
Italian League game Sunday between Perugia and Lazio of Rome,
causing the referee to temporarily suspend play.
	   Police clashed with some of the 2,500 visiting Lazio supporters
late in the first half. Smoke from tear gas drifted onto the field,
stinging the eyes of players and referee Stefano Farina. Hundreds
of the 20,000 in attendance left Renato Curi Stadium at halftime,
complaining they could not see, the ANSA news agency reported.
	   Eight people, identified as Lazio hooligans by police, were
arrested. One officer was injured in the clashes.
	   Farina stopped play and then sent the teams to the locker rooms
without allowing for injury-time play. After players returned to
the field for the second half, Farina delayed action for another 10
minutes until the smoke cleared.
	   According to ANSA, tear gas landed in the seats after Lazio
supporters retrieved and tossed a cannister police had launched.
	   Police battled with Lazio supporters in the stands and outside
the stadium. People threw various objects, including faucets ripped
out of a stadium bathroom.
	   The game ended in a 2-2 draw.

Europeans welcome Social Democrats' victory in Germany
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Left-of-center European leaders welcomed the
Social Democrats' election victory in Germany on Sunday and its
promise of a fresh, new leadership for the millenium.
	   ``It's a new era opening up,'' British Labor Party Prime
Minister Tony Blair said.
	   He called Gerhard Schroeder, the man set to replace Helmut Kohl
as chancellor, a man of ``tremendous ability.''
	   Schroeder, whose party won 41 percent of the vote, according to
exit polls, hopes to govern in coalition with the environmentalist
Greens party, which won 6.5 percent.
	   ``This whole election result has been a tremendous triumph for
him and the fact that we have governments in France and Germany and
Great Britain and elsewhere who share the same perspective,'' Blair
said. ``We will do what we can to create a Europe that is
prosperous, that is a highly competitive modern economy but
combines that with strong levels of social justice.''
	   ``That, after all, is what we're all in politics for,'' Blair
said.
	   He told reporters at a Labor Party conference in Blackpool,
England that the governments in Britain, Germany and France would
work to create a Europe that was prosperous and highly competitive,
but which had a strong commitment to social justice.
	   Blair added praise for the departing chancellor.
	   ``I pay tribute to Helmut Kohl for his place in history, for all
things he has done for Germany and for Europe,'' Blair said.
	   Austria's Social Democratic Chancellor Viktor Klima agreed.
	   ``One must express respect and thanks to a truly great European,
Helmut Kohl,'' he said.
	   But Schroeder's victory was a ``historic success ... a success
for a Europe of employment, success for a Europe with more social
justice and a success for a Europe of social democracy,'' Klima
said.
	   In The United States, President Bill Clinton offered Schroeder
his ``sincerest congratulations.''
	   ``He and I had good discussions in Berlin this spring and in
Washington this summer. I look forward to working closely with
him,'' Clinton said during a political trip to Texas. ``Germany is
one of America's closest allies. As always, our two governments
will be fully engaged in a comprehensive policy agenda. ''
	   ``I also want to convey my gratitude and that of all Americans
to Helmut Kohl,'' the president said. ``During his 16-year tenure,
he has made historic contributions to the unity of his nation, the
strength of our Euro-Atlantic community and to peace throughout the
world.''

Nasal spray flu vaccine shown to be more effective than flu shot
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By DANIEL Q. HANEY &QC; 
 &UR; AP Medical Editor &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SAN DIEGO (AP) _ An experimental new nasal spray not only takes
the sting out of flu vaccination, it also appears to work
substantially better than the standard flu shot.
	   Research presented Sunday shows that the spray vaccine did a
surprisingly good job of protecting children from last winter's flu
bug _ a strain that the regular flu shot was virtually worthless
against.
	   ``These results are very promising,'' said Dr. Nancy J. Cox, a
flu expert at the National Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention in Atlanta.
	   The vaccine, called FluMist, is being developed by Aviron of
Mountain View, California, which sponsored the latest study with
the National Institutes of Health.
	   Finding a flu vaccine that avoids needles has obvious advantages
for children and anyone else who hates shots. However, the latest
data suggest that the spray approach may also provide more powerful
protection against the flu.
	   Each year, the CDC, the World Health Organization and the U.S.
Food and Drug Administration choose the three strains of the flu
virus that appear most likely to be problems during the upcoming
flu season. These are used to make the flu shot, which consists of
killed viruses.
	   Going into last winter, the agencies chose wrong. They picked
strains called A/Shenzhen, A/Wuhan and B/Harbin-like. The true
culprit turned out to be a variety of flu called A/Sydney. Cox said
the flu shot offered only marginal protection against this strain.
	   The nasal spray variety did much better, even though it
contained the same three flu strains. A study of 1,358 children
last winter showed that it was 86 percent protective against
A/Sydney.
	   ``What happened last year with A/Sydney is very exciting. This
was a true test, and the vaccine passed with flying colors. Right
now, it looks like the spray has advantages,'' said Dr. Dominick
Iacuzio of the NIH.
	   Even though the two vaccines were not compared head to head,
researchers said they feel certain that the spray variety was
substantially better, at least in last winter's outbreak.
	   Results of the study were presented by Dr. Robert Belshe of
Saint Louis University at an infectious disease meeting sponsored
by the American Society for Microbiology.
	   In the study, 917 children received the spray vaccine, while 441
got dummy sprays. Two percent of the vaccinated children got the
flu, compared with 13 percent in the comparison group.
	   Doctors believe the spray works better because it is made with a
weakened virus rather than a dead one. When sprayed up the nose,
the virus causes a harmless infection and produces new copies of
itself.
	   ``We believe the live vaccine induces a fuller complement of
immune responses,'' said Belshe. This gives the body an edge even
against strains of the flu virus that are not included in the
vaccine.
	   While the vaccine is likely to be aimed initially at children,
Belshe said it probably will make sense for healthy adults as well.
Researchers suspect that for the elderly, who are especially prone
to serious flu infections, vaccination with both the spray and the
shot may be better than either alone.
	   Aviron applied to the FDA for a license to sell FluMist in June,
hoping to get the vaccine on the market by the 1999-2000 flu
season. However, the FDA sent back the application last month,
saying it needed more information on manufacturing issues.
	   J. Leighton Read, Aviron's chairman, said Sunday the company now
hopes to sell the vaccine for the 2000-2001 flu season. He said the
company has not decided how much to charge for the spray, although
it is likely to be more expensive than the flu shot.

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire ended his season as mightily as he
started it.
	   McGwire hit his 69th and 70th homers on the season's last day, a
fitting finale for a record-smashing year he began with a grand
slam on opening day.
	   Big Mac, who hit five homers on the final weekend, connected
against Montreal rookie Mike Thurman in the third inning Sunday,
then homered off Carl Pavano for No. 70 in the seventh. McGwire
moved four ahead of Sammy Sosa and nine _ nine! _ in front of Roger
Maris' old record.
	   Big Mac hit a 1-1 fastball 377 feet (115 meters) into the
left-field seats for No. 69. After stomping on home plate, he took
a few slow steps, then made several salutes to the crowd.
	   The usual sellout crowd that had stood well before his at-bat
demanded and got not one, but two, curtain calls.
	   Kerry Woodson, a 22-year-old body shop worker from Maryland
Heights, Mo., wound up with the ball and said he didn't know what
he would do with it.
	   ``I reached up, closed my eyes, and it landed in my glove,''
Woodson said. ``It's a dream come true. I hope he doesn't hit any
more today.''
	   He didn't get his wish.

U.S. official hopes for new military relationship with Nigeria
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By GILBERT DA COSTA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ U.S. Assistant Defense Secretary Franklin
Kramer arrived in Nigeria's capital Sunday for a visit aimed at
expanding ties with the ruling military, which has promised to hand
over power to elected civilians next year.
	   Kramer, who was accompanied by about eight other U.S. officials,
told journalists soon after arriving at the international airport
in Abuja that Washington seeks to ``over time, build a new
military-to-military relationship with Nigeria.''
	   Kramer is the first ranking U.S. official to visit this oil-rich
West African country since Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering
came in early August.
	   U.S. officials said on condition of anonymity that Kramer's
visit was part of Washington's plan to offer training and other
assistance to Nigeria's military as a ``carrot'' in return for
allowing further democratic reforms.
	   Nigerian military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar has released
dozens of political prisoners and pledged to allow democratic
elections in February and a handover of power by the end of May.
	   The military has ruled Nigeria, Africa's most populous country,
for all but 10 years since independence from Britain in 1960.
	   ``The Nigerian military will play a key role in the transition
and this will be true up to the installation of the new government
and thereafter. But the key is to complete the transition to
civilian government,'' Kramer said.
	   ``As you know, the President of the United States and Gen.
Abubakar have had extensive and very fruitful discussions on the
transition to democracy and I'm here to continue with those
discussions,'' he said.
	   Kramer is expected to meet Abubakar and other top military
officials before he returns home on Tuesday.
	   He praised Nigerians for setting forth on an ``encouraging
vision for a new Nigeria ... based on the principles of democratic
participation and a military that serves the people rather than
controls the people.''
	   Pickering's visit, just a month after Abubakar came to power
following the death of the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, was
marred by the demise of Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola, who fell ill during a meeting with
Pickering and other U.S. officials.
	   Abiola's death sparked days of rioting, and wild accusations the
U.S. and Nigerian government of involvement. A subsequent autopsy
determined that Abiola died of natural causes linked to a weakened
heart.
	   Abiola was the apparent winner of the 1993 presidential
elections that were canceled by the military. He was jailed the
following year and accused of treason by Abacha, whose death in
July was also ascribed to heart failure.

Left-of-center Europeans welcome Social Democrats' victory in

<TEXT>
	   LONDON (AP) _ Left-of-center European leaders welcomed the
Social Democrats' election victory in Germany on Sunday and its
promise of a fresh, new leadership for the millenium.
	   ``It's a new era opening up,'' British Labor Party Prime
Minister Tony Blair said.
	   He called Gerhard Schroeder, the man set to replace Helmut Kohl
as chancellor, a man of ``tremendous ability.''
	   Schroeder, whose party won 41 percent of the vote, according to
exit polls, hopes to govern in coalition with the environmentalist
Greens party, which won 6.5 percent.
	   ``This whole election result has been a tremendous triumph for
him and the fact that we have governments in France and Germany and
Great Britain and elsewhere who share the same perspective,'' Blair
said. ``We will do what we can to create a Europe that is
prosperous, that is a highly competitive modern economy but
combines that with strong levels of social justice.''
	   ``That, after all, is what we're all in politics for,'' Blair
said.
	   He told reporters at a Labor Party conference in Blackpool,
England that the governments in Britain, Germany and France would
work to create a Europe that was prosperous and highly competitive,
but which had a strong commitment to social justice.
	   Blair added praise for the departing chancellor.
	   ``I pay tribute to Helmut Kohl for his place in history, for all
things he has done for Germany and for Europe,'' Blair said.
	   Austria's Social Democratic Chancellor Viktor Klima agreed.
	   ``One must express respect and thanks to a truly great European,
Helmut Kohl,'' he said.
	   But Schroeder's victory was a ``historic success ... a success
for a Europe of employment, success for a Europe with more social
justice and a success for a Europe of social democracy,'' Klima
said.
	   Goeran Persson, Sweden's Social Democrat prime minister, said he
was ``pleasantly surprised'' by Schroeder's success. ``It's their
turn to govern now, after so many years in opposition,'' Persson
said.
	   Pending official confirmation of the results, Spain's
conservative government said it wished to ``congratulate both the
German people and the Social Democrat candidate Schroeder,'' adding
that Madrid hoped Schroeder would continue Kohl's contribution to
the European Union.
	   In The United States, President Bill Clinton offered Schroeder
his ``sincerest congratulations.''
	   ``He and I had good discussions in Berlin this spring and in
Washington this summer. I look forward to working closely with
him,'' Clinton said during a political trip to Texas. ``Germany is
one of America's closest allies. As always, our two governments
will be fully engaged in a comprehensive policy agenda. ''
	   ``I also want to convey my gratitude and that of all Americans
to Helmut Kohl,'' the president said. ``During his 16-year tenure,
he has made historic contributions to the unity of his nation, the
strength of our Euro-Atlantic community and to peace throughout the
world.''

	   With two on and two outs in the seventh and the score 3-all, he
lined a first-pitch fastball 370 feet (113 meters) over the
left-field wall at 3:19 p.m.
	   This time, even a curtain call from McGwire didn't quiet the
46,110 fans, who remained on their feet, cheering even as Brian
Jordan took a called third strike for the third out of the inning.
	   The second home run ball landed in a party box and was snared by
Phil Ozerski of Olivette, Missouri, attending the game with a group
of Washington University research lab scientists.
	   McGwire, who has 10 multihomer games this year and 53 in his
career, hit a go-ahead homer for the 24th time this season.
	   He opened the year with a slam on March 31 against the Dodgers'
Ramon Martinez, then led the home run race all season except when
Sosa twice passed him briefly _ and then for only 103 minutes in
all.
	   Sosa led for 58 minutes on Aug. 19 before McGwire regained went
back ahead with his 48th and 49th homers in the same game at
Chicago. Sosa led for 45 minutes on Friday when he hit his 66th
before McGwire answered.
	   Sunday was the Cardinals' final game of the season. Sosa's Cubs,
who played at Houston, did not know if their regular season would
end or if there would be a playoff game for the NL wild-card spot.
	   Before connecting Friday, McGwire had been homerless in 14
at-bats.

	   SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Christian
Vallenilla picked up a wooden stick, then smacked his third home
run of the day in the stadium where Sammy Sosa used to play.
	   ``This one's for Sammy,'' the 11-year-old boy said.
	   Hurricane Georges nearly destroyed the stadium in Sosa's
hometown of San Pedro de Macoris. Light towers twisted to the
ground and girders stretched skyward where a roof used to be. In
the bleachers, soiled laundry dried.
	   The outfield wall is gone, and Christian's house, half-flattened
by the hurricane, now has a direct view of home plate.
	   Yet despite no power, telephones or running water, hundreds in
this baseball-crazed city scrambled Sunday to find places to hear
Sosa's final regular-season game on radio _ praying that he could
catch Mark McGwire, who on Sunday raised his record total to 70.
	   It wasn't easy. The lone TV station broadcasting in the
Dominican Republic showed a movie about a hurricane. And without
batteries to power their radios, most San Pedro residents were
unable to follow Sosa when the Chicago Cubs played the Astros in
Houston.
	   Men craned their necks into taxis stopped at street corners to
hear the game on radio. Some crowded into sports betting parlors
around the city.
	   ``I think the Cubs are going to win, but even if I didn't I'm
with Sammy Sosa,'' said Juan Richardson, 28, a security officer in
San Pedro's factory district who laid down dlrs 3 on Chicago.
	   The children playing a pickup game in the stadium outfield all
lived in houses heavily damaged by Georges. But they still found
time to play and to pose for pictures, giving Sosa's trademark
two-fingered salute.
	   ``I want to be a great ballplayer just like Sammy Sosa,''
Christian said. ``We play a lot of ball here.''
	   Sosa's seven-bedroom house received little damage _ a few broken
windows and a toppled yard fence.
	   His kid brother Carlos, 21, said the Sosa family was thinking
about those less fortunate. The storm killed more than 200
Dominicans and made thousands homeless.
	   ``I know what the poor masses are. I was one of the poor masses
and I know what it is to have a house one day and the next not have
anything,'' Carlos said.
	   Sammy, he added, felt the same way and planned to help San Pedro
get back on its feet.
	   ``Sammy is one of those people who, if you are happy, then he's
happy,'' Carlos said.
	   Georges' eye passed over this city about 40 miles (65
kilometers) east of Santo Domingo, and most homes sustained
moderate to severe damage. Three people were killed in town. Fallen
trees and power lines littered the muddy streets.
	   Two doors down from a shopping mall owned by Sosa _ Plaza 30-30,
named after his first 30-homer, 30-steal season _ long lines formed
outside a water distribution center. One man siphoned water from a
plaza fountain, which has a small statue of Sosa.
	   Eduardo Torreano, 32, said he used to shine shoes and wash cars
with Sosa when they were kids. Torreano, who lost his home to the
hurricane, still does.
	   ``We are his people. He hasn't forgotten us,'' Torreano said of
Sosa. ``Sammy will come back soon, and he will help.''

German grammar changes voted out in northern state
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KIEL, Germany (AP) _ Voters in a northern state Sunday rejected
controversial planned changes to German grammar in an effort to
stop teaching of new rules some parents say are confusing.
	   If the Schleswig-Holstein state parliament confirms the results,
the state would be the only one in Germany to drop the reforms.
Germany's other states have decided to abide by a July supreme
court decision upholding the grammar changes.
	   However, even in Schleswig-Holstein, students have started
learning the new rules, which already have been incorporated into
three-quarters of the state's elementary school textbooks.
	   Among the changes: shorter compound nouns, consistent spellings,
fewer comma rules _ nine instead of 52, and eliminating the old
German letter for a double ``s,'' which looks like a floppy,
cursive B.
	   While Austria and Switzerland have taken the changes in stride,
many Germans opposed them. Prominent German authors and
intellectuals argued that the language of Goethe and Schiller is
good enough for today's children.

Nebraska picks up ground on No. 1 Ohio State in AP poll

<TEXT>
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ Nebraska picked up support in its pursuit of No.
1 Ohio State, while Washington tumbled out of the Top 10 in The
Associated Press' college football poll.
	   After a 55-7 victory over the Huskies, the Cornhuskers (4-0)
strengthened their position at No. 2, while the idle Buckeyes (3-0)
remained atop the poll with 58 first-place votes and 1,737 points.
	   Nebraska received seven first-place votes and 1,660 points
Sunday from the 70 sportswriters and broadcasters on the AP panel.
Last week, the Huskers had one first-place vote and 1,601 points.
	   Washington (2-1), meanwhile, dropped from No. 9 to No. 20 after
its most lopsided defeat since a 52-0 loss to Alabama in 1975.
	   Tennessee (3-0) moved up a spot to No. 3 after a 42-7 win over
Houston, while UCLA (2-0), which had its game against Miami
postponed because of Hurricane Georges, slipped to No. 4. Kansas
State, a 62-7 winner over Northeast Louisiana, remained No. 5.
	   The Vols had two first-place votes and 1,544 points, while the
Bruins had a first-place vote and 1,538 points. The Wildcats (4-0)
collected two first-place votes and 1,503 points.
	   LSU was No. 6, followed by Penn State, Florida, Florida State
and Virginia.
	   Syracuse was No. 11, followed by Georgia, Wisconsin, Arizona,
Colorado, West Virginia, Oregon, Texas A and M, Virginia Tech and
Washington.
	   Southern California, a 30-10 loser at Florida State, dropped
three places to No. 21, followed by Arkansas, a tie for No. 23
between Missouri and Notre Dame, and No. 25 Michigan.
	   In the USA Today/ESPN coaches' poll, the top five were: Ohio
State, Nebraska, Kansas State, UCLA and Tennessee.
	   Virginia (4-0), which beat Duke 24-0, was the only new member of
the Top 10, while Arkansas made the Top 25 for the first time since
Dec. 3, 1995. Defending national champion Michigan (2-2), a 23-17
winner over Michigan State, returned to the Top 25 after dropping
out with season-opening losses to Notre Dame and Syracuse.
	   Air Force, a 35-34 loser to Texas Christian, and Alabama, a 42-6
loser to Arkansas, fell out of the rankings.

	   ABUJA, Nigeria (AP) _ U.S. Assistant Defense Secretary Franklin
Kramer arrived in Nigeria's capital Sunday for a visit aimed at
expanding ties with the ruling military, which has promised to hand
over power to elected civilians next year.
	   Kramer, who was accompanied by about eight other U.S. officials,
told journalists soon after arriving at the international airport
in Abuja that Washington seeks to ``over time, build a new
military-to-military relationship with Nigeria.''
	   Kramer is the first ranking U.S. official to visit this oil-rich
West African country since Undersecretary of State Thomas Pickering
came in early August.
	   U.S. officials said on condition of anonymity that Kramer's
visit was part of Washington's plan to offer training and other
assistance to Nigeria's military as a ``carrot'' in return for
allowing further democratic reforms.
	   Nigerian military ruler Gen. Abdulsalami Abubakar has released
dozens of political prisoners and pledged to allow democratic
elections in February and a handover of power by the end of May.
	   The military has ruled Nigeria, Africa's most populous country,
for all but 10 years since independence from Britain in 1960.
	   ``The Nigerian military will play a key role in the transition
and this will be true up to the installation of the new government
and thereafter. But the key is to complete the transition to
civilian government,'' Kramer said.
	   ``As you know, the President of the United States and Gen.
Abubakar have had extensive and very fruitful discussions on the
transition to democracy and I'm here to continue with those
discussions,'' he said.
	   Kramer is expected to meet Abubakar and other top military
officials before he returns home on Tuesday.
	   He praised Nigerians for setting forth on an ``encouraging
vision for a new Nigeria ... based on the principles of democratic
participation and a military that serves the people rather than
controls the people.''
	   Pickering's visit, just a month after Abubakar came to power
following the death of the late dictator Gen. Sani Abacha, was
marred by the demise of Nigeria's most prominent political
prisoner, Moshood Abiola, who fell ill during a meeting with
Pickering and other U.S. officials.
	   Abiola's death sparked days of rioting, and wild accusations the
U.S. and Nigerian government of involvement. A subsequent autopsy
determined that Abiola died of natural causes linked to a weakened
heart.
	   Abiola was the apparent winner of the 1993 presidential
elections that were canceled by the military. He was jailed the
following year and accused of treason by Abacha, whose death in
June was also ascribed to heart failure.

	   NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) _ Italy's Andrea Navarra and his co-driver
Alexandra Materazzetti drove brilliantly Sunday in a Subaru
Imprezza to win the three-day Cyprus Motor Rally after lagging in
18th place on the first day.
	   It was the first time in 22 years that a woman co-driver mounted
the victor's ramp in a European championship event.
	   The 400 points picked up by winning the coefficient 20 event,
one of the officially listed 10 toughest in Europe, puts Navarra at
the head of the European Championship with 1,110 points, with only
one more event to go.
	   Navarra clocked a total of 4 hours, 56 minutes and 16 seconds.
He won 12 of the 18 special stages of the 888-kilometer (551-mile)
event run mainly over gravel-surfaced, twisting mountain roads.
	   Starting first off the ramp on Friday evening he dropped to 18th
place during the night after hitting a telegraph pole in one of the
special stages. He made up for his mishap Saturday and Sunday on
the remaining two sections.
	   Emil Triner and co-driver Emil Huska of the Czech Republic
driving a Skoda Octavia finished second, 7 minutes and 35 seconds
behind Navarra. The Cypriot team of Andreas Peratikos and co-driver
Haris Episkopou driving a Mitsubishi Lancer Evo III came third 10
minutes and 39 seconds behind the victor.
	   The next seven places were filled by Cypriot drivers. Only 24
cars of the 63 that started finished the event.

Report: 50 die in boat mishap while fleeing violence
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   LAGOS, Nigeria (AP) _ About 50 women and children trying to flee
ethnic fighting in a village in southwestern Nigeria drowned when
their boat capsized in high seas, a local newspaper reported
Sunday.
	   The mishap occurred as the victims were trying to escape
Thursday from the village of Apata in the oil-rich southwestern
Ondo state about 200 miles (350 kilometers) east of Lagos, the
Sunday Concord said.
	   It was unclear whether there were any survivors. Several other
boats had also fled the area and arrived safely in other seaside
towns.
	   Fighting between members of the Ilajes, a sub-ethnic group of
the southern Nigerian Yoruba tribe, and rival Ijaws, had claimed at
least 23 lives including the village chief in recent weeks, the
paper said.
	   The combatants had blocked several lagoons in the area, forcing
the refugees to ply the open ocean waters and preventing police
intervention in the hostilities. It was not clear what had sparked
the dispute.

Nelson wins Boone Valley seniors
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   AUGUSTA, Missouri (AP) _ Larry Nelson won the Boone Valley
Senior Golf Classic by two strokes Sunday, withstanding a charge in
which Graham Marsh eagled two of the last five holes.
	   Nelson, beset by back problems this year, closed with a
7-under-par 65 and won for the third time this year, his first full
season on the tour.
	   Marsh's eagle binge pulled him within one shot of Nelson after
53 holes. But Marsh drove into the bunker and bogeyed No. 18 while
Nelson drove the middle of the fairway to set up a finishing par
and a closing total of 16-under 200.
	   Marsh started the final round of the dlrs 1.3 million tournament
with a one-shot lead over Nelson.
	   Nelson earned dlrs 195,000 _ the largest prize of his career _
to raise his season winnings to dlrs 1.36 million, third on the
money list.
	   Marsh and Nelson, playing together, were tied at 12-under
through six holes when Nelson bogied the par-4 No. 7 to fall one
shot behind Marsh.
	   Nelson birdied the first two holes on the back nine to move
ahead of Marsh and opened a two-shot lead with a birdie at the
par-4 No. 13.
	   Marsh eagled the 476-yard (435-meter) No. 14 while Nelson
birdied the hole, to move within one shot of the lead. Nelson
regained his two-shot lead when Marsh bogeyed No. 15.
	   Marsh has not won since the Senior Open last year and had not
finished higher than fourth this year.
	   Marsh started the final round at 10-under on the 6,731-yard
(6,153-meter) course after shooting 67s in the first two rounds.
	   Nelson was 9-under at the start of the final round and birdied
two of the first three holes to catch Marsh, who birdied the first
hole.
	   Walter Hall finished at 207 for third place. Irwin, the
defending champion finished at 213.
	   Nelson made his debut on the Senior Tour last year at Boone
Valley Country Club, about 50 miles (80 kilometers) west of St.
Louis.

Hurricane relief supplies, U.S. delegation arrive in Dominican

<TEXT>
	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ The U.S. hurricane
relief effort for the Dominican Republic gained steam Sunday,
including tons of bottled water and plastic tarps for thousands of
struggling storm victims.
	   The United States shipped about dlrs 500,000 worth of supplies,
including enough plastic sheeting to roof 15,000 homes. More was
coming, said Hugh Parmer, head of disaster relief for the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
	   At least six U.S. military helicopters were due Monday to carry
relief supplies and help rescuers reach towns cut off by flooding,
downed bridges and debris-choked roads, Parmer said.
	   Chopper crews planned to fly rescuers to San Juan de Maguana,
120 miles (192 kilometers) west of the capital, where 76 bodies
were recovered Thursday. Half the town, Parmer said, was underwater
or buried in mud.
	   ``These people aren't getting much of anything as of now,'' he
said.
	   More than 200 people were killed and 100,000 left homeless when
Hurricane Georges struck the Dominican Republic on Tuesday. Most
victims died in flooding or mudslides; substandard homes proved no
match for the hurricane's destructive power and the rivers it
flooded.
	   The U.S. Peace Corps loaded private aircraft Sunday with food to
be flown and dropped to isolated villages. New York City sent
search and rescue teams, and Puerto Rico, itself recovering from
the hurricane, sent search dogs.
	   A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 cargo plane was set to deliver relief
supplies collected by Puerto Rico's Catholic Church to the
southwestern Dominican city of Barahona on Monday.
	   More private aid arrived. At Santo Domingo's military airport,
soldiers used forklifts to unload boxes of flashlights, pinto
beans, diapers, graham crackers and chain saws _ all donated by
Houston-based Enron Corp., an investor in the Dominican electrical
power industry.
	   Central Romana Sugar Co., owned by the Florida-based Fanjul
family, said it was opening field kitchens in the western province
of La Romana, where its sugarcane fields are located.
	   In Santo Domingo, a group of U.S. legislators inspected storm
damage and were visiting a shelter Sunday. ``It's the saddest thing
I've ever seen in my life,'' said Representative Bill Redmond, a
New Mexico Republican.
	   Other delegates included California Republican Elton Gallagly,
New Jersey Democrat Robert Menendez and Florida Republican Michael
Bilirakus.
	   Roman Catholic Cardinal Nicolas de Jesus Lopez Rodriguez added
his voice to criticism of officials who opened shelters in Santo
Domingo only after the storm hit.
	   ``It would have been preferable to bring people to shelters
beforehand, so they could be protected and promptly given
assistance,'' Lopez Rodriguez was quoted as saying in the Listin
Diario newspaper.
	   The government defended its performance.
	   ``This is a natural phenomenon, and unfortunately every time
these things happen, some people want to look for a guilty party,''
said armed services chief Adm. Ruben Paulino Alvarez.

<TEXT>
	   DETROIT (AP) _ Petr Klima, who started his career with Detroit
and was trying to make a comeback with the Red Wings, was cut
Sunday.
	   But the Red Wings offered him the chance to continue his tryout
with Adirondack of the American Hockey League. The Red Wings said
they did not know whether he would accept the offer.
	   Klima, 33, is a free agent and has not signed a contract with
Detroit.
	   Klima played for the Red Wings from 1985 until he was traded to
Edmonton early in the 1989-90 season, scoring 129 goals with 93
assists. He also played for Tampa Bay, Los Angeles and Pittsburgh,
totaling 312 goals and 260 assists in 12 NHL seasons.
	   In his last NHL season in 1996-96, he played with the Kings,
Penguins and Oilers and had two goals and 12 assists in 33 games.
He played last season in Germany, with seven goals and 12 assists
in 38 games.

	   FORT LAUDERDALE, Florida (AP) _ Frank Yallop's first Major
League Soccer goal was the game-winner Sunday as the Tampa Bay
Mutiny beat the Miami Fusion 3-1 in the regular season finale for
both teams.
	   Yallop scored on a shot from 18 yards in the 54th minute after
taking a pass from Alan Prampin. The goal came in Yallop's 88th
league game, breaking a 7,520-minute scoreless drought.
	   Tampa Bay ended the season 12-20 with 34 points to finish fifth
in the Eastern Conference. The Mutiny, which also got goals from
Paul Dougherty and Mauricio Ramos, failed to make the playoffs for
the first time in three seasons.
	   Miami, which clinched a playoff berth a week ago, dropped to
15-17 with 35 points, finishing fourth.
	   Fusion coach Ivo Wortmann rested six starters, including leading
scorer Diego Serna and goalkeeper Jeff Cassar.
	   On Wednesday, Miami begins a best-of-3 playoff series at
two-time MLS champion D.C. United.
	   The Fusion took a 1-0 lead on Paulinho McLaren's goal in the
19th minute. The Mutiny tied it in the 32nd minute when Dougherty
beat goalkeeper Scott Budnick, after a give-and-go with midfielder
Dominic Kinnear. Yallop's goal gave Tampa Bay 2-1 lead.
	   Ramos scored the final goal with four minutes left.

Israeli-Arabs clash with police in land dispute, 65 hurt
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with protest over, deal; corrects number of injured in
overline. PICKS UP 10th graf pvs: ``I was beaten ... &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   JERUSALEM (AP) _ In violent clashes reminiscent of the six-year
Palestinian uprising, Israeli troops fought Sunday with residents
of an Israeli-Arab town in a rioting over a land dispute, injuring
at least 50 residents and 15 police officers.
	   Israeli police chief Alik Ron told reporters his forces had
difficulty trying to end rioting near the predominantly Arab town
of Umm al-Fahm, 30 kilometers (20 miles) southeast of the port city
of Haifa. The riots began early Sunday in the heart of northern
Israel.
	   Angry Arab demonstrators shouting ``Death to the Jews,'' and
``Throw them into the Sea,'' hurled firebombs and rocks at police
who responded with tear gas and rubber bullets.
	   As night fell, residents burned tires at the town's main access
roads. Large forces of Israeli troops wielding automatic weapons
and batons beat back demonstrators, including Mayor Raed Mahajna.
Israel's Magen David ambulance service said one of the injured was
taken to hospital in serious condition.
	   The fighting erupted as Israeli police moved in to tear down a
tent erected by protesters who claimed land was unfairly
confiscated from the town.
	   Israeli authorities say the disputed area, near the northern
edge of the West Bank, is an Israeli army firing range. They say an
agreement was reached with the residents to nationalize about 125
acres (50 hectares) of land, in exchange for about six times as
much land elsewhere.
	   Several hours into the fighting, Israel police brought in
Israeli-Arab and Jewish legislators to help resolve the conflict.
After 10 hours of clashes, a deal was struck between the army and
the town in which the land would remain in the hands of the
residents until December. Officials from both sides would try to
reach a compromise over the next four months.
	   Israel's army radio said the army had cleared the access roads
and most protesters went home. But the day's fighting had left
several badly hurt, including the mayor.

Starless U.S. team stumped
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ARNIE STAPLETON &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   MILWAUKEE (AP) _ The Americans felt like outsiders in their own
back yard.
	   Playing without Pete Sampras, Andre Agassi, Michael Chang and
Jim Courier, the starless but still favored U.S. team had to make
do with two 21-year-old Davis Cup rookies and Todd Martin, who
played like one.
	   The Americans didn't even get the fast court they were counting
on as they lost 4-1 to the Italians, who dropped just three matches
all weekend before Jan-Michael Gambill salvaged a victory over
Davide Sanguinetti (4-6, 6-3, 6-3) in the second dead rubber match
Sunday.
	   The hard surface inside the Milwaukee Arena was chosen by the
Americans because it was supposed to favor their fast games.
	   But it played more like the clay courts the Italians grew up on.
	   ``It's a perfect court for them,'' said Justin Gimelstob, who
lost to Italy's Gianluca Pozzi on Sunday.
	   ``I'm hitting the ball pretty hard and there is just no way it
should keep coming back like that. It's just a shame that their
strengths match up on the court.''
	   Another thing that aided the Italians, who will face Sweden in
the final Dec. 4-6, was the makeup of the U.S. team.
	   Agassi, Sampras and Chang all decided against coming to
Milwaukee, and Courier was withheld by team captain Tom Gullikson
because of an arm injury.
	   That left Gambill and Gimelstob to make their Davis Cup debuts,
and Martin, who was dumped in both singles and doubles.
	   ``Even if we didn't beat the best USA team, for us it is still a
very good result,'' said dual winner Andrea Gaudenzi. ``We know
that the USA with Sampras and Agassi is a different story. But ...
it is not our fault if they didn't come.''
	   Snapped was the Americans' homecourt winning streak of 18
matches, dating to the 1987 Davis Cup, when Boris Becker led West
Germany to a 3-2 victory.
	   The Italians swept both singles matches Friday and the doubles
tie on Saturday, clinching the first home final match for Italy in
its 69-year tournament history.
	   ``Certainly to lose at home is very disappointing,'' Gullikson
said. ``I think this team had a great chemistry. All the guys got
along very well, worked very hard during the week to prepare.
Everybody was practicing well and we all felt very confident.''
	   Martin couldn't put his finger on what went wrong, either.
	   ``I think all of us felt great during the week,'' he said. ``We
were all practicing very well and unfortunately our practice didn't
translate into play as well as we had hoped _ and I also think we
ran into a very good Italian team.''
	   The crowds were sparse in the first Davis Cup match held in
Milwaukee, not exactly a tennis hotbed.
	   Agassi was upset by the choice of Milwaukee as the semifinal
site and said he wouldn't play in the final if the United States
advanced, declaring ``If it was in my back yard, I wouldn't walk
out the back door.''
	   He won't be the only American staying home now.

Germany's new challenger: from humble childhood to media star
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; AP Photo &QL; 
 &UR; By COLLEEN BARRY &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ His ambition is part of his political
mythology. The story goes: Gerhard Schroeder was a young member of
parliament in the late 1980s when, after a late night of drinking,
he tugged on the chancellery fence and shouted, ``I want to get in
there.''
	   On Sunday, the ambition was realized.
	   Schroeder is the first of his generation to take over leadership
of Europe's largest country _ a generation that came of age during
the left-wing student movement of the 1970s.
	   His bright smile, his snappy soundbites and his fashionable
young wife all feed Schroeder's image as a force for change after
16 years of conservative rule under Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
	   Kohl helped the nation complete much of its recovery from World
War II. He reunified East and West Germany and led the nation into
the center of European politics.
	   Schroeder, 54, inherits a country that has done much of the
healing from a destructive past. He and his contemporaries, instead
of dwelling on history, focus on solving today's problems as a way
to move Germany into the 21st century.
	   Born at the end of the war, Schroeder and his peers learned to
challenge authority by first questioning their parents' roles in
Nazi Germany. As a young lawyer, Schroeder was a self-declared
Marxist who even defended a terrorist suspect in court.
Collar-length hair spilled onto his turtleneck in the fashion of
the day.
	   But much like U.S. President Bill Clinton, Schroeder learned to
widen his voter appeal by making himself over as a moderate.
	   He wears natty suits and squeezes in a game of tennis when he
can. He is equally at home smoking cigars with business pals _ he
sits on the supervisory board of automaker Volkswagen _ as he is
passionately pleading for a fairer society.
	   Despite three failed marriages, the son of a cleaning lady from
Germany's Protestant north is one of the nation's most popular
politicians. He hewed to the left on the campaign trail, drawing
credibility from his unprivileged childhood.
	   His stump speeches often referred to his mother, a widow who
raised him and his four siblings alone during the tough postwar
years. He never knew his father, who was killed a few days after
Schroeder's birth while fighting for Hitler's army in Romania.
	   He joined the Social Democrats at age 19, finished high school
while holding down jobs and became an attorney in the 1970s.
	   Critics labeled Schroeder an opportunist and a populist who
would do anything to get into power. He says he's just open to
ideas, and tends to look toward experts outside politics to solve
Germany's problems.
	   His proposed Cabinet includes an outspoken computer entrepreneur
as economics minister and a New York-based German publisher as
culture minister. And his ideas for solving unemployment involve
gathering unions, business, government and perhaps the powerful
Lutheran and Roman Catholic churches into a forum on creating jobs.

Grenade explodes outside Haitian legislature building 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   PORT-AU-PRINCE, Haiti (AP) _ A hand grenade exploded in the
parking lot of the Haitian legislature Saturday night, damaging
some vehicles but causing no injuries, the head of the body's lower
house said Sunday.
	   The explosion occurred around midnight, and there was no damage
to the building, said chamber of deputies president Vasco
Thernelan.
	   ``The political situation is tense, but it doesn't seem the
terrorists were really determined to wreak havoc,'' he said.
	   Haiti has been without fully effective government since June
1997, when then-Premier Rosny Smarth resigned to protest elections
he alleges were rigged in favor of the political party of former
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
	   The deadlock caused by Smarth's majority party and Aristide's
parliamentary allies has prevented the installation of a new
government since then.

Japan Leasing goes bust, major newspapers report
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; URGENT &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan Leasing Corp., one of three non-bank
affiliates of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, has
applied for court protection in what would be one of the largest
bankruptcies in Japan since World War II, reports said Monday.
	   Japan Leasing is estimated to have liabilities exceeding 2
trillion yen, the Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported, which would make
its bankruptcy one of the largest in Japan since World War II.
	   Company officials were not immediately available for comment.
	   Japan's government has been wrangling for months over how to
deal with the LTCB, which is also on the verge of collapse. With
the LTCB in political limbo, reconstruction of the debt-ridden
Japan Leasing was impossible, observers said.
	   The collapse of Japan Leasing was also likely to affect
reconstruction plans for two other LTCB nonbanks _ Japan Landic
Corp. and Nippon Enterprise Development Corp.

McGwire ends record-smashing season with Nos. 69 and 70

 &UR; Eds: RECASTS and UPDATES with additional quotes; CORRECTS McGwire
postgame quote. Updates with Cubs final, Sosa homerless. &QL; 
 &UR; By R.B. FALLSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ An incredible 70 homers! Even Mark McGwire
couldn't believe it.
	   ``I've never even thought about it, dreamed about it,'' he said.
``It's absolutely amazing! It blows me away!''
	   The St. Louis Cardinals' slugger ended his record-smashing
season as mightily as he started it. He hit his 69th and 70th
homers on the season's last day, a fitting finale for a year he
began with a grand slam on opening day.
	   ``This is a season I will never, ever forget, and I hope
everybody in baseball never forgets,'' McGwire told the cheering
crowd after the game.
	   Big Mac, who hit five homers on the final weekend, connected
against Montreal rookie Mike Thurman in the third inning Sunday,
then homered off Carl Pavano for No. 70 in the seventh. McGwire
moved four ahead of Sammy Sosa and ended nine _ nine! _ in front of
Roger Maris' old record.
	   Sosa went 2-5 with no homers as the Cubs lost to Houston, 4-3,
in 11 innings, but his season is not done. The Cubs will face San
Francisco at Wrigley Field on Monday night in a one-game playoff
for the wild-card spot _ a game in which Sosa's stats will count.
	   ``I wish him the best of luck, along with the Giants,'' McGwire
said.
	   McGwire, who has 10 multihomer games this year and 53 in his
career, left many in awe.
	   ``It's stranger than fiction, what this man has done,'' manager
Tony La Russa said.
	   Expos manager Felipe Alou told his young pitchers to challenge
McGwire.
	   ``I left it up to God and the kid on the mound,'' Alou said. ``I
didn't want to tamper with history.
	   ``Thank God the season's over, or he would hit 80.''
	   McGwire hit a 1-1 fastball 377 feet (115 meters) into the
left-field seats for No. 69. After stomping on home plate, he took
a few slow steps, then made several salutes to the sellout crowd.
The fans who had stood well before his at-bat demanded and got two
curtain calls.
	   Kerry Woodson, a 22-year-old body-shop worker from Maryland
Heights, Missouri, wound up with the ball and said he didn't know
what he would do with it.
	   ``I reached up, closed my eyes, and it landed in my glove,''
Woodson said. ``It's a dream come true. I hope he doesn't hit any
more today.''
	   He didn't get his wish.
	   With two on and two outs in the seventh and the score 3-all, he
connected off Pavano (6-9), lining a first-pitch fastball 370 feet
(113 meters) over the left-field wall at 3:19 p.m., sending the
Cardinals on to a 6-3 win over the Expos.
	   ``Every time the replay is show, I'm not going to turn the TV
off,'' Pavano said. ``I hope he hits 75 next year so people will
forget I gave up No. 70.
	   ``C'mon Mark, I'm rooting for you.''
	   This time, even a curtain call from McGwire didn't quiet the
46,110 fans, who remained on their feet, cheering even as Brian
Jordan took a called third strike for the third out of the inning.
	   McGwire said No. 70 felt almost like No. 62, the homer that
broke Maris' record, with the crowd at fever pitch and Expos
infielders shaking his hand as he rounded the bases.
	   ``What can I say?'' McGwire said. ``I'm speechless.''
	   The second home run ball landed in a party box and was snared by
Phil Ozersky, 26, of Olivette, Missouri, attending the game with a
group of Washington University research lab scientists. He said he
didn't know what he'd do with the ball, which is worth a lot of
money on the collectibles market.
	   McGwire opened the year with a slam on March 31 against the
Dodgers' Ramon Martinez, then led the home run race all season
except when Sosa twice passed him briefly _ and then for only 103
minutes in all.
	   Sosa led for 58 minutes on Aug. 19 before McGwire regained went
back ahead with his 48th and 49th homers in the same game at
Chicago. Sosa led for 45 minutes on Friday when he hit his 66th
before McGwire answered.
	   Before connecting Friday, McGwire had been homerless in 14
at-bats.

Davide Sanguinetti (4-6, 6-3, 6-3) in the second dead rubber match
Sunday.

Americans because it was supposed to favor their fast games.

Six men arrested over Omagh bombing released
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) _ Six men being questioned by
Northern Ireland police about the Aug. 15 bombing that killed 29
and wounded more than 330 in the town of Omagh were released Sunday
night without charge.
	   The men were detained last Monday in early morning raids on
addresses across the region.
	   Since the blast committed by Irish Republican Army dissidents in
the religiously mixed town 70 miles (110 kms) west of Belfast,
several other suspected IRA dissidents have been arrested, but all
have been released without charge. The bombing was the deadliest
attack in the 30-year history of the Northern Ireland conflict.
	   The IRA dissidents who planted the bomb called a ``complete
cessation'' of violence three weeks ago. That put them in line with
the mainstream IRA, which in July 1997 formally halted its campaign
to destabilize British-ruled Northern Ireland.
	   In response to the Omagh attack, the British and Irish
governments passed emergency anti-terrorist legislation designed to
allow police and courts to imprison IRA dissidents more easily.
	   But so far the extra powers _ including restrictions on the
right to silence and giving police claims greater weight as
evidence _ have not been used to press charges against any
suspects.
	   Under existing British anti-terrorist law the Northern Ireland
suspects can be held without charge for up to one week. Under the
strengthened Irish laws, the three suspects can be held without
charge for up to four days.

Top electoral official sparks row in Brazil by backing President
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil (AP) _ Brazil's opposition party demanded
the dismissal of a top electoral regulator Sunday, a week days
before national elections, after he apparently voiced support for
President Fernando Henrique Cardoso.
	   The party said Ilmar Galvao should not oversee upcoming
elections after the daily Folha De Sao Paulo quoted him as saying
Cardoso's re-election was ``essential to maintain and consolidate
the economic pattern established in Brazil.''
	   Left wing presidential candidate Luiz Inacio `Lula' da Silva's
party issued a statement, calling for Galvao's dismissal as
president of the Supreme Electoral Tribunal, which regulates
Brazil's electoral process, unless he retracted the comments.
	   Otherwise, it said the elections would be ``illegitimate''.
	   Galvao moved to try and quell the controversy Sunday, telling
radio station CBN that his comments were ``trumped up'' by the
daily and were made as a citizen, not an electoral official.
	   Next Sunday, Brazilians vote for a president, 27 governors, 513
federal deputies, one-third of the 81 Senate and 1,045 state
legislators.
	   Center-left president Cardoso is seen as a capable handler of
Brazil's economy, under threat because of the world financial
crisis.
	   Main rival Silva, who has no proven track record, is likely to
adjust his free market policies if elected.
	   Cardoso has a clear 21 point lead, according to opinion polls
out Sunday.
	   The Supreme Electoral Tribunal is part of Brazil's Justice
System and regulates all aspects of elections, including probing
irregularities and regulating voting.

LTCB affiliate Japan Leasing goes bust
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with confirmation by company spokesman; ADDS dollar
conversion &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan Leasing Corp., one of three non-bank
affiliates of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, said
Monday it has applied for court protection in what would be one of
the largest bankruptcies in Japan since World War II.
	   Japan Leasing is estimated to have liabilities exceeding 2.2
trillion yen (dlrs 16.41 billion), the Nihon Keizai Shimbun
reported, which would make its bankruptcy one of the largest in
Japan since World War II.
	   Koji Suzuki, a spokesman for Tokyo-based Japan Leasing, said the
company filed for court protection from creditors with the Tokyo
District Court on Sunday night.
	   Suzuki refused to discuss other details, saying the company was
to hold a news conference later Monday.
	   Japan's government has been wrangling for months over how to
deal with the LTCB, which is also on the verge of collapse under
the weight of failed real estate loans made during the late 1980s.
	   With the LTCB in political limbo, reconstruction of the
debt-ridden Japan Leasing was impossible, observers said.
	   The collapse of Japan Leasing was also likely to affect
reconstruction plans for two other LTCB nonbanks _ Japan Landic
Corp. and Nippon Enterprise Development Corp.
	   Japan Leasing's failure was the largest in terms of debts in
Japan, exceeding the previous record debt by Crown Leasing, a
non-bank, which went under in April, 1997, the Nihon Keizai said.

 &UR; Report: Sharon slated to become Israel's foreign minister &QL; 
 &UR; By DAFNA LINZER &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TEL AVIV, Israel (AP) _ Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is
planning to appoint Ariel Sharon, the hawkish ex-general in his
cabinet, to foreign minister responsible for reaching a final peace
settlement with the Palestinians, Israel TV reporter Sunday.
	   The appointment would signal a toughening of Israel's positions
and could further strain relations with the Palestinians.
	   Sharon's office would neither confirm or deny the report.
Netanyahu's aide David Bar-Illan told Israel radio that Netanyhau
was considering the appointment and Sharon's name was on a list of
candidates for the number two slot in government.
	   Netanyahu has been acting foreign minister since the spot was
vacated in January by David Levy, a relative moderate who resigned
over Netanyahu's peace policies.
	   Sharon is considered to be the strong arm of the far right-wing
camp in Netanyahu's coalition government which seeks to retain as
much war-captured land as possible and opposes full Palestinian
statehood.
	   Sharon had lobbied hard against a U.S. initiative, even
threatening at one point to topple Netanyahu if he accepts the plan
to withdraw Israeli forces from 13 percent of West Bank land,
saying that anything more than nine percent would leave Israel's
defenses vulnerable.
	   An appointment to foreign minister would prevent Sharon, who is
now minister of infrastructure, from leading a revolt against
Netanyahu, and would likely be seen as an attempt by the premier to
hold his fragile coalition together after accepting the American
plan.
	   Sharon is known among the Palestinians as the hawkish general
who led Israel's invasion of Lebanon and a former housing minister
who helped strengthen Jewish settlement on land Israel captured
from Jordan, Egypt and Syria in the 1967 Mideast war.
	   In New York Sunday, where Netanyahu has been meeting with U.S.
Secretary of State Madeleine Albright to work out the terms of the
plan, Israeli diplomats, who spoke on condition of anonymity said
that Israel was ready to accept the initiative in exchange for
tougher Palestinian commitments on security issues.
	   In Jerusalem, Sharon's aide Raanan Gissin said that Sharon would
vote against the plan if it was brought before the cabinet for a
vote but hinted that leaving the government was less likely a
possibility.
	   Several of Netanyahu's coalition partners and the leader of the
influential Jewish settler lobby said they would try and prevent
the land deal from going through.
	   ``Our party is against this. We spoke and told him in writing
not to go ahead with this. I know that (Netanyahu) is under
pressure but he has pressure also from his voters and he owes them
more than he owes the Americans,'' said Avner Shaki, a member of
the National Religious Party which holds enough seats in
Netanyahu's coalition to bring down the government.
	   ``If the prime minister goes through with it, i think in a few
months there won't be a government and there will be new
elections,''said Ahron Dombe, the head of the settler lobby, adding
that he was sending a delegation to the United States to try and
convince Netanyahu to back out of the American ideas.

Sutton wins Texas Open after Leonard blows lead

<TEXT>
	   SAN ANTONIO (AP) _ Hal Sutton won a three-way battle on the back
nine of the Texas Open on Sunday for his first PGA Tour victory
since 1995 after Justin Leonard lost the lead by bogeying the final
two holes.
	   Sutton, who led by one stroke entering the final round, had six
birdies and two bogeys in a 4-under-par 68. He held on to par the
final two holes and finish with an 18-under 270 total, one stroke
ahead of Leonard, who crumbled, and Jay Haas, who couldn't make a
birdie.
	   Leonard and Haas each shot a 68.
	   The victory was Sutton's first since the B.C. Open in 1995 and
his ninth on the PGA Tour. He won dlrs 306,000, the largest check
of his career.
	   Finishing three strokes back at 273 were Mike Reid, who shot a
final-round 62, Steve Lowery, Loren Roberts and Andrew Magee. Scott
Gump, who was tied with Leonard one stroke back entering Sunday's
round, was another stroke back.
	   Leonard took a one-stroke lead over Sutton and a two-stroke lead
over Haas on the par-4 15th when he made a 10-foot (three-meter)
birdie putt. Sutton bogeyed the hole and Haas continued his streak
of pars. On No. 16, Leonard and Sutton both made birdies and
Leonard remained a stroke ahead at 19 under.
	   But everything changed on the 17th.
	   Leonard hit to the right of the green, then chipped the ball to
12 feet (3.7 meters). His putt came up short and he bogeyed.
	   He had problems again on 18 when he hit into a bunker then just
missed his 5-foot (1.5-meter) putt for par.
	   Sutton, knowing all he had to do was save par, missed a 10-foot
(three-meter) birdie putt on 18 but followed up by making a
2-footer (0.6 meters) for the championship.
	   Lowery had a 64 Sunday to join the group tied for fourth, while
Magee had a 66 and Roberts a 67.
	   Gump, who had a 71 Sunday, finished tied with Jeff Maggert, who
had a 66.

<TEXT>
	   SAN PEDRO DE MACORIS, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Christian
Vallenilla picked up a wooden stick, then smacked his third home
run of the day in the stadium where Sammy Sosa used to play.
	   ``This one's for Sammy,'' the 11-year-old boy said.
	   Hurricane Georges nearly destroyed the stadium in Sosa's
hometown of San Pedro de Macoris. Light towers twisted to the
ground and girders stretched skyward where a roof used to be. In
the bleachers, soiled laundry dried.
	   The outfield wall is gone, and Christian's house, half-flattened
by the hurricane, now has a direct view of home plate.
	   Still, the town that watched Sosa grow up somehow kept up as its
favorite slugger tried for the home-run record and a postseason
berth.
	   No matter that Sosa, the Chicago Cubs' slugger, failed to homer
in the Cubs' 4-3 loss to Houston Sunday, even as St. Louis slugger
Mark McGwire raised his home-run record to 70.
	   Sosa's hurricane-ravaged hometown of San Pedro de Macoris
celebrated his remarkable season, one that produced 66 home runs
and will last at least one more day.
	   ``We can't ask for any more, because he's done a lot already.
He's broken a lot of records,'' said Arizmendi Nunez, a 22-year-old
San Pedro bartender. ``I feel proud because now our flag is raised
high.''
	   Amid the misery of a place with no power, telephones or running
water, hundreds in this baseball-crazed city scrambled to find
places to hear Sosa's final regular-season game on radio.
	   It wasn't easy. The lone TV station broadcasting in the
Dominican Republic had a movie about a hurricane on, and without
batteries to power their radios, most San Pedro residents didn't
catch the game.
	   Men craned their necks into taxis stopped at street corners for
radio updates. Some crowded into sports betting parlors around the
city.
	   Four men listened to the game in a carpentry shop with no roof
and one wall blown away. ``We're in bad shape. We're in the street,
but we're celebrating today,'' said Lorenzo Mota, 34, an off-duty
police agent.
	   The only place in San Pedro where the game was televised was the
Flor y Mar bar, where a group of U.S. and other TV networks
covering fan reaction set up a live satellite feed.
	   Drinking plenty of Presidente beer, the crowd of 100 people
jumped up and down and chanted, ``Sammy! Sammy!'' every time Sosa
batted. They cheered when Sosa hit a fly ball, and groaned
collectively when it was caught.
	   ``He didn't do bad. He did magnificently well,'' said Pedro
Garcia, a 34-year-old accountant.
	   Sosa and the Cubs still have at least one more game, a Monday
night playoff with San Francisco to decide the National League
wild-card. The Giants lost to Colorado 9-8 minutes after the Astros
beat Chicago.

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan Leasing Corp., one of three non-bank
affiliates of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, said
Monday it has applied for court protection in Japan's largest
bankruptcy since the end of World War II.
	   Koji Suzuki, a spokesman for Japan Leasing, said the company
filed for court protection from creditors with the Tokyo District
Court on Sunday night.
	   Suzuki refused to discuss other details, saying the company was
to hold a news conference later Monday.
	   Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., a Tokyo-based credit research firm, said
Japan Leasing is estimated to have liabilities exceeding 2.44
trillion yen (dlrs 18.24 billion).
	   That made the bankruptcy Japan's largest corporate failure in
terms of debt since the end of the war, said Maiko Tanaka, a
Teikoku Databank spokeswoman.
	   It exceeded the previous record debt in a bankruptcy held by
Crown Leasing, a non-bank with debts of 1.18 trillion yen (dlrs
8.86 billion), which went under in April, 1997, she said.
	   Japan's government has been wrangling for months over how to
deal with the LTCB, which is also on the verge of collapse under
the weight of failed real estate loans made during the late 1980s.
	   With the LTCB in political limbo, reconstruction of the

	   LISBON, Portugal (AP) _ America's best known living composer
Philip Glass won local acclaim for his new opera ``The White
Raven'', which had its world premiere this weekend at the Lisbon
world's fair.
	   ``A tranquil piece with magnificent moments,'' was how the Daily
Diario de Noticias on Sunday described the work performed the
previous evening.
	   The opera, directed and designed by Glass' usual partner Robert
Wilson, was staged to mark the final days of the Expo '98 world
fair, due to close Sept. 30.
	   ``It's a historic piece. It's serious and very moving
sometimes,'' Glass said.
	   The opera is expected to be staged in Madrid, Spain, in
November.

	   NEW YORK (AP) _ More than a year after Jacques Cousteau's death,
the undersea explorer's widow and son reportedly are sniping at
each another over how to carry on his work.
	   ``I represent continuity of the name,'' Cousteau's 60-year-old
son, Jean-Michel, said in the latest issue of Time magazine. ``So I
must be a voice for the oceans.''
	   But Cousteau chose his widow, Francine Cousteau, to head the
Cousteau Society, which holds the rights to his films, books and
inventions.
	   She plans to build the 217-foot Calypso II to replace Cousteau's
beloved Calypso, which sank near Singapore in 1996. Cousteau had
begun work on the second boat before he died at 87 in June 1997.
	   Ms. Cousteau, 52, also hopes to send out a Caspian Sea
expedition and run a ``Waters of Peace'' program.
	   Jean-Michel Cousteau calls the Calypso II ``a joke,'' and says
``my father must be flip-flopping in his grave.''
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   PITTSBURGH (AP) _ The world's first female grandmaster in chess
said girls are still missing out on the game because they aren't
taught it.
	   Susan Polgar, 29, became a grandmaster in 1991 and once beat the
world's fifth-ranked player, Anatoly Karpov. She spoke Saturday to
the Pittsburgh Chess Club, which counts several nationally ranked
girls among its membership.
	   ``Even today in some countries, chess isn't something they teach
girls,'' Polgar said. ``It is improving, and once girls start to
play, they've shown they have the talent to compete with men.''
	   The reigning world women's champion, Polgar started playing
chess before she even started school in Hungary because she was
fascinated with the pieces.
	   Both of her younger sisters are in the top 20 of the world
rankings.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) _ If you're Chinese in Hollywood, Jackie
Chan says, the roles start looking real familiar.
	   ``There are few roles for Chinese unless they specially write a
script for us. Then its cop, cop, cop, killer, killer killer,'' the
Hong Kong action star said Saturday in Taipei, where he's promoting
his latest film ``Rush Hour.''
	   Chan's first Hollywood production in over a decade, ``Rush
Hour'' grossed $33 million in its opening week in the United
States.
	   He plays a policeman in the movie, and Hollywood debuts this
year by Chow Yun-fat and Jet Lee have cast them as hit men. All are
veterans of Hong Kong's gritty movie industry that puts a premium
on action and violence.
	   Chan, who was made an honorary officer by Taiwan's police force,
also said he would donate $29,000 worth of movie proceeds to a fund
for families of officers killed in duty.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   KEY WEST, Fla. (AP) _ Jimmy Buffett, whose name is practically
synonomous with Key West, is leaving.
	   The singer has sold his home and moved to Palm Beach, where he
says the schools are better for his three children.
	   The new owners are Steve Chapman and Tom duPont, who own upscale
magazines published in the Tampa Bay area.
	   ``The important thing is for us to just preserve it the way
Buffett left it,'' Chapman said.
	   ``Just think of the music that he may have written there.
Someday the estate will be similar to Ernest Hemingway's home,''
which is also in Key West, Chapman added.
	   Buffett isn't completely changing latitudes. He still has a
recording studio and store in Key West.
	   Buffett's home was listed for dlrs 1.5 million but Chapman and
duPont got it for dlrs 900,000. It had been on the market for three
months.
	    &UR; ___ &QC; 
	   NEW YORK (AP) _ India's prime minister helped shed some light on
Hinduism before returning home from an eventful week in New York.
	   Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee joined Kaushal K. Sinha, the
publisher of a planned English-language encyclopedia of Hinduism,
on Saturday when Sinha signed the publishing contract for the
encyclopedia.
	   Vajpayee and Sinha opened the meeting by lighting a lamp _ a
Hindu tradition.
	   The Encyclopedia of Hinduism will be published by the University
of South Carolina Press. Sinha signed the contract with the press'
director, Catherine Fry.
	   Vajpayee's Hindu nationalist government set off a political
storm earlier this year when it announced that it had conducted a
series of nuclear tests. Neighboring Pakistan, which is
predominantly Muslim, responded with its own nuclear tests.
	   This week at the opening of the U.N. General Assembly, Vajpayee
and his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, both expressed
willingness to negotiate an end to hostilities and sign on the
nuclear test ban treaty.

	   KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) _ Even a minor illness can be fatal in
today's Afghanistan.
	   Most humanitarian aid groups have pulled out of the beleaguered
capital of Kabul rather than heed an order from the ruling Taliban
religious army to move into abandoned university dormitories.
	   The few foreigners left behind by the International Red Cross
and the World Health Organization race around trying to help local
health workers keep dozens of clinics and 14 hospitals running with
few medical supplies.
	   After two decades of war, Afghanistan is an all too easy place
to get sick or wounded. Apart from causing injuries, artillery,
rocket and mortar fire have wrecked the city's water, sewage and
sanitation systems, inviting epidemics like the current cholera
outbreak in Kabul.
	   Dr. Mohammed Daim Kakar, a director for WHO, the United Nations
health agency, said medical supplies are critically needed by the
infectious diseases control center.
	   But even treating minor maladies is a daunting job in
overflowing civilian hospitals that often have to turn away the
sick.
	   ``We are short of everything _ medicines, equipment, doctors,''
said Dr. Maruf Aram, deputy head of the medical department at
Aliabad Hospital, once one of Kabul's finest.
	   Outside Aliabad, a teaching hospital that used to attract the
country's best doctors, patients in unwashed clothes carry their
own intravenous drips as they shuffle around the compound. A white
and red ambulance, though much needed, sits in the parking lot,
sagging on a flat tire, its headlights smashed.
	   Beneath the trees, patients lie on the grass and chat with
visiting kin. An old man, barely able to hold his head up, gets a
haircut from his son.
	   Not even the original Aliabad survives. Four years of warfare
between rival Islamic factions left the building in ruins, forcing
relocation to a shabby maternity hospital, where the steel beds are
barely covered with tattered sheets.
	   Most of the hospital's windows are broken, and the building's
last coat of paint is little more than a memory.
	   The hospital is so short of drugs that patients have to buy
their own at local markets. If they can't afford them, ``that's
their problem,'' Aram said.
	   Not even doctors have money, because few have seen their roughly
dlrs 10-a-month (33,000 afghanis) wage in four or five months.
	   ``We have no economy, but we do what we can,'' said Sher
Mohammed Stanikzai, deputy public health minister for the Taliban
government. ``We provide some essential medicines and equipment,
but there is very little money.''
	   The Red Cross says it cannot fill the gap left by the departure
of humanitarian groups.
	   Even before the aid groups pulled out, health care was a
sensitive issue because the Taliban ordered the segregation of male
and female patients and dismissed female health care workers.
	   Since seizing Kabul in 1996, Taliban militiamen have imposed a
restrictive brand of Islam that bans women from working and
prevents girls from going to school.
	   Out of necessity, Taliban leaders relented and allowed many
female nurses and doctors to return to work, but insisted they wear
all-enveloping robes and treat only women. Then the Taliban ordered
all women to work and be treated at one hospital _ the Rabia Balkhi
Hospital.
	   But while some hospitals remain off limits, except in
emergencies, WHO says beds are beginning to open up for female
patients at the two hospitals supplied by the Red Cross. According
to a WHO survey, there are 1,157 hospital and clinic beds available
for women and 1,531 beds for men.
	   At the women-only Rabia Balkhi Hospital, its director and the
only woman among the Taliban's hierarchy, Dr. Seliana Nabizada says
she is aware of Western criticism of the Taliban's treatment of
women.
	   She watched as the Taliban last year threw out European Union
Commissioner Emma Bonino, the trade bloc's top humanitarian aid
official, for taking pictures of female patients, a serious offense
under Taliban rules. After Bonino's visit, all foreign aid to Rabia
Balkhi was stopped, which Nabizada said hurt female patients
without fazing the Taliban leadership.
	   She said the Taliban needs to do more for the health and rights
of women. But she is clearly proud of her hospital.
	   ``It's a hospital for women, run by women,'' she said.
	   She took broken down equipment, such as an X-ray machine that
hadn't worked for eight years, and hovered over male technicians
until they fixed it. She badgered Taliban leaders into allowing
male specialists to treat women, and now has 40 male doctors at her
hospital.
	   ``I say to the Taliban leaders: `You have to accept our rights.
We have our rights,''' she said.
	   Unfortunately, substandard health care is one area of sexual
equality in Afghanistan.
	   ``In all hospitals in Afghanistan the condition is very bad, and
we are included in that also,'' she said.

Germans look to new leader to jolt them out of malaise
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; With BC-Germany-Election
 &UR; By TONY CZUCZKA &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder tapped into Germans'
yearning for change and ran with it to an election victory.
	   Now, he faces huge expectations to jolt Germany out of a malaise
marked by high unemployment, stagnating reforms and a rift between
the rich west and struggling ex-communist east.
	   It's not only his compatriots who will look to the 54-year-old
Social Democrat for leadership: Schroeder's victory Sunday further
fuels a resurgence of Europe's left that already includes
governments in Britain, neighboring France and Italy.
	   With his gleaming smile, easy charm and confidence, Schroeder
ran the slickest political campaign Germany has seen.
	   Schroeder ushers a new generation into power that is less
burdened by memories of World War II than Helmut Kohl, whose
16-year chancellorship now is itself history.
	   Kohl, 68, was a teen-ager when the war ended and his brother was
killed in action. Schroeder was barely one year old in 1945, and he
symbolizes a Germany that wants to be treated as a European nation
among many, not viewed through the prism of its Nazi past.
	   His first move will be to provide direction to his government.
	   He's won a strong mandate to lead the nation, but Germans
clearly didn't vote for radical change.
	   During his cautious campaign, Schroeder sold the nation on two
visions that don't always mesh: modernize an economy that is
struggling to stay competitive and, at the same time, uphold the
generous social welfare state.
	   That formula, applied by President Clinton as well as European
leaders of the left, has come to be known as the Third Way.
Schroeder called it ``the new center.''
	   With his reputation as a pragmatic pal of business, he purposely
kept his message broad to keep the Social Democrats'
traditional-left wing behind his candidacy.
	   Also, with a sweeping Social Democratic victory unlikely,
Schroeder had to keep his options open for potential governing
partners.
	   Sunday's result left open the possibility of a left-leaning
coalition of the Social Democrats with the environmentalist Greens,
which would be postwar Germany's most radical government.
	   Among the possible rubs between the sometimes pacifist Greens
and the mostly pragmatic Social Democrats are the Greens'
insistence on scrapping nuclear power, pulling out of NATO and
raising gasoline prices.
	   The slim majority of such a coalition and its split between
moderates and leftists of both parties could quickly destabilize a
Schroeder government _ if, for example, Germany is called to take
part in NATO strikes to end bloodshed in the Serbia's Kosovo
province.
	   Schroeder may seek the security of an alliance with Kohl's
defeated Christian Democrats. It could be a way to agree on
centrist reforms such as tax cuts, deregulating the economy and
reducing the social security burden on businesses _ measures that
Schroeder supports.
	   Whatever the shape of the new government, Schroeder has pledged
to remain committed to NATO and an ever more united Europe _ the
framework for postwar Germany's benign foreign policy.

Hetherington wins LPGA Betsy King Classic
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   KUTZTOWN, Pennsylvania (AP) _ Rachel Hetherington and two-time
defending champion Annika Sorenstam both closed their rounds with
four consecutive birdies, then Hetherington made another on the
first playoff hole to win the LPGA Betsy King Classic.
	   It was the first victory in the United States for the
26-year-old native of Australia, who led after the second and third
rounds.
	   ``It was really exciting,'' Hetherington, who won twice on the
European tour in 1995, said Sunday. ``I just tried to stay focused,
and really didn't think of winning and any other pressures. I have
to call home.
	   ``A couple of times, I glanced at (the leaderboard), and I knew
there were a few of us in double digits.''
	   Hetherington's closing 3-under-par 69 gave her a 14-under total,
the same as Sorenstam, who had a final-round 66.
	   Hetherington wasn't aware she needed a birdie to tie Sorenstam
until the last possible moment.
	   ``I really had no idea,'' said Hetherington, who made a 20-foot
(6-meter) birdie putt on the last hole of regulation. ``I just
wanted to play par golf or better on every hole, and I wasn't aware
until I was walking up to the green.''
	   Hetherington made a 2-foot (0.61-meter) birdie putt on the
playoff hole to earn the winner's purse of dlrs 97,500 and a Rolex
watch. Her previous best finish this season was an 11th at the
Safeco Classic earlier this month.
	   Sorenstam, who missed a 7-footer (2-meter) for birdie on the
playoff hole, had six birdies and a bogey in her 66, the day's
lowest round. It was her first loss in five career playoffs.
	   ``I was just happy to be in contention,'' Sorenstam said.
``Obviously I'm disappointed, but she showed a lot of composure and
was very impressive today.''
	   Hetherington nearly withdrew from the tournament to return to
Australia to care for her ill sister-in-law. But her passport was
held up by the Japanese government.
	   ``It's weird how things worked out,'' she said. ``I really
thought I was going home. But the timing was really good.''
	   Beth Daniel, who started the final round a stroke behind
Hetherington, had a 71 and finished third at 277.
	   Meg Mallon, Se Ri Pak, Hiromi Kobayashi and Laura Davies all
finished another two strokes back. Mallon had the most impressive
final round with a 68, while Kobayashi had a 70 and Pak and Davies
had 71s.
	   The field at Berkleigh Country Club dealt with sweltering
humidity Sunday and record temperatures more than 90 degrees (32
Celsius).
	   Betsy King, the host of the event, finished with a 71 and was at
285.

Seles rallies to beat Sanchez-Vicario
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By PHIL BROWN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ For Monica Seles, overcoming Arantxa
Sanchez-Vicario in a championship match has a familiar feel.
	   The quest to regain her former No. 1 ranking, however, is
``uncharted territory.''
	   ``No other player has had to stop halfway in their career,''
Seles said Sunday after beating Sanchez-Vicario for the Toyota
Princess Cup title for the third year in a row.
	   Sanchez-Vicario rallied from a 3-1 deficit to win the first set,
and threatened to rebound from 3-1 and 5-3 deficits in the third
before Seles won 4-6, 6-3, 6-4 in 2 hours, 17 minutes Sunday.
	   Fitness and consistency have been major concerns for Seles, who
held the top ranking most of the time from March 1991 until being
stabbed in the back by a spectator at a tournament in Germany in
April 1993.
	   She returned to the tour in 1995, but then spent more time away
because of injuries and, early this year, the illness and death of
her father. She now is ranked No. 6.
	   ``I have to practice and hit a lot of balls,'' she said. ``I
lost a lot of consistency.
	   ``To do well in the Grand Slams, I have to improve a lot of
things in the next few months.''
	   As for No. 1, ``I can get there'' with the proper amount of work
and sacrifice.
	   In Sunday's final, ``I felt I played some great tennis at key
times but I also at times let Arantxa back into the match,'' Seles
said.
	   Seles has won 17 of her 20 matches against Sanchez-Vicario, a
former No. 1 who currently is ranked No. 4. Ten of those meetings
have been tournament finals, and Seles has won eight of them,
although she lost to the Spaniard in this year's French Open final.
	   ``She's a fighter, she never gives up and she keeps improving,''
Seles added. ``I'm a fighter too, and it brings out the best in
both of us.''
	   Sanchez-Vicario was in her fifth consecutive Toyota final. She
won in 1994, but since has lost four in a row _ one to Mary Pierce
and three to Seles.
	   ``My serve was probably less effective than hers,'' said
Sanchez-Vicario, the top seed. ``She served better when she needed
to.''
	   In the final set, Seles saved two break points in the second
game _ which she closed out with two aces _ and two more in the
fourth.
	   At 30-all in the final game, Seles produced two good serves _
one drawing a miss from Sanchez-Vicario and the other setting up a
vicious forehand crosscourt winner for the 43rd singles title of
her career.
	   This one was worth dlrs 79,000.
	   They also met in Sunday's doubles final, with Seles and Russia's
Anna Kournikova beating Sanchez-Vicario and Mary Joe Fernandez 6-4,
6-4, and sharing the winner's prize of dlrs 23,750.
	   It was Kournikova's first victory in any event on the pro tour.
	   ``It feels great winning, especially with Monica,'' said
Kournikova, who was paired with Seles for the first time.

Swedish hero Bjorkman would have prefered Americans in final
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: RECAPS pvs &QL; 
 &UR; By STEPHAN NASSTROM &QC; 
 &UR; AP Sports Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) _ Nothing wrong with a trip to Italy. But
Jonas Bjorkman, the workhorse for defending champion Sweden, would
have preferred the United States in the Davis Cup final.
	   ``The Americans would have been a tougher opponent, especially
if they had their best players,'' Bjorkman said after leading the
Swedes to a 4-1 win Sunday over Spain in the semifinals. ``But it
would have been more fun to play the Americans. They would have
been hungry for revenge.''
	   Bjorkman helped Sweden to a 5-0 shutout against a U.S. team led
by Pete Sampras in last year's final at Goteborg, Sweden.
	   With top-ranked Sampras, Andre Agassi and Michael Chang skipping
the other semifinal, the United States was eliminated by Italy in
Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
	   If Italy, which will host the Dec. 4-6, picks clay as the
surface, Bjorkman may only play doubles.
	   ``I think they'll chose clay and that means it will be difficult
for me to get a singles spot,'' he said.
	   Clay is Bjorkman's weakest surface. Even though indoor clay
generally is faster than outdoor clay, Swedish captain Carl-Axel
Hageskog probably will rely on his three Magnuses _ Magnus
Gustafsson, Magnus Norman and Magnus Larsson _ for the singles
matches if the Italians pick the slow surface.
	   ``This win shows a lot about the Swedes and our team,'' Hageskog
said. ``This year we have used seven singles players and that's
fantastic.
	   ``It doesn't matter who we meet. The players are used to
changing surfaces and we'll deal with that when it comes.''
	   Hageskog has a team for every surface.
	   The Swedes faced Slovakia on indoor clay in the first round.
Gustafsson clinched the victory after the defending champions fell
behind 0-2 on opening day.
	   The quarterfinals in Germany was played on hardcourt and the
semis against Spain on a faster Taraflex court.
	   Bjorkman, who played both singles and doubles in the last two
ties, also won the 1994 final against Russia in Moscow.
	   ``Even though I've won the final twice, it's always nice to get
a third one,'' he said. ``I may be a litte bit more relaxed than
the first time in Russia. But when you go in to the court to play
you're still getting a little bit nervous and feel the atmosphere
of a final. So it's definitely something you want to win again.
	   Proving that rankings seldom mean anything in Davis Cup ties,
the 13th-ranked Bjorkman beat fifth-ranked Carlos Moya 6-3, 7-5
Sunday to complete his perfect Davis Cup weekend.
	   The Swede started with a four-sets win Friday over
seventh-ranked Alex Corretja and then clinched Sweden's 12th trip
to the final by winning Saturday's doubles with Nicklas Kulti in
straight sets.
	   Bjorkman, who hates to lose even ``dead'' matches, came from 1-4
in the last set to beat Moya and give the Swedes a 4-0 lead.
	   ``I have a good Davis Cup record and I'd rather improve it than
lose,'' Bjorkman said. ``All matches are important for me. It's
difficult for me to go on the court and not play one hundred
percent. I'm not that kind of person. For me it was as important to
win today.
	   Sweden has played 11 finals since its first victory at the Royal
Tennis Hall in 1975, when former great Bjorn Borg anchored the
team. With its six wins and five runners-up finishes, Sweden is the
most successful Davis Cup nation in the last two decades.
	   Julian Alonzo picked up the only point for Spain in the last
``dead'' singles match Sunday, winning 6-1, 7-6 (7-3) against Davis
Cup newcomer Thomas Johansson. Alonzo replaced Spanish
second-string Alex Corretja.

LTCB affiliate Japan Leasing goes bust in Japan's biggest corporate

bankruptcy
 &UR; Eds: RECAPs previous; UPDATES that bankruptcy is Japan's largest
ever; ADDS background &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan Leasing Corp., one of three non-bank
affiliates of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, said
Monday it has applied for court protection in Japan's largest ever
corporate bankruptcy.
	   Koji Suzuki, a spokesman for Japan Leasing, said the company
filed for court protection from creditors with the Tokyo District
Court on Sunday night.
	   Suzuki refused to discuss other details, saying the company was
to hold a news conference later Monday.
	   Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., a Tokyo-based credit research firm, said
Japan Leasing is estimated to have liabilities exceeding 2.44
trillion yen (dlrs 18.24 billion), said Tanaka, a Teikoku Databank
spokeswoman.
	   That made the filing Japan's largest corporate bankruptcy, said
Teikoku Databank spokeswoman Maiko Tanaka.
	   It exceeded the previous record debt in a bankruptcy held by
Crown Leasing, a non-bank with debts of 1.18 trillion yen (dlrs
8.86 billion), which went under in April, 1997, she said.
	   The figures cited by Teikoku do not take into account failures
which occurred without formal bankruptcy filings, such as the
collapse of Yamaichi Securities Co. _ Japan's largest corporate
failure ever.
	   Yamaichi, announced last in November it was throwing in the
towel, leaving debts of more than 3 trillion yen (dlrs 22.38
billion) and 8,000 people without work. It formally shut down
operations at the end of March.
	   Japan's government has been wrangling for months over how to
deal with the LTCB, which is also on the verge of collapse under
the weight of failed real estate loans made during the late 1980s.
	   With the LTCB in political limbo, reconstruction of the
debt-ridden Japan Leasing was impossible, observers said.
	   The collapse of Japan Leasing was also likely to affect
reconstruction plans for two other LTCB nonbanks _ Japan Landic
Corp. and Nippon Enterprise Development Corp.
	   Japan Leasing was established in 1963 as Japan's first leasing
firm.

Hakkinen holds off Schumacher, takes lead into final race
</HEADLINE>

 &UR; By NESHA STARCEVIC &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   NUERBURGRING, Germany (AP) _ The Formula One championship will
be decided in the last race of the season.
	   A second place in the Japanese Grand Prix on Nov. 1 in Suzuka
will give the title to Mika Hakkinen of Finland.
	   Hakkinen captured the penultimate race of the season Sunday,
beating Michael Schumacher out of the pit stops to win the
Luxembourg Grand Prix.
	   His seventh victory of the year gave Hakkinen 10 points for a
total of 90 and a four-point lead over Schumacher in the battle for
the championship.
	   Even if he finishes second to Schumacher in Suzuka, Hakkinen
will earn his first title on the strength of more second-place
finishes during the 16-race season. Under that scenario, he would
end with three such finishes to Schumacher's two.
	   ``Yes, indeed, this win is fantastic,'' said the Finn, who turns
30 Monday. ``It makes my situation a lot different than it was two
hours ago.''
	   Hakkinen and Schumacher had gone into the Luxembourg GP tied on
80 points.
	   ``It was great to win today, but nothing is over yet,'' said
Hakkinen, who now has eight career wins. ``The fight continues and
we have to have very good preparation for the final race.''
	   Schumacher had started from the pole, but was behind Ferrari
teammate Eddie Irvine into the first turn, with Hakkinen third in a
McLaren-Mercedes.
	   But Schumacher was in the lead before the first lap was over and
Hakkinen passed Irvine on lap 14. From then on it was a battle of
the only two contenders for the title, with Hakkinen chasing
Schumacher and clocking one fastest lap after another.
	   On lap 28, Hakkinen made his first pit stop and came out just
ahead of Schumacher, who had pitted three laps before.
	   Hakkinen pitted again on lap 48, one lap after Schumacher, and
again came out ahead of the German.
	   ``Our race strategy proved to be right and the team did a
fantastic job in the pit stops to get me out ahead of Michael on
both occasions,'' Hakkinen said.
	   Schumacher conceded that he had no chance once he ended up
behind Hakkinen following both pit stops.
	   ``After the first pit stop, we had no chance,'' Schumacher said.
``I was quite surprised that he came out ahead. I knew it would be
tight but I thought I could still be ahead.''
	   ``All in all I am surely a bit disappointed,'' said Schumacher,
who is chasing his third Formula One title and trying to become the
first Ferrari driver to become champion since Jody Scheckter in
1979.
	   ``But we are four points behind and it's still not lost,'' the
29-year-old German said.
	   Hakkinen finished the race distance of 305.235 kilometers
(189.667 miles) in one hour, 32 minutes, 14.789 seconds, beating
Schumacher by 2.2 seconds at the checkered flag.
	   Although the race is officially called the Luxembourg Grand
Prix, it is actually held across the border in Germany, an hour's
drive away from Schumacher's home town of Kerpen.
	   More than 140,000 people jammed to see the race on election day
in Germany that saw conservative Chancellor Helmut Kohl _
Schumacher's favorite _ lose the ballot.

Slovak opposition agrees to unite, confident of forming new

	   BRATISLAVA, Slovakia (AP) _ Opposition parties sealed an
apparent victory in Slovak national elections by declaring their
formal intent to unite, ensuring they have a majority to form the
new government.
	   But weeks of political friction and uncertainty are likely
following results that also would keep Prime Minister Vladimir
Meciar's hard-line ruling party as the single biggest party in
Parliament.
	   ``It's going to be a tough month,'' Milan Ftacnik, deputy
chairman of the opposition Party of the Democratic Left,
acknowledged Sunday after the release of unofficial results touched
off immediate dickering over the makeup of the new government.
	   Meciar, who has ruled Slovakia in strong-handed fashion for six
years, has remained conspicuously absent from view since voting
Friday at the start of two-day parliamentary elections. Barring a
stunning change in figures when the official vote count is release
Monday night or Tuesday, his likeliest options now are to serve as
minority leader in Parliament or resign.
	   But officials of his Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, or
HZDS, denied the 56-year-old premier would quit.
	   ``There's no reason for Meciar to leave politics,'' said Sergej
Kozlik, HZDS vice chairman. ``He will continue.''
	   ``Our goal is to have a majority in Parliament, but we will see
later if that comes true,'' he said.
	   The leaders of the top four opposition parties met Sunday and
reiterated their intent to form a governing coalition after results
indicated they won 93 of the 150 seats in Parliament. They said
more negotiations are needed to firm it up.
	   ``Slovakia has voted for change,'' said top opposition leader
Mikulas Dzurinda, head of the Slovak Democratic Coalition. ``The
opposition has won a constitutional majority.''
	   The coalition won 26 percent, good for 42 parliament seats,
according to the unofficial results. The other three opposition
parties _ the Party of the Democratic Left, the Hungarian Coalition
Party and the Party of Civic Understanding, reflecting a wide
variety of positions _ got another 32 percent to earn 51 seats.
	   The prospective new prime minister, Dzurinda, is a 43-year-old
economist and former transport specialist from eastern Slovakia.
Short and wiry, the mustachioed politician has risen to prominence
due in part to a plain-spoken style that appealed to voters.
	   On Sunday, he avoided specific plans for change and said it was
important for Slovakia that the new government be formed swiftly.
	   Finishing ahead of all 16 other parties will give Meciar the
first crack at forming a governing coalition. But the HZDS' sharp
decline in support since 1994 elections, coupled with that of its
current coalition partners, leaves it with slim hopes to form a
majority.
	   Ivan Gasparovic of the HZDS, the parliament speaker, said the
party would not try to lead a minority government.
	   Western vote monitors praised the 84 percent turnout and said
the balloting appeared to have been carried out correctly.
	   Officials in neighboring Hungary and the Czech Republic,
meanwhile, lauded the apparent mandate for change in diplomatically
isolated Slovakia.

Fighting persists despite NATO warnings

	   PRISTINA, Yugoslavia (AP) _ Despite a new warning that time is
running out to avoid NATO intervention, Serb forces have launched a
new offensive against ethnic Albanian rebels in southern Kosovo.
	   Serb and Albanian sources said the latest operation, which began
late Saturday, is aimed at secessionist Kosovo Liberation Army
guerrillas in an area about 50 kilometers (30 miles) southwest of
the provincial capital, Pristina.
	   It follows a strong Serb offensive against KLA rebels in central
Drenica region, which came as the U.N. Security Council demanded an
end to the Serb crackdown and NATO finalized plans for airstrikes
unless the fighting stops in the Serb province.
	   The alliance has finalized plans to hit strategic targets
throughout Serbia, the dominant republic of Yugoslavia.
	   In nearby Bosnia-Herzegovina, U.S. Defense Secretary William
Cohen repeated warnings Sunday that Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic has only ``a short period of time'' to comply with
international demands to end the conflict.
	   ``A failure to do so presents the possibility that a military
operation against Mr. Milosevic would be necessary,'' Cohen said.
``A failure to do so on his part will be met with very strong NATO
action in my judgment.''
	   Despite that warning, the Albanian-run Kosovo Information Center
said Serb forces were attacking from three directions near the
towns of Suva Reka, Urosevac and Stimlje, southwest of Pristina.
The attack focused on 11 villages, and three were on fire.
	   An estimated 15,000 civilians have begun leaving the area,
adding to the humanitarian crisis. Several hundred people have died
and about a quarter of a million people have been displaced since
the government launched a crackdown against ethnic Albanian
separatists in Kosovo in February.
	   The separatists suffered defeats in southern Kosovo earlier this
year.
	   Police sources said the rebels recently kidnapped two Serbs,
which prompted the new action.
	   The Serbian troops are by far stronger militarily than the
rebels but are stretched thin in Kosovo's rugged countryside. The
Serbs have had trouble maintaining control over the areas while
driving out rebels, mostly local farmers recruited by the KLA.
	   Ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs 9-1 in Kosovo.

	   ZALAMBESA, Eritrea (AP) _ Although braced for a new round of
fighting in the border conflict between neighboring Eritrea and
Ethiopia, residents in this battered border post are restoring
their shattered lives.
	   About half of the 20,000 residents _ Ethiopians as well as
Eritreans _ have returned to Zalambesa, 100 kilometers (60 miles)
south of the Eritrean capital, Asmara. Eritrean troops took the
town from Ethiopia in early June in fierce fighting that damaged
many businesses and homes.
	   A delegation headed by a former U.S. national security adviser,
Anthony Lake, was expected in the region this week in yet another
attempt to find peace.
	   For now, traders have begun opening shops and roadside stalls
again, and the Saturday market is thriving. Farmers on both sides
have been busy harvesting their crops during a three-month lull in
fighting.
	   Among those who have returned is Sara Binyam, who says business
is good at her main street grocery store. Eritrean soldiers are
among her best customers.
	   A year ago, goods and people moved freely across the border in
Zalambesa. However, in November, Eritrea introduced its own
currency, the nakfa, to replace the Ethiopian birr. Ethiopia
refused to permit free exchange of the two, and trade stagnated,
creating anger and economic hardship on both sides.
	   In May, Ethiopia evacuated all civilians from Zalambesa, and
soldiers started digging trenches in preparation for hostilities
that broke out May 12 at Badme, a border village far to the
northwest. Intense fighting spread along the border.
	   Under Eritrean administration now, Zambalesa considers both the
birr and the nakfa legal tender.
	   Shopkeeper Kidane Ghirmay said when the fighting erupted he sent
his eight children to the Ethiopian capital, Addis Ababa.
	   ``When I am in my house, I am afraid of the shelling. We expect
the war to start every day,'' he said. ``But when I am in my shop,
I am fine because people come in and we talk. But I am always
worried whether I will die today or tomorrow.''
	   The rattle of Kalashnikov rifle fire punctuates his comments as
Eritrean soldiers practice target shooting.
	   Before the brief war, Zalambesa was not considered a disputed
area, and Eritrea never questioned that it was in Ethiopian
territory. After Eritrea captured the town in June, both soldiers
and officials said it would be returned to Ethiopia following a
peace agreement.
	   But three months later, Eritrea's attitude has hardened.
	   The government of President Isaias Afwerki is calling for a
comprehensive demarcation supervised by a neutral third party of
the contested border traced by Italian colonial administrators
beginning last century.
	   Ethiopia says it will not talk peace until Eritrea withdraws
from disputed areas.
	   Both countries trade accusations of forced explusions of their
nationals. Diplomats and U.N. personnel in Eritrea believe
Ethiopia's claims are exaggerated.
	   In the trenches, the mood is relaxed. Apart from the occasional
Ethiopian shell lobbed into the villages around Zalambasa, the
front line is quiet.
	   The military buildup on both sides seems complete, and soldiers
are just awaiting orders.
	   In a small underground bunker serving as military tea house, a
soldier picks up his krar, a traditional stringed instrument and
sings words that underline Eritrea's confidence: ``The Ethiopians
lit the fire ... but the fire went out of control, and now they
have burned themselves.''
	   In Zalambesa, people wonder whether they will have to flee
again.
	   ``Every day I am praying for peace,'' Binyam said.

Kohl's place in history is secure as he leaves office

	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ The world will remember German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl best for a single moment _ Oct. 3, 1990 _ when he
reunified communist East Germany with the West.
	   German voters were thinking about the future, though, not the
past on Sunday, and they denied Kohl what would have been an
unprecedented fifth term after 16 years in office. The victory for
his younger rival, Gerhard Schroeder, brings an end not only to
Kohl's leadership but also to a chapter in post-Cold War German
politics.
	   It was a crushing rejection for Kohl, who had hoped to lead
Germany into the 21st century, and through two enormous projects he
was instrumental in setting in motion: the government's return to
Berlin, its prewar capital, and the introduction of Europe's common
currency, the euro.
	   With his defeat, he is even relinquishing control of his
Christian Democratic party which he has ruled with an iron fist
since 1973.
	   His eyes were watery, and his lisp more pronounced than usual as
he took the stage at his Christian Democratic Party headquarters
Sunday night to concede defeat.
	   ``It's a difficult night,'' Kohl said. ``Certainly for me.''
	   Thunderous applause from a packed audience greeted the
chancellor. And the chants of ``Hel-mut, Hel-mut'' recalled the
voices of East Germans eight years ago when the ``unification
chancellor'' visited them for the first time after the fall of the
Berlin Wall.
	   That was the brightest moment in Kohl's political career, but
not the only significant change he brought to Germans struggling
with the painful recovery from World War II.
	   He pushed to strengthen the European Union and sent German
troops overseas for the first time since the war, as U.N.
peacekeepers. But his achievements abroad may have been at the
expense of Germans at home, frustrated at unemployment stubbornly
fixed above 10 percent.
	   People called him ``The Fat One'' or ``The Old One,'' but the
apparently disrespectful nicknames were often tinged with affection
for a leader that has represented stability.
	   Kohl, 68, had campaigned on his image of experience and clout
with world powers, hoping Germans would want more of the same. But
many first-time voters, who have known no other chancellor, voted
strongly for change. And they were not the only ones.
	   Voters appeared to think Kohl and his party were out of new
ideas for solving Germany's problems. In regions of high
joblessness, support for Kohl dropped 10 percent from the last
election. Exit polls showed 43 percent of voters felt the Social
Democrats could fix unemployment, compared to just 28 percent for
the Christian Democrats.
	   One measure of the depth of Kohl's defeat: He even lost to the
Social Democrats in his Rhine River hometown of Ludwigshafen, in
the southwestern state of Rhineland-Palatinate.
	   It was here that he built his political career.
	   He entered politics at the age of 16, when he co-founded the
youth wing of the Christian Democratic Union party in his hometown,
as political life resumed following the Nazi defeat.
	   In 1969, he was elected governor of the state. He became leader
of the Christian Democrats in 1973. He was elected chancellor in
1982, winning on promises of a pro-market economic ``turnaround''
to combat unemployment.
	   Kohl's best years were during Europe's conservative days of the
1980s. But as Europe's mood shifted to the left, with Tony Blair
taking power in Britain and Lionel Jospin in France, Kohl had
become a lonely relic.
	   Germans, too, decided it was time for a new era. They voted him
out, ironically, over the same economic and employment issues that
helped bring him to power.
	   Loyal Kohl supporters watched the preliminary results showing a
clear Social Democrat victory with disbelief.
	   ``It couldn't be worse for Kohl,'' Utta Schweireinz sighed.
``Things are going to change now.''
	   Kohl admitted as much on German TV hours later, but sounded
almost relieved. ``I'm now going to live my life, just the way I
want it,'' the outgoing chancellor said. ``After many years of
enormous stress, it's going to be a great pleasure.''

	   GUATEMALA CITY, Guatemala (AP) _ A group of masked inmates armed
with knives and clubs killed two fellow prisoners in what
investigators said could be the result of a feud, police said
Sunday.
	   Police spokesman Capt. Hilario Garcia Lopez said the killings
occurred late Saturday in the capital's 18th District prison. He
identified the victims as Manuel de Jesus Ramirez Pacheco, 33, a
Salvadoran, and Atiliano Felipe Felipe, 30, a Guatemalan.
	   Garcia Ramirez told reporters the masked inmates went into the
cell where the two victims were held and beat and knifed them to
death before fleeing.
	   Ramirez was three months short of serving a 20-year sentence for
kidnapping and murder, Garcia Lopez said.
	   The two were part of a group of 39 prisoners brought to the
capital's jail for segregation after they took part Friday in a
huge prison riot in Puerto Barrios, in the northeastern part of the
country.
	   ---- &QC; 
	   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ Nine military police officers have been
arrested in connection with torture and extortion offences against
civilians, the O Globo newspaper reported Sunday.
	   The officers based at two Rio police stations were taken into
custody over the last 48 hours, said the daily.
	   They are accused of extorting a large amount of cash, jewels and
watches, reported O Globo. Five allegedly tortured a bricklayer to
make him hand over money.
	   No one at the police station investigating the case was Sunday
available for comment.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   MEXICO CITY (AP) _ A private group study Sunday showed there are
18 clandestine toxic waste dumps _ some dangerous _ in eight
Mexican states.
	   The report by the Private Sector Study Group for Sustained
Development located eight dumps in the State of Mexico, two in
Guanajuato, two in Hidalgo, two in Mexico City, and one each in
Baja California, San Luis Potosi, Sonora and Veracruz.
	   The dumps contained everything from crude oil, solvents and
hospital wastes to lead, chrome, pesticides, cadmium, arsenic,
asbestos, sulfur and mercury, it said. Their effects can range from
infectious disease to cancer, genetic malformations to poisoning.
	   Excerpts of the study were published by the newspaper Reforma.
	   So far, the government has done little to regulate the disposal
of toxic wastes in Mexico.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   LA PAZ, Mexico (AP) _ A government study warned Sunday that the
scenic Baja of La Paz, a favorite spot for water sportsmen near the
bottom of the Baja California Peninsula, is getting increasingly
polluted by organic and toxic wastes.
	   The study by the Regional Environmental Coordinating Committee
said the bay is showing an alarming level of disease-causing
bacteria.
	   In some places, bay waters near this capital of the state of
California South are even beginning to smell bad and may eventually
affect public health and destroy the region's tourism industry.
	   The committee blamed dozens of small communities for dumping raw
sewage in the bay, using illegal pipe lines, and in some cases
industries.
	   The committee is made up of investigators from the Navy, and
federal departments of education and public health, and the
Autonomous University of Baja California South.
	   ___ &QC; 
	   SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) _ Chile switched to summer time Sunday,
three weeks earlier than in previous years, in a move ordered by
the the government to save energy after a long drought this year.
	   Clocks were moved one hour ahead the past midnight, leaving the
country's official time three hours earlier than GMT.
	   A vast area in Chile has been drought stricken, forcing
authorities to launch a nationwide energy-saving campaign as most
of the electricy used in the country comes from hydroelectric
plants.

Germany's future chancellor Schroeder must now form government

<TEXT>
	   BONN, Germany (AP) _ Gerhard Schroeder, Germany's designated new
chancellor, is to begin talks Monday on building a coalition
government to tackle domestic troubles burdening the national
spirit after Chancellor Helmut Kohl's 16 years of conservative
rule.
	   Schroeder and his Social Democrats won a surprisingly strong
victory in national elections Sunday on a platform for change. His
new government now must follow through on pledges to end
unemployment _ stubbornly above 10 percent _ and to bring
long-awaited tax and economic reforms.
	   The future chancellor has said he hopes to lead a coalition with
the environmentalist Greens party, which would be entering the
government for the first time.
	   A Social Democrat-Greens coalition would be the most radical in
postwar Germany and a test of the Greens' ability to curb their
sometimes eccentric ideals in cooperation with a more mainstream
party.
	   During the election, the Greens campaigned on platforms that
outraged some Germans and amused others: raising gas prices to 5
marks (dlrs 3) per liter, introducing a 100-kilometer (60-mile)
speed limit on the autobahn.
	   These ideas, off-the-wall even for some Greens, were unlikely to
rock a future government, but the two parties might still have a
struggle agreeing on nuclear energy and military policy.
	   It remained unclear whether the two were strong enough to form a
stable majority in parliament. The Social Democrats won 41 percent
of the vote, and the Greens 6.6 percent. Together, the parties
would have 340 seats in the 656-seat parliament, a 12-vote
majority.
	   As the votes came in, Schroeder would not say Sunday night if
his coalition talks would start with the Greens. His other option
is to share power with Kohl's party, the Christian Democrats, in a
so-called ``grand coalition'' _ something Germany hasn't seen in
almost 30 years.
	   Schroeder reiterated he would not consider including in his
government the ex-communist Party of Democratic Socialism, which
won enough votes to stay in parliament. Many in the west view the
party as a troubling remnant of the former communist East German
state.
	   Kohl, the West's longest-serving leader, had sought an
unprecedented fifth term on the strength of his image of stability
and clout with world powers at a time of economic turmoil in Russia
and ongoing conflict in the Balkans.
	   But Germans voted for a fresh face of government, and Kohl
conceded the race by announcing he would step down as the leader of
his party. In a crushing defeat, his party lost support in all of
Germany's 16 states for a total of 35 percent of the vote.
	   Kohl even lost to the Social Democrats in his Rhine River
hometown of Ludwigshafen.
	   ``This is a hard evening for me, and for us all,'' Kohl said.
``... I wish Herr Schroeder the best of luck and a successful time
in office.''
	   Schroeder supporters streamed into the streets of Bonn, holding
balloons and chanting ``Kohl must go!'' Many voters have known no
other chancellor but Kohl, and the promise of change brought tears
of joy at party headquarters.
	   ``Finally, finally. I have rarely been so happy,'' said Uta
Tiedtke, 51, dabbing her eyes as she stood among the revelers. ``My
two children have never known anything other than Kohl. This means
the end of stagnation. We've been waiting for this so long.''
	   The new chancellor will be the first of his generation, rooted
in the 1960s leftist movement, to lead Europe's biggest nation.
Throwing up his arms in a victory salute, the 54-year-old Schroeder
promised cheering supporters he would keep promises to fight
	   ``The Kohl era has come to an end,'' Schroeder proclaimed. ``Our
task will be to thoroughly modernize our country.''
	   Besides tackling nitty-gritty reforms, Schroeder must lead
Germany through two enormous changes next year: the return of the
government to Berlin, its prewar capital, and the exchange of the
trusted German mark for Europe's common currency, the euro.
	   The liberal Free Democrats also won seats in the 656-seat
parliament with 6.2 percent of the vote.
	   Turnout was 81.5 percent of the 60.5 million voters, up from 79
percent in 1994.

Hurricane relief operation gains steam in Dominican Republic

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Inside a squalid,
overcrowded disaster shelter on Santo Domingo's northside, refugees
from Hurricane Georges seethed over life's latest indignity: the
food.
	   Stabbing a fork into a cold, soggy bowl of rice mixed with
tomato sauce, Juanito Montero thrust the foul concoction in a
reporter's face. ``They're not giving us anything!'' shouted the
27-year-old father of two, whose zinc and plywood house was washed
away by floods.
	   So the U.S. relief effort for the Dominican Republic is gaining
momentum, ferrying in tons of bottled water and plastic tarps for
thousands of struggling storm victims.
	   Naked children played inside the darkened San Vicente church,
home for the past week to 500 storm victims. Others lay languidly
on the cement floor, not seeming to notice a humanitarian visit
Sunday by a group of U.S. congressmen.
	   ``It's a heartbreaking situation for everyone,'' said
Representative Elton Gallegly, a California Republican. ``To call
it pathetic would be a gross understatement.''
	   More than 200 people were killed, hundreds were missing, and
100,000 made homeless when Georges struck the Dominican Republic on
Tuesday. Most victims died in flooding or mudslides; substandard
homes proved no match for the hurricane's destructive power and the
rivers it flooded.
	   The United States has shipped dlrs 500,000 worth of supplies,
including enough plastic sheeting to roof 15,000 homes. More aid
was coming, said Hugh Parmer, head of disaster relief for the U.S.
Agency for International Development.
	   At least six U.S. military helicopters were due Monday to carry
relief supplies and help rescuers reach towns cut off by flooding,
downed bridges and debris-choked roads, Parmer said.
	   Chopper crews hoped to reach San Juan de la Maguana, 120 miles
(192 kilometers) west of the capital, where 76 bodies were
recovered Thursday. Half the town, Parmer said, was under water or
buried in mud.
	   A guard at the presidential palace said he got through to
relatives in the town by cell phone, but the news was bad: his aunt
had died.
	   Georges killed more than 300 people throughout the Caribbean,
including at least 87 in Haiti, five in Cuba, three in St. Kitts
and two in Antigua. At least three were killed in Puerto Rico,
where damage surpassed dlrs 2 billion.
	   In Cuba, President Fidel Castro said the speedy evacuation of
hundreds of thousands of people probably saved many more from dying
during Georges' march across that island on Thursday and Friday.
	   ``The first victory was to reduce the losses,'' Castro said in a
speech broadcast Sunday. He said Cuba now had to help thousands
left homeless and assess agricultural damage.
	   In the Dominican capital of Santo Domingo, the U.S. Peace Corps
loaded private aircraft with bags of food and water to be dropped
into isolated villages. New York City sent search and rescue teams,
and Puerto Rico sent search dogs.
	   A U.S. Coast Guard C-130 cargo plane was to deliver relief
supplies collected by Puerto Rico's Catholic Church to the
southwestern Dominican city of Barahona.
	   At Santo Domingo's military airport, soldiers used forklifts to
unload flashlights, pinto beans, diapers, graham crackers and chain
saws _ all donated by Houston-based Enron Corp., an investor in the
Dominican electrical power industry.
	   Central Romana Sugar Co., owned by the Florida-based Fanjul
family, said it was opening field kitchens where its sugarcane
fields are located.

Palestinian statehood topping agenda at Arafat speech
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Speeches resume at 1400 GMT; Arafat not expected to speak
before 1600 GMT &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Even as Israel inched closer to an
agreement for a troop pullback from the West Bank, Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat seemed poised to rock the boat with a symbolic
speech before the General Assembly.
	   In a speech Monday to world leaders gathered for the assembly's
annual debate, Arafat was expected to restate his intention to
declare an independent Palestinian state next year, regardless of
whether a final peace agreement with Israel has been negotiated.
	   The forum has particular significance: Never before has Arafat _
or any other Palestinian _ addressed the audience from the podium
during the regular debate. The Palestinian observer mission was
granted that right earlier this summer.
	   Arafat was expected to use the speech to seek support for his
plans from U.N. member states who routinely back the Palestinian
cause over Israeli interests in U.N. matters.
	   He refused Sunday to back away from his stated plans despite
pleas from the United States and warnings from Israel to refrain
from any provocative declaration.
	   ``The international community and all peace-loving people must
exert every possible effort to ensure the implementation of the
agreement before May 4, 1999,'' he said in a speech hosted by the
Center for Middle East Peace and Economic Cooperation, a private,
nonpartisan group.
	   ``This is the date,'' Arafat said. ``It just cannot come and go
like any other day. On that day, we hope that our basic choice of
reaching an agreement is realized.''
	   After the speech, Israel's ambassador to the United Nations,
Dori Gold, said the Palestinian leader was making a mistake by
sticking to the May 4 deadline. ``A declaration of statehood on May
4, 1999, will collapse the process,'' he said.
	   U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright has said she hoped
Arafat would not use the occasion to make a unilateral declaration
of his intention to set up a Palestinian state.
	   In his speech, Arafat also accused Israeli Prime Minister
Benjamin Netanyahu of undermining the peace process, including the
failure to withdraw Israeli troops from the West Bank by March
under the Hebron Accord.
	   ``Since the current Israeli government assumed office, hopes for
peace began to fade out, replaced by despair and violence,'' he
said.
	   Netanyahu said Sunday on CNN that an agreement was ``almost
complete about the amount of land that we would hand over. It is
territory that is uninhabited by Palestinians but is very important
for our security.''
	   The remaining issue, he said, was ``to make sure that the land
that we hand over to the Palestinians does not become a base for
continued terrorist attacks against Israel.''
	   Both Netanyahu and Arafat held meetings over the weekend with
Albright and were expected to meet separately with U.S. President
Bill Clinton this week.
	   Nabil Shaath, a senior Palestinian official and negotiator, said
the Palestinians told Albright ``that we are insisting on the
package deal, and we are not ready to accept anything less than
that.''

Victoria state faces a week without gas as industry shuts down
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Industry in Victoria state began
massive shutdowns Monday as businesses and consumers are without
natural gas after a series of explosions and a two-day fire
crippled an Esso refinery.
	   Up to 100,000 workers may be sent home in the coming days, The
Age newspaper in Melbourne cited industry sources as saying, and
the gas cutoff could last a week.
	   Car manufacturers Ford and Toyota have already announced
shutdowns, totaling 4,600 workers Monday. Another 3,000 workers
could be affected Tuesday.
	   Australian Industry Group director David Whiting said the range
of industries hit was massive, from car makers, breweries and dairy
and meat producers to small companies using heat to make ceramics,
office equipment or cement.
	   ``It is too early to put any real price on it, but we are
talking hundreds of millions'' of dollars in losses, Whiting said.
	   Law firm Slater and Gordon is considering what it says could be
the largest class action in Australian legal history, joining every
Victorian gas consumer in suing the gas provider and supplier.
	   Another firm, Maurice Blackburn and Co., will decide Monday if
it will take legal action on behalf of hospitality and union
clients.
	   At least five explosions and several fires ripped through Esso's
Longford gas plant near Sale about 110 miles (180 km) east of
Melbourne, on Friday, killing two men and injuring eight, one
critically.
	   The blaze was extinguished Sunday, but not before it had
extensively damaged the 29-year-old plant and some systems and
piping. The plant had supplied some 80 percent of Victoria's gas.
	   About 1 million Victorian residents, facing fines of 500
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 290), were forced to turn off their
gas meters Saturday after the state's supply authority, VENCorp.,
ordered the shutdown of the state's system.
	   Esso chairman and managing director Robert Olsen said experts,
including 12 from overseas, would try to get the plant running to
restore gas supplies.
	   He said it was a coincidence the plant had caught fire so soon
after production was halted by an ice plug in June and rejected
union suggestions maintenance standards had been lax.
	   This is the third major infrastructure collapse in this part of
the world this year.
	   Auckland, New Zealand's central business district was blacked
out and suffered electricity shortages for some six weeks earlier
this year, and Sydney has just gone through a series of
drinking-water alerts after the parasites giardia and
cryptosporidium were found in the water system in high numbers.
	   Victoria state Premier Jeff Kennett raised the possibility of a
judicial inquiry into what caused the explosion, and is waiting for
a report from Esso due Monday.
	   ``This is going to effect this state dramatically for at least a
week,'' he said.
	   ``It may be longer, and I certainly think that everyone is
entitled to know the actual reasons and we also want to know
whether we can be protected from this happening again.''
	   VENCorp. spokesman David Guthrie-Jones said a small amount of
gas being supplied to Victoria by the AGL network of New South
Wales was ``absolutely crucial to us at the moment, keeping our
system afloat so that we can have gas for emergency purposes.''
	   The request for New South Wales gas was made directly after the
Victorian Esso supply was shut down.
	   The pipeline linkup allowing New South Wales to send gas to
Victoria was only completed last month.

LTCB affiliate Japan BC-Japan-Bankruptcy, Leasing goes bust in
</HEADLINE>
Japan's biggest corporate bankruptcy &QL; 
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with LTCB shares trading at reconrd low in 12th graf &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan Leasing Corp., one of three non-bank
affiliates of the troubled Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan, said
Monday it has applied for court protection in Japan's largest ever
corporate bankruptcy.
	   Koji Suzuki, a spokesman for Japan Leasing, said the company
filed for court protection from creditors with the Tokyo District
Court on Sunday night.
	   Suzuki refused to discuss other details, saying the company was
to hold a news conference later Monday.
	   Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., a Tokyo-based credit research firm, said
Japan Leasing is estimated to have debts exceeding 2.44 trillion
yen (dlrs 18.24 billion), said Tanaka, a Teikoku Databank
spokeswoman.
	   That made the filing Japan's largest corporate bankruptcy, said
Teikoku Databank spokeswoman Maiko Tanaka.
	   It exceeded the previous record debt in a bankruptcy held by
Crown Leasing, a non-bank with debts of 1.18 trillion yen (dlrs
8.86 billion), which went under in April, 1997, she said.
	   The figures cited by Teikoku do not take into account failures
which occurred without formal bankruptcy filings, such as the
collapse of Yamaichi Securities Co. _ Japan's largest corporate
failure ever.
	   Yamaichi, announced last in November it was throwing in the
towel, leaving debts of more than 3 trillion yen (dlrs 22.38
billion) and 8,000 people without work. It formally shut down
operations at the end of March.
	   Japan's government has been wrangling for months over how to
deal with the LTCB, which is also on the verge of collapse under
the weight of failed real estate loans made during the late 1980s.
	   With the LTCB in political limbo, reconstruction of the
debt-ridden Japan Leasing was impossible, observers said.
	   The collapse of Japan Leasing was also likely to affect
reconstruction plans for two other LTCB nonbanks _ Japan Landic
Corp. and Nippon Enterprise Development Corp.
	   In trading on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, LTCB's share price
opened sharply lower Monday, briefly hitting an all-time low of 13
yen (9.5 cents) a share before rebounding slightly to 14 yen (10
cents).
	   Japan Leasing was established in 1963 as Japan's first leasing
firm.

Aziz meets with Annan, UN inspection stalemat looms
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: LEAD prospects uncertain &QL; 
 &UR; By NICOLE WINFIELD &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   UNITED NATIONS (AP) _ Secretary-General Kofi Annan has been
meeting regularly with the Security Council to devise a way out of
the stalemate with Iraq over arms inspections, but Baghdad has
defiantly said it won't budge without a glimmer of relief from
eight years of crippling sanctions.
	   Annan was to meet Monday with Deputy Prime Minister Tariq Aziz
over the impasse, which has paralyzed inspections for seven weeks.
They were expected to discuss Annan's proposal for a comprehensive
review of Iraq's compliance with U.N. resolutions demanding it
destroy its weapons of mass destruction.
	   The council asked Annan to formulate such a propsal earlier this
month, hoping that Iraq would back down from the standoff knowing
that a comprehensive review could highlight its seven years of work
to destroy its banned weapons.
	   The council, however, stressed that no such review would take
place until Baghdad rescinded its Aug. 5 decision to stop
cooperating with U.N. inspectors.
	   Aziz was instructed to insist that the United Nations take the
first step in ending a standoff, Iraq's vice president, Taha Yassin
Ramadan said in a statement carried Friday by the official al-Iraq
newspaper.
	   The meeting comes as chemical weapons experts have been meeting
at U.N. headquarters to discuss the findings of Swiss and French
laboratories testing missile fragments for suspected traces of the
deadly VX gas.
	   A U.S. armly lab reported finding traces of the gas in June but
Baghdad disputed the findings.
	   The chief U.N. weapons inspector, Richard Butler, agreed to send
other samples to European labs, though he has said Saddam Hussein
still must answer for the positive U.S. tests.
	   Preliminary results have been inconclusive, diplomats have said.
	   U.N. arms experts must report that Iraq has destroyed its
chemical, biological and nuclear weapons _ and the long-range
missiles to deliver them _ before the council will lift sanctions
imposed after Baghdad invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   Baghdad stopped cooperating with inspectors after Butler refused
to certify that it had destroyed its banned weapons.
	   The council punished Iraq by suspending periodic review of
sanctions that have crippled Iraq's economy. The action left
Baghdad with little room to press for the easing of sanctions
imposed after Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990.
	   But the council agreed to conduct a ``comprehensive review'' of
sanctions after Iraq lets U.N. inspectors go back to work. Such a
move could force the council to acknowledge Iraq's progress in
ridding itself of weapons of mass destruction while generating
pressure for a lifting of sanctions.

 &UR; By The Associated Press &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   ST. LOUIS (AP) _ Mark McGwire ended his spectacular season as
mightily as he started it, hitting his record 69th and 70th homers
in the St. Louis Cardinals' final game, a 7-6 victory Sunday over
the Montreal Expos.
	   McGwire, who hit five homers on the final weekend, connected
against rookie Mike Thurman in the third inning, then broke a 3-all
tie in the seventh with a three-run shot off Carl Pavano (6-9).
	   McGwire moved four ahead of Sammy Sosa and ended nine in front
of Roger Maris' old record. McGwire also got his 162nd walk, tying
Ted Williams (1947 and '49) for the second-highest total ever
behind Babe Ruth's 170 in 1923.
	   John Frascatore (3-4) was the winner and Juan Acevedo got his
15th save.
 &UR; Astros 4, Cubs 3
	   Moments after another heartbreaking loss in Houston, Chicago won
a reprieve when San Francisco lost at Colorado, forcing a
tiebreaking wild-card playoff between the Cubs and Giants on Monday
night at Wrigley Field.
	   Carl Everett tripled off Rod Beck (3-4) leading off the 11th
when a retreating Sammy Sosa shied away from the ball as he reached
the warning track in right, and Richard Hidalgo hit a sacrifice
fly.
	   Sosa, who didn't homer, singled for his 158th RBI, fourth-best
in NL history. He also struck out, flied out twice and singled in
the eighth, finishing 2-for-5.
	   Scott Elarton (2-1) pitched two perfect innings.
 &UR; Rockies 9, Giants 8
	   In Denver, San Francisco wasted a 7-0 lead, watched Neifi Perez
hit a game-winning homer off Robb Nen (7-7) in the ninth inning
about a minute after the Cubs lost.
	   San Francisco and Chicago are both 89-73 heading into Monday's
tiebreaker.
	   The Giants, who trailed the Cubs by five games with 10 days left
in the season but closed with nine wins in 10 games, led 7-6 in the
seventh before Vinny Castilla hit a two-run homer off Julian
Tavarez. But the Giants came right back in the eighth and tied it
on Jeff Kent's solo homer off Pedro Astacio.
	   Colorado's Larry Walker went 2-for-4 and won his first batting
title with a .363 average, nine points ahead of New York's John
Olerud. Jerry Dipoto (3-4) pitched a scoreless ninth for the win.
 &UR; Braves 7, Mets 2
	   In Atlanta, New York, which had a one-game lead in the NL
wild-card race going into their final five games and were still in
a three-way tie with two games to go, fell behind 5-0 and was
eliminated.
	   Contending for their first postseason appearance since 1988, the
Mets lost their final five games, scoring just seven runs in their
last 44 innings.
	   During three days in Atlanta, the Mets stranded 32 runners _ 11
on Sunday _ and left the bases loaded four times.
	   Greg Maddux (18-9) helped Atlanta to its 106 win, the most in
the NL since the Mets had 108 in 1986. Armando Reynosa (7-3) was
pounded for five runs and six hits in 1 2-3 innings.
 &UR; Marlins 6, Phillies 5
 &UR; Phillies 7, Marlins 3
	   In Miami, Ruben Amaro Jr., playing his final major league game
before becoming the Phillies' assistant general manager, singled
home the go-ahead run in the second game. Kevin Sefcik drove in a
career-high four runs for the Phillies in the opener.
	   The Marlins, who swept the Phillies on Saturday, finished at
54-108, the worst record in the majors since 1979, when Oakland
also dropped 108 and Toronto lost 109. The Marlins had the worst
record ever for a defending World Series champion, breaking the
previous low (74-88) set by the 1991 Cincinnati Reds.
	   Brian Meadows (11-13) allowed three runs and seven hits in five
innings in the opener and Antonio Alfonseca got one out for his
eighth save. Tyler Green (6-12) was the loser. Carlton Loewer (7-8)
won the second game and Rafael Medina (2-6) lost.
 &UR; Reds 4, Pirates 1
	   In Cincinnati, the Reds ended their season by putting together
the majors' first all-brother infield _ Barry and Stephen Larkin,
and Bret and Aaron Boone _ and won on Aaron Boone's three-run
homer.
	   Roberto Petagine hit a solo homer and Boone had a three-run shot
off Jose Silva (6-7) as Pittsburgh finished with an eight-game
losing streak.
	   Brett Tomko (13-14) gave up five hits and struck out seven in
his first complete game in 53 career starts.
 &UR; Dodgers 2, Brewers 1
	   In Los Angeles, Chan Ho Park (15-9) allowed one run and eight
hits in six innings for his career-high 15th win, and Mark
Grudzielanek drove in the go-ahead run with a sacrifice fly off
Bill Pulsipher (3-4). Jeff Shaw got three outs for his 48th save.

	   TORONTO (AP) _ Roy Halladay, pitching just his second major
league game, came within one out of a no-hitter Sunday, losing his
bid when pinch-hitter Bobby Higginson homered in the Toronto Blue
Jays' 2-1 victory over the Detroit Tigers.
	   Halladay (1-0) earned his first victory in the majors, striking
out eight and walking none. The 21-year-old right-hander was trying
to become the first rookie to pitch a no-hitter since Wilson
Alvarez did it for the Chicago White Sox against Baltimore in 1991.
	   Alex Gonzalez and Shawn Green homered off Justin Thompson
(11-14).
 &UR; Yankees 8, Devil Rays 3
	   In New York, Bernie Williams went 2-for-2 to win the AL batting
title and rookie Shane Spencer hit his third grand slam in nine
days.
	   In peak form for the start of the AL playoffs Tuesday night, the
Yankees (114-48) won their seventh straight. With a .704 winning
percentage, New York became the first team since the 1954 Cleveland
Indians (111-43) to play better than .700 ball over an entire
season.
	   New York, which won the second-most games ever behind the 1906
Cubs (116-36), opens the postseason at home against Texas.
	   Williams had a pair of singles and a sacrifice fly to end the
season with a .339 average _ two points better than Boston's Mo
Vaughn, who went 2-for-4.
	   Jim Bruske (1-0) won and Rick White (2-6) lost. Tampa Bay was
1-11 against New York.
 &UR; Red Sox 6, Orioles 4
	   In Boston, Mo Vaughn drove in two runs with his 40th homer and a
single but failed to overtake Williams. Vaughn also matched his
career-high, 16-game hitting streak.
	   The Red Sox, who clinched the AL wild-card berth last Thursday,
begin their first postseason series since 1995 at Cleveland on
Tuesday, with Pedro Martinez (19-7) going against the Indians'
Jaret Wright (12-10). Boston (92-70) finished with its best record
since 1986 when it was 95-66 and lost a seven-game World Series to
the New York Mets.
	   Carlos Valdez (1-0) got the victory. Tom Gordon got his 46th
save with his major-league record 43rd in a row. Mike Mussina
(13-10) lost but the Orioles finished with a record-low 81 errors,
three fewer than the previous mark set by Minnesota in 1988.
 &UR; White Sox 7, Royals 6
	   In Kansas City, Missouri, Albert Belle drove in three runs and
completed one of the most productive seasons in Chicago history.
	   Belle homered and added two singles, hiking his hit total to
201. He set team records with 49 home runs, 48 doubles, 153 RBIs,
401 total bases and 100 extra-base hits.
	   Belle is just the fifth player since 1950 _ and the first
American Leaguer since Boston's Jim Rice in 1978 _ with 400 total
bases. He had 31 homers after the All-Star break.
	   James Baldwin (13-6) gave up three runs on three hits in five
innings. Tim Belcher (14-14) was tagged for seven runs and eight
hits in five innings.
 &UR; Twins 6, Indians 2
	   In Minneapolis, the AL Central champion Indians finished the
regular season with their sixth loss in seven games Sunday as Matt
Lawton hit a three-run double for Minnesota.
	   Playing in what probably was the last game of his 21-year
career, Paul Molitor went 2-for-4 for the Twins. The 42-year-old
St. Paul native is eighth on the career list with 3,319 hits. He
has said he will announce a decision on whether he will retire in
the next month or so.
	   Eric Milton (8-13) won and Bartolo Colon (14-9) lost.
 &UR; Rangers 12, Mariners 6
	   In Seattle, Rusty Greer, Roberto Kelly, Milt Cuyler and Lee
Stevens homered for the AL West champion Rangers.
	   Greer had a two-run homer off Paul Spoljaric (4-6) in the third
inning and Kelly connected for a three-run shot in the fourth for
an 8-2 lead.
	   Tony Fossas (1-3) got the victory with 1 1-3 innings of
scoreless relief.
 &UR; Angels 4, Athletics 2
	   In Oakland, California, Jarrod Washburn (6-3) allowed three hits
in 6 2-3 innings in his first start since July 25 and Randy Velarde
went 3-for-4 with three RBIs. Shigetoshi Hasegawa got one out for
his fifth save.
	   Garret Anderson hit his 15th home run to lead off the fourth
against Jay Witasick (1-3), breaking a 1-1 tie.

	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ An earthquake with a preliminary
measurement of 3.5 rattled Melbourne on Monday, but was unlikely to
have caused major damage, the Seismology Research Center said.
	   Seismologist Cameron Bricker said the tremor, which occurred at
8:32 a.m. (2232 GMT Sunday), was centered near Portsea on Port
Phillip Bay, about 30 miles (50 km) south of Melbourne.
	   It was believed to have had a depth of about 6 miles (10 km).
	   ``We've had reports from right across the central business
district from people who felt the quake,'' he said.
	   Bricker said the tremor was not likely to cause major damage.
	   ``The most you would expect is that pictures would be moving on
walls, and other small objects might move around,'' he said.
	   The scale of the quake was not unusual for south-eastern
Australia, he said.
	   ``It was a little larger than we've had in the past couple of
years, but this is not unusual for southeastern Australia,'' he
said.

Tokyo stocks higher, dollar rises in early trading
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices rose sharply in early trading
Monday, shrugging off the failure of an affiliate of the troubled
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. The U.S. dollar rose against the
yen.
	   The benchmark No. 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 240.29
points, or 1.75 percent, to 13,964.29 points in the first 30
minutes of trading. On Friday, the Nikkei shed 481.94 points, or
3.39 percent.
	   The dollar bought 136.74 yen in early trading, up 2.10 yen from
late Friday in Tokyo and also above its late New York rate of
136.25 yen on Friday.
	   Traders said share prices were sharply higher early Monday, led
by an advance on the futures market and buying by public funds.
	   ``Ahead of the September book-closing, public funds may be
buying on the futures market,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager
of the stock division at Ryoko Securities.
	   Also supporting the market was news that Japan's ruling and main
opposition parties had reached an agreement on key banking reform
measures over the weekend, paving the way for passage of
legislation in Parliament by early next month, traders said.
	   But shares of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan dived to an
all-time low of 13 yen (9.5 cents) per share, from Friday's finish
of 24 yen (18 cents).
	   The plunge came after an affiliate of LTCB applied late Sunday
for court protection in Japan's largest ever corporate bankruptcy.
	   LTCB shares were later traded at 14 yen (10 cents) per share.
The bank's previous record low of 18 yen (13 cents) was recorded on
Sept. 18.
	   Japan Leasing Corp., one of LTCB's three non-bank affiliates,
said Monday it has applied for court protection.
	   Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., a Tokyo-based credit research firm, said
Japan Leasing is estimated to have debts exceeding 2.44 trillion
yen (dlrs 18.24 billion), making it Japan's largest corporate
bankruptcy.
	   LTCB, one of Japan's largest banks, has been unable to shake off
speculation it may collapse under the weight of failed real estate
loans.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 12.06 yen, or 1.15 percent, to 1,061.99. On
Friday, the TOPIX closed down 28.08, or 2.6 percent.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.825 percent from Friday's finish of 0.815
percent, driving its price down to 108.77 yen from 108.87 yen.

Japan Leasing goes bust in Japan's biggest corporate bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with Obuchi call for calm, market reaction; RECASTS
throughout; ADDS background, byline &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese company with debts estimated at more
than 2.4 trillion yen (dlrs 18 billion) said Monday it has filed
for bankruptcy, the largest such action in Japan's history.
	   Koji Suzuki, a spokesman for Japan Leasing Corp., said the
company filed for protection from creditors with the Tokyo District
Court late Sunday night.
	   Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi urged traders to be calm as the
financial markets opened Monday, and share prices initially rose on
the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
	   Traders said the market was bouyed by an agreement between the
ruling and main opposition parties over the weekend on bills to
clean up Japan's banking crisis.
	   At the center of the political debate over how to deal with the
mountain of bad debt saddling Japan's banks is the Long-Term Credit
Bank of Japan, an affiliate of Japan Leasing that is also on the
verge of collapse.
	   With the LTCB in political limbo, reconstruction of the
debt-ridden Japan Leasing was impossible, observers said.
	   The fall of Japan Leasing was also likely to affect
reconstruction plans for two other LTCB affiliates _ Japan Landic
Corp. and Nippon Enterprise Development Corp.
	   Though the Tokyo market in general was up, LTCB's share price
opened sharply lower Monday, briefly hitting an all-time low of 13
yen (9.5 cents) a share before rebounding slightly to 14 yen (10
cents). LTCB closed at 24 yen (18 cents) a share on Friday.
	   Japan Leasing was established in 1963 as Japan's first leasing
firm.
	   Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., a Tokyo-based credit research firm, said
Japan Leasing is believed to have debts exceeding 2.44 trillion yen
(dlrs 18.24 billion).
	   Teikoku Databank spokeswoman Maiko Tanaka said that made it
Japan's largest corporate bankruptcy, exceeding that of Crown
Leasing, a lender with debts of 1.18 trillion yen (dlrs 8.86
billion) that went under in April 1997.
	   The figures cited by Teikoku do not take into account failures
which occurred without formal bankruptcy filings, such as the
collapse of Yamaichi Securities Co.
	   Yamaichi, announced last in November it was throwing in the
towel, leaving debts of more than 3 trillion yen (dlrs 22.38
billion) and 8,000 people without work.
	   Yamaichi formally shut down operations at the end of March.

Victoria state faces a week without gas as industry shuts down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds that many people lack hot water or cooking gas;
crematorium shut down. &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Industry in Victoria state began
massive shutdowns Monday as businesses and consumers are without
natural gas after a series of explosions and a two-day fire
crippled an Esso refinery.
	   Up to 100,000 workers may be sent home in the coming days, The
Age newspaper in Melbourne cited union sources as saying, and the
gas cutoff could last a week.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold
showers, and are looking for electric griddles and fry pans to cook
their food.
	   Victoria's largest crematorium, The Necropolis, has had to
suspend cremations until he crisis is resolved.
	   Car manufacturers Ford and Toyota have already announced
shutdowns, totaling 4,600 workers Monday. Another 3,000 workers
could be affected Tuesday.
	   Australian Industry Group director David Whiting said the range
of industries hit was massive, from car makers, breweries and dairy
and meat producers to small companies using heat to make ceramics,
office equipment or cement.
	   ``It is too early to put any real price on it, but we are
talking hundreds of millions'' of dollars in losses, Whiting said.
	   Law firm Slater and Gordon is considering what it says could be
the largest class action in Australian legal history, joining every
Victorian gas consumer in suing the gas provider and supplier.
	   Another firm, Maurice Blackburn and Co., will decide Monday if
it will take legal action on behalf of hospitality and union
clients.
	   At least five explosions and several fires ripped through Esso's
Longford gas plant near Sale about 110 miles (180 km) east of
Melbourne, on Friday, killing two men and injuring eight, one
critically.
	   The blaze was extinguished Sunday, but not before it had
extensively damaged the 29-year-old plant and some systems and
piping. The plant had supplied some 80 percent of Victoria's gas.
	   About 1 million Victorian residents, facing fines of 500
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 290), were forced to turn off their
gas meters Saturday after the state's supply authority, VENCorp.,
ordered the shutdown of the state's system.
	   Esso chairman and managing director Robert Olsen said experts,
including 12 from overseas, would try to get the plant running to
restore gas supplies.
	   He said it was a coincidence the plant had caught fire so soon
after production was halted by an ice plug in June and rejected
union suggestions maintenance standards had been lax.
	   This is the third major infrastructure collapse in this part of
the world this year.
	   Auckland, New Zealand's central business district was blacked
out and suffered electricity shortages for some six weeks earlier
this year, and Sydney has just gone through a series of
drinking-water alerts after the parasites giardia and
cryptosporidium were found in the water system in high numbers.
	   Victoria state Premier Jeff Kennett raised the possibility of a
judicial inquiry into what caused the explosion, and is waiting for
a report from Esso due Monday.
	   ``This is going to effect this state dramatically for at least a
week,'' he said.
	   ``It may be longer, and I certainly think that everyone is
entitled to know the actual reasons and we also want to know
whether we can be protected from this happening again.''
	   VENCorp. spokesman David Guthrie-Jones said a small amount of
gas being supplied to Victoria by the AGL network of New South
Wales was ``absolutely crucial to us at the moment, keeping our
system afloat so that we can have gas for emergency purposes.''
	   The request for New South Wales gas was made directly after the
Victorian Esso supply was shut down.
	   The pipeline linkup allowing New South Wales to send gas to
Victoria was only completed last month.

Langer wins back test job
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Brisbane Broncos captain Allan Langer
won back his test job Monday for the Oct. 9 match against New
Zealand after leading his club to victory in the Australian Rugby
League final Sunday.
	   Langer was a controversial omission from the Australian team
which lost the first test on April 24. He replaces Andrew Johns,
who has been moved to hooker.
	   Langer also takes over from injured Laurie Daley as captain for
the Brisbane test.
	   Nine Brisbane players were rewarded for Sunday's 38-12 victory
over Canterbury and there were 11 changes from the side beaten
24-16 in the opening test in Auckland.
	   Broncos prop Shane Webcke heads the list of new caps, with
Canterbury frontrowers Darren Britt and Steve Price winning
call-ups along with North Sydney utility Ben Ikin and Melbourne
second-rower Robbie Kearns.
	   Brisbane center Darren Smith, whose brother Jason has been

Victoria state faces a week without gas as industry shuts down
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: Adds in 1st paragraph that 1.4 million consumers are affected &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   MELBOURNE, Australia (AP) _ Industry in Australia's Victoria
state began massive shutdowns Monday as businesses and 1.4 million
consumers are without natural gas after a series of explosions and
a two-day fire crippled an Esso refinery.
	   Up to 100,000 workers may be sent home in the coming days, The
Age newspaper cited industry sources as saying, and the gas cutoff
could last a week.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold
showers, and are looking for electric griddles and fry pans to cook
their food.
	   Victoria's largest crematorium has had to suspend cremations
until he crisis is resolved.
	   Car manufacturers Ford and Toyota have already announced
shutdowns, totaling 4,600 workers Monday. Another 3,000 workers
could be affected Tuesday.
	   Australian Industry Group director David Whiting said the range
of industries hit was massive, from car makers, breweries and dairy
and meat producers to small companies using heat to make ceramics,
office equipment or cement.
	   ``It is too early to put any real price on it, but we are
talking hundreds of millions'' of dollars in losses, Whiting said.
	   Law firm Slater and Gordon is considering what it says could be
the largest class action in Australian legal history, joining every
Victorian gas consumer in suing the gas provider and supplier.
	   Another firm, Maurice Blackburn and Co., will decide Monday if
it will take legal action on behalf of hospitality and union
clients.
	   At least five explosions and several fires ripped through Esso's
Longford gas plant near Sale about 110 miles (180 km) east of
Melbourne, on Friday, killing two men and injuring eight, one
critically.
	   The blaze was extinguished Sunday, but not before it had
extensively damaged the 29-year-old plant and some systems and
piping. The plant had supplied some 80 percent of Victoria's gas.
	   About 1 million Victorian residents, facing fines of 500
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 290), were forced to turn off their
gas meters Saturday after the state's supply authority, VENCorp.,
ordered the shutdown of the state's system.
	   Esso chairman and managing director Robert Olsen said experts,
including 12 from overseas, would try to get the plant running to
restore gas supplies.
	   He said it was a coincidence the plant had caught fire so soon
after production was halted by an ice plug in June and rejected
union suggestions maintenance standards had been lax.
	   The explosion and shutdown mark the third major infrastructure
collapse this year in this part of the world.
	   Auckland, New Zealand's central business district was blacked
out and suffered electricity shortages for some six weeks earlier
this year.
	   And Sydney, Australia's largest city, has just gone through a
series of drinking-water alerts after dangerous parasites were
found in high numbers in the water system.
	   Victoria state Premier Jeff Kennett raised the possibility of a
judicial inquiry into what caused the explosion, and was waiting
for a report from Esso due Monday.
	   ``This is going to effect this state dramatically for at least a
week,'' he said.

Japan Leasing goes bust in Japan's biggest corporate bankruptcy
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES with quotes from company officials, company's estimate
of debt &QL; 
 &UR; By TODD ZAUN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ A Japanese company with debts of more 2 trillion
yen (dlrs 16 billion) has filed for bankruptcy, the largest such
action in Japan's history and the latest in a series of
high-profile failures marking Japan's worst recession in decades.
	   Hiroaki Okamoto, president of Japan Leasing Corp., said Monday
the company filed for protection from creditors with the Tokyo
District Court late Sunday night.
	   A lawyer for the company said it had debts of 2.18 trillion yen
(dlrs 16 billion).
	   ``I deeply apologize to our creditors and for the effects this
will have on the financial system,'' Okamoto said.
	   Hoping to keep the failure from setting off a market meltdown,
Prime Minister Keizo Obuchi urged traders to be calm, and share
prices initially rose on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
	   Traders said the market was bouyed by an agreement between
Obuchi's Liberal Democratic Party the the main opposition parties
over the weekend on bills to clean up Japan's overall banking
crisis.
	   Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa stressed that the quick
establishment of a comprehensive plan to stabilize the financial
sector ``will be greatly beneficial, both domestically and
abroad.''
	   He also said Japan Leasing's failure was not unexpected. Japan
is mired in its worst recession in decades, and bankruptcies are at
a record high.
	   ``It's more the case that many people had been expecting (Japan
Leasing's collapse), rather than that it happened suddenly one
day,'' he said.
	   At the center of the political debate over the mountain of bad
debt saddling Japan's banks is how to deal with the Long-Term
Credit Bank of Japan, a huge affiliate of Japan Leasing that is
also on the verge of collapse.
	   Analysts said delays caused by the political wrangling over what
to do about the LTCB were partly to blame. With the LTCB in limbo,
they said, reconstruction of the debt-ridden Japan Leasing was
virtually impossible.
	   Analysts said the fall of Japan Leasing was also likely to
affect reconstruction plans for two other LTCB affiliates _ Japan
Landic Corp. and Nippon Enterprise Development Corp.
	   Though the Tokyo market in general was up, LTCB's share price
opened sharply lower Monday, briefly hitting an all-time low of 13
yen (9.5 cents) a share before rebounding slightly to 14 yen (10
cents). LTCB closed at 24 yen (18 cents) a share on Friday.
	   Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., a Tokyo-based credit research firm, said
Japan Leasing's bankruptcy would be the biggest ever in Japan.
	   Teikoku Databank spokeswoman Maiko Tanaka said the worst
previous bankruptcy was of Crown Leasing, a lender with debts of
1.18 trillion yen (dlrs 8.86 billion) that went under in April
1997.
	   The figures cited by Teikoku, however, do not take into account
failures which occurred without formal bankruptcy filings, such as
the collapse of Yamaichi Securities Co.
	   Yamaichi, announced last in November it was throwing in the
towel, leaving debts of more than 3 trillion yen (dlrs 22.38
billion) and 8,000 people without work.
	   Yamaichi formally shut down operations at the end of March.
	   Japan Leasing was established in 1963 as Japan's first leasing
firm.

Japan's Asahi, Tokai banks considering partnership
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japan's Asahi Bank Ltd. and Tokai Bank Ltd., two
medium-sized city banks, said Monday that they were working out the
final details of a proposed alliance.
	   Spokesmen for the banks, who requested anonymity, declined to
give further details, but said a formal announcement on the link-up
was expected later Monday.
	   The Nihon Keizai financial daily reported Monday that the banks
had agreed on a comprehensive partnership that would include
cross-shareholding, joint development of financial products and
integration of redundant branches.
	   It said the banks may also eventually establish a joint holding
company.
	   The expected alliance comes amid ongoing consolidation in the
financial sector as Japan introduces its ``big bang'' deregulation
reforms aimed at invigorating the economy by increasing
competition.
	   Earlier this month, four Mitsubishi group financial institutions
agreed to set up a securities company capitalized at about 200-300
billion yen (dlrs 1.46-2.19 billion).
	   In July, financial giants Sumitomo Bank and Daiwa Securities Co.
agreed on a partnership in the investment banking business.
	   Asahi and Tokai want to bolster their retail banking operations
through the alliance, the Nihon Keizai said.
	   Reports of the partnership sent shares of the banks sharply
higher Monday morning on the Tokyo Stock Exchange. Asahi shares
rose 1.6 percent to 391 yen (dlrs 2.86), while those of Tokai
gained 2.1 percent to 542 yen (dlrs 3.96).

Tokyo stocks, dollar, higher at midday
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; Eds: UPDATES thruout with midday trading &QL; 

<TEXT>
	   TOKYO (AP) _ Japanese stock prices rose in morning trading
Monday, shrugging off the failure of an affiliate of the troubled
Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan. The U.S. dollar was higher against
the yen.
	   The benchmark No. 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average gained 230.25
points, or 1.68 percent, ending the morning session at 13,954.09.
On Friday, the Nikkei shed 481.94 points, or 3.39 percent.
	   Traders said stocks were buoyed by an advance on the futures
market and buying by public funds.
	   ``Ahead of the September book-closing, public funds may be
buying on the futures market,'' said Masaru Arai, general manager
of the stock division at Ryoko Securities.
	   Also supporting the market was news that Japan's ruling and main
opposition parties had reached an agreement on key banking reform
measures over the weekend, paving the way for passage of
legislation in Parliament by early next month, traders said.
	   But shares of the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan dived to an
all-time low of 13 yen (9.5 cents) per share, from Friday's finish
of 24 yen (18 cents).
	   The plunge came after a non-bank affiliate of LTCB, Japan
Leasing Corp., applied late Sunday for court protection in Japan's
largest ever corporate bankruptcy.
	   LTCB shares were later traded at 14 yen (10 cents) per share.
The bank's previous record low of 18 yen (13 cents) was recorded on
Sept. 18.
	   Teikoku Data Bank Ltd., a Tokyo-based credit research firm, said
Japan Leasing is estimated to have debts exceeding 2.44 trillion
yen (dlrs 18.24 billion), making it Japan's largest corporate
bankruptcy.
	   LTCB, one of Japan's largest banks, has been unable to shake off
speculation it may collapse under the weight of failed real estate
loans.
	   The broader Tokyo Stock Price Index of all issues listed on the
first section was up 12.06 yen, or 1.15 percent, to 1,061.99. On
Friday, the TOPIX closed down 28.08, or 2.6 percent.
	   In currency trading, the U.S. dollar remained higher against the
yen Monday morning from late Friday in Tokyo. But unexpected gains
in Tokyo stocks caused the U.S. currency to tumble from its levels
earlier in the session.
	   The dollar bought 135.56 yen at 11 a.m. (0200 GMT), up 0,92 yen
from late Friday in Tokyo, but below its late New York level of
136.25 yen Friday.
	   The dollar had surged 2.10 yen to 136.74 yen in early trading.
	   Traders attributed the dollar's slide to the rise on the Tokyo
Stock Exchange despite the failure of Japan Leasing Corp.
	   Meanwhile, the yield on the benchmark No. 182 10-year Japanese
government bond rose to 0.825 percent from Friday's finish of 0.815
percent, driving its price down to 108.77 yen from 108.87 yen.

Anwar's supporters vow to continue protests
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By ALVIN UNG &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia (AP) _ After three straight days of
protest, the capital appeared calm Monday, a national holiday,
despite vows by supporters of ousted Deputy Prime Minister Anwar
Ibrahim to continue gathering.
	   Opposition to Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad's decision to fire
and arrest Anwar, his former deputy and heir apparent, has sparked
a series of protests along the side-streets in downtown Kuala
Lumpur.
	   Police batons, tear gas and water cannons and more than 150
arrests have failed to discourage protesters who have been swarming
the streets to express their solidarity with Anwar.
	   After police blocked cars from entering a poorly-lit village
road leading to a rally, more than 10,000 supporters trudged for
several kilometers (miles) to attend a Sunday gathering organized
by Malaysia's opposition Islamic party.
	   Although authorities have banned all public meetings, police
allowed the meeting at the headquarters of the Parti Islam
Se-Malaysia, or PAS, to be held on condition that it would end by
midnight.
	   The rally was held just hours after the planned launch of a
coalition of opposition parties and non-governmental groups
promoting political reform was canceled due to police pressure.
	   The organizers of The Coalition for People's Democracy said the
launch had to be called off because the hotel where the event was
to be held was pressured by police not to allow use of its hall by
activists.
	   Former deputy leader Anwar and 16 of his associates have been
held under a harsh security law which allows indefinite
imprisonment without trial. Neither Anwar, arrested last Sunday,
nor any of his detained allies have been formally arraigned in a
court of law.
	   Anwar stands accused of crimes that include unlawful sex acts
and leaking state secrets. He has denied the charges, however,
saying they were politically motivated.
	   Anwar supporters have called for followers to flock to downtown
Kuala Lumpur's Merdeka _ or Independence _ Square, which on
Saturday was cordoned off by riot police.
	   City hall authorities said that the lush green park, a popular
tourist attraction, would be closed for a week, ostensibly for
maintenance.
	   Meanwhile, another unidentified group, also claiming to support
Anwar's cause, warned that if their deposed leader wasn't released
by the weekend, they would blow up two buildings in the capital on
Tuesday.
	   ``If the authorities don't heed our demands, we advise the
public to steer clear of those places,'' said the one-page document
posted on the Internet.
	   The deadline has since passed. Police have yet to issued any
public statement on the matter.
	   On Saturday, police beat demonstrators and used a water cannon
to disperse a rally of more than 3,000 people. Twenty-nine
Malaysians were arrested for gathering illegally, police said.
	   Even small public gatherings and outdoor assemblies in Malaysia
require police permits.

state began massive shutdowns Monday as businesses and 1.4 million
consumers are without natural gas after a series of explosions and
a two-day fire crippled an Esso refinery.
	   Up to 100,000 workers may be sent home in the coming days, The
Age newspaper cited industry sources as saying, and the gas cutoff
could last a week.
	   Hundreds of thousands of state residents are taking cold
showers, and are looking for electric griddles and fry pans to cook
their food. Many restaurants said they plan to close until the
weekend due to the gas shortage.
	   Victoria's largest crematorium has had to suspend cremations
until he crisis is resolved.
	   Car manufacturers Ford and Toyota have already announced
shutdowns, totaling 4,600 workers Monday. Another 3,000 workers
could be affected Tuesday.
	   Australian Industry Group director David Whiting said the range
of industries hit was massive, from car makers, breweries and dairy
and meat producers to small companies using heat to make ceramics,
office equipment or cement. There are about 100,000 businesses in
the state.
	   ``It is too early to put any real price on it, but we are
talking hundreds of millions'' of dollars in losses, Whiting said.
	   Law firm Slater and Gordon is considering what it says could be
the largest class action in Australian legal history, joining every
Victorian gas consumer in suing the gas provider and supplier.
	   Another firm, Maurice Blackburn and Co., will decide Monday if
it will take legal action on behalf of hospitality and union
clients.
	   At least five explosions and several fires ripped through Esso's
Longford gas plant near Sale about 110 miles (180 km) east of
Melbourne, on Friday, killing two men and injuring eight, one
critically.
	   The blaze was extinguished Sunday, but not before it had
extensively damaged the 29-year-old plant and some systems and
piping. The plant had supplied some 80 percent of Victoria's gas.
	   About 1 million Victorian residents, facing fines of 500
Australian dollars (U.S. dlrs 290), were forced to turn off their
gas meters Saturday after the state's supply authority, VENCorp.,
ordered the shutdown of the state's system.
	   Esso chairman and managing director Robert Olsen said experts,
including 12 from overseas, would try to get the plant running to
restore gas supplies.
	   He said it was a coincidence the plant had caught fire so soon
after production was halted by an ice plug in June and rejected
union suggestions maintenance standards had been lax.
	   The explosion and shutdown mark the third major infrastructure
collapse this year in this part of the world.
	   Auckland, New Zealand's central business district was blacked
out and suffered electricity shortages for some six weeks earlier
this year.
	   And Sydney, Australia's largest city, has just gone through a
series of drinking-water alerts after dangerous parasites were
found in high numbers in the water system.
	   Victoria state Premier Jeff Kennett raised the possibility of a
judicial inquiry into what caused the explosion, and was waiting
for a report from Esso due Monday.
	   ``This is going to effect this state dramatically for at least a
week,'' he said.

Former navy officer takes five women hostage at gunpoint
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
	   BANGKOK, Thailand (AP) _ A former Thai navy officer with a
history of mental illness took five female colleagues, two of them
pregnant, hostage for 15 hours before attempting suicide, a police
officer said Monday.
	   Panthep Laisri, 36, a driver of a garbage collecting company in
the northern city of Chiang Mai, 580 kilometers (360 miles) north
of Bangkok, forced his co-workers to stay in a room with him for no
apparent reason, the officer said.
	   The standoff lasted from midday Saturday until early Sunday
morning, when Panthep tried to take his own life by shooting
himself in the neck.
	   The former navy warrant officer is being treated by physicians
under tight police security. He is in stable condition and being
question by police over the illegal firearm he carried, said the
officer who spoke on condition of anonymity.
	   Panthep did not make any demands during the standoff, said the
officer.
	   Unless he is diagnosed as mentally ill, he will be charged with
unlawful detention, carrying a gun without a permit and carrying a
weapon in a public place, the officer said.
	   He was described by one of the hostages as a ``good man'' who at
times talked ``incoherently,'' The Nation newspaper reported
Monday.
	   Panthep's wife told the investigating officer that he appeared
to be under emotional stress a few days before the hostage taking,
said the officer.

	   WASHINGTON (AP) _ D.C. United beat the Columbus Crew 3-2 in a
shootout, but the two-time defending Major League Soccer champions
may have lost two starters for Wednesday's playoff opener.
	   Eastern Conference champion United (24-8) lost forward Jaime
Moreno to a severely bruised left shoulder and midfielder Tony
Sanneh to a strained right groin in the win Sunday that wrapped up
the regular season.
	   The status of Sanneh and Moreno was uncertain for United's
opener against the Miami Fusion in the best-of-3 series.
	   Conference runner-up Columbus, which closed the season with a
five-game losing streak, (15-17) got two goals from the
league-leading scorer Stern John and a scare when midfielder Brian
Maisonneuve left with a sprained right ankle.
	   Maisonneuve, who underwent surgery on the same ankle in July,
was probable for the Crew's series against the New York/New Jersey
MetroStars.
	   ``In any big game we need Brian Maisonneuve on the field,'' Crew
coach Tom Fitzgerald said.
	   Sanneh, who underwent abdominal and groin surgery in June, said
he wouldn't be 100 percent Wednesday but hoped he could play.
	   Moreno, one of the top scorers in the league with 16 goals, was
scheduled for X-rays Monday. He was injured after a collision with
Crew defender Thomas Dooley in the 35th minute.
	   ``It was a tough tackle that brought him down,'' United coach
Bruce Arena said.
	   Sanneh was hurt in the 10th minute and Maisonneuve left in the
24th minute. Both players had returned to their teams starting
lineups Sept. 19 after lengthy layoffs.
	   The Crew went ahead on John's 25th and 26th goals of the season,
in the 10th and 15th minutes.
	   United tied the game on A.J. Wood's goal in the 42nd minute and
on an own goal by Columbus midfielder Rob Smith in the 70th minute.
	   United got scores from Wood, John Harkes and Roy Lassiter in the
shootout. Brian West and John scored for the Crew, but Andy
Williams shot wide left and United keeper Tom Presthus stopped
Ansil Elcock in the final two rounds.
 &UR; Clash 2, Wizards 0
	   In San Jose, California, David Kramer recorded his third
consecutive shutout as the San Jose Clash ended their season with a
2-0 win over the Kansas City Wizards Sunday.
	   Braeden Cloutier and Oscar Draguicevich each scored for the
Clash (13-19), who moved ahead of the Wizards (12-20) for fifth
place in the Western Conference. San Jose had been in last place
since July 1.
	   Kramer's streak of 341 scoreless minutes was the longest streak
in Major League Soccer this year, 73 minutes shy of the record of
414 scoreless minutes by the MetroStars' Tony Meola in 1996.
	   Kansas City, which won the Western Conference's regular season
title last year, finished the season with a 2-14 road record.
 &UR; Mutiny 3, Fusion 1
	   In Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Frank Yallop's first Major League
Soccer goal was the game-winner Sunday as the Tampa Bay Mutiny beat
the Miami Fusion 3-1 in the regular season finale for both teams.
	   Yallop scored on a shot from 18 yards in the 54th minute after
taking a pass from Alan Prampin. The goal came in Yallop's 88th
league game, breaking a 7,520-minute scoreless drought.
	   Tampa Bay ended the season 12-20 with 34 points to finish fifth
in the Eastern Conference. The Mutiny, which also got goals from
Paul Dougherty and Mauricio Ramos, failed to make the playoffs for
the first time in three seasons.
	   Miami, which clinched a playoff berth a week ago, dropped to
15-17 with 35 points, finishing fourth.
	   Fusion coach Ivo Wortmann rested six starters, including leading
scorer Diego Serna and goalkeeper Jeff Cassar.
	   On Wednesday, Miami begins a best-of-3 playoff series at
two-time MLS champion D.C. United.
	   The Fusion took a 1-0 lead on Paulinho McLaren's goal in the
19th minute. The Mutiny tied it in the 32nd minute when Dougherty
beat goalkeeper Scott Budnick, after a give-and-go with midfielder
Dominic Kinnear. Yallop's goal gave Tampa Bay 2-1 lead.
	   Ramos scored the final goal with four minutes left.

Labor says business support for new tax is good reason to oppose it
</HEADLINE>
 &UR; By PETER JAMES SPIELMANN &QC; 
 &UR; Associated Press Writer &QC; 

<TEXT>
	   SYDNEY, Australia (AP) _ Prime Minister John Howard appealed
Monday for the business vote in next Saturday's election, as Labor
leader Kim Beazley said big business' support of Howard's new 10
percent tax was a good reason to be suspicious of it.
	   Howard rejected claims in Labor TV advertisements that the price
of many items would rise by 10 percent under the new goods and
services tax he proposes to introduce, as many wholesale taxes
would be abolished.
	   To sweeten the new tax, Howard has linked it with reductions of
personal income taxes of Australian dollars 13 billion (U.S. dlrs
7.5 billion) for some 80 percent of taxpayers, to be funded from
projected future federal budget surpluses.
	   He also reminded business that the 10 percent tax paid on inputs
could be claimed back.
	   ``All the tax that businessmen and women pay on the things they
need to run their business, they will be able to claim back,''
Howard told a radio station.
	   Howard and his governing conservative coalition got a boost from
big business last week when he was endorsed by Kerry Packer, the
media mogul who is Australia's richest man and owns Channel 9 TV.
	   Beazley retorted Monday that big business support for the
government's proposed 10 percent goods and services tax should ring
alarm bells among consumers.
	   Beazley said there was no doubt this election was a dividing
line on the question of the introduction of a goods and services
tax, saying if Labor won there would never be such a tax.
	   He said if the government won and put in place a goods and
services tax, the evidence from all other countries with a
consumption tax showed it would be in place forever.
	   ``There are a lot of people in big business supporting the
government on a goods and services tax,'' Beazley told a Sydney
radio station, referring to Packer's support for a second term for
Howard's government.
	   ``There is an argument that the big business organizations have
got together behind the government on that,'' he said.
	   Beazley has also proposed tax cuts aimed more at the Labor
Party's blue-collar, working class constituency.
	   The campaign has mainly focused on issues of tax reform and
economic management, the so called ``hip-pocket nerve'' issues that
catch the attention of budget-conscious Australians.
	   A cartoon published earlier in the campaign showed a confused
voter saying he was about to call up his accountant to decide who
he should vote for.
	   Virtually ignored are issues of Aboriginal health, welfare and
poverty; whether Australia should sever its links with the British
monarchy and become a republic; and any other broader social or
environmental issues.
	   Labor is campaigning on promises to reduce unemployment and
retain government-owned utilities such as telecommunications giant
Telstra Corp., which Howard has said he will privatize.
	   Howard's ruling Liberal-National coalition trailed the
opposition Labor Party in opinion polls last week.
	   If those results are repeated on election day, Labor would win
the 27 electoral seats it needs for a majority in the House of
Representatives and to form government.
	   A Quadrant opinion poll reported in The Sunday Telegraph
newspaper showed the election result will be very close with Labor
and the coalition running level. It showed either major party might
need to rely on the support of independent members to gain a
majority in the 148-member House of Representatives.
	   Labor needs a 4 percent swing toward it in total votes to win
the seats it needs for a majority.

Hurricane relief operation gains steam in Dominican Republic

	   SANTO DOMINGO, Dominican Republic (AP) _ Inside a squalid,
overcrowded disaster shelter on Santo Domingo's northside, refugees
from Hurricane Georges seethed over life's latest indignity: the
food.
	   Stabbing a fork into a cold, soggy bowl of rice mixed with
tomato sauce, Juanito Montero thrust the foul concoction in a
reporter's face. ``They're not giving us anything!'' shouted the
27-year-old father of two, whose zinc and plywood house was washed
away by floods.
	   Naked children played inside the darkened San Vicente church,
home for the past week to 500 storm victims. Others lay languidly
on the cement floor, not seeming to notice a humanitarian visit
Sunday by a group of U.S. congressmen.
	   ``It's a heartbreaking situation for everyone,'' said
Representative Elton Gallegly, a California Republican. ``To call
it pathetic would be a gross understatement.''
	   Now, finally, help is on the way. The U.S. relief effort for the
Dominican Republic was gaining momentum, ferrying in tons of
bottled water and plastic tarps for thousands of struggling storm
victims.
