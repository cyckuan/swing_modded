PARIS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Frenchman Luc Leblanc won a
dramatic seventh stage of the Tour de France in the Alps on
Saturday to allow Russian Yevgeny Berzin to seize the race
leader's yellow jersey.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Tour Improves Understanding, Promotes Friendship </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
today ended a successful and fruitful six-nation European and
Asian tour, which has deepened mutual understanding and trust and
strongly advanced the development of friendly, cooperative
relations between China and the six countries.
</P>
<P>
During his two-week trip, Jiang made his first visits as
Chinese president to Spain, Norway, Romania, Uzbekistan,
Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.
</P>
<P>
Jiang held in-depth, frank and friendly talks with leaders of
the six countries and reached extensive consensus on the further
development of bilateral cooperative relations.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese president signed separate joint communiques with
the heads of state of Romania, Uzbekistan, Kyrgyzstan and Kazakhstan.
China and Kyrgyzstan also signed a border demarcation accord.
</P>
<P>
Altogether, China signed some 30 documents, 18 of them with
the three central Asian nations.
</P>
<P>
In Kazakhstan, Jiang gave a speech, "Working Together Toward a
Better Future of Friendship and Cooperation between China and
Central Asia."
</P>
<P>
China attaches great importance to developing friendship and
cooperation with Spain and Norway in spite of differences in
history, tradition, culture, values and development. They share
the same or similar stances on major international issues and
there are no fundamental conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
Spain and Norway also value cooperation with China.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of all three countries are committed to further
developing friendly cooperation into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
The leaders shared the view of "mutual respect, equality,
mutual benefit and seeking common ground while reserving
differences."
</P>
<P>
Both European countries and China wish to maintain high-level
contacts and enhance political dialogue and economic and trade
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Complementary economic characteristics indicate there is great
potential for cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Spain, as a member of the European Union, supports China's bid
to join the World Trade Organization. The Spanish government also
intends to actively encourage investment across China, from the
coastal areas to the inland western regions.
</P>
<P>
Romania, an important nation in central Europe, has chosen a
different development path and different social system from
China. Even so, bilateral relations have been progressing
smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Jiang's visit to Romania indicates again that no matter how the
world changes, the friendship between the two countries and the
two peoples, a common desire of Chinese and Romanian leaders, is
long-lasting.
</P>
<P>
At their meeting in Bucharest on July 1, President Jiang and
his Romanian counterpart Ion Iliescu agreed that Sino-Romanian
friendship, which has endured numerous tests over time, is
something to be valued by the two peoples.
</P>
<P>
China notes that the government, citizens, the ruling party and
other parties in Romania are all committed to developing friendly
relations with China. Both leaders said bilateral trade should
increase through mutual efforts and according to the strength of
their respective economies.
</P>
<P>
Uzbekistan is China's next-door neighbor. Kyrgyzstan and
Kazakhstan share common borders with China. Since China
established diplomatic relations with these three newly
independent central Asian republics, bilateral relations have
developed steadily and healthily.
</P>
<P>
During Jiang's brief, but effective and fruitful visit, leaders
of the three central Asian countries reiterated their desire to
strengthen political ties with China.
</P>
<P>
Talks between Jiang Zemin and leaders of the three countries
show that along with the progress of friendly cooperation, they
have more and more interests in common and their stance on many
major issues has become closer.
</P>
<P>
In his address to the Kazak parliament on July 5, Jiang voiced
China's sincere wish to peacefully co-exist with central Asian
nations. He was warmly applauded when he said China hoped to be
"good neighbors, good friends and good partners" with central
Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
During Jiang's visit to Kyrgyzstan, the fifth leg of his
six-nation tour, heads of state of the two countries signed an
agreement on the demarcation of their common border, which extends
for more than 1,000 kilometers.
</P>
<P>
The signing of the agreement is proof of the good-neighborly
and friendly relations between the two countries. The agreement is
another important step forward in promoting regional peace and
stability following Sino-Russian, Sino-Kazak border demarcation
agreements and the accord on building military trust in border
areas between China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan
signed in Shanghai in April.
</P>
<P>
All six nations attached great importance to President Jiang's
visit. Media commentators said the visit will lay a sound
foundation for China to set up friendly and cooperative relations
with these countries into the 21st century.

<HEADLINE> Iraq, Syria Coordinate Stand on Water Distribution </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 6 (Xinhua) -- A Syrian official has said his
current talks held here with Iraqi officials aimed at coordinating
Syrian-Iraqi stances on the division of water of the two rivers
Tigris and Euphrates between Turkey, Syria and Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Muneed al-Rifa'i, head of the Syrian water experts
committee, said in a statement to Iraq's daily al-Jumhuriya
published today that during his talks with Iraqi officials in the
joint technical committee the two sides discussed the
implementation of the accord signed by Iraq and Turkey in 1980 and
later by Syria in 1983.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official, who arrived here Tuesday, said that the
meetings aimed at laying down the technical and legal bases to
delineate the joint international waters of Tigris and
Euphrates.
</P>
<P>
Rifa'i accused Turkey, where the two rivers originate, of
violating the international law by building several dams on the
Euphrates to make it a fait accompli for Syria and Iraq before
reaching an agreement.
</P>
<P>
He said that there are no differences between Syria and Iraq on
the sharing of waters. Under an agreement on water sharing reached
by the technical committee, Iraq will take 58 percent of the water
while Syria will have the remaining 42 percent coming from Turkey
on the Turkish-Syrian border, he added.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian official called on Turkey to give this issue proper
attention and speed up the finalization of the technical
committee's work.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Syria have no diplomatic relations but the two Arab
countries have been holding periodical meetings in order to
coordinate their stands on the water distribution with Turkey
which has declined to attend the committee's periodical meetings
since 1994.
</P>
<P>
Rifa'i talks with Iraqi officials here are scheduled to end
Sunday.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Serb Commander Lodges Protest to NATO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb army commander
Ratko Mladic has accused the NATO-led peace Implementation Force
(IFOR) of committing an "unacceptable act of violence" towards
senior Serb army officers, Tanjug news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Mladic addressed a protest to NATO Supreme Commander in Europe
Gen. George Joulwan and Commander of IFOR ground forces Michael
Walker late Friday after Serb army Lt.-Gen. Manojlo Milovanovic
and commander of the Serb army Herzegovina Corps Major General
Radovan Grubac were prevented from visiting Kalinovik, a Serb town
near Sarajevo.
</P>
<P>
"On July 3, IFOR troops stopped the two officers and disarmed
the soldiers accompanying them on the bridge on the Drina river in
the town of Brod Na Drini near Srbinja in eastern Bosnia," Gen.
Mladic said in his protest. The action was brutally carried out by
about 70 to 80 IFOR troops and nine armored vehicles, he added.
</P>
<P>
IFOR troops returned the weapons to the Serb soldiers only when
local population spontaneously rallied and demanded the weapons be
handed back, the Serb commander said.
</P>
<P>
He urged IFOR to apologize for the incident and to end the
self-will of IFOR towards Serb soldiers and citizens, and demanded
a redeployment of the units held responsible for the incident,
Tanjug said.

YAOUNDE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- "A friend in need is a friend
indeed. And China is such a friend to us." This was said by
Rwandan Foreign Minister Anastase Gasana today in an interview
with Xinhua here.
</P>
<P>

satisfied" with his talks with Chinese President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> OAU Urged to Spearhead Somalia Peace Efforts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopia has requested the
Organization of African Unity (OAU) to spearhead efforts to bring
about peace and reconciliation in war-torn Somalia.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency today, the request was
made by Foreign Minister Seyoum Mesfin when he told the meeting
of African foreign ministers in Yaounde, Cameroon in preparations
for the OAU summit scheduled on July 8-10.
</P>
<P>
The minister was quoted as complaining that unending war for
power among Somalia's political faction leaders has reduced the
people of the Horn of African state to abject poverty and put
humanitarian and security situation under greater threat.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that an OAU team dispatched to Somalia to find
solution to its crisis was met with resistance from some faction
leaders aborting its mission.
</P>
<P>
He requested that the OAU should send a team immediately to
Somalia to prepare conditions for discussions between the African
organization on the one hand and Somali faction leaders and its
people on the other.
</P>
<P>
The Inter-Governmental Authority on Development (IGAD) of
Eastern African countries could play a significant role in
bringing about lasting peace in Somalia, the Ethiopian minister
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the OAU and the international community to support
the IGAD in its endeavors.

<HEADLINE> French President Starts State Visit to Saudi Arabia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, July 6 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
arrived at the Saudi Arabian western port city of Jeddah today
starting a two-day state visit to the kingdom to lay the
foundations of a new partnership between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said he received a red-carpet welcome when
Chirac arrived at the airport at 5 p.m. (14:00 GMT).
</P>
<P>
The French president's visit has political goals rather than
commercial reasons due to the strategic importance France attaches
to its ties with the kingdom and the context of events in the
Gulf and Middle East region, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
The visit was presented as one of "friendship and respect" that
marks the mutual desire of the two countries to develop their
cooperation and deepen their dialogue in all domains.
</P>
<P>
He is attending an official banquet held in his honor by Saudi
Arabian King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz this evening at Al-Salam Palace
in Jeddah.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, the French president is expected to hold
talks with Saudi leaders on means of consolidating the strategic
relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Chirac is also expected to explain to the Saudi leaders his
efforts to launch the new "Arab policy" of France, which he
announced in a speech at Cairo, Egypt, in April.
</P>
<P>
Besides, discussions will be held to tackle a number of
regional issues such as the situation in the Gulf, relations with
Iraq and Iran, the Middle East peace process and developments in
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
France and Saudi Arabia established relations of friendship 30
years ago by late Saudi King Faisal Ibn Abdul-Aziz and late French
President General Charles De Gaulle.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is considered by France as a "major partner"
because of its geographic position, its influence in the Arab and
Moslem worlds and the role it plays at the regional level.
</P>
<P>
France's position in the Saudi market ranks sixth after the
U.S. Japan, Germany, Britain and Italy. The French exports to the
kingdom slipped to 1.26 billion U.S. dollars in 1995 from 1.4
billion dollars in 1994.
</P>
<P>
However, France buys one quarter of its oil from Saud Arabia
and is Riyadh's third biggest arms supplier after the United State
and Britain.
</P>
<P>
No commercial contract will be signed between the two
countries during Chirac's visit, according to the reports.
</P>
<P>
President Chirac is accompanied by his Defense Minister
Charles Millon, Foreign Minister Herve de Charette, Interior
Minister Jean-Louis Debre and Industry Minister Frank Borotra.
</P>
<P>
This is his second Middle East tour this year which will also
take him to Qatar following his visit to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
Chirac visited Lebanon and Egypt in April, declaring in a
speech in Cairo that he wanted to revive France's "Arab Policy"
and build a bridge from Europe to the southern and eastern shore
of the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
It is understood that he will start his third Middle East tour
this fall, which is expected to take him to Israel, the
Palestinians, Lebanon and Syria.

<P>
BELGRADE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The Bosnian Serb air force
commander asked the NATO-led peace Implementation Force (IFOR) in
Bosnia to allow Serb planes to fly over its entire territory, not
just the west part of it.
</P>
<P>
The commander, Vice-Marshall Zivomir Ninkovic, made the request
at a meeting today with the IFOR commander for Sector Southwest,
British General John Kisley in Banja Luka, the largest Serb city
in northwestern Bosnia, according to Tanjug news agency.
</P>
<P>
Under the Dayton agreement, Bosnian Serb entity Republika
Srpska is divided into two parts -- the northwestern part and
eastern part, and is linked by a narrow corridor in northeastern
Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Ninkovic told reporters after the meeting that the ban on
flights over the entire territory of Republika Srpska was a
flagrant violation of the Dayton accord.
</P>
<P>
He said that he had sought Kisley's understanding of the
request but had not got positive answer from Kisley.

"I hope Kisley will try to do something about it," he added.

ATHENS, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Inflation rate in Greece dropped to
8.8 percent on a year-on-year basis at the end of June from 9.1 in
May, the National Statistics Service has announced.

which had seen the annual inflation rate rising from 8.1 percent

<HEADLINE> Mandela Extends Hand of Peace to Rival IFP </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 6 (Xinhua) -- President Nelson Mandela
today extended a hand of peace and cooperation to the Inkatha
Freedom Party (IFP) and Minority Front in Kwazulu/Natal following
last week's elections in the province.
</P>
<P>
Addressing thousands of African National Congress (ANC)
supporters at a post-election rally in Clermont outside Durban,
Mandela said he hoped the "outstanding achievements" of both the
ANC and IFP will foster political cooperation in Kwazulu/Natal.
</P>
<P>
No political party could claim to be representative of any
ethnic group, he noted.
</P>
<P>
Official election figures released this week showed although
the IFP won most votes, especially in rural areas, they lost
support in the predominantly ANC-supporting urban areas.
</P>
<P>
"There is no time for petty politicking. The people of this
province have spoken and they want change," said the president.
</P>
<P>
By publicly congratulating the IFP for winning most rural
votes in the election, Mandela said new impetus to peace efforts
in Kwazulu/Natal, where politically-motivated violence has
claimed tens of thousands of lives since mid-1980s.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said: "The ANC, although we have many differences with
the IFP and also with the minority front, will try to find ways
to cooperate with these parties because their supporters come
primarily from those communities who have been so brutally
oppressed by the previous apartheid regime."
</P>
<P>
The president's conciliatory speech was warmly applauded by
the large crowd.
</P>
<P>
Mandela also extended a hand of peace and cooperation to the
Democratic Party and the National Party, hoping them to "join
hands to build this province into a home of our dreams."

Mubarak, who narrowly escaped an assassination attempt last year

<P>
ATLANTA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The president of the United States
Olympic Committee has suggested to put the Paralympics ahead of
the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
LeRoy Walker said he'll submit his proposal when the executive
board of the International Olympic Committee meets in Atlanta this
week.
</P>
<P>
"I think (the Paralympics) deserves to have its day in the
sun," he said.
</P>
<P>
Walker added his proposal would draw more spectators to the
Games featuring the disabled and give organizers a chance to test
venues prior to the Olympics.
</P>
<P>
Paralympic officials said the idea has both benefits and
drawbacks.
</P>
<P>
Andy Flemming, president of the Atlanta Paralympics Organizing
Committee, said the concept of going first would work only if
Olympic organizers built early deadlines into construction plans
so Paralympic athletes weren't arriving to find unfinished venues.
</P>
<P>
"It could have enormous benefits if plaling allowed for it," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Walker may have to convince IOC members that those benefits
aren't just for the Paralympics.
</P>
<P>
"My loyalty in all this is to the Olympics," said Dick Pound,
an IOC executive board member from Canada. "If it would add to the
value of the Olympics, I'd be in favor of it. If not, I'd be
against it."

<HEADLINE> Pakistan's Trade Deficit Expected to Improve in 196-97 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A trade deficit of 2.1 billion US
dollars is projected for Pakistan's current 1996-97 fiscal year as
against 2.8 billion US dollars in 1995-96, a senior official said
today.
</P>
<P>
Minister for Information and Broadcasting Khalid Kharal told
reporters that exports for 1996-97 are projected at 9.97 billion
US dollars on the payment basis.
</P>
<P>
The figure showed an estimated growth of 14.4 percent as
against 1995-96, Kharal said.
</P>
<P>
"This specific projection is mainly based on the assumption
that the next cotton crop will yield 10.8 million bales, with an
anticipated exportable surplus of 1.8 million bales," he said.
</P>
<P>
The projection is also based on the estimated 4.2 million tons
of the output of paddy crop which will then leave a sizable
surplus for export, he added.
</P>
<P>
The export estimates will also be reinforced by the 7.2 percent
estimated growth rate for the manufacturing sector, he said.
</P>
<P>
On import, Kharal said that during the current fiscal year,
imports are expected to increase by 5.1 percent with a projected
figure of 12.06 billion dollars on F.O.B basis.
</P>
<P>
The projected enhancement is based primarily on the assumption
that the general economic activities will gain momentum, he said.
</P>
<P>
The major imports will be wheat, fertilizers, edible oil, he
said, adding that the private sector imports will also be
increased.

</P>
<P>
An official from the company, based in Anshan City, said that

</P>
<P>
It also paid 842 million yuan in taxes to the treasury of the
central government during that period, up 191 percent from the
same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
It also exported 360,000 tons of rolled steel in the first five
months, a six percent increase over the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the company's success is due partly to
the introduction of a system of sales agents throughout the
country.

BAGHDAD, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraq and Syria have signed a joint
minute concerning prospects of coordination between the two
countries on sharing water resources of Tigris and Euphrates
rivers at a meeting concluded here today.
</P>
<P>
Iraqi senior official of the Irrigation Ministry Abdul Sattar

<HEADLINE> ICRC Operating in S.leone Urged To Stop Relief </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN,July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Sierra Leonean government has
asked the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) to stop
all relief flights to areas behind rebel lines in the far eastern
part of the country, a State House aide confirmed ssunday.
</P>
<P>
The aide who asked not to be identified, said the government
''has also ordered the ICRC to work in conjunction with the
Sierra Leone Red Cross in the distribution of releif supplies to
these areas.''
</P>
<P>
Western diplomats here said there has been a ''growing rift''
between the organisation and the government on the ICRC
operations behind rebel lines.
</P>
<P>
''The government has been consistently suspicious as to what
the ICRC is doing there. It beleives the organization can be
giving other support other than food to the rebels,'' one
European diplomat said.
</P>
<P>
Observers said the rift has been intensified after the upsurge
of rebel attacks particularly in the south and east of the
country in recent weeks. The observers are also linking the
recent grounding of a local domestic flight to the interior, the
Soruss, piloted by Russian pilots. Soruss is known to have been
hired by the ICRC to fly in relief items behind rebel lines. It
is owned by brother of the former military leader, Bjulius al
Bio.
</P>
<P>
A foreign affairs official said the government has accused the
ICRC of ''infringing national security'' but he declined to
elaborate.
</P>
<P>
Observers recalled that it was the ICRC which airlifted the
RUF Leader Foday Sankoh from his jungle hideout to the March
peace meeting in the Ivory Coast. Although the ICRC insists the
government had knowledge about the matter, government officials
dispute the statement.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the development, the ICRC Director Primo told a
local media that the ban will affect local relief supplies.
</P>
<P>
''I hope we will be able to resolve the matter quickly to
avoid causing distress to displaced people,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
Information Minister George Banda Thomas explained in an
interview that he government ''is not stopping the ICRC but
exercising its sovereign right.''
</P>
<P>
ICRC officials stressed that the organisation cannot operate
under the local red cross as the two organisations are seperate
bodies with different charters.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government owned Daily Mail in its Saturday
edition said the RUF plans a big operation to be called operation
destry all.
</P>
<P>
The paper in a front page article, did not say when the
operation will be launched but cited Damballa Town, 12 miles from
Bo in the south as the main base from which the attack will be
launched.
</P>
<P>
The revealation, the paper said, came from a letter sent to
the paper by the former RUF spokesman Alimamy Sankoh, who
defected from the organisation and is now living in Ghana.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Egypt to Keep Working for Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said
today that Egypt is committed to peace and will keep working for
it on the principle of "land for peace."
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of an offshore natural gas field in the
Mediterranean city of Port Fuad, Mubarak said that the principle
can not be changed.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli new government led by Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu has vowed not to return occupied Arab land, drawing
great concerns over the future of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Egypt, the first Arab state to make peace with Israel, has
played a role as a mediator in Arab-Israeli peace negotiations,
particularly on the Palestinian track.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak, however, said that premature measures should not be
taken to counter Israel's peace policy as it takes time to know
Netanyahu's real intentions.
</P>
<P>
"We should not precede matters and we should wait till we meet
with the Israeli premier and get to know his ideas," Mubarak was
quoted by Egypt's Middle East News Agency as saying.
</P>
<P>
"If he is keen on peace, we are more so, and we realize more
than anyone the consequences of failing to realize peace," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak is reportedly due to meet with Netanyahu in Cairo this
month after Netanyahu's visit to the United States, which started
Tuesday.

BAGHDAD, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed
Rashid stressed here today that the food distribution plan Iraq
presented to the U.N. will be fulfilled during the coming few
days.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference following the signing of a
cooperation protocol between Iraq and Ukraine, Rashid said that he
expected the arrival of many foreign delegations to conclude
agreements for purchasing Iraqi oil in accordance with the
memorandum of understanding signed between Iraq and the U.N. on
May 20.
</P>
<P>
Under the oil-for-food plan, Iraq is allowed to sell 2 billion
U.S. dollars worth of oil every six months to buy food, medicine
and other humanitarian supplies to help alleviate the sufferings
caused by the sanctions imposed on Iraq since its August 1990
invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has submitted to the U.N. a detailed food distribution
plan in accordance with the Iraq-U.N. oil deal. But the United
States has opposed the plan by accusing Iraq of trying to import
computers and spare parts for helicopters in violation of the
relevant U.N. resolution.
</P>
<P>
However, Iraq said it has consulted the international agencies
in Baghdad on the food distribution plan before it was presented
to the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
the computers are to be used in the registration process for
higher education and the spare parts are for the helicopters used
to combat pests in order to boost its agriculture sector, it
added.

SANYA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Twenty-eight Taiwan companies have
built 23 farms for crop growing, breeding livestock and
processing farm and side-line products in Sanya, Hainan Province.
</P>
<P>
Sanya, the southernmost city in China, is one of the country's
major producers of tropical melons, fruit and flowers.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan companies have invested 185 million yuan in the
farms with a total acreage of nearly 100 hectares, a local
official said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Taiwan companies have brought in fine species of
melon, fruit, flowers and livestock.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the steady flow of Taiwan investment is
due largely to preferential treatment offered to overseas
companies.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with city government regulations, Taiwan
investors in crop cultivation, livestock breeding, aquatic product
processing, and farm and sideline product processing can enjoy
preferential treatment in land purchase, taxation, financial

<HEADLINE> OAU Report on Africa's Refugee Situation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Guo Ming
</P>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Organisation of African Unity
(OAU) today urged for "voluntary and peaceful" repatriation of
refugees and displaced persons in Africa.
</P>
<P>
In a report on refugees, returnees and displaced persons in
Africa made available to Xinhua, the OAU, which is now organising
its forthcoming 32nd heads of state and government summit meeting
in Yaounde, Cameroon, is "very much concerned" over the
deteriorating refugee situation in the continent.
</P>
<P>
In 1964, there were only thousands of refugees in sub-Sarahan
Africa. In 1967, the number rose to 1 million. in 1979, it again
rose to 4 million. And today, Africa has 7 million refugees and
20 million displaced people, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
It advocated that a mechanism be established "to promote
mutual assistance, cooperation and trust between refugees and
local communities within the countries of asylum."
</P>
<P>
Refugee problems are increasingly changing into a source of
regional instability as conflict between the countries of asylum
and the countries of origin.
</P>
<P>
For example, Rwanda, which has one million refugees within
neighboring Zaire out of its largest refugee contingent of 1.7
million, is increasingly at odds with the latter over the
repatriation of refugees.
</P>
<P>
The refugee problem is also developing into a source of
dangerous internal unrest in Burundi.
</P>
<P>
In term of the scale of the refugee population, Rwanda is
followed by Sudan, with its refugee population of one million;
and Liberia, 740,000; Somali, 450,000; Eritrea, 370,000; Sierra
Leone, 340,000; Angola, 200,000; and Burundi, 20,000.
</P>
<P>
Among the African countries, Zaire shares the largest refugee
hosting burden, hosting around 1.6 million refugees. It is
followed by Guinea, hosting 650,000 refugees; and Tanzania,
630,000.
</P>
<P>
Sudan, Ethiopia, Cote D'ivoire, Uganda and Kenya all share
refugee hosting burdens.
</P>
<P>
The report said the OAU summit, scheduled for July 8-10, will
address this refugee issue.

<HEADLINE> Salim Calls for Donation to OAU Peace Fund </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Secretary General of the
Organisation of African Unity (OAU) Salim Ahmed Salim today
called for contributions to the OAU peace fund, one day before
the opening of the OAU summit meeting.
</P>
<P>
"I would like to appeal to all those who support the OAU peace
initiative to provide the peace fund with the required
resources," said Salim in a report submitted to the OAU summit
meeting scheduled to be held in Yaounde, Cameroon, from July
8-10.
</P>
<P>
The fund, created in 1993 following the set-up of the
mechanism on conflict prevention, management and resolution, is
aimed at backing exclusively operational activities relating to
conflict management and resolution.
</P>
<P>
It receives statutory annual contributions from the OAU
regular budget of amounting to not less than one million
U.S.Dollars every year, and voluntary contributions from all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
"I'm proud to tell you that since its inception, the OAU peace
fund has received over 12 million U.S.Dollars," said Salim,
adding that four million U.S.Dollars out of this amount have been
provided through the OAU regular budget.
</P>
<P>
The remaining eight million U.S. Dollars of volutary
contriutions have come mainly from outside Africa.
</P>
<P>
During his recent trip to Africa, Chinese President Jiang
Zemin contributed 10 million RMB Yuan (about 1.2 million
U.S.Dollars) to the peace fund.
</P>
<P>
"However, i wish to underline the fact that the voluntary
contributions from within Africa have not been forthcoming,"
stressed the OAU chief, adding the voluntary contributions from
donor countries and institutions from outside Africa have not
been provided on a regular basis to the fund.
</P>
<P>
"As a result, during the last few months, we have faced a
deficit in the account of the fund," he said.
</P>
<P>
The essential part of the contributions has gone to support
activities of the OAU observers mission in Burundi, he said.

<P>
SUZHOU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Workers digging a well at a famous
scenic spot in China netted an unusual fish which was happily
swimming almost 150 meters below ground.
</P>
<P>
The strange fish, 30 centimeters in length and five 5 cm wide,
was caught in Suzhou, a famous scenic city in east China's Jiangsu
Province.
</P>
<P>
Besides having gills, the yellowish-brown fish has an auxiliary
breathing organ, which enables it to live in environments with
insufficient oxygen.
</P>
<P>
Similar to the snakehead fish, deep well fish was particularly
lively while in water.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that the well, in which the fish was found,
might be linked with lakes or rivers where the fish had previously
been living.

NEW DELHI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- India's annual rate of inflation
declined for the third successive week, dropping to 4.22 percent
during the period ending June 22 as against 4.51 percent in the
previous week, the Press Trust of India said today.
</P>
<P>
The rate stood at 8.3 percent during the corresponding period
of the previous year. The latest decline has come about as a
result of lower prices of commodities such as coffee, fruits and
vegetables, and raw rubber.

This is the 21st week in succession that the inflation rate has
remained below five percent.

<P>
CAIRO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
today denied reports that a ministerial meeting between Egypt,
Syria and Iran would be held.
</P>
<P>
It had been reported that the three-way meeting would be held
in the Syrian capital of Damascus with the aim of restoring
Egyptian-Iranian relations.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said after opening the Port Fuad offshore natural gas
field that there was a proposal to hold the meeting but Egypt
turned it down because Iran is still mounting campaigns against
some countries including Egypt, the Egyptian Middle East News
Agency (MENA) reported.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Egypt and Iran have been strained for nearly
20 years. Egypt and a number of other Arab states accuse Iran of
supporting Moslem militants, who carry out terrorist attacks in an
attempt to undermine the governments of these Arab states.
</P>
<P>
Iran, which has denied the allegations, reportedly wants to
reconcile with Arab states including Egypt. Syria, which maintains
good relations with Iran, has called for improving Arab-Iranian
relations.
</P>
<P>
Iran severed ties with Egypt in 1979 after Cairo signed a peace
treaty with Israel.

<HEADLINE> Report: Chinese Firms to be Listed in Tokyo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Several Chinese companies will be
listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) by the year-end at the
earliest, a leading Japanese newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese and Chinese governments will agree on Chinese
firms' debut on the TSE by as early as the end of the month, the
Asahi Shimbun said in a report.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese Finance Ministry's Securities Bureau and the TSE
will exchange a memorandum on the listing of Chinese stocks with
the China Securities Regulatory Commission after the two
governments approve the move, the daily newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The anticipated listing of Chinese firms, which will enable
Japanese investors to freely buy or sell Chinese stocks, is
expected to promote investment in growing Chinese enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Several Chinese companies, including a pharmaceutical
manufacturer and an automaker, have been cited as candidates for
going public on the TSE, according to the paper.
</P>
<P>
A total of 26 Chinese companies have gone public in New York
and Hong Kong stock markets since 1993, when the Chinese
government began the listing of Chinese firms in overseas markets
in a bid to promote the privatization of state-run enterprises.
</P>
<P>
A number of foreign companies withdrew from the TSE in the wake
of the burst of the asset-inflated bubble economy in the late
1980s. This prompted the TSE to make efforts to lure rapidly
growing Asian companies by easing listing requirements.

</P>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Organisation of African Unity
(OAU) has voiced support to the Palestinian national authority
led by President Yassir Arafat and urged for progress of "land
for peace" initiative in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The three-day OAU council of ministers meeting, concluded here
in the mid-night on Saturday, passed two resolutions on the
Middle East and on the Palestinian problem.
</P>
<P>
According to the resolutions released by the OAU secretariate
today, the OAU expressed its full support for the Arab countries
"in their efforts to put an end to the Israeli occupation and
establish a comprehensive, just and lasting peace in the Middle
East."
</P>
<P>
The resolutions reaffirmed that the question of east Jerusalem
and Palestine are "at the center of the Arab-Israeli conflict and
that there can be no way to resolve the issue except that the
Israeli government returns east Jerusalem back to the Palestinian
national authority."
</P>
<P>
The Middle East peace process has been frozen by the latest
round of hostilities.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinian Foreign Minister F. Kadumi, who is now
in the Cameroonian capital of Yaounde attending the OAU ministrial
council meeting, told Xinhua in an interview that the
Palestinian people "have not got their peace dividends."
Economic situation in the west Jerusalem is "getting worse and
worse" because of the embargo imposed by the Israeli government,
he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Israeli government occupies the east Jerusalem and
controls the west Jerusalem," he added.
</P>
<P>
The OAU resolutions also urged for the resolution of the
problem of Palestinian refugees and displaced persons "on the
basis of the principles of human rights."

<HEADLINE> Jordan to Get WFP Fund for Food Production Scheme </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP) plans to
allocate 15 million U.S. dollars to help Jordan in its food
production program for the next five years starting in 1997.
</P>
<P>
According to today's Jordan Times, the kingdom's sole English
language daily, Jordanian Minister of Agriculture Mustafa
Sheneikat said upon his return from the WFP meetings in Rome,
where the organization is based, that final approval of the plan
is expected at a meeting of WFP donors scheduled for October when
a formal agreement is expected to be signed by the WFP and Jordan.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has been financing food production projects in the
kingdom since 1960s.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the organization will provide funds for
new projects to be initiated by the ministry in cooperation with
the U.N. Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), said the
minister.
</P>
<P>
The new projects include the development of the highlands
through fruit and forest tree cultivation, pasture land
development and domestic projects in the rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the WFP has also promised to help solve
problems connected with earlier highlands projects.
</P>
<P>
In the five-year projects in the highlands regions of the
kingdom, WFP financial aid was used to purchase foods for
Jordanian farmers while they work on developing their lands.
</P>
<P>
These projects were designed to help farmers increase their
production output and reduce soil erosion.
</P>
<P>
He said that FAO Director General Jacques Diouf, whom he met
during the meeting, promised to finance short-term training
programs for Jordanian personnel in boosting agricultural
production.
</P>
<P>
Diouf also pledged that the U.N. body will, in the coming
months, equip Jordan with a special laboratory for the analysis
of chemical residues in fruits and vegetables that will help
ensure safe produce for exports, according to the minister.

<HEADLINE> Islamic Court in Somalia Calls for War Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, July 7 (Xinhua)--As the heavy fighting continues in
the Somali capital Mogadishu, the Supreme Islamic Court in North
Mogadishu has called for an all out War against General Mohamed
Farah Aidid in Mogadishu and elsewhere in the country.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued by the court and broadcast on the radio
supporting Ali Mahdi Mohamed last night, the Islamic court has
legalized the fighting against General Aidid, describing it as
holy struggle against what is called " the armed bandits" led by
Gencral Aidid.
</P>
<P>
The Islamic court accused General Aidid for unrightfuly
attacking and besieging Medina district of southwest Mogadishu
inhabited by the clansmen of Ali Mahdi Mohamed.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a Spokesman for Ali Mahdi Mohamed, Hussein Sheikh
Ahmed Kadare declared a state of war in Mogadishu. The spokesman
said that their forces, which they described as the " peace
alliance " will not stop fighting unless they capture General
Aidid himself dead or alive, an exaggerated illusion similar to
that of the multi-intermational forces against General Aidid in
Somalia in 1993.
</P>
<P>
This call of war by Ali Mahdi and the Islamic court was
prompted By a simultaneous demonstrations held by the Abgal
clansmen in North Mogadishu who were calling for Ali Mahdi to
take a retaliatory action against General Aidid's advance in
Medina distrct in the past 36 hours.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, none of General Aidid's top lieutenants nor
his radio spoke about the heavy fighting in South Mogadishu and
along the green line. Local treatment centers have recorded 21
more deaths in addition to yesterday's 17 deaths, while the
wounded exceeded 100, mainly civilians.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people are fleeing the capital to the neighboring
districts and villages such as Afgoe, Lafole, Balad and the port
town of Merca, 100 Km South of Migadishu. The fleeing people
carried little of their possessions.
</P>
<P>
There's no peace negotiations going on at the moment between
the rival factions since every faction leader is determined to
get rid of his opponent, a dream which can hardly be realized.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Shows No Interest in Idea of Mideast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The new Israeli government has
shown no interest in advancing the plan of forming a Middle East
Bank, a symbol of the regional economic cooperation in an era of
peace.
</P>
<P>
The government led by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has not
sent signals to Washington expressing its support for the bank,
despite the fact that it was asked to express its view, The
Jerusalem Post said today.
</P>
<P>
Barring a last-minute push by Netanyahu during his visit to
Washington this week, U.S. congressional funding for the bank is
liable to be eliminated.
</P>
<P>
The bank was not part of the U.S. House of Representatives
foreign aid legislation, and the Senate Appropriations Committee
did not include it in the 12.15 billion U.S. dollars foreign aid
bill, which is expected to reach the floor within the next two
weeks.
</P>
<P>
The formation of the bank was the centerpiece of the
U.S.-backed Amman economic summit of the Middle East and North
African Countries last fall and has been at the heart of former
Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres's vision of a "New Middle
East."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. had originally agreed to provide more than 260
million dollars, or 21 percent, of the bank's start-up capital
over five years. The money was to finance infrastructure projects
in Egypt, Jordan and the Palestinian autonomous areas.
</P>
<P>
Peres had lobbied strenuously on behalf of the bank, and by
getting Arab countries to endorse the notion, he called for the
U.S. government to support the endeavor.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Government Pledges Support for Local </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALLAAM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government on
Saturday renewed its pledge to support local industries' efforts
to make more contribution to the economy.
</P>
<P>
Opening the Confederation of Tanzania Industries (CTI) annual
general meeting here,Tanzanian Industries and Trade Minister
Abdallah Kigoda said the manufacturing sector's contribution to
Gross Demestic Product (GDP) was far below expectation.
The contribution made by the manufacturing sector
accounts for 9.9 percent of the GDP between 1975 and 1981, but it
went down to 8.1 percent between 1991 and 1994, he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the Tanzanian government had set a target
for the sector's contribution to the GDP at 18 percent under the
Basic Industrial Strategy (BIS) launched last year.
</P>
<P>
Kigoda has singled some of the major constraints facing the
manufacturing sector as underdeveloped infrastructure,inadequate
promotion of local entrepreneurs, lack of experienced managerial
and technical capacity.
</P>
<P>
"Co-operation between state and its organs and the private
sector is necessary to resolve such issues to the benefit of both
industries and the country in creating a proper base for a
sustainable industrial growth," he stressed.

<HEADLINE> African Peacekeeping Issue Undecided at OAU </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Guo Ming
</P>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The thorny issue of whether to set
up a permanent African peacekeeping force remained undecided as
the 64th council of ministers of the Organisation of African
Unity (OAU) ended late on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"It is very complex and will therefore be handed over to the
OAU summit," a delegate to the meeting said here today.
</P>
<P>
The issue emerged at the first-ever meeting of chiefs of staff
of the member states of the central organ of the OAU mechanism
for conflict prevention, management and resolution, held in June
in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
The deterioting sitution in Burundi led to call for stepping
up OAU's military involvement in the central African country
which, according to former Tanzanian President Nyerere who
shouldered the OAU mediating role, is "on the verge of a civil
war".
</P>
<P>
The needs from Africa's other hot spots such as Liberia,
Rwanda and Somalia, also propelled the idea.
</P>
<P>
However, limited financial sources has restricted the regional
body's large scale peacekeeping involvement while the preveiling
view holds that the peacekeeping obligation should continue to be
with the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Although an African peace fund, established in 1995, has so
far raised about 12 million U.S. Dollars, it still might not
satisfy the needs if a permament peacekeeping force is to be
maintained, While sharing of the financial, manpower and
political burdens among the OAU member states, is another
problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, options are open for OAU to carry out certain
limited operations, either political or military, in some
"exceptional circumstances", according to OAU Secretary General
Salim Ahmed Salim in his report submitted to the OAU summit
meeting scheduled for July 8-10.
</P>
<P>
"The need is still there, and will be there for a fairly long
period of time, for Africa to have its own peacekeeping
capability," said an observer to the three-day council of
ministers meeting.

<HEADLINE> OAU Statesd Adopt Identical Views on Debt Burden </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Guo Ming
</P>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Member states of the Organisation
of African Unity (OAU) have agreed to take a common position on
Africa's debt issue, said a resolution adopted by the ministerial
meeting which ended in the mid-night on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The resolution which was made available to Xinhua today, said
the ministers had decided to set up an OAU contact group to
coordinate among the member states over the debt issue.
</P>
<P>
Africa's outstanding foreign debt rose by 18 billion
U.S.Dollars to the historical high of 320 billion U.S.Dollars at
the end of 1995, accounting for 80 percent of the total Gross
Domestic Product (GDP) in the region.
</P>
<P>
That means if the debt burden is now shared equally among the
continent's estimated 680 million people, each African would have
to pay some 470 U.S.Dollars, an amount which outstrips average
per capita annual income in the continent.
</P>
<P>
And during the recent years, 30 percent of Africa's foreign
currency income was used to service its foreign debt annually.
</P>
<P>
"It will continue to be the most serious single bottleneck of
Africa's economic breakthrough until there is a lasting solution
to the problems of Africa's debt," said the OAU Secretary General
Salim Ahmed Salim.
</P>
<P>
The resolution also highlighted the need for effective
consultation, coordination and exchange of information and
experience in this aspect among the African countries.

<P>
NAIROBI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Kenya's tourism earnings recorded
a drop of four billion Kenya Shillings (some 70 million
U.S.Dollars) last year as a result of the negative publicity,

</P>
<P>
"The sector's earnings fell by around 11 percent, from 28
billion in 1994 to 24 billion last year. Arrivals fell by 20

<HEADLINE> OAU Ministers Coordinate Stances on Africa's Hot </HEADLINE>

</P>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- A set of resolutions have been
adopted by the 64th council of ministers meeting of the
Organisation of African Unity (OAU), which was concluded in the
mid-night on Saturday, on various "hot spots" in Africa.
</P>
<P>
These hot spots include Liberia, Sierra Leone, Rwanda, Burundi
and Somalia, according to the resolutions made available to
Xinhua here today.
</P>
<P>
The resolution on Liberia demands that ceasefire be maintained
and disarmament be stepped up among all the Liberian warring
factions by the end of July when west Africa's sub-regional body,
the ECOWAS, holds its 16-country summit meeting on Liberia.
</P>
<P>
It warns that negative developments will oblige the OAU to
seek permission from the United Nations Security Council to
impose severe sanctions on and to set up a war crime tribunal to
try leaders of Liberia's warring factions.
</P>
<P>
Liberia's peace process was seriously threatened by the recent
outbreak of heavy fighting in the capital Monrovia, posing doubt
whether general elections will be held in August 1996 to bring a
lasting peace to the country torn apart by over six years of
civil war.
</P>
<P>
The resolution on Sierra Leone "notes with satisfaction" over
the peace process marked by the ongoing negotiations between the
newly elected civil government and the rebel Revolutionary United
Front (RUF).
</P>
<P>
It commends the mediating roles played by the ECOWAS leaders
to make peace talks resumed following presidential elections and
the peaceful handing over by the Seirra Leonean military
government earlier this year.
</P>
<P>
The resolution on Rwanda appreciates the efforts made by the
government, including its power-sharing plan, to strive for
national reconciliation and to ensure an early repatriation of
its 1.7 million Hutu refugees.
</P>
<P>
It urges for confidence-building between the minority Tutsis
and the majority Hutus for national reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the resolution noted that Rwanda, with one million
refugees in Zaire out of its total refugee population of 1.7
million, is still at odds with the Zairean government which,
earlier this week, threatened the use of force to enforce the
repatriation process.
</P>
<P>
The resolution on Burundi agrees to continue OAU's mission in
Burundi to prevent further deterioration of the situation in the
country.
</P>
<P>
The Burundian authority has submitted to OAU its demand for a
six-month extention of the OAU observers mission in Burundi and
for its total strength to be raised from 60 to 118. The mission's
current mandate expires on July 15.
</P>
<P>
More than 100,000 people have been killed in Burundi since the
1993 assassination of its first freely-elected hutu president.
Burundi borders on Rwanda where up to one million Tutsis and Hutu
moderates were massacred in the 1994 genocide.
</P>
<P>
The resolution on Somalia urges all OAU member states and the
international community to desist from supplying war materials to
any of the factions in Somalia to avoid an escalation of the
crisis.
</P>
<P>
It urges Somali faction leaders to recognize the imperative
need to promote dialogue aimed at the establishment of a
broad-based national authority and the pursuance of national
reconciliation.

<HEADLINE> France to Turn Jordan's Debts into Investment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The French government has decided
to convert Jordan's commercial debt to France, which amounts to
325 million francs (65 million U.S. dollars), into foreign
investments in development projects in the Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
The 65-million-dollar debt is commercial credits granted by
French companies and guaranteed by the French government, and the
amount corresponds to 10 percent of debt ceiling in this category
as decided by the Paris Club, plus a part of the public aid to
development, according to a statement released released by the
French embassy here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting in June of 1994, the Paris Club accepted a
proposal on rescheduling the whole of the Jordanian debt to its
members.
</P>
<P>
The move came in direct response to a request by King Hussein
to French President Jacques Chirac during the king's visit to
Paris in May, 1996, the embassy statement said.
</P>
<P>
It added that the French leader had expressed his government's
readiness to help Jordan cope with its current economic
difficulties.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the French government decided on
the move during talks with a Jordanian delegation, led by  Deputy
Governor of the Central Bank of Jordan Michel Marto, which were
held in Paris on July 2.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, debts eligible to the planned operation
will  be sold by the French Treasury to international investors
wishing to invest in Jordan at a rate substantially inferior  to
its nominal value.

<HEADLINE> Some 3,000 Religious Radicals Riot In Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, July 7 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,000 religious
radicals clashed violently with several hundred policemen here
Thursday night against the backdrop of mounting tension between
religious and secular sectors of the society.
</P>
<P>
Haredi protesters began to converge on the Rehov Bar-Ilan in
Jerusalem late Saturday afternoon, throwing stones, bottles and
other items, including vegetables and dirty diapers, at police,
who tried to prevent them from blocking the street.
</P>
<P>
Police used water cannons to disperse the protesters, who
screamed "Nazi" at the policemen and "Shabbes" at passing
cars. The unrest, the worst demonstration on the site for some
time, continued until two hours after Shabbat.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen rioters were arrested while two policemen were
injured, one who was hit in the eye and the other in the arm.
</P>
<P>
The Bar-Ilan Street is a major artery in Jerusalem.
The surrounding areas are thickly inhabited by haredi people. In
the past decade and more, they have demanded that the street be
closed to traffic on Shabbat (Saturday) to no avail due
to strong opposition from the secular communities.
</P>
<P>
These demands have intensified since the May election of what
they believe is a government that has no choice but to close
Bar-Ilan.
</P>
<P>
On Friday, President Ezer Weizman telephoned Meretz Party
leader Yossi Sarid asking to call off the party's planned
demonstration on the street Saturday afternoon, so that he would
have a chance to work out a solution to the dispute over whether
the road should be closed on Shabot and other holidays.
</P>
<P>
The Meretz plan for activists to march up Bar-Ilan to
demand the road remain open was made possible by a ruling
Thursday by the High Court of Justice, which rejected police
opposition to the demonstration.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, Sarid immediately agreed to the appeal by
Weizman. the postponement was made public by noon Friday.
</P>
<P>
Haredi activists claimed that they took to the streets
because they did not believe Meretz would keep its promise
to the president. They also did not feel obliged by the call
from the president and Chief Rabbi Yisrael Lau for both Meretz
and Haredim to postpone their actions and try to work out
their differences in a peaceful manner.
</P>
<P>
The haredi leaders, including Jerusalem Deputy Mayor Haim
Miller, vowed Saturday night that their demands for the closure of
the road will continue.

<HEADLINE> Weihai to Become Major Port in Northern China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Second-phase construction of the
southern region of Weihai Port will start before the end of the
year.

<HEADLINE> News Analysis: Manila Restores Warm Relations with </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel Ramos
announced Saturday the lifting of the ban on the deployment of
maids to Singapore, a move that was seen as the last official act
to fully normalize relations between the two ASEAN neighbors.
</P>
<P>
Diplomatic relations between the two countries soured after
Filipino maid Flor Contemplacion was hanged in March 1995, despite
repeated appeals by Manila for a stay of the execution.
Contemplacion was convicted of the murder of fellow Filipino maid
Delia Maga and her four-year-old Singaporean ward.
</P>
<P>
Subsequently, the Philippine government imposed the ban on the
deployment of maids to the city-state, and the two countries
recalled their ambassadors. The diplomatic relations between the
two nations had downgraded.
</P>
<P>
In January this year, the two countries renewed their
diplomatic ties by exchanging ambassadors, but the ban was kept
on.
</P>
<P>
Now the ban-lifting was seen as a gesture by Manila to fully
restore warm relations with Singapore. As members of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), the Philippines
and Singapore, to some extent, are interdependent both politically
and economically. The restoration of warm relations will be
beneficial to each other.
</P>
<P>
Although the two countries normalized their diplomatic ties in
January, the ban had hindered the full restoration of warm
relations between the two countries. Now that the barrier was
finally removed with the ban-lifting.
</P>
<P>
The ban-lifting came on the eve of Secretary of Foreign Affairs
Domingo Siazon's four-day visit to Singapore starting July 16. He
is expected to renew an invitation from President Ramos to
Singaporean Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong to visit the Philippines.
 The ban-lifting will help ensure the success of Siazon's visit.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the Philippines lifted the ban for its own economic
interests. The remittances of 6.5 million Philippine overseas
workers has a significant impact on the national economy. The
Philippines is the world's largest labor exporter, and the
remittances are Manila's biggest sources foreign currency.
Economic migrants sent home 4.7 billion US dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
However, the ban on maids to Singapore had not only cut off
lifelines to some impoverished Filipinos, but also reduced the
national revenues. With the nation's unemployment soaring to 9.5
percent, the government could hardly afford the continuation of
the ban. Therefore, the government has to lift the ban as the
last resort.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, by lifting the ban, the Ramos
administration also intended to arrest the increasing flow of
undocumented Filipinos to Singapore. Recently, about 200
Filipinos entered Singapore each month without official documents.
 The illegal entrants made the government more difficult to
protect their interests in Singapore.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, Ramos approved a new plan to document household
workers going Singapore and regulate illegal entrants already
there. Under the plan, all undocumented Filipino workers working
in Singapore will be processed at the Philippine embassy in
Singapore by the Singaporean employment agencies which recruited
them.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here believe that the ban-lifting would certainly
promote relations of the two ASEAN countries and will benefit
Manila economically.

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Nepali government will
introduce a bill in the ongoing parliament session to legalize
private companies' participation in telecommunication services in
the country.
</P>
<P>
According to Minister for Information and Communications
Chiranjibi Wagle, the introduction of the bill on telecom sector
privatization was part of the government's policy to develop the
country's telecommunication infrastructure with the involvement of
the private sector.
</P>
<P>
Necessary legal arrangements were underway for the purpose, he
said Saturday while testifying at a Lower House meeting.
</P>
<P>
An independent body would be set up to maintain coordination
among various private telecom operators and to monitor their
services, he added.
</P>
<P>
The government would ensure the state-run Nepal Telecom
Corporation (NTC) not to run into loss after new telecommunication
services by private companies started, according to the minister.
</P>
<P>
Wagle also disclosed that the government had a plan to provide
autonomy to the NTC within one year so that it could raise fund
from the capital market and float shares for expansion of its
services.
</P>
<P>
The NTC could also establish joint ventures with foreign
investors for its further development, he said.
</P>
<P>
The government had decided to privatize the state-run NTC,
which has been monopolizing the country's telecom sector, within
three years, he added.

<P>
TOKYO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto will try to streamline the deficit-ridden state coffers
after raising the consumption tax on June 25, the Kyodo News
Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese cabinet held a two-hour meeting Friday to review
the country's rigid state budget allocations in the face of severe
budgetary constraints. It must set ceilings on budgetary requests
of ministries and agencies by the end of July.
</P>
<P>
Government departments will submit their budgetary requests to
the Finance Ministry at the end of August and the government will
draw up its fiscal 1997 budget in December for deliberation at a
150-day regular session of the Diet which convenes in January.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister wants to review the government's swollen
spending on public construction works and appropriate more funds
for science and technology, telecommunications and other sectors
so as to promote Japan's economic structural reform.
</P>
<P>
The present spending formula has been criticized as leading to
rigidity in the allocation of funds by giving priority to
traditional public investment areas of construction and civil
engineering.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting Japan's difficult fiscal situation, the Finance
Ministry is cautious about introducing new spending quotas to
promote structural reform.

were caused by the engine fire or people trying to evacuate the
plane.
</P>
<P>
The National Transportation Safety Board said it was sending a
team of investigators to the crash site.
</P>
<P>
Mark Sullivan, a spokesman for East Hartford, Conn.-based Pratt
&AMP; Whitney, which manufactured the plane's engines, was quoted as
saying that the company believed a fan blade in the front of the
left engine failed.
</P>
<P>
Broken pieces of the blade probably penetrated the fan case and
debris went flying, Sullivan said.
</P>
<P>
Delta has had two other fatal accidents since 1985. On August
2, 1985, a Delta Airlines Lockheed L-1011 crashed at Dallas-Fort
Worth Airport, killing 137 people. On August 31, 1988, a Delta
Airlines Boeing 727 crashed and burned on takeoff at Dallas
Fort-Worth Airport, killing 14.

number of ministers and dignitaries to be present at the airport
during the prime minister's departure for and arrival from trips
abroad.
</P>
<P>
Official sources disclosed today that under the new amendment,
those present at the airport ceremony from now on would be three
senior ministers, Dhaka city mayor, chiefs of three services, four
secretaries, chief of the diplomatic corps and mission chief of
the host country or countries.
</P>
<P>
While earlier, some 50 ministers, dignitaries, diplomats and
officials used to be present at the airport on such occasions.

curbing wastage, pursuing austerity and avoiding colorful
ceremonies, the sources said.

It was learnt that Prime Minister Shiekh Hasina is beginning
her trip from Monday to Makkah, Saudi Arabia. Her 42-member

<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The government of Nepal is to
hold talks with a teachers' organization which had staged a series
of protests last week appealing for the fulfillment of its earlier
demands.

tons of winter and spring paddy, up 916,000 tons, or 7 percent,

<HEADLINE> Balkan Meeting Opens As Macedonia Pulls Out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SOFIA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Top diplomats from Balkan countries
and representatives of international communities attended a
landmark meeting here today, aiming to map a peaceful future path
for the region that had suffered from historic feuds and bloody
conflicts.
</P>
<P>
At the opening ceremony, Bulgarian Prime Minister Zhan Videnov
said that the meeting is intended to "strengthen regional
stability, security and cooperation on the basis of the principles
of good neighborliness."
</P>
<P>
But at the last minute before the opening ceremony, the
Macedonian delegation withdrew from the meeting due to a row with
Greece over its name, remindering foreign ministers that there are
still many unresolved issues threatening peace and stability in
the region.
</P>
<P>
Macedonia refused to attend the meeting under its U.N. name of
the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (FYROM). But Greece
insisted that the name "Macedonia" implies territorial claims on a
province of the same name in north Greece.
</P>
<P>
Greek Foreign Minister Theodoros Pangalos expressed his regret
over the Macedonian decision, noting that Skopje had accepted the
name of FYROM at other international forums.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers or deputy foreign ministers from Bulgaria,
Romania, Greece, Yugoslavia, Albania, Bosnia and Turkey, together
with representatives from Britain, Germany, Russia, France and the
United States attended the international conference.
</P>
<P>
Croatia, Slovenia, Hungary and Italy sent observers to the
third gathering of Balkan foreign ministers, who held two meetings
respectively in February 1988 and October 1990.
</P>
<P>
But the agreement reached at the 1990 meeting could not be
implemented and countries in the region failed to realize their
dream of multilateral cooperation due to the Bosnian War and the
economic crises which bothered the Balkan countries.
</P>
<P>
After the war ended, Videnov proposed in February 1996 the
convocation of a third meeting of Balkan foreign ministers with an
aim to discuss issues on cooperation in economy, technology,
culture, communications and transportation in southeastern
Europe.

<HEADLINE> Americans to Take Lion's Share at Atlanta Swimming Pool </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Taking the home-turf
advantage, the ecletic 44-swimmer American squad will again show
their all-around superiorities at the Olympic Games in the aquatic
center of the Georgia Tech University.
</P>
<P>
Four years ago in Barcelona, the long-time supermacy of the
sports chalked up a total of 11 golds, nine silvers and 7 bronzes
to top the medal tally, beating the CIS into the second.
</P>
<P>
The disappearance of the CIS delegation this time will leave
the door even wider for the Americans to grab the number one spot
in the sports.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest world rankings issued by FINA till June
10, American swimmers top-ranked in eight and second-placed in 11
events out of the 26 individual disciplines, while the Americans
also lead in some relay races, which further consolidate their
edge.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. team is expected to chalk up 11 to 14 golds at the
upcoming Centennial Games.
</P>
<P>
The versatile Tom Dolan, 20, who clocked three year's best
times at the Olympic Trials last March in Indianapolis, is the one
to make a big splash in the pool. The world champion and world
record holder in the 400m individual medley is expected to capture
more than one Olympic Laurel in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
World record holder Jeff Rouse is top-favoured in his
speciality, the men's 100m backstroke while Gary Hall Jr.,
runner-up in both the 50m and 100m freestyle at the Rome World
Championships in 1994, was given the chance for the revenge aginst
Russia's Alexander Popov in the sprints.
</P>
<P>
In addition, American men's squad are expected to sweep all
three relay races.
</P>
<P>
"We have never been beaten in the relay race at the Olympics,
and we are not going to start in 1996." said U.S. men's head
coach Skip Kenny. The Russians will be their closest rivals.
</P>
<P>
In all, the men's program will witness Australia (Kieren
Perkins), Russia (Alexander Popov, Denis Pankratov) and a spread
of others hidding to limit U.S supremacy.
</P>
<P>
In the women's events, the 800m freestyle crown seem to be
destined to the hands of the Americans. Third-time Olympian Janet
Evans's most dangerous rival was a teenager Brooke Bennett, her
National Resident teammate.
</P>
<P>
The 23-year-old Amy Van Dyken will launch a strong challenge to
world champion Le Jingyi of China in the sprints, together with
her teammate Angel Martino, 28, the oldest swimmer in the
U.S. roster.
</P>
<P>
Another U.S. teenager Amanda Beard will go all out for her
first Olympic gold in the breaststroke event, having Samantha
Riley of Australia and Penelope Heyns of South Africa in her way
to the victory.
</P>
<P>
However, the U.S. swimming Olympic coaches for the men's and
women's squad both outcried a pessimistic prediction, saying that
American swimmers would have to "reach unprecedented heights to
battle for Olympic gold".
</P>
<P>
Richard Quick, head coach of the women's team, acknowledged
that expectations for the American female swimmers were extremely
low, and they would not favored in a single women's event.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and Australian girls are the most serious challengers
for their U.S. equivalents.
</P>
<P>
Chinese women's squad, anchored by two-time Olympian Le, are
favoured in four events: the 50m, 100m freestyle, the 4X100m
freestyle relay and the 200 individual medley.
</P>
<P>
The Australia pin the medal hope mostly on drug ban escapee
Riley in the breaststroke and Susan O'Neil in the butterfly.
</P>
<P>
World Champion Riley just received another relief as her coach
Scott Volkers, scapegoat for Riley's drug scandal, can now go to
Atlanta, having his 12-month ban reduced to seven months.
</P>
<P>
Two Japanese new faces Ayari Aoyama, Hitomi Kashima could
become the "underdog" in the butterfly events. The two who came
from nowhere took the limelight by clocking year's best time in
the 100m and 200m butterfly.
</P>
<P>
Other lady participants to watch include last Games
sensations: Germany's Franziska Van Almsick and Hungary's
Krisztina Egerszegi.
</P>
<P>
Both scored the year's best time in the 200m freestyle and 200m
backstroke respectively at the Olympic Trials.

<HEADLINE> China to Open First Airlink with Latin-America Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) --The first direct air routes linking
China with Latin America is expected to be open in the near
future, today's English-language China Daily reported.
</P>
<P>
"China has agreed with Brazil recently to launch direct air
links before the end of this year, saving passengers the trouble
of switching flights in a third country", the newspaper quoted
Zhang Yafeng, a senior official with the Civil Aviation
Administration of China (CAAC), as saying.
</P>
<P>
Current flights normally take 36 hours to reach that part of
the world from Beijing. That time interval will be cut by one
third when direct air links are in place, Zhang added.
</P>
<P>
The first carrier to break the ice is very likely to be Varig,
one of Brazil's oldest airlines. Varig and its major rival Vasp
have been operating regular flights to Japan and the Republic of
Korea respectively, making them both technically prepared to take
the lead before Chinese airlines finish surveying the Latin
American market in detail.
</P>
<P>
Leading all South American countries, Brazil signed a bilateral
aviation agreement with China two years ago and a memorandum of
understanding last November, laying the foundation for its
airlines to enter China's airspace, he said.
</P>
<P>
But the final breakthrough came last month when Chen Guangyi,
director of CAAC, headed a delegation to Brazil, Chile, Argentina
and Peru to speed the process of establishing direct air links, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He also said that since direct air routes have to be opened on
an equal footing, a Chinese candidate to start flying to Brazil
next year will be chosen among Air China, China Eastern and China
Southern, all keen on pushing their frontier overseas.

<HEADLINE> Brazil's Agricultural Output Expected to Drop in 1996 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
RIO DE JANEIRO, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's grain output could
decrease by 9.19 percent to 72.07 million tons in 1996 from 79.37
million tons last year, the Brazilian Geography and Statistics
Institute said in a forecast published by the local press today.
</P>
<P>
The institute said the forecast was based on the month of May
harvests. In April, the grain output this year had been
calculated to be 71 million tons.
</P>
<P>
The northeast region of the country, which traditionally
produces 10 percent of the grain yield, is expected to get a rise
of 6.51 percent while the output in other regions is expected to
drop.
</P>
<P>
The southern area, which always produces 17 percent of the
national total, has showed a 14.27 drop in grain production due to
lack of rainfalls this year.
</P>
<P>
A 4.84 percent drop is expected to happen in the East-Center
Region, the second grain producer in Brazil.
</P>
<P>
The southeast zone, which usually yields 16 percent of the
national production, will see a 8.37 percent fall while a drop of
5.72 percent could appear in the north.

MANAGUA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- At least 300 families were
displaced by recent floods in Chinandega, Nicaragua, but no

<HEADLINE> Sri Lanka to Probe Conduct of Ministers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Sri Lankan President Chandrika
Kumaratunga will shortly direct investigations into the conduct of
five ministers who were acting contrary to the government's policy
of transparency, according to authoritative sources here today.
</P>
<P>
While addressing her ministers a fortnight ago in her office,
the president had accused the ministers without naming them about
irregularities and malpractice under their ministries, the sources
added.
</P>
<P>
The president told her cabinet at the time that there were only
a few who really worked hard in the interest of the public
upholding the government's policy of transparency.
</P>
<P>
President Kumaratunga would shortly appoint a very senior
official at the presidential Secretariat to probe into the
allegations she had received about the conduct of the five
ministers, according to the sources.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAVANA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Cuba produced 750,000 tons of crude
oil in the first semester this year, exceeding the planned target
for the period by 4.4 percent.
</P>
<P>
The main reason for the good performance of the oil industry
was the improvement of installations and the application of
advanced technologies, said Jean Fleites Melo, general manager of
the state oil company Commercial Cupet, S.A.
</P>
<P>
Oil output in the Varadero field, where geological and
technical measures were applied, accounted for 74 percent of crude
oil produced in Cuba, he said.
</P>
<P>
Melo forecast that the 1.4-million-ton target for this year
will be surpassed.

<HEADLINE> Special Funds Helpful For Treasury Bonds Trading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Booming treasury bond market will
promote the emergence of investment funds specializing in
so-called "gilt-edged bonds", today's English-language China Daily
reports.
</P>
<P>
At present, 150 billion yuan (18.1 billion US dollars) of
treasury bonds are traded in the secondary market, creating a
foundation for the specialized investment funds, the newspaper
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Treasury bonds have become the second most important investment
vehicle to Chinese individuals next to bank deposits. But
inexperienced individual investors find they often miss the best
investment opportunities with the frequency of bond issuance
increasing, variety increasing and issue period shortening, it
said.
</P>
<P>
Treasury bond funds will also result in the increase of
institutional investors, which will help the central bank conduct
macroeconomic control through the open market.
</P>
<P>
The paper explained that China's central bank this year started
open market operations to adjust the amount of currency in
circulation by selling and buying treasury bonds to financial
institutions. But since most of the treasury bonds are held by
individuals, the open market operation is inefficient.
</P>
<P>
Establishment of the treasury bond funds will gather the bonds
scattered among individuals and play an important role in the open
market, it said.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, the investment funds can also usher more
individual investors into the treasure bond secondary market, the
newspaper pointed out.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that China's first national regulation on
investment funds will be issued this year, it revealed.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The Ministry of Finance, State
Administration of Taxation and the People's Bank of China have
recently issued several circulars, calling for measures to help
State enterprises increase technology input, improve bank services
and forge tight bank-enterprise cooperation, today's "China Daily"
reported.
</P>
<P>
The measures come at a time when many State firms are plagued
by severe losses, it said, adding that losses made by debt-ridden
State industrial firms rose by 41 percent in the first quarter of
this year.
</P>
<P>
The report also said that profits of profitable State
enterprises shrunk by 54.7 percent over the same period of last
year.
</P>
<P>
It quoted a circular jointly issued by the Ministry of Finance
and the State Administration of Taxation as saying that imported
instruments and equipment for use by research institutions of
enterprises will enjoy waived value-added tax and either waived or
reduced duties.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, urged all
State-owned commercial banks in a 10-point notice to satisfy the
funding demands of large and medium-sized State enterprises which
have marketable products and are profitable, unlikely to misuse
the funds and able to repay the principal and interest.
</P>
<P>
The central bank circular also urged commercial banks to expand
export credit, support enterprises' restructuring and
technological improvement and help them explore other fund-raising
channels, the newspaper said.

<HEADLINE> Atlanta Lab Gets OK from IOC </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 6 (Xinhua/OANA) -- After months of delays, the
SmithKline Beecham lab in Atlanta on Friday received a "go-ahead"
from the International Olympic Committee to conduct drug testing
for the Olympic Games.
</P>
<P>
The accreditation, which came from two weeks before the Games,
is the latest ever for a lab before an Olympics. Without a trial
run of a sports competition, athletes to be tested positive by
this lab may turn to the court to question the results.
</P>
<P>
Dr. John Cantwell, the Olympic chief medical officer, said the
Olympic lab had assembled a "Dream Team" of equipment and experts.
</P>
<P>
"We're pleased about the accreditation; we were not seriously
concerned about it," Cantwell said.
</P>
<P>
Along with SmithKline staff, testing officials from IOC labs in
Indianapolis and Cologne of Germany will participate, as well
faculty and students from the Morehouse School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
The high-resolution mass spectrometer, said to be able to
detect the drug that athlete took as early as six month ago, will
be used to an unprecedented extent at the Games.
</P>
<P>
In his accreditation letter to the Atlanta Committee for the
Olympic Games (ACOG), Prince Alexandre de Merode, IOC Medical
Commission chairman, praised the device's performance during a
test.
</P>
<P>
The lab, however, may not be free of pre-Games scrutiny. The
Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS), which will hear appeals of
drug tests and other competition disputes during the Games, plan
to send an independent expert to review the lab.
</P>
<P>
All Olympic athletes were required to sign a pledge agreeing to
take any drug-testing dispute to CAS. The waiver is part of the
application form, which was the due Friday.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 7 (Xinhua) -- Bowing to severe all round
criticism of the hefty hike in petroleum prices, the Indian
government Saturday slashed by half the 30 percent increase in the
price of diesel from midnight Saturday but left untouched the
steep increase in prices of petrol and cooling gas.
</P>
<P>
With this, the price of diesel will come down by one rupee
(about three US cents) per liter, still 15 percent higher than the
price that prevailed before the July 3 massive price hike in
petroleum products.
</P>
<P>
The government announced Tuesday that prices of petrol would go
up by 25 percent and that of diesel and domestic cooling gas by 30
percent each from July 3 (Wednesday). The move was criticized
from all over the country by political parties, trade and business
bodies, and transport organizations.
</P>
<P>
Indian Parliamentary Affairs and Tourism minister Srikant Jena,
who announced the decision of partial roll-back of diesel price,
said that the cabinet made the decision in view of the possible
cascading effect of the diesel price hike on the overall price
situation.

<TEXT>
<P>
ATLANTA, July 6 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. divers and coaches have
vowed to put their bad time behind to concentrate on the Olympic
Games.
</P>
<P>
All eight divers and their coaches arrived in Atlanta on
Saturday to begin the last tune-up for the Games.
</P>
<P>
They seem determined to leave behind a controversy that erupted
June 23, the last day of the Olympic diving trials, when platform
diver David Pichler accused coach Ron O'Brien of harrasing him
since he left O'Brien's team last year.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks later, the two said they would put their differences
aside until the Olympics is over.
</P>
<P>
"At this point, I can't be bothered by that," said Pichler,
27. "I've achieved one of my biggest goals ever and my next goal
is an Olympic medal. I'm not going to let anything get in my
way."
</P>
<P>
O'Brien, who is an Olympic coach for the eighth time, didn't
want to even talk about his past problems with Pichler.
</P>
<P>
"We're on the same team and we need to work together as a team
to make it possible for everybody to do well," O'Brien said.
</P>
<P>
Mark Lenzi, who returns to the U.S. team after winning a gold
medal in 1992, didn't think the Pichler-O'Brien rift will distract
other members of the team.
</P>
<P>
"As far as I'm concerned, right now it's no problem," he said.
"It hasn't bothered me at any other meets this year, and it's been
going on for a while."

<HEADLINE> Graf Snatches Seventh Wimbledon Title </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WIMBLEDON, ENGLAND, July 6 (Xinhua/OANA) -- Defending champion
Steffi Graf of Germany cliched her seventh Wimbledon title after
beating her arch-rival fourth-seeded Arantxa Sanchez-Vinario of
Spain in the women's singles final in straight sets 6-3, 7-5.
</P>
<P>
In a repeat of last year's women's singles final clash, World
number three Sanchez, who enjoyed a smooth sailing into the
women's singles final, staged fierce attacks upon world number
one Graf.
</P>
<P>
The German tennis ace looked set to run away with it as she
took first set 6-3 and went to two breaks up in the second
set. But Sanchez-Vinario fought back tenaciouly from 4-0 down to
5-5 as the defending champion appeared to lose her nerve.
</P>
<P>
At the crucial moment, the experienced Graf calmed herself and
recovered her attacking form to claim her 20th Grand Slam title
and 100th tournament title.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after the thrilling clash, Graf said, "it's simply
unbelievable and it's like a dream because I didn't expect it to
be possible to take the title."
</P>
<P>
"Winning seven Wimbledons is something I never imagined I
would be able to do, or was capable of doing. Just now I can't
really put it into words, It's just incredible to me how the last
few years have been going, how I've always been able to rise to
the occassion," the 27-year-old German player said.
</P>
<P>
Graf's opponent Sanchez-Vinario also paid tribute to the world
number one player, "She played very deep today and it was very
hard for me to even get to the net. She served really well and
forehand was always very deep."
</P>
<P>
"She's already made history because she's won I don't know how
may Grand Slam titles. It's great for her," she added.
</P>
<P>
In the men's semi-final clashes, non-seeded MaliVai Washington
of the United States and Dutch player Michael Krajicek beat their
opponents to reach Wimbledon men's singles final.
</P>
<P>
During the protracted match between Washington and the
13th-seeded player Todd Martin, strong-mined Washington came from
behind and finally forced solid player Martin out of the Wimbledon
tournament 5-7, 6-4, 6-7, 6-3, 10-8.
</P>
<P>
In the other semi-final clash, giant Dutch Krajicek, who
created the biggest upset in the tournament by ousting world
number one and defending champion Pete Sampras earlier, enjoyed a
smooth sailing into the final showdown by beating his Australian
opponent Jason Stoltenberg in straight sets 7-5, 6-2, 6-1.
</P>
<P>
With last seeded player Martin out the Wimbledon semi-final,
the Wimbledon men's singles final clash set to be a non-seeded
showdown between Washington and Krajicek.
</P>
<P>
In the men's doubles final, Austrilian combination Todd
Woodbidge/Mark Woodford defeated their Zimbabwe and Canadian
opponents 4-6, 6-1, 6-3, 6-2 to take the Wimbledon men's doubles
title.

They are charged with instigating and allowing the destruction
and persecution of Serb civilians on ethnic, political and

evidence, the daily says.
</P>
<P>

<TEXT>
<P>
YAOUNDE, July 7 (Xinhua) -- The 64th Council of Ministers
meeting of the Organization of African Unity (OAU) ended here
late last night with agreements on most of the issues under
review.
</P>
<P>
After three days of hard work and hot debate, delegates from
53 OAU member states agreed on most of the hot issues facing
Africa, including those concerning the hot spots such as Burundi,
Liberia, Sierra Leone, Angola and Somalia.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a couple of thorny issues including the Rwandan
refugee problem which led to the parting of the Zairian and the
Rwandan delegations, remained unsolved and are expected to be
submitted to the OAU summit scheduled on July 8-10.
</P>
<P>
Among the 35 agenda items under review, the ministerial
meeting worked out 28 resolutions and passed the others on to the
summit for further deliberations.
</P>
<P>
In a sign of solidarity, the OAU ministerial meeting made a
draft version of the Yaounde Declaration for 21st century Africa,
which embodies the regional body's action plan to build a better
Africa, and it will also be passed on to the summit.
</P>
<P>
The Council of Ministers meeting should have ended on Friday
but was postponed to be concluded at nearly midnight.

<HEADLINE> Bosnian Entities Reach Delimitation Agreement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, July 6 (Xinhua) -- Representatives of the two
entities in Bosnia -- Republika Srpska and the Muslim-Croat
federation -- signed an agreement in Sarajevo today tracing an
inter-entity boundary line.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, witnessed by the IFOR commander in Bosnia, U.S.
Admiral Leighton Smith, regulates about 40 points at issue along
more than 1,000-km long line of separation, Tanjug news agency
reported.
</P>
<P>
Another 650 controversial points remain to be settled by the
two entities, the agency said.
</P>
<P>
The delimitation talks began on January 27, five weeks after
the Dayton agreement was signed in Paris. Under the peace accord,
Bosnia is preserved to be a single state but divided into two
entities with almost equal territories.
</P>
<P>
The NATO-led IFOR troops, which flooded into Bosnia since
mid-December of last year, carved a separation zone of more than
1,000 kilometers long along the inter-border to separate the
conflicting armies in Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
Admiral Smith said that the inter-entity boundary line would be
changed in some areas, such as places near northeastern Muslim
town Tuzla, near capital Sarajevo in central Bosnia, as well as in
the Bihac area in the northwestern part of Bosnia.
