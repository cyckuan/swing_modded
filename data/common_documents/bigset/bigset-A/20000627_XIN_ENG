<HEADLINE> Vietnam Pronounces Judgment to Biggest Drug Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The People's Court of Vietnam's Nam
Dinh City on Monday handed out 11 death and nine life sentences to
20 of the 22 defendants on charges of illegal drug trafficking,
Vietnam News Agency reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is the biggest ever drug trafficking case in the country.
</P>
<P>
The 10-day trial concluded that Nguyen Van Tam, the ring leader,
and his accomplices had illegally transported 289.2 kg of opium
and 259.5 kg of heroin between 1992 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
The syndicate's distribution area stretched from the country's
northern border provinces of Lang Son and Lai Chau to Nam Dinh and
Thai Binh provinces, Hai Phong port city and Ho Chi Minh City.
They earned a combined profit of nearly 10 billion Vietnamese dong
(710,000 U.S. dollars) from the illicit trade.
</P>
<P>
The court also confiscated 441,700 U.S. dollars and 332.5 taels
of gold possessed by Nguyen Van Tam and other assets bought with
illegal money by other defendants.

<HEADLINE> International Day Against Drug Abuse Observed in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 26 (Xinhua) -- International Day Against Drug Abuse
and Illicit Trafficking was observed Monday in Bangladesh as
elsewhere in the globe with the theme "Facing Reality: Denial,
Corruption and Violence."
</P>
<P>
To mark the Day, Bangladesh Narcotics Control Department drew
up elaborate programs, including holding colorful cycle rally and
cultural function, and serving improved diets among drug addicts.
</P>
<P>
The Bangladeshi government has recently undertaken a five-year
master plan to reduce drug demand through the Narcotics Control
Department in collaboration with the United Nations Development
Program.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of the Day, President Shahabuddin Ahmed in his
message called for turning the campaign against drug abuse into a
greater social movement to check degradation of moral values in
society.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina in her separate message called
upon the countrymen to work for building a happy and prosperous
Bangladesh by making the society free from drug.
</P>
<P>
Drug abuse, as a new problem in Bangladesh, has caught the
attention of the government at the beginning of the last decade as
it started to destroy the social fabrics.
</P>
<P>
However, there was no systematic study and research on drug
addicts till now, all the data were based on slipshod survey,
personal observation and unauthenticated reports.
</P>
<P>
Experts urged the government to take instant steps to
investigate in this worsening problem to secure the health and
safety of the people.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia Denies Rumor of Counterfeit U.S. Dollars From Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The Justice Minister of
Mongolia, Dashpuntsag Ganbold, said Monday that 1 million
counterfeit U.S. dollars, which were discovered from Darkhan-Uul
province in Mongolia, were not from the Russian Chechnya Republic,
the Mongolian News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Ganbold said that all of these confiscated counterfeit U.S.
dollars were made in non-professional level, compared with
counterfeit dollars made in Russian Chechnya. He also repulsed a
recent rumor that another 1 million counterfeit U.S. dollars were
discovered in Darkhan-Uul province.
</P>
<P>
The case of counterfeit U.S. dollars have shocked Mongolian
market. It was reported that some experts from American special
service are investigating it with Mongolian police.

<HEADLINE> Late Liberian Vice President's Body Undergoes Autopsy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Doctors Monday commenced an autopsy
on the remains of Liberian vice president Enoch Dogolea in
Abidjan, Cote d'Ivoire, reports reaching here from Liberia said.
</P>
<P>
Liberian Health Minister Peter Coleman said in the Liberia's
capital Monrovia that the team of doctors from Cote d'Ivoire and
Liberia and forensic experts will work to determine the cause of
death of the Liberian vice president.
</P>
<P>
Dogolea, 48, died Friday night at an Ivorian medical centre
where he was rushed over a week earlier when doctors in Liberia
had failed to diagnose and treat an illness he developed
"suddenly".
</P>
<P>
The Liberian government Saturday ordered a "comprehensive
autopsy," according to President Charles Taylor, "to put an end to
 speculations that Vice President Dogolea was either poisoned or
beaten" by his (Taylor's) bodyguards.
</P>
<P>
Following the announcement of Dogolea's illness, Monrovia was
rife with rumors that he was suffering from jaundice, then later
cardiac attack and kidney and liver problems, before the horrible
story of his alleged flogging by bodyguards of Taylor was spread.
</P>
<P>
Taylor, in a statement at the weekend, said the "speculations
were being spread by detractors of the government who want to
bring about public disorder."

<HEADLINE> Workers in Nigeria's Lagos State Continue Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- The strike by workers in Nigeria's
Lagos State entered its fifth day on Monday with the authorities
restating their inability to pay the minimum wage demanded by the
workers.
</P>
<P>
The strike has particularly affected more than 6 million
residents of the commercial city of Lagos, with state-owned
schools closed, health services crippled and the water supply cut
off.
</P>
<P>
The 47,000 state workers went on strike Thursday to press for a
monthly minimum wage of 7,500 naira, the standard of that of the
federal government employees. The state government has offered to
pay about 5,500 naira (about 100 naira equals to one U. S.
dollar).
</P>
<P>
The federal government on May 1 announced a minimum wage of
7,500 naira for its workers and 5,500 naira for their state
counterparts.
</P>
<P>
Most state governments have since said that they could not
afford to pay anything beyond the stipulated minimum wage, setting
the stage for a nation- wide strike.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the issue at the weekend, Governor Bola Tinubu of
Lagos State, whose workers embarked on the strike in spite of a
court injunction restraining them from doing so, said he could not
afford to use all the resources of the state to pay salaries.
</P>
<P>
He restated his earlier call on the federal government to
increase the allocation to the state. "If additional revenue is
allocated to Lagos State today, I will pay more than 7,500 naira."
</P>
<P>
Tinubu blamed the federal government for unilaterally fixing
the minimum wage. "Lagos State was not part of the decision-making
process on the new minimum wage," he said.
</P>
<P>
But the federal government, on the contrary, said the states
have the resources to pay.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Demands End to Air Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Iraq has demanded the United
Nations to end the "baseless" air ban imposed on the country, the
official Iraqi News Agency (INA) reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The demand was conveyed to U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan by
Iraqi National Assembly (parliament) Speaker Saadoun Hamadi, who is
now in Geneva to attend the special session of the U.N. General
Assembly on social development.
</P>
<P>
At present, flights to and from Iraq must get prior permission
from the U.N. Sanctions Committee, but air travel by Iraqi pilgrims
to Islam's most sacred sites in Mecca and Medina, Saudi Arabia, has
been exempted from the sweeping U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Hamadi pointed out that the air ban was unilaterally imposed on
Iraq by the U.S.-led Western allies following the 1991 Gulf War,
and was not explicitly covered by any U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
He also called for intervention of the U.N. secretary general to
make the U.S. and British representatives stop putting on hold
contracts Iraq signed with foreign countries to import food,
medicine and other humanitarian supplies.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly accused the U.S. and Britain of blocking the
contracts it signed with other countries, worsening the
humanitarian crisis resulted in the decade-old U.N. sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Under the U.N. oil-for-food program, Iraq is allowed to export
crude and use part of the revenue, under the U.N. supervision, to
import food, medicine and other necessities for its 22 million
people, who have been under stringent U.N. sanctions ever since
Iraq's 1990 invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Turkey to Step up Developing Kurd-Populated Region </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkey vowed on Tuesday to develop
its largely Kurdish-populated east and southeast regions following
a significant decision to lift emergency rule in southeastern
province of Van at the end of July.
</P>
<P>
Interior Minister Sadettin Tantan said at a news conference that
the government is determined to modernize those areas, plagued with
the outlawed Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), which has waged an
armed campaign against Ankara since 1984 demanding Kurdish self-
rule.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's determination to tap its most underdeveloped regions
came as the National Security Council (MGK) decided on Monday to
advise the government to end emergency rule in Van, but to extend
it for four months in other four cities in the region.
</P>
<P>
The law was first declared in Van in 1987 to suppress the PKK's
separatist activities and violence in the region.
</P>
<P>
Following the PKK leader Abdullah Ocalan's imprisonment last
year, the 15-year conflict -- which has claimed some 36,500 lives -
- is likely to be solved in a peaceful resolution.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said that the government's efforts to realize economic
growth in the region aimed to strengthen hope for peace among local
people, mostly Kurds, who will profit from the economic development
and give up support for the PKK's separatism.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged governors of Van and neighboring provinces to
coordinate in repopulating villagers, displaced by escaping chaos
in the decades.
</P>
<P>
He said that clusters of three or four villages would be united
to form small modern towns with "excellent health, education and
other infrastructure."
</P>
<P>
Tantan said, however, that the PKK's terrorist group was by no
means uprooted and still active in neighboring countries, adding
that security forces are keeping vigilance against their
operations.

<HEADLINE> Lithuanian Parliament Speaker Signs Bill on Russia's Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Lithuanian parliament speaker
Vytautas Landsbergis on Tuesday signed a bill demanding Russia to
redeem the damages to Lithuania by the over-50-year former Soviet
Union's rule,reported the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
Landsbergis inked the bill into a law in the capital of Vilnius
just several hours after President Valdas Adamkus declined to
endorse the bill, passed by the parliament, earlier the day.
</P>
<P>
Under the Lithuanian Constitution, if the president does not
sign a law, approved by the parliament, within ten days since he
has received it, this law can come into effect if the chairman of
the parliament signs it.
</P>
<P>
According to the guidelines of the 1992 referendum in the
former Soviet republic, Russia is demanded to and must compensate
for the damages caused by the Soviet occupation to Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision of the referendum, before September 1 this
year,the government of Lithuania must form a delegation "for
negotiations with Russia on the compensation for the damages by
the Soviet occupation," and before October 1, the amount of the
damages must be specified.
</P>
<P>
By November 1, the delegation should claim to Moscow the amount
of compensations, inform the United Nations, the Council for
Europe and the European Union about it, initiate negotiations and
have Russia compensate the Lithuanian victims and the Lithuanian
State.
</P>
<P>
Adamkus, who criticizes the policy of the ruling majority in
relation to Russia all the time, said in a television address to
the nation last week that the bill runs contrary to Lithuania's
interests and will undermine the state's foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
Observers say that despite Adamkus' refusal, Landsbergis, as
the bill's initiator, still decided to take all responsibility for
adopting and enacting the law which has caused Moscow's negative
reaction.
</P>
<P>
Lithuania and the two other Baltic states -- Latvia and Estonia
--were incorporated in the Soviet Union in 1940. Vilnius declared
independence in 1990.

<HEADLINE> Russian Economy to Improve Evidently in Three-Four Years: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Russian Deputy Prime Minister and
Finance Minister Alexei Kudrin said here Tuesday that Russia's
economic situation will change better obviously in coming three-
four years if current positive tendencies in national economy go
on.
</P>
<P>
The country's economy is now developing well and will post a
record 4-5 percent growth this year, with the inflation to stand
at 15-18 percent, he told an interview with the Russian newspaper
Izvestia.
</P>
<P>
The basic economic strategy formulated by the government for
the next years is: to ease the tax burden of the population,
reduce the state's expenditure and advance the average gross
domestic product(GDP) per person, he said.
</P>
<P>
He assured that the nation's foreign debts will not increase,
but drop. The new borrowing from foreign creditors will mainly be
used to repay the old debts.
</P>
<P>
By his estimate, in the future four years Russia's GDP per
person will rise by one and a half times.
</P>
<P>
If the strategy is complied with continuously, Russian economic
situation will get much better within three-four years, he
predicted.
</P>
<P>
The official attributed the inspiring economic growth since the
beginning of this year to the government's successful control over
the inflation and the rise of the prices of Russia's export
products such as gas, crude and fuel oil on the world markets.
</P>
<P>
He admitted that these favorable factors will be exhausted by
the end of the year. Nevertheless, he believes that any
unpredictable situation will not appear in the national economy,
because the cabinet is pursuing a coordinated policy with the
Central Bank and can manage to hold the inflation and the economic
growth at the preconcerted levels.
</P>
<P>
"Minor fluctuations are possible. But this will have no impact
on the trend," Kudrin said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Government Moves to Block WorldCom-Sprint Merger </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. Justice Department
filed suit Tuesday to block the proposed 129-billion-U.S.-dollar
merger of WorldCom and Sprint, the country's second- and third-
largest phone companies, warning that the merger would increase
prices for millions of consumers.
</P>
<P>
"This merger threatens to undermine the competitive gains
achieved since the department challenged AT&AMP;T's monopoly of the
telecommunications industry 25 years ago," Attorney General Janet
Reno said at a news conference.
</P>
<P>
"It will result in higher prices for millions of consumers and
businesses and lead to lower service quality and less innovation,"
she said.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department action prompted the two companies to
withdrew their merger application filed with the European
Commission. But they denied they were abandoning the merger.
</P>
<P>
"If, in the future, the parties decide to proceed with the
merger, they will make such notifications as are appropriate under
European merger laws," WorldCom and Sprint said in a joint news
release.
</P>
<P>
Sprint is still pursuing a merger with WorldCom, said Sprint
spokesman Mark Bonavia.
</P>
<P>
The Justice Department suit and the companies' withdrawal came
a day after the European Union's antitrust chief said WorldCom and
Sprint had presented a less than satisfactory response to European
concerns that the merged company would dominate high-level
Internet access around the world.
</P>
<P>
The department, convinced the loss of one competitor as a
result of the proposed merger would reduce the scope of choices
open to consumers, noted that in the domestic long-distance market,
WorldCom's share amounts to 19 percent and Sprint's eight percent.
The combined share of WorldCom, Sprint and AT&AMP;T is about 80
percent.
</P>
<P>
The big three also have an 80 percent share of the market for
calls between the United States and more than 50 countries.
</P>
<P>
And in the market for Internet backbone services, according to
the government, WorldCom controls 37 percent and Sprint 16 percent.
</P>
<P>
WorldCom announced plans to acquire Sprint last October,
triggering an investigation by the Justice Department. The
government said this was the largest merger challenged by the
department.

<P>
LIMA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Peru and Ecuador are planning to
build 15 hydroelectric plants at the zone bordering both countries,
Peru's Minister of Energy and Mines Jorge Charmot Sarmiento
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the installation of these stations on a 45,
000 kilometer radius forms part of the study to take advantage of
hydroelectric potential of binational bowls that Peruvian and
Ecuadorian technicians are carrying out.
</P>
<P>
Chamot said that the plan is intended to put in movement the
binational institutional framework to promote development projects
among border communities of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Chamot declared that to carry out this project, the presence of
World Bank or other finance institutions is indispensable because
its accomplishment with public funds would be too slow.
</P>
<P>
"Both countries are taking precautions, bearing in mind that
within the framework of stability and cooperation of 1998's Peace
Accord, an accelerated economic development and adequate use of
natural resources can be predicted," he added.

<HEADLINE> France, Germany Must Form E.U. Avant-garde, Chirac Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
 BERLIN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
stressed the importance of a Franco-German avant-garde in the
development and the reform of the European Union (E.U.).
</P>
<P>
In his speech to Germany's parliament in Berlin on Tuesday
Chirac called for a two-speed Europe Union aimed at deepening ties
among a minority of member states which wanted to join in the
European integration.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that Paris and Berlin should build a formal club
with a separate secretariat in the E.U. limited to these fast-
track members.
</P>
<P>
"This group will play the role of a pioneer ...,"said Chirac
in his speech. He added : "It must stay open to all which want to
join it."
</P>
<P>
France will take over the rotating precedency of the E.U. from
July 1, on. During its presidency France will further promote the
deepening and enlargement of the E.U.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's speech to Germany's parliament has underscored the
Franco-German axis and the new Franco-German avant-garde role in
the E.U. And the new Franco-German avant-garde should be formed in
2001 and boost economic cooperation, strengthen defense planning
and expand the crime fighting links.
</P>
<P>
As two major states of the E.U. France and Germany need to
strengthen further their already close ties in all side in order
to ensure E.U.'s development in the new century.
</P>
<P>
"Only (France and Germany) can bring Europe forward regardless
of whether this is realizing its goals; expanding its borders; or
anchoring its heart...,"stressed Chirac.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer had offered his
proposal about a key Europe in his speech at Humboldt University
on May 12, but Chirac had not mentioned it.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France recognized Germany as a global great
power and backed fully Germany's efforts to gain a permanent seat
in the United Nations Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Faced with more complicated world Chirac called for
strengthening the bilateral ties between France and Germany.
Chirac said that the E.U. needed to agree on what Europe's
geographic limits were; make moves toward a full-blown European
constitution and bolster E.U. democratic controls.
</P>
<P>
France and Germany were deadly enemy each other before the end
of the World War II. After the war the reconciliation between
France and Germany had been realized. On January 22 1963 France
and the former Federal Republic of Germany signed the Franco-
German Cooperative Treaty and the consultative mechanism was set
up from then on. The Franco-German bilateral relation had been
gone through de Gaulle-Adenauer times in the sixties, D'Estaining-
Schmidt times in the seventies, Mitterand-Kohl times and Chirac-
Kohl times in the eighties and the nineties. The famous Paris-Bonn
axis was the core of the development of Europe in the past.
</P>
<P>
Chirac pointed out that France and Germany had fought three
big wars from 1870 to 1945 and both didn't hope a new war would
break out in the future.
</P>
<P>
"I belong to those who always hoped Germany would be unified
and get back its old capital," said Chirac.He is the first head of
state to make speech in the German Reichstag since the German
government moved from Bonn to Berlin last year.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of France the E.U. will carry out the
institutional reforms. A so-called inter-governmental conference (
IGC) is due to be held.
</P>
<P>
The main goals of IGC include a shift to more majority voting
in the E.U. as opposed to the current system of national votes;
limiting future growth of the 20-member executive European
Commission to prevent it enlarging even further.
</P>
<P>
According to the E.U. leaders the E.U. will expand from
January 1, 2003, but in fact the first new members can not be
admitted into the E.U. before 2005 or 2006.
</P>
<P>
The E.U. leaders had not set a deadline for receiving the
first new members states at Feira summit last week.

<HEADLINE> AIDS Death Rates Rise in Hard-Hit Regions: U.N. Report  </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The latest report on the global HIV epidemic says that in Sub-
Saharan African countries where 15 percent of all adults are
infected, no fewer than a third of today's 15 year-olds will die
of the disease.
</P>
<P>
Girls in the region face infection rates that are typically two
to three times higher than those of boys, it added.
</P>
<P>
Fallout from the AIDS crisis is changing population structures
in ways that will rip the social and economic fabric, according to
the report released by the Joint U.N. Program on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS).
</P>
<P>
A total of 13.2 million children have lost their mother or both
parents to the disease since the epidemic began.
</P>
<P>
The report stressed that whole generations of teachers have
been devastated by AIDS, which is straining public health systems
to their limits, partly because health care workers themselves are
dying of the disease.
</P>
<P>
The report was released in advance of the XIII International
AIDS Conference to be held in Durban, South Africa, from 9 to 14
July.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Seals off Border to Prevent Grain Smuggling </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Tanzanian government is
sealing off the border to prevent the smuggling of grain to
drought-hit neighboring countries as hundreds of thousands of
Tanzanians are facing an imminent shortage of food.
</P>
<P>
According to government officials, scores of border towns and
villages in northern Tanzanian regions, once safe heavens for
food-smuggling operations, have now become areas deliberately
avoided by the illegal merchants.
</P>
<P>
Daniel Njoolay, the Regional Commissioner of the northern
Arusha Region, told the official Daily News on Tuesday that there
will be an estimated shortage of 700,000 tons of grain between now
and the end of next year in Tanzania.
</P>
<P>
Njoolay said that the government is closely following the
supply of food to border towns to ensure that unscrupulous
businessmen do not over-supply the commodity which could later end
up in the markets of neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"Members of the public have now been allowed to make arrests on
 smugglers at areas where law enforcers are absent, and the people
are highly motivated to stamp out the food-smuggling operations,"
said the official.
</P>
<P>
When moving budget estimates last month, Prime Minister
Frederick Sumaye told the parliament that the country is likely to
face an acute shortage of some 680,840 tons of grain in the
2000/2001 financial year due to begin in July.
</P>
<P>
The premier attributed the looming food deficit to a prolonged
dry spell in many parts of the country and urged citizens to stock
surplus food.
</P>
<P>
However, despite the worrying food situation, recent reports
from northern Tanzanian regions have it that illegal traders have
been smuggling several tons of food every day to drought-hit
Kenya.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Commends International Aid in Biodiversity Conservation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian government on Tuesday
commended the international financial institution Global
Environmental Facility for providing 4.5 million U.S. dollars to
the Southern Africa Biodiversity Support Program (SABSP).
</P>
<P>
Environment and Natural Resources Permanent Secretary, Jewette
Masinja, said that the money was provided through the United
Nations Development Program when he opened the national planning
workshop for the SABSP program in Lusaka on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Masinja said that the SABSP program is expected to promote the
conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity in Southern
Africa by strengthening regional biodiversity planning, interstate
cooperation and information exchange.
</P>
<P>
He noted that although the Southern African region was endowed
with biodiversity of global significance, most of it was highly
threatened due to various regional and local pressures.
</P>
<P>
Masinja said the SABSP program is such an initiative which is
aimed at fostering regional cooperation in order to enhance
biodiversity conservation and management.
</P>
<P>
He added that the SABSP program would ultimately catalyze and
sustain economic growth which remained a policy priority for all
SADC (Southern African Development Community) countries.

<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The three-month nationwide
referendum campaign by the ruling Ugandan National Resistance
Movement concluded Tuesday afternoon with a public rally in the
capital Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the rally, Ugandan President and Ugandan National
Movement Conference Chairman Yoweri Museveni urged the people of
Uganda to vote for the Movement, saying that his government has
achieved positive performance since it came to power in 1986.
</P>
<P>
The achievements of the Movement has convinced Ugandans that it
will ably tackle the remaining tasks facing the nation, said
Museveni.
</P>
<P>
The Movement administration has caused fundamental changes in
the country's economic and social sectors in the past 14 years,
said Museveni, referring to the progress in the education, health,
telecommunications and infrastructure fields.
</P>
<P>
More than 10.5 million out of 20 million Ugandans will vote in
the June 29 referendum to choose a political system between the
Multiparty System and the Movement System.
</P>
<P>
It is widely believed that the Movement, which claims it is a
"non- political-party" system, will win in the referendum.
</P>
<P>
More than 75 observers from local independent organizations,
foreign countries and regional organizations will monitor the
referendum and ensure it transparent and fair.

<HEADLINE> UAE Demanded Enactment of Laws to Combat Hackers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates (UAE)
authorities have been urged to draft laws to punish Internet
hackers in this second-most wired country in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
The Emirates Centre for Strategic Studies and Research Centre
(ECSSR) on Tuesday released a Current News bulletin over the
disruptions of the UAE's Internet services recently, calling on the
authorities to take necessary measures.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin demanded that the judicial authorities keep pace
with the fast developments in information technology so as to be
able to deal with any sabotage aimed to hinder the smooth
functioning of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
It referred to the recent disruption of the country's Internet
services as a wake-up call of "the risks lurking in the dark,"
particularly at the time that Dubai was about to launch an e-
government and e-commerce program.
</P>
<P>
The bulletin urged the relevant authorities to coordinate with
foreign countries in finding ways of countering information
technology crimes.
</P>
<P>
Since last month, Internet users in the UAE have been
complaining about problems in accessing the international
information highway as their computers get no response from the
server of the Emirates Telecommunication Corporation (Etisalat),
which have authenticated the users' names and passwords.
</P>
<P>
Then, 21-year-old Briton, Lee Ashurst, a computer network
technician in a Dubai-based construction company, was officially
arrested recently on suspicion of hacking the Etisalat, the UAE's
sole telecom service provider, while similar online attacks are
still going on.
</P>
<P>
It was reportedly the first case in the UAE and also the Gulf
Arab region that a person was arrested on hacking charges.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliament Kills Early Election Bill in First Reading </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Israel's Knesset (parliament)
Tuesday afternoon vetoed in the first reading a motion proposed by
opposition parties calling for dissolving the 15th parliament and
holding early elections.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-seven legislators, including 17 of the once rebellious
coalition partner Shas party, voted against the bill while 32 voted
for it, televised Knesset session showed.
</P>
<P>
The veto will give Prime Minister Ehud Barak his most wanted
internal stability of his government and more political room to
push forward peace talks with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The motion, submitted by Knesset member Avigdor Lieberman from
National Union-Yisrael Beiteinu and Silvan Shalom from the major
opposition Likud party, was approved by a vote of 61-48 in its
preliminary reading on June 7.
</P>
<P>
In that voting, the oppositions got great help from 17 Knesset
members from the ultra-Orthodox religious Shas party, five members
from the National Religious Party, and four members from the
Yisrael Ba'aliya party. All three parities are partners of Barak's
ruling coalition.
</P>
<P>
Even worse, four cabinet ministers from Shas submitted their
resignation letter last Tuesday amid Shas' warning to quit the
coalition government.
</P>
<P>
Barak managed to persuade the rebellious party to retract its
resignation last Thursday after he satisfied most of Shas' demands,
including funding allocations for its ailing education network,
legalizing its pirate radio stations, letting Shas have a say in
the peace process with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
In exchange, the party, which is the biggest partner of Barak's
One Israel in the coalition cabinet, agreed to vote against the
early election bill in the Knesset.
</P>
<P>
With the support of Shas, the government succeeded in pushing
Knesset's Constitution, Law and Justice Committee to approve a
recommendation to the Knesset plenary the dismissal of the bill
Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
Two votes from Shas members in the committee were pivotal, as
the recommendation was approved by a majority of eight to six.
</P>
<P>
According to Israeli law, since the bill is dismissed, the
oppositions should wait at least six months before they could table
a similar one asking for early elections, unless Knesset Speaker
Avraham Burg concluded that a substantive change has occurred in
the circumstances.
</P>
<P>
It will boost Barak's morale and confidence in the negotiations
with the Palestinians for reaching a framework deal and a final
accord by September to solve those thorny issues between them, such
as the fate of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish settlements,
border, security and water.
</P>
<P>
United States Secretary of State Madeleine Albright just arrived
in Israel Tuesday evening to prepare for a possible three-way
summit between Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S.
President Bill Clinton in Washington early July.
</P>
<P>
It is hoped that in such a summit, Barak and Arafat will have
chances to bridge the remaining gaps. Barak reportedly hoped to put
the coalition crisis and the early-election bill behind him before
traveling to Washington.

<HEADLINE> Arab League, UNHCR Sign Pact on Cooperation in Refugee Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League and the Office of the
United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) on Tuesday
signed an agreement on promoting cooperation in handling refugee
issues, Egypt's Middle East News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was inked in Geneva by Arab League Secretary-
General Esmat Abdel-Meguid and U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees
Sadako Ogata. Abdel-Meguid was in Geneva to attend a multilateral
conference on social development.
</P>
<P>
The pact underlined the importance of cooperation between the
two organizations in protecting refugees and redressing their
problems, the news agency said.
</P>
<P>
It stipulated that each side may request assistance from the
other when it has difficulties in dealing with refugee issues.
</P>
<P>
As part of the deal, each side would invite the other to take
part, as an observer, in meetings discussing refugee issues.
</P>
<P>
The pan-Arab forum and the U.N. agency will exchange documents,
data and reports on policies and operations related to refugees.
</P>
<P>
The two sides reiterated support for the U.N. Relief Works
Agency for Palestinian Refugees in the Near East to continue
offering help to Palestinian refugees in Jordan, Syria, Lebanon,
the West Bank and Gaza Strip until a just solution is hammered out
to their problems under the relevant U.N. resolutions.
</P>
<P>
Millions of Palestinians have been reduced to refugees in the
Arab-Israeli conflicts since 1948. The Palestinian National
Authority and Israel are negotiating a settlement of the issue,
among other things, in their final-status talks.

<HEADLINE> Denktash's Participation in New Round of Cyprus Talks Uncertain </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf
Denktash here on Tuesday cast doubt again over his participation in
the third round of U.N.-sponsored Cyprus talks, the Cyprus News
Agency said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking after a meeting with U.S. Presidential Emissary for
Cyprus Alfred Moses in the Turkish Cypriot-controlled part of the
capital, Denktash said he "does not know if there will be a third
round of talks or not."
</P>
<P>
He thanked Moses for his visit but refrained from replying to
press questions.
</P>
<P>
Moses, who is accompanied by U.S. State Department Special
Coordinator for Cyprus Thomas Weston, said he had "a good talks, a
frank and intense talks" with Denktash.
</P>
<P>
"Hopefully, it will turn out to be a productive talks," he said,
adding that he was looking forward to being in Geneva for the
talks.
</P>
<P>
He added, however, that he could not say for certain whether the
Greek and Turkish Cypriot sides would be in Geneva too. "I cannot
speak on behalf of the two sides," he said.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek and Turkish Cypriot
communities since 1974 when Turkey invaded and occupied the
northern third of the island after a failed coup seeking union with
Athens.
</P>
<P>
Two rounds of United Nations-sponsored indirect talks have been
held so far between the two communities in a bid to pave the way
for substantive negotiations to reach a settlement in Cyprus.
However, no significant achievements have been made so far.
</P>
<P>
Moses arrived here Monday on a three-day visit to prepare the
ground for the third round of talks.
</P>
<P>
Earlier Tuesday, Moses met with President Glafcos Clerides.
</P>
<P>
In a short statement after the meeting at the Presidential
Palace, Moses said the United States "looks forward to the meeting
of the representatives of the two sides in Geneva on July 5."

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Protests Exclusion from Security Council Meeting on Balkans </HEADLINE>

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Belgrade Tuesday lodged "
the strongest protest" with the United Nations over the exclusion
of the Yugoslav charge d'affaires to the United Nations, Vladislav
Jovanovic, from the Security Council meeting on the Balkans.
</P>
<P>
Jovanovic, who filed the protest, said that his country "has
more right than any other country to participate in the meeting of
the Security Council."
</P>
<P>
Yugoslavia, situated in the central part of the Balkans and a
signatory party and a guarantor of the Dayton-Paris Agreement,
signed agreement that paved the way for the international military
and civilian presence in Kosovo, a Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council, in heeding the proposal from the United
States, voted 7-4 with four abstentions to exclude Jovanovic from
the meeting. But the Council's decision was under fire from Russia
and China at the Security Council.
</P>
<P>
"My country was prevented even though it had an evident and a
very strong interest in its debate," Jovanovic said in a letter,
which is being distributed here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The rejection of the request of the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia is discriminatory and contrary to the principles of the
Charter of the United Nations," he said.

<P>
PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- France is opposed to the idea of
creating a ``caucus'' which is supposed to be dedicated to
democracy within the United Nations, as was suggested by the
United States at a conference on democracy held in Warsaw on
Monday and Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Agence France-Presse (AFP) quoted French ambassador to Poland,
Benoit d'Aboville, as saying that the delegations from 107
countries attending the conference did not approve such a specific
thing as the creation of a caucus for democracy within the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
The group is called ``community of democracies'' which would be
represented at the U.N. and other international institutions,
according to the U.S.-sponsored idea.
</P>
<P>
France was also the only attending country which refused to
sign a declaration on the universal value of democracy.
</P>
<P>
French officials said that the conference was supposed to be a
forum of debate rather than a program of action.
</P>
<P>
The conference was initiated by the United States and the
agenda to adopt a declaration on democracy was co-sponsored by
Poland and a number of other countries.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Hubert Vedrine Monday blamed some
Western countries for turning democracy into a religion which they
try to impose on others.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Calls for Faster European Political Integration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Tuesday called for an acceleration of European Union (EU)
political integration, including drafting a future European
Constitution and setting up a ``pioneer group'' whose members
realize faster and greater unification first.
</P>
<P>
In a speech to the German Parliament in the renovated Reichstag
in Berlin, Chirac said that some European countries should move
ahead with political and economic integration more quickly.
</P>
<P>
``Some countries which want to go further in the integration,
on a voluntary basis and with precise projects, could do it
without being delayed by those which don't wish to go as fast,''
said Chirac in his address to the German parliament deputies.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the declaration four days before France is due to
assume the six-month EU rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
He was also partly echoing a proposal made on May 12 by German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, who suggested that Europe adopt
a federal-style political structure with a constitution, a
directly elected executive, and a two-chamber parliament.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that he also agrees that someday European
governments and people should be asked to vote on whether to have
a European constitution or not.
</P>
<P>
But he said that neither France nor Germany want to have a
European``super-state'' and national sovereignty of nation states
as well as their role on the international scene should not be
changed.

Observers said that Chirac's speech marked a turning point in
renewing the traditional French-German locomotive for pushing
forward European integration.
</P>
<P>
The project can also leave some EU countries, such as Britain,
to the sideline of EU construction.
</P>
<P>
Chirac's view was reflected by a poll released on Monday in
France,which said that 70 percent of French people want European
political and economic integration to be accelerated.

<HEADLINE> Portugal Proposes Sanction-Lifting Way for Austria </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Portugal has proposed a way as
how to lift the current political sanctions against Austria, a
Belgian foreign ministry official said on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
An advisory group was proposed to be set up to examine Austria'
s recent records on human rights and to then report and recommend
to Austria's European Union partners whether to lift the sanctions
imposed against the country since early February.
</P>
<P>
The foreign minister of Belgium, a strong proponent for
sanctions against Austria, has agreed to the proposal raised by
Portugal that is holding the six-month rotating EU presidency.
</P>
<P>
The Portuguese presidency expires on June 30 and France,another
main proponent of sanctions against Austria, takes over on July 1.
</P>
<P>
The 14 other EU member states joined hands in launching a
political sanction against Austria on February 4 when the Austrian
coalition government that had incorporated the far-right Freedom
Party swore into office.
</P>
<P>
Austria became a center issue at the EU summit by heads of
state and government on June 19 and 20 at Santa Maria da Feira,
Portugal, where the Austrian Federal Chancellor Wolfgang Schussel
asked the country's EU partners to consider lifting the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
Some of the EU member states had suggested to consider lifting
the sanctions at the Feira summit but Portugal insisted that the
summit not discuss the issue of Austria.

<HEADLINE> Britain Sends More Troops to N.Ireland Before Marches </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Britain said on Tuesday that it was
sending 2,000 more troops into Northern Ireland to prevent any
possible violence during this Summer's volatile Protestant "
marching season".
</P>
<P>
Northern Ireland Secretary Peter Mandelson urged all the
province's paramilitary groups to make confidence-building
gestures following the Irish Republican Army's announcement on
Monday that it was opening its arms dumps to international
scrutiny, a Reuters report monitored here said.
</P>
<P>
"I want to see confidence-building gestures from all the
parties... from the paramilitaries," the report quoted Mandelson
as saying.
</P>
<P>
"Everyone has got to inject confidence into this process,
everyone has a responsibility to make sure people's trust (and)
faith is maintained," said Mandelson.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the British army, which has been reducing its
presence in the province, stressed that the soldiers being moved
from the mainland were not reinforcements but merely backup troops
still technically assigned to Northern Ireland.
</P>
<P>
"Troops are routinely deployed in the province when the
operational situation demands," a spokeswoman said.
</P>
<P>
"They form part of prudent contingency planning," she said.
</P>
<P>
Britain has this year trimmed its troop numbers in the province
to the lowest level in 30 years -- fewer than 13,500 --to help
foster Northern Ireland's fragile peace process.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Online Pharmaceutical, Health Market Expected to Grow </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. online market for
pharmaceutical, health and beauty products will explode from less
than 250 million U.S. dollars in 1999 to more than 18 billion
dollars, an American market research firm reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Online prescription drugs will account for more than 80 percent
of these revenues, or 14.8 billion dollars, said the report from
International Data Corporation (IDC).
</P>
<P>
"Consumers are increasingly accepting the Internet as a way to
access health-related information and content," IDC said. "In
addition, powerful drug industry players, including managed care
organizations and prescription benefit managers, are developing
ecommerce strategies. As a result, the growth of this market will
accelerate substantially over the next five years."
</P>
<P>
IDC said that payer organizations, typically prescription
benefit managers and managed care organizations, will play a
significant role in the online pharmaceutical market. Because
payer organizations foot most of the bill for prescriptions, they
are highly motivated to reduce cost. IDC estimates one-third of
the cost of prescriptions comes from pharmacy fulfillment. To
reduce fulfillment costs, many payer organizations use mail-order
prescriptions and will look to further reduce fulfillment cost by
investing in online fulfillment. By 2004, payer organizations will
account for 14.2 billion dollars, or 96 percent of the online
prescription market.
</P>
<P>
Other factors that IDC believes will contribute to the boom in
online prescription sales include the overall increase in
prescription medicine spending and the aging of the U.S.
population.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Consumer Confidence Drops Sharply In June </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. consumer confidence
index declined six points in June, the Conference Board, a
prominent research group, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board said in a survey that the index now stands
at 138.8 in June from a revived 144.7 in May.
</P>
<P>
"While latest signals suggest that U.S. economic activity
should decelerate in coming months, consumers are not expecting
this record-breaking economic expansion to end any time soon,"
says Lynn Franco, Director of the Conference Board's Consumer
Research Center.
</P>
<P>
But Consumers are now much less optimistic about future
conditions that they were in May, the survey said, adding that the
proportion anticipating conditions to worsen climbed to 6.2
percent in June, up from 4.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The percentage of consumers expecting an improvement in
business conditions fell to 18.4 percent from 18.6 percent last
month, the survey added.
</P>
<P>
The job outlook is also less favorable, according to the survey.
The percentage of consumers expecting more jobs to become
available in the coming months declined to 18.4 percent from 19.6
percent in May and those expecting fewer jobs to become available
rose to 11.7 percent from 10.1 percent, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
The survey also said, income prospects were considerable less
optimistic than in the prior survey. Now, only 23.8 percent of
respondents anticipate an increase in their incomes, down from 27.
6 percent in May.
</P>
<P>
The survey came when the Federal Reserve began a two-day
meeting on the Monetary policy. It raised expectation that
interest rates will remain unchanged at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rates six times since last June
in an effort to cool off the U.S. economy and keep inflation
under control.
</P>
<P>
The index, based on a monthly survey of some 5,000 households,
is closely watched because consumer spending makes up about two-
thirds of the nation's economic activity.

<HEADLINE> East Timor Expected to Hold Elections in 2001 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Briefing the U.N. Security Council on East Timor, U.N. Under-
Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs Sergio Vieira de Mello
said he made the prediction after discussions with East Timorese
political leaders led by Xanana Gusmao.
</P>
<P>
"I fell safe in predicting that elections and possibly
independence will take place next year at some point between 30
August and the beginning of December 2001," said de Mello, who is
also U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan's special representative
for East Timor.
</P>
<P>
De Mello said capacity building in East Timor should embrace
both the technical level and the level of political leadership.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. is of the view that "the East Timorese should not only
staff the administration and government but also take political
responsibility for it," he said.
</P>
<P>
East Timor, with a population of some 800,000, was a Portuguese
colony for more than 400 years. In 1976, it was integrated into
Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
On August 30, 1999, over 400,000 East Timorese took part in a U.
N.-sponsored ballot and overwhelmingly voted for independence.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Transitional Administration in East Timor headed by de
Mello, was set up in October last year to take charge of all
affairs in the territory until the transition is completed.

<HEADLINE> Lithuanian President Says No to Bill on Russia'Compensation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Lithuanian President Valdas Adamkus
on Tuesday declined to endorse a bill on Russia's compensation for
damages by Soviet Occupation during the World War II, adopted by
the Lithuanian parliament, reported Russian news agencies.
</P>
<P>
However, this does not mean the bill will not come into effect,
Interfax cited the president's aide for legal issues Armanas
Abramavicius as saying.
</P>
<P>
Under the Lithuanian Constitution, if the president does not
sign a law, approved by the parliament, within ten days since he
has received it, this law can come into effect if the chairman of
the parliament signs it.
</P>
<P>
Thus, Adamkus, who criticized the policy of the ruling majority
in relation to Russia, did not risk vetoing this law and violating
the guidelines of the 1992 referendum in the former Soviet
republic, said Abramavicius.
</P>
<P>
All responsibility for adopting and enacting the law, which has
caused Moscow's negative reaction, will therefore fall on its
initiator, chairman of the Lithuanian parliament Vytautas
Landsbergis,observers say.
</P>
<P>
By the referendum, Russia is demanded to and must compensate
for the damages caused by the Soviet occupation to Lithuania.
</P>
<P>
Under the decision of the referendum, before September 1 this
year,the government of Lithuania must form a delegation "for
negotiations with Russia on the compensation for the damages by
the Soviet occupation," and before October 1, the amount of the
damages must be specified.
</P>
<P>
By November 1, the delegation should claim to Moscow the amount
of compensations, inform the UN, the Council for Europe and the
European Union about it, initiate negotiations and have Russia
compensate the Lithuanian victims and the Lithuanian state.

HARARE, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Southern African Development
Community (SADC) Parliamentary Forum Observer Mission Tuesday
commended the people of Zimbabwe for turning up in large numbers
to cast their votes in the parliamentary election at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
The mission said in a statement that "it is evident of the
commitment of Zimbabweans to participate in running their
affairs."
</P>
<P>
"We view it as a sign of determination and commitment on the
part of Zimbabwean voters to exercise their rights to choose their
members of Parliament and the leadership of the country," it said.
</P>
<P>
The mission regretted that a number of voters were turned away
from polling stations because their names were not appearing on
the voters' roll despite claims that they had been registered.
</P>
<P>
"We are equally pleased and relieved that, on the whole, voting
has been orderly and peaceful throughout the country," it said.
</P>
<P>
The mission said a peaceful atmosphere should be extended to
other SADC countries during times of elections and urged
Zimbabweans to stand together to maintain and build peace.

"As a SADC regional institution whose constitutions are
committed to peace and democracy, we do not take sides," said the

<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Africa has the largest number
of AIDS sufferers and the situation would get worse if effective
measures were not taken, the United Nations said in a report
issued on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Last year 5.4 million people globally were infected with the
virus bringing the number of those living with the disease to 34.3
million, according to the report, which was available here.
</P>
<P>
Of the more than 24 million HIV/AIDS sufferers in sub-Saharan
Africa, 4. 2 million live in South Africa. Between 20 and 25
percent of the adult populations in Zimbabwe and South Africa are
also said to be infected.
</P>
<P>
According to the report, about half of all 15-year-old boys in
the two countries will die at some stage of AIDS. In Botswana
about one-third of the adults are already HIV infected, which is
the highest prevalence rate in the world.
</P>
<P>
The report warned that the virus and poverty were synonymous
and urged industrialized nations to write off debt of developing
countries.
</P>
<P>
Because of AIDS, poverty was getting worse just as the need for
more resources to curb the spread of HIV and alleviate the
epidemic's impact on development was growing, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"It's time to make the connection between debt relief and
epidemic relief," it said.
</P>
<P>
"African governments are paying out four times more in debt
service then they now spend on health and education.
</P>
<P>
"If the international community relieves some of their external
debt, these countries can reinvest the savings in poverty
alleviation and AIDS prevention and care," said the report.
</P>
<P>
"If not, poverty will just continue to fan the flames of the
epidemic," it said.

<HEADLINE> Nigerian President Allays Investors' Fears in Norway </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Nigerian President Olusegun
Obasanjo, on the first official visit to Norway, has assured
prospective international investors in Oslo that the recent crises
in Nigeria would not jeopardize their investments, the Nigerian
press reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At a joint press conference held Monday with his host Prime
Minister Jens Stoltenberg, Obasanjo said that the crises were a
product of long years of militarization of governance in the
country during which crucial matters on the people's welfare and
well-being were ignored.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the oppressive years of military
regimes had swept crucial issues under the carpet while the people
had become despondent, stressing that now with a democratic
government, such suppressed agitations were being expressed in
their most violent manner.
</P>
<P>
He said: "There is a great need of understanding here. I mean
we have to put the matter in its right perspective. Nigerians
have been under the heavy boot (of the military) over the years.
It is like a lid being yanked off a boiling kettle. You should
expect it to produce a bubble.
</P>
<P>
"So, most of the hiccups you have read to have taken place in
the country should not be seen as potential dangers to our
development efforts. They should be appreciated in that light.
There is no cause for alarm; we are quite right on track; we are
on the right path."
</P>
<P>
"Democracy has now enabled hitherto suppressed voices to come
up for hearing; it has strengthened our culture of dialogue. For
us in Nigeria, democracy is an imperative, not just a luxury
having tried all other systems."
</P>
<P>
During talks with the Norwegian Prime Minister whose Labour
Party formed a new government on March 17, President Obasanjo said
his administration was pursuing practical private sector
investment in the economy, especially in the communications, oil
and gas sectors which are prominent in Norway.
</P>
<P>
Norway is reputed as a leading nation in oil and gas deposits
which account for 30 percent of its total exports.

<P>
MAPUTO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Mozambican police have
dispersed a rally organized by the opposition Renamo in the
central port city of Beira, the country's leading newspaper
Noticias reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
According to the police, the Renamo rally, which coincided with
the nationwide celebrations of the 25th anniversary of Mozambican
independence, was intended to urge Beira residents to take actions
of civil disobedience, because of alleged fraud in the general
elections last December, which were won by the ruling Frelimo
party.
</P>
<P>
The Beira police stopped the rally, which was taking place on
Sunday morning in the Beira suburb of Munhava, on the grounds that
it had not been duly authorized.
</P>
<P>
Mozambican legislations on demonstrations and rallies in public
places stipulate that the authorities must be notified in writing
at least four days in advance.
</P>
<P>
The police claimed that Renamo had failed to do this because
their notification reached the Beira municipal authorities too
late.

for the African continent, which is most affected by AIDS.
</P>
<P>
"We are confident that the world will recognize the importance
of hosting this conference in a developing country," conference
chairman Professor Hoosen Coovadia said in a statement issued here
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
The conference will be officially opened by South African
President Thabo Mbeki in Durban on the evening of July 9 and
closed by former president Nelson Mandela on July 14, said the

</P>
<P>
"Over 90 percent of the world's population affected by HIV live
in developing countries," Coovadia said, adding that over 4
million South Africans are living with HIV/AIDS and there are more
than 1,700 new infections occurring daily in this country.
</P>
<P>
Among those attending the upcoming conference will be
government delegations, non-governmental organizations as well as
pharmaceutical companies, according to the statement.

<P>
LUANDA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Guinea-Bissau President Kumba Iala
has ordered the release of a group of Senegalese merchants who
were seized by the Guinean civilians near the two country's
border, said reports reaching here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Senegalese, whose number was not immediately made public,
were captured in reprisal for the recent detention of Guinean
farmers by the Senegalese troops.
</P>
<P>
According to the president, the group of Senegalese have been
freed in the northern town of Guidadje "in the name of peace and
good neighborliness" .
</P>
<P>
He said that he would ask the Senegalese President Aboudoulay
Wade to intervene to free the Guinean prisoners, according to the
reports.
</P>
<P>
The Senegalese troops detained 17 Guinean peasants who had
crossed the border, apparently on suspicions that they were
supporters of the separatist Casamance guerrilla movement in
Senegal.
</P>
<P>
The separatist struggle in the border region has strained
relations between Bissau and Dakar.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Import Grain in Coming Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique will have to import
about 444,000 tons of grain from now to April, 2001, to cover the
deficit in national production, mainly caused by the flood that
hit the southern and central regions of the country in February
and March.
</P>
<P>
The country's leading newspaper Noticias Tuesday quoted sources
in the government's domestic trade directorate as saying that
because of lower production this year, the country will have to
import, as food aid or commercially, 144,000 tons of maize,
242,000 tons of rice and 194,000 tons of wheat.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Mozambique has produced a maize surplus, and
there were high hopes that the country could also become
self-sufficient in rice.
</P>
<P>
However, the devastation caused in the country's main rice
growing area, at Chokwe in the Limpopo valley, has dashed these
hopes.
</P>
<P>
This year, Mozambique's total rice production is about 75,000
tons, but the requirements are put at over 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by the agriculture ministry, this year's
maize production is around 1.16 million, but the needs are put at
1.31 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Imports of wheat are quite normal in Mozambique, since this is
a crop not favored by the country's climate, so urban tastes for
bread can only be satisfied through imports.

<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Erastus Mwencha, secretary-general
of the Common Market for Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA),
Tuesday called for a closer relationship between China and African
countries.
</P>
<P>
"We believe strongly that we must develop closer links, we have
so much to talk about together and we believe it's high time for
us to talk to China," said Mwencha in an exclusive interview with
Xinhua here Tuesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
"For us in Africa," he said: "We have looked at China with keen
interest because China is a model of development to us and because
China has a number of similar challenges that face us."
</P>
<P>
"There is a tremendous potential for us to develop trade with
China because China has the capacity to provide a good market for
products from Africa, and China can invest in such sectors as
transport, telecommunications, manufacturing, energy, agriculture
and even human resource development in Africa," he said.
</P>
<P>
Mwencha said: "China has assisted African countries in many
ways and for a long time, for example, in the development of
social sector, education, transport, sports and so on," stressing
"that help was critical in time because nobody was ready to help
us then."
</P>
<P>
According to Mwencha, China and Africa should not only maintain
a mechanism to have a regular exchange of social and economic
ideas at the ministerial level, they should also, in the long run,
create a summit for the heads of state and government from both
sides to increase mutual understanding and promote bilateral
cooperation.

<TEXT>
<P>
RAMALLAH, West Bank, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat Tuesday received Chinese representative to the
Palestinian National Authority (PNA) Wu Jiuhong and briefed him on
latest developments in the Mideast peace process.
</P>
<P>
Arafat told Wu that the Palestinian-Israeli negotiations were
embroiled in a cul-de-sac and faced with stupendous obstacles due
to the Israeli failure to abide by the signed bilateral agreements
and international resolutions pertaining to the Palestinian issue.
</P>
<P>
Arafat thanked China for its longtime support for the
Palestinian cause and the Middle East peace process, expressing the
hope that China would play a more active role in pushing the peace
process forward and bringing the frozen Israeli-Palestinian
negotiations to a close.
</P>
<P>
During the talks, Wu noted that China has been supporting and
backing up the peace process in general and the Palestinian cause
in particular, reiterating that China feels extremely concerned
over the stalemate in which the bilateral negotiations have been
locked.
</P>
<P>
He further urged the Israeli and Palestinian parties to observe
self-restraint and head off any hostile statements or misconduct,
hoping that the parties concerned would abide by the signed accords
and international resolutions as well as the land-for-peace
principle so as to put a stop to the current stalemate as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
China is willing to seize all opportunities to boost and bolster
the peace process, he added.

<HEADLINE> Albright Arrives in Israel to Assess Conditions for Three-way Summit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright landed in Israel Tuesday evening and began her evaluation
on the possibility of a peace summit between the Palestinians,
Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Such a summit, which is planned to take place in Washington
early July between U.S. President Bill Clinton, Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak and Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, is aiming
at reviving the stagnant Israeli-Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Albright is scheduled to meet Barak late Tuesday night and with
Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy Wednesday morning. After that,
she will travel to the Palestinian self-rule areas to consult with
Arafat. Then, she is due to hold talks with Barak again before
leaving for Berlin early Thursday morning.
</P>
<P>
Barak had promoted a three-way summit for breaking the deadlock
in the talks with the Palestinians after the latest round of such
talks in Washington earlier this month ended without tangible
progress.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister believed the gaps between the two sides could
only be bridged in a Camp David-style summit, like that Leaders of
the United States, Egypt and Israel held in Camp David in 1978,
during which the first peace treaty between an Arab country and the
Jewish state was hammered out.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, the Palestinians estimated that in the current
climate, a three-way summit will only end in failure, because there
are too many disputes unresolved over so-called final-status
issues, such as the fate of Jerusalem, Palestinian refugees, Jewish
settlements, border, security and water.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are also wide apart over interim issues, according
to Palestinian officials, such as the final Israeli troops
withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, releasing more
Palestinian refugees, opening a northern safe passage between the
Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
For the United States, it is reported that President Clinton,
who had been the most ardent Middle East peace sponsor during his
tenure, would like to broker a final Israeli-Palestinian peace deal
before the September deadline, or at least before he leaves the
White House early next year.
</P>
<P>
However, still remembering the botched Geneva summit with late
Syrian President Hafez al-Assad in March, which failed to reopen
the Israeli-Syrian peace track, Clinton wanted to be one hundred
percent sure that another summit will not give him another bitter
experience.
</P>
<P>
That's the reason why he dispatched Albright to the Middle East,
her second visit in the region in three weeks. Israel media
reported that Albright will muscle the Palestinians into a three-
way summit during her visit here.
</P>
<P>
Albright will also be briefed by U.S. Middle East special envoy
Dennis Ross, who had been in the region since last Thursday, about
the preparation for such a summit.
</P>
<P>
If she is convinced finally that the condition is ripe for
holding the summit, she will report to Clinton when she returns.
Then, the president will announce a final date for such a summit,
most possibly on July 5 or July 7, after the U.S. Independence Day.

<HEADLINE> Chittagong Mayor Proposes to Build Self-Financed Terminal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Mayor of Chittagong City
Corporation (CCC) has put forward an alternative proposal for
building a private container terminal under a self-financed
project of the CCC, the United News of Bangladesh reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a post-budget press conference in Chittagong Tuesday,
Mayor A.B.M. Mohiuddin Chowdhury said if the government permits,
the CCC would construct the terminal in Patenga-Fauzdarhat area.
</P>
<P>
This is an alternative to the proposal of U.S. company
Stevidoring Services of American (SSA) which is going to make a
deal shortly with the government to construct a private container
terminal at Patenga near the sea port.
</P>
<P>
The mayor sought government's permission to build the terminal
with an approximate cost of 25 billion taka (481 million U.S.
dollars) under the same terms and conditions formulated for the U.
S. company.
</P>
<P>
The Chittagong mayor alleged that the proposed SSA terminal
would threaten the Chittagong port and lead to increased smuggling.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of an alliance of 22 trade union bodies of Chittagong
Port representing some 20,000 dock workers have threatened to halt
all activities at Chittagong Port if any agreement is signed with
SSA.
</P>
<P>
They have recently launched a series of agitation programs
against the SSA proposal, including mass hunger strike, rally of
workers and demonstration.

TOKYO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A signing ceremony marking China's

<HEADLINE> Telecommunication in Parts of China Disrupted by Solar Motion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Short wave telecommunication in
parts of China was disrupted due to solar motion this morning,
scientists said.
</P>
<P>
According to an official source, the short wave
telecommunication connection from Manzhouli in northeast China to
Xinxiang in Central China stopped from 8 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., and
the connection from east China's Qingdao to Xinxiang also came to
a halt during the same period.
</P>
<P>
Experts said that "coronal holes" on the solar surface caused
the trouble. Coronal holes, like sun spots, are a form of solar
activity.
</P>
<P>
"A storm of electrified hydronium will erupt when coronal holes
appear on the solar surface, and this will influence the earth's
ionosphere," said Suo Yucheng, a local researcher of electric wave
radiation.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of this month, telecommunications in China
have been repeatedly interrupted by solar storms.
</P>
<P>
Scientists have warned that the solar motion is now in a peak
period, one that occurs every 11 years, and the solar wind will
have some effect on power supplies and communications systems on
earth.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique to Import Grain in Coming Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Mozambique will have to import
about 444,000 tons of grain from now to April, 2001, to cover the
deficit in national production, mainly caused by the flood that
hit the southern and central region's domestic trade directorate as saying that
because of lower production this year, the country will have to
import, as food aid or commercially, 144,000 tons of maize,
242,000 tons of rice and 194,000 tons of wheat.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Mozambique has produced a maize surplus, and
there were high hopes that the country could also become
self-sufficient in rice.
</P>
<P>
However, the devastation caused in the country's main rice
growing area, at Chokwe in the Limpopo vallput at over 300,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
According to estimates by the agriculture ministry, this year's
maize production is around 1.16 million, but the needs are put at
1.31 million tons.
</P>
<P>
Imports of wheat are quite normal in Mozambique, since this is
a crop not favored by the country's climate, so urban tastes for
bread can only be satisfied through imports.

<HEADLINE> British Firms Short of Skilled Employees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- One in every four employers in
Britain is unable to find workers to fill job vacancies because
applicants lack basic skills, according to a research report
published by the government Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The research conducted by the national Skills Task Force backs
up a previous research report suggesting that nearly one in every
five adults -- about seven million -- have a lower level of
literacy than the average 11 years old.
</P>
<P>
Low-skilled adults must get a chance of retraining to acquire
necessary qualifications for jobs in the burgeoning computer and
hi-tech industry, it says.
</P>
<P>
Among its findings obtained through a telephone survey of 23,
000 employers and face-to-face interviews with 4,000 bosses,
respondents claimed almost 2 million of their staff were not fully
proficient in doing their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Chris Humphries, Chairman of the task force, said: "Skill
shortages are impacting on firms' ability to compete, and act as a
drain on business productivity."
</P>
<P>
The research also predicts continuing strong demand for
specialists in the areas of information and communications
technology, with the IT sector expected to recruit more than half
a million people in the next 10 years.
</P>
<P>
A report by the task force will be presented to the Education
and Employment Department together with recommendations on how to
improve the situation.

<P>
MOSCOW, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking delegation of the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) paid a brief visit to
Moscow on Tuesday to prepare for Russian President Vladimir
Putin's upcoming trip to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
The delegation, comprising DPRK Supreme People's Assembly
Chairman Choe Tae Bok, President of the Presidium of the assembly
Kim Yong Nam, Foreign Minister Paek Nam Sun, Culture Minister Kang
Nun Su and other senior officials, made a one-hour stopover in
Moscow en route to Syria, for an informal meeting with Russian
Deputy Foreign Minister Alexander Losyukov, Russian diplomatic
sources said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides discussed concrete questions related to
preparations for Putin's upcoming visit to the DPRK and the
situation on the Korean Peninsula after the recent historic inter-
Korean summit in Pyongyang, capital of the DPRK, said the sources.
</P>
<P>
In early June, the Kremlin announced that Putin will pay a
working visit to the DPRK on July 19 following a stop in Beijing,
China, en route to Japan' Okinawa to attend the G-8 summit slated
for July 21-23.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, Russian Foreign Ministry said South Korean Foreign
Affairs and Trade Minister Lee Young Binn will pay an official
visit to Moscow on June 28-29 to prepare for Putin's visit to
Seoul, and Putin confirmed last week his intention to visit the
South Korea in the near future after the planned trip to Pyongyang.
</P>
<P>
Russia has repeatedly expressed its readiness to participate in
meetings of various formats aimed at solving the Korean issue and
to enhance the political dialogue on the peninsula, especially
after the ice-breaking summit between DPRK leader Kim Jong Il and
South Korean President Kim Dae Jung in Pyongyang earlier this
month.

<HEADLINE> Upgrade of World's Largest Highland Railway Network in Full Swing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 27 (Xinhua) -- An unprecedented large-scale
upgrade of the railway network in southwest China's highlands is
in full swing.
</P>
<P>
The rail system winds through Sichuan, Guizhou and Yunnan
provinces and Chongqing Municipality on the Qinghai-Tibet and
Yunnan-Guizhou plateaus with a total length of 5,000 km, of which
one-fifth is tunnels and bridges.
</P>
<P>
"This is the largest railway transformation project in the
world. It ranks first both in the total length and in the number
of tunnels and bridges," said Zeng Jialiang, deputy director of
the Chengdu Railway Bureau.
</P>
<P>
China will spend 100 billion yuan (12 billion U.S. dollars) on
the project over the next 20 years. The entire 5,000 km of
railroads will be electrified and some 3,000 km of the rails will
be converted to double-track systems, said Liu Baorun, vice-
president of the Economic Planning Research Institute with the
Ministry of Railways.
</P>
<P>
Work on the double-track rail linking Baoji, a leading
industrial center in Shaanxi Province, with Chengdu, the capital
of Sichuan, and the electrified rail between Chengdu and Kunming,
capital of Yunnan Province, is expected to be completed this year.
</P>
<P>
The double-track between Zhuzhou in Hunan Province and
Liupanshui in Guizhou and the electrified rail connecting Neijiang
with Yibin both in Sichuan are expected to start operation in two
to five years.
</P>
<P>
Advanced technology and equipment, including those imported
from abroad, have been widely applied in the work. The 1,100-km-
long Chengdu-Kunming railway line, which runs through an area with
an average elevation of 3,000 meters, has been equipped with up-to-
date equipment including the integrated optical fiber, an axle
temperature monitoring system and the wireless transmission system.
</P>
<P>
Once it is finished, a modern highland railway network will
replace the irrationally distributed, old-fashioned, slow-speed
and transportation strained railway system in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The new rail network is to promote the development of
agriculture, mineral and water resources, tourism and energy in
southwest China and the rest of western China as well, said Zhang
Zerong, director of the Economic Research Institute under the
Sichuan Provincial Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
Improvement of the investment environment in southwest China
will attract more foreign investors to the region and help people
of the 30-odd ethnic minority groups in the region lead a better
life, he added.
</P>
<P>
Wu Kun, a native of Chongqing who works in Chengdu, has high
hopes for the Chengdu-Chongqing express railway section, which is
to cut the travel time between the two cities from 11 hours to two
and half hours.

<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Starting from this month, China
will cut its electricity capacity expansion fees by half,
according to a joint circular issued by the State Development
Planning Commission and the State Economic and Trade Commission.
</P>
<P>
The circular asked local electricity departments below the
provincial level to abolish their own standards for charging
capacity expansion fees and stop over-charging.
</P>

The current pricing standard, which became valid June 10, cuts
the previous capacity expansion fee in half. The collected fees

facilities, the circular said.
</P>
<P>
When the power grid construction and remodeling projects are
completed in 2010, China will stop charging such fees, it said.

<HEADLINE> Syrian Parliament Supports Bashar's Presidential Candidacy EDS-1st lead-writethru </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Syrian parliament on Tuesday
morning approved the nomination of Bashar al-Assad for the post of
president to succeed his late father, President Hafez al-Assad, who
died on June 10.
</P>
<P>
The parliament also set July 10 as the date for a referendum for
the country's nearly 7 million voters to decide whether Bashar will
be the new ruler. Bashar is expected to be the sole candidate in
the referendum.
</P>
<P>
The 250-member People's Assembly in its full session decided to
back Bashar's nomination by the ruling Baath party, which controls
most of the seats in the parliament.
</P>
<P>
On Sunday, a 70-member special committee of the parliament
already expressed its "total support" for Bashar's candidacy for
the presidency.
</P>
<P>
If approved in the referendum, which seems almost certain,
Bashar will serve as Syria's 16th president for a seven-year term.
He has already been appointed supreme commander of the armed forces
and was elected secretary of the Baath party's top policy-making
body at the end of the party's ninth conference last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
In its extraordinary session on June 10, hours after the death
of Hafez al-Assad, the parliament decided to amend the Constitution
to bring down the minimum age of presidential nominee from 40 to
34, paving the way for Bashar to step in for power.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Grenade Attack Greets Norwegian Envoy's Peace Mission to Sri Lanka  By Lian Guohui </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A Norwegian funded aid agency in
Sri Lanka's capital of Colombo was attacked by a grenade early on
Tuesday, hours after Oslo's special envoy arrived here to broker
peace amid an escalation of ethnic conflicts on the island.
</P>
<P>
Police said that a hand grenade was hurled at the office of
Save the Children in central Colombo in the early hours of Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
No one was hurt in the grenade blast, police said, adding that
only the window panes of the office and a vehicle's windshield had
been damaged.
</P>
<P>
Not one has yet claimed responsibility for the attack.
</P>
<P>
In a similar attack on May 24, a grenade was thrown at the
Norwegian Embassy in Colombo. The Norwegian Ambassador Jon
Westborg said at the time he believed the attack was connected to
his country's peace efforts.
</P>
<P>
It is interesting to note that last month's attack came hours
after Norway's Foreign Secretary Raymond Johansen and special
envoy Erik Solheim left Sri Lanka.
</P>
<P>
A group calling itself as National Front Against Tigers (NFAT)
claimed responsibility for the attack on the Norwegian Embassy.
</P>
<P>
Sri Lanka has been plagued by a 17-year ethnic civil war
between government troops and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam
(LTTE) rebels who are fighting for a separate homeland called
Eelam for minority Tamils in Sri Lanka's north and east.
</P>
<P>
President Chandrika Kumaratunga announced last December she had
asked the Norwegian government to help bring the LTTE rebels to
the peace negotiating table, but so far there has been no face-to-
face discussions between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
However, Norway has come under strong criticism from Sri Lanka'
s majority Sinhalese nationalist organizations. They have accused
the Norwegian government of being pro-LTTE and said Oslo must take
responsibility for bomb attacks carried out by LTTE rebels in Sri
Lanka.
</P>
<P>
Despite last month's attack, Norway's special envoy to Sri
Lanka Eric Solheim arrived here on Monday for a three-day visit to
hold fresh round of peace talks with President Kumaratunga, the
main opposition United National Party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe
and other leaders.
</P>
<P>
"He is here for consultations and meeting the same persons he
met during previous visits to Colombo," Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Ravinath Ariyasinha said.
</P>
<P>
Solheim on Monday met Minister for Justice and Constitutional
Affairs Prof G. L. Peiris in order to apprise himself with the
progress made by Kumaratunga and Wickremesinghe during their
numerous round of talks in Colombo since last month to finalize a
new draft constitution, which included proposals to grant autonomy
to Tamil dominated north and eastern province.
</P>
<P>
He is scheduled to meet President Kumaratunga on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Solheim is due to leave for New Delhi on June 29 to apprise the
Indian leaders about his talks with the Sri Lankan officials and
the LTTE. India has supported Norway's attempts to bring the two
parties to the negotiating table.
</P>
<P>
The latest Norwegian visit came amid an escalation of fighting
in the island's embattled northern Jaffna peninsula.
</P>
<P>
The LTTE rebels on Monday ended a three-week lull in fighting
in Jaffna by attacking and badly damaging a merchant ship off the
northern waters.
</P>
<P>
Government officials said the 2,850-ton ship was carrying food,
cement and other supplies from Colombo, for the 40,000 troops
stationed on Jaffna. Some of the food was also meant for 500,000
civilians trapped in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
The rebels in a statement issued Monday night by their London
office said they killed 10 naval personnel but lost six of their
elite suicide cadres during the attack. It said the ship was
transporting arms and ammunition, a charge flatly denied by the
government.

million dollars for the Bangladesh Integrated Nutrition Project
under an agreement signed last month.

dollars and 12.5 million dollars respectively to the project,

There is no cause for alarm; we are quite right on track; we are
on the right path."

<HEADLINE> Lithuania Asks Compensation for Austrian Nazi Occupation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Lithuania has officially requested
Austria to compensate Lithuanian victims of Austria's Nazi
occupation during World War II, the Interfax news agency reported
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The payment of compensations to Lithuania's residents who were
forcibly brought to what is now Austria to do slave labor during
World War II remains a problem which has not been resolved in a
way acceptable to the two countries," Lithuanian Prime Minister
Andrius Kubilius wrote in a letter to Austrian Chancellor Wolfgang
Schuessel.
</P>
<P>
Having the compensations paid through third countries would be
politically unacceptable, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
A Lithuanian cabinet press service official quoted Kubilius as
saying on Monday that a fund set up in the Genocide and Resistance
Research Center of Lithuania or Austrian institutions could be
used to channel the compensations.
</P>
<P>
Two weeks ago, Kubilius wrote to German Chancellor Gerhard
Schroeder that Lithuanian citizens must receive the compensations,
which they are entitled to get, directly through Lithuanian
institutions or non-government organizations rather than through
those of third countries.

<HEADLINE> Symposium on Promoting Ethnic Minority Officials Ends in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A two-day workshop on promoting
ethnic minority officials concluded here today with a call for
making greater efforts in fostering leaders among China's ethnic
minority people.
</P>
<P>
As China is a unified, multi-ethnic socialist country, to
nurture and select ethnic minority cadres has always been an
important component of the work on nurturing cadres of the
Communist Party of China (CPC), according to the symposium.
</P>
<P>
The participants agreed that doing so is vital to the strategy
of developing the vast, underdeveloped western part of the nation,
which is home to a large population of ethnic minority groups.
</P>
<P>
Party committees and governments at all levels are urged to put
the issue of fostering ethnic minority officials on their work
agenda and to find new ways for selecting and assigning these
people to official posts.
</P>
<P>
According to official figures, by the end of 1999, China had
more than 2.824 million ethnic minority officials, or 6.9 percent
of the national total, compared with 834,000 and 4.8 percent,
respectively, in 1978.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was sponsored by the Organization Department of
the CPC Central Committee, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission and
the United Front Work Department of the CPC Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Attending the meeting were Zeng Qinghong, an alternate member
of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and head of
the Organization Department of the CPC Central Committee, and Wang
Zhaoguo, vice-chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference and head of the United
Front Work Department of CPC Central Committee.

<HEADLINE> Israel, Palestinians Kick off More Talks on Interim Issues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Israeli chief negotiator Oded
Eran and his Palestinian counterpart Saeb Erekat opened here
Tuesday afternoon another round of talks to discuss interim issues,
including Israel's further troop redeployment in the West Bank and
release of more Palestinian prisoners.
</P>
<P>
The two sides are trying to narrow the gaps on all interim
issues, but it is hard to say whether they can reach agreements at
this round of talks, a senior Israeli official said before the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
Israel was originally scheduled to conduct the third troop
redeployment in the West Bank last Friday. But the redeployment has
been postponed for two weeks as asked by Israel and the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Taking into consideration the internal political situation and
other factors, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak wanted to discuss
the redeployment issue during the Washington summit with
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, and asked Arafat to consider the
redeployment as part of an agreement that the two sides could
strike at the summit.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have held several rounds of talks to discuss the
above-mentioned issues, but no final agreements have been reached
so far.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo accords signed in 1993, Israel has to transfer
all the remaining West Bank territories, except some military zones
and Jewish settlements, to the Palestinians in the third
redeployment. Israel has so far handed over about 40 percent of the
West Bank to the Palestinians.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Syria Seeks Japanese Loan for Port Renovation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian Transportation Ministry
is making efforts to ensure a 100-million-U.S.-dollar loan from
Japan for renovating the operating ports and constructing two
others in the northern city of Tartous.
</P>
<P>
The local economic weekly Al-Baath Al-Iktisadi on Tuesday quoted
Minister of Transportation Makram Obeid as saying the Technical and
Scientific Corporation of Japan (JIKA) has worked out a project on
upgrading Syria's harbors in a bid to enhance their efficiency and
competitiveness to other ports on the Mediterranean.
</P>
<P>
Syrian ports are a key crossing gate to the Gulf and neighboring
Arab states. However, Tatrous and Latakia ports on the
Mediterranean are operating merely at 60 percent of their capacity
at present, he said.
</P>
<P>
Part of the Japanese loan will be used to upgrade Latakia and
Tartous ports by installing modern equipment and facilities to
boost their handling capacity, profitability and efficiency, the
minister pointed out.
</P>
<P>
The other part will be invested in the construction of two other
ports within a special free trade zone to be set up in southern
Tartous, he added.
</P>
<P>
Syria seeks to raise its shipping competitiveness level with
regard to quality and service through reviewing the port tariff
system and container dues, he stressed.
</P>
<P>
The Syrian harbors would be equipped with up-to-date
telecommunication technologies and pollution control facilities,
the minister expected.
</P>
<P>
Syrian fleet is too old and limited to meet the rising export
and import movements.
</P>
<P>
Obeid disclosed that the Islamic Development Fund has expressed
willingness to fund the purchase of new ships for the Syrian
commercial fleet.
</P>
<P>
He also said his country is buying two ships from China at 16
million dollars and two others from Germany at 89 million marks.
</P>
<P>
There is a plan to revise the tariff set by the Syrian Ship
Insurance Corporation to bring about competitive prices and cut
down the fairly high container dues, he added.

<HEADLINE> Ross Discusses Peace Process With Israeli Coalition Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. special Middle East peace
envoy Dennis Ross met here Tuesday with leaders of Prime Minister
Ehud Barak's coalition partners and discussed with them the issues
concerning the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Prime Minister's Office refused to disclose details about
the meeting, but said Ross was asked by Barak to hold such a
meeting with the coalition leaders.
</P>
<P>
Although no substantial progress was reported in the Israeli-
Palestinian final-status talks, the talks have entered a crucial
stage as the U.S. wants to organize another summit in the near
future in Washington between Barak, Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
Arafat is reluctant to go to Washington at the moment, saying
big gaps still remain between the two sides on all key issues in
the final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
But Barak wants to hold the Washington summit, saying it is time
for the leaders to make decisions on key issues in the talks. He
proposed the summit be started on July 5 in Washington.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to arrive in
Israel later Tuesday to prepare the grounds for the summit.
</P>
<P>
Within Barak's coalition, political parties such as Yisrael
Ba'aliya and National Religious Party (NRP) are also opposed to the
idea that Barak attends the Washington summit right now.
</P>
<P>
NRP said that if Barak transfers more territories to the
Palestinians, it will pull out from the coalition.
</P>
<P>
Natan Sharansky, leader of the Yisrael Ba'aliya and Interior
Minister, has said Barak should consult with all coalition partners
before going to Washington and his party will not support the
agreement he reaches alone with the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Another coalition partner Shas has expressed its support for
Barak's peace policy in general after forcing Meretz party to leave
the coalition last week. Shas said it will support Barak in
reaching peace agreements with the Palestinians only on the basis
of case-by-case.
</P>
<P>
Ross was apparently asked by Barak to tell the coalition leaders
the U.S. position toward the peace process and ask them to support
Barak's efforts to reach a framework agreement with the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Ross returned to the region last Thursday and shuttled between
Israel and the Palestinians to bridge the gaps on all key issues in
the final-status talks and prepare for the Washington summit ahead
of the arrival of Albright.

<HEADLINE> Angolan Rebels Get $4 Billion From Diamond Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Angolan rebels led by Jonas Savimbi
have earned some 4 billion U.S. dollars from illegal trade in
diamond since the civil war broke out soon after independence in
1975, according to a World Bank report.
</P>
<P>
The report, issued ahead of the world diamond conference
scheduled for early July in Antwerp, Belgium, analyses issues on
diamond and its illegal trading on the international market, the
Angolan official news agency Angop said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report named "natural riches that feed civil wars around
the world" said that the Angolan rebel National Union for the
Total Independence of Angola (UNITA) had the control over the
diamond-rich regions in the country, enabling them to fund the
25-year-old civil war.
</P>
<P>
After analysing 47 wars around the world since 1965, the World
Bank concluded that no armed movement can maintain a long war
without economic means, despite the hatred and the factor behind
its origin.

LAGOS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The much desired New York -- Lagos
airlink is expected to resume in mid-August, Nigeria's Transport
Minister Kema Chikwe said here on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Eight airlines around the world have indicated interest in
operating the route, Chikwe said.
</P>
<P>
To facilitate smooth restoration of the direct airlink, the
Federal Government Monday set up a 10-man special committee to

resumption of flight operations on the Lagos-New York route.
</P>
<P>
Inaugurating the panel Monday, Chikwe emphasized the critical
role of flight operations on the Lagos-New York route in
re-integrating Nigeria into the international aviation system.
</P>
<P>
The Nigeria-U.S. flight was frozen by the United States
government in 1995 to protest human rights violations by the late
Gen. Sani Abacha Administration. The embargo was officially lifted
last December, but real operation has not recommenced.

Shi Pingting, an expert of Dunhuang Studies, said that the
eight relics are of great value in studying conditions and custom,

Among the returned relics is a list of expenditures on
alcoholic drinks by feudal officials during the Song Dynasty (960-
1279).
</P>
<P>
The returned piece tallies with one document kept at the

<HEADLINE> HK Sees Marked Rise in External Trade in May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's total exports and
imports of goods further showed marked increases in May 2000,
according to external merchandise trade figures released Tuesday
by the Census and Statistics Department.
</P>
<P>
The value of total exports of goods, comprising re-exports and
domestic exports, increased notably by 22.3 percent over a year
earlier to 132.8 billion HK dollars (17 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Within this total, the value of re-exports rose by 23.7 percent
to 117.3 billion HK dollars (15 billion U.S.dollars), and that of
domestic exports by 12.8 percent to 15.6 billion HK dollars (2
billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Concurrently, the value of imports of goods increased strongly,
by 29.2 percent in May 2000 over a year earlier to 140.7 billion
HK dollars (18 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
A visible trade deficit of 7.9 billion HK dollars (1 billion U.
S. dollars), equivalent to 5.6 percent of the value of imports of
goods, was recorded in May 2000, larger than the deficit of 0.3
billion HK dollars recorded in May 1999.
</P>
<P>
For the first five months of 2000 as a whole, the value of
total exports of goods increased markedly by 19.5 percent over a
year earlier, and that of goods imported rose by 23.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
A Government Secretariat spokesman noted that export
performance remained highly robust in May 2000, with the value of
total exports of goods recording double-digit growth for seven
consecutive months.
</P>
<P>
While imports in the major markets remained strong thereby

<HEADLINE> Iraq Protests to U.N. over U.S., British Attacks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 27 (Xinhua) -- In two separate letters to U.N.
Secretary-General Kofi Annan and president of the U.N. Security
Council, Iraqi Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz protested over the
continued U.S. and British air raids against Iraq from June 17-23.
</P>
<P>
Aziz said that during the period, the U.S. and British warplanes
made a total of 178 armed sorties, among them 74 from Turkey and
104 from Saudi Arabia and Kuwait, over the two so-called no-fly
zones in southern and northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
The enemy planes bombed targets inside the no-fly zones,
injuring three innocent people, Aziz said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Aziz pointed out that during the period, U.S. and
British planes dropped seven incendiary bombs in southern and
northern Iraq, aiming to cause more property damages to Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has claimed that nearly 300 people have been killed, nearly
1,000 others injured in U.S. and British air attacks since December
1998, plus heavy property losses.
</P>
<P>
Aziz stressed that it has become "a fixed policy" for the U.S.
and Britain to continue their "aggressions aimed at infringing on
Iraq's sovereignty, independence and territorial integrity."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated Iraq's "absolute rejection" of the no-fly zones,
unilaterally imposed by the U.S.-led Western allies in the wake of
the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
He called on Annan and president of the U.N. Security Council to
intervene and stop the U.S. and Britain from conducting further
aggressions.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has repeatedly sent letters to Annan and the U.N. Security
Council, demanding them to pressure the U.S. and Britain to halt
aggressions on Iraq, but it so far has received little response.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain have been enforcing the two air exclusion
zones in Iraq to prevent what they called Baghdad persecution of
the Kurds in the north and Shiite Muslims in the south.
</P>
<P>
Baghdad has never recognized the no-fly zones for their lack of
U.N. authorization.

<HEADLINE> Cooperatives Must Make Adaptations vis-a-vis Changes: Indonesian Vice-President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Cooperatives must make
adaptations to respond the challenges brought about by
globalization and uphold its character and identity to reflect a
genuine democracy and cooperative spirit, Indonesian Vice-
President Megawati Soekarnoputri said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"In line with the increasingly more open and more globalized
economic life, there arises a demand that cooperatives be able to
respond to the increasingly more sophisticated and more complex
market challenges," Megawati said while delivering a key-note
speech at the first Asia-Pacific Cooperative Forum participated
by some 500 top cooperative leaders and government officials from
the Asia Pacific region.
</P>
<P>
"Whether one likes it or not, cooperatives must make
adaptations in consonance with such new developments," she
stressed, highlighting compliance with economic rules, competition
in complex market, utilization of information technology,
restructuring of their organization as well as management and
function of countervailing for the interests for less-strong
market players.
</P>
<P>
She said that up to now cooperatives have had a tradition of
uniting their capabilities jointly in accordance with one of its
principles and proved their ability to make adaptations vis-a-vis
changes in the situation without losing their identity as they did
in the past.
</P>
<P>
Cooperatives will have a chance of success only if
cooperatives remain faithful to their identity and their origin as
organizations rooted in the society, she underlined.
</P>
<P>
In definition, she said a cooperative is a member-based
business enterprise with democratic character and cooperative
spirit and is significantly different from a corporation which is
a capital-based association orientated solely to economic profit
in nature.
</P>
<P>
She said a cooperative which has succeeded as a business
enterprise can play an important role in sustaining its members'
endeavors towards creating job opportunities for themselves in
cooperative sector and horizontal and vertical integration among
cooperatives have created values added which in turn will promote
cooperative assets, enlarge market segments, elevate
competitiveness and contribute significantly to the economic
development.
</P>
<P>
Singapore Minister for Community Development and Sports
Abdullah Tarmugi also delivered a key-note address to the forum
which is preceded by the 2nd International Cooperatives Alliance (
ICA) Regional Women's Forum on June 26 and will be followed by the
4th Meeting of ICA Regional Assembly for Asia and Pacific on June
29 and 30.
</P>
<P>
The minister said that cooperatives, like any other entity or
sector will face new challenges in the knowledge economy and the
values, principles and reasons for the setting up of cooperatives
remain important.
</P>
<P>
"But even as we uphold and preserve them as hallowed
cornerstones of these entities, cooperative need also to take into
account the economic and social realities in which they will have
to exist," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Cooperatives will have to be as cost-effective, competitive
and efficient to succeed and grow," he concluded.
</P>
<P>
ICA Vice President Mu Li, who is concurrently vice president
of All China Federation of Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, also
made a speech at the forum, urging cooperatives to restructure,
reform and face up to challenges in a rapidly changing environment.

and most of the citizens in the urban areas, became the largest
opposition in the new parliament.

<HEADLINE> HK Presents Q Decals As Guide for Good Service </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Quality Tourism Services (
QTS) Scheme Council of Hong Kong began to present decals marking
quality tourism services to the qualified businesses Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The decals, in the shape of a block English letter Q, with a
Chinese character meaning good in it, were stuck on the doors or
windows of those qualified retail outlets and restaurants to give
customers a clear indication of the service quality.
</P>
<P>
The QTS Scheme Council, composed of government officials and
other prominent figures from tourism-related sectors, began
receiving applications from retailers and restaurants for the
decals in January this year.
</P>
<P>
To date, more than 200 retail shops and restaurants,
representing some 1,000 outlets, have been qualified and been
awarded the QTS decals.
</P>
<P>
Organizations applying to join the scheme must first undertake
a self-assessment of their existing service standards against the
prescribed criteria. This is followed by a professional assessment
by technical consultants from the Hong Kong Productivity Council.
Only those organizations that meet all relevant requirements are
awarded the QTS decals.
</P>
<P>
Frank Lee, chairman of the Association of Better Business &AMP;
Tourism Services that has been appointed to administer the scheme,
said the association will send mysterious shoppers to and conduct
annual review on the businesses granted the decals so that their
service quality will stay good.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from reinforcing consumer confidence, the QTS scheme
encourages local retailers and restaurateurs to actively improve
their services, which is conducive to the image of our service
sector and the competitiveness of the tourism industry," said
Henry Tang, the QTS Council chairman.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: HKEx Debuts on Local Stock Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Hong Kong Exchanges and
Clearing Limited (HKEx), the merged entity of the local stock
exchange, futures exchange and three clearing houses, became the
world's second bourse to go public Tuesday as its shares made a
strong debut on the main board.
</P>
<P>
The stock soared 137 percent to 9.20 Hong Kong dollars (1.17 U.
S. dollars) at the opening bell from 3.88 Hong Kong dollars (50
cents), the level it was valued when the company was formed this
year through the merger of the stock and futures exchanges.
</P>
<P>
It was traded as high as 8.55 Hong Kong dollars before the
morning session ended as 316 million Hong Kong dollars worth of
shares changed hands, making it the second most actively traded
issue by value on the market. It had an intraday low of 7 Hong
Kong dollars.
</P>
<P>
HKEx was listed on the local exchanges by way of introduction
so it did not have an initial share price. The demand for the
stock was high on turnover 439 million Hong Kong dollars, more
than a fifth of the market total.
</P>
<P>
"The company's listing marks the completion of a series of
reforms in the securities and futures industry in Hong Kong," said
Charles Lee, chairman of the company, at its listing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
"It also opens up challenges and opportunities for the
unification of global exchanges," Lee said. It is also considering
a proposal to list its shares on the New York Stock Exchange, the
chairman said.
</P>
<P>
The exchange-based securities and futures markets in Hong Kong
have both seen substantial growth over the last decade. The size
of the Stock Exchange in terms of the number of companies having
shares listed on it more than doubled while its total market
capitalization has increased by more than six times to
approximately 4,728 billion Hong Kong dollars (606 billion U.S.
dollars) at the end of 1999, more than three times the size of
Hong Kong's 1999 GDP.
</P>
<P>
In March 1999, a comprehensive reform of the securities and
futures markets in Hong Kong, including fundamental changes in the
market structure to be achieved through the merger of five
recognized and approved market operators in Hong Kong, was
announced to enhance Hong Kong's competitiveness in an
increasingly globalized financial marketplace.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the HKEx's strategy and vision in the coming
years, Lee said the company would focus on seeking opportunities
for alliances with other major international exchanges and
continuing to serve as China's mainland primary venue for capital
raising.
</P>
<P>
It would continue to pursue business growth opportunities
offered by Hong Kong's domestic capital requirements and to invest
in technology to increase the speed and efficiency of transactions,
Lee said.

<HEADLINE> Interview: HK Remains Ideal Place for Business </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, June 27 (Xinhua) -- "On a scale of 10, I will give
Hong Kong 9.5," said President of the American Chamber of Commerce
in Hong Kong (AmCham) Frank Martin in reference to the region's
current business and investment environment.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong remains an ideal international trade and financial
center despite the undesirable air quality," Martin told Xinhua on
the eve of the third anniversary of Hong Kong's return to the
motherland on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
AmCham members are fully confident in Hong Kong's business
environment since the integrity of legal system and free flow of
information are two major pillars behind the confidence, said the
president.
</P>
<P>
"The judicial system of Hong Kong is working today as well as
it was prior to Hong Kong's return to China on July 1, 1997. It is
still a legal system based on the British common law, which is
what makes the 'one country, two systems' principle very unique,"
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
"Freedom of press, basically an asset of Hong Kong, is
guaranteed under the Basic Law," he added.
</P>
<P>
The 1999 business outlook survey by AmCham indicated that 84
percent of the more than 1,000 AmCham member companies responding
to the survey foresee a good and satisfactory outlook of Hong Kong
's business environment for the year 2000. Of the 75 percent of
respondents that have regional headquarters in Hong Kong, 81
percent said they would retain their regional base here.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the survey results suggest Hong Kong's investment
environment will improve sharply in 2001, with respondents
expecting this positive outlook to be sustained through 2004.
</P>
<P>
Mentioning the economic downturn in Hong Kong over the past
years, he pointed out that it is a result of the regional
financial crisis. "It has nothing to do with China's resumption of
the exercise of sovereignty over Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
Speaking on the impact of the impending China's entry into the
World Trade Organization (WTO) on Hong Kong, he held that China's
accession to the world trade body is good for the global economy
and will produce a positive impact on Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that Hong Kong will perhaps have to accept a
smaller piece of a big pie, but it will eventually be a larger one.
</P>
<P>
AmCham has lent firm support to China's WTO membership and the
grant of permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status to China.
</P>
<P>
Last month, Martin led a senior delegation to Washington D.C.
to voice the unequivocal support of the American business
community in Hong Kong and Shanghai for unconditional PNTR status
for China. He was among the lobbyists from Asia Pacific region who
had to walk along many Congressional corridors on Capital Hill
during the week-long AmCham Washington doorknock.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives adopted a bill on PNTR with
China on May 24 and the Senate is expected to vote on the bill in
July.
</P>
<P>
Martin, 59, who was born in Pennsylvania, has settled in Hong
Kong with his family since 1976 and is a permanent resident of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region. He is very proud of his
two children who received 13 years' education in Hong Kong, from
kindergarten to high school.
</P>
<P>
He had been president and chief executive officer of the Bank
of Canton for 14 years. Having been on his current post for nearly
a decade, the longest term in the history of the 1969-founded
AmCham, he was proud of having participated in Hong Kong's
celebration for the handover in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"It is the most exciting point in my term. To be part of that
is very significant. We had a huge black-tie dinner at the Hong
Kong Exhibition and Convention Center, with all the international
chambers present. Hong Kong Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa also
joined us," he recalled.
</P>
<P>
Martin remembered that, prior to Hong Kong's handover on June
30, 1997, some of the western media were very skeptical about Hong
Kong's future and wrote many negative reports, some of which were
entitled with things like "the death of Hong Kong" or "the
betrayal of Hong Kong."
</P>
<P>
However, "I am happy to say that not a single one of these
predictions has come true."

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Central Government Cautions Local Authorities Against Possible Human Rights Abuse </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The central government of
Indonesia cautioned here Tuesday local authorities in the country'
s Maluku and North Maluku provinces against possible human rights
abuse there, following the imposition of civilian emergency and
curfew.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, State Minister for Human Rights Affairs
Hasballah M. Saad said that " every body, as well as the
government have to do something to stop violent action and
communal bloodshed in North Maluku and Maluku provinces. But we
cautioned the local authorities in the provinces not to legitimate
any human rights abuse despite the imposition of state of civil
emergency there."
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid announced on Monday night a state
of civil emergency in North Maluku and Maluku provinces in a bid
to overcome communal bloodshed involving Moslems and Christians
there which has killed more than two thousands people.
</P>
<P>
A curfew also have been imposed in the two provinces in line
with the new status which empowering the security authorities to
take any necessary measures such as conducting raids and checks as
well as censorship.
</P>
<P>
But Hasballah admitted that situation in the provinces has been
complicated.
</P>
<P>
"And we can not give any guarantees that there will not be any
human rights violations," he added.
</P>
<P>
"So, I think there must be a routine evaluation on the
application of the civilian emergency there, to avoid possible
human right abuse which is possibly legitimated by civilian
emergency status," he said.

<HEADLINE> Zanzibar Shows Big Increase in Export </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Zanzibar has registered a
satisfactory performance in its export during the 1999/2000
financial year ending in June.
</P>
<P>
Tanzanian official Daily News Tuesday quoted the Zanzibar
Minister for Trade, Industries and Marketing Khamis Ahmada Mussa
as saying that its export income increased by 16 percent compared
with the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Tabling his ministry's budget estimates for the 2000/2001
financial year in the House of Representatives, the minister said
Zanzibar exported commodities worth 36 billion Tanzanian shillings
(about 45 million U.S. dollars), up from 31 billion shillings
(about 38.8 million U.S. dollars) in the previous year.
</P>
<P>
He attributed the increase in exports to bumper clove crop in
the last season, higher output of seaweed, other spices and marine
products.
</P>
<P>
Prices of clove, the top foreign exchange earner of the Isles,
has risen in the world market to 3,000 U.S. dollars per ton
against 1,000 U.S. dollars in the previous year, a major factor
in the record performance, explained the minister.
</P>
<P>
Though it united with the mainland Tanganyika to form the
nation of Tanzania in 1964, Zanzibar is a semi-autonomous state
with its own government and parliament.

<P>
PARIS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Tuesday expressed his support for the idea of drafting a "European
Constitution" as the next step in the process of European
integration.
</P>
<P>
In a speech addressed to the German parliament (Bundstag) at
the Reichstag in Berlin, Chirac said that "after a period of time
the (European) governments and people would be called on to give
their points of view" on a European Constitution, according to
local media reports.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the declaration four days ahead of France's
assumption of the six-month European Union (EU) rotating
presidency.
</P>
<P>
He also supported the idea of building a "pioneer group" of
European countries which want to go further and faster in their
political and economic integration.
</P>
<P>
This is the first time for the French president to formally
support a German proposal on drafting a European Constitution.
</P>
<P>
German Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer said on May 12 that
Europe must have a constitution, a directly elected executive and

integration process.

<HEADLINE> Russia Says It Seizes Lithuanian Spy Working for U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Russian Federal Security
Service (FSB) said Tuesday it has seized an espionage working for
the United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) and the
Lithuanian secret service DGB.
</P>
<P>
The spy, a Lithuanian national, has given detailed testimony
about this, the FSB public relations center told the press here.
</P>
<P>
The Lithuanian reportedly admitted having been a salaried agent
of the Lithuanian secret service and involved in a CIA operation
in early 1999 to collect information about the activities,
personnel and abilities of the FSB computer and information
security units against Western secret services, said the center.
</P>
<P>
The breach of information systems of the Russian Federal
Security Service was an important element of the conspiracy for
Americans, according to the center.
</P>
<P>
"The agent said that he was assigned to bring an FSB
representative to Poland and to give him materials prepared by the
CIA in order to catch the man red-handed and recruit him. The
assignment was given in April or May of 2000, before U.S.
President Bill Clinton's visit to Russia. It was planned to
compromise the 'subversive activity' of the Russian secret
services in the eyes of the international public in case the plot
failed. The plan was thwarted by the FSB counterintelligence," the
FSB center told Xinhua by phone.
</P>
<P>
"The CIA plan for political provocation against Russia,
recruitment of a staff member of the Federal Security Service and
hacking into the computer system of the Russian FSB was prevented,
and the agent of the U.S. CIA and the Lithuanian DGB was exposed,
"the FSB said.

<HEADLINE> Taiwan Issue Can Be Solved Only Within One-China Frame: FM Spokesman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesman
Zhu Bangzao said here today that the Taiwan issue and the Korean
issue are entirely different in nature and in the cause of
emergence, the Taiwan issue is an issue left over from China's
civil war, and is a purely internal matter, and can only be solved
within the one-China frame.
</P>
<P>
Zhu made the remark while responding to a reporter's question
at a regular press conference here this afternoon. The reporter
asked for comment on Taiwan's Chen Shui-bian's earlier remark that
the two sides of the Taiwan Straits should follow the mode of the
inter-Korea summit to realize cross-straits reconciliation.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that if the Taiwan authorities are really
sincere to follow the mode of the summit between the Democratic
People's Republic of Korea and the Republic of Korea, they should
clearly accept the one-China principle as soon as possible and
clearly admit that they themselves are Chinese and clearly commit
themselves to pursuing the objective of reunification and really
putting it into practical action.
</P>
<P>
Zhu said that the first ever summit between DPRK and ROK is of
great significance to enhancing mutual understanding, developing
inter-Korean relations and realizing national independence and
peaceful reunification.
</P>
<P>
A declaration was signed following the summit which discussed
the national reconciliation and unity, exchanges and cooperation,
peace and reunification, he added.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of both sides of the Korean peninsula said that the
north and south are of one nationality and one community, and
should join hands and advance, Zhu said, adding that both sides
will follow the principle and work hard to explore the road to
living in harmony and solve all the existing problems one by one
and finally achieve the independence, peace and reunification.
</P>
<P>
This reflected the determination and aspiration of the people
and leaders of the north and south of the peninsula to pursue the
independent solution of peaceful reunification of their fatherland
according to the principle of the Korean nationality being the
master in solving the issue of the state reunification, the
Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman stressed.

<HEADLINE> Lahoud-Nasrallah Meeting Serves Lebanese Interests </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Monday's first-ever meeting
between Lebanese President Emile Lahoud and Hezbollah leader Sheikh
Hassan Nasrallah will serve Beirut's present and future interests,
a United Arab Emirates' leading newspaper said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came at a time when the U.S. and Israel are stepping
up their pressure to disarm the Hezbollah as a main condition for
Lebanon to receive U.S. financial assistance after Israel had
withdrew from south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
The Sharjah-based "Al Khaleej" commented that despite the
relatively good ties between Hezbollah and the former government of
President Elias Al Hrawi, the current relations between the
government of Lahoud and the Hezbollah have reached the level of a
strong alliance.
</P>
<P>
"This is also the case in the relationship between the Hezbollah
and the Lebanese army. After years of tense relationship, the two
parties are looking now from one perspective as two close allies,"
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
"They exchange information, location and mutual support, visits
and congratulations. The relationship between the army and the
resistance movement is ushering into a new and promising era," the
paper noted.
</P>
<P>
After his meeting with Lahoud, Nasrallah said the group, which
led the fight to drive Israel from the south, will strengthen its
role in the domestic politics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the guerrillas leader also accused Israel of
violating a line drawn by the United Nations to confirm Israeli
troops have left the former occupation zone but he promised the
resistance movement will give diplomacy time to end the Israeli
violations.

<HEADLINE> Manila Hopes for Release of Remaining Hostages: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The release of a Malaysian hostage
last week has buoyed up the Philippine government's hopes for the
safe release of the 20 remaining captives held by the extremist
Abu Sayyaf in Sulu, a senior official said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio interview
Tuesday after receiving a briefing on the matter from chief
government negotiator Robert Aventajado
</P>
<P>
But Zamora did not elaborate on the details of the briefing
from Aventajado, who also heads the presidential flagships
projects committee.
</P>
<P>
"That is what we are hoping for now," Zamora said after being
asked whether the government is still optimistic on the release of
the remaining hostages.
</P>
<P>
The government confirmed last Saturday that the Abu Sayyaf
released one of nine Malaysian hostages. Manila also maintained no
ransom was paid for the release.
</P>
<P>
The 21 foreign hostages were abducted by the Abu Sayyaf from
Malaysia on April 23 and then brought to the southern Philippine
island province of Sulu.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a separate report quoted National Security Adviser
Alexander Aguirre as saying that the Malaysian government has
reaffirmed its support for the Philippine government's efforts to
secure the release of the remaining 20 hostages.
</P>
<P>
Aguirre, who is in Kuala Lumpur as the Philippine government's
chief representative to the meeting of the Organization of Islamic
Countries (OIC) being held there, said he met with Malaysian
Foreign Minister Syed Albar, whom, he noted, was "very supportive"
towards Manila's efforts.
</P>
<P>
"They are happy over the release of the hostage. They share our
hope for the release of the others," he said.

<HEADLINE> Major News Items in Leading Israeli Newspapers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading Israeli newspapers on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The Jerusalem Post:
</P>
<P>
-- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is to arrive in
Israel Tuesday evening for less than 36 hours of intensive
consultations that the U.S. hopes will help produce enough progress
to enable a three-way summit.
</P>
<P>
Some senior U.S. officials, fearing the sides are too far apart
to produce a framework agreement, are said to be wary of holding
such a summit. They say a failed summit could be more damaging for
U.S. President Bill Clinton than no summit at all.
</P>
<P>
But sources close to Clinton say he, like Israeli Prime Minister
Ehud Barak, is eager to convene the summit in the U.S. as quickly
as possible.
</P>
<P>
Ha'aretz:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is willing to authorize the
transfer of the three Arab villages outside Jerusalem of Abu Dis,
Azariya and Suwahara to the Palestinian National Authority (PNA) as
a goodwill gesture prior to the tripartite summit in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Sources in Jerusalem said Monday Barak will consider the
transfer of the three villages on the outskirts of Jerusalem, but
refuses to comply with other demands posed by Arafat in return for
his participation in a summit in the United States.
</P>
<P>
Arafat reportedly set as conditions for participating in such a
meeting the completion of the third withdrawal from the
territories, the release of Palestinians held in Israeli prisons,
and American guarantees to support the PNA on vital issues of the
final status agreement, such as borders, Jerusalem and refugees.
</P>
<P>
Ma'ariv
</P>
<P>
-- The Torah scroll was stolen from the synagogue of the
Messianic Jews in Jerusalem on Sunday night. Ten bottles filled
with gasoline were also found in the synagogue, leading police to
conjecture that the vandals intended to torch the building but were
frightened away when the alarm went off.
</P>
<P>
This was the second synagogue in three days to be vandalized in
Jerusalem, following an arson attack on a Conservative synagogue on
Saturday. The Jerusalem District Police have set up a special team
to investigate both incidents.
</P>
<P>
Yediot Aharonot:
</P>
<P>
-- Government-controlled Syrian media sources have in recent
days renewed their call on Israel to resume negotiations with
Syria, calling peace with Israel the "strategic decision."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, however, Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak told
Israeli Justice Minister Yossi Beilin Sunday he believes the new
Syrian leadership will need time before making advancements in the
peace talks with Israel.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak told Beilin in Cairo Bashar al-Assad is still dependent
on the senior advisors he inherited from his father's rule, and
despite the appearance of greater flexibility than his father, he
is not yet completely free to act.

<P>
TEHRAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Some 5,200 kilograms of various
narcotics were seized in Iran's central province of Yazd during the

</P>
<P>
He said Yazd sits on a major route for transit of drugs, and a
total of 16.5 tons of drugs were seized in the province last
Iranian calendar year (ended March 19).
</P>
<P>
As part of the preventive measures, a security belt has been
created between Yazd and its neighbors, Fars, Isfahan and Kerman,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Drug hauls have become very common in Iran as it sits on a major
route for smuggling narcotics from the eastern neighbors of
Afghanistan and Pakistan to the lucrative markets in the Persian
Gulf, Europe and Central Asia.
</P>
<P>
Iran on Sunday set ablaze some 23 tons of various drugs seized
from drug traffickers to mark the International Anti-Drug Day.

<HEADLINE> Manila Yet to Decide on Extension of Talks With MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The government said Tuesday that it
will decide by Wednesday whether to accommodate the request of the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) to extend the peace process
by four weeks.
</P>
<P>
Executive Secretary Ronaldo Zamora said in a radio speech that
the government will wait for the outcome of the meeting of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) kicked off Tuesday in
Kuala Lumpur.
</P>
<P>
According to Zamora, representatives from the Philippine
government, the Moro National Liberation Front and the MILF are
expected to present in Kuala Lumpur their respective sides on
issues concerning Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
Zamora said the Philippine delegation is now in Kuala Lumpur to
attend the OIC meeting and present the Philippine side on issues
concerning peace and development in Mindanao.
</P>
<P>
He said the government was informed by the MILF that its major
leaders are also in Kuala Lumpur, for the OIC meeting, and thus
can not attend a schedule meeting set for June 28 between the
government and MILF peace panels.
</P>
<P>
The MILF has asked for an extension of the deadline set by
President Joseph Estrada for the government and MILF peace panels
to conclude a peace agreement by June 30.
</P>
<P>
"We'll wait for a day. The Kuala Lumpur meeting, which starts
Today (Tuesday), ends tomorrow," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
He said the government is interested in how the MILF would
present its side during the OIC meeting, as he noted that
sincerity in the peace process is a key factor for the success of
the negotiations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
"We want to see what happens in Kuala Lumpur before responding
to the MILF's request for an extension," Zamora said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, President Estrada said he would only be open to an
extension of the peace talks if the MILF shows its sincerity by
dropping its demand for an independent Islamic state and ceasing
its terrorist activities.

<HEADLINE> Mongolia to Implement New Poverty Alleviation Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ULAN BATOR, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A new poverty alleviation
program will be carried out jointly by the Mongolian Health and
Social Welfare Ministry and the United Nations Development
Programme (UNDP), the newspaper UB Post reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the new program, seeking to change the people's
mentality of relying on outside aid, aims to improve the living
skills of lower income households, provide them with permanent
jobs, encourage a reliable source of income, and prevent middle
income families from falling into poverty.
</P>
<P>
The former poverty alleviation program was launched by the
government and international organizations in 1994. Under the
program, 12.2 million U.S. dollars were spent on 6,217 projects in
public work, basic education, support of disabled people, as well
as women's development. Some 27,000 job opportunities were created
and 77,778 people benefited from that program.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released by the ministry, the life
of up to 60 percent of the Mongolians are registered as low living
standard. The poverty caused by low income has a negative
influence on the nation's health and education.

<HEADLINE> Malaysian Delegation in Iraq to Explore Business Opportunities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A 16-member Malaysian business
delegation has arrived here for a visit aimed at gaining a share of
Iraq's lucrative market.
</P>
<P>
Mohammad Izzat Ameer, head of the delegation and also chairman
of the Malaysian Businessmen Society, said Malaysia pays "special
attention" to the Iraqi market, which needs around 200 billion U.S.
dollars in reconstruction.
</P>
<P>
Iraq's economy has become dilapidated due to its eight-year
bloody war with Iran that ended in 1988 and the decade-old
crippling United Nations sanctions imposed on the country after its
1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
Ameer denounced the U.N. sanctions which hit the Iraqi people
most severely, and expressed keenness to develop trade ties with
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Malaysia have been intensifying efforts to improve
relations. Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar visited
Baghdad early this month in a bid to strengthen bilateral ties.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, the Malaysian foreign minister held talks with
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, Deputy Prime Minister Tareq Aziz
and other senior Iraqi officials.
</P>
<P>
Malaysia, a non-permanent member of the U.N. Security Council,
has called for lifting the sanctions on Iraq and expressed hope to
expand bilateral cooperation with the country.
</P>
<P>
Aziz visited Kuala Lumpur, capital of Malaysia, in January at
the invitation of his Malaysian counterpart Abdullah Ahmad Badawi,
and Aziz was assured that Malaysia, which holds a rotating seat on
the U.N. Security Council, will "do its best" to convince the U.N.
to end the sanctions.

advise the government to lift Emergency Rule in the southeastern
city of Van, but to extend it by four months in four other cities

<HEADLINE> Defense Debate Launched in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- A discussion paper on a defense
orientation, called as Green Paper, released Tuesday in Australia.
</P>
<P>
According to the Australian Associated Press, the discussion is
aimed to produce a Defense White Paper at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
The core of the debate is whether the defense spending should
be increased from the present level of 13 billion Australian
dollars (790 million U.S. dollars), and strategic options on
organizing for defeating attacks on Australia, defending regional
interests and military operations other than combat, such as
peacekeeping.
</P>
<P>
There is advocacy in the country insisting that the Australian
Defense Forces should be able to be deployed out of the country's
territory to defend the Western interests as a whole, including
the values.
</P>
<P>
A defense spokesman was quoted as saying that the paper was not
a statement of government policy but an attempt to get on the
table the key decisions the government will need to make about
defense.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard said when launched the discussion
Tuesday that "I do seek to make the point that in terms of
national priorities, I believe that in the years in front of us,
defense will need to bulk larger than it has over the past few
years."
</P>
<P>
"The end of the Cold War has tended to bring more rather than
less uncertainty in our region," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said events in Fiji and the Solomon Islands had increased
public interest in the debate about Australia's defense force.

<HEADLINE> Muslims Urged to Reaffirm Solidarity with Palestinians </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 27 (Xinhua) -- OIC Secretary-General
Azeddine Laraki Tuesday urged Islamic countries to reaffirm their
solidarity with the Palestinian people in their pursuit of an
independent homeland.
</P>
<P>
The world's Muslims must render whatever financial and economic
assistance to the Palestinians in their ongoing struggle against
Israel, he said at the 27th session of the Islamic Conference of
Foreign Ministers (ICFM) which opened here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"I avail myself of this opportunity to invite the member states
to reaffirm their solidarity with the people of Palestine in the
face of the hostile Israeli practices and to bolster the stand of
the Palestinian negotiators," he said.
</P>
<P>
Laraki said the Middle East peace process has entered a crucial
stage, hence, the international community must compel Israel to
put an immediate end to all new settlement works on Palestinian
and occupied Arab territories such as the West Bank and the city
of Al-Quds Al-Sharif and to resume negotiations with both Syria
and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
As the deadline to achieve a final solution to the Palestinian
issue is only weeks away, the core issues such as the Al-Quds, the
refugee problem, the settlements and water resources remain
unresolved, he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, addressing the same session, ICFM outgoing chairman
Youssouf Ouedraogo of Burkina Faso appealed to all OIC-member
states to help accelerate the liberation of the occupied
territories.
</P>
<P>
He said the withdrawal of Israeli forces from southern Lebanon
has raised hopes that a lasting peace is achievable in the region.
</P>
<P>
The four-day OIC foreign ministers' conference themed "Islam
and Globalization" is being attended by 1,000 delegates from 56
OIC member states.

<HEADLINE> OIC Facing Financial Straits: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Secretary General of the
Organization of Islamic Conference (OIC) said Tuesday the OIC
secretariat and its subsidiary organs are experiencing liquidity
shortage.
</P>
<P>
"The collection of contributions remains a nightmare that
bedevils the OIC and its entity leading to intermittent financial
crisis," OIC Secretary General Azzeddine Laraki said when
addressing the 27th session of the Islamic Conference of Foreign
Ministers (ICFM) here.
</P>
<P>
He said that despite the 56-member OIC being one of the largest
organizations in the world representing more than a fifth of the
world's population, its budget for the secretariat is only 11
million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
"It receives less than half of this amount although the tasks
entrusted to it keep increasing due to the implementation of
resolutions adopted by the summit and foreign ministers'
conferences," he said.
</P>
<P>
However, he said despite the shortages, the OIC is able to
carry on with several programs such as setting up a computer and
an archives department.
</P>
<P>
The grouping is also planning to establish an advanced
electronic archives system for fast keeping and retrieval of
documents, he said, adding the secretariat would establish a data
base on the affairs of Muslim communities and minorities next year.
</P>
<P>
The OIC secretary-general reminded member states that if the
OIC is to assume an effective role in launching joint Islamic
projects, it must be provided with the necessary funds.
</P>
<P>
The four-day OIC foreign ministers' conference was officiated
by Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad and is being attended
by some 1,000 delegates from the 56 OIC member states.

TEHRAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Iranian President Mohammad Khatami
said on Monday night he sees a good prospect for Tehran-Beijing
cooperation in many fields, notably in economic, industrial and
technological domains.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to accompanying reporters on his way back to Tehran
from a five-day state visit to China, Khatami said relations
between Iran and China will expand in the future in line with their
common interests and mutual respect, the Islamic Republic News
Agency reported on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Expressing satisfaction with his first visit to China, Khatami
said he sees no impediment in the way of Tehran-Beijing cooperation
in various fields and both countries are complying by international
regulations.
</P>
<P>
During his visit, Khatami said, he and his Chinese counterpart
Jiang Zemin signed a political statement. And the two sides also
inked six cooperation documents in the fields of energy, mining,
and non-oil trade.
</P>
<P>
Khatami also cited China's agreement to allocate some 500
million U.S. dollars to construct the forth line of Tehran's metro
system as one of the achievements of his visit.
</P>
<P>
The visit has outlined bright prospects for future Tehran-
Beijing ties and set stage for essential bilateral, regional and
international cooperation between the two countries, he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the historical ties between the two ancient
civilizations of China and Iran, Khatami underlined the need to
conduct a special dialogue among Asian civilizations on Asian
cultural convergence when the subject of dialogue among
civilizations is prevalent worldwide.
</P>
<P>
The Iranian president said that in his talks with Chinese
officials, he also expressed Iran's discontent with any
monopolistic mentality in globalization policies. Such a mentality
is doomed to failure if judged from historical, philosophical and
social facts, he said.
</P>
<P>
He said he and Chinese leaders also share common views on the
issues of Afghanistan and Palestine, saying Iran and China are of
the opinion that the conflicting Afghan groups should reach a
peaceful solution so as to meet rights and interests of all the
people of Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Palestine, the two countries believe a durable
peace can not be maintained in the region unless the inalienable
rights of all Palestinians are restored, he added.

<P>
WELLINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The New Zealand High Court has
ruled the name of the U.S. billionaire businessman who admitted
importing drugs into New Zealand can be made public next week, the
Television NZ reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The man, who visited Auckland for the America's Cup regatta in
January, was caught for bringing with him 100 grams of cannabis
plant and resin into the country. Later he was discharged without
conviction after paying a donation to a local drug rehabilitation
center and had his name suppressed.
</P>
<P>
However Auckland-based New Zealand Herald, the biggest
newspaper in the country, has vigorously challenged the
suppression order.
</P>
<P>
In a ruling released Tuesday afternoon, the High Court quashed
the suppression order.
</P>
<P>
The ruling said the High Court judges have taken such issues as
freedom of expression into consideration in reaching the decision.
</P>
<P>
However the court has imposed a stay of five working days on
the release of the name for the billionaire's appeal.

<HEADLINE> Uganda Ready to Hold Referendum on Political System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
by Ding Qilin and Wang Shangzhi
</P>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Millions of Ugandans will go to
the 17,000 polling stations across the country on June 29 in the
national referendum to determine the political system of the east
African nation.
</P>
<P>
"There are two sections of forces in Uganda, one force wants
the system of the National Resistance Movement to be continued,
and another section of people thinks the multiparty system should
be followed," Aziz Kasujja, chairman of the Ugandan National
Electoral Commission, said in an interview with Xinhua at his
office.
</P>
<P>
When the Movement took power in 1986, it promised to enable the
people of Uganda to make a constitution. In 1988 the government
set up the Uganda constitutional commission comprising of 22
eminent people.
</P>
<P>
The commission collected people's views on the new constitution
which was passed in 1995. However, on the form of governance, a
majority of Ugandans preferred the Movement (or one party) system
to continue while some people wanted a multiparty system.
</P>
<P>
The idea of holding a referendum to decide future political
system is contained in the constitution which recognizes people's
sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
"The referendum on a political system is necessary, because the
 constitution provides for it on the basis that all power belongs
to the people," Kasujja said.
</P>
<P>
"People are given right to vote for or against either of the
systems, the Movement or the multiparty, but no one can be forced
to vote," Kasujja said.
</P>
<P>
Since the National Electoral Commission was established in
1996, it has done plenty of work to prepare for the referendum.
"Everything is ready at the final stage, and everything is going
smoothly despite of some difficulties," said the chairman.
</P>
<P>
"The major difficulty the commission has been facing is
inadequate resources," he said.
</P>
<P>
The referendum expenditure totals 22 billion Uganda shillings
(about 15 million U.S. dollars). But the commission has only
received around 13 billion shillings. Some money from donor
community has gone to the civic education in the country.
</P>
<P>
From January 17 to February, a total of 300 million shillings
was paid to the civic educators who were recruited for every
parish in the country during a civic education campaign initiated
by the Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
The education campaign countrywide has not been so successful
due to low voters' turnout, said Dick Kizito, public relations
officer of the Electoral Commission.
</P>
<P>
However, majority of Ugandans are expected to vote. "From scene
they demand voters' cards, we can see they are enthusiastic,"
Kasujja said.
</P>
<P>
According to a public opinion poll conducted by K2-Research
Ltd, an affiliate of K2-Consult of Denmark, 75.5 percent of the
respondents said they would vote while 23.2 percent said they
would not.
</P>
<P>
The referendum will be supervised by independent organizations.
"The commission has also invited some international observers to
supervise the exercise," said Kasujja.
</P>
<P>
"Anyhow, the referendum will be held, with security and order
being guaranteed by the government," he added.

<HEADLINE> Boeing Cuts 900 Jobs in California </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Boeing Co., the world's
largest aircraft maker, announced Monday that it would eliminate
up to 900 jobs from its Delta rocket and C-17 military transport
programs in Huntington Beach, California, and transfer the work to
plants in Colorado and Alabama.
</P>
<P>
The Seattle-based aerospace giant said the shift, part of a
larger consolidation plan first announced in March 1998, will
maximize the use of existing Delta facilities, which are currently
80 percent underutilized.
</P>
<P>
Boeing has already shed 49,000 jobs from its peak employment of
238,600 in 1998 and has said the payroll could shrink to 180,000
by the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
Boeing said, in the latest announcement, that about 600
production jobs will be eliminated, with about half coming from
Delta programs and half from C-17 operations. Up to 300 more
support jobs will be lost, the company said.
</P>
<P>
Boeing assembles the C-17 in Long Beach, California, but some
parts are manufactured in Huntington Beach. Both Long Beach and
Huntington Beach had been assembly plants owned by McDonnell
Douglas until 1997, when it was acquired by Boeing.
</P>
<P>
The transition will begin in the third quarter and is expected
to be complete by the second quarter of 2002, according to Boeing.
</P>
<P>
In trimming its Huntington Beach staff, Boeing cited a slump in
demand for satellite launches, which cut Delta production by 50
percent since January 1999, as well as the transfer of work on the
C-17 military airlift to other locations.
</P>
<P>
"In order to strategically realign our Delta production, we
needed to consolidate operations and reduce manufacturing
duplication," said Gale Schluter, general manager of Boeing
Expendable Launch Systems.
</P>
<P>
After the move, the California center's primary mission will be
engineering, research and management of rocket manufacturing
programs, said Boeing spokesman Walt Rice.

<HEADLINE> World's Smallest Fingerprint IC System Invented </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANGZHOU, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese and French scientists
have developed the world's smallest fingerprint identification
system.
</P>
<P>
The system, portable and reportedly highly accurate, is the
product of joint efforts of China's advanced fingerprint
identification technology and the IC system of the Bull
Information System Inc. of France.
</P>
<P>
Currently, most of the world's leading fingerprint
identification systems are used in the warning systems for large-
sized computers. They are not only large in size, but also
expensive.
</P>
<P>
The newly invented fingerprint identification technology
consumes less energy and costs less.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of the new system can do a lot to help
prevent illegal activities involving false identification cards
and bank accounts," said Qiu Baiyun, chief scientist at Hangzhou
Miaxia Technology Development Co., Ltd.
</P>
<P>
As a pioneer of E-commerce and one of the world's largest
suppliers of ATM, POS and IC cards, the Bull company has 1,200
patents in the IC field, and expects to earn 1.245 billion French
francs annually in added value for its fingerprint IC system.

<HEADLINE> Muslims Urged to Prepare for Dangers of Globalization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Malaysian Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad Tuesday asked Islamic countries to stop
squabbling among themselves and prepare for the challenges and
dangers of globalization.
</P>
<P>
They must focus their attention on the acquisition of knowledge
to combat the use of information technology to destroy the values,
faith and the remains of Islamic civilization, he said at the
opening of the 27th session of the Islamic Conference of Foreign
Ministers here.
</P>
<P>
He said that although it is too much to expect Muslims to unite
suddenly, "at least we can learn to understand and fear the grave
danger that we will face with a borderless world and reduce the
divisiveness between us, the divisiveness within and between our
countries."
</P>
<P>
Muslims could learn the new sciences and technologies because
Islam enjoins upon them to seek knowledge and prepare to defend
themselves, Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
"Enough of us must be assigned to the acquisition of the
knowledge and skills of the Information Age to enable us to catch
up with our detractors and enemies," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are at the beginning of the Information Age of
Globalization.We are not too far behind. We can if we want to
catch up now. If we wait they will be too far ahead and it will be
too late again," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said that at present Muslims are not prepared for the many
negative aspects that could come from globalization because they
are technologically backward and economically poor.
</P>
<P>
"By failing to develop the Muslim countries, by failing to
defend them and the Muslim people, we are committing even greater
sins which our personal devotion to the daily rituals of our faith
will not absolve us," Mahathir said.
</P>
<P>
Mahathir hoped this meeting of foreign ministers of the
Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC) countries will "
recognize the danger and challenges posed by globalization, and
recognizing them,take the first step toward reducing the divisions
between us."
</P>
<P>
The four-day OIC foreign ministers' conference with the theme
of "Islam and Globalization" is being attended by 1,000 delegates
from 56 OIC member states.

KATHMANDU, June 27 (Xinhua) -- An anti-drug procession was held
Monday in Tundikhel, about 10 kilometers south of here, to arouse
awareness among Nepalese people to guard against drug abuse and
trafficking, The Rising Nepal reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The procession was organized by the Home Ministry to mark the
International Year Against Drug Abuse and Trafficking-2000, the
English daily said.
</P>
<P>
Home Minister Govind Joshi said while inaugurating the
procession that trafficking and abuse of drugs are national crimes
and the government is committed to control them.
</P>
<P>
"As trafficking also encourages terrorist activities and cannot
be controlled by the law alone, what we have to do is to spread
awareness in society," Joshi said.
</P>
<P>
Joshi urged all the social organizations and conscious citizens
to be united and control drug trafficking and abuse.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of people participated in the procession, including
Joshi and other high-ranking officials, sportsmen, scouts,
students,teachers and a police band.
</P>
<P>
According to the Home Ministry data, Nepal had 30,000 drug
addicts in 1999 while unofficial estimates put the number at 50,
000 to 60,000. Most of the addicts were between 15 to 30 years old.
</P>
<P>
Production and trafficking of drugs are also serious in Nepal.
Studies showed that marijuana is produced in central and far-
western high hills and southern Terai plains. In 1999, police
confiscated 4,059 kilograms of marijuana, 1,316 kilograms of
hashish, 1.44 kilograms of opium and 1.15 kilograms of heroin.

<HEADLINE> Indonesian Military Sets Deadline for Maluku Rivals to Hand Over Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's new Pattimura military
commander overseeing Maluku, Col. I Made Yasa, Monday set a
deadline for the rivals in the restive provinces of Maluku and
North Maluku to hand over their weapons.
</P>
<P>
"I've set July 1 as the deadline for the two rivals to hand
over their weapons or else they will be forced to hand them in,"
Yasa was quoted by the Jakarta Post Tuesday as saying at a
ceremony held in Ambon, capital of Maluku, on Monday, for
transferring to him leadership of the Pattimura Military Command
from Brig. Gen. Max Tamaela.
</P>
<P>
"I will try my best to be neutral (in handling the riots) ... I
call on both warring parties to restrain themselves and stop the
fights," Yasa added.
</P>
<P>
Communal clashes between Muslims and Christians continued to
torment the riot-stricken Ambon, about 2,300 kilometers northeast
of Jakarta. It was reported that gunfire and explosions wrecked
parts of the city on Monday, paralyzing all activities there,
including schools, shops and banks.
</P>
<P>
The fresh clashes broke out in Tantui village, Ambon, on June
21 after two unidentified men attacked three people. The clashes
have spread to three other villages and the Antara News Agency
Tuesday reported that the death toll rose to 66.
</P>
<P>
The government has imposed a state of civil emergency in Maluku
and North Maluku to put an end to renewed communal clashes.
</P>
<P>
President Abdurrahman Wahid said the civil emergency status
would begin at midnight on Monday and remain in force until the
situation in the provinces returns to normal.
</P>
<P>
"This decision was taken after a number of ministers met with
leaders of the House of Representatives and concluded that a state
of civil emergency should immediately be imposed in Maluku and
North Maluku," the president said.
</P>
<P>
A civil emergency is one step away from a state of military
emergency. One notable difference is that in the latter, regional
emergency authority control would be in the hands of the military.
</P>
<P>
With Monday's declaration, the regional civil emergency
authority can ban public gatherings and impose a curfew on the
residents.
</P>
<P>
The renewed violence in Maluku and North Maluku is the
continuation of a strife that has troubled the two provinces for
one-and-a-half years. More than 3,000 people have died in the
strife.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Admits to Poppy Cultivation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has admitted that there is
illegal cultivation of poppy and production in the country but
said it is a livelihood on which its people inhabiting in the
border areas depend.
</P>
<P>
"We have never concealed or denied the fact that there is
illegal cultivation of poppy and production in our country,"
Myanmar Home Minister Colonel Tin Hlaing was quoted by Tuesday's
official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar as saying.
</P>
<P>
"These people have been growing poppy not to enrich themselves
nor as a lucrative business but for survival," said Tin Hlaing,
who is also chairman of the Myanmar Central Committee for Drugs
Abuse Control, at a ceremony here Monday marking the International
Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking.
</P>
<P>
However, he pointed out, those who have really become wealthy
are the transnational criminals who move in and out trafficking
drugs between Myanmar and its neighbors.
</P>
<P>
He said it is within the government's reach and is quite easy
to destroy all the poppy fields by the use of force. But he warned
that such action, if applied, could have adverse consequences for
the poppy growers who are liable to face starvation.
</P>
<P>
Hence, he added, an integrated approach is adopted to raise the
living standard of these poppy growers through sustainable income-
earning activities.
</P>
<P>
Opium poppy is cultivated in inaccessible and underdeveloped
regions in Myanmar.
</P>
<P>
Tin Hlaing disclosed that the government has since 1989
invested more than 18 billion kyats (56.25 million U.S. dollars)
for the development of border areas.
</P>
<P>
Income-generating programs have been formulated for the
cultivation of cash crops such as rice, pulse, maize, wheat,
fruits and perennial crops, he added.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar started in 1999 to implement a 15-year plan worth 255
million dollars, aimed at total elimination of drugs in 51
cultivating and producing townships.
</P>
<P>
In order to realize the aim as earlier as possible, Myanmar has
urged the international community to enhance cooperation and
extend aid.
</P>
<P>
So far, some foreign countries and organizations have provided
Myanmar with certain monetary assistance for the plan, the
minister said.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia to Build Navy Base in Papua Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Indonesian Navy will soon
build a naval base for 3,000 members of its marines in the
district of Sorong in Papua (Irian Jaya) Province.
</P>
<P>
A navy spokesman in Sorong, Lieutenant Muksin, said the
decision to build the naval base also shows that Sorong will be
the center to manage marine bases across the province of Papua.
</P>
<P>
All the 3,000 mariners will be deployed across Papua, but 800
of them will be stationed in Sorong, Muksin was quoted by the
Indonesian Observer Tuesday as saying.
</P>
<P>
Muksin said the naval base will consist of a combat marine
regiment including cavalry, artillery and the navy's special
troops.
</P>
<P>
He emphasized that the establishment of the naval base is for
security reasons and has nothing to do with political issues.
</P>
<P>
Sorong was chosen as a marine center because the district is
located in the western part of the province and close to the
restive provinces of Maluku and North Maluku, Muksin said, adding
that Sorong also has the infrastructure to support a naval base.
</P>
<P>
To realize the plan, he said, the navy will send a company of
marines from Surabaya in East Java Province to Sorong.

<HEADLINE> Chirac Outlines Vision for EU in Germany </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BERLIN, June 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
said on Monday that a European Union constitution in Europe "can
only be adopted if the French-German motor is running well."
</P>
<P>
At a question-answer session with students at Berlin's Humboldt
University, he said, "Our future has to be the union of our Europe
" and "that means having a constitution in some form -- it is
necessary and must be quickly established."
</P>
<P>
But he warned that creating such a constitution will not be
easy.  "I hope to create a United Europe of States rather than a
United States of Europe," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We will have to make decisions that could be a bit painful for
us all," he said. He praised a speech given last month by German
Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer at the same university that laid
out a "personal" vision of a federal Europe.
</P>
<P>
"I don't think a supranational European government ... is the
solution," he said. "I don't believe it would be accepted by the
individual countries."
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Chirac held talks with German President Johannes Rau.
At a banquet held at the Bellevue palace in honor of French
President Jacques Chirac, the German president said both Germany
and France should settle recent "misunderstandings" about European
integration. "We must agree upon which goals we want to pursue
with full force," he said.
</P>
<P>
French President Chirac arrived in Germany on Sunday for a
three-day state visit.

<HEADLINE> Dyer Injured in Nightclub Attack </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- England international Kieron Dyer
spent a night in hospital after an incident in an Ipswich
nightclub.
</P>
<P>
The former Ipswich Town player, who joined Newcastle United for
6 million pounds last year, is believed to have been glassed in
the face.
</P>
<P>
Police were not called to the incident but a spokeswoman for
Ipswich Hospital NHS Trust confirmed that the 21-year-old was
detained and treated for his injuries in the early hours of
Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The spokeswoman said: "He was admitted to the hospital at 2am
on Saturday morning, where he had spent the rest of the night and
most of the following day. He was allowed home about 7.30pm on
Saturday after being examined by a doctor."
</P>
<P>
The Newcastle star now faces a meeting with boss Bobby Robson
about his social life.
</P>
<P>
A Newcastle United spokesman said: "As far as the club is
concerned the manager will be having a word with Kieron Dyer but
it will be in private and when he returns for pre-season training
early next month."
</P>
<P>
Dyer has revealed he is to move out of his flat on Newcastle's
lively Quayside to somewhere quieter.
</P>
<P>
He told the Newcastle Journal: "I have had a chat with the club
and the manager and I've decided to move out of my flat. Being so
close to the Quayside, it is always lively and noisy at night and
I think it is better if I move to somewhere more quiet."
</P>
<P>
"I have to concentrate on my career at Newcastle United, and
being away from the city center will help me do that," he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Argentina's striker Daniel Cordone
will head for Newcastle United for a medical later this week after
agreeing a move to St James' Park.
</P>
<P>
Newcastle are understood to have signed the 26-year-old Racing
Club forward on a 12-month deal for around 500,000 pounds with the
option of a two-year extension if he proves himself in the

</P>
<P>
Cordone will become Newcastle's second Argentine signing this

Velez Sarsfield.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Newcastle confirmed: "The club and the player
have agreed terms and he is due to come to Newcastle this week for
a medical. Subject to the medical, we believe this should go

<HEADLINE> Matthaus Confirms Plot ahead of Euro 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Lothar Matthaus has confirmed that
several of his team-mates tried to install him as coach of the
German national team ahead of Euro 2000.
</P>
<P>
The ringleaders of the player power coup against manager Erich
Ribbeck were Dietmar Hamann, Jens Jeremies and Markus Babbel,
according to the veteran defender.
</P>
<P>
He said the plotting came to a head at a pre-Euro 2000 training
camp in Spain, BBC reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"Hamann, Jeremies, Babbel and several others came to see me
during the Majorca camp and said 'You should do it, you would do a
lot better'," Matthaus told German TV channel SF.
</P>
<P>
The revelation by Matthaus, holder of a world record 150 caps,
confirmed reports in Kicker magazine that such a plot existed.
</P>
<P>
The thinking behind the plot, according to Kicker, was to kill
two birds by one stone - get rid of Ribbeck and enforce Matthaus
to renounce his playing role.
</P>
<P>
Matthaus, presumably hurt by the implied slight on his playing
ability, claimed to have replied: "How can you imagine doing that?
"
</P>
<P>
He said he told his team-mates: "I have no experience and I
want to play myself which I could not do as coach. Anyway you can'
t just 'kill' a coach like this just before Euro."
</P>
<P>
Ribbeck resigned after Germany's disastrous defense of their
title ended with defeats by England and Portugal and a solitary
draw with Romania in Group A.

<HEADLINE> Top Seeds Enjoy Easy Wins at Wimbledon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Men's women's singles top seeds
both enjoyed comfortable victories in the first round of the
Wimbledon tennis championships here Monday.
</P>
<P>
World women's number one Martina Hingis put her 1999 Wimbledon
nightmare behind her to join the Williams sisters in the second
round at the All England Club.
</P>
<P>
After a 90-minute break for drizzle, Sandrine Testud became the
first seed to fall when she succumbed to crowd and media favorite
Anna Kournikova 7-5, 5-7, 6-4.
</P>
<P>
The French 10th seed battled back from a set and 5-2 down to
draw level but the Russian 19-year-old, currently plastered over
poster sites throughout London modeling a sports bra, recovered
her poise on center court to win on her fourth matchpoint.
</P>
<P>
Hingis, crushed in the first round last year by Australian
qualifier Jelena Dokic, outclassed Angeles Montilio 6-1, 6-2 on
court one but the inevitable was delayed when the Spaniard saved
seven matchpoints in the final game.
</P>
<P>
Sampras enjoyed an equally gentle start, beating Czech Jiri
Vanek 6-4, 6-4, 6-2 on center court.
</P>
<P>
The American, bidding for a record 13th grand slam title,broke
the 22-year-old Wimbledon debutant's serve in the first game and
never looked in danger. Vanek had played only one match on grass
before, in a challenger tournament in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Serena and Venus Williams also won easily. Fifth seed Venus
beat Kveta Hrdlickova of the Czech Republic 6-3, 6-1 while her
younger sister, seeded eighth, made a successful comeback from
injury to beat Swede Asa Carlsson 6-3, 6-2.
</P>
<P>
Williams was joined in the second round by 11th seed Anke Huber
of Germany, who wasted no time in beating Britain's Jo Ward 7-5, 6-
2.
</P>
<P>
In the men's draw, 1996 champion Richard Krajicek beat lucky-
loser Michael Kohlmann 3-6, 6-1, 6-4, 7-6 after the German took
Albert Costa's place in the draw.
</P>
<P>
France's Cedric Pioline, Wimbledon finalist in 1997, muscled
past Christian Ruud of Norway 7-6, 6-1, 4-6, 6-3.
</P>
<P>
Costa and fellow Spaniard Alex Corretja turned their backs on
the tournament on Sunday in a bitter row over seedings at the
famous grasscourt championships.
</P>
<P>
World number 11 Corretja and Costa, ranked 15, were furious
with organizers because they were not seeded. The Spaniards' best
results have come on hard and clay court surfaces.

<HEADLINE> North China Province Curbing Locust Plagues </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TAIYUAN, June 27 (Xinhua) -- North China's Shanxi Province is
now facing plagues of locusts.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government has spent 700,000 yuan (about 84,000
US dollars) and 20 tons of locust pesticides in seriously-
stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
Most of the 400,000 hectares of affected farmland are in poor
mountainous areas.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Agriculture has also allocated special funds to
deal with the locusts. More than 10,000 people have been
mobilized and 10 airplanes used to rid the province of locusts.
</P>
<P>
According to official sources, plagues of locusts from East
Asia have destroyed 930,000 ha of crops in Shandong, Henan, Hebei,
Anhui, Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces and Tianjin Municipality.
</P>
<P>
More than 2 million ha of farmland have been hit by Italian
locusts in Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region in northwest China.
</P>
<P>
Agricultural experts said that the total coverage of farmland
hit by locusts will probably expand from over 2 million to 3.3
million ha this summer.

<HEADLINE> Another 247 Chinese Firms Set up in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Another 247 Chinese companies
have set up subsidiaries in Shanghai since the beginning of the
year, with a total registered capital of 2.8 billion yuan (about
337 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
They bring the total number of companies in Shanghai from
elsewhere of the country to 12,000, with registered capital
amounting to 40 billion yuan, according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Shanghai has adopted a series of favorable
policies to attract companies elsewhere to invest in the city. The
policies cover taxation, land, loans, housing, as well as
education for the children of employees.
</P>
<P>
Hot investment areas include trade, agriculture, stocks, real
estate, consulting services, software development and the
education industry.
</P>
<P>
Last year, companies from elsewhere generated more than 20
billion yuan of added value, contributing to 0.7 percent growth of
Shanghai's gross domestic product (GDP).
</P>
<P>
A senior official at the Shanghai Municipal government said
that Shanghai will allow more companies from elsewhere to invest
in the city by adopting better policies and building a more
attractive investment environment.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Along Yangtze Contract to Grow Trees (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The "grain for trees and grass" plan is an important part of
China's ambitious strategy to curb serious soil erosion caused by
excessive logging and reclamation and turn the western areas into
a modern, prosperous, eco-friendly region.
</P>
<P>
China will give free grain to farmers who reforest their own
land, as the country has ample grain reserves thanks to years of
bumper harvests. The state will be responsible for the maintenance
of the saplings and trees.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan Province has taken the lead in covering barren hills
with trees. Nearly 1.2 million rural households have switched to
tree-planting under contract.
</P>
<P>
Yunnan Province, which has 800,000 ha of sloping fields, or 12.
5 percent of the province's total arable land, returned 50,000 ha
of farmland into woodland and grassland last year.
</P>
<P>
Chongqing Municipality has covered 884,666 ha of land with
vegetation, which has helped raise Chongqing's vegetation coverage
rate to 23.1 percent.
</P>
<P>
"As the contract system closely links tree-planting with
farmers' personal gain, they no longer view the afforestation
drive as a pointless endeavor. Moreover, tree growers will be able
to protect their interests," said Tang Shouzheng, a Chinese
forestry expert.
</P>
<P>
Li Jiqiong, a female farmer in Yuba Village of Sichuan Province,
said her family used to earn 450 yuan a year by toiling on their 0.
06 hectare of land for crop growing. Since Li answered the
government's call to replace sloping fields with trees early this
year, she has received a grain allowance of 300 yuan a year. Li
and her husband can now use their spare time to raise pigs or do
seasonal work.
</P>
<P>
"The income earned from this sideline occupation alone is more
than our previous total. Life has become easier than before," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Li's case has changed the attitude of farmers in the region.
Some who had chosen not to sign tree-planting contracts regretted
their decision and have applied to join the program.

<HEADLINE> Farmers Along Yangtze Contract to Grow Trees (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHENGDU, June 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.27 million rural
families in 120 counties at the upper reaches of the Yangtze River
have signed contracts with the local government to convert low-
yielding farmland into tree belts and pastures.
</P>
<P>
Qumu Arjia, a farmer of the Yi nationality living in this
stretch of the Yangtze, China's longest river, planted government-
supplied saplings on his 0.3-hectare patch of low-yielding
hillside this spring.
</P>
<P>
Though he carefully tended the trees, only 60 percent of them
survived. Fortunately, his government contract guaranteed fair
compensation for the loss.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, Qumu Arjia is required to turn his
farmland into a tree-covered area, and in turn, the local
government will give him 150 kg of ration grain, and 70 yuan (
about 8.4 U.S. dollars) for each hectare of farmland sacrificed.
These stipulations carry a five-year limit.
</P>
<P>
Qumu Arjia lives in Yanyuan County at the upper reaches of the
Yangtze. Nearly 20 percent of the land there is covered with steep-
sloped hills unsuitable for growing crops.
</P>
<P>
A tree-planting drive is being held at the source of Yangtze
River with the aim of improving the ecological environment.
</P>
<P>
"Cultivation of trees by rural families under contract is a new
form of afforestation which differs entirely from conventional
practice. The contract clearly defines the obligations, rights and
interests of both sides. Those who plant trees will reap profits,
thus inspiring farmers' enthusiasm for growing trees," said Wang
Zhibao, director of the State Forestry Administration.
</P>
<P>
In the past, he recalled, governments at different levels set
tree-planting quotas. Farmers were ordered to plant trees in the
spring; it made little difference if the saplings didn't live. As
a result, trees were planted every year and the survival rate was
very low.

<HEADLINE> Tanzania Urges to Expose Influential Persons in Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Vice President
Omar Ali Juma Monday called on his people to expose leaders and
influential persons who are alleged to be involved in
drug-trafficking in the country.
</P>
<P>
The vice president made the call here when officiating a
ceremony marking the International Day Against Drug Abuse and
Illicit Drug Trafficking which falls on June 26.
</P>
<P>
He said the government does not have information on any leader
or influential person involved in the illicit drug business and
that so far nobody has come forward to reveal the names of such
people.
</P>
<P>
"I would therefore ask the people with evidence to come forward
and submit the names of the leaders who are involved in this
illicit trade to the president, and I assure you they will be
dealt with accordingly," said Omar.
</P>
<P>
He told hundreds of people gathered at the central square of
the city the government is fully committed to eradicating the
drug menace in the country and will do all it can to build
capacity for law enforcers whom he said have done a commendable
job.
</P>
<P>
However, the vice president said illicit drug trade and abuse
are a complex problem that cannot be tackled by law enforcers
alone, and it needs cooperation of every Tanzanian citizen.
</P>
<P>
Inspector General of Police of Tanzania Omar Mahita was
recently quoted as saying that some 192 Tanzanians were arrested
in different countries and over 15,000 kilograms of illicit drugs
were seized between 1997 and 1999.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations has set June 26 as the International Day
Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Drug Trafficking in order to curb
the increasing drug menace worldwide. The theme this year is
Facing Reality: Denial, Corruption and Violence.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Sets up Fund for Agricultural Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 26 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's President Olusegun
Obasanjo has approved the establishment of a National Agricultural
Development Fund (NADF) in a bid to revitalize the country's
agricultural sector.
</P>
<P>
Announcing the fund's creation in Abuja at the weekend, the
Special Adviser to the President on Food Security, Ango
Abdullahi, said that the agency would provide farmers a reliable
access to funds at a very low interest rate and provide research
grants to institutes and funding for farm extension services.
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi revealed that the fund would start operating next
year and a take-off capital of 8 billion naira (80 million
dollars) had been earmarked, reported the News Agency of Nigeria
on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The Special Adviser was speaking when a committee, headed by
him to study the marketing problems of Nigerian farmers, submitted
its report to Minister of Agriculture and Rural Development Sani
Zango-Daura.  He also announced that the federal government
had established the National Crop Marketing Company (NCMC), with
the government owning 40 per cent equity participation to form the
initial take-off capital for the company.
</P>
<P>
Abdullahi said that funding for the NADF would come from the
government, levies on imported commodities and the subsidy on
fertilizer, while the government's 40 percent stake in the NCMC
could be sold to the public within the next six years.
</P>
<P>
He said that a bill concerning the two agencies would soon be
sent to the National Assembly.

<HEADLINE> Albright, Barak Hold Talks on Peace Process </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak started talks here
Tuesday night to discuss the Middle East peace process,
particularly issues concerning the Israeli-Palestinian final-status
talks.
</P>
<P>
Albright, who arrived in Israel earlier this evening, started
her late night meeting with Barak at the Prime Minister's Office.
The two were expected to focus on the possibility of convening a
three-way summit in Washington in the near future between Barak,
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat and U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
As the two began their talks inside Barak's office, thousands of
Jewish settlers gathered outside the hotel where Albright is
staying to protest against U.S. interference in the Israeli-
Palestinian peace talks.
</P>
<P>
Over 30 buses took the demonstrators from various settlements of
the West Bank to the street outside the hotel and the protesters
shouted anti-U.S. slogans and ask Albright to "go home."
</P>
<P>
Some demonstrators held up signs warning, "Clinton, God will
punish you."
</P>
<P>
The main purpose of Albright's current visit to the region is to
arrange the U.S.-Israeli-Palestinian peacemaking summit in
Washington which is opposed by Arafat, who fears the U.S. would
side with Israel on many issues and he would be pressured into
concessions.
</P>
<P>
The palestinian side said the time is not ripe for a summit
because too many gaps still remain between the two sides in the
final-status talks.
</P>
<P>
But Barak wants this top-level gathering, saying the
negotiations with the Palestinians have reached a stage in which
the leaders have to make decisions on all key issues of the peace
talks.
</P>
<P>
Barak also brought U.S. Middle East envoy Dennis Ross to meet
his coalition partners on Tuesday to persuade them to back him to
strike a peace deal with the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> UAE Stresses Peaceful Solution to Islands Dispute with Iran </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The United Arab Emirates on
Tuesday reiterated its willingness to solve the long-standing
dispute with Iran over three Gulf islands through peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Matar Al Neyadi, advisor of the UAE Standing Committee of the
Borders, also stressed the important role the International Court
of Justice could play in solving the UAE-Iran dispute over Abu
Musa, and Greater and Lesser Tunbs, reported the official WAM news
agency.
</P>
<P>
He was speaking at a one-day seminar on the islands dispute held
at the headquarters of the Federal National Council (parliament).
</P>
<P>
The Standing Committee of the Borders, led by Defence Minister
Mohammad Bin Rashid al-Maktoum, is in charge of border affairs with
neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the UAE delegation to the 27th foreign ministers'
meeting of the Organization of the Islamic Conference (OIC),
opening Tuesday in the Malaysian capital of Kuala Lumpur, also
called on Iran to take a peaceful approach in resolving the
dispute.
</P>
<P>
The three islands, located near key shipping lanes in the Gulf,
are claimed by both the UAE and Iran, but have been controlled by
Tehran since 1971, when British forces retreated from the region.
</P>
<P>
The UAE has been calling for direct and unconditional bilateral
negotiations with Iran over the issue. Should bilateral
negotiations fail, the UAE wants the dispute to be resolved through
the arbitration of the International Court of Justice.

<HEADLINE> Britain Calls For Fresh Start in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Cook said the time is right for "national reconciliation in
Zimbabwe".
</P>
<P>
With Mugabe's Zanu-PF party winning just over half the seats,
Cook said he hoped the president would "recognize the clearly-
expressed will of the people for a fresh start".
</P>
<P>
Cook said Britain was still prepared to deliver 36 million
pounds (about 54 million United States dollars) of aid, much of it
to fund land reforms benefiting Zimbabwe's rural poor, if Mugabe
adopted policies which "respond to the needs of the people".
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for... a willingness to work with the opposition
in parliament," Cook told reporters.
</P>
<P>
"I'm looking for a return to the rule of law... in respect to
land reform, and the decisions which need to be faced up to avert
the economic crisis in Zimbabwe," he said.
</P>
<P>
He insisted that the aid package was still on the table, but
only if Mugabe took up the offer of the opposition party to work
together to restore law and order and tackle Zimbabwe's deep
economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
"It will only be spent if they adopt policies that bring
economic sense to Zimbabwe and respond to the needs of the people.
The severe economic circumstances of the country and the urgent
social need of its people require a common effort and a new spirit
of co-operation,"he said.
</P>
<P>
"Britain is ready to look for a fresh start and a new
relationship with the government (of Zimbabwe), if it pursues
policies of reform and national reconciliation," Cook said.
</P>
<P>
Cook, a fierce critic of Mugabe in the run-up to weekend
elections called for national reconciliation in the former British
colony.
</P>
<P>
Britain led international condemnation of the violence in
Zimbabwe ahead of the elections, particularly the wave of
invasions of white-owned farms by veterans of Zimbabwe's 1970s war
of independence.
</P>
<P>
But Mugabe appeared to take little notice of the criticism,
which he portrayed as neo-colonial interference and sought to turn
to his advantage by shoring up internal support.

<HEADLINE> OPEC To Increase Output if Crude's High Price in Kept </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CARACAS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The Organization of Petroleum
Exporting Countries (OPEC) will increase production further in
order to stabilize the international market if demand and prices
stay high, OPEC President Ali Rodriguez, also Venezuelan minister
of mines and energy, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Rodriguez said the petroleum cartel will analyze market
behavior to take the decision, and warned one or two weeks will
have to go by in order to evaluate the impact of production's
recent growth.
</P>
<P>
OPEC agreed at its June 21 meeting in Vienna to increase
production by 708,000 barrels a day (bpd) from July 1, which would
place its total production at 25.4 million dollars a day.
</P>
<P>
In Venezuela's case, oil production will go up after next month
about 81,000 bpd to 2.92 million bpd, said the minister. He said
that state company Venezuela Petroleum is far from reaching its
production limit, and is capable of making new increases.
</P>
<P>
According to the price band, OPEC members will increase or cut
back automatically their production by 500,000 barrels a day if
prices are kept during 20 continual days above 28 dollars a barrel
or below 22 dollars a barrel.
</P>
<P>
Measures taken by OPEC, such as the increase in production and
the price band, managed to bring down in April international
prices by over 3 dollars, which had gotten to the highest level in
the last nine years.
</P>
<P>
In recent days they returned to above 30 dollars a barrel and
the price of Venezuela's petroleum basket was Tuesday at 29
dollars a barrel, an increase of 90 dollar cents compared with
last week, added the minister.

<HEADLINE> U.N. Special Envoy Seeks Lasting Dialogue Between Children in Northern Ireland </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. special
representative for children and armed conflict, Olara Otunnu, is
in Northern Ireland for a two-day conference in a bid to establish
a last dialogue between children from both Nationalist and
Unionist communities and the province's decision makers, a U.N.
spokesman said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. spokesman, Manoel de Almedia e Silva, told a press
conference here that the conference is entitled "Building the
Future: Young People and the Troubles."
</P>
<P>
During the conference, Otunnu proposed that youth groups
across Northern Ireland organize a Children's Manifesto,
identifying priority areas to be addressed by both government and
civil society, said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. special representative also proposed the discussion
of a new Children's Commission, a mechanism to ensure that issues
affecting young people are routinely incorporated into all
relevant aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.
</P>
<P>
During his stay, Otunnu is visiting several communities, both
Nationalist and Unionist, including Ardoyne, the Shankhill Road
and New Lodge. He has also visited schools involved in the "
Education for Mutual Understanding" program, which uses curricular
projects to bridge the sectarian divide.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu has had meetings with the British secretary of state
for Northern Ireland, Peter Mandelson, as well as Kenneth
Bloomfield, the victims commissioner, and Lord Alderdice, the
speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Otunnu will visit the province's minister of education, Martin
McGuinness, and junior ministers from the offices of the first
minister and deputy first minister, he said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Lawmakers Agree to Ease Cuba Sanctions </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Republican leaders of the U.S.
House of Representatives on Tuesday reached an agreement to allow
direct sales of U.S. food and medicine to Cuba for the first time
in nearly four decades.
</P>
<P>
The deal, which was reached after more than five hours of
overnight negotiations, would clear the way for congressional
approval of calls by U.S. farm and business groups to exempt food
and medicine from unilateral embargoes.
</P>
<P>
Proponents argue that the Cuban embargo is a futile Cold War
relic and that economic engagement would be more effective to
encourage change, along with benefiting U.S. farmers.
</P>
<P>
In a concession to opponents, however, the agreement would bar
both the federal government and U.S. banks from financing such
sales.
</P>
<P>
In addition to easing the Cuban embargo, the proposed
legislation would also prohibit the president from including food
and medicine in future embargoes of other countries without
congressional approval.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Tuesday that President
Bill Clinton does not oppose the Republican plan to relax
sanctions to allow sales of food and medicine to Cuba but is
concerned by the initiative to limit presidential powers to manage
embargoes.
</P>
<P>
The Senate voted overwhelmingly last year to ease the Cuban
embargo but the House refused to go along. Senators were not
involved in negotiating Tuesday's agreement.
</P>
<P>
The Republican lawmakers said the new compromise should move
legislatively soon but they have to look for a vehicle to get the
agreement signed into law.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Official Calls for International Cooperation on Drug Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
"International cooperation is the most effective deterrent to
the social, economic, and political havoc drug criminals cause,"
said Barry R. McCaffrey, Director of the Office of U.S. National
Drug Control Policy, in a press release.
</P>
<P>
"While drug rings are powerful, they aren't omnipotent," said
McCaffrey, who just returned from a visit to China, Vietnam,
Thailand and other Asian countries with a high-level U.S. drug
policy delegation.
</P>
<P>
"By pooling knowledge, intelligence, treatment options,
educational methods, prevention techniques, investigative tools,
prosecutorial successes and financial acumen, we can weaken outlaw
enterprises that rely on global fragmentation and lack of
political will," he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged all peoples in the world to unite against the drug
threat and the danger it poses for the children.
</P>
<P>
According to the press release, illegal drugs cost 110 billion
dollars and claim 52,000 lives a year in the United States.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey estimated that internationally, the annual wealth of
today's illegal drug trade is 400 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
He warned that a complex web of trafficking and distribution
routs now brings addictive substances to nearly every corner of
the world and the illegal drug trade is inextricably linked with
other aspects of international organized crime, including
prostitution and smuggling of illegal weapons.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey lauded the efforts made by the Chinese government to
fight against drug trafficking and to stop the flow of drugs from
the "Golden Triangle" in Asia, saying China implemented a number
of prevention and law-enforcement initiatives.
</P>
<P>
He said that more than 10 percent of China's 1.3 billion people
reportedly visited a nationwide anti-narcotics exhibit and some 6,
000 sets of a traveling anti-drug educational display were
produced by the Chinese government in 1999.
</P>
<P>
McCaffrey said the government of Laws, the third largest
producer of illicit heroin in the world, is attempting to tackle
the problem and has joined the UN Drug Control Program in an
ambitious plan to eliminate opium cultivation within six years.
</P>
<P>
He also hailed the efforts made by Thailand, saying the country
is a major drug-transit country that made significant progress in
the areas of eradication, crop substitution, drug-abuse prevention
and treatment.

rebel group, the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which is
allegedly financed by Ben Laden.
</P>
<P>
French investigators said that he stayed for several months in
the Philippines last year and traveled several times to a number
of unspecified Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
His role was reportedly to establish an "operational link"
between the MILF and Islamic groups in Europe.
</P>
<P>
He was also suspected to have been a member of an Islamic
network in Afghanistan and had been trained in a military camp
there.
</P>
<P>
France has been cooperating for several months with the United
States in hunting down an international Islamic network held
responsible for the bombing of the U.S. embassies in Kenya and
Tanzania in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Ben Laden is accused by the United States of masterminding the
attacks, which killed 224 people.
</P>
<P>
The alleged Islamic network commanded by Ben Laden has
recruited members in France, Britain, Bosnia, Turkey, Australia,
Malaysia and sub-Saharan African countries, said French police.
</P>
<P>
The arrest of Boulanouar by the Philippine authorities took
place two days after the U.S. secret service arrested on December
14, 1999, an Algerian man at the Canadian-U.S. border for
possessing 60 kilograms of explosives.
</P>
<P>
The Algerian man, Ahmed Ressam, had several French telephone
numbers on him when he was arrested.

<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Africa needs no less than 60 billion
U.S. dollars to meet the international standard of one telephone
line to 100 people, African Telecommunications Union (ATU)
Secretary-General Jan Mutai said.
</P>
<P>
Nigerian press Tuesday quoted Mutai as saying at the opening
session of the first Global Information Infrastructure Commission
(GIIC) conference in Abuja that the amount, if available, could be
used to provide 60 million new telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
Currently, only two percent of some 700 million population in
Africa has access to the 17 million telephone lines in the
continent. The rate is far below the global average of 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
Mutai said that despite past difficulties, "Africa today
presents the largest untapped market potential, offering clearly
above average returns to the investors."
</P>
<P>
The conference with the theme of "the Communications
Infrastructure Development: The Challenges of Attracting
Investment in Africa", is being hosted by GIIC Africa and
Nigeria's Ministry of Communications.
</P>
<P>
President Olusegun Obasanjo, in his address, said the theme of
the conference "is not only appropriate and timely but also
touches on the fundamental objective of my government and indeed
all African countries."

<HEADLINE> Over 10 Million Ugandans to Vote in National Referendum </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- More than 10.5 million out of 20
million Ugandans will vote in the June 29 referendum which will
determine the political system of the country, chairman of the
National Electoral Commission Aziz Kasujja said here Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
At 17,000 polling stations across the country, the voters at or
above the age of 18 will answer the question "which Political
System Do You Wish To Adopt, Movement or Multi-party," said
Kasujja.
</P>
<P>
He said that the announcement of result will come out within 48
hours after the voting ends.
</P>
<P>
After it came to power in 1986, the National Resistance
Movement undertook the task of making a new constitution for
Uganda. The new constitution promulgated in 1995 stipulates that a
national referendum is to be held on June 29, 2000, to enable
Ugandans to choose between multi- party and single-party political
system.
</P>
<P>
"A 'bus' symbol for the Movement Political System and a 'dove'
for the Multi-party Political System shall be used on the ballot
paper for the referendum to facilitate the exercise of a choice by
the voter because of the high level of illiteracy among the
population," said Kasujja.
</P>
<P>
According to the chairman, the budget for holding the
referendum was 12. 95 billion Uganda shillings (about 8.63 million
U.S. dollars).

LUSAKA, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Zambia's ruling party Tuesday threw
out a petition from a suspended senior official of the ruling
party for impeaching party President Frederick Chiluba on the
ground that Chiluba has violated the party constitution.
</P>
<P>
National Secretary of the ruling Movement for Multi-Party
Democracy (MMD) , Michael Sata, rejected the petition by member of
the MMD National Executive Committee (NEC), Moses Kaunda,
demanding the NEC to impeach Chiluba.
</P>
<P>
In a letter to Kaunda, Sata said Kaunda's membership of the
party has been suspended and therefore he could not petition the
NEC to do or undo an act as that privilege is only restricted to
party members.
</P>
<P>
The Post newspaper Tuesday quoted Kaunda as saying here on
Monday that if the NEC ignored his petition he would go to court
for redress.

NEW YORK, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Wall Street stocks ended lower
Tuesday in a late session retreat ahead the Federal Reserve's move
on interest rates.
</P>
<P>
The Dow Jones industrial average closed down 38.53 at 10,504.46
and the technology heavy Nasdaq composite index fell 53.16 at 3,
858.96.
</P>
<P>
Boarder stock indicators were mostly lower. The Standard &AMP; Poor
's 500 index fell 4.76 at 1,450.55.
</P>
<P>
The market retreated in the late session from an early rally
with a desire to lock in profits before the Federal Reserve
announces its decision on rates Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve began a two-day meeting on rates Tuesday
and analysts mostly expected the central bankers to leave rates
unchanged. But a few analysts did not rule out the possibility of
a one more quarter-percentage point increase in August well before
the November election.
</P>
<P>
The Federal Reserve has raised rate six times in the past year
in an effort to cool off the U.S. economy and keep inflation under
control. In response to the higher rates, the U.S. economy has
showed signs of slowing.
</P>
<P>
The Conference Board, a prominent research group, said in a
survey Tuesday the U.S. consumer confidence index fell nearly 6.0
points to 138.8 in June, showing the latest sign of slowdown in
the economy. But the new data did not encourage investors who
remained uncertain about rates.

BUENOS AIRES, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The new round of negotiations
for "Mercosur Relaunching" ended Tuesday in Buenos Aires with some
important advances although there also are divergencies in
substantial matters, a source from Argentina's Foreign Ministry
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
Among advances, the source mentioned the consensus reached for
the "Brasilia Protocol" review, which establishes mechanisms for
controversy solutions and tribunal validity, now "ad hoc," to
solve trade quarrels.
</P>
<P>
The other achievement it highlighted was the existing consensus
to deepen the relation of integration with Chile.
</P>
<P>
As regards existing disputes, it referred to discrepancies in
what it does to "trade defense," where Brazil questions
antidumping techniques Argentina applies, while Argentina
criticizes Brazil's artificial subsidies.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, Brazil's main negotiator for the Southern
Common Market (Mercosur), Jose Botafogo Goncalvez, said that the
vehicle accord between Argentina and Brazil "is closed."
</P>
<P>
Brazil's negotiator said that everything's consensured,
referring to the accord framework's small writing signed at the
end of March.
</P>
<P>
He added that what he'll do is to discuss with Paraguay and
Uruguay the already agreed upon policy between Mercosur's two main
associates: Argentina and Brazil.

MEXICO CITY, June 27 (Xinhua) -- Guatemala demanded Tuesday the
United Kingdom's explanation for military support offered to
Belize, to which it is claiming devolution of 12,000 square
kilometers of land.
</P>
<P>
Guatemala's acting Foreign Minster Rafael Salazar said that in
the land dispute with Belize, "we're always disposed to sit at the
negotiating table," according to reports coming from Guatemala's
capital.
</P>
<P>
Salazar said that "we're requesting an explanation from the
British Embassy in Guatemala as there's no justification for an
increase of this kind of foreign armed elements in the area."
</P>
<P>
Belize's government disclosed around June 15 a communique,
according to which Britain offered it political and military
support.
</P>
<P>
British Defense Minister John Spellar expressed satisfaction
for the presence of a support unit for army training in Belize and

<HEADLINE> Biotechnology Industry's Economic Contributions Described </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LOS ANGELES, June 27 (Xinhua) -- The U.S. biotechnology
industry doubled in size between 1993 and 1999 and generated
nearly half a million jobs last year, an industry's advocacy group
reported Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
By comparison, biotech firms in the United States directly
employed more people than all the companies in the toy and
sporting goods industries, said the Biotechnology Industry
Organization (BIO), quoting a new study.
</P>
<P>
The BIO's study found the medical biotech industry in 1999
spent 11 billion U.S. dollars on research and development, more
than 50 percent of its revenues, which totaled 20 billion dollars
for the year from 8 billion dollars in 1993. Biotech firms focused
on agriculture employed 22,000 workers and earned 2.3 billion
dollars in revenues.
</P>
<P>
The BIO defines biotechnology as "the use of the cellular and
molecular processes to solve problems or make products." Included
in the definition of the industry are firms that use cells and
biological molecules for applications in medicine, agriculture and
environmental management.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the completion of the rough draft of the full DNA
sequence of the human genome, the BIO said in a statement Monday
that the map will speed development of more advanced medicines by
beginning to eliminate much of the guesswork from drug research
and development.
</P>
<P>
The biotechnology industry has been exploring the human genome
for 25 years and using genetic information to develop new
diagnostics, drugs and vaccines for diseases, the BIO said. Nearly
100 biotech medicines already are on the market, and another 350
are in late-stage clinical trials.
</P>
<P>
"As we learn more about our genome and ourselves, we will
confront new bioethical issues involving privacy, discrimination
and intellectual property," the BIO said in the statement. "How we
handle these issues will affect public acceptance of our efforts
to use genetic information to improve human and animal health."

WASHINGTON, June 27 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Attorney General Janet
Reno defended her decisions Tuesday not to appoint an independent
counsel to investigate Vice President Al Gore for his 1996
campaign fund raising.
</P>
<P>
"I have not been shy about appointing independent counsels when
the facts and the law required it," Reno said at a Senate
Judiciary Committee hearing.
</P>
<P>
"The fact that several people have advised me at various times
to seek the appointment of an independent counsel... should come
as no surprise to anyone," Reno said in her testimony.
</P>

"In each and every instance... there were always people of the
opposite view," she added.
</P>
<P>
Robert Conrad, head of the Justice Department's campaign
finance task force, has recommended that a special counsel be
appointed to investigate Gore for possible false statements on a
fund-raising event at a Buddhist temple in California in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Reno has twice refused to appoint independent counsels to
investigate the vice president.
</P>

candidate, claimed that he did not know he was attending a fund-
raising event when he went to the temple.
