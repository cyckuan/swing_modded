as against Thursday's close of 3,180.73.
</P>
<P>
The national index also fell by 38.04 points to 1,355.70 from

The BSE-200 and U.S. dollar index were quoted down at 309.01
and 121.08 compared with the previous close of 317.36 and 124.73
respectively.
</P>
<P>
Equities suffered a fresh setback pushing the sensitive index
sharply down by over 91 points on the last day of the current
settlement on BSE market Friday due to sustained bull liquidation
and lack of worthwhile support from institutional investors.
</P>
<P>
The market, which was affected due to the political uncertainty
during the last couple of days, encountered fresh selling pressure
in the form of squaring up business and investors' disinterest in

electric power plants.
</P>
<P>
A sizable portion of the loan will be earmarked for the
expansion of potable water networks in rural areas to serve about
1.3 million people, according to Friday's Arab daily "Al Hayat."
</P>
<P>
This is the second most important loan to be extended to
Morocco by the World Bank. Morocco obtained last month loans to
the tune of 150 million dollars for the promotion of institutional
savings and the development of the system of retirement and
pensions.
</P>
<P>
RIYADH -- The board of directors of Saudi Arabia's Arab

fertilizers complex in the Suez Gulf industrial zone.
</P>
<P>
The loan agreement was singed on June 28 at the company head

<HEADLINE> Africa Should Seek Its Own Modes for Democracy: </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican President Joaquim
Chissano has blasted at poverty and insecurity in Africa, saying
they have been the true obstacles to people's participation in
the democratization process in Africa.
</P>
<P>
It is very difficult for Africa to maintain a single mode for
democracy, since there are various cultures and traditions in
Africa, he told the symposium with the theme of "Africa and
Globalization: Challenges for Democracy and Governance" at its
opening ceremony here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The symposium was sponsored by the United Nations Educational,
Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).
</P>
<P>
Chissano noted at the meeting that some existing modes in
Africa are non-African, referring to the imported modes for
democracy, economic structure and development to Africa in the
second half of 1980s.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, he said, "will provide an opportunity for us to
introduce to the world our accumulated experiences over the years
in resolving peacefully the conflict, achieving national
reconciliation and respecting human rights, which would help
strengthen UNESCO's intervention ability."
</P>
<P>
Federico Mayor, director general of UNESCO, said in his speech
at the opening ceremony that the African continent should
gradually reduce its reliance on imported life mode which had
been the fragile "evil root" for most democratization process in
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"Africa should no longer be the warehouse of raw materials and
cheap labor. It should refuse any imposed mode," he added.
</P>
<P>
Mayor suggested that a best mode be designed by African
thinkers, academics, statesmen, religious experts and others, so
that a common wish for political and economic reform would be put
into practice.
</P>
<P>
The meeting scheduled to end Saturday has drawn
representatives from the Mozambican government, U.N. institutions
and others at home and abroad.

<HEADLINE> New Cheif of S. African Communist Party Elected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- South African parliament member
Blade Nzimande was elected South African Communist Party (SACP)
chief Thursday at a party congress, the Star paper reported Friday.
</P>
<P>
Nzimande, a parliament member of the ruling African National
Congress (ANC), was elected unopposed to succeed Charles Nqakula as
General Secretary of the SACP at the party's 10th annual congress
in Johannesburg, the report said.
</P>
<P>
This means Nzimanda will have to resign as chairman of parliament's
portfolio committee on education and give up his seat in the National
Assembly.
</P>
<P>
Nzimande's position is likely to be crucial as the SACP continues
to attempt to redefine its role within the ruling tripartite alliance
of the ANC, the SACP and the Congress of South African Trade Unions,
and in the broader political spectrum in South Africa.
</P>
<P>
Nqakula was also elected unopposed as the National Chairman of the
SACP. His role, however, will be mainly ceremonial.
</P>
<P>
Welfare and Population Development Minister Geraldine
Fraser-Moleketi, who has emerged as one of the SACP's most senior
representatives in the government, was elected as deputy national
chairman.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Airways Profit Jumps </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Kenya Airways made a profit of
1.44 billion Shillings (about 24 million U.S. Dollars) before tax
in 1997, showing an increase of 32 percent over the previous
year.
</P>
<P>
A notice of the company to shareholders was quoted Friday by
the Daily Nation newspaper as saying "the results were good given
the harsh operating conditions" caused by a sharp decline in the
number of tourists visiting Kenya.
</P>
<P>
The company's net profit imporved to 1.31 billion Shillings
(more than 21.8 million U.S. Dollars) during the year, up 54
percent over 1996.
</P>
<P>
Following the improved profitability, the company paid 121.7
million Shillings (about 2.03 million U.S. Dollars) in
corporation tax last year.
</P>
<P>
The company said that the progressive development of the
airline's route network which provided convenient links between
major cities produced a 21 percent growth in business within
Africa.
</P>
<P>
"The introduction of an all jet operation has strengthened our
competitive position and our alliances with KLM (the Dutch
Airline) have produced tangible benefits both in revenues and
costs," said L.G. Kamau, a senior official with the airline.
</P>
<P>
However, he said that the company's operating costs rose by
6.7 percent in 1996, while overheads jumped to 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
The improved performance is expected to boost the company's
share price at the Nairobi Stock Exchange which was 7.20
Shillings per share Thursday.

<HEADLINE> Bonn Warns against Fund-Raising for Armed Rebellion in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The German government has warned leaders
of Kosovo Albanians against using funds raised in Germany to buy
weapons for the Kosovo Liberation Army, the rebels fighting for
independence for Kosovo, the German Foreign Ministry said Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to a Foreign Ministry spokesman, the warning had been
convoyed both to Ibrahim Rugovo, a moderate Kosovo Albanian leader,
and Bujar Bukoshi, a Kosovo leader who describes himself as the prime
minister in exile and who now lives in Bonn.
</P>
<P>
The reaction from Bonn came after the special U.S. envoy, Richard
Holbrooke, said in an interview with the German newspaper Die Woche
that the Kosovo rebels were receiving funds and recruits from
supporters living in Germany, Switzerland and Denmark.
</P>
<P>
The Kosovo Liberation Army is known as the guerilla army fighting
for the independence of Kosovo on behalf of the ethnic Albanians who
make up about 90 percent of the population in the Serbian province.
</P>
<P>
Since Yugoslavia stripped Kosovo of its autonomy in 1991, more than
650,000 ethnic Albanians are said to have fled the province and about
140,000 of them have come to Germany seeking asylum.
</P>
<P>
In all, about 400,000 Kosovo Albanians now live in Germany.
</P>
<P>
The German government favor strengthened autonomy for the ethnic
Albanian majority in Kosovo, but not an independent state.
</P>
<P>
The German news agency DPA quoted government sources as saying that
there were still no concrete evidence about any "forced collection" of
funds or recruiting of ethnic Albanians living in Germany for the
Kosovo Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
The DPA also quoted an aide to Bukoshi as saying that the Kosovo
"exile government" in Bonn had been collecting a duty of three percent
of incomes from Kosovo Albanian exiles all over the world, but the
money was intended for humanitarian purposes, not for purchasing
weapons.

<HEADLINE> S. Africa to Levy Tax on Cross-Border Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa is working on
fiscal measures to clamp down on commercial goods that enter
South Africa via the inefficiently controlled borders of neighbor
countries.
</P>
<P>
A 14 percent value-added tax on commercial goods from
neighboring countries into South Africa would be implemented
later this year, South African revenue service said in a
statement Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Talks to this effect are under way with South Africa's
partners in the Southern African Customs Union (SACU) - Botswana,
Lesotho, Namibia and Swaziland, South African media reported
Friday.
</P>
<P>
The measures are aimed at cracking down on the smugglers who
had avoided customs duties for years by smuggling goods into
South Africa's neighboring countries, and exporting them on to
South Africa, the revenue service said.
</P>
<P>
The tax will affect goods worth more than 10,500 Rand (1,909
Dollars), with some exemptions.
</P>
<P>
The government made the decision to tighten the borders last
year, the revenue service said.
</P>
<P>
Guidelines are being drafted ahead of the formal introduction
of the measures to ensure that they would not discourage
intra-customs union trade.

<HEADLINE> India's West Bengal Shut Down by Industrial Strike </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- An industrial strike was held in
India's West Bengal state Friday in protest against the
government's economic policy and its general and railway budgets
for 1998-99.
</P>
<P>
Reports reaching here said the normal life in West Bengal was
disrupted by the 24-hour strike called by major trade unions.
</P>
<P>
Shops and trading centers were closed and activities in all
major industrial sectors in the state came to a standstill as
strikers picketed their respective organizations.
</P>
<P>
Buses and trams, private mini-buses and taxis were off the
roads in response to calls for the strike. Calcutta Stock Exchange
opened as usual in the morning, but later was closed due to
circumstances caused by the strike. Attendance at central
government offices and banks was thin as most trade unions
responded to the strike calls.
</P>
<P>
Train services on the eastern railway's Howrah and Sealdah
division were disrupted by strikers at different stations. Indian
Airlines' Calcutta-bound Mumbai and Delhi flights could not land
due to non-availability of meteorological briefing at the airport,
airline sources said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, opposition members in the Upper House of Parliament
Friday made a scathing attack on the government for what they
called wrong economic policies which had led to rises in prices of
essential commodities. Members of Congress, the biggest opposition
party in Parliament, said the poor have been badly hit by the
rising prices of edible oil, wheat flour, rice, fruits and
vegetables, especially the onions, in recent weeks.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, left party MPs Friday held a demonstration in

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Sets Deadline For Gazprom's Tax </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin has
set a deadline of less than 24 hours for gas giant Gazprom to come
up with a solution to tax arrears owed to the state.
</P>
<P>
The president made the demand in talks Friday with Rem
Vyakhirev, chief of the partially state-owned Gazprom, the world's
biggest gas producer, presidential spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky
said.
</P>
<P>
But the spokesman said solutions essential for both Gazprom and
the Russian economy had come out of the meeting.
</P>
<P>
A "steady system for checking debts and conducting offset
payments" would be worked out to allow Gazprom to pay its taxes,
and get paid by customers whose arrears to Gazprom had piled up
its debt, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides had a "fairly stiff talk" about the situation
over the gas company. Gazprom was warned by the government on
Thursday to pay its tax debt or face seizure of property, he said.
</P>
<P>
The gas company was blamed for defaulting on current tax
payments to the federal budget. According to Deputy Prime Minister
Oleg Sysuyev, Gazprom has paid only a third of its tax dues by
June.
</P>
<P>
Yeltsin stressed at the meeting that it is necessary for all to
fully pay taxes, no matter whether it is a big or small enterprise
or a monopoly, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
On a related development, Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko
insisted that everybody in Russia should pay taxes, including
Gazprom.
</P>
<P>
"The government is interested in one thing only -- tax
payments." He warned about the imposition of forced measures in
tax collection.
</P>
<P>
Moscow has begun putting pressure on companies in tax arrears
to pay up. The action is part of a government austerity package
aimed at avoiding financial collapse.

his libero position which had been grabbed by veteran Lothar Matthaus.
</P>
<P>
"I will do all it takes to get my position back," said the Schalke
04 midfielder in Nice on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
But he refused to comment on the performance of Matthaus, who had
appeared pivotal in the latest games.
</P>
<P>
"I don't know whether Lothar is the best man in this position. I'm
not qualified to answer that question," said Thon.
</P>
<P>
Concerning the media relations, he said: "I'm not paranoid. I don't
think I have been the victim of a media campaign in favor of
Matthaus."
</P>
<P>
"The World Cup is a very demanding championship. And it's normal
that there is some rotation of players."

<HEADLINE> Heart Disease Main Killer in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Heart disease has been the main
killer in Cyprus since more than 50 percent of Cypriot deaths are
heart-related, a local cardiologist said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Launching a new book by the Cyprus Heart Foundation "Coronary
Heart Disease -- What You Should Know About it," Dr. Pambis
Nicolaides told reporters that Cyprus has the highest number of
cardiologists per capita in Europe and offers high-standard
diagnosis and treatment methods, but prevention is at low levels
as a result of the Cypriot lifestyle.
</P>
<P>
The high number of smokers on the island, estimated at about 24
percent of the 850,000 population, unhealthy diet and lack of
exercise are the main reasons Cypriots develop heart disease, he
said.
</P>
<P>
He quoted a survey as showing about 4 percent of elementary
school children, 16 percent of high school students, 55 percent in
technical schools and 12 percent of Cyprus University students
smoke.
</P>
<P>
According to World Health Organization (WHO) figures, 12
million people worldwide die prematurely every year as a result
of heart failure and half of these deaths can be avoided.
</P>
<P>
The WHO figures also show that two thirds of the reduction in
deaths from heart related problems are due to prevention and only
one third to modern treatment methods.
</P>
<P>
Nicolaides said the aim of the book is to increase public
awareness on heart-related diseases.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the Cyprus Heart Foundation hopes to create an
independent heart center on the island in the future, so that
Cypriot heart patients can be operated on locally in the best
possible conditions and Cyprus becomes a regional cardio-surgical
center.
</P>
<P>
An island-wide study on coronary heart disease will also be
carried out by the foundation in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Vogts to Play Card of Fast Passes in Front </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LYON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- German coach Berti Vogts said Friday he
would play the card of fast passes in the front when his team attempts
to crack open a tight Croatian defence here.
</P>
<P>
"I think we can cause them some problems if we link up quickly up
front and push down our left wing," said Vogts, whose team will play
Croatia in a World Cup quarterfinal here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
He said Croatia played in a style like Yugoslavia, which Germany
beat in a group game, but were more aggressive and rugged.
</P>
<P>
"They have some very good individual players, particularly Zvonimir
Boban and Davor Suker. They also have an extremely solid defence that
does not let anything through.
</P>
<P>
Vogts said his team was very prepared against Croatia, which lost
to Germany 2-1 in the European championship in 1996.
</P>
<P>
"We have a good defence, two extremely efficient strikers and very
good team spirit within the squad, who have worked very hard and are
mentally ready for this game."

<HEADLINE> Gazprom Considers Canceling Trust Accord </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian gas giant Gazprom is
considering an annulment of its trust contract with the Russian
government, Gazprom chief Rem Vyakhirev said Friday.
</P>
<P>
After separate talks Friday with President Boris Yeltsin and
Prime Minister Sergei Kiriyenko, Vyakhirev said: "Probably on
Tuesday, we most likely will make the decision to break the trust
contract."
</P>
<P>
The contract for trust management of the government's 35
percent stake in Gazprom was signed by Vyakhirev and Kiriyenko,
then fuel and energy minister, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Prime Minister on Thursday ordered the abolition of
the trust agreement with Gazprom because of its shortfall in tax
payments, and it was intended to convene an extraordinary meeting
of Gazprom shareholders.
</P>
<P>
But Vyakhirev said an accord had been made on a new tax debt
repayment scheme to work from July 1, under which Gazprom
undertook to pay all the tax owed to the federal budget on the
condition that enterprises pay their debts to the company for gas
deliveries.
</P>
<P>
A commission was set up to prepare a draft document on
settlements between Gazprom and the government, he said.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Arrests Suspects of Bombings </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Lebanese military intelligence has
arrested 11 of a 20-man terrorist ring that has engineered a
series of bomb explosions in the past two years, including the
recent grenade blast near the U.S. Embassy in Beirut.
</P>
<P>
The National Broadcast Network radio quoted a military source
as saying that nine of the ring are still at large.
</P>
<P>
Most of the ring are ex-members of the outlawed Lebanese
Forces (LF) and are controlled by the central LF bureau in
Australia "possibly with direct support and guidance from
Israel's intelligence apparatuses."
</P>
<P>
The LF was the Christians' main militia during Lebanon's
1975-1990 sectarian civil war and has been opposed to Syrian
military presence in Lebanon. Syria has been deploying a 40,000
forces in Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Its leader Maronite Christian Samir Geagea, is currently on
trial for the 1987 assassination of Sunni Muslim Prime Minister
Rashid Karami.
</P>
<P>
The 11 detainees have confessed that they staged a gunfire
attack that killed a Syrian driver in northern Beirut on December
12, 1996 and bombed the newly-opened public transport station used
by Lebanese and Syrian transportation services near the Beirut
port on October 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
They also confessed to frequent bombing attacks on the offices
of the National Syrian Socialist Party across the country in the
past three months.
</P>
<P>
The ring also said that they had sent faxes to banking and
trading firms calling for an armed uprising.
</P>
<P>
A communique distributed by Lebanese intelligence said the
clue that led to the discovery of the ring was the June 19 car
bomb blast in Beirut's low-income residential neighborhood of Dora.
</P>
<P>
The two men killed by an explosive charge they were carrying in
the car belonged to the "shock troops" of the LF.
</P>
<P>
The communique said all the 11 detainees have been turned over
to judicial authorities along with their written confessions and
explosives, detonators, timers and maps seized.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, security branches are following up the link between
the ring and another bomb explosion which took place at the campus
of the American University in Beirut last year, the communique
added.

<HEADLINE> Cambodia Launches Voter Education Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Cambodia's National Election
committee (NEC) has launched a voter education campaign, aimed at
informing voters about procedures for casting a ballot on July 26,
and for assuring them that their votes will be secret.
</P>
<P>
About 50,000 copies of a first NEC leaflet giving general
information of the polls have been distributed nationwide with the
help of independent, non-government organizations.
</P>
<P>
A poster depicting all 39 political parties and their logos was
produced as part of the campaign to help voters, especially
illiterate voters, identify the party they will choose.
</P>
<P>
Illiterate voters will not be allowed to ask for help in
reading the ballot paper. Therefore it is very important that as
many people as possible are able to study this poster.
</P>
<P>
About 100,000 copies have been printed. They will be
distributed to all the provinces this week. Two more leaflets and
one other poster dealing with the secrecy of the vote, and
procedures for casting a ballot, will be distributed by the end of
next week.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, eight theater troupes financed by the
European Union began on Friday to stage performances explaining
the voting procedures and assuring voters that the ballots will be
cast in secret. The actors will tour 11 provinces over 21 days.
</P>
<P>
Television and radio programs explaining voting procedures and
other related information will be broadcast for the first time on
Tuesday July 7.

<HEADLINE> France Advance after Penalty Shoot-out </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SAINT-DENIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Hosts France advanced into the
semi-finals of France'98 after beating Italy 4-3 in the penalty
shoot-out here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
Italian midfielder Luigi di Biagio's attempt hit the cross-bar
and that was the end of the Italian team's campaign in the tournament.
</P>
<P>
The two teams each had one shot saved by the opponent
goal-keeper in the first three round of shoot-out. Laurent Blanc,
who put France through to the quarter-finals with a golden goal in
the match against Paraguay, made no mistake in netting his shot to
put France 4-3 ahead.
</P>
<P>
Biagio, who had put up a good performance in the match, released
a fierce shot with his right foot. The French goal-keeper could do
nothing but the ball hit the cross-bar and bounced out.
</P>
<P>
Before the shoot-out, the Italian team had very good chance to
get a golden goal but Roberto Baggio, who replaced Alessandro del
Piero in the second half, put his shot just wide.
</P>
<P>
The French team dominated the first half of the regulation time.
With the return of play-maker Zinedine Zidane, they enjoyed a great
advantage in the midfield.
</P>
<P>
The Italian team played solidly in defense while the French
forwards could not find the way to break up the Italian defense line.
</P>
<P>
The Italian goal-keeper Gianluca Pagliuca put up several brave
saves in the first 15 minutes of the match to disallow the shots
from Zidane and Emmanuel Petit.
</P>
<P>
However, when the match went into the second half, the French
team appeared tired and gradually lost the domination of midfield,
especially after Roberto Baggio went onto the pitch at the 67th minute.
</P>
<P>
Baggio gave the Italian team immediately advantage in the
midfield and threatened the French goal with acute crosses.
</P>
<P>
But the Italian forward Christian Vieri, who shared the top
place with Argentine Bastituta in the scorers' list with 5 goals,
failed to show his flair and missed a handful of chances.
</P>
<P>
After the 90-minute regulation time, both teams were exhausted
and could not organise their attacks.
</P>
<P>
It was the second penalty shoot-out in the France'98 World Cup
finals. Earlier in a second round match, Argentina eliminated
England, also with penalty shoot-out.

<HEADLINE> Yeltsin Emphasizes Nuclear Deterrent Role in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Russian President Boris Yeltsin on
Friday highlighted role of the nuclear deterrent in ensuring the
country's security and called for development of the strategic
nuclear forces.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a regular meeting of the Russian Security Council,
Yeltsin said the nuclear deterrent was a key element ensuring
Russian national security, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
"The nuclear forces are among the most important factors
contributing to our country's security," the president stated.
</P>
<P>
He, meanwhile, refuted the idea that Russia has become weaker
in the nuclear domain.
</P>
<P>
President's spokesman Sergei Yastrzhembsky quoted Yeltsin as
saying that Russia attached prime importance to the START-2
treaty, and in case of its ratification it would be a serious
measure aimed at global strategic stability.
</P>
<P>
The outline of a START-3 treaty was ready, the spokesman added.
</P>
<P>
According to Yastrzhembsky, Yeltsin is set to attach particular
importance to the development of the Russian strategic nuclear
force.
</P>
<P>
The nation's strategic forces were fully controllable, but the
issue of the "natural aging " of sea, land, and air components of
nuclear weapons is already rising, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that special attention should be paid to the problems
of the nuclear defense sector and the missile industry.

<HEADLINE> UK National Exporters Database Goes On-Line </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The UK's first ever
Government-supported National Exporters Database was launched
Friday on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
The database has an initial 52,000 entries although it is
expected this number will increase as the service becomes more
widely marketed.
</P>
<P>
The database will be operated by the Dialog Corporation plc on
behalf of the Government and comprises phase one of an expanded
TradeUK project, the Department of Trade and Industry said.
</P>
<P>
From September TradeUK will also include a revised Export Sales
Leads Service which will deliver leads from Foreign Office
commercial staff abroad to UK exporters via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
Welcoming the new service on its launching, Lord Clinton-Davis,
the Minister of Trade, said: "It is a prime example of our
determination and commitment to see UK firms take advantage of the
significant advances in information technology, especially the
Internet."
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the database will enable any UK exporter to
have a detailed entry on a database which potentially can be seen
by any buyer in the world.

<P>
LONDON, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Greenpeace Friday stepped up its
global campaign to stop new oil exploration with a disruption of
oil giants' Statoil, Mobil and Enterprise' oil search in the North
Atlantic, North of Scotland.
</P>
<P>
The environmental group said the action began at 20.25 hours
(local time) Thursday evening when three Greenpeace activists
placed themselves in the water in front of seismic testing vessel
Geco Diamond, operating 100 miles from the Scottish coast.
</P>
<P>
Friday's action follows Greenpeace's protest at the northern
edge of the Atlantic Frontier last month when a Greenpeace vessel
confronted Shell and Statoil's exploration rig, the Ocean
Alliance, off the coast of Norway.
</P>
<P>
Greenpeace has also recently launched its second expedition to
the Arctic which will document climate change impacts and protest
the development of this new frontier by UK oil company BP and

<HEADLINE> Rwandan Govt Committed to Pay $100M to Workers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Rwandan government has
expressed its commitment to clearing a debt amounting to 30
the workers, the Rwanda News Agency (RNA) said Friday.
</P>
<P>
Rwandan Minister of Labor and Public Service Nsengimana Joseph
made the pledge Thursday at the close of a two-day national
conference on "Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) and its social
dimension" organized by local Trade Unions in Kigali.
</P>
<P>
The minister assured the workers in the country on the
government initiative of paying what it owes to their National
Social Security Fund.
</P>
<P>
Joseph said that the government will pay "this debt in
installments of eight million Rwanda Francs each year from 1998."
</P>
<P>
The debt is just a part of the heap of internal debts ranging
from 85 to 100 billion Rwanda Francs accumulated by the preceding
government from private and public creditors, said RNA.
</P>
<P>
At the conference organized by the Confederation of Rwandan
Trade Unions CESTRAR with the support of the International
Confederation of Free Trade Unions African Regional Organization
(ICFTU-AFRO), the representatives of unions fiercely attacked
government for endorsing the three-year structural economic
reform program without consulting workers organizations who are
the victims of the reform measures.
</P>
<P>
In April this year, the Rwandan government put out a
three-year Economic Reform Program, ESAF (Enhanced Structural
Adjustment Facility), for 1998-2001.
</P>
<P>
The program, sponsored by the International Monetary Fund and
the World Bank, involves privatization of public enterprises,
public service reform, fiscal reform and the creation of
competitive economy.
</P>
<P>
"The workers are the victims of retrenchment, privatization,
budget cut on social expenditure. Then why shouldn't we be
consulted?" questioned Murangira (RNA did not give his full name)
the Secretary-General of the CESTRAR at the conference.
</P>
<P>
"We are not against SAP but the social partners must be
consulted,"insisted Andrew Kaleimbo, the General-Secretary of
ICFTU-AFRO, who attended the meeting.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ethio-Djibouti Railway
Company announced Friday that it has ferried 39,000 tons of goods
from Port Djibouti into the hinterland in just a month.
</P>
<P>
The company is giving a round-the-clock service since Ethiopia
began to use the Djibouti port as its sole outlet, the manager of
its Dire Dawa Branch, Girma Birru, told local press.
</P>
<P>
The manager said that 10,000 tons of fertilizers, 19,000 tons
of merchandise and 6,000 tons of grains and raw materials have
been transported into the hinterland.
</P>
<P>
According to the manager, the company used to transport over
three hundred tons of goods daily and the company transported
fuel and fuel products only to eastern Ethiopia in the earlier
days.
</P>
<P>
Every day, 300 tons of fuel is being transported to Ethiopia,
said Birru.
</P>

After the outbreak of Ethio-Eritrean border dispute on May 6
this year, Ethiopia has diverted from Assab Port of Eritrea to
Port Djibouti as its outlet.
</P>
<P>
Seventy percent of Ethiopia's exports and imports used to
transit through Assab, which was one of Ethiopia's two seaports
before the independence of Eritrea in May, 1993.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, about 300 freight trucks are moving a total of
6,000 tons a day by road through Djibouti, according to an
earlier announcement by the Ethiopian government.

<P>
ANKARA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Turkish President Suleyman Demirel
said here Friday Turkey always supports the right of the
Palestinian people, Turkey's Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In his meeting with visiting Palestinian Minister for Jerusalem
Affairs Faisal Husseini, Demirel said that it is useful for Turkey
and Palestine to exchange views and for Turkey to learn the
developments in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
Husseini, who arrived here Thursday on a three-day visit, said
that he is here to discuss some important issues concerning
Jerusalem with Turkish officials.
</P>
<P>
"Jerusalem is in danger," he said, indicating recent Israeli
bid to expand the municipal borders of the city.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian minister said that Israel's attempt to that
effect might endanger not only the Middle East peace process but
the future of the mixed demographic status of the holy city.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Palestinian researchers could be
allowed to use the archives pertaining to Jerusalem during the
Ottoman Empire period.
</P>
<P>
Husseini also held talks with Turkish State Minister Sukru Sina
Gurel and Foreign Minister Ismail Cem who is scheduled to visit
Palestine next week.
</P>

<HEADLINE> People's Daily Hails Clinton's China Visit (Part One) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The People's Daily, in a commentary
to be published on Saturday, hails the achievements of the just
concluded China visit by U.S. President Bill Clinton.
</P>
<P>
At the invitation of Chinese President Jiang Zemin, Clinton
visited China from June 25 to July 3, another important event in
the Sino-U.S. relations following President Jiang's state visit to
the United States last year, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
During his nine-day stay in China, Clinton toured Xi'an,
Beijing, Shanghai, Guilin and the Special Administrative Region of
Hong Kong, and held a summit meeting with President Jiang.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders exchanged views thoroughly on bilateral
relations as well as major international and regional issues and
shared extensive and important common views.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing summit is conducive to widening their mutual
understanding, promoting friendship, expanding common ground and
developing cooperation. Thus it is a firm step forward to building
a constructive strategic partnership between the two countries
oriented toward the 21st century, the paper noted.
</P>
<P>
The summit is positive, constructive and fruitful, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders conducted fruitful consultation on major
international issues. Their agreement on de-targeting each other
with their strategic nuclear weapons demonstrates to the world
that China and the United States are cooperative partners, not
rivals.
</P>
<P>
They also achieved positive outcomes on the issues of keeping
stability in the Asian region, curbing nuclear arms race in South
Asia, maintaining peace and stability in the Korea peninsula,
preventing nuclear proliferation and fighting against
international crime, drug trafficking and terrorism.
</P>
<P>
The two nations issued three joint statements on South Asia,
the inspection protocol to the Biological Weapons Convention and
the issue of anti-personnel mines respectively.
</P>
<P>
In discussing the Asian financial crisis, the United States
spoke highly of the vital role China played in helping easing it,
the paper said.
</P>
<P>
The two sides agreed to further strengthen their strategic
dialogue in economy and finance to make contributions to the
development of world economy and international finance, the paper
said.
</P>
<P>
The summit injected new vigor into the Sino-U.S. economic and
trade cooperation. American businessmen with President Clinton on
the visit showed great interest in strengthening economic and
trade relations with China.
</P>
<P>
Before and after the visit, companies and institutions from
both sides signed 12 key cooperation contracts worth about three
billion U.S. dollars in U.S. favor.
</P>
<P>
Besides, the two governments signed an agreement on peaceful
use of nuclear technology, and decided to strengthen their
exchange and cooperation in environmental protection, science,
education and legal matters.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue was an important topic during the
summit. President Jiang stressed that this issue is the most
important and sensitive core issue in Sino-U.S. relations.
</P>
<P>
Clinton publicly reiterated that the United States upholds the
one-China policy and abides by the principles contained in the
three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, and does not support Taiwan's
independence, nor "one China, one Taiwan", nor "two Chinas," nor
Taiwan's bid to join any international organizations made of only
sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
To deepen mutual understanding is a precondition for the
development of the Sino-U.S. relationship. Only when they
understand each other can the two countries increase their mutual
trust and cooperation, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
During the tour, Clinton not only reviewed China's glorious
history and culture of 5,000 years but also saw a vigorous modern
China.
</P>
<P>
By meeting Chinese people, President Clinton saw for himself
the great achievements China has made since it opened up to the
outside world and the high spirit the Chinese people have
displayed in building a stronger and more prosperous China, and
felt the friendly feelings they have for the American people.
</P>
<P>
Seeing is believing. President Clinton expressed belief that
his China tour deepened his understanding of China's history and
reality and helped the American people gain a complete picture of
China.

<P>
He said that a more prosperous, open and stronger new China is
emerging in the world.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese and American leaders shook hands once again across
the Pacific and won worldwide appreciation. World media all hailed
the outcome of the summit.
</P>
<P>
The New York Times noted that U.S. and Chinese leaders share
broad agreement in building a partnership while the Washington
Post holds that the Sino-U.S. relations will turn a new page to
the welcome of most Americans.
</P>
<P>
The Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun commented that exchange of
visits by Chinese and American leaders demonstrate that the two
countries have gone from an era of confrontation to that of
cooperation, which is beneficial to Asia's stability and world
peace at large.
</P>
<P>
Thai statesmen said that Clinton's visit to China has sent a
positive message to the world: the role China can play in regional
and global affairs should not be underestimated.
</P>
<P>
Reports said most Americans support Clinton's China trip and
praise the Sino-U.S. summit, proving that opposition to Clinton's
visit is short-sighted and unpopular.
</P>
<P>
In short, to improve and develop Sino-U.S. relations conforms
to the trend of the times and cannot be hampered by any force.
</P>
<P>
While reaching broad agreement on international and bilateral
issues, China and the United States did not sidestep their
differences over human rights. It is not strange that the two
sides have differences over some issues, the important point is
that these differences should not stand in the way of the
development of bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
World opinion believes that the frank exchange of views between
Jiang and Clinton shows that the Sino-U.S. relations are growing
mature.
</P>
<P>
China has always maintained that differences between countries
should be reduced through equal consultation and dialogue in the
spirit of mutual respect and seeking common ground while reserving
differences.
</P>
<P>
Any practice of interfering in the internal affairs of other
countries and imposing one's view on others does not help solve
any problem.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-U.S. relations will undoubtedly further develop as
long as the two countries continue to examine and handle them from
a strategic height and a long-term view.
</P>
<P>
The improvement of Sino-U.S. relations is a historical
necessity, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang has pointed out that under the new historical
conditions, China and the United States share extensive common
interest and shoulder unshirkable common responsibilities when
dealing with the major issues concerning peace and development of
the Asia-Pacific region and the whole world.
</P>
<P>
President Clinton holds that the trend of the development of
Sino-U.S. relations will decide to a large extent whether the new
century is a safe, peaceful and prosperous century for the
American people.
</P>
<P>
The achievements of the Beijing summit shows that the
development of friendship and cooperation between the two
countries, as U.N. Security Council permanent members with global
significance, conforms to the fundamental interest of the Chinese
and American peoples and contributes to world peace and
development as well, the paper concluded.

KAMPALA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Ugandan government has allowed
the media department to use its revenue to run its operations,
the first time ever in the country's history, a senior official
said here Friday.
</P>
<P>
Minister of State for Information in the President's office
Basoga Nsadhu told Radio Uganda that the revenue collection in

media organizations in the country was purged and a media
department in the President's office has taken over the
ministry's functions.

<HEADLINE> S. African Banks Raise Interest Rates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, July 3 (Xinhua) -- South Africa's three major
banks Friday hiked their prime lending rates and mortgage rates
again after the Rand fell to a new low against the U.S. Dollar
and the British Pound.
</P>
<P>
The increases are the highest real interest hike in the
history of the country, SABC, the South African national
television reported.
</P>
<P>
Standard Bank announced that it will raise its primary lending
rate by one percentage point to 23.25 percent and its mortgage
rate from 20 to 22 percent.
</P>
<P>
Nedcor followed suit by raising its benchmark rate to 24
percent and its home loan rate to 21.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
ABSA also increased its prime rate to 23.75 percent and its
mortgage rate to 21.50 percent.
</P>
<P>
An economist predicts that the interest rates could be lower
in about one or two months' time, but they will not be back at 18
percent, the level before the crisis began in late May.
</P>
<P>
The Rand Friday slipped to 6.43 against the U.S. Dollar and
10.63 against the British Pound.
</P>
<P>
Since the crisis began, the banks had raised their rates three
times from 18.25 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Reserve Bank's tightening of monetary policy to defend the
Rand has not stopped the speculative attack, which inflicted
losses of more than 23 percent of its value against the U.S.
Dollar.

<HEADLINE> Iran Claims Former IRGC Commander's Son Kidnapped </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Iran Friday rejected the claim that
Ahmad Rezaee, son of former commander of the Islamic Revolutionary
Guards Corps (IRGC) Mohsen Rezaee sought asylum in the United
States, but saying that he was kidnapped by Americans.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the Iranian official news agency IRNA,
Ahmad's brother Ali Rezaee said that Ahmad was kidnapped by the
U.S. National Aeronautical and Space Administration (NASA)
"through a perfect plot initiated by an agent Majid Tawana one
year ago."
</P>
<P>
The interview was carried out after the Voice of America (VOA)
Persian program broadcast an interview with Ahmad in Los Angeles
Thursday night who said he has sought asylum in the U.S..
</P>
<P>
Ali said that his 21-year-old brother phoned home in tears on
Friday and told them that "he had been threatened to give an
interview with VOA on Iranian supreme leader" Ayatollah Ali
Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
He said Tawana had persuaded his father Mohsen Rezaee to go
with him to the U.S., but the plot was neutralized by his father,
who is current secretary of the country's State Expediency
Council, a powerful advisory body to Khamenei.
</P>
<P>
In relation to this plot, the U.S. government and State
Department had issued an official visa for Mohsen Rezaee to
inspect an incomplete military installation in the U.S., Ali said.
</P>
<P>
He said that Ahmad, a sophomore studying pure mathematics at
Tehran's Teacher Training University, paid a visit to United Arab
Emirates last year where he was offered a job, but he soon
realized that it was a trap set by the Iranian outlawed Mujahedin
Khalq Organization (MKO).
</P>
<P>
Once he became aware of the MKO plot, he decided to return
home, Ali said, however before he could materialize his plan, he
was kidnapped en route.
</P>
<P>
In order to make the whole kidnapping scene look natural,
Ahmad was taken to several European countries and in last March he
was transferred to the U.S., he added.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Army Planning to Incorporate Geneva </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda People's Defense Forces
(UPDF) has plans to incorporate the law of armed conflict as
spelt out in the internationally-recognized Geneva convention,
according to military officials.
</P>
<P>
Director of Military Intelligence Colonel Henry Tumukunde made
the statement when closing a one-day seminar on the law of war
here Friday afternoon, Radio Uganda reported.
</P>
<P>
This law of armed conflict is a set of rules enshrined in the
general convention that prohibits soldiers at the battle field
from killing indiscriminately and orders them to render humane
treatment to civilians and enemies who are not armed.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the opening of the seminar, the UPDF Chief
Political Commissar Lt. Colonel Robert Rusoke attributed the
army's many victories to its respect for the law of armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
It has become very crucial for the UPDF to master and observe
the law of war since the force has been earmarked for
international peacekeeping missions.

<HEADLINE> Trial of Suspects in Rwanda Genocide Adjourned </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The International Criminal
Tribunal for Rwanda (ICTR) has announced that the joint trial of
two suspects has been adjourned to next month when more defense
witnesses are expected to continue giving evidence.
</P>
<P>
Trial of the suspects, Clement Kayishema, a former Prefect of
Rwanda's Kibuye, and a former businessman Obed Ruzindana, will
resume on August 17, according to a press release Friday by ICTR
based in north Tanzania's Arusha town.
</P>
<P>
The trial has been adjourned at the request of the defendant,
who told the court that the accused have "15 more very important
witnesses who are presently said to be scattered in various
refugee camps and other locations out of Rwanda."
</P>
<P>
In this regard, the statement said, the Witnesses and Victims
Protection Unit Thursday requested the Chamber 2 to give it
adequate time to bring them before the tribunal.
</P>
<P>
The last defense witness was Dr. Regis Pouget, a psychiatrist
who finished testifying on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Fifty-two prosecution witnesses and 17 defense witnesses have
already testified in the trial which began on April 7, 1997.
</P>
<P>
Kayishema and Ruzindana are jointly charged with genocide,
crimes against humanity, violations of Article 3 Common to the
Geneva Conventions and of Additional Protocol 2.
</P>
<P>
They have pleaded "not guilty" to six joint counts, while
Kayishema is separately charged with 18 other counts.
</P>
<P>
The court was established by the United Nations to try chief
suspects of Rwanda's 1994 genocide. Over 800,000 Tutsis and
moderate Hutus were killed by Hutu extremists in a three-month
slaughter that ended with the Tutsi-dominated Rwanda Patriotic
Front seizing power.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Retain Nuclear Forces Till 2010 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Russia will retain its strategic
nuclear triad of ground, sea and air forces until the year 2010,
Russia's Security Council announced Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Interfax news agency, the decision was taken
by the Security Council at a regular session chaired by President
Boris Yeltsin.
</P>
<P>
At the session, concrete decisions on the structure and
strength of Russia's nuclear forces were adopted.
</P>
<P>
It wad said that ground troops are to be equipped with one type
of Topol-M intercontinental ballistic missiles in stationary and
mobile modifications, instead of the six types of missiles used
today.
</P>
<P>
The first stationary complexes of this system were brought
online last year. The Topol-M system is expected to stay active at
least until the year 2020.
</P>
<P>
The participants of the session agreed to boost naval nuclear
potential. The main efforts are to be applied in the near future
toward maintaining the military preparedness of Delta-IV
nuclear-powered submarine cruisers that carry missiles and to a
number of other forces.
</P>
<P>
It was also decided to reduce nuclear potential in the air
force and upgrade Tu-95 and Tu-160 bombers with long-range
missiles. These aircraft, the first of which was designed back in
the 1950s, will remain in service at least until 2015 just like
B-52 and B-1 bombers.
</P>
<P>
The council's press service said that the president instructed
the council and cabinet to pay as much attention as possible to
the problems of scientific organizations and industrial
enterprises involved in space, missile and nuclear weapons
programs.
</P>
<P>
At the session, funds for corresponding programs were earmarked
and decisions on economic, scientific and industrial measures to
ensure nuclear deterrence were adopted, the report said.

<HEADLINE> Ugandan Deputy PM Praises China's Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Uganda Second Deputy Prime
Minister and Minister of Tourism, Trade and Industry Moses Ali
Friday praised the tremendous economic achievements China has
made over the last two decades.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister said this to Chinese Ambassador to
Uganda Song Zengshou Friday evening at a dinner party hosted by
the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
"Although China and Uganda are both developing countries,
China has made tremendous development and achievements in fields
of industry, trade, tourism, and agriculture," Ali said.
</P>
<P>
Chinese products have entered markets of many other countries,
he said, and this is because of the appropriate technology used
in production, low cost, high-quality materials and good export
promotion strategy.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister added that Uganda has a lot to learn
from China and this occasion provides a good chance for the
Ugandan business community to know about China and to exchange
information and ideas.
</P>
<P>
He said both countries should further strengthen their trade
and economic links. Uganda would like to trade directly with
China to increase the volume of bilateral trade.
</P>
<P>
China is good at small-scale industries, he acknowledged, and
his ministry is prepared to learn from China's experience in this
aspect.
</P>
<P>
Uganda's tourism industry is small but growing and Ali said
that he would appreciate it if Chinese businessmen could invest
in this sector in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The deputy prime minister, accompanied by other officials and
businessmen of his country, also thanked the Chinese government
for the assistance China has been giving and continues to give to
Uganda in many fields.

<HEADLINE> Greece Urges Israel to Implement Oslo Agreements </HEADLINE>

<P>
ATHENS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece Friday Urged Israel to
implement the peace agreements signed with Palestine in a bid to
break the deadlock of the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the conference of Palestinian and Israeli
journalists in the southern Greek island of Rhodes, Greek Foreign
Undersecretary Yiannos Kranidiotis said that Greece was not happy
with Israel's policy and was in favor of the implementation of the
Oslo and Madrid agreements signed between Israel and Palestine.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of the peace agreements must be speeded up,
he said, adding that on Greece's part, Athens was exercising its
influence in that direction and supported U.N. and U.S.
initiatives for a lifting of the deadlock.
</P>
<P>
He described as unacceptable Israel's threat to forbid the
entry of Palestinian workers into its territories if the European
Union (EU) boycotted products from the occupied lands. He said the
EU had adopted decisions seeking good cooperation with the
Palestinian authority and Israel and an improvement of the
Palestinians' economic situation was in the interest of Israel
itself.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Vows to Prevent Deployment of Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Deputy Prime Minister
Bulent Ecevit reaffirmed Saturday that Turkey is determined to
prevent Cyprus' plan to deploy Russian-made S-300 missiles on the
divided island.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit made the remark at a press conference held on the
occasion of the 1st anniversary of the 55th Turkish government.
</P>
<P>
"We are carefully monitoring the excessive armament policy
adopted by the Southern Cyprus Greek Administration with the
support of Greece. This excessive armament drive has found its
way into the purchase of Russian S-300 missiles," Ecevit said.
</P>
<P>
He said that the Turkish government was adopting the required
military countermeasures against the probability of their actual
commitment.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into Greek Cypriot-dominated south and
Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkish troops
landed and took over the northern third of the island in response
to a pro-Athens coup.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, Cyprus signed an accord with Russia to buy the
S-300 missiles, triggering tensions on the small island. Turkey
has vowed to use all means to block the deployment of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has rescheduled the deployment of the missiles from
mid-year to October or November. Russia has turned down the
pressure from some countries and said it will go ahead with the
deal.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit added that "I want to reiterate here that all actions to
be launched by the Southern Cyprus Greek Administration and Greece
under their so-called joint defense doctrine have been and will be
countered with due determination."
</P>
<P>
Turkey has been provided political, economic and military
support to Turkish Cypriots and is the sole country to recognize
the "Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus" unilaterally declared by
Turkish Cypriots in 1983.
</P>
<P>
At present, more than 35,000 Turkish government troops are
stationed in northern Cyprus with a claimed aim to protect Turkish
Cypriots.

<HEADLINE> Pakistan Foreign Accounts Restrictions Would Be Eased </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Pakistani Finance Minister Sartaj
Aziz hopes restrictions imposed on foreign currency accounts would
be eased within the next three to four months provided economic
conditions improve, exports increase and the foreign exchange
situation stabilizes.
</P>
<P>
In a meeting at the Karachi Chamber of Commerce and Industry on
Saturday, Aziz said the government has already relaxed the foreign
currency accounts and new deposits could now be withdrawn.
</P>
<P>
"We have maintained certain immunity on the foreign currency
accounts while facilities of duty exemptions are also available to
the same accounts," he was quoted by the Associated Press of
Pakistan as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said the government maintained accounts in foreign currency
to attract foreign investment. Only 1.2 billion U.S. dollars out
of 10 billion dollar deposits belonged to the non-resident
Pakistanis, whereas the rest of the deposits in foreign currency
were maintained by accounts from local residents.
</P>
<P>
He said the existence of foreign currency accounts had become a
source of investment, not savings, as people were fast converting
their rupee deposits into dollars besides putting their export
earnings into foreign currency accounts.
</P>
<P>
The decision to freeze foreign currency accounts after
Pakistan's nuclear tests at the end of May was taken in the wake
of uncontrolled withdrawals from these accounts during a period
between May 11 and 28, when 52 million dollars were withdrawn in a
single day, according to Aziz.
</P>
<P>
He said the government had no other way but to freeze the
foreign currency accounts.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said Pakistan is passing through a difficult
time and the next three to four months were crucial.
</P>
<P>
Aziz hinted that the situation would largely depend on whether
international institutions will release or withhold loans to
Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank
and the Asian Development Bank, being independent institutions and
having their separate charters, would not come into the influence
of a single country," he said, adding that if they impose
sanctions on Pakistan, it will damage the independent image of
these institutions.

<HEADLINE> Zambia's Currency Depreciation May Ignite </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Civil Servants Union of Zambia
(CSUZ) said Saturday that the continued depreciation of the
country's currency is eroding the real income of most employees
and could led to widespread strikes.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Zambia News Agency, CSUZ General
Secretary Japhet Moonde said the depreciation of the Kwacha is
pushing the prices of commodities beyond the reach of many
people.
</P>
<P>
The economic condition prevailing in the country are too harsh
for most of the workers to cope with unless their salaries are
increased, said the union leader.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a lot of workers are being demoralized because
of the low wages they are receiving and productivity is going
down as a result.
</P>
<P>
Moonde warned that if workers are pushed too hard against the
wall of poverty it could breed widespread strikes as workers
press for better salaries and other conditions of service to
survive.
</P>
<P>
He accused employers including the government for being
insensitive to the plight of workers, adding that there is need
to resolve the root causes of industrial strife instead of taking
a confrontational stand.
</P>
<P>
As far as the two-week go-slow by magistrates starting last
week for increased wages and better conditions of service, Moonde
said the government should move quickly to dialog with the
magistrates countrywide.
</P>
<P>
In the past 10 months, the Kwacha has depreciated by nearly 40
percent, falling from 1,330 to the Dollar last September to over
1,950 against one U.S. Dollar at present.
</P>
<P>
The Zambian government began to implement a wage freeze
program against civil servants last year, which has deteriorated
the living conditions of the country's civil servants and
industrial workers. The matter has already been taken to court.

<HEADLINE> Malaysia Records Big Trade Surplus for January-May </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia registered a hefty
trade surplus in the first five months of this year due to a
stronger growth in exports, the Statistics Department said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The surplus amounted to 16.2 billion ringgit (3.95 billion U.S.
dollars) against the mere 48.5 million ringgit (11.829 million
dollars) during the same period last year, the department said.
</P>
<P>
The cumulative exports and imports for the January-May period
amounted to 115 billion ringgit (28.05 billion dollars) and 98.8
billion ringgit (24.097 billion dollars) respectively.
</P>
<P>
Exports during January-May grew sharply by 40.5 percent or 33.2
billion ringgit (8.1 billion dollars) compared with the previous
corresponding period, while imports rose 20.8 percent or 17
billion ringgit (4.15 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The department said if imports and re-exports of "lumpy" items
(namely aircraft and ships/tankers, including accessories) were to
be excluded, the country would have been registering a larger
surplus of 19.2 billion ringgit (4.68 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of the year, electrical and electronic
products remained as the largest export earners, with total
earnings of 59.3 billion ringgit (14.46 billion dollars) or 51.6
percent of the country's total export revenue.
</P>
<P>
Palm oil, with a value of 6.5 billion ringgit (1.59 billion
dollars), constituted 5.7 percent of exports and remained the
second largest revenue earner.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, imports of intermediate goods rose 26.7 percent to
68.3 billion ringgit (16.66 billion dollars), while capital goods
grew 8.3 percent to 17.2 billion ringgit (4.2 billion dollars) and
consumer goods expanded 6.3 percent to 5.5 billion ringgit (1.34
billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The United States, Japan and Singapore continued to be
Malaysia's major trading partners, accounting for 51.7 percent of
Malaysia's total trade during the first five months of the year.

LONDON, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Czech tennis veteran Jana Novotna
snatched her first Wimbledon after beating her French opponent
Nathalie Tauziat in straight sets at the women's singles final
clash of the Wimbledon Tennis Championships.
</P>
<P>
The 29-year-old Novotna, the Wimbledon runner-up in 1992 and

first service to her opponent. Gradually consolidating her
position at the Center Court, Novotna launched aggressive attacks
and won the first set 6:4.
</P>
<P>
Reluctant to give up her golden chance to become a Wimbledon
Champion, 30-year-old Tauziat defended brilliantly and displayed
some top class tennis. However, an energetic Novotna held her
position firmly and finally won the crucial second set 7:5.

<HEADLINE> Russia to Cut Oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Russia will cut the export quotas of
four Russian oil companies by one third over the third quarter of
this year, the Interfax news agency reported on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Russia will export 28.2 million tonnes of oil in the third
quarter, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The four companies are Onako, Sidanko (the Varyeganneft
subsidiary), Tatneft and Bashneft.
</P>
<P>
Russia has agreed to cut its oil production and exports to join
the efforts of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting
Countries (OPEC) to boost oil prices on the world market.
</P>
<P>
Russian Fuel and Energy Minister Sergei Generalov said the
action may help increase demand for oil and petroleum products not
only on international markets but also on the Russian domestic
market.
</P>
<P>
The sluggish world oil market, which has lasted for months, has
brought huge economic losses for Russia, a big oil producer of
around six million barrels of oil a day.

<HEADLINE> Turkish Prime Minister Vows to Fight High Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Prime Minister Mesut Yilmaz
said on Saturday that his government will make greater efforts to
bring down the soaring inflation rate.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference on the occasion of the
anniversary of the 55th Turkish government, Yilmaz said that to
curb the high inflation rate is one of the most important tasks of
his government.
</P>
<P>
"Many of the problems and imbalances experienced in this
country are underlain by the high inflation rate which we have not
been able to overcome in the last 30 years," Yilmaz said.
</P>
<P>
"Fight against the inflation is a multidimensional task,
requiring first of all an absolute political determination and a
serious political sacrifice. It requires a realistic program
coupled with social support and comprehension," he added.
</P>
<P>
Turkey's inflation rate, which stood at 80 percent at the end
of June, and the severe devaluation of the currency Turkish Lira
have become a major bottleneck for its economic development.
</P>
<P>
Yilmaz said the Turkish government intends to cut the inflation
rate down to 50 percent at the end of this year and 20 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
"Our successfully-pursued program for abating the inflation is
being monitored with much appreciation by world's leading finance
and economy organizations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish prime minister stressed that his government would
firmly push ahead with privatization plan as part of the efforts
to revitalize the economy.
</P>
<P>
The present government came to power in July last year when
former Prime Minister Necmettin Erbakan was forced to resign due
to pro-Islamic tendency.

HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Students of Harare Polytechnic
College have filed an urgent application in the high court,
seeking an order for the Ministry of Higher Education to reopen
the college which was closed after disturbances last month at the
instiution.
</P>
<P>
Lawyer of the students, Tinomudaishe Chinyoka Saturday
confirmed that he had filed the application and expected the case
to be heard Monday, the Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
President of the Student Representative Council, Charlton
Hwende said they made the application on Friday citing the
ministry as the respondent.
</P>
<P>
Hwende said they had resorted to legal action because nothing
was being done to discuss the plight of the college whereas the
authorities at the University of Zimbabwe were trying to seek a
solution on the closure of the institution.
</P>
<P>
''The ministry has been silent about the Harare Polytechnic
College issue and that is why we have taken this course of
action,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
Harare Polytechnic College and the University of Zimbabwe were
closed indefinitely last month following violent demonstrations
by students who were demanding an increase in their payouts.

<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Three Zimbabweans were killed on
the spot and six others injured early Saturday morning when a
Mutare city bound commuter bus collided with a train heading for
Harare at a rail crossing in Mutare, east Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
One of the survivors, Lovemore Manzvi, said the train driver
hooted before approaching the rail crossing but the driver of the
commuter bus which carried eight passengers did not stop, the
Zimbabwe News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Manzvi said it was at that time when the train hit the right
front side of the commuter bus, sending it into the air before
landing on its side about five meters away from the rail
crossing.
</P>
<P>
The fatal accident occurs barely three months after Mutare's
Mayor Lawrence Mudewhe convened a meeting with police and
commuter bus operators in which he warned about reckless driving.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, a six-member committee comprising police,
city council and commuter bus operators was set up to find ways
of curbing the soaring road accidents involving commuter buses.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Calls Clinton's China Tour Great Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto on Saturday hailed United States President Bill
Clinton's just concluded state visit to China as a great success.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto made the remark during a meeting at his official
residence in Tokyo with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who arrived here Friday night from Hong Kong to brief
Japan on Clinton's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of their 25-minute meeting was spent discussing
Clinton's China visit, Japanese government officials said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told Albright that he had been following closely
Clinton's China tour and called the results a "great success,"
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Albright also hailed the agreements reached between Washington
and Beijing, such as the mutual de-targeting agreement of
strategic nuclear weapons and the pledge on security and
nonproliferation cooperation on the arms race in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
Albright later held talks with Japanese Foreign Minister Keizo
Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto and Obuchi "agreed that the improvement in the
U.S.-China relations is very much in Japan's interest as well. In
fact, it is a win-win-win outcome for the people in the United
States, Japan and China," Albright told a joint press conference
held with Obuchi.
</P>
<P>
"Relations between and among our three nations are not a
zero-sum game," she said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to Japan's financial system reform efforts, Albright
said: "I told Hashimoto that the United States was encouraged by
the plans that Japan announced on July 2 the reform of the banking
sector.
</P>
<P>
"As the president indicated yesterday, we now look forward to
Japan's taking swift, concerted action to implement these
measures," the state secretary said.
</P>
<P>
"I also emphasized the importance that the United States
attaches to Japanese economic recovery, which is critical not just
for this nation and its people, but for Asia and the world,"
Albright added.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Courts Urged to Provide Guarantee for Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Minister of Justice Xiao Yang
has urged courts at all levels to provide a judicial guarantee for
the realization of the country's economic growth target this year.
</P>
<P>
"Courts at all levels must do a good job in the administration
of justice and ... resolutely safeguard social stability to
provide a judicial guarantee for the realization of this year's
economic growth target," Xiao said recently.
</P>
<P>
China has set this year's growth rate for its gross domestic
product at 8 percent.
</P>
<P>
"Performing a good job in the administration of justice and
safeguarding stability are the overwhelmingly important tasks of
the people's courts at the current stage," he said.
</P>
<P>
Right now, earnest efforts must be made to implement the
revised Criminal Law and the Criminal Procedural Law and deal a
harsh blow to serious crimes that threaten social stability, Xiao
said.
</P>
<P>
"We should use the justice administration function to readjust
the relation between civil and economic affairs and eliminate
all sorts of social contradictions," he said.
</P>
<P>
Using judicial means to guarantee the smooth implementation of
major reform measures and the realization of the national economic
growth target is a concrete reflection of justice administration
serving the whole situation of the Party and the state, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the second half of this year, special efforts must be made
to ensure a good job by the justice administration of cases
pertaining to financial disputes, state-owned enterprise reforms,
farmland contracting, agricultural development, real estate, labor
disputes and social guarantees, Xiao said.

<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The South Korean government and
business conglomerates Saturday agreed to increase the country's
exports to overcome the current financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
The nine-point agreement was published after South Korean
President Kim Dae-jung met tycoons of the groupings on Saturday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, the government will complete the
restructuring of the ailing financial sector as soon as possible
to stabilize the nation's financial system, while the business
groups will work hard to restructure their operations and
management to survive the market system.
</P>
<P>
The conglomerates will be allowed to conduct the exchange of
businesses among themselves, and the government will offer
administrative support for the exchanges, said the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the government will provide 500 billion won (about
400 million U.S. dollars) in the second half of this year as a
credit guarantee fund for small-and medium-sized companies
specializing in export industries.
</P>
<P>
South Korea has been fighting against a financial crisis caused
by corporate failures and bad loans by financial institutions
since late last year.
</P>
<P>
Under an agreement reached with the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) for a rescue loan of 57 billion U.S. dollars last December,
South Korea has to restructure its economy and open its markets
this year.

<P>
ALMA-ATA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Visiting Chinese President Jiang
Zemin said here Saturday that his visit to Kazakstan is
"fruitful," expressing confidence in the bright future of the
development of Sino-Kazak relations.
</P>
<P>
The complementary agreement on border issues between the two
countries marked a complete resolution of their remaining border
issues, added Jiang at a press conference after its signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, the second of its kind, will greatly contribute
to the regional stability, said the Chinese president.
</P>
<P>
China and Kazakstan signed a border agreement in April, 1994
and their first complementary border agreement during Jiang's
official visit to Kazakstan in July, 1996.
</P>
<P>
Speaking of the recent nuclear tests by India and Pakistan,
Jiang said China always stands for comprehensive ban and complete
destruction of nuclear weapons and opposes their proliferation in
any form.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that the current tension in South Asia was
triggered by India single-handedly, saying any attempt to seek
hegemony or the big power status will fail under the present
international situation.
</P>
<P>
"China, as a close neighbor of South Asia, wishes peace and
stability for the region. We appeal to India and Pakistan to sign
the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons and the
Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty unconditionally," said Jiang.
</P>
<P>
Also at the press conference, Kazak President Nursultan A.
Nazarbayev described the signing of the agreement as a significant
historical event.
</P>
<P>
Kazakstan regards China as a strategic partner oriented toward
the 21st century and its relations with China will further
develop, said Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
Jiang arrived here Friday to attend the five-nation meeting of
China, Kazakstan, Kyrgyzstan, Russia and Tajikistan, and pay a

<HEADLINE> Iraq Promises to Secure Oil Supply to Jordan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Iraq said Saturday that it will
continue the Iraqi-Jordanian agreement on oil cooperation to
secure the oil supply to Jordan for the second half of this year.
</P>
<P>
This came after Iraqi Oil Minister Amir Mohammed Rashid held a
meeting with visiting Jordanian Minister of Energy and Mineral
Resources Mohammed Saleh Hourani.
</P>
<P>
In a joint news conference after their meeting, Rashid said
President Saddam Hussein has ordered to guarantee supply of crude
and oil products to Jordan at preferential prices, despite Iraq's
difficulties in oil production for lack of spare parts.
</P>
<P>
Rashid said the U.N. Sanctions Committee has so far approved
none of the 40 contracts Iraq has had with foreign companies to
import spare parts for its dilapidated oil industry.
</P>
<P>
Iraq and Jordan signed the agreement on oil cooperation in
December last year, under which Jordan can get 4.8 million tonnes
of Iraqi crude and oil products per year at preferential prices.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference, Jordanian energy minister Hourani, who
arrived here Thursday leading an oil delegation, spoke highly of
the bilateral cooperation in oil sector, which he said is "running
smoothly" in the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
Hourani said he will also discuss with Iraqi officials the
laying a 750-Kilometer pipeline, with a daily transport capacity
of 150,000 barrels, to carry Iraqi oil to Jordan's Zarqa refinery,
some 30 kilometers north of capital Amman.

<HEADLINE> NPC Official Urges Strict Implementation of Taxation Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUNMING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Tian Jiyun, Vice-Chairman of the
Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), today
urged the taxation law-enforcement inspection teams nationwide to
seriously and effectively carry out their work.
</P>
<P>
Tian, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Central
Committee of the Communist Party of China, made the call during a
visit to southwestern China's Yunnan Province.
</P>
<P>
Taxes are a major source for the country's revenue, he said, so
the enforcement of the Law on Administration of Taxation is very
important for China's economic growth and social development.
</P>
<P>
Tian stressed that law enforcement must be taken seriously and
in a down-to-earth manner.
</P>
<P>
From June 30 to July 4, Tian visited the construction sites of
the 1999 World Garden Fair, the Kunming International Trade Center
and the Dianchi Lake water pollution control project. He also
heard reports on the enforcement of the taxation law in Yunnan
Province.
</P>
<P>
He said paying taxes is the duty of each enterprise and
individual. The major infrastructure projects, social welfare
programs, national defense, aid to the poor, disaster-relief work
and many other projects depend on revenue.
</P>
<P>
A NPC inspection team will complete a taxation law-enforcement
inspection in several prefectures in Yunnan soon.

<HEADLINE> Profile: Nigeria's New Chief of General Staff </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Rear Admiral Okhai Mike Akhigbe has
become Nigeria's No. 2 person as he was named the new chief of
general staff Friday night.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe, chief of naval staff until his appointment, succeeded
Oladipo Diya, who vacated the office on December 20, 1997 following
his involvement in a coup plot and was sentenced to death by
a special military tribunal two months ago.
</P>
<P>
With the new position, Akhigbe will coordinate the affairs of
all the states of the federation in line with the policies of the
federal government.
</P>
<P>
His appointment is seen as capable of reducing the burden on
the office of the Head of State, General Abdulsalam Abubakar, who
took over the schedule following Diya's removal.
</P>
<P>
General Abubakar, the former chief of defense staff, became
the head of state on June 9, the second day after the sudden
death of his predecessor, late General Sani Abacha.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe was born on September 29, 1946 at Fugar, Etsako in
southern Edo State.
</P>
<P>
After his secondary school education in Afenmai Anglican
Grammar School, Igarra, from 1961 to 1965, Akhigbe proceeded to
the Nigerian Defense Academy in northern Kaduna State, where he
spent three years from 1967 to 1969.
</P>
<P>
The former naval chief attended several courses in India,
Italy, the Netherlands, Germany, France and Britain in the 1970s.
</P>
<P>
He began his naval career in April 1970, when he was
commissioned and appointed first lieutenant of the Nigerian navy.
He became a lieutenant three years later.
</P>
<P>
Prior to his appointment as the military governor of Ondo
State in August 1986, he was a captain. In 1987, he was
transferred to Lagos, the then national capital, also as military
governor.
</P>
<P>
The officer got to the peak in his naval career in 1994 when
he was named chief of naval staff.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe has four children -- two sons and two daughters.
</P>
<P>
In recent times, he has emerged a critical voice against
military incursion into politics and canvassed quick restoration
of civil rule.
</P>
<P>
"It is unfortunate that the military has stayed long in power
and people are taking advantage of it to personalize every
issue," he said in May when he blamed his own constituency for
its own woes.
</P>
<P>
"I hope we sort out our political problems, get democratized
and face our professional jobs."

PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- FIFA on Saturday praised France's
Emmanuel Petit for his sportsmanship in a World Cup quarterfinal
against Italy.
</P>
<P>
FIFA spokesman Keith Cooper said his organization would consider
Petit as a candidate for the annual Fair Play award this year.
</P>

He added, "No doubt this will make him one of the candidates by the

</P>
<P>
Cooper said, Petit had been in a very promising position,
possessing the ball at one time during the heatly-contested game at
the Stade de France on Friday.
</P>
<P>
But Petit deliberately put the ball out of play because he saw an
Italian player was injured and in need of medical attention, said
Cooper.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Senate to Debate Agreement With U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Philippine Press Secretary Rodolfo
Reyes said here Saturday that President Joseph Estrada will allow
the Senate to conduct its own discussion on the proposed
Philippines-U.S. Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA).
</P>
<P>
"The president is leaving this to the Senate for extensive
discussion," Reyes said in response to published reports that
Washington had started wooing the senators for immediate
ratification of the agreement.
</P>
<P>
Estrada will listen to the debates in the Senate, Reyes said,
adding that Foreign Secretary Domingo Siazon is now preparing some
pointers on the issue.
</P>
<P>
Reyes said former senate president Edgardo Angara will be asked
to find out if the VFA is included in the legislative agenda of
the Estrada administration.
</P>
<P>
Angara was the vice presidential running-mate of President
Estrada during the May 11 elections.
</P>
<P>
According to reports, Senator Juan Flavier had been personally
approached by U.S. Ambassador Thomas Hubbard, who explained the
benefits of a VFA to the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
The agreement was signed by the Ramos administration in
January, but needs Senate ratification. Under the agreement,
visiting U.S. soldiers would enjoy immunity if they commit any
crimes on the Philippine territory.

<P>
NANTES, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Brazilian defender Cafu will miss the
semi-final match against either Argentina or the Netherlands due to
bookings.
</P>
<P>
Cafu got a yellow card in the quarter-final match against
Denmark. Earlier in the round of 16 match against Chile, he had
already received one.
</P>
<P>
According to the FIFA rules, Cafu will be banned for one match
and that means he will not be available in Brazil's semi-final
match.
</P>
<P>
Cafu felt it was unfair that the Scottish referee gave him the
card:"I didn't deserve a yellow card. I've never got one in such
circumstances before." he said.
</P>
<P>
Yet he was satisfied with the victory over Denmark:"We deserved
it. We made more chances and it would have been quite wrong if we
had not made it through to the semi-finals."

formally attached to the Kai Tak Airport District, bringing with

<HEADLINE> Int'l Great Apes Conference Opens in Malaysia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Third International
Conference on Great Apes of the World opened in Sarawak, East
Malaysia, Saturday to deliberate on how to conserve great apes
faced with extinction threats worldwide.
</P>
<P>
Over 60 researchers, conservationists and ape experts will
present findings from their wildlife research, conservation and
captive management for orangutans (a kind of ape) and other great
apes faced with extinction threats worldwide at the three-day
conference, according to reports reaching here Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The conference themed "Securing Great Ape Survival into the
Next Millennium" is expected to come up with an action plan to
address the great apes' conservation, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
"Great apes and their habitat have been threatened and
exploited by humans during this century, yet their very survival
as free-living species is now in question as we enter the new
millennium," said Sarawak Development Institute (SDI), the
conference coordinator, in a statement earlier.
</P>
<P>
Sarawak, the largest state in Malaysia, was chosen to host the
conference because it is part of Borneo Island which is
world-famous for orangutans and many of them still inhabit
Sarawak's forests.
</P>
<P>
Currently there are an estimated 40,000 orangutans still
inhabiting Borneo and Sumatra. But 10 years ago, these two islands
had about 180,000 orangutans, according to Los Angeles-based
Orangutan Foundation International President Birute Galdikas at
the conference.
</P>
<P>
She said that on global conservation of the great apes, it was
important to save the forests in terms of biodiversity
conservation for which orangutans could be used as a monitor.
</P>
<P>
Opening the conference, Sarawak State Tourism Minister James
Masing said the recent prolonged drought in Borneo, the forest
fires and encroachment by man had destroyed much of the primates'
habitat and natural surrounding.
</P>
<P>
He said the Second Tourism Master Plan of the Sarawak State
recommended the proper management of national parks, wildlife
sanctuaries and nature reserves up to the year 2010 to protect its
wildlife, especially orangutans.

ALMA ATA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan President Nursultan
Nazarbayev gave a banquet here Saturday in honor of visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said in his toast that since the establishment of
diplomatic relations, Kazakhstan and China have brought their
economic, scientific and cultural cooperation to a new level.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the most important achievement of all is the
agreement the two countries have reached on the most complex issue
of border demarcation.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of a complementary agreement on the remaining two
sections of the border is a manifestation of the mutual understanding
and good will of our two countries," Nazarbayev said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the signing of the agreement will lay a solid
foundation for the two countries to pursue bolder programs, seek
common prosperity and deepen friendship.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang said in reply that the two countries have been
on very good terms by fostering good-neighborliness and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the complete settlement of border issues is a
result of the efforts of both countries to deepen their mutual
trust and understanding.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that as long as the two countries based their
relations on equal consultation and mutual accommodation, any
complex problem can be solved.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Announce New Export Policy Soon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi government will soon
announce the export policy 1997-2002, which stresses expansion of
the export base to reduce extreme dependence on limited items, The
Financial Express daily reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
"If products are not diversified and new items are not included
in the list of exportables, the country's export would face severe
setback in the near future," says the new export policy already
approved by the Cabinet.
</P>
<P>
At present, the country's exports are dominated by items such
as ready-made garments, knitwear, leather and leather products,
frozen food and tea.
</P>
<P>
Only by developing exportables' production infrastructure, can
the country's export sector maintain its growth in line with the
projected seven percent GDP (gross domestic product) growth rate
during the fifth five-year plan period (1997-2002), the policy
points out.
</P>
<P>
The policy's major objectives include achieving the highest
growth rate through increasing exports to the regional and
international markets and reducing the gap between export earnings
and import payments.
</P>
<P>
It stresses concerted measures to enter the post-Uruguay Round
globalized market by increasing productivity of export items and
reducing their production costs and improving the quality.
</P>
<P>
The new export strategy aims at creating a trained manpower in
the sector and bringing high-tech facilities in the production
units.
</P>
<P>
It also emphasizes exploitation of the benefits given for the
least developed countries by the World Trade Organization and
measures to have raw materials for export industries at world
price.
</P>
<P>
The sectors to get special importance in the policy include
computer software, leather and leather goods, ready-made garments
and other prospective non-traditional items.
</P>
<P>
Devaluation of the country's currency, taka, already done by
the government several times, is also seen as a vital tool in the
policy to keep the country's products competitive in the
international market.
</P>
<P>
Other important steps to be taken for implementing the policy
include establishment of an export-import bank, setting up
information centers in various countries with network facilities
and establishing a trade and investment training institute and
reorganizing the Export Promotion Bureau, according to the policy.

PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news items in
leading French newspapers on Saturday:

<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- The recognition by the U.S. television network CNN and the
Time magazine that they were wrong in accusing the U.S. army of
using poison gas in 1970 in Laos made up a big blow to the
credibility of the U.S. media. It also broke the myth around
American journalism built since the 1974 ``Watergate'' which led to
the resignation of President Richard Nixon.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- From the tombs of the first Chinese emperor in Xi'an to the
cybernetics cafe of Shanghai, U.S. President Bill Clinton succeeded
in changing the image of China in the eyes of many Americans during
his nine-day visit to the country.
</P>
<P>
Les Echos:
</P>
<P>
-- With 18.7 billion U.S. dollars of orders struck by the end of
June, the Airbus Industrie consortium now claims 52 percent of the
global plane market, ahead of the U.S. Boeing group.

<HEADLINE> Cesare Maldini Faces Possible Sack after Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Italian coach Cesare Maldini will
possibly be sacked after his team suffered a penalty shoot-out defeat
to hosts France in the quarter-finals at World Cup finals on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It is the third World Cup in a row that Italy has been sent
packing in the same way.
</P>
<P>
Italian Soccer Federation president Luciano Nizzola made no
effort to defend Maldini after the match:"It is premature to be
talked about now," said Nizzola, "I've nothing to reproach the team
for, but clearly, I am bitterly disappointed about the way things
have worked out."
</P>
<P>
Nizzola said:"This group of players has been crying about this
defeat. But I have to say that I think that's excessive--because I
don't think they have anything to feel guilty about."
</P>
<P>
Maldini said he felt his future was uncertain:"There will be a
time to think about the future, but this is not the right moment."
</P>
<P>
Paolo Maldini, captain of the Italian team and son of Cesare
Maldini, said he was not satisfied:"I've played 19 matches in World
Cup finals and lost only one. But I've never won anything."
</P>
<P>
"At the moment, the bitterness is so strong that I feel like
finishing with the national team and to making way for younger
players," Paolo Maldini said.

<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA ATA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Kazakhstan President Nursultan
Nazarbayev gave a banquet here Sunday in honor of visiting Chinese
President Jiang Zemin.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said in his toast that since the establishment of
diplomatic relations, Kazakhstan and China have brought their
economic, scientific and cultural cooperation to a new level.
</P>
<P>
But he noted that the most important achievement of all is the
agreement the two countries have reached on the most complex issue
of border demarcation.
</P>
<P>
"The signing of a complementary agreement on the remaining two
sections of the border is a manifestation of the mutual understanding
and good will of our two countries," Nazarbayev said.
</P>
<P>
He added that the signing of the agreement will lay a solid
foundation for the two countries to pursue bolder programs, seek
common prosperity and deepen friendship.
</P>
<P>
President Jiang said in reply that the two countries have been
on very good terms by fostering good-neighborliness and
cooperation.
</P>
<P>
He said that the complete settlement of border issues is a
result of the efforts of both countries to deepen their mutual
trust and understanding.
</P>
<P>
Jiang emphasized that as long as the two countries based their
relations on equal consultation and mutual accommodation, any
complex problem can be solved.

<HEADLINE> Intel to Suspend Production for 10 Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Los Angeles, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Intel, the world's largest chip
maker, will begin a temporary suspension of production at two chip
assembly plants in Hillsboro, Oregan for about 10 days, beginning
this holiday weekend, according to reports from the company.
</P>
<P>
"This is a warm-down to reduce the inventory of older
products", Intel spokesman Tom Waldrop said Thursday. "You don't
shut the plant down, you suspend production."
</P>
<P>
About 1,700 employees work in the two plants and Intel said
that most of them will take 10 days off without pay.
</P>
<P>
The news of a manufacturing cutback comes amid rumors
circulating on Wall Street over the past few days that Intel may
announce further job cuts, or even layoffs, in addition to the
3,000 layoffs already announced.
</P>
<P>
Industry sources noted that the California-based chip maker has
been under pressure from the relentless price cuts in the personal
computer industry and it has also quickened the pace of price cuts
for all its chips in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Intel, as well as the entire semiconductor industry, is also
hurt by the current economic crisis in Asia, they said, adding
that some semiconductor makers have announced layoffs or early
retirement packages in efforts to cut costs and staff amid
sluggish demand for chips.

<HEADLINE> Argentine Coach Tips Netherlands as Title Candidates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
MARSEILLE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Before his team play the Netherlands
in the quarter-finals, Argentine team manager Daniel Passarella tipped
the Dutch team as possible candidates for the World Cup title.
</P>
<P>
"The Netherlands team are now likely candidates for the final
victory," said Passarella, "I've often played against them on the
pitch. They've always been very good, spectacular matches, notably
for the final of the 1978 World Cup in Argentina."
</P>
<P>
"The successive Netherlands teams have always had a little South
American touch in their game and it's true I appreciate their
style," Passarella said.
</P>
<P>
Passarella said he would decide the starters after talking to
medical staff of the team:"I can't say whether the team has
recovered from the effort needed to beat England, but I think these
72 hours' rest have allowed everybody to get back on their feet."
</P>
<P>
"As for Ortega who suffered cramps when playing against England,
he should normally be in good shape physically." Passarella added.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria's New Chief of General Staff Appointed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria's former Chief of Naval
Staff Rear Admiral Ikahai Mike Akhigbe has been appointed the
chief of general staff, replacing Oladipo Diya, who was sentenced
to death two months ago for coup plotting.
</P>
<P>
A statement issued in the capital Abuja Friday night
announcing the appointment of Nigeria's No. 2 position, also
named Air-Vice Marshal Alami Dagash as the new chief of defense
staff.
</P>
<P>
Daggash, the commander of the Nigerian Defense Academy until
the appointment, succeeds General Abdulsalam Abubakar who is now
the Head of State and Commander-In-Chief of the Armed Forces of
Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
Abubakar was the chief of defense staff until his appointment
on June 9 as head of state following the sudden death of General
Sani Abacha the previous day.
</P>
<P>
Akhigbe was born on September 29, 1946 in Fugar, southern Edo
State. After graduation from the Nigerian Defense Academy, he
took courses on naval technology, weapons and operations in
India, Italy, the Netherlands, Britain and Germany in early
1970s.
</P>
<P>
He was once appointed governor of Lagos State, the then
national capital, in late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
With the new appointment, Akhigbe is expected to reduce the
burden on the office of the head of state which took over the
schedule following Diya's removal.
</P>
<P>
Daggash will also coordinate the affairs of the three arms of
the military. But it was unclear Friday night if he would
combine his schedule with that of the minister of defense, a
position held by General Abacha until his death.

<HEADLINE> Relocation of HK Airport From Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The process of relocation of the
Hong Kong International Airport from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok
started on May 6 to be consistent with new airport opening on July
6.
</P>
<P>
The unprecedented move comprises five phases over a
three-month period, of which the night move during the late hours
of July 5 and the early hours of July 6 is "most critical".
</P>
<P>
The objectives of the relocation are to achieve a seamless
transfer of airport operation from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok and to
ensure that Hong Kong, at all times, has a fully functional
airport whether at Kai Tak or Chek Lap Kok, according to the
Airport Authority tasked with building and managing the new
airport.
</P>
<P>
The dates and times of the various phases are as
follows: pre-advance move, from May 6 to June 4; advance move,
from June 5 to June 21; main body move, from June 22 to 17:30
hours July 5; night move, from 17:30 hours July 5 to 06:30 hours
July 6; and follow-on move till August 5.
</P>
<P>
The relocation exercise is planned on the basis of three
inter-linked operations: the departure from Kai Tak; the journey
from Kai Tak to the new airport, including allocation of time
slots for moves by road, sea and air; reception and distribution
at Chek Lap Kok.
</P>
<P>
The bulk of the movement of vehicles and equipment will take
place by road, but will be supplemented, especially in the final
stages, by barge transportation and in night move by air
transport.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that 10,000 land movements, 70 barge movements
and 30 aircraft movements will be required through the exercise,
according to the Airport Authority.
</P>
<P>
The success of the move requires close coordination between the
 Airport Authority, various government departments such as Police,
 Transport Department and Marine Department, and all business
partners.
</P>
<P>
Contingency planning in case of bad weather has been prepared
as early July is prone to typhoon and rainstorm.
</P>
<P>
Postponement of the final stages of the move will be considered
 if there is any likelihood of winds high enough, for example, 40
kilometers per hour or above, to necessitate partial closure of
the Lantau Link, a major road link between Kowloon and the new
airport.
</P>
<P>
The hoisting of a No. 3 typhoon signal will also mean the
automatic suspension of the sea move as barge operators' insurance
is no longer valid under the conditions.

<HEADLINE> Kenya's Tax Collections up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Kenya Revenue Authority (KRA)
collected 154 billion Kenyan Shillings (2.6 billion U.S. Dollars)
from tax-payers during the 1997/98 fiscal year (July/June), up 18
percent from the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The collections in the 1996/97 fiscal year stood at 130.6
billion Shillings (2.2 billion Dollars).
</P>
<P>
The hike was due to improved management of tax collections by
the authority, KRA Commissioner-General John Msafari was quoted
by the Daily Nation newspaper Saturday as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said in a statement that there was an increased voluntary
compliance by taxpayers, as well as more effective enforcement.
</P>
<P>
There was also a reduction in dumping of uncustomed goods and
an increased field audit by KRA, as opposed to desk audits which
are prone to manipulation by some tax-payers, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The authority had established a large taxpayer unit to deal
with corporate clients with a turnover in excess of 500 million
Shillings and an investigations unit to fight multiple tax
evasion.
</P>
<P>
During the 1997/98 fiscal year, KRA collected a total of 78.2
billion Shillings (1.3 billion Dollars) from Customs and Excise,
which were 2.2 billion Shillings above the target.
</P>
<P>
Income tax brought in 56.4 billion Shillings which were over
one billion Shillings above the target. But earnings from road
transport fell short of the target of 1.38 billion Shillings by
411 million Shillings.
</P>
<P>
However, "The 1998/99 financial year is going to be even more
challenging as we are aiming at generating much more revenue for
the government, economic uncertainties notwithstanding," said
Msafari.
</P>
<P>
In the 1998/99 budget announced last month, Finance Minister
Simeon Nyachae said the independence of KRA would be enhanced by
reducing the number of board members from the public sector while
raising the number of members from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
The independence of KRA was one of the pre-conditions set by
donors before the resumption of aid.

<HEADLINE> Over 24,000 Herd of Cattle Stolen in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, July 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 24,000 herd of cattle
worth about 3.4 million U.S. Dollars have been stolen from
commercial farms in Zimbabwe in the last two years.
</P>
<P>
The Cattle Producers' Association (CPA) told The Herald daily
Friday that a herd of 10,220 was stolen in 1996 while 10,117 was
stolen last year. Nearly 4,000 cattle have been stolen so far
this year.
</P>
<P>
The association said the recovery rate of 18 percent was
"nothing short of pathetic," the Daily Herald reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The farmers and an insurance company had jointly launched a
police stock-theft station of the month to motivate police
stations to investigate stock-theft more seriously.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the CPA has deplored delays by South Africa to
allow Zimbabwe's live exports, 1,500 tons of processed beef
products and a beef quota of 5,000 tons.
</P>
<P>
The CPA said it had lost multi-million Dollar export
opportunities because of the delays.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Kazakh Border Issues Completely Solved: Jiang </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ALMA-ATA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin said
here Saturday that China and Kazakhstan have thoroughly solved the
border issues between them.
</P>
<P>
In line with the principles of equal consultation and mutual
understanding, the two sides have reached agreement on all the
remaining border issues, which represents a complete resolution to
them, said Jiang while meeting with his Kazakh counterpart
Nursultan Nazarbayev.
</P>
<P>
Border issues are always very sensative and complicated in
international relations and, if not properly solved, can often
trigger conflicts, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He said the smooth settlement of the border issues will greatly
deepen the mutual trust and friendship between the two countries,
and will have a positive impact on their efforts to solve border
issues with other countries.
</P>
<P>
Nazarbayev said that the supplementary border agreement is a
very important document, which represents a complete solution to
the remaining border issues between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
China and Kazakhstan signed a border agreement in April 1994
and a supplementary border agreement in July 1996.
</P>
<P>
On trade relations, Nazarbayev said that China has become a
very important trade partner to Kazakhstan thanks to the signing
of a series of cooperation agreements in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the two countries should intensify their
mutual investment.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the two presidents also reiterated their
firm opposition to national splittism, saying that the two
countries will crack down on terrorist activities and safeguard
regional stability.

<HEADLINE> Iran Asks U.S. to Do More in Anti-Drug Campaign </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Iran's prosecutor-general has said
the United States can play a more effective role in fighting drugs
if it has good will toward Iran's anti-drug campaign.
</P>
<P>
Morteza Moghtadai was responding to Washington's claimed
support to Iran's efforts to crack down on the rampant drug
traffic through its territory.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the moderate daily Iran News, Moghtadai
blamed the U.S. for adopting "a political approach toward efforts
to combat illicit drug trafficking and abstains from voicing the
truth."
</P>
<P>
It was only lately that the U.S. acknowledged Iran's anti-drug
efforts, after both began to seek ways to ease their long-running
hostility. U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright last month
praised Iran's fight against drugs, saying Washington was ready to
improve ties with Tehran.
</P>
<P>
However, the Iranian official accused some Americans of
"supporting drug traffickers." "We have documents proving that the
Americans themselves escalate addiction, and distribute and
produce narcotics," Moghtadai said.
</P>
<P>
He claimed that Mafia groups and professional smugglers that
distribute and bring heroin into Iran are supported by their
American collaborators.
</P>
<P>
On Thursday Iran threw 50 tonnes of opium and one tonne of
heroin into fire on the occasion of the World Anti-Drug Day, to
exhibit its determination and call on the international community
to help its campaign.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Police Probe Plot to Murder UNIP Leaders </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Zambian police are
investigating a plot to eliminate five central committee members
of the country's largest opposition United National Independence
Party (UNIP) as wrangles in the embattled political party
continue.
</P>
<P>
Three Zambians and three South Africans who have been
allegedly hired to assassinate the UNIP leaders have been named
and the three Zambians are former military personnel,
the government-owned Zambia Daily Mail reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Police service spokesman Beenwell Chimfwembe confirmed here
Friday receipt of the plan reported to police by some of the
people who have been listed for elimination.
</P>
<P>
Those to be eliminated include party secretary general
Sebastian Zulu, party chairman Malimba Masheke, publicity deputy
chairman Pickson Chitambala, deputy party secretary general
Fenwick Chifunda and chairman for youth Mwashikanda Liso,
according to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The paper said that Liso confirmed that he had reported the
matter to police after sympathizers informed him about the plot.
</P>
<P>
The person leading the plot has also been named while the
hit-men have been put under a 24-hour police surveillance.
</P>
<P>
Liso said the three South Africans had been accommodated
within Lusaka and dates when the scheme is to be carried out have
been identified.
</P>
<P>
In a note shown to the paper by Liso, the plot is to start on
July 5 with Zulu and Chifunda as the targets. The rest are to be
attacked on August 4 with a possibility of change of plans if the
initial days planned for the attack are not suitable for various
reasons.
</P>
<P>
UNIP led by former president Kenneth Kaunda has been entangled
in the past months in internal wrangles over party leadership
while Kaunda was detained for allegedly involvement in the
country's foiled military coup.
</P>
<P>
The party is scheduled to hold a crucial central committee
meeting Saturday at which several matters are to be tabled
including the impending resignation of party president Kaunda.

<HEADLINE> A Brief History of Hong Kong's Kai Tak Airport </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Kai Tak, formally named Hong Kong
 International Airport, has emerged as one of the world's busiest
airports in tandem with the growth of the city it has served for
more than 70 years.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, its last full year of operation, Kai Tak, handled 28.3
 million passengers and 1.79 million tons of cargo, ranking the
third among global airports in terms of international passengers
and topping the rank in terms of cargo throughput.
</P>
<P>
Total aircraft movements hit 165,154 in 1997, making Kai Tak
one of the busiest airports in the world -- and all on a single
runway. To put in another way, every two minutes during peak hours
there is an aircraft taking off or landing at Kai Tak.
</P>
<P>
More than 60 airlines now offer direct regular services to link
Hong Kong with more than 100 destinations all over the world.
</P>
<P>
Kai Tak is so important that it handles, in value terms, one
quarter of Hong Kong's total imports of goods, one third of
exports, and one sixth of re-exports.
</P>
<P>
Built on a reclaimed field of 334 hectares, Kai Tak is
characterized by a 3,390-meter runway protruding from northwest to
southeast into the Kowloon Bay.
</P>
<P>
At the very beginning, the piece of land was reclaimed for a
residential housing scheme by two businessmen, Ho Kai and Au Tak,
after whom the airport was named. The company they formed,
unfortunately, went bust soon, and the reclaimed land was left
vacant until it was found suitable to be used as an airfield.
</P>
<P>
The first recorded flight from Kai Tak took place on Lunar New
Year's Day in 1925. Hong Kong's aviation began on this unique
piece of land with a flying school and a British military flying
unit. The first commercial flight landed on March 23, 1936 from
Penang with one passenger and 16 bags of mail, signifying the
advent of true commercial aviation at Kai Tak.
</P>
<P>
Entering into the 1950s, Kai Tak embarked on an era of rapid
development of airport facilities in order to catch up with the
phenomenal growth of passenger volume, which frequently recorded
an increase of 20 percent per year.
</P>
<P>
In 1996, Kai Tak reached an important milestone as it became
the third busiest in the world in terms of international
passengers and the busiest in terms of cargo throughput. The
airport handled a historic high of 29.5 million international
passengers, and 1.56 million tons of cargoes that year.
</P>
<P>
Cramped in residential blocks near the Kowloon Bay, Kai Tak has
no room for expansion both in space and time. Instead of running
around the clock, the airport handles no flight movements, both
takeoffs and landings, between 11:30 p.m. and 6:30 a.m. out of
consideration for the 380,000 people living under the flight path.
</P>
<P>
Kai Tak will be closed on July 6, 1998 when a new airport at
Chek Lap Kok is opened for business. According to the Planning,
Environment and lands Department, Kai Tak will be redeveloped to
house Hong Kong residents and a feasibility study is underway.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Considers Increasing Visa Application Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet is considering
proposed amendments to the Immigration Law which will bring a
sharp rise in visa application and consular service fees.
</P>
<P>
The increase is necessary to bring the fees in line with
service costs, according to the Interior Ministry which proposed
the amendments.
</P>
<P>
A government official on Saturday confirmed press reports that
the proposal, already approved by the Foreign Ministry, will raise
the application fee for a single entry visa from 500 baht (12 U.S.
dollars) to 2,000 baht (48.7 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, a multiple entry visa valid for one year
will cost 5,000 baht (121 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The application fee for an immigrant's certificate is to jump
from 2,000 to 8,000 baht (195 dollars) and the certificate itself
is to cost 200,000 baht (4,878 dollars) instead of the present
50,000 baht (1,219 dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the Interior Ministry said the fees, once raised,
could be lowered to reflect the actual costs.

<HEADLINE> Trade Pact Between Kenya, Zimbabwe Urged to Be </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, July 4 (Xinhua) -- A Kenyan cabinet minister has
urged the 14-year-old trade agreement between Kenya and Zimbabwe
be reviewed to reflect the changes that have taken place in
southern and eastern Africa.
</P>
<P>
Kenyan Trade Minister Joseph Kamotho cited developments within
the Common Market for Southern and Eastern Africa (COMESA) and
the emergence of South Africa as a powerful trading nation after
the end of apartheid.
</P>
<P>
It was regrettable that there is a low volume of trade between
the two states and that the around four-billion-Shilling (67.34
million U.S. Dollars) commerce was heavily in favor of Zimbabwe,
he was quoted Saturday by the Daily Nation newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
Kenya exported goods worth some 520 million Shillings (8.75
million Dollars) to Zimbabwe and imported goods worth about 3.3
billion Shillings (55.6 million Dollars) from it last year.
</P>
<P>
Most of the Kenyan imports from Zimbabwe are raw materials for
the manufacture of iron and steel products, the minister said
Friday.
</P>
<P>
Kamotho emphasized the need for businessmen from both
countries to attend regional trade fairs, saying Kenyan traders
got orders worth 100 million Shillings (1.68 million Dollars)
last year at the Harare International Trade Fair.
</P>
<P>
He also revealed that Kenya is working on modalities for the
establishment of a trade agreement with South Africa.

<P>
YINCHUAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The city of Wuzhong, in northwest
China's Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, revised a plan not a long
ago to widen its West Ring Road in order to protect an Islamic
Mosque which would have otherwise been destroyed.
</P>
<P>
A detour moved the road 10 meters away the originally planned
route, with change in construction costing well over one million
yuan (120,000 US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Ningxia, China's only provincial-level autonomous region
inhabited by the people of ethnic Hui group, has extended great
efforts over the past 20 years to protect religious sites in
strict accordance with state policies on nationalities and
religion.
</P>
<P>
The number of Islamic venues has grown from 1,800 when the
region was founded some 40 years ago to more than 3,000 sites,
according to Zhang Zhongxiao, an official with the Ningxia
Religious Affairs Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Each mosque in the region serves an average of 500 Muslims, or
a figure well above the national average of one mosque for every
1,000 Muslims, said Zhang, adding that China has more than 20
million Muslims with some 23,000 mosques.
</P>
<P>
Since the beginning of 1980s, Ningxia opened all related
projects for religious activities in the 1980s and since
refurbished numerous mosques with financial assistance from both
the central and local governments, with the former allocating well
over two million yuan (241,000 US dollars) for relevant projects.

<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- More than 400 people were injured in
a new earthquake that hit southern Turkey early Saturday, the
semi-official Anatolia News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that the earthquake, measuring 5.1 degrees on
the open-ended Richter scale, took place at 05:15 local time (0215
GMT) and its epicenter was at the city of Adana, some 400
kilometers southeast of the capital.
</P>
<P>
The agency said that some people got injured by jumping from
their balconies and some people suffered heart attack due to
panic. This is the the strongest of more than 70 aftershocks after
the previous earthquake a week ago, which ravaged the city, killed
more than 140 people and injured about 1,500 others.
</P>
<P>
It added that the injured were rushed to various hospitals in
Adana for treatment.
</P>
<P>
Last Saturday, Adana and its nearby city of Ceyhan in southern
Turkey were jolted by a strong earthquake measuring 6.3 degrees on
the Richter scale.

related sites.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Zhang said, governments at all levels in the region
have adopted impartial policies for approving and registering all
religions and religious venues.

<HEADLINE> Clinton's Visit to China a Success: HK Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill Clinton's
just-concluded visit to China was very successful and it has
brought the Sino-U.S. relations to a new stage of cooperation, an
editorial of Hong Kong's Chinese-language newspaper Wen Wei Po
said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president finished his nine-day visit on Friday, when
his special plane left Hong Kong, the last leg of his China trip,
for home.
</P>
<P>
The change in President Clinton's policies toward China and a
switch from confrontation to cooperation for a constructive
strategic partnership with China fully accords with the interests
of the United States, the editorial said. Clinton's visit to China
has accomplished what had been expected and was a complete
success, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The agreement reached by the heads of state of the two
countries not to point their strategic nuclear weapons at each
other demonstrates to the world that China and the United States
are partners, not adversaries, as pointed out by President Jiang.
The two countries can trust and cooperate with each other, the
newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
The two countries decided to push forward their bilateral
relations to increase cooperation in more fields in the
future. The improvement of Sino-American relations is consistent
with the current trend of peace and development. In such
historical circumstances, the two countries have more things in
common and the foundation for cooperation has been further
strengthened, the editorial continued.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue is among the most important and sensitive ones
in Sino-U.S. relations. In his meeting with Chinese President
Jiang Zemin in Beijing, President Clinton publicly reiterated that
the United States upholds the one-China policy and abides by the
principles contained in the three Sino-U.S. joint communiques, and
does not support Taiwan's independence, nor "one China, one
Taiwan," nor "two Chinas," nor Taiwan's bid to join any
international organizations made of only sovereign states.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. president reaffirmed this policy later in Shanghai and
he expressed during the visit to Hong Kong his support for
dialogue across the Taiwan Straits and settlement of disputes
through peaceful means. These statements will play a positive role
in promoting Sino-American relations, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
There are differences between China and the United States, but
they can be discussed through open and honest discussions.
</P>
<P>
The United States should treasure the favorable trend in the
development of the Sino-American relations, keep its promise and
take resolute actions to overcome obstacles to the improvement of
the bilateral relations, the editorial added.

<HEADLINE> Interview: Great Airport, Big Challenge to Builder  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Building the Hong Kong new
airport is the biggest challenge for Dr. Henry Townsend in his
30-year career managing civil engineering and infrastructure
projects worldwide.
</P>
<P>
"I would say this is probably the most challenging job I've
ever faced in my career," said Townsend, who has been Chief
Executive Officer of the Hong Kong Airport Authority (AA) for six
years, overseeing the day-to-day progress of the mammoth project
that took eight years to finish.
</P>
<P>
The new airport is built on a reclaimed field named Chek Lap
Kok off the northern coast of Lantau Island, 25 km to the west of
the Hong Kong central business district.
</P>
<P>
It took two years and a half to complete the reclamation and
excavation to create the 1,248-hectare airport platform. "It is
the largest undertaking of this kind in the world," said Townsend,
who is a registered professional engineer from the United States,
but has built up his presence in Hong Kong for almost a decade.
</P>
<P>
Before the completion of the platform, construction of the
nine-level Y-shaped passenger terminal building had started.
Covering a total floor space of 516,000 square meters at opening,
this is the world's largest airport terminal, which stretches 1.27
km from its entrance to the end of the Y-shaped concourse.
</P>
<P>
"It was a fast-track type of construction project of enormous
magnitude, and required a considerable amount of coordination with
and between the contractors that were involved," said the
65-year-old engineer.
</P>
<P>
Asked what made it a success to complete such a massive project
on time and within budget, Townsend spoke highly of the teamwork
spirit: "I think this is attributed to the people factor."
</P>
<P>
"One of the keys to the success of the airport building is to
orchestrate all of those various activities and have them finished
on time at the end in a successful way," he said.
</P>
<P>
The achievements, one coming after another, have brought to the
Chief Executive Officer and his colleague a great deal of
satisfaction.
</P>
<P>
According to him, the new airport, as it opens, will probably
be the most advanced facility in the world considering the wide
use of the latest proven technology, in communications, ticketing,
baggage handling, and flight information screening.
</P>
<P>
Despite the complexity of construction, the airport is simple
and user-friendly. Townsend said that the flows of passengers
would be quite straight forward.

<TEXT>
<P>
On arrivals, it is all a continuous one-level process on level
5. Passengers come through the concourses into immigration control
desks, baggage reclaiming area, customs inspection counters, the
meeting point, and finally to the transport center in a total
air-conditioned environment with good lighting and nice
surroundings.
</P>
<P>
On departures, there is only one-level change. Passengers come
in level 8, then go through the ramp, check-in area, immigration,
customs, and move one level down to the loading bridges.
</P>
<P>
In tandem with the opening of the new airport, an integrated
transport network will be started to link Chek Lap Kok to
different parts of Hong Kong with railway, bus, taxi and ferry
services.
</P>
<P>
Townsend looks on the new airport as a real opportunity for
Hong Kong. "Kai Tak has reached its maximum potential. The new
Chek Lap Kok removes growth constrains and allows a more orderly
development of aviation-related services for Hong Kong and the
surrounding region," he said.
</P>
<P>
The new airport is built to cater for aviation needs into the
next century, which is able to handle 35 million passengers and
three million tons of cargo a year at opening. Ultimately, it is
capable of handling 87 million passengers and nine million tons of
cargo annually.
</P>
<P>
As the new airport is to open for commercial operation in less
than 48 hours, Townsend said: "It takes a long and hard road up to
this point."
</P>
<P>
"Besides the pride being involved in the project, there will be
an immense relief to see it finished and operating successfully,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
But at the moment, he and all the AA staff members are busy
with preparations for the overnight move of airport operations
from Kai Tak to Chek Lap Kok on July 5, which will involve more
than 1,000 movements by air, sea and land.
</P>
<P>
"So far, I am optimistic that there should not be any major
problems," said Townsend, who will stay up all night at his office
at Chek Lap Kok to keep an eye on the transfer.
</P>
<P>
He said: "The fundamental point is that Kai Tak has to be 100
percent safety and security right up to its final closure. And
similarly, the Chek Lap Kok must be 100 percent safety and
security for the opening of commercial aviation on the morning of
July 6."
</P>
<P>
Townsend will continue to oversee the initial stage of
management of the new airport until November 1998 when his term of
appointment expires. He has not worked out a plan for the future
yet, but the gray-haired engineer laughed: "Certainly, running a
project of this size at my age is not (within the plan)."
</P>
<P>
"Look back on it, I should say what a wonderful opportunity it
has been to work in Hong Kong," he said. "The project is extremely
challenging, and certainly for that reason, it has been most
rewarding in terms of professional satisfaction."

<HEADLINE> UNDP Undertakes Training Project in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. Development Program (UNDP)
has undertaken a massive program to train elected representatives
of the lowest-level local governments of union councils and
municipalities in Bangladesh, The Independent daily reported
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 60,000 people's representatives, including chairmen
and members of union councils and chairmen and commissioners of
municipalities, will be trained under the project titled "Building
Capacity for Local Governance."
</P>
<P>
The UNDP will provide about 490 million taka (some 10.6 million
U.S. dollars) for the five-year project with the National
Institute of Local Government as the executive agency and the
project is scheduled to be completed in 2002.
</P>
<P>
The project is aimed at producing well-trained, well-oriented
local representatives equipped with skills and knowledge to serve
their constituents effectively and in turn this will help develop
a more responsive and transparent system of local governance, a
UNDP document on the matter was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
The key aim of the training program will be to institutionalize
the participatory process of governance at the local level between
the chairperson and the legislative body, as well as between local
government bodies and female and male constituents, the document
stated.
</P>
<P>
The ultimate beneficiaries of the project will be the
electorate, whose relationship to processes of local governance
will be greatly enhanced by the effective training of their
elected representatives, it said.
</P>
<P>
After being trained, the representatives will be more
accountable and responsive, with greater sensitization and
capacity to deliver services justly, equitably and responsively,
the document added.

<HEADLINE> Costa Rica to Improve Coffee Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SAN JOSE, July 3 (Xinhua) -- President of the Costa Rican
Coffee Institute (ICAFE) Arnoldo Lopez proposed to develop a
program to improve the quality of coffee before a possible price
drop in the international market.
</P>
<P>
The price of a quintal (46 kilos) of coffee dropped from 177.10
U.S. dollars quoted in January to 110.75 dollars Thursday in the
New York Stock Exchange.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the speculators action in the stock market, the news
of abundant harvests in some producing countries contributed to
the drop, Lopez said here Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The prospect is disappointing, because the price is getting
closer to 100 dollars per quintal," said Lopez.
</P>
<P>
The price for a quintal was above 150 dollars in the last three
years, which, among other reasons, caused the implementation of a
quota system by the bigger producing countries to prevent an
excessive increase of the supply.
</P>
<P>
Facing a foreseeable period of low price, the new ICAFE
president announced a program to introduce high technology in
production to improve the quality of coffee and the productivity.
</P>
<P>
Coffee, which for years has been the major export of Costa
Rica, continues to be an important element for the country's trade
balance and the sustenance for thousands of small and medium
producers.

<P>
The News:
</P>
<P>
-- Following his visit to the violence-hit city of Karachi,
Minister for Political Affairs Nisar Ali Khan resolved that the
situation in Karachi would come under control within 48 hours as
the operation will be focused on 12 troubled police stations where
major crime is taking place.
</P>
<P>
The Nation:
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Construct Another Huge Bridge </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh will start building the
country's second largest bridge, Paksey Bridge, late this year,
English newspapers here reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The 2.15-kilometer-long and 18.1-meter-wide bridge will be
constructed over the Padma River, which runs from northwest to
southeast Bangladesh, at a total cost of 5.96 billion taka (about
130 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Of the total amount, 100 million dollars will be provided by
the Japanese government under an accord signed between the two
sides and the rest will come from internal resources.
</P>
<P>
The foundations of the bridge, linking the country's northern
and southern parts which are separated by the mighty Padma River,
are expected to be laid in December this year and the whole
project would be completed by June 2001, the reports quoted
Communications Ministry sources as saying.
</P>
<P>
Feasibility study on the construction of the bridge was
conducted by two British and one local firms between March and
July 1996, the sources added.
</P>
<P>
Situated in South Asia and on the verge of the Bay of Bengal,
Bangladesh is crisscrossed by more than 230 rivers.
</P>
<P>
The transportation issue has constricted the country's economic
development. The Bangladeshi government has attached great
importance to bridge construction for rapid expansion of the
national economy.
</P>
<P>
The 4.8-kilometer-long and 18.5-meter-wide Jamuna Multipurpose
Bridge, the longest bridge in Bangladesh and in South Asia, was
completed with 950 million dollars and inaugurated on June 23 this
year.

<HEADLINE> Japanese PM Calls Clinton's China Visit Great Success </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro
Hashimoto said here Saturday that U.S. President Bill Clinton's
just-concluded state visit to China is a great success.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto made the remark during a meeting at his official
residence in Tokyo with U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright, who arrived here Friday night from Hong Kong to brief
Japan on Clinton's visit to China.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto and Albright spent the bulk of their 25-minute
meeting discussing Clinton's China visit, Japanese government
officials said.
</P>
<P>
Hashimoto told Albright that he had been following closely
Clinton's China visit and called the results as a "great success,"
the officials said.
</P>
<P>
Albright hailed accords reached during Clinton's China trip
between Washington and Beijing such as a mutual de-targeting
agreement of strategic nuclear weapons and a pledge on security
and nonproliferation cooperation on the arms race in South Asia.
</P>
<P>
On Japan's domestic issues, Albright told Hashimoto that the
U.S. government welcomed Japan's financial-system reform efforts
featured with a "bridge bank" scheme, referring to Clinton's
favorable remarks toward the plan at a press conference in Hong
Kong where the president ended his China trip Friday.
</P>
<P>
Ahead of his meeting with Clinton in Washington on July 22,
Hashimoto gave Albright an English translation of the Japanese
government's plan to salvage its bad loan-ridden banking system,
the officials said.

<HEADLINE> Cambodian Landmine Casualties Decline in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The number of landmine
casualties in Cambodia dropped 50 percent from 1996 to 1,353 last
year, Cambodia Daily Saturday quoted a Cambodian Red Cross report
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The report based on a survey covering 90 percent of the
landmine affected areas in the country said the casualties totaled
2,766 in 1996, a record high since 1979 due to a large dry-season
offensive.
</P>
<P>
The survey also revealed a correlation between fighting and the
number of mine victims.
</P>
<P>
To illustrate, the report said that Kampot province, one of the
mine-ridden but stable areas, saw only 19 incidents last year
compared to 425 in Battambang province where fighting continued.
</P>
<P>
The decline in the number of victims indicates that people have
learned to co-exist with the mines, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Last year also saw a decline in deaths to 18 percent of the
victims from its long-term average of 36 percent from 1979 to 1996.
</P>
<P>
Military-related casualties were a slight majority of the
victims in 1997 at 52 percent, with 48 percent related to civilian
causes.
</P>
<P>
Women accounted for 10 percent of the total victims in 1997 as
previous years while men remained to be the majority.
</P>
<P>
Two decades of civil war and lingering unrest have turned
Cambodia into one of the most heavily mined countries in the
world. There are an estimated four to six million mines littered
in Cambodian soil and mine explosions have maimed and killed many
innocent people.

<HEADLINE> Autonomy Is Solution to Kosovo Crisis: Italian FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, July 3 (Xinhua) -- A "strong autonomy" for Kosovo's
ethnic Albanians is a solution to their conflicts with the Serb
government of Yugoslavia, Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto Dini
said at a cabinet meeting on Friday.
</P>
<P>
"A status of a strong autonomy constitutes a solution to the
crisis and the international community will continue to exert
pressure on all sides in this direction," Dini said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the hypothesis of independence for the Serbian
province of Kosovo "does not represent a solution and must be
discouraged as it fuels further and wider conflicts."
</P>
<P>
Both the ethnic Albanian majority in Kosovo and Serb
authorities "must be strongly urged to swiftly cease armed clashes
and re-establish global and constructive dialogue in the prospect
of a peaceful and negotiated solution, based on realism and
Germany foresight," the Italian minister said.
</P>
<P>
According to the Beta news agency in Belgrade, leader of
Kosovo's Albanian majority Ibrahim Rugova on Friday rejected
autonomy for Kosovo, saying that the region must either be
independent or become an international protectorate.
</P>
<P>
He added that the future of Kosovo must be decided by the
population there.
</P>
<P>
U.S. envoy Richard Holbrooke arrived in Belgrade on Friday for
talks with Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic on Kosovo and is
expected to travel to Pristina on Saturday to meet Rugova, Beta
reported.
</P>
<P>
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Nicolai Afanievski will also be
in Belgrade on Saturday and may hold meetings with Holbrooke to
coordinate, as they did last week, the diplomatic efforts of
Washington and Moscow to re-open dialogue between the Albanians in
Kosovo and Belgrade authorities.
</P>
<P>
In Warsaw, Austrian Foreign Minister Wolfgang Schuessel on
Friday urged greater cooperation between the European Union and
the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to
"create a climate favorable to political negotiations on the
Kosovo crisis."
</P>
<P>
Poland currently holds the presidency of the OSCE and Austria
the European Union's rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel and his Polish counterpart Bronislaw Geremek agreed
after their talks on Friday to make a joint effort to support
moderate forces in Kosovo and to create a joint task force to
monitor the conflict.

Dini said here after meeting with Gonzales.

concern, including the Cuban-U.S. ties.

<HEADLINE> Thai Economic Measures Called Successful </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Thai Finance Minister Tarri
Nimmanahaeminda claimed on Friday that the government has
succeeded in implementing sound macroeconomic measures under the
International Monetary Fund's prescriptions one year after the
baht's devaluation.
</P>
<P>
The Thai government led by Prime Minister Chuan Leekpai has
successfully stabilized the baht's exchange rate and brought the
currency to an appropriate level, Tarrin said in remarks published
by The Nation newspaper Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the short-term interest rate could be lowered to
around 16 percent from its peak of 22 percent earlier this year,
Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
"Interest rates could be brought down further if the current
stability in regional foreign exchange rates continues," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Tarrin's deputy, Pisit Lee-artham, echoed the view,
saying the government has been successful in bringing down the
baht from its peak of 56 baht against the U.S. dollar in January
to its recent levels of around 40 baht.
</P>
<P>
The former government of Chavalit Yongchaiyudh floated the baht
on July 2 last year and sought an IMF bailout package valued at
17.2 billion dollars in August. The devaluation of the baht
triggered a regional currency crisis that also struck Indonesia
and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
After the baht was floated, the Thai economy was hit hard by
the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Pisit said if the regional crisis had not happened, the baht's
floatation would have created a more successful situation.
</P>
<P>
Looking back to last year, the Chuan government has faced many
difficulties ranging from a depletion in official reserves to the
inheritance of a troubled banking sector and its severe damage to
the real economic sectors.
</P>
<P>
"It is not easy to solve all the problems in such a short
period of time," Tarrin said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the necessary solutions to ease the problems have
brought a great deal of pain to the country. The unemployment rate
is rising and so is the inflation rate which has hovered at about
10 percent in recent months.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Considers Increasing Visa Application Fees </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The Thai cabinet is considering
proposed amendments to the Immigration Law which will bring a
sharp rise in visa application and consular service fees.
</P>
<P>
The increase is necessary to bring the fees in line with
service costs, according to the Interior Ministry which proposed
the amendments.
</P>
<P>
A government official on Saturday confirmed press reports that
the proposal, already approved by the Foreign Ministry, will raise
the application fee for a single entry visa from 500 baht (12 U.S.
dollars) to 2,000 baht (48.7 dollars).
</P>
<P>
Under the proposal, a multiple entry visa valid for one year
will cost 5,000 baht (121 dollars).
</P>
<P>
The application fee for an immigrant's certificate is to jump
from 2,000 to 8,000 baht (195 dollars) and the certificate itself
is to cost 50,000 baht (1,219 dollars) instead of the present
200,000 (4,878 dollars).
</P>
<P>
However, the Interior Ministry said the fees, once raised,
could be lowered to reflect the actual costs.

ZAGREB, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Herzegovina-Neretva authorities
have not done enough to prevent the occurrence of many incidents
aimed at obstructing the return of refugees and exiled persons, a
report issued by the United Nations mission in Bosnia said Friday.
</P>
<P>
A total of 61 such incidents took place in that region between
March 26, when an agreement on the return of minority people was
signed, and June 30.
</P>
<P>
The mission reported that 64 Bosniak (Muslim) houses were
damaged, and ten Bosniak-owned vehicles were either destroyed or
damaged.
</P>
<P>
Though the regional authorities took certain measures to help
stabilize the situation, not a single person suspected of
participating in these incidents have been arrested, the report
said.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Province Increases Investment to Spur Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- East China's Shandong Province has
increased investment to spur economic growth since early this year.
</P>
<P>
Shandong invested a total of 22 billion yuan (2.65 billion US
dollars) in fixed assets in the first five months of this year, up
17 percent from the corresponding period of last year, according
to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
The funds have been invested mainly in construction of
infrastructure facilities, real-estate development and technical
renovations in enterprises, a provincial official said.
</P>
<P>
One of China's economic powerhouses, Shandong has set its
economic growth rate at 9 percent this year, 1 percent higher than
the national target.
</P>
<P>
"As our exports have been affected by the Asian financial
crisis, increasing investment has become a main way for us to
boost economic growth," the official said.
</P>
<P>
While investment in infrastructure has surged in recent months,
Shandong's banking system has also increased lending for housing
construction. The provincial branch of the Industrial and
Commercial Bank of China, the country's largest bank, issued more
than 50 million yuan (6 billion US dollars) in housing loans in
the January-May period.
</P>
<P>
The provincial branch of the China Construction Bank,
meanwhile, has decided to increase its yearly housing loan
portfolio by 310 million yuan (37 million US dollars) this year on
the basis of last year's 480 million yuan (58 million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Because of increased financial support, both Shandong's
investment and housing sales rocketed more than 60 percent in the
first five months.
</P>
<P>
Overall, Shandong's total investment this year is expected to
be 20 percent more than last year, the official said.

<HEADLINE> China's Guangdong Province Resolved to Tackle Unemployment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, July 4 (Xinhua) -- South China's booming Guangdong
Province, a showcase of the country's market reforms, will strive
to resolve the issue of re-employment of laid-off state-owned
enterprise workers within five years.
</P>
<P>
"We will keenly develop the service sector and increase job
training," Vice-Governor Zhong Qiquan said.
</P>
<P>
The first three years will be mainly devoted to ensuring a
basic living guarantee and re-employment for workers displaced by
state-owned industrial enterprises, especially those in sectors
such as coal, sugar refining and textiles, according to Zhong.
</P>
<P>
"The number of people re-employed must be greater than that of
newly displaced workers during the period," he said.
</P>
<P>
To these ends, Guangdong has decided to earmark 35 million yuan
to establish a provincial level re-employment fund in the period
from 1997 to 2000. The provincial capital of Guangzhou, and
Zhuhai, Shantou, Zhongshan and another four cities have set up
their own re-employment funds, valued at 95.7 million yuan in
aggregate.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has also decided to set aside 50 million yuan in
special funds to help displaced workers who are exceptionally
needy.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics show that 534,000 workers were laid off in
Guangdong last year, with 289,000 finding new jobs the same year.
</P>
<P>
In the first five months of this year, 366,000 workers were
displaced in Guangdong while 132,000 were later re-employed.
</P>
<P>
Zhong said that Guangdong will take measures to ensure that no
less than 50 percent of the displaced workers will find new jobs
this year.
</P>
<P>
As China's market reforms go deeper, many workers have been
laid off by the state-owned enterprises, which were considered
overstaffed and inefficient.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's MPR to Hold Meeting on November 10 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's People's Consultative
Assembly (MPR), the country's highest legal body, will hold an
extraordinary meeting on November 10 this year to set the date for
the next general election, MPR Chairman Harmoko announced.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko, who is also speaker of the House of Representatives
(DPR), said here Friday that the date was earlier than the
agreement he had struck with President B.J. Habibie, local leading
newspapers reported Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement, an MPR meeting would be held by the end of
the year or beginning of 1999.
</P>
<P>
The MPR, which traditionally meets once every five years, met
in March to reelect President Soeharto for a seventh term in
office and Habibie for vice president. But Soeharto resigned in
May amid strong public pressure calling for political reforms.
</P>
<P>
Harmoko said the MPR leadership would assign the MPR Working
Committee to prepare the agenda and drafts to be discussed at the
extraordinary meeting.
</P>
<P>
He disclosed that there would be some changes in the MPR
membership before the meeting.
</P>
<P>
President Habibie last week already appointed 41 members to
replace those who were personally selected by Soeharto.
</P>
<P>
The MPR includes the 425 MPs directly elected in parliamentary
elections and 75 president-appointed MPs from the armed forces,
plus a further 500 presidential appointees.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, Harmoko said the general election will be held between
March and May next year and the MPR will elect a president and a
vice president at the end of 1999.

<HEADLINE> 40 Years of Recycling Remembered by the State </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Chinese leaders have long held that
collecting and recycling waste was an important part of saving
natural resources, reducing pollution and safeguarding the
ecology, said today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The late premier Zhou Enlai made the case 40 years ago.
</P>
<P>
From 1953 through last year, China's major garbage collector
and recycler, the All-China Federation of Supply and Marketing
Co-operatives, gathered 350 million tons of various waste. But
this wasn't just garbage. The materials they recycled were worth
168 billion yuan (20.24 billion US dollars).
</P>
<P>
Those recycling efforts meant the saving of two billion tons of
minerals, 400 million tons of coal, 222 million cubic meters of
wood and the reduction of household and industrial waste.
</P>
<P>
Yesterday, during a news conference to mark the 40th
anniversary of the late Premier Zhou's inscription urging the
nation to recycle, officials looked back and tallied their success.
</P>
<P>
The wastes collected and recycled by Chinese co-operatives
amount to 63 percent of the country's total each year and about
800,000 people from the co-operatives circle are involved in
wastes collection, recycling and processing, marketing of recycled
materials research and education on saving wastes, according to
Zhang Yuqi, director of the Administration Office of Recycled
Materials under the federation.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that the collected waste covered more than
1,000 varieties, including iron and steel, nonferrous metals,
rubber, plastics and bones.
</P>
<P>
Widespread use of recycled materials has preserved natural and
energy resources in China, a developing country with one of the
lowest per capita mineral resources, he added.
</P>
<P>
Small private businesses will be encouraged to help expand
waste collection businesses and advanced technology will be
introduced to develop in-depth processing and comprehensive
utilization of waste materials.

BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- China began to launch a large
energy conservation project in Beijing, Liaoning and Shandong
provinces with a World Bank (WB) loan of 63 million U.S. dollars
Friday.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, the project is also backed by
a 22-million-dollar donation from the Global Environmental Fund
(GEF) following successful pilot operations.
</P>
<P>
Zuo Liming, deputy director of the Energy Conservation and
Resource Utilization Department under the State Economic and Trade
Commission, said that the project will introduce efficient energy
conservation methods into China.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the bulk of the project will be carried out by
three model energy conservation companies established in Beijing,
northeast China's Liaoning Province and east China's Shandong
province.
</P>
<P>
These specialized energy management companies will provide a
series of proven energy conservation services, ranging from
project design, implementation, monitoring and management for
their customers, Zuo said.
</P>
<P>
On the basis of the three exemplary companies, China will
strive to spread this new mechanism to the whole country, and thus
stimulate the evolution of the energy conservation service
industry.
</P>
<P>
in addition, part of the GEF's donation will be used to support
the establishment of the State Energy Conservation Information
Distribution Center.

<HEADLINE> Austria's Economy to Continue Strong Growth: Forecast </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
VIENNA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Austria's economy will carry its
strong momentum into next year despite negative influences from
Asia's financial crisis, two economic institutes said in their
forecasts released here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The Austrian Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) predicted
that Austria's economy would grow by three percent this year and
3.2 percent in 1999.
</P>
<P>
The High-Level Institute (IHS) forecast a 3.1-percent rate for
the economic growth this year and a 2.8 percent for next year.
</P>
<P>
WIFO Director Helmut Kramer said good performances in exports
and industry as well as increasing investments in equipment were
boosting the country's economy and creating more jobs.
</P>
<P>
He predicted the number of jobless Austrians would go down next
year.
</P>
<P>
However, both institutes said Austria's economic growth would
slacken by 2000 at the latest.
</P>
<P>
The IHS even predicted that signs of weakening would appear as
early as next year.
</P>
<P>
IHS Director Bernhard Felderer said the economic crisis in some
Asian countries, especially in Japan, affected the United States
more than it did Europe and already led to a slowdown in the
U.S. economy.
</P>
<P>
The negative influences are also expected to spread to Europe,
at least in its exports to the U.S., he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARBIN, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The per-capita consumption of meat,
eggs and milk in this capital of northernmost Heilongjiang
Province is among the highest of China's 36 major cities.
</P>
<P>
Official data indicates that residents of Harbin consume an
average 50.2 kilograms (kg) of meat, 30.5 kg of eggs and 43 kg of
milk each year. All three figures are higher than the officially
mandated index.
</P>
<P>
Harbin residents used to have insufficient consumption of meat,
eggs and milk, as the city's animal husbandry remained undeveloped
in past decades.
</P>
<P>
Because of the implementation of a national "vegetable basket"
project, Harbin's animal husbandry sector has grown significantly.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Harbin has more than 2,600 animal husbandry farms,
with 16 percent of the rural households engaged in raising
domestic animals.
</P>
<P>
Harbin has also set up a number of animal feed workshops and
animal product processing factories. The city's animal products
market has an annual sales volume of more than three billion yuan
(360 million U.S. dollars).

JAKARTA, July 4 (Xinhua) -- At least 702 people in Indonesia
are known to be infected with the HIV virus which causes AIDS
(Acquired Immunity Deficiency Syndrome), the local press Saturday
quoted a minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Among them, 193 are positively suffering from AIDS while the
other 509 are HIV-infected, Coordinating Minister for People's
Welfare/Poverty Alleviation Haryono Suyono told reporters here
Friday.
</P>
<P>
He said the number of HIV/AIDS sufferers is expected to
increase to 700,000 in the next five years if no serious efforts
are made to fight the spread of the deadly disease.
</P>
<P>
"The figure is based on an expert count, but it could in
reality well be surpasses," he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister said the government is now developing a new,
simple and dynamic strategy, known as communication, information
and education, to counteract the spread of the disease.
</P>
<P>
He said impoverishment of large numbers of Indonesians might
increase the number of HIV-infected people and AIDS sufferers in
the country.
</P>
<P>
"Economic pressure might force more people into prostitution
and thus indirectly raise the number of people running the risk of
being infected with the deadly disease and virus," the minister
added.
</P>
<P>
The poverty rate in Indonesia has gone up from 11 percent to 40
percent or from 22.5 million to 80 million people.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Guerrillas Free 15 Female Hostages </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, July 3 (Xinhua) -- The Leftist guerrillas
Friday released 15 female hostages kidnapped in northeastern
Colombia three weeks ago, a presidential advisor said.
</P>
<P>
The girls, ranging from 13 to 21 years old, were handed over to
a humanitarian commission headed by Timorese Nobel Peace laureate
Jose Ramos Horta, some 300 kilometers north of the capital, said
Jose Noe Rios, the presidential peace commissioner.
</P>
<P>
The National Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia's second-largest
guerrilla group, said it kidnapped the girls because they belonged
to civic groups linked to the military. The hostages belonged to a
civic group called "Girl of Steel."
</P>
<P>
The freed hostages said they were treated well by their captors
but said they would quit the civic groups, fearing to be the
guerrillas' target again.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for the ELN called the release as a "goodwill
gesture" following its announcement that it would hold peace talks
with President-elect Andres Pastrana after he takes office on
August 7.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Discuss IRO Withdrawal With 2 Countries </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, July 4 (Xinhua) -- Rubber producers Thailand, Malaysia
and Indonesia will meet in Phuket, southern Thailand, later this
month to discuss whether they should withdraw from the
International Rubber Organization (IRO), according to the Thai
Agriculture Ministry.
</P>
<P>
Companies from each country would also be invited to take part
in the July 23-25 meeting, Deputy Agriculture Minister Somchai
Sunthornwat was quoted Saturday by the newspaper The Bangkok Post
as saying.
</P>
<P>
The three countries control about three-quarters of the world's
rubber trade, which is 5 million tons annually.
</P>
<P>
Thailand claims that the organization has played an
insignificant role in shoring up the price of rubber.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the Thai government has spent heavily to
support rubber prices. Last year, it spent 4.7 billion baht (114
million U.S. dollars) to buy 99,000 tons of rubber.
</P>
<P>
With the economic downturn forcing cuts in state spending,
Thailand is questioning the merits of paying 15 million baht
(365,000 dollars) a year for membership in the organization.
</P>
<P>
The International Rubber Organization groups 22 nations that
are major rubber producers and buyers. Thailand, the largest
producer, is expected to supply 1.8 million tons this year.

<HEADLINE> Zhejiang Efficient in Family Planning </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) -- The pursuit of a modern family life
has led to a big reduction in populace and boosted local economy
of east China's Zhejiang province, China Daily reported today.
</P>
<P>
The provincial "new family" planning program combining birth
control with building prosperous, happy and healthy families is
popular with the locals. The paper said that its results have also
drawn family planning and population control experts' attention.
</P>
<P>
Data from the provincial government show that by the end of
last year, Zhejiang's population is 44.34 million, 140,000 less
than expected. The birth rate dropped to 11.41 per thousand from
14.76 per thousand in 1992, and the natural population growth rate
stood at 4.93 per thousand last year.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, the average per-capital income there rose to
7,359 yuan (866 US dollars) in the cities and 3,684 yuan (433 US
dollars) in the countryside last year, ranking fourth and third
nationwide.
</P>
<P>
The figures were released yesterday at a national meeting to
study the theory and practice of "new family" planning in Zhejiang
province.
</P>
<P>
With the largest population in the world, China has long worked
hard to feed too many mouths with not enough food and has pursued
population growth control as one measure to thwart potential
disaster.
</P>
<P>
A group of population experts and some local family planning
workers are here assessing the new plan. They will visit some
pilot towns and villages in a number of cities including Shaoxing
and Ningbo.

<HEADLINE> Italian Players Disappointed About Defeat </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
PARIS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Italian players were very disappointed
by the penalty shoot-out defeat in the quarter-finals on Friday.
</P>
<P>
It was Italy's third straight penalty shoot-out loss in World Cup
finals.
</P>
<P>
Italian captain Paolo Maldini said:"I've played in three
consecutive World Cup competitions and t's as though history is
repeating itself. I've lost on penalty shoot-outs in a
quarter-final, a semi-final and a final."
</P>
<P>
"France is one of the favorites. They are playing at home and
they also seem to have luck on their side," said Maldini, "Don't
forget that they have scored the most goals so far even though they
didn't convert their chances this evening."
</P>
<P>
Veteran defender Giuseppe Bergomi said:"I am very happy to have
taken part in this World Cup. At my age, it's a bonus. The team
did its best and I think I gave everything I had."
</P>
<P>
Luigi di Biagio, who missed the penalty shot to give France the
victory, said:"It hardly seems fair to lost the World Cup in this
way and to feel in some way personally responsible is a dreadful
feeling. it's been amazing taking part but it's dreadful it ended
like this."
</P>
<P>
Roberto Baggio, who himself missed a penalty shot in the final
against Brazil four years ago, said:"Unfortunately this is the third
time for me. It leaves a very bitter taste. Penalties are the
worst way of all to lose."

</P>
<P>
He added, "It's always a shame to lose. But we played a world-class
game. We can be proud of the way we played."
</P>
<P>

<HEADLINE> Greece Criticizes West for Rapprochement With KLA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ATHENS, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Greece criticized Friday the Western
countries' efforts for rapprochement with the Kosovo Liberation
Army (KLA), which is trying to win Kosovo's independence from
Yugoslavia by the use of force.
</P>
<P>
Speaking in the northern Greek city of Thessaloniki, Greek
Defense Minister Akis Tsohatzopoulos said that the Kosovo crisis
could not be solved through military means but in a political,
peaceful, diplomatic manner by granting the broadest possible
autonomy to Kosovo where ethnic Albanians make up 90 percent of
its nearly 2 million population.
</P>
<P>
While expressing Greece's opposition to Kosovo's independence
from Yugoslavia, he urged Belgrade to agree to full
self-administration for Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
The minister also said that Greece fully supported the ethnic
Albanian leader Ibrahim Rugova in proceeding directly to form
integrated institutional support because such a move would upgrade
Rugova himself and his role with a simultaneous obligatory
abandonment of arms by the so-called liberation movement and its
subordination to the political leadership.

<TEXT>
<P>
NANTES, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Brazil entered the soccer World Cup
semifinals after a Rivaldo double lifted the world champions to a 3-2
quarterfinal win over Denmark here on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The win revenged the Brazilian loss to the same opponents in their
only previous clash in 1989 in Copenhagen, where the Danes won the
friendly 4-0.
</P>
<P>
Denmark stunned the world champions again Friday only two minutes
into the game when Martin Jorgensen scored on a short pass from Brian
Laudrup.
</P>
<P>
Brazil equalized nine minutes later through Bebeto, who slotted the
ball home past Manchester United keeper Peter Schmeichel after
receiving a pass from Inter Milan Ronaldo.
</P>
<P>
Brazil led the game for the first time in the 26th minute when
Rivaldo shot in a small angle from left just outside in the box.
</P>
<P>
But Laudrup kept the Danes in the picture by scoring in the 49th
minute and tying the game for the second time.
</P>
<P>
Defender Roberto Carlos had tried to clear the ball with a bicycle
kick but missed. Laudrup made no mistake to collect the ball to score.
</P>
<P>
Rivaldo, who plays for Spanish club side Barcelona, found the net
again in the 60th minute to score the winning goal for Brazil.
</P>
<P>
His 25-meter shot went off the right post and the saving effort
from Schmeichel proved futile.
</P>
<P>
Marc Rieper almost equalized for Denmark in the 43rd minute but the
header hit the crossbar.
</P>
<P>
Brazil's Cafu had a chance in the injury time but the ball was
saved.

<HEADLINE> Mozambique Welcomes EU Lift of Ban on Fish </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, July 3 (Xinhua) -- Mozambican Prime Minister Pascoal
Mocumbi Friday expressed his satisfaction with the lifting of
European Union (EU) ban on importing fish from the east African
coastal countries including Mozambique.
</P>
<P>
The move is positive and the EU should do so earlier, Mocumbi
said at a press conference in Maputo.
</P>
<P>
The EU imposed ban on fresh fish imports from Mozambique,
Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania in the end of 1997 because its member
states were concerned over cholera in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
According to the Mozambican News Agency, the World Food
Program (WFP) condemned the ban early this year, pointing out
that there had been no such cases as spreading of cholera through
imported food.
</P>
<P>
The EU disagreed with the WFP and has maintained the ban up to
six months.
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican government has for several times demanded that
the ban on fish import be lifted, noting that its fish products
have not polluted by cholera and asking the EU to come to
investigate.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the EU ban has caused Mozambican loss of
some six million U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We often hear the Europeans saying that Africa should open
its markets to them," Mocumbi said, adding that on contrary,
"Europe should open its markets to Africa earlier, because Africa
had opened its door to the Europeans when they first came to the
continent."
</P>
<P>
The Mozambican prime minister said he hopes that the EU would
better not make such irrational decision as the ban on fish
imports.
