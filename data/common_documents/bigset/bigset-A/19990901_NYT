   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, September
1:
</P>
<P>
   Disturbing new evidence suggests that the impact of powerful new
AIDS drugs in reducing death rates has begun to wane at the same
time that efforts to block the spread of the AIDS virus have
reached a plateau. The task of bringing the AIDS epidemic under
control will clearly require renewed vigor and new approaches to
prevention.
</P>
<P>
   The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced at a
meeting in Atlanta this week that the death rate from AIDS in the
United States, which had dropped a startling 42 percent from 1996
to 1997, fell only 20 percent from 1997 to 1998. That was still a
substantial decline but also a worrisome indication that further
declines may be harder to achieve. Data from New York City suggest
that the death rate for the first half of 1999 will be the same as
in the first half of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves prevention as the best tool for curing the epidemic.
But health experts report that the rate of HIV infection has
leveled off at 40,000 new cases a year, a disturbing indication
that prevention programs have stalled, especially in reaching
minorities and young gay men. The death rate and incidence of AIDS
among African-Americans is 10 times higher than among whites, and
infection rates are soaring in some groups of gay males. It is an
ironic twist that the very success of the new drug cocktails in
warding off death from AIDS has bred complacency in some Americans
who are returning to risky sexual behaviors.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: NOW IT'S THE PRESIDENT'S TURN TO GAZE
ADORINGLY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELEANOR RANDOLPH   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's campaign for Senate this
week displayed what may be an unexpected new hazard _ her husband.
The problem is not any new question of ethics or morality or bad
taste threatening on the horizon. It is simply that President
Clinton can play a political crowd the way Van Cliburn plays a
piano. As the first couple proved this week, no matter how well she
campaigns with her spouse, she is still a political prodigy sharing
the stage with a maestro.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody at the White House apparently recognized this
possibility months ago. In the first stages of his wife's possible
campaign for Senate, Clinton not only receded into the background,
as much as a president of the United States can recede. He even
went to an Indian reservation out West while she made her first
public moves on New York's Senate seat now held by Daniel Patrick
Moynihan, who is retiring. Alone or with Moynihan, Mrs. Clinton has
been moving cautiously into the contest. In her ``listening tour''
of the state, the first lady adapted the public skills she learned
over the years as a political wife _ nodding and smiling and
avoiding thorny issues as she worked the campaign circuits.
</P>
<P>
   When the president comes along, as he has in recent days, it is
clear that he still needs lessons in accompanying a new lead
singer. At the state fair in Syracuse on Monday, the first state
political outing that included the entire first family, both
Clintons spoke to a crowd that was about as soft as a Democrat
could find in upstate New York. Comptroller Carl McCall, who had
gathered 500 supporters for a traditional political lunch,
demonstrated the gentleness of his audience when he told the same
wan joke two times and the crowd laughed loudly, twice. Thus when
Mrs. Clinton got up to speak, she performed adequately and earned a
solid round of applause.
</P>
<P>
   Then her husband sauntered to the microphone. Before the
president even got behind the lectern, the crowd started chuckling
and settling in for the show. ``You know, it's pretty nice to go to
a lunch like this when you know you're the only one who's not
running for anything,'' he joked, with an ease that suddenly made
his wife's performance sound brittle by comparison.
</P>
<P>
   It may have been my imagination, listening to the Arkansas
president in New York's upstate briar patch, but the accent seemed
to thicken as he talked, and the voice suddenly took on just a
touch of Merle Haggard. Sure, he thanked everyone and praised
everyone and talked about big issues that concern a president of
the United States, like taxes. But the nub of that brief speech,
the parts that crowd will remember, touched on earlier days at
other state fairs.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton trotted out stories and little routines that had the
kind of yarn-spinner's polish that comes only with years of
practice. He confessed at one point to a group of ardent fairgoers,
``I never met a fair I didn't like.'' When he was being greeted
like a superstar by people who said later they wanted his wife to
go back to Arkansas, he admitted that he was enjoying himself
handsomely. ``I've done this all my life,'' he said with a touch of
nostalgia.
</P>
<P>
   The question, of course, is how the first lady repackages her
husband as political spouse. In the expected contest with New
York's mayor, Rudolph Giuliani, she would draw decent enough crowds
as a famous first lady. But having along a president, even one who
does not have many fans left in upstate New York, draws even bigger
crowds. The pomp and the trappings stir a conservative Republican
community like Skaneateles into hanging bunting from every building
on Main Street. The restaurateur who has a baloney sandwich named
after Mrs. Clinton has been chastised in The Skaneateles Press for
not being respectful to the nation's chief of state and his Mrs.
</P>
<P>
   The nettlesome question of the president's role in her campaign
is probably being answered at this very moment by adroit pollsters
working phones in the Syracuse area for the first lady. Did she
lose your vote when she held his hand? Did you like the sound of
the helicopters? In the meantime, the president will probably have
to teach his wife how to carry off some of his best and oldest
lines, or he will have to wave from the stage, stare at her
adoringly and stay away from the microphone.

EDITORIAL: THE MARCH AND THE CONSTITUTION 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (See also NY-MARCH)  (mk) 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Sept. 1:
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. District Court in New York ruled properly Tuesday that
the city's attempt to prevent the so-called Million Youth March
violated the constitutional right to free speech. Instead of
appealing to a higher court, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani needs to issue
the necessary permits and concentrate on making this a safe and
orderly gathering. To escalate the public statements and the legal
battle would only inflame racial tensions _ and provide the
archbigot Khallid Abdul Muhammad with free publicity and a wider
audience.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle over the rally is shaping up as a repeat of last
year, when the city denied permits and was overruled in court. The
2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals set parameters for last year's
event, allowing the marchers to assemble for four hours over a
distance of six blocks along Malcolm X Boulevard, a space large
enough to accommodate many times the 6,000 people who actually
showed up.
</P>
<P>
   Although accounts vary, the event last year might have concluded
on a calmer note if police had not rushed the stage and had a
helicopter swoop down over the crowd just as the rally was supposed
to end. District Court Judge Denny Chin chided police for their
aggressiveness at last year's event, describing the use of the
helicopter as ``excessive.'' In ruling that this year's rally could
go on, but without a parade to the site, the judge acknowledged
that Muhammad's comments about Jews and whites were ``hateful,
violent and frightening.'' But he held that a society where free
speech could be curtailed ``on the basis of administrative whim''
was at least as frightening as Muhammad's bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani wants to prove that he remains a tough enforcer of the
law as he heads into his run for the Senate. Also, it is
understandable that many citizens might want the mayor to shut down
a rally that is apt to be filled with racist venom. But New York
City has a powerful tradition of tolerance for free speech, even
when it is hateful. By hyping this march beyond its importance
Giuliani will only increase the turnout. The best approach is to
starve Muhammad of public attention, cover the march with an
adequate but restrained police presence and let his ``movement,''
such as it is, collapse of its own spiritual emptiness.

CLINTONS APPEAR SET TO BUY HOUSE IN CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By LISA W. FODERARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WHITE PLAINS, N.Y. _ President Clinton and Hillary Rodham
Clinton appeared Tuesday to be in the final stages of negotiating
to buy a house in Westchester County, a rambling Dutch Colonial in
the picturesque village of Chappaqua.
</P>
<P>
   The Westchester Multiple Listing Service, a computerized roster
that gives the status of properties for sale, indicated Tuesday
that the house, at 15 Old House Lane, was under contract, according
to a broker not involved in the deal. But it did not suggest who
the intended purchaser was.
</P>
<P>
   The real-estate broker who has worked with the Clintons on their
house search, Kathy Sloane of Brown Harris Stevens in Manhattan,
said Tuesday night that she had no information that a deal had been
finalized.
</P>
<P>
   But the Clintons, stopping off last Saturday in Westchester
between visits to Martha's Vineyard and the Hamptons on Long
Island, N.Y., saw only one house, the 110-year-old one in
Chappaqua, and they spent a leisurely two hours inside. And people
who have followed the first couple's real-estate quest said they
were very close to working out an agreement to buy the 11-room
house, which was listed for $1,695,000.
</P>
<P>
   Typically, home buyers will sign a contract with a number of
conditions, such as their qualifying for a mortgage. If there are
still conditions in the Clintons' case, security could well be one
of them, and rumors swirled Tuesday that the first couple was also
trying to purchase an adjacent piece of land so the Secret Service
could provide better security.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton, who is widely expected to run for the Senate from
New York, has been looking at houses in Westchester for weeks. Last
month, she was joined by President Clinton and their daughter,
Chelsea, on a tour that took them from Pound Ridge, in the
pristine, semi-rural northern part of the county, to New Rochelle
in the more congested south.
</P>
<P>
   The house in Chappaqua would place the Clintons in the county's
dead center, giving them speedy access to Westchester County
Airport and a relatively quick commute to the city. Situated in the
town of New Castle, Chappaqua is known for its beautiful old
houses, its gently rolling landscape and its school district,
considered one of the top two or three public districts in
Westchester.
</P>
<P>
   But Chappaqua is just south of Westchester's horse country,
where movie stars and industrialists have sought privacy in recent
years on giant estates in towns like Bedford and Pound Ridge.
Chappaqua is certainly wealthy and prestigious, but it is more
squarely suburban in spirit, with many two-career couples making
the commute into Manhattan on Metro North.
</P>
<P>
   If Mrs. Clinton decides to run for the Senate, she has to
establish a New York residence.
</P>
<P>
   The other houses the Clintons had looked at had larger
properties, ranging from two to seven acres. This house has just
1.1 acres, a fact that may account for speculation about their
efforts to purchase adjacent land. ``The only thing that shocks me
about the whole deal is that it's one acre,'' observed one broker.
</P>
<P>
   The 5,200-square-foot house has appealing historic details, like
fat white columns on the ground floor, French windows and
traditional gambrel roof lines. It sits on a quiet cul-de-sac,
shielded from view by fir and maple trees, and has a master bedroom
with a wrap-around deck that overlooks a pool and wooded back yard.

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Jose Bruin and Tommy Trojan meet for a preseason
lunch on neutral ground in Hollywood, where a talking bear and a
guy in a skirt can get a table without much fuss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you hurt yourself?'' Tommy says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hurt myself? Oh, you refer to my cane,'' Jose says. ``It's
nothing serious.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Comes in handy when you park in those blue spaces, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   A testy silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look here,'' says Tommy, who sounds a bit like John Wayne,
``the reason I invited you _''
</P>
<P>
   ``What do you mean, you invited me?'' Jose growls. ``(begin
ital)I(end ital) invited (begin ital)you(end ital)!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well let's not argue about trivialities. I was thinking it
would be nice if we sat down and ironed out our differences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought the same thing. We really should get along better
than we have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're neighbors, after all.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Civilized folk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And we share a noble objective.''
</P>
<P>
   ``To educate and mold young people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Especially young people who run a 4.5-second 40.''
</P>
<P>
   ``So why should we fight?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Why indeed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you're a quiche-eating socialist?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just because you're Daddy's Little Rich Boy?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's not dwell on petty differences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not when, more than ever, our football programs should feel
sympathetic toward each other, not antagonistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My sentiments exactly!''
</P>
<P>
   ``I mean, this year, nobody can tell the Bruins and Trojans
apart. It's as if there's been a role-reversal or something.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right,'' Tommy says. ``Everybody got used to UCLA having the
hotshot quarterbacks and SC settling for anybody with two arms. But
now we're the ones with the strapping young quarterback who's on
the cover of all the preview magazines, and you guys had to choose
a starter from Drew Bennett, Cory Paus and the ballboy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't remind me,'' Jose says quietly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know how it feels, my excessively hairy friend.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell me, what (begin ital)was(end ital) the Reggie Perry era
like, anyway?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Reggie Perry is the reason I sympathize with you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's as if our offensive teams have traded places. Your
Trojans are talking about mixing it up, piling up the points. My
Bruins are talking about keeping it simple, not confusing the
passer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Here's another switch. Remember how bad our defense was last
year? Well, now the coach is actually talking about the linebackers
being a strength of the team! Meanwhile, your Trojans played
defense like a brick wall last year, and this year the coach
actually used the word `turmoil' to describe the situation there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Good thing we don't have to play Miami, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Miami is the reason (begin ital)I(end ital) sympathize with
(begin ital)you(end ital).''
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys really took a beating in the press over that game,
didn't you? It was like us in the old days when we were on top, the
expectations that used to follow us around. If SC didn't go
undefeated, there was an investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Times sure have changed. I heard one of your players
predicting SC would beat us this year. He said he wanted to try to
get a rivalry going! It sounded like us in the old days _ we had to
remind people there are two teams in town.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're really a smart guy, you know that?'' Tommy says with
mock admiration. ``Almost made me forget it's USC that was just
chosen as `College of the Year' by the Time-Princeton Review, not
UCLA.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I read that somewhere,'' Jose says. ``That's either a
colossal turnabout or a typographical error. Anyway, that's the
kind of thing I'm talking about when I say it's hard to tell the
Bruins from the Trojans anymore. I mean, USC is suddenly a vaunted
academic institution...''
</P>
<P>
   ``While UCLA's football players get hauled off to court. I sure
do know how bad that feels. By the way, I hear they're changing the
handicapped parking placards from blue and white to blue and
gold.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cute. I hear O.J.'s going back to campus to coach the golf
team.''
</P>
<P>
   An uncomfortable silence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm glad we got together like this. It reminded me how much I
really detest you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Just one more thing we have in common.'' &QL;

JETS' CORNERS: DIMINUTIVE AND DOGGED  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Minn.)   By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Once upon a time in Texas, Ray Mickens and
Aaron Glenn had a dream: that they would both be playing in the
National Football League. ``I never imagined, though, being on the
same team with Aaron,'' Mickens said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nor could most people _ especially Jets Coach Bill Parcells.
It's the height thing. Glenn is 5 feet 9 inches tall, Mickens is 5
feet 8 inches tall. The Jets measured him in college early in the
morning, when people are taller.
</P>
<P>
   Each will be giving away at least a half foot in height against
the Vikings' receivers they face Friday night in the final
preseason game. But they will not be as challenged when the regular
season starts. Only one receiver on the Jets' first two East
Division opponents _ Andre Reed of the Bills _ is taller than 6
feet 1 inch.
</P>
<P>
   Mickens and Glenn will start the season against the Patriots on
Sept. 12. Glenn, a Pro Bowl selection last season, will be at left
cornerback, and Mickens will be on the right side, playing for Otis
Smith, who is recuperating from a broken collarbone. It will be
their first time starting a regular-season game together since
1996. Before then, it was during their Texas A&AMP;M days.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're friends, but there's a competitive side between us,''
Mickens said. ``You always feel you're going to be the best.
Aaron's on top now, and I want to be better than him. We try to
outdo the other.''
</P>
<P>
   They have teamed up for every exhibition game following Smith's
injury. It has allowed each to study the other's technique up
close, and to kid about it.
</P>
<P>
   But Friday promises to be their most stringent test of the
preseason schedule, and perhaps their most difficult assignment of
the year. The Vikings' primary receivers are tall: Randy Moss is 6
feet 4 inches, Cris Carter is 6 feet 3 inches and Jake Reed is 6
feet 3 inches.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether there had been a height issue with Glenn and
Mickens playing together, Parcells replied: ``Not right now. But
we're getting ready to see it.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They have effective jumpers,'' Parcells said of the Viking
receivers. ``Particularly Moss.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet, Mickens and Glenn can reach heights of their own. They have
to be outstanding athletes to have been so effective.
</P>
<P>
   They met as Aggies when Glenn was a senior in 1993, and Mickens
was a freshman. The next year, the Jets made Glenn a first-round
pick. Then in 1996, Mickens was drafted on the third round. They
played the first 10 games of the season in tandem before Mickens
was sidelined with an injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``This game is going to help us,'' Mickens said. ``With the
quality they have, we're getting ready for them like a
regular-season game.''
</P>
<P>
   For Glenn, there will be a reunion of sorts with Carter. When
they last met in 1997, Parcells instructed Glenn to be physical.
Glenn and Carter shoved each other throughout the game. After one
incident, Parcells had to pull Glenn away. Carter snared six passes
for 105 yards, but the Jets won the game.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was heated,'' Glenn said. ``But that's football. I was
trying to play him the way coach wanted me to play him, just try to
match being physical with him. They're all physical players when
they're big, so you can't help but be physical.''
</P>
<P>
   How will Glenn play defense? ``Play basketball; block out,
that's basically it,'' he said. ``The only thing you can do is just
try to jump with those guys. When the ball is in the air, you've
got to make sure you know where he is. When he jumps for the ball,
you've got to make sure you try to jump with him. Don't try to jump
for interceptions all the time. Just knock the ball down.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you try to jump for interceptions all the time, they're
going to be over the top of you and just grab the ball. So
basically you want to play the ball and knock it down.''
</P>
<P>
   Both Glenn and Mickens benefit from playing almost daily against
the 6-foot-3-inch Keyshawn Johnson. Johnson has had particular
success against Mickens, whom he has practiced against more often.
</P>
<P>
   But Glenn faces Johnson enough in practice to get something out
of it, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I am playing Keyshawn, especially on a deep ball, I don't
go for the interception every time, especially if I'm not in the
right position,'' Glenn said. ``If I have a step on him and the
ball's thrown deep and I'm in front of him, maybe I can go for the
ball then. But when the ball is up in the air for either one of us
to get it, I'm not playing for the interception. I'm playing to get
the ball down.''
</P>
<P>
   To Steve Atwater, the free safety who can speak from the
comforting height of 6 feet 3 inches, there is no mystery about
height in pro football. ``When you're a good cornerback,'' Atwater
said, ``you've got to face guys that are tall, guys that are
short.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   The Jets trimmed their roster to 65 players. The final cut to 53
is next Sunday. . . . The latest to go was tight end Lawrence Hart,
who said he was not ready to play because of an eye injury, while
Jets medical advisers said he could play. . . . Linebacker Marvin
Jones did not practice because of a sprained ankle. Coach Bill
Parcells said that Jones had started to play at a high level after
his yearlong recovery from knee surgery. &QL;

GIULIANI THE JUROR HEARS FIRST DAY OF TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
  (smw) 
 By JODI WILGOREN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There have been celebrity litigants and there have
been celebrity lawyers. Now there is a juror who brings his own
security team to court and stops to shake hands with voters _ er,
courthouse employees.
</P>
<P>
   You can tell something is different looking over the shoulders
of the artists in Courtroom 341. The instantly recognizable face of
Juror No. 1 sits at the centerpiece of their sketches rather than
fading into the background where the no-name jurors normally
belong.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a somewhat unusual case, and we're not going to hide
that,'' Justice Elliot Wilk of state Supreme Court told Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani and his fellow jurors as the case of Johnson vs.
Riverton opened Tuesday morning. ``This case is important to the
plaintiff, this case is important to the defense, irrespective of
who sits as jurors, irrespective of who sits in the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Unusual indeed.
</P>
<P>
   As they waited in the assembly room for the trial to start, many
jurors were flipping through the morning's newspapers. But only
juror No. 1 was reading about himself, starting with an article in
The New York Times about the city's quest to quash a youth march in
Harlem. The mayor was soon exchanging backslaps with Howard Bell, a
judicial hearing officer, as they recalled their contacts back when
Giuliani was a federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The testimony only made the situation more surreal. It turns out
that Oliver Johnson, the plaintiff, has worked on and off as a
security guard in several nightclubs, including the Tunnel, a
notorious spot that juror No. 1 has been trying to shut down.
Johnson's wife, Larene, is a social worker for the Health and
Hospitals Corp. _ a city agency that, of course, has close ties to
juror No. 1.
</P>
<P>
   And so it went, as the most personal of personal-injury cases
became as public as public gets.
</P>
<P>
   The Johnsons are suing Riverton Associates, their former
landlord in East Harlem, claiming that a sudden change in water
temperature four years ago while Oliver Johnson was in the shower
resulted in severe burns and the destruction of their marriage.
</P>
<P>
   The nature of the case might make any juror blush, but the media
circus that followed the first New York City mayor ever picked for
a jury did not help. In the morning, Johnson testified that, at
first, he was too embarrassed to tell even his wife about his
injury, and that when several months of applying ointment to his
wounds did not heal them, he shunned further treatment, partly
because he did not want to reveal himself to more doctors.
</P>
<P>
   During the testimony, Giuliani sat quietly. As juror No. 1, he
was just a few yards from the witnesses, and frequently made eye
contact as Johnson told his tale of sexual dysfunction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I woke up the next morning, I was horrified to look down,''
Johnson, 45, recalled of the incident on Feb. 16, 1995. ``My penis
was blistered and swollen. It was oozing and it was very painful.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Johnson, 46, whose claim against Riverton is for loss of
marital ``services,'' said that the injury stole the man she
married in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Riverton's lawyer, James Miller, implied that the injuries were
not very severe and repeatedly questioned the Johnsons about why
further medical attention had not been sought. Miller also attacked
the Johnsons' credibility, suggesting that they had pent-up
animosity toward the landlord after having been evicted because
they owed more than $13,000 in back rent.
</P>
<P>
   Giuliani, the only juror in a suit and tie, showed no reaction
during the testimony, but offered several of his trademark ticks,
holding his chin in his hand, removing and replacing his glasses,
crossing his arms tight across his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Heeding the judge's orders not to discuss the case, the mayor
declined to comment as he descended the courthouse steps. Earlier,
he said he thought that serving on a jury would be a ``fascinating
experience.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried many cases in court, and I listened to many people
come up with the most inventive excuses for getting out of jury
duty,'' Giuliani said. ``It always offended me because it seemed to
me that jury duty is one of the few things that you are asked to do
in exchange for living in a democracy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope it is a message to people,'' the mayor added, ``that
this is something they should look forward to.''

IDT TO OFFER LONG-DISTANCE CALLS FOR 5 CENTS PER MINUTE 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Undercutting the telecommunications giants, IDT Corp. plans to
begin offering domestic long-distance calls Wednesday for 5 cents a
minute at any time with a flat monthly fee of $3.95.
</P>
<P>
   For the last month, the three titans of the $80 billion
long-distance industry _ AT&AMP;T Corp., MCI Worldcom Inc. and Sprint
Corp. _ have been embroiled in a price war. On Monday, AT&AMP;T
responded to new offers from MCI Worldcom and Sprint by announcing
that it would offer consumers domestic long-distance calls for 7
cents a minute in addition to a $5.95 monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   IDT, which is based in Hackensack, N.J., is a mere fraction of
the size of the other companies, but it is nonetheless prepared to
offer lower rates to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're making it clear that we're the low-price provider in the
industry,'' Howard S. Jonas, the chairman of the company, said
Tuesday. ``We think everybody else is playing games with a nickel a
minute at night, but if you take that it's a quarter during the
day, or 7 cents a minute all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Sprint kicked off the latest round of price cuts last month with
a plan that offers 5-cent calls only between 7 p.m. and midnight
and a 10-cent rate at other times. That plan carries a monthly
charge of $5.95.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks later, MCI Worldcom created a new calling plan that
offers 5-cent calling on weekends and from 7 p.m. to 7 a.m. during
the week. But that plan charges 25 cents a minute during weekdays
and carries a $1.95 monthly fee.
</P>
<P>
   IDT's new offer appears cheaper than anything offered to
consumers by AT&AMP;T, MCI Worldcom or Sprint. Qwest Communications
International Inc. offers a flat-rate 5-cent plan, but that deal
carries a $9.95 monthly fee and must be charged to a credit card
rather than a standard phone bill.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the 5-cent plan, IDT intends to offer a flat
long-distance rate of 3.5 cents to consumers who also sign up for
the company's Internet service, which costs $14.95 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Jonas said there might not be much profit in selling consumers
domestic long-distance calls for 5 cents a minute, but he said
overseas calling opportunities made the new deal worthwhile.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not really much to be made at a nickel, but we believe
that a significant portion of the people who sign up will make
international calls,'' Jonas said. ``There a nice profit margin to
be made there.''

COLEMAN MAKES A SPLASH WITHOUT `SWIMMING'
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Early in training camp, when the UCLA coaches
issued a ``no swimming'' edict, no one was happier than defensive
end Kenyon Coleman. Although he loves to swim, Coleman knew it
wasn't in his best interest.
</P>
<P>
   The proclamation had nothing to do with swimming pools or
swimming laps. It concerned Coleman's use of a standard
pass-rushing technique called ``the swim,'' in which the rusher
lifts his arm over a blocker in a freestyle-stroke motion.
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's problem was leverage. He's 6-foot-6 and 280 pounds.
Each time he tried the swim, which requires a vertical stance, he
became an easy target for blockers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there's one thing we've stressed besides conditioning, it's
playing with leverage,'' defensive end coach John Pearce said. ``In
the past, Kenyon has not played with leverage. He has made himself
too easy to block. He's got to use his size and strength to his
advantage, and to do that he's got to stay low.''
</P>
<P>
   Judging by Coleman's training-camp performance _ he was nearly
unblockable _ the swimming policy has worked as designed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's playing great; I hope he plays the games like he's
practicing,'' Bruins coach Bob Toledo said. ``I told Kenyon this
has got to be his coming-out year. The junior year is really
important.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman's refined technique is but one aspect of his
transformation. He has a renewed spirituality thanks to Athletes in
Action. He's playing with unprecedented passion, in part to amend
last year's defensive collapse. He also has lofty personal goals
that include a possible jump to the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``My parents have left it up to me,'' he said of entering the
NFL draft. ``They know I'll make the right decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The convergence of mind and physique has produced the player
UCLA envisioned when it signed Coleman in 1997: an All-Pacific-10
talent who plays with consistency and aggression.
</P>
<P>
   ``Last year, if it was in the third quarter and I didn't have
any sacks, I'd say, `How am I going to get some sacks?' '' Coleman
said. ``Now, I'm mature enough to know that if I work hard in
practice, the sacks will come. I feel like the pressure's off.''
</P>
<P>
   And if it's off Coleman, it's probably on his opponent.
</P>
<P>
   Farmer update: Receiver Danny Farmer removed the protective boot
Tuesday and jogged lightly on his sprained left ankle, but he
remains doubtful.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not ready to make a decision,'' Toledo said. ``It didn't
appear he was really ready at this point. We're going to keep
playing it day-to-day. We might wait until game time.''
</P>
<P>
   Ready for action: Because of injuries and suspensions on the
offensive line, the Bruins have abandoned hope of redshirting true
freshman tackle Bryce Bohlander. He'll play Saturday, and for the
rest of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Bohlander is just the second rookie offensive lineman to play
for UCLA since Jonathan Ogden in 1992. The other: right tackle
Brian Polak in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't want to, but we're forced to,'' Toledo said. ``If we
lose one more guy, (Bohlander) was going to have to play anyway,
and chances are we will.''
</P>
<P>
   Under the lights: The Bruins will hold a rare evening practice
tonight to prepare for Saturday's 6 p.m. kickoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to get used to playing under the lights,'' Toledo
said.

 SEEKING A LOST CONTINENT A BIT WEST OF THE HUDSON 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By GLENN COLLINS  
 
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service  
<TEXT>

</P>
<P>
   TOWN OF RAMAPO, N.Y. _ About a billion years ago, or so the
prevailing geological theory has it, the Earth's continental plates
collided, pushing up mountains the height of the Himalayas and
creating a supercontinent geologists call Rodinia.
</P>
<P>
   In time, the breakup of Rodinia created a lost ocean, Iapetus,
that was itself destroyed when the continents collided and formed
yet another supercontinent, Pangaea.
</P>
<P>
   By and by _ and, since we're talking geological time here, by
and by and by _ Pangaea split up, creating not only North America,
Europe and Africa, but also the Atlantic Ocean. Finally, then,
erosion and the burden of mile-high glaciers flattened much of the
landscape, including the swatch of drive-through topography we now
know as metropolitan New York.
</P>
<P>
   These days, Dr. Alexander Gates, a professor of geology at
Rutgers University in Newark, N.J., is navigating that landscape,
rock hammer in hand. Ranging the forests of New York's Harriman
State Park in Rockland and Orange counties, scribbling observations
in his leather-bound field notebook, he is, by his own description,
``looking to piece together the Rodinian story.''
</P>
<P>
   For the last three years, Gates and his research team have been
mapping the tortured history of one of the last vast, geologically
pristine places in the region _ taking an inventory of significant
rock types, features and geological faults, photographing them and
collecting rock samples.
</P>
<P>
   Their ambition is not only to compile the most detailed picture
of the geological history of Harriman and its region, but also to
look for clues that will unravel important mysteries in the story
of the earth's lost supercontinents, which had a history of violent
assembly and reassembly as dizzying as the slam-dance of bumper
cars in an amusement park.
</P>
<P>
   On the urbanized, suburbanized, exurbanized face of it, New York
and environs might not seem to be the most fertile geological
ground. Lately, according to Gates, the region ``has been neglected
by geologists.'' But, he added, the basement rock of the
metropolitan area is actually some of the most complex in the
United States. in terms of the dazzling variety of rocks, their
spectacular deformation by wind, water, ice and volcanic fire, and
their intricate, baffling, Rubik's Cube construction.
</P>
<P>
   And when it comes to studying that local geology, Harriman is
the place to be. Across the region, development has obscured most
of what geologists refer to as ``exposures.'' Harriman, though,
``is pretty much the way it was left, after the glacier retreated''
12,000 years ago, said Dr. Yngvar Isachsen, principal scientist for
the Geological Survey of the New York State Museum in Albany. ``In
geology, it doesn't get much better than that,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Already, Gates said, the project has yielded new revelations
about the formation of the ancient continent of Rodinia, including
at least one ``Rosetta Stone,'' a Harriman rock outcrop that
provides significant information on the supercontinent's formation.
</P>
<P>
   The research could have some very practical applications as
well. As seismologists study the origins of the recent earthquake
in Turkey, they are calling for intensified research to gauge the
likelihood of future seismic events in the metropolitan area.
Though the region is often characterized as dormant, geologists say
it presents the potential for earthquake hazard.
</P>
<P>
   And at a time when Harriman had to close its hiking trails until
last Friday because of the drought, Gates' work ``can be very
helpful to us,'' said Carol Ash, executive director of the
Palisades Interstate Park Commission, which administers 100,000
acres of forest in New York and New Jersey, including Harriman.
``We hope that Dr. Gates' study of fissures in the rock will give
us a greater understanding of the park's ground-water system, and
help us to manage it better.''
</P>
<P>
   Some scientists say this focus on New York's geology is long
overdue. Geologists ``paid a lot of attention to the New York
region at the turn of the century, especially when the city's water
tunnels were being built,'' said Leonardo Seeber, a research
scientist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia
University in Palisades, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the region became ``unfashionable,'' Seeber said. High
mountains, active volcanoes, petroleum reserves and pure-science
research drew many academics elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other areas are trendier, and they get better funding,''
Isachsen said. These days, thanks to budget cuts, the Geological
Survey cannot even afford to assign a geological specialist to the
New York metropolitan area.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As they carry out their project, Gates and his team are also
studying and reinterpreting the observations of generations of
geologists who toiled before the era of plate tectonics, the
evolving theory that, since the 1960s, has viewed the earth's rock
record in the context of the interaction of the earth's continental
plates. The metropolitan area ``has always been where the action
is,'' said Gates, but now, he noted, geologists can finally make
sense of what all that action meant.
</P>
<P>
   These days, though, the metropolitan region is also ``important
from the standpoint of seismological hazard,'' Seeber of
Lamont-Doherty said.
</P>
<P>
   New York is currently designated a ``stable continental
region,'' Seeber explained. But while geologists have an aversion
to unduly alarming the populace, New York, they say, is in its
inactivity similar to the area east of Bombay, India, where an
earthquake of magnitude 6.3 on the Richter scale killed 10,000
people in 1993. ``That region was also determined to be
low-hazard,'' Seeber said. ``It clearly demonstrates that we know
little about how earthquakes in these areas are generated.''
</P>
<P>
   New York, New Jersey and Connecticut are riddled with ancient
geological faults. As recently as 1884, a magnitude 5.0 earthquake
is believed to have had its epicenter just outside New York Harbor,
breaking crockery, ringing church bells and toppling chimneys from
Connecticut to Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
   That temblor was the same size as the recent earthquake on the
San Andreas fault near San Francisco. ``If you put that bull's-eye
right under Manhattan,'' Seeber said, ``the effect could have been
much greater,'' causing loss of life and substantial damage, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Gates, who is 42 years old and grew up in Rockland County, hopes
his team's labors will lead to the creation of an unspoiled
geological park at Harriman _ a 75,000-acre outdoor laboratory that
will show how a wilderness park can be packaged as a geological and
environmental educational tool for scholars, teachers, students and
the general public.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Gates says, the project is expected to generate
museum exhibits and educational programming for a variety of
institutions, including the American Museum of Natural History in
Manhattan and the Liberty Science Center in Jersey City, N.J. The
project is financed by $43,000 in start-up money from the National
Science Foundation, and the institutions have asked the foundation
for additional financing.
</P>
<P>
   Gates and the sponsoring institutions also hope to create a
library and Web site of materials that would guide visitors to
significant geological features on the walking trails of the
metropolitan region. A test version of the Web site is up and
running at http://geology2.rutgers.edu/harriman2/index.htm.
</P>
<P>
   On a recent morning, Gates led a visitor to a grayish, weathered
outcrop on Seven Lakes Drive opposite Lake Tiorati. Previously
undocumented by geologists, the rock exposure provides new evidence
that the Rodinian supercontinent was assembled by a series of
continental collisions over time. The outcrop has preserved the
record of a rising plume of molten rock from deep in the earth's
crust as it scorched the older rock above it. But that rock had
itself already been tortured by a prior collision between
continental plates.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, Gates concluded, the rock exposure provides important
new evidence in a primordial detective story: it shows that there
were at least two ancient collisions in the formation of the
supercontinent Rodinia.
</P>
<P>
   Gates pointed to the outcrop and smiled. ``I think of this as
the Rosetta Stone,'' he said, happily.

BOEING PACT, IF APPROVED, WILL HAVE FAR-REACHING EFFECT IN

<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Boeing's choice of compromise over conflict in its
attempt to win approval of its largest labor contract will embolden
unions within the company, across the nation and at rival Airbus
Industrie, according to labor analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Machinists union will vote Wednesday on a
contract hammered out early Saturday when the company dropped
demands for a longer workweek and higher payments for health care,
while offering competitive raises and a 10 percent bonus. The deal
was designed, in part, to keep production lines open at the
Seattle-based aerospace company.
</P>
<P>
   But the contract with members of the International Association
of Machinists will have a broader impact. The company's concessions
will encourage other unions to make similar demands when they
hammer out future agreements, according to labor scholars. That's
because the Boeing contract, which covers 44,000 workers, serves as
a bellwether for the industrial labor movement, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a large sense it really energizes the labor movement,''
said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the
University of California at Berkeley. The union ``won gains in the
areas of wages, pensions and job security (and) these are all hotly
contested questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor movement takes some of its cues from Boeing because
the issues the company and the union fought over mirror battles
occurring throughout the U.S. manufacturing and aerospace
industries.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Boeing backed away from its demand that Machinists
should pay a portion of their health care premiums in the future.
That move will bolster organized labor's opposition to similar
corporate demands, according to Richard Bank, the director of the
Center for Collective Bargaining at the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company abandoned its push for a seven-day
workweek that would run 24 hours a day, an initiative other
companies are weighing. Throughout the negotiations the union
argued the idea would disrupt the family lives of its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you are going to see more and more unions...are going
to draw the line on quality of life issues,'' said Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also may find their workers are seeking bigger
bonuses. Boeing offered its Machinists lump-sum payments in 1999
that will average $4,400 for each worker covered by the contract.
</P>
<P>
   That ``creates expectations in other sectors, that (you have)
got to have a bonus system in place,'' said David Olson, a
political science professor at the University of Washington in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The contract offer also threatens to reach across the Atlantic
to Boeing's rival Airbus Industrie. That's because workers at the
Toulouse, France-based airplane consortium are likely watching the
negotiations, said Olson. Since Boeing workers are perceived to
have won some concessions from their boss, Airbus employees
probably are expecting a boost in their next contract, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus officials rejected the idea that contracts at Boeing and
Airbus are linked.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, ``I don't think there has been much correlation
between Boeing contracts and Airbus contracts,'' said David Venz,
chief spokesman in North America for Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus would stand to reap potentially huge benefits if Boeing
couldn't settle the contract and its Machinists struck. A strike
would hurt Boeing while it's locked in an intense bidding war with
Airbus for new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big losers are Airbus'' stakeholders, said Olson.
</P>
<P>
   The contract also will ripple through other collective
bargaining units at Boeing, raising expectations for workers.
Officials at the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees
Association, who will negotiate a contract for 24,000 Boeing
workers this fall, say they're already heartened by Boeing's offer
to Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials caution that the company's latest offer won't
dictate the terms of other agreements, even though it will serve as
a reference point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be looked at (but) it doesn't automatically translate
into a rubber stamp everywhere,'' said Peter Conte, the chief
spokesman for Boeing during the contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing hasn't eliminated its biggest labor headache yet.
Machinists will travel to their union halls in Seattle, Everett,
Auburn, Renton, Spokane, Portland, Ore., and Wichita, Kan.,
Wednesday to vote to either ratify or reject the contract.
</P>
<P>
   If they reject the proposal, and two-thirds of those voting
support a strike, they could be on the picket lines Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Many Machinists, however, have welcomed the offer, including the
competitive wage package, the absence of new health care bills and
the preservation of the traditional workweek. The response has left
union leaders optimistic about the outcome of Wednesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel they will ratify what may be one of the best contracts
in the aerospace industry,'' said Bill Johnson, the president of
the International Association of Machinists' District Lodge 751 in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some workers are upset, saying the package doesn't offer
a big enough jump in pension benefits and falls short in other
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and the union will know the fate of their agreement at
roughly 9 Wedneday night, when the union plans to announce the
results of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   If workers ratify the contract it will represent another step
toward improving the often turbulent relationship between Boeing
and its most potent union, the Machinists. The union has struck
during two of the last three labor negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it ... indicates the importance to companies like
Boeing that maintaining harmonious labor relationships is important
over the long'' term, said Robert Scott, an international economist
at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Local companies should also take note if Boeing and its largest
union strike a compromise Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very hot labor market and labor exercised
considerable strength,'' said the University of Washington's Olson.
``Other firms similarly situated not only have to take labor
negotiations seriously, they have to learn from past mistakes.''

TO PROFESSORS' DISMAY, RATINGS BY STUDENTS GO ONLINE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Calif., Va., Ill., Ark.)   By IAN ZACK   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   John Moriarty, a 21-year-old business major at the University of
Texas, was eager to enroll in a marketing course whose ``syllabus
sounded really intriguing.''
</P>
<P>
   But first, like many collegians, he sat down at his computer,
logged on to the Internet and availed himself of a new online
resource: course evaluations written anonymously by other students.
</P>
<P>
   The critiques, in the style of brief movie reviews, said the
professor in question was distant, his research outdated and his
lectures uninspiring. If the mini-commentaries were not blunt
enough, the numerical ratings were, hovering around 2 on a scale of
1 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought, `Oh, boy, that's probably not a good course to
take,''' Moriarty recalled.
</P>
<P>
   So it goes at colleges across the country. As students sign up
for fall classes, they are turning the tables on the teachers who
have long held sway over their grade point averages and job
prospects. Emboldened by the communal power and the democratic
ethos of cyberspace, they are heading to Web sites where they can
lambaste professors they deem poor, sing the praises of those they
like and scout out courses before adding them to their schedules.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these sites are ``official,'' maintained by the college
itself. Others are run by student organizations or even individual
students. In at least one case, computer access to course
evaluations has become a commercial venture.
</P>
<P>
   Many professors are uneasy about the trend, fearing that the
evaluations will be used as retribution by bad students or, as one
faculty member put it, become like ``Nielsen ratings for higher
education.'' Some worry, too, that universities will begin using
them when deciding on raises and promotions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Faculty are suspicious of numerical evaluations because they
reflect popularity and enthusiasm of delivery more than they
reflect the knowledge of the professor or the professor's high
academic standards,'' said Mark Goor, a special-education professor
at George Mason University in Fairfax, Va., where a course
evaluation Web site went up this spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Typically faculty with high standards will get low evaluations
because students get angry at them,'' Goor added, in a criticism
common among faculties.
</P>
<P>
   Actually there is nothing much new in themselves about student
course evaluations. For decades, students have filled out their
official course evaluation forms with a No. 2 pencil on the final
day of the semester. In most cases, though, these are seen only by
the professor and the administration, which uses them to assess its
faculty and provide the members some feedback.
</P>
<P>
   But some universities, like George Mason and Northwestern, now
have their own official rating Web sites. Elsewhere, unofficial
sites run by students have sprung up, fed by reviews from anonymous
classmates.
</P>
<P>
   What makes professors especially uneasy is that although some of
the Web sites can be viewed only by those using their university's
server, the critiques' presence on the Internet typically makes
them accessible to a vast public. The reviewer reaching that vast
public could well be a disgruntled student eager to even the score
for some real or imagined slight. In fact, since the reviewer is
anonymous, it may be that he has not even taken the course he is
pillorying.
</P>
<P>
   George Mason has one of the more polite sites, created by the
provost's office at the insistence of student leaders. It provides
only numerical ratings, on a professor's course preparation,
grading fairness and motivation, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Students at Virginia Tech, on the other hand, created their own
Web site last year after failing to persuade administrators to
release official course evaluations. That site offers student
commentaries on hundreds of courses. It also lists grade
distributions, so that students can determine in advance how many
A's, B's and F's a particular professor is likely to give. The
students who maintain the site buy the grade statistics from the
university for several hundred dollars a year.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the reviewers at the Virginia Tech site pull few
punches. Of a biology class, for instance, one student wrote,
``Break out the coffee and Vivarin 'cause this one can bore a tick
off a dog.'' Another student said of a computer science professor:
``He constantly scolds and attempts to verbally intimidate
students. He constantly rambles on and on about his supposed
expertise, however it was never availed to the class.''
</P>
<P>
   Students who read such reviews say they typically take them with
a grain of salt, and there are a fair share of positive, even
stellar, reviews as well.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kathy K. Franklin, an assistant professor of higher
education at the University of Arkansas at Little Rock, says the
``student as consumer'' approach underlying the critiques may paint
a false picture of what is happening of value in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers typically will not tell a retailer, `Gee, you did a
good job today,'''Franklin said. ``But let the least little thing
go wrong, and they'll tell you in a heartbeat. If evaluations are
negative and broadcast publicly, then you'll have faculty who will
never do anything creative again.''
</P>
<P>
   Franklin, who studies student attitudes toward college, also
noted that popular teachers were not always the best teachers, or
the ones with the most lasting impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``Education is not a joy ride,'' she said. ``It is not a thrill
park experience.''
</P>
<P>
   Some professors have even raised the prospect that evaluations
that seem to amount to personal attacks might be deemed libel, and
in fact Web site creators have sought legal advice before going
online. In one case, professors at the City College of San
Francisco threatened, but did not file, a suit against students who
had created a course evaluation site, according to the Student
Press Law Center, a Washington group that advises student media
organizations on legal matters.
</P>
<P>
   In any event, at least one Web start-up company is banking that
students' opinions about their professors will prove lucrative.
That company, Collegestudent.com (www.collegestudent.com), began as
a housing database at the University of Texas but now provides all
manner of student-related services, including course evaluations,
which are one of its most popular features. The Web site claims
some 260,000 active members at 400 American colleges, though
participation varies greatly by institution.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see students being more empowered,'' said Griffin Davis, the
company's vice president for marketing, ``and I see the Internet as
being one of the tools that help students make choices about how
they spend their money.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis said that the company's editors deleted what appeared to
be personal attacks and that professors could always respond online
to criticism; it would be up to them to learn of that criticism and
then take the initiative by getting in touch with the company.
</P>
<P>
   As for students, they typically have little sympathy for
professors who think evaluations should remain private.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they're just going to have to deal with it,'' said
Eric Sas, the 21-year-old student government president at George
Mason. ``I think it's here to stay.''

TOP-TIER FIRMS ON WALL STREET ARE MERGER SHY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Though many investors think it is just a matter of
time before America's big securities houses hook up with banks,
Wall Street firms are proving to be reluctant merger partners.
</P>
<P>
   Take Morgan Stanley Dean Witter, which has the largest market
value of any Wall Street firm. Its top executives recently debated
and dismissed a merger offer from Chase Manhattan Bank, people told
of the talks said, making it the second time in a year that the
firm decided against teaming up with Chase.
</P>
<P>
   A combination of Morgan Stanley's securities and merger advisory
business with Chase's corporate loan expertise would have proved
formidable _ it would have become the largest financial services
firm in the world. But fears of a culture clash, and the challenge
of the Internet, prompted Morgan Stanley to reject the overture,
the people said.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is the latest setback for Chase and its top
executives, Walter Shipley and William Harrison. Shipley, Chase's
chairman, has been courting Morgan Stanley, Merrill Lynch and
Goldman Sachs for more than a year. Harrison, who was appointed
chief executive last spring, has made fresh approaches to Wall
Street firms in recent months, so far without success, people told
of the talks said.
</P>
<P>
   Spokespeople for Morgan Stanley and Chase declined to say
whether such talks occurred, citing policies against commenting on
market speculation.
</P>
<P>
   Some stock analysts still expect that Merrill, Morgan Stanley or
Goldman will end up merging with a bank. The main reason is that as
Depression-era laws that once kept banks and securities firms off
each other's turf fall away, bankers are having an easier time
trespassing on securities firms' territory than the reverse, some
analysts say.
</P>
<P>
   Chase may also succeed in finding a partner. Market speculation
recently had Chase talking again with Merrill, though a person
involved in Chase's strategic planning said he believes that Chase
preferred Morgan Stanley and was disappointed by the failure to
reach an agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Chase, Citigroup, Bank of America and other big banks are
threatening the long-standing dominance of Wall Street firms in
some corners of investment banking. Chase and Bank of America, for
example, dominate the syndicated loan business. Some analysts see
such lending as the most important single financial product that
banks or investment banks can provide to corporate clients these
days, suggesting that Chase could decide to expand its investment
banking franchise without a merger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chase is using its leadership in syndicated loans to get more
investment banking business and deepen its relationship with
corporations,'' said Ruchi Madan, a bank analyst at Paine Webber.
``The brokerage firms do not have that expertise, and the
competitive pressures are building.'' By her estimates, syndicated
bank loans account for about half of all funds raised by American
companies, a proportion that has risen sharply in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Chase also signaled that it was prepared to live without
acquiring a Wall Street firm when it hired Neal Garonzik, who had
headed Morgan Stanley's stock division, as a vice-chairman with a
mandate to build the bank's equity business. People at Chase say
Garonzik believes that the firm can use its lending relationships
with corporate clients to build its own full-service investment
bank.
</P>
<P>
   The bank's path to building a vibrant securities business is
unlikely to be smooth, however. The bank announced internally
Tuesday the resignation of George Brown, founder and chief
executive officer of its brokerage unit, Brown &AMP; Co. Brown was
quoted as saying that he disagreed with the strategy the bank was
pursuing for the brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   People told about the Morgan Stanley-Chase talks said that
executives on both sides felt the combination made strategic sense.
Price was not a major obstacle, nor was leadership. Morgan Stanley
executives expected that Shipley and Harrison would cede key
management positions to them, the people said.
</P>
<P>
   The problem was culture. Though America's biggest banks have
become more streamlined and competitive in recent years, many Wall
Street veterans still believe that they are more bureaucratic and
less nimble than investment banks.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley, which merged with Dean Witter two years ago,
also worried about the difficulty of tackling another large merger
now. Philip Purcell, Morgan Stanley's current chairman and chief
executive and the former top boss at Dean Witter, and John Mack, a
Morgan Stanley veteran who is president of the combined entity,
clashed last year when Mack was seeking to be made a coequal and
was rebuffed, people at Morgan Stanley say. The two have a better
working relationship now than they did a year ago, but are said to
be reluctant to take on a fresh challenge like merging with Chase.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were reasons that a merger would have been a home run,''
said one person who was told of the merger discussions. ``But in
the end they worried about culture.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another problem was the Internet. Purcell has spent much of his
time in recent weeks plotting how Morgan Stanley, which operates
the online Discover Brokerage separately from its traditional
retail brokerage network, can offer discounted online trading to
all its retail clients without undercutting the commissions and
fees its brokers generate. The firm is scurrying to come up with a
plan to match Merrill, which has announced that it will begin to
offer low-priced online trading to all its retail customers by
year's end.
</P>
<P>
   Morgan Stanley is eager to capture the enthusiasm investors have
for rivals that do more business through the Internet. Shares of
Charles Schwab, the leading online brokerage firm, trade at 65
times earnings, compared to roughly 14 times for Morgan Stanley and
Merrill Lynch and 16 times for Chase. That's even after a downturn
in Schwab's share price this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Morgan Stanley and other Wall Street firms
acknowledge that without a bank as a partner they face some
pressing problems. They are also-rans in the huge syndicated loan
business, in which banks extend loans to companies and then sell
all or part of them to investors. Moreover, the Wall Street firms
have much less capital than banks to make loans. That lending is
especially vital during periods in which the stock and bond markets
are rocky, when it's harder for companies to sell securities.
</P>
<P>
   People close to Merrill and Morgan Stanley say the two
securities firms are exploring ways of increasing the capital they
have on hand to make loans. They hope that the remaining
legislative obstacles to bank-brokerage combinations will disappear
by early next year, allowing them to buy a small- or medium-sized
bank themselves, an option some people at the two firms consider
preferable to merging with a giant like Chase.

FORESTED LAND IN THE EMERALD CITY IS DROPPING DRAMATICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KRISTIN DIZON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Emerald City? Not according to a new study, which
suggests Seattle's nickname should be downgraded to a less
brilliant shade of green.
</P>
<P>
   What residents have noticed for years _ that the number of trees
are declining _ has been confirmed in an analysis by American
Forests, which bills itself as the oldest conservation group in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   And according to the city's own forestry experts, many of the
urban trees that remain are in poor health.
</P>
<P>
   Using a combination of digital satellite images, aerial
photography, Geographical Information Systems mapping and ground
surveys, the group said their analysis shows the amount of forested
land in the city is dropping dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, 10 percent of the city's land area was heavily treed.
By 1996, the amount of forested land comprised just 5 percent of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of treed land has had an economic impact, according to
the 20,000-member group. Seattle's tree loss has resulted in an
estimated additional 11.5 million cubic feet of stormwater runoff
during a peak storm. The cost of containing and managing that
runoff is a minimum of $23 million, the group says.
</P>
<P>
   The lost tree canopy also would have removed 159,000 pounds of
air pollutants from the atmosphere each year.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in Seattle this week, American Forests also called for a
nationwide initiative to combat sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Its message is simple: Plant more trees, maintain existing ones
and uproot fewer trees.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's tree shortage is not unique. According to American
Forests' survey of other urban areas, cities across the nation have
lost about one-third of their canopy in the last quarter century,
much of it to suburban sprawl and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trees are very important to the quality of life of a
community,'' said Deborah Gangloff, executive director of American
Forests.
</P>
<P>
   She and others extolled the many benefits of trees, including
soaking up harmful gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect,
decreasing surface erosion, providing shade cover and keeping a
city's average temperature lower. The conference kicked off a round
of tree-planting fervor. King County Executive Ron Sims is expected
to announce Wednesday that the county is creating a public-private
initiative to plant 200,000 trees next year along the Interstate 90
Mountain to Sound Greenway.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Eddie Bauer employees planted trees in the shadow of
the Space Needle at the Seattle Center. For the last three years,
the Seattle-based clothing company has supported American Forests'
Global ReLeaf program, which aims to plant 20 million trees around
the world by next year. The company encourages donations of $1 or
more from customers and so far has raised enough money to plant 2.5
million trees.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Seattle has set its own goals for tree planting.
Mayor Paul Schell has called for planting 20,000 trees by Earth Day
2000. So far, about one-quarter of that has been planted. The
effort is expected to cost $2 million, with half the money coming
from private donations and corporate support.
</P>
<P>
   The last major tree spree in Seattle came in the early 1970s
when the ambitious voter-funded public works program Forward Thrust
led to a wave of plantings, said Shane Dewald, city landscape
architect.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Seattle's tall, leafy canopy dates back decades.
During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps
planted trees across the city, said Paul West, the city's senior
urban forester.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to know for sure, but the city estimates that on
land it controls, there are more than 1.4 million trees.
</P>
<P>
   The various tree planting campaigns come at a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an aging urban forest,'' West said. ``Right now we're
losing a lot of trees that were planted at the turn of the
century.''
</P>
<P>
   While West said the average life span of a tree in a harsh urban
environment is just 10 years, many of Seattle's declining trees are
between 75 and 100 years old.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the city's concerted effort to thicken the
urban forest canopy includes free trees for residents to plant
along street rights of way and discounts for anyone wishing to
plant a tree from participating nurseries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really hope people call and tell us where the trees are
needed, because we've got them,'' said Duane Pentilla, the city's
park horticulturalist.

BOEING PACT, IF APPROVED, WILL HAVE FAR-REACHING EFFECT IN
INDUSTRY, LABOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Boeing's choice of compromise over conflict in its
attempt to win approval of its largest labor contract will embolden
unions within the company, across the nation and at rival Airbus
Industrie, according to labor analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Machinists union will vote Wednesday on a
contract hammered out early Saturday when the company dropped
demands for a longer workweek and higher payments for health care,
while offering competitive raises and a 10 percent bonus. The deal
was designed, in part, to keep production lines open at the
Seattle-based aerospace company.
</P>
<P>
   But the contract with members of the International Association
of Machinists will have a broader impact. The company's concessions
will encourage other unions to make similar demands when they
hammer out future agreements, according to labor scholars. That's
because the Boeing contract, which covers 44,000 workers, serves as
a bellwether for the industrial labor movement, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a large sense it really energizes the labor movement,''
said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the
University of California at Berkeley. The union ``won gains in the
areas of wages, pensions and job security (and) these are all hotly
contested questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor movement takes some of its cues from Boeing because
the issues the company and the union fought over mirror battles
occurring throughout the U.S. manufacturing and aerospace
industries.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Boeing backed away from its demand that Machinists
should pay a portion of their health care premiums in the future.
That move will bolster organized labor's opposition to similar
corporate demands, according to Richard Bank, the director of the
Center for Collective Bargaining at the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company abandoned its push for a seven-day
workweek that would run 24 hours a day, an initiative other
companies are weighing. Throughout the negotiations the union
argued the idea would disrupt the family lives of its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you are going to see more and more unions...are going
to draw the line on quality of life issues,'' said Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also may find their workers are seeking bigger
bonuses. Boeing offered its Machinists lump-sum payments in 1999
that will average $4,400 for each worker covered by the contract.
</P>
<P>
   That ``creates expectations in other sectors, that (you have)
got to have a bonus system in place,'' said David Olson, a
political science professor at the University of Washington in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The contract offer also threatens to reach across the Atlantic
to Boeing's rival Airbus Industrie. That's because workers at the
Toulouse, France-based airplane consortium are likely watching the
negotiations, said Olson. Since Boeing workers are perceived to
have won some concessions from their boss, Airbus employees
probably are expecting a boost in their next contract, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus officials rejected the idea that contracts at Boeing and
Airbus are linked.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, ``I don't think there has been much correlation
between Boeing contracts and Airbus contracts,'' said David Venz,
chief spokesman in North America for Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus would stand to reap potentially huge benefits if Boeing
couldn't settle the contract and its Machinists struck. A strike
would hurt Boeing while it's locked in an intense bidding war with
Airbus for new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big losers are Airbus'' stakeholders, said Olson.
</P>
<P>
   The contract also will ripple through other collective
bargaining units at Boeing, raising expectations for workers.
Officials at the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees
Association, who will negotiate a contract for 24,000 Boeing
workers this fall, say they're already heartened by Boeing's offer
to Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials caution that the company's latest offer won't
dictate the terms of other agreements, even though it will serve as
a reference point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be looked at (but) it doesn't automatically translate
into a rubber stamp everywhere,'' said Peter Conte, the chief
spokesman for Boeing during the contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing hasn't eliminated its biggest labor headache yet.
Machinists will travel to their union halls in Seattle, Everett,
Auburn, Renton, Spokane, Portland, Ore., and Wichita, Kan.,
Wednesday to vote to either ratify or reject the contract.
</P>
<P>
   If they reject the proposal, and two-thirds of those voting
support a strike, they could be on the picket lines Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Many Machinists, however, have welcomed the offer, including the
competitive wage package, the absence of new health care bills and
the preservation of the traditional workweek. The response has left
union leaders optimistic about the outcome of Wednesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel they will ratify what may be one of the best contracts
in the aerospace industry,'' said Bill Johnson, the president of
the International Association of Machinists' District Lodge 751 in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some workers are upset, saying the package doesn't offer
a big enough jump in pension benefits and falls short in other
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and the union will know the fate of their agreement at
roughly 9 Wedneday night, when the union plans to announce the
results of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   If workers ratify the contract it will represent another step
toward improving the often turbulent relationship between Boeing
and its most potent union, the Machinists. The union has struck
during two of the last three labor negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it ... indicates the importance to companies like
Boeing that maintaining harmonious labor relationships is important
over the long'' term, said Robert Scott, an international economist
at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Local companies should also take note if Boeing and its largest
union strike a compromise Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very hot labor market and labor exercised
considerable strength,'' said the University of Washington's Olson.
``Other firms similarly situated not only have to take labor
negotiations seriously, they have to learn from past mistakes.''

JOAN BRADEN, HOSTESS   TO CAPITAL'S OFFICIALDOM, DIES AT 77  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Md., Ind., Colo., Va., Calif., Taiwan)   By ERIC PACE    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Joan Braden, a former State Department official who was a
hostess and friend to high-ranking Washington figures and whose
eight children inspired the ABC television series ``Eight Is
Enough,'' died on Monday in Alexandria, Va. She was 77 and a
longtime resident of the Washington area.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was a heart attack, The Associated Press reported.
Mrs. Braden collapsed at Sutton Place Gourmet, a food store in
Alexandria, and was pronounced dead at a local hospital.
</P>
<P>
   For two years beginning in 1976, Mrs. Braden was the State
Department's coordinator of consumer affairs and special assistant
to the under secretary for economic affairs. She had also been an
aide to Nelson A. Rockefeller and had worked in political campaigns
for John and Robert Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The 1975 book ``Eight Is Enough,'' by her husband, Tom Braden,
tells of their family of eight children. In 1977 the book was
adapted as the ABC series, starring Dick Van Patten, which was
broadcast by the network until 1981.
</P>
<P>
   In the book, Braden, a columnist for the Los Angeles Times
Syndicate from 1968 to 1986, described his wife's personality:
``She's blithe. That's what it is about her, and that is why she is
so everlastingly cheerful.''
</P>
<P>
   By 1976, when Mrs. Braden took up her State Department posts,
her friends included Vice President Rockefeller, Secretary of State
Henry A. Kissinger and many other powerful figures who would
assemble at the Bradens' large yellow clapboard house in Chevy
Chase, Md., a Washington suburb.
</P>
<P>
   According to those who dined there, the food was simple but
good, and the furniture pleasant and necessarily childproof. There
were always flowers and candles and, if the weather was right, a
fireplace ablaze. But it was not those things that made Mrs.
Braden's dinner parties special, and her invitations a status
symbol.
</P>
<P>
   Rather, it was said in Washington, the main magnet was Mrs.
Braden herself, a slight woman (5 feet 5 inches tall, admittedly
too thin at 103 pounds) with short auburn hair and a wide smile _
blithe, as her husband said, and everlastingly cheerful.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Braden herself wrote a book, ``Just Enough Rope: An
Intimate Memoir'' (1989). Writing in The New York Times Book
Review, Maureen Dowd said, ``Joan Braden has taken a lot of heat
for this book, which has been criticized as a vapid kiss-and-sell
by a Washington society hostess with the capital's most notorious
`open' marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The title refers to the amount of freedom the author has
received from her husband,'' Ms. Dowd wrote. ``Washington insiders,
however, sniff that it also alludes to the fact that she has hanged
herself with this `intimate memoir.'''
</P>
<P>
   But ``this reviewer does not take such a harsh view,'' Ms. Dowd
continued, adding that, after all, how can a book be all bad that
features ``a shower scene with Nelson Rockefeller, a bedroom scene
with Bobby Kennedy, a toe-tingling lunch with Kirk Douglas and an
account of Frank Sinatra singing `High Hopes' without his toupee?''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Braden was born Joan Ridley in Indianapolis and was reared
in the nearby town of Anderson and in Washington. She received a
bachelor's degree in economics from Northwestern University and
worked in the Pentagon during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   From 1946 to 1951, she was an assistant to Rockefeller, who was
then in the middle of a succession of federal posts he filled
before becoming governor of New York in 1959. She went on to be a
special assistant for public relations to Oveta Culp Hobby, the
Eisenhower administration's secretary of health, education and
welfare.
</P>
<P>
   Later she and her husband moved to California, where Braden _
with the assistance of a $100,000 loan from Rockefeller, whom he
had known for years _ bought a small daily newspaper, The Oceanside
Blade-Tribune. Braden published the paper for more than 13 years
before selling it to South Coast Newspapers for $1.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Besides her husband, Mrs. Braden's survivors include five
daughters, Mary Poole of Alexandria, Joan Ridder of Denver, Susan
Zarker of Takoma Park, Md., and Nancy and Elizabeth Braden, both of
Denver; two sons, David, who lives in Taiwan, and Nicholas, of
Alexandria, and 12 grandchildren. One of the Bradens' sons, Tom,
died in 1994.

GARCIA'S STAR KEEPS RISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After most of the games he pitches _ and all of the
good ones _ Freddy Garcia calls his agent, Peter Greenberg, to tell
him how everything went. Monday night, after he beat the Chicago
White Sox to raise his record to 14-7, Garcia left this message on
Greenberg's voice mail:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell Omar I'm one up on him now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire are locked into baseball's
highest-profile duel. But Garcia and Omar Daal, an Arizona
Diamondbacks left-hander, are in a race of their own.
</P>
<P>
   With his 14th victory, Garcia pulled one ahead of Daal as the
two pursue Wilson Alvarez's single-season record for wins by a
Venezuelan pitcher. Alvarez, who now pitches for the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays, won 15 games for the White Sox in 1993 and '96.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up outside Caracas, Garcia knew of Alvarez but did not
idolize him. He related more to Roger Clemens, a power right-hander
like Garcia would become.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good, but he's a lefty,'' Garcia said of Alvarez. ``I'm a
right-hander, so I look at right-handed pitching. I like how
Clemens pitches, and I liked watching him pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia worked only 51/3 innings Monday, with manager Lou
Piniella removing him over concerns that Garcia's previous outing,
a 139-pitch shutout, had tired him. Garcia said he was not tired,
just missing with his location, and his numbers have stayed strong
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Since the All-Star break, Garcia has gone 5-2 with a 2.67 earned
run average. He has brought his season ERA down nearly a full run,
to 4.21, and is among the top 10 in the American League in wins,
opponents' average against (.256) and strikeouts (135).
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers should put him in the mix for the AL Rookie of the
Year award, with Texas pitcher Jeff Zimmerman and Kansas City
outfielder Carlos Beltran. With few pitchers distinguishing
themselves in the AL this year, Garcia could even merit
consideration for second- or third-place Cy Young votes if he
finishes strong.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will try to be cautious with Garcia in September,
but he has yet to reach his professional high in innings pitched.
Garcia threw 179 innings in Class A ball in 1997, then pitched
between 40 and 50 innings of winter ball in Venezuela. He will not
pitch winter ball after this season.
</P>
<P>
   He should stay busy, however; Garcia is expecting a warm
reception at home this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, but I have a feeling it's going to be
different,'' he said. ``I was playing in double-A and triple-A last
year, and now I'm in the majors all year. There's not many of us.''
</P>
<P>
   But his countrymen who are in the majors are doing well. In
addition to strong seasons by Garcia and Daal, Edgardo Alfonzo and
Roger Cedeno have stood out for the New York Mets and the
Philadelphia Phillies' Bobby Abreu is second in the National League
batting race.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg represents all of those players. Last winter, he and
Abreu turned down a four-year, $8.3 million contract offer that
would have bought out the outfielder's arbitration years. Because
of issues regarding service time, Garcia's case is somewhat
different, Greenberg said. The Mariners have not approached him
about a long-term deal _ they have several more pressing matters _
but something could happen this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if they want to do something long
term, with the year Freddy's having,'' Greenberg said. ``But it's
their call. If they want to do year-to-year (contracts), that's the
route we'll take. If they're interested in something multiyear,
we're certainly willing to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Garcia, ``I have to finish strong, and we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA BASES: Outfielder Charles Gipson and first baseman Mike
Blowers will be recalled from Class AAA Tacoma and join the M's
today. Several pitchers will be activated during the team's
upcoming homestand, including Brett Hinchliffe, Steve Sinclair and
Butch Henry. Outfielder Shane Monahan appears to be the only other
position player who may be called up. ... Center fielder Ken
Griffey Jr. held onto eighth place among outfielders in the latest
balloting results for baseball's All-Century Team. Griffey has
received 374,962 votes, the most of the eight active players on the
ballot. ... The Mariners are now the only team in baseball to hit
200 home runs in four consecutive seasons. They have 206 this
season, after collecting 245 in 1996, 264 in '97 and 234 last year.
Only three other clubs have ever hit 200 homers in any four
seasons.

50 CANDLES AND GRIPES FOR FASSEL TO PONDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (bl) 
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ The birthday cake was brought onto the
field as the New York Giants' practice was ending. The cake was
four feet long, a couple of feet wide, so big that it took two team
employees to carry it on a wooden folding table.
</P>
<P>
   A script of icing across the top of the cake in Giants blue
feted coach Jim Fassel, who turned 50 years old Tuesday. The cake
was in place by the time practice had ended, but Fassel did not see
it. He was too busy chewing out the very players who were about to
surprise him.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel stood with his back to the cake, his team in a semicircle
in front of him. The coach's post-practice address is usually no
more than a few seconds. Tuesday, it was a three- to four-minute
harangue.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel lectured his players, raising his voice as he gestured
with both hands. He pointed fingers as he turned from side to side,
his face getting redder as he scolded them for what he considered a
careless, lazy practice on the heels of a disappointing performance
Saturday against the New York Jets.
</P>
<P>
   When Fassel was finished, he turned to leave the field and still
had not acknowledged the cake's presence when defensive end Michael
Strahan gathered a group of teammates and called Fassel toward the
cake and table.
</P>
<P>
   ``You made it all the way to 50,'' Strahan said, laughing.
</P>
<P>
   Linebacker Jessie Armstead added, ``Man, that's old.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel cracked the thinnest of smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to pick the thing up and hit somebody in the
face,'' Fassel said, nodding his head at the cake.
</P>
<P>
   That drew laughter from his players, although they did not
linger around the cake or their coach. As they walked away, Fassel
asked: ``We're going to eat that in the locker room, right? OK,
thanks, guys.''
</P>
<P>
   The cake was taken inside Giants Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The situation was comic, and Fassel knew so. But he was not
distracted for long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not happy,'' he said. ``And it's not because I turned
50.''
</P>
<P>
   His players seemed to understand. No one was chuckling as the
cake was positioned behind Fassel's back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coach Fassel thought we weren't taking practice seriously
enough; you know maybe because we weren't in training camp
anymore,'' Armstead said. ``But just because camp is over, it
doesn't mean the work stops. He reminded us how much work we had
left to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel's post-practice message got through to several Giants,
especially when Fassel told reporters that he was looking at
personnel choices in a few areas, including free safety, where
Percy Ellsworth is the starter.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth has been the starter at free safety since the
preseason began. There was supposed to be a competition at the spot
with Shaun Williams, the team's 1998 first-round pick. But the
competition never materialized as Ellsworth took virtually all the
snaps with the first-string defense while Williams was with the
second-stringers.
</P>
<P>
   Ellsworth, however, did not have a good game against the Jets.
He was one of two Giants who missed an open-field opportunity to
tackle Curtis Martin near the beginning of his 80-yard touchdown
run.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel may simply be trying to motivate Ellsworth, whose
strength is pass coverage not run support, by threatening his job.
Or Fassel may be beginning to yield to the pressure to play a
first-round pick like Williams somewhere other than in nickel
packages.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel would say only that he needed better play from Ellsworth
and that he planned to give Williams ample playing time at free
safety in Friday's final preseason game against the Baltimore
Ravens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got some decisions to make,'' the coach said. ``And I'm
running out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Fassel said he was referring to the preseason schedule, not his
birthday.
</P>
<P>
   ``No, 50 isn't old,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ JESSIE ARMSTEAD responded to comments by KEYSHAWN JOHNSON, who
criticized Armstead in a published report Tuesday. Armstead was
involved in a scuffle with VINNY TESTAVERDE in Saturday's Jets
victory. ``Don't talk to the media about me; talk to me about me,''
Armstead said. ``You got something to say, be a man about it.''
</P>
<P>
   _ BRANDON SANDERS, waived by Cleveland last week, signed with
the Giants on Tuesday, vying for the fourth safety spot. He would
be used primarily as a special teams player.
</P>
<P>
   _ MICHAEL STRAHAN did not practice because of a slightly
strained groin muscle.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Giants continued to look for a long snapper on punts since
LANCE SCOTT, the long snapper for the last two years, has a torn
knee ligament. Tight end PETE MITCHELL is the player the team would
like to do the job _ and he probably will _ but the last time he
did regular duty as a long snapper was in college five years ago. &QL;

ANOTHER MAJOR INSURER PULLS OUT OF INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regence Blue Shield of Washington, precipitating a crisis in
health insurance for individuals in Washington state, on Wednesday
will stop offering new policies to people who aren't covered by a
group plan, the company said. The action leaves 25 counties in
Washington with no major private insurer willing to take on
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   And Group Health, the only insurer among major companies still
offering such coverage and under pressure to get out, will announce
on Wednesday whether it, too, will stop selling policies to
individuals. That would leave just eight Washington counties in
which individuals can buy insurance.
</P>
<P>
   State Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn responded by opening a
special ``high-risk pool,'' effective Wednesday, in counties with
no individual market. The premiums, however, are 50 percent above
the individual-market price.
</P>
<P>
   Regence's pullout follows the lead taken last November by
Premera Blue Cross, which was then the largest insurer in the
individual market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual market is broken,'' said Rich Nelson, Regence
chief executive. ``Regence Blue Shield can only participate in the
market if it is reformed to accommodate sound insurance principles
that we know will stabilize the market for members and carriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Regence will continue to serve its 65,000 customers with
individual health policies. But from now on it will sell insurance
only to people who are members of groups, such as the employees of
a company.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in insurance began in 1993 when the Legislature
passed insurance reform that required companies to sell policies to
all applicants _ sick or healthy _ at standard rates. The same
reforms also mandated that insurers cover pre-existing conditions
after only three months _ the shortest term in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms might have worked had the Legislature not repealed a
part of the law that required all individuals to have insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies complained that people would get sick, or
pregnant, and join a plan when they needed health care, then quit
when they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Regence was the largest remaining provider to the individual
market.
</P>
<P>
   The company made a profit of $13 million on $1.126 billion in
revenues last year. That's about a penny on the dollar. It has been
losing about $6 million a year on individual plans, despite
double-digit rate increases over the past several years. It expects
to lose $6.6 million this year even assuming a 28 percent rate
increase, which has been turned down by Commissioner Senn.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Vice President John Carlson said Regence is not pulling
out because Senn disallowed the rate increase. It still wants that
rate increase for existing customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's pulling out, he said, because of the prospect of a wave of
new applicants from the state's unsubsidized Basic Health Plan. The
state announced last week that the Basic Health Plan for the
non-poor would take no new applicants after Jan. 1, and that four
of the nine carriers (not including Regence) will drop their
existing enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Regence said, the seizure by the state of Kitsap
Physicians Service, which the state says may now be insolvent,
creates the potential that KPS's individual enrollees will flee to
Regence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already getting 1,700 applications a month,'' Carlson
said. ``When you've got a line of business that continually erodes
and erodes, you've got to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Scott, president of the only other major provider in the
market, Group Health, met with the cooperative's trustees on
Tuesday night, and is expected to announce Wednesday morning
whether the insurance carrier will continue to sell individual
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said Group Health should break even this year after being
in the red for the past two years. The individual plans have been
losing money.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Group Health, Regence's exit leaves only small
players in the individual market, including KPS in Kitsap, Mason
and Jefferson counties, Northwest Medical Bureau in Whatcom and
Skagit counties, and a handful of out-of-state companies selling
without fanfare. One of these is the Midwest National Life, whose
Bellevue, Wash., agent, Frank Miller, is still offering
non-managed-care coverage that includes maternity.
</P>
<P>
   These bit players, the remnants of a market that once included
more than 50 companies, don't show on the radar of the big players
or the state. Senn announced recently the opening of the Washington
State Health Insurance Pool to all individual applicants in 15
Eastern Washington counties, which she said had no individual
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   That order, to be effective Wednesday, immediately expands to 25
counties _ and maybe more, depending on what Group Health decides _
and effectively replaces the private market with coverage mandated
by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The pool she is opening is the old ``high-risk pool,''
subsidized by all carriers, which allows anyone rejected for
insurance to buy coverage (and non-managed care, at that) at 50
percent above normal rates. It has been dormant since the early
1990s because no one has been rejected for insurance. But Senn
decided that not having coverage for sale amounted to the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a reason to panic,'' said her chief deputy,
Robert Harkins. ``This is not about people losing coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Insurance people have been forecasting a death spiral in the
individual market since the reforms of 1993 and 1995, which ended
the companies' right to screen applicants and required coverage of
pre-existing conditions within three months.
</P>
<P>
   The result, they say, is that sick people signed up and healthy
people dropped out. ``It's like allowing someone to purchase fire
insurance when the flames are going through the roof of their
house,'' Carlson said. ``And that isn't fair to people who keep
coverage all year around.''
</P>
<P>
   To stem losses, carriers have cut back individual plans. The two
plans Regence is now closing do not cover childbirth, and cap drug
benefits at $500 a year. Group plans, which are much more difficult
to jump into when you need care and out of when you don't, offer
much richer benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Senn has defended the 1993 reforms as a way to let sick people
get coverage. She has argued that the insurance industry was
unnecessarily alarmist, and that the problems that did exist could
have been avoided if the 1993 reforms had put individuals and
groups into one pool.
</P>
<P>
   Senn met with top executives of Regence, Premera, Group Health
and three other companies Aug. 10, and said in a statement that
progress had been made. ``We're really confident that we can get
things done,'' said her deputy, Harkins, who added that timing of
Regence's announcement was unfortunate.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to seek ways to expand or open access, preserve the
principles of the 1993 reforms and give carriers enough
protection,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McCulloch, a past candidate for insurance commissioner and
one who had predicted a collapse of the individual market, said,
``The situation won't improve until the Legislature and the
insurance commissioner recognize reality.''
</P>
<P>
   Carriers have repeatedly gone to the Legislature and asked for
the 3-month rule to be changed. Last year they met with Gov. Gary
Locke and cut a deal that would have lengthened the three months
limit on pre-existing conditions and allowed for a limited
screening of applicants. Despite an intense lobbying effort by
Locke, the measure narrowly passed the Senate but died in the
House.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is precisely what we worried about last winter,'' said
Locke in a prepared statement. He said he hoped legislators,
insurers and consumers would ``come together to reach agreement on
a proposal to stabilize the individual market.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Eileen Cody, D-Seattle and co-chair of the House Health
Care Committee, said Regence's move might provide the critical mass
needed to pass a bill in the next session. ``We won't see the same
bill go forward, but we'll probably revisit some of the same
issues,'' she said.

ANOTHER MAJOR INSURER PULLS OUT OF INDIVIDUAL COVERAGE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRUCE RAMSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Regence Blue Shield of Washington, precipitating a crisis in
health insurance for individuals in Washington state, on Wednesday
will stop offering new policies to people who aren't covered by a
group plan, the company said. The action leaves 25 counties in
Washington with no major private insurer willing to take on
individuals.
</P>
<P>
   And Group Health, the only insurer among major companies still
offering such coverage and under pressure to get out, will announce
on Wednesday whether it, too, will stop selling policies to
individuals. That would leave just eight Washington counties in
which individuals can buy insurance.
</P>
<P>
   State Insurance Commissioner Deborah Senn responded by opening a
special ``high-risk pool,'' effective Wednesday, in counties with
no individual market. The premiums, however, are 50 percent above
the individual-market price.
</P>
<P>
   Regence's pullout follows the lead taken last November by
Premera Blue Cross, which was then the largest insurer in the
individual market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The individual market is broken,'' said Rich Nelson, Regence
chief executive. ``Regence Blue Shield can only participate in the
market if it is reformed to accommodate sound insurance principles
that we know will stabilize the market for members and carriers.''
</P>
<P>
   Regence will continue to serve its 65,000 customers with
individual health policies. But from now on it will sell insurance
only to people who are members of groups, such as the employees of
a company.
</P>
<P>
   The crisis in insurance began in 1993 when the Legislature
passed insurance reform that required companies to sell policies to
all applicants _ sick or healthy _ at standard rates. The same
reforms also mandated that insurers cover pre-existing conditions
after only three months _ the shortest term in the country.
</P>
<P>
   The reforms might have worked had the Legislature not repealed a
part of the law that required all individuals to have insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies complained that people would get sick, or
pregnant, and join a plan when they needed health care, then quit
when they didn't.
</P>
<P>
   Regence was the largest remaining provider to the individual
market.
</P>
<P>
   The company made a profit of $13 million on $1.126 billion in
revenues last year. That's about a penny on the dollar. It has been
losing about $6 million a year on individual plans, despite
double-digit rate increases over the past several years. It expects
to lose $6.6 million this year even assuming a 28 percent rate
increase, which has been turned down by Commissioner Senn.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Vice President John Carlson said Regence is not pulling
out because Senn disallowed the rate increase. It still wants that
rate increase for existing customers, he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's pulling out, he said, because of the prospect of a wave of
new applicants from the state's unsubsidized Basic Health Plan. The
state announced last week that the Basic Health Plan for the
non-poor would take no new applicants after Jan. 1, and that four
of the nine carriers (not including Regence) will drop their
existing enrollees.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, Regence said, the seizure by the state of Kitsap
Physicians Service, which the state says may now be insolvent,
creates the potential that KPS's individual enrollees will flee to
Regence.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're already getting 1,700 applications a month,'' Carlson
said. ``When you've got a line of business that continually erodes
and erodes, you've got to stop it.''
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Scott, president of the only other major provider in the
market, Group Health, met with the cooperative's trustees on
Tuesday night, and is expected to announce Wednesday morning
whether the insurance carrier will continue to sell individual
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Scott said Group Health should break even this year after being
in the red for the past two years. The individual plans have been
losing money.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from Group Health, Regence's exit leaves only small
players in the individual market, including KPS in Kitsap, Mason
and Jefferson counties, Northwest Medical Bureau in Whatcom and
Skagit counties, and a handful of out-of-state companies selling
without fanfare. One of these is the Midwest National Life, whose
Bellevue, Wash., agent, Frank Miller, is still offering
non-managed-care coverage that includes maternity.
</P>
<P>
   These bit players, the remnants of a market that once included
more than 50 companies, don't show on the radar of the big players
or the state. Senn announced recently the opening of the Washington
State Health Insurance Pool to all individual applicants in 15
Eastern Washington counties, which she said had no individual
coverage.
</P>
<P>
   That order, to be effective Wednesday, immediately expands to 25
counties _ and maybe more, depending on what Group Health decides _
and effectively replaces the private market with coverage mandated
by the state.
</P>
<P>
   The pool she is opening is the old ``high-risk pool,''
subsidized by all carriers, which allows anyone rejected for
insurance to buy coverage (and non-managed care, at that) at 50
percent above normal rates. It has been dormant since the early
1990s because no one has been rejected for insurance. But Senn
decided that not having coverage for sale amounted to the same
thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is not a reason to panic,'' said her chief deputy,
Robert Harkins. ``This is not about people losing coverage.''

GARCIA'S STAR KEEPS RISING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By TYLER KEPNER  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ After most of the games he pitches _ and all of the
good ones _ Freddy Garcia calls his agent, Peter Greenberg, to tell
him how everything went. Monday night, after he beat the Chicago
White Sox to raise his record to 14-7, Garcia left this message on
Greenberg's voice mail:
</P>
<P>
   ``Tell Omar I'm one up on him now.''
</P>
<P>
   Sammy Sosa and Mark McGwire are locked into baseball's
highest-profile duel. But Garcia and Omar Daal, an Arizona
Diamondbacks left-hander, are in a race of their own.
</P>
<P>
   With his 14th victory, Garcia pulled one ahead of Daal as the
two pursue Wilson Alvarez's single-season record for wins by a
Venezuelan pitcher. Alvarez, who now pitches for the Tampa Bay
Devil Rays, won 15 games for the White Sox in 1993 and '96.
</P>
<P>
   Growing up outside Caracas, Garcia knew of Alvarez but did not
idolize him. He related more to Roger Clemens, a power right-hander
like Garcia would become.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's good, but he's a lefty,'' Garcia said of Alvarez. ``I'm a
right-hander, so I look at right-handed pitching. I like how
Clemens pitches, and I liked watching him pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia worked only 51/3 innings Monday, with manager Lou
Piniella removing him over concerns that Garcia's previous outing,
a 139-pitch shutout, had tired him. Garcia said he was not tired,
just missing with his location, and his numbers have stayed strong
in the second half.
</P>
<P>
   Since the All-Star break, Garcia has gone 5-2 with a 2.67 earned
run average. He has brought his season ERA down nearly a full run,
to 4.21, and is among the top 10 in the American League in wins,
opponents' average against (.256) and strikeouts (135).
</P>
<P>
   Those numbers should put him in the mix for the AL Rookie of the
Year award, with Texas pitcher Jeff Zimmerman and Kansas City
outfielder Carlos Beltran. With few pitchers distinguishing
themselves in the AL this year, Garcia could even merit
consideration for second- or third-place Cy Young votes if he
finishes strong.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners will try to be cautious with Garcia in September,
but he has yet to reach his professional high in innings pitched.
Garcia threw 179 innings in Class A ball in 1997, then pitched
between 40 and 50 innings of winter ball in Venezuela. He will not
pitch winter ball after this season.
</P>
<P>
   He should stay busy, however; Garcia is expecting a warm
reception at home this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know, but I have a feeling it's going to be
different,'' he said. ``I was playing in double-A and triple-A last
year, and now I'm in the majors all year. There's not many of us.''
</P>
<P>
   But his countrymen who are in the majors are doing well. In
addition to strong seasons by Garcia and Daal, Edgardo Alfonzo and
Roger Cedeno have stood out for the New York Mets and the
Philadelphia Phillies' Bobby Abreu is second in the National League
batting race.
</P>
<P>
   Greenberg represents all of those players. Last winter, he and
Abreu turned down a four-year, $8.3 million contract offer that
would have bought out the outfielder's arbitration years. Because
of issues regarding service time, Garcia's case is somewhat
different, Greenberg said. The Mariners have not approached him
about a long-term deal _ they have several more pressing matters _
but something could happen this winter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't be surprised if they want to do something long
term, with the year Freddy's having,'' Greenberg said. ``But it's
their call. If they want to do year-to-year (contracts), that's the
route we'll take. If they're interested in something multiyear,
we're certainly willing to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Garcia, ``I have to finish strong, and we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA BASES: Outfielder Charles Gipson and first baseman Mike
Blowers will be recalled from Class AAA Tacoma and join the M's
today. Several pitchers will be activated during the team's
upcoming homestand, including Brett Hinchliffe, Steve Sinclair and
Butch Henry. Outfielder Shane Monahan appears to be the only other
position player who may be called up. ... Center fielder Ken
Griffey Jr. held onto eighth place among outfielders in the latest
balloting results for baseball's All-Century Team. Griffey has
received 374,962 votes, the most of the eight active players on the
ballot. ... The Mariners are now the only team in baseball to hit
200 home runs in four consecutive seasons. They have 206 this
season, after collecting 245 in 1996, 264 in '97 and 234 last year.
Only three other clubs have ever hit 200 homers in any four
seasons.

BOEING PACT, IF APPROVED, WILL HAVE FAR-REACHING EFFECT IN
INDUSTRY, LABOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAUL NYHAN  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Boeing's choice of compromise over conflict in its
attempt to win approval of its largest labor contract will embolden
unions within the company, across the nation and at rival Airbus
Industrie, according to labor analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the Machinists union will vote Wednesday on a
contract hammered out early Saturday when the company dropped
demands for a longer workweek and higher payments for health care,
while offering competitive raises and a 10 percent bonus. The deal
was designed, in part, to keep production lines open at the
Seattle-based aerospace company.
</P>
<P>
   But the contract with members of the International Association
of Machinists will have a broader impact. The company's concessions
will encourage other unions to make similar demands when they
hammer out future agreements, according to labor scholars. That's
because the Boeing contract, which covers 44,000 workers, serves as
a bellwether for the industrial labor movement, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a large sense it really energizes the labor movement,''
said Harley Shaiken, a professor of labor relations at the
University of California at Berkeley. The union ``won gains in the
areas of wages, pensions and job security (and) these are all hotly
contested questions.''
</P>
<P>
   The labor movement takes some of its cues from Boeing because
the issues the company and the union fought over mirror battles
occurring throughout the U.S. manufacturing and aerospace
industries.
</P>
<P>
   For example, Boeing backed away from its demand that Machinists
should pay a portion of their health care premiums in the future.
That move will bolster organized labor's opposition to similar
corporate demands, according to Richard Bank, the director of the
Center for Collective Bargaining at the AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company abandoned its push for a seven-day
workweek that would run 24 hours a day, an initiative other
companies are weighing. Throughout the negotiations the union
argued the idea would disrupt the family lives of its members.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think you are going to see more and more unions...are going
to draw the line on quality of life issues,'' said Bank.
</P>
<P>
   Companies also may find their workers are seeking bigger
bonuses. Boeing offered its Machinists lump-sum payments in 1999
that will average $4,400 for each worker covered by the contract.
</P>
<P>
   That ``creates expectations in other sectors, that (you have)
got to have a bonus system in place,'' said David Olson, a
political science professor at the University of Washington in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   The contract offer also threatens to reach across the Atlantic
to Boeing's rival Airbus Industrie. That's because workers at the
Toulouse, France-based airplane consortium are likely watching the
negotiations, said Olson. Since Boeing workers are perceived to
have won some concessions from their boss, Airbus employees
probably are expecting a boost in their next contract, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus officials rejected the idea that contracts at Boeing and
Airbus are linked.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, ``I don't think there has been much correlation
between Boeing contracts and Airbus contracts,'' said David Venz,
chief spokesman in North America for Airbus.
</P>
<P>
   Airbus would stand to reap potentially huge benefits if Boeing
couldn't settle the contract and its Machinists struck. A strike
would hurt Boeing while it's locked in an intense bidding war with
Airbus for new customers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big losers are Airbus'' stakeholders, said Olson.
</P>
<P>
   The contract also will ripple through other collective
bargaining units at Boeing, raising expectations for workers.
Officials at the Seattle Professional Engineering Employees
Association, who will negotiate a contract for 24,000 Boeing
workers this fall, say they're already heartened by Boeing's offer
to Machinists.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing officials caution that the company's latest offer won't
dictate the terms of other agreements, even though it will serve as
a reference point.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be looked at (but) it doesn't automatically translate
into a rubber stamp everywhere,'' said Peter Conte, the chief
spokesman for Boeing during the contract negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing hasn't eliminated its biggest labor headache yet.
Machinists will travel to their union halls in Seattle, Everett,
Auburn, Renton, Spokane, Portland, Ore., and Wichita, Kan.,
Wednesday to vote to either ratify or reject the contract.
</P>
<P>
   If they reject the proposal, and two-thirds of those voting
support a strike, they could be on the picket lines Friday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Many Machinists, however, have welcomed the offer, including the
competitive wage package, the absence of new health care bills and
the preservation of the traditional workweek. The response has left
union leaders optimistic about the outcome of Wednesday's vote.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel they will ratify what may be one of the best contracts
in the aerospace industry,'' said Bill Johnson, the president of
the International Association of Machinists' District Lodge 751 in
Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some workers are upset, saying the package doesn't offer
a big enough jump in pension benefits and falls short in other
areas.
</P>
<P>
   Boeing and the union will know the fate of their agreement at
roughly 9 Wedneday night, when the union plans to announce the
results of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   If workers ratify the contract it will represent another step
toward improving the often turbulent relationship between Boeing
and its most potent union, the Machinists. The union has struck
during two of the last three labor negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it ... indicates the importance to companies like
Boeing that maintaining harmonious labor relationships is important
over the long'' term, said Robert Scott, an international economist
at the Economic Policy Institute in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   Local companies should also take note if Boeing and its largest
union strike a compromise Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a very hot labor market and labor exercised
considerable strength,'' said the University of Washington's Olson.
``Other firms similarly situated not only have to take labor
negotiations seriously, they have to learn from past mistakes.''

HAWAII PUNTER BACK ON HIS FEET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Hawaii punter Chad Shrout dreaded going to
practice last season, knowing it was only a matter of time before
the screaming started.
</P>
<P>
   If the former Antelope Valley High star's punt didn't end up
exactly where former coach Fred vonAppen instructed Shrout to place
the ball, he heard about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You were guaranteed to get yelled at every day,'' Shrout said.
``If the kick didn't go to a certain spot, you got yelled at. It
put a lot of pressure on me.I didn't get used to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The stress showed on Shrout's punting statistics. In 1997, he
had the nation's fifth-best average (46.1 yards) and was named a
first-team All-WAC selection.
</P>
<P>
   But last season, Shrout's average fell to 38.7 yards per kick
while vonAppen tried to change his style to a more ``directional
philosophy,'' instead of just kicking the ball as far as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``It threw off my punting,'' Shrout said. ``I don't think I was
mentally prepared for that. I had a bad season.''
</P>
<P>
   It didn't help that Shrout was also forced to do Hawaii's
placekicking, something he had never tried in college. He made just
seven of 15 field goals.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was weird,'' Shrout said. ``It's faster, and a lot more
pressure than kicking in high school.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrout's problems from last season concern new Hawaii coach June
Jones enough that he said Tuesday he wanted to get his punter
``over the hump mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a high priority for Jones, because Shrout is one of the few
established players on a team that has lost 18 straight games
heading into Saturday night's game against USC at Aloha Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``He went through a very difficult season last year and he's one
of the guys we're trying to pull through,'' Jones said. ``We're
hoping he comes through. He has a big-time leg. I'm hoping he can
pull himself through the mental situation he was in last season.''
</P>
<P>
   If Jones knew what Shrout has been through the past three years,
he might not doubt the punter's resiliency.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago, on the eve of Hawaii's season opener against
Boston College, Shrout received word that his mother, Terry, had a
heart attack. Chad immediately boarded a plane back to Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Terry Shrout underwent triple bypass surgery, but died three
weeks later. Her loss left Chad, who was adopted, without any
parents.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the hardest thing I've had to face in my life,'' Shrout
said. ``I had to take care of the funeral arrangements. I had to
take care of a lot of business. I learned so much at the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrout decided to take the fall semester off in order to remain
close to his grandmother and 12-year-old brother, who was also
adopted.
</P>
<P>
   ``After something like that happens, the thought goes through my
mind. `Do I want to be that far from my brother and grandmother?'
'' Shrout said. ``I wanted to be with my family.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrout returned for the '97 season and had the best year of his
career. Through it all, his thoughts have never strayed far from
his mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``I keep her in my heart and mind all of the time,'' Shrout
said. ``I think of her all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Even during the toughest times under vonAppen, Shrout's memories
of his mother helped pull him through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to credit my mom,'' Shrout said. ``She taught me
everything I would need to know. She taught me how to be
responsible. How to be an adult.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrout is optimistic he can regain his '97 form, now that the
player-friendly Jones has been hired.
</P>
<P>
   ``The coaching change is absolutely fabulous,'' Shrout said.
``They teach football. They know what they are doing. The tempo is
higher, everyone is into practice. Everyone has taken to it. It's
just nice having a coach who can believe in us. These coaches are
bringing fun back into the game.''
</P>
<P>
   No matter what Shrout does this season, he will have surprised
some doubters. He did not have a single scholarship offer during
his senior season at Antelope Valley, when he got a random call
from Hawaii offering a plane ticket and campus visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my 48 hours in Hawaii, I loved every minute of it,'' Shrout
said. ``I hadn't had any other offers. It made the decision easy. I
don't have any idea what I would have done otherwise. I probably
would have gone to Antelope Valley College.''
</P>
<P>
   Shrout has certainly made a name for himself at Hawaii. USC
knows enough about him that he's actually become part of their
scouting package on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have a very good punter who's been there for four
years,'' USC coach Paul Hackett said. ``He won't get rattled or
intimidated.''

MARINERS SMOTHER WHITE SOX

<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO _ In the clubhouse before games, Alex Rodriguez wears a
T-shirt commemorating Mark McGwire's record 70 home runs last
season.
</P>
<P>
   Since he's in Chicago, he might want to shop for an Ernie Banks
shirt. It is Banks, the Chicago Cubs Hall of Famer, whose home run
record Rodriguez might break.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners shortstop clubbed his 34th and 35th home runs
Tuesday night as the Mariners buried the White Sox, 11-4, at
Comiskey Park. Raul Ibanez and Tom Lampkin also homered to support
John Halama, who worked seven innings for the win.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez finished August with 11 home runs. He hit 12 in July,
and leads the American League in home run ratio, going deep every
11.1 at-bats. The all-time record for home runs by a shortstop
belongs to Banks, who hit 47 in 1958. Despite missing 32 games to
an early season knee injury, Rodriguez is within reach of the
record.
</P>
<P>
   ``One thing I've learned in baseball is anything's possible,''
Rodriguez said. ``It would be incredible to do that in a season
when I missed six weeks. But I have other kinds of goals at this
point.''
</P>
<P>
   A win tonight would put the Mariners over .500 for the first
time since July 6, and would be their first step toward the goal of
making the playoffs. But if a run never develops, the home run
heroics will still be there _ and not just from Ken Griffey Jr.,
whose swing was recently voted the ``sweetest'' in baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``They did that thing on ESPN about the sweetest swing, and Alex
was the only right-handed hitter on that list,'' hitting coach
Jesse Barfield said. ``That says a lot. He has the best
right-handed swing I've seen in a long time. A left-hander can get
away with a slight uppercut, but with all the right-handed pitching
out there, right-handers have to have a level swing. Alex's swing
is picture perfect. That is a swing you want to teach kids right
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez homered to right and left field Tuesday night,
connecting off John Snyder the opposite way in the third inning to
give the M's a 3-2 lead, and taking Jaime Navarro into the
left-field bleachers in the sixth to put the Mariners ahead 9-4.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I've hit one like that in a long time,''
Rodriguez said of the second home run, which traveled 419 feet.
</P>
<P>
   The first homer gave Rodriguez and second baseman David Bell 50
for the season, making them the eighth middle-infield pair to reach
that mark. For all of Rodriguez's power, his all-around game stands
out most to Bell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hitting home runs is just one of the many things he does,''
Bell said. ``It's a big thing, but there are guys that are going to
hit as many home runs as Alex. But no one does everything as well
as Alex does. That's what impresses me most about him.''
</P>
<P>
   Also impressive: Rodriguez's two-homer night came at Comiskey,
where he owned a .176 average and just three home runs before
Tuesday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``History shows I haven't hit the long ball at this park, but
after playing at Safeco Field for a month and a half, I have no
complaints about playing anywhere,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The lead that resulted from his first home run did not last
long. The White Sox tied it at 3-3 in their half of the third on an
unusual two-out rally. After Darrin Jackson singled and Frank
Thomas walked, Halama (11-5) got Magglio Ordonez to hit a
comebacker. But the ball skipped lower than Halama expected, and it
ricocheted off his left heel for a single. Jackson, who homered in
the first, then scored on a wild pitch.
</P>
<P>
   That was the last time the M's had to worry. They knocked out
Snyder with a five-run barrage in the fourth, culminating in a
three-run homer to left by Ibanez. It was first baseman's fifth
homer of the year his first the opposite way.
</P>
<P>
   The M's did not take batting practice for the fifth day in a row
yesterday, but of those who did practice, Barfield said, Ibanez
stayed the longest, perfecting his stroke.
</P>
<P>
   ``He took a lot of extra swings,'' Barfield said. ``He wants to
maintain and keep the feel of everything he's been working on.''
</P>
<P>
   After suffering a miserable month and a half since the All-Star
break, Ibanez has homered in two of his past four games, and also
had a three-hit day. He has closed his stance more, and the results
showed on the homer.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you hit an opposite-field home run, at least for me, it
tells you that you're doing something right at the plate,'' Ibanez
said. ``You're staying in there and things are going to start going
well.''

GALAXY LIKES ITS CHANCES

 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA -- Now that the Galaxy has been eliminated from the
U.S. Open Cup and Las Vegas' CONCACAF Champions Cup, it can focus
on the one trophy that matters anyway -- the MLS championship.
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy (15-9, 39 points) blew a chance to share the Western
Conference lead with Colorado (16-8, 42 points) following
Saturday's 1-0 loss to Dallas, but it can share the conference lead
tonight with a three-point victory over San Jose (14-10, 22 points)
when the two teams meet at the Rose Bowl beginning at 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   A loss, and the Galaxy could find itself in fourth place before
the weekend is through, with Chicago and Dallas making a run at the
conference title as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're exactly where we wanted to be,'' said Galaxy coach Sigi
Schmid. ``Did I think we would be this close to them (Colorado) at
this point? Not really. When you look at it now, we've got 30
points in our last 13 games which is pretty good. Whenever you
average nearly 2{ points a game, you're doing pretty well.''
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. Cup loss to Columbus followed by a CONCACAF qualifying
loss to Necaxa earlier this month cleared up Los Angeles schedule.
If they were still alive in both, they would have had the U.S. Cup
championship scheduled for Sept. 14, followed by the CONCACAF
Champions Cup, held Sept. 28 through Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Eight teams, including Chicago and D.C. United are participating
in the Las Vegas tournament, which could mean three or four games
in a week span, just before the MLS playoffs begin.
</P>
<P>
   ``We would rather be in Vegas and participating in the U.S. Cup,
but now that we're not, it makes the MLS championship that much
more important to us,'' said Schmid. ``Chicago and D.C. are two
quality teams that will be there and maybe they will be distracted
with that competition. They will go through a series of a lot of
games in a few days. I think the plus side is that it gives us more
of a chance to focus and be in a position to make a better run at
this.''
</P>
<P>
   Midfielder Clint Mathis may return to action tonight -- three
weeks after injuring his left knee in a friendly with Guadalajara
Chivas, Aug. 4.
</P>
<P>
   Mathis had cartilage surgery two days after the injury and has
been training without a brace the past week.
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels normal,'' said Mathis. ``I just have to work on my
fitness. I have a little soreness after practice but that's
intended after surgery. I have no problem cutting or doing anything
unplanned. I've taken a couple hits, but it's no problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Mathis had started to emerge before his injury, becoming the
team's second leading scorer (seven goals, two assists, 16 points)
in 19 games. Four of those goals came in his last five games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've just worked extremely hard to get back because I can't
stand to sit here and watch,'' Mathis said. ``I love what I'm
doing, that's why I've busted my butt.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
CLASH-GALAXY
</P>
<P>
   Today's game: San Jose (14-10, 22 points) vs. Galaxy (15-9, 39
points), Rose Bowl, 7:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   TV/Radio: None; KTCD 1540-AM, KTNQ 1020-AM.
</P>
<P>
   Series: Galaxy leads 2-1 and 11-4 all-time.
</P>
<P>
   Galaxy update: The Western Conference playoff seeds are nearly
finalized with Colorado, Dallas, Chicago and the Galaxy fighting
for playoff positioning. All four teams are within four points of
each other, with Colorado (42 points) holding a slight edge over
Chicago (40 points), Los Angeles (39 points) and Dallas (38
points). Both Ezra Hendrickson and Clint Mathis, who missed
Saturday's 1-0 loss at Dallas because of injuries are probable
tonight. The Galaxy is hoping striker Cobi Jones starts to find the
net soon. With eight games remaining in the season, Jones has only
four goals compared to the 19 he scored a year ago. And last year
he missed over a month of the regular season because of the World
Cup in France.
</P>
<P>
   Clash update: San Jose's record (14-10) is deceiving because 10
of its 14 victories have come through the dreaded shootout. It has
left San Jose with only 22 points, 16 behind fourth place Dallas,
who also has 14 victories. San Jose would need a miracle to clinch
a playoff spot in its final eight games but they have shown
improvement with three consecutive victories to move four games
over .500 for the first time in club history. Striker Ronald
Cerritos leads the Clash, tallying 11 goals and five assists this
season.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Not many players suffer two season-ending injuries in the same
year. Then again, 1999 has been anything but normal for Astros
outfielder Moises Alou, who officially is out for the season after
his second freak injury in a seven-month period.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Alou's recovery from knee surgery was derailed over the weekend
when he fell off a bicycle and landed on his injured left knee.
Alou suffered swelling around his knee and had fluid drained from
the area.
</P>
<P>
   MRI results revealed no structural damage to the anterior
cruciate ligament, which was torn prior to spring training when
Alou fell off a treadmill. He underwent successful arthroscopic
surgery shortly thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, the Astros said Alou likely would be out for the
season after the treadmill incident. But as he progressed through
rehabilitation, Sept. 1 became a target date for his return.
</P>
<P>
   The timetable was amended to mid-September after the 33-year-old
outfielder suffered a setback while the Astros were in San Diego at
the end of July. This latest incident kills any hope of Alou's
playing in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been a tough couple of days,'' said Alou, who had 38
homers and 124 RBIs last season and finished third in National
League Most Valuable Player voting. ``I'm disappointed; my
teammates are disappointed; the fans are disappointed. It's very
frustrating to work this hard to come back and have it end this
way. I worked hard to come back, but unfortunately things didn't
work out.''
</P>
<P>
   The bicycle incident occurred when the bike Alou was riding
accidentally hit his 3-year-old son, Percio, who suffered a minor
bruise on his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately, my kid is OK,'' said Alou, who has a bruise on
his knee. ``Thank God for that. People are going to wonder why I
was riding a bike. But I have a family and kids who want to play
with their dad.''
</P>
<P>
   Riding a bicycle has been part of Alou's rehabilitation. He rode
for 10 miles with his therapist one week before the accident.
Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker was only recently made aware
of the bike-riding, and the activity didn't exactly come with his
full endorsement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Riding a bike is part of his rehab, but it was probably poor
judgment on his part,'' Hunsicker said. ``Mo's intentions were good
_ spending time with his family and playing with his kids. It's
tough to find time to spend with your family in this business. But
to get on a bike and horse around with the kids didn't show very
good judgment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros' outfield has been hit hard by injuries, with each
outfielder who started the season on the opening-day roster having
spent time on the disabled list at one point or another this
season.
</P>
<P>
   Alou was determined to return before the end of the season and
felt he still could make a contribution down the stretch and
possibly in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt like I was going to come back next week,'' Alou said.
``I didn't want to say anything to jinx myself, but I guess I was
jinxed in another way. I feel like I let everyone down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was supposed to be out for the year, but I told those guys I
was going to try my best to come back, and that's what I did. My
teammates understand, and I'm glad they're behind me, and I hope
the front office is behind me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Alou's teammates were more concerned about his well-being than
another in a long line of injuries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all feel bad for Mo,'' second baseman Craig Biggio said.
``The guy has been working his rear off to get back, and something
like this happens.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel worse for him than I do for the team.''

CONE PITCHES WELL, BUT THE A'S HIT BETTER 
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By JACK CURRY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   David Cone has admitted that the constant questions and doubts
about his right arm have bothered him, which means that the
questions and the doubts have really irritated him. Cone expects
the questions but lately he has felt like a lab rat. Poked and
prodded, dissected and discussed, Cone is the perfect-game pitcher
trying to validate himself all over again.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are destined to qualify for the post-season, and
they want and need Cone to be prepared. So they gave him six days
of rest before Tuesday night's start against the Athletics and
hoped that the stiffness and staleness that has infected his
performances over the past five weeks would finally vanish.
</P>
<P>
   For one night, they did. Using a sturdy fastball, a diving
slider and a nasty split-finger fastball, Cone pitched strongly
into the seventh inning as the A's eventually stopped the Yankees,
3-2, in 11 innings. Cone struck out 10 and was only damaged by a
two-pitch sequence in which he allowed back-to-back homers in the
fourth inning. Despite the aggravating defeat, the Yankees were
buoyed by Cone's revival.
</P>
<P>
   ``Undeniably, the rest certainly helped,'' Cone said. ``It's
like somebody plugged my arm back into the light socket. It's the
most life I have had in a while.''
</P>
<P>
   But, as much as Cone dominated Oakland, the very mortal Jimmy
Haynes also stymied the Yankees. Haynes had been battered for 32
earned runs in his last 16 and one-third innings while losing four
straight decisions, but he shocked the Yankees by merely
surrendering Paul O'Neill's two-run homer over seven innings. Doug
Jones followed with three shaky yet scoreless innings.
</P>
<P>
   That was why the A's managed to prevail on Rich Becker's
two-out, pinch-hit single off Ramiro Mendoza in the 11th. The
left-handed hitting Becker smacked a slow grounder between first
and second that allowed John Jaha to lumber in from second.
Becker's single was the first hit by either team in 14 at-bats with
men in scoring position and helped end New York's four-game winning
streak.
</P>
<P>
   Both teams had chances to break the 2-2 tie that lasted for six
innings. The A's stranded 10 runners from the sixth through the
ninth while the Yankees went zero for nine with runners in scoring
position and had the bases loaded and one out and failed to score
off Jason Isringhausen in the 11th. Luis Sojo blasted a bullet off
the right-field fence that looked like it might be a game winner,
but it was foul by about two feet. He then grounded out to end the
game
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, I was about to jump,'' Sojo said. ``No luck
today.'' It was no shock that Manager Joe Torre gave Cone
additional rest. In 12 starts with four days of rest, Cone is 3-3
with a 4.40 ERA. But in 14 starts in which he has received more
than four days off, the 36-year-old is 8-4 with a 2.01. Torre said
that Cone would start again on six days' rest next Tuesday as he
juggles the other starters. Torre also hinted that Cone would start
Game 3 of the division series because he could not pitch twice in a
five-game series.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was very curious about tonight and very pleased with the
outcome,'' Torre said. ``Not the outcome of the game. The outcome
of his performance.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a crucial start for Cone, who had to prove his arm was
not weary and that he could still be an asset during the
post-season. Cone was hesitating more than usual with his windup
and whiffed three of the first five batters. He wriggled through a
bases-loaded jam in the second and knew that it would not be a
repeat of last Tuesday's massacre in which Texas trampled him for
six runs in one and two-thirds innings. Seven of Cone's 10
strikeouts were swinging strikes, evidence that Cone's pitches were
jumping.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Jeter singled in the third, and O'Neill's first homer
since Aug. 6 gave the Yankees a 2-0 bulge. Cone could not maintain
the lead for one inning. After Stairs worked the count to 3-2, Cone
tried to pump a fastball by him and Stairs drilled the high pitch
over the center-field fence for his 31st homer.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the homer unnerved Cone as he grooved the next fastball
to Olmedo Saenz, and Saenz belted it into the right-field bleachers
to even the score, 2-2. Cone stood in front of the mound after the
second homer on his second fastball, holding his glove above his
head and waiting for a new ball. ``Both fastballs, both crushed,''
Cone said.
</P>
<P>
   The back-to-back homers were distressing, but Cone rebounded to
strike out Ben Grieve and Miguel Tejada. He stranded two in the
sixth and needed Mike Stanton to get the final out in the seventh
to strand three more A's. Cone gave up two homers and the Yankees
lost, but the evening was about the bigger post-season picture and
about Cone feeling like himself again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tonight was a big confidence builder,'' Cone said. ``For
nothing else, I had a lot of life in my arm again. I know Joe and
Mel are going to take care of me and I'm going to get the rest. I
feel good about that.''
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   DAVID CONE, who struck out 10 or more for the 58th time in his
career, is 1-3 with a 4.09 ERA since his perfect game. ... SCOTT
BROSIUS is home in Oregon with his gravely sick father and might
join the team Friday in Anaheim.  &QL;

FATAL CRASHES DECLINE AS DRIVERS GET CAUTIOUS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Mirroring a statewide and national trend, fatal
traffic crashes in Los Angeles have declined significantly, despite
growing population and longer commutes, authorities said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Traffic deaths last year dropped to 1950s levels in California
and in Los Angeles County, which is the state's busiest county when
it comes to the number of drivers and miles driven.
</P>
<P>
   Authorities attributed the trend to safer cars and trucks,
improved driver awareness, better life-saving techniques and less
driving under the influence of alcohol. They also noted that baby
boom drivers are becoming more conservative behind the wheel.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a lot of safer cars, seat-belt laws, air bags and
child seats, and the doctors are doing their magic. If you're a
responsible driver, you will live to drive another day,'' said
California Highway Patrol Officer Bill Preciado.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the number of deaths, the number of fatal crashes
dipped by 5.4 percent statewide last year and by 16 percent
citywide for the first seven months of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Statewide, 3,459 people were killed on the state highways in
1998, down nearly 6 percent from the number in 1997, the CHP
reported. That traffic-death toll was the lowest since 1955, when
3,431 were killed.
</P>
<P>
   The county decline was even greater: down 18 percent from 764 in
1997 to 624 in 1998. Those statistics do not include the five San
Bernardino area teen-agers killed Sunday when their car plunged off
Angeles Crest Highway after an all-night ``rave'' party.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance industry officials said the decline in the number of
serious-injury crashes drove down insurance rates by nearly 3
percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Hartwig, vice president and chief economist for the
Insurance Information Institute in New York, said the decline in
serious injuries is reflected in auto insurance rates, which fell
by nearly 3 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   In part, he attributes the decline to 30 percent of the drivers
on the road being in their safer driving years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baby boomers are moving into safer driving years. As people
age, they tend to be safer drivers,'' Hartwig said. ``There is
something good about getting older.''
</P>
<P>
   Car designs and doctors are also credited with saving lives.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you had an accident 10 years ago, you might have had a
fatal injury. Now, it may be moderate. The injuries are going
down,'' said Sgt. Bob Rieboldt of the LAPD's Traffic Coordination
Section.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the decline are drunk driving arrests and collisions in
which drinking drivers are involved, authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drinking and driving isn't as in vogue as it used to be,''
said Det. R.S. Uber at the LAPD's Valley Traffic Division.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles last year, there were 1,587 collisions in which
at least one driver had been drinking, down nearly 4 percent from
1997, when there were 1,651. And drunk-driving arrests were down 7
percent last year in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very heartening,'' said Tina Pasco, executive director of
Mothers Against Drunk Driving.
</P>
<P>
   But she said that, when drunk driving declines, people might pay
less attention to the problem, and soon it creeps back to former
levels.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we don't keep the visibility and pressure on, we see the
stats go up,'' Pasco said. ``In a lot of ways, it's like having to
start all over again.''
</P>
<P>
   Pedestrian deaths also are down _ nearly 11 percent statewide,
from 783 in 1997 to 698 in 1998, the CHP said.
</P>
<P>
   In Los Angeles, 33 pedestrians were killed from Jan. 1 through
July 31 this year, compared with 51 in the same period last year, a
35 percent decline, according to George Callandrillo, a management
assistant in the LAPD's Traffic Coordination Section.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a growing concern to be cautious out there. Motorists
are looking out for those pedestrians, even if they're not in the
crosswalk,'' Preciado said. ``Those tickets are getting expensive
too.''

MISSOURI'S ATTORNEY GENERAL TRIES TO OUST SHERIFF 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By WILL SENTELL  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   JEFFERSON CITY, Mo. _ Attorney General Jay Nixon, saying inmates
of the Miller County jail are ``literally running the prison,''
moved Tuesday to oust the county's sheriff.
</P>
<P>
   Sheriff Thomas Russell personally and through his jailers let
prisoners keep drugs and knives, provided a jail trusty with drugs
and allowed jailers to trade privileges for money and sex, Nixon
charged in a court petition.
</P>
<P>
   The sheriff even let inmates out of jail to attend the sheriff's
barbecue and allowed them to transport evidence for drug cases, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only way to restore public trust in the office of Miller
County sheriff is to remove the current officeholder,'' Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Russell could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Truesdale, an attorney for Russell, denied the attorney
general's charges and said voters should decide whether the sheriff
remains in office. He said Russell has no plans to quit.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was not involved in any way with criminal wrongdoing,''
Truesdale said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's action followed a nine-month investigation by state
officials and the FBI. Three former Miller County jailers and a
former jail trusty earlier pleaded guilty to criminal corruption
charges filed by Nixon.
</P>
<P>
   Three others face charges in connection with the same
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Miller County is a mostly rural, agricultural area near the Lake
of the Ozarks, about 130 miles southeast of Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   Russell took office in December 1996.
</P>
<P>
   A judge in nearby Dallas County set Sept. 10 for the first
hearing to consider the attorney general's allegations. Attorneys
said the ouster petition was similar to a civil lawsuit. A judge
will decide whether Russell stays in office.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said he had not filed an ouster petition in his seven
years in office. He said such petitions were filed several times in
the 1960s and 1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon's petition contends that Russell ``has engaged in willful
and fraudulent violations of the laws of the state of Missouri and
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   The state's petition said that since January 1997 the sheriff
personally or through the jailers he supervised allowed inmates to
keep drugs, knives and alcohol and to assault each other. He said
Russell made longtime friend and former inmate David Birdsong a
jail trusty and then let him leave jail to drive department
vehicles even though he was supposed to be incarcerated. The
vehicles had loaded shotguns in them, Nixon said.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon also charged that Russell provided Birdsong with
methamphetamine and marijuana while he was under sentence. After
Birdsong was released, the petition said, Russell put him on the
Miller County payroll even though there was an outstanding warrant
for his arrest.
</P>
<P>
   The civil petition also contends Russell failed to segregate
inmates by sex. That led to sexual contact among inmates and
between inmates and jailers, the petition said. Nixon's court
papers also said that Russell twice solicited sexual contact in
exchange for carrying out his official duties.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon said in several cases Russell failed to properly carry out
arrest warrants and allowed prisoners access to drug evidence at
the jail. All but nine of 42 items of evidence disappeared in one
episode, he said.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general said that in May 1998 Russell auctioned
surplus and unclaimed property, failed to deposit all the proceeds
in the county treasury and paid himself and other salaried
employees fees for the auction they were not entitled to.
</P>
<P>
   Nixon downplayed questions on why his office did not file
criminal charges against Russell. He said the investigation is not
over.
</P>
<P>
   But Truesdale, Russell's lawyer, said Nixon filed an ouster
petition because it required less evidence than criminal charges.
Truesdale also said many of the allegations against the sheriff are
based on accounts by people who are cooperating with authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Gier, presiding commissioner of Miller County, said
officials and taxpayers had grown weary of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are ready for the court system to take over and let's get
the evidence presented,'' he said.

SUPPORTERS, DETRACTORS FLIP-FLOP ON BUSH COCAINE ISSUE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID GOLDSTEIN  
 c. 1997 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Peppered with questions about his past, Gov. George
W. Bush is dancing a kind of Texas two-step.
</P>
<P>
   He'll talk about his marriage, and he'll talk about his
drinking, but when asked about his rumored use of cocaine when he
was younger, Bush declares, ``Enough is enough....''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, as governor of Texas, he supports harsher
penalties for small-time drug users.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican presidential front-runner is not the only one who
wants to have it both ways. Supporters, detractors and the news
media, observers say, all appear to be skirting the lines of
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Republicans are the most vulnerable. Suddenly, many in a party
that extolls family values and law and order, and that rails
against Bill Clinton's personal behavior, declare that if Bush ever
used illegal drugs it was just a ``youthful indiscretion.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the Rev. Jerry Falwell, who founded the Moral Majority, has
proclaimed: ``It's forgiven. It's forgotten.''
</P>
<P>
   But not every Republican thinks it's that simple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think conservatives and Republicans are now at great risk of
looking like total hypocrites,'' Bill Kristol, editor of The Weekly
Standard a conservative political magazine, said on ABC's ``This
Week.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They didn't say in 1992 that, `Oh, what Bill Clinton did in
his early 20s didn't matter. That letter to the draft board, he was
22 years old. Whether he smoked dope over in England.'''
</P>
<P>
   And while some of his rivals for the Republican nomination say
the debate should be on issues, they have all answered the question
about drug use with an unequivocal ``no.'' Some candidates, such as
Gary Bauer, add that while personal questions about a candidate's
marriage and family should be off limits, ``I just see a question
related to a felony to be in a different category.''
</P>
<P>
   Democrats, meanwhile, are generally staying on the sidelines,
happy just to watch Bush squirm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the Republicans' culture war, not ours,'' said Jim
Jordan, political director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign
Committee. ``We just have to cook up the popcorn and watch.''
</P>
<P>
   But few Democrats have objected to the persistent questioning of
Bush even though many cried foul about the investigations into the
president's private behavior.
</P>
<P>
   And the news media face their own set of questions. Critics,
including some members of the profession itself, say the press has
kept the story alive for months without producing a speck of
evidence.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, they point to the story earlier this year of an
Arkansas woman who claimed Clinton raped her 21 years ago and whose
account was supported by several witnesses. But the press quickly
lost interest.
</P>
<P>
   On top of that, questions have been raised as to whether the
press could withstand the same kind of scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``A reasonable number of reporters were drug users in their
youth,'' said Kathleen Hall Jamieson, dean of the Annenberg School
for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania. ``Where does
the press get off making assumptions that it's hypocritical for
Bush and not hypocritical for them? There is no evidence that he
ever did it. In absence of that, what right do reporters have to be
pushing the question?''
</P>
<P>
   Political hypocrisy lies in the eye of the beholder. Politicians
often ``reassess'' their positions in light of new information,
sometime sincerely, sometimes for political purposes. Clinton has
been extraordinarily skillful in finessing earlier actions.
</P>
<P>
   It was Clinton, for instance, who admitted during the 1992
campaign that he tried marijuana while a student at Oxford
University in the 1960s, but said he had ``never broken the laws''
of the United States. He also said he never inhaled.
</P>
<P>
   Bush has lately been accused of offering his own ``Clintonian''
answers regarding drugs. After not answering the question for
months, he began to tailor his responses when it was posed a
different way.
</P>
<P>
   First he indicated that he could meet the standard FBI
background question of not having used drugs in the past seven
years. He amended it the next day to being able to meet the 15-year
test used at the time when his father's presidency began in 1989.
That would make the 53-year-old son of former President George Bush
drug-free since he was 28, but not before.
</P>
<P>
   ``The greatest sin in politics is not imperfection, but a lack
of basic honesty,'' said Phil Noble, a Democratic consultant who
used to specialize in opposition research. ``People don't expect
anybody to be perfect, but they don't expect anybody to lie. What
Bush did way back when doesn't matter in most people's eyes. The
only thing that matters is if he isn't straight about it now, if he
waffles and weasels around. That's what looks bad.''
</P>
<P>
   A recent ABC News poll showed that 84 percent said it made no
difference whether Bush used cocaine when he was younger.
</P>
<P>
   The public also has fairly low expectations in general of
politicians when it comes to questions of honesty and saying one
thing and doing another.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. John Ashcroft, a Missouri Republican, for instance, told
radio talk show host Don Imus recently, ``I don't think that
persons are ineligible (to become president) if they have had
indiscretions in the way they have conducted themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet nine years ago as governor of Missouri, Ashcroft supported
``no more second chances'' for casual drug users and backed
legislation that would have stripped beauticians, real estate
agents, accountants, nurses, doctors, and lawyers of their licenses
if they were convicted.
</P>
<P>
   Asked how that squares with his forgiving attitude toward Bush,
Ashcroft said, ``To date, not one shred of evidence has been
produced with respect to Governor Bush.''
</P>
<P>
   The issue caught fire at a breakfast meeting in August with
reporters when Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle of South Dakota
said the press was being gentle toward Bush compared to how it has
treated President Clinton, Hillary Rodham Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore. He also said it was legitimate to ask the
cocaine question.
</P>
<P>
   But a year ago, after Clinton had publicly acknowledged his
relationship with Lewinsky and admitted lying about it, Daschle
said, ``I think people draw a distinction between politics and this
personal tragedy. I really don't think there's any political
ramification to be felt here.''
</P>
<P>
   Some in both parties have tried to stay consistent. James
Carville, a pit bull Clinton defender, said he would advise Bush
not to answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's never going to end,'' said Carville. ``If you answer one
question, he'll just get five more: Who was in the room with you?
Was there a minor? The best way is to say, `Just what part of
``no'' don't you understand?' ''
</P>
<P>
   William Bennett, a Republican who served as federal drug czar
under President Bush and an author of several books on values, said
Bush needed to answer the question.
</P>
<P>
   A vigorous critic of Clinton, he wrote in a column for The Wall
Street Journal that when asked about drugs in 1992, Clinton gave an
evasive answer, ``and we drew conclusions from it. But at the time,
I don't recall anyone claiming the question itself was
inappropriate.''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
For the third consecutive year, Van Chancellor has been named Coach
of the Year in the WNBA.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``As anybody who's had some success will tell you,'' league
president Val Ackerman said Tuesday, ``one of the hardest parts of
being successful is staying successful. And that's especially true
in sports, where winning is everything, in many cases, and the best
teams end up being the biggest targets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Van Chancellor simply won't allow the Houston Comets to stop
being successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor received 18 of a possible 51 votes from a panel of
sportswriters and broadcasters who regularly cover the WNBA.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento's Sonny Allen finished second with 17 votes. Los
Angeles' Orlando Woolridge netted 11.
</P>
<P>
   Laboring all season under the cloud of illness and eventual
death of his friend and former point guard Kim Perrot, Chancellor
still guided the Comets to the best record in the WNBA (26-6).
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor said given the circumstances surrounding this season
_ the death of Perrot, the loss of center Monica Lamb to a
season-ending eye injury in late June, the decision of No. 1 draft
pick Natalia Zasulskaya of Russia not to report to training camp _
his latest coaching award was the one he cherishes most.
</P>
<P>
   ``For what we've gone through, and I mean this sincerely, I've
never really thought about this Coach of the Year situation five
seconds before today,'' Chancellor said. ``I've been so intent on
trying to help us win a championship, and that's been all of our
focus, that's about all it's been about.
</P>
<P>
   ``But what all we've been through, especially these last two
weeks or so, I'd say, yeah, this one is more special.''
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor, in a departure from the last two years, is the only
member of the Comets to receive a postseason honor this season.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento's Yolanda Griffith, previously named Defensive Player
of the Year and Newcomer of the Year, today will be named Most
Valuable Player.
</P>
<P>
   Washington Mystics forward Chamique Holdsclaw, the first college
player taken in this year's draft, was earlier named Rookie of the
Year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our players are responsible for me being here,'' said
Chancellor. ``I just wish some of them had been up here today. That
would have made this a little better for me.
</P>
<P>
   ``Three years running, we're the best defensive team in the
league yet never got a defensive player award. We've won the
championship two years in a row, and we're in the finals for the
third time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, it's a little strange that I'm the only one to get an
honor. I don't understand it.''

ARIZONA PANEL SPLITS ON USE OF STATE TRUST LANDS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By DENNIS WAGNER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a year of research and debate, Arizona's Growing Smarter
Commission approved a laundry list of solutions for urban sprawl
Tuesday, but imploded trying to deal with the most controversial
measure.
</P>
<P>
   At issue: a plan to set aside up to 890,000 of state Trust Lands
for conservation and open space purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the so-called Stewardship Trust, including Rep.
Carolyn Allen, R-Scottsdale, said it is critical for Arizona to
permanently protect up to 10 percent of the state's enormous trust
lands.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said that can only happen if Arizona's Constitution is
rewritten to allow Trust Land to be used for conservation, as well
as school financing.
</P>
<P>
   The change would require a three step process involving approval
by Arizona's Legislature, state voters and Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Foes offered a litany of objections:
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jake Flake, R-Snowflake, insisted that the Stewardship
Trust would be ruin Arizona agriculture. Instead of preserving open
space, Flake warned, the measure would create a stampede of
cattlemen selling their property to developers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I felt this was going through, I'm going home and selling
the ranch,'' he added. ``This is going to put the rancher out of
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Gail Griffin, R-Sierra Vista, noted that Trust Lands were
set aside by Arizona founders to be sold as a financing mechanism
for public education. Putting that land into permanent conservation
would be like taking money from school children, she argued.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Ed Cirillo, R-Sun City, said the stewardship plan is
unnecessary because Growing Smarter commissioners adopted other
measures to save open spaces around big cities, and properties in
the boondocks need no protection.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the panel also argued about how much land should be
set aside, and who should decide which parcels to protect.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, they did not even vote on pivotal elements of the
Stewardship Trust.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, Chairman Jack Pfister devised a watered-down proposal
asking state lawmakers to approve the idea while leaving devilish
details to a task force yet to be created.
</P>
<P>
   Pfister acknowledged later that he did not want a vote on
divisive elements of the issue, because it could have sabotaged a
final vote on the entire Growing Smarter package.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would feel utter despair if we broke down over a few
words,'' he said. ``...We will have done Arizona a grave
disservice.``
</P>
<P>
   Moments later, panelists adopted Pfister's compromise along with
more than 20 other smart-growth recommendations, on a 12-2 vote,
with one absence.
</P>
<P>
   The full package includes proposals to beef up urban planning,
increase voter involvement, encourage rural development and acquire
open-space ``jewels'' for posterity.
</P>
<P>
   Growing Smarter recommendations are expected to compete with a
more forceful measure, the Citizens Growth Management Initiative,
on ballots this autumn.
</P>
<P>
   The commission's package, which was to be presented to Gov. Jane
D. Hull Wednesday, will require approval by Arizona's Legislature
and voters. One provision, if adopted, would establish a $220
million fund to acquire and conserve prime Trust Lands.
</P>
<P>
   Others would:
</P>
<P>
   Create incentives for urban in-fill, along with legislation
authorizing local governments to refuse service beyond designated
growth margins.
</P>
<P>
   Require cities and towns to review their general plans every 10
years, and to get them ratified by voters.
</P>
<P>
   Encourage rural economic growth, including tax incentives for
development.
</P>
<P>
   Pay ranchers for good conservation practices.
</P>
<P>
   Require local government to obtain written consent from property
owners before rezoning their properties, and provide administrative
appeals when owners feel their land has been subjected to a
government ``taking'' for open-space purposes.
</P>
<P>
   Allow Maricopa and Pima counties to restrict so-called
``wildcat'' lot splits which create suburban subdivisions without
access or public services.
</P>
<P>
   The commission has spent months trying to pound out compromises
among 15 members who are split philosophically and politically.
Those differences reared up repeatedly Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   About half the panelists doggedly defended individual property
rights. They objected to government intrusion and the use of
taxpayer money, but favored economic development _ especially in
rural areas.
</P>
<P>
   Other commissioners were equally determined to fight for
conservation and quality-of-life measures.
</P>
<P>
   The net result: either a marvel of reconciliation or a
collection of recommendations that accomplish nothing, depending on
the observer.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy Bahr, a Sierra Club lobbyist, said the hot and cold
factions produced a lukewarm package that does little to force
smarter development.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's really nothing in here that substantially changes the
way we plan and manage growth in Arizona,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   Griffin, Bahr's philosophical opposite, voted against the
package and said later, ``I've got real problems with it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pfister and commissioner Steve Betts, a Phoenix land-use
attorney, insisted the panel's recommendations, if carried forward,
will dramatically curtail unplanned and unsightly growth on the
Arizona scene.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who also voted in favor of the final recommendations,
offered a less-than-glowing appraisal: ``It was not an exercise in
futility.'' &QL;

   ANGELES NATIONAL FOREST _ Reacting to the fatal crash of five
teen-agers after an all-night ``rave'' party, the U.S. Forest
Service said that it will re-examine its policies before
authorizing more overnight concerts.
</P>
<P>
   Forest officials also acknowledged they underestimated how many
people would attend _ at least 7,000 _ and did not assign enough
rangers to monitor the rave, held at the 58-acre Snowcrest ski
resort Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``In spite of our efforts, we obviously had a problem. We are
going to shut this down until we can assure that we're not going to
have this problem again,'' said Terry Ellis, a district ranger in
Angeles National Forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was overwhelming for the piece of ground supporting it,''
said Susan Swinson, a deputy forest supervisor.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Swinson worked on drafting a new policy statement
for the employees who cover the 670,000 acres of forest.
</P>
<P>
   In short, she said, the statement reads in part, ``We will not
be authorizing organized events in the National Forest until we've
identified the protocols on what the areas can accommodate.''
</P>
<P>
   The Forest Service, which receives back 2 percent to 3 percent
of the rave's gross income, vowed that in the future it will study
whether more rangers are needed to accommodate a group.
</P>
<P>
   Two U.S. Forest Service rangers were assigned to monitor the
all-night party that drew mostly teen-agers. Five CHP officers
assisted them. But none of the officials ever entered the rave
party, instead focusing on the miles of traffic outside.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concerts have never drawn this number of people, and we've
never had this many deaths associated with one of these,'' said
Ellis, who has worked in the Angeles Forest for 19 years.
</P>
<P>
   The monitoring inside was left up to the promoter and permit
holder of the event, which hired 70 private security guards.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble surfaced at 1:30 a.m. Sunday, when the first of three
drug overdoses was reported. About six hours later, four females
and a male leaving the rave party drove off Angeles Crest Highway
and plunged 1,200 feet to their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators said Tuesday that it could take up to four weeks
for toxicology results to determine whether drugs or alcohol were
factors in their deaths.
</P>
<P>
   Forest officials said Tuesday that they regret the tragedy but
cannot discriminate against other overnight concerts in the forest.
</P>
<P>
   ``I need to make sure I'm not picking up a bias on the name
`rave.' Instead, I look at whether they are a legal business. Do
they have a legal professional standing,'' Swinson said.
</P>
<P>
   But forest officials said they will scrutinize the number of
people anticipated at any future event and whether it will promote
legal activities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The incident will be thoroughly examined by Forest Service
officers,'' said Pete Pierce, a spokesman for the U.S. Forest
Service in Washington, D.C. ``We do not arbitrarily screen out
requests . . . as long as the proposed activity is legal and within
the prescribed operating plan of the forest.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the promoters of last weekend's rave, B3/Cande
Promotions in Huntington Beach, have not yet determined how they
will handle future raves.
</P>
<P>
   One of the rave promoters with B3/Cande, who would give his name
only as Brian, expressed sympathy for the families of the crash
victims, but said the promoters made every effort to keep the event
safe.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel great sorrow for the families and we're trying to deal
with it ourselves,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel we do everything that every other concert promoter is
required to do. There's not much more we can do.''

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
The game had been one of the toughest uphill climbs for the Comets
during their three years in the WNBA.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The final 15 seconds of a 72-62 win over the Los Angeles Sparks
at Compaq Center on Monday night that carried with it the Western
Conference championship were filled with some of the most heated
moments the league has seen.
</P>
<P>
   Considering the circumstances, the Comets said Tuesday it was
one of their most satisfying victories ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ranks right up there at the top,'' said Cynthia Cooper, who
matched Sheryl Swoopes with a game-high 23 points Monday and had a
career-high 12 assists. ``Los Angeles really didn't show a lot of
respect for us. I guess that's expected in the playoffs. LA's a
very, very confident team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough-fought game. And any time you win a game like
that, you have to be very happy. But they were gesturing to us out
in Los Angeles (when the Sparks opened the best-of-three series
with a 75-60 victory Thursday). We had an off night, and we
obviously weren't too happy about that. So to be able to come back
and win the series shut up a lot of people who doubted us.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's definitely satisfying. But that's only one piece of the
puzzle. The major piece is still to be put in the puzzle. That's to
go out to New York and play better than we did in the Los Angeles
series.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets face the Liberty in the first game of the
best-of-three WNBA Championship Series at Madison Square Garden on
Thursday night. The second game and a third, if necessary, will be
played at Compaq Center on Saturday and Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Saluting the Comets as champs of the West for the third year in
a row momentarily took a back seat to a bevy of ``military
salutes'' prevalent around the floor in the closing seconds Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Cooper, during a timeout, bounced up and down as she saluted
triumphantly at her teammates and some of those in the crowd of
12,673.
</P>
<P>
   Swoopes, able to smile for the first time on a night filled with
dour, desperate faces earlier, gave a salute to assistant coach
Alisa Scott.
</P>
<P>
   Tammy Jackson and Tina Thompson saluted the crowd. And Thompson
had the biggest gesture, a farewell salute to the Sparks' Lisa
Leslie, who started the charged scene with 15 seconds remaining.
</P>
<P>
   TV cameras had caught Leslie moments earlier swinging an
unprovoked elbow into the midsection of Thompson as the two stood
along the free-throw lane. As they jogged upcourt afterward,
Thompson had a few words with her former Southern Cal teammate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told her, `You know, that's not even called for, but the
funny thing about it is you guys are going home,''' Thompson said
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Again, the TV cameras caught Leslie throwing a two-handed shove
at Thompson's throat. After another verbal exchange, the action
heated up anew. An enraged Leslie tried to fight through a crowd of
players and officials in an apparent attempt to get at Thompson.
</P>
<P>
   ``She said she was going to kill me, or something like that,''
said Thompson. ``And I just saluted her. I wasn't going to
retaliate or anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Once order was restored, Leslie and Thompson were ejected.
</P>
<P>
   With the victory secure, coach Van Chancellor was so overcome
with emotion he left the bench area, waded into the crowd and
embraced Connie Perrot, mother of Kim Perrot, who died of cancer
Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it would have been for the championship of the whole WNBA,
it would be the most satisfying,'' Chancellor said. ``I'd have to
say beating Phoenix (in the decisive game in 1998) was the most
satisfying. But Monday's game meant so much because of all the
things this team has overcome.''

A SQUEEZE AND A SLAM BY ASTROS LEAVE METS FEELING WHIPLASHED 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Tuesday night was going to be an antidote for those
still feeling punchy from Monday's mashball marathon. It was going
to be a pitchers' duel between the Mets and Astros that featured
the execution of one of baseball's most fundamental _ yet still
breathtaking _ plays.
</P>
<P>
   And then the bashers' highlight reel flipped on again.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Caminiti, the Astros' hulking third baseman, slugged a high,
deep grand slam into right-center field to break open a tightly
played game in the eighth inning to give the Astros a 6-2 victory
over the Mets. The shot was redemption for Caminiti, whose throwing
error had opened the way for the Mets to tie the game in the top of
the inning.
</P>
<P>
   But it was virtually a self-fulfilling prophecy for the Mets
reliever Turk Wendell. He does not relish having much time off
between appearances and this time it had been a week since he last
pitched. When he relieved Kenny Rogers in the eighth, Wendell
walked Craig Biggio and then, after getting Matt Mieske to swing
and miss on a hit-and-run play, gave up a double to Mieske that put
men on second and third with one out. The Mets intentionally walked
Jeff Bagwell to load the bases and set up a potential inning-ending
double play in a decision that Manager Bobby Valentine called ``a
no-brainer.''
</P>
<P>
   Wendell struck out Caminiti the last time he faced him, but
Caminiti was 2 for 7 in his career against Wendell, and both hits
were homers. Tuesday night, Caminiti looked at one high and outside
pitch from Wendell, took a roundhouse swing at the next, and then
punched a fastball that was up and over the plate 10 rows deep.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some reason, I always pitch badly when I have a layoff,''
Wendell said. ``I try to stay sharp in the bullpen, but it's not
the same. I'm not going to make an issue of it, but I hope they
look at it and say, `Maybe we should have gotten him in there to
face a batter.' I need to pitch to be effective.''
</P>
<P>
   With the loss, the Mets fell three and one-half games behind the
Braves in the National League East. But, because Atlanta beat
Cincinnati, 8-2, the Mets are still three games ahead in the
wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   That was some comfort for Wendell, who joked that, although he
gave up four runs on two hits and two walks, this was not the worst
he had pitched. The grand slam is the outsize shot that will be
remembered from this game. But it was a far subtler, equally
dramatic play that the Astros used to break up a scoreless tie in
the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   Rogers, who told Valentine after the fifth inning that he could
no longer swing a bat because the soreness in his back was flaring,
had allowed just two balls hit in the air in the first six innings
and got 12 outs on the ground, using the same sinker that flummoxed
the Astros last week. So, on the night after the Astros had been
battered for 17 runs while producing only one of their own, it was
somehow fitting that they needed a suicide squeeze to finally
score.
</P>
<P>
   With one out, Bagwell drew a walk. Caminiti singled through the
hole at short, sending Bagwell to second. Bagwell nearly stopped
there, but he looked directly at left fielder Rickey Henderson, who
could not cleanly field the grounder. Bagwell took off for third
and made it easily, the kind of heads-up play that has helped make
Bagwell a leading candidate for the league's most valuable player
award. Rogers was thinking strikeout when the pinch-hitter Russ
Johnson came to the plate, but Valentine had intelligence reports
telling otherwise. When the count reached 1-1, Mike Piazza called
for a pitchout. The Astros had squeezed four times on a 1-1 count
this year, but this time, the runners didn't move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt the situation was coming,'' Valentine said.
</P>
<P>
   It was, on the next pitch, which, the reports showed, the Astros
had done only once before. With Bagwell shimmying down the
third-base line, Johnson put down a perfect slow-rolling bunt back
toward Rogers. Rogers slipped slightly coming off the mound and
although he fielded the ball cleanly, he had no chance to get
Bagwell at the plate.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was going to flip it,'' Rogers said. ``I could see him
coming and I'd rather make sure I get the out.''
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti scored the second run of the inning when Ryan Thompson,
who was designated for assignment after the game, hit a double to
the wall in center field. The Astros led by 2-0 and the Mets seemed
to have forgotten the magic bats that had belted out 21 hits Monday
night back at the hotel.
</P>
<P>
   Through the first seven innings, the Astros starter Jose Lima
(18-7) had allowed no runner to reach third base, and Robin Ventura
and Henderson had both been thrown out trying to get there. But
fittingly, Edgardo Alfonzo, whose three home runs and six hits had
rewritten the record books Monday night, was involved in the Mets'
comeback. He hit a roller to Caminiti that the third baseman threw
wildly to first base. Alfonzo went to second to lead off the eighth
inning. John Olerud, just as mild-mannered and only slightly more
expected to slug the occasional home run than Alfonzo, belted the
first pitch from Lima into the seats in right center for his 16th
home run of the season to tie the score and send Caminiti into a
crestfallen crouch in the infield.
</P>
<P>
   A half-inning later, Caminiti would have his solace and the Mets
would be left to wonder if the rust from Wendell's rest now would
be worth the fresher arm later in a pennant race.

 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
Ken Caminiti admitted to doing some tossing and turning in his bed
Monday night, wondering why his swing had chosen now to take a
leave of absence. But even in his deepest sleep, Caminiti could not
have dreamed of a better scenario for a coming-out party.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tie game, eighth inning. Grand slam, and goodnight, New York
Mets.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti made amends for an error that led to the Mets' only
runs by blasting the fifth bases-loaded homer of his career in the
Astros' 6-2 victory Tuesday night at the Astrodome. It was the
Astros' 13th last-at-bat victory.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic shot into the right-field mezzanine turned a
potential no-decision into Jose Lima's National League-leading 18th
victory. Lima, pitching on three days' rest, didn't allow an earned
run in eight innings and has a microscopic 0.89 ERA in his last
four wins.
</P>
<P>
   But as good as Lima was, he was more than willing to surrender
the spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cammy was the hero, not me,'' Lima said. ``He's the man
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   That alone made it perhaps the most emotional of the Astros' 79
victories this season. Caminiti spent 79 games on the disabled
list, which makes being in situations like Tuesday's all the more
precious.
</P>
<P>
   The modest crowd of 24,982 erupted as Caminiti floated around
the bases, and the Astros' dugout was an absolute mob scene.
Considering the number of times Caminiti was pounded on the helmet,
thumbed in the chest and slapped on the rear, it wouldn't surprise
anyone if he were a little sore today.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must have hit him about 20 times,'' Lima said. ``I was so
happy for him.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy Wagner pitched a perfect ninth inning to close out the
Mets, who dropped to 3{ games behind Atlanta in the National League
East. The NL Central-leading Astros re-established a 1{-game
cushion over Cincinnati, which lost 8-2 to the Braves.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to imagine anyone who was at the Astrodome feeling
cheated by Tuesday's game, which featured a little bit of
everything. Lima (18-7) and Mets starter Kenny Rogers were locked
in a scoreless pitchers' duel until the Astros broke through with
two runs in the seventh inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only a lover of good pitching could have appreciated the first
seven innings,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   So you like good defense?
</P>
<P>
   The Mets and Astros are the Nos. 1 and 3 fielding teams,
respectively, in the NL, so naturally the glove work was exemplary
at times. Astros second baseman Craig Biggio, for instance, always
seemed to be in the right place at the right time, and Mets
shortstop Rey Ordonez was, well, Rey Ordonez.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing sends fans into a frenzy like a grand slam.
Caminiti's bomb off Mets reliever Turk Wendell (3-2) was the
Astros' fifth slam of the season, and it undoubtedly was Caminiti's
biggest hit in his abbreviated campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was redemption,'' the switch-hitting third baseman said.
``I couldn't find a hole big enough to put my head into after that
error. I got a chance to get even, and I got a good swing on it.''
</P>
<P>
   In the top of the eighth, it was Caminiti's throwing error on a
two-out grounder to third base that prolonged the Mets' inning and
set the stage for John Olerud's two-run homer off Lima, who has
allowed a team-high 25 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jose pitched a great game, and I felt bad after I turned that
easy play into an ugly two-run inning,'' said Caminiti, who is
hitting .243 in the Astros' last 11 games.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker visited Lima on the mound before Olerud stepped into the
batter's box, but only to give Wagner some extra time to warm up.
The plan was to have Wagner face Mike Piazza if the Astros had the
lead when the slugging catcher came to the plate. It was a moot
point after Olerud crushed Lima's first pitch into the seats.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Lima stole a glance into the Astros' dugout to see
if Dierker would make a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was thinking, `Please stay in the dugout! Please stay in the
dugout!''' Lima said. ``I'm glad he let me get that last out. I
made a bad pitch to Olerud, but I'm a competitor, and I like to
finish what I start.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros scored their first run in the seventh on Russ
Johnson's squeeze bunt, which scored Jeff Bagwell from third base.
Ryan Thompson, hitless in his first 10 at-bats after being promoted
from Class AAA New Orleans, followed with an RBI double that scored
Caminiti.

FORESTED LAND IN THE EMERALD CITY IS DROPPING DRAMATICALLY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KRISTIN DIZON  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The Emerald City? Not according to a new study, which
suggests Seattle's nickname should be downgraded to a less
brilliant shade of green.
</P>
<P>
   What residents have noticed for years _ that the number of trees
are declining _ has been confirmed in an analysis by American
Forests, which bills itself as the oldest conservation group in the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   And according to the city's own forestry experts, many of the
urban trees that remain are in poor health.
</P>
<P>
   Using a combination of digital satellite images, aerial
photography, Geographical Information Systems mapping and ground
surveys, the group said their analysis shows the amount of forested
land in the city is dropping dramatically.
</P>
<P>
   In 1972, 10 percent of the city's land area was heavily treed.
By 1996, the amount of forested land comprised just 5 percent of
the city.
</P>
<P>
   The loss of treed land has had an economic impact, according to
the 20,000-member group. Seattle's tree loss has resulted in an
estimated additional 11.5 million cubic feet of stormwater runoff
during a peak storm. The cost of containing and managing that
runoff is a minimum of $23 million, the group says.
</P>
<P>
   The lost tree canopy also would have removed 159,000 pounds of
air pollutants from the atmosphere each year.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting in Seattle this week, American Forests also called for a
nationwide initiative to combat sprawl.
</P>
<P>
   Its message is simple: Plant more trees, maintain existing ones
and uproot fewer trees.
</P>
<P>
   Seattle's tree shortage is not unique. According to American
Forests' survey of other urban areas, cities across the nation have
lost about one-third of their canopy in the last quarter century,
much of it to suburban sprawl and development.
</P>
<P>
   ``Trees are very important to the quality of life of a
community,'' said Deborah Gangloff, executive director of American
Forests.
</P>
<P>
   She and others extolled the many benefits of trees, including
soaking up harmful gases that contribute to the greenhouse effect,
decreasing surface erosion, providing shade cover and keeping a
city's average temperature lower. The conference kicked off a round
of tree-planting fervor. King County Executive Ron Sims is expected
to announce Wednesday that the county is creating a public-private
initiative to plant 200,000 trees next year along the Interstate 90
Mountain to Sound Greenway.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Eddie Bauer employees planted trees in the shadow of
the Space Needle at the Seattle Center. For the last three years,
the Seattle-based clothing company has supported American Forests'
Global ReLeaf program, which aims to plant 20 million trees around
the world by next year. The company encourages donations of $1 or
more from customers and so far has raised enough money to plant 2.5
million trees.
</P>
<P>
   The city of Seattle has set its own goals for tree planting.
Mayor Paul Schell has called for planting 20,000 trees by Earth Day
2000. So far, about one-quarter of that has been planted. The
effort is expected to cost $2 million, with half the money coming
from private donations and corporate support.
</P>
<P>
   The last major tree spree in Seattle came in the early 1970s
when the ambitious voter-funded public works program Forward Thrust
led to a wave of plantings, said Shane Dewald, city landscape
architect.
</P>
<P>
   But most of Seattle's tall, leafy canopy dates back decades.
During the Great Depression, the Civilian Conservation Corps
planted trees across the city, said Paul West, the city's senior
urban forester.
</P>
<P>
   It's impossible to know for sure, but the city estimates that on
land it controls, there are more than 1.4 million trees.
</P>
<P>
   The various tree planting campaigns come at a good time.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have an aging urban forest,'' West said. ``Right now we're
losing a lot of trees that were planted at the turn of the
century.''
</P>
<P>
   While West said the average life span of a tree in a harsh urban
environment is just 10 years, many of Seattle's declining trees are
between 75 and 100 years old.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, the city's concerted effort to thicken the
urban forest canopy includes free trees for residents to plant
along street rights of way and discounts for anyone wishing to
plant a tree from participating nurseries.
</P>
<P>
   ``We really hope people call and tell us where the trees are
needed, because we've got them,'' said Duane Pentilla, the city's
park horticulturalist.

ABRACADABRA! MAKING MUSIC STILL MAGIC TO STEVE MILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY RODGERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his multiplatinum heyday, Steve Miller seemed to have the
magic formula for hit pop singles bottled on a shelf in his
recording studio, ready to be poured into each new album.
</P>
<P>
   Crisp guitar work, infectious lyrics and a danceable beat were
blended into such gems as ``Jet Airliner,'' ``Fly Like an Eagle,''
``Take the Money and Run'' and ``Jungle Love. ''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp production made these hits jump out of even the tinniest
car radio, and Miller _ who is on his annual summer amphitheater
tour _ became one of the most popular and well-paid rock artists of
the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's probably earned as much money selling albums as
Joe Montana made playing football, don't expect Miller to wax warm
and fuzzy about record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Today's huge recording conglomerates are ``destroying careers
left and right because of their own incompetence and their
inability to represent 200 artists (simultaneously),'' Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much better if there's a lot of small companies competing
with each other than five companies all patting each other on the
back and going, `Hey, let's corner this and screw everybody.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who's made more than 20 albums and still sells a million
discs a year, has seen the industry change over three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record companies were so full of (expletive) when I was
signing with them in 1967,'' says Miller, calling from a tour stop
in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were racist, they stole money from people, they were
dishonest, their contracts were horrible, and it had to be
straightened out.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a hot guitarist who was making waves with his Steve
Miller Blues Band in San Francisco at the time, says he was able to
land a lucrative record deal because 14 companies were courting
him.
</P>
<P>
   But that was hardly his ticket to a life of leisure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys at (Capitol Records) were all flunkies at EMI, our
lord and master in London,'' Miller says. ``They were like
vacuum-cleaner salesmen; they didn't know how to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial rough going with his label, however, had its up
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Capitol Records in LA to record my first album, and
the engineering staff walked out because I was a hippie and they
didn't want to record `that hippie,' '' Miller recalls.
</P>
<P>
   So, Miller went to England to record and later met the Beatles,
forging a lasting relationship with Paul McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's London producer, Glyn Johns, also recorded the Beatles
and invited the American to a session.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I went down and watched John (Lennon) and Paul sing
``Don't Let Me Down'' and ``Get Back.'' ... It was the most
exciting moment of my life,'' Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Miller jammed with McCartney and George Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then George took off, and Paul and I did a tune ``(My Dark
Hour),'' and I released it on my record'' _ with McCartney listed
as ``Paul Ramon.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Miller and McCartney collaborated on six songs,
three of which appear on McCartney's 1997 LP, ``Flaming Pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's career skyrocketed in the early '70s, when he decided
to produce his own records after six progressive rock albums had
earned critical raves but no hit singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to make my music positive and ... more upbeat,'' he
says. ``Plenty of people were covering the dark side of things. I
really like the `up' music more, and I like singing the
harmonies.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was 1973's ``The Joker,'' and its hit title track put
Miller in the ear of mainstream America. Two follow-up albums,
``Fly Like an Eagle'' and ``Book of'' ``Dreams,'' which contained
such megahits as ``Rock 'N Me, Jet Airliner ''``''and
``Swingtown,'' put Miller's bank account in the stratosphere, but
also took a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were two or three times when I just burned
out,'' Miller says. ``I remember walking off a stage in a football
stadium ... . It was like the 39th football stadium in a row at the
end of four years of non-stop touring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mad because there were `only' 40,000 people. And I gave
my guitar to my roadie and said, `I don't care if I ever do this
again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, at age 55, Miller has learned to balance touring
and his personal life, which is centered on life near Seattle with
his third wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've toured every year for the last 12 years, and it's great
because we've grown so much as musicians _ our tone, our chops,''
Miller says. ``I played the best guitar I've ever played the last
two gigs!
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just something in me that wants to play music. I love
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why his current outing is called ``Last Call Summer
Tour,'' Miller cheerfully clears up any doubts: ``That's the last
call for the century, the millennium. We're already planning next
year!'' &QL;

TEEN'S STAR RISING IN BOXING MOVIE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JESSE HIESTAND  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- At 14, Ernesto Hernandez was a pudgy teen-ager
who tore into the heavy bag at backyard boxing rings, determined to
lose weight and gain respect.
</P>
<P>
   Now trim and agile, the 17-year-old from the San Fernando
community in Los Angeles' San Fernando Valley is starring next to
Emmy Award-winning actor Jimmy Smits in the feature film ``Price of
Glory,'' in which he portrays the youngest son of a boxer.
</P>
<P>
   And no one is more surprised than Ernesto.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I was overweight, if I got a second look it was out of
sympathy,'' Ernesto said Tuesday, while taking a break between
classes at San Fernando High School. ``Now with the movie _ it's
completely different. I have all kinds of people approaching me.''
</P>
<P>
   The teen-ager beat out 2,000 others at an open casting call in
February, and according to the movie producer _ it was no contest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The director just pulled him out of the line and brought him
in with another select group of about 40,'' producer Moctesuma
Esparza said during a news conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for someone about 16 with a boxing background.
He was perfect. When he read, he was just a natural. He had
charisma,'' said Esparza.
</P>
<P>
   For Ernesto, the big break has yielded an avalanche of attention
from agents, managers and movie producers.
</P>
<P>
   But this computer whiz, who stays after school to help other
kids in the campus technology lab, insists he has retained his
modesty _ especially around classmates.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want them to see me and say, God, he's a movie star,
because I'm still the same person as before,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez tries to keep quiet about the movie at school, but
word has gotten around.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something to be very proud of,'' said senior Roxanna
Flores, 17. ``But he's not parading around school like, I'm in a
movie. It hasn't gone to his head. He's a real well-rounded
student.''
</P>
<P>
   Albeit one with enough acting talent to play opposite Smits in
the New Line Cinema film, which is set to be released early next
year.
</P>
<P>
   Smits was filming a movie in Toronto on Tuesday and was
unavailable for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ernesto's break came during an open casting call in February.
Prodded by an older sister who acts in plays, Ernesto went to the
audition reluctantly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was a waste of time,'' he said. ``I was just
going to go in, give my name and leave.''
</P>
<P>
   He arrived early and waited at the front of the line with
brother-in-law Robert Mora, who had earlier taught him to box.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was pretty positive that if they just saw him, he would be
picked,'' said Mora, now Hernandez's manager.
</P>
<P>
   But at the time, Hernandez had no acting experience aside from a
few classroom skits. The only other time he tried out for a role _
in an elementary school play _ he was passed over and cast instead
as a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   In the years leading up to that tense Saturday morning casting
call, he busied himself with schoolwork and became engrossed with
computers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never really paid attention to the drama _ cry this way,
feel this emotion,'' he said. ``I guess that's what helped me
during the call because when I got there it was completely new, and
I was completely honest with my portrayal.''
</P>
<P>
   The movie's makers liked what they saw, from Hernandez's pony
tail and assured walk to his grasp of the character, Johnny Ortega.
</P>
<P>
   ``By the end of the day he was rehearsing with Jimmy Smits,''
Esparza said.
</P>
<P>
   What followed was two months of training to box Hollywood-style,
to throw punches but not land them. He did his own stunt work in
the film.
</P>
<P>
   Set in Maricosa, Ariz., ``Price of Glory'' tells the story of a
one-time boxer (Smits) who tries to revive his dreams through his
three sons, two of whom are portrayed by seasoned actors. Ernesto
was cast as the third son.
</P>
<P>
   Esparza said he often tries to find new faces for his films,
just as he had cast some roles in another of his films, ``Selena.''
He also produced the ``Milagro Beanfield War,'' ``Gettysburg'' and
``Introducing Dorothy Dandridge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Price of Glory'' was filmed in Arizona and around Los Angeles,
including St. Ferdinand's Catholic Church in San Fernando.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez was on set throughout March, keeping up with his
studies through a private tutor.
</P>
<P>
   It was only then, when the production started rolling, that
reality set in.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I was on the set filming, signing the contract, then I
was like, This is for real. That's when I was just overwhelmed.''
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez's commitment to his family and studies has not abated
with his brush with Hollywood. He still wakes about 6 a.m. every
school day and has breakfast with his mom before heading to class.
</P>
<P>
   He writes for the school newspaper, plays on the tennis team and
helped build the school's computer center. Evenings are dedicated
to homework, hanging out with friends or playing with his
Rottweiler, Cheeks.
</P>
<P>
   While he is making an effort to see more movies now, Hernandez
said he was never infatuated with the industry or its stars.
</P>
<P>
   Through his exposure to the technical side of movie making,
Hernandez was inspired to start a film festival at school featuring
short films by students and faculty.
</P>
<P>
   The goal, he said, is to demonstrate the value of teamwork that
he saw in action on the set.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ernesto is a leader because he knows how to make other people
feel important,'' said one of his instructors, social studies
teacher Marco Torres.

CROWDS SEEKING CLINTONS PUT SPOTLIGHT ON CHELSEA 
</HEADLINE>
  (ua) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKANEATELES, N.Y. _ It was not the president of the United
States. It was not even the first lady. But when Chelsea Clinton
turned the corner onto the main street of this beguiling Finger
Lakes village Tuesday afternoon, unannounced and seemingly out of
nowhere, it caused a commotion of presidential proportions.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of tourists, townsfolk, reporters and shopkeepers who
had been wandering in search of a Clinton converged on Chelsea, 19,
who had managed for a moment to walk unnoticed with a friend and a
Secret Service agent along Jordan Street.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh my God, that's her!'' exclaimed Lena Faben, bounding to her
feet, her camera in hand.
</P>
<P>
   Shouts of ``Chelsea!'' filled the air. Emily Conklin, 85, seated
in a wheelchair, called out, ``Chelsea, I want to shake your
hand!''
</P>
<P>
   One woman running for an autograph caught her leg in a bicycle
that was parked on a sidewalk and flipped over hard on her back.
``Are you OK?'' Miss Clinton asked. ``I am so sorry.''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the president's daughter arrived at the Skaneateles
Library and John D. Barrow Art Gallery and turned to the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to walk in there,'' she said. ``Please don't follow
me. I'm going to walk out the same door.''
</P>
<P>
   After leaving the crowd, she entered the art gallery, where she
signed her name in the guest book. (The sheet was instantly locked
away in the library safe.)
</P>
<P>
   She emerged 45 minutes later to a crowd that was three times as
large and twice as enthusiastic. The president's daughter slowly
worked her way down the line, shaking every hand and touching every
baby before she hopped into a van and took off.
</P>
<P>
   Before the Clintons arrived here on Monday, to spend five days
at the lake-front home of Thomas McDonald, a Clinton supporter, the
mood in this village, which is overwhelmingly Republican, was
somewhere between apprehension and hostility. One restaurant owner
vowed not to serve the Clintons if they showed up. But Skaneateles
was buzzing Tuesday, as even residents who said they had not voted
for Clinton enjoyed their village's sudden celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's pretty infectious,'' Sally Brew said as she waited for
Miss Clinton to emerge from the library.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the warm reception that the Clintons have received here,
it would be a mistake to draw too strong a message about support
for Mrs. Clinton in her presumed race for the Senate next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still have to think about that,'' said Carol Haber, a
retired teacher who waited four hours in front of the McDonald home
to catch a handshake from the president.

</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1999, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
FOR all the disappointment in the Astros' clubhouse over Moises
Alou's season coming to a screeching halt before it ever got going,
there is a bit of solace to be found.
</P>
<P>
   There's always next year. Alou should be fine by then. After
all, baseball for a talent like Alou must be like riding a bicycle.
You never forget.
</P>
<P>
   It's only in seasons like this one when baseball is like falling
off your bike, crashing, nearly running over your kid and having 70
cc's of fluid removed from your scarred knee.
</P>
<P>
   The season that couldn't get any stranger or take any more wild
turns for Alou and the Astros, did.
</P>
<P>
   Alou was riding a bicycle and playing with his 3-year-old son
over the weekend when he crashed and reinjured his knee.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bleak'' is how Astros general manager Gerry Hunsicker
described the prospects of Alou managing a return before the end of
this season, playoffs or no playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Consider it safe to say we won't see Alou again until next
spring.
</P>
<P>
   But amid the dark clouds that swarmed outside the Astrodome on
this dark, threatening day and the clouds that seemed to be forming
inside as news of Alou's season-ending setback spread, there was
the proverbial silver lining.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I found out today about Moises,'' Astros starter Jose
Lima said, ``I thought, `Oh, man, we're going to miss him.' It's
hard to replace him.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course it is. But how can these 1999 Astros miss what they
never had?
</P>
<P>
   As vital a player as Alou could be when healthy, the Astros have
climbed to the top of the division without him.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the biggest news that came out of Tuesday's 6-2 Astros win
over the Mets was not that Alou was still out but that Ken Caminiti
was back. He was his old self, and other familiar contributors
might not be far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti described his hitting from the left side of the plate
in recent games as, ``dormant, shut-down, bad, gone, nonexistent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Caminiti's dramatic eighth-inning grand slam that hammered
the Mets and helped Lima to his league-leading 18th win of the year
Tuesday might have been as good a sign for this team as Alou's
setback was bad.
</P>
<P>
   Put it this way: The Astros' troops might not be ready to attack
the playoffs full-force just yet, but they're assembling along the
border.
</P>
<P>
   Caminiti has yet to show any serious lingering effects of the
calf injury that put him out for nearly three months earlier this
year. Then Tuesday he looked as confident as ever swinging the bat,
even before the monstrous shot that earned the win and spelled
redemption for his throwing error, which led to the game-tying
homer.
</P>
<P>
   Bill Spiers, who has been as clutch and consistent as any Astro,
also returned to the team after sitting out four days as his lower
back pain eased following a cortisone shot.
</P>
<P>
   Derek Bell, who might not be the most popular Astro but
certainly is among the club's top run-producers, will be back
today. Carl Everett, who has been as consistent with the bat as
Jeff Bagwell this season, will take a week, maybe 10 days at the
most, before he'll back in the lineup.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was all that 10-10-whatever dialing that
Hunsicker did on the day that rosters had to be finalized for
playoff eligibility. The Astros released Sean Bergman, recalled
Jose Cabrera, designated outfielder Ryan Thompson for assignment
and traded for outfielder Stan Javier.
</P>
<P>
   The only one of those moves that could make a difference come
playoff time is the trade with the Giants for Javier, a 15-year
veteran who still has some speed with both his legs and his bat.
</P>
<P>
   In a season when they couldn't count on Alou, what the Astros
could count on was a consistent pitching staff and a lineup that
managed just enough clutch hits to keep the Reds at bay.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time in a while, we saw both of those things
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Lima, who fancies himself as the team's stopper _ someone who
takes the mound and stops the bleeding when things are going bad _
was superb for all but one pitch.
</P>
<P>
   But even after giving up the two-run tying shot to John Olerud
in the eighth, as stoppers go Lima's winning performance in the
wake of Monday's hammering was like suturing a severed artery. He
stopped some serious bleeding.
</P>
<P>
   And then there was Caminiti, stopping a bad skid from the left
side of the plate and looking like his old self.
</P>
<P>
   ``That hit was huge for me,'' Caminiti said.
</P>
<P>
   It set off the Astrodome fireworks and had 24,982 fans screaming
for a curtain call, although Cammy couldn't take it because his
teammates were bombarding him with celebratory slaps and punches.
</P>
<P>
   ``My chest is all bruised up,'' Caminiti said. ``But that's all
right.''
</P>
<P>
   For this team that has been bruised, battered and broken,
finally things are starting to hurt so good.

ARPAIO DEPUTY IS CLEARED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By CHRISTINA LEONARD  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Maricopa County Sheriff Joe Arpaio's chief deputy has been
cleared by federal prosecutors who closed an investigation into
allegations that he embezzled funds from the office's pink
underwear sales and ordered surveillance on political enemies.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's Office sent David Hendershott a letter
Monday, saying there was insufficient evidence to justify further
action on allegations that he committed bankruptcy fraud, illegal
electronic surveillance and misappropriated funds from the sale of
county-issued pink underwear.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been saying it's garbage from Day 1,'' said Jack
MacIntyre, another aide to the sheriff. ``And it's garbage two
years after the fact.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff and Dave Hendershott have been fully vindicated
once again.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI probe included questions about missing money from a
posse program that Hendershott oversaw. But further details were
unavailable Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also have alleged that deputies were ordered to shadow
office critics to prepare dossiers on them and that they illegally
wiretapped dissenting employees within the Sheriff's Office.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Hendershott, chief of operations for the Sheriff's Office who
oversees a $111 million budget and a $900 million jail construction
project, said in a statement Tuesday that ``these fabrications were
made by a few former employees and present disgruntled employees
and political enemies.'' He called the investigation an ongoing
witch hunt.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Attorney's Office sent Hendershott the letter because
the investigation had received so much media attention, spokeswoman
Cathy Colbert said.
</P>
<P>
   Colbert said the letter was addressed solely to Hendershott
because ``nobody else was subject of this investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   MacIntyre, however, views the notice as much more significant.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the allegations of federal investigation have all been
cleared,'' he said. ``There's nothing open and nothing pending.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials with the U.S. Attorney's Office and the FBI could not
confirm whether they are investigating additional cases.
</P>
<P>
   However, federal officials are still investigating allegations
of a cover-up in the 1996 jailhouse death of inmate Scott Norberg,
who died of asphyxiation in a restraint chair.
</P>
<P>
   Arpaio said the allegations surrounding Hendershott and his
office were ``based on spite, malice and jealousy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The sheriff expects these kinds of attacks because of his
popularity,'' MacIntyre said. ``It's just unfortunate that his
political enemies stoop to this low level of mudslinging.''
</P>
<P>
   MacIntyre said detectives are still conducting an internal
investigation on allegations made that Arpaio ordered deputies to
tail political foes, including Maricopa County Attorney Rick
Romley.
</P>
<P>
   Romley declined to comment, but said through a spokesman that
they thought the allegations were serious enough to forward to the
U.S. Attorney's Office.
</P>
<P>
   ``The results are as you have them,'' spokesman Bill FitzGerald
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Gerberry,  &UR; president of the Maricopa County Deputies
Association, said he hopes investigations into possible wrongdoing
at the Sheriff's Office will continue.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my opinion, I think they might have bowed to some of the
political pressure,'' he said. ``He's a very popular individual,
and I think the U.S. Attorney's Office _ and the FBI, for that
matter _ because of Waco and Ruby Ridge, have taken some very
strong hits. And I don't think they want to take on a very popular
guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Colbert denied those accusations.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our office treats any allegation as serious, particularly in
regards to people in a public position,'' she said. ``We are
dedicated to this, and we go where the investigation takes us.''  &QL;

MCCAIN ADMITS SUICIDE ATTEMPTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By JEFF BARKER  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain, worried that he would crack under the strain of
repeated beatings and torture by his captors during the Vietnam
War, says in a new book that he twice made feeble attempts at
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``Despairing of any relief from pain and further torture, and
fearing the close approach of my moment of dishonor, I tried to
take my life,'' the Republican Arizona senator wrote in the
just-released ``Faith of my Fathers''.
</P>
<P>
   ``Dishonor'' in McCain's case could have meant confessing bogus
war crimes to the North Vietnamese or disclosing U.S. battle
strategies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I doubt I really intended to kill myself. But I couldn't fight
anymore, and I remember deciding that the last thing I could do to
make them believe I was still resisting, that I wouldn't break, was
to attempt suicide,'' he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, it wasn't an ideal plan, but it struck me at the
time as reasonable.''
</P>
<P>
   He twice began to loop a shirt around his neck for a suicide by
hanging but was caught by guards, he wrote.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a Navy flyer, was on a bombing mission over Hanoi when
his plane was hit by an enemy missile during the Vietnam War in
October 1967. He was a prisoner of war for 5{ years.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and his top aide, Mark Salter, decided to write the book
a few years ago to tell the story of McCain's POW years and of the
senator's father and grandfather, both of whom were admirals.
</P>
<P>
   McCain and Salter obtained from the Pentagon the senator's
classified debriefing papers from when he was released. That helped
McCain to refresh his memory for the writing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked, talked and talked. We (he and Salter) are very
close,'' McCain said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   An excerpt appeared earlier this summer in ``GQ'' magazine
focusing just on McCain's dad, who was commander of U.S. forces in
the Pacific while his son was impris oned during the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Now, McCain, a presidential candidate, is preparing for a book
tour from Sept. 8-24 that will earn him invaluable free publicity
in such cities as Los Angeles, Phoenix, Boston, Chicago, Washington
and Manchester, N.H. McCain gave interviews about the book as he
toured New Hampshire this week on a campaign swing.
</P>
<P>
   McCain also recently recorded a six-hour, unabridged audio
version of the book.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; His mother, Roberta McCain, 87, who has never done a broadcast
interview, has agreed to appear soon on television with Sam
Donaldson to discuss her son and his book, the senator said. In a
rare print interview, she told ``The'' ``Arizona Republic'' this
summer that she thought her son had died when she heard that his
plane had been shot out of the sky.
</P>
<P>
   The book takes McCain, 63, from his days at the Naval Academy,
where he was rowdy and finished fifth from the bottom in his class,
to the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   At the academy, McCain tells how he ``drank a lot of beer (and)
occasionally we got in fights.''
</P>
<P>
   During those years, he once showed up for a date at a woman's
house drunk, then fell over and was sent home by the woman's
father.
</P>
<P>
   McCain describes scrambling out of a plane in July 1967 after it
was hit by a rocket that misfired on the deck of the USS Forrestal.
The subsequent fire on the deck led to a series of explosions that
killed 134 men.
</P>
<P>
   Small pieces of of shrapnel from an exploded bomb ``tore into my
legs and chest,'' McCain wrote. ``All around me was mayhem. Planes
were burning. More bombs cooked off. Body parts, pieces of the ship
and scraps of planes were dropping onto the deck.'' &QL;

ANALYSTS UPBEAT ABOUT LITTON EARNINGS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Wall Street expects Litton Industries Inc. will
post a solid gain in profits in the face of profound changes at the
high-tech conglomerate.
</P>
<P>
   The consensus of seven analysts surveyed by First Call Corp.
predicts Litton will report earnings of $1.20 a share for its
fourth quarter ended July 31, up 12 percent from the year-ago
period and excluding a previously announced $88.9 million charge to
cover the costs of leaving the commercial information-services
business.
</P>
<P>
   That would follow a 12.2 percent gain in third-quarter earnings
to $50.9 million, or $1.10 a share, on a 10.5 percent rise in
revenues to $1.26 billion. Earnings for Woodland Hills-based
Litton's fiscal year should hit $4.20, up 11.3 percent over fiscal
1998 following an 11.8 percent gain in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's pretty steady performance, and it should continue,''
noted Paul Nisbet, an analyst with JSA Research. ``We're expecting
revenue growth of 8 (percent) to 9 percent for several years and 11
percent growth in earnings, so they're going to do well but nothing
spectacular.''
</P>
<P>
   Nisbet said the remaining information-systems business should
post strong earnings gains of up to 17 percent, while electronics
growth will be 5 percent or 6 percent, and shipbuilding should be
about 5 percent. Revenues should rise about 7.5 percent
corporatewide, mostly due to contributions from newly acquired
Avondale Industries Inc.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth-quarter charge will cover costs of cutting 150 jobs,
consolidation of facilities in Litton's electronic warfare unit and
cost of Litton's guilty plea and $18.5 million penalty to settle a
federal overseas payment case.
</P>
<P>
   The report will also be the last one that does not include
contributions from New Orleans-based Avondale. Litton completed the
$529 million Avondale buyout on Aug. 2, the same day it announced
its exit from the commercial information-technology business in
favor of working for the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Litton rose 50 cents to $64.25. The issue is down 11
percent from its 1999 high of $72.4375 on July 8.

ABRACADABRA! MAKING MUSIC STILL MAGIC TO STEVE MILLER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LARRY RODGERS  
 c.1999 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his multiplatinum heyday, Steve Miller seemed to have the
magic formula for hit pop singles bottled on a shelf in his
recording studio, ready to be poured into each new album.
</P>
<P>
   Crisp guitar work, infectious lyrics and a danceable beat were
blended into such gems as ``Jet Airliner,'' ``Fly Like an Eagle,''
``Take the Money and Run'' and ``Jungle Love. ''
</P>
<P>
   Sharp production made these hits jump out of even the tinniest
car radio, and Miller _ who is on his annual summer amphitheater
tour _ became one of the most popular and well-paid rock artists of
the mid-1970s.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's probably earned as much money selling albums as
Joe Montana made playing football, don't expect Miller to wax warm
and fuzzy about record companies.
</P>
<P>
   Today's huge recording conglomerates are ``destroying careers
left and right because of their own incompetence and their
inability to represent 200 artists (simultaneously),'' Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's much better if there's a lot of small companies competing
with each other than five companies all patting each other on the
back and going, `Hey, let's corner this and screw everybody.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who's made more than 20 albums and still sells a million
discs a year, has seen the industry change over three decades.
</P>
<P>
   ``The record companies were so full of (expletive) when I was
signing with them in 1967,'' says Miller, calling from a tour stop
in Kansas City, Mo.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were racist, they stole money from people, they were
dishonest, their contracts were horrible, and it had to be
straightened out.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, a hot guitarist who was making waves with his Steve
Miller Blues Band in San Francisco at the time, says he was able to
land a lucrative record deal because 14 companies were courting
him.
</P>
<P>
   But that was hardly his ticket to a life of leisure.
</P>
<P>
   ``The guys at (Capitol Records) were all flunkies at EMI, our
lord and master in London,'' Miller says. ``They were like
vacuum-cleaner salesmen; they didn't know how to do anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The initial rough going with his label, however, had its up
side.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went to Capitol Records in LA to record my first album, and
the engineering staff walked out because I was a hippie and they
didn't want to record `that hippie,' '' Miller recalls.
</P>
<P>
   So, Miller went to England to record and later met the Beatles,
forging a lasting relationship with Paul McCartney.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's London producer, Glyn Johns, also recorded the Beatles
and invited the American to a session.
</P>
<P>
   ``So, I went down and watched John (Lennon) and Paul sing
``Don't Let Me Down'' and ``Get Back.'' ... It was the most
exciting moment of my life,'' Miller says.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Miller jammed with McCartney and George Harrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``And then George took off, and Paul and I did a tune ``(My Dark
Hour),'' and I released it on my record'' _ with McCartney listed
as ``Paul Ramon.''
</P>
<P>
   More recently, Miller and McCartney collaborated on six songs,
three of which appear on McCartney's 1997 LP, ``Flaming Pie.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller's career skyrocketed in the early '70s, when he decided
to produce his own records after six progressive rock albums had
earned critical raves but no hit singles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I decided to make my music positive and ... more upbeat,'' he
says. ``Plenty of people were covering the dark side of things. I
really like the `up' music more, and I like singing the
harmonies.''
</P>
<P>
   The result was 1973's ``The Joker,'' and its hit title track put
Miller in the ear of mainstream America. Two follow-up albums,
``Fly Like an Eagle'' and ``Book of'' ``Dreams,'' which contained
such megahits as ``Rock 'N Me, Jet Airliner ''``''and
``Swingtown,'' put Miller's bank account in the stratosphere, but
also took a toll.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there were two or three times when I just burned
out,'' Miller says. ``I remember walking off a stage in a football
stadium ... . It was like the 39th football stadium in a row at the
end of four years of non-stop touring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mad because there were `only' 40,000 people. And I gave
my guitar to my roadie and said, `I don't care if I ever do this
again.' ''
</P>
<P>
   But these days, at age 55, Miller has learned to balance touring
and his personal life, which is centered on life near Seattle with
his third wife.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've toured every year for the last 12 years, and it's great
because we've grown so much as musicians _ our tone, our chops,''
Miller says. ``I played the best guitar I've ever played the last
two gigs!
</P>
<P>
   ``There's just something in me that wants to play music. I love
doing it.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why his current outing is called ``Last Call Summer
Tour,'' Miller cheerfully clears up any doubts: ``That's the last
call for the century, the millennium. We're already planning next
year!'' &QL;

SAMPRAS INJURY PUTS NEW FACE ON MEN'S U.S. OPEN DRAW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The sad thing is that a case could be made that
what's bad for Pete Sampras is not necessarily bad for the men's
draw at the 1999 U.S. Open.
</P>
<P>
   No offense to Pistol Pete, who is a fine tennis champion. He
gets serious consideration for being the best player ever, but it
may be that Sampras has simply been the most dominating.
</P>
<P>
   In a world where the men's side of the game has morphed into
130-mph serves and one-shot rallies, the ascension and reign of
Sampras has coincided with a pounding monotony in the men's game.
</P>
<P>
   In general, artistry and groundstrokes have gone the way of
thigh-revealing double-knit shorts for the guys, except for the
rare throwbacks like Patrick Rafter, the two-time U.S. Open champ
who is also no longer in contention after withdrawing Tuesday night
due to a shoulder injury.
</P>
<P>
   And as for pop, panache or pure
McEnroe-Conners-Nastase-Vilas-type personalities, the millennium
can't come soon enough to close out these hum-drum '90s of bland,
brain-numb hardcourt automatons who have benefited from racquet
technology and suffered from a shortage of novel reading or museum
hopping.
</P>
<P>
   Now the door is open for Andre Agassi, whose capitalist-consumer
economy personality is at this time being warranted by the
once-again steady level of his play.
</P>
<P>
   Still, you have to feel for Sampras, whose drive and focus and
commitment have to be lauded, even when during the Labor Day
stretch of the U.S. Open he has helped drive potential fringe
tennis followers to revel in the start of football season.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, news that a herniated disc forced Sampras to withdraw
as the No. 1 seed from this American Grand Slam sent a ripple
through the Open, especially when there is a question about whether
the booming nature of Sampras' power game may be a culprit in this
injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm really sorry for him, and I'm sorry for tennis,'' Agassi
said of his favorite co-competitor, buddy and Nike stablemate. ``It
would have been an awesome time. It's sad. It's too bad. It really
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Everyone understands that in order for Sampras to give up this
chance to win his record-setting 13th Slam, his back must be in
very bad shape.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too bad for Pete. He's been playing the best tennis in the
world since Queens Club,'' Jim Courier said r he was ousted in his
first-round match Tuesday. ``To have your bubble burst like that,
it's tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've seen a lot of people's careers close with a back
injury, and I hope that isn't the case with Pete. But Pete's missed
a few Slams because of injuries. He's had to sit home on the couch.
It's not a lot of fun. It is what it is, though. Hopefully, he'll
back in the indoor season.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, it was not a very fun sight to see Sampras sit himself
stiffly down into a chair for a news conference at the National
Tennis Center. His usually amiable features were dark and drawn,
and that's not even taking into account the three days of beard
growth that had, surprisingly, given Sampras the suave look he has
failed to cultivate during his milk-and-cookies tenure as No. 1
tennis player in the world.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the color or personality we have witnessed from Sampras
has come from unexpected blips, like the time he was ailing and
nauseous and lost his lunch during the U.S. Open finals.
</P>
<P>
   Now, though, Sampras demanded empathy by the way disappointment
showed on his face and body, which is plagued by something much
more serious than an upset stomach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is very hard to pull out of this event,'' he said, near
tears. ``I was looking forward to having the opportunity to play
here. I love playing the U.S. Open. The way I've been playing the
last two months, I liked my chances here.''
</P>
<P>
   Sampras felt his back glitch during a practice session Sunday.
He left the court immediately, cutting his hourlong stint short and
heading straight to the doctor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was basically for the past 48 hours struggling with just
getting around my hotel room,'' he said. ``(Monday) night, I did a
few tests, CAT scan and an MRI, and it showed I have an herniated
disc.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no need for surgery, Sampras has been told, which is
good news. But it is no less daunting for an athlete like Sampras
to realize his body has betrayed him and that recovery will mean he
has to stop doing the one thing that defines him.
</P>

   ``I see myself for the next couple of weeks just getting
treatment twice a week and not doing anything. I can't do
anything,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The strange thing about this injury to the brutally dominating
and pummeling No. 1 player in the world could turn out to be that,
the closer this Open draws to its conclusion, the more everyone
might find they miss poor ol' Pistol Pete.

   We've grown accustomed to his face, even when his wearing power
game fails to enrapture.

DODGERS' MALONE SEES POSITIVE MINDSET
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Kevin Malone heard it when he became the Dodgers
general manager nearly a year ago. Manager Davey Johnson was warned
of it the day he took over, and he's had nearly six months to
experience it.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers used to do things a certain way, and lately that
wasn't cutting it, so a change was in order.
</P>
<P>
   With nearly a full season to analyze and evaluate, Malone said
the Dodgers had to break certain beliefs down before they could be
built up.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking before the Dodgers' 5-3 win over Milwaukee on Tuesday,
Malone said the iron will that was so much part of the organization
has been dissolved, and that gives hope of a quick turnaround for
the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``We needed to make some transformations and break some wills,''
Malone said. ``We needed to get people focused on what's important,
and that's winning.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the way the Dodgers have played lately, Malone believes
that has taken place. The Dodgers are long out of the playoff race,
but they entered the game with Milwaukee playing their best
baseball of the season.
</P>
<P>
   There also seems to be harmony in the clubhouse for the first
time this season, something that changed about the same time right
fielder Raul Mondesi lashed out of Johnson and Malone two weeks
ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of positive things have happened,'' Malone said. ``I
think all the players realize we have to be on the same page to
reach our goals. If you're concerned about numbers and statistics,
you're not going to win. If you're not concerned about numbers and
statistics, then winning will follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a transformation of our mindset, and I think the
players realize that. It's almost like we had to go through this to
get to where we want to go. It's almost like we had to take one
step back to take two steps toward where we want to go. We're still
breaking down barriers to where we want to go.''
</P>
<P>
   And, if the Dodgers accomplish what they want to in the
offseason, many of those barriers could crumble.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers still need a left-handed power hitter in the middle
of the lineup, a second baseman with more range and a leadoff
hitter with an on-base percentage higher than .363.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers need depth in the bullpen, options for more starting
pitchers in case another Carlos Perez situation arises and reliable
replacements in the minor leagues.
</P>
<P>
   And they need flexibility on the 40-man roster so they can
shuttle players between Los Angeles and the minors, and flexibility
with payroll so they can make trades during the season to aid a
playoff push.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we need to do,'' Malone said. ``We've known for a
while. There's a lot of work to be done. I was optimistic you could
accelerate the process. There's no easy route.''
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles found that out.
</P>
<P>
   The horrific season still has a month remaining. But what
matters now is what plans the Dodgers have for offseason
restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the team plays well until time officially runs out Oct.3
at Houston, it will be impossible to forget one of the most
miserable seasons in the Los Angeles history of the club.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers, picked by many to reach the playoffs, were 17{
games out of first place when the day began. Though they've won
lately to pull nine games under .500 at 61-70 and move into third
place, it wasn't too long ago they were 15 games under .500 and in
last place in the NL West.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're starting to see the little things, I believe,'' Malone
said. ``I'm starting to see a lot more team play, a lot more
attention to detail. Just some of the little things we need to do
to mold ourselves into a team.''

SOME QUESTION POLICE GUIDELINES ON CONFRONTATIONS WITH THE MENTALLY
ILL 
</HEADLINE>
   (With NY-POLICE-SHOOTING)  
(js) 
 By NINA BERNSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When New York City police officers confront an emotionally
disturbed person, they are required to take several clear-cut steps
under the Police Department's guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   They should back off and try to contain the situation. They
should summon supervisors and the specially trained officers of the
Emergency Services Unit. They should use physical force only to the
extent necessary to restrain the individual, and deadly force only
as a last resort, to protect the lives of officers and anyone else
at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   Officers appeared to have followed the guidelines to the letter
on Monday night, when they confronted a disturbed man wielding a
hammer in Borough Park, Brooklyn, Police Commissioner Howard Safir
said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   But some advocates for the mentally ill are questioning whether
the guidelines themselves offer adequate protections to people who
are sick and in crisis. Noting that Gidone Busch, the man with the
hammer, was the latest in a series of apparently mentally ill
people to be killed in confrontations with patrol officers, they
called for the Police Department to intensify training and improve
tactics for coping with the emotionally disturbed.
</P>
<P>
   The Police Department responded to 36,000 ``Emotionally
Disturbed Person Calls'' last year, roughly 100 a day on average,
inspector Ray McDermott, commander of the emergency service unit of
the New York City Police Department, said in a recent interview.
But only about 4,000 were handled by McDermott's unit, which
receives special training for such encounters. The other cases were
handled only by uniformed officers who were on the scene first _ as
happened Monday night in Brooklyn.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost all of these cases were resolved with very little force
being used,'' McDermott said.
</P>
<P>
   But on Monday night, the police said, efforts to defuse the
confrontation failed.
</P>
<P>
   The officers who arrived at the apartment where Busch was
staying backed off when he brandished a claw hammer, Safir said.
They called for supervisors and emergency services.
</P>
<P>
   But Busch came out the door after them, still swinging the
hammer, Safir said. Pepper spray did not stop him, and as the
officers continued backing up, one of them tripped and fell, Safir
said. When a sergeant tried to help the officer to his feet, Busch
began hitting the sergeant with his hammer, the police said. The
other officers pulled their guns, ordered Busch several times to
drop the hammer, and when he did not, they opened fire, killing
him.
</P>
<P>
   Though people sometimes ask why the police cannot disarm an
assailant by using their nightsticks or shooting an arm or a leg,
they are trained to use deadly force if they believe someone's life
is in danger.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately, Busch came running up the stairs and attacked
the police officers, and they had little choice but to defend their
lives,'' Safir said.
</P>
<P>
   Without questioning the police account of the incident, Ray
Brescia, a lawyer with the Urban Justice Center, an advocacy
organization, asked whether better police training in handling the
mentally ill might have protected everyone involved without lethal
shots being fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the mental health system shrinks, the police are filling a
critical gap whether they like it or not,'' Brescia said, calling
the city's Police Department ``the world's largest psychiatric
outreach team.'' Those first on the scene, he said, ``are
invariably beat cops who have exactly 16 hours' training in the
Police Academy on how to deal with emotionally disturbed people.''
</P>
<P>
   The police vigorously defend current practices, developed as
part of an overhaul of procedures that followed a bitter public
debate over the Eleanor Bumpurs case. Mrs. Bumpurs, a mentally
disturbed woman of 67, was shot and killed by a police officer in
1984 during an effort to evict her from her apartment.
</P>
<P>
   Recent cases included the death in October of Kevin Cerbelli, a
schizophrenic who had been in and out of Elmhurst Hospital's
psychiatric ward. He was shot to death by the police in a Queens
station house after trying to stab a sergeant with a screwdriver.
</P>
<P>
   The police and advocates for the mentally ill say that officers
are often forced to deal with these crisis situations because of
the mental health system's failures. In the case of Busch, the
details are still unclear. But Safir said ``he appears to have a
history of mental illness.''

JUDD GETS JOB DONE FOR DODGERS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Though right-hander Mike Judd has been neither
overwhelming nor eye-popping in any of his starts, he is pitching
well enough to make folks notice.
</P>
<P>
   For the third time in four starts, Judd did enough to win as the
Dodgers beat the Brewers 5-3 Tuesday night at Dodger Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have won four straight series for the first time
this season. Today, they can complete their first sweep since they
beat Seattle three straight heading into the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   ``Each one is supposed to be his last (start), and he's on his
fourth,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``I thought I'd look
at that position to give someone a spot start. I'm not saying I
won't give somebody else a chance to start before the end of the
year, but he's the best candidate here.''
</P>
<P>
   Judd (3-1) allowed three runs on seven hits, walked one and
struck out five in what is typical of his starts with the Dodgers.
The right-hander has pitched between 51/3 and 61/3 innings in each
start, but the competition wasn't the NL's strongest. He's pitched
against the Brewers twice, Florida and Montreal.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Judd's ERA is 4.94, he has kept the Dodgers in
contention, which can't be said about all their starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``He wasn't as sharp as he was the other times out, but he
managed to make the pitches when he had to,'' Johnson said. ``He
gave me a good six innings.... He's made an impression on
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   What has Judd showed in his four starts?
</P>
<P>
   ``That I deserve a shot,'' the 24-year-old rookie said. ``I have
to keep going out there every single time and go after them and not
pitch afraid. You have to use your fastball.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, if they don't want to give me a shot, then there's
not much I can do. They're in control. I'll do what they want. If I
go to the pen, I go to the pen. If they want me to start, then I'll
start. And if it's not with the Dodgers, then somebody else.''
</P>
<P>
   Viva, Las Vegas: For at least one more year, the Dodgers will
train at Dodgertown. But after that it's a crapshoot, and that
could lead them to Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers are still searching for a spring home for the 2001
season, and while a possible four-team complex in Las Vegas remains
a distant project, it is something the Dodgers will look at.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's worthwhile for us to pursue it,'' Dodgers
president and CEO Bob Graziano said. ``But a lot depends on whether
other clubs have an interest in it. It's a little more complex
situation because of the distance from the (Arizona) Cactus League
and you would need a core group of teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we're interested in, but it's a lot more
complex deal than in Florida or in Arizona.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers have had general discussions with other teams about
a complex in Las Vegas, but particulars haven't been discussed.
</P>
<P>
   Cirillo honors Sutton: Milwaukee third baseman Jeff Cirillo, a
Providence High graduate, is wearing a ``PS'' on his hat in memory
of Providence coach Paul Sutton, for whom Cirillo played.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton died Aug.19 of colon cancer at the age of 41.
</P>
<P>
   FYI: First baseman Eric Karros, who leads the team with 29
homers and 90 RBI, missed the game for personal reasons. Todd
Hollandsworth started in his place.... Johnson said right-handed
pitchers Antonio Osuna (elbow) and Robinson Checo (groin) will make
rehab appearances for Single-A San Bernardino today.... Utility
infielder Tripp Cromer will be activated for today's game. He
hasn't played since July 4 because of an irregular heart beat....
Even though rosters expand today, Johnson said Triple-A pitchers
Jamie Arnold, Carlos Perez and Jeff Williams and Double-A's Eric
Gagne won't join the Dodgers until their respective seasons end.
Also, Triple-A infielder Alex Cora will join the Dodgers in the
next week.

RED SOX BEAT ROYALS 
</HEADLINE>
 BBA-RED SOX-ROYALS-BOS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   With reinforcements pouring in from the minor leagues and the
Cubbies, the Red Sox won their fifth in a row Tuesday night,
beating the Kansas City Royals, 6-3, as pitchers Mark Portugal and
Derek Lowe made their case that Jimy Williams shouldn't stray too
far from the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox, who added third baseman Wilton Veras from Double A
Trenton to replace John Valentin (now on the disabled list), then
traded for Cubs closer Rod Beck, rallied from a 3-2 deficit to beat
the Royals for the second straight night and maintain their
two-game advantage over Oakland in the wild-card race.
</P>
<P>
   The addition of Beck could return Lowe to his previous role of
set-up man, but given Beck's uncertain health _ he had bone chips
removed from his elbow in May _ Williams probably will leave well
enough alone until (or unless) Lowe falters.
</P>
<P>
   But Lowe, who picked up his 10th save and fifth in six chances
since Tim Wakefield went back into the starting rotation, said it
makes little difference to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really care, as long as we make the playoffs,'' Lowe
said. ``I've got 10 saves this year. (Beck) had 51 last year. I
think when you acquire a closer, there's only one role a closer
does, and that's to close games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've still got to get outs. If I'm pitching in the eighth
inning, I still have to get three outs. That's not going to change.
Who said I was going to do this for the rest of my career, anyway?
This was temporary because Flash (Tom Gordon) was hurt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beck is going to help us. I think it's a great move.''
</P>
<P>
   What does Lowe know about Beck?
</P>
<P>
   ``I know he's got really long hair,'' he said. ``And a good
changeup or forkball.''
</P>
<P>
   Butch Huskey doubled in the sixth inning and scored the tying
run on a wild pitch, and the Sox seized the lead in the seventh
when Jose Offerman, still picking on his old team, doubled and
scored on a sacrifice fly by pinch hitter Mike Stanley. The Sox
added another run in the same inning when Nomar Garciaparra
singled, stole second, and scored on Troy O'Leary's ground-rule
double, and closed the scoring in the eighth on three straight
singles, the last by pinch hitter Damon Buford.
</P>
<P>
   The Sox, who had 11 hits, have not homered during their winning
streak, these five games representing their longest homerless
streak of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're winning,'' Huskey said. ``That's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Portugal, whose spot in the rotation could be in jeopardy if
Ramon Martinez proves he's healthy, had lost four in a row and five
of his last six starts, but Tuesday night took a no-hitter into the
sixth.
</P>
<P>
   He might have emerged with a win, too, if he hadn't adhered to
that baseball code _ either time-honored or hopelessly archaic _
that if the opposing pitcher hits your star player, you must
answer.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal didn't hesitate. An inning after Garciaparra was
plunked in the left arm by Royals starter Jay Witasick, Portugal's
next pitch struck Chad Kreuter in the back. The no-hitter was gone
one batter later, as Jed Hansen chopped an infield single over the
head of Donnie Sadler, the rookie third baseman who made two errors
Tuesday night in place of Valentin, who was placed on the DL with
tendinitis in his left knee.
</P>
<P>
   Four batters later, the lead was gone, too.
</P>
<P>
   A sacrifice and infield out produced one run, and a single by
Carlos Beltran tied the score at 2. Jermaine Dye then doubled off
the center-field wall to give the Royals a 3-2 lead.
</P>
<P>
   Portugal did not stick around after the game, which could mean
(a) he had people to see, (b) he was ticked at not winning, (c)
he's already been told he's going to the bullpen. The latter would
seem premature, given the uncertain nature of what Ramon Martinez
will bring to the table Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``He pitched very, very well _ extremely well,'' said catcher
Jason Varitek, whose sixth-inning ground ball to the right side put
Huskey in position to score the tying run on the wild pitch. ``He
was extremely focused on what he was doing and finishing his
pitches.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This team knows how to win,'' said Huskey. ``We're not hitting
the ball out of the ballpark but we're still coming up with runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Runs and wins, and now Beck.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you the type of dude he is,'' said Darren Lewis,
whose sacrifice bunt in the seventh put Offerman in place to score
the go-ahead run. ``He's a good guy. He's pitched in a lot of big
ballgames. He's the type of guy who's going to take the ball every
day, whether he's hurting or not.''

BIG SKY TEAMS MAKE A RUN FOR IT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three of the best single-season rushing
performances in Big Sky Conference history happened in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sacramento State's Charles Johnsonbroke the Division I-AA record
with his total of 2,260 yards. Weber State's Morgan Welch had 1,629
and wasn't even first-team all-conference; Portland State's Charles
Dunn (1,561) nudged out Welch for second team.
</P>
<P>
   Is the Big Sky shedding its image as a pass-happy conference?
Not so fast, says Eastern Washington head coach Mike Kramer, who
said the Big Sky title will come down to who has the hottest
quarterback.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's six great quarterbacks,'' Kramer said, ``and one of
those six is going to strap (his team) on his back.''
</P>
<P>
   Montana head coach Mick Dennehy, who has one of those elite six
quarterbacks in BYU transfer Drew Miller, agreed with Kramer, but
he has noticed a subtle change in philosophy. The conference's
up-and-coming programs, including the one at Cal State Northridge,
are all placing emphasis on running the ball.
</P>
<P>
   Dennehy's not worried, though. The Grizzlies, with no standout
running back, are the favorite to repeat as Big Sky winners.
</P>
<P>
   But Montana isn't reserving a spot in its trophy case yet.
Dennehy said ``four or five'' teams have a chance to win the title,
and only one team _ Idaho State, which finished last in '98 and
lost 10 starters _ isn't expected to have an impact on the title
race.
</P>
<P>
   ``The key is playing pretty steady every week,'' Dennehy said.
</P>
<P>
   EASTERN WASHINGTON  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year: Struggled to 5-6, 4-4 in the Big Sky, after going
12-2 and going to the Division I-AA playoff semifinals in '97. The
Eagles lost their four conference games by a combined 13 points. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Key returnees: Junior DL Jeff Allen; junior LB Greg Belzer;
senior OL Lance Knaevelsrud. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Key losses: OL T.J. Ackerman; RB Mike MacKenzie; KR Bashir
Levingston. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Players to watch: QB Fred Salanoa, a JC transfer from Hawaii,
was named starter in spring. Knaevelsrud (6-4, 270) leads best OL
in Big Sky. Belzer had 132 tackles last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notable note: The Eagles' close losses in the Big Sky all came
in the fourth quarter, and each time EWU had a lead, its opponent
scored on the next possession. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Contender for Big Sky title. The Eagles return a
conference-high 19 starters, including 10 on defense. Salanoa is
being counted upon to make an immediate impact. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   IDAHO STATE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year: Trying season for Bengals, who were 3-8, 2-6 and last
in the Big Sky. Head coach Tom Walsh resigned and Washington State
assistant Larry Lewis was hired. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Key returnees: Senior K Pete Garces; junior QB Shane Griggs;
junior LB Jason Meador. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Key losses: WR-KR DeRonn Finley; RB Craig Joseph; DB Jason
Trotter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Players to watch: Griggs and sophomore Kevin McCarthy are
fighting to be starting QB. Garces was the CBS Sportsline Division
I-AA kicker of year last year after going 13 of 18. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notable note: Jacori Rufus, a starting DB last year, was killed
in a car accident in March. No Bengal will wear Rufus' No.26 until
after the 2001 season, which would have been Rufus' senior year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outlook Not good. The Bengals have had just two winning seasons
in the last 15 years. Finley, an all-conference KR, is out for the
season because of injuries he received in the crash that killed
Rufus. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MONTANA  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year: Won share of Big Sky title and went to Division I-AA
playoffs at 8-3. Crushed by Western Illinois 52-9 in first round. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Key returnees: Junior DL Tyler Martin; senior WR Jeremy Watkins;
senior LB Marcus Wilson. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Key losses: QB Brian Ah Yat; OL Scott Curry; OL Randy Allik. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Players to watch: Drew Miller, a junior transfer from BYU, is
the next great Grizzlies QB. Watkins was first-team All-Big Sky
last year. Wilson has started 21 of UM's last 22 games. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notable note: Their playoff loss last year was the Grizzlies'
worst in school history. UM trailed 31-0 in the second quarter. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: UM returns 19 starters, including 10 on defense, and
Miller is one of the Big Sky's most exciting newcomers. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   MONTANA STATE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year: Went 7-4, 5-3 in conference despite losing two of
final three games, including season finale to rival Montana. &QL;
</P>
<P>

senior OL Brent Ludwig. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Key losses: QB Rob Compson; LB Kevin Lundstrom; DL Ty O'Connor. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Players to watch: Flores, first-team All-Big Sky last year, had
20 tackles against CSUN last year. Hobbs should break school record
for career receiving yards. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notable note: MSU's win total in '98 was its best since 1984.
The Bobcats also have three consecutive winning seasons for first
time in I-AA. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outlook Contender for Big Sky title. The conference championship
could come down to the Bobcats' Nov.20 home game against Montana.
MSU hasn't beaten its rival in 14 years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   NORTHERN ARIZONA  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year: Won final two games to finish 6-5 and finish over
.500 for sixth consecutive year. Only 3-5 in Big Sky. &QL;

</P>
<P>
   Players to watch: Junior RB Ronney Jenkins, a transfer from BYU,
rushed for 1,307 yards last year. Brown has passed for more than
300 yards in a game 13 times. Crissup is three-time All-Big Sky
academic selection. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notable note: Head coach Jerome Souers picked himself as the
Lumberjacks' new defensive coordinator. Souers was the defensive
coordinator at Montana for eight years before going to NAU in '98. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outlook The Lumberjacks took their lumps last year, including a
41-10 loss at home to CSUN, but Jenkins should keep them in the
race for the Big Sky title. Faraimo tore ACL last week and is lost
for the season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PORTLAND STATE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year: Had four-game win streak at midseason, then lost last

</P>
<P>
   Players to watch: Blanchard led I-AA in passing efficiency
(167.58) last year. Dunn had 1,561 yards last year and was team
MVP. Bryant led Big Sky with 1,092 yards last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notable note: Vikings have improved each year since they joined
the Big Sky, going from three wins in '96 to five wins last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Darkhorse contender in title chase if defense improves.
PSU was second in Big Sky in scoring offense last year but eighth
in scoring defense. Also had bad turnover ratio last year. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   SACRAMENTO STATE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year: Rebounded from back-to-back one-win seasons to go
5-6, 3-5 in conference. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Key returnees: Senior OL Jon Osterhout; junior RB Charles
Roberts; OL Terence Wagner. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Key losses: LB Ryland Wickman; DL Dustin Smith; P Steve Thorns. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Players to watch: Roberts set a I-AA record with 2,260 yards
last year and scored 20 TDs. He had the third-best single season by
any Division I RB. Osterhout was first-team All-Big Sky. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notable note: The Hornets' defense ranked ninth in I-AA last
year in turnover margin and ranked in the Big Sky's top four in six
categories. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Intriguing. Some feel the conference was down last
year, diminishing the Hornets' improvement. But the offense returns
10 starters, including entire offensive line. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   WEBER STATE  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Last year: Won first five games, then lost five in a row before
beating rival Eastern Washington to finish 6-5, 4-4 in Big Sky. &QL;

   Key returnees: Senior DB Wade Davis; senior RB Derek Poole;
senior RB Morgan Welch. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Key losses: DE Brian Edmisten; DB Scott Shields; LB David
Stroshine. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Players to watch: Welch rushed for a school-record 1,629 yards
in '98, but Poole's return from redshirt season gives Wildcats a
1-2 punch. Davis had 3 INTs last year and becomes leader in
secondary. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Notable note: Shields, who finished his career with 23 INTs, was
Wildcats' first Big Sky Defensive Player of the Year since 1980. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Outlook: Middle-of-the-pack finish in Big Sky unless WSU makes
major defensive strides. Wildcats lost eight starters from defense
that was best in conference last year.

NORTHRIDGE DEFENSE LESS RISKY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CHRIS BRANAM  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Three times the opposing offense went for the home
run _ and got it _ in Cal State Northridge's first three football
games last year.
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors gave up a 79-yard touchdown pass in the opener
against Boise State, then allowed Eastern Washington to score on
passes of 96 and 60 yards. CSUN gave up five passing touchdowns of
46 yards or more in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   With Kansas looming on Sept.11 and Eastern Washington on
Sept.25, CSUN is planning a more conservative defensive approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew going in (last season) that we were going to play a
high-risk secondary,'' CSUN defensive coordinator Foster Andersen
said last week. ``We had to play a lot of man-to-man. Cornerbacks
get beat... it happens. Mike Haynes gave up touchdowns. Lester
Hayes gave up touchdowns.''
</P>
<P>
   The Matadors' secondary has come together slowly. Hassan
Abdul-Malik, the projected starting free safety, missed most of
camp with a strained hamstring. Mel Miller, a senior cornerback
with two years of experience starting in the Pac-10 at Washington,
missed almost half the practices while finishing an independent
study course.
</P>
<P>
   Miller hasn't been cleared to play against Western Oregon on
Saturday in the season opener.
</P>
<P>
   Facing sophomore quarterback Marcus Brady, the Big Sky Newcomer
of the Year in '98, day after day in passing drills has shown the
secondary where it needs help.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marcus is probably the best quarterback in the conference,''
defensive backs coach Brent Huff said. ``We get excited. That rises
our play all the more. It's good to have a guy like (Brady),
because you know you have to be ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Lack of morale in facing Brady every day is not a problem _
among the starters.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our starters think they can go out there and shut down our
passing offense,'' Andersen said. ``They're ambitious, which is
good.''
</P>
<P>
   Addition, subtraction: Abdul-Malik was in uniform Tuesday for
the first time since his injury on Aug. 16.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked good and had fresh legs,'' CSUN interim head coach
Jeff Kearin said of Abdul-Malik, who started one game last year and
made 15 tackles.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, however, missed practice. Kearin said he's more
concerned about having Miller available for Big Sky Conference
games.
</P>
<P>
   Confidence man: Senior linebacker Kaleon Green's eligibility
remains uncertain, but at least there are no shortages of
linebackers on the team. If Green isn't cleared to play against
Western Oregon, linebackers coach Terrance Johnson said, the
Matadors can plug in Jack Heaslet, a senior who had 35 tackles last
year.
</P>
<P>
   Back in action: Wide receiver Ethan Beck, the Big Sky's leading
punter last year with a 40-yard average, was in uniform for the
first time since pulling a groin muscle two weeks ago.

SOLIAH TO BE TRIED AS SARA JANE OLSON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DOUGLAS HABERMAN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Former Palmdale resident Kathleen Soliah won
permission to be tried as Sara Jane Olson on the 1976 charges that
she conspired with the Symbionese Liberation Army to kill Los
Angeles police officers.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles Superior Court Judge Larry Paul Fidler granted a
defense request to officially list the former fugitive as Olson,
the name she has lived under as a doctor's wife and mother of three
children in St. Paul, Minn. Court documents will now show she is
``also known as Kathleen Soliah,'' Fidler decided.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI arrested Olson in Minnesota on June 16 after an episode
of ``America's Most Wanted'' aired the story of her flight from
justice.
</P>
<P>
   Out of jail since July 20 on $1 million bail raised from
friends, neighbors and supporters around the country, Olson
attended Tuesday's hearing with her husband, Dr. Gerald ``Fred''
Peterson, in the criminal courts building downtown. At her home in
Minnesota, court-ordered video monitoring devices keep track of
her.
</P>
<P>
   After defense attorneys rejected one judge because he is a
former Los Angeles police officer, Superior Court Judge James
Ideman was assigned to preside over the trial. A hearing to set a
trial date was set for Sept. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Olson's San Francisco-based defense attorneys, Susan Jordan and
Stuart Hanlon, told reporters at a news conference after Tuesday's
court hearing that they expect a trial before year's end.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're very anxious to try the case,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Olson is ``anxious to get the matter behind her .
. . and go back to her regular, exemplary life,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's innocent.
</P>
<P>
   The evidence includes a fingerprint of Olson's found at a Bay
Area house where the SLA made bombs, said District Attorney's
Office spokeswoman Sandi Gibbons. Prosecutors haven't revealed what
evidence ties Olson directly to the August 1975 attempted bombings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't discuss specifics of evidence,'' Gibbons said. The two
bombs are in LAPD custody, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Olson faces a sentence of life in prison with the possibility of
parole if she's convicted of all five counts against her stemming
from the August 1975 attempted bombings, said Gibbons.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether heiress Patty Hearst would be called as a witness,
Jordan and Hanlon said that will be up to the prosecution. The SLA
kidnapped Hearst in February 1974 but she later participated in a
bank holdup with the group, was arrested and convicted and spent
two years in prison. She is reportedly reluctant to testify.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I think it would be awful to make her testify if
she's reluctant,'' Jordan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have mentioned in court that Hearst is a potential
witness,'' Gibbons said, adding that the District Attorney's Office
can't say yet whether it will call her or not.

FAST_GROWING BUSINESS SECTOR UPBEAT ABOUT GROWTH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY JASON TAKENOUCHI  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES -- Latino-owned firms, already among the
fastest-growing business segments in Southern California, may be
the most optimistic as well, according to a study released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The study of large Latino businesses by the nonprofit Tomas
Rivera Policy Institute found that nearly 74 percent of those firms
expect sales to grow in the next year. Only 1 percent said they
anticipate a decline.
</P>
<P>
   The survey was based on responses from 273 Southern California
businesses with sales of $1 million or more and a majority of
Latino ownership. The Latin Business Association commissioned the
survey in conjunction with its fourth annual Latino Business Expo
at the Los Angeles Convention Center, which opens Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Waldo Lopez-Aqueres, director of economic policy research for
the institute, which is affiliated with the Claremont Graduate
University, said the health of larger Latino-owned companies is an
important indicator of the broader market.
</P>
<P>
   Although only about 1 percent of Latino-owned firms have sales
greater than $1 million, those firms account for nearly half of
sales and employment, according to Lopez-Aqueres.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very important segment,'' he said. ``It's dynamic. It
has longevity.''
</P>
<P>
   Latino-owned firms may have good reason to be bullish on the
future.
</P>
<P>
   The rapid growth of the Latino population and support networks
for Latino-owned businesses _ including trade associations _ are
giving those firms a strong foundation for success, said John
Tumpak, a spokesman for the Los Angeles office of the U.S. Small
Business Administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole outlook for Hispanic-owned small businesses is
better than it has ever been,'' Tumpak said.
</P>
<P>
   Among the study's other findings:
</P>
<P>
   Extrapolating from 1987-1992 government data, the study
estimated that the number of Latino-owned firms in Southern
California grew by more than 150 percent between 1992 and 1999. The
current total, the study estimated, is around 440,000.
</P>
<P>
   About 63 percent of firms surveyed offer health benefits to
their employees.
</P>
<P>
   Firms in the survey with mostly Latino work forces were less
likely than others to offer life insurance, health insurance or
401(k) plans to their employees.

HOW DID MAYOR'S PANEL EARN ITS BLUE RIBBON?
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     By SCOTT OSTLER 
 &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ One question I hope will be answered by Willie
Brown's blue-ribbon panel, appointed by the mayor to investigate
what the FBI has been investigating for several months, is how the
panel got its blue ribbon.
</P>
<P>
   Fattest pig at the county fair? Fastest car in the Pinewood
Derby?
</P>
<P>
   I worry about a panel that claims to have a blue ribbon before
it has whacked its first gavel.
</P>
<P>
   If it does a great job, does the blue-ribbon panel get upgraded
to platinum?
</P>
<P>
   The mayor has vowed to leave no stone unturned, and what's
underneath should keep biologists busy for months.
</P>
<P>
   That vow reminds my pal Lotta Dotz of the credo of the local
fitness community: Leave no stern un-toned.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, there's no gain without pain. Your goal is buns of
steel, but sometimes, you wind up with your ass in a sling.
</P>
<P>
   And since the mayor's panel has been impaneled to investigate
the alleged wrongdoings in several city agencies headed by mayoral
appointees, not to mention some key people fairly close to the
mayor, the next question is:
</P>
<P>
   Will we eventually need a blue-ribbon panel to investigate the
blue-ribbon panel?
</P>
<P>
   UNCLEAR on the concept: You know those public trash cans that
have a wire bin at the top for bottles, cans and other recyclables?
</P>
<P>
   Alma O'Brien, strolling near Geary and 21st, wonders what part
of the system the collection guys don't understand. She saw a
Sunset Scavenger truck crew dump the contents of the wire basket
into the trash bin, then dump everything into the truck.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe they sort it all out later, during their lunch break.
</P>
<P>
   DON'T BRING me your lame excuses for being tardy, Rosemary
Jacobs warned her English students last week on the first day of
class at Washington High.
</P>
<P>
   On the second day, student John Doe was late and presented
Jacobs with a note from the traffic cop who gave John a speeding
ticket on the way to school. ``Dear Teacher, please excuse John
...''
</P>
<P>
   There's a lesson there somewhere.
</P>
<P>
   JUST WHEN so many people are asking, ``How come there's no
Industrial Gothic Fetish Dance Night?'' the Blue Lagoon in Santa
Cruz steps up to fill the void on Monday nights.
</P>
<P>
   So if you're bored with the polka ...
</P>
<P>
   And it's got to be more interesting than Monday Night Practice
Football, 49ers' Third Stringers vs. Raiders' Wannabees.
</P>
<P>
   Where do ticket holders from that game go to get refunds for a
game between bitter rivals who exhibited no bitterness and inspired
no exciting brawls in the stands or parking lots?
</P>
<P>
   If you bought tickets for that game, pal, send me $5, and I'll
send you a ticket to watch the blip-races on the radar screen some
morning in Muni's Metro-tracking control room ($7 for VIP seating).
</P>
<P>
   YOU COULD SEE more exciting football in Y.A. Tittle's backyard.
</P>
<P>
   The former 49ers quarterback, now an insurance exec who lives in
Atherton, was tossing the old pigskin around his lawn with Gary
Ross, a general contractor. Tittle hit Ross with a dozen
consecutive perfecto spiral bullets.
</P>
<P>
   And Y.A. is 72 damn years old.
</P>
<P>
   You know, the Niners  &UR; do  &LR; need a reliable backup QB. And Y.A. is
already insured.
</P>
<P>
   CHEAP PUBLICITY stunts aren't dead. They're not even cheap.
</P>
<P>
   The St. Francis Hotel kicked out the jams Tuesday to announce
the equipping of all Westin hotel rooms with a new kind of bed so
comfortable that you won't want to get out of it, and probably
couldn't if you wanted to.
</P>
<P>
   My belief (possibly my only one) is that the last thing a hotel
needs is comfortable beds. Traveler, if you haven't worked hard
enough or played hard enough to sleep like a baby on the cold
bathroom tile, you've been cheating yourself and /or your boss.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, the Harlem Gospel Singers sang at the press conference,
and Willie Brown Himself dropped by.
</P>
<P>
   Not that Willie would know about beds. He once told me he sleeps
four hours per night, and my guess is that he does it standing up,
so as not to wrinkle his jammies.

 &HT;    Coke, ESPN unveil Super Bowl strategy
 &HT;    By Henry Unger
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Coca-Cola Co. and ESPN cable sports network are
planning a big splash leading up to the Super Bowl in Atlanta with
a week of live shows at the World of Coca-Cola.
</P>
<P>
   During the week preceding the Jan. 30 game, the beverage giant
and ESPN will be setting up two temporary TV studios, as well as a
football festival area between the downtown Coke attraction and
nearby Georgia Railroad Freight Depot.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of viewers will be tuning in during the buildup to pro
football's crowning event as Coke hosts three ESPN shows:
SportsCenter, NFL 2Night and NFL Countdown.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, thousands of fans who will never get the chance to
see the big game at the Georgia Dome are expected to congregate at
the World of Coke, tossing footballs, watching on-air personalities
such as Chris Berman and Tom Jackson, and, of course, drinking
Coke.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, metro Atlantans will get the chance to win ESPN studio
tickets starting in October, when Coca-Cola launches a special
local promotion tied to its premier brand, Coke Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all had an opportunity to see what Coke can do around big
events, and this is yet another example of what they're able to do
to enhance the experience for visitors, as well as people who live
here,'' said Robert Dale Morgan, president of the Metro Atlanta
Super Bowl XXXIV Host Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you watch what Coke does around mega-events, you can see
why they are regarded as the best marketer in the world,'' Morgan
said.
</P>
<P>
   That marketer has been planning its Super Bowl strategy for more
than a year, and its partnership with ESPN is the centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not about being red. It's about being relevant,'' said
Steve Koonin, vice president of consumer marketing and the
architect of the program. ``We want to give people in Atlanta
access to the Super Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   Koonin is a strong believer that ``presence marketing'' _ giving
fans and consumers an experience to remember _ is one of the keys
to driving beverage sales. In fact, the company has no plans to
advertise during the game, when a 30-second spot will run about
$1.6 million, he said.
</P>
<P>
   For the last several Super Bowls, Koonin said, Coca-Cola has
seen its biggest domestic sales boost for the first quarter in the
game's host city.
</P>
<P>
   He said that is largely because of all the resources the company
pours into trying to make the game memorable for as many fans as
possible. Fans who do not win studio tickets to the ESPN shows will
be able to see the live broadcasts on a jumbo screen in the World
of Coke's plaza area.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 15,000 to 40,000 people go to Super Bowl cities without
ever planning to get a game ticket,'' said Morgan, of the Host
Committee. ``With Coke doing this, it gives Atlanta another dynamic
happening downtown.''
</P>
<P>
   The events are also likely to give a needed attendance pop to
Underground Atlanta, which is located right next to the World of
Coke.
</P>
<P>
   ESPN said it tries to pick Super Bowl broadcasting sites that
reflect the host city. One of the TV studios will be constructed
just outside the World of Coke, while the other will be stationed
inside the Georgia Railroad Freight Depot.
</P>
<P>
   ``You try to give people a sense of where you are,'' said Bob
Rauscher, a senior producer at ESPN. ``It's Coke's town.''
</P>
<P>
   Disney-owned ESPN will not be broadcasting the game. That will
be done by ABC, which Disney also owns.

 &HT;    Judge denies eagle feathers for Fla. man's Indian ceremonies
 &HT;    By Scott Hiaasen
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ There is no doubt that Harvey ``Fire
Bird'' Gibson is a Creek Indian, no less native to America than a
Seminole or a Sioux.
</P>
<P>
   But the Delray Beach man's request to own eagle feathers for
religious ceremonies has been denied by a federal judge who said it
would violate a law designed in part to nurture American Indian
customs and ceremonies.
</P>
<P>
   Gibson, 68, filed a lawsuit four years ago against the federal
government seeking to obtain five eagle feathers for daily prayers,
death ceremonies and other spiritual rites. The lawsuit forced the
court to unravel the knot where issues of American Indian rights
meet with conservation laws.
</P>
<P>
   Bald and golden eagles are protected by law, and possession of
one alive or dead is a crime. Eagle feathers and talons are also
considered sacred to many Native American tribes. The government
allows tribes to obtain eagle feathers for ceremonies, but only
from a repository for eagle parts in Colorado.
</P>
<P>
   But Gibson can't get any feathers because his branch of the
Creeks _ those that stayed east while the rest of the tribe was
driven west by white settlers in the 1830s _ is not among the 550
tribes formally recognized by the government.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, U.S. District Judge Daniel T.K. Hurley said that
distinction, which Gibson calls unfair, is necessary to protect the
stock of eagle parts for all tribes, and to maintain the
government's Indian treaties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Providing bald and golden eagle parts to members of federally
recognized tribes is an important step toward preserving the
religious heritage of Native Americans,'' Hurley wrote in his
ruling. ``Allowing members of non-federally recognized Indian
tribes to apply for eagle parts would create difficult issues of
proof that would significantly inhibit the implementation of the
regulation.''
</P>
<P>
   But the judge did not question Gibson's sincerity, saying he is
``truly deserving'' of the feathers, and calling Gibson's current
practice of using turkey feathers ``akin to using colored water for
sacramental wine.''
</P>
<P>
   Gibson has appealed the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the only people in the world that have to walk around
with an ID card saying we are Indian,'' Gibson said Tuesday. ``They
can write all the laws in the world but they can't change my
blood.''

 &HT;    Doing the crime but not the time
 &HT;    By Stebbins Jefferson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Did he or didn't he? Only Gov. George W.
Bush knows for sure, and he isn't telling. At least not everything
curious minds want to know.
</P>
<P>
   The governor of Texas and would-be next president says he hasn't
taken drugs in 25 years. That leaves 28 years of his life
unaccounted for. Let's consider that during that youthful period he
tried cocaine. Let's suppose, as his hemming and hawing suggests,
he indulged in this illegal drug for recreation and overcame this
problem. He admits that drawing upon religious faith, he summoned
the resolve to give up drinking in 1986. Perhaps the same source of
strength worked against illegal drugs. Whatever the reason he
gained total sobriety, he declares he's been clean of drug use for
over two decades. Parents and loved ones of other youthful drug
users who took a playful walk on the wild side and got stuck there
applaud Mr. Bush's achievement and want a national drug policy that
will help rescue more of their kind who slipped along the way.
</P>
<P>
   We are told that baby boomers who experimented with marijuana
and cocaine and survived the experience without permanent addiction
are faced with the dilemma of whether to admit to their kids that
they used illegal drugs. Gov. Bush advises against such candor. He
says confession would ``send a signal that whatever I may have done
is OK.''
</P>
<P>
   Moral standards would be sacrificed, he would have us believe,
as kids would mistakenly conclude playing around with drugs is just
another inconsequential rite of passage. Like most of us, he knows
that error could be fatal. Most illegal drugs are illegal because
of their potential powers to permanently ensnare their hosts and
destroy abilities to function except to satisfy cravings.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, the newsworthy story is not whether Mr. Bush has ever used
cocaine nor that those who question him are indulging in what he
calls ``the politics of personal destruction.'' The issue that
needs to be acknowledged is our society has accepted illegal drug
use as a risky behavior to be condemned and punished only if
discovered among average citizens and to be tolerated and winked at
among people of wealth and status.
</P>
<P>
   This hypocrisy has sabotaged the war on drugs. Mr. Bush's
example only affirms the reality that a George W. Bush can walk
away from cocaine to lead a state and possibly a country. A John
Doe who uses and becomes mired in the drug culture inherits a more
ominous fate. Yet, undeniably, both users created the drug market
and caused the industry to grow into a lucrative business that
spawns crime from mean streets to banking corporations and beyond.
An affluent Mr. Bush has the resources and connections to fight his
drug problem in private. An impoverished Mr. Doe is more likely to
be incarcerated and tagged with a criminal record that limits
employment possibilities. Any attempt to rid our society of drugs
must address this double standard.
</P>
<P>
   Our children (who can cite a litany of the rich and famous who
pass through the Betty Ford Clinic) know the legal system rarely
severely punishes drug offenders with social status. That
knowledge, more than any confessions by parents, instructs that
drug use is OK.
</P>
<P>
   The exquisite irony is that the way our system works, the drug
experimenters who go unpunished for their drug offenses often gain
positions that allow them to design the punishment for those who
get caught. So far, having been there, done that, has not
influenced compassion. In 1997, Gov. Bush signed a provision
authorizing Texas judges to jail people convicted of possessing or
selling less than one gram (1/28th of an ounce) of cocaine. A
tough-on-crime reputation wins votes. As does a national drug
policy to build more prisons to hold nonviolent, small-time drug
users and sellers. The dominant and ineffectual strategy of our
drug war is to attack the addicted foot soldiers, leaving the
officers untouched and the infrastructure intact.
</P>
<P>
   The newsworthy story, if we would focus on it, is not politics
as usual, but the political manipulation of drug policy to gain
votes instead of solve the problem.

 &HT;    Tapping the reed-whistlers for `The Remote'
 &HT;    By John Kelso
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ I've begun the push to attract musical and dance
support from the Austin arts community for my upcoming spoken word
and dance production, ``The Remote.''
</P>
<P>
   If you ain't got no artists, you ain't got no art, right?
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, I fired off the following letter to Peggy Gunn,
development director of the Austin Symphony in hopes of getting
those reed-whistlers involved in the project. Here's the letter:
</P>
<P>
   ``Dear Ms. Gunn:
</P>
<P>
   ``On Friday, Nov. 26, on a vacant lot next to the Hog-Eye Bait
House on Lake Walter E. Long, if all goes according to plan, 100
men will sit in recliners watching the Texas-Texas A&AMP;M game on
television as part of a male statement spoken word and dance
performance.
</P>
<P>
   ``To date we have lined up the Blazing Bows, a group of fiddlers
ages 5 to 16 taught by Mary Hattersley, to play 'Are You Ready for
Some Football,' the Hank Williams Jr. classic heard Monday nights
across America. We would be honored to have Austin Symphony
Director Peter Bay and an ensemble of 8-10 pieces from the symphony
accompany the youngsters.
</P>
<P>
   ``The kickoff is at 10 a.m. There will be rehearsals _ well, OK,
maybe a rehearsal _ before the actual event is held. (The rehearsal
date has yet to be determined.) Kinky Friedman says he will attend
a rehearsal. We are still looking for a choreographer. We hope to
find someone from the University of Texas in a ponytail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks for your interest in this artistic endeavor. We surely
would appreciate the symphony's help in this matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sincerely,
</P>
<P>
   ``John Kelso''
</P>
<P>
   I wait anxiously for a reply from the symphony. And if any of
you guys who dance on your toes want to help out, give me a holler.
</P>
<P>
   We are asking guys who take part in the TV watching part of
``The Remote'' to please bring their own recliners.
</P>
<P>
   Now, some of you men who plan to sit around watching football in
``The Remote'' may be thinking about buying the revolutionary $899
La-Z-Boy recliner with the beer cooler built into the arm.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I don't think I would buy this chair. Unless you are
a wienie, the cooler, built into the chair's left arm, doesn't hold
enough beer to get you through a football game.
</P>
<P>
   The cooler holds just six 12-ounce cans.
</P>
<P>
   If your brother-in-law is sitting within reaching distance of
your La-Z-Boy, that's only enough beer to make it through the first
quarter.
</P>
<P>
   What was La-Z-Boy thinking when it designed this chair cooler? I
thought the concept here _ a major part of the American dream _ was
to create a chair that makes it possible for men to watch an entire
game without having to go to the kitchen.
</P>
<P>
   This chair needs help. In fact, not only does the cooler hold
just six 12-ounce cans, it isn't even deep enough to squeeze in a
12-ounce longneck in the upright position.
</P>
<P>
   If the La-Z-Boy engineers didn't have prunes for brains, they
would have created a chair with a keg in each arm, a chair that
comes with a ``trucker's friend'' so that you never have to leave
the chair, unless you are being subpoenaed.
</P>
<P>
   I'll keep you informed on the details of ``The Remote.''
Meanwhile, watch plenty of football so you can get in shape for the
big day.

 &HT;    Stewart family's `adventure' leaves a sea-sick feeling
 &HT;    By Mary McCarty
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ As a community, our reaction to the safe return
of the Stewart family resembles that of parents of errant
teen-agers who came home too late from a party they weren't allowed
to attend in the first place.
</P>
<P>
   First, we want to hug them: Thank God, you're home, safe and
sound.
</P>
<P>
   Next, we want to scold them: What on earth were you thinking,
going off adventuring in a marginally seaworthy ship? Taking your
two children with you? Do you have any idea how worried we were?
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, though, you can't be too hard on the Stewart
family. They're merely reflecting a culture in which a popular
T-shirt boasts ``No Fear.'' A culture in which we expect nature to
be a playground for our adventures, prepackaged with thrills but no
danger.
</P>
<P>
   We are amazed when small planes crash in bad weather.
</P>
<P>
   We are amazed when gravity-defying amusement park rides
malfunction and claim lives.
</P>
<P>
   We are amazed when an extreme sport such as canyoning _ which,
as best I can tell from the diagram, involves roping down into a
river gorge and leaping from rock to rock like crazed frogs _ turns
deadly in Switzerland, claiming 19 tourists in a flash flood. How
could it happen? Hadn't they paid exorbitant fees to a reputable
``adventure company''?
</P>
<P>
   If we pay enough money, we reason, nature's ride should come
absolutely risk-free.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of us are moving into the adventure of our lives,''
Richard Stewart wrote in an e-mail to the online Aboard Magazine.
``See you on the high seas!''
</P>
<P>
   Parents traditionally provide the voice of reason, of restraint,
the ones pulling in the reins on their coltishly reckless children.
More and more, in the baby boomer generation, we are seeing the
reverse: It was Lloyd Dubroff, remember, who encouraged his
7-year-old daughter, Jessica _ four-foot-two, 55 pounds _ to pursue
``her'' dream of becoming the youngest person to fly across the
country.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, all parents must perform a delicate dance between
caretaker and killjoy, a careful risktaker and a careless gambler.
No doubt I'm one of those parents who errs on the side of caution.
``Oh, Mom,'' my son complained recently, when I unreasonably
refused to let him play outside in a lightning storm, ``you're so
overprotective.''
</P>
<P>
   Go ahead, kid, hurt my feelings. Certainly nobody could accuse
the Stewarts of being overprotective, sailing off without a float
plan on a boat that had been grounded by engine trouble for the
previous month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had a ball,'' Richard said of the month the family spent
oblivious to the Coast Guard's three-day, $75,000 search and the
frantic state of relatives on shore.
</P>
<P>
   Even after the Jolly Joyce had sent the Coast Guard on a
not-so-jolly chase, Richard Stewart vowed to come in on his own
power and made light of the Coast Guard's request to call in every
30 minutes. ``We'd gone 900 miles on our own. If we would get to
shore we're going to do it on our own,'' his wife, Debra, quoted
him as saying.
</P>
<P>
   Nature interfered, as nature has a way of doing. The Jolly
Joyce, after losing all steering and the use of its engines, was
towed in by a 47-foot motor lifeboat.
</P>
<P>
   Carter Stewart, Richard's 27-year-old son, referred questions to
his father and stepmother: ``It's their drama, let them act in
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, these dramas don't take place on an empty stage.
In this case, a 12-year-old and a 16-year-old were dragged into the
cast, not to mention dozens of Coast Guard rescuers and an anxious
community.
</P>
<P>
   The ending may be a happy one, but it leaves those of us on
shore with a queasy feeling.

 &HT;    No more same ol' same ol'
 &HT;    By Rowland Nethaway

<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ ``Politics should be put aside. Either Congress or
the president should initiate an independent investigation into an
event that began and ended in tragedy.''
</P>
<P>
   I wrote those words in a column on April 20, 1993, while the
embers that covered the charred bodies of 76 men, women and
children at the Branch Davidians' Mount Carmel compound still
smoldered.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's spin doctors and wind testers warned him to keep a low
profile. Let Attorney
</P>
<P>
   General Janet Reno, Treasury Secretary Lloyd Bentsen and others
fade the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Congress also laid low following the fatally botched Feb. 28
Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms raid and during the 51-day FBI siege.
</P>
<P>
   Unable to spot a political advantage, Congress members
studiously avoided an incident
</P>
<P>
   that had gathered a worldwide audience, including a swelling of
hard-core anti-government conspiracy nuts.
</P>
<P>
   After Reno's decision to cut off negotiations and gas the
compound went terribly wrong,
</P>
<P>
   Republicans suddenly wanted to launch congressional probes to
embarrass Clinton and his
</P>
<P>
   new administration.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress was involved in a head-butting standoff, Bentsen
was the only person in
</P>
<P>
   Washington with the backbone to do what was right for the
country. He ordered an independent investigation of ATF actions at
Mount Carmel.
</P>
<P>
   Reno, either on her own or as a result of her endless supply of
bad advice, decided to investigate herself and the FBI, which
reports to her.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's self-investigation turned out to be an obvious whitewash.
Now that new evidence reveals that Reno and FBI officials misled
Congress and the public, Republicans again see
</P>
<P>
   a chance to embarrass Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has promised a new self-investigation. Clinton has issued
more platitudes and again
</P>
<P>
   retreated behind Reno's skirt.
</P>
<P>
   Same ol', same ol'.
</P>
<P>
   It's a waste of time, if not delusional, to ask Congress to
conduct a fair, impartial and nonpartisan investigation.
</P>
<P>
   There is only one way for the American public to ever receive a
credible report about what really happened leading up to the
decision to initiate the botched ATF raid and the
</P>
<P>
   decisions and actions that culminated in the deadly April 19
inferno.
</P>
<P>
   There needs to be a groundswell of public sentiment for an
independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Such a groundswell would be picked up immediately by the instant
and omnipresent public
</P>
<P>
   opinion polls that substitute for principled decisions by
today's Washington politicians.
</P>
<P>
   What is needed is an independent panel that investigates and
reports on the entire series of events pertaining to government
actions involving the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation first needs to examine government decisions to
ignore reports of statutory rape, physical and psychological abuse
of children, polygamy and sham marriages within the cult. Those
reports and government decisions to ignore them were made two years
before the initial raid.
</P>
<P>
   The role of the military needs to be investigated since it
relied on baseless evidence of a
</P>
<P>
   methamphetamine lab at Mount Carmel. The meth lab evidence was
an obvious ruse that
</P>
<P>
   was used right up to the very end to justify assistance from the
super-secret Delta Force,
</P>
<P>
   whose commandos were at the scene the final day.
</P>
<P>
   Who made off with the steel front door of the building, and why?
Was Reno really misinformed time after time? If so, who is
responsible?
</P>
<P>
   Without this sort of top-to-bottom impartial investigation,
conspiracy nuts will thrive while the credibility in critical
government operations will wither.

 &HT;    Splendor in the grass
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ Craig and Valerie Coleman, who had their new
house built in 1997, give some of the credit for the lush lawn to
neighbors who built in their subdivision before them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our neighbors encouraged us to get a sprinkler system, and we
did,'' Craig Coleman said. ``It comes on at about 4 a.m. and sprays
each zone in the yard for about 25 minutes.''
</P>
<P>
   Coleman said his experienced neighbors also suggested that he
find a commercial building site and ask the builders for topsoil.
He hired a truck and collected topsoil from the site of a nearby
Target store.
</P>
<P>
   ``They let me take away 10 truckloads of soil,'' he said. ``I
only paid a couple hundred dollars for the truck and a driver.''
</P>
<P>
   The Coleman family succeeded in establishing their lawn by
tackling two major problems that can stymie grass growth:
inadequate water and poor soil.
</P>
<P>
   Many people choose not to water their lawns in summer, allowing
them to go tan and dormant. Others have watered, maybe sporadically
or improperly, and their lawns are still in bad shape as a dry, hot
summer draws to a close.
</P>
<P>
   And still others have lawn problems unrelated to the heat, such
as shady patches that won't grow or heavy-traffic spots that are
worn bald.
</P>
<P>
   Mid- to late September and early October are good times for lawn
repair or replacement. A lawn and garden worker is a good source of
detailed information on improving your lawn, but we'll give you a
few guidelines today to help you get started.
</P>
<P>
   Soil
</P>
<P>
   If you're having trouble with your grass or if you have a new
home that has never had a lawn, you should have your soil tested to
see if it has everything it needs to support grass.
</P>
<P>
   Doug Fender, executive director of Turfgrass Producers
International, a sod industry group, said when home builders enter
a site they often strip away the topsoil because it's soft and
hampers the use of heavy equipment. They then dig a hole for a
foundation and spread the soil from deep underground across the
surface.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're basically turning the yard upside down,'' he said.
``They're replacing topsoil with all its organic material and
nutrients with soil that's never supported life.''
</P>
<P>
   A soil-testing laboratory can analyze your soil and tell you
what it needs to sustain a healthy lawn. Call Holmes Laboratories
at (800) 344-1101 for help. Holmes personnel instruct callers on
preparing a soil sample and can supply results and recommendations
in about two weeks for about $12.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Lane, director of the extension office in Montgomery
County, said the heavy clay soils common in this area often need
the addition of organic material such as humus, compost or manure.
Tilling in organic material loosens the naturally dense soil and
provides nutrients to help the grass grow.
</P>
<P>
   Sandy soils also benefit from humus, compost or manure, Lane
said. The organic material promotes growth and helps hold loose
sandy soil together.
</P>
<P>
   But if your lawn is already growing in heavy clay soil, Fender
and Lane say the best way to dramatically improve the quality of
your grass is aeration. Aeration involves poking holes in the soil
to promote the flow of air, water and nutrients below the surface.
</P>
<P>
   The easiest way to do the job is to rent a gas-powered
core-aerating machine; the machines are a bit larger than average
lawn mowers and run about $50 to $75 a day at tool-rental
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The type of aerator you should look for has hollow, tubelike
tines on a rotating drum. As the drum turns the tines dig out small
plugs of dirt and drop them on the surface.
</P>
<P>
   Before using an aerator, cut the grass as short as possible
without scalping it. You then run the aerator over the yard,
leaving plugs of grass and soil as you go.
</P>
<P>
   The lawn will look awful immediately after the treatment, but
run the lawn mower again to break up the plugs or water the lawn to
start dissolving them. They'll be less noticeable as the grass
grows around them.
</P>
<P>
   Grasses
</P>
<P>
   Lane said almost all the grass in the Dayton area is of four
species: bluegrass, tall fescue, fine fescue (sometimes called red
fescue) and perennial rye grass. Most bags of grass seed contain
either blends or mixtures.
</P>
<P>
   A blend contains several varieties (sometimes called cultivars)
of the same grass species. A bag of bluegrass blend, for example,
would contain all bluegrass seeds, but several varieties of
bluegrass would be included.
</P>
<P>
   A grass-seed mixture contains more than one species. Some
mixtures even contain annual grasses that germinate quickly to give
you a green look quickly, then die at first frost. All the seeds in
a mixture will grow if cared for properly, and the types best
suited to conditions in your yard will become dominant.
</P>
<P>
   The type of grass you should choose depends on conditions in
your yard, how you want the grass to look and how much maintenance
you want to perform.
</P>
<P>
   Bluegrass, properly tended, produces a thick, even lawn.
Bluegrass spreads by sending runners along the surface of the
ground so it naturally fills gaps.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, bluegrass has fairly shallow roots and
doesn't perform as well in dry conditions as other grasses. If you
choose bluegrass, expect to do more watering and fertilizing to
keep it healthy.
</P>
<P>
   Tall fescue is hardier than bluegrass, but some people don't
like it as well. Rather than spreading, tall fescue tends to grow
in patches that can leave gaps.
</P>
<P>
   Tall fescue has deep roots that help it withstand drought and is
the preferred grass if you're not good at watering.
</P>
<P>
   Zoysia grass is sometimes advertised for its drought resistance,
but its brown fall and spring color is not acceptable to most
homeowners.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said perennial rye grass also stands up to drought fairly
well. Instead of deep roots, like tall fescue, perennial rye grass
has a glossy coating on the blades of grass that help it retain
water.
</P>
<P>
   Lane said some people love the glossy look of rye grass, but he
warns that damp rye grass can be slippery, so it's not recommended
for high-traffic areas.
</P>
<P>
   Fine fescue is a thin-bladed grass that is more shade tolerant
than the other species, and it may grow where other grasses won't.
</P>
<P>
   Solving problems
</P>
<P>
   If you don't water a lawn during the hot, dry months of summer,
it will stop growing and turn brown until wetter weather in the
fall. If your lawn has gone dormant, it should recover on its own.
</P>
<P>
   Until it does, don't apply fertilizer or weed killers. Let it
grow a little higher than normal and make sure your lawn mower
blade is sharp when you cut. Leave the clippings on the lawn unless
they clump.
</P>
<P>
   When the grass starts greening up, Fender suggests you add a
little balanced fertilizer with four parts nitrogen to one part
phosphorus to two parts potassium.
</P>
<P>
   Bald spots or trails can appear in heavy-traffic areas, but the
lack of grass is not necessarily caused by the trampling of the
grass plants. The problem is more often soil compaction; the ground
is packed so tightly that water, air and nutrients can't reach the
roots.
</P>
<P>
   To repair such an area, run a tiller or aerator to break up the
soil before reseeding. Or if the same areas go bald every year,
consider mulch or some kind of walkway.
</P>
<P>
   If you're committed to grass in the traffic lanes, tie pets and
vary play patterns to relieve the pounding. Also restrict traffic
while the yard is wet.
</P>
<P>
   You also need to make a decision about shady areas. Fine fescue
may grow in the shade, as will bentgrass and rough bluegrass. But
Fender said growing grass in deep shade is hard, and the grasses
that grow there aren't always attractive.
</P>
<P>
   Consider trimming branches of shade trees or replacing them with
smaller plants in areas where you want grass. Also consider mulch
around the base of trees or ground-cover plants such as vinca minor
and pachysandra.
</P>
<P>
   Standing water will kill grass within a few days. If you have a
spot that floods in your yard, you may need to regrade to improve
the water flow. Another option is burying a drain tile under the
swampy spot or installing wetlands plants.
</P>
<P>
   Several other problems can affect a lawn, such as underground
grubs. But if your grass is healthy, it generally will fight off
most pests on its own.
</P>
<P>
   New grass
</P>
<P>
   The No. 1 reason new grass crops die is that people stop
watering before the plants are firmly established. Bluegrass,
particularly, takes weeks of daily watering to take hold.
</P>
<P>
   Follow directions that come with your seed to determine how you
should water the new grass, but, in general, water lightly and
often. Established grass, by the way, should be watered
infrequently (twice a week or less) and deeply.
</P>
<P>
   Sod shortens the time needed to get a lawn going, but it can be
expensive. Before buying sod, determine what killed the grass in
the first place and correct that problem first.
</P>
<P>
   To use sod, dig around the bald areas to create patches with
square sides and calculate the square footage of sod you'll need to
cover the patches. Remove roots, clods and debris where the sod
will go.
</P>
<P>
   Do not pick up the sod until the day you are installing it. Sod
is made of living grass plants, and it will die if improperly
stored.
</P>
<P>
   Follow directions on watering the sod to help the roots grow
down to tie into the underlying soil.
</P>
<P>
   Restrict traffic on freshly planted seed and sod until a couple
weeks after the grass is firmly established and growing.

 &HT;    Dry run muddies outlook for well
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ A reader was contemplating the old saying ``You
never miss the water until the well runs dry'' as he shopped for
his first home.
</P>
<P>
   I'll try to answer his question on private wells and a couple of
others today.
</P>
<P>
   How dry I am
</P>
<P>
   F.S.M. was considering a suburban property that gets its water
from a private well and had a ``recovery test'' done. An inspector
ran the taps, and at first the system put out six gallons of water
a minute. After half an hour, it was down to only one gallon a
minute and was putting out brownish-gray water. F.S.M. had no
experience with wells, but the weather had been dry before the
test. He wondered if the water situation could be improved since
everything else about the house was fine.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: Rod Jenkins, owner of Hall &AMP; Jenkins Well Drilling and
Pump Service, said six gallons a minute, the initial flow the test
showed, ``is not that bad.'' But he said getting only a gallon of
dirty water a minute after 30 minutes indicates a serious problem.
He said what probably happened was that running the tap pulled out
most of the water in the well. As surrounding groundwater flowed
in, it plunged to the bottom of the well, kicking up sediment that
discolored the water.
</P>
<P>
   The options for improving the water supply are refurbishing the
well or digging a new one. Jenkins said digging a new 100-foot well
probably will cost $1,500 to $3,000. Refurbishing the existing well
probably would cost about $700 to $800, but there's no guarantee
the repairs would work.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins noted that some well owners have good water pressure,
but they notice minor odors or discoloration. He suggested that
before they call a well contractor, owners with minor problems
should contact their local health departments for tips on
sanitizing the wells themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Outdoor power
</P>
<P>
   B.W. bought an electric string trimmer with a 5.2-amp motor and
wanted to know what kind of extension cord he needed to power it.
The work area extends as far as 90 feet from the nearest outlet, so
he assumed he'd need a 100-foot extension cord. Salespeople advised
him to buy everything from 12- to 16-gauge cords. Also he had both
a 50-foot, 16-gauge cord and a 50-foot, 14-gauge cord, but one
salesperson said the two cords should not be used together.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: The best source of information on the power cord for
any appliance, whether it's intended for indoor use or outdoor use,
is the owner's manual that comes with the appliance. I called the
Black and Decker help line at (800) 544-6986, and the adviser
suggested a 16-gauge cord for a 5.2-amp motor. He said if B.W. uses
two cords, their gauges should match. The issue, the adviser said,
is getting the appliance the voltage it needs. If you supply less
than the required voltage to any appliance, you'll damage the motor
over time.
</P>
<P>
   According to the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Council, 16-gauge
extension cords are the minimum size for most uses around the
house. The lower the gauge number on a cord, the thicker the wire
it contains and the more power it can carry, so a 12-gauge cord is
heftier than a 16-gauge.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is matching the prongs on the appliance to the
cord. Appliances with three-pronged plugs should be attached to
extension cords with three-pronged receptacles and then plugged
into three-pronged outlets. It's also important that outdoor plugs
be equipped with ground-fault circuit interrupters. These devices
help protect you from potentially dangerous electrical shock if you
accidentally cut the cord.
</P>
<P>
   Uneven heat
</P>
<P>
   F.A. moved into a new house four years ago that she said is not
as uniformly warm in the winter as the house she left. Both houses
were well insulated and had good furnaces. But the new house is 400
square feet larger and is over a crawl space instead of a basement.
F.A. also noted that the cold-air ducts are near the ceiling in her
new house instead of near the floor. She wondered if the cold-air
ducts were pulling warm air out of her rooms, making her feel
colder.
</P>
<P>
   Solution: Walt Hibner, program manager of Dayton Power and Light
Co.'s Energy Resource Center, said the placement of cold-air ducts
near the ceiling probably is not the source of F.A.'s problem.
Hibner said the modern standard is to put cold-air return ducts
diagonally opposite heat registers. Registers are usually on
outside walls near windows, the area of rooms that tend to lose the
most heat. If the registers are near the floor, the cold-air ducts
will be on the opposite wall near the ceiling, and vice versa. Warm
air is pushed into the room from the register, and the increased
air pressure causes some of the air already in the room to flow
into the cold-air return, where it is carried to the furnace.
</P>
<P>
   Arranging the registers and cold-air ducts at different levels
keeps air churning in rooms to prevent stratification _ the
settling of cool air near the floor and warm air near the ceiling.
Hibner said room air entering a cold-air return duct near the
ceiling may be a little warmer than the air at floor level, but
pulling out a little warm air doesn't significantly cool the room.
And the slight extra warmth in the air means the furnace uses less
energy heating the air before pushing it back into the rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Hibner said some houses with basements feel warmer than houses
on crawl spaces because people have the option of heating their
basements. F.A. said that wasn't an issue because her old basement
was unheated.
</P>
<P>
   Hibner suggested that F.A. try having her heating and
air-conditioning contractor balance her heating system. He said
balancing involves measuring the airflow coming from the registers
into each of the rooms in her house. A heating technician can
determine if some rooms are getting too much airflow and others are
getting too little. The technician can then balance the system by
partially closing vents in the ducts leading to the rooms that get
too much heat so that more of the air heated by the furnace will be
directed to rooms that are too cold.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail

<P>
   Q: It was reported that a telescope in space was taking pictures
of a star that blew up more than 300 years ago. How is that
possible?
</P>
<P>
   A: Astronomers can see events now that happened hundreds _ or
even billions _ of years ago because it takes light a certain
amount of time to travel from the event until it gets to the
telescope. If a star that is 300 light years away from us exploded
300 years ago, light is just reaching us now.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, we can _ in fact, must _ ``see back into time,''
explained J. Scott Shaw, professor of astronomy at the University
of Georgia's department of physics and astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   The report you cite is not an extreme example of the situation.
The furthest we have been able to ``see'' is back to shortly after
the universe was formed, Shaw said: approximately 12 billion years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were all the original members of the band R.E.M. born in
Athens, Ga.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, none of the four was born in Athens, according to
The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &AMP; Roll, although the
band was formed there in April 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where they first saw the light of day: Michael Stipe,
Decatur, Ga., on Jan. 4, 1960; Peter Buck, Berkeley, Calif., on
Dec. 6, 1956; Mike Mills, Orange, Calif., on Dec. 17, 1958; and
Bill Berry, Duluth, Minn., on July 31, 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Berry has retired from the band, but made an appearance with
R.E.M. at a recent sold-out concert in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are hurricanes given people's names?
</P>
<P>
   A: The names help meteorologists and disaster planners avoid
confusion and quickly convey information about the behavior of a
tropical storm. Experience has shown that these short, distinctive
names also are less subject to error than the older, more
cumbersome, latitude-longitude identification methods. These
advantages are especially important in exchanging detailed storm
information between hundreds of widely scattered stations,
airports, coastal bases and ships at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know President Harry Truman didn't graduate from college.
Were there any others?
</P>
<P>
   A: The book ``Facts About the Presidents'' lists these others:
George Washington; Andrew Jackson; Martin Van Buren; Zachary
Taylor; Millard Fillmore; Abraham Lincoln; Andrew Johnson; and
Grover Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The remains of Adolf Hitler's top aide, Martin Bormann,
reportedly have been dropped into the Baltic Sea. Exactly where
were his remains until now? Newspaper and radio reports said only
that they were found at a construction site.
</P>
<P>
   A: Bormann apparently never left Berlin, despite rumors that he
fled to South America when the city fell to the Soviets in 1945.
DNA tests last year confirmed that remains found beneath a building
site in Berlin in 1972 were his.
</P>
<P>
   As first reported by the Hamburg-based weekly Der Spiegel,
prosecutors in Frankfurt ordered the remains cremated and committed
to the Baltic in an area outside territorial limits. Once the
second most powerful man in Nazi Germany, Bormann is believed to
have killed himself by taking poison May 2, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't revealed whether Bormann's ashes were scattered or
were in some sort of container that was sunk during the recent
burial at sea. The secrecy surrounding the timing of the burial,
and its specific site, was intended to preclude the possibility
that neo-Nazis might attempt to hold rallies there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to eat better, and I'm trying to use nutrition
information on food labels to help me make decisions. But how do I
know what I should consume?
</P>
<P>
   A: The nutrition facts panel is a useful tool to help you
improve your diet, said Chris Rosenbloom, a professor at Georgia
State University's department of nutrition and a spokeswoman for
the American Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who is ``moderately sedentary, not real active but not a
total couch potato,'' probably needs about 1,800 calories a day,
she said. About 50-55 grams a fat per day is recommended. The label
also has information about a serving size, but that might be much
smaller than what you'd consider to be a portion.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a plan customized for you, a registered dietitian
can give you specific information about calorie and fat gram needs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a fan of the cooking program ``Two Fat Ladies,'' shown on
PBS and the Food Network. I understand that Jennifer Paterson, the
one in glasses, died recently. Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: Paterson, who found fame in her 60s as half of a celebrity
duo with Clarissa Dickson Wright, died earlier this month after
losing a battle with lung cancer. She was 71. Described by BBC as a
``flamboyant eccentric,'' Paterson was the chef and presenter of
the hit BBC Two series in which she and co-presenter Dickson Wright
toured Britain on a Triumph Thunderbird (with sidecar) in a quest
to rediscover the delights of traditional British home cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson Wright said four editions of the fourth series of ``Two
Fat Ladies'' were completed before Paterson died, and probably will
be shown in the fall. But she added that she wouldn't complete the
remaining shows on her own. ``I would not want to do it, and I
think it would be totally inappropriate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the place name Yucatan?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins
offers an explanation, but prefaces it by saying it isn't proven.
According to the book, in 1517 Spanish explorer Francisco Fernandez
de Cordoba was in the area known today as the Yucatan Peninsula.
When he asked a native its name, the word Yucatan, meaning ``I
don't understand you,'' is supposed to have been the answer he
received and duly recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Alan Greenspan is chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Who
are the board members? Who appoints them, and how long do they
serve?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System normally
has seven members. The current members, in addition to Greenspan,
are Edward W. Kelley Jr., Laurence H. Meyer, Roger W. Ferguson Jr.
and Edward M. Gramlich. The vice chair is vacant, and there's one
other vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   The members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the
Senate. A full term is 14 years. One term begins every two years,
on Feb. 1 of even-numbered years. A member who serves a full term
may not be reappointed. All terms end on their statutory date,
regardless of the date on which the member was sworn into office.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman and the vice chairman are named by the president
from among the members, and are confirmed by the Senate. They serve
a four-year term. Members' term on the board are not affected by
their status as chairman or vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the Lincoln limousine that President
Kennedy was riding in when he was assassinated?
</P>
<P>
   A: After it was examined by the Secret Service and the FBI, and
evidence was taken from it, the limousine was cleaned up and put
back into service, said Steven Tilley, chief of the JFK Collection
at the National Archives in College Park, Md. Later, after it was
removed from service as a presidential limousine, it was taken to
the Henry Ford Museum at Dearborn, Mich., where it's still on
public display.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Wasn't Mother Teresa born in Albania? What was her early
religious experience, and did she convert to Catholicism?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mother Teresa, who died in 1997, was born to Albanian parents
on Aug. 27, 1910, as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhu, in what is now Skopje,
Macedonia. Then, it was part of the Ottoman Empire. Although the
majority of Albanians there were Muslims, her family was Catholic.
As a student at a public school in Skopje, Agnes was a member of a
Roman Catholic sodality with a special interest in foreign
missions. She often said that by the age of 12, she knew she had a
vocation to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Agnes was inspired to work in India by reports sent home
by Yugoslav Jesuit missionaries in Bengal, and at 18 she left home
to join the Sisters of Loretto, a community of Irish nuns with a
mission in the Archdiocese of Calcutta. After training at Loretto
institutions in Dublin, Ireland, and Darjeeling, India, she took
her first vows as a nun in 1928 and her final vows in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, she received ``a call within a call,'' as she once
described it. ``The message was clear: I was to leave the convent
and help the poor, while living among them.'' Two years later, the
Vatican granted her permission to leave Loretto and pursue her new
calling. In 1948 she also became a citizen of India.
</P>
<P>
   The Missionaries of Charity, which she founded, became an
official religious community within the Archdiocese of Calcutta in
1950, and in 1965 the Vatican recognized it as a pontifical
congregation directly under the jurisdiction of Rome.

<P>
   Q: Can you give us an update on the unnamed female physician who
discovered a lump in her breast while on duty in Antarctica? An
emergency mission to help her was reported not long ago.
</P>
<P>
   A: Her name has now been made public by the National Science
Foundation, which funds the Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. Dr.
Jerri L. Nielsen, Antarctica's only doctor, is treating herself for
a lump on her breast that she discovered in June. The Air Force
braved Arctic storms in July to air-drop the supplies she needed.
</P>
<P>
   Nielsen, 47, works 840 miles from the nearest populated site,
another research station on the Antarctic coast. The polar darkness
and extreme cold prevent people from leaving the site from March
through October, so that means she must conduct her self-treatment
for at least another two months.
</P>
<P>
   National Science Foundation spokeswoman Valerie Carroll wouldn't
say if Nielsen's lump is cancerous. She did say Nielsen is working
on a diagnosis with the assistance of American doctors. ``She is
going about her daily business, and everyone seems to be in pretty
good spirits,'' Carroll said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is the Navy report on Y2K readiness available on the Web?
</P>
<P>
   A: Navy Public Affairs says this address _
www.nfesc.navy.mil/y2k _ will lead you to the information. Geoffrey
Dann at the Naval Facilities Engineering Service Center sounded a
note of caution, however, saying it's important to first read the
statement titled Master Utilities Y2K Preparedness Status
Spreadsheet. It explains that the document is a work in progress.
``It also represents our opinion of utility provider preparedeness
as it affects Naval installations only,'' the statement says.
</P>
<P>
   After it was widely reported that the Navy expected widespread
failures in power, water and other utility services in the United
States because of the Year 2000 computer bug, Rear Adm. Louis Smith
said the Navy's assessment reflected a ``worst-case scenario.'' The
White House, meanwhile, recently concluded that national electrical
failures are ``highly unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Several months ago, country music entertainer George Jones
was seriously injured in a car wreck. How is he doing? Also, how
can fans write to him?
</P>
<P>
   A: Jones, said to be ``at death's door'' in March after he
crashed his Lexus sport-utility vehicle into a bridge near his
Franklin, Tenn., home, has made a remarkable recovery. In fact, he
performed recently at Nashville's Ryman Auditorium.
</P>
<P>
   The 68-year-old singer was treated for his injuries _ the most
serious of which was a ruptured liver _ at Vanderbilt University
Medical Center. His right lung also was punctured.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Jones pleaded guilty to charges of driving while
impaired and violating Tennessee's open container law. He was fined
$500 on the DWI charge and $50 for the open container violation. He
also was billed by the Tennessee Department of Transportation for
the $2,492.44 expense to repair the concrete bridge abutment he
shattered in the wreck.
</P>
<P>
   Mail can be sent to Jones in care of Asylum Records, 1906 Acklen
Ave., Nashville, TN 37212.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I understand there's some controversy between New York and
New Jersey over the Statue of Liberty. Which state is it actually
in?
</P>
<P>
   A: If you look at a map, you'll see that the Statue of Liberty
and Liberty Island are clearly on the New Jersey side of the state
border, which splits Upper New York Bay and extends up the center
of the Hudson River. But Liberty Island is officially under the
jurisdiction of New York, long creating a dispute between the two
states.
</P>
<P>
   Also confusing the issue is the fact that the statue on Liberty
Island, and the Ellis Island immigration station, compose the
Statue of Liberty National Monument. And while Liberty Island is
under New York's jurisdiction, most of Ellis Island is under New
Jersey's jurisdiction.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Has a legal defense fund been set up for Linda Tripp, who has
been indicted by a Maryland grand jury for secretly taping her
telephone conversations with Monica Lewinsky?
</P>
<P>
   A: Yes. The office of Joseph Murtha, Tripp's attorney, says
donations can be mailed to Linda Tripp Legal Defense Fund, 626
Admiral Drive, Suite 319, Annapolis, MD 21401. Checks should be
made out to the fund.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Nowhere in the news reports about the Turkey earthquake have
I seen any reference to temperatures there. Can you print what the
highs and lows are at this time of year in Ankara or other sites?
And what is the country's terrain like?
</P>
<P>
   A: Ankara's high temperatures in August were in the mid to upper
70s, with lows in the mid to upper 40s. Istanbul's highs also were
in the mid to upper 70s, with lows in the high 50s and low 60s.
Izmit's highs were in the low to mid 80s, with lows in the upper
50s and lower 60s.
</P>
<P>
   The epicenter of the Aug. 17 earthquake was Izmit, about 55
miles east-southeast of Istanbul. Ankara, in central Turkey, is
about 200 miles east-southeast of the epicenter.
</P>
<P>
   Turkey's terrain is mostly mountainous, with a narrow coastal
plain and a high central plateau known as Anatolia. Northern
Turkey, especially along an arc extending from the Sea of Marmara
to Lake Van near the border with Iran, is historically known for
very severe earthquakes.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Dorothy Dandridge's dramatized biography was shown on HBO
recently. What did the singer-dancer-actress die of? I always
thought she broke a hip, and a piece of the bone went through her
bloodstream and reached her heart. Now it's said to have been a
suicide. Can you clarify?
</P>
<P>
   A: ``Drug overdose'' is the common explanation. ``Black Women in
America: An Historical Encyclopedia'' states that Dandridge was
found dead Sept. 4, 1965, in her apartment from an overdose of an
antidepressant. As the book says, the drug, Tofranil, ``is not one
that causes drowsiness or forgetfulness, making an accident
unlikely.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to Keiko the whale?
</P>
<P>
   A: Keiko, the Ornicus orca star of the movie ``Free Willy,''
remains in his native waters off Iceland. He was returned there in
September 1998 after undergoing rehabilitation at the Oregon Coast
Aquarium. Keiko is under the care of Ocean Futures, an organization
created in March from a merger between the Jean-Michel Cousteau
Institute and the Free Willy Keiko Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   On July 30, Ocean Futures announced plans to create an
innovative device for tracking whales and studying their behavior
in the wild. The device will use satellite telemetry technology to
provide a continuous stream of data on Keiko's location, depth and
swim speed.
</P>
<P>
   Keepers say Keiko will have to weather at least one more winter
in his man-made bay pen in Vestmannaeyjar, off Iceland's south
coast. Scientists caring for him plan eventually to release Keiko
into complete freedom in Icelandic waters _ once they have
determined that he is able to fend for himself in the wild. This
has never been attempted with a captive orca whale.
</P>
<P>
   It's hoped that ultimately Keiko can live without human care,
and will be able to communicate with other whales.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Who monitors the accuracy of nutritional information on food
packaging? I'm suspicious of the fat grams listed on some packages
of chicken.
</P>
<P>
   A: The Food and Drug Administration oversees information found
on nutrition facts panels. Chris Rosenbloom of Georgia State
University, a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association,
said that in a survey on label accuracy _ based on more than 2,000
laboratory tests on 300 sample food products purchased off retail
shelves _ the accuracy rate for correct nutrition information was
91 percent; for total fat it was 96 percent; for total calories, 93
percent; and for saturated fat, 93 percent.

on nutrition facts panels. Chris Rosenbloom of Georgia State
University, a spokeswoman for the American Dietetic Association,
said that in a survey on label accuracy _ based on more than 2,000
laboratory tests on 300 sample food products purchased off retail
shelves _ the accuracy rate for correct nutrition information was
91 percent; for total fat it was 96 percent; for total calories, 93
percent; and for saturated fat, 93 percent.

 &HT;    Q &AMP; A ON THE NEWS
 &HT;    EDS: THIS IS TAKE 1 OF TWO TAKES.

   Have a question about the news? Colin Bessonette will try to get
an answer. Call 404-222-2002, or write him at The Atlanta
Journal-Constitution, P.O. Box 4689, Atlanta, Ga. 30302, or e-mail
him at q&AMP;a(at)ajc.com
</P>
<P>
   Q: It was reported that a telescope in space was taking pictures
of a star that blew up more than 300 years ago. How is that
possible?
</P>
<P>
   A: Astronomers can see events now that happened hundreds _ or
even billions _ of years ago because it takes light a certain
amount of time to travel from the event until it gets to the
telescope. If a star that is 300 light years away from us exploded
300 years ago, light is just reaching us now.
</P>
<P>
   In this way, we can _ in fact, must _ ``see back into time,''
explained J. Scott Shaw, professor of astronomy at the University
of Georgia's department of physics and astronomy.
</P>
<P>
   The report you cite is not an extreme example of the situation.
The furthest we have been able to ``see'' is back to shortly after
the universe was formed, Shaw said: approximately 12 billion years
ago.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Were all the original members of the band R.E.M. born in
Athens, Ga.?
</P>
<P>
   A: Actually, none of the four was born in Athens, according to
The New Rolling Stone Encyclopedia of Rock &AMP; Roll, although the
band was formed there in April 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Here's where they first saw the light of day: Michael Stipe,
Decatur, Ga., on Jan. 4, 1960; Peter Buck, Berkeley, Calif., on
Dec. 6, 1956; Mike Mills, Orange, Calif., on Dec. 17, 1958; and
Bill Berry, Duluth, Minn., on July 31, 1958.
</P>
<P>
   Berry has retired from the band, but made an appearance with
R.E.M. at a recent sold-out concert in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Why are hurricanes given people's names?
</P>
<P>
   A: The names help meteorologists and disaster planners avoid
confusion and quickly convey information about the behavior of a
tropical storm. Experience has shown that these short, distinctive
names also are less subject to error than the older, more
cumbersome, latitude-longitude identification methods. These
advantages are especially important in exchanging detailed storm
information between hundreds of widely scattered stations,
airports, coastal bases and ships at sea.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I know President Harry Truman didn't graduate from college.
Were there any others?
</P>
<P>
   A: The book ``Facts About the Presidents'' lists these others:
George Washington; Andrew Jackson; Martin Van Buren; Zachary
Taylor; Millard Fillmore; Abraham Lincoln; Andrew Johnson; and
Grover Cleveland.
</P>
<P>
   Q: The remains of Adolf Hitler's top aide, Martin Bormann,
reportedly have been dropped into the Baltic Sea. Exactly where
were his remains until now? Newspaper and radio reports said only
that they were found at a construction site.
</P>
<P>
   A: Bormann apparently never left Berlin, despite rumors that he
fled to South America when the city fell to the Soviets in 1945.
DNA tests last year confirmed that remains found beneath a building
site in Berlin in 1972 were his.
</P>
<P>
   As first reported by the Hamburg-based weekly Der Spiegel,
prosecutors in Frankfurt ordered the remains cremated and committed
to the Baltic in an area outside territorial limits. Once the
second most powerful man in Nazi Germany, Bormann is believed to
have killed himself by taking poison May 2, 1945.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't revealed whether Bormann's ashes were scattered or
were in some sort of container that was sunk during the recent
burial at sea. The secrecy surrounding the timing of the burial,
and its specific site, was intended to preclude the possibility
that neo-Nazis might attempt to hold rallies there.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I would like to eat better, and I'm trying to use nutrition
information on food labels to help me make decisions. But how do I
know what I should consume?
</P>
<P>
   A: The nutrition facts panel is a useful tool to help you
improve your diet, said Chris Rosenbloom, a professor at Georgia
State University's department of nutrition and a spokeswoman for
the American Dietetic Association.
</P>
<P>
   A woman who is ``moderately sedentary, not real active but not a
total couch potato,'' probably needs about 1,800 calories a day,
she said. About 50-55 grams a fat per day is recommended. The label
also has information about a serving size, but that might be much
smaller than what you'd consider to be a portion.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a plan customized for you, a registered dietitian
can give you specific information about calorie and fat gram needs.
</P>
<P>
   Q: I'm a fan of the cooking program ``Two Fat Ladies,'' shown on
PBS and the Food Network. I understand that Jennifer Paterson, the
one in glasses, died recently. Do you have any details?
</P>
<P>
   A: Paterson, who found fame in her 60s as half of a celebrity
duo with Clarissa Dickson Wright, died earlier this month after
losing a battle with lung cancer. She was 71. Described by BBC as a
``flamboyant eccentric,'' Paterson was the chef and presenter of
the hit BBC Two series in which she and co-presenter Dickson Wright
toured Britain on a Triumph Thunderbird (with sidecar) in a quest
to rediscover the delights of traditional British home cooking.
</P>
<P>
   Dickson Wright said four editions of the fourth series of ``Two
Fat Ladies'' were completed before Paterson died, and probably will
be shown in the fall. But she added that she wouldn't complete the
remaining shows on her own. ``I would not want to do it, and I
think it would be totally inappropriate,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What is the origin of the place name Yucatan?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Facts on File Encyclopedia of Word and Phrase Origins
offers an explanation, but prefaces it by saying it isn't proven.
According to the book, in 1517 Spanish explorer Francisco Fernandez
de Cordoba was in the area known today as the Yucatan Peninsula.
When he asked a native its name, the word Yucatan, meaning ``I
don't understand you,'' is supposed to have been the answer he
received and duly recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Alan Greenspan is chairman of the Federal Reserve Board. Who
are the board members? Who appoints them, and how long do they
serve?
</P>
<P>
   A: The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System normally
has seven members. The current members, in addition to Greenspan,
are Edward W. Kelley Jr., Laurence H. Meyer, Roger W. Ferguson Jr.
and Edward M. Gramlich. The vice chair is vacant, and there's one
other vacancy.
</P>
<P>
   The members are nominated by the president and confirmed by the
Senate. A full term is 14 years. One term begins every two years,
on Feb. 1 of even-numbered years. A member who serves a full term
may not be reappointed. All terms end on their statutory date,
regardless of the date on which the member was sworn into office.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman and the vice chairman are named by the president
from among the members, and are confirmed by the Senate. They serve
a four-year term. Members' term on the board are not affected by
their status as chairman or vice chairman.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Whatever happened to the Lincoln limousine that President
Kennedy was riding in when he was assassinated?
</P>
<P>
   A: After it was examined by the Secret Service and the FBI, and
evidence was taken from it, the limousine was cleaned up and put
back into service, said Steven Tilley, chief of the JFK Collection
at the National Archives in College Park, Md. Later, after it was
removed from service as a presidential limousine, it was taken to
the Henry Ford Museum at Dearborn, Mich., where it's still on
public display.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Wasn't Mother Teresa born in Albania? What was her early
religious experience, and did she convert to Catholicism?
</P>
<P>
   A: Mother Teresa, who died in 1997, was born to Albanian parents
on Aug. 27, 1910, as Agnes Gonxha Bojaxhu, in what is now Skopje,
Macedonia. Then, it was part of the Ottoman Empire. Although the
majority of Albanians there were Muslims, her family was Catholic.
As a student at a public school in Skopje, Agnes was a member of a
Roman Catholic sodality with a special interest in foreign
missions. She often said that by the age of 12, she knew she had a
vocation to help the poor.
</P>
<P>
   At 15, Agnes was inspired to work in India by reports sent home
by Yugoslav Jesuit missionaries in Bengal, and at 18 she left home
to join the Sisters of Loretto, a community of Irish nuns with a
mission in the Archdiocese of Calcutta. After training at Loretto
institutions in Dublin, Ireland, and Darjeeling, India, she took
her first vows as a nun in 1928 and her final vows in 1937.
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, she received ``a call within a call,'' as she once
described it. ``The message was clear: I was to leave the convent
and help the poor, while living among them.'' Two years later, the
Vatican granted her permission to leave Loretto and pursue her new
calling. In 1948 she also became a citizen of India.
</P>
<P>
   The Missionaries of Charity, which she founded, became an
official religious community within the Archdiocese of Calcutta in
1950, and in 1965 the Vatican recognized it as a pontifical
congregation directly under the jurisdiction of Rome.

   BRAZIL-CULTURE _ Not since ``The Girl from Ipanema'' became a

so much in vogue. There's a tropical heat wave spreading over

just opened his long awaited South American restaurant Loca Luna in
Midtown, and the already established Tierra is planning a series of
South American theme dinners to entice the Latin-loving crowd. And
with Delta's recent addition of nonstops to Rio, Emory reports that
its ``Portuguese for Travelers'' is the hottest language course in
its continuing education program. Meanwhile, Starbucks has
introduced an ``Ipanema Bourbon'' bean, Beck and other hipsters are
paying homage to Brazilian music, and the churrascaria (Brazilian

the country. We examine the emergence of a culture in Atlanta.

 Editors      The Hearst News Service will file the following for

   Depriving citizens of food is a vicious tool of modern warfare.
And in Sudan, a poor country in East Africa, the government is
using hunger as a weapon.
</P>
<P>
   The Houston Chronicle examines the 16-year-old civil war and the
deaths of more than 2 million people, more than any conflict since
World War II. Most of the dead were civilians who succumbed to
hunger, the preferred weapon of mass destruction in the post-Cold
War era.
</P>
<P>
   Because international relief now plays such a large role in war,
concern is growing that in the rush to aid the afflicted, the
relief may be abetting those who have a stake in the conflict.

   The following stories will be filed in the international news
(``i'') category:
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-WAR (Tajura, Sudan) _ When Sudanese government forces
attacked this village, killing its inhabitants was of little
immediate concern. As it has been throughout the campaign to
cleanse Sudan's isolated Nuba Mountains of its rebellious
population, the primary mission was to destroy the people's ability
to feed themselves and to drive them off the land. The current
round of the civil war between the fundamentalist Islamic
government of Sudan and the mostly non-Islamic tribes of the south
has lasted for 16 years and has caused the deaths of nearly 2
million people. By TONY FREEMANTLE. (Photos available on NYT
database.)
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-NUBA (Nuba Mountains, Sudan) _ Since 1989, when the people
of the Nuba Mountains aligned themselves with the Sudanese People's
Liberation Army, the rebel movement that controls much of the
southern half of the country, they have been under virtual siege by
the government. By TONY FREEMANTLE. (Photos available on NYT
database.)
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-AID (Panthou, Sudan) _ The people of Panthou seemingly
have spent lifetimes fleeing tribal rivals, Islamic holy warriors
and pro-government mercenaries bent on carnage. Their cattle have
been rustled, their crops laid waste, their homes gutted, their
culture battered. A ground-level look at how the aid operation and
the war have affected one village in southern Sudan. By DUDLEY
ALTHAUS. (Photos available on NYT database.)
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-AID-WORKERS (Lokichokio, Kenya) _ For a decade now, people
like Charisse Tillman have labored under an umbrella of U.N. and
private relief agencies that has delivered thousands of tons of
food and other supplies to the victims and perpetrators of one of
the world's deadliest and most intractable wars. Theirs is tricky
work at best. By DUDLEY ALTHAUS. (Photo available on NYT database.)
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-HISTORY (Ajiep, Sudan) _ A nuts-and-bolts look at Sudan's
civil war and a brief history of the country. By DUDLEY ALTHAUS.
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-US (Undated) _ The U.S. government supplies most of the
food delivered to Sudan's needy by the United Nations and private
aid agencies. By DUDLEY ALTHAUS.
</P>
<P>
   SUDAN-ATTACKS (Ajiep, Sudan) _ What happens if there is an
attack, asks a woman new to Sudan, at a meeting of relief workers?
Good question. Nothing has been more disruptive to the relief
effort than the constant warfare scraping back and forth across
Sudan's south. The fear of an attack prematurely ends the meeting
before anything is accomplished. By DUDLEY ALTHAUS (Photo available
on NYT database.)

DUQUETTE SWINGS DEAL WITH CUBS FOR BECK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GORDON EDES  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- General manager Dan Duquette, seeking to bolster the
Red Sox' bullpen for the stretch run as well as hedging against a
future without Tom Gordon, has traded for Rod Beck, one of the
decade's best closers until undergoing elbow surgery in May.
</P>
<P>
   Duquette acquired Beck, known for his Fu Manchu mustache and
flowing hair, from the Chicago Cubs for lefthanded reliever Mark
Guthrie _ ridding the Red Sox of their obligation to pay the
disappointing Guthrie the $1.6 million he is owed for next season _
plus a player to be named. Duquette said that player will be sent
to the Cubs Oct. 5, which incidentally would be the first day of
the playoffs for the Sox if they qualify.
</P>
<P>
   With the Cubs in need of center field help, it's possible that
they asked for Damon Buford or perhaps minor leaguer Michael
Coleman, who has 30 home runs for the PawSox this season. Another
possibility is lefthanded-hitting third baseman Cole Liniak,
bypassed at Pawtucket for Double A third baseman Wilton Veras when
the Sox needed a replacement for John Valentin Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Beck saved 51 games for the Cubs last season, becoming only the
fifth reliever in history to save at least 50, and was a catalyst
in their drive to a wild-card spot. In six seasons from 1993-98,
Beck had 232 saves, more than any other closer in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   Last winter, Beck signed a two-year, $9.5 million contract with
a club option for 2001, but during spring training he developed
back problems and in May underwent surgery to remove bone chips in
his elbow that had been present for several years.
</P>
<P>
   He lost his job as closer, as the Cubs went to Willie Adams and
traded for Rick Aguilera. He comes to the Red Sox with a 2-4
record, 7.80 ERA, and seven saves in 11 chances. Opponents are
hitting .331 against him this season, but Duquette insists that in
the last couple of weeks, the three-time All-Star has been throwing
better.
</P>
<P>
   In seven appearances since Aug. 16 _ none of which has been a
save situation _ Beck has allowed just one run in 8 2/3 innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Sox are assuming the balance of the $5.5 million Beck is
owed this season. His contract calls fom him to be paid $3.5
million next season, with a club option of $4.5 million in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Beck, who spoke to reporters in San Diego after speaking with
Duquette by telephone Tuesday night, left little doubt that he
expects to slide into the closer's role when he gets here.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the job is available right now, so I imagine so,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows a lot of faith in (Boston's) scouting department. I
know I'm back. I'm ready, but you would think teams would worry a
little bit. I'm glad they had faith in me to get me over there, but
I'd rather be doing it here (with the Cubs).''
</P>
<P>
   Duquette, however, said that Beck may serve initially in a
set-up role, with Derek Lowe pitching as well as he has. Lowe has
10 saves, including five in six chances since taking over when Tim
Wakefield was returned to the starting rotation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're happy to have his experience to stabilize our bullpen,''
Duquette said. ``This time of year, going into the playoffs,
successful teams have at least two top-flight relievers. One of the
things we wanted to upgrade going into the playoffs is our
bullpen.''
</P>
<P>
   Beck also gives the Red Sox another option if Gordon is unable
to pitch next season because of his elbow problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a good split and a lot of mental toughness,'' said
manager Jimy Williams, who was with Atlanta when Beck closed for
the San Francisco Giants. ``That's what he showed against us (the
Braves). He has confidence in himself and his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I saw him, he had the stuff to go with whatever aura he
projected when he stood out there. He's a fighter out there, a
blue-collar kid. He's a competitor, always has been. Maybe that's
why he came back so quick.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Rapp was a teammate in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, he's easygoing until it's his turn to pitch,'' Rapp
said. ``He's a bulldog, all business, no fooling around when it's
his turn to pitch. And he's a guy who paints the corners. He's like
Pedro that way.''

 &HT;    ARMY TROOPS, REBELS AND ANTI-REBEL VIGILANTES MAKE VOLATILE MIX
IN MEXICO'S CHIAPAS STATE
 &HT;    EDs: For purposes of a locator map, La Realidad is about 100
miles southeast of San Cristobal de las Casas, Chiapas state, and
about 50 miles east of Las Margaritas, Chiapas.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Sept. 5 And Thereafter.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LA REALIDAD, Mexico _ Armed with machetes, the men came out of
the darkness and swarmed the truck ferrying Mexican doctor Lydia
Rangel and two Spaniards out of the Lacandon jungle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tie them up!'' some of the vigilantes shouted, accusing the
three of being ``outside agitators'' and leaders of Mexico's
Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
   About 100 yards down the isolated dirt road, Mexican Army
soldiers charged with keeping the peace in this volatile region in
Mexico's southern state of Chiapas surely heard screams, according
to Rangel. Yet they failed to rescue the terrified captives. In
fact, Rangel is certain one of the soldiers was among the mob,
which Rangel says tried to rape her and appeared close to lynching
all three captives on Aug. 21.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was with sheer complicity of the military,'' said the
24-year-old newly graduated physician from Mexico City, who has
requested a criminal investigation into the attack near a hamlet
called El Eden. She showed dark bruises on her legs and described
how the assailants tried to tear off her clothing before they
suddenly released her and the Spaniards.
</P>
<P>
   The chilling incident near this remote Zapatista rebel
stronghold is fueling fear that vigilantes loyal to Mexico's ruling
party are on the rise here, a year and a half after 45 people,
mostly women and young children, were massacred by similar
anti-Zapatista vigilantes in the village of Acteal.
</P>
<P>
   Although the military was not implicated in the Acteal massacre,
human rights groups accuse some soldiers of tolerating or even
assisting violent anti-rebel groups in spite of a truce and a peace
accord with the Zapatistas, who first emerged in Chiapas state more
than five years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Army has a tremendous responsibility for what's happening
here,'' said Marina Patricia Jimenez, director of the Fray
Bartolome Human Rights Center, a Catholic Church group in Chiapas
whose lawyer is representing Rangel.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican military did not respond to repeated requests by Cox
Newspapers to talk about the alleged attack on Rangel and the
Spaniards, or other recent violent confrontations involving
government troops in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a number of violent clashes this month in
Chiapas, where the unresolved Zapatista rebellion remains a thorn
pricking at the Mexican government.
</P>
<P>
   For more than a year, politicians and business people who are
against the rebels have expressed outrage at foreigners who come to
Chiapas to visit communities as human rights observers or rebel
sympathizers. Now, that anger is widening to include Mexicans from
outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel, who volunteers in communities sympathetic to the
Zapatistas, said she and two Spaniards visiting villages here were
stopped at a makeshift roadblock by men claiming themselves to be
sympathizers, but of Mexico's ruling Revolutionary Institutional
Party, or the PRI.
</P>
<P>
   The men said that PRI supporters were putting up a roadblock to
stop Zapatistas because the rebels were preventing the construction
of roads and other development projects.
</P>
<P>
   Rangel also said a man stepped out from among a crowd that
swelled to about 150 people and said, ``Here the autonomy of the
PRI supersedes the law of the federal government.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the crowd debated what to do with the three before
stealing some of their possessions, beating them and then letting
them go. Screaming, the three piled into their truck and pulled up
to the nearby military roadblock _ one of four along a 50-mile
stretch of road to La Realidad, the Zapatistas' reported jungle
headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   A soldier Rangel recognized as a man among the mob said the Army
was watching the road and that the vehicle she was in had better
not stop or its occupants might be shot.
</P>
<P>
   The Zapatistas first emerged in this remote part of Mexico when
they staged an armed uprising in Chiapas, Mexico's poorest state,
on New Year's Day 1994. Mostly Mayan Indians who speak limited
Spanish, they fought briefly with police and the military in
several cities in Chiapas before a truce was called and
negotiations began to address their demands for justice, Indian
autonomy and policies to overcome desperate poverty here.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 peace accords were signed between the rebels and
Mexico's federal government, which acknowledges that for decades it
has neglected the mostly agrarian Chiapas and failed to prevent
abuses committed against the state's large Mayan Indian population.
But the peace accord has never been fully implemented and talks
broke down between the government and the rebels, who enjoy empathy
if not active support from many Mexicans.
</P>
<P>
   The rebels accuse President Ernesto Zedillo's administration of
breaking its promise to stick to the peace accords and opting for a
``low intensity'' war to erode support for the Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   On Dec. 22, 1997, divisions among Chiapas' population exploded
when pro-government Indians attacked the village of Acteal,
slaughtering 45 other Indians attending a prayer service. Police
officers in Chiapas were arrested for playing a role in the attack
and the governor of the state resigned under pressure from the
Zedillo administration. Thousands more Mexican Army troops were
sent into Chiapas, some of them ordered to offer medical services
and other humanitarian aid to rebel villages in an attempt to win
their confidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Mexican government also began deporting foreign tourists
from the United States and Europe who were flocking to rebel
villages as observers at the request of Mexican human rights
organizations.
</P>
<P>
   In the last couple of weeks, government officials in Chiapas
have turned their wrath on Mexicans from out of town. Local PRI
officials and the mayor of San Cristobal de las Casas, a tourist
town in Chiapas, declared a Mexican actress ``persona non grata''
and publicly threatened to run her out of town.
</P>
<P>
   ``They simply don't want any observers going there,'' said
Mexico City television actress Ofelia Medina, who received ample
national publicity for being the object of scorn in Chiapas.
</P>
<P>
   Medina sparked criticism in Chiapas by traveling to a remote
jungle hamlet, Amador Hernandez, where pro-Zapatista Indians were
preventing the construction of a road. Although Amador Hernandez is
a six-hour walk from the nearest dirt road, villagers said they
feared a new passageway for vehicles would be used primarily to
move more Army troops into the area and position them against the
Zapatistas.
</P>
<P>
   The Indians also said they had asked the government to build a
road more than 10 years ago _ before the conflict _ but they were
ignored.
</P>
<P>
   When Mexican troops were dispatched to Amador Hernandez to
provide security for construction teams, groups of masked women
blocked their path. Joining them were Medina, and students who have
been on strike for more than four months at Mexico's National
Autonomous University in Mexico City.
</P>
<P>
   The acting governor of Chiapas, Roberto Albores, lashed out at
the protestors, traveling to a different Indian village that has
expressed support for the road. He also urged federal officials to
``let Chiapas resolve its own conflict'' _ comments that were
interpreted by human rights organizations as inciting violence.
</P>
<P>
   Local newspapers also weighed in, publishing angry editorials
about Medina.
</P>
<P>
   After the Zapatistas mustered more than 10,000 supporters to
demonstrations Aug. 23-25 in three cities in Chiapas, the Zedillo
administration announced on Aug. 26 that the road to Amador
Hernandez would be postponed.
</P>
<P>
   That was one day after another incident flared up in the jungle.
The Army says villagers wielding sticks and machetes attacked
soldiers, wounding seven, patrolling in a village a two-hours walk
from the nearest road. Three villagers who were arrested said the
soldiers instigated the clash when they pushed women protesting
their presence and began firing their guns into the air. Two
villagers were shot and wounded.
</P>
<P>
   At the rebel headquarters here in La Realidad, Zapatistas say
they typically shut their doors when soldiers stationed about five
miles away drive through the hamlet on their way to another Army
outpost in the jungle. La Realidad is surrounded by a wall of
jungle and is about four hours from the nearest paved road.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that one day the soldiers will try to stop here,
too,'' said a rebel named Maximiliano Hernandez. ``If that happens,
then the people will have to defend themselves.''

 &HT;    CHINA'S ANNIVERSARY FACELIFT INVOKES PRIDE, GRIPES IN BEIJING
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sat., Sept. 4 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By MARCIA KUNSTEL and JOSEPH ALBRIGHT 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ The late Chairman Mao Tse-tung must be weeping in his
mausoleum: a glitzy shopping district is a showstopping centerpiece
for the 50th anniversary of China's Communist revolution.
</P>
<P>
   The district is one of 67 projects, including a new subway line
and airport terminal, under construction around the clock to be
finished in time for the Oct. 1 festivities here. But among the
more than $13 billion in capital improvements, the Wangfujing
Street renovation most audaciously flaunts just how dramatically
New China has altered its course in five decades.
</P>
<P>
   Rolex watches and Burberry coats are for sale there, and parts
of the street are paved in pink marble.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the prosperity of the country,'' said Zhong Di, 73,
contentedly surveying the scene with her husband from one of the
street's new wooden benches. ``Without money, we couldn't make so
many changes.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet an undercurrent of discontent also can be found in Beijing
among people who question the lavish expenditures and disruption
radiating from messy construction sites for more than a year,
people who wonder if things are moving in quite the right direction
as New China completes its first half century with a continuing
charge into capitalist-style reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I had money I could get cosmetics and surgery and I'd look
like I was 30 years old, too,'' scoffed a 56-year-old pedicab
driver who identified himself only as Mr. Wu. ``How you look isn't
as important as what you do.''
</P>
<P>
   Money would be better spent helping Chinese who are laid off,
live in substandard housing, or don't have enough to eat, he said,
as three fellow drivers murmured assent.
</P>
<P>
   Big construction projects have multiple aims _ to improve life
here, to make Chinese feel proud, and to show a modern, sleek face
to the rest of the world as it tunes into the milestone
celebration.
</P>
<P>
   Negative commentary isn't rare, but seldom is openly mouthed as
the anniversary nears and the volume of patriotic boosterism blares
ever louder in the media, schools and work units.
</P>
<P>
   And plenty of Beijingers do sound happy to see the changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we don't spend this money now, we will have to spend
it later. If we want Beijing to be an international city we have to
spend a lot of money,'' said Qiao Wei, a 20-year-old law student.
</P>
<P>
   Among improvements, the new subway line is her personal
favorite. Cleaning the foul canals and dotting green space all over
town also enhance the quality of living in China's capital.
</P>
<P>
   The selection of Wangfujing Street for massive renovation is a
more intriguing decision to ponder.
</P>
<P>
   The name derives from Ming dynasty days, when an emperor
reputedly demanded that his 10 brothers live together near the
Forbidden City for easy surveillance. The street became known as
Shiwangfu, or street of mansions for 10 brothers.
</P>
<P>
   In the century before the revolution it was called Morrison
Street and was a premier shopping district. Post-revolution, it
re-acquired the Chinese name _ adding ``jing'' for an ancient well
there _ and got a new attitude. Shops became state-owned and the
half-mile-long street was anchored with the first peoples'
department store, where plain and basic were orders of the day.
</P>
<P>
   Now shabbier stores are being replaced and storefronts are
getting spiffy new facades and signs. Jewelry stores, camera shops,
and a new fur and leather emporium will compete with more modest
dress and underwear stores.
</P>
<P>
   The street itself has been reconfigured into mainly a pedestrian
mall, with only buses and a few permitted vehicles allowed to drive
through.
</P>
<P>
   Flowering planters made from wooden barrels and carts enliven
the tree-lined walkway, and plazas with irregularly-timed water
jets draw giggling children trying to dodge the sprays.
</P>
<P>
   The change is remarkable to people like the elderly Zhong.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the old days Beijing had only a lot of single-story houses.
People's clothes were only in three colors--black, gray and
blue--nothing else,'' she said. ``It was a very simple life.''
</P>
<P>
   This focus on consumption is polar opposite the principles that
undergirded Chairman Mao's revolution. And consumption isn't so
popular today, either.
</P>
<P>
   Zhong and her husband are an example.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't come downtown to shop today, just to see the
changes,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The reopening of the refurbished Beijing Department Store drew
400,000 people last weekend, but many came just to gawk or to buy
tea or trinkets.
</P>
<P>
   Most people strolling down Wangfujing aren't burdened with
packages, a sign of the nationwide angst brought on by dislocations
from economic reform policies. An estimated 8 percent to 10 percent
of the urban work force is unemployed, and layoffs ripple
throughout the country as unprofitable, inefficient state
enterprises fold under competitive pressure.
</P>
<P>
   The state has scaled back long-time communist benefits like
heavily subsidized housing as it moves to free the economy.
</P>
<P>
   Demand has been so slack that retail prices have gone down for
22 months in a row, leaving stores and factories with bulging
inventories.
</P>
<P>
   Pedicab driver Wu said Chinese won't even buy rides in his buggy
these days. Himself forced into early retirement from a clothing
factory a few years ago, Wu pedals Beijing's streets to make enough
money for his family.
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to understand his bitterness at the expensive, gala
festivities planned for October.
</P>
<P>
   But the fireworks and parades and newly-finished public works
will likely stir pride and optimism deep in the souls of many
Chinese, especially if they consider the long, austere and often
torturous road they have been forced to negotiate over the past 50
years. That, at least, appears be the hope of Chinese leaders
stage-managing the party.

OF SAXONY'

 &HT;    Moving in both (i) International and (f) Financial categories.

<P>
   DRESDEN _ On a plain a few miles north of this old and storied
city, the futures of two unlikely partners are joined in an
ambitious and expensive gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Rising from transformed farmland is an expansive new factory
with a simple contemporary design that would fit in nicely at any
American industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Fab 30, the plant was built by Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. (AMD) for about $1.9 billion and bears a distinct resemblance
to its Austin, Texas sister, Fab 25.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, Fab 30 by the end of the year will begin
yielding its primary and perhaps only product: the cutting edge,
copper-based Athlon microprocessor chip, formerly known as K-7.
</P>
<P>
   Athlon is AMD's rock in the sling for its challenge of
Austin-based Intel Corp., the Goliath of chip makers.
</P>
<P>
   As important as Athlon's success is to California-based AMD, it
means as much or more to government and business leaders in this
region as they strive to find a future after spending 50 of its
last 60 years ruled by either the Nazis or Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the fall of the Berlin wall, Dresden, which was left
in ruins after World War II, began to aggressively pursue high-tech
companies such as AMD to build what leaders here like to call the
``Silicon Valley of Saxony.''
</P>
<P>
   To entice AMD, the state of Saxony offered about $500 million _
an offering AMD executives agree was essential to their decision to
locate in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the city of Dresden assembled the 110-acre parcel
near the city's international airport and provided infrastructure _
including a direct link to the Autobahn that connects Dresden to
Berlin and Leipzig. The city sold the land to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We helped AMD do everything,'' said Helmut Ennen, the state
official who in 1993 approached the company's chief executive Jerry
Sanders about coming to Dresden. ``But the decision was theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Landing AMD was a stunning victory for Dresden, keeping the
momentum going and contributing to the critical mass needed to
attract other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 5,000 people are directly employed in the high-tech
businesses here, and we estimate that that produces jobs for
another 15,000 people,'' Ennen said. ``This has been very important
and gratifying for us.''
</P>
<P>
   AMD intends to hire 1,800 people, about half of whom already
work at Fab 30. All but about 30 are expected to be German, mostly
from Saxony.
</P>
<P>
   AMD was the second large technology firm to select Dresden,
following Siemens _ now Infineon Technolgies _ by a year. Last
year, the company announced a joint venture with Motorola to build
a plant in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   In April Mattson Technology, a fast-growing California firm,
chose Dresden as its research and development hub for Europe. In
all, 420 technology companies and 2,000 suppliers have set up in
and around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, AMD has been impressed by its experience here, said
Gary Heerssen, group vice president of AMD's Wafer Fab Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is an experiment then you would have to label it a
successful experiment to date,'' Heerssen said during an interview
with Cox Newspapers in a sparsely outfitted office at Fab 30.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen is minding the store until James Doran, Fab 30's new
general manager, arrives later this year. Doran, who managed
Austin's Fab 25, replaced Jack Saltich, who resigned in July to
work for another company.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen said he has been impressed by the early tests of Fab
30's precision equipment _ some of its components are so new that
they are in use for the first time. On July 7, the Fab 30 plant
successfully created its first copper-based chips, the first to be
produced in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell, but so far I think the indications are
quite good'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $500 million gift from the state, AMD was
attracted to Saxony because of its supply of well-educated and
under-employed workers. About a quarter of AMD's new hires here
were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though labor costs are higher than in Austin, the quality
of the workers make up the difference, Heerssen said. ``In general,
the overall educational level here on the part of the employee base
is higher than it is in central Texas, and probably everywhere
else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, it has proved to be an unusually flexible
workforce for Europe, where governments tend to limit the hours
people can be on the job. At AMD, many employees work 12-hour
shifts and the plant is staffed 24 hours a day _ unheard of
elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The company and local officials speculate that this could be
explained by Saxony's being fairly new to the free-market system.
This means that structures such as trade unions and bureaucracies
that are prevalent in much of Europe have not yet taken hold in
this somewhat isolated region. Union membership in the former East
Germany has fallen by 50 percent since 1991, and only about 25
percent of workers in the region are under collective-bargaining
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Also remarkable for Europe, local politicians have shown little
fondness for red tape that has stymied investment in other eastern
regions, such as Berlin. ``We haven't lost one day of this project
to bureaucratic obstructions,'' said Jens Drews, AMD's spokesman in
Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, local officials two years ago came up with about
$1.5 million to establish an English-speaking international school
for the ``chip kids'' who came with AMD's 30 American employees.
The school has grown with the demand from other expatriate
families.
</P>
<P>
   For the Americans here, moving to Dresden has been an enriching
experience. Michael Ashley, a Californian who also maintains an
office in Austin, said he tries to visit one country a month.
``It's been a great experience for me,'' he said, noting that his
first visit to Europe was a house-hunting expedition to Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans at the Fab, many of whom have been to Texas for
training, have been exposed to a strange new culture. They address
fellow workers and superiors by their first names _ a rare
informality in Germany _ and have become accustomed to casual
Fridays when they wear jeans to the office. On a few desks are
Texas flags and in the hallways are framed photographs of their
favorite watering holes in Texas and scenes of hill country vistas.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen said the company thought briefly about expanding in
Texas before deciding on Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the company needed a second Fab, but to remain
in Austin would have required the acquisition of a new site and a
willingness to cope with a very tight labor market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the incentives offered in Dresden proved decisive.
``It goes back to the financial arrangement that was available here
that would not have been available in Austin,'' he said. ``That was
the enabling factor but not the only reason.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, Austin is expected to continue producing
aluminum-based microprocessors for the mid- and low-end of the
market _ where the volumes are higher _ while Dresden will produce
the high-performance products.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dresden experiment continues to be successful and
business is good, AMD is prepared to expand here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site is actually large enough for two, maybe three fabs,''
Heerssen said. ``But we have not made any plans at this point _
hard plans _ to expand beyond the existing facility.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dresden leaders, who are hot after other prospects, the AMD
experiment confirmed their belief in a way of thinking that runs
deeper in the city than its calamitous 20th Century experiences.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 years ago, Augustus the Strong _ perhaps the greatest
Saxon King _ explained his theory of public finance to his fellow
king, Friedrich of Prussia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your majesty receives a ducat, you place it in your
coffers,'' Augustus explained. ``Myself, however, I spend it so it

   DRESDEN _ On a plain a few miles north of this old and storied
city, the futures of two unlikely partners are joined in an
ambitious and expensive gamble.
</P>
<P>
   Rising from transformed farmland is an expansive new factory
with a simple contemporary design that would fit in nicely at any
American industrial park.
</P>
<P>
   Known as Fab 30, the plant was built by Advanced Micro Devices
Inc. (AMD) for about $1.9 billion and bears a distinct resemblance
to its Austin, Texas sister, Fab 25.
</P>
<P>
   If all goes as planned, Fab 30 by the end of the year will begin
yielding its primary and perhaps only product: the cutting edge,
copper-based Athlon microprocessor chip, formerly known as K-7.
</P>
<P>
   Athlon is AMD's rock in the sling for its challenge of
Austin-based Intel Corp., the Goliath of chip makers.
</P>
<P>
   As important as Athlon's success is to California-based AMD, it
means as much or more to government and business leaders in this
region as they strive to find a future after spending 50 of its
last 60 years ruled by either the Nazis or Communists.
</P>
<P>
   Soon after the fall of the Berlin wall, Dresden, which was left
in ruins after World War II, began to aggressively pursue high-tech
companies such as AMD to build what leaders here like to call the
``Silicon Valley of Saxony.''
</P>
<P>
   To entice AMD, the state of Saxony offered about $500 million _
an offering AMD executives agree was essential to their decision to
locate in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, the city of Dresden assembled the 110-acre parcel
near the city's international airport and provided infrastructure _
including a direct link to the Autobahn that connects Dresden to
Berlin and Leipzig. The city sold the land to the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``We helped AMD do everything,'' said Helmut Ennen, the state
official who in 1993 approached the company's chief executive Jerry
Sanders about coming to Dresden. ``But the decision was theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   Landing AMD was a stunning victory for Dresden, keeping the
momentum going and contributing to the critical mass needed to
attract other companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``About 5,000 people are directly employed in the high-tech
businesses here, and we estimate that that produces jobs for
another 15,000 people,'' Ennen said. ``This has been very important
and gratifying for us.''
</P>
<P>
   AMD intends to hire 1,800 people, about half of whom already
work at Fab 30. All but about 30 are expected to be German, mostly
from Saxony.
</P>
<P>
   AMD was the second large technology firm to select Dresden,
following Siemens _ now Infineon Technolgies _ by a year. Last
year, the company announced a joint venture with Motorola to build
a plant in Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   In April Mattson Technology, a fast-growing California firm,
chose Dresden as its research and development hub for Europe. In
all, 420 technology companies and 2,000 suppliers have set up in
and around the city.
</P>
<P>
   Thus far, AMD has been impressed by its experience here, said
Gary Heerssen, group vice president of AMD's Wafer Fab Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this is an experiment then you would have to label it a
successful experiment to date,'' Heerssen said during an interview
with Cox Newspapers in a sparsely outfitted office at Fab 30.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen is minding the store until James Doran, Fab 30's new
general manager, arrives later this year. Doran, who managed
Austin's Fab 25, replaced Jack Saltich, who resigned in July to
work for another company.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen said he has been impressed by the early tests of Fab
30's precision equipment _ some of its components are so new that
they are in use for the first time. On July 7, the Fab 30 plant
successfully created its first copper-based chips, the first to be
produced in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too early to tell, but so far I think the indications are
quite good'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the $500 million gift from the state, AMD was
attracted to Saxony because of its supply of well-educated and
under-employed workers. About a quarter of AMD's new hires here
were unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Even though labor costs are higher than in Austin, the quality
of the workers make up the difference, Heerssen said. ``In general,
the overall educational level here on the part of the employee base
is higher than it is in central Texas, and probably everywhere
else,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, it has proved to be an unusually flexible
workforce for Europe, where governments tend to limit the hours
people can be on the job. At AMD, many employees work 12-hour
shifts and the plant is staffed 24 hours a day _ unheard of
elsewhere in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The company and local officials speculate that this could be
explained by Saxony's being fairly new to the free-market system.
This means that structures such as trade unions and bureaucracies
that are prevalent in much of Europe have not yet taken hold in
this somewhat isolated region. Union membership in the former East
Germany has fallen by 50 percent since 1991, and only about 25
percent of workers in the region are under collective-bargaining
agreements.
</P>
<P>
   Also remarkable for Europe, local politicians have shown little
fondness for red tape that has stymied investment in other eastern
regions, such as Berlin. ``We haven't lost one day of this project
to bureaucratic obstructions,'' said Jens Drews, AMD's spokesman in
Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, local officials two years ago came up with about
$1.5 million to establish an English-speaking international school
for the ``chip kids'' who came with AMD's 30 American employees.
The school has grown with the demand from other expatriate
families.
</P>
<P>
   For the Americans here, moving to Dresden has been an enriching
experience. Michael Ashley, a Californian who also maintains an
office in Austin, said he tries to visit one country a month.
``It's been a great experience for me,'' he said, noting that his
first visit to Europe was a house-hunting expedition to Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   The Germans at the Fab, many of whom have been to Texas for
training, have been exposed to a strange new culture. They address
fellow workers and superiors by their first names _ a rare
informality in Germany _ and have become accustomed to casual
Fridays when they wear jeans to the office. On a few desks are
Texas flags and in the hallways are framed photographs of their
favorite watering holes in Texas and scenes of hill country vistas.
</P>
<P>
   Heerssen said the company thought briefly about expanding in
Texas before deciding on Dresden.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear that the company needed a second Fab, but to remain
in Austin would have required the acquisition of a new site and a
willingness to cope with a very tight labor market, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the incentives offered in Dresden proved decisive.
``It goes back to the financial arrangement that was available here
that would not have been available in Austin,'' he said. ``That was
the enabling factor but not the only reason.''
</P>
<P>
   As it stands, Austin is expected to continue producing
aluminum-based microprocessors for the mid- and low-end of the
market _ where the volumes are higher _ while Dresden will produce
the high-performance products.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dresden experiment continues to be successful and
business is good, AMD is prepared to expand here.
</P>
<P>
   ``The site is actually large enough for two, maybe three fabs,''
Heerssen said. ``But we have not made any plans at this point _
hard plans _ to expand beyond the existing facility.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dresden leaders, who are hot after other prospects, the AMD
experiment confirmed their belief in a way of thinking that runs
deeper in the city than its calamitous 20th Century experiences.
</P>
<P>
   About 300 years ago, Augustus the Strong _ perhaps the greatest
Saxon King _ explained his theory of public finance to his fellow
king, Friedrich of Prussia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your majesty receives a ducat, you place it in your
coffers,'' Augustus explained. ``Myself, however, I spend it so it
can return to me three times over.''

 &HT;    FOR DIVIDED PUERTO RICANS, QUESTION OF STATEHOOD IS NOT A SIMPLE
ONE
 &HT;    With Photos.
 &HT;    For Use Sun., Sept. 5 And Thereafter.
 &HT;    By MIKE WILLIAMS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JUAN, Puerto Rico _ The question dominates every political
conversation here, peppering the talk of old men sitting on shady
street corners, filling the radio airwaves, cropping up in news
articles on everything from politics to business and culture.
</P>
<P>
   Mainland Americans call it the ``statehood'' issue because they
think it's a simple question of whether Puerto Rico should become
the 51st state.
</P>
<P>
   For Puerto Ricans, boiling things down to a simple up-or-down
vote on statehood doesn't do justice to the complex mix of history,
culture, principles and emotions that most of this vibrant island's
residents bring to the discussion of what they call ``status.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to know what we want and what we want to be,'' said
Margie Morales, a veteran of the capital's political scene and
press secretary to San Juan's pro-commonwealth Mayor Sila Calderon,
who will carry her Popular Democratic Party's banner in the 2000
gubernatorial election. ``For us it's a major question that we face
every four years. It's a matter of identity. It's like whether or
not to get married.''
</P>
<P>
   The complexity of the issue was demonstrated recently when
two-term Gov. Pedro Rossello _ perhaps the most ardent statehood
advocate ever elected here _ appealed to a United Nations committee
to list Puerto Rico as one of the world's nonself-governing
territories whose status is to be determined by 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The move caused a stir here, as Rossello flatly admitted he was
frustrated that the U.S. Congress seems unwilling to deal with the
Puerto Rican question. The U.N. panel passed a resolution urging
the United States to speed up its deliberations on the issue,
although the measure has no power to force the American Congress to
act.
</P>
<P>
   First elected in 1992, Rossello has made the statehood campaign
the centerpiece of his administration, pushing through island-wide
votes on the issue in 1993 and 1998. Neither vote, however,
produced the results he hoped for: in both cases, voters failed to
give a majority to the statehood option.
</P>
<P>
   But the tallies came tantalizingly close. In both plebiscites,
statehood garnered just over 46 percent of the total. More than 70
percent of the island's registered voters turned out in both
elections, a clear sign of just how intensely Puerto Rico's 3.8
million residents feel about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   The final decision, of course, rests with the U.S. Congress,
which must officially sanction a plebiscite in order for the vote
to be binding. Despite determined lobbying by Rossello, Congress
has failed to schedule such a vote, saying it is waiting for a more
clear-cut consensus to emerge on the island.
</P>
<P>
   Puerto Ricans seem to be struggling toward that consensus, but
it may take years.
</P>
<P>
   With a gubernatorial election looming next November, statehood
will lose its most visible advocate as Rossello steps down. But his
New Progressive Party will continue to press the issue. A Rossello
deputy, former transportation secretary Carlos Pesquera, has been
christened the party's candidate for governor, and is already
dueling with Calderon on the issue.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Calderon proposes tweaking the commonwealth
relationship, guaranteeing irrevocable U.S. citizenship for Puerto
Ricans, while at the same time giving them more autonomy over
issues like trade.
</P>
<P>
   Observers discount the Puerto Rican Independence Party, which
has never attracted more than single digits at the polls. As for
the two major party candidates, they say it's too early to pick a
winner.
</P>
<P>
   ``Puerto Rico is very interesting politically right now because
neither of the two major parties has more than 50 percent of the
electorate,'' said Maximo Cerame Vivas, a pro-statehood columnist
for the San Juan Star newspaper. ``One is 48 percent, one is 46
percent. There is a floating swing vote that decides the issues,
but it isn't solidly in one column or the other.''
</P>
<P>
   Rossello's New Progressives have made steady gains in the past
two decades, rising from obscurity to the 46 percent support they
received in the most recent statehood plebiscite. They are now a
formidable opponent for the once-dominant Popular Democrat Party,
or PDP, which controlled 48 percent in the recent statehood votes.
</P>
<P>
   The PDP is the party of legendary Gov. Luis Munoz Marin, who in
1948 became Puerto Rico's first elected governor. He was the
architect of the plan which led to Puerto Rico's current status
with the U.S. _ a commonwealth territory or ``associated free
state'' in which islanders are governed by their own legislature,
but cede ultimate authority to the U.S. Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Marin is credited with bringing Puerto Rico into the 20th
Century, pushing for tax breaks that attracted U.S. manufacturers,
while helping develop the island's prosperous tourism industry.
</P>
<P>
   But there are curious wrinkles to Puerto Rico's status that may
account for the island's deep divisions on the issue. Residents
receive most federal entitlement programs, including welfare, as
part of an estimated $10 billion in U.S. taxpayer dollars that
support Puerto Rico each year _ yet they aren't required to pay
U.S. income tax.
</P>
<P>
   They are U.S. citizens, but they cannot vote in mainland
elections. They have an elected representative in Congress, but he
has no vote.
</P>
<P>
   They fight and die in the U.S. military, but they have their own
national flag, their own contestants in beauty contests, and their
own Olympic team.
</P>
<P>
   But while they enjoy many benefits from their association with
the United States, it is clear that most Puerto Ricans still feel
some ambivalence about the relationship. Intensely loyal to their
island's history and culture, they cannot forget the U.S. invasion
during the Spanish-American War of 1898 that relegated them to the
humiliating status of a colony.
</P>
<P>
   Along with that resentment is a lingering suspicion over a
particularly persistent Yankee problem: racism.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has been 100 years since the U.S. invaded us,'' said Rafael
Roman, 51, a soft-spoken worker in a frame shop in historic Old San
Juan. ``Why haven't they given us statehood in all that time? I
believe they don't want us as a state because of discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many of his fellow islanders, Roman shrugs when asked about
the status question. The population is split on the matter, he
said, because so many receive benefits from the United States and
have traveled there and like the opportunities they found.
</P>
<P>
   ``But they are still Puerto Rican,'' he said, holding a fist
near his heart. ``I am Puerto Rican. I want to be independent. This
is a nation, and the U.S. cannot take another nation within itself
as a state.''
</P>
<P>
   Among the young _ who switch effortlessly between English and
Spanish, dress in Tommy Hilfiger jeans and watch lots of MTV _
opinions seem more ambivalent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think if you took a vote today, most people would choose
statehood,'' said Jose Ivan Girona, 22, an art student from San
Juan who was raised in the United States by a father in the
military. ``I love the States. There is so much opportunity
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But even Girona sees the value in maintaining his Puerto Rican
identity. He just isn't sure how to balance that with his love for
things American.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if we do become a state, we don't want to lose our
identity,'' he said. ``We are very different from the U.S. Our
culture and values are much more traditional. We know who we are.
We're Puerto Rican. But how that fits with being a state, that's
what we don't know.''

   NEW `DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL' GUIDELINES: TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE.
``To say that the `don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue' policy on
gays in the military is not working is an understatement,'' writes
columnist Chuck Colbert, himself a former naval officer. Colbert
cites the recent murder of Pfc. Barry L. Winchell, a 21-year-old
gay soldier at a Naval base in Fort Campbell, Ky., who was
bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat. What is the president and
defense secretary doing about such abuses to the policy? Colbert
argues that their recently issued policy directives won't end to
the military's anti-gay culture of hostility.
</P>
<P>
   LATINOS UPSET BY PROPOSITION 187 MEDIATION. It was it watershed
issue in California politics, impelling record numbers of Latinos
to register to vote. It also has strained United States-Mexican
relations for five years. But Proposition 187, which sought to deny
public education and health services to undocumented families, is
not dead yet. Gov. Gray Davis of California, who once vilified the
measure, has changed his tune, reports Victor Mejia in this excerpt
from Hispanic magazine. In April, Davis asked a federal appellate
court to mediate the measure and find a solution that will appease
both the opponents and supporters of the 1994 ballot initiative. In
this commentary, Mejia offers all sides in the debate over
Proposition 187.
</P>
<P>
   A DOUBLE STANDARD ON DRUGS. ``This is a tale of the two ways the
Gainesville (Fla.) Police Department enforces narcotics violations.
Or, at the very least, it is a tale about the perception of dual
enforcement _ one for the city's black residents, the other for
whites,'' writes columnist Bill Maxwell. During a recent Police
Community Committee meeting, angry black residents told members
that they are sick and tired of cops' harassment and physical
abuse. Several young men described being stopped, searched and
detained for no legitimate reasons _ other than ``standing still
while black.'' Why not case the nearby rave clubs _ filled with
mostly white kids? And what would they find? Ecstasy, ketamine,
GHB, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana, LSD ... and the
list goes on. ``And what is happening here in Florida's leading
college town happens throughout the nation,'' Maxwell writes.
</P>
<P>
   JUST A LITTLE RED DOT. Long before bindis _ once the traditional
mark of married Hindu women _ began to dot the faces of Hollywood,
a school teacher used them to educate children about culture. Five
years ago, Mitra Sen, a fifth-grade school teacher in Scarborough,
Canada, began to notice how the girls in her class who were wearing
bindis on their foreheads were teased and taunted by their
classmates. She saw this as a learning opportunity, and came up
with a plan to have her students ``educate'' their schoolmates
about other people's cultures. Inspired by her success, she wrote,
directed and produced ``Just a Little Red Dot,'' an award-wining
documentary about her experiences with her class. Writer Sandip
Roy-Chowdhury talks to the Sen and some of her students in this
feature from A. Magazine.

   MONEY TALKS: INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. This is the third and final
excerpt from the book ``Money Talks'' by Juliette Fairley (John
Wiley &AMP; Sons Inc.). Fairley, a personal finance writer, has
interviewed prominent black leaders in such areas as banking,
financial planning and investment. In this excerpt, John Rogers,
president of Ariel Capital Management, offers tips on how to grow
your personal portfolio.

   NEW `DON'T ASK, DON'T TELL' GUIDELINES: TOO LITTLE, TOO LATE.
``To say that the `don't ask, don't tell, don't pursue' policy on
gays in the military is not working is an understatement,'' writes
columnist Chuck Colbert, himself a former naval officer. Colbert
cites the recent murder of Pfc. Barry L. Winchell, a 21-year-old
gay soldier at a Naval base in Fort Campbell, Ky., who was
bludgeoned to death with a baseball bat. What is the president and
defense secretary doing about such abuses to the policy? Colbert
argues that their recently issued policy directives won't end to
the military's anti-gay culture of hostility.
</P>
<P>
   LATINOS UPSET BY PROPOSITION 187 MEDIATION. It was it watershed
issue in California politics, impelling record numbers of Latinos
to register to vote. It also has strained United States-Mexican
relations for five years. But Proposition 187, which sought to deny
public education and health services to undocumented families, is
not dead yet. Gov. Gray Davis of California, who once vilified the
measure, has changed his tune, reports Victor Mejia in this excerpt
from Hispanic magazine. In April, Davis asked a federal appellate
court to mediate the measure and find a solution that will appease
both the opponents and supporters of the 1994 ballot initiative. In
this commentary, Mejia offers all sides in the debate over
Proposition 187.
</P>
<P>
   A DOUBLE STANDARD ON DRUGS. ``This is a tale of the two ways the
Gainesville (Fla.) Police Department enforces narcotics violations.
Or, at the very least, it is a tale about the perception of dual
enforcement _ one for the city's black residents, the other for
whites,'' writes columnist Bill Maxwell. During a recent Police
Community Committee meeting, angry black residents told members
that they are sick and tired of cops' harassment and physical
abuse. Several young men described being stopped, searched and
detained for no legitimate reasons _ other than ``standing still
while black.'' Why not case the nearby rave clubs _ filled with
mostly white kids? And what would they find? Ecstasy, ketamine,
GHB, cocaine, heroin, methamphetamine, marijuana, LSD ... and the
list goes on. ``And what is happening here in Florida's leading
college town happens throughout the nation,'' Maxwell writes.
</P>
<P>
   JUST A LITTLE RED DOT. Long before bindis _ once the traditional
mark of married Hindu women _ began to dot the faces of Hollywood,
a school teacher used them to educate children about culture. Five
years ago, Mitra Sen, a fifth-grade school teacher in Scarborough,
Canada, began to notice how the girls in her class who were wearing
bindis on their foreheads were teased and taunted by their
classmates. She saw this as a learning opportunity, and came up
with a plan to have her students ``educate'' their schoolmates
about other people's cultures. Inspired by her success, she wrote,
directed and produced ``Just a Little Red Dot,'' an award-wining
documentary about her experiences with her class. Writer Sandip
Roy-Chowdhury talks to the Sen and some of her students in this
feature from A. Magazine.

A FINGER LAKE VILLAGE IS PICTURESQUE, THOUGH NOT ALWAYS PERFECT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By KRIS WORRELL  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKANEATELES, N.Y. _ The morning light skittered across the
serene lake. A father showed his young son how to cast a fishing
line as a fountain gurgled in the background. A clock tower chimed,
gracefully announcing the hour on this otherwise quiet summer
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, before tourists clogged the streets, Skaneateles
seemed to be exactly what one of the travel brochures promised: ``A
Storybook Village.''
</P>
<P>
   Located about 25 miles southwest of Syracuse and about 140 miles
west of Albany, Skaneateles Lake is the easternmost of the Finger
Lakes. Iroquois legend has it that this region was formed when the
Great Spirit placed his hand over the land in blessing.
Skaneateles, an Iroquois word meaning ``long lake,'' is also the
highest of the Finger Lakes at 867 feet above sea level. And the
16-mile-long lake is reportedly one of the cleanest in the country.
Clear, greenish-blue, like delicately colored glass, it is also
arguably one of the most beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   We'd decided to visit Skaneateles on short notice. But
spontaneity being what it is, my fiance, Dan, and I soon discovered
that Skaneateles was booked solid in its peak season. (President
and Mrs. Clinton vacationed in the staunchly Republican retreat the
week before Labor Day.) No problem. There are several equally small
and charming towns nearby, so we secured a room at the Blakeslee
House Bed and Breakfast in Marcellus, just a few miles north.
</P>
<P>
   After driving through a heavy rainstorm, we arrived in Marcellus
just after the clouds parted and the sun came out. Our hostess, Bev
Blakeslee, wasn't home. But she left the front door open and a note
telling us to make ourselves comfortable. Our room was small but
adequate, the larger suite upstairs being occupied by newlyweds
from Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   We drove south through winding country roads, past
wooden-furniture shops and boating businesses, onto Route 20 (also
called Genesee Street), the long main street that leads through the
village of Skaneateles at the north end of the lake.
</P>
<P>
   In the historic downtown district, shops, restaurants, and
galleries are housed in restored buildings dating back to 1796.
There's a little bit of everything _ jewelry shops, gift shops, a
pet store, candy and coffee shops _ but there are no chain
restaurants here, no fast food, no minimalls. If you need a
deep-fry fix, the place to go is Doug's Fish Fry on Jordan Street.
</P>
<P>
   The popular old-fashioned grill offers heavy (but yummy) fried
shrimp and fish, french fries, and ice cream. There's only limited
counter seating in the kitchen area, but outside is a lovely garden
with picnic tables, and a separate two-story dining room with
wooden floors and long tables, which looks like a mess hall at
sleep-away camp.
</P>
<P>
   Down Hannum Street is the Skaneateles Historical Society,
located in a converted creamery that had operated from 1899 to
1949. There we learned that Skaneateles was first settled by the
white man in 1794, and by 1830 about 1,000 people called the
village home. A major industry was boat-building, the most famous
being ``The Lightening,'' a boat design that was first built in
Skaneateles and is still used today. The last boat company closed
after World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Other big enterprises included the cash crop teasel, a prickly
cob-like plant used in the woolen industry to raise the nap of
wool, and the manufacturing of sleighs and stagecoaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were quite an industrial area in the 1800s, which is hard
to believe since we're 99 percent tourism now,'' said village
historian Pat Blackler.
</P>
<P>
   Next we took a scenic drive down the western side of the lake on
Route 41A, past lush trees, cornfields and gracious homes. At the
southern tip of the lake we found the New Hope Mill, an operating
1823 flour mill that grinds buckwheat, a local crop. A tour of the
mill, which is powered by a huge overshot water wheel, is available
for $1 and can take 45 minutes. About halfway through the tour,
which was crowded with 25 or more people, we decided we had learned
all we needed to know about buckwheat flour and headed back to the
village.
</P>
<P>
   The Sherwood Inn was established in 1807 by Isaac Sherwood, a
300-pound mailman who eventually became a wealthy stagecoach baron.
The inn occupies a prime spot across from the north end of the
lake, and serves meals in its dining room and tavern, hosts
banquets and rents 20 guest rooms. The evening we visited, there
was a big wedding reception taking place, and the waitress said
they have some sort of function there almost every night.
</P>
<P>
   Touted as an exceptional restaurant, we found our dinner to be
average at best. The clams casino appetizer was overly breaded and
greasy, the scrod entree bland, the vegetables overcooked. The
exception was the portobello mushroom Wellington, which was wrapped
in a delicate pastry and accented with a light cream sauce. We also
enjoyed a bottle of Dr. Konstantin Frank's Johannisberg Riesling,
which the waitress said came from a vineyard near Keuka Lake, one
of the other Finger Lakes to the west.
</P>
<P>
   We had reserved tickets to attend the Skaneateles Festival, a
program of chamber music performed under the stars on a farm along
the lake in August and early September. Unfortunately, rain had
been forecast, the night was chilly (which can knock string
instruments out of tune), and the concert was moved indoors to the
much smaller St. Mary's of the Lake Church. A ticket didn't
guarantee us a seat, as we had been told, so we opted to enjoy the
beautiful night and explore the village.
</P>
<P>
   We stepped into Morris's Grill, a pub that sports a pool table
and dart board. Packed with tourists and locals, Morris's was fun
and friendly. The bartender poured stiff well drinks and played
great music. A couple of people from the wedding at the Sherwood
Inn were even inspired to dance to some Stray Cats tunes, which was
greeted with much enthusiastic clapping and cheering from the other
patrons.
</P>
<P>
   The bar at The Krebs was also hopping. We grabbed a table near
one of the many deer heads mounted on the wall, and ordered coffee
and dessert. The brownie a la mode was good, but the bread pudding
was too dry.
</P>
<P>
   After a less-than-restful night (Dan was awakened by the
newlyweds upstairs watching television, among other things), we
enjoyed a leisurely breakfast prepared by our hostess, then we
checked out and drove back into town for an afternoon brunch cruise
around the lake.
</P>
<P>
   The cruise on the double-decker Judge Ben Wiles was the
highlight of the trip, despite the fact that the brunch itself was
the equivalent of airplane food. For three hours we glided across
the glistening water as the captain pointed out elegant waterfront
homes, including the one where the Clintons stayed.
</P>
<P>
   On the way back home, we took a few detours, first to Camillus,
where we took a quick, free tour of the Wilcox-Fox Octagon House, a
funky, strawberry-colored eight-sided home built in 1856. Then we
continued east down Route 20, to Cazenovia, another quaint village
on a lake. We stopped in at The Lincklaen House for a lovely dinner
on the patio. For $20 each, we ordered fresh salads, a delicious
smoked salmon appetizer, bruchetta, tasty seafood pasta, and
lemon-seasoned salmon wrapped in phyllo dough. They even packed
some dessert to go.
</P>
<P>
   Satisfied, we found headed for home, eating chocolate mousse.

GOVERNOR SENDS MIXED MESSAGE ON NEEDLE EXCHANGES 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ As California Gov. Gray Davis ponders vetoing
local needle exchange programs, I wish he'd look at his own logic
and recognize its obvious flaw.
</P>
<P>
   Fatal flaw.
</P>
<P>
   According to Davis' spokesman, Michael Bustamante, the governor
is inclined toward a veto because he ``believes there are other
ways to address AIDS transmission and drug use without sending a
mixed message to California youth with state-sanctioned needle
exchanges.''
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that every medical and social services specialist in
the field of HIV transmission _ the people who actually work with
intravenous drug users every day _ have testified repeatedly to the
urgency and efficacy of needle exchange programs.
</P>
<P>
   Never mind that six separate federally funded studies have found
that needle exchange programs not only decrease the transmission of
the human immunodeficiency syndrome, they do it without causing
drug use to rise.
</P>
<P>
   And _ strange though it seems for a governor so enamored of
public opinion polls _ never mind that a majority of adults in all
regions of the state who were polled by the Field Institute support
needle exchange programs to halt the spread of HIV and some strains
of hepatitis.
</P>
<P>
   Even if Californians approve of the idea, and federal studies
say it works, and the people on the front lines of the war against
HIV say it will save lives, the governor doesn't want to send any
``mixed messages'' to kids.
</P>
<P>
   If that sort of reasoning is sufficient to ignore the public and
the specialists, then why don't we apply it to a whole passel of
things that are sanctioned by the state of California?
</P>
<P>
   Like speed limits.
</P>
<P>
   Aren't we sending mixed messages to our youth by allowing people
to drive 70 mph on some freeways and only 50 on others? Or by
simply allowing anybody to drive 70 mph anywhere in the state?
</P>
<P>
   Back when all highways were stuck with a mandated 55 mph maximum
speed, fatalities dropped markedly. By sanctioning the higher
limit, isn't the state telling young people that it doesn't care if
more people die, so long as we can all drive faster?
</P>
<P>
   What about liquor laws?
</P>
<P>
   The state says it's bad and wrong for a person who is 20 years,
11 months and 3 weeks old to buy or consume alcohol. But add
another week and let the person turn 21, and the state says it's
okey-dokey.
</P>
<P>
   If that isn't a mixed and confusing message, what is?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe the state shouldn't sanction alcohol consumption for
anyone. All you have to imbibe is enough to get a blood alcohol
reading of 0.08 percent, and you're considered legally drunk and
unfit to operate a motor vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on people's size, weight, age and metabolism, it might
take anywhere from one lite beer to three martinis to reach 0.08.
Isn't that a mixed and confusing message? Why don't we make it
illegal to drive with any alcohol in the blood?
</P>
<P>
   And why do we allow some people to pay their income taxes in
August even though we tell everybody it's the law to pay by April
15?
</P>
<P>
   It's a scary thought, but maybe the governor actually believes
that millions of kids and teens would look at San Rafael
Assemblywoman Kerry Mazzoni's needle exchange bill and conclude:
``Gosh, I wasn't going to take drugs, but the state says it's fine,
so I'm going to shoot illegal, addictive substances into my veins
as soon as I can.''
</P>
<P>
   From what I know of kids, as soon as they think adults approve
of a taboo behavior _ let alone the stodgy old state _ the behavior
suddenly doesn't seem like such a cool idea.
</P>
<P>
   More compelling, my experience also tells me that most kids
aren't remotely stupid enough to confuse a program that provides
clean needles to people already addicted to drugs with a
state-sanctioned carte blanche for illegal drug use.
</P>
<P>
   Clean needles help prevent intravenous drug users from
contracting HIV and dying. That is an indisputable fact whose
message is about as mixed and confusing as tap water.
</P>

THESE SUN GODS AREN'T AFRAID OF CATCHING RAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CELINA OTTAWAY  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Greek myth has it that Clytie, the daughter of
the king of Babylon, was forsaken in love by the sun-god Apollo
because he turned his attention to her sister. The myth is
recounted in the, ``Dictionary of Subjects and Symbols in Art'' by
James Hall.
</P>
<P>
   Clytie's jealousy caused her sister's death. Still, she was
spurned by Apollo. Slowly Clytie wasted away and turned into a
flower that always faces toward the sun. The marigold was the
likely flower in the myth.
</P>
<P>
   Later, the larger more dramatic common sunflower was imported
from its native North America to Europe. Poets and painters used
the flowers' movement as they followed the sun as a symbol of the
same kind of unending devotion.
</P>
<P>
   Biologists prefer to cite biochemical reactions and swelling
cells to explain the turning.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of plants will move during the day,'' said John Hunter,
a professor of biological sciences at the State University College
at Brockport. ``We tend to think of plants just moving when they
wilt or grow. But some plants move in response to the sun, either
following it or avoiding it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some desert plants turn their leaves so that the thin edge is
facing the sun. This way they absorb as little heat as possible.
Others plants in colder climates will keep the flat side of their
leaves facing the sun to stay warm.
</P>
<P>
   Many kinds of flowering plants turn toward the sun: marigolds,
some members of the pea family, and the flat-growing ground weed
purslane are just a few.
</P>
<P>
   But none captivate and mystify the way a field of 8-foot stalks
topped with yellow disks do. The wide flat circles surrounded by
rays of yellow seem to both follow the sun and reflect its image.
</P>
<P>
   Here's how sun worship works at the molecular level:
</P>
<P>
   When the sun hits the molecules in a sunflower stem, it sets off
a series of biochemical reactions that move hormones away from that
part of the plant. The hormones shift to the section of the stem
that is away from the light and cause it to lengthen. This bends
the plant's head toward the sun.
</P>
<P>
   ``As the sun moves across the sky, it strikes different parts of
the plant, causing the plant to bend and twist,'' Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   The common sunflower is part of the Asteraceae family, along
with black-eyed susans, dandelions and goldenrod. There are more
than 20,000 species in the family, including 150 species of
sunflowers. Not all Asteraceae turn with the sun.
</P>
<P>
   The plants are characterized by the disks, or heads, at the top
of their stems. From a distance, each head looks like a flower, but
is in fact a cluster of smaller flowers. The heads are surrounded
by long thin flowers that look like petals. On a sunflower, these
are the long yellow rays that surround the plant's face. The tiny
flowers in the face's yellow cluster bear fruit, known as the
sunflower seed.
</P>
<P>
   Why the sunflower turns its face to the sun is harder to
explain, Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   It may be that the light and warmth on the flowers affects the
behavior of insects that the plant needs for pollination. It may be
that the plant turns in order to benefit the stem or the leaves;
the head just turns because it is attached. It could be that the
warmth of the sun helps the fruit ripen.
</P>
<P>
   The mechanisms that turn sunflowers are at work from the time
the plant emerges from the seed to the time it dies, Hunter said.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be any other way with such a devotion?

KIDS MAY BRING MORE THAN BOOKS HOME FROM SCHOOL

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Every parent dreads a phone call from the school
nurse, but anxiety is compounded by disgust when the problem is
head lice.
</P>
<P>
   Head lice is one of the most common childhood problems. This
year, up to 20 million people in the United States are expected to
become infected, with the majority of cases in children under 12.
</P>
<P>
   As children head back to school, health experts are advising
that families take a proactive approach to dealing with the tiny
parasites.
</P>
<P>
   While nothing will guarantee that your child won't become
infested, you can minimize the opportunities by following some
common sense strategies:
</P>
<P>
   _ Remind your child not to share hair accessories or combs.
</P>
<P>
   _ Ask your school about ways to make sure coats and hats don't
mix in the cloak room. Some parents send their children to school
with a plastic bag to keep their coats separate.
</P>
<P>
   _ Comb your child's hair daily. Catching the problem early makes
it easier to manage.
</P>
<P>
   _ If your child has long hair, keep it pulled back.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of the prevention measures are really just paying
attention to your child's head,'' said Kathy Sen, acting
supervising Community Health Nurse at the Schenectady County Public
Health Department
</P>
<P>
   Yet even with the best vigilance, many children still get lice.
</P>
<P>
   In those cases, Dr. Joseph Hayes, a Schenectady County
physician, reminds parents not to panic or go overboard with toxic
prescription or over-the-counter shampoos that can cause
neurological problems if misused.
</P>
<P>
   Head lice by themselves are a nuisance, not a health hazard.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have the perception that it's such a terrible thing,''
he said. ``It's important to stress that it's a common thing that
healthy people get.''
</P>
<P>
   Adult lice look like six-legged grains of rice. They lay eggs
(known as nits) in hair, suck blood through the scalp and cause
itching.
</P>
<P>
   Known by their scientific name of Pediculosis humanus capitis,
lice are found worldwide and have been around for thousands of
years. Archaeologists have found evidence of head lice in the hair
of Egyptian mummies.
</P>
<P>
   And over the years, dozens of remedies, from pesticides to
mayonnaise, have been put forward as a way to solve the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an old medical adage that when there are a lot of
treatments, you can be sure there is no cure,'' said Deborah
Altschuler of the National Pediculosis Association in
Massachusetts. Over the years, she has heard horror stories about
parents burning their children with kerosene in an effort to get
rid of the pests.
</P>
<P>
   More common is the problem of parents misusing pesticide
shampoos, particularly those containing Lindane, a chemical that is
not only carcinogenic but highly flammable.
</P>
<P>
   On the other end, many companies are now starting to market
all-natural remedies to repel and remove lice.
</P>
<P>
   One such company, ARR Health Technologies Inc. in Massachusetts,
has come out with a mineral-oil-based hair spray that it claims
kept children lice-free in clinical studies done in Israel. Lice
Guard is slated to be on drugstore shelves this fall.
</P>
<P>
   Altschuler is skeptical.
</P>
<P>
   ``Repelling head lice is a tall order,'' she said. ``Where are
they going to go? Your eyebrows? Head lice will feed on your arm if
they can't feed on your head.''
</P>
<P>
   That's why she echoes the consensus among many health experts:
The best way to get rid of lice is with thorough combing to remove
the nits that might cause reinfestation. ``People comb their hair
every day anyway,'' she said. ``That's where we want people to
start.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen still remembers how desperate she felt when her own son
contracted lice almost 15 years ago. She vacuumed the house, washed
his bedding in hot water and bagged up her son's toys and stuffed
animals in plastic to kill any wanderers.
</P>
<P>
   Today, as a public health nurse, she offers those kinds of tips
and a sympathetic ear to parents. ``It's a lot of work for parents
to deal with,'' she said.

FASHIONS HELP DEFINE CHARACTERS IN EDGY HBO SERIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CYNTHIA ROBINS  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The best-dressed women on television are three
thirtysomethings and a 40-year-old for whom life is a constant
smorgasbord of designer clothes, lavish parties and one-night
stands.
</P>
<P>
   You will find them on ``Sex and the City,'' HBO's
Emmy-nominated, half-hour sitcom airing Sunday nights that marches
the plight of the unmarried New York babe right off the edge of
propriety.
</P>
<P>
   One of the major pleasures of watching the show is to see what
the women will be wearing from week to week. And their looks are no
accident _ they're very carefully put together by a pair of women
named Field: Patricia Field, well-known for her eponymous and
notorious Greenwich Village shop, and her partner, Rebecca Field
(no relation).
</P>
<P>
   Before she started costuming for theater and TV series, Patricia
Field and her shop were a source for fashion ideas that would later
turn up everywhere, including edgy stuff like fetish-wear shoes,
Spandex leggings (she had them first) and up-to-the-nanosecond
club-kid gear.
</P>
<P>
   Field and Field could have gone totally Madison Avenue with the
usual high-fashion New York stuff _ your basic Ralph Lauren/Calvin
Klein fashionista look. But to their credit, they have chosen edge
over predictability, which is totally in keeping with who Field and
Field are.
</P>
<P>
   Rebecca Field comes out of the club-kid scene. She is really
Rebecca Weinberg, a self-described ``Texas Jewish girl'' and
performance artist who moved to New York from Atlanta with drag
star RuPaul to appear in the New York underground in male drag as a
singer-dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, she signed on with Patricia Field as a production
assistant and adopted the name ``Field'' to identify the
partnership as a collective, or, as she says, ``a family sort of
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The results of their labors can be seen on four carefully
delineated characters who have taste (some of it questionable) that
jibes directly with the message of the show: That the single New
York career woman is adorable, stylish, outrageous and
unpredictable.
</P>
<P>
   The series was created and produced by Darren Star, an Aaron
Spelling Productions escapee who turned Heather Locklear's legs and
hair into lethal weapons on ``Beverly Hills, 90210'' and ``Melrose
Place.'' Now, with the help of Fields, the focus is on belly
buttons, abs and assorted other, often-unclothed, body parts.
</P>
<P>
   This is, after all, cable.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City'' is based on Candace Bushnell's New York
Observer column and subsequent best-selling book of the same name.
It features Sarah Jessica Parker, 5-feet-4 and a Size 0 (that's
enough to give any red-blooded American woman addicted to Chunky
Monkey a bit of performance anxiety) as Carrie Bradshaw, a New York
freelance journalist whose subject is her peers _ single New York
women and their three principle fetishes: Clothes, food and sex.
</P>
<P>
   Particularly sex.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie has three best friends, each one an archetype of the New
York single woman. Kim Cattrall is Samantha, the fading 40-ish
party girl who bounces from bed to bed with lust in her eyes and
hope in her heart; Cynthia Nixon is Miranda, a red-headed lawyer
who is as tightly strung as a Stradivarius; and Kristin Davis is
Charlotte, a deeply superficial art dealer whose taste in men is a
whole lot worse than her taste in art or clothes.
</P>
<P>
   All four women are dressed in the latest styles as befits their
characters, that is: fashion-forward women with enough money to
indulge their various clothing and shoe addictions.
</P>
<P>
   Carrie, who is a pocket-sized Venus, dresses mostly in
sophisticated hippie-princess mode, baring her abs as often as she
can and affecting tight skimp sweaters, skirts that fall off her
pelvic bones and backless, high-heeled slides. Her style, says
Patricia Field, ``is based on Sarah Jessica's personal style.''
That she can wear just about anything, says Patricia Field, ``makes
my job easier.''
</P>
<P>
   As the sole brunette of the ``Sex and the City'' foursome,
Kristin, who comes off as a Chapin/Dalton school prepster, is, says
Patricia Field, ``more conservative. She reads magazines and buys
accordingly. This year, it's Tocca. Next year, it will be something
else.''
</P>
<P>
   Samantha, well, ``She's been through it and she knows it,''
Field says. ``She's a bit of an '80s throwback, which was her time.
We put her in the Alexis Carrington-style power suit and we like it
to have a shine or something that indicates that she's maybe a
little retro, a little off.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Cynthia Nixon, the redhead, ``We've been experimenting
with her. We wanted to get her away from those lawyer suits. We
wanted to move her into a more interesting mix of clothing _ some
ethnic things and more textures.''
</P>

   In a recent episode, the costumers dressed the redhead in
colorful (not to mention very tight) Custo Barcelona T-shirts and
skirts.
</P>
<P>
   Field says that dressing an actress for a specific role depends
upon three considerations: ``You have your character and you have
the actress and you have the real person this character is based
on, or the script.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this instance, Candace Bushnell was her own character. She
made her statement. We take Sarah Jessica, who is portraying her,
and we don't look at what Bushnell wears, but we look at the
broader concept of it: Who is this person and how come she has to
be what she is?''
</P>
<P>
   What Carrie Bradshaw is is a woman who takes her laptop to bed
as she's bouncing around in a bra and panties, accessorized by a
kitschy, gold name necklace _ which, notes Field, has set off a fad
among 13-year-old girls _ and a Playboy bunny charm on a gold
chain. In other words: This is someone who understands irony.
</P>
<P>
   And she is someone who can agonize over wearing her hair
straight in one episode _ as she did when she left a hair dryer at
the apartment of her lover, ``Mr. Big'' (Chris Noth) _ and then
blithely wear an almost-see-through, floaty nude chiffon number to
have her promotional pictures taken for a bus placard.
</P>
<P>
   Propriety sometimes scampers through her mind; but not too
often.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's obviously very savvy because she writes about the city
where she has a full, single life,'' Field says. ``Because she does
not report for work like other people, she is completely
independent to do and wear what she wants.''
</P>
<P>
   Which makes Carrie Bradshaw (and Sarah Jessica Parker) the dream
date for her costumer. ``She is a very complex character,'' notes
Field, ``and her wardrobe defines her complexity.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   She is not ``a character who says, `I wear only vintage. Or
designer.'''
</P>
<P>
   Charlotte, on the other hand, wears Vogue or fashion mag stuff;
Samantha buys what Field calls ``sex-minded clothes,'' that are not
as up-to-date as her friends' wardrobes. She's a prime example of
the woman who gets stuck in time and clings to the period where she
thought she looked her best, or when her life was most intense.
</P>
<P>
   The Fields have taken on another complex personality, Heather
Locklear, who is making the jump from ``Melrose Place'' to Michael
Fox's hit comedy, ``Spin City,'' and is dropping her hemlines
accordingly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've pulled everything from Yves Saint Laurent Rive Gauche
and John Galliano for Dior to Gucci to Michael Kors. We're trying
to mix it up. She's sent us some tear sheets of how she sees this
character and it's a little harder-edged than what we see. But
we're definitely dropping the length of her skirts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sex and the City's'' four women, who seem to be on a
continuous whirl of cocktail parties, art openings, lunches out and
charity dos, dress up a lot, even when they're not ``dressed.''
Their closets are filled with designer names like Galliano, Marc
Jacobs, Dolce &AMP; Gabbana and some Donna Karan, although Field
decries that line as ``not shapely. It has gotten so baggy and not
body-conscious.''
</P>
<P>
   What both the Fields are looking for is clothes with ``edge,''
clothes that reveal the lifestyle.

FUN, FILTH COME OF AGE IN `PROVIDENCE' 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those expecting a gel-by-gel follow-up to the Farrelly
Brothers' most recent smash comedy, forget it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Outside Providence'' is neither ``There's Something About Mary
Redux'' nor any possible variation on the theme (``There's
Something Else About Mary''? ``I Still Know What You Did to Mary
Last Summer''?), though it does boast a couple of slightly
repulsive moments.
</P>
<P>
   A protagonist nicknamed after an unprintable erotic device is
one clue that we're on familiar Farrelly turf.
</P>
<P>
   It's not theirs alone. Although ``Outside Providence'' was
produced by Bobby Farrelly and co-written by Peter Farrelly from
his own novel, it was directed _ and co-written and co-produced _
by Michael Corrente, whose first two films (``Federal Hill'' and
``American Buffalo'') were heavy, character-driven dramas.
</P>
<P>
   Corrente is not a filmmaker for whom gross-out jokes come
naturally. But in ``Outside Providence'' this unlikely threesome
has created a fitfully funny, fitfully touching coming-of-age
comedy that looks at a working-class kid's senior year in a posh
Connecticut prep school.
</P>
<P>
   The era is the mid-1970s; the location is Pawtucket, R.I., a
scruffy industrial town outside Providence. Tim Dunphy (Shawn
Hatosy), the guy with the nickname, has a disabled brother (``We
were playin' touch football, and he fell off the roof,'' Tim
explains), a growly dad (Alec Baldwin, confirming that he was born
for weirdo character roles) and a mother who died when he was
small.
</P>
<P>
   He also has a circle of permanently and recreationally drugged
friends. When the bunch of them rear-end a police cruiser while
bombed on bong hits, Tim gets packed off to the Cornwall School for
Boys in Cornwall, Conn. There he encounters the usual run of
druggies, preppies, nerds and snide administrators (particularly
one named Mr. Funderburk, played by Tim Crowe), as well as a
beatific corn-fed beauty (Amy Smart) who attends the girls' school
down the road.
</P>
<P>
   The plot at this point isn't much to speak of, and it's facilely
predicted at every turn: Guy woos girl, guy smokes weed, guy
hatches practical jokes, guy gets in biiiiig trouble with Mr.
Funderburk. The best snippets in the Cornwall half of the movie
involve Tim's bespectacled squid of a roommate, played by Jack
Waltham with extraordinary, orb-eyed discomfort.
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, the best stuff is all Pawtucket. Hatosy, best
known from ``The Faculty'' and ``In &AMP; Out,'' gives a mash-mouthed
sibilance to all of his lines (``I know I'm not gonna shay thish
right'') and struts like a randy bulldog. His homegrown friends are
amiable potheads, among them a character named Drugs (a sweetly
out-there Jon Abrahams); his analysis of the inspirational poem
``Footprints'' is a succinct gem. Counterbalancing these scenes are
poker nights with Tim's dad, whose circle of pals includes George
Wendt as a galoot with a secret.
</P>
<P>
   Baldwin is, while we're on the subject, a reason to see the
movie. Much more sympathetic (and funny) as this ursine mess of a
man than he's ever been playing the hero, he turns the elder Dunphy
into a gently tragicomic figure. His scenes with Hatosy are tender
without being trite, a far cry from the cliched histrionics that
punch up the drama at Cornwall School.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess you'll never forgive me until it happens to you,
Timothy,'' he says, after his son confronts him over the death of
his mother. ``Well, I hope you'll never forgive me.''
</P>
<P>
   Misty eyes in a Farrelly film? And not a mistaken hair product
in sight? Yes. And yes again.

THE HUNGER WEAPON: DEPRIVING CIVILIANS OF FOOD A VICIOUS TOOL OF
MODERN WARFARE 

</HEADLINE>

 &HT;    War is not carried on by arms alone. It is lawful to starve the
hostile belligerent, armed or unarmed, so that it leads to the
speedier subjection of the enemy. _ Article 17 of Instructions for
the Government of Armies of the United States in the Field (Lieber
Code) 1863 
 
 &HT;    Starvation of civilians as a method of warfare is prohibited. _
Protocol 1, Article 54, The Geneva Convention, 1949

<P>
   TAJURA, Sudan _ To the Sudanese forces who attacked this hot,
dusty village with artillery and tanks early this year, killing its
inhabitants was of little immediate concern.
</P>
<P>
   That, the soldiers hoped, would come later.
</P>
<P>
   On that January morning, as it has been throughout the
government's campaign to drive the rebellious population out of
Sudan's isolated Nuba Mountains, the troops' primary mission was to
destroy the people's ability to feed themselves and to force them
off their land.
</P>
<P>
   The soldiers slaughtered livestock. They burned houses and grain
stores. They poisoned the precious wells. They bombed the nearby
airstrip, the people's only link to the outside world. And they
laid waste the fields of sorghum, the staff of life in this remote
part of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``They destroyed everything,'' said Mohamed Tutu, a 28-year-old
father of four children, recalling the pre-dawn raid that destroyed
his life. ``They killed many cows and burned my house. They chased
us away into the hills.''
</P>
<P>
   It has been 10 years since the Nuba people, in their quest for
self-determination, joined the rebels of Sudan's south in a brutal,
seemingly endless civil war against the government. And for 10
years, deliberately and efficiently, government forces have emptied
the fertile valleys of people, leaving the areas silent and barren.
</P>
<P>
   Where once there were 1 million people, less than half remain.
And what drove them out was hunger, not bombs or bullets _ a hunger
they feared more than the rumble of the tanks in the night.
</P>
<P>
   They feared it wisely.
</P>
<P>
   The current round of the civil war between the fundamentalist
Islamic, Arab government of Sudan and the mostly non-Islamic, black
African tribes of the south and their Nuba allies in the north has
lasted 16 years and has caused the deaths of more than 2 million
people, more than any conflict since World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Of those, only about 50,000 were soldiers who died in combat,
according to a study for the U.S. Committee for Refugees titled
``Quantifying Genocide in Southern Sudan and the Nuba Mountains''
by Millard Burr, a former U.S. State Department official.
</P>
<P>
   The vast majority of the dead were civilians who starved or fell
to a host of afflictions that hover around famines like flies.
</P>
<P>
   In this interminable, intractable war _ as it is in myriad other
conflicts _ hunger is the preferred weapon of mass destruction, not
guns and bombs.
</P>
<P>
   One of the great successes of this century is that more than
enough food is produced to feed every soul on the planet. Another
is the growth of humanitarianism, a multibillion-dollar industry
devoted to aiding those whose lives are torn asunder by armed
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   Yet in Sudan, in Kosovo, in Somalia, in Afghanistan, in Iraq, to
name just a few, wars waged for a host of reasons bear at least one
thing in common: Millions of civilians who are caught in the middle
die or are set adrift on an ocean of refugees because, by one means
or another, they are deprived of food.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a novel concept. The soldiers who rousted Tutu and
his neighbors from their huts and left them with nothing to eat
were doing what raiding parties have done for centuries. &UR;  &LR; But
unlike other weapons of antiquity rendered obsolete by man's
incessant quest for a better way of killing, hunger alone has
endured as one of the most lethal tools of war ever conceived.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes back to the Middle Ages,'' said Jean Francois Vidal of
Action Against Hunger, a private French humanitarian-aid agency.
``But it is more vicious now. Now we have warring parties who
purposely starve the people so they can attract international
attention and millions of dollars in humanitarian assistance.''
</P>
<P>
   Actually, it's billions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   During the Cold War, independent aid agencies played relatively
minor roles in conflicts driven by the superpowers. Since the Cold
War ended, however, they have become a potent force, developing
into an influential industry that spends an estimated $8 billion a
year on emergency assistance. And because international relief now
plays such a large role in the economics and politics of war,
concern is growing that despite the industry's noble intent, the
rush to aid the afflicted may also be abetting those who have a
stake in waging war.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think humanitarian aid (overall) is doing more harm
than good,'' said Joanna Macrae, an aid policy researcher at the
Overseas Development Institute in London. ``But it is true that it
can be, and is being, manipulated to the benefit of the warring
parties.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than any other type of aid, food is most prone to
manipulation. It is stolen and diverted. It feeds the soldiers. It
makes merchants rich. It is used as a magnet to move masses of
people at will. It is denied to some, given to others. And nowhere
is this manipulation more of an art than in Sudan, where not even
the largest food relief operation in history has been able to stop
the cycle of war and famine.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan may be the poster child for the use of hunger as a weapon
of war, but it is not alone.
</P>
<P>
   For months, before Slobodan Milosevic launched his onslaught
against the ethnic Albanians of Kosovo earlier this year and
sparked 11 weeks of aerial bombardment by NATO, the Yugoslav leader
systematically degraded the Kosovars' ability to feed themselves,
aid experts said. His forces burned food supplies and crops,
destroyed livestock, prevented farmers from planting or reaping,
restricted the import of basic food items and looted the warehouses
of the aid agencies trying to provide assistance.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not aware of the calculated steps Milosevic has
taken over the past year to use food as a weapon,'' said Bill
Frelick, a senior policy analyst for the U.S. Committee for
Refugees. ``After systematically depleting Kosovo of its food
stocks, he can freely use starvation as a tool of genocide.''
</P>
<P>
   The same could be said of the protagonists in civil wars in
Liberia, Angola, Afghanistan and Sierra Leone, where rebels are
known to have amputated the hands of some villagers simply to
prevent them from harvesting their rice.
</P>
<P>
   Even in the United Nations' protracted, low-grade war against
Iraq, the food weapon has been as effective as a Tomahawk missile
or a laser-guided bomb.
</P>
<P>
   Severe sanctions imposed on the country by the United Nations
after the 1991 Persian Gulf War resulted in the deaths of tens of
thousands of children from hunger and related ills, according to
the United Nations. The situation eased in 1996 when Iraqi
President Saddam Hussein was permitted to sell some of his
country's oil to buy food and medicine.
</P>
<P>
   In Sudan's Nuba Mountains, the children are dying of hunger,
too. But not until late June of this year did the Khartoum
government allow the world to begin counting how many.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years ago, Sudan's Islamic government declared a
``jihad,'' or holy war, against the Nuba people and closed the
mountains to the outside. Two years later, the Khartoum government
set about destroying the people's food supplies and banned all
deliveries of aid. It bombed schools, hospitals and airstrips that
the people had managed to carve out of the rocks.
</P>
<P>
   One hundred thousand, maybe 200,000, have died in the region.
Nobody knows exactly how many. Hundreds of thousands more have fled
the hunger and the bombs, lured to government ``peace camps'' where
food aid is permitted, but where the people reportedly are abused.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many, like Mohamed Tutu, a sinewy man in his prime, chose to
retreat deeper into the mountains, to build new homes on the rocky
flanks, to coax the sorghum from terraces cut into the steep
slopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all I can do,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
THE MANIPULATION OF AID &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As the African sky lightens with dawn, the chant of the
``muezzin,'' or prayer-caller, is drowned by the roar of a C-130
Hercules cargo plane taking off from the Operation Lifeline Sudan
airstrip in Lokichoggio, Kenya. Loaded with 16 tons of food, it is
headed for a drop zone deep in the heart of southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Minutes later it is followed by another, and, minutes after
that, by still another. Not until the last trace of light fades in
the west does the coming and going of the planes stop. In the
morning it will begin again, as it will the day after that, as it
has, virtually seven days a week, for the past 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   A decade ago, Lokichoggio was little more than a collection of
huts a few miles from the Sudanese border, populated by about 150
people, mostly from the Toposa and Turkana tribes. Today, it houses
30,000 people of all nationalities and serves as headquarters to
one of the largest relief operations in history.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Lifeline Sudan, a consortium of United Nations
agencies and about 40 nongovernmental aid organizations, was
created in 1989 by the United Nations in response to a particularly
deadly, largely man-made famine that killed an estimated 250,000 in
southern Sudan. At the time, the U.N.-led alliance was a unique
experiment in the delivery of food and other humanitarian aid.
Never before had combatants on both sides allowed the United
Nations to mount a relief operation in the midst of a civil war.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1992, the U.N. operation has spent nearly half a billion
dollars delivering more than 500,000 tons of food to millions of
people in dire circumstances on both sides of the war in Sudan.
There is no question that many of them would have died without it.
</P>
<P>
   But the inescapable truth is that so far, despite its best
efforts, Operation Lifeline Sudan has not been able to stop the
famines. Moreover, concern is growing among some people within the
organization, as well as academics, aid workers and politicians on
the outside, that the food being dropped into the maw of the civil
war may be helping to feed it.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a strong school of thought that says humanitarian aid
in a complex emergency like this one prolongs the war,'' said a
senior official in an aid agency that works in Sudan outside the
U.N. umbrella and who did not want to be identified. ``The truth is
that the aid industry does not know enough about the ripple effects
of injecting aid directly into a war.''
</P>
<P>
   What the industry does know is that the nature of warfare has
changed ominously in the past 20 years: No longer content to rely
solely on famine as the tactical weapon of choice, the makers of
war have now added to their arsenals the manipulation of
humanitarian aid that those famines attract.
</P>
<P>
   ``Both the government and the (rebels) have shifted from using
starvation as a military tactic to the strategic manipulation of
aid, both to provision their forces and to protect key garrisons,''
wrote Alex de Waal, a former senior analyst for the humanitarian
organization African Rights and an expert on aid in Sudan. ``The
structure of the aid programs has come to have an important
influence over the structure of the military command.''
</P>
<P>
   For Sudan's government, de Waal said, the aid has made it
possible to maintain its garrison towns in the south, particularly
Juba, the largest and, for the rebels, the ultimate prize. Airdrops
of food by Operation Lifeline Sudan into Juba have repeatedly saved
the town from falling into the hands of the rebels who surround it.
</P>
<P>
   For the rebels, the airdrops have proved to be a major source of
provisions after neighboring Ethiopia cut off military and food aid
in 1991. One rebel commander, de Waal said, was alleged to have
deliberately attracted aid by corralling a group of destitute
refugees and keeping them in a state of near starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Such manipulation by both sides demonstrates the essential flaw
in Sudan's relief operation. It is widely held within the
assistance industry that to be effective, aid workers must have
direct access to those who are suffering, be allowed to decide what
the people need, and make sure that they get what is delivered.
</P>
<P>
   In Sudan, the workers have no such independence.
</P>
<P>
   Because Sudan is recognized by the United Nations as a sovereign
nation, its president, Lt. Gen. Umar Hasan Ahmad al-Bashir, and the
ruling National Islamic Front have absolute authority over where
and when and how much food can be dropped from the air. Throughout
the war, the government has abused this power, say relief workers
and Western officials. They add that the government repeatedly and
consistently denies Operation Lifeline Sudan access to vulnerable
people in rebel-held territory, while permitting unrestricted
access to people in those areas it controls.
</P>
<P>
   For two months last year, in apparent retaliation for rebel
attacks on three of its garrison towns, the government banned
relief flights into the southern province of Bahr el Ghazal. Sixty
thousand people died in the resulting famine, and they did so at a
rate seldom seen before.
</P>
<P>
   As recently as last month, Operation Lifeline Sudan warned that
an arbitrarily imposed government ban on relief flights into the
Western Upper Nile was placing as many as 150,000 people at risk of
starvation. The ban, which is still in effect, was condemned by
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin as ``the latest example
of civilian needs being subjugated to military needs in this
long-running war.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, for the past five years the Khartoum government has
banned all relief flights into the Nuba Mountains in an attempt to
drive out the people. Only in June did the government relent under
intense international pressure and allow a U.N. team into the
mountains to assess the condition of the people.
</P>
<P>
   ``The biggest failing of Operation Lifeline Sudan is the failure
to achieve access to the people who are being targeted in the war,
like the Nuba Mountains,'' said Dan Collison, the program director
for southern Sudan for the British charity Christian Aid, one of
the few aid agencies able and willing to risk being shot out of the
sky to fly food into the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most cynical aspect of the Sudanese government's
manipulation of the aid is that, arguably, it doesn't need it. Last
year, while 60,000 of its people were dying of starvation, Sudan
produced a record 6.5 million tons of food, according to the United
Nations, which is more than enough to feed everyone in the country.
</P>
<P>
   On the other side, the Sudanese People's Liberation Army, the
biggest of Sudan's various rebel factions that controls virtually
the entire southern half of the country, wields enormous influence
on which populations are targeted for relief. The rebel
organization also monitors the distribution of the food that has
been dropped into the areas it controls.
</P>
<P>
   And it is common knowledge that on both sides of the conflict,
but particularly in the rebel camp, food intended for the victims
of the war ends up feeding the soldiers fighting it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In any war, the last ones to die of hunger will be the
soldiers,'' said Claude Jibidar, the liaison officer for the World
Food Program in Lokichoggio. ``We are handing over each and every
bag (of food) to a woman who has walked two or three days, and then
they are walking two to three days back. We cannot follow every one
of these women back to their homes to make sure it doesn't get
looted.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's frustrating, damn frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A DISASTER OF EPIC PROPORTIONS &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In better times, before it joined Africa's burgeoning list of
synonyms for death, Ajiep was a village of about 120 souls lost in
the ocean-flat vastness of southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   The people of Ajiep, like the Dinka elsewhere in Bahr el Ghazal,
eked out a living herding livestock and growing grain on small
plots next to their mud houses. Villagers fished in the nearby Jur
River, migrated with their cattle to marshlands in the dry season
and moved to whatever high ground they could find during the
frequent floods that come with the rains.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In January 1998, in the nearby government-held garrison of Wau,
troops slaughtered innocent civilians after rebels attempted to
capture the town. As a result, some 120,000 people poured into
Ajiep. The village was one of only four where the Khartoum
government allowed the United Nations to drop relief food, which,
in turn, attracted more refugees.
</P>
<P>
   Desperately hungry people crowded together near Ajiep's dirt
airstrip to await the food. Others, hearing there was food in the
town, arrived from many miles around. Both the village elders and
the few foreign aid workers in the town were quickly overwhelmed.
</P>
<P>
   Ajiep became an epicenter for the latest southern Sudanese
famine.
</P>
<P>
   ``They were rushing in with the resources, but there was no
preparation,'' says Mawiir Nyok, a 33-year-old former U.N.
chauffeur who is in charge of the rebels' relief efforts in the
Ajiep area. ``It was difficult to manage, actually.''
</P>
<P>
   That is putting it too mildly, perhaps. Some called what
happened in Ajiep and other areas of Bahr el Ghazal last year a
disaster of epic proportions, a man-made and man-perpetuated
tragedy that killed people at rates never before seen in famines.
</P>
<P>
   Much soul searching has taken place within the aid industry and
Operation Lifeline Sudan about the response to the famine last
year. Why did so many people continue to die when so much food was
being delivered in one of the biggest relief airlifts in history?
</P>
<P>
   Much of the blame for the famine has been placed on the Sudanese
government, which banned flights into the most desperate rebel-held
areas of Bahr el Ghazal for as long as two months. When the
government finally relented under pressure, 380,000 people were in
immediate danger of starvation.
</P>
<P>
   And much of the blame has been placed on the rebels. Inept
attacks by maverick rebel warlord Kerubino Kuanyin Bol on three key
communities provoked panic-driven exoduses. Hundreds of thousands
of people, already dispossessed and on the edge of oblivion, were
uprooted and descended on towns that were unable and unwilling to
shelter them.
</P>
<P>
   But, in the view of aid workers, at least some of the
responsibility for what happened must be shouldered by the Western
nations that provided the food and turned a deaf ear to the dire
warnings from Operation Lifeline Sudan that a disaster was in the
offing. Even after the famine was in full bloom, Western donors
continued to doubt that the situation was as bad as the officials
on the ground were saying it was.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the slow start, the West's response to the famine
steadily gained momentum after the Sudanese government lifted the
flight ban. What had been a trickle of food into Bahr el Ghazal in
April of 1998 _ about 800 tons that month _ became a river by June,
when 4,000 tons were delivered. By the end of November, the relief
agency had flooded the famine zone with a total of 88,000 tons of
food.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the number of people at risk from starvation peaked in June
at about 800,000, and it was months before the death and
malnutrition rates declined to nonemergency levels. This year, the
World Food Program announced that more than $142 million would be
needed to feed an estimated 2.3 million people who remain
vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   An exhaustive internal review conducted after the Bahr el Ghazal
famine by Operation Lifeline Sudan and the Sudanese Relief and
Rehabilitation Association, the humanitarian-aid arm of the rebels,
found that significant amounts of the food had never reached those
for whom it was intended. Instead, much of it was diverted to rebel
military commanders, clan leaders and local tribal chiefs _ who
felt no need to share it with the refugees _ and to profiteers.
</P>
<P>
   Several rebel commanders were replaced as a result of the
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Only Blind Freddy would tell you that in a war situation you
don't have diversions,'' said Hamish Young, a senior World Food
Program official in Nairobi, Kenya. ``The end result is that the
amount of food that gets to the bottom of the heap is so diluted
that it doesn't really help.''
</P>
<P>
   The French aid organization Doctors Without Borders &UR; , &LR;  itself a
member of Operation Lifeline Sudan, this year issued a virtually
unprecedented, scathing public report on the relief efforts in Bahr
el Ghazal. It charged that the U.N.-led operation dropped more than
enough food to feed everyone on the ground but that the famine
still persisted.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of the food reaching those who needed it, the French aid
group declared, the aid was largely distributed among a privileged
few that included the rebel forces. Some aid workers reported
seeing sacks of grain stockpiled in huts by the local authorities
while the dispossessed were starving to death. In one instance,
they saw soldiers stealing rations from women and children.
</P>
<P>
   ``The quality of an emergency assistance operation should be
evaluated by its capacity to distribute aid to those who need it to
survive,'' the report concluded. ``The hundreds of tons of food
sent to Ajiep did not achieve this result. How long can
humanitarian agencies pour in tens of thousands of tons of food
without being able to control where it goes and without ensuring
that the aid actually saves those who really need it?''
</P>
<P>
   Normally, Ajiep is a small village. But its population swelled
to about 120,000 over several months last year after droves of
desperate refugees arrived. By October, Doctors Without Borders
said in its report, 2,500 tons of food had been delivered to Ajiep,
more than enough to feed all the people there. Yet, half the
children were still malnourished, the report said, and at least
3,000 people died. Few aid workers had ever witnessed such high
rates of malnutrition and mortality.
</P>
<P>
   Within the U.N. relief operation, people who criticize the
rebels for diverting food do so at their own peril. Hamish Young,
the World Food Program official, openly admits that the task force
report on the response to the Bahr el Ghazal famine was
``sterilized'' so as not to offend the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   ``You are going to incapacitate your ability to deliver food if
you slam'' the rebels, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Or worse, as the French aid organization Action Against Hunger
discovered. A member of the Operation Lifeline Sudan consortium,
the organization was expelled from rebel-held territory last year
after trying to find out why malnutrition rates at Labone, a
refugee camp in Eastern Equatoria province, were staying high
despite the fact that ample food was being distributed by Catholic
Relief Services.
</P>
<P>
   Philip Aguer, the liaison officer of the rebels' aid agency in
Lokichoggio, acknowledged that within the rebel forces there were
people ``looking at relief as a tool that could be used negatively,
as a weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   On occasion, he said, local commanders employed the ``food
magnet'' principle when they moved large numbers of displaced
people simply by stopping food drops in one area and starting them
in others. But, he said, this was not a policy of the rebel
leadership.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it is Khartoum that has used the food effectively as a
weapon,'' Aguer said. ``Today we have 19 locations that are denied
food by Khartoum. There is no single area that is denied'' by the
rebels.
</P>
<P>
   Far from seeing themselves as equal partners with the U.N.-led
aid operation, the rebels are frustrated by the fact that the
Sudanese government has veto power over where food can be dropped,
Aguer said. The rebels, he said, would like to renegotiate the
agreement to give them equal status.
</P>
<P>
   ``This agreement is useful to just one side, and that is
Khartoum,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   From the government's view, the rebels are nothing but ingrates
who fail to recognize that it is not required to offer any
assistance to a military force trying to bring it down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The government is shouldering the responsibility to feed the
people in whatever area _ government- or rebel-held,'' Farouk Ali
Mohammed Badra, the Sudanese ambassador to Kenya, said in an
interview. ``The problem is, the rebels have the tendency to use
the kindness of the government to their favor.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The government, he said, also was unhappy with the agreement
with the U.N.-led relief operation, largely because of the
perception in Khartoum that there are people who work for agencies
who are ``eager and interested in giving aid to rebel-held areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Badra also criticized the Western media in general and the
United States in particular for what he termed bias against his
government. He hinted that Washington was supporting the rebels,
citing as an example a meeting between Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and rebel leader John Garang in Kampala, Uganda, in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say we are the bad guys,'' he said. ``I ask you, `Who
is the bad guy?' It is Garang.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`THE FOOD IS ONLY A BLOODY PALLIATIVE' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the scant, dappled shade of a thorn tree at a rebel base in
the Nuba Mountain village of Gideil, Daniel Kodi, a senior member
of the rebel command, sat sipping tea, his attention focused on a
conflict thousands of miles away from the one to which he has
devoted his life.
</P>
<P>
   Why, he asked, had the Western powers relentlessly bombed Serbia
because of its genocidal policies against the ethnic Albanians in
Kosovo, while they had done nothing to punish the government of
Sudan for waging a genocidal war against the Nuba people?
</P>
<P>
   It is a rhetorical question, one for which there is no easy
answer. It is also a question often posed by those embroiled in the
misery of the Sudanese civil war, a conflict that has taken more
lives than any other in the past 50 years but which has drawn scant
international attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``The United Nations' answer is to send food,'' Kodi said.
``That is not a solution. If it was a solution, why aren't they
dropping food on Kosovo instead of bombs? The food has saved lives,
but it has not helped stop the war.''
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't intended to. The U.N. aid effort, Operation Lifeline
Sudan, was established to provide humanitarian assistance to the
victims of the war and to try to prevent the recurrence of famine.
That it failed was not entirely the United Nations' fault.
</P>
<P>
   ``Food aid has been blatantly manipulated by both sides,'' said
John Prendergast, an analyst for the United States Institute of
Peace and a former White House adviser on East Africa. ``But both
sides in this war are fighting for fundamental principles. If food
aid was ended tomorrow, it would have very little influence'' on
bringing the war to an end.
</P>
<P>
   If the United Nations did stop delivering food, however, it
would result in the deaths of thousands, and it would rob the
Western governments that donate the greatest amount of food of what
some in the humanitarian-aid industry refer to as their ``fig
leaf,'' the alibi that allows them to at least appear to be doing
something about a conflict without having to address its root
causes.
</P>
<P>
   For in Sudan's civil war, not much is at stake that is of
sufficient strategic importance to compel the outside world to
intervene. Significant quantities of oil have been discovered in
Sudan's south, but there is no shortage of oil on the world
markets, nor is there expected to be for many years. Some mineral
deposits have been found, but not enough to fight over.
</P>
<P>
   And, according to some observers, if the civil war is considered
in the context of the overall dynamics of the Middle East, there
may, in fact, be compelling reasons not to solve the crisis,
because one of the solutions, secession by the south, could
threaten neighboring Egypt's access to water from the White Nile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may actually be in Egypt's interests to see the war
continue,'' said Roger Winter, executive director of the U.S.
Committee for Refugees. ``Our interests in the Sudan are limited.
And because of that, I don't think the (Clinton) administration has
a solution-oriented policy toward Sudan. We've been encouraging the
administration to take the lead in pursuing the idea of
self-determination for the south.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not a new idea. What peace efforts have thus far been
initiated to end the war have led to an agreement in principle
among all the parties that the ultimate solution would be to
partition the country into north and south.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that this has not ended the fighting, Winter said, is a
``macabre Alice in Wonderland reality.'' People continue to die in
man-made famines, international aid continues to pour in, and all
the while everyone agrees on the steps necessary to stop the
carnage.
</P>
<P>
   Dan Eiffe, a former Roman Catholic priest who runs the Sudan
operation of Norwegian People's Aid, an agency that does not belong
to Operation Lifeline Sudan and which openly supports the rebel
cause in the war, said that in the absence of the will to work for
a political solution, Western donor countries should support aid
agencies outside the U.N. consortium, such as his, so they can work
in the region unrestricted. Failing that, he said, the Western
nations should support the rebels directly.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't need food,'' Eiffe said. ``The U.N. is dumping food
in southern Sudan. Dumping it.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can keep your beans, your grain, your oil. Give us guns.
The food is only a bloody palliative.''
</P>
<P>
   It is highly unlikely that Sudan's rebels or their supporters
will get guns from the West. But they may get indirect support if
efforts in Washington toward a more engaged U.S. policy in the
region succeed.
</P>
<P>
   Already, certain non-U.N. agencies are being given relief
supplies to distribute independently of Operation Lifeline Sudan,
said a source in the U.S. Agency for International Development, the
government body that provides the U.N. aid effort with grain.
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, Sen. Bill Frist, R-Tenn., points to an
inherent absurdity in current U.S. policy toward the war.
</P>
<P>
   Washington, he said, supplies ever-increasing amounts of food to
feed people being starved to death by the Sudanese government. But
aid workers are required to seek permission from the same
government to feed the people it is trying to starve.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, Frist believes, should embark on a policy of
unilaterally providing aid to the people affected by the Sudanese
civil war without regard to the constraints placed on Operation
Lifeline Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we can't do anymore,'' Frist said, ``is drop food out of
the back of an airplane and think that is solving the problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know that it has been used as an instrument of war,'' he
said, ``and the lack of recognition of that in Washington is what
angers me.''

PEOPLE OF NUBA MOUNTAINS UNDER GOVERNMENT SIEGE SINCE 1989

<TEXT>
<P>
   NUBA MOUNTAINS, Sudan _ When the absolute, immemorial silence
that cloaks these war-torn mountains is disturbed by the distant
drone of an aircraft, the people pause and watch the dogs.
</P>
<P>
   If the dogs stay supine in the shade, the people return to the
daily grind of survival. But if the dogs raise their heads and
whimper, if they become agitated and seek shelter, the people brace
for the bombs that could, at any moment, rain from the sky.
</P>
<P>
   For the dogs know. They can detect the distinctive timbre of the
engines of the dreaded Antonov-32, the bomber of the Sudanese air
force, the plane that drops the cluster bombs at random from high
altitude, rolled out of the back, not intended for anyone in
particular, addressed, the locals say, simply ``to whom it may
concern.''
</P>
<P>
   And they have learned, recently, to distinguish that ominous
noise from the sound made by the few planes that these days fly in
illegally and deliver a meager allotment of food.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1989, when the people of the Nuba Mountains, an amalgam of
about 50 Sudanese tribes who have long struggled for
self-determination, aligned themselves with the Sudanese People's
Liberation Army, the rebel movement that controls much of the
southern half of the country, they have been under virtual siege by
the government.
</P>
<P>
   For many years, the region was cut off from the outside world
while the Sudanese government systematically attacked the people in
the rebel-held areas of the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   By destroying crops, livestock and homes, hundreds of thousands
were forced to seek food and shelter in government-held garrisons,
which are generously supplied with food aid.
</P>
<P>
   But after the rebels carved crude airstrips out of the sides of
the mountains, the world began to see what had been wrought.
</P>
<P>
   It is not a pretty sight. Lush, fertile valleys that were once
the breadbasket of the region lie quiet and empty, baking under a
relentless sun, the silence broken only by withered stalks of
sorghum rattling in the breeze. Burned-out houses dot the
landscape, which is scarred by bomb craters. The people who remain
scratch out an existence with implements fashioned from shrapnel.
The daily chore of collecting water sometimes involves a four-hour
trek to the nearest well.
</P>
<P>
   Painted by the numbers, the picture is just as depressing. Ten
years ago there were about 1 million people in the rebel-held areas
of the mountains. Today only about 400,000 are thought to remain.
Between 100,000 and 200,000 are believed dead. An estimated 60,000
are said to be close to starving to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``The situation is very bad,'' says Daniel Kodi, a senior member
of the Sudanese People's Liberation Army. ``This is genocide, but
nobody (in the West) will call it that. In Rwanda they refused to
use the word, and now they are refusing to use it here.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the government's blockade of the rebel-held areas of
the Nuba Mountains kept commerce, trade and aid out. But in June,
the government bowed to international pressure and allowed a U.N.
assessment team to tour the area.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, the only clues to what was happening in the
mountains were provided by a pro-rebel organization, the Nuba
Relief, Rehabilitation and Development Society, which had patched
together a fly-by-night relief operation to supply the beleaguered
people with a trickle of assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Risking being shot from the sky by Sudanese government MiGs or
bombed on the ground by Antonovs, aircraft loaded with food and
basic tools of survival fly from a base in Lokichoggio, Kenya, to a
crude, rocky airstrip in the mountains.
</P>
<P>
   After the planes swoop in for a white-knuckle landing, swarms of
people appear from the bush, and in 15 or 20 minutes the planes are
unloaded and refueled. Then they spin around and disappear again in
a cloud of dust.
</P>
<P>
   Within a few hours, with bags of sorghum on their heads, the
people have melted back into the bush, leaving a handful of
soldiers in thong sandals and threadbare clothes to defend the
airstrip against attack with their antiquated Kalishnikovs.
</P>
<P>
   There are many reasons the Islamic fundamentalist government in
Khartoum is so resolute about its desire to rid the mountains of
the rebels. For one thing, the region is technically in the north
but is allied with the rebel movement of the south. And at least
half the people are Muslims. Any successes by the Nuba Mountains
people against the Islamic fundamentalist government could become a
clarion call for other marginalized people in the north.
</P>
<P>
   For another, the Nuba Mountains are strategically and
economically attractive _ those who control access to the area rule
vast oil reserves discovered just to the south; Arab merchant
farmers of the north see great potential in the fertile valleys.
</P>
<P>
   But for whatever reason, the government's resolve to chase the
rebellious tribal people out of the mountains appears absolute.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Nuba are more repressed than any other people in the
Sudan,'' says Kodi, who served in Khartoum as a member of
Parliament from the mountains before deciding there was no future
in trying to achieve his goals politically and joining the rebels.
``We are discriminated against racially, socially, economically,
religiously. In all ways. They (the government) want us gone and
they will do whatever they have to.''
</P>
<P>
   The government's favored method, Kodi said, is the destruction
of food supplies, coupled, on the one hand, with permission to
distribute food in government ``peace camps'' and on the other, the
denial of food aid into rebel-held territory.
</P>
<P>
   But, when possible, the government also bombs schools _ the best
of which amount to little more than shacks _ and the region's only
hospital, which is run by a German medical aid organization out of
a mud hut in a remote village.
</P>
<P>
   Apart from these particular targets, what is striking about the
bombing campaign is its randomness. Its pattern is evident by the
craters spotting the landscape _ holes, scattered shrapnel, mangled
trees. But there's really nothing to bomb here. Not a house,
building or person in sight.
</P>
<P>
   ``They don't care if they hit anything,'' says Mohamed Omar, a
rebel fighter. ``It's just for terror.''
</P>
<P>
   Omar straightens, drops the shrapnel he is holding into the dust
and continues down the path. After a while, he stops, head tilted
to the side, listening. The sound of an airplane penetrates the
stillness. Omar waits, motionless, concentrating, and then he moves
on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the food,'' he says.

TRAPPED BY DEMONS OF WAR, SUDANESE TURN TO AID FOR SURVIVAL

<TEXT>
<P>
   PANTHOU, Sudan _ The woman crawls on hands and knees, her
fingers prying kernels of grain from the soil, squirreling them
away in a filthy cloth she carries for the purpose.
</P>
<P>
   ``In God's name, I didn't get food,'' Amou Bak calls out in
raspy complaint, turning a beggar's hand to two relief officials.
``I swear it.''
</P>
<P>
   Some 16 tons of flour, peas and sorghum sit stacked in bags a
few feet away, ready to be passed out to the several thousand
refugees who have spent a scorched afternoon awaiting it.
</P>
<P>
   But none of the bounty will go to Amou. Not this food. Not
today.
</P>
<P>
   ``She received food yesterday,'' says James Mugo, a young Kenyan
who is the United Nations' representative here, throwing a
dismissive nod toward the prostrate woman. ``She's just making a
show of this, hoping she can get more.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   But last year, some 60,000 people died in the famine that seized
Panthou and scores of other hamlets in Bahr el Ghazal, a desolate
province just below the line separating Sudan's rebellious south
from the unyielding north.
</P>
<P>
   An investigation by rebel and international aid agencies found
that death fell heaviest on women and children, many of them
refugees running from Sudan's now-perennial warfare, who lacked the
political or family ties to wangle food from local tribal chiefs
and rebel commanders.
</P>
<P>
   Amou changes her story and tries again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Others took my food,'' she says, her voice shriveling to a
whining resignation. ``I swear it. I swear it.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mugo and Victor Madut, a former grade-school teacher now
with the rebels' aid branch, turn their attention to the rows of
other women who will be fed today. The women, who have moved to
Panthou or nearby villages from war-racked areas, flare out on
three sides of the stacked food like the spokes of a broken wheel.
</P>
<P>
   On Mugo's signal, Madut orders the distribution to begin. His
underlings pass the command to the hard-faced men who walk the
lines of women like shepherds, growling warnings and slicing the
air with long switches.
</P>
<P>
   Amou's pleas fade as the late afternoon's golden quiet
evaporates in a rising din of hungry expectation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now!'' the herders shout to the women. ``Move!''
</P>
<P>
   The women rise to their feet in unison and march forward. They
hold open their empty sacks for the free food: some grain and some
peas, a little flour. Enough for a family, enough for a while.
</P>
<P>
   Chattering as they sling bags filled with food over shoulders or
upon heads, the women turn toward their makeshift homes. But many
walk only a few hundred yards before gathering again in tight
knots. Then, they divide the food among themselves, culling a share
for relatives and others, according to custom.
</P>
<P>
   Mugo and other relief workers say such redistribution doesn't
matter, that most of the food ends up in hungry bellies anyway. But
U.N. investigators say that an untold amount goes to local chiefs
and to rebel military units.
</P>
<P>
   Diversion, aid workers call it with frowns and shrugs. A
business cost in the relief game.
</P>
<P>
   Quarrels among the switch-wielding men erupt as the handout
continues. Curses are spat and fists shaken, as the men argue about
which family, clan or village has the right to be here.
</P>
<P>
   Today's food is being passed out to refugees from elsewhere now
living around Panthou. But that doesn't stop the locals from trying
to get a share.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are always trying to sneak in,'' Mugo says after wading
into one knot of men to settle a fight that nearly had come to
blows. ``We have to screen them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food is not for everybody,'' Mugo says. ``There has to be
a selection of who is vulnerable. There has to be a lot of
cooperation. We target the displaced, but a lot of them never
receive help.''
</P>
<P>
   At the tail of one of the lines, 12-year-old Abuk Garang
prospects for dinner, burrowing into the dirt with her bare hands,
hoping to find what even the birds have missed.
</P>
<P>
   A crowd gathers around the girl. Several people offer
encouragement, others rebuke. But most just shake their heads and
stare, wizened smirks pulling at mouths.
</P>
<P>
   Abuk ignores her jury, holds firm to the task.
</P>
<P>
   Using thumb and forefinger, the child picks a few grains from
the hole and calmly lays them with others she has gathered in a
wooden bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's not from here,'' explains a woman who says she is Abuk's
aunt. ``Our home is far away. There is no one to care for her. No
one to provide.''
</P>
<P>
   As the woman speaks, Abuk paws at the earth, harvesting another
day one kernel at a time.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
`THEY ARE NOBODY. AND THEY ARE NOWHERE.' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Life always has walked the thinnest of lines in this
heads-you-lose corner of southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   When conditions comply, the soil yields enough grain for people
to get by. Sprawling swamps and shallow rivers provide forage and
water for livestock, fish for the table. Wild fruits and seeds _
even the leaves and bark of trees _ nourish people through the lean
months.
</P>
<P>
   But usually it rains too little or too much. Seeds fail to
sprout, or crops wither beneath the relentless sun. Cattle, which
many people consider the bedrock of civilization, are stolen with
abandon and almost always with bloodshed.
</P>
<P>
   And, for 16 years now, merciless war has reigned, tearing
asunder most everything worth anything.
</P>
<P>
   The people of southern Sudan whirl in a vagabond's orbit. Ever
more reliant on the kindness of strangers, they shuffle between
what they have been and what they have yet to become.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are forced to live a life they cannot understand,''
says Sam Okara, a relief worker from neighboring Kenya who has
supervised U.N. aid operations in southern Sudan for six years.
``They are not living a customary way, and they can't live a modern
way.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are nobody,'' Okara says. ``And they are nowhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The war is transforming the once proudly self-reliant Dinka, the
region's largest ethnic group, and other southerners ``into people
who are totally dependent,'' says Francis Deng, a Sudanese scholar
at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the humanitarian tragedy of this war,'' says Deng, the
son of a famous Dinka chieftain who grew up in a village not far
from Panthou.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dinka have always seen themselves as the chosen people,''
he says. ``To have these people plunged into a conflict that is so
devastating really has gone to the core of what it means to be
human in their own terms.''
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's current conflict started in 1983 when southerners _
black Africans who worship either their ancestral deities or the
Christian God _ rebelled against the economic, political and
cultural domination of the country's Islamic and Arabic north.
</P>
<P>
   As many as 2 million civilians from the south's Dinka, Nuer and
other ethnic groups have been killed. Livestock have been rustled
and crops laid waste. Entire regions have been gutted. Millions of
people have spent years fleeing tribal rivals, Islamic holy
warriors and pro-government mercenaries.
</P>
<P>
   Although government troops still hold many of the south's larger
towns, the Sudan People's Liberation Army and other rebel
organizations now control most of the countryside. In recent years,
squabbles among southerners _ fueled by tribal animosities, warlord
rivalries and northern intrigue _ have caused much of the
slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   Regional quarrels are nothing new in a land where loyalties long
have reached no further than an extended family, where identities
have been tied to the lands where a family's cattle graze.
</P>
<P>
   But automatic rifles and other modern weapons have transformed
even minor encounters into slaughter.
</P>
<P>
   And every so often _ when war and weather and human whim have
converged _ famine has flared.
</P>
<P>
   After one season of starvation killed 250,000 southern Sudanese
in the late 1980s, a horrified world created an aid pipeline called
Operation Lifeline Sudan to guarantee that it could never happen
again. Last year, another famine killed about 60,000 Sudanese
children, women and men.
</P>
<P>
   There seems little hope of ending the bloodletting _ or the
charity _ any time soon. Years of halfhearted mediation by other
countries and the Sudanese themselves have achieved only temporary
cease-fires.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(MORE) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the war is going on, we will have people depending
upon foreign assistance,'' says Philip Aguer, a ranking relief
official for the Sudan People's Liberation Army, the main rebel
faction.
</P>
<P>
   Though the international relief operation has saved an untold
number of lives, many worry that the aid is irrevocably altering
the societies it aims to rescue.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nobody thought of the negative impact of relief on the
population,'' says Aguer, a Dinka from a village along the White
Nile. ``It has affected us.''
</P>
<P>
   Many relief officials insist, however, that the aid operation's
purpose is nearly as much about preserving lifestyles as lives.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that effort focuses on helping the Dinka and other
ethnic groups avoid eating or selling their cattle. Considered by
many to be the truest measure of worth, cattle play a central role
in the southern Sudanese way of life.
</P>
<P>
   The exchange of cows and bulls by relatives of the bride and
groom seals marriages. Families name animals according to hide
patterns and other attributes, then christen their children after
the livestock. Boys achieve manhood tending to cattle herds far
from their villages.
</P>
<P>
   People nourish themselves with cow's milk and blood. But they
eat beef only on special occasions or when an animal dies of
natural or accidental causes.
</P>
<P>
   The theft of livestock has defined relations of families, clans
and villages for generations.
</P>
<P>
   But the dual onslaught of war and relief is straining the cattle
culture.
</P>
<P>
   So many animals have been stolen by raiders from both north and
south or sent to more peaceful areas far away that boys often have
no herds to tend. Many people postpone marrying because of a lack
of cattle. Marriages that do take place get sanctioned with animal
IOUs.
</P>
<P>
   And relief food has replaced the relentless scramble for
nourishment that once defined life's meaning here.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people in the south used to depend on cows'' for
their livelihoods, Aguer says. ``Now people are accustomed to going
to relief centers.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
THIS IS THE RAIDING SEASON &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A fleet of mud-and-thatch huts anchored in a golden sea of
grass, the Dinka community of Panthou teems with life.
</P>
<P>
   Laughing children flock to any diversion. Teen-agers, many
singing as they work, gather straw for roofs and the walls that
encircle family compounds. Women tend to chores. Men pass the
sultry afternoons beneath shade trees, arguing crops, livestock and
politics.
</P>
<P>
   Cows and goats wade in shallow ponds and graze alongside the
dirt airstrip at the center of the village. Other cattle fan out to
feed in the marshy pastures straddling the Lol River to the north.
</P>
<P>
   Drums beat throughout the day, advertising the dance that will
come with the night.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's war seems distant, its hunger even more so.
</P>
<P>
   They aren't.
</P>
<P>
   Many Panthou residents only recently returned home after a long
exile last year, when much of Bahr el Ghazal province writhed with
famine, war and retribution.
</P>
<P>
   After many rainless months, the village's ponds have all but
evaporated, and the hardened earth has cracked. The ribs of the
grazing animals strain at their flanks.
</P>
<P>
   People will plant again once the rains come and the
foreign-donated seeds and tools arrive. But reaping what they sow
will depend on whether new attacks come before the crops are ready.
</P>
<P>
   ``You might plant, but you might not get to harvest,'' says
Okara, the Kenyan who has worked as an aid worker in Panthou.
``There is a lot of demoralization.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the raiding season, when pro-government militias, tribal
warlords and free-lance cattle rustlers traditionally sweep across
southern Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Several recent peace agreements between Dinka and Nuer chiefs,
cease-fires called by rebels and the government, and the return of
one warlord's army to the insurgent side have eased the raids'
intensity.
</P>
<P>
   But Arab horsemen still escort the trains moving along the
tracks 12 miles west of Panthou. As the trains progress slowly
south with supplies for government troops in the garrison towns of
Aweil and Wau, the horsemen attack outlying villages to loot, kill
and sometimes carry women and children off into slavery. Recent
raids have killed scores of people across Bahr el Ghazal.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of refugees have fled to the dubious safety of Panthou
and surrounding villages from even more vulnerable areas to the
north. In recent months, however, relief workers have evacuated
Panthou twice because of insecurity. Past attacks have destroyed
much of the town.
</P>
<P>
   ``There isn't a family here that hasn't lost its house and many
of its animals,'' Piol Geng, Panthou's top chief, says in a blend
of halting English and rapid-fire Dinka. ``My village is always
suffering.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, families labor on new huts that rise alongside the shells
of houses wrecked in last year's fighting. Refugees throw up
makeshift dwellings close to the field where relief food gets
passed out.
</P>
<P>
   ``It could be that another attack will destroy these, too,''
Alfred Deng, the head of the rebels' aid agency in Panthou, says of
the new houses. ``But people have to get the roofs on before the
rains come.''
</P>
<P>
   Largely because of its central location and smooth dirt
airstrip, the community of 20,000 has become a hub of the
international relief effort. The compounds of a half-dozen relief
agencies hulk behind high grass walls like castles in some feudal
fiefdom.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers have had to adjust to new customs, brought by the
foreigners, that seem as alien as ice to this tropical plain.
</P>
<P>
   The relief agencies, for example, have tried to channel food
deliveries through women, bucking social customs that relegate most
power to men. South Sudanese men often have several wives and
children by each.
</P>
<P>
   According to the foreign logic, putting food into women's hands
seems a sure way to get food to the neediest. For that reason, the
relief workers have created aid committees dominated by women. The
Dinka have accepted them with a knowing wink.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some places, the relief committees work very well,'' says
Madut, the former Dinka schoolteacher who now works for the rebel
relief agency. But in others, he says, ``the chiefs have too much
power, and they decide everything.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The U.N. distributes to the women, but the men are definitely
in charge,'' Madut says. ``It's cultural.''
</P>
<P>
   The last word on who gets relief food in Panthou rests with
Piol, 32, who recently inherited the position of senior chief from
his father. Piol _ who, like many Dinka, usually goes by his given
name _ rules through a network of subchiefs and family heads, all
of them men.
</P>
<P>
   Meeting beneath a tree on the edge of the village, the young
chief and his men decide how much food each family will get and how
much the community at large will share.
</P>
<P>
   Villagers give some relief food to the chiefs as a tax. The
leaders then redistribute the aid, sometimes to people overlooked
by the relief workers' committees. Some of the food ends up in
rebel troops' stomachs, U.N. investigators admit, either when the
guerrillas eat meals with their families at home or with comrades
in military units.
</P>
<P>
   But, Piol says, providing for their own people remains the
chiefs' first priority. Refugees and other outsiders go to the back
of the line.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are always struggling ourselves,'' Piol says. ``There isn't
enough for the people that come from far away.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more food. We always need more.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
HUNGER ALWAYS HITS THE CHILDREN HARDEST &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Charity starts early and lasts the day in Panthou.
</P>
<P>
   By shortly after sunrise, several hundred women holding infants
and toddlers squat in disciplined rows outside an emergency feeding
center.
</P>
<P>
   Because the children they bring are severely undernourished,
these women have the right to twice the food allotted everyone else
in Panthou _ enough to fully feed their families.
</P>
<P>
   Other villagers must supplement the free food with their own
supplies, however they can.
</P>
<P>
   Hunger always hits the youngest hardest, aid workers say. Giving
double rations to the entire family of a badly malnourished child
lessens the chance that parents or siblings will steal food for
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   During the famine that swept Bahr el Ghazal province last year,
more than half of the children examined in Panthou were
malnourished. Many of them desperately so.
</P>
<P>
   Conditions have improved after months of relative peace and
relief food deliveries. But the next famine remains an attack or
crop failure away. Any new crisis, aid workers say, will show
itself first in the children.

OLD-SCHOOL CAPTAIN FACES A CHEMISTRY TEST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROOKLINE, Mass. _ Let the bonding begin, sayeth the captain.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every moment we can spend with one another is golden in my
mind,'' declares Ryder Cup captain Ben Crenshaw.
</P>
<P>
   The man cares so much about what he's doing that it's beyond
frightening. Should the US not retrieve the Ryder Cup four weeks
hence, please, somebody, hide all swords. I would be willing to bet
that Crenshaw has read up on the Samurai warriors and would know
exactly what to do in the event of a negative outcome.
</P>
<P>
   Captain Ben was over at The Country Club Monday with eight of
his Ryder Cup boys. Absent because of the proverbial prior
commitments were Tiger Woods, Mark O'Meara, and Tom Lehman. Absent
because of a very sore neck was Davis Love. Eight out of 12 is not
exactly what the captain had in mind, but it's a start.
</P>
<P>
   The purpose was twofold: 1. Get in a practice round. 2. Start
working on developing some (itals)wa.(unitals)
</P>
<P>
   The practice was important, but not that important. Everyone had
predictably nice things to say about the old girl, and you didn't
get the idea that the course intimidated anybody. Justin Leonard
pretty much summed up the feeling of the first-timers about the
personality of the course.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some blind tee shots and the greens are fairly
small,'' he observes. ``It's an old, classic course.''
</P>
<P>
   And it's one that has a definite appeal to captain's choice
Steve Pate, who made a run at the 1988 US Open title at The Country
Club. ``I love this place,'' he gushes.
</P>
<P>
   That said, might Mr. Pate have any advice for some of his
teammates?
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing they probably don't already know,'' he shrugs.
``Obviously, the greens are pretty small here. The center of the
green makes for a good target. I think they'll figure that out.''
</P>
<P>
   The captain could do about seven hours on each and every one of
the 18 holes (it's starting to sound as if he's envisioning a
little retirement condo on the grounds), but it's very clear that,
in the mind of Crenshaw, the 1999 Ryder Cup isn't going to be about
the course, as worthy as it is. It's going to be about assembling a
T-E-A-M in the next four weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today was a day of learning,'' he declared. ``It was a day to
be together. It is important for us to be together as a team,
because it's something they know and possess.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They,'' of course, are the Europeans, who, despite coming from
many different countries (seven this year), have precisely the
spirit Crenshaw seeks for his squad. With no flag to rally 'round,
and nothing to bind them except a strong desire to whip the fat cat
Yanks, the Europeans have won the last two Ryder Cups.
</P>
<P>
   We all know what Crenshaw wants. What we don't know is whether
these men are even constitutionally capable of giving it to him.
</P>
<P>
   No one brought up the compensation issue Monday, but you'd have
to be pretty naive to think the matter has been forgotten. Strong
things were said behind that closed door in Medinah last month, and
let no one think they're all on the same, how you say, page.
There's been a public truce; that's all.
</P>
<P>
   Payne Stewart, age 42, is Old School. David Duval, age 27, is
New Wave. Stewart remembers when the Ryder Cup was a simple matter
of the Red, White and Blue kicking butt and taking names before
modest crowds and a handful of media folk. Duval is on record as
calling the Ryder Cup both an ``exhibition'' and a ``large
corporate outing.'' Psst, Captain Ben: This may not be an ideal
four-ball pairing.
</P>
<P>
   Duval may be trying, but he still has a hard time getting into
this ``team'' stuff. ``As much as you want to talk team,'' he says,
``when Phil (Mickelson, another New Waver) is out there, he has to
make that putt. We can't help him do that.''
</P>
<P>
   True enough. But what you can do is give him a pat on the back
and a ``hang in there'' if he misses that 3-footer. That's what
being a good teammate is all about.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, each man will be swinging his own club, but there are
dynamics inherent in team competition that do not exist in regular
tour play. Crenshaw is convinced that European mastery of those
dynamics has made the difference in the last two Ryder Cups.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these guys are just phlegmatic by nature. This is a
sport, remember, in which a man can become very wealthy without
actually ever winning anything. At a big event you can cart home a
six-figure check for cracking the top 10. They all say they're
competitive, but pragmatism very often overrules dramatics. Why go
for it when laying up will guarantee a round-saving bogey?
</P>
<P>
   No offense, but Jim Furyk did not exactly come across Monday as
a man with a crackling personality. Even backed by a microphone, he
could barely be heard from 5 feet away. Perhaps he'll blossom over
the next few weeks, but you've got to wonder if he really has it in
him to get excited over anything.
</P>
<P>
   ``Developing some team chemistry is up to Ben,'' maintains
Stewart. ``I think he's got to work with the different
personalities and treat them gingerly at times while being firm at
other times.''
</P>
<P>
   At least Crenshaw will know where Stewart is coming from.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will bring enthusiasm to this team because I love team
sports,'' Stewart says. ``I played football and basketball in high
school, and I love the team element. I like to support other
people. I'm just very rah-rah, I guess. I don't know if you'd call
me a motivator, but I am enthusiastic, and that enthusiasm will
show.''
</P>
<P>
   Great. There's one. Does Stewart see any allies?
</P>
<P>
   ``Other rah-rahs?'' he inquires. (Long pause). ``No. You're
looking at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Is there enough time? Crenshaw says he wants his Ryder Cuppers
to hang out together wherever they go in the next few weeks. But
will a couple of dinners be enough to make palsy-walsy teammates
of, for example, Stewart, Pate, and Hal Sutton on one side of an
age and attitude divide and Duval, Mickelson, and mega-celebrity
Tiger on the other?
</P>
<P>
   Pity Captain Ben. He may be coaching the wrong team.

PANTHOU, Sudan: in the children. 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   As they while away the hot morning outside the feeding center,
the women gossip and argue. Many of their young children cry. Local
men employed by a foreign aid agency move among them, keeping
order.
</P>
<P>
   Shouting instructions through bullhorns and carrying long
switches, the men command those waiting to be still, then to move
forward row by row. Mothers and children pass through the feeding
center gates and enter a gantlet of aid workers.
</P>
<P>
   Each child gets measured and weighed, poked and prodded.
Children under 80 percent of the normal height and weight for their
age win a continued slot in the feeding program and double rations
for their families.
</P>
<P>
   Those who have inched above the minimum for two weeks running
get gently turned away. A nurse clips off the ankle tags that serve
as the children's admission tickets to the program.
</P>
<P>
   Conflicting emotions cross the faces of the mothers whose
children have been culled. Graduating from the program means a
child's chance of survival has improved. But it also means that a
family's food ration is halved, making eating each day much harder.
</P>
<P>
   The mothers of children who remain in the program collect their
food, then walk out the narrow back door. Relatives await to
accompany the lucky malnourished home.
</P>
<P>
   On the fringe of the crowd, Dinka boys swarm aid workers, trying
to impress them with the worthiness of their own despair.
</P>
<P>
   Look, the boys signal, pointing at bare feet, tugging at
tattered shirts.
</P>
<P>
   I have no shoes. I have no clothes. Give me water. Give me food.
</P>
<P>
   Look.
</P>
<P>
   ``People will line up for food, will fight for it, beg for it
and die for it,'' says Chol Changath Chol, a Dinka intellectual
educated in Egypt who now works with an international aid agency in
Panthou.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the food is never enough. If disaster comes again, what
will these people do? Why don't the Dinka do something?''
</P>
<P>
   The sun seethes in the center of the sky as a U.N.-chartered
cargo plane sweeps over Panthou. Hundreds of women and children
rush through the dry grass to the shade trees alongside the drop
zone, prattling in anticipation.
</P>
<P>
   Gripping hollowed gourds, old sacks, anything that can hold
food, the women and children stand with faces upturned, watching
the aircraft make a wide swing above the village.
</P>
<P>
   The food that this plane will drop has been triple-bagged. But
some &UR;  &LR; of the 110-pound sacks always burst in the plunge to earth.
The spilled contents provide easy pickings for the quick.
</P>
<P>
   As the plane cuts across the drop zone, its nose pulls up.
Hundreds of bags of food tumble from the tail hatch like manna,
raining onto the field with dull thumps.
</P>
<P>
   As the hum of the aircraft's engines fades into the southern
sky, village men begin collecting the sacks and stacking them in
one corner of the field.
</P>
<P>
   Someone gives a signal.
</P>
<P>
   The waiting scavengers sprint forward, diving into the soil with
hands outstretched, using handmade whisk brooms to gather the
spilled grain.
</P>
<P>
   ``How can they say we are creating dependency?'' Mugo asks, as
he watches the clamor. ``Last year here, people were walking
sticks. As long as people need food, we need to intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   Twilight grants its reprieve from the day's sun and scramble. In
the cooling air, Panthou begins to settle in for the night, cooking
fires flickering to life.
</P>
<P>
   Achol Mayon places a meager supper over the flame she has built
outside her family's hut.
</P>
<P>
   Tonight Achol is cooking the yellow peas she received in
yesterday's handout. She's boiling them plain.
</P>
<P>
   Achol and her three children never ate yellow peas before the
U.N. planes started bringing them. They don't particularly like
peas. But nowadays, people in Panthou eat whatever drops from the
heavens.
</P>
<P>
   ``Peas are fine,'' Achol says as she stirs her pot, a toddler
suckling at one breast. ``Corn is better, but peas are fine.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
`THAT'S HOW WE ARE. SO PROUD. SO INDIVIDUAL' &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Only a few hours past sunset and already the Sudan sky seems
dark as deep space. Stars splay across the black expanse, lining up
here and there to form constellations, jumbling into glitter that
stretches beyond sight, into time.
</P>
<P>
   A half-dozen aid workers sit on folding chairs around a small
wooden table in the center of the U.N. compound. The Dinka cook has
set the table with corn bread and a stew of yellow corn and red
beans. Somebody produces a can of beef, someone else a bottle of
scotch and several more of wine.
</P>
<P>
   Providence smiles.
</P>
<P>
   A teen-ager from the village points out a fast-moving star.
Likely a satellite, he's told. Dinner conversation turns to walks
on the moon and wireless communications, to the threat of space
invaders and the miracle of e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Burning marshlands to the north, where pastures are being
refreshed for livestock, throw off a muffled red light that throbs
like a heartbeat. The talk shifts to grazing cattle, to the coming
planting and to the horse-mounted raiders who could scrape
everything away again.
</P>
<P>
   James Mugo says he plans to do nothing but watch television
during his upcoming five-week leave back home in Kenya. He misses
the modern age, craves a world beyond this emptiness.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of young men pass just beyond the grass walls, heading
from family compounds toward the drums pounding in the distance.
There will be dancing tonight.
</P>
<P>
   While they walk, the young men sing improvised ballads impugning
their rivals, or old favorites bragging of their people, their
cows, their culture, themselves.
</P>
<P>
   So many cattle have been carried away, so many friends and
enemies have succumbed to the shooting and the starving. Pride,
even the foolish kind, seems all that remains.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's how we are. So proud. So individual,'' says Chol, the
Dinka aid worker, as he listens to the singing. ``During the famine
last year, we died the same way: too proud and too
individualistic.''
</P>
<P>
   A half-moon rises in the east, its wan light shunting the
darkness. At the dancing place, on the village's northern edge, a
few dozen youths begin the ritual steps, circling a pole set in the
ground.
</P>
<P>
   As the young men dance, hundreds of people amble in wide circles
around them, trading gossip, preening and prancing. All seem
dressed in their finest clothes, the Dinka's tribulations stored
away with the daylight.
</P>
<P>
   One square-backed man arrogantly pushes through the crowd, a
rack of short spears slung across his back, marking him as a
revered hunter and warrior. A boy, scarcely 12 years old, strolls
in a fine white robe that flows to his ankles, an assault rifle
slung over one shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   Adolescent girls stand in tight gaggles watching the dancers,
laughing shyly as other boys cruise by. Young women work the crowd
with more purpose, trying to keep their reserve while catching a
fellow's attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come to look for a wife,'' says William Deng, a 21-year-old
from the village who has just finished working on a U.N. anti-polio
campaign. ``Everyone comes looking for someone to marry.''
</P>
<P>
   With the war and the hunger, marriage comes harder these days.
</P>
<P>
   Yet courtship survives. The young people still dance, as the
Dinka always have. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Feet kick up clouds of earth, painting the night's pitch with
an even deeper ink. Grit clings to tongues, clots eyes, cakes hair
and clothes.
</P>
<P>
   The drums pulsate, and the dancers speed and slacken to the
pace. Each boy's hands clasp the shoulders of the dancer ahead,
feet shuffle and stomp. Together they coil around the totem in a
scooting frenzy.
</P>
<P>
   Clenched fists and waving arms. Spears and rifles. Flirting and
fawning, feigning and fretting.
</P>
<P>
   Life.
</P>
<P>
   Dinka life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chibac,'' the young women say, clinging nervously to one
another, offering the boys limp hands and winsome smiles. ``Hello
there.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Chibac,'' answer the boys, chests thrusting, chins thrown
high.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's your name?'' the young men ask in the thin light.
``What's your father's name? Your father's father's name?
</P>
<P>
   ``Which is your clan?''
</P>
<P>
   Oh, chibac then. And chibac to you.
</P>
<P>
   Something in the still air shifts. Heavy fumes suddenly mingle
with the dust, sending some into coughing fits. A brief rumor runs:
The enemy threatens. They have sent poison gas to kill us. We are
doomed.
</P>
<P>
   No. It's only smoke from the burning swamps. Food enough keeps
dropping from the sky. The cattle are fewer, but safe. Planting
will start soon.
</P>
<P>
   Trouble remains a shadow for now.
</P>
<P>
   The Dinka keep dancing, on toward another dawn.

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOKICHOGGIO, Kenya _ Charisse Tillman spends her working hours
seeking what she sees as balance in a place perpetually out of
kilter.
</P>
<P>
   Working in a small, air-conditioned office in this ragged Kenya
border town, the 32-year-old American plays a key role in helping
the United Nations decide how much grain and beans, cooking oil and
other supplies should be dropped on the war-plagued landscape of
south Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   In making the calculations, Tillman says that she and her
colleagues try to figure how much food people in a given area can
scrounge on their own. The World Food Program, the U.N. agency for
which Tillman works, will make up the shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``We try to understand how they meet their food needs, how they
compose'' their diet, Tillman says. ``The fact is, people have one
harvest a year, so they are permanently at risk.''
</P>
<P>
   For a decade now, people like Tillman have labored under an
umbrella of U.N. and private relief agencies that have delivered
tons of food and other supplies to the victims and perpetrators of
one of the world's deadliest and most intractable wars.
</P>
<P>
   Theirs is tricky work at best.
</P>
<P>
   The mandate of the relief coalition, called Operation Lifeline
Sudan, is to save the lives of women, children and other innocent
civilians caught up in the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   To do so, the organization must work with the permission of
Sudan's government and under the often severe limitations set by
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   If too much food is delivered, Sudanese villagers can get
comfortable with charity, trading survival skills developed over
centuries for lives on the dole. If too little is sent, famine can
rear.
</P>
<P>
   Tons of food dropped to people in one village may anger rivals
in another. Or an aid delivery may strengthen one warlord at the
expense of another. Either way, the food can spark violence. And it
often does.
</P>
<P>
   In preparation for their delicate task, Tillman's field workers
receive a mere one month's training.
</P>
<P>
   Once deployed in rural south Sudan, they often find themselves
dependent upon one of the region's rebel groups for the completion
of their projects. Rebel military commanders often warn them of
impending danger or protect them from attack.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the tension caused by the fighting, relief
workers must wrestle with heat, boredom and deprivation. Malaria
and other diseases abound. The land swarms with poisonous serpents
and insects, with crocodiles and lions, with every kind of creature
that ``can sting, bite or spit,'' as one aid worker puts it.
</P>
<P>
   Turnover among relief workers, not surprisingly, is high.
</P>
<P>
   ``The isolation, the difficult working conditions are almost
unparalleled anywhere else in the world,'' says Ted Chaibon, a
ranking official for Operation Lifeline Sudan in Kenya. ``It's
understandable that people take it for a year or two and say,
`Hell, I'll go somewhere else.'''
</P>
<P>
   Although they bring enormous, albeit fleeting, wealth into south
Sudan's villages, many of the aid workers have little or no
knowledge of the societies in which they operate. Few know more
than a handful of words from any of the region's languages.
</P>
<P>
   ``To work in this area, you need to know the history, politics
and culture,'' says Dan Eiffe, a former Roman Catholic priest from
Ireland who has performed relief work in south Sudan for the past
11 years.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many aid workers seem engrossed with news about warlords
and the region's shifting alliances. They proudly toss around the
tongue-twisting names of villages, track the movements of warlords,
debate whether the crops will fail, whether the rains will fall too
little or too much, too early or too late.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the World Food Program's people in Sudan are Kenyans who
have chosen U.N. relief work as a career. The rest include young
Europeans, Americans and Australians, many of whom have fallen into
the field by chance and leave it after a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Though they are paid well by African standards, many of the aid
workers say that a desire to help people drives them more than a
paycheck.
</P>
<P>
   ``To know you can go in and make their lives a little bit better
to me is the motivation,'' says Waimiro Munio, a middle-aged Kenyan
woman who has worked in Sudan for three years. ``There is no reason
to watch a child die in two weeks.''
</P>
<P>
   But even as they feed the victims of the conflict, which by some
estimates has killed more than 2 million people in the past 16
years, some relief workers wrestle with the purpose and
effectiveness of their efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The food is a lot of wealth being dropped from the sky,'' says
Hugh Greathead, a twentysomething Englishman who is returning home
after more than two years working in south Sudan for Save the
Children-United Kingdom. ``It has a lot of potential to go wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Relief influences the conflict,'' Greathead says, because it
is used by local political leaders as proof of their usefulness to
people. Aid, he argues, ``provides the services that a government
normally would supply.''
</P>
<P>
   Eiffe, the former priest who now directs the Sudanese relief
effort of Norwegian People's Aid, sees the issue even more starkly.
</P>
<P>
   By not actively taking sides or strongly pushing for peace,
Eiffe says, the U.N.-led aid operation is merely feeding the
victims of a conflict that could go on forever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anyone who is neutral should go home,'' Eiffe says. ``Help one
side or the other, and finish the thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Eiffe, married to a south Sudanese woman with whom he has two
sons, has kept his relief agency out of the U.N.-led coalition.
That has allowed it to actively support the Sudan People's
Liberation Army, the largest rebel group in the south.
</P>
<P>
   Funded mostly by Norway's labor unions, Eiffe's organization
operates a network of hospitals that treat the rebel wounded as
well as feeding centers that hand out U.S.-supplied food to
guerrilla supporters.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Eiffe has to maneuver within the ever-changing
atmosphere of the rebels' own factional feuding, his agency can aid
south Sudan's afflicted without the permission of the Khartoum
government. By shunning neutrality, he says, Norwegian People's Aid
enjoys an effectiveness that the U.N.-led consortium cannot muster.
</P>
<P>
   ``We see this thing clearly,'' says Eiffe, who is called
Commander Dan by some Kenyan journalists because of his fervent
support of the rebels. ``We are actively, completely involved.''
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.-led coalition, Tillman points out, must respect the
sovereignty of Sudan, a member of the United Nations. The charter
governing Operation Lifeline Sudan dictates neutrality in the
conflict.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want our food to exacerbate the tension on either
side, to disturb the balance,'' Tillman says. ``We have to be seen
as objective as possible.''
</P>
<P>
   The Khartoum government, which is controlled by a fundamentalist
Islamic political movement, routinely restricts Operation Lifeline
Sudan's relief operations by closing dozens of southern villages to
food distribution in any given week.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, food dropped to farmers and herders
frequently ends up in the bellies of Sudan People's Liberation Army
rebels, many of whom are part-time warriors who live with their
families in the villages targeted for aid.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Lifeline Sudan's own investigators have found cases of
relief food being ``taxed'' by local tribal chiefs or rebel
officials. And food often is redistributed according to community
customs soon after it is passed out under the supervision of aid
workers.
</P>
<P>
   Tillman acknowledges that local Sudanese officials often
pressure her workers, hoping to wheedle as much food as possible
from the aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Of course, you get some people who want to exaggerate their
needs,'' says Tillman, an African-American who studied business
administration in college and first became involved in the aid
industry by working for CARE.
</P>
<P>
   The U.N.-led coalition, she says, tries to make rebel and
village leaders ``understand that it's better that we get a clear
picture.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You can't send us messages that your people are starving if
they are not,'' Tillman says.
</P>
<P>
   Her teams of assessors work up complex profiles on the
shortfalls in the nutritional needs of villagers, figuring the
availability of cultivated grain and wild food as well as the
prospects for fishing and hunting.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle, which are seldom eaten by the south Sudanese, usually
are left out of the calculations. U.N. officials say the livestock
must be preserved to protect the region's way of life and to
prevent people from becoming totally destitute.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have a lot of cattle in a community, and people are
still in bad shape,'' Chaibon says.
</P>
<P>
   In struggling to save people whom they see as innocents, the aid
workers must wrangle with the incessant violence that sometimes
mocks even the best organized relief efforts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many wars within the war,'' Tillman says.
``Today, southern Sudanese are killing many more southern Sudanese
than the government is.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can put people back on their feet,'' she says. But ``if
there is major fighting, we might be back to square one.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the day, we see civilian women and children are
dying. It is frustrating. Damned frustrating.''
</P>

PATRIOTS' CARROLL EAGER TO FACE GOOD FRIEND SEIFERT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL MADDEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ The words kept coming, flowing and flowing
from the moment Pete Carroll opened Tuesday's press conference with
a quip, ``Other than the fact this is a grudge match between me and
George, what are your questions?''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll seldom seemed more at ease. His friend, his mentor, his
model for football operations was the subject _ George Seifert _
and Carroll went on and on.
</P>
<P>
   The irony in New England, of course, is that New England owner
Bob Kraft, when he was searching for a coach to replace Bill
Parcells, made his first phone call to Seifert, but Seifert turned
him down. And then recommended Carroll to Kraft in the next breath.
</P>
<P>
   Seifert's advice, Carroll recalled, was practical.
</P>
<P>
   All coaches go through hell, Carroll said Seifert told him,
adding, `` `You can take a job and battle to be 8-8 and bust your
tail off to do that but to have a shot at a team that has a chance
to win the championship, and you're fighting the same battles . .
.' That's what I was thinking, anyway, at the time but it was a
natural reinforcement coming from George.''
</P>
<P>
   As for replacing Parcells, and the trauma that could cause,
Carroll recalled Seifert saying to him, `` `Maintain the confidence
in what you've done and be yourself, do the things you know how to
do.' And he's continued to tell me that all along the way.''
</P>
<P>
   Their situations had been nearly identical. Seifert had replaced
the very successful and very popular Bill Walsh in San Francisco
just as Carroll would be replacing a very successful and very
popular coach in New England. Time and again, in those crazy days
after the 1997 Super Bowl, Carroll and Seifert would talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``We talked about it before I came here, about his situation and
how he had handled it,'' said Carroll. ``And he handled it so well,
it was so critical, because everybody was so much in love with Bill
Walsh and what he had done, for obvious reasons.''
</P>
<P>
   Seifert, of course, was able to repeat Walsh's success with the
49ers. Carroll, as some Patriot fans mutter after every loss, has
yet to repeat what Parcells did here. Carroll may still be an
unknown after two years in New England, and Carroll's words about
Seifert _ ``He's a very enigmatic guy, and there're lots of sides
to George that people don't see'' _ could just as well be used to
describe Carroll.
</P>
<P>
   Carroll and Seifert will meet again on the football field
Thursday night in Charlotte, N.C., when the Patriots visit
Carolina, now coached by Seifert. Carroll had been Seifert's
defensive coordinator in San Francisco and the two were _ and are _
close.
</P>
<P>
   When asked to identify the one trait that enabled Seifert to
repeat Walsh's success, Carroll replied, ``I think it was his
ability to accept the situation as it was when Bill Walsh stepped
down and keep it exactly the same. Really, he was able to see in
his vision that they had something magnificent there and he just
wanted to keep it going. And George did things to keep it exactly,
precisely the same. In a quirky sense, George wouldn't change
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll, of course, has gone much the opposite route in New
England, changing much of what Parcells did. Unlike Seifert, who
stepped into a system he was long familiar with, Carroll was
stepping into a different system.
</P>
<P>
   As for football, Carroll said Seifert ``is a very particular
guy, again to a quirky sense, and he's very precisionlike and very
precise about what he does. That is a good trait in football and he
picked that up from his own upbringing but also from Bill Walsh.
You see them being very particular in that offense of theirs.''
</P>
<P>
   The other football trait that has made Seifert successful,
according to Carroll (``and I know George doesn't like me to say
this''), is that he ``does everything the hard way. He makes hard
decisions and then makes them work. Remember those times when Steve
Young was questionable and George would make the decision to go
with the backup quarterback and make it work. He liked to do things
the hard way and then work through it.''
</P>
<P>
   So Carroll has tried to follow his mentor's advice and has
fashioned the Patriots' football operations after San Francisco's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always say I had such a great time working for Bud Grant
(with the Vikings in 1985) and learned about football and the way
Bud saw things,'' said Carroll, ``but so many important things in
my football life have to do with what went on in San Francisco and
the way George and Bill built things there.''
</P>
<P>
   Carroll was surprised that Seifert would take a job so far from
the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   ``George is so San Francisco and it's so hard for me to
imagine,'' said Carroll. ``George is such a seaman, fishing and
ocean and boats and everything . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Much as many a Bostonian pictures the Hudson River as the West
Coast, Carroll then gave a West Coaster's view of Eastern geography
as he talked about Seifert in North Carolina:
</P>
<P>
   ``And now to see him in the middle of the country . . .''

CONFLICT IN SUDAN `A CHECKMATE THAT ONLY PRODUCES DEAD CIVILIANS' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Sept. 5) 
 
By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AJIEP, Sudan _ Almost from the moment Sudan became an
independent country in 1956, its various ethnic groups, warlords
and political factions have seemed determined to tear it apart.
</P>
<P>
   Rebellions have sprouted, flourished and died in a haze of
blood. Dizzying shifts in alliances and ideologies, gruesome human
rights violations and civilian suffering have punctuated the
violence.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere has the turmoil been greater than here in the country's
south, a Texas-size expanse of prairies and woodlands, shallow
rivers and marshes inhabited by tribes that have more in common
with people deep in Africa's heartland than with the desert
dwellers of the north.
</P>
<P>
   Southerners fought a war against the central government in
Khartoum from 1956 to 1972, settled into an uneasy peace for 11
years, then took up arms again in 1983 when the government reneged
on its promises of autonomy.
</P>
<P>
   The war has claimed the lives of more than 2 million people,
almost all of them southern Sudan civilians, since it reignited 16
years ago, according to Millard Burr, a former U.S. State
Department official who tallies the casualties for the U.S.
Committee for Refugees, a Washington, D.C., advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Another 6 million civilians have been displaced by the fighting,
Burr calculates, with some 350,000 living in refugee camps in
neighboring Kenya and Uganda and the rest dispersed across Sudan.
About 1 million southerners have fled to the north, mainly to areas
around Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the south suffers bloody squabbles between ethnic-based
armies backed by either the Khartoum government or various rebel
groups. Militia horsemen sanctioned by the government launch raids
to steal cattle and burn villages. Sudan air force planes routinely
bomb communities held by rebel forces.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict is ``an intractable game of checkmate that only
produces dead Sudanese civilians,'' Roger Winter, director of the
U.S. Committee for Refugees, told a congressional committee in the
spring of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the southern rebellion has mutated from a
Marxist effort supported by Cuba, Ethiopia and other leftist
governments to a nationalist movement that receives limited support
from the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, the U.S. government increased shipments of food and
other supplies to openly pro-rebel aid agencies as a way to
circumvent Khartoum's influence on relief efforts. These aid
agencies operate independently of a U.N.-led relief coalition that
delivers food and other help only to areas approved by the
government.
</P>
<P>
   Washington's view of Sudan has varied during recent decades. At
the height of the Cold War, the U.S. government considered the
staunchly anti-communist dictatorship in Khartoum a key African
ally. But since a 1989 military coup put a fundamentalist Islamic
movement in power, Sudan has been regarded as a supporter of
terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say Sudan's rulers aided Osama bin Laden, the
Saudi financier accused of planning the deadly bombings of the
American embassies in Kenya and Tanzania last year.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the embassy attacks, the United States bombed a
pharmaceutical plant in Khartoum that Washington suspected of
producing ingredients of a deadly nerve gas. Sudanese officials
denied the accusation.
</P>
<P>
   Often painted simply as a conflict between Sudan's Arab north
and its black African south, or between northern Islam and southern
Christian and animist faiths, the war actually is far more
entangled.
</P>
<P>
   ``The war is racial. It is cultural. It is religious,'' says Dan
Eiffe, a former Roman Catholic priest. As director of the Sudanese
operations of Norwegian People's Aid, Eiffe openly backs the Sudan
People's Liberation Army, the main rebel group in the south
controlled by U.S.-trained economist John Garang.
</P>
<P>
   Economic factors also are driving the war.
</P>
<P>
   The south's relatively small population and large reserves of
oil and other natural wealth have long made it prized by the rulers
in the north.
</P>
<P>
   The White Nile River, the source of water vital to both Sudan
and Egypt, flows through the south. A large canal project, put on
hold by the fighting, aims to divert Nile water around swamplands
in the heart of rebel territory in order to increase the river's
flow to the north.
</P>
<P>
   In June, a new pipeline began pumping oil to the north from
fields in the south, providing the Khartoum government with badly
needed income. The rebels have vowed to shut down the pipeline, and
fighting recently has flared near the oil fields.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the violence seems rooted in cultural differences. Though
unified in the colonial era, people in the north and south have
never had much in common.
</P>
<P>
   The north, once known as Nubia, was deeply influenced by Egypt
in the time of the pharaohs and later by Islamic and Arabic
traders. Today, most northerners speak Arabic and practice Islam.
</P>
<P>
   Divided among several ethnic groups, southerners speak a variety
of languages and have cultural links to the tribal societies of
central Africa.
</P>
<P>
   Most southerners practice traditional religions that acknowledge
the existence of a supreme God but worship lesser spirits as well.
About 10 percent of the south's population, including many of the
educated elite, are Christians.
</P>
<P>
   For centuries, many northerners viewed the south largely as a
source of slaves. Northern raiders often swept south to capture
women and children.
</P>
<P>
   Some experts say that a brisk slave trade continues today with
raids on southern villages made for the purpose of capturing women
and children to sell in the north. The extent of the slave trade,
however, is hotly debated.
</P>
<P>
   Egypt conquered northern Sudan in 1821 and later took control of
the south as well. Eventually, all of Sudan fell under the joint
rule of Great Britain and Egypt, which together granted the country
independence in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   Southerners who launched the 1956 rebellion against the Khartoum
government objected to the use of Arabic as the country's official
language and the predominance of Islam, among other things. A 1972
agreement that granted the south extensive autonomy ended the first
round of fighting.
</P>
<P>
   But the violence erupted anew in 1983, when Khartoum reneged on
many of its promises of self-rule and imposed Islamic law on the
entire country. Southerners, led by Garang and other
English-speaking leaders of the Dinka ethnic group, launched a
rebellion.
</P>
<P>
   Fighters from the Nuer and other southern ethnic groups joined
the rebels in the late 1980s. Early this decade, however, many
tribal warlords broke with Garang and other leaders of the Sudan
People's Liberation Army, and some became allies of Khartoum. Since
then, former rebel allies have waged much of the fighting.
</P>
<P>
   Cattle rustling, long considered a normal and honorable pursuit
among many of the south's men, has contributed to the violence.
</P>
<P>
   Various ethnic groups, even villages of the same tribe, have
fought over cattle-grazing lands for centuries. But now that most
fighters in the south have replaced spears with automatic weapons,
the death toll from the raids has skyrocketed.
</P>
<P>
   The Khartoum government has supported various factions against
one another in a largely successful effort to keep the south
fractured, experts say. Many officials in government-held areas of
the south are drawn from anti-rebel members of the region's various
ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Garang's rebel movement has joined northern
opposition groups to form the National Democratic Alliance. The
alliance includes political leaders deposed in the 1989 coup as
well as northern rebels who bitterly oppose Khartoum's
fundamentalist regime.
</P>
<P>
   Because the fighting has hampered the people's ability to farm
or raise livestock, famine has struck southern Sudan repeatedly.
After one such crisis in the late 1980s, the United Nations and
three dozen private relief agencies set up Operation Lifeline Sudan
to funnel food and other aid to the south. The relief effort was
intended as a short-term humanitarian fix. It has been in operation
for a decade.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan will need about 150,000 metric tons of relief food this
year, according to the World Food Program, the U.N. agency through
which much of the aid from the United States and other donor
countries filters. The organization warned in July that more than
100,000 southern Sudanese still face the prospect of starvation.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan's is one of many wars plaguing Africa. On Sudan's borders
alone, fighting between Ethiopia and Eritrea has killed tens of
thousands. Somalia wrestles with persistent clan feuding. Uganda
fights loyalists of a former dictator and guerrillas from a
fanatical Christian movement. And the Democratic Republic of Congo,
formerly Zaire, struggles with a multisided civil war.
</P>
<P>
   The United States and other industrial nations have failed to
force solutions to the conflicts in Africa. This stands in stark
contrast to the situation in Kosovo, where the U.S.-led NATO
alliance effectively forced Yugoslavia to surrender the province.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say that the United States and other Western
governments find it easier to aid the victims of the African
conflicts than to force a peace.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pathetic international situation,'' says John
Prendergast, a former Africa policy analyst with the Clinton
administration who now works at the U.S. Institute for Peace, a
government-funded think tank. ``If there were a sustained,
coordinated international pressure, you would see a quick
solution'' to Sudan's war.
</P>
<P>
   The conflict, Prendergast adds, simply ``is not a compelling
national security issue for the powers that have the capacity to
intervene.''
</P>
<P>
   Representatives of Sudan's government and Garang's rebels met in
Kenya in July to start another round of peace talks. Past
negotiations have proved futile, however. And despite cease-fire
declarations for areas across southern Sudan, the violence
continues.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as the international community doesn't require a
political solution, the negative side effects of the problem will
get worse and worse,'' says Hamish Young, a former corporate lawyer
from London who is now a top official at Operation Lifeline Sudan's
headquarters in Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   If the international community wants to end the suffering in
Sudan, Young says, it must end the war.
</P>
<P>
   ``The nation-states of the world have to stop it,'' he says,
``and they have the means to do it.''

Y2K READY? SOME BUSINESSES MIGHT NEED TO CHECK THE FINE PRINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ROSS KERBER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Companies, trade groups, and regulators have barraged the public
this summer with assurances that only minor problems will result
from the computer-software glitch known as Y2K.
</P>
<P>
   From utility executives to Federal Reserve Bank officials, the
message has been one of consistent optimism that major institutions
will function smoothly through the date change.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a catch that businesses and individuals might want
to keep in mind: Some research underlying the rosy forecasts
includes ample wiggle room.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the American Hospital Association boasts that
``almost all'' of its members will be ready for the date change to
Jan. 1, 2000, even though it has received data from just a small
fraction of its membership. Electric-industry executives
congratulated themselves for meeting a June 30 deadline to ready
their systems, but 63 companies were granted ``limited
exceptions,'' meaning they had missed the target date.
</P>
<P>
   Also, agencies have reduced the number of systems they consider
``mission-critical'' from 8,589 in late 1997 to 6,190 today, which
critics say has made it easier for agencies to declare their
systems ready.
</P>
<P>
   These factors worry some independent computer experts who are
helping government and industry groups plan ways to minimize risks.
These people note that software-upgrade programs often wind up
behind schedule and over budget, and they think that stricter
audits might present a more realistic picture of preparations in
some sectors.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some question as to whether those published status
reports are too optimistic,'' said Capers Jones, a computer
scientist at Artemis Management Systems in Burlington who has
testified to Congress about readiness efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Like most other specialists, Jones doubts that disruptions will
be severe. But thousands of minor computer crashes, taken together,
might create problems early next year, particularly for smaller
companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of happy talk out there now'' on Y2K issues,
said Howard Rubin, a Hunter College computer scientist and a
consultant to the United Nations and the Meta Group Inc. ``I think
in reality you can expect a fair number of things to go wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   John Koskinen, the Clinton administration's Y2K point man,
agrees that trade-group data has weaknesses. But he says that is
more than offset by readiness statements of individual companies _
including almost every large employer in New England.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, for instance, most of New England's major utilities
and banks declared they had met federal Y2K readiness deadlines _
among them Fleet Financial Group Inc., BankBoston Corp., New
England Electric System, and Boston Edison. Koskinen also noted
that other supposed ``doomsday'' dates have passed almost without
incident, such as the start of fiscal year 2000 on July 1 in many
states and cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is that companies must visibly and publicly
explain to their customers where they are at,'' he said. ``Where
there's more specific information, you get a sense of
accountability . . . and I think that's what is developing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Y2K problem arises because many computer programs use just
the last two digits of each year to keep track of the date. Left
unchanged, some programs might misinterpret the last two digits of
2000 and cause major systems to crash or shut down.
</P>
<P>
   Because these computers control everything from traffic lights
to teller machines to water systems, companies and governments
worldwide are spending billions of dollars to upgrade computer
systems before the date change occurs.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, to provide extra assurance, some regulators have begun
to conduct deeper reviews of various companies, aiming to turn up
cases of what engineers sometimes call ``pencil-whipping''
paperwork to make sure it reflects desired results.
</P>
<P>
   Among these are the US Department of Energy, where the chief
information officer, John Gilligan, says he wants to press
utilities for more details of the exceptions some had claimed to
meet the June 30 deadline. He wonders whether all the exceptions
were as minor as some industry executives had stated in a report
issued on Aug. 3.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll admit that with the statistics that they put in the
report, you have to read them carefully because they're attempting
to show positive progress'' that may not be justified, Gilligan
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now the agency will do a few audits as well, which Gilligan said
will function as ``some kind of sanity check'' on the industry's
forecasts.
</P>
<P>
   Eugene Gorzelnik, a spokesman for the utility trade group,
conceded that the decision to grant exceptions has sparked
criticism. But he said the exceptions had been granted to recognize
economic constraints, such as the need to keep power plants on line
throughout the hot summer.
</P>
<P>
   Other companies did not schedule outages at their nuclear-power
plants in time to perform Y2K checkups in the first half of the
year. ``It was a question of priorities,'' he said. All reviews
will be done by the end of the year, and the trade group says it
welcomes the oversight.
</P>
<P>
   At the Pentagon, tougher inspections have led to revisions of
rosy scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   One set of inaccuracies turned up at the Army's Tooele Chemical
Agent Disposal Facility in Utah, which in June 1998 reported Y2K
compliance for several systems used to dismantle artillery shells
containing deadly nerve and mustard gases.
</P>
<P>
   But in October, inspectors found that neither system had been
reviewed under formal procedures. While managers had undertaken
reviews using private-sector standards, the status of both systems
should have been listed as ``unknown,'' according to the
government's checklist.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, a manager at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground in
Maryland ``did not provide oversight and emphasis'' of Tooele's
work, inspectors found. Nobody was disciplined, and the Army says
it has since completed reviews to make Tooele Y2K compliant.
</P>
<P>
   Such reporting reflected what Robert J. Lieberman, the
Pentagon's assistant inspector general for auditing, said was a
lack of seriousness toward Y2K preparations through most of last
year. Not until a special meeting in December 1998 did many
officers begin to take Y2K seriously, Lieberman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At first it was viewed as a numbers drill that nobody cared
about,'' Lieberman said. ``You could turn in almost anything, just
as long as you answered the mail.''
</P>
<P>
   Lieberman said he is satisfied that the problems his group
turned up are being fixed. The Pentagon said in July that it had
repaired 1,964 of 2,107 systems it considers critical to fighting
wars, up from 577 a year ago. Including classified systems, the
agency said last week, it had upgraded 2,149 mission-critical
systems out of 2,414.
</P>
<P>
   Remediation efforts at hospitals and other parts of the
health-care industry also have attracted auditors' attention. In
addition to automated record-keeping systems, technicians worry
that chips embedded in devices such as X-ray machines and heart
defibrillators might malfunction as a result of the date change.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, the American Hospital Association says it doubts
such problems will arise. The group bases its optimism in large
part on a survey it sent to 2,000 of its roughly 5,000 members in
February. According to the trade group, 90 percent of respondents
``expected their devices to be compliant by year end or expected no
problems in their operations.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics say the survey forms were returned by only 583
hospitals, a fraction of the membership. Gary Christoph,
information officer for the US Health Care Financing
Administration, said the low response rate was ``cause for
significant concern.'', which we always have when folks are
unwilling'' to answer questions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does that mean they don't know, or are scared to tell us?'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of its own that the Department of Health and Human
Services conducted in March, findings were less cheerful:
``Providers seemed less confident in the Y2K readiness of their
biomedical equipment,'' the agency reported.
</P>
<P>
   The American Hospital Association has agreed that much work
remains to be done, but has said that its survey results are still
valid because questionnaires had been mailed to hospitals selected
at random. ``Maybe we can't quantify it as well as the utilities
and banks,'' said Robyn Cooke, one of the trade group's officers.
She added that hospitals had been given only a week to return the
forms and that this might have reduced the response rate.
</P>
<P>
   Some outside observers say they find the hospital group's
position worrisome. But some of the same Y2K specialists, such as
University of North Texas professor Leon Kappelman, say that the
lack of details tends to draw suspicious auditors.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've never had a software problem before that has gotten
such high visibility'' as the Y2K bug, Kappelman said. A positive
upshot, he said, is ``enormous management pressure to get the work
done.''

U.S. ALLOCATES JUST 1 PERCENT OF OVERSEAS FOOD AID BUDGET TO SUDAN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (For release Sunday, Sept. 5) 
 
By DUDLEY ALTHAUS 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The U.S. government supplies most of the food delivered to
Sudan's needy by the United Nations and private aid agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Surplus U.S. wheat, corn, beans, peas and oil are donated under
a variety of programs, most of which help support prices for
American farmers while bolstering Washington's foreign-policy
objectives.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has committed nearly 143,000 tons of food aid
to Sudan this year.
</P>
<P>
   According to the World Food Program, U.S. donations account for
as much as 88 percent of the relief that will be delivered to Sudan
in 1999 through Operation Lifeline Sudan, an umbrella group of U.N.
and private agencies.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. food aid also has been sent to private organizations
outside the U.N.-led group.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the importance of the U.S.-supplied aid to Sudan, the
relief represents just a little more than 1 percent of the 12
million tons of relief food that Washington will send overseas this
year. Russia is scheduled to receive 3.2 million tons of U.S. food
aid, and Kosovo will get 250,000 tons in the last six months of the
year alone.
</P>
<P>
   The international community has earmarked $142 million for Sudan
relief this year. In July, 100 countries and international
institutions, such as the World Bank, pledged $2.1 billion for the
reconstruction and development of Kosovo, which has less than 10
percent of the population of Sudan.
</P>
<P>
   Sudan is one of 80 countries receiving some sort of aid from the
United Nations' World Food Program.
</P>
<P>
   However, because of chronic insecurity and the lack of a
developed system of roads, the relief effort in Sudan relies on air
deliveries, making it one of the most expensive such operations in
the world. Spending on Sudan relief accounted for 13.5 percent of
all World Food Program expenditures in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say the United States is committed to the Sudan
relief effort for the long term.
</P>
<P>
   ``As long as we believe that people are seriously at risk and we
can monitor (the aid), we will be there,'' says Larry Meserve, an
official with the U.S. Agency for International Development in
Kenya who oversees U.S. donations to Operation Lifeline Sudan.
``It's not acceptable for innocent civilians to starve to death.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can't pull out.''

THREAT OF ATTACK KEEPS VIGILANCE CONSTANT AND RELIEF SLOW 

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   AJIEP, Sudan _ Two dozen relief workers slouch around a wooden
table inside the low-slung dining hall of the United Nations'
outpost in Ajiep, a village where famine preyed last year.
</P>
<P>
   The workers, most of them foreign, have come together to talk
about ways to better coordinate their efforts, so another crisis
can be averted.
</P>
<P>
   But the meeting has started sluggishly, with vague questions,
evasive answers and thousand-yard stares.
</P>
<P>
   Midafternoon heat hangs like a demon's breath in the open-sided
thatched hut as Mawiir Nyok, a midlevel operative with Sudan's main
rebel movement, tacks some hand-drawn organizational charts to an
easel.
</P>
<P>
   Pacing commandingly, Mawiir ticks off what he sees as the aid
priorities for the hardpan country around Ajiep. With some old
scores to settle and some new arms to twist, he has decided to come
on tough.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am not dictating any program,'' says Mawiir, a 33-year-old
former U.N. driver with the broad shoulders and expanding waist of
an aging athlete. ``But we need for something to evolve from
somewhere to somewhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Then one woman, new to the area, interrupts. What happens, she
asks, if there is an attack by government troops or one of the
area's many marauding militias?
</P>
<P>
   Good question.
</P>
<P>
   For years now, the big-money strategies devised by the world's
humanitarian industry for southern Sudan have been hampered by
inconsistent rebel policies, obstacles set by the government in
Khartoum and poor planning by the aid agencies themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing has been more disruptive, however, than the warfare
scraping back and forth across the south.
</P>
<P>
   Every attack delays or derails elaborate aid efforts. Food
stockpiles get stolen, and seeds meant for planting are eaten
instead. Tools get carted away or destroyed. Newly dug wells are
poisoned.
</P>
<P>
   And villagers scatter, refugees once more.
</P>
<P>
   No foreigners have been killed in southern Sudan since 1992,
when two aid workers and a journalist were ambushed. But there have
been plenty of close calls.
</P>
<P>
   Mawiir thinks for a minute, his scowl yielding to a sardonic
smile.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's very simple,'' he says. ``If danger comes from the west,
go east.''
</P>
<P>
   Nobody laughs.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these aid workers have fled places like Ajiep before,
leaving with only a few minutes' notice, running and walking for
hours or days through the dry brush country, eyes ever scanning for
attackers.
</P>
<P>
   Ajiep itself has been evacuated twice because of insecurity in
recent months. And dozens of people have been killed in raids on
nearby villages.
</P>
<P>
   ``This fighting is not a permanent thing,'' Mawiir says of the
violence. ``It is a game we play every year. It's running back and
forth.''
</P>
<P>
   As the top aid coordinator for the Sudan People's Liberation
Army in the area that includes Ajiep, Mawiir holds the power to
veto any relief program and to expel any foreigner who displeases
him. But he assures the aid workers in the meeting that the rebels
understand the difficulties they face.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you start with something and it's disrupted,'' Mawiir says,
referring to the possibility of evacuation in the face of attack,
``there will not be any blame.''
</P>
<P>
   That's good news. Because Ajiep has been consumed with
recrimination for a year now.
</P>
<P>
   An indifferent collection of stick and mud hovels built on sand,
the village anchors a stretch of scorched land in Bahr el Ghazal
province that famine stalked last year. With the number of people
needing help skyrocketing to nearly 1 million, the relief agencies
stumbled, critics say, failing to get food to those who needed it
most. No one knows for sure, but some 60,000 people are thought to
have perished.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to repeat what happened last year,'' says Daniel
Ladoucer, 32, the newly appointed U.N. supervisor who called the
meeting. ``We would like to foresee a little better when the
emergency will occur.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like nobody knows who is doing what where,'' he tells the
relief workers.
</P>
<P>
   With the sun falling in the western sky, however, the meeting
breaks up with little accomplished. Everyone agrees to continue the
next morning.
</P>
<P>
   But a deep, predawn rumbling off to the west changes those
plans. The noise sounds like thunder, but there are no rain clouds.
Someone is shelling someone else, says a Sudanese worker in the
Irish relief agency's camp. And it's not that far away.
</P>
<P>
   Tension builds with the rising sun. Are government forces
attacking? Will they come to Ajiep?
</P>
<P>
   If the fighting marks the progress of a government convoy along
the road on the other side of the Jur River, and if the
government's horse-mounted militia is escorting the supply trucks,
attackers could be here within an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Most everyone in southern Sudan is terrified of the militia
cavalrymen, mostly members of Arabic clans from northern Sudan.
Armed with swords and automatic rifles and often riding several
hundred strong, the horsemen attack with little warning along the
dirt roads that cut through the thorny brush.
</P>
<P>
   There are few vehicles in the south, and people often must flee
the horsemen on foot. Hundreds of villagers die trying every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the horsemen attack, I would rather just shoot myself,''
says one aid worker. ``I have nightmares about those guys.''
</P>
<P>
   Ladoucer works the radio in the U.N. compound, trying to get
information about the apparent shelling from Operation Lifeline
Sudan's base in Lokichoggio, more than 600 miles away in Kenya.
Radio conversations drift out of other aid compounds, as agency
workers check in with their own support bases.
</P>
<P>
   Lokichoggio responds that there is, indeed, fighting near Ajiep.
Rebels have attacked a convoy on the other side of the Jur River
that is carrying supplies for the government garrison in the town
of Gogrial.
</P>
<P>
   Operation Lifeline Sudan's security experts have placed Ajiep on
Level 3 alert. Everyone should get ready to run, just in case.
</P>
<P>
   The relief workers break camp in their adjoining compounds,
little more than tents and mud huts clinging to the sand. Backpacks
and tents, water and a little food are loaded into four-wheel-drive
trucks. All the equipment _ radios, medicine, tools _ and most
Sudanese employees will be left behind if the aid workers pull out.
</P>
<P>
   A visibly nervous Ladoucer walks over to talk to workers at the
Irish aid agency Concern. He argues for evacuating to a village 90
minutes by vehicle to the east.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the horsemen don't come, it is fine,'' Ladoucer tells
Concern supervisor Niall Roche, murmuring so that the Sudanese
cooks can't hear. ``If they do come, then the whole area is at
risk.''
</P>
<P>
   Roche says he worries that Ajiep's civilian population will
panic if the aid workers leave. Still, Roche agrees to do whatever
the other aid workers decide.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone waits.
</P>
<P>
   By midmorning, however, no shelling has been heard for hours.
The relief workers decide to continue their meeting.
</P>
<P>
   But things have barely gotten started when the explosions start
again, seemingly much closer this time, sounding like some giant
fist knocking on a heavy metal door.
</P>
<P>
   Dark pillars of smoke curl on the western horizon. Going east
seems like a better idea than ever.
</P>
<P>
   Roche and other Concern staffers drive out to Ajiep's dirt
landing strip, where an air crew frantically works to repair the
engine of a charter plane that brought the Irish aid workers from
Kenya the day before.
</P>
<P>
   Struggling with the engine, the mechanics and two pilots throw
nervous glances westward with each new explosion.
</P>
<P>
   High above, a government Antonov transport plane lazily
crisscrosses Ajiep, heading south toward the military garrison town
of Wau and north again toward Khartoum.
</P>
<P>
   The government uses the Russian-built planes to bomb rebel
positions. The Antonov crews simply roll explosives out the back in
the general direction of a target. Anyone can be hit.
</P>
<P>
   The charter pilots break out binoculars to track the Antonov.
But the plane flies too high to bomb and holds a course away from
the airstrip.
</P>
<P>
   Several hundred local men and boys gather beneath a shade tree
near the crippled aircraft to watch the repair efforts. Few of the
Sudanese seem to take notice of the nearby explosions,
concentrating instead on trying to beg water, pens or anything else
from the handful of foreigners.
</P>
<P>
   Clusters of rebel soldiers, two and three at a time, saunter
across the airstrip, weapons slung lazily over shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people know,'' says Mawiir, the rebel official, as he
arrives to check on the mechanics' progress with the damaged
engine. ``If no one is running, there is no danger.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe so. But southern Sudan's civilians are massacred by
raiders with sickening regularity. People don't always manage to
get away in time.
</P>
<P>
   Escape by air is not an option. The plane's engine has serious
problems, and new parts will have to be flown in from Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   The air crew and aid workers scrutinize the high grass that
stretches to the tree line marking the river a few miles away and
the road beyond. All minds are on the horsemen.
</P>
<P>
   Ladoucer drives to the airstrip with a decision. Planning will
have to wait for another, safer day. The other aid workers are
already in their trucks. They're evacuating Ajiep.
</P>
<P>
   Roche and his Irish colleagues agree. They say goodbye to the
pilots, the mechanics and the local Sudanese employees.
</P>
<P>
   It's time to go.
</P>
<P>
   The small convoy pulls away from the landing strip, heading
east. The men and boys gathered next to the plane impassively watch
the vehicles disappear into the thorny brush.
</P>
<P>
   The attack on Ajiep never comes.
</P>
<P>
   But the foreigners have fled. And no one can say when they'll
return.
</P>
<P>
   Another threat. Another setback. Another day in southern Sudan.

WE COULD LIVE WITHOUT OLD-GROWTH FOREST, BUT WOULD BE POORER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DERRICK Z. JACKSON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Having hiked through an old-growth forest this summer in Oregon,
I was happy to see the courts recently freeze nine big logging
contracts in national forests in the Pacific Northwest. In Seattle,
federal district Judge William Dwyer said the government has not
adequately assessed the state of wildlife in these lush, towering
woods that would fall before the chainsaw.
</P>
<P>
   What was refreshing about the decision was that it was not just
the spotted owl that Dwyer cared about, the bird that became the
symbol of West Coast environmentalism in 1994 when tree huggers and
tree cutters were at war. Dwyer said the Clinton administration,
which forged a compromise that let logging continue in about
one-third of federally owned old-growth forests, had not made a
proper inventory of 77 species of flora and fauna. Few of the
species inspire much romance, such as rodents and snails.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what the courts are here for,'' Doug Heiken,
the western Oregon field representative for the Oregon Natural
Resources Council told The New York Times. ``The point is, the
agencies are going to have to come up with a way to do it right.''
</P>
<P>
   Having the hike fresh in my mind, it was easy to understand the
judge's caution, as timber companies complained about big
government. It is not just merely feeling so small and
insignificant among Douglas firs that are 800-1,000 years old and
nearly as tall as redwoods.
</P>
<P>
   It is the completeness of the forest, from the moss and lichens
hanging from the trees to the dense carpet of ferns and underbrush
at your feet. It is the deepest kind of green, a green that yielded
to sunglight in only the most miserly, scant beams, allowing almost
no details to be easily visible on the little brown wrens that
hopped along the branches.
</P>
<P>
   Alongside the trail, the Salmon River gurgled, as clear as tap
water. The answer to its clarity lay benath my feet. The forest
floor of packed-down leaves and needles, ancient root systems, and
massive piles of decayed rubble from previous generations of
Douglas firs and western red cedars filters the mountain runoff,
and allows no soil to erode, even in the heaviest storms.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old growth is not essential to the functioning of the Earth,''
Jerry Franklin, the University of Washington ecologist and one of
the first environmentalists to study old growth, once said. ``I
view old growth somewhat like I view museums or libraries or
universities. They increase the richness of our life here. The
world could survive without them, but it would be a much poorer
place.''
</P>
<P>
   It is a richness and completeness that we have finally begun to
appreciate, whether it is the 25 million acres of federally managed
spotted owl habitat out here, or the mere 700 acres back here in
Massachusetts. In recent years, scientists who had long assumed
that the highly developed East Coast had long cut down all its
virgin forest, have been finding patches of uncut, wind-shortened
350-year-old birches and relatively undistinguished but ancient
oaks in places like Mount Wachusett and Mount Greylock.
</P>
<P>
   Our old growth may not be as spectacular as out west, and not
even as interesting to the eye as the precious strands of tall
virgin pine in the north woods in Wisconsin and Minnesota. But it
is still a living museum of what parts of this continent looked
like before the Europeans. When Robert Leverett, a Holyoke computer
worker who searches for old-growth, found the birches on Mount
Wachusett, he said, ``we had the discovery of the decade.''
</P>
<P>
   Old growth is surely one of the ``discoveries'' of our time.
This year, a fund-raising drive among technology workers in the
Seattle area _ with a heavy focus on Microsoft _ raised $13.1
million to save old growth forest in Washington state. In suburban
Milwaukee, the Ozaukee Land Trust has been buying up tracts of
woods and forests that go back to the 1800s. ``Saving land should
be a concern of everyone,'' said trust founder George Row.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pacific Northwest, where divisions between loggers and
environmentalists are at their most bitter, so acrid that a tree
hugger scribbled over the map at the Salmon River trailhead ``This
area will not be logged,'' there are signs that saving the land has
become a significant priority. High-tech jobs now outnumber timber
jobs. Tourism has grown. Tourists do not want clear cuts.
</P>
<P>
   Neither does Judge Dwyer, at least until he is convinced that
cutting will not wipe out whole swaths of ecosystems. Here, the
fights are not so nasty, but Leverett said, ``Most of us really
have a feeling somewhere inside of us that these places are
important and we shouldn't let them slip away.'' Whether it is the
dim emerald of the western giants or the near cadavers of birches
that went undetected until recently, the old-growth forest is one
of our last chances to slip back into time.

SHE'S FOSTERING CHILDREN'S LITERATURE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK FEENEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The faintest look of pride crosses Frances Foster's
face as she holds up the cast on her left hand. A missed
dining-room step resulted in a broken finger, she confides. ``I set
it myself. I didn't think that was anything unusual (it hurt less
that way, actually), but they were somewhat surprised in the
emergency room.''
</P>
<P>
   Gracious women of a certain age (Foster is 68) are generally not
thought of as setters of broken bones _ theirs or anyone else's. If
anything, it's even more implausible when the lady in question is
one of the doyennes of children's books, that ostensibly sunniest
of corners on Publishers Row.
</P>
<P>
   But Foster has a knack for going against type. From serving as
her own paramedic to remaking her career when an employer tried to
force her into early retirement five years ago, she displays a
demure unflappability that has made her one of the most admired
editors in publishing and helped her see into print some of the
most admired children's books of the last few decades. ``When I see
her imprint on a book, it makes me want to read it,'' says Roger
Sutton, editor of The Horn Book magazine, the leading review of
children's books.
</P>
<P>
   She tinkles with laughter when asked if, beneath her quiet chic
and Seven Sister-ish manner, there lurks a touch of feistiness.
``I've heard myself described more times than I like to remember as
`gentle' or `ladylike.' . . . I can't deny that part of myself, but
I'm the other one, too!''
</P>
<P>
   Foster comes by her strength of character naturally. ``My
father's ancestors were Nantucket whalers named Starbuck (not
Starbucks coffee). When I married, and gave up Starbuck for Foster,
a number of Boston librarians, especially, were a little upset that
I was giving up that good New England name.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster's husband is a retired Bell Laboratories researcher. They
live three hours north of New York. She comes into the city on
Mondays to spend time with her grandchildren (she has three) and
most weeks comes into her office at Farrar, Straus and Giroux on
Tuesdays, Wednesdays, and Thursdays.
</P>
<P>
   One of her authors, Peter Sis, was so appalled by the first
sight of her office at the firm's legendarily seedy Union Square
quarters that he offered to paint a view for her windowless office.
Sis, a Czech emigre, was heard to mutter, ``I haven't seen anything
like this since coming through immigration.''
</P>
<P>
   Amenities apart, Foster has found a happy home at FSG. She
annually publishes a dozen or so titles under her own imprint,
Frances Foster Books. Last year, a sixth of her list _ Louis
Sachar's young-adult novel ``Holes'' and Sis's ``Tibet: Through the
Red Box'' _ accounted for a Newbery Medal (one of the two most
prestigious prizes in children's publishing), a National Book
Award, two Boston Globe-Horn Book awards, and a Caldecott Honor.
And as proof that mass can honor class, ``Holes'' is the
best-selling title Foster has published, with some 200,000 copies
in print.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, by ``Harry Potter'' standards, sales of which are
somewhere in the vicinity of 800,000 copies, that's merely
impressive. Yet thanks in large part to the ``Potter'' phenomenon,
there's a renewed interest in children's books _ and anyone
interested in the subject is likely to become interested in Foster.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's almost from some different time,'' marvels Sis. ``It's
easier to say what other editors do wrong than what she does
right.'' Trying to explain what makes Foster special, Sis summons
up an image magical enough for one of his books.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are these boats somewhere in Iran, I believe, on these
lakes with flowers? You go on the boats very slowly, with a pole
sort of sliding on the water. Working with Frances for me is like
that: When her boat bumps into mine, it does it so very gently.
Other editors are like speedboats and try to roll over you or
completely change your direction. She's very peaceful and
coexisting.''
</P>
<P>
   When Foster started in publishing, 45 years ago, it was in
children's books, and she's never strayed. She's worked with such
classic children's authors as Leo Lionni (Foster is one of his
memoirs' dedicatees) and Roald Dahl (``He could be charming _ and
then something little could happen that would just set him off: He
was a bomb ready to explode''). Those were authors she inherited,
though. More important are the ones whose careers she's helped
discover and/or nurture.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Besides Sis and Sachar, they include Kate Banks, Mordicai
Gerstein, Suzanne Fisher Staples, Ann Cameron, Claire Nivola,
Elizabeth Spires, and Jonathan Frost. Foster grimaces when asked
what makes for a Frances Foster book. Lacking ``a neat or succinct
answer,'' she proceeds to give just that _ albeit one that begs the
question _ ``I look for a book I just like so much I absolutely
have to publish it.''
</P>
<P>
   Two things do stand out, though: quality and an unwillingness to
underestimate young readers. Foster's authors have tacked subjects
that are diverse, distinctive, and _ for those expecting the same
old kids' stuff _ not a little daunting. They include coming of age
on the Indian subcontinent (Staples's ``Shabanu''), the wild boy of
Aveyron (Gerstein's ``Victor'' and ``The Wild Boy''), Galileo and
Tibetan mysticism (Sis's ``Starry Messenger'' and ``Tibet: Through
the Red Box''), Emily Dickinson (Spires's ``The Mouse of
Amherst''), the Holocaust (Nivola's ``Elisabeth''), and
homelessness (Frost's ``Gowanus Dogs'').
</P>
<P>
   ``People think children's publishing is play,'' Foster says.
``It's not taken quite seriously. I think people take it more
seriously now than they used to, partly because it's a money-making
end of the business. You know, people say when they hear you're in
children's publishing, `Oh, that must be so much fun!' Well, it is
fun, but it's also work.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster grew up in comfortable circumstances in Berkeley, Calif.
(her father was a banker), and came east _ or at least midwest _ to
attend Denison University. What is it that makes people go west?
``I think it's the same thing that makes people come east. At the
time, I thought Ohio was pretty far east.''
</P>
<P>
   After graduation, she spent a year in Rome doing office work.
She got her first publishing job as assistant to Alice Dalgliesh,
an important figure in children's books as both editor and writer.
Later, she worked as a freelance editor while raising her two
children, then joined Knopf (that's where she edited Lionni and
Dahl).
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The manner in which Foster shifted employers five years ago at
once belied and underscored her growing eminence in the field. That
Knopf wanted her to retire was a shock (and not just to her), but
even more of a shock (at least to her) was what came of it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was offered early retirement, and for maybe 12 hours I
thought, `Well, maybe this is as good a time as any.' I was
expecting a first grandchild and had an image of me pushing a
stroller again and thought there was a nice symmetry in it. Then by
the next morning I began getting phone calls from other publishers
asking what I was going to do. The first one was the one that
interested me most: FSG.''
</P>
<P>
   Foster has a near-unique perspective on children's books: from
prewar (when she was a consumer) to ``Harry Potter'' (her books now
compete against J. K. Rowling's). She spent her childhood reading
A. A. Milne, ``Alice's Adventures in Wonderland,'' and the ``Dr.
Dolittle'' books; and now navigates a marketplace in which
multimedia tie-ins are more important than story values at most
publishing houses. She believes the shift in the industry to a more
profit-oriented model took place when she was still a relatively
young editor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The big change in children's publishing came in the '60s, when
all of a sudden there was a lot of federal funding that went to
schools and libraries and there was a lot of money that came into
the industry. At the same time, looking back, you can see that men
began to come in then, too. When it began to be bigger business and
more money, it began to attract men. . . . Before that, it was a
female ghetto.''
</P>
<P>
   Happy to go her own way, courtesy of FSG, Foster looks forward
to publishing books well into the next decade. The one predictable
thing about her imprint is that it will go its own way, and that
way won't be quite like anyone else's.
</P>
<P>
   How unlike anyone else's? Asked to name the books she read with
her own children, Foster ticks off a list of usual suspects that
includes ``Make Way for Ducklings,'' ``Ferdinand the Bull,''
``Babar,'' ``Dolittle,'' the ``Mary Poppins'' series, Dahl's books,
and C. S. Lewis's. ``Conspicuously absent was Dr. Seuss,'' she
notes (with the slightest hint of glee?).
</P>
<P>
   ``Though he is universally appreciated, his books didn't appeal
to me; they wouldn't be Frances Foster Books.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Dave and Parnie Hagerman's four children, all girls, all
athletes, have unconventional names and unusual talents.
</P>
<P>
   The parents, private school educators, have lived their lives in
the sheltering circle of boarding schools. The world outside spun
around them, while the Hagermans were tucked safely on quiet, leafy
campuses, raising daughters.
</P>
<P>
   The Hagerman girls arrived at five- and six-year intervals, and
Dave and Parnie's child-rearing odyssey paralleled the evolution of
girls' sports. Ironically, the confines of conservative prep
schools gave their girls the freedom to be athletes long before the
rest of the world caught up.
</P>
<P>
   And the Hagerman sisters have jaw-dropping athletic credentials:
Casey, 29, good enough to be named to the Junior Olympic field
hockey squad as a high school senior, was one of the first ice
hockey recruits to Dartmouth College. Kulin, 23, graduated from
Middlebury College in June with three Division 3 national
championship titles, two in lacrosse and one in field hockey.
Jamison, 18, swept through Deerfield (Mass.) Academy starring on
the soccer, hockey, and lacrosse teams; spent a week this summer at
the USA Hockey Women's Hockey Festival in Lake Placid, N.Y.; and
joins the defending national champion hockey team as a freshman at
Harvard this year. And Whitaker, 11, is a seventh-grader in Wenham,
Mass. who plays hockey, soccer, field hockey, basketball, and
lacrosse, and who beats her sisters at tennis.
</P>
<P>
   The Hagermans know all about the rapid changes in girls' and
women's sports spawned by the passage of Title IX in 1972; they
have lived through them, year by year, season by season, with their
own kids. They had to work to find opportunities for Casey, and
now, nearly 20 years later, they are trying to limit them for Whit.
</P>
<P>
   Dave Hagerman was a goalie for the University of New Hampshire
hockey team in the 1960s, and Parnie Hagerman was named most
athletic girl at her high school in Manhasset, N.Y. So it was
natural that the Hagermans would introduce their children to
sports. They took their kids to the Y to swim, to the rink to
skate, to the tennis court near their summer cottage on Bailey
Island, Maine.
</P>
<P>
   At the prep schools where the Hagermans lived and worked _ first
Deerfield, then Hotchkiss, then Pingree _ the campuses were filled
with kids doing things: lacrosse and hockey and soccer, as well as
drama and art and academics. Everyone did everything: boys, girls,
teachers, faculty kids. So first Casey, then Kully, Jamie, and Whit
simply walked out the door of their campus house and joined in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I started by following,'' said Casey, who grew up at
Deerfield. ``I got involved because my dad was coaching hockey. All
I looked forward to in the world was being a stick girl and
standing on the bench with my Dad (at games) on Saturday
afternoons.''
</P>
<P>
   But when they wanted to introduce Casey to organized sports
outside the cocoon of family and Deerfield, the Hagermans had to
knock down doors to find teams that would let her play.
</P>
<P>
   ``(The Greenfield, Mass., youth hockey organization) wouldn't
let me play hockey because there was no accommodation for girls,''
said Casey, now married, the mother of a 1-year-old son, Jake, and
an educator herself in Dallas. ``And they didn't want me to get
hurt.''
</P>
<P>
   After newspaper stories began to appear throughout the nation
about sports programs starting to open to girls, Casey finally got
a chance to play youth hockey in fourth grade. She loved hockey,
but it was a lonely experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember boys scoring goals and hugging their friends, and
they wouldn't come near me,'' she said. ``In sixth grade, I had to
change into my hockey stuff in the handicapped stall of the women's
room. I was the only girl . . . it was hard. It was lonely to get
changed in that bathroom by myself, knowing my friends were all
together in the locker room.''
</P>
<P>
   Kully, six years younger, watched as her sister pushed open
doors. But Kully, a very social person, didn't like what she saw in
the little rooms behind those doors. She didn't want to be the only
girl on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Casey started playing hockey and swimming, and I just
followed,'' said Kully. ``She liked hockey more, but I stuck with
swimming. I saw her having to change in the bathroom, and I saw she
was the only girl. That wasn't very attractive to me at that
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Kully stayed with the traditional girls' sports of field hockey
and lacrosse and the separate but equal world of swimming, with
co-ed meets but competition restricted to same-sex races.
</P>
<P>
   And Kully participated in another era in the growth of women's
sports. She chose to go to Division 3 Middlebury College, in part
because she wanted the opportunity to be one of the last of the
three-sport athletes. For her first two years, she swam and played
field hockey and lacrosse. As the demands of playing for two
nationally-ranked teams grew, she dropped swimming for the last two
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``When I went to college, I really didn't know which sports I
wanted to do, and the last thing I wanted to do was give up
swimming, which was the sport I'd been doing the longest,'' said
Kully, newly appointed assistant coach for field hockey and
lacrosse at Wesleyan. ``It's so difficult to manage, even with two
sports. Everyone is just specializing so much now, even coaches.
Middlebury was perfect timing.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jamie began taking part in sports, the doors had all swung
wide open. Living at Hotchkiss School in Lakeville, Conn., Jamie
began youth hockey at age 4. It was a small town, and the rest of
the players on her team were boys, but that was not a big deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really, honestly thought I was a boy until I was 6 years
old,'' Jamie said. ``We were all best friends, and we did
everything together.''
</P>
<P>
   Jamie also skated with the girls' team at Hotchkiss, climbing
off the school bus from elementary school and running to the rink.
She didn't run into any doors until junior high _ but then she
found there were some people who were slamming them in her face.
</P>
<P>
   When Casey was young, the boys who didn't want her on the ice
had tried to flatten her. ``I remember one time a boy just teed me
up and pummeled me behind the net,'' Casey said. ``I felt my
collarbone snap. But there was no way I was getting off the ice. I
got to the bench and said to my father, `something's wrong with my
arm.' He got the biggest kick that I finished the game and shook
hands. But he never said `tough it out' to me.''
</P>
<P>
   When Jamie hit eighth grade and the boys began to resent her
presence, she was too good, too strong a skater: They couldn't
flatten what they couldn't catch. So they threw words.
</P>
<P>
   ``At an Avon-Salisbury youth hockey game, a kid said, `why don't
you just go home to your boyfriend?' '' Jamie said. ``It was the
first time I heard that stuff. They said, `you suck, you're a girl'
and `your boobs are getting in the way,' and stronger stuff. I
didn't talk to my mom right away, but I told Kully (then a junior
in high school), and she was outraged.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnie and Dave decided to move Jamie to the Polar Bears girls'
hockey program, a 90-minute drive each way for practice, but one of
the nation's strongest girls' teams and enough of a challenge for
the talented Jamie.
</P>
<P>
   Five years younger than Kully, Jamie won't even try to be a
three-sport athlete at Division 1 Harvard. She hopes she can play
lacrosse along with hockey, but she isn't sure.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie, you see, spent much of her senior year in high school
answering the phone. College recruiting for women athletes had
arrived. In the 10 years between the flattering attention
Dartmouth's George Crowe gave to Casey and the constant cajoling
and convincing that a host of coaches rained down on Jamie, the
scene had changed. The Hagermans had realized that ice hocky
prowess was a powerful addition to the college admissions folder.
</P>
<P>
   ``The recruiting is tough because there weren't a lot of girls
before me that could tell me what to expect,'' Jamie said. ``It was
intense for a month, then I made my decision in November. And it
was hard because hockey was always my safe place to go. Then when
the calls from coaches were coming, three or four a day, it wasn't
as much fun as it used to be. I had to sit back and think (about
where to go.)''
</P>
<P>
   The pressure to train constantly and to specialize in one sport
has begun to reach down to girls in Whit's age group.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be more vigilant with Whit than with either Casey,
Kully, or Jimmer because there's so much overemphasis now,'' Parnie
said. ``You have to keep it balanced. Now there's so much
attention, so much year-round stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Whit, who plays youth hockey with a co-ed town team, has had the
opportunity to play with Assabet Valley, a challenging girls'
program, right from the start of her hockey career.
</P>
<P>
   But she has also been pressured by the coach of the all-star
soccer team to participate year-round. Already tall, she has drawn
the attention of the rec league basketball coach.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a `be careful what you wish for' situation for women,''
said Parnie.
</P>
<P>
   It was, of course, Parnie who was the first chapter in this
story. Born with athletic talent and a desire to play, Parnie had
no opportunities. When she went to UNH in the 1960s, there was no
women's sports program. None.
</P>
<P>
   ``I kid with the girls that I was born too soon,'' Parnie said,
``but it wasn't a few years too soon, it was 30 years too soon.''
</P>
<P>
   And yet Parnie is not envious of the opportunities her children
have had that she did not. And her older daughters do not envy
their younger sisters. Each enjoys the next one's success, so much
so that Casey, once an ice hockey star herself, said she gets
goosebumps on her arms just talking about Jamie's extraordinary
physical gifts and her success in hockey.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time you can say your kids have things you didn't,
your life is a success,'' said Parnie. ``I don't know if I could _
even now _ do an athletic career and have these four beautiful
children. If I'd had to choose, there's no question what I'd do.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnie, sitting on a bench next to Whit and Jamie, smiles
broadly at her two youngest children.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, she says, Jamie, or perhaps it will be Whit, won't have
to make that choice between building a career as an athlete and
building a family. Maybe with all the doors open, there will be
room to move about.

AFTER BELGRADE BOMBINGS, BASKETBALL DIPLOMACY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN DONNELLY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BELGRADE _ They were here to play basketball for an Italian
team, here to compete in a preseason tournament, three games packed
into four days.
</P>
<P>
   But there was a little twist of fate: Sydney Johnson and Lee
Nailon are Americans _ among the first Americans other than
journalists to come to Belgrade since the end of the Kosovo war.
</P>
<P>
   Whose idea was this, anyway? Americans shooting hoops in
Belgrade, two months after US pilots were dropping bombs on the
city? Doesn't more time need to pass between bombs and basketball
games?
</P>
<P>
   The players were wondering just that.
</P>
<P>
   ``I must admit I was really nervous about coming,'' said
Johnson, 25, a Princeton University graduate, a few hours after his
arrival last week. He was sitting in the opulent Hyatt Regency
hotel lobby that swarmed with other basketball players on his team,
Milano Olympia. ``I called my girlfriend, called my brother. He
told me to be careful.''
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, who graduated with a degree in history, looked around
the lobby, anchored on one end by a statue of the Greek god Zeus
lifting a brass clock above his head. ``It is kind of weird to be
here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nailon, 24, who played well enough at Texas Christian University
to be a second-round draft pick this year of the National
Basketball Association's Charlotte Hornets, spread his 6-foot-8
frame across a plush maroon couch, his feet hanging off the edge.
He admitted he hadn't known what he was getting into.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know nothing about Belgrade being bombed,'' he said.
``I mean, I knew that we bombed somewhere over here, but I didn't
know it was here. I just found out a few days ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the first game against the Yugoslav Red Stars, Milano
coach Marco Crespi gathered his team together. ``This is the first
tournament after the war,'' he told them. ``It's not just an
ordinary basketball tournament, it's a tournament that shows people
in Belgrade that life can go on.''
</P>
<P>
   Crespi also preached caution. Later, he told a reporter, ``I
said to them, maybe the situation in Belgrade is OK, maybe it
isn't. Maybe going out at night isn't the best thing to do, and
maybe it's best not to drink more than Coke in the pub. And in the
games, behave like gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   At the tipoff, which Nailon failed to control, most of the 3,000
fans cheered loudly for the home team. When Johnson dribbled up
court for the first time, scattered boos rang out.
</P>
<P>
   At halftime, with NBA-like cheerleaders dressed in skimpy
Spandex dancing to ``Hit the Road, Jack,'' Serb fans, extremely
knowledgeable about the game, assessed the two Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The playmaker, Johnson, he plays for the team, not for
himself,'' said Nikola Bozic, 18. ``Nailon, he can play better than
this, you can tell. He can score.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They are very stylish players,'' said Dragan Kopribic, 17.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're glad the Americans are here,'' said Zoran Jevremcebic,
19. ``We have nothing against players. Sports has nothing to do
with politics.''
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, Johnson stepped out of the dressing room. ``It was
fun,'' he said. ``Just a basketball game.''
</P>
<P>
   Vladmir Momcholeich, 15, approached him. ``Can I have your
autograph?'' he asked. As Johnson scribbled his name, Momcholeich
said, ``I like your game.''
</P>
<P>
   The games went on. A Greek team blew out Milano by 20 points in
the second game. In Milano's final game, they beat another Yugoslav
team and finished fifth in the six-team tournament. Nailon turned
into one of the top players, scoring more than 20 points in each of
the last two games. Johnson hurt his ankle in the second game, and
sat out the final contest.
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere along the way, the games became just games. And
Belgrade became less fearsome.
</P>
<P>
   One afternoon, the team ate lunch at the downtown American
Sports Cafe and then walked around the city. Nailon took out his
video camera and started taping some youngsters stretching at a
basketball camp. When the youngsters saw the players, they stood
up. Some saluted, some waved, some yelled ``Hello! Hello!''
</P>
<P>
   ``That was neat,'' said Nailon, a South Bend, Ind., native who
hopes to play in the NBA next year. ``I just wanted to show
everybody back home that they have parks, too, and they play
basketball. Now, I'm not saying this is like home. I mean, the ice
cream is different, the chicken wings are not chicken wings. No
way. And they smoke in the gym. Can you believe that? They don't do
that back home. I walked into the gym, and said, `Hey, it's smoky
in here.' I was choking.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you know, it's pretty wild you're actually in the town
that got bombed, sitting with people that went through the
bombing,'' Nailon said. ``I feel like I was part of history.''

<P>
   JAFFREY, N.H. _ For the last three days, Peter Sawyer has
awakened at 2:45 a.m. to milk his cows.
</P>
<P>
   It takes him a minute to remember.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, with the smell of carbon still hanging in the air,
Sawyer remarked that he had 18 cows to dehorn, and then he
remembered they were dead. Ann Sawyer asked her daughter the time,
and her daughter responded gently, ``4:20. You'd be doing chores.''
</P>
<P>
   Every day for 31 years the Sawyers' lives have revolved around
their cows, and three days after 120 burned to death family members
wander around ``floppy-headed,'' as Peter puts it, stunned with
loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``Time means nothing anymore,'' he said slowly, from a folding
chair set up by the barn's charred foundation.
</P>
<P>
   When Peter Sawyer was born, almost 62 years ago, there were 15
family dairy farms in Jaffrey. As of this week, there are none.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, when Fire Chief Jack White arrived at Sawyer Farm at
2:15 a.m., the barn was ``80 percent involved,'' the yard lit
nightmarishly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew all the cows would be in there,'' White said. ``I
didn't see Peter, but I had a feeling I knew where he was.''
</P>
<P>
   He found Sawyer in the blazing milkroom, the hayloft in danger
of crashing down on his head, trying to drive his cows from their
stalls out into the yard before the smoke knocked him out. White
had to scream at Sawyer to get him out, the way he would have to
scream at a long line of people that night who took too many risks
trying to save Sawyer Farm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw things the other night that I just can't allow,'' White
said.
</P>
<P>
   The struggle with the panicked animals went on crazily, for
hours. Cows will run right back into a burning barn; the barn is
where they feel safe, White said. Several times he and his team
drove cows to safety and watched them race back into the fire. The
animals screamed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll never forget it,'' White said. ``You could hear them, and
you can see them, and it's not like seeing people, but if it
doesn't bother you, something's wrong with you.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Sawyer fire, Jaffrey lost the last remnant of a way of
life that has been draining away for years. Peter Sawyer can't
supply the date when he started working the 400-acre farm, but it
was sometime after his older brother vowed that he'd be ``damned if
he pulled teats for a living'' and sometime before he brought Ann
up to the mountain pasture to make sure she liked cows, a family
courtship ritual.
</P>
<P>
   It was he _ the second-youngest of six boys _ who carried on the
legacy of Josiah Sawyer, who settled over the hill in 1800, and
Alfred Sawyer, and Clifton Sawyer, and Jason Clifton Sawyer.
</P>
<P>
   When Peter and his brothers were growing up there were 15 dairy
farms active in Jaffrey. But by the time he returned from college,
only five remained. In the years the Sawyers farmed here, the small
dairy farm became an increasingly tenuous proposition. During the
1980s and 1990s, the number of dairy farms in New Hampshire was
reduced by two-thirds. However, milk production remained steady _
those farmers who hung on typically doubled or tripled the size of
their herds, moving to high-volume, mechanized milking techniques.
</P>
<P>
   That line of reasoning never took hold with Peter Sawyer, who
has a lasting, vocal contempt for the modern farmer's longing for
``lifestyle.'' With the exception of three vacations _ ``less than
21 days, and all spent on his friend's dairy farm in New York
State,'' Ann Sawyer said _ the two have never left the farm.
</P>
<P>
   At 2:45 a.m. every morning, Peter milked 107 cows and spent the
hours before an 8 a.m. breakfast doing ``chores'' such as cleaning
and feeding the herd. The peak hours of the day went to outdoor
``work.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Farmers have chores, and then they have work, and the chores
don't count,'' Sawyer explained.
</P>
<P>
   This isn't the first disaster to hit Sawyer Farm. In the
mid-1980s, one of the Sawyers' silos toppled over, crushing part of
the barn and mobilizing such a massive neighborhood relief effort
that the reconstructed silo has borne a huge ``THANK YOU'' painted
on it for the past 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   But although a collection can at Coll's Farm Stand had $20 bills
in it, this time the farm has sustained damage beyond the good will
of its neighbors. Lost in the fire was two-thirds of the Sawyers'
herd _ 120 cows worth up to $1,500 apiece who are now buried in one
of their fields. Although the family has insurance on the farm,
only half of the cows were covered.
</P>
<P>
   As the cleanup dragged into its third day, one of the barn cats
wandered around with her whiskers singed into corkscrews. Ann
Sawyer nursed two burned calves that stayed behind when the rest of
the survivors were shipped to a relative's farm.
</P>
<P>
   Friends called again and again, and she tried, not very
persuasively, to be cheerful.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know,'' she told one, ``It's a whole lifetime, and it goes
in about 15 minutes, and you clean it up in a day and a half.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the firefighters _ who went home to their own lives after
18 hours at the scene _ have had trouble getting this fire out of
their heads, White said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Someone found a cow in the bushes, a small one, and he said,
`Hey, there's a cow there,' and (Ann Sawyer) knew the cow's name,''
White said.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, it was just a whole bunch of cows,'' he said. ``But she
knew their names. You realize this was a way of life.''

CLINTONS INVADE GOP TERRITORY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SYRACUSE, N.Y. _ Monday, when I got to the building where First
Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton and her husband were to speak to 500 of
Carl McCall's most intimate friends, a 25-foot-high Elvis Presley
balloon was bouncing in the breeze outside the place.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidence? Well, that's what they would like you to think, I'm
sure.
</P>
<P>
   The scene was the luncheon the state comptroller throws annually
at the New York State Fair. Diners are central New York business
and union leaders and local politicians of both parties. Generally,
Comptroller Carl McCall fills them with light food and heavy talk
of public money. This year, he was only the warm up act.
</P>
<P>
   The Clintons had just flown in for a few days of what's billed
as vacation. It's actually a conspicuous bit of campaigning on the
first lady's part. She wants to be seen in a section of New York
where Democrats are badly outnumbered.
</P>
<P>
   The first family was occupying the lavish home of a real estate
developer on the east side of Skaneateles Lake. The decor of every
room is identical _ gigantic. The place is 8,200 square feet,
complete with pool, Jacuzzi and tennis courts. Skaneateles, by the
way, is an Iroquois word that translates to ``Land of Many
Republicans.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what New York Republican bosses like to believe is
serious hostility, especially upstate, toward the first lady as she
moves ever closer to a run for the U.S. Senate next year, the
Clintons received a conspicuously warm welcome from the politically
mixed crowd McCall had brought together. Mrs. Clinton was granted
hearty applause after a brief and eminently forgettable talk about
how much she likes New York. And the president brought down the
house with feigned complaints about arriving too late to eat and
recalling other fairs he has known and loved.
</P>
<P>
   As the Clintons were finishing up making nice with the people
McCall had brought together, I headed for Skaneateles. That's the
169-year-old village of 2,700 where the Clintons were staying. It's
a ritzy Syracuse suburb, the most dependably Republican community
in Onondaga County, a little gem of a town at the northern tip of a
glittering, 16-mile-long lake nestled between elegant, rolling,
tree-studded hills.
</P>
<P>
   All along the route the Clinton motorcade was to take from the
state fairgrounds to Skaneateles, hundreds of people sat in their
front yards with welcoming signs. One house with a ``For Sale by
Owner'' sign in the front yard sported a second sign that read,
``Will Hold Mortgage for First Family.''
</P>
<P>
   The center of Skaneateles, Genesee and Jordan Streets, was alive
with people hoping to catch a glimpse of the motorcade as it
flashed through the village. I parked and went looking for Doug
Clark and John Angyal. Clark is a white-bearded guy in a seafarer's
hat who operates a popular seafood joint on Jordan Street. Angyal
operates a flashy burger joint called Johnny Angel's a few doors
away. Angyal looks like a retired state trooper. That's because he
is a retired state trooper.
</P>
<P>
   Clark said he wouldn't serve the Clintons if they entered Doug's
Fish Fry. Clark says he loves America and hates liars, and it's his
joint, and that's that.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Angyal says he's a devoted right-winger, but he'd
be delighted to serve the Clintons. The guy is president, after
all, even if he's not a president that Angyal thinks highly of.
</P>
<P>
   Johnny Angel's has even named a sandwich after Hillary. It's
baloney and cheese on a hard roll _ mostly baloney. In just a few
weeks, Angyal has gone through 400 pounds of baloney. He's not sure
what that means for Mrs. Clinton's run for the Senate next year. He
knows what it means for the burger business, though.

IT'S TOUGH SITTING OUT THIS ONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   Carolyn Jones-Young was drafted by the New York Liberty last
spring, but she hasn't seen a minute of action. So now the team is
in the playoffs, and Young is seeing them from her least favorite
position _ on TV at her new home in Attleboro, Mass. That's because
the former New England Blizzard guard tore her anterior cruciate
ligament in a game last November, after averaging 20 points per
game in five games.
</P>
<P>
   More bad luck came when the Blizzard's American Basketball
League folded just before Christmas. The players were left
league-less and jobless until the WNBA agreed to open its draft to
former ABL players.
</P>
<P>
   And it seemed to make no difference to the New York Liberty that
Young would join the team on the disabled list. The Liberty took a
look at her resume _ 1992 Olympic team, 1997 ABL scoring leader,
back-to-back SEC Player of the Year when at Auburn _ and in May
drafted the 5-foot-9-inch guard in the fourth round.
</P>
<P>
   Now the team is in the WNBA finals.
</P>
<P>
   The Liberty beat the Detroit Shock in the first round of the
playoffs, then beat the Charlotte Sting last Monday, and will now
face the Houston Comets, the two-time defending champion, in a
series starting Thursday (8 p.m., Lifetime TV).
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been watching all the games and biting my nails,'' Young
said Tuesday, surrounded by unpacked boxes in her new home. She
just moved from Florida last week, because her husband, Charlton,
has begun work as an assistant coach for the men's basketball team
at Northeastern.
</P>
<P>
   Young, 30, (still known as ``CJ,'' from her pre-married days at
the Blizzard) said she is doing rehab exercises for her knee three
days a week, but that recovery might take longer than expected
because a very significant extinuating circumstance _ she's
pregnant with her first child, due in November.
</P>
<P>
   But she said she'll be ready to go when the team starts training
next spring.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got five, six months to whip myself into shape,'' she
said. ``I miss it so much.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Great expectation
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Framingham (Mass.) State soccer player Nicole Abbott will have
two new titles when the team reconvenes this fall. One is captain;
the other is mom. Abbott, 26, who gave birth to Leah last May,
obviously didn't let pregnancy get in the way of her playing.
</P>
<P>
   The native of Switzerland was Player of the Year for the
Massachusetts State College Athletic Conference (MASCAC), as she
scored 20 goals and had 13 assists. The junior was 29th in the
nation among NCAA Division 3 scoring leaders, averaging 2.79 points
a game.
</P>

NO OTHER BIRDS OF THIS FEATHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Larry's got a heart condition. Magic contracted HIV. Michael had
better go get a check-up.
</P>
<P>
   His Airness probably should stop smoking those cigars, anyway.
Mortality doesn't know from superstars.
</P>
<P>
   According to Larry Bird, his ``atrial fibrillation'' is under
control. He's paying at least partial attention to the doctors when
they tell him to exercise, watch his diet, and consume alcohol ``in
moderation.'' He's not planning on checking out any time soon.
</P>
<P>
   From this earthly existence, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   But the Pacers are a different matter. Bird says this coming
season will be his last as coach. Al Harrington and Jonathan Bender
will have to become NBA stars under someone else.
</P>
<P>
   This is absolutely horrible news. Not having Bird as a player
these past seven seasons has been bad enough. Not having him as a
coach in a league that currently has about as much sizzle as a 1955
Packard is even worse.
</P>
<P>
   In a league of overcoaching zealots, Bird has been the
anti-Riley. Oh, he has taken the job very seriously. He does the
work in the gym. He looks at the tapes. He goes over the scouting
reports. But that stuff isn't why he has been one of the great
coaches in the league these past two years. He has been the NBA's
most intriguing coach because he has been able to cut through the
bull and reach players on a level beyond the scope of the average
mentor.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most sacred tenets in all of sport is this:
Superstars can't coach. The theory always has been that the
ultra-successful player always lacks patience when dealing with
lesser mortals. The theory has been that the ultra-successful
player has no way of connecting with anyone but himself. The theory
has been that the ultra-successful player may not even know the
minutiae of the game, because people at such a lofty level never
have to deal with same.
</P>
<P>
   In just one training camp, Bird turned this ancient theory on
its head. He demonstrated that he could relate to Reggie Miller. He
demonstrated that he could relate to Antonio Davis. He demonstrated
that he could relate to Fred Hoiberg. He demonstrated that he knew,
in a very K.C. Jones kind of way, what mattered and what didn't
matter when it came to the winning and losing of ballgames.
</P>
<P>
   And when the time came to get tough to make a point, he
demonstrated that he had picked up a trick or two from another
coach he admired, the somewhat autocratic Bill Fitch. You do
remember him leaving Dale Davis and Travis Best on the tarmac when
they arrived seconds too late for an Indiana airplane excursion,
don't you? Even Ann Landers weighed in on that one.
</P>
<P>
   His courtside demeanor is Old School. He stands up at times, but
he probably spends more time on the bench, allowing his players to
play, than any other 10 coaches combined. He knows what he knows,
but he doesn't pretend to know everything. Very often there is a
timeout in which Dick Harter or Rick Carlisle does all the talking.
</P>
<P>
   That's another thing. The Pacers have two assistant coaches.
Just about everybody else has three. Bird's reasoning?
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd rather have two assistant coaches and pay them better than
three, than just to have three,'' he said after taking the job.
``If I find I'll need another coach, I'll hire one.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps more than anything else he did, this one move of Bird
got the positive attention of his players. It showed them that he
really was different. They all knew the self-indulgent nonsense of
having three assistant coaches in the NBA. Having three assistant
coaches is merely a way of making the job seem more complicated
than it really is. It's just another excuse to have a guy holding a
clipboard. Bird wasn't going to contribute to the farce, and the
players immediately loved him for it.
</P>
<P>
   The NBA needs Bird out there where everyone can see him. He is a
reminder of better days on the court and evidence that not every
coach in the league has lost his mind. It remains an event when the
Pacers come to town. People may not pay to see a coach, but when
this coach shows up, the people get on their feet and put their
hands together because they recognize him as something special.
</P>
<P>
   But, hey, how about this heart stuff, huh? You got used to
Larry's laundry list of physical ailments. If it wasn't his elbow,
it was his heel. If it wasn't his heel, it was his back. And always
there were the mangled fingers. The truth is, he spent most of the
final five years of his playing career in the hands of doctors and
physical therapists hoping to get one more day on the court. We all
got used to the idea that his body had its imperfections. A year
after he was through, the guy needed major back surgery just to be
able to lead a pain-free, somewhat normal life. Throwing a heart
problem into the mix seems to be piling on.
</P>
<P>
   The fact that he wants out of coaching has nothing to do with
the heart. He never had any intention of being a coaching lifer. He
took the Pacer job because it made sense for him at the time. It
was the right team in the right city for the right management at
the precise moment in Larry Bird's life when he was ready to coach.
He made it clear he wasn't going to be around very long.
</P>
<P>
   That's before we saw him in action. Every day he coaches is a
good day for the NBA. Let me be the first to address the 1999-2000
season: Go Pacers.

RAMON SET FOR TEST; PEDRO MERELY TESTY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB DUFFY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Enough of this nonsense, Pedro Martinez decided.
</P>
<P>
   He had sat and seethed as an ever-growing media gaggle
encroached on his locker space in the Red Sox clubhouse at Fenway
Park Tuesday. He had tried to shoo away the nuisances _ ``Out! Out!
Out!'' _ but the mass merely shifted as the questions persisted:
</P>
<P>
   ``How do you feel approaching your start Thursday?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Did you ever doubt you could come back?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it make a difference that you'll be returning in the heat
of a playoff race?''
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Pedro lashed out on behalf of his older brother Ramon,
to whom all the questions had been addressed at the adjoining stall
and who was answering them with polite, subdued grace.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is it,'' Pedro snapped at the infidels. ``He's not saying
no more until after he pitches. He's been talking to you guys the
last four days. It's too much. Leave him alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Some teammates reclining on a nearby lounge were noticeably
enjoying the sideshow.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hey,'' said fellow pitcher Tim Wakefield indignantly, ``how
come you don't say anything when they're all over me?''
</P>
<P>
   Pedro's reply was brief and emphatic: ``I've got to take care of
my brother.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   As noble as Pedro's sense of sibling protection might be, the
27-year-old Cy Young cinch will be nothing more than a helpless and
nervous bystander Thurdsay when his 31-year-old brother makes his
Boston debut _ and first major league start since undergoing
extensive right rotator cuff surgery 14 months ago _ against the
Kansas City Royals at Fenway.
</P>
<P>
   This will mark an official reunion for the brothers from Santo
Domingo in the Dominican Republic. But in a pitching sense, their
roles will be reversed. When Pedro broke in with the Dodgers in
1993, Ramon was entrenched as Los Angeles's ace, a two-time
All-Star and one-time 20-game winner who was on his way to racking
up 123 victories in 11 seasons. Now Pedro rules the American
League, if not all baseball, with his 19-4 record, and Ramon is the
test case. When he takes the mound, it will mark the first time in
the Sox' 99-year history that brothers have pitched for them.
</P>
<P>
   But general manager Dan Duquette was interested in more than a
historical footnote when he signed Ramon in March after the Dodgers
declined to exercise their option on his services for 1999.
Duquette was taking another of his famous fliers. He was banking _
reportedly to the tune of some $8 million guaranteed on a two-year
contract _ that he could salvage yet another discard. Now, after 10
rehabilitation starts, the results of this reclamation project will
be on display.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike his brother, Ramon isn't making more of this trial run
than is necessary.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what his attitude was as the experiment reaches its final,
make-or-break stage, Ramon said, ``Confident.''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't expect any flashbacks to his major league debut in
1988.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think I'm going to go through that again,'' he said.
``I just consider it another start. It's a long time since I've
been out there, but I just look at it as another game.''
</P>
<P>
   He claims he considered this venture inevitable, not
implausible.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always been very confident,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, there were doubts, but they lasted less than a day. Having
first experienced pain in his shoulder in 1997, Ramon shrugged it
off while building a 7-3 record through May 1998. ``But I found it
was getting worse,'' he said, ``and that's when I shut it down.''
</P>
<P>
   The surgeons opened him up on June 30. They hoped a mere
arthroscopy would repair the tear they had discovered, ``but if
that didn't work, they'd have to operate.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst-case scenario occurred, an invasive procedure that
left Ramon with great discomfort and misgivings the morning after.
``That's when it got most negative,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But he exorcised that thought process and proceeded vigorously
with rehab under new auspices.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are always doubts when someone has a major injury,''
said Red Sox pitching coach Joe Kerrigan, who will hold his newest
starter to an 85-pitch limit. ``But knowing the character of the
man, I believed he could do it. We've created a spot for him in the
rotation. That's how much we think of him. But after this start,
we'll have to evaluate and see how he feels.''
</P>
<P>
   There's no mistaking how the Martinezes feel about each other.
Even by the standards of family, they are especially close.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel very confident with Pedro here,'' said Ramon, ``because
he trusts me. I know he's going to be 100 percent behind me. He's
going to help me.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Pedro's unsolicited censorship represented role reversal
of another sort.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ramon is truly the big brother,'' said Jason Varitek, who will
catch the elder Martinez for the first time Thursday and is an old
hand at handling Pedro.
</P>
<P>
   Ramon concurred: ``I'm taller than him. I'm older than him.''
</P>
<P>
   But there is far more cooperation that conflict in this
relationship. They would fight as youngsters, Ramon recalled, but
it never escalated to fisticuffs. ``Just arguments,'' he said.
``Brother things.''
</P>
<P>
   And it seemed that justice generally would prevail.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whoever had the reason would win,'' said Ramon. ``If he was
wrong, I won. If I was wrong, he won.''
</P>
<P>
   It appears their latest association is a win-win situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``They trust each other reciprocally,'' said Varitek. ``They
bounce stuff off each other. Both have such a high knowledge of the
game that they help each other.''
</P>
<P>
   While Ramon has spent most of the season touring various minor
league convalescence stops, the old order seems to assert itself
when the brothers get together.
</P>
<P>
   ``When Ramon is here, he helps Pedro,'' said Kerrigan. ``As the
big brother, Pedro has a lot of respect for him. He's almost like a
father figure to Pedro.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Then what in the world was Tuesday night's little tantrum all
about?
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, that's just Pedro,'' assured Ramon. ``He's always like
that. It's nothing serious.''
</P>
<P>
   Then surely Pedro would be willing to talk about his big
brother, say, on the eve of his grand return.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you, I'm not talking,'' Pedro snarled as he headed to
the sanctuary of the trainer's room. ``I pitched yesterday
(Monday).''
</P>
<P>
   Ramon merely shook his head knowingly. These kids today.

CLEAR SAILING IN THE PACIFIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON INDRISANO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The first consequences from the rash of injuries in the handicap
ranks were apparent when General Challenge, the only 3-year-old in
the race, won the $1 million Pacific Classic at Del Mar Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most prominent victims of the injuries incurred by
older horses this year were Victory Gallop and Real Quiet, who were
hurt while training for the Pacific Classic. If those two had
stayed healthy, General Challenge, a very good but not great
sophomore, would have been an afterthought. Instead, he dominated
the proceedings, winning by a comfortable 3 lengths.
</P>
<P>
   It should come as no surprise that Bob Baffert, who is both
lucky and good, was the first trainer to benefit from the lack of
talent in what remains of the handicap ranks. He not only saddled
General Challenge to victory, but another one of his charges, River
Keen, a reformed claimer, finished second.
</P>
<P>
   General Challenge, who was bred in California, won the Santa
Anita Derby but had a horrible trip in the Kentucky Derby and
finished 10th. He came back to win the Affirmed but was beaten by
Cat Thief in the Swaps. In the Pacific Classic, he was 5-2 ($7.20
to win), while Malek was 6-5. But Malek is old, tired, and has
chronic back problems. General Challenge simply stalked the pace
under David Flores, took over around the far turn and drew away.
Malek never fired, and finished fifth, beaten a dozen lengths.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had confidence in him,'' said Flores. ``When we hit the
backside, I let him open up some. Then, at the three-eighths pole,
I let him roll. Turning for home, I didn't think anybody was going
to beat him.''
</P>
<P>
   The victory by General Challenge came as a boost to owners John
and Betty Mabee, who had just learned that their top filly,
Excellent Meeting, suffered a bone chip in her ankle that required
season-ending surgery. Excellent Meeting is by General Meeting, the
same sire as General Challenge.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mabees needed that,'' said Baffert. ``This horse has so
much talent. What you saw today is just the tip of the iceberg.''
</P>
<P>
   Because of the injuries, which also claimed Silver Charm, Free
House, and Mazel Trick, only Behrens, the last prominent older
horse left standing, can stop the 3-year-olds from dominating the
big handicap races this fall. First up might be Lemon Drop Kid, who
won the $1 million Travers at Saratoga Saturday. Trainer Scotty
Schulhofer said that the $500,000 Woodward at Belmont Sept. 18 is a
possibility for his promising colt. The Woodward is expected to
draw Almutawkel, the Godolphin Stable horse who won the $5 million
Dubai World Cup March 28, and Running Stag, who took the Saratoga
Breeders' Cup on Sunday. Behrens reportedly is waiting for the $1
million Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Oct. 10.
</P>
<P>
   Can Lemon Drop Kid win the Woodward? Well, his chances are a lot
better than they'd be if Silver Charm, Real Quiet, and Victory
Gallop were in the race.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chilukki still perfect
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Baffert turned loose Chilukki, his rapid 2-year-old filly, on
the Pacific Classic undercard, and she did not disappoint, winning
the $250,000 Del Mar Debutante to remain undefeated at 5 for 5.
However, for the first time, Chilukki, who was off at 1-5 ($2.40 to
win) did not blow her opposition away, winning by ``only'' a
length. It also marked the first time that Chilukki had run as far
as 7 furlongs, but Flores denied that she was getting tired. ``She
was playing around in the stretch,'' said Flores. ``I know she
looked like she was tired, but she wasn't. She just didn't have any
competition. When that other filly came to her, she went again.''
``That other filly'' was Spain, off at 16-1 and ridden by Gary
Stevens. Spain gave the chalk players an anxious moment when she
ran at Chilukki through the stretch. ``Going into the race, it
didn't look like there was any way we were going to beat
Chilukki,'' said Stevens. ``Spain's people said they'd just be
happy with a placing. Then, at the eighth-pole, I thought I was
going to win it.'' Said Baffert, ``I was scared to death when I saw
:22 1/5 (for a quarter) and :44 3/5 (for a half). They're
vulnerable at 7 furlongs. I hope she never has to go :44 3/5 again.
The race set up for a horse to come off the pace.'' Chilukki's
sire, Cherokee Run, was an outstanding racehorse, but he was a
miler at best. Questions about Chilukki's ability to handle a
distance of ground will remain until she proves otherwise . . . The
Pacific Classic was the final event in the 11-race NTRA Champions
series, which began when Malek won the Donn Handicap at Gulfstream
Jan. 30. Partly because of the injury problem, and partly because
the bonus system is convoluted and ill-concieved, the series went
out with a whimper. Behrens, the only one to win two events (the
Oaklawn Handicap and the MassCap at Suffolk), took the series with
46 points, but he did not earn any bonus money because a horse has
to run in the Pacific Classic to get a bonus. The Behrens camp
declined to ship their horse cross-country. By contrast, General
Challenge, who had 20 points, earned a $100,000 bonus in his series
debut. The farther along the series went, the less it seemed to
matter. Changes are needed.

of a maintenance work,'' said trainer Todd Pletcher. ``I've got the
horse to beat. I respect all the horses that go up against him,
though.'' A son of Southern Halo, More Than Ready captured the
Tremont at Belmont and the Sanford at The Spa, and could be the

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Most pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies strive to
develop drugs to treat patients who suffer from such widespread
diseases as cancer, diabetes, or arthritis. The goal is to reach as
many people as possible and create the kinds of treatments that can
generate steady profits for years.
</P>
<P>
   But Genzyme Corp. of Cambridge, Mass. is taking a different tack
_ and in the process is proving that drug companies do not have to
focus primarily on major illnesses to make big returns.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme's decision to concentrate on lesser-known illnesses
started in 1991 when it received government approval to market its
first drug, Ceredase, which treats Gaucher disease, a rare disorder
of the spleen and liver. The company expected that between 1,000 to
1,500 patients would use the drug.
</P>
<P>
   ``We thought we had, at best, a $200-million-a-year drug,'' said
Genzyme president Henri Termeer. But sales have more than doubled,
hitting $411 million in 1998, while the number of patients
suffering from the disease has almost tripled this decade.
</P>
<P>
   The total number of patients using the drug is still very small,
but a year's supply of Ceredase can run $170,000, nearly all of
which is covered by medical insurance programs.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Ceredase prompted Genzyme to begin work on six
more drugs to treat other rare genetic disorders. Termeer declined
to discuss the pricing of the drugs, two of which are expected to
gain US Food and Drug Administration approval next year.
</P>
<P>
   Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, a Wall Street investment firm that tracks
drug and biotech companies, believes that the new drugs will be
priced between $50,000 and $100,000 a year per patient. It bases
those estimates on the amounts its says Genzyme will have to charge
to cover the high costs of developing drugs for rare diseases while
maintaining industry profit margins.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, the unusually high cost of Ceredase and
expectations that the company's new medications will be equally
expensive are raising concerns about placing new burdens on a
health care system already under pressure to keep down costs.
</P>
<P>
   ``No insurer will be bankrupted by an item that is
extraordinarily expensive and applies to very few people,'' said
Dr. Joseph Gerstein, medical director of Tufts Health Plan in
Waltham, Mass.. ``But as more rare diseases get major treatments
that are expensive, just who pays will become a societal issue.''
</P>
<P>
   At some point, Gerstein said, the federal government may have to
help subsidize the cost of such drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme came under attack for its high pricing from some members
of Congress when Ceredase was approved by the FDA. The company has
countered by arguing that while the drug is very expensive, it has
allowed many patients with Gaucher disease to lead normal lives,
eliminating expensive hospital stays.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the company says, Ceredase has opened the door
to creating drugs for treating other genetic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   ``These treatments for these rare diseases would not have been
developed were it not for our success with Gaucher disease,'' said
Dr. David P. Meeker, Genzyme's senior vice president of medical
affairs. Wall Street expects sales of the successor to Ceredase to
climb to $480 million this year, with nearly 2,700 patients using
the drug worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Some inherited diseases, including Gaucher, are caused by the
lack of a naturally occurring body enzyme, and can lead to
disfigurement and death. Children born with Pompe, for example, a
muscle degeneration disorder, often die within two years, because
no medical treatment is available. Genzyme is working with a
pharmaceutical company in the Netherlands that has developed a
replacement enzyme using rabbit's milk.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Genzyme acquired Peptimmune Inc., a small Cambridge
company that has developed a treatment for the estimated 5,000 to
10,000 people worldwide afflicted with an inherited disease called
Pemphigus Vulgaris, fatal blistering on gums and skin.
</P>
<P>
   One of the rarest diseases Genzyme is targeting is Fabry, which
affects about 2,000 men whose bodies cannot produce an enzyme
called alpha-galactosidase. Without it, fatty deposits build up in
blood vessel walls, causing intense pains in the hands and feet.
Left untreated, Fabry can lead to kidney failure and, in some
cases, heart attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Like his grandfather, Jack C. Johnson, a 36-year-old computer
programmer in Kansas City, Mo., has Fabry disease, and remembers
the worst pain attacks came as a teenager. He still gets periodic
pains in his legs and arms if he sweats from overexertion or stays
in the sun too long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I generally stay indoors, which means I don't get to watch my
5- and 8-year-old sons practice baseball or do other outdoors
sports, so I all I can do is take them and drop them off _ I miss
that,'' said Johnson, who runs the Fabry Support and Information
Group.
</P>
<P>
   Genzyme has developed a replacement enzyme and is midway through
pivotal phase III clinical testing. It hopes to gain FDA approval
next year. Termeer would not discuss details of the clinical trials
because Genzyme is competing with Transkaryotic Therapies Inc. of
Cambridge, which has developed a comparable drug.
</P>
<P>
   Both will be seeking so-called Orphan Drug status, which would
give the company that obtains FDA approval first a seven-year
period of US market exclusivity.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson, a participant in Genzyme's phase II clinical trial,
said he felt better after taking the experimental drug twice a
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel positive about the Genzyme drug, although I'm concerned
about how insurers will deal with this,'' he said. ``There is
always the possibility of not being able to get insurance or being
dropped by insurance companies.''
</P>
<P>
   But analysts believe that Genzyme is on the right track and that
its strategy of developing drugs for rare diseases will win the
support of most insurers, since the affected patient groups are
small.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of the severity of the diseases, such expensive
treatments may be justified from a cost effectiveness standpoint,''
said Meg Malloy, senior biotech analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.

STOCK DARLINGS DON'T DARE TO DISAPPOINT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN SYRE AND CHARLES STEIN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shoot first, ask questions later.
</P>
<P>
   That investment mentality has croaked hundreds of little public
companies with big ambitions but a whiff of disappointment. These
days, even much larger growth stocks are facing a similar threat in
a changing stock market.
</P>
<P>
   What's new? Investors who worry over the direction of interest
rates don't want to be around any company that might disappoint on
the market's other key priority: profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an earnings-driven market now,'' said Sly Marquardt,
research director at John Hancock Funds. ``Investors can't rely on
interest rate declines. They're looking for good earnings plays and
when they're disappointed they are very unforgiving.''
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes it hurts even when investors believe a company could
disappoint them.
</P>
<P>
   Two cases in point: State Street Corp. of Boston, the banking
company that makes its money as recordkeeper to the investment
world, and Staples Inc. of Westborough, Mass., the famed
office-supply retailer.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies have spectacular long-term track records but are
getting hammered in the stock market. Staples stock is down 31
percent since July 2. State Street shares are down by the same
percentage since July 6.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasts of a possible slowdown ahead, not any actual business
screwups, are behind the slumps.
</P>
<P>
   Staples was the second most actively traded stock on Wall Street
Tuesday, trailing only Dell Computer Corp. The news: competitor
Office Depot Inc. had warned the day before that
slower-than-expected sales were going to translate into earnings
significantly below forecasts. Staples shares fell a further 3/16,
closing at 21 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Analyst Aram Rubinson of PaineWebber cut his recommendation on
Staples stock from ``buy'' to ``attractive'' Tuesday, reflecting a
broad stock market perception that Office Depot's problems could
spill into Staples stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's all association, but some of it is founded,''
Rubinson said of the Staples stock slump. ``Staples on its own is
doing nothing but executing its business to a tee, but there are
some other dynamics that may eventually affect the industry as a
whole.''
</P>
<P>
   The argument: Office Depot is pushing to open too many new
stores to revive sales in an industry that arguably suffers from
too much competition already.
</P>
<P>
   ``That means more new stores we don't need,'' said Rubinson.
``That's not good for anybody.'' He worries Office Depot's
expansion may hurt Staples's business beginning this fall, then
more forecfully next year.
</P>
<P>
   This is not a new argument, simply one fueled with an additional
jolt of reality Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Early this month, a report by analysts at Donaldson, Lufkin &AMP;
Jenrette fretted over much the same thing. They identified Office
Depot and OfficeMax Inc. as industry weak spots but also warned a
malaise could spread to Staples's stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are concerned that continued sluggish performance at the
other two chains will keep Staples's relative (stock
price-to-earnings) multiple from expanding,'' the DLJ report said.
</P>
<P>
   Staples executives insist their growth strategy has legs. They
point to expansion of services in existing stores, continued growth
of their small-business customer base, and the company's growing
franchise in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   As for actual performance, they will tell you to check out
Staples's 8 percent same-store sales growth in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   State Street stock has been under pressure ever since the
company reported quarterly profits that rose, but not by as much as
expected, in mid-July. The second-quarter profits, up 14 percent,
prompted a notable stock-rating reduction by PaineWebber analyst
Ruchi Madan and sent State Street shares tumbling that day.
</P>
<P>
   The decline, which seemed to level off through August, resumed
last week and has trimmed more than $11 per share from State
Street's stock in just over a week. The stock finished at 59 7/8
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a feeling it may not be an aberration and we may have
soft numbers in the third and fourth quarters,'' said analyst
Gerard Cassidy of Tucker Anthony.
</P>
<P>
   State Street stock was hurt several different ways by interest
rate concerns. Besides the usual impact on fast-growth stocks, rate
worries hit State Street because a weaker market would hurt its
investment management clientele.
</P>
<P>
   ``In good times when markets are roaring, they have the benefit.
Now it's vice versa,'' said Cassidy.
</P>
<P>
   State Street executives insist the impact of a stock market
decline on its business is usually overestimated. They said an
internal review conducted in 1997 suggested a 10 percent decline in
stock market values would depress State Street's revenues by about
2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any time there's any bad news around a growth stock, people
take that information and magnify it many times over,'' said Ron
O'Kelley, State Street's chief financial officer. ``The fundamental
factors for our growth are still there and we continue to execute
well.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Kelley was in New York Tuesday visiting with institutional
investors who own State Street stock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of them are asking us what's changed,'' he said.
``Frankly, we have a lot of diffculty telling them.''

   Is Kohlberg Kravis Roberts &AMP; Co. preparing to become a former

for sale without further regulatory action. KKR, which acquired the
stock when Duracell International was sold to Gillette in 1997, is
said to have no interest in selling at the moment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Once not so long ago, before the Internet created a flood of
investments in high-tech companies, another sector was all the
rage.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1991, and young biotechnology firms were attracting
millions from venture capitalists who rushed to back the startups,
betting that the therapeutic drugs they were developing would one
day generate huge profits.
</P>
<P>
   But many companies, founded on one or two research ideas, were
crippled after their products failed to win government approvals.
The boom became a bust.
</P>
<P>
   Now, nearly a decade later, the biotech industry, after a period
of intense and often painful consolidation, is slowly making a
comeback on Wall Street.
</P>
<P>
   Stock prices of established firms like Biogen have nearly
doubled since January. And shares in younger firms with promising
products, including LeukoSite Inc. and Cubist Pharmaceuticals Inc.,
have soared.
</P>
<P>
   ``Stocks in the top-tier biotech companies are red hot, because
at the end of the day, investors are beginning to see pipelines of
promising new health care products that are safe, will improve
people lives, and make a profit,'' said Richard A. van den Broek,
senior biotechnology analyst at Hambrecht &AMP; Quist.
</P>
<P>
   Pharmaceutical giants, which are under pressure to create
breakthrough drugs rather than new versions of old therapies, are
acquiring biotech firms or striking development and distribution
deals with them. That strategy has also pushed up biotech stock
prices.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Johnson &AMP; Johnson agreed to pay $4.9 billion for
Centocor Inc., the maker of heart drug ReoPro. In June, Alza Corp.,
the largest maker of sustained-release drugs, fetched a whopping
$7.3 billion from Abbott Laboratories. In May, Warner-Lambert paid
$1.9 billion for Agouron Pharmaceuticals Inc., a maker of the AIDS
drug Viracept.
</P>
<P>
   ``These and other recent investments by pharmaceutical companies
seemed to be triggers for investors figuring that if drug companies
think there is value here, than we should take a look and rotate
money into the biotech sector,'' said David K. Stone, managing
director of Liberty Tree Advisors LLC of Acton, Mass., a biotech
consulting firm, who expects the biotech rally to contine for at
least six month to a year.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the new interest in biotech companies is not expected to
come close to 1991 levels. In the first half of this year, a total
of $58.5 million was invested in 13 New England biotech companies _
the second lowest amount in five years, according to The Boston
Globe/Pricewaterhouse Coopers Money Tree survey.
</P>
<P>
   ``After 1991, I am not sure whether the venture capital
community should be ashamed or proud for having created so many
companies, most of which did not do well,'' said Jean-Francois
Formela, general partner at Atlas Ventures of Boston. ``We still
see opportunities for new biotech companies, but investing in the
Internet is more appealing because it requires far less money and
there is strong investor interest on Wall Street.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least Wall Street has stopped ignoring biotech. In recent
years, many investors have avoided the industry altogether because
of the inherent risk in determining which firms would be successful
in bringing new drugs to market.
</P>
<P>
   Often, drugs that showed promise in animal testing either failed
or proved no better than existing drugs in pivotal clinical trials
that involved patients across the country. One clear sign of the
perilous nature of biotech is that of the 350 publicly traded
biotech companies, only 20 are profitable.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many Internet companies don't make any money either.
Indeed, the Internet investment boom is similar to the biotech
frenzy of 1991: lots of ``me-too'' companies with no signs of
profitability rushing to Wall Street to cash in on the the on-line
mystique that has created overnight sensations like Amzaon.com, the
Internet bookseller.
</P>
<P>
   But biotech remains a riskier investment than the Internet,
since most companies need six to 10 years to develop and thoroughly
test therapeutic drugs before seeking FDA approval, a process that
can cost hundreds of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Before it was acquired by American Home Products Corp.,
Cambridge-based Genetics Institute Inc. reportedly spent $200
million during the 10 years it took to market its first
FDA-approved product, a genetically engineered drug used to replace
the missing blood clotting element for men with hemophilia.
</P>
<P>
   Internet-based companies, by contrast, face few government
restrictions, a product cycle as short as six months, and a smaller
cash requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Predictably, the failure of many biotech firms has led to an
industry-wide consoldiation.
</P>
<P>
   More than two dozen Massachusetts biotech companies have
disappeared over the last five years. Some, including Alpha-Beta
Technology Inc. and Ergo Science Corp., closed after their only
products failed to win FDA approval. Others, such as OraVax Inc.,
simply ran out of money after their first products failed and were
acquired for their promising technology or for other drugs under
development.
</P>
<P>
   In August one of the biggest biotech failures, ImmuLogic
Pharmaceutical Corp., a 12-year-old developer of allergy vaccines,
was dissolved. Stockholders divided $40 million in remaining cash,
each receiving $1.94 per share _ a fraction of the more than $23 a
share the company traded at 7 1/2 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   The consolidation has left investors able to focus on the
healthy survivors, mature and well-managed companies, including
industry leaders Amgen, Genentech, Genzyme, Biogen, Immunex, and
Cephalon, all with product pipelines and profits.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the past six months, we've seen a renewed focus by Wall
Street on biotech and how it fits in with the pharmaceutical
industry,'' said Henri Termeer, president of Cambridge-based
Genzyme Corp., which hit a 52-week high of 62 1/16 last Tuesday,
one day after Biogen reached an all-time high of 80 3/4.
</P>
<P>
   Similarly, investors are running up the prices of smaller
companies that are poised to introduce drugs or to be acquired.
Last week, shares of Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., which developed
Agenerase, an AIDS drug, climbed 30 percent in one day to nearly
33, amid speculation that it might be acquired. The Cambridge
company's extensive pipeline of promising drugs, along with
financial deals with major pharmaceutical companies, has made it
one of the most cash-rich biotech firms in New England.
</P>
<P>
   For smaller companies, such as Cubist Pharmaceuticals and
LeukoSite, investor interest is a recent phenomenon. Both have
promising products headed for FDA review, and extensive agreements
with major pharmaceutical companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors and management are trying to focus biotech companies
on delivering products and revenue, not just sexy technology,''
said Scott M. Rocklage, Cubist president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Cubist shares have nearly tripled since January, a result of its
research collaboration with Merck &AMP; Co., Novartis Pharma AG, and
Bristol-Myers Squibb Co., to develop drugs to treat bacterial and
fungal infections, which affect over 30 million Americans and are
the third leading cause of death.
</P>
<P>
   Cubist is also in the final stage of testing Daptomycin, its
internally developed antibiotic for use against bacteria that is
resistant to the strongest available drugs. Cubist developed
Daptomycin in response to the deaths of four children in Minnesota
and North Dakota from a drug-resistant strain of the staphylococcus
aureus germ.
</P>
<P>
   LeukoSite has signed a $30 million agreement with German drug
distributor Schering AG to market its drug Campath, which treats
patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the most prevalent form
of adult leukemia, which affects about 120,000 patients in the
United States and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Campath, which the FDA is expected to review next year, is part
of a series of therapeutics LeukoSite is developing. Part of its
drug pipeline comes from a pair of Cambridge biotech companies _
ProScript Inc. and CytoMed Inc. _ that LeukoSite acquired earlier
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors seem to like the acquisition strategy: LeukoSite
shares have doubled this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``LeukoSite would not have made it to the radar screen of most
investors three years ago,'' said van den Broek of Hambrecht &AMP;
Quist. ``But it does now.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   LATHAM, N.Y. _ Plug Power, a developer of an alternative energy
source, has decided to fuel its next stage of development with the
sale of stock to the public.
</P>
<P>
   The Latham-based start-up company has asked the Securities and
Exchange Commission for permission to sell as much as $117.3
million in stock. The company intends to trade on the Nasdaq
exchange under the symbol ``PLUG.''
</P>
<P>
   Proceeds from the sale will used in development of fuel cells
that use hydrogen to make electricity in a process that promises to
be cleaner and safer than current energy sources. Fuel cells have
generated interest as the country undergoes deregulation of its
electricity industry, opening up markets for nonutility companies
trying to deliver power to homes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it remains to be seen how consumers will ultimately
respond to fuel cells, said Peter Tertzakian, senior energy analyst
for Canadian investment banking firm Goepel McDermid.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's going to drive a stock like Plug Power? Deregulation,
technology change and then on top of that, there has to be customer
acceptance of a new way of generating power in your house,''
Tertzakian said.
</P>
<P>
   Two-year-old Plug Power plans to have a dishwasher-size,
$3,000-$5,000 fuel cell unit for use in homes on the market by
2001. Plug Power officials have said the worldwide fuel cell market
is expected to grow from $500 million a year in 2001 to $3 billion
in the span of a few years.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power's preliminary filing with the SEC does not state how
many shares it wants to sell or the expected price range per share.
That information is expected to be included in a later filing.
Company President Gary Mittleman declined comment on the stock
offering, citing securities regulations that silence company
officers during a so-called ``quiet period'' before a stock
offering hits the street.
</P>
<P>
   To date, Plug Power stock has been available only through
private offerings, not to the general public. In addition to the
$117.3 million the company could raise through the offering, it
will get another $88.9 million boost from current stockholders who
have agreed to exercise various purchase agreements for company
stock at set prices, prior to the public offering. Those
stockholders include the companies that founded Plug Power _
Colonie-based Mechanical Technology Inc. and Edison Development
Corp., an affiliate of the Michigan utility Detroit Edison. Edison
Development owns 38.2 percent of Plug Power, and MTI owns 37.8
percent. Their stakes are bound to be diluted after more investors
purchase shares in the company.
</P>
<P>
   The third largest shareholder of Plug Power is now the General
Electric Co., with a 14.5 percent stake. Plug Power and
Schenectady-based GE Power Systems have formed a joint venture, GE
Fuel Cell Systems, to market the company's fuel cells. GE Power
Systems owns 75 percent of the company, and Plug Power owns 25
percent. GE Power Systems President Robert Nardelli has agreed to
join Plug Power's board of directors after the stock offering is
completed.

<P>

</P>
<P>
   In its SEC filing, the company notes some potential risks for
investors. Among them are lack of a product until 2001, anticipated
losses through 2003, dependence on GE Fuel Cell Systems for
marketing, intense competition and an inability to predict the
actual market for fuel cells.
</P>
<P>
   As a development-stage company with no product yet on the
market, Plug Power has lost $30.3 million since its startup in June
1997. Still, Tertzakian said, investors have shown interest in fuel
cells, at least in Canada.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that stock in Ballard Power Systems of Vancouver,
British Columbia, a Plug Power competitor that offered stock to the
public several years ago, is now trading at $30.31 (U.S.) per
share.
</P>
<P>
   The price reflects a slight decline in recent months, due to a
downward trend among technology stocks, but overall Ballard's stock
has done well for shareholders, Tertzakian said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of momentum behind fuel cells, and you'll be
seeing more and more of it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Plug Power's potential has already buoyed the stock price of
MTI, even though MTI has taken hits on its earnings due to the
investment. MTI's stock was trading for under $2 a share before
launching the Plug Power venture in June 1997; Monday, its stock
closed at $29.75 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Goldman, Sachs &AMP; Co. is the lead underwriter for Plug Power's
offering. Other underwriters are Hambrecht &AMP; Quist, Merrill Lynch &AMP;
Co., and FAC/Equities, a division of First Albany Corp.
FAC/Equities owns 34 percent of MTI.

SPIN'S WINNING DISCS; AGAINST SPECIESISM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The September Spin offers up an early entry in what will soon be
a mad glut of best-of lists _ best of the year, best of the decade,
best of the century, best of the millennium. Sure, these honor
rolls are subjective, incendiary little beasts, but they do have a
valuable purpose in our age of too much information: They give a
sense of order to the increasingly chaotic world of entertainment,
to the zillions of albums, music genres, Hollywood and indie films,
TV shows, Internet sites, and celebrity ``moments'' that just keep
rolling on by.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine presents us with the 90 greatest albums of the
'90s, which is either an honest attempt to map out the decade or
just another excuse to put Kurt Cobain on the cover and pull out
the voice-of-a-generation lingo. Naturally, ``Nevermind'' tops the
pile, with Public Enemy's ``Fear of a Black Planet'' at No. 2, PJ
Harvey's ``To Bring You My Love'' at No. 3, and Beck's ``Odelay''
at No. 4. It does seem a little misguided to rate albums as the
greatest without allowing time to pass, for time is the greatest
test. But in the meantime, what's your everyday average
Zeitgeist-chasing magazine to do?
</P>
<P>
   &QL;

 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harper's asked five poets to bring a poem to dinner at the
Algonquin Hotel in New York. A transcipt of the conversation and
the poems is featured in the September issue, in a rich piece
called ``How to Peel a Poem.'' For offhand philosophies and
profound asides, you can't do better than listening to poets talk
about the minuscule details of poems, especially this clever crew _
Heather McHugh, Donald Hall, Paul Muldoon, Cynthia Huntington, and
Charles Simic, who says he chose a plain poem, ``the kind of poem
cats and dogs could understand.'' There's lots of celebration of
what Hall calls the ``mouth-joy'' of poetry, as well as plenty of
terrific, specific explication of the five poets' choices _
``During Wind and Rain'' by Thomas Hardy, ``The Taxis'' by Louis
McNeice, ``Music'' by Frank O'Hara, ``Traveling Through the Dark''
by William Stafford, and ``The Lake Isle'' by Ezra Pound. The most
interesting analysis may be of the O'Hara poem, during which Simic
notes, ``All lyric poems are narcissistic. They are the earliest
form of personal ad.''
</P>
<P>
   The Readings section of Harper's features a poetry-minded
transcipt, too, this one from a July 1 broadcast of ``The
Connection,'' our own Christopher Lydon's radio talk show. Callers
were invited to read their haikus on the air and process them with
poet Robert Hass, and the Harper's snippet follows Hass's
interpretation of this image: ``Terrible lizard made of tiny
plastic parts. He is broken. Drats.'' An homage to ``Jurassic
Park,'' perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   If you haven't heard about Peter Singer, The New Yorker for
Sept. 6 profiles the controversial Australian ethicist who is
joining the faculty of Princeton University this month. Singer
believes that our ethics about the sacredness of human life in
regard to euthanasia and infanticide is outdated, and that our
common view of animal rights is ``speciesist.'' He believes, in the
words of writer Michael Specter, ``that a human's life is not
necessaily more sacred than a dog's, and that it might be more
compassionate to carry out medical experiments on hopelessly
disabled, unconscious orphans than on perfectly healthy rats. . . .
When Singer says that you are more likely to do moral harm by
killing a healthy cow than by killing a severely handicapped
infant, he means that the cow is more likely to anticipate pain and
suffer from it than would the child.''
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Princeton is under attack by a number of different
factions for hiring Singer (the university has had to take
``elaborate measures to insure Singer's safety''), and picketing by
a group called Not Dead Yet is expected to resume with the fall
semester.

IN `CHILL FACTOR,' GOODING IS GOING FROM BAD TO WORSE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
CHILL FACTOR 
Directed by: Hugh Johnson 
Screenplay by: Drew Gitlin and Mike Cheda 
Starring: Cuba Gooding Jr., Skeet Ulrich, Peter Firth, David
Paymer, Hudson Lieck, Kevin J. O'Connor, Daniel Hugh Kelly 
Running time: 105 minutes 
Rated: R (violence and language) 
Star rating ! 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   There is at least one thing to be said for ``Chill Factor,'' the
new so-called action thriller starring Cuba Gooding Jr. It's where
Gooding's recent string of bad script choices bottoms out. With
``Chill Factor,'' Gooding arrives at the coveted
nowhere-to-go-but-up mode. One can understand that he chose to do
the gorgeous-looking but dramatically pallid ``What Dreams May
Come'' to work with Robin Williams and followed that up with
another misfire, ``Instinct,'' to work alongside Anthony Hopkins.
But why he chose to do ``Chill Factor,'' where he stars opposite a
cannister of frozen toxic chemicals, is a mystery.
</P>
<P>
   The gimmick _ and in ``Chill Factor'' whatever isn't a gimmick
is a cliche _ is a lethal scientific six-pack, code-named Elvis,
presumably so the characters can make bad jokes about Elvis leaving
the building. It contains a super-defoliant that will shrivel
anything within a 500-mile radius if it heats up beyond 50 degrees.
It did once, in 1987, during a test on a remote island. The ensuing
carnage resulted in an army troop commander being jailed for 10
years and David Paymer's scientist in charge, the real culprit,
walking because the army needed him. At the end of the 10 years,
Peter Firth's just-released colonel is not filled with love for his
fellow man.
</P>
<P>
   He's focused and he means to get even not only with the
scientist, but with the country he feels betrayed him. So he and
his minions start chasing Elvis, which the scientist passes off to
his fishing buddy, Skeet Ulrich's short-order cook. He, in turn,
enlists the aid of Gooding's thief, who just happens to show up in
the neighborhood with a stolen but refrigerated ice cream truck
they need to keep Elvis cool until they can return it to the army.
What ensues is mostly chase stuff, as the angry colonel and his
ninja commandos chase the two guys in the ice cream truck through
some spectacular Utah topography.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chill Factor'' would be easier to take if it was anything more
than a bunch of dumb and dumber chase stuff. Ulrich plays a
watered-down James Dean rebel, the kind of loner nobody
understands, especially the local cops, but who's loaded with
integrity all the same.
</P>
<P>
   Gooding plays the worst role I've ever seen him play in a movie.
His larcenous hero named Arlo spends most of his time driving the
truck and overreacting to the stuff Ulrich's character is cool
about.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he perpetuates a kind of black stereotype that
should have become history years ago, but which, to judge by
Gooding's character in this movie and LL Cool J's easily flustered
kitchen worker in ``Deep Blue Sea,'' is as hard to kill as any
cinematic shark.
</P>
<P>
   Gooding has nobody to blame but himself for this one. What can
he have seen in a role whose every other line consists of him
saying, ``Oh, (expletive deleted)!'' while the white guys have all
the fun blowing stuff up?

 By PETER J. HOWE  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MANCHESTER, N.H. _ Millions of Americans want to be able to make
wireless phone calls anytime, anywhere. But even more Americans
hate living near or even looking at cellular phone antennas.
</P>
<P>
   Taking on that paradox, a small company here called Transcept
Inc. thinks it could make $100 million a year.
</P>
<P>
   Transcept, spun off from Lockheed Martin Co. in late July with a
$17 million infusion from a New York investment house, sells
systems that replace 100-foot cell towers with devices about the
size of a toolbox that hang off telephone and utility lines.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 or 12 of the boxes, connected to upgraded cable
television lines or fiber-optic cables, can replace a cell tower
that might cost $350,000 or more to install, but at a 20 to 30
percent lower cost both for installation and maintenance, according
to Transcept president Steven J. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think this is a $100 million business five years out. We
are selling a revolutionary product,'' said Johnson, who thinks
doubling sales every year in that time is a realistic goal.
Privately held Transcept does not release revenue figures, but
industry analysts estimate current annual sales at less than $20
million.
</P>
<P>
   With an estimated 70 million Americans using cell phones and
33,000 more signing up every day, wireless companies are under
intense pressure to fill coverage gaps and add service to meet
demand in heavily traveled areas. The extraordinary value attached
to cell towers was underlined last month when Boston-based American
Tower paid more than $380,000 apiece for 2,100 Vodafone AirTouch
PLC towers around the United States.
</P>
<P>
   But throughout New England and elsewhere, a backlash against
unsightly cell towers _ and largely unproven but hard-to-quash
fears they are a health risk _ has led zoning authorities to
sharply tighten siting rules.
</P>
<P>
   Transcept's devices include a box of electronics and three
antennas about the size and shape of a '60s lava lamp, which can
serve wireless phones in a radius of about 1,800 to 3,500 feet.
Each unit connects by wire _ or in one version by microwave _ to a
base station that handles call connections and the handoff of calls
from one cell site to another to maximize reception.
</P>
<P>
   So far Transcept has sold its devices to Sprint PCS for a system
serving Greater San Diego and to WirelessNorth for systems in
Duluth, Minn., and Superior, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   The company is doing field trials in a Midwestern city it
declines to identify, and is also developing a system by which one
base station would serve multiple roadside towers by microwave
links. That reduces the need for rain-tight sheds with
$200,000-plus of electronics at every tower site.
</P>
<P>
   Transcept's devices can hook into fiber-optic cables strung
along poles or laid underground, or they can be connected to cable
TV networks that have been upgraded to 750 megahertz service, such
as MediaOne systems with RoadRunner fast Internet access.
</P>
<P>
   But the 50-person firm, located near the Manchester airport, is
facing an uphill fight persuading traditionally tower-oriented
wireless companies to give its technology a shot.
</P>
<P>
   One key hurdle, Johnson acknowledges, is that unless the
wireless franchise owner is a cable TV or phone company that owns
its own wires, companies using the product need to strike a deal
with another company to carry part of their network. Wireless
companies commonly lease fiber connections, but are reluctant to
become overly dependent on third parties.
</P>
<P>
   In linking to cable or wireline companies, ``Not only is it a
different party, it's a different industry,'' said Transcept
marketing director Christopher F. Cole.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of opposition to erecting towers, wireless companies
increasingly are striking deals to hide their antennas inside
church steeples or atop water towers. But among wireless engineers,
erecting towers, rather than using Transcept's system, is ``a very
strong paradigm that we are up against,'' said Cole, not to mention
the the usual ``try-it-before-you-buy mentality'' that greets many
new technologies.
</P>
<P>
   All three Transcept installations to date have involved wireless
systems backed by cable TV owners willing to share typically about
1.5 percent of their transmission capacity (after lines were
upgraded) to cover cellular phones.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't have anything at the moment going for us in New
England,'' Johnson said. ``That's unfortunate for us, because there
are certainly major opportunities here.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides being an alternative to towers for new wireless
franchises, Transcept officials see their products being used to
fill in coverage gaps or to overlay an area already covered by
towers where calling demand is so heavy that subscribers' calls get
dropped or fail to go through.
</P>
<P>
   Wireless analyst Mark Zohar of Forrester Research in Cambridge,
who has studied Transcept, said: ``They're not going to take over
the world with this product, but their basic business model makes a
lot of sense as a niche market.''
</P>
<P>
   Given that many US cell networks are nearly built out, Zohar
said, ``The majority of their business will probably be coming from
outside the US, such as in Latin America. A lot of the (domestic)
carriers aren't, frankly speaking, very interested at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Plating, executive vice president and chief operating
officer with Bell Atlantic Mobile, said he was not specifically
familiar with Transcept's products, but said his company has
already made heavy use of ``microcells'' to fill in coverage in
tunnels, shopping malls, and airports.
</P>
<P>
   In tunnels, including those under Boston Harbor and the
Prudential Center, wireless companies have installed what is called
``leaky coax'' _ a coaxial cable that works like a garden soaker
hose to provide coverage over a very short range. Inside, companies
use miniature cells whose ceiling-mounted antennas look like smoke
detectors.
</P>
<P>
   Plating said he was not specifically familiar with Transcept's
products. As far as using dozens of small transmitters as a widely
applied alternative to towers, Plating said: ``It's going to take a
while to get the electronics into play, but if this would do it, we
would be there.''
</P>
<P>
   Transcept was formerly part of Lockheed Martin's Sanders

INTERFAITH GROUP ASSAILS `INFLAMMATORY' VIEW OF HOMOSEXUALITY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIEGO RIBADENEIRA  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   A group of religious leaders that supports gays and lesbians has
accused James Dobson, president of the conservative Focus on the
Family, of disseminating ``false and inflammatory rhetoric'' about
homosexuals through his print ministry and worldwide broadcasts.
</P>
<P>
   The National Religious Leadership Roundtable made the charges in
a letter delivered last week to the powerful evangelical Christian
ministry based in Colorado Springs.
</P>
<P>
   An interfaith organization of about 40 people that formed last
year, the roundtable drafted the letter during a two-day conference
held in Colorado Springs. The group chose the city, which is home
to several conservative Christian organizations, because it wanted
to present a different view of homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   Homosexuality and the role of gays and lesbians in different
faiths has emerged as one of the most contentious issues on
America's religious landscape.
</P>
<P>
   The roundtable's letter states Focus on the Family's
``anti-homosexual campaign leads directly and indirectly to broken
families, to divided churches, and to sufferring and death to God's
lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgendered people.''
</P>
<P>
   The group sought a meeting with Dobson so he could ``hear our
case, and together begin a process of seeking truth about
homosexuality and homosexuals.''
</P>
<P>
   Dobson was on vacation and unavailable for comment. But Amy
Tracy, a spokeswoman for Focus on the Family, said it was unlikely
he would meet with the group because the letter's authors ``have
bashed him all over'' in the past.
</P>
<P>
   ``To say homosexuality is a sin . . . that's not Dr. Dobson _
that's God,'' Tracy told reporters. ``They should take it up with
God because the Bible is very clear that homosexuality is a sin.''
</P>
<P>
   Roundtable leaders said they would not try to persuade Dobson to
change his views on homosexuality, but simply wanted to start a
conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``What we really want is to have a dialogue about this,'' said
the Rev. Nori Rost of Pikes Peak Metropolitan Community Church in
Colorado Springs. ``It's OK if they disagree. No one's asking them
to embrace gays and lesbians or advocate for same-sex marriages.
What we want to see stopped is the dangerous rhetoric that portrays
gays and lesbians as monsters.''
</P>
<P>
   But John Paulk, who says he is a former homosexual and who works
on gay issues for Focus on the Family, challenged Rost's view,
saying the ministry's beliefs are neither incendiary nor false. The
ministry is just trying to counter what Paulk described as an
``aggressive homosexual agenda'' being promoted across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not assaulting the gay community,'' he said. ``We don't
have a campaign against anybody.''

<P>
   --Seeking to calm fears about possible Year 2000 computer
disasters, the American Bankers Association is distributing sample
sermons to ministers nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Bankers are trying to urge clergy to allay fears that Y2K
computer glitches will cripple the country's banking system.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to reach out to the religious community,'' said John
Hall, a spokesman for the trade group.
</P>
<P>
   So the group is distributing the four-page sermon to bankers
who, in turn, can give them to their ministers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to go into the new millennium with hope, eagerness and
faith in this new century of promise,'' the sermon states. ``We
don't want to be crouched in our basements with candles, matches
and guns.''
</P>
<P>
   But at least one minister said he has no plans on using the
sermon.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're treading where angels fear to tread,'' the Rev. Paul
Goodland, an Episcopal priest in Arizona, told reporters. ``Faith
and trust in God is really where it belongs, not in banks.''
</P>
<P>
   --Raising fears of tourist gridlock, Israeli officials say it's
not likely that a second entrance and exit to the crowded Church of
the Holy Sepulcher can be built in time to accommodate the millions
of pilgrims expected to flood Jerusalem to mark the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   While the government wants a second exit for safety reasons, the
Christian denominations that control the church's interior have not
been able to agree on where that exit should be.
</P>
<P>
   Located in Jerusalem's Old City, the church is believed to cover
the sites of Jesus's crucifixion, burial, and resurrection.
</P>
<P>
   --Archbishop Demetrios, who was named this month to replace
Archbishop Spyridon as leader of the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of
America, will be installed Sept. 18 at Holy Trinity Cathedral in
New York City. Spyridon was forced to resign following a two-year
campaign by dissidents who criticized what they described as
Spyridon's authoritarian management style.
</P>
<P>
   --Robert Waldron, who has taught English at Boston Latin School
for 30 years, has recently published two books: ``The Hound of
Heaven at My Heels'' and ``Poetry as Prayer: The Hound of Heaven.''
The first is a reconstruction in diary form of the life of Francis
Thompson, the Victorian poet famous for his poem, ``The Hound of
Heaven.'' The second book explores the relationship between poetry
and prayer.

THE MAN WHO WOULD BE ALREADY ELECTED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID NYHAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The knowledge that we face 51 weeks of hard journalistic
slogging between today and the glorious night when the Republicans
crown their presidential nominee can take the edge off even the
finest end of summer weather.
</P>
<P>
   A whole year, less a week? Can we stand it? Can George W. Bush
stand it? We already detect the predictable backlash against the
Hey-George-did-things-really-go-better-with-coke? business. I can
see this demonizing business spiraling out of control.
</P>
<P>
   From the weathered parapets of The New York Times editorial
page, which has exhibited for years a fascinating preoccupation
with the home life of Clinton &AMP; Clinton, comes this stern
balancing-the-partisan-scales scolding:
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Bush cannot have it both ways on his personal life. He
voluntarily proclaimed his marital fidelity, which is surely the
most private of subjects. That only adds to the impression that he
is hiding something about other aspects of his life.''
</P>
<P>
   What if readers start demanding to know if pundits were
drug-soaked post-adolescents? (Candor compels me to affirm a
relationship with Demon Rum, though my only Coke is diet, to
address the two drugs at issue in the Bush bramble.)
</P>
<P>
   George W.'s breastbeating about how golly-gee faithful he's been
to his wife has been going on for some months now. I thought it was
a mistake then, and now it has boomeranged around to bonk him on
the back of the noggin. It's the mistake most rookies make when
they get to the big leagues. You try and swerve people by talking
about one thing, but that leads you into an area you don't want to
discuss.
</P>
<P>
   Rule No. 1: Never give your enemies a club with which to beat
you. And George W. has handed over a Louisville slugger.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's initial mistake was to start yakking about his personal
morality, in stark contrast to You-know-who's, as a substitute for
not talking about substantive issues. George W. crapped out bigtime
on Kosovo, waffling, weaving, dodging, and ducking, never taking a
position on a life-and-death national issue, till the matter was
decided. He thought he could coast along on his pot of campaign
gold and his party's lust for a nonloser this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't run polls to tell me what to think,'' he harrumped
before the Ames, Iowa, straw poll crowd, which he captured handily
with 31 percent of the vote of those attending. That turned out to
be the most important day of the year for Bush and others, knocking
Lamar Alexander out of the race, neutering Dan Quayle, salting
fool's gold in the ore being mined by Steve Forbes (second place)
and setting up the absent Senator John McCain as the
middle-of-the-road Republican's alternative to Bush in New
Hampshire.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Bush should run some polls to tell him what to think. His
program to date is a bunch of mostly blank pages. He's for the
death penalty, for citizens having the right to carry concealed
handguns, and against taxes. And he calls Greeks ``Grecians.'' Did
I leave anything out?
</P>
<P>
   But vapidity on a vast scale did not prevent him from delivering
a clever speech at Ames. Why clever, when it was so empty? Because
it was in the style of an inaugural speech. That's it, I exclaimed:
George W. is skipping the caucuses, the primaries, the convention,
the acceptance speech, the fall campaign that won't even begin till
a year from now, and he's going right to the inaugural _ that won't
be officially delivered for another 18 months!
</P>
<P>
   When George W. pursed his little lips and narrowed his eyelids
and squinted his best Texas Ranger squint and vowed to uphold the
dignity of this high office, ``so help me God!,'' and ended his
pitch with a heartfelt ``God Bless America!,'' I thought: ``Gee,
what if he really thinks this is all just a formality, and he's
already picking out the drapes for the Oval Office?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush's victory in Ames brought him back onstage for a victory
lap. He was expansive in triumph. There was the down-home modesty
politicians like to put on for the rubes. ``Today we shattered
every record for the Ames Straw Poll . . . we met our expectations,
and we won this straw poll the Iowa way _ neighbor to neighbor.''
Since Bush made only three visits to Iowa, and Lamar Alexander was
there 80 times but finished sixth, one might conclude that
familiarty breeds contempt. Bush winked that ``some pundits said I
had everything to lose,'' but he fixed them city-slicker varmints
now, didn't he?
</P>
<P>
   With his slightly crooked grin, his uncertain platform manner,
and a tendency to repeat his phrases out of nervousness or
uncertainty that's he has not been heard in a cavernous hall, Bush
is not yet any kind of Clintonesque juggernaut at the microphone.
But he was the class of the field that day.
</P>
<P>
   Party conclaves reinforce myths, the way the Russians used to
claim they invented the telephone. In the Ames cattle call, Senator
Orrin Hatch of Utah tried to cop a little limelight-share with
Ronald Reagan. To conservatives, it was their Hollywood-honed
Ronnie who described America's aspiration: ``As President Reagan
said, `Keep America as a shining city on a hill.' ''
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Hatch should know a
copyright violation when he utters one. Some Democrats might think
that line belongs to JFK, who used it to telling effect in the
early '60s. Alas, the pol who originated that phrase was John
Winthrop, governor of the Massachusetts Bay Colony, at a time when,
if we had one man, one vote, the Indians would have been running
everything.
</P>
<P>
   But look where we are today: a chicken in every pot, a desktop
in every den, and a sixgun in every waistband or purse. Be careful
with that pea-shooter, podnah; if we catch ya, we'll hang ya. See
ya.

FROM MONGO TO BOSTON, IN A FLASH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ALEX BEAM  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON IS UNDER ATTACK! That's right, Ming the Merciless has
unleashed his hideous Gorkons on Boston Common, and they are
wreaking havoc from the harbor all the way to Copley Square.
President Clinton has authorized a full-bore aerial attack on
Ming's minions, which gives Flash Gordon just enough to reenter the
space portal and, next week: RETURN TO MONGO!
</P>
<P>
   What brings Flash Gordon riding to the defense of the aptly
named Hub of the Universe, you might ask? For one thing, current
Flash Gordon artist Jim Keefe has an aunt here, and he plans to
draw her a cameo role when the Boston story concludes next month.
But perhaps more important, Boston is the last major city in
America to carry the 65-year-old strip. ``Flash appears in just a
handful of US papers,'' explains Keefe, the ninth in a
distinguished series of ``Flash'' artists. ``Adventure strips are
not as prominent as they used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   What happened? What didn't happen might be a more appropriate
question. Television; ``Star Trek''; ``Star Wars''; declining
newspaper circulation. The great stories that command the attention
of children and adults alike just don't run on the comics pages any
more.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1934, all the great adventure stories ran on the comic
pages, and the powerful King Features Syndicate had a cosmic
problem: His name was Buck Rogers, and he belonged to a competitor.
King decided to vaporize Buck with a Sunday page, featuring two new
adventure stories, both drawn by the legendary Alex Raymond:
``Jungle Jim,'' a knockoff of the popular ``Tarzan'' strip, and
``Flash Gordon.'' King also assigned Raymond a daily strip,
``Secret Agent X-9,'' written by Dashiell Hammett.
</P>
<P>
   The agent and the ersatz ape-man didn't last long, but Flash
caught on. The art was bold, and the stories pitting the ``renowned
polo player and Yale graduate,'' his lady companion Dale Arden, and
scientist pal Dr. Hans Zarkov against Ming, the tyrannical emperor
of Mongo, won Flash a huge following. Within just a few years,
Flash was a multimedia hero, boasting a daily comic strip, a novel,
and three famous movie serials, starring Buster Crabbe as Flash and
Charles Middleton as Ming. There was also a radio program and a
television series.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond quit the strip to join the Marines during World War II,
then returned stateside to place yet another star in the comic
strip firmament: ``Rip Kirby.'' But Flash was well launched into a
life of his own. George Lucas has acknowledged that he borrowed the
famous ``Star Wars'' opening screen crawl (``Once upon a time, in a
galaxy far, far away . . . '') from the movie serial ``Flash Gordon
Conquers the Universe.'' And insiders know that Princess Leia's
honeybun hairdo really belongs to Princess Fria, queen of the
arctic kingdom Frigia, who was once hot to separate Flash from
Dale.
</P>
<P>
   So . . . will Boston survive? ``There's a lot of damage, and the
Common is pretty badly trampled,'' Keefe says from the shelter of
his Long Island home. ``But Boston will be saved.'' And Flash? It
turns out he has quite a following overseas, and King Features has
no plans to decommission him.
</P>
<P>
   Malefactors, beware!

<TEXT>

   PARIS _ The capital of France spawned styles from Gothic to
Cubism, but after World War II it ceded its preeminence in the
contemporary field to New York, and today there are a dozen cities
worldwide that have surpassed Paris in adventurous art. Not that
there isn't plenty of recent work woven into the fabric of this
art-rich city. Finding it, though, was a challenge until the
publication this year of ``France: Contemporary Art (plus)
Architecture Handbook'' (art(bullet)SITES, $19.95) by the San
Francisco-based curator and art historian Sidra Stich.
</P>
<P>
   Without Stich's book, I wouldn't have known that amid the more
conventionally somber sculpture in the Montparnasse Cemetery is
Niki de Saint-Phalle's irreverent tomb statue of a human-sized,
grinning cat, her tribute to a deceased, feline-loving friend. Or
that the blue-on-blue dining room beyond the bar in the Cafe
Richelieu in the Louvre is filled with new art, including
Jean-Pierre Raynaud's frieze of moody indigo photographs of the
stone sculptures of the great and the good on the museum facade.
You can see the real thing out the dining room window, a spooky
effect, especially given that Raynaud's close-up photos make these
cardinals, architects, and scientists look about to start
breathing.
</P>
<P>
   In Paris last week, I ran around the city with Stich's book in
hand, appreciating not only her impeccable directions to obscure
locations, but also her forthright opinions. She's got far more
expertise than your typical guidebook writer, and it shows. On the
subject of the Jeu de Paume, for instance, that long, skinny, 19th
century building just off the Place de la Concorde, originally home
to a ``real'' tennis court, Stich says it's gone downhill. When the
national collection of Impressionist paintings it housed until the
mid-1980s was transferred to the Musee d'Orsay, the Jeu de Paume
became a kunsthalle devoted to daring contemporary shows. But now,
Stich laments, ``the pulse has changed to a more conservative
selection and historic orientation.'' That was certainly true of
the Richard Meier show I saw there, drawings and models of the
white-on-white buildings the famous architect has done worldwide,
its centerpiece a vast model of the Getty Center in Los Angeles.
The model makes the Getty look even bigger than it actually is _
like an entire city.
</P>
<P>
   The French are big on national collections; they see a kind of
glory, patriotism, and pride in forming and housing them in
splendor, an attitude the American government doesn't share. The
stated goal of the National Museum of Modern Art in Paris's
Pompidou Center is typically ambitious: ``to show every art form
that has existed since the beginning of the 20th century in France
and the world.''
</P>
<P>
   The Pompidou, Renzo Piano and Richard Rogers's controversial
``inside-out'' building with the color-coded pipes, tubes,
elevators, and walkways on the exterior, is closed for renovations
until New Year's Eve. What isn't closed, and is well worth a visit,
is the Atelier Brancusi next door. Sculptor Constantin Brancusi
bequeathed his Paris studio and its entire contents to the French
nation, on condition the four rooms be reconstituted just as they
were at his death, in 1957. They were re-created at a couple of
other sites before the Piano-designed building to house them opened
in 1997. It's essentially a glass-walled corridor through which you
see the studio, crammed with sensuous sculptures in marble, wood,
onyx, and polished bronze, soaring birds and saw-toothed totems. To
anyone accustomed to seeing Brancusis one by one, this dense,
forestlike installation comes as a shock. But period photos of the
studio confirm it's the way he wanted his work displayed. His tools
are there, too: pulleys, saws, drills, and sanders, hinting at the
physicality of his process. There's even the guitar he used when
jamming with his pal, composer Erik Satie.
</P>
<P>
   France is fond of single-artist museums, a relatively new
phenomenon in the United States. Paris boasts museums dedicated to
Picasso, Rodin, Delacroix, and others; the Atelier Brancusi is one
of the most idiosyncratic and satisfying, despite Stich's
justifiable complaint that Piano's glass walls sanitize the studio
and distance you from work you yearn to get close to.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Pompidou, Paris's City Museum of Modern Art covers the
20th century. The cavernous spaces of this rather gloomy 1930s
neoclassical pavilion can accommodate the most sprawling works,
including a magisterial version of Matisse's ``La Danse,'' and
Raoul Dufy's giant murals ``La Fee Electricite,'' commissioned by
the Paris Electric Co. for the 1937 International Exposition.
</P>
<P>
   The City Museum's contemporary programming is particularly bold.
Parisian-based Martine Aballea has created an entire hotel in the
galleries, on view through Sept. 19. The doors to some rooms open;
others are locked; all are furnished as sparsely as monks' cells,
and for some reason, the furniture is gilded. It all reads like a
set for a surreal French film.
</P>
<P>
   There's a mysterious, disconcerting emptiness about Aballea's
``Hotel Passager.'' Pipilotti Rist's installation ``Remake of the
Weekend,'' also in the City Museum through Sept. 19, is anything
but empty. It's the apartment of someone who can't throw anything
out, and although the owner isn't there, the place is brought alive
by video images flickering over kitchen cabinets, lampshades, and
sofas.
</P>
<P>
   The most exciting contemporary art I saw, though, was at the
Cartier Foundation for Contemporary Art in Montparnasse, which,
since 1994, has occupied a glass building designed by Jean Nouvel,
as radical in its way as the Pompidou Center. Transparent and
ambiguous, thanks to layers of glass panels that make it seem to
dematerialize, the building is home, through Nov. 14, to a big
millennial show, ``1 Real World.'' Its science fiction theme is
introduced by Rolf Fehlbaum's spectacular collection of toy robots
whizzing along conveyor belts. Continuing in this vein, the Antwerp
artist Panamarenko, a latter-day Leonardo, offers a fantasy flying
machine involving clusters of propellors rising from the shoulders
of a mannequin attired as a pioneer aviator.
</P>
<P>
   Zaire artist Bodys Isek Kingelez creates a utopian city in
``Project for Kinshasa in the Third Millennium,'' a brightly
colored, oddly shaped, exuberant series of buildings constructed of
cardboard and soda cans. And Boston-born, Los Angeles-based Chris
Burden presents a globe gone awry in ``Medusa's Head,'' a huge,
lumpy, suspended ball with railroad tracks and bridges
crisscrossing the surface, sometimes upside down, the disarray
looking like the result of a cataclysmic earthquake.
</P>
<P>
   Paris hasn't been particularly aggressive or adventurous about
public art _ perhaps because the city already has more than its
fair share of monuments _ but one fine example that pays homage to
its stately surroundings is French artist Daniel Buren's ``Les Deux
Plateaux,'' in the column-ringed courtyard of the Palais-Royale.
Buren has added 460 more columns, all in his signature stripes,
black and white in this case. They're fragments, in all different
heights, some reaching underground and viewable through glass.
People walk among them, sit on them, play hopscotch over them.
They're like pieces of a giant board game, or remnants of some
ancient structure that predates the 17th century palace.
</P>
<P>
   I'd visited Notre Dame dozens of times, but, until latching onto
Stich's book, never realized that since 1962 there has been a
Holocaust memorial behind the cathedral. Georges-Henri Pingusson's
``Crypte de la Deportation,'' which commemorates the 200,000 French
Jews deported to Nazi camps, is a sunken, rugged stone prison whose
claustrophobic interior contains little locked cells and, behind
more bars, a long chamber with a coffin shape bearing the
inscription ``here rests an unknown deported.'' The coffin looks
about to slide down the narrow corridor toward a tiny light at the
end, a glimmer of hope. Outside, though, all is bleak. The
memorial, at the east end of the Ile de la Cite, culminates in a
lethal-looking, swordlike sculpture and an iron portal, with a view
of the waters of the Seine beyond. You sense this is where the
prisoners exited, never to return. Like Jerusalem's Yad Vashem or,
for that matter, Boston's Holocaust Memorial, the ``Crypte de la
Deportation'' abstracts an unspeakably horrible subject that
literal treatment might trivialize. It permits an emotional
response rather than dictating one.

A SURPRISE FROM THE FARRELLY BROTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JAY CARR  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE 
Directed by: Michael Corrente 
Screenplay by: Peter Farrelly, Corrente, Bobby Farrelly (based on
Peter Farrelly's novel) 
Starring: Shawn Hatosy, Amy Smart, Alec Baldwin, Jon Abrahams,
Tommy Bone, Jonathan Brandis, Jack Ferver, Adam Lavorgna, Jesse
Leach, Gabriel Mann, Kristen Shorten, Alex Toma, George Wendt 
Rated: R (pervasive teen drug use and strong language, including
sexual references) 
Star Rating: !!! 1/2 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although ``Outside Providence'' comes on the heels of ``Dumb and
Dumber'' and ``There's Something About Mary,'' it predates the
films that made Rhode Island's Farrelly brothers, Peter and Bobby,
their reputation as the kings of zany low-ball comedy. It in fact
stems from a semi-autobiographical coming-of-age novel Peter
Farrelly wrote, and while there's certainly no shortage of comedy
in its story of a working-class kid from Pawtucket packed off to a
tony Connecticut prep school to keep him out of trouble, it's a
sweet and ultimately touching film with more straightforward
humanity and realism than anything else we have seen so far with
the Farrelly name on it. It's a film of modest but solid and
heartfelt attainments.
</P>
<P>
   Part of the reason is that it also bears the name of Michael
Corrente as director and co-screenwriter. Corrente not only has
made a reputation for affecting and handsomely crafted filmmaking
with ``Federal Hill'' and ``American Buffalo,'' but has shown that
he imaginatively moves beyond generic realism to a more
individualized and impassioned brand. If his films are red-blooded,
they're also full-hearted, which is another way of saying that
there's no dumbing down here, no succumbing to teen movie formula.
A tender, gritty honesty pervades ``Outside Providence.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet while you could make a case for regarding it as the
anti-``American Pie,'' it's also cognizant of the fact that, like
real estate, which is driven by location, location, location, teen
comedies are driven by hormones, hormones, hormones. It's those
first surges of testosterone that get Shawn Hatosy's Tim Dunphy
into trouble. When they lead to show-offy drug use and a subsequent
collision with the back end of a police car, Tim's tough
blue-collar father packs him off to boarding school. Nothing much
is said about it, but it's obvious from their less-than-affluent
neighborhood and house, that some sacrifice is involved in sending
Tim there.
</P>
<P>
   And yet he regards it as a prison, with its school blazers and
its rules and class consciousness. Just as service comedies are
about the eternal war between enlisted men and brass, school films
are about the perpetual conflict between students and the adult
authority figures of the faculty and administration. Certainly,
this is played for all it's worth when Tim finds a few ways to
successfully cross the vicious cold fish (Tim Crowe) in charge of
discipline. But the pleasures of ``Outside Providence'' come from
the ways it deviates from genre cliche and supplies freshness and
surprises. It's much closer to a European film in sensibility than
to one of Hollywood's factory products.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Tim isn't a miserable misfit at all, but
integrates quite harmoniously and even serves as a role model for
the obligatory nerd roommate (a convincing Jack Ferver). Even
better, Tim is forced to admit to himself that there's no real
snobbery to contend with, and that the real problem is his own
reverse snobbery, a product of defensiveness. His glorying in this
unexpected egalitarianism peaks when he finds that the patrician
girl who caught his eye (a freshly ingratiating Amy Smart) in fact
reciprocates his feelings. ``Outside Providence'' doesn't tell a
notably original story, but it reinvents a familiar one in very
engaging ways.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a triumph of pitfalls avoided. There's never anything
maudlin about Tim's disabled brother, played by Tommy Bone, nor is
there any attempt to wring pathos from the fact that the boys'
mother is dead. Hatosy fills the role with unforced conviction and
Alec Baldwin is terrific as the boys' clenched and in many ways
narrow but ultimately tender father. Never once does he slip into
an Archie Bunker mode, even though a lesser actor might have;
that's how dangerously close the role veers toward it. The film's
most moving moment doesn't involve any kind of big but overdrawn
emotional scene, but unfolds simply, when the father shows his son
how to knot a tie. Corrente delivers the goods in this film that
shows a hitherto unrevealed side of the Farrelly brothers.

BEST BUY HELPING MUSIC NEWCOMERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By GREG HASSELL 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ When Mary Cutrufello was still earning her paycheck
playing guitar in Jimmy Dale Gilmore's band, a fan approached her
after a show in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   He'd heard her solo set and was impressed. It just so happened
this guy worked at the Minneapolis-based retail giant Best Buy. He
was cooking up a marketing program to promote young artists in
danger of being overlooked by the music industry's hit machine.
</P>
<P>
   Record companies are notorious for spending all their
advertising bucks to boost established stars like Garth Brooks.
Most newcomers have little chance of getting serious promotional
support. But Best Buy's Tom Overby &UR;  &LR; wanted to change that with an
innovative program called Find 'Em First.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't even have a record deal at that time, but I
appreciated his enthusiasm,'' said Cutrufello, the Yale-educated
guitar slinger who moved to Houston to hone her craft in Texas
honky-tonks.
</P>
<P>
   In August 1998, Cutrufello released her first CD, ``When the
Night is Through.'' Overby sent her an e-mail asking if she'd like
to be involved in his marketing brainchild. A week after she
endorsed the plan, Best Buy sent a film crew to a Houston nightclub
and filmed a Cutrufello show.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
ESTABLISHING RECOGNITION &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The commercial cut in Houston premiered on the MTV Video Music
Awards and established a regular presence on VH-1.
</P>
<P>
   ``That Find 'Em First commercial has given me tremendous
national exposure,'' Cutrufello said. ``People immediately began
coming up to me in public in places I'd never even been to before
and saying, `Hey, weren't you in that Best Buy commercial?' When
you're a young artist just trying to get people to match a name
with a face with a sound, you can't imagine how far that sort of
thing goes.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to TV advertising, Find 'Em First has promoted
musicians' careers with promotional billboards, advertising
circulars and big in-store displays. The Best Buy Web site
(www.bestbuy.com) gives updates on Find 'Em First artists,
including biographies, tour dates and free audio downloads. Total
budget for the effort is estimated to be $4 million.
</P>
<P>
   Several other Texas artists have gotten a big boost from Best
Buy. At one point this past year, one out of four CDs by Austin,
Texas-based Kelly Willis were sold at Best Buy. The retailer
estimates sales of David Garza's ``This Euphoria'' spiked 1,500
percent after he was featured in Find 'Em First. Just don't asked
Garza to verify the math.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no idea. I write rock 'n' roll songs,'' he quipped.
``But I can tell you it's a big help. It puts your face on TV until
people get sick of seeing it. When they get sick of seeing it, they
buy the CD. That's how it works in America.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a coincidence, Overby said, but there have been a
disproportionately large number of Texans featured on Find 'Em
First.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas has always had a lot of great artists, but they don't
get played because they don't fit a demographic or a particular
radio format,'' Overby said. ``They are too rock, or too blues or
too country for the mainstream.''
</P>
<P>
   That's been a problem for decades, nagging at Texas twangers as
prominent as Willie Nelson, who had to battle Nashville to release
his landmark concept album, ``Red Headed Stranger.'' He had to
battle the record company again when he wanted to release a record
of old standards. The brilliant ``Stardust'' proved him right by
setting sales records.

NEW ARTISTS NEED A PUSH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The story is so familiar and has been relived by so many others
_ especially country artists playing in the traditional vein of Bob
Wills, Jimmie Rodgers or Lefty Frizzell _ that it's news when they
aren't ignored by the mainstream recording industry.
</P>
<P>
   ``The new artists are the lifeblood of the industry,'' Overby
said. ``They need an extra push. We do it because we are passionate
about music ... We want to send a message to new artists that Best
Buy is your friend.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the retailer hopes to convince the public that
Best Buy is the best place to find great music.
</P>
<P>
   ``It brings people into the store,'' he said. ``Our customers
have responded well to this and told us they love it.''
</P>
<P>
   There is no doubting that Find 'Em First has the grateful
support of the musicians who are enjoying their turn in the
spotlight.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's a pretty amazing thing they are doing. They
aren't asking the record companies to pitch in,'' said Willis,
whose latest record is appropriately titled ``What I Deserve.''
``This is a huge company that could keep its money, but it wants to
help. It is so surprising you ask yourself, `What have I done to
deserve this?'''

   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; When it's time to gather friends for some hanging
out, keep the festivities casual _ and razzle-dazzle guests with
tasty nibbles and cool libations galore. Nothing formal or fancy,
just some fabulous easy appetizers and hors d'oeuvres to tease the
taste buds, stave off hunger _ and even suffice as a light and
informal meal by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   There are plenty of little bites to spark the appetite and greet
party guests, from endless combinations of dips and chips to more
chic fare such as cheese and salmon balls, appetizer cheesecake,
sesame chicken strips, tomato and olive tapenade, brie torte, corn
and shrimp cakes, stuffed mushrooms, Cajun-seasoned pecans, roasted
red pepper spread, hot crab and artichoke spread, tapenade and
more.
</P>
<P>
   We've culled a few tried-and-true favorites, along with
interesting in-vogue ideas that span the globe from some of the
latest cookbooks. Use the ideas included as guidelines and add your
own special creative touches and flavors. If you have the time and
inclination, explore ethnic markets for interesting and different
chips and crackers, or novelties to serve as conversation pieces.
Something like the Taiwanese chips embedded with black sesame
seeds, sampled recently at a Chinese restaurant, would make a tasty
dip accompaniment (available at the 99 Ranch Market on Sepulveda
Boulevard in Van Nuys).
</P>
<P>
   ``Appetizers that taste as good as they look don't have to be
complicated,'' writes Paula Hamilton in ``The 5 in 10 Appetizer
Cookbook.'' In her cookbook, ``A Little Something,'' Susan Epstein
writes that we can indulge in versatile appetizers or nibbles
midmorning or afternoon, at formal or informal cocktail parties,
poolside, in the park, at tea time or early or late in the evening.
</P>
<P>
   Design and gear your appetizer menu to suit the hour of the
party, the appetites of the guests (are they hearty eaters, or do
they prefer lighter fare?), the number expected and your budget.
``Serve gourmet food to gourmets and updated traditional tidbits to
the less adventurous,'' advises Epstein, who was once asked by a
guest _ when she set out a spread of gourmet tidbits _ if she had
any onion soup dip. ``Plan an eating adventure, but have one or two
`life jackets' on hand just in case.''
</P>
<P>
   Strive for balance and variety as well as both cold and hot
appetizers with varied colors, textures and flavors. Consider your
schedule when selecting an assortment of recipes. If you have
limited time to spend, pick the fastest recipes you can find _ and
make them in between appointments or whatever. Or let convenience
or already-prepared foods assist you. Whatever you decide, be sure
you have plenty of eats. Get organized and assemble as many of the
appetizers in advance as possible so you can enjoy your own party.
Fortunately, most appetizers can be prepared in advance and kept
refrigerated a day or two.
</P>
<P>
   If hearty fare is in order, offer items like shelled and
deveined shrimp, thin pizza slices, meatballs, cut-up chicken
pieces or other more substantial finger foods that are easy to eat.
Crab meat on a cucumber or cracker, cut-up bites of cooked fillet
of beef with a mustard dipping sauce, mushrooms filled with pesto
or rolled-up tortilla slices filled with meat, cream cheese and
veggies are other ideas. Even bruschetta on toasted mini cocktail
breads or a platter of shrimp nachos with pineapple salsa are good
options.
</P>
<P>
   Remember _ you don't have to make everything yourself from
scratch. Supermarkets, delis and Trader Joe's offer busy hosts and
hostesses such ready-to-use items as peeled and cut-up fresh fruits
and vegetables, baked pizzas, egg rolls, hummus, cheeses, sliced
salamis, interesting breads and mini rolls, savory pates, cooked
chicken, ribs, smoked or cooked salmon, dips, crackers, chips,
pretzels and much more. Establishments like Smart &AMP; Final and
Costco carry items like jalapeno poppers, mini tacos, mini
burritos, mini quesadillas, mini sausage links, teriyaki skewers,
stuffed eggs, mini quiches, prepared tuna salad, prepared crab
filling, popcorn shrimp, chicken nuggets, mozzarella marinara
sticks, fresh refrigerated salsas, guacamole, baby pizzas, nuts _
and even some sweet things like baby cream puffs and baby eclairs.
</P>
<P>
   If your event is a last-minute affair, pick up platters of
assorted sushi along with shrimp, assorted meats and cheeses,
vegetables, assorted wraps and roll-ups.
</P>
<P>
   Also, you can whip up creations with mostly premade items _ like
turning a wheel of plain brie into a torte with store-bought pesto
and pine nuts _ or wrapping up a dip or spread in a tortilla with
thin sliced sandwich meats and some lettuce leaves and roasted red
peppers. Antipasto platters with roasted peppers, an assortment of
imported green and black olives, marinated artichoke hearts, cherry
tomatoes, salami cornucopias filled with flavored cream cheeses,
caponata and stuffed mini grape leaves topped with a squeeze of
fresh lemon look great on a buffet table, too. It's also feasible
to create cheese straws with cut-up sheets of frozen store-bought
puff pastry dough topped with Parmesan cheese, then twisted and
baked until golden.
</P>
<P>
   Be creative with presentations and offer even the easiest
appetizers with style. Select colorful trays and platters _ even
plastic _ for serving the food poolside. Intersperse fancy and not
so fancy as well as colorful foods with those not as colorful on
the table.
</P>
<P>
   Bigger is usually better when it comes to food displays. You
want fresh fruits and veggies to look impressive. Brightly colored
vegetables can be piled in big lettuce-, kale-, fabric- or
napkin-lined baskets with a bowl or container (use hollowed-out red
or green bell peppers or cabbages or large tomatoes) of dip tucked
in the center or at the side. Also, consider doing food
arrangements on wooden cutting boards or using plastic
wrapped-lined flowerpots (plug the hole in the bottom) _ a large
one for chips and a smaller one for salsa.
</P>
<P>
   Be sure to keep food out of the sun. And replenish often to keep
things fresh-looking. When passing appetizers, serve only one type
at a time to avoid interrupting guests' conversations.
</P>
<P>
   Though a party of appetizers and hors d'oeuvres means finger
foods, provide a stack of little plates and even some forks. And
have plenty of napkins handy _ the more festive the better. Look
for something fun, colorful and decorative at gift and party shops.
</P>
<P>
   Also don't forget to have plenty of trash receptacles, kept as
neat as possible and handy.
</P>
<P>
   Impress your guests with a selection of these creations at your
next gathering. &UR;

   SESAME CHICKEN STRIPS
</P>
<P>
   Chinese hoisin sauce makes a terrific basting sauce for grilled
chicken. Keep a careful eye on these kebabs as they cook. &QL; 
1 pound skinless, boneless chicken breasts &QL; 
3 tablespoons bottled hoisin sauce &QL; 
1 tablespoon cider vinegar &QL; 
1 teaspoon chopped garlic &QL; 
1 1/2 teaspoons sesame seeds
</P>
<P>
   Light a medium-hot fire in barbecue grill, or preheat broiler.
</P>
<P>
   Cut chicken lengthwise into 3/4-inch-wide strips. Thread strips
onto small metal or soaked bamboo skewers.
</P>
<P>
   Combine hoisin sauce, vinegar and garlic. Brush sauce over
chicken. Then sprinkle on sesame seeds, pressing into sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Grill or broil 3 to 4 inches from heat for 3 minutes. Turn
chicken over and grill about 3 minutes longer, until chicken is
white throughout but still moist in center. Serve hot. Makes about
12.

   BRIE TORTE
</P>
<P>
   Here's a quick way to dress up a large wheel of Brie for a
party. You can also use pesto made with basil or cilantro, or even
tapenade (olive paste). If you have a few nasturtiums or other
edible flowers, use them to garnish the serving platter. &QL; 
1 wheel (2.2 pounds) Brie cheese &QL; 
1 1/2 cups sun-dried tomato pesto &QL; 
2/3 cup pine nuts OR slivered almonds
</P>
<P>
   With a long, sharp knife, cut wedge of Brie in half horizontally
and separate two halves. Spread 1/2 of pesto on top of bottom half
of cheese. Cover with other wedge of cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Spread remaining pesto on top and sprinkle on pine nuts,
pressing in slightly.
</P>
<P>
   Serve with crackers or thin slices of toasted country-style
bread. Makes 20 to 24 servings.

   SWEET CORN AND SHRIMP CAKES
</P>
<P>
   Of all the recipes for corn cakes that I've read or tasted, this
is the easiest _ and one of the tastiest. Serve them plain or, if
you like, garnish with a dollop of tart green salsa made from
tomatillos. Thawed frozen corn works well in this recipe. &QL; 
3 cups corn kernels (fresh OR thawed frozen) &QL; 
2 tablespoons flour &QL; 
1 egg &QL; 
1/4 cup whipping cream OR milk &QL; 
1/2 teaspoon salt &QL; 
1/2 cup cooked shelled baby shrimp
</P>
<P>
   Puree 2 cups corn in a food processor. Add flour, egg, cream and
salt, pulse several times to combine. Stir in remaining 1 cup corn
and shrimp.
</P>
<P>
   Heat a nonstick or lightly oiled griddle. Make corn cakes using
1 tablespoon batter for each. Cook in batches over medium-high heat
until bottoms are nicely browned, about 2 minutes. Turn over and
cook other sides until lightly browned, 1 1/2 to 2 minutes longer.
Serve immediately. Makes 6 to 8 servings.

   SWEET AND SPICY PECANS
</P>
<P>
   These crisp bites are irresistible and will disappear when
served as a nibble with cocktails. Don't salt until after tasting,
because each brand of Cajun seasoning includes different amounts of
salt. &QL; 
2 tablespoons butter &QL; 
2 cups pecan halves &QL; 
2 teaspoons Cajun seasoning &QL; 
2 teaspoons sugar &QL; 
Salt to taste
</P>
<P>
   In a medium nonstick skillet, melt butter over medium heat. Add
pecans and cook, stirring often, 1 minute.
</P>
<P>
   Sprinkle Cajun seasoning and sugar over nuts and cook, stirring
constantly, until sugar has melted and nuts are glazed, about 2
minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Transfer pecans to a plate and cool slightly. Taste and season
with salt, if needed. Serve warm or at room temperature. Makes 6 to
8 servings.

   TV-TELETHON-KANSAS (Undated) _ It's time again for the Jerry
Lewis Show.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive me _ ``The Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a trademark Lewis pratfall, it's a seemingly easy slip to
make.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 8 p.m. Sunday the 34th annual Labor Day fund-raiser
for the Muscular Dystrophy Association returns with the serious
task of treating and finding a cure for 40 neuromuscular diseases
that most tragically ravage the bodies of children.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's the patently zany Lewis who remains the show's
singularly captivating draw.
</P>
<P>
   Love him or hate him _ and it's fair to speculate that even
detractors of the slapstick icon tune in just to shake their heads
in amazement at his audience-pandering antics _ Lewis is the
telethon. By BRIAN McTAVISH. 1500 words. Story will move in the
``e'' category.
</P>
<P>
   FOOD-PBJ-KANSAS (Undated) _ It's practically an American icon,
so just how much liberty can you take with a PB&AMP;J?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is it written that this kid's classic must consist of
peanut butter and grape jelly on white bread.
</P>
<P>
   Brad VanAuken, 42, still eats a peanut butter sandwich at least
once a week, but, he says, ``My tastes have become a little more
refined since I was a child.'' By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA. 1700 words.
Story will move in the ``l'' category.

   FOOD-PBJSIDE-KANSAS (Undated) _ Recipes using peanut butter. A

   Chocolate peanut butter roll ups
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup creamy peanut butter
</P>
<P>
   1/3 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1 (3-ounce) package cream cheese
</P>
<P>
   1/2 teaspoon vanilla extract
</P>
<P>
   2/3 cup heavy cream, divided
</P>
<P>
   1/4 pound good-quality bittersweet or semisweet chocolate,
finely chopped
</P>
<P>
   Six (8-inch) flour tortillas
</P>
<P>
   4 tablespoons (1/2 stick) unsalted butter, melted
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder
</P>
<P>
   In the bowl of an electric mixer, cream the peanut butter and
sugar until light and fluffy at medium speed. Add the cream cheese
and vanilla, and beat well. Whip 1/3 cup heavy cream until
medium-soft peaks form, and fold the cream into the peanut butter
mixture until thoroughly combined. Refrigerate 30 minutes or until
slightly firm.
</P>
<P>
   While the mousse is chilling, place the chopped chocolate in a
small mixing bowl. Bring the remaining 1/3 cup cream to a boil in
small saucepan or in a glass measuring cup in a microwave at full
power, and pour it over the chocolate. Stir until melted and
thoroughly combined. Set mixture aside until it is firm enough to
spread; it should have the consistency of cream cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Remove the mousse from the refrigerator. Beat on the lowest
speed of the mixer at least 5 minutes, preferably longer, until
mousse is light and fluffy.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat the oven broiler. Cover a baking sheet with heavy-duty
aluminum foil. Place the tortillas on a counter, and spread a thick
layer of chocolate 3 inches wide in the center of each tortilla,
leaving a 11/2-inch margin on both sides. Place a portion of mousse
at the bottom of each tortilla, below the chocolate. Tuck the sides
in to enclose the filling, and gently roll the tortillas into a
cylinder. Place the tortillas, seam side down, on the baking sheet.
Brush the rolls with melted butter. Combine the sugar and cocoa
powder, and sprinkle the mixture heavily over the rolls.
</P>
<P>
   Broil the rolls 6 inches from the broiler unit 1 to 2 minutes,
or until the sugar on top has melted. Remove the pan from the
broiler, and serve immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Note: The peanut butter and chocolate mixtures can be prepared
up to 1 day in advance and refrigerated, tightly covered. Allow the
chocolate to reach a spreadable consistency before assembling the
dessert. Or the rolls can be prepared for final broiling up to 2
hours in advance and refrigerated.

<P>
   Homemade peanut butter
</P>
<P>
   Makes 11/2 cups
</P>
<P>
   2 cups peanuts
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon peanut oil
</P>
<P>
   Place peanuts in a blender or food processor. Add peanut oil.
Cover and blend on high, scraping the sides and bottom
occasionally. Blend until you have the desired consistency, smooth
or crunchy.
</P>

   Refrigerate any unused portion to keep the nut oils from going
stale. For easier spreading, remove from refrigerator a few minutes
before using. If the oil has separated, just stir the peanut
butter.
</P>
<P>
   Note: Before measuring peanut butter for a recipe, coat your
measuring spoon or spoon lightly in oil.

GOURMET PB&AMP;J 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JILL WENDHOLT SILVA  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's practically an American icon, so just how much liberty can
you take with a PB&AMP;J?
</P>
<P>
   Plenty.
</P>
<P>
   Nowhere is it written that this kid's classic must consist of
peanut butter and grape jelly on white bread.
</P>
<P>
   Brad VanAuken, 42, still eats a peanut butter sandwich at least
once a week, but, he says, ``My tastes have become a little more
refined since I was a child.''
</P>
<P>
   VanAuken enthusiastically ticks off a few of his more
adventurous peanut butter pairings: peanut butter and guava jelly.
Peanut butter and lemon curd. Peanut butter and Nutella, a creamy
European-style, chocolate-hazelnut spread. Peanut butter and
chutney. Peanut butter and pitted dates. Peanut butter and fresh
pineapple slices. Peanut butter and candied ginger.
</P>
<P>
   Some of VanAuken's combinations came together after tasting new
foods on travels to such exotic locales as Belize or Tanzania.
Others spawned from an empty jelly jar.
</P>
<P>
   ``What usually happens is, I have all these snack things around
and just end up mixing them in the peanut butter,'' the Brookside
resident says.
</P>
<P>
   It's that same spirit of innovation that led 26-year-old Lee
Zalben to open Peanut Butter &AMP; Co. His Greenwich Village restaurant
serves 13 different peanut butter sandwiches for $5 to $6 a pop.
</P>
<P>
   ``Basically I ate a lot of peanut butter as a kid,'' Zalben
says. As a college student at Vassar, Zalben and his friends' study
breaks often included contests to create a PB&AMP;J that could be
considered ``gourmet but not too out there.''
</P>
<P>
   At Peanut Butter &AMP; Co., Jif gets one-upped by freshly ground
peanut butters available in a mix of textures and flavors _ crunch
or smooth, spicy or cinnamon-raisin, chocolate chip or white
chocolate chip. Artisanal breads from a bakery stand in for spongy
mass-produced Wonder Bread. In addition to grape jelly, customers
can choose blueberry or cherry jam, raspberry or apricot preserves,
orange marmalade or lemon curd.
</P>
<P>
   On the menu are such classics as the Lunchbox Special, peanut
butter spread with a thick layer of strawberry or grape jam, or the
Fluffernutter, a gooey marriage of peanut butter and Marshmallow
Fluff.
</P>
<P>
   For the more exotic palate there's a spicy peanut butter
sandwich with chilled, grilled chicken and a dab of pineapple jam,
or a Creamsiclelike sandwich of white chocolate peanut butter and
orange marmalade.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've tried to stick to the universally accepted with some
gourmet twists,'' Zalben says.
</P>
<P>
   PB &AMP; crayons
</P>
<P>
   Peanut butter and pickles?
</P>
<P>
   Peanut butter and jalapenos?
</P>
<P>
   Peanut butter, yellow mustard and green peppers?
</P>
<P>
   Ahem. Tom Johnson has learned not to pass judgment on
odd-sounding peanut butter combinations.
</P>
<P>
   More than a year ago Johnson began researching concepts for the
new 122-seat Crayola Cafe, which is scheduled to open in Crown
Center in November. While visiting the Crayola home page at
crayola.com, he uncovered an interesting bit of trivia: the 18th
most-recognized smell in the world is the waxy, paraffin smell of a
crayon. The second most recognized smell is peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   ``As I envision Crayola, it's kind of nostalgic and
family-friendly,'' says Johnson, a managing director for Culinary
Concepts, which is owned by Hallmark. ``Then I thought, `Wow!
Peanut butter has that same kind of appeal.' It was a natural.''
</P>
<P>
   Michael Smith and Debbie Gold, James Beard Award-winning chefs
for the American Restaurant, are known for sophisticated menus that
include such gourmet delicacies as kobe beef and foie gras.
</P>
<P>
   But for the last several months the chefs have been dreaming up
creative PB&AMP;J combos that will appear on the Crayola Cafe menu.
Their renditions include crustless rounds of white bread spread
with peanut butter served with ramekins of jelly, a side of M&AMP;Ms
and raisins plus small skewers of banana and apples; a
double-decker, club-style sandwich with peanut butter, grape jelly,
apple slices and crispy bacon; a chunky peanut butter sandwich with
generous layers of colored mini marshmallows, M&AMP;Ms, sliced bananas,
chopped cashews and peanuts topped off by a smear of apricot jelly.
</P>
<P>
   The nut butters will be ground fresh-to-order at the restaurant,
and children will be able to create a flavor and label their own
``brand'' of peanut butter. The personal peanut butter will be
served with their order or packaged for home use.
</P>
<P>
   Any kid's PB&AMP;J dream come true, right? Perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   Then again, ``a lot of this is frankly appealing to the whims of
the adults,'' Smith says. ``We want to be a little bit gourmet and
have fun with it without getting too wacky.''
</P>
<P>
   Not just for kids anymore
</P>
<P>
   Kelly Swartz has been eating PB&AMP;J since she was ``old enough to
eat real food.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I love peanut butter and jelly! It's my favorite meal and it's
sooo American,'' the 16-year-old Blue Valley Northwest High School
student says.
</P>
<P>
   Over the Fourth of July, Swartz was staying in Berlin as part of
an exchange program. To celebrate this most American of holidays,
Swartz decided to serve her new German friends ``the most American
dinner'' she could think of _ macaroni and cheese from a box,
peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and store-bought chocolate chip
cookies.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a big hit,'' she says of the meal.
</P>
<P>
   An audio engineer for KMBC, Channel 9, Dolores Burke-King also
has fond memories of peanut butter as patriotic ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   Burke-King had just graduated from college in 1982 and was
living in Ireland when she introduced her housemates to the joys of
a PB&AMP;J. For an entire summer they ate homemade rhubarb-date jam and
imported Australian peanut butter slathered on Irish soda bread.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was far from home for the first time in my life, traveling
and living by myself. Peanut butter and jelly helped with the
homesickness,'' says Burke-King, whose family of eight children
went ``through tubs of peanut butter.''
</P>
<P>
   Sure. Most American children are reared on PB&AMP;J, but it's not
just for kids anymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people have seen it as a very sweet kiddie food,'' the
Peanut Butter &AMP; Co.'s Zalben says. ``But peanut butter is a savory
taste and goes very well with savory food or as a complement to
more neutral foods.''
</P>
<P>
   Peanut butter also is age-neutral. ``Everyone has great memories
of their first peanut butter and jelly sandwich. They remind us of
simpler, happier times,'' Zalben says.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can have a mom and her child come in and have them end up
sitting next to a middle-aged couple wearing suits who are eating
on their lunch hour. They still get the same glint in their eye as
they prepare to take that first bite,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   But are people willing to pay $5 for a sandwich they can make at
home?
</P>
<P>
   Apparently so.
</P>
<P>
   Open since February, Peanut Butter &AMP; Co.'s Zalben already is
making expansion plans. He's betting peanut butter is where coffee
was 10 years ago, before there was a Starbuck's on every corner.
</P>
<P>
   Replace the `J' in PB&AMP;J with _ anything
</P>
<P>
   The average American child will eat 1,500 peanut butter
sandwiches by high school graduation, according to The Great Food
Almanac by Irena Chalmers. So in the interest of variety, here are
some combos to consider:
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   PB&AMP;J innovations
</P>
<P>
   In search of innovative PB&AMP;J combinations straight from the jar?
</P>
<P>
   Look no further than your supermarket where you'll find an array
of flavored spreads to go with, or substitute for, peanut butter.
</P>
<P>
   - Nutella _ Created by an Italian pastry chef in the 1940s, the
product became so popular that Italian food stores began offering
``smears.'' Children would go to the stores with a slice of bread
and, for roughly a penny, buy a smear of this chocolate-hazelnut
spread. Originally known as Supercrema Gianduja, the spread was
renamed in 1964. A press release boasts that Nutella, the No. 1
selling nut spread in Italy and Germany, has sales greater than
those of all peanut butter brands combined. Look for it in gourmet
stores and supermarkets.
</P>
<P>
   - Twist _ This sweet and creamy banana-flavored, milk chocolate
spread hails from Holland. The contents come piped in twisty
stripes. The glass jar bears a whimsical label with what may be an
alligator chasing a sprinting banana. Unfortunately it does not
come with subtitles. We found Twist at Hy-Vee.
</P>
<P>
   - Jif Smooth Sensations _ In July, Jif introduced three flavored
peanut butter spreads: Chocolate Silk, Apple Cinnamon and Berry
Blend. While many adult colleagues first frowned at the idea, after
an informal taste test, most conceded that, in small doses, the
folks at Jif might be onto something. A spokesman agrees it might
be too sweet for some on sandwiches but suggests using it on fruit,
crackers, pretzels and waffles. We agree.
</P>
<P>
   - Smucker's Snackers PB&AMP;J _ Who needs bread to make a PB&AMP;J? Try
crackers instead. Smucker's is touting the Snackers as a ``whole
new way to PB&AMP;J.'' You'll probably recognize it as a Lunchables
spinoff. They've prepackaged a spatula to spread small amounts of
peanut butter and grape or strawberry jelly on eight crackers.
Because it doesn't require refrigeration, it's easy to throw in a
backpack as the kids head off to school.
</P>
<P>
   - Smucker's Goober Grape _ Parents have never been able to
figure this one out, but kids love the novelty of PB&AMP;J ``stripes''
in Smucker's Goober Grape, a peanut butter and jelly blend in a
single jar.

GIVER OR GOOFBALL? JERRY LEWIS IS BOTH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BRIAN McTAVISH  
 c. 1999 The Kansas City Star   It's time again for the Jerry Lewis
Show.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Forgive me _ ``The Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a trademark Lewis pratfall, it's a seemingly easy slip to
make.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 8 p.m. Sunday the 34th annual Labor Day fund-raiser
for the Muscular Dystrophy Association returns with the serious
task of treating and finding a cure for 40 neuromuscular diseases
that most tragically ravage the bodies of children.
</P>
<P>
   Yet it's the patently zany Lewis who remains the show's
singularly captivating draw.
</P>
<P>
   Love him or hate him _ and it's fair to speculate that even
detractors of the slapstick icon tune in just to shake their heads
in amazement at his audience-pandering antics _ Lewis is the
telethon.
</P>
<P>
   Whether people watch to see a great humanitarian at work or
their favorite idiot on display, 75 million in North America are
expected to view the 211/2-hour extravaganza on television (locally
KMBC, Channel 9). Millions more will be able to see streaming video
on the Internet in the world's first live multilingual Webcast in
English, Spanish and Japanese (www.mdausa.org).
</P>
<P>
   May I make a suggestion? Take the time to look very closely at
Lewis this holiday weekend on your TV or computer screen. Because
every star, no matter how festive in the firmament, eventually
burns out.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis may act like he's only 9 years old. In reality he's 73 and
recovering from a near-fatal attack of viral meningitis, which cut
short an August concert tour of Australia.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he takes the stage his energy returns,'' said Jim Brown,
director of public affairs for the Muscular Dystrophy Association,
of which Lewis is the national chairman. ``You see the magic come
back. But behind the scenes you see how he struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sure the TV audience is going to see vintage Jerry, but
we'll still have to play it by ear as the show unfolds. He isn't
100 percent yet.''
</P>
<P>
   As a recent guest on CNN's ``Larry King Live,'' a frank Lewis
revealed that he was advised to not be host of the telethon this
year because of the risk of another attack.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis: ``So I'll establish to the audience I may get the attack.
And if I get a bad attack, I'll walk off the stage, I'll get some
chicken soup and I'll come back ... I will take care of myself. I'm
going to have the best neurologists backstage ... ''
</P>
<P>
   King: ``Can you do the physical shtick?''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis: ``No, I can't do anything physically.''
</P>
<P>
   King: ``You can't jump around the stage.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis: ``No, but I can make noise ... ''
</P>
<P>
   Host with the most
</P>
<P>
   Hear this, America: In more than 700 broadcast hours since 1966,
the annual MDA telethon has raised $953,673,793 _ that's right,
nearly $1 billion _ including a record-setting $51.5 million in
pledges and contributions in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Try imagining that arduous achievement without Lewis creatively
clowning, crying, begging and even bullying viewers for precious
pledge money to help his ``kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Ed McMahon can't. Lewis' longtime traffic cop and second banana
on the telethon views the event as inseparable from its
ultra-dedicated star, who is expected to sit on a high stool for
much of the show.
</P>
<P>
   ``But knowing him, he'll be jumping off that stool and getting
involved,'' McMahon said in a teleconference with reporters to
discuss the telethon. ``He'll be in there with the blacked-out
teeth singing a song.''
</P>
<P>
   And, as always, he'll have lots of help. Recalling the golden
era of ``Ed Sullivan'' and other bygone TV variety shows, the MDA
telethon offers modern audiences a rare opportunity to be
entertained by a little bit of everything in one sitting _ from
comedians, dancers and magicians to Hollywood stars, sports figures
and popular musicians.
</P>
<P>
   This year's massive and diverse guest list includes Jason
Alexander, Brandy, Mariah Carey, Carrot Top, Cher, Charo, Norm
Crosby, Sheryl Crow, Celine Dion, Laura Dern, Brendan Fraser, the
Goo Goo Dolls, Whitney Houston, Judge Judy, Lucy Lawless, Bill
Maher, Marcel Marceau, Kevin Meaney, Tom Petty and the
Heartbreakers, Cathy Rigby, LeAnn Rimes, Gen. H. Norman
Schwarzkopf, Martin Short, Martha Stewart and Christopher Walken.
</P>
<P>
   Cast members from Broadway's ``Fosse'' and ``Annie Get Your
Gun'' also will perform.
</P>
<P>
   ``We say, `Look, we're going to entertain the hell out of you.
Then we're going to get your money,' '' McMahon said. ``We can
present Ray Charles and a 30-piece orchestra and strike them, and 2
minutes later bring out an acrobatic team. We're putting on one of
the best shows on the air.''
</P>
<P>
   Lewis isn't too bad, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're seeing a guy who really knows physical comedy. Some of
those close-up shots of him being silly, but being silly on a
worldwide stage, are quite a phenomenal thing to witness. And it's
great for people to see that and understand it.''
</P>
<P>
   Assessing a legend
</P>
<P>
   But does anyone really understand Lewis? (Besides the French,
that is, who have long hailed him as a comic auteur misunderstood
and underappreciated in his own country.) Does the man himself?
</P>
<P>
   Lewis' storied, up-and-down career suggests a perfectionist
performer making do in an imperfect show-biz world, a talent
tormented by his need to make people laugh and also triumphant
because of it.
</P>
<P>
   An eager performer since age 5, Lewis was a high-school dropout
(with a genius IQ) struggling as a solo act in New York's Borscht
Belt, when he partnered with then-toiling singer Dean Martin in
1946 in Atlantic City. The comedy team's onstage chemistry was
immediate _ Martin was civilized, Lewis was a lunatic _ and the two
rocketed to fame. For the next 10 years the duo reigned supreme in
movies, radio, television, nightclubs _ and fund-raisers, including
those that benefited the fight against muscular dystrophy.
</P>
<P>
   In later years Lewis would be repeatedly asked why he chose MD
over any other malady to so publicly battle. He has typically
refused to answer, saying in 1973, ``That's the only secret I
have.''
</P>
<P>
   The historic split between Martin and Lewis came with plenty of
hard feelings in 1956, although 20 years later the duo would be
briefly reunited onstage by Frank Sinatra in a memorable hug on the
1976 Lewis telethon. (Martin died at age 78 in 1995.)
</P>
<P>
   On his own, Lewis continued starring in popular movies,
eventually taking on the additional mantles of directing, writing
and producing. It seemed the harder he worked, the more he wanted
to know what others thought of him.
</P>
<P>
   In 1957 Bob Thomas of The Associated Press wrote that Lewis was
``an extremely sensitive fellow,'' who personally subscribed to
four clipping services. ``Criticisms sting him deeply and he
overlooks none of them ...,'' Thomas reported. ``He reads every
item and broods over the knocks.''
</P>
<P>
   Although such visually inventive Lewis films as 1960's ``The
Bell Boy'' garnered strong European favor, they were ignored or
belittled by most critics at home as trivial and infantile.
</P>
<P>
   That same year, perhaps buoyed by his overseas acceptance, Lewis
announced he was giving up TV appearances to devote himself to
movies. ``A film is foreverness, TV for a moment,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1963 Lewis returned to TV in a live two-hour weekly variety
show on ABC. The network soon canceled the show _ a disaster by all
accounts _ buying out Lewis' contract for $4 million. He returned
to making movies.
</P>
<P>
   In 1966, as his old partner Martin scored big on television,
Lewis again vowed to be through with the small screen, saying
``it's dull, it's canned, it's tasteless.'' Despite his put-downs,
a year later he again tried TV, starring in his own short-lived
series on NBC.
</P>
<P>
   As the '60s passed into the '70s and beyond, the public's once
avid interest in Lewis was mostly a memory, except when it came to
his telethons for muscular dystrophy. Still, Lewis has made
attempts to be relevant in show business outside of his
high-profile charity work.
</P>
<P>
   Although never released, his 1971 film ``The Day the Clown
Cried'' _ about a German clown arrested by the Gestapo and used to
march Jewish children into the ovens of a concentration camp _
almost seems a sacrificial precursor to last year's controversial
Oscar-winner ``Life Is Beautiful.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1983 he finally won concerted praise from American movie
critics for his straight role as a Johnny Carson-style talk-show
host kidnapped by an obsessed fan (played by Robert De Niro) in
Martin Scorsese's ``The King of Comedy.'' And in 1995, Lewis
realized his lifelong dream of appearing on Broadway when he played
the devil in a revival of ``Damn Yankees.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet today, ask anyone to tell you the last time they saw Jerry
Lewis perform, outside of an old movie, and the likely response is
on the MDA telethon. Perhaps that's why occasional attacks on the
telethon through the years by groups questioning its financial
integrity and ``pity party'' approach to raising money hurt him so
deeply.
</P>
<P>
   But then maybe Lewis has already gotten his reward for his
decades of telethon work. After performing emergency open heart
surgery on Lewis in 1982, Michael DeBakey, who is still Lewis'
primary physician, said that the millions of dollars raised by MDA
telethons contributed to scientific research on muscle function
that probably helped save his life.
</P>
<P>
   When Lewis, still on the mend from his life-threatening bout
with viral meningitis, sings ``You'll Never Walk Alone'' at the
close of this year's telethon _ perhaps tearfully, perhaps breaking
down _ millions of viewers will be rooting for ``Jerry's Kids.''
But this time, they may be pulling for Jerry, too.

   Home Section stories from The N.Y. Times News Service for
Thursday, Sept. 2:
</P>
<P>
   NY-NORTH-SHORE-HOUSE (Undated) _ This was a summer of roses for
Carol and Millard Prisant, a Long Island couple who vacationed at
home by simply stepping through the screen doors onto their
rose-bedecked wraparound porch and drinking in a view of the long
harbor in their backyard. Maybe their part of the North Shore had a
faster social engine when Gatsby partied in the Eggs along with the
Fricks and the Morgans, but time is surprisingly slow even in 1999.
If the house and setting seem like a pocket of perfection suspended
in time, there are two reasons, separated by over a hundred years.
First, the house was conceived in 1862 as the country house of the
future. The second reason the house seems perfect is that the
Prisants _ he is a former rocket scientist who now owns an
aerospace hardware company; she is the New York editor of World of
Interiors magazine _ have restored it to the ideal from which it
had sadly lapsed. By Joseph Giovannini.

   ESTHER-WILLIAMS-BOOK (Beverly Hills, Calif.) _ On the spreading
terrace of the hilltop house, there's a pretty blue pool and an
Esther Williams-brand whirlpool spa. There's a panoramic view to
the Pacific Ocean and a custom-made Esther Williams kick board
propped on the lawn. But nothing quite prepares a visitor for the
sight of Esther Williams herself, in short white shorts, black
flats, black tube top and white cotton blouse adorned with a
rhinestone-speckled applique of a top hat and gloves on the front.
She emerges from the shade of her living room in full-body makeup,
legs firm and posture perfect, smiling that 1,000-watt waterproof
smile, and asks politely, ``Would you like to take a swim?'' The
offer is tempting, but there are no trunks and the task at hand is
talk. The topic is Miss Williams's new memoir, ``The Million Dollar
Mermaid'' a ribald account of her years as MGM's aquatic sensation,
the godmother of synchronized swimming and one of the top 10 box
office stars in the world. By Todd S. Purdum.

   VIRGINIA-RETREAT (New York) _ Come the weekend, when half of
Manhattan is packing shorts and cell phones for a mass migration to
the beach, two of its number are making a beeline for the South.
About an hour's plane ride later (even as others, sustained by a
kind of grim fatalism, are still inching along the Long Island
Expressway), these same two are already enjoying the amenities of
their weekend retreat in Richmond, Va. By Martha Baker.

BEAUJOLAIS: A WINE FOR DRINKING, NOT SIPPING 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By RUTH FANTASIA  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Although wine marketing wizards would have us believe otherwise,
you don't have to wait until the third Thursday in November to
drink Beaujolais. You simply have to locate Beaujolais bottles that
don't have the word ``nouveau'' printed on the label.
</P>
<P>
   A task that, although not the easiest, isn't impossible. Like
the nouveau wines we've become accustomed to having during the
holidays, non-nouveau Beaujolais are light, fruity and easy to
drink. In fact, in the Beaujolais region of France, the slang for
these wines is gouleyant, which literally translated means
``gulpable,'' writes Michael Schuster in the ``Beginner's Guide to
Understanding Wine'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster, 1989).
</P>
<P>
   New or not, Beaujolais is quaffing wine, meant to be drunk, not
sipped. But therein lies the danger. Thanks to their lighter,
fruitier, more friendly style, it is easy to overindulge.
Beaujolais wines are generally deep red in color with a distinctly
blue tinge making them appear violet. Low in tannins, they lack the
cheek-rattlng qualities of heavier reds such as cabernet sauvignon
and zinfandel and served slightly chilled, they are as close to a
white wine as a red wine can get.
</P>
<P>
   BEAUJOLAIS: THE REGION
</P>
<P>
   Unlike American and Australian wines, French wines are named for
the area in which they are made instead of the grapes from which
they are produced. Beaujolais, generally made from gamay grapes, is
produced in France's Beaujolais appellation; a strip of land, 30
miles long by roughly 8 miles wide in the lower area of the
country's famed Burgundy wine region. Beaujolais itself is divided
into two sections: Haut-Beaujolais and Bas-Beaujolais. The
Bas-Beaujolais, is the southernmost area where the soil is rich and
mostly limestone and clay. It's known for producing great quantity
more than quality. Usually, if you see a bottle labeled simply
Beaujolais, it was made here. These are flowery, fruity, simple
wines that must be drunk young. They are not intended for keeping.
Buy them, drink them. Serve slightly chilled (52 degrees) with all
types of food.
</P>
<P>
   THE VILLAGES
</P>
<P>
   The second area, the Haut-Beaujolais, is to the north and is the
source of better wines. Here you'll find the production of
Beaujolais-Villages (a step up from Beaujolais) and the 10 crus of
the Beaujolais region.
</P>
<P>
   Beaujolais-Villages wines contain a minimum of 10 percent
alcohol. These wines have more complexity and depth than Beaujolais
wines. Cherry red in color, Beaujolais-Villages can be kept one to
three years. Serve at 52-54 degrees with grilled and roasted meat,
poultry, cold cuts and cheese.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike American wines that are frequently grown, pressed,
fermented, bottled and sold by the winery, the grapes used in
Beaujolais are grown on small vineyards by hundreds of farmers who
then sell their crop to negociants (nah-GO-SEE-ahn). The
negociants, such as George DeBouef and Louis Jadot, make and sell
the wine under their own label. In some instances, when the grapes
are from a particularly respected, and highly rated vineyard, the
wine will be labeled for the vineyard in addition to the village.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of where in France your Beaujolais comes from, you're
going to be hard pressed to find a bottle that costs more than $20.
</P>
<P>
   THE CRUS
</P>
<P>
   The northern part of Hapt-Beaujolais is divided into 10 crus, or
designated growing regions:
</P>
<P>
   Chiroubles (shee-ROOB-luh) _ Light bodied and the most balanced
of the cru wines. Serve at 54 degrees with roasted poultry and
white meats.
</P>
<P>
   Fleurie (FLUR-ee) _ Light bodied with the aroma of violets, the
Flurie area is called ``The Queen of the Beaujolaise.'' Serve at 54
degrees with lamb, grilled beef, roasts and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   Saint-Amour (sant ah-moor) _ Light bodied with the aroma of
stone fruits such as peaches, nectarines or apricots. Serve at 55
degrees with grilled meats, lightly seasoned stews, poultry and
pate.
</P>
<P>
   Brouilly (BREW-yee) _ The largest of the crus, wines from
Brouilly are generally known for being grapy tasting with red fruit
or blueberry aromas. Grown on the plains surrounding Mont Brouilly.
Serve at 54 degrees with poultry and red meat.
</P>
<P>
   Cote de Brouilly (coat duh BREW-yee) _ Grown on the hillsides of
Mont Brouilly, wines of this cru have similar flavors and aromas as
the Brouilly wines but with more depth and character. Serve at 55
degrees with meat stews, poultry, roasts or game.
</P>
<P>
   Regnie (ren-N'YAY) _ Usually, these wines have more concentrated
flavors than those from Brouilly. Regnie is the newest cru,
designated as such in 1988. Serve these at 54 degrees with
terrines, meats and light appetizers.
</P>
<P>
   Morgon (more-GOH) _ Medium bodied wines with the aroma of
cherries and plums. Serve at 54 degrees with hearty meat stews,
game, roast duck and seafood.
</P>
<P>
   Julienas (ZJOO-lee-ay-nah) _ Medium bodied with the aroma of
cherries and raspberries. Serve at 54 degrees with coq au vin,
game, red meats and cheeses.
</P>
<P>
   Chenas (shay-NAH) _ The rarest of the 10 crus, these wines are
medium bodied with the floral aromas of peonies. Chenas usually
have more aroma than Julienas, making them better for longer
storage. Serve at 57 degrees, with red meats, stews, strong cheeses
and big spicy dishes.
</P>
<P>
   Moulin-A-Vent (MOO-lan ah vahn) _ Named for a 300-year-old
windmill in the area, these wines have more weight and depth than
the other crus. When young, they have a rose, violet and red-fruit
aroma. With age, the scent develops into a mushroom-gamy smell.
They have great aging potential, usually keeping for seven to 10
years. Serve at 57 degrees with red meats, game, robust cheeses and
hearty dishes.

LESSONS OF A DAUGHTER'S TORMENTED LIFE MAY OFFER HOPE TO OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHUONG LE  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ Carolyn Higgins remains puzzled when she looks at the
photograph of her daughter taken two weeks before her death.
</P>
<P>
   In the picture, Lexi Higgins is 19, bright-eyed and beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   But she also appears sad and troubled, her strained smile
revealing how she struggled for years with a personality disorder
few people understand and one she ultimately could not control.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 17, Lexi Higgins went to the Rite Aid in downtown
Seattle and bought lipstick, mascara and a large bottle of
extra-strength Tylenol. After sending an e-mail message to her
lawyer promising not to kill herself, she took 375 pills and ended
her life, alone in the room she rented for the summer at the YWCA.
</P>
<P>
   When the daughter's struggle with borderline personality
disorder ended, the mother's search for answers began.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's not enough understanding about this disorder,''
Carolyn Higgins said from her home in Seattle's Lake City
neighborhood a day after Lexi's memorial service. Bouquets of
flowers sent from friends and family still crowded the dining room.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of how hard Lexi fought to get through the days and hoping
to help others, her parents have started a fund at Washington
Mutual to benefit those who suffer from personality disorders.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our dream is to establish some sort of hospice where young
girls like Lexi could go,'' Carolyn Higgins said. ``There was no
place that was suitable for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Lexi's parents are also trying to piece together what happened
to her and what they can do to help others who suffered as she did.
</P>
<P>
   Even after her death, they continue to search the Internet and
libraries for answers: What is this disorder that tormented their
daughter? Why is so little known about it, even though it affects
about 2 percent of the population?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very complex disorder,'' said Dr. Marsha Linehan, a
leading researcher of borderline personality disorder and
University of Washington professor. ``It's exceptionally difficult
to treat.''
</P>
<P>
   Research on the subject is relatively scant given that the
disorder has only been included in the American Psychiatric
Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, the bible of the
profession, since 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Its exact causes are unclear. It is characterized by instability
in mood, self-image and personal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   People with borderline personality disorders have a severe
inability to regulate their emotions and, therefore, control their
behavior, Linehan said.
</P>
<P>
   They have problems controlling emotions such as anxiety, fear,
love, depression and sadness, which can lead to drug use and
impulsive actions and cause sufferers to harm themselves.
</P>
<P>
   About 10 percent of sufferers commit suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Lexi Higgins may have seen suicide as an escape from her endless
battles with low self-esteem, severe mood swings, intense anger,
fears of abandonment and other emotions that she was not able to
control.
</P>
<P>
   ``Something inside of her was causing her horrible agony,''
Lexi's mother said. ``I could see that she was just tormented.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were times when she could see clearly and try to get
herself back on track, and for some reason she would become lost in
this other space and not be able to control her behavior.''
</P>
<P>
   Lexi Higgins' life embodied the sentiments of the popular book
on borderline personality disorder entitled ``I Hate You, Don't
Leave Me,'' those who knew her said.
</P>
<P>
   Hers was a life of extremes, of intense feelings of emptiness
and of unstable, intense personal relationships.
</P>
<P>
   She was a loyal friend who sent birthday cards even from her
hospital bed and tried to cheer others up even when she was
depressed. She was a sorority sister who loved games and going out,
yet often felt alone or unloved. She was a talented student who
swam and competed in gymnastics at Nathan Hale High School and
earned several scholarships to study at Washington State University
in Pullman.
</P>
<P>
   But she also did things that frustrated her friends and family
and baffled those who tried to help her.
</P>
<P>
   She told strange stories about her life, lied about things such
as her birthdate and became enraged over what most people consider
tiny problems, such as not being able to return a library book on
time.
</P>
<P>
   She erupted in fury over minor incidents and viewed every slight
against her as if it were the worst. She became furious once when
she wasn't offered a cup of coffee, even when she didn't drink
coffee.
</P>
<P>
   Last summer, she stole $4,000 from the Bon Marche store when she
worked as a retail clerk. She pleaded guilty to one count of
second-degree theft the day before she died.
</P>
<P>
   And then there were the suicidal tendencies and attempts to harm
herself with razor blades, both common signs of sufferers. She
tried several times to kill herself, the first serious attempt
coming in November at Washington State University.
</P>
<P>
   But with ``the courage of Napoleon,'' Lexi Higgins fought back
and tried to find help, her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Lexi often sought help at the emergency rooms of hospitals such
as Seattle's Harborview Medical Center, telling nurses and doctors
that she wanted to kill herself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think she let people know what was going on,'' said
childhood friend Jessica Coulson, who met Lexi when she was 8.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was a brilliant girl, humorous and effervescent. She took
things hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Her friends and family wanted to know why she did what she did.
</P>
<P>
   Despite her uncontrollable behavioral problems, she still
managed to draw people to her with her sense of humor and quick
wit, her mother said.
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Ellis, a Seattle public defender who represented Lexi in
her theft case and to whom she sent perhaps the last correspondence
before her death, remembers how she constantly reached out to
others even when she was down.
</P>
<P>
   ``The real question is what was going on with this very bright
and wonderful person who was very troubled as well,'' Ellis said.
</P>
<P>
   `` . . . I hope Lexi's life can help us take a step forward to
deal with this population.''
</P>
<P>
   In the end, her mother said in her eulogy, ``the tragedy of her
life is that she alone was unable to see her own exquisite
loveliness.''

`YELLOW SUBMARINE' RESURFACES IN GLORIOUS EXPLOSION OF MUSIC,
COLOR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   When the Beatles' animated feature, ``Yellow Submarine,'' was
originally released in 1968, it got lukewarm to bad reviews, and
pretty much broke the cinematic momentum the Fab Four had going
after the stunning success of ``A Hard Day's Night'' (1964) and
``Help!'' (1965).
</P>
<P>
   But time has been unusually good to the movie. Thirty-one years
later, in a newly restored print with DTS Digital Sound, it seems a
glorious explosion of music and color, and one of the defining
moments of the '60s counterculture.
</P>
<P>
   The film's breeding is surprising: It was financed by King
Features, a division of the Hearst Corp., and one of its
screenwriters was Erich Segal (``Love Story''). The Beatles do not
speak their own voices _ which explains some of the original
critical animosity toward it as a ``non-Beatles movie.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Beatles do appear in a brief live-action finale, the
overall animation style seems to be emulating ``A Spaniard in the
Works,'' John Lennon's 1964 book of stories and drawings, and the
film is a kind of extended LSD-inspired tribute to Beatle lore.
</P>
<P>
   It opens in a happy place somewhere beneath the sea called
Pepperland, whose peaceful citizens are attacked and imprisoned by
a band of baddies called the Blue Meanies _ all except for Fred,
the conductor of Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Heart's Club Band, who
escapes in a Yellow Submarine.
</P>
<P>
   The sub emerges in Liverpool, where Fred corrals John, Paul,
George and Ringo to return with him in a confusing journey through
a series of seas _ the sea of monsters, the sea of holes, the sea
of green _ to fight the meanies with an infusion of music, color
and positive energy.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, we're treated to 12 Beatles songs _ classics like
``Eleanor Rigby,'' ``Lucy in the Sky With Diamonds,'' ``Nowhere
Man,'' ``When I'm Sixty-Four,'' and four written especially for the
film (one of which, ``Hey Bulldog,'' never appeared on the original
U.S. release).
</P>
<P>
   As designed by Heinz Edelman and director George Dunning, each
song is played against a visual sequence in a different artistic
style _ surrealism, art nouveau, pop art, opt art, psychedelia _
and ranges from the silly to the elegant to the achingly poignant.
</P>
<P>
   All together, the film makes up a kind of compendium of the
various artistic fads and eclecticism of the '60s, and the
animation itself is so rich and experimental and outrageously
imaginative that it amounts to its very own festival of animation.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, this animation would prove to be highly
influential. It marked a clear break with the reigning Disney
style, and inspired virtually everything that came after. ``Toy
Story'' director John Lassiter has called it ``a landmark in
animation history ... the first real pop animated feature.''
</P>
<P>
   As many critics have pointed out over the years, ``Yellow
Submarine'' also embodies, between its lines, exactly what the
Beatles represented emotionally and philosophically in the
mid-'60s: artistic daring, cheeky non-sentimentality, a new
generation taking over, naively confident the world was ``getting
better all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yellow Submarine (1968). Directed by George Dunning. Screenplay
by Lee Minoff, Jack Mendelsohn and Erich Segal. Animation designed
by Heinz Edelmann. Voices: John Clive (John), Geoff Hughes (Paul),
Peter Batten (George), Paul Angelis (Ringo). United Artists/MGM. 90
minutes. Unrated.

`CHILL FACTOR' SUFFERS FROM NEVER DECIDING WHAT IT WANTS TO BE 
</HEADLINE>

 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Anyone in the market for a late-summer action movie could do
worse than ``Chill Factor,'' but it's certainly nothing special:
Its star chemistry is unusually lukewarm and its non-stop action
sequences all seem derivative of other movies.
</P>
<P>
   It's Hollywood's latest effort to capture the particular magic
of ``Speed'' _ a race to prevent an internal explosion _ and a
disjointed and often wacky effort it is at that, with an endlessly
bickering Skeet Ulrich and Cuba Gooding Jr. in the driver's seat.
</P>
<P>
   Ulrich plays a small-town Montana slacker and Gooding is the
thief of an ice cream truck, who are forced into mismatched
buddyhood when a canister of a highly volatile, frozen chemical
substance falls into their hands. If it melts, it could wipe out
most of Montana ``and maybe Seattle.''
</P>
<P>
   So they have to throw it in the ice cream truck and keep it from
hitting the critical temperature of 50 degrees, while running from
the deadly band of paramilitary terrorists who originally stole the
bomb, and the slow-witted and trigger-happy Montana police who
think our heroes are responsible for the theft.
</P>
<P>
   As they race through the desert, dodging the pursuing
motorcycles, helicopters and mini-vans filled with high-tech
equipment, there's a thrill or two. And it's fun to try to spot the
movies that director Hugh Johnson is ripping off: not just
``Speed,'' but ``The Wages of Fear,'' ``The Satan Bug'' and
``Daylight'' all seem to have been major inspirations.
</P>
<P>
   But it's hard to stay hooked because the film can never quite
decide what it wants to be. It starts with a 15-minute prologue
that establishes a morbidly serious mood, then gets progressively
lighter as it goes along until it suddenly turns slapsticky and
silly, and begins to resemble a Road Runner cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chill Factor'' also suffers from the low-voltage casting of
Ulrich and Gooding. Both have been effective in other roles in
other movies, but neither has the distinctive spark of an action
hero, and their Butch-and-Sundance repartee falls so consistently
flat that you end up feeling a little embarrassed for them.
</P>
<P>
   Chill Factor. Directed by Hugh Johnson. Screenplay by Drew
Gitlin and Mike Cheda. Cast: Cuba Gooding Jr., Skeet Ulrich, Peter
Firth, David Paymer, Hudson Leick. Warner Bros. 105 minutes. Rated
R for violence.

NOT MUCH ENLIGHTENING IN COMING-OF AGE MOVIE, `OUTSIDE
PROVIDENCE' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PAULA NECHAK  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The coming-of-age film has been a staple in the cinema for eons.
``The Graduate'' was perhaps a quintessential film of the '60s and,
on recent viewing, it still holds up well.
</P>
<P>
   But the deluge from young indie filmmakers _ the recent release
``Desert Blue'' and the upcoming ``The Adventures of Sebastian
Cole'' instantly leap to mind _ have glutted the market with
memoirs of personal rites of passage. ``Outside Providence''
nestles nicely into this niche.
</P>
<P>
   Its selling point is that it boasts the talent of those raucous
bad-boy brothers, the Farrellys, who directed ``Dumb and Dumber,''
``Kingpin'' and last year's big smash, ``There's Something About
Mary.'' ``Outside Providence'' has been adapted by the brothers
from an early novel by Peter Farrelly.
</P>
<P>
   It's certainly a loving, bawdy view of a young man's coming to
terms with a blue-collar family, love and life in the small city of
Pawtucket, Conn. But outside of a smart performance by Shawn Hatosy
as Tim Dunphy, there just isn't much that's enlightening or new in
this intimate recollection.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, it follows a formula that has been around for decades:
boarding school, first love and the search for individuality and
expression that is elusive but necessary in order to avoid becoming
stuck in a rut like the protagonist's parents.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Outside Providence,'' the younger actors bear up better
than the adults. Alec Baldwin plays pop to Tim, a young screw-up
who is sent away to school after smashing up a police car. Tim's
friends are all drunks and druggies and his little brother is
confined to a wheelchair. Even the family dog wears a patch on its
eye and has only three legs.
</P>
<P>
   At his new school, Tim collides with the usual woes: the
housemaster is itching to expel him; his friends are the requisite
outcasts and the girl he has his eye on, smart, rich and gorgeous
Jane Weston (Amy Smart), is way out of his league. But school
slowly provides an antidote to the real hardships in Tim's life and
he discovers who he is as well as embarking on the quest toward
taking control (and responsibility) for his life and actions.
</P>
<P>
   In that, ``Outside Providence'' is just fine. But it meanders
into dad's poker parties and some weird gay segues that throw the
film out of whack. Worse, Baldwin seems so intent upon replicating
Jack Nicholson's mob thug performance in ``Prizzi's Honor'' that we
wind up watching his overactive technique instead of engaging with
the quiet subplots that have taken shape.
</P>
<P>
   Like life, ``Outside Providence'' belongs to the kids. Hatosy
and Smart have a keen chemistry and they are both engaging,
attractive and natural actors. They make the characters real
despite the glorification and ridiculous romanticizing of the
uneventful, common story line that surrounds them.
</P>
<P>
   Outside Providence. Directed by Michael Corrente. Written by
Peter Farrelly, Bobby Farrelly, Michael Corrente. Cast: Shawn
Hatosy, Amy Smart, Alec Baldwin. Miramax Films. 102 minutes. Rated
R for language.

   FALL BOOKS &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ This fall, nonfiction dominates new books. Publishers
believe that it is easier to target nonfiction audiences, and that,
during the winter months, readers are more willing to curl up with
weighty, 500-page tomes. Accordingly, most of the sure-fire fall
bestsellers are nonfiction, from Frank McCourt's ``Angela's Ashes''
sequel to pop singer Jewel's printed prattlings about her life. By
JEFF GUINN. (Accompanied by FALL BOOKS-OTHERS). Story will move in

   FILM-PROVIDENCE &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Although ``Outside Providence'' comes from the
Farrelly brothers, the minds behind the gross-out hit ``There's
Something About Mary,'' there's a lot more to this film than
politically incorrect humor. It's unusually perceptive and even
charming, and it's the year's best coming-of-age film. By ROBERT
PHILPOT. Story will move in ``e'' entertainment category &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   FILM-CHILL FACTOR &QL;
</P>
<P>
   UNDATED _ Hey, Cuba Gooding Jr., the Academy of Motion Picture
Arts &AMP; Sciences called and they want their Oscar back. Well, not
really, but they might if you keep doing crummy films like ``What
Dreams May Come, Instinct'' and the predictible action ``thriller''
``Chill Factor.'' It's about a defoliant bomb that will explode if
its temperature reaches 50 degrees. Gosh, Cuba, seems like you'd be
tired of bombs by now. By TODD CAMP. Story will move in ``e''

graciously enough. The prosperous but stodgy 1950s seemed
officially over when Ike and Mamie left the White House to Jack and
Jackie. Gone were the golf holidays and Ike puttering over a hot

</P>
<P>
   NY-NORTH-SHORE-HOUSE (Undated) _ This was a summer of roses for
Carol and Millard Prisant, a Long Island couple who vacationed at
home by simply stepping through the screen doors onto their
rose-bedecked wraparound porch and drinking in a view of the long
harbor in their backyard. Maybe their part of the North Shore had a
faster social engine when Gatsby partied in the Eggs along with the
Fricks and the Morgans, but time is surprisingly slow even in 1999.
If the house and setting seem like a pocket of perfection suspended
in time, there are two reasons, separated by over a hundred years.
First, the house was conceived in 1862 as the country house of the
future. The second reason the house seems perfect is that the
Prisants _ he is a former rocket scientist who now owns an
aerospace hardware company; she is the New York editor of World of
Interiors magazine _ have restored it to the ideal from which it
had sadly lapsed. By Joseph Giovannini.

   ESTHER-WILLIAMS-BOOK (Beverly Hills, Calif.) _ On the spreading
terrace of the hilltop house, there's a pretty blue pool and an
Esther Williams-brand whirlpool spa. There's a panoramic view to
the Pacific Ocean and a custom-made Esther Williams kick board
propped on the lawn. But nothing quite prepares a visitor for the
sight of Esther Williams herself, in short white shorts, black
flats, black tube top and white cotton blouse adorned with a
rhinestone-speckled applique of a top hat and gloves on the front.
She emerges from the shade of her living room in full-body makeup,
legs firm and posture perfect, smiling that 1,000-watt waterproof
smile, and asks politely, ``Would you like to take a swim?'' The
offer is tempting, but there are no trunks and the task at hand is
talk. The topic is Miss Williams's new memoir, ``The Million Dollar
Mermaid'' a ribald account of her years as MGM's aquatic sensation,
the godmother of synchronized swimming and one of the top 10 box
office stars in the world. By Todd S. Purdum.

GARDENING QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By LESLIE LAND   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Partial-Shade Bonanza
</P>
<P>
   Q. I recently moved into a home on the Connecticut shore that
has beautiful gardens. One area, however, gets a fair amount of
shade. Mums, bee balm, parsley and marigolds are doing well in the
less-shaded part of this section, and I would like to plant a few
more perennials that will bloom in July and August. It has a
southeastern exposure.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Since you say the gardens are lovely already and don't
mention major trees, I'll assume your soil is relatively free of
roots and in good health, and by southeastern exposure, you mean
the garden gets sunlight for most of the morning. If these
assumptions are correct, your only problem will be leaving room for
later bloomers after you fill up the joint with spring delights
like columbines, violas, bleeding hearts, trout lilies, primroses
and bluebells.
</P>
<P>
   Most partial-shade gardeners fall heavily for coral bells
(Heuchera sanguinea), because they are such hard workers. Though
they start putting out airy stalks of little red, pink or white
bells in late spring, heucheras often repeat right through the
season and, if deadheaded, can usually be counted on to rebloom at
summer's end. As an added bonus, the leaves are lovely, basically
round, but sometimes also attractively scalloped and cut. Several
varieties, including Palace Purple and Pewter Moon, are grown
primarily for their deep maroon or maroon and silver foliage. These
darklings are prettiest when backed by something bright, like the
chartreuse blades of golden sedge, which also does well in partial
shade.
</P>
<P>
   Many hostas have lovely midsummer flowers. Don't forget the
puffy spires of astilibes or the taller, more delicate meadow rue
(Thalictrum ), which comes in yellow as well as pink and white.
There's great blue lobelia (Lobelia siphilitica), and all the
wonderful, intense purples of monkshood (Aconitum). For
architectural drama consider black snake root (Cimicifuga racemosa)
or, as fall comes on in earnest, the exquisite blossoms of Japanese
anemones.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking Big Girl Tomatoes
</P>
<P>
   Q. When we started to garden 30 years ago, we experimented with
many varieties of tomatoes. It didn't take long to settle on Big
Girl; we thought it stood up to bugs and disease better than
others, and we loved the flavor. After a time, we found it hard to
find seedlings, and now it is almost impossible to get them. Why?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. Take a stroll through the supermarket, looking at how many
products say ``New!'' and you'll have a good part of your answer.
The W. Atlee Burpee Company introduced Big Girl in 1976, and
although they continue to offer it, they also continue to keep
introducing other tomatoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Early Girl has taken over the girl spot,'' said David Seitz,
the director of research and product development for Burpee. He
also pointed out that commercial growers ``can only grow so many.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Big Girl just got squeezed out'' by newer
introductions, he said. It may also be feeling the pinch from the
other direction. As heirloom varieties become more and more
popular, they, too, are starting to take up space on nurseries'
seedling shelves.
</P>
<P>
   To cover your bets, ask your local garden centers about their
tomato plans well before planting time. Then, if you have to, you
can order small seedlings of Big Girl directly from Burpee. (Orders
must be placed between Jan. 1 and April 30; 800-888-1447).
</P>
<P>
   But please don't stop experimenting; there have been some pretty
spiffy developments. The new Juliette, for instance, is a wonderful
little (two inch) tomato _ sweet, firm, crack-resistant and
extremely productive.
</P>
<P>
   To get a good idea of what's out there, consult the catalogs
from Totally Tomatoes (P.O. Box 1626, Augusta, Ga. 30903;
803-663-0016; free catalog) and the Tomato Growers Supply Company
(P.O. Box 2237, Fort Myers, Fla. 33902; 888-478-7333; free
catalog), both of which offer hundreds of choices.
</P>
<P>
   A Yew Run Amok
</P>
<P>
   Q. I've got a seriously overgrown yew, which I've chopped back,
so it's about eight feet tall and nearly as wide. Nothing but a few
straggly weeds grows under there now. Can I surround it with day
lilies, both for the flowers and to fill in the gap?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. You can, if by surround you mean plant in a ring six to 10
feet away from the trunk. As you have noticed, even weeds are
having trouble in the deep shade under that yew, which in its years
of overgrowing has undoubtedly set down a mat of roots that would
give pause to anything but the most tenacious ground cover. If I
were you, I'd go for a nice smooth mulch of pine needles.

PERSONAL FINANCE SOFTWARE 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By PETER H. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In his stage play ``Millennium Bug,'' the economist and
performance artist Steven Tomlinson describes a new software
package called Veritas 2000 that not only manages your personal
finances, but also your soul. Veritas 2000 promises to lead
consumers out of debt and into affluence, but it does so by
tracking the user's spending and savings down to the most minute
level, spewing alerts and threats if a penny is spent
unnecessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Quicken 2000 Deluxe ($59.95, or $39.95 for previous
Quicken users) nor its archrival Microsoft Money 2000 Deluxe
($44.95 until Nov. 30, $64.95 afterward) dare to intrude so deeply
into personal spending habits, but they do take the idea of
personal financial management to new levels, especially with the
aid of the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Both of these new programs jingle with features that help the
user manage daily finances, plan and invest, prepare for taxes, do
online banking, shop for insurance, and even tap into financial
information round the clock, and round the world, through
affiliated Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   These Year 2000 deluxe versions use the Internet for everything
from ferreting out information on investments to tracking down the
best financing options for major purchases. In a sign of the times,
both Quicken and Money provide detailed guidance on employee stock
options.
</P>
<P>
   Quicken and Money have been slugging it out for years, and their
epic rivalry is similar to that of baseball's Mark McGwire and
Sammy Sosa. Both are in a league by themselves, and both continue
to hit home runs at a hectic pace. Quicken scored with its
checkbook interface, Money countered with its better online
integration, Quicken took the lead with tax integration, Money
fired back with better planning tools, Quicken added easier data
entry, and so on.
</P>
<P>
   This year, both programs sport improved interfaces, and both
programs are swinging for the virtual fences with their Internet
links.
</P>
<P>
   There is not enough space here to list all of the features of
the deluxe versions of both of these programs and their respective
Web sites, www.quicken.com and www.moneycentral.com. The big news
is that Microsoft has scrapped its former $9.95 a month access fee
for MSN Money Central, which is now free. Quicken.com remains free.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the other major features include the ability to track
bank accounts and credit cards, balance multiple checkbooks,
customize a budget, spew out endless graphs and charts in a
pathetic effort to impress ones spouse, plan for retirement or
college or other major events, grab current financial news and
stock quotes off the Web, analyze thousands of stocks and mutual
funds, track investment performance, pay bills on line, and even
enter data without having to wait to load the actual program.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, users will probably spend 80 percent of their time just
balancing the checkbook.
</P>
<P>
   The fictitious Veritas 2000 program also bristles with features,
but in the end they function mainly to highlight the risk that
focusing too much on numbers and data can cause the user to
overlook the more important things in life, like happiness. Both
Intuit (the maker of Quicken) and Microsoft have tried to program a
warmer and fuzzier feeling into the software. Both programs seem
determined to help the user plan for future happiness, and both get
fairly personal. Quicken will tell you how much your car is worth
and will scour the Internet to tell you how much your neighbor paid
for his or her house. Money will help you find the best way to pay
for your new refrigerator and will help you plan ``what if''
scenarios ranging from winning the lottery to getting hit by a bus.
I'm surprised neither program offered to lend me $20 until next
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   In preparing for this version of its Money program, Microsoft
determined that nearly two-thirds of all the families that owned a
personal computer already have some sort of personal financial
management software. This is not surprising, considering that many
computer manufacturers sell PC's with such software already loaded
(some include both Quicken and Money.)
</P>
<P>
   Even though the software is already installed, only half of the
PC owners actually try the programs, and of those, Microsoft found,
only one of three used it on a continuing basis.
</P>
<P>
   One could make several inferences from these findings. One
supposition is that most PC owners do not need financial software
because they are natural wizards at managing their finances using
conventional analog techniques like checkbook registers and shoebox
receipt bins.
</P>
<P>
   No, I didn't think so, either. More likely, they have watched
their computers lose, mangle or hold their other data captive, and
they would rather entrust their important financial data to a
hardened criminal than to a hard drive. Or, they have come to
believe that using a personal finance program is more trouble than
it is worth.
</P>
<P>
   That may have been true when entering data into the older
programs, but consumers now have the ability to transfer data
directly into the program from their bank accounts, investment
portfolios and credit card statements. Each program has
relationships with more than 600 banks, and downloading bank
statements sure beats plugging each check into the electronic
register one at a time.
</P>
<P>
   If you are already using one program or the other, there are no
features in the new versions that are so dazzling as to warrant
switching.
</P>
<P>
   If you are using an ancient version of either program _ more
than a few years old _ and are happy with it, you ought to upgrade
anyway if only to avoid any potential problems with Y2K
compatibility. The 2000 versions of Money and Quicken are fully
Year 2000-compliant.
</P>
<P>
   For people just starting out with a personal financial manager,
Money 2000, with its impressive Setup Assistant, clean design and
use of audio and video coaching, is the easier program to learn.
Although I had better not explain why, I was grateful that the
program offered to send me reminders by e-mail when it comes time
to pay bills and file my expense reports.
</P>
<P>
   For Macintosh users the choice is easy, as Microsoft has no
plans to create a version of Money for Macs. (Intuit dismayed the
Apple community in 1998 by announcing that it would no longer
support the Macintosh, but it relented under pressure.) Canadians
will want to take advantage of Quicken's north-of-the-border
version.
</P>
<P>
   If tax preparation is a major concern, Quicken gets the edge
because of its close integration with the Turbotax and Macintax
programs, also made by Intuit. However, Microsoft plans to
introduce its own tax-prep program, Taxsaver, in December, and one
can expect it to work closely with Money 2000.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: The intense rivalry between Quicken and Money
has resulted in a steady improvement in both programs, and the 2000
deluxe versions of both are excellent. Quicken has been around for
15 years and is by far the more popular program, but Money has
closed the gap and deserves serious consideration, especially by
those who are just now making the commitment to manage their
finances by computer.
</P>
<P>
   Tomlinson's fictitious Veritas 2000 program, which he describes
in a play currently showing in Austin, Texas, would advise the user
to skip lunch for a couple of weeks to pay for the new software,
noting that the $50 saved will grow to $100,000 in just a few short
decades thanks to the miracle of compound interest. I'd say, go
ahead, splurge now. You and your finances deserve it.

 &HT;    A WARY EGYPT HOSTS PEACE TALKS AS SPECTRE OF CAMP DAVID LOOMS
 &HT;    600&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-PEACE-0902.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Egyptian Yasmin Mahdy remembers the hope she felt
as a teenager when she watched and videotaped the signing of the
Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinians in 1993. Now, that
peace process has stalled and she's wary as her country hosts the
latest attempt Thursday(Sept. 2) to revive it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody will be glued to the television for
this,'' says Mahdy, 22, a member of the American University of
Cairo's Model Arab League, a diplomatic club similar to a model
United Nations program. ``Ink on paper is good, but it has to be
implemented ... It might be only by the time we're almost dead that
we see something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   This amateur diplomat looks on skeptically as the old pro
diplomats, including U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
meet here Thursday with the chance of signing a new memorandum
outlining the next steps in the long-delayed Oslo process.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting comes in the same month 21 years ago that President
Jimmy Carter hosted the Camp David negotiations, in which Egypt,
the largest Arab country with 66 million people, became the first
Arab nation to make peace with Israel. The agreement returned the
Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, but the legacy of Camp David looms large
over Thursday's meeting and a peace process many Egyptians feel has
let them down, mainly because Palestinians, who many Egyptians call
``Arab brothers,'' are still without a state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egypt's status in the world is very much determined by its
ability to influence the peace process,'' said political columnist
Mohamed Sid-Ahmed. ``Egypt wants to prove that it was right to
follow the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many call the peace treaty with Israel the ``pharaoh's
peace,'' a reference to former President Anwar Sadat, who made the
deal in 1979. He sprung it on his people and fellow Arab leaders
shunned him. Barely any Arab leaders attended Sadat's funeral after
he was slain by a militant group opposed to the peace process in
1981.
</P>
<P>
   His successor, Hosni Mubarak will host Albright Thursday.
Mubarak has stressed that Arabs need to be patient with Israel's
new Prime Minister Ehud Barak. He has pressured fellow Arab leader
Yasser Arafat to be flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak is sure to win his fourth term in office later in
September in a referendum vote, but a signing ceremony Thursday
could inject some enthusiasm into the vote.
</P>
<P>
   It is an indication of the Egyptian anxiety over Israel that
Mubarak, now in office 18 years, has only gone next door to visit
Israel once, to attend the funeral of slain Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian press regularly warns of Israeli conspiracies. The
latest accused the Egyptian agriculture minister of being an
Israeli agent because he was letting Egyptian farmers train in
Israel and use Israeli seeds.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   A popular movie in Cairo is, ``The Girl from Israel,'' the story
of a seductress sent to undermine Egyptian values. Though many
Israelis vacation at Sinai beach resorts, few Egyptians venture
into Israel and many that do face scrutiny and harassment from
Egyptian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Trade between Egypt and Israel is minimal and Egypt still lags
behind in key indicators _ per capita income in Egypt in 1997 was
about $4,400 compared to $17,500 in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian newspapers Wednesday warned that hope of a signing
Thursday should be tempered with the consideration, as one
columnist noted, that ``even Albright herself cannot guarantee that
Barak will keep his commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy and educated students at AUC are not typical of all
Egyptians, most of whom are preoccupied with making a living. But,
Mahdy is typical of many who feel that the principles their country
envisioned in peace have not been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, the Camp David agreement called for a five-year
period before autonomy would be granted to Palestinians. That
autonomy has developed slowly and fallen short of the statehood
they still seek.
</P>
<P>
   When Mahdy hears Albright and other diplomats speak of their
goal for a ``comprehensive peace'' in the region within a couple
years, she worries it will be just a forced deal favoring Israel
and papering over the injustices to the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in her Model Arab League training she learns that
countries act for their interests and, ultimately, peace is in the
interest of all the parties. She thinks it might take a generation,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as optimistic as you're going to get,'' she says.

   Indecisive? Printing 101
</P>
<P>
   Q. If I've sent files from my Mac to the printer, how do I stop
one from printing?  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A. If you have the Background Printing feature enabled on your
Macintosh (it's the default setting for the printer drivers in
newer versions of the operating system), all the files wait their
turn for the printer. The printer keeps these jobs in its buffer
until it is ready to deal with them. That is sometimes called
spooling. (Spool is short for simultaneous peripheral operations on
line.
</P>
<P>
   To get to the files waiting to print, double-click on the
printer icon on your desktop (if you have a version of the Mac OS
that uses the Desktop Printers function). A window will pop up and
show you the documents waiting to be printed. You can click on the
job you do not want to print and then click on the trash-can icon
to delete the file from the printer's to-do list. (This doesn't
delete the actual file.) If you have a Mac with older system
software that doesn't use Desktop Printers, you can delete jobs
with the system's Print Monitor utility, found in the Applications
menu (on the right side of the menu bar) when you are printing.
</P>
<P>
   For Windows users, click on the Printer icon in the lower right
corner of your Taskbar. A list of all files that are waiting to
print should pop up. Highlight the file you wish to stop and click
on Cancel Printing from the Document menu.

ELECTRIC `GOLF CART' MAKES IT'S DEBUT ON STREETS OF SAN FRANCISCO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MATT BEER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ A San Francisco store is marketing a
neighborhood electric vehicle, or NEV, part of a fleet of electric
bikes, scooters and skateboards being billed as clean and efficient
way to get around town.
</P>
<P>
   The NEVs, manufactured in Fargo, N.D., are allowed on the
streets because of recent federal regulations that allow low-speed
electric vehicles to travel any city street that has a 35 mph or
slower speed limit, said Gary Starr, the managing director of the
ZAPworld.com store in the Fisherman's Wharf section of the city.
ZAP stands for zero air pollution.
</P>
<P>
   ``You won't be cruising the Golden Gate Bridge with them,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   San Francisco City Administrator Bill Lee, who has been testing
electric and compressed cars for use by city workers, said he was
taking a ``wait and see'' approach before encouraging the
widespread use and rental of the three electric cars that can best
be described as beefed-up golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are still some issues with how long they can go between
charges, rental costs and other things,'' Lee said. ``But I think,
all in all, they're a good thing for San Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   Starr said the cars, which were tested for the last two weeks on
city streets, have been a hit.
</P>
<P>
   ``People were trying to rent them while we were just setting
them up on the street,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The open-air cars, which cost $100 per day to rent, offer a
double tour of San Francisco, Starr said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You get to see a great city while meeting its people,'' Starr
said. ``That's because they're real people magnets.''
</P>
<P>
   The car has a top speed of 30 mph and has a 30-mile range with
each charge. The four-seat NEV sells for $9,500.

CHIPPING AWAY WITH COLD CHISELS

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cold chisels are used to cut through hard materials like metal
or masonry. They are often used to cut or shape metal when the
stock is thick and where other tools, like a hacksaw or tin snips,
would be unsuitable. The striking end of the cold chisel is
chamfered to reduce mushrooming and burring caused by constant
hammering.
</P>
<P>
   Cold chisels are designed to be struck with a hammer; either a
machinist's hammer (often called a ball-peen hammer) or a small
sledgehammer (sometimes called a club hammer). Always wear heavy
gloves and safety goggles when working with cold chisels.
</P>
<P>
   The four most useful shapes for cold chisels are the flat
chisel, cape chisel, round-nose chisel and the diamond-point
chisel.
</P>
<P>
   The flat chisel has a flat, wedge-shaped cutting edge that is
ground on both sides to a 60-degree angle. The chisel is hand held
by wrapping the fingers around the shaft with the thumb overlapping
the index finger. To cut sheet or plate metal with a flat cold
chisel, first clamp the work in a vise. Hold the chisel at a
45-degree angle from the face of the metal, with the bottom bevel
of the cutting edge resting on the top of the vise. Drive the
chisel with a hammer, using a series of even blows, to cut through
the metal. The cut should be made close to the vise jaws. Smooth
the cut edge with a metal file.
</P>
<P>
   To cut round stock, like a rod or a chain link, place the work
on a firm, hard support, like an anvil or a thick piece of flat
steel. If possible, secure the work with a clamp to keep it from
flying away should you direct a glancing blow. Use a triangular
file to mark the cutting line on the stock. Hold the chisel
vertically on the line and strike it with a hammer. Cut halfway
through the piece, then flip it over and cut from the other side.
</P>
<P>
   To make cutouts in sheet metal, first scribe the perimeter of
the cutout on the surface. Then drill a series of overlapping holes
within the outline. The holes should remove enough material from
inside the cutout so you can clean up the edges with a chisel. To
do this, hold the chisel vertically and strike it with a hammer.
Smooth the edges with a file.
</P>
<P>
   You can also use a flat cold chisel to shear off rivets.
Position the chisel at a 45-degree angle against the rivet head.
The bottom bevel of the cutting edge should rest on surface of the
surrounding material. Drive the chisel against the rivet with a
hammer.
</P>
<P>
   The same technique works well with small bolts. For thick bolts,
it may be easier to first split the bolt head. Hold the chisel
vertically over the center of the head and strike with the hammer.
Then shear off each side with the technique just described.
</P>
<P>
   The cape chisel has a thin cutting edge on a wedge-shaped head.
The wedge shape provides extra support for the narrow cutting bit.
Cape chisels are used to cut narrow slots in metal or masonry.
Machinists also use the cape chisel to lock nuts and bolts so they
will not loosen. The technique is simple: the nut is threaded onto
the bolt and tightened with a wrench. The machinist uses the cape
chisel to strike the threads above the nut. This distorts the
threads so the nut cannot work loose. The only way to remove the
nut is by splitting it with a flat chisel.
</P>
<P>
   The round-nose chisel is similar to the cape chisel, but the
cutting edge has a semicircular shape. It is used to cut round
grooves. Round grooves are often cut in bearings for oil channels.
The diamond point chisel has a tapered four-sided cutting bit. It
is used to clear out material in corners and for cutting
V-channels.
</P>
<P>
   While you can use a cold chisel for masonry work, it is easier
to cut into stone, concrete or brick with chisels especially
designed for that purpose. Some mason's chisels, like the brick
chisel (also called a brick bolster), have wide spade bits so you
can chop a brick evenly in half. Another chisel similar in
appearance to the brick chisel is a mason's bolster. It has a wide
flat head and a long handle. Use this chisel to smooth flat stone
surfaces and remove peaks.
</P>
<P>
   For making round holes in concrete or stone, use a star drill.
This tool has a long hexagonal handle, and a cutting bit is in the
shape of a cross or four- pointed star. To drill a hole, hold the
tool vertically and strike with a small sledgehammer. Turn the
drill a quarter turn with each blow, and occasionally stop to blow
the dust and debris from the hole.

THIS BOMB GETS A CHILLY RECEPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By TODD CAMP 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Cuba Gooding Jr. doesn't start making better movie choices,
he might just have to return that Best Supporting Actor Oscar
statue.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, those Pepsi One commercials alone were grounds enough
for disqualification, but after Gooding's forgettable turns in
celluloid stinkers such as ``What Dreams May Come, Instinct'' and
the direct-to-video ``A Murder of Crows,'' that statuette is
starting to look more and more like a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   His credibility gets no help from the lame actioner ``Chill
Factor.''
</P>
<P>
   As Arlo, an ice-cream-truck driver caught up in a web of murder,
terrorism and international arms dealing, Gooding returns to his
familiar bag of tricks: high-speed, high-volume jabbering at the
expense of actually saying anything.
</P>
<P>
   Not that his co-star offers much help. Skeet Ulrich _ think
Johnny Depp, except made out of wood _ is a sullen drifter who
finally settles down, slinging hash in a small-town greasy spoon.
His fishing buddy (David Paymer) is a secretive doctor who works at
the nearby military base. When the doc stumbles in, gut-shot and
bleeding, clutching a metal canister and raving about a lethal
defoliant that explodes once its temperature reaches 50 degrees,
Ulrich hijacks Gooding and his ice-cream truck before the shooters
track them down.
</P>
<P>
   Seems the stuff in the canister not only snuffs out all plant
life in a 100-mile radius, it also turns any humans in the area
into steaming piles of goo. In other words, it'd be a really nifty
weapon if it fell into the wrong hands. In this case, those hands
belong to Peter Firth as a disgraced Army major who crossed to the
dark side after being imprisoned when an early experiment with the
defoliant wiped out his entire platoon.
</P>
<P>
   All the standard action plot devices are here: The
character-flawed good guys barely tolerate each other but learn to
be friends; the bad guy's inherent evil outweighs his common sense;
the naughty henchmen are easily dispatched, despite being trained
killers; and the bomb comes close to detonating half a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   None of the performances is worth mentioning. Even Paymer, who's
always competent even in undemanding roles, walks through his bit
part as the guilt-ridden scientist. And Firth's performance is
steeped in such monotone villainy that Steven Seagal might as well
have played it.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness the bomb effects are cool, but it's too bad it
couldn't disintegrate more of this movie.
</P>

   TV-TELETHON-KANSAS (Undated) _ It's time again for the Jerry
Lewis Show.
</P>
<P>
   Forgive me _ ``The Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon.''
</P>
<P>
   Like a trademark Lewis pratfall, it's a seemingly easy slip to
make.
</P>
<P>
   Starting at 8 p.m. Sunday the 34th annual Labor Day fund-raiser
for the Muscular Dystrophy Association returns with the serious
task of treating and finding a cure for 40 neuromuscular diseases

</P>
<P>
   Yet it's the patently zany Lewis who remains the show's
singularly captivating draw.
</P>
<P>
   Love him or hate him _ and it's fair to speculate that even
detractors of the slapstick icon tune in just to shake their heads
in amazement at his audience-pandering antics _ Lewis is the
telethon. By BRIAN McTAVISH. 1500 words. Story will move in the
``e'' category.

<P>
   FOOD-PBJ-KANSAS (Undated) _ It's practically an American icon,
so just how much liberty can you take with a PB&AMP;J?

<P>
   Nowhere is it written that this kid's classic must consist of
peanut butter and grape jelly on white bread.

   CUTS-MISSOURI: If budget matters stay the way they are, the

INTERNET NOT YET A THREAT TO THE CAMPUS BOOKSTORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DANIELLE FURFARO  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ College bookstores have enjoyed a virtual
monopoly on textbook sales for years. The Internet promised to
change that.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, it's just a promise. A spot check of textbook Web
sites indicates that e-commerce prices are not always cheaper, some
take weeks for delivery and choice is limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to look around in a bookstore where you know you
can find the books you need,'' said Mark Simmons, a junior at the
State University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, professors at SUNY-Albany have given a list of
required and recommended books for each course to the school
bookstore, which is owned by the national retailer Barnes and
Noble. The store then makes sure that it has enough of each book
for all students taking a class.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY-Albany's only competitor for textbooks is Mary Jane Books,
a downtown retailer. However, since the independent textbook store
opened before the spring 1998 semester, most professors have
ignored the store's requests for book lists, making it difficult
for Mary Jane Books to compete with Barnes and Noble. The store has
sent Freedom of Information Act requests to both the administration
and the professors seeking the lists, according to Mary Jane Books
owner Adam Militello.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is still the university that is responsible,''
Militello said. ``It'll be a cold day in hell before I sue a
faculty member.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, several textbook stores and distributors opened
e-commerce sites, with inventories that cover the reading lists of
several courses offered at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Although these sites advertise prices discounted as much as 60
percent, many on-line sites charge higher prices than the Barnes
and Noble store at SUNY-Albany.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``Science of Ecology,'' which is required for a
biology course, costs $89 at the university's bookstore. At
efollett.com, a wholesale bookseller in Illinois, the book costs
$97. The company also charges a minimum shipping fee of $3.95 for
the first book and 95 cents for each additional book in the same
order. It also takes two to three weeks to ship.
</P>
<P>
   There were many books in a survey sample that were not available
from the site or only available new, even though the company bills
itself as the largest wholesaler of used books in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of prices of randomly selected textbooks required
for courses at SUNY-Albany, only one on-line site offered lower
prices than those of Barnes and Noble.
</P>
<P>
   That site is bigwords.com, a startup Internet company in San
Francisco that compiles the reading lists of classes across the
country by contacting professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bookstores of public institutions have to give you the
reading list information, but it usually gets changed after you
receive it,'' said the company's co-founder, John Bates. ``If you
have a good relationship with the professors, they will give you
the updated information.''
</P>
<P>
   The company charges $78.12 for ``Science of Ecology.'' It does
not charge for regular three- to five-day shipping on orders of
more than $35, and there is no state sales tax.

`'TIS' THE SEASON OF NONFICTION AS THE FINAL CHAPTER OF THE 1900S
DRAWS NEAR
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Accompanied by FALL BOOKS-OTHERS) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   'Tis the season when the so-called fall books begin arriving on
bookstore shelves, which this year means essentially that 'tis the
season of `` 'Tis.''
</P>
<P>
   The second installment of New York City
schoolteacher-turned-memoirist Frank McCourt's life story, ``
'Tis'' (Scribner, $28), will go on sale late this month. When it
does, it will instantly rocket to the top of the nonfiction
bestseller list, with just about every one of its 500,000
first-printing copies snapped up by the same readers who made
McCourt's ``Angela's Ashes'' an unexpected, runaway bestseller two
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Then about a month into 2000, `` 'Tis'' probably will be
nominated for all the same prizes ``Angela's Ashes'' vied for, and
might even equal its predecessor by copping the Pulitzer Prize.
</P>
<P>
   So, when the literary smoke clears by the end of the Christmas
shopping season, `` 'Tis'' will probably be the book that was most
talked about, sought and bought.
</P>
<P>
   `` 'Tis'' is the centerpiece of a fall that features nonfiction.
Fans of novels will get their literary fix, but overwhelmingly _ in
number and promotional dollars _ publishers are betting that more
bookstore browsers will prefer real to made-up. It comes down to
the kind of book that publishers believe will sell the best, and
nonfiction wins handily.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fall is the toughest, most competitive season,'' says Sally
Richardson, a senior editor at St. Martin's Press. ``We publishers
all try to put our biggest books by our biggest names out there,
and, in fiction, there just aren't that many big names.''
</P>
<P>
   The publishers' preference for nonfiction is obvious to Michael
Rosenberg, who operates a literary agency in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Publishers believe nonfiction has a clearly defined potential
market,'' he says. ``The subject of a nonfiction book tells them
exactly who they will be selling it to. The market for literary
fiction is much less defined.''
</P>
<P>
   Publishers are more likely to offer fiction during the summer,
when consumers want light fare suitable for reading on airplanes
and under beach umbrellas. Novels generally cost consumers less,
too, because publishers often have to pay heftier advances to
nonfiction writers who require money for extensive research.
</P>
<P>
   But during the Christmas season, publishers believe, the price
of a book is not as important to shoppers. In July, an adult
already paying a significant amount for the family vacation may
consider $25 to be his or her maximum price for a 200-page,
read-on-the-run thriller. But in November, spending $35 for a
weighty, 600-page nonfiction tome to be savored during the winter
months or to be given as a gift does not seem as extravagant.
</P>
<P>
   Famous novelists are represented on the fall '99 list. But with
Patricia Cornwell, Thomas Harris, John Grisham and Mary Higgins
Clark just published this summer, there aren't many left to offer
new titles from September through December.
</P>
<P>
   About 20,000 books will be published between now and Christmas.
Because no list can adequately catalog all of them, we look at 20
titles that are of special interest.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   1. `` 'Tis: A Memoir'' by Frank McCourt (Scribner, $28,
September) _ The subject matter: This picks up where ``Angela's
Ashes'' left off, mostly chronicling McCourt's experiences as a New
York schoolteacher and including some outrageous tales of his
misadventures after marriage. The buzz: No one wonders whether this
book will be a bestseller, especially since it is not necessary to
have first read ``Angela's Ashes'' before diving into this second
installment. The prediction: Pulitzer judges may honor McCourt a
second time. He is a bard in the finest tradition of engaging,
roguish Irish storytellers.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   2. ``Daughter of Fortune,'' by Isabelle Allende (HarperCollins,
$26, October) _ The plot: A young Chilean woman finds and loses
love during the California gold rush, but this novel focuses more
on fiction than fact. Think of ``Gone With the Wind,'' which used
the Civil War as a backdrop for made-up characters. The buzz: Early
reviews are mixed; Allende has been praised in the past for the
complexity of her stories, but she may have burned out her audience
in the process. The prediction: The book will prove to be a
critical and sales disappointment, although Allende's hard-core
fans will probably love it.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   3. ``Hitler's Pope: The Secret History of Pius XII,'' by John
Cornwell (Viking, $29.95, October) _ The subject matter: Historian
Cornwell argues that, during World War II, the Vatican was a covert
ally of Hitler. The buzz: Some publishers have shied away from
similar books, fearing a backlash from Catholics and/or the Holy
See. That means Cornwell has to present a solid, near-unshakable
case. The prediction: Modest but respectable sales that might reach
the lower rungs of the bestseller lists. Critical acclaim is almost
a given.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MORE
nn
</P>
<P>
   4. ``Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban,'' by J.K. Rowling
(Scholastic, $19.95, September) _ The plot: The third installment
of this wildly successful children's series finds gawky apprentice
Harry hanging around incarcerated wizards. The buzz: A month before
publication, ``Prisoner'' is No. 1 on Amazon.com's sales list
(ordered in advance). But the first two books had a certain
sameness, and it seems unlikely that Harry's momentum can sustain
many more runaway bestsellers. The prediction: Pottermania will
wane in 2000; but ``Prisoner'' is being published in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   5. ``Dutch: A Memoir of Ronald Reagan,'' by Edmund Morris
(Random House, $35, September) _ The subject matter: Random House
promises the definitive life of our former president. The buzz:
Morris has been working on this book for 13 years, so Random House
expects that it's going to be really good. It better be. The
prediction: ``Dutch'' will be a critical and sales success, and may
edge `` 'Tis'' for the various nonfiction awards.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   6. ``A Little More About Me,'' by Pam Houston (Norton, $23.95,
October) _ The plot: Norton gathers a dozen first-person Houston
stories that previously appeared in magazines. The buzz: Houston's
first two books, also collections of short stories, got critical
raves but didn't sell. Now Norton is promoting ``A Little More
About Me'' as the ``real'' Pam Houston, although she prefers the
promotional emphasis to be on her fiction. The prediction: Even
Houston's laundry lists would be interesting to read. ``A Little
More About Me'' may hook the public into reading more of her short
stories.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   7. ``The Alibi,'' by Sandra Brown (Warner, $25.95, due in stores
Wednesday) _ The plot: A prosecuting attorney tries to solve the
murder of a local businessman. The prime suspect is a woman whom
the prosecutor met and slept with on the night of the murder. The
buzz: Fort Worth homegirl Brown has written more than 60 books, and
more than half of those have made bestseller lists. Her legions of
readers are devoted. The prediction: After ``The Alibi'' is a
bestseller, it'll be turned into a TV miniseries.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   8. ``Hillary's Choice,'' by Gail Sheehy (Morrow, $21.95,
September) _ The subject matter: Why the first lady stays with her
husband. The buzz: Sheehy's understanding of, if not sympathy for,
Hillary is said to drip from every page. Hillary-haters will
probably call it propaganda. The prediction: The author of
``Passages'' has enough fans to make this a bestseller.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   9. ``Eddie's Bastard,'' by William Kowalski (HarperCollins, $24,
October) _ The plot: A grieving father finds a baby abandoned on
his doorstep; the child turns out to be his grandchild. The buzz:
If HarperCollins is publishing a first novel in the fall, the
company's brain trust must believe it is special. It will promote
``Eddie's Bastard'' for all it's worth. The prediction: Remember
Charles Frazier and ``Cold Mountain''? Karla Kuban and
``Marchlands''? Every once in a while a new novelist emerges from
obscurity, and this may be Kowalski's turn.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   10. ``Walter Benjamin at the Dairy Queen: Reflections at Sixty
and Beyond,'' by Larry McMurtry (Simon &AMP; Schuster, $21, November) _
The subject matter: McMurtry offers essays on middle, maybe even
old, age. The buzz: The author is rumored to be tired of fiction;
his heart bypass surgery made him more conscious of his mortality;
and he is determined to write about his life. The prediction:
Readers love McMurtry, but they love Gus and Call and Danny Deck
and his fictional casts so much more. Self-indulgence may be
tolerated this once, but 2000 will see McMurtry back writing
novels.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   11. ``Big Trouble,'' by Dave Barry (Putnam, $23.95, September) _
The plot: It's far too convoluted to recount. All sorts of wacky
bad guys have weird things happen to them when hit men invade
Coconut Grove. The buzz: This is Barry's first attempt at a
full-length book. His last few collections of humorous columns have
not sold very well, so ``Big Trouble'' is an attempt to freshen his
approach and recapture his audience. The prediction: The book ought
to be successful; book-length Barry is much better and funnier than
most would have expected.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   12. ``Joe DiMaggio: The Hero's Life,'' by Richard Ben Cramer
(Simon &AMP; Schuster, $27.50, September) _ The subject matter: For the
first time, an eminent historian tries to recount the life of the
intensely private, recently deceased Yankee Clipper. The buzz:
Cramer's ``What It Takes'' is still considered by many the
definitive recounting of a modern presidential campaign. This book
will be reviewed by every major print publication, and you won't be
able to read any mainstream magazines without finding it mentioned
somewhere. The prediction: If ``The Hero's Life'' is half as good
as ``What It Takes,'' it will be one of the best books published
this year.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   MORE nn
</P>
<P>
   13. ``A Star Called Henry,'' by Roddy Doyle (Viking, $23.95,
September) _ The plot: A fictional Irish boy experiences his
nation's upheavals in the 1910s and '20s. The buzz: Doyle has been
a novelist with a gold-plated reputation and mediocre sales. Viking
must be wondering what it will take to make him a bestseller. The
prediction: ``A Star Called Henry'' may inch onto the bestseller
list, riding the coattails of `` 'Tis'' in an Irish-themed fall.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   14. ``The Roots Run Deep,'' by J.C. Watts (HarperCollins, $25,
October) _ The subject matter: The University of Oklahoma
quarterback-turned-Republican-congressman tells his life story. The
buzz: Political conservatives buy books in droves; witness the
sales, if not literary success, of Dan Quayle, Newt Gingrich and
Rush Limbaugh. Watts will appeal to that market. The prediction:
Solid sales that will reach bestseller proportions if Watts emerges
as a possible vice-presidential nominee on the 2000 Republican
national ticket.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   15. ``The Way We Lived Then: Recollections of a Well-Known
Name-Dropper,'' by Dominick Dunne (Crown, $27.50, September) _ The
subject matter: Dunne dishes on his experiences as a Hollywood
producer, with humorous emphasis on the downs instead of the ups.
The buzz: Stars love being mentioned in print by Dunne, and he
loves mentioning them. From People to Newsweek, all the slick
magazines will plug ``The Way We Lived Then.'' The prediction: Good
sales and good gossip from the man everybody wants sitting next to
them at a dinner party.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   16. ``Life Stories,'' by Jewel (HarperCollins, $23.95,
September) _ The subject matter: The waifish singer tells about her
short, eventful life. The buzz: It's awful, embarrassing and poorly
written, but so was ``Night Without Armor,'' Jewel's collection of
poetry, and that was a bestseller. The prediction: Around
Christmas, when excellent-but-relatively-unknown writers gripe
about talentless celebrities hogging the bestseller limelight with
their self-indulgent tripe, they'll be talking about Jewel and
``Life Stories.''
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   17. ``The Voyage,'' by Philip Caputo (Knopf, $26, November) _
The plot: As the 1900s draw to a close, the Braithwaite family of
Maine struggles to understand the events at the start of the
century. The buzz: Caputo is regarded by critics as one of
America's finest novelists. His Vietnam epic, ``A Rumor of War,''
is especially admired. But mainstream readers have never caught on,
and ``The Voyage'' is expected to be another of his books that is
critically acclaimed but doesn't sell well. The prediction: Better
late than never. With so little to entice devotees of fiction this
fall, ``The Voyage'' just might get Caputo the attention he
deserves.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   18. ``Peel My Love Like an Onion,'' by Ana Castillo (Doubleday,
$23.95, October) _ The plot: ``La Coja,'' a famous flamenco dancer
in Chicago, has succeeded despite a crippled leg, the result of a
childhood bout with polio. She suddenly finds herself at the center
of a romantic triangle, with her troupe director and his grandson.
The buzz: Castillo gained national attention for ``So Far From
God,'' her last novel. Doubleday is launching a huge national
publicity campaign to make ``Peel My Love'' a bestseller. The
prediction: If Oprah comes calling with a Book Club selection,
everyone will know someone who bought ``Peel My Love.'' Otherwise,
Castillo remains a good writer with a small audience.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   19. ``The Great Shame,'' by Thomas Keneally (Doubleday, $35,
September) _ The subject matter: Eloquent nonfiction about
19th-century Ireland, when the embattled nation lost 50 percent of
its population. The buzz: This one's a slam-dunk; even if ``The
Great Shame'' were bad _ which it isn't _ it would ride
``Schindler's List's'' reputation onto the bestseller list. ``The
prediction: `` 'Tis,'' ``A Star Called Henry'' and ``The Great
Shame'' make the last book cycle of the 1900s an Irish-dominated
one.
</P>
<P>
   _
</P>
<P>
   20. ``The Phantom of Manhattan,'' by Frederick Forsyth (St.
Martin's, $19.95, November) _ The plot: What happened to the
Phantom after that great opera house in Paris burned down? Did Erik
and Christine ever get back together, and where? The buzz:
Forsyth's usual publisher refused to print ``Phantom,'' claiming
fans of the author's spy novels wouldn't be interested in another
kind of story. If ``The Phantom of Manhattan'' flops, Forsyth
probably will never have a non-espionage novel published again. The
prediction: There are enough fans of the Andrew Lloyd Webber
musical to push this book onto the bestseller list, but probably
only to the lowest (15th to 25th) rungs. Jeff Guinn,(817) 390-7720

THIS BOMB GETS A CHILLY RECEPTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If Cuba Gooding Jr. doesn't start making better movie choices,
he might just have to return that Best Supporting Actor Oscar
statue.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, those Pepsi One commercials alone were grounds enough
for disqualification, but after Gooding's forgettable turns in
celluloid stinkers such as ``What Dreams May Come, Instinct'' and
the direct-to-video ``A Murder of Crows,'' that statuette is
starting to look more and more like a fluke.
</P>
<P>
   His credibility gets no help from the lame actioner ``Chill
Factor.''
</P>
<P>
   As Arlo, an ice-cream-truck driver caught up in a web of murder,
terrorism and international arms dealing, Gooding returns to his
familiar bag of tricks: high-speed, high-volume jabbering at the
expense of actually saying anything.
</P>
<P>
   Not that his co-star offers much help. Skeet Ulrich _ think
Johnny Depp, except made out of wood _ is a sullen drifter who
finally settles down, slinging hash in a small-town greasy spoon.
His fishing buddy (David Paymer) is a secretive doctor who works at
the nearby military base. When the doc stumbles in, gut-shot and
bleeding, clutching a metal canister and raving about a lethal
defoliant that explodes once its temperature reaches 50 degrees,
Ulrich hijacks Gooding and his ice-cream truck before the shooters
track them down.
</P>
<P>
   Seems the stuff in the canister not only snuffs out all plant
life in a 100-mile radius, it also turns any humans in the area
into steaming piles of goo. In other words, it'd be a really nifty
weapon if it fell into the wrong hands. In this case, those hands
belong to Peter Firth as a disgraced Army major who crossed to the
dark side after being imprisoned when an early experiment with the
defoliant wiped out his entire platoon.
</P>
<P>
   All the standard action plot devices are here: The
character-flawed good guys barely tolerate each other but learn to
be friends; the bad guy's inherent evil outweighs his common sense;
the naughty henchmen are easily dispatched, despite being trained
killers; and the bomb comes close to detonating half a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   None of the performances is worth mentioning. Even Paymer, who's
always competent even in undemanding roles, walks through his bit
part as the guilt-ridden scientist. And Firth's performance is
steeped in such monotone villainy that Steven Seagal might as well
have played it.
</P>
<P>
   Thank goodness the bomb effects are cool, but it's too bad it
couldn't disintegrate more of this movie.

   &QR;  ``Party Monster'' (unrated) _ New York, the club scene,
mid-'80s. Weird, man. How weird? These so-called club kids _ young,
partying, fame-seeking hedonists whose only talents were outsize
amounts of self-promotion and self-destruction _ became regulars on
``Geraldo.'' In this rivetingly grotesque documentary, Michael Alig
was the biggest no-reason star of all. A gay kid from small-town
Indiana, Alig fled to New York for his 15 minutes of fame and wound
up serving 10 to 20 for the bizarre murder of his roommate. ``Party
Monster,'' which first made waves at the Sundance Film Festival,
traces with a coolly intimate eye the steady, drug-happy unwinding
of Alig from gory ironist to gory killer. Alig and his flamboyantly
misfit crew were so self-absorbed they seemed to videotape and
record almost their every move, giving ``Party Monster'' an eerie,
home-movie air of macabre inevitability. When a fellow club kid
recounts the depths of Alig's awfulness and then giggles to an
unseen interviewer, ``Did I just destroy the whole point of your
documentary?'' he doesn't realize that he's only enhanced it.

the movie that its earlier, creakily quiet incarnation lacked.

 &HT;    Flawless harmonies lift Ronstadt-Harris outing
 &HT;    By Miriam Longino
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you bought February's ``Trio II,'' the superb CD that paired
Linda Ronstadt and Emmylou Harris with Dolly Parton, keep this in
mind: ``Western Wall'' isn't an encore performance. The songs here
are much more experimental and introspective, sparsely produced and
virtually country-free. Most are ballads featuring Ronstadt on lead
vocals, with Harris weaving in haunting harmony.
</P>
<P>
   Without Parton's smoky mountain soprano, however, Harris and
Ronstadt sound much more like a folkie, coffeehouse duo trying out
material on songwriter's night. They've drawn from a who's who of
tunesmiths _ Patty Griffin, Sinead O'Connor, Rosanne Cash, Bruce
Springsteen, Jackson Browne _ and almost self-consciously strive to
make sure nothing is predictable. ``Falling Down'' is layered over
the heart-monitor repetition of a thumping bass. There's a very
long and tedious story song called ``1917'' that's ``The Wreck of
the Edmund Fitzgerald'' on slow speed. Harris/Ronstadt's cover of
Leonard Cohen's ``Sister of Mercy'' is wrapped around a happy
sailor accordion straight out of an Old Spice jingle.
</P>
<P>
   As expected, the vocals are flawless. The duo deserves extra
credit for being bold enough to experiment. But Dolly would have
made this often coldly ethereal outing a bit more down-to-earth.

   &QR;  ROCK
</P>
<P>
   ``Mock Tudor''
</P>
<P>
   Richard Thompson. Capital. 12 tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Grade: B+
</P>
<P>
   It's easy to take Richard Thompson for granted. From his days
with the early-1970s folk-rock troupe Fairport Convention through
his collaborations with former wife Linda Thompson and his solo
career, the London-born guitarist and vocalist has produced such a
consistently stellar body of work that critical praise has become
routine. That's a blessing and a curse _ fans expect him to be
brilliant, and as such he's lost the ability to surprise. ``Mock
Tudor,'' a top-notch collection of muscular, fervently delivered
tunes, will delight many but astonish no one familiar with
Thompson's melancholy-folkie croon, deft guitar playing and
pointed, pessimistic lyrics. As usual, Thompson paints vivid
portraits of fractured relationships (``Dry My Tears and Move
On''), emotional duplicity (``Two-Faced Love'') and wounded
romantics (``Crawl Back Under My Stone''). He's in fine form _ if
only we could listen with new ears.

</P>
<P>
   Grade: C+
</P>
<P>
   What a shame that one of hip-hop's best summer songs arrives not
only at the tail end of the season, but amid such poor company.
Q-Tip's first single away from the oft-touted ``thinking fan's rap
group,'' A Tribe Called Quest, is a clever tale about a
relationship going right that glides along a rubbery bass and
cymbals. Even better, ``Vivrant Thing'' is the first track on this
big-name (LL Cool J, Busta Rhymes, Noreaga) compilation wrangled
together by the successful Violator Records/Management Company.
That means you don't have to bother with the rest of this
well-produced but spotty effort, which suffers from serious hook
deprivation.

FOR THOSE WITH WANDERLUST, DRAW UP A WISH LIST 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN FLINN  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   What's on your travel wish list? If you're like me, you keep
such a list in the back of your mind, a roster of wanderlust
fantasies and yearnings.
</P>
<P>
   A couple of years ago in this space, Tony Wheeler shared the
contents of his travel wish list. You may not have heard of
Wheeler, but you almost certainly use his books. Along with his
wife, Maureen, Wheeler is the founder of Lonely Planet, the
astonishingly successful guidebook series that has changed the way
we all travel. From its first book, produced on a kitchen table in
1972, Lonely Planet has grown to the point where it now covers
virtually every inch of the globe, with more than 400 titles in
print.
</P>
<P>
   As befits a man who, as a small boy, asked Santa Claus for a
globe and a filing cabinet, Wheeler doesn't keep his list in his
head. He used to carry it with him at all times in a small diary;
now he keeps it in a little electronic Palm Pilot.
</P>
<P>
   Wheeler has the money, the freedom and the savviness to travel
just about anywhere he desires, for any length of time, in any
style. It was a little surprising, therefore, to see how
unpretentious and accessible his wish list was.
</P>
<P>
   What also impressed me was the way he was methodically ticking
off the items. There were 15 dream trips on Wheeler's list, and at
the time he'd done five of them.
</P>
<P>
   I ran into Wheeler in Corte Madera last weekend at the Book
Passage Travel Writing Conference and asked him how many more dream
trips he'd crossed off his list. In the two years he's done four
more _ so many that he'll finish them all well before his 60th
birthday. He's already composed a new list.
</P>
<P>
   These are the trips he's already crossed off his list:
</P>
<P>
   1. Visit Angkor Wat, the ancient temple complex in Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   (1992).
</P>
<P>
   2. Drive the Birdsville Track, a four-wheel-drive trip across
the Simpson Desert in the Australian outback. (1993).
</P>
<P>
   3. Drive across America in a Cadillac. (1994).
</P>
<P>
   4. Walk Mont Blanc Circuit, a hiking trip around the highest
peak in the Alps. (1995).
</P>
<P>
   5. Buy a Ferrari. Not travel per se, but transportation. Hey,
the guy can afford it. (1993).
</P>
<P>
   6. Walk the Milford Track, a four-day journey on the South
Island of New Zealand. (1997).
</P>
<P>
   7. Visit Damascus, Syria. (1999).
</P>
<P>
   8. Visit Lhasa, Tibet. (1999).
</P>
<P>
   9. Walk around Mount Kailash, a sacred peak in Tibet that is the
goal of devout Buddhist pilgrims. (1999).
</P>
<P>
   The remaining trips on his original list:
</P>
<P>
   10. Dive the Truk Lagoon in Micronesia.
</P>
<P>
   11. Walk across Hinchinbrook Island, off east coast of
Australia.
</P>
<P>
   12. Drive the Karakorum Highway between Kashgar, in western
China and Islamabad, in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
   13. Cross Russia on the Trans-Siberian Express.
</P>
<P>
   14. Walk the Annapurna Circuit, Nepal's most popular long trek.
</P>
<P>
   15. Drive the Gunbarrel Highway, west of Ayer's Rock in the
Australian outback.
</P>
<P>
   When he's finished the last of these, Wheeler has a new list
ready to go:
</P>
<P>
   1. Visit Alaska. (``I've never been there!'' he says, a little
surprised with himself. ``I'd love to do the Inside Passage.'')
</P>
<P>
   2. Visit the Marquesas aboard the Aranui freighter.
</P>
<P>
   3. Dive the Yongala shipwreck off Townsville, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   4. Drive across Spain.
</P>
<P>
   5. Visit the Falkand Islands.
</P>
<P>
   6. Tour Kakadu National Park at the top of Australia, where
``Crocodile Dundee'' was filmed.
</P>
<P>
   7. Take an opera tour to Verona, Italy.
</P>
<P>
   8. Venice. (``I've only been there on day trips. I'd really like
to spend a couple of nights.'')
</P>
<P>
   9. Timbuktu. (``The name alone conjures up all sorts of exotic
images.'')
</P>
<P>
   10. Ethiopia/Eritrea.
</P>
<P>
   11. Yemen. (``With all those kidnapping stories recently, the
newspapers were calling me up for a comment, and it was
embarrassing to say I'd never been there. So I put it on the
list.'')
</P>
<P>
   12. Walk the pilgrimage route to Santiago de Compostela, Spain.
</P>
<P>
   13. Montana.
</P>
<P>
   14. Tour India by Enfield motorcycle. (``In India they're still
making new versions of this great mid-'50s British motorcycle, and
it would be great fun to tour the country on one.'')
</P>
<P>
   15. Visit Leptis Magna in Libya. (``They say it's the best Roman
ruins in the world.'')

 &HT;    `Babe' invasion: Her voice gives Aguilera an edge
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Fodder for the next ``X-Files'' episode: A top-secret ``babe''
factory where a vaguely sinister elite manufacture innocently cute
yet suspiciously sexy pubescent entertainers programmed to sell
millions of CDs. Guest stars: Dianne Warren and Carson Daly.
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it could happen. Maybe it already has.
</P>
<P>
   The debut of 18-year-old Christina Aguilera, a former
Mouseketeer with a fashionable Hispanic surname and a hairdo
straight out of ``Melrose Place,'' points to such conspiracy. Heir
apparent to Britney Spears' chart dominance, this pouty nymphet
rose to MTV ubiquity touting herself as a ``Genie in a Bottle'' _
one whose vow of chastity could be repealed by someone who knows
how to ``rub me the right way.'' The tune's maybe-yes, maybe-no
tease and rap-tinged R&AMP;B pulse owes a big debt to TLC, the
Atlanta-based trio whose gift is projecting individuality within
clearly regulated formula.
</P>
<P>
   Despite an appealing voice that evokes ``How Will I Know?''-era
Whitney Houston, Aguilera hits the marks without conveying a unique
persona. But, as baby divas go, she's got promise. Vocally, she's
worth at least 2 1/2 Spice Girls.

 &HT;    Vary flavors of liqueur in Mexico treat
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After Melinda Gwitt ate a piece of Tres Leches dessert from a
Mexican grocery store in Atlanta, she wanted to try to duplicate it
at home and e-mailed a recipe request.
</P>
<P>
   This one is from Canyon Cafe, which baked it as a special
Mother's Day treat in May. The restaurant uses Captain Morgan
Spiced Rum as a flavoring and tops it with fresh berries. You can
vary the taste with almost any liqueur or extract (our tester liked
it with Kahlua) and other fresh fruits.
</P>
<P>
   DESSERT
</P>
<P>
   Tres Leches
</P>
<P>
   Makes 12 servings
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 20-25 minutes
</P>
<P>
   6 eggs, separated
</P>
<P>
   1 cup granulated sugar
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup oil
</P>
<P>
   1 cup flour
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup sweetened condensed milk, chilled
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup whole evaporated milk, chilled
</P>
<P>
   3/4 cup heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup Captain Morgan Spiced Rum or a flavored liqueur such as
banana, orange or coffee
</P>
<P>
   6 cups fresh berries
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 325 degrees. Beat egg whites in large bowl until
soft peaks form. With a mixer, beat egg yolks and sugar until light
and lemony in color. Add oil to yolks and slowly mix in the flour
until all is incorporated. Lighten the yolk batter by mixing in a
scoop of egg whites. Fold the lightened batter into the remaining
egg whites, taking care not to overmix and deflate them. Butter a
9-by-9-inch glass baking dish and add the batter to the pan. Bake
until lightly browned on top, about 20 to 25 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Remove from the oven and allow to cool thoroughly on a rack. Do
not remove cake from this pan unless you are going to serve it from
a different dish.
</P>
<P>
   When cooled, punch holes with a fork all over the cake.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the tres leches (three kinds of milk) with rum or liqueur
and pour over cake. Refrigerate for at least two hours or until the
tres leches have saturated the cake and it is chilled throughout.
</P>
<P>
   Using a large ice cream scoop or serving spoon, scoop and serve
in a wide martini glass or bowl and garnish each portion with some
of the sauce from the pan and half a cup of fresh berries.

 &HT;    On a roll: Wrap up a quick, tasty, nutritious meal anytime
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Most supermarkets stock tortillas and a few egg roll wrappers _
the basics for wraps. But if you want more exotic selections, check
out Hispanic and Asian markets. There you'll find different sizes
of tortillas as well as myriad spring roll wrappers that range from
about 8 to more than 30 inches in diameter.
</P>
<P>
   While some chain grocery stores occasionally stock flavored
tortillas, they're often difficult to find. We purchased our
sun-dried tomato and spinach tortillas from Bajarito's on Peachtree
Road.
</P>
<P>
   The Hye Rollers were found in the deli department at Kroger in
Crabapple. They're also available at Harry's Farmers' Markets.
</P>
<P>
   MAIN DISH
</P>
<P>
   Tequila Shrimp Wrap
</P>
<P>
   Makes 6 servings; about 1 cup guacamole
</P>
<P>
   Preparation time: 15-20 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Cooking time: 5 minutes
</P>
<P>
   Set out the tequila shrimp filling and guacamole and let guests
make their own wraps.
</P>
<P>
   For the shrimp filling:
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon olive oil
</P>
<P>
   2 orange bell peppers, cut in strips
</P>
<P>
   2 cloves garlic, crushed
</P>
<P>
   Juice of 1 lime
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons tequila
</P>
<P>
   1 pound small shrimp, peeled
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper to taste
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced fresh cilantro
</P>
<P>
   For the quick guacamole:
</P>
<P>
   2 Haas avocados, cut in large chunks
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   1 clove garlic, crushed
</P>
<P>
   Pinch salt
</P>
<P>
   Few drops green habanero hot sauce
</P>
<P>
   For the shrimp filling: In a medium skillet, heat olive oil over
medium heat. Add the peppers and saute for about 2 minutes, then
add garlic, lime juice and tequila. Saute for 1 minute, then add
shrimp and cook until they turn pink and most of the liquid
evaporates. Remove from heat, season with salt and pepper, then add
cilantro.
</P>
<P>
   For the quick guacamole: Place avocados, lime juice, cilantro,
garlic, salt and hot sauce in the bowl of a food processor. Process
until almost smooth.

 &HT;    Let the good times roll with mix-and-match fillings and
tortillas
 &HT;    By Sabine Morrow
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   While wraps have been the culinary buzz word for several years,
the concept itself is an ancient one. The Chinese have been
wrapping and rolling for centuries _ utilizing everything from
lettuce leaves to rice flour wrappers.
</P>
<P>
   And the French can encase the most pedestrian ingredients in a
lacy crepe, and we call it gourmet. For the Hispanic worker who
carries his midday meal, no utensils are needed. He makes mini
wraps by tearing bite-size bits of tortilla and scooping up rice,
beans and chunks of spicy meats.
</P>
<P>
   Why have we gone wrap crazy? Probably because they provide a
quick meal for those on the go and the combination of fillings _
from the healthy to the decadent _ is limitless. At Bajarito's on
Peachtree Road in Brookhaven, wraps come stuffed with everything
from Thai curry chicken to blackened salmon.
</P>
<P>
   Even kids can join a wrap session. To spice up those school
lunch boxes, consider spreading peanut butter on a flour tortilla,
cut it in half so it's easy to handle, then put some jam in a small
container and let them dip their wrap. Instead of the same old
bread for that tuna salad, give them a tuna wrap using a
whole-wheat tortilla.
</P>
<P>
   Adults might consider throwing a wrap party as a simple,
stress-free way to entertain. Guests help themselves and even fill
their own wraps.
</P>
<P>
   It's also a great way to provide a wide array of flavors for
your company. Even the most finicky diner _ from the vegetarian to
one on a restricted diet _ can combine ingredients to satisfy. Plus
they're easy to handle and leave the host with little mess.
</P>
<P>
   Preparing some of the pre-wrapped selections ahead of time makes
a wrap party even easier.
</P>
<P>
   The Spring Roll Wrappers with Glazed Chicken and Shredded
Cabbage Salad has several steps, but they're still relatively
hassle-free to prepare early in the day.
</P>
<P>
   Hye Rollers, also called caravan sand-
</P>
<P>
   wiches, feature a large, round, flat Armenian bread developed in
a California bakery specifically for rolled or wrapped sandwiches.
In fact, they taste better if made ahead of time so the flavors of
the horseradish-spiked cream cheese, peppers and marinated
artichoke hearts have time to meld. Slice them just before your
guests arrive so they won't dry out.
</P>
<P>
   Tequila Shrimp and Sauteed Veggie fillings use a handful of
ingredients, which can be assembled ahead of time, then quickly
sauteed and set out while your guests mingle. You can make the
accompanying guacamole and yogurt sauce a few hours in advance.
</P>
<P>
   There are no strict rules here, so feel free to mix and match
fillings and wraps. For instance, extra Shredded Cabbage Salad
makes an excellent filling for the flavored tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   Note that some of those colorful tortillas are pretty large and
you want your guests to sample a variety of stuffings and wraps. If
you cut them in half, they can be fashioned into cones that provide
perfect containers for those fillings.
</P>
<P>
   So, just set out your favorite beverages, relax and call that
party a wrap.

WACO AND THE DAVIDIANS' RELIGIOUS RIGHTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (Commentary)  
<TEXT>
<P>

Times Syndicate please contact syndicate sales representative DEBRA
WEYDERT at 732-390-4480)
</P>
<P>
   &UR; By DIANA BUTLER BASS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Most news stories --particularly those involving religion --have
a short shelf life. But six years after the fact, Waco is still
news.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the FBI hinted at what many have speculated: they may
not have been as innocent in the 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian
compound as we were led to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidians, founded in 1934, is a sectarian group of
the Seventh Day Adventist Church. In 1987, David Koresh became one
of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidians believed themselves to be a separate spiritual
nation headed by a prophet. They expected the imminent return of
Christ. Their special status, as forerunners of the Second Coming,
created tension with the surrounding society.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Davidians identified the United States as
``apostate.'' They anticipated a violent confrontation between
themselves and the evil powers.
</P>
<P>
   The government depicted Koresh and the Branch Davidians as a
dangerous ``cult'' akin to Jim Jones and the People's Temple.
Koresh was stockpiling weapons and, most damning, abusing children.
If not stopped, they would commit mass suicide or attack the
surrounding community. Thus, Koresh's religion justified the
government's siege of the compound.
</P>
<P>
   What is odd about the scenario is not Koresh's religion. What is
odd and deeply troublingis what the government did about that
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Koresh and his followers were Christians. They certainly were
not Presbyterians or Baptists, but they believed everything more
mainstream Christians do. And like other Christians do, they
embellished parts of the tradition. The Branch Davidians emphasized
the Book of Revelation, separating themselves from the sinful world
as distinct people. Koresh was their prophet (not a new Messiah)
who helped them interpret scripture and prepare them for their
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Among their more particular beliefs were that Koresh needed to
father 24 children and that the government would one day attack
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidians are best understood as a nonconventional
religion. Such religions are generally the offspring of more
traditional groups. They tend to overemphasize some part of the
tradition, thus creating a ``super pious'' group within the older
institution. Eventually the tension causes them to form a new
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout American history, nonconventional groups have spun
off of nearly every mainstream religion. But Protestantism has been
especially susceptible to the process. And the line between
``mainstream'' and ``nonconventional'' has often been thin.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1830s, for example, Presbyterian minister Charles Finney
led a spectacular series of revivals that resulted in hundreds of
thousands of conversions. Finney's manipulative methods often
produced unusual manifestations such as instantaneous healing and
tongues speaking. Although controversial in his practices, Finney
stayed on this side of the theological law and never significantly
deviated from traditional Protestant doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   One of Finney's followers, John Humphrey Noyes, however,
modified both Christian practice and theology. Noyes believed that
Jesus' Second Coming had already occurred and that Christians had
achieved sinless perfection. Noyes instituted ``biblical
communism'' among his followersincluding the practice of ``complex
marriage'', where everyone in his commune was married to everyone
else.
</P>

   &UR; By DIANA BUTLER BASS &LR;  &QC; 
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
</P>
<P>
   Most news stories --particularly those involving religion --have
a short shelf life. But six years after the fact, Waco is still
news.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the FBI hinted at what many have speculated: they may
not have been as innocent in the 1993 siege of the Branch Davidian
compound as we were led to believe.
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidians, founded in 1934, is a sectarian group of
the Seventh Day Adventist Church. In 1987, David Koresh became one
of their leaders.
</P>
<P>
   The Davidians believed themselves to be a separate spiritual
nation headed by a prophet. They expected the imminent return of
Christ. Their special status, as forerunners of the Second Coming,
created tension with the surrounding society.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Davidians identified the United States as
``apostate.'' They anticipated a violent confrontation between
themselves and the evil powers.
</P>
<P>
   The government depicted Koresh and the Branch Davidians as a
dangerous ``cult'' akin to Jim Jones and the People's Temple.
Koresh was stockpiling weapons and, most damning, abusing children.
If not stopped, they would commit mass suicide or attack the
surrounding community. Thus, Koresh's religion justified the
government's siege of the compound.
</P>
<P>
   What is odd about the scenario is not Koresh's religion. What is
odd and deeply troublingis what the government did about that
religion.
</P>
<P>
   Koresh and his followers were Christians. They certainly were
not Presbyterians or Baptists, but they believed everything more
mainstream Christians do. And like other Christians do, they
embellished parts of the tradition. The Branch Davidians emphasized
the Book of Revelation, separating themselves from the sinful world
as distinct people. Koresh was their prophet (not a new Messiah)
who helped them interpret scripture and prepare them for their
destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Among their more particular beliefs were that Koresh needed to
father 24 children and that the government would one day attack
them.
</P>
<P>
   The Branch Davidians are best understood as a nonconventional
religion. Such religions are generally the offspring of more
traditional groups. They tend to overemphasize some part of the
tradition, thus creating a ``super pious'' group within the older
institution. Eventually the tension causes them to form a new
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout American history, nonconventional groups have spun
off of nearly every mainstream religion. But Protestantism has been
especially susceptible to the process. And the line between
``mainstream'' and ``nonconventional'' has often been thin.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1830s, for example, Presbyterian minister Charles Finney
led a spectacular series of revivals that resulted in hundreds of
thousands of conversions. Finney's manipulative methods often
produced unusual manifestations such as instantaneous healing and
tongues speaking. Although controversial in his practices, Finney
stayed on this side of the theological law and never significantly
deviated from traditional Protestant doctrine.
</P>
<P>
   One of Finney's followers, John Humphrey Noyes, however,
modified both Christian practice and theology. Noyes believed that
Jesus' Second Coming had already occurred and that Christians had
achieved sinless perfection. Noyes instituted ``biblical
communism'' among his followersincluding the practice of ``complex
marriage'', where everyone in his commune was married to everyone
else.
</P>
<P>
   The group, known as the Oneida Community, survived for almost 50
years. They experienced legal persecution (Noyes was indicted on
adultery charges) and informal persecution from neighboring
Christians. But they carried out their religious experiment in
relative peace.
</P>

   LOVERLY CHICKEN
</P>
<P>
   Serves 2
</P>
<P>
   3-pound chicken, cut into pieces
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons butter
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   Salt and pepper
</P>
<P>
   Pinch of grated nutmeg
</P>
<P>
   2 cups half-and-half
</P>
<P>
   12 large mushroom caps
</P>
<P>
   1/2 cup brandy
</P>
<P>
   Pull all fat from body cavity of chicken and melt it in frying
pan large enough to hold chicken pieces. Add 1 tablespoon butter
and the oil. Brown chicken pieces on all sides, adding a little
more butter and oil if necessary to get a good rich color. This
will take about 20 minutes.
</P>
<P>
   Now put chicken pieces in a serving casserole and season lightly
with salt, freshly ground pepper and nutmeg. Set this aside for a
moment while you heat the cream in the same frying pan. Stir well
to pick up all the browned good-bits on the bottom.
</P>
<P>
   Pour cream mixture over chicken pieces and put casserole,
uncovered, into a 350-degree oven. Bake for 1 hour. While chicken
cooks, wash mushroom caps (save the stem for tomorrow). Put 1
teaspoon of remaining butter in hollow of each cap.
</P>
<P>
   When the hour is up and your chicken is done, take out of oven
and distribute mushroom caps over it, butter side up. Turn oven up
to broil or heat broiler if yours is separate. Slide casserole
under broiler and cook mushrooms for about 5 minutes. Take
casserole out and pour brandy over chicken; give it a quick stir to
blend brandy with sauce in casserole and serve. Fluffy white rice
and a pretty vegetable complete this dear little dinner.

<P>
   Judging by commentaries in the Western media, many observers
seem to be equating the hostilities between Russian armed forces
and Muslim separatists in Dagestan with the 1974-'76 war between
Russia and Chechnya.
</P>
<P>
   But despite some superficial similarities, lumping together the
two fights is a mistake.
</P>
<P>
   President Bill Clinton went so far as to liken the Russian
president, Boris Yeltsin, to Abraham Lincoln, a defender of his
nation's integrity, when Yeltsin sent Russian troops into Chechnya
five years ago on a misguided adventure that only made all the
problems in Northern Caucasus far worse than before.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the relatively free Russian media are not even asking
obvious questions that might clarify what's behind the escalating
crisis in Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   For example, how is it that Russia's elite special services and
intelligence organizations failed to foresee or even to monitor the
onslaught of hundreds of armed Chechen fighters led by the warlord
Shamil Basayev into Dagestan? Some Russian troops actually were
withdrawn from Dagestan a few months prior to the rebels' attack.
Why?
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Russia's integrity is hanging in the balance.
During Yeltsin's debacle in Chechnya, the prestige of Russian
troops was badly damaged, but also very significantly, the fighting
fueled the rise of militant Islam there.
</P>
<P>
   Now there are important questions to be asked: Will people in
Dagestan be lured by the siren song of Islamic unity sounded from
Chechnya? Will the call for a free Islamic state win over more than
just a few villages?
</P>
<P>
   Former Prime Minister Sergei V. Stepashin said, just a few hours
before he was fired by Yeltsin: ``We may well lose Dagestan'' _ not
exactly the sort of news the Kremlin wished to hear.
</P>
<P>
   So what happened in Dagestan? And why so much ignorance now
about what's really at stake?
</P>
<P>
   Regrettably, the world's attention span is short, and this part
of the world has not been on everybody's mind. Since 1976, when its
war with Russia ended, victorious Chechnya has turned into a
humanitarian disaster.
</P>
<P>
   The population in Chechnya has dropped from about 1 million to
perhaps 300,000. Its economy has become virtually non-existent.
Theft of oil from the Russian pipeline, robberies, kidnapping,
ambushes and ransom seem to be the only viable industries.
Officially, unemployment in Dagestan amounts to 20 percent;
unofficial figures put it as high as 80 percent. Youth unemployment
stands at about 56 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Russia lost the war, but the Chechnyans cannot win the peace. No
wonder the example of Chechnya has not proved attractive to the
majority of Dagestanis. While the benefits of independence from
Russia remain dubious, the chaos, dislocation and rampant crime in
Chechnya are there for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to Stepashin, the current prime minister, Vladimir
Putin, on Aug. 7, confidently stated that the separatists in
Dagestan would be crushed in two weeks. Moscow did claim victory
over the rebels a little more than two weeks later. As of Aug. 31,
however, the air strikes and artillery raids were raging, with
eight Russian soldiers killed and 31 wounded _ and, by Russia's
count, about 80 rebels dead.
</P>
<P>
   It is true that no government can afford to stand idly by as
bands of armed terrorists try to foist the banner of Islamic
fundamentalism on a population that, for the most part, wants no
part of it. A strong military response is needed, but in Dagestan
it is a disaster to think that will cure the problem.
</P>
<P>
   During the war in Chechnya, many Dagestanis volunteered to fight
the rebels alongside Russian troops. The battle now being fought in
Dagestan is not merely military, and its outcome is by no means
clear.
</P>
<P>
   If Dagestan is vulnerable to fundamentalism, it is not out of
religious ideology. The government needs help in building a better
life for its 2 million people. Its population is a patchwork of 34
ethnic groups. In some villages, the people speak two or three
languages. Stability in such places depends on deft political
footwork but also _ and perhaps most of all _ on economic
prospects.
</P>
<P>
   All of the republics of Russia's Northern Caucasus are in dire
straits. It is here that the Russian government has been failing in
the most miserable way. About 87 percent of Dagestan's budget comes
from Moscow, making the republic virtually dependent. Given the
state of Russia's economy, however, those transfers do not amount
to much.
</P>
<P>
   What is Russia to do? So far as these republics are concerned,
there can be no benign neglect. In fact, neglecting them could have
explosive consequences. Islamic extremism characteristically gains
strength in areas of massive poverty and powerlessness. Moscow
needs to act fast to develop and implement a workable economic
strategy. Yet the government in Moscow can barely take care of
itself.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in this battle, Russia deserves at least moral support
and understanding. In Chechnya the issue was secession; in Dagestan
it is invasion. All of Russia's political parties and leaders,
including critics of the war in Chechnya, have spoken in support of
the efforts to eject the invaders, who include foreign mercenaries,
from Dagestan.
</P>
<P>
   And in the end, even if Russia can come up with a program to
ensure stability and economic control, it is by no means clear that
the people of Dagestan will respond gratefully and reject the call
for Islamic unity.

 &HT;    Bust those blahs by going abroad
 &HT;    By Betty Parham
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   This is a tough season. Somewhere between summer and fall. Maybe
we should call it ``stall.'' The relentless summer heat and
humidity have taken their toll, leaving us wilted and drained.
Battle weary, we crawl out of air-conditioned bunkers trying to
discern the first taste of cool air that will bring the
invigorating energy of autumn _ and not a moment too soon.
</P>
<P>
   We who cook are called upon to help Mother Nature herald the new
season by infusing our fare with an enthusiasm that brings a
renewed taste for life. It's a culinary challenge though, this
``stall.'' Outdoor fare, barbecue, grilling and salads that were so
fresh and exciting just a short while ago are becoming tiresome and
old, yet it's hardly the time for soups and stews.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps now is the perfect time to consider venturing forth into
uncharted territory, seeing the big picture, going global for an
exciting, positive change.
</P>
<P>
   Surfing the Web for recipes, we know, is a fun and somewhat
addicting pastime. But to zero in on the cuisine of far-flung
places, as we imagine what tastes will emerge from unusual
combinations of foods and spices, might be the most fun of all.
</P>
<P>
   &QR;  Start your quest by visiting the Global Gastronomer at www.cs
</P>
<P>
   .yale.edu/(tilde)hupfer/global/gastronomer.html, just for this
opening quote alone. ``To read ... about a country's cuisine isn't
simply to go looking for `good things'; it is also to better know _
by means of the recipes _ the customs and the richness or poverty
of a place, and the spirit of those who inhabit it. It is, above
all, to participate in the symbolic celebration of the shared
repast.''
</P>
<P>
   What follows, though, is a tad disappointing because some of the
links don't work. The map, which asks you to click on any region of
the world and then doesn't take you there, is especially
disappointing. Still, there are some treasures to be found, like an
Egyptian snack called Foul, which mixes mashed fava beans,
tomatoes, green peppers, green onions, olives (green or black)
salt, pepper and cumin lemon, vinegar and olive oil _ all in
amounts to taste.

<P>
   Did you know that Swedes love crawfish? Their signature crawfish
dish, which incidentally contains not a bit of hot stuff, is called
Kraftor and is flavored with dill crowns and anise. For spice you
might consider matching the Kraftor with Lobio, which are the
spice-laden red beans from the republic of Georgia.

DIGITAL THEME PARK WHERE POKEMON ROAM 
</HEADLINE>
   (Circuits)  
(jt) 
 By J.C. HERZ   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After imitating the Magic Kingdom for years, Nintendo has
finally out-Disneyed Disney. With Pokemon Island, the Japanese
software company has taken the idea of a synthetic, self-contained
tourist environment to its logical extreme.
</P>
<P>
   As the setting for Nintendo's best-selling Pokemon Snap game,
Pokemon Island is a digital theme park where ``wild'' Pokemon roam
``free'' in their ``natural'' habitat. As a young photographer
employed by Professor Oak (who appears elsewhere in Nintendo's
ever-expanding Pokemon universe), it is your job to capture all of
the island's Pokemon species on film.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought of asking Pokemon trainers to help me,'' he writes
in an introductory letter. ``But I am afraid they would become too
interested in catching the Pokemon on the island. If that happened,
the number of Pokemon on the island would decrease, and Pokemon
Island would lose its value.''
</P>
<P>
   As a precious natural resource, Pokemon biodiversity must be
preserved (as we all know, the creatures are teetering on the brink
of extinction). And because Pokemon Island is such a fragile
ecosystem, you can't really roam around _ your vehicle is either on
rails or floating slowly down a river.
</P>
<P>
   It's less like a National Geographic safari than like a visit to
Pirates of the Caribbean at Disney World, since Pokemon are more or
less animatronic. Strategically planted along a predetermined
route, they are timed to behave adorably within eyeshot of your
hover-buggy.
</P>
<P>
   They're there to pose for you, and they are staggeringly good at
it. Like well-trained babies in television commercials, Pokemon are
hyperbolically cute. As the virtual shutter fires and the motor
drive sound effect kicks in, their antics seem to intensify. You
feel like Austin Powers at a Teletubbies fashion shoot. (``Peek out
from behind the rock. Gorgeous! Show me paws! Yeah, baby!'')
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon Snap may be the first video game whose object is to
document a virtual environment. Instead of accumulating objects,
you accumulate images that are evaluated later, back at the lab,
where Professor Oak rates them for content and composition.
</P>
<P>
   If the subject takes up most of the frame, you get more points.
If it's striking an active pose, you get more points. If it's
centered, the image score doubles. The professor's Pokemon index
has room for only one image of each species, so the cumulative
score rises as you substitute larger, more perfectly centered
photos for inferior images.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, if you happen to like a snapshot in which the subject
does not dominate the center of the frame, you can save it in a
personal album, along with your personal comments.
</P>
<P>
   And for $3, you can buy a smart card at your local Blockbuster
video store and print that image on a sheet of 16 stickers that you
can trade with your friends. There are five smart cards with
different pictures on them, and naturally these are also
collectible objects. (The Pokemon marketing machine rolls along
with Borg-like momentum.)
</P>
<P>
   Because it's a Pokemon product, the cartridge sells things, of
course. But what's really provocative is its near-perfect
simulation of the modern tourist experience. Pokemon Snap is media
filtered through media. It's a trip you take through a photographic
viewfinder, with a game controller, on your television. Your score
depends entirely on what you record. None of your experiences count
unless you get them on camera, and the end product _ the ultimate
goal _ is hard evidence of your excursion.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, it's on rails. But so are most package tours. Sure, it's
an on-screen experience. But go to any popular tourist destination
and you'll see squads of people with camcorders, and for them the
trip is also an on-screen experience. And to many of them, it's
worth more as a set of videotapes or photographs that can be
experienced by their friends and family, as images that can be
printed out, posted and sent via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Pokemon Island is a fantasy environment. But so is Universal
Studios.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, Pokemon Snap feels like a more authentic experience,
perhaps because what you see is really what you get. The simulation
that has been engineered for you, the illusion that theme parks
strive so hard to achieve, is uncluttered by the artifacts they
strive so hard to eliminate: trash, bad weather, broken rides, long
lines and the chance that anything untoward will happen before you
get home to process your film. As a theme experience, Pokemon
Island is pure signal, zero noise.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the environment is a simulation of nature. But
the San Diego Wild Animal Park is also a simulation of nature.
Nintendo's creatures are marketing mascots. But so are lions and
tigers. Like Pokemon, lions and tigers belong to institutions that
make money because people want to see charismatic fauna. The
difference, from a business standpoint, is that no one owns the
idea of a zebra, whereas Pokemon are the intellectual property of
Nintendo.
</P>
<P>
   Most kids would be more upset about the disappearance of Pokemon
than by the disappearance of zebras. Pokemon are a part of their
lives in a way that zebras are not. Pokemon Island is more real to
them than Kenya.
</P>
<P>
   It's true that the only way for a child to experience Pokemon
Island's wild animals is through media. But for most children,
that's the case for African highland gorillas as well. Practically
speaking, gorillas are a media experience, no less than the
jigglypuffs and charmanders and metapods that populate Pokemon
Island. As a kid, you experience gorillas when your mom buys a
National Geographic special at Blockbuster.
</P>
<P>
   I'll bet that Pokemon outlast gorillas.

<P>
   This was a summer of roses for Carol and Millard Prisant, a
couple on New York's Long Island who vacationed at home by simply
stepping through the screen doors onto their rose-bedecked
wraparound porch and drinking in a view of the long harbor in their
backyard. Maybe their part of the North Shore had a faster social
engine when Gatsby partied in the Eggs along with the Fricks and
the Morgans, but time is surprisingly slow even in 1999.
Butterflies flirt with the phlox. Canada geese groom themselves on
a rolling lawn swept by weeping willows. There are spired chairs in
the Gothic-style dining room, a dinghy in the boathouse, and a
lavender 1950s kitchen waiting for Loretta Young to pour pink
lemonade.
</P>
<P>
   If the house and setting seem like a pocket of perfection
suspended in time, there are two reasons, separated by more than a
hundred years. First, the house was conceived in 1862 as the
country house of the future. Designed by Staten Island architect
Frederick S. Copley, it was published in ``Woodward's Country
Houses'' with plans and lengthy descriptions of its many
innovations, including its picture windows and geometrically
patterned tile floors.
</P>
<P>
   The three-story structure with curved Flemish gables was a model
of Romantic architecture in New York's emerging steamboat suburbs
in the mid-19th century. Cast-iron birdhouses, now collectors'
items, were copied from published plans for the house, and a
succession of residents, including Rear Adm. William Emory, Gen.
John Pershing and John Demarest, the developer of Forest Hills
Gardens, hung their hats in the central hall. (Emory's sea chest is
still lodged in the attic.)
</P>
<P>
   The second reason the house seems perfect is that the Prisants _
he is a former rocket scientist who now owns an aerospace hardware
company; she is the New York editor of World of Interiors magazine
_ have restored it to the ideal from which it had sadly lapsed. Its
documentation gave the Prisants an unusually clear road map.
</P>
<P>
   They thought it would take a great deal of money to restore the
14-room house. ``It didn't,'' Mrs. Prisant said, ``because we did
most of the work ourselves. I say `most' because I don't lay
tile.'' Over seven years, they spent $125,000 painting the exterior
and interior, scraping and staining mahogany floors, replastering
ceilings, bleaching marble mantles, adding moldings. But her
husband was initially reluctant. ``Actually, the poor man had just
finished the other house when I dragged him kicking and screaming
to this,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The other house'' was a small Greek Revival they had spent
years of weekends restoring in the same North Shore town. But one
evening, a fellow preservationist whispered to Mrs. Prisant that
the owner of the neighborhood landmark was selling.
</P>
<P>
   ``She told me, `But don't go now, you don't want to see it in
the dark,''' said Mrs. Prisant, who answered, `` `Oh yes I do.'''
</P>
<P>
   ``You see, I'd been in the house and I already knew I was going
to buy it before I drove down the driveway.'' She paused.
``Millard, however, didn't know.''
</P>
<P>
   This down-at-the-heels architectural dowager was threatened by a
developer who planned to subdivide the property and build a couple
of ranch houses. ``We bought it to save the house, yes, but also
because it was beautiful,'' she said, serving iced tea on the north
porch, within earshot of a Victorian cast-iron fountain the
Prisants have just erected from parts found on antiquing forays.
</P>
<P>
   The quietly eccentric Mrs. Prisant liked the many-gabled
profile, and she admired the 11-foot ceilings and the proportions.
She could see the charms of the property even though the
landscaping, done by the Olmsted Brothers, sons of the designer of
Manhattan's Central Park, was threadbare. ``It seems it had been on
the market for some time because most women loved it, and most
husbands went ashen _ as did mine,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Prisant said: ``My wife looks for trouble and I don't. I like to
repair things and put them to bed and then enjoy them. If she's not
fixing something, she's not happy.''
</P>
<P>
   The Prisants _ and their Jack Russell terrier, Cosi Fan Tutti _
moved in right away even though the house wasn't really livable.
``Millard stopped talking to me for quite a while,'' she said.
Prisant only relented when, in a Keystone Cops scenario, the
plaster ceiling in the kitchen collapsed onto the canvas covering
placed overhead. ``It was the first time he laughed in months,''
she said.
</P>
<P>
   Prisant presides over what may be one of the best-equipped
private tool rooms on Long Island, arranged by department, as in a
hardware store: plumbing, carpentry, electricity. ``Millard and I
have a division of labor,'' she said. ``I do `pretty' and he does
`functional.' He's the engineer and I'm the artist.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Prisant summarized: ``It's been a cementing experience for
my husband and me, because we complement each other's talents. We
really have the house in common. Your only child is grown and gone,
so you adopt and dress this house and educate yourself about it.''
</P>
<P>
   While Prisant jacked up the porch and secured failing beams, she
focused on the faux finishes, reading a book called ``Parry's
Graining and Marbling'' to teach herself marbleizing techniques.
``It didn't take patience, it was therapy,'' she said. ``But it
took years before my knees got over it.''
</P>
<P>
   They had some helpers. ``An illegal Irishman, that was the
extent of our work force,'' she said. Prisant, who acted as foreman
and engineer as well as laborer, noted, ``Hiring someone who could
learn skills was much less expensive than using a trained carpenter
at $20 an hour.'' They also hired a painter for the exterior, and
their grown son, Barden, an art appraiser in New York, often
pitched in. The idiosyncratic nature of the house, as well as the
cost, dissuaded Prisant from working with a contractor.
``Contractors know it all,'' he said. ``They won't listen to you.''

 UNDATED: to you.''  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Instead, Prisant restored old plaster (he recommends a roll-on
wallpaper paste called Glidewall to stabilize things) and literally
jumped on the restored porch to tamp it down to the right level.
Luckily, the plumbing was sound. ``It's wonderful what you can do
when you don't have to put in new kitchens and bathrooms,'' Mrs.
Prisant said. ``The seven bathrooms were old but perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   The pair chose their battles, focusing on restoring only the
dining room, front parlor and hallway _ ``as it would have been
furnished in the 1860s by someone who was nouveau riche,'' Mrs.
Prisant said wryly. ``People who come here are appalled. I'm
careful to explain this is not my taste.'' She really favors spare,
disciplined Greek Revival, but the couple resolved to respect the
house, which merited a historically correct treatment. ``We did a
lot of research on the period in order to do a really accurate
job,'' she continued. ``That was the greatest fun, and that's what
took so long.''
</P>
<P>
   The couple studied Lyndhurst, a Gothic Revival house of the same
period on the Hudson, and consulted with the Metropolitan Museum of
Art, through which they located H.&AMP; R. Johnson Tiles Ltd., a
manufacturer in Stoke-on-Trent, England, that was still producing
the encaustic floors made of durable integrally colored
brown-mustard-and-rust ceramic tiles first fabricated in the 19th
century. ``You send measurements, and they send you the
computerized printouts of your floor in that pattern,'' Mrs.
Prisant said.
</P>
<P>
   Until her back gave out about two decades ago, Mrs. Prisant,
author of ``The Antiques Roadshow Primer'' (Workman Publishing, due
this Christmas), had been an antiques dealer and appraiser in
Locust Valley. Through her Rolodex and acumen, she found furniture
that evoked the eclectic Victorian period. The pointed arches over
the doorways in the dining room, though Tudor, suggested a
Gothic-style decor appropriate for the period.
</P>
<P>
   She collected an ensemble of dark, carved pieces _ chairs,
etageres and a four-pedestal mahogany table _ arranged under
plaster tracery bought from a catalog and screwed into place by
Prisant. The English Regency chaise in the front parlor and an
elaborate Victorian side cabinet (``meant to show how rich you
are,'' Mrs. Prisant said mischievously) establish a formality in
the front parlor that is daunting even to the homeowners, who never
use the room, ``which is how it would have been,'' she said,
adding, ``The front parlor was strictly for guests; the family
lived in the back parlor.''
</P>
<P>
   The carpet is based on a 19th-century pattern still produced by
the original English company, with only 6 colors instead of the
original 12. ``At every step I was limited by what was available,''
she said of a carpet without subtle color gradations. ``The carpet
is simpler than it should have been, and less lifelike as a
result.''
</P>
<P>
   The Prisants often improvised. The striped wallpaper, when it
arrived after a six-month wait, was the wrong color, so the couple
sent it back and painted their own camel stripes on yellow parlor
walls, using automobile masking tape. The couple designed the
monumental valances by cutting templates out of cardboard and
having a woodworker construct the actual valance.
</P>
<P>
   The couple left some rooms, like the specimen 1950s kitchen with
its 1954 Caloric stove, just as they found them, but for new paint.
The back parlor and bedrooms are comfortably furnished with roomy
chairs upholstered in floral fabrics.
</P>
<P>
   The 19th century French novelist Gustave Flaubert said that the
one unforgivable literary flaw is a lapse in tone, but Mrs. Prisant
deploys lapses as a design strategy. ``I didn't want people to be
intimidated by the house, even though it looks so museum-like,''
she said. ``I thought there should be some whimsy, some fun.''
</P>
<P>
   A cartoon about tag sales, in a period picture frame, a bronze
plaque on the front porch announcing ``Cave Canem'' (beware of the
dog), and a tin Christmas ornament, shaped like a dog, hanging from
a Gothic-style bronze chandelier in the hall, all imply a blithe
spirit.``I don't want to be taken as seriously as the house would
imply,'' Mrs. Prisant said. ``If you look carefully, you'd know
you're not in a stuffy house.''

 FAST BOATS and BIG FLOPPING FISH  
 &HT;     (This article has already moved to Centerpiece clients. To
publish as a ``separate buy'' article, it must be purchased _ the
rate is not prohibitive _ from one of these New York Times
Syndicate sales representatives: 
 &HT;    (--U.S. and Canada: DEBRA WEYDERT in New Jersey at

 &HT;    (--Latin America: OLIVIA VASQUEZ in Los Angeles, 310-996-0075;
fax, 310-996-0089.  By JAMES GORMAN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It is dawn in the delta, and the heat is already building. We're
just south of New Orleans on Lake Salvador, with the rising sun
behind us and the setting moon ahead, when it occurs to me that my
life could be in danger.
 &HT;    We're going 70 miles an hour in an open boat with no seat belts
and no helmets. Suppose I fly out of the boat and land on my head.
What will my life preserver do? Make my corpse float?
 &HT;    I take a quick look at Michael Iaconelli, who is driving the
boat. His hair and face are flattened by the wind. He looks as if
he has had a bad face lift. The noise is such that if I were to
shout, ``I don't want to die,'' he wouldn't hear me. I wouldn't
hear myself. And the request would be pointless anyway.
 &HT;    Iaconelli is a professional bass fisherman, this is the first
day of a three-day tournament and every minute between us and our
destination is another minute between him and $100,000. Maybe $1
million if you count endorsements.
 &HT;    This is the 29th annual Bass Masters Classic, a competition
billed by its organizers, the Bass Anglers Sportsman Society
(BASS), as the Super Bowl of bass fishing. Forty-five fishermen,
presumably the 45 best bass fishermen in the entire universe, have
come to Louisiana to spend three days racing around the networks of
canals, bayous and lakes of the Mississippi Delta catching
largemouth black bass and bringing them back to New Orleans so the
fish can be weighed - dripping wet and wriggling - under the lights
in the Louisiana Superdome to the cheers and whistles of the
faithful. Most pounds of fish over three days wins a hundred grand.
 &HT;    It is hard to find a sport comparable to professional bass
fishing. Nascar drivers probably have as many sponsor patches on
their shirts. But there are no fish. There are weigh-ins in boxing,
but again, no fish. There may well be fish in professional
wrestling, for all I know, but there is no boat racing.
 &HT;    Professional bass fishing _ the pursuit, for fame and money, of
Micropterus salmoides _ is sui generis. Or, as Denny Brauer, the
winner of last year's classic who got his face on a Wheaties box
for his achievements, says of his chosen sport, ``I think it kind
of sits there by itself.''
 &HT;    Here's how it works: In BASS tournaments, each competitor has an
observer in the boat with him (in this case, a member of the media,
which serves the dual purpose of preventing cheating and getting
publicity). The competitors have a set amount of time to fish each
day.
 &HT;    On the first day, we leave at 6:30 and have to be back by 2:30.
The goal is to come back with the five biggest bass you can catch,
using artificial lures - no worms, minnows or ducklings allowed.
Each boat, a brand-new top-of-the-line model provided for the
classic, is equipped with an aerated well, a kind of aquarium
without glass, to keep fish alive.
 &HT;    You can keep only five fish, but once you've got that many, you
can keep fishing to try to catch bigger fish. If you put a new one
in the well, you've got to let one go. At the end of the day, all
the fish are weighed and eventually taken back to the bayous and
released.
 &HT;    Over the last few decades, professional bass fishing has grown
in glitz and glory. BASS is a profit-making organization that
encompasses several magazines, a TV show, conservation
organizations, a network of fishing clubs and more than one
professional tour.
 &HT;    A competing organization, Operation Bass, runs another series of
tournaments, including the Wal-Mart FLW tour, which offers an even
bigger first prize than the classic, $250,000. It is the battle of
the marts: Kmart supports BASS, Wal-Mart supports Operation Bass.
The prize money is only part of it. Professional fishermen endorse
equipment, write books, act as hosts of fishing shows on
television.
 &HT;    Of course, those are the few at the top. Pete Gluszek, a young
New Jersey fisherman who left a job in engineering to fish, says
that successful full-time professionals are likely to earn,
depending on the year, something between $40,000 and $100,000.
 &HT;    The pros are just the tip of the iceberg, the ones who help sell
equipment to the weekend anglers, who support, according to BASS, a
$46 billion industry. (That probably includes all the
cheeseburgers, beer and nachos that anglers buy on their way to and
from the lake.)
 &HT;    Iaconelli, 27, has been gradually working his way up the
iceberg. He fished amateur tournaments for years and then started
on a professional tour, going from tournament to tournament, across
the country, in 1997. He won a major competition in May on the Red
River in Louisiana, which got him into the classic.
 &HT;    He is not one of the slow-talking Southerners who still dominate
the sport. He is a fast-talking, intense, summa cum laude graduate
of Rowan University, in New Jersey. When he is not fishing, he
manages the fishing-tackle department in a sports store. He leaves
as little as possible to chance. In a week's exploratory fishing a
month before the tournament, he picked one bend of the Orange Grove
Canal as the area he would fish. It is about 65 miles from the
launch.
 &HT;    Forty minutes into our trip, Iaconelli slows to an idle, and I
reach back to unscrew an aluminum light pole from the back of the
boat so we can fit under a low bridge. The pole won't come loose.
 &HT;    He turns off the motor, jumps back to the stern, gives the light
pole a twist, finds it won't yield to him either and breaks it off,
snapping the aluminum, tearing the wires and cutting his finger. We
pass under the bridge and immediately speed up again, although the
canal is narrower and we sometimes have to drop below 60 mph. We're
halfway there.
 &HT;    When we finally stop, the quiet is a shock, the cessation of
wind roar seems like a slap in the face. Suddenly there is no sound
other than the water lapping against the boat, the occasional frog
croaking and the all-but-imperceptible hum of the electric trolling
motor.
 &HT;    It is now 7:30. We are in a canal, with a few docks and
ramshackle fishing camps set out over the water. The banks are
clogged with water hyacinths, an invasive plant that obstructs
navigation but that the bass love.
 &HT;    Iaconelli doesn't talk as he fishes. He runs the trolling motor
with a foot pedal, easing the boat along while he uses underhand
casts to make a lure called a jig float an inch above the water for
20 or 30 feet and then slip through the surface without a splash.
 &HT;    He catches one bass just before 8 and then nothing except a gar
(only bass count) for the next hour and a half. If possible, the
swamp grows more quiet still. Occasionally we move. I watch a heron
fishing in the shallows. A big alligator swims by. Schools of
mullet leap into the air.
 &HT;    Iaconelli methodically pitches the jig to the edge of the weeds,
letting it bump on the bottom once or twice and retrieving it to
cast again. When he is done with the jig, he tries other lures in
the open water, an imitation minnow called a crankbait and a bit of
wire, flashing spoons and plastic skirt called a spinnerbait.
 &HT;    At 9:30 his luck changes. Off a point where one canal runs into
another, he catches one small fish and then quickly another larger
fish, about three pounds. Each is in the boat and in the live well
in seconds.
 &HT;    ``See the current come out of there,'' he says, excitement in
his voice. ``That is a good thing. That is a very good thing. That
is a great thing.''
 &HT;    By 9:45 he has five fish over 12 inches, all in the live well.
He has reached his limit, but he needs more weight. When he catches
a big-bellied four-pounder, he turns ecstatic. ``Thank you, Lord -
thank you, Lord,'' he says, pumping his fist on the bow of the boat
and shaking my hand. ``That's what I needed. Thank you, Jesus.''
 &HT;    As he starts fishing again, he is suddenly talkative. ``Remember
I was telling you about that buzz feeling,'' he says, referring to
the athlete's sense of being in the zone, of being able to do no
wrong, ``I got it now.''
 &HT;    By the time we head back, he estimates that he has a good 15
pounds, his goal for each day. He and other anglers are estimating
that 45 pounds will win the competition. He turns on the motor, and
we are off. I watch the speedometer carefully. When it edges over
75, I turn away and contemplate the unsung virtues of rowboats.
 &HT;    By 4 p.m. the show is beginning at the Superdome. The bass are
still in the live wells in each boat. The trucks that have pulled
the boats on their trailers to and from the launch are lined up
waiting to be washed and polished before they take a lap around the
Superdome stage, with each fisherman waving to the crowd like a
teen-age beauty queen. By the final day, BASS estimates 28,000
spectators are in the dome. Today, my guess is that the
sectioned-off stands are less than a quarter full.
 &HT;    Denny Brauer, last year's champion, comes in with 14 pounds 4
ounces. A few do better; most do worse. The fishermen pull their
fish out of the live wells and hold them up for the cameras. Then
they step up to the microphone, carrying the fish in a mesh bag,
and stand, sunburned after a day on the water, to name lure, rod
and line manufacturer and to praise the boat and motor the way
actors thank their parents when they win the Oscar.
 &HT;    Iaconelli's fish weigh in at 15 pounds 1 ounce. The hero of the
day, Jack Wade, has 16 pounds 13 ounces. But Iaconelli is one of
the Top 5, and the next day, BASS photo boats will follow him.
 &HT;    But the next day, a new leader, Davy Hite, comes in with 19
pounds 3 ounces, a huge haul. Iaconelli brings in 11 pounds 5
ounces, well short of his goal, and drops to eighth. And on the
final day, Hite scores again with 19 pounds 14 ounces and wins
handily.
 &HT;    Iaconelli comes in sixth, well ahead of many more experienced
fishermen. He had hoped for the Top 5, but he is pleased with his
showing and ready for the next tournament. He is not planning to
get rich yet. His winnings come to $6,000. ``If I can make a
living,'' he says, that will be good enough. ``This is what I love
to do.''
 &HT;    When the Top 5 fishermen are interviewed after the weigh-ins,
they explain how they caught their fish. Hite, from Prosperity,
S.C., credits the tackle he used, but he is refreshingly honest
about the real secret to his victory. It was a tip from a local, he
says, from the stage.
 &HT;    A Louisiana friend told him that a spot near Bayou Boeuf was a
good one. And that, as it turns out, is where the big ones were.

FILLING UP ON GAS, AND WEB ADS

<P>
   Gas pumps are no strangers to advertising. Their nozzle handles
have long been adorned with junk food ads encased in clear plastic.
And their sheet metal bases often serve as tiny billboards.
</P>
<P>
   So it should come as no surprise that an evolution in gasoline
pump advertising will start making its way across the United States
this fall. The Internet-linked gasoline pump _ called, perhaps
predictably, the Millennium Series by one maker _ will turn those
pitches for salty foods and sugary drinks into multimedia
extravaganzas of sorts.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look back at the history of the gasoline pump, you can
see a clear development of their technology from purely dispensing
gasoline to a number of other functions,'' said Douglas Pinner, the
chairman and chief executive of the Tokheim Corp., a gas pump maker
in Fort Wayne, Ind. ``At the same time you clearly see the advent
of utilizing the dispenser as a marketing device.''
</P>
<P>
   Tokheim's new Millennium pumps _ which BP Amoco will test this
fall before a broad rollout next year _ will be stuffed with
individual stripped-down computers and touch-screen controls. And
much like computers in, say, a law office, the pumps will be
connected into a local area network controlled by a more powerful
central computer that will make the link to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Pinner said most customers visiting Tokheim's Web browsing pumps
would see banner ads above the display's on-screen pump controls or
around weather forecasts, traffic reports or local hotel lists if
those options are selected. Ads will flood the pump's full screen
only when customers press on banner ads promoting discount coupons
for items in the station's convenience store. The coupons will be
produced by an in-pump printer.
</P>
<P>
   The browser will work only while gasoline is being pumped and
will not allow customers to check e-mail or search for Web pages of
their own choosing.
</P>
<P>
   Tokheim's basic technology, which it developed in conjunction
with Radiant Systems Inc., a provider of computer systems and
software for retailers in Alpharetta, Ga., is largely the same in
concept as a system now being field-tested in Kitchener, Ontario,
by the Time Line Media Corp., a small software maker for the
petroleum industry.
</P>
<P>
   At a Pioneer gasoline station currently testing a Time Line
system that retrofits existing pumps, consumers are treated, or
perhaps subjected, to full-motion video ads for things like cell
phone service and a local theme park. Time Line also mixes news
headlines, weather and traffic with the ads. Its president, John
Lowndes, said he hoped to make its sponsors' messages appealing by
using cameras to target specific ads to different vehicle types.
</P>
<P>
   Tokheim and Time Line vary when it comes to the issue of how
much advertising motorists will tolerate as they fill their tanks.
Pinner said the advertising on Tokheim pumps would be ``very
subtle'' because Tokheim's research showed that customers did not
want to be inundated with advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Lowndes said he hoped that pumps could also serve as electronic
commerce sites for a variety of services, accepting, for example,
orders for florists or payments for parking tickets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at a gas station as a community access point.'' He
acknowledged, however, that giving customers a reason to linger at
do-everything pumps could lead to congestion and could ultimately
undermine the station's ability to sell gasoline.

 By JULIA REED  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    It is a hot summer Sunday in the Hamptons, and I am spending the
day with Barbara Smith, the restaurateur and cookbook author, the
host of a nationally syndicated television show, ``B. Smith, With
Style,'' and the editor in chief of an upcoming magazine, that will
bear her brandlike name.
 &HT;    Her house in Sag Harbor, with its stunning views of the water,
its enormous deck and two kitchens, is therefore more than just a
house; it's also a set. But today it is a bit of a mess.
 &HT;    Outside, huge pots are filled with nasturtiums that are
predominantly dead. Inside, Smith, who is preparing for a photo
shoot, runs between the bathroom, where she is doing her own
makeup, and the basement, where she is ironing her own clothes.
 &HT;    ``At the restaurants I call myself the producer, the director,
the casting agent and the star,'' she says.
 &HT;    Lunch consists of cheeses her husband and business partner, Dan
Gasby, has apparently just run out and bought, garnished with some
slightly withered cherry tomatoes, some mostly brown seedless
grapes and an incongruous bowl of seaweed salad. There is nothing
else edible in her refrigerator _ when I check the contents, I find
a jar of French's mustard, a bottle of Wish-Bone Ranch salad
dressing, a bottle of Wish-Bone Fat Free Caesar, beer, bottled
water and a case of Champagne.
 &HT;    It seems that the woman who is struggling to build an empire by
telling people what to cook, how to entertain, how to fix up their
homes and how to become more fashionable is too busy right now to
do it herself _ which is part of her charm.
 &HT;    You can't quite imagine Smith's East Hampton neighbor Martha
Stewart putting out less than pristine (or even store-bought)
tomatoes or, for that matter, ironing her own clothes. Stewart
gives off an air of impenetrable perfection with a whiff of
privilege _ which is not part of her charm.
 &HT;    Smith is more like Everywoman _ except she also happens to be
black. And her success, so far, has reflected the growing influence
of the black professional class. In 1997, black consumers spent
nearly $500 billion annually on goods and services, 54 percent more
than they had in 1990. And the number of black households earning
$100,000 or more nearly doubled from 1988 to 1998, from 220,400 to
414,500.
 &HT;    A writer like Terry McMillan can land on the best-seller list,
as she did with her 1992 novel, ``Waiting to Exhale,'' by appealing
largely to a black (female) audience. All of which may help explain
why American Express Publishing is putting out B. Smith Style, the
magazine, in late October, and why Random House, the same week, is
releasing ``B. Smith: Rituals and Celebrations,'' part of a
four-book deal.
 &HT;    Smith is already a star in the black community. A former model
who began using her initial in the 1970s when she phoned in for
appointments at the prestigious Wilhelmina agency, she was the
second African-American to grace the cover of Mademoiselle
magazine, in 1976.
 &HT;    In the mid-1980s, she became a partner in a Manhattan
restaurant, B. Smith, and now owns two more outright _ one at Union
Station, in Washington, and the other on the wharf in Sag Harbor.
Her book ''B. Smith's Entertaining and Cooking for Friends,''
published in 1995, was among the first on entertaining by a black
author.
 &HT;    ``Her restaurants are the black '21' clubs, the places to see
and be seen,'' says Lawrence Otis Graham, author of ``Our Kind of
People: Inside America's Black Upper Class.'' ``People know that if
they go there, they're going to run into the right people, the
black folks you know from the Links and the Boule and Jack and
Jill,'' the exclusive black clubs. When Graham was researching his
book, he found that ``everybody knew her restaurant. Everybody
watched her show.''
 &HT;    Although Smith has been saddled with the unfortunate, if
inevitable, moniker ``the black Martha Stewart, `` her own plan is
not just to capitalize on her core constituency but also to broaden
it. The model is less Martha than Oprah, the original crossover
figure, who also promises to be her biggest competition.
 &HT;    Smith's TV show, which is entering its third year in 207 markets
nationwide, has an audience that is 75 percent white and 25 percent
black. It was this statistic that helped convince Smith and Gasby
that they could find a partner for a new magazine. Convincing
others, however, hasn't been so easy.
 &HT;    ``There is the assumption,'' Gasby says, ``that because Barbara
is black, she will only appeal to blacks. People follow what she
does; she's beautiful; she's got charisma. And then you sit and
talk to executives and you get the sense they're thinking: 'But
she's black. I don't know if she's going to appeal to a wider
group.' And you say, 'She's done it in the restaurant business, on
the TV show.' You have to say the same thing 50 times differently _
this is not a black magazine.''
 &HT;    Both Smith and Gasby have said they believe that Stewart tried
to stop their show from getting into production. ``We had a deal
with Warner, and that dried up,'' Gasby says. ``Then we had a deal
with CBS, and that dried up.'' (Time Warner has a minority share in
Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, and a division of CBS syndicates
Stewart's show.) Television executives deny the charge, and Stewart
has replied by wishing Smith well.
 &HT;    ``It's like climbing Mount Everest,'' Smith says. ``You get
really tired of it and you think to yourself, So when does it stop?
But it doesn't stop.''
 &HT;    Hearst ultimately agreed to produce Smith's show, but took a
pass on backing her magazine three times on the grounds that the
timing wasn't right. Last fall, American Express finally took a
flier on Smith. Then Hearst announced in July that it would publish
Oprah's new magazine, which, like Smith's, will be about life
style.
 &HT;    But Oprah's will carry a more bankable (and proven) name on its
masthead. Smith was furious. As she puts it, ``The timing's not
right _ until we get a really rich black woman, someone with a name
and dough.''
 &HT;    Rich Fairfield, vice president for strategic planning and new
media at American Express, says that he's not worried about Oprah.
``That just shows again that this is a good idea.''
 &HT;    Still, American Express is not exactly pouring money into
Smith's venture. The magazine's editor, Julie Bain, formerly of The
Wine Enthusiast, has only two full-time staff members. The first
issue is a newsstand holiday preview. ``The earliest you'd see a
second magazine,'' Fairfield says, ``would be April.'' And then
only if the first is successful. All of which steps up the pressure
on Smith.
 &HT;    ``We see her as a mainstream force,'' says Pamela Cannon,
Smith's Random House editor, who describes Smith as ``glamorous and
approachable and _ perhaps most important _ not just Afrocentric.''
The company is promoting the book heavily on television and sending
Smith to four times the number of cities than the norm for a
lifestyle title.
 &HT;    On the cover, she's decked out in a tight floral cheongsam,
lighting candles on the beach. There are sections on Juneteenth and
Kwanzaa and also on the Chinese New Year. ``She's really
crossover,'' Cannon says.
 &HT;    Black commentators don't necessarily disagree. ``I call that
kind of black woman a super-fabulous white woman,'' says Hilton
Als, an author and a critic. ``She has no real allegiance to the
black culture.'' He says her appeal is found in the market's
assessment of her as ``safe and manageable. She's not Toukie
Smith,'' the louder, larger, more flamboyant former restaurateur.
 &HT;    Certainly, Smith does not fit into the more traditional image of
black caterers and restaurateurs like Sylvia Woods of Sylvia's, in
Harlem, or Leah Chase of Dooky Chase, in New Orleans. Those women
made national names for themselves by dishing out country and
Creole meals like fried chicken or gumbo. ``It's more like Zsa Zsa
Gabor in the kitchen,'' Als says.
 &HT;    But this is precisely why some members of the black elite see
Smith as no less than their liberator. ``She has given the black
upper classes permission to come out of the closet,'' Graham says.
``Everybody in our crowd really watches her show because we live
like this. Until now, we felt as though we had to apologize for the
fact that we had nice homes and nice things.''
 &HT;    Smith, like many middle-class professionals, straddles two
worlds: the one she came from and the one she currently inhabits.
Herein lies her real appeal. Her most powerful message is her own
story, which she tells just about wherever she goes, about the
small-town girl in western Pennsylvania whose mama was a maid and
whose daddy was a steelworker _ ``the original Martha Stewart and
Bob Vila.''
 &HT;    They grew everything themselves, had plenty of food on the table
and plenty of family around to eat it. Even then, she says, her
experience was multicultural.
 &HT;    ``The town was Greek and German and Polish and
African-American,'' she says. ``We weren't Catholic, but if it was
Friday, we had to have fish.'' On Friday nights, her father served
his homemade root beer and fresh buttered popcorn, and they'd all
sit in front of the TV to watch the fights. She learned to cook and
to clean, to grow peonies and change the slipcovers in the summer.
In the summer, she and her three brothers were packed into the
family car for trips to the only black swimming pool nearby.
 &HT;    But Smith wanted to venture farther. She persuaded her father,
who had seen a bit of the world when he was a first lieutenant in
the Army and stationed in Europe, to let her go to modeling school
in Pittsburgh, where she boarded with a caterer.
 &HT;    By the time she was 19, she was in New York leading her own
classes in modeling, pounding the pavement and, she says,
entertaining. ``Nobody turns down an invitation in New York. You
cook; you invite; they come. No matter how small the apartment.''
 &HT;    Now she is 50, with a big Manhattan apartment near her Times
Square restaurant and a house in an exclusive black section of Sag
Harbor, where she lives with Gasby and his 13-year-old daughter,
Dana. Along the way, she says, there were ``some hard knocks.''
 &HT;    Among them was a not entirely successful singing career, in
which she sang in a reggae band with Deborah Harry and hired
Freddie Jackson as a backup singer in her own short-lived nightclub
act. (``I always had a good eye for talent.'')
 &HT;    There was the painful first marriage that was annulled (``he
misrepresented himself''), and the regret of not having a child of
her own. There were also some ``difficult business relationships,''
including a partnership with Ark Restaurants.
 &HT;    By the 1980s, Smith had parlayed her interest in entertaining
into a career in the food industry, working her way up to become a
popular manager at another Ark restaurant, America. With Michael
Weinstein, the president of Ark, she opened a restaurant on Eighth
Avenue.
 &HT;    He hoped her name on the restaurant, and her presence, would
help draw crowds from the nearby theater district. ``Barbara has a
very engaging personality,'' Weinstein says. ``She is quick-witted
and certainly beautiful to look at.''
 &HT;    Enter Gasby, whom Smith first met at the restaurant in 1987 and
married almost seven years ago. He says he loves being ``Mr. B.
Smith'' and is something of a stage husband. He is the creator of
her show (when the credits roll, Smith's voice can be heard, saying
sweetly, ``Thank you, Dan'') and the driving force behind her
expansion. ``I think it's important to see that a black man should
support a black woman,'' he says. ``It's her destiny; my duty, to
fulfill it.''
 &HT;    Gasby describes Weinstein as ``the Milosevic of the restaurant
business.'' When Gasby looked at Smith's partnership, he says, ``I
saw that it wasn't in her favor.''
 &HT;    Weinstein says that the Times Square lease is too valuable for
Smith and Gasby to buy him out, but they did buy him out of the
Washington partnership and have always had full control in Sag
Harbor. Ark's use of the B. Smith name expires in December, and
Smith and Gasby are now looking for new space in Manhattan. Their
plan is then to expand to Philadelphia, Boston and Charlotte, N.C.
 &HT;    ``If I weren't married to him already,'' Smith says of Gasby,
``I'd marry him now.''
 &HT;    They are certainly cut from the same cloth. Gasby was born in
Brooklyn, in Bedford-Stuyvesant, ``about four miles too soon,'' he
says. Like Smith's, his mother was a maid; his father was a bookie.
``When I was about 7 or 8 years old, I was like, I got dropped in
the wrong place. I always wanted to be some place esthetically
beautiful, like Barbara did. I took cold baths _ so the bathroom is
very important to me.''
 &HT;    He went to Colgate, worked at a TV station in Memphis and
created and produced a ``Star Search''-style show with Natalie Cole
in Los Angeles. He met Smith, and in time their plans converged.
 &HT;    When they bought and renovated their house in Sag Harbor, he
made sure it had two 75-gallon hot-water heaters for his baths and
two kitchens for the set of the TV show they did not yet have.
``People thought we were crazy,'' Gasby says, ``But you can't bet
against B., and you better not bet against me.''
 &HT;    And so while Smith may have grown up eating collard greens from
her own backyard, she now sautes them in olive oil and puts them in
Italian frittatas. There's a picture of one in her latest book _
photographed in her new backyard, the one overlooking a private
beach.
 &HT;    Smith is peddling style as an aspirational tool. ``I am more of
a conduit,'' she says. ``I bring in experts, and the audience and I
are in it together.'' This is what attracted Leslie McNeil, the
former executive producer of Martha Stewart's Emmy-winning TV show,
who has just signed on as executive producer of ``B. Smith, With
Style.''
 &HT;    ``Martha is an event unto herself, and you see the world through
her eyes,'' McNeil says. ``B. has a very powerful vision too, but
it has to do with encouraging people to develop their own
imprint.''
 &HT;    In the overcrowded lifestyle market, Cannon says, personality
has become everything, and so ``the key to B. is meeting her,
seeing her. That's why we're putting so much behind her.''

   The 1960s were as tumultuous at the table as they were on
college campuses and on the streets.
</P>
<P>
   The decade started graciously enough. The prosperous but stodgy
1950s seemed officially over when Ike and Mamie left the White
House to Jack and Jackie. Gone were the golf holidays and Ike
puttering over a hot plate in the private quarters. In were
glamour, youth and the first French chef in the country's first
mansion.

   Those of us who wanted to try some of those Kennedy-esque dishes
at home had Julia Child as our first guide. Child was well into
middle age when she first appeared on Boston public television, but
she clearly sparked the country's nascent interest in French food.
A California native who had traveled the world with her diplomat
husband, Child brought just the right amount of humor to haute
cuisine to make it palatable to the American cook.

   As we sent our first man into space, many of us also experienced
our first trip abroad. Europe was in _ thanks to the Beatles, the
Volkswagen and affordable air travel.
</P>
<P>
   But the '60s weren't all about ``pot au feu'' and champagne.
They were also about Pringles and cold duck. We may love the cachet
of the Continent, but convenience will always be king. The '60s
gave us Maxim freeze-dried coffee, Awake synthetic orange juice and
Kaboom breakfast food (43.8 percent sugar).

<P>
   By 1960, 30.5 percent of married women were working outside of
the home, and by 1965, 35 percent of the entire work force was
female. Along with Twiggy and ``That Girl,'' being single was sexy.
Playboy and Cosmopolitan's Helen Gurley Brown published cookbooks
to help this emerging market.
</P>
<P>
   The 1960s also gave us the health-food movement sparked by
Rachel Carson's examination of environmental pollution and the
hippie lifestyle of communal, back-to-nature living. And you could
get everything you wanted at ``Alice's Restaurant,'' exceptin'
Alice.
</P>
<P>
   The hungry and the disenfranchised made their plights public
with lunch-counter sit-ins and the Poor People's March on
Washington. Cultural pride appeared with soul-food restaurants and
contests such as the Washington Natural Gas Co.'s first Soul Food
Recipe Contest in 1969.

   Food, again, was about our future and our past.

 By BLAINE HARDEN  
 FROM: The New York Times Magazine  
 &HT;    Welcome to Belgrade, the capital of Serbia.
 &HT;    Here bureaucrats with bodyguards and blood on their hands have
become private-club dandies; middle-class professionals have been
forced to choose between poverty or criminality; and feigned lunacy
is a sane way to stay safe.
 &HT;    Four lost wars, international isolation and gangster economics
have combined to make Belgrade especially cruel to the young people
who have come of age during the 12-year reign of Slobodan
Milosevic.
 &HT;    The city has descended into its own sad, slacker category among
major European capitals. It's a metropolis where hard work,
professional excellence and saving for the future are wastes of
time.
 &HT;    This is home for the Milosevic generation. Unemployed or stuck
in jobs that usually pay less than $100 a month, young Serbs
between the ages of 18 and 30 typically live with their parents,
spend nearly all their money on night life, postpone marriage,
avoid parenthood and put off plans for the future _ except to get
out of the country.
 &HT;    Estimates of the number of university-trained young people who
have fled the city since 1990 range from 100,000 to 300,000. That's
a catastrophic drain of talent and skills from a nation where in
1991 just 622,000 people in a population of 10 million had more
than a high-school education.
 &HT;    But the option of running away has run out. The war in Kosovo
forced most Western countries to close their embassies in Belgrade,
making obtaining visas far more difficult.
 &HT;    ``Delayed gratification is what the whole civilized world is
based on, but in Belgrade, it makes no sense,'' says Svetlana
Logar-Djuric, a prominent psychologist at the University of
Belgrade and the mother of an 18-year-old son. She has spent
several years researching, among other things, the lives of
Belgrade's smart set _ those whose professional parents had, as
late at the mid-1980s, constituted the only well-paid, widely
traveled middle class in the Communist bloc.
 &HT;    ``For young people here, it makes sense to be depressed,'' she
says. ``Many go to bed at 4 o'clock in the morning and sleep all
day. They don't see a point in growing up to become responsible
adults. The city teaches them to be helpless.''
 &HT;    Her own son, Jovan, scolds her for having wasted her time
working long hours to earn a Ph.D. He has a point. Her university
job pays approximately $100 a month, and the money always arrives
several months late.
 &HT;    ``If you are a criminal, you are, like, cool,'' Jovan said one
afternoon as we sat with his mother and four of his high-school
friends in their Belgrade apartment so choked with cigarette smoke
that it was difficult to see across the cramped living room. (Jovan
and his friends were all chain-smokers.) ``You can't blame anyone
for being a criminal. I have respect for those who have the will to
do what they want. Life in the fast lane _ how can that not be
attractive?''
 &HT;    His friends' heads bobbed in agreement. Burglary, for instance,
is one of the few promising career paths for savvy young Serbs.
 &HT;    Home is where the money is _ about $2.5 billion, according to
the Yugoslav Association of Banks. In the Milosevic era, it's much
less risky to hide money in a mattress than to deposit it in a
bank. The regime has seized the hard-currency savings accounts of
most private depositors _ about $4.1 billion in the last decade.
 &HT;    The regime also tacitly encourages the young to consider careers
in car theft. The streets of Belgrade are filled with gleaming
late-model cars that have no license plates. They are driven by
mean-looking young men and are often ignored by the police.
 &HT;    For the past two years, the government has offered a monthlong
amnesty to car thieves, allowing them to register any car, even one
that is obviously hot, in order to raise money from licensing fees.
Many of the vehicles have been swiped by gangsters and paramilitary
thugs from other republics in the former Yugoslavia, as well as
from Western Europe.
 &HT;    And yet, as much as Jovan and his friends were mesmerized by
life in Belgrade's fast lane, they saw dark motives behind the
West's bombing of their city. They say the reasons for the war
were: American fear of a united Europe, the desire of the
military-industrial complex to use up its old bombs and
multinational corporate hunger for Serbia's mineral wealth.
 &HT;    As for war crimes, Jovan and his friends say, get real. ``It was
war,'' Jovan said. ``As much as Serbs did something bad, so did the
Albanians.''
 &HT;    Even when about 35,000 NATO troops had occupied Kosovo and when
Kosovar Albanians, bent on revenge, were harassing, ripping off and
murdering Kosovar Serbs, Belgrade was drowning in denial. Some of
it was merely the posturing of a defeated demagogue, as
state-controlled television in late June insisted that Serbia had
won the war.
 &HT;    Still more fundamental and more pernicious was the denial that
bubbled up in conversation this summer with well-educated young
people in Belgrade. Almost without exception, they could not bring
themselves to admit that atrocities had been committed in their
name.
 &HT;    War-crimes investigators were digging up mass graves in Kosovo,
but they refused to concede what was obvious to the rest of the
world: Serb forces had committed crimes against humanity on a scale
and with an organized savagery that was grossly disproportionate to
the threat posed by ethnic Albanians.
 &HT;    The people of Belgrade, about a fifth of Serbia's 10 million
people and 40 percent of its college-educated population, were far
less upset at the bestial way in which the war was fought than by
the fact that Milosevic had compounded their poverty and isolation
by losing it.
 &HT;    I first started coming to Belgrade as a reporter in 1990, as
Yugoslavia was beginning to come apart. It never occurred to me
early in the decade that the Serbs of Belgrade would be
collectively responsible for the horrors perpetrated by the
Milosevic regime. Far from it, Belgrade was for me an intellectual
and cultural oasis in the ruins of Yugoslavia.
 &HT;    Thanks to Tito's brand of communism, Belgrade's middle class had
become far more affluent and Westernized _ from foreign travel and
foreign investment, from a hybrid economy that mixed socialism with
private enterprise, from a flood of foreign movies, books and music
_ than residents of any other capital in Eastern Europe.
 &HT;    Until the war in Bosnia began in 1992, Belgrade had been the
destination city in the East bloc for young Poles, Czechs and
Hungarians seeking to be cool. It teemed with outspoken
politicians, well-informed journalists and insightful academics _
not to mention beautiful women, smart nightclubs and excellent
restaurants.
 &HT;    Atrocities in Kosovo this year have blackened the name of Serbia
as never before. Outside the country, the very word ``Serb'' took
on the sinister resonance of ``Nazi.'' Even if they were not the
ones doing the fighting, an argument grew that Serbian civilians
should be held morally responsible for crimes committed in their
name.
 &HT;    In Belgrade this summer, though, people didn't feel responsible.
Nor did they tolerate politicians who suggested that they were.
 &HT;    At a huge opposition rally in mid-August in Belgrade, as during
earlier rallies outside the capital this summer, speakers who said
that Serbia had been ``shamed'' in the eyes of the world were
careful to blame Milosevic and a few maniacs in his regime _ and to
distance the people of Serbia from any accountability for the
conduct of the war.
 &HT;    I had asked Helena Zdravkovic, who is 21 and speaks perfect
American-accented English, to take me around Belgrade. Her father
owns the Tennis Club Max and plays doubles regularly with Radovan
(Rade) Markovic, the head of state security, who commands state
paramilitary forces that helped lead the campaign of murder, theft
and house-burning in Kosovo, which war crimes investigators say
killed at least 11,000 Kosovar Albanians.
 &HT;    American officials say Markovic is likely to be indicted by the
War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague, but he has not allowed this
unpleasantness to rattle his tennis game. Throughout the
three-month Kosovo war and on into this summer, he played at Tennis
Club Max as much as weather permitted.
 &HT;    The police seem to know whom Helena's father plays tennis with _
Belgrade is that kind of town. They let her get away with driving a
Mercury Capri convertible with expired Florida plates. She was
familiar with the lifestyles of the rich and criminal, having spent
her teen-age years hanging out at Tennis Club Max. Both a player in
the city's social scene and a skeptic, she had studied journalism
for the past two academic years at Florida International
University, in Miami, and the American University in Paris. She
plans to attend Emerson College, in Boston, next year. Helena also
happened to be blond, attractive and fitted out in fetching summer
dresses, which does not hurt in Belgrade.
 &HT;    Her father, Dejan Zdravkovic, opened the club nine years ago
after retiring at the age of 40. He had made what he told me was a
substantial amount of money in Italy selling machine tools to
governments around the world. Most of the equipment was for making
cannons and artillery pieces.
 &HT;    He came home to Belgrade and opened the club in the exclusive
residential diplomats' neighborhood of Dedinje. Now the club has
just 35 members, many of them businessmen who have grown rich under
the U.N. sanctions imposed this decade on the Milosevic regime.
 &HT;    ``Sanctions are paradise,'' Dejan said as we sat beneath ``Just
Do It!'' sun umbrellas in the cafe of his club. ``Normally, you
import and you pay duties and then taxes. But under sanctions, if
you know the right people, you pay no duties and no taxes, and you
have the excuse of charging more. Sanctions are what cemented
Milosevic's power.''
 &HT;    Although Dejan and his wife, Ivana, play tennis, do business and
socialize with well-connected people in the regime, they are
nervous about the future. They are sending their children to
college in the United States.
 &HT;    On a hot July morning, Helena treated me to a comfortable
accoutrement of her upper-middle-class life _ an
apartment-turned-boutique in central Belgrade that admits only
customers known to the owner. The shop, which has no name, sells
designer clothing and fashion accessories shoplifted from Italy and
smuggled into Serbia.
 &HT;    The owner, a Montenegrin with a shaved head, gold chains and
leather vest, kissed Helena (and glared at me) before we climbed
the stairs to his third-floor boutique. He is a regular at Tennis
Club Max, where he comes with the latest issues of Vogue and Marie
Claire to sit with well-heeled women. They point to clothes that
tickle their fancy. His men in Italy then try to steal them.
 &HT;    During the owner's brief conversation with Helena, he told her
that one of his men in Italy had ``fallen,'' meaning that he was
arrested trying to break into a warehouse full of merchandise.
 &HT;    There were video cameras on the stairs leading up to the shop
and a monitor inside that gave clerks a chance to scrutinize
visitors before letting them enter. Helena, of course, was more
than welcome.
 &HT;    The place was piled high with panties and sunglasses, handbags
and evening gowns. I saw pink-and-gray stiletto-heeled Versace
shoes in the living room, Fendi white leather skirts in one bedroom
and a handsome charcoal-gray Kenzo business suit in the second
bedroom. Most of the clothes bore stickers from the stores where
they had been stolen. The prices were about one-third retail.
Helena was not impressed.
 &HT;    ``It is nothing like it was last year,'' she said. ``I mean I
could find really nice clothes for myself and I am really picky.''
 &HT;    The shopkeeper explained to Helena that the springtime war in
Kosovo had constricted his supply line for summer fashion. But with
the war over, he was expecting new shipments.
 &HT;    Then we were off in Helena's convertible, her 6-month-old,
purebred English bulldog, Boobi, drooling in the back seat, for a
look at what American cruise missiles have done to Belgrade.
 &HT;    In the heart of the city, at each corner of the intersection,
but only at each corner, there were ruins. The Serbian government
center, the foreign ministry and two defense ministry buildings had
been reduced to rubble or were fire-gutted shells. The precision of
the destruction suggested a war with an invisible, all-seeing enemy
and of a city helpless to protect itself.
 &HT;    Traffic flowed, shops were open and apartments were being lived
in. Except for long lines for rationed gasoline, the surface of
everyday life in Belgrade seemed remarkably placid. But the surface
was deceptive. The war in Kosovo had plunged the Serbian economy
into free fall, incomes were collapsing and the U.N. World Food
Program was warning of massive wintertime shortages of food,
electricity and fuel.
 &HT;    In Belgrade, the downwardly mobile do not mind being quoted by
name. Helena took me one evening to meet her friend Darko Susnjar,
who grew up in Belgrade's upper middle class, but who has since
been skidding into the ranks of the working poor. He worked this
summer as a ticket taker on a private bus, making about $5.50 for a
12-hour day.
 &HT;    With a ring in his left ear, day-old stubble and long brown hair
tied in a ponytail, Susnjar, 26, bears a passing resemblance to a
young version of the comedian George Carlin. An only child, he
lives with his parents and admits to being a desultory student at
the University of Belgrade. Like many students there, he sees no
point in graduating. He studies ethnology, a field that he
acknowledges is a waste of time, given the circumstances in Serbia.
 &HT;    His father worked at the Hotel Yugoslavia, which on May 7 was
hit by three American cruise missiles. The Americans were
apparently trying to take out the hotel's casino, which was partly
owned by Arkan, but missed by a few feet and gutted a wing of rooms
in the hotel.
 &HT;    Darko and his family live near that hotel, and he happened to be
out that Friday night in May getting a hamburger at a fast-food
kiosk. He paid for his burger a few minutes before midnight, just
as the missiles ruined his father's livelihood.
 &HT;    ``I stood there for a minute and watched the hotel burn,'' Darko
said. ``What to do? I walked home and ate my hamburger. Now, from
day to day, we sink lower. You ask yourself, How much more?''
 &HT;    Darko, who listened to Radio Free Europe throughout the war, had
also heard about atrocities. He did not argue that they were
justified by Albanian treachery. He simply did not care to talk
about the subject. To avoid thinking about war and to salve
depression brought on by the summer of endless rain, Darko said he
was reading 19th-century novels and listening to sunny Cuban music.
 &HT;    ``Politics here is a kind of sickness, and I'm not interested,''
he said. ``Democratic change will take many years. In the meantime,
the Serbs will hibernate, like bears. At this time, Thanatos is
much stronger than Eros. It is dark here now. That is our
reality.''
 &HT;    I also learned that for young women in Belgrade, on the other
hand, career choices tend to lie somewhere on a continuum between
honest-impoverishing and criminal-lucrative. In the dispiriting
middle lies the temp work done by ``sponsor girls'' _ middle-class
high-school girls who tart themselves up and trade their bodies to
gangsters in return for designer clothes, cell phones and fancy
dinners.
 &HT;    I had dinner with two buxom, bejeweled and elaborately made-up
young women, age 18 and 19, one of whom used to date Helena's
brother. We met around midnight in the Fortress, an elegant new
outdoor restaurant built amid Roman and medieval ruins on a hilltop
at the confluence of the Danube and Sava Rivers.
 &HT;    It's an expensive place where gangsters gather late at night to
show off new cars, gold chains and teen-age babes in designer duds.
Without a gangster friend, the girls told me, you can't really
enjoy Belgrade; young women have no possibility of doing what they
want with their lives unless they are from rich families.
 &HT;    Both the girls had graduated from high school and said they were
planning on enrolling this fall in the law faculty at the
University of Belgrade. It didn't make sense to become a lawyer in
a country without laws, they said, but they didn't know what else
to do.
 &HT;    I asked them about Kosovo, about the bodies of Albanians that
were being dug up there from mass graves and if they were aware
that outside Serbia, many people had the impression that Serbian
forces had committed genocide. It was as if I had belched or
insulted their makeup. The conversation paused awkwardly. Both
girls seemed offended.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what happened in Kosovo,'' Olja said,
dismissively. ``I didn't hear that we did any more atrocities than
what the Albanians did to us.''
 &HT;    They wanted to talk about the weather. Both said the summer's
thunderstorms reminded them of the spring months when Americans
bombed Belgrade. They said they'd been having trouble sleeping and
that they'd heard the Americans were causing the rainstorms. I said
I did not think that was very likely. They left for another
nightclub.
 &HT;    The night before coming into Belgrade, I had dinner with Milka
Tadic, a prominent Yugoslav journalist. During an evening in which
she grew increasingly combative and angry, she warned me not to be
taken in by Serbs who claim that they do not know about the
atrocities committed in their name in Kosovo.
 &HT;    ``The silence in Belgrade about what went on makes me really
sick,'' she said. Tadic is the managing editor of Monitor, a weekly
political magazine published in Montenegro.
 &HT;    ``Serbs don't want to know, but most of them know,'' she went
on. ``They have satellite dishes and short-wave radios. They know,
but they don't care. All they care about is themselves. For them,
Albanians are not really human beings. The Serbs believe they are
the chosen people. It is racism. I hate to say it, but it is like
what the Germans did.''
 &HT;    I argued with Milka that night. I said it was unfair to tar an
entire people for the depravity of their leaders. But after a month
in Belgrade, after listening to intelligent and cultured people
dismiss the savagery in Kosovo as ``no worse than what they did to
us,'' I came to share Milka's rage.

have fled the city since 1990 range from 100,000 to 300,000. That's
a catastrophic drain of talent and skills from a nation where in
1991 just 622,000 people in a population of 10 million had more
than a high-school education.
 &HT;    But the option of running away has run out. The war in Kosovo
forced most Western countries to close their embassies in Belgrade,
making obtaining visas far more difficult.
 &HT;    ``Delayed gratification is what the whole civilized world is
based on, but in Belgrade, it makes no sense,'' says Svetlana
Logar-Djuric, a prominent psychologist at the University of
Belgrade and the mother of an 18-year-old son. She has spent
several years researching, among other things, the lives of
Belgrade's smart set _ those whose professional parents had, as
late at the mid-1980s, constituted the only well-paid, widely
traveled middle class in the Communist bloc.
 &HT;    ``For young people here, it makes sense to be depressed,'' she
says. ``Many go to bed at 4 o'clock in the morning and sleep all
day. They don't see a point in growing up to become responsible
adults. The city teaches them to be helpless.''
 &HT;    Her own son, Jovan, scolds her for having wasted her time
working long hours to earn a Ph.D. He has a point. Her university
job pays approximately $100 a month, and the money always arrives
several months late.
 &HT;    ``If you are a criminal, you are, like, cool,'' Jovan said one
afternoon as we sat with his mother and four of his high-school
friends in their Belgrade apartment so choked with cigarette smoke
that it was difficult to see across the cramped living room. (Jovan
and his friends were all chain-smokers.) ``You can't blame anyone
for being a criminal. I have respect for those who have the will to
do what they want. Life in the fast lane _ how can that not be
attractive?''
 &HT;    His friends' heads bobbed in agreement. Burglary, for instance,
is one of the few promising career paths for savvy young Serbs.
 &HT;    Home is where the money is _ about $2.5 billion, according to
the Yugoslav Association of Banks. In the Milosevic era, it's much
less risky to hide money in a mattress than to deposit it in a
bank. The regime has seized the hard-currency savings accounts of
most private depositors _ about $4.1 billion in the last decade.
 &HT;    The regime also tacitly encourages the young to consider careers
in car theft. The streets of Belgrade are filled with gleaming
late-model cars that have no license plates. They are driven by
mean-looking young men and are often ignored by the police.
 &HT;    For the past two years, the government has offered a monthlong
amnesty to car thieves, allowing them to register any car, even one
that is obviously hot, in order to raise money from licensing fees.
Many of the vehicles have been swiped by gangsters and paramilitary
thugs from other republics in the former Yugoslavia, as well as
from Western Europe.
 &HT;    And yet, as much as Jovan and his friends were mesmerized by
life in Belgrade's fast lane, they saw dark motives behind the
West's bombing of their city. They say the reasons for the war
were: American fear of a united Europe, the desire of the
military-industrial complex to use up its old bombs and
multinational corporate hunger for Serbia's mineral wealth.
 &HT;    As for war crimes, Jovan and his friends say, get real. ``It was
war,'' Jovan said. ``As much as Serbs did something bad, so did the
Albanians.''
 &HT;    Even when about 35,000 NATO troops had occupied Kosovo and when
Kosovar Albanians, bent on revenge, were harassing, ripping off and
murdering Kosovar Serbs, Belgrade was drowning in denial. Some of
it was merely the posturing of a defeated demagogue, as
state-controlled television in late June insisted that Serbia had
won the war.
 &HT;    Still more fundamental and more pernicious was the denial that
bubbled up in conversation this summer with well-educated young
people in Belgrade. Almost without exception, they could not bring
themselves to admit that atrocities had been committed in their
name.
 &HT;    War-crimes investigators were digging up mass graves in Kosovo,
but they refused to concede what was obvious to the rest of the
world: Serb forces had committed crimes against humanity on a scale
and with an organized savagery that was grossly disproportionate to
the threat posed by ethnic Albanians.
 &HT;    The people of Belgrade, about a fifth of Serbia's 10 million
people and 40 percent of its college-educated population, were far
less upset at the bestial way in which the war was fought than by
the fact that Milosevic had compounded their poverty and isolation
by losing it.
 &HT;    I first started coming to Belgrade as a reporter in 1990, as
Yugoslavia was beginning to come apart. It never occurred to me
early in the decade that the Serbs of Belgrade would be
collectively responsible for the horrors perpetrated by the
Milosevic regime. Far from it, Belgrade was for me an intellectual
and cultural oasis in the ruins of Yugoslavia.
 &HT;    Thanks to Tito's brand of communism, Belgrade's middle class had
become far more affluent and Westernized _ from foreign travel and
foreign investment, from a hybrid economy that mixed socialism with
private enterprise, from a flood of foreign movies, books and music
_ than residents of any other capital in Eastern Europe.
 &HT;    Until the war in Bosnia began in 1992, Belgrade had been the
destination city in the East bloc for young Poles, Czechs and
Hungarians seeking to be cool. It teemed with outspoken
politicians, well-informed journalists and insightful academics _
not to mention beautiful women, smart nightclubs and excellent
restaurants.
 &HT;    Atrocities in Kosovo this year have blackened the name of Serbia
as never before. Outside the country, the very word ``Serb'' took
on the sinister resonance of ``Nazi.'' Even if they were not the
ones doing the fighting, an argument grew that Serbian civilians
should be held morally responsible for crimes committed in their
name.
 &HT;    In Belgrade this summer, though, people didn't feel responsible.
Nor did they tolerate politicians who suggested that they were.
 &HT;    At a huge opposition rally in mid-August in Belgrade, as during
earlier rallies outside the capital this summer, speakers who said
that Serbia had been ``shamed'' in the eyes of the world were
careful to blame Milosevic and a few maniacs in his regime _ and to
distance the people of Serbia from any accountability for the
conduct of the war.
 &HT;    I had asked Helena Zdravkovic, who is 21 and speaks perfect
American-accented English, to take me around Belgrade. Her father
owns the Tennis Club Max and plays doubles regularly with Radovan
(Rade) Markovic, the head of state security, who commands state
paramilitary forces that helped lead the campaign of murder, theft
and house-burning in Kosovo, which war crimes investigators say
killed at least 11,000 Kosovar Albanians.
 &HT;    American officials say Markovic is likely to be indicted by the
War Crimes Tribunal in the Hague, but he has not allowed this
unpleasantness to rattle his tennis game. Throughout the
three-month Kosovo war and on into this summer, he played at Tennis
Club Max as much as weather permitted.
 &HT;    The police seem to know whom Helena's father plays tennis with _
Belgrade is that kind of town. They let her get away with driving a
Mercury Capri convertible with expired Florida plates. She was
familiar with the lifestyles of the rich and criminal, having spent
her teen-age years hanging out at Tennis Club Max. Both a player in
the city's social scene and a skeptic, she had studied journalism
for the past two academic years at Florida International
University, in Miami, and the American University in Paris. She
plans to attend Emerson College, in Boston, next year. Helena also
happened to be blond, attractive and fitted out in fetching summer
dresses, which does not hurt in Belgrade.
 &HT;    Her father, Dejan Zdravkovic, opened the club nine years ago
after retiring at the age of 40. He had made what he told me was a
substantial amount of money in Italy selling machine tools to
governments around the world. Most of the equipment was for making
cannons and artillery pieces.
 &HT;    He came home to Belgrade and opened the club in the exclusive
residential diplomats' neighborhood of Dedinje. Now the club has
just 35 members, many of them businessmen who have grown rich under
the U.N. sanctions imposed this decade on the Milosevic regime.
 &HT;    ``Sanctions are paradise,'' Dejan said as we sat beneath ``Just
Do It!'' sun umbrellas in the cafe of his club. ``Normally, you
import and you pay duties and then taxes. But under sanctions, if
you know the right people, you pay no duties and no taxes, and you
have the excuse of charging more. Sanctions are what cemented
Milosevic's power.''
 &HT;    Although Dejan and his wife, Ivana, play tennis, do business and
socialize with well-connected people in the regime, they are
nervous about the future. They are sending their children to
college in the United States.
 &HT;    On a hot July morning, Helena treated me to a comfortable
accoutrement of her upper-middle-class life _ an
apartment-turned-boutique in central Belgrade that admits only
customers known to the owner. The shop, which has no name, sells
designer clothing and fashion accessories shoplifted from Italy and
smuggled into Serbia.
 &HT;    The owner, a Montenegrin with a shaved head, gold chains and
leather vest, kissed Helena (and glared at me) before we climbed
the stairs to his third-floor boutique. He is a regular at Tennis
Club Max, where he comes with the latest issues of Vogue and Marie
Claire to sit with well-heeled women. They point to clothes that
tickle their fancy. His men in Italy then try to steal them.
 &HT;    During the owner's brief conversation with Helena, he told her
that one of his men in Italy had ``fallen,'' meaning that he was
arrested trying to break into a warehouse full of merchandise.
 &HT;    There were video cameras on the stairs leading up to the shop
and a monitor inside that gave clerks a chance to scrutinize
visitors before letting them enter. Helena, of course, was more
than welcome.
 &HT;    The place was piled high with panties and sunglasses, handbags
and evening gowns. I saw pink-and-gray stiletto-heeled Versace
shoes in the living room, Fendi white leather skirts in one bedroom
and a handsome charcoal-gray Kenzo business suit in the second
bedroom. Most of the clothes bore stickers from the stores where
they had been stolen. The prices were about one-third retail.
Helena was not impressed.
 &HT;    ``It is nothing like it was last year,'' she said. ``I mean I
could find really nice clothes for myself and I am really picky.''
 &HT;    The shopkeeper explained to Helena that the springtime war in
Kosovo had constricted his supply line for summer fashion. But with
the war over, he was expecting new shipments.
 &HT;    Then we were off in Helena's convertible, her 6-month-old,
purebred English bulldog, Boobi, drooling in the back seat, for a
look at what American cruise missiles have done to Belgrade.
 &HT;    In the heart of the city, at each corner of the intersection,
but only at each corner, there were ruins. The Serbian government
center, the foreign ministry and two defense ministry buildings had
been reduced to rubble or were fire-gutted shells. The precision of
the destruction suggested a war with an invisible, all-seeing enemy
and of a city helpless to protect itself.
 &HT;    Traffic flowed, shops were open and apartments were being lived
in. Except for long lines for rationed gasoline, the surface of
everyday life in Belgrade seemed remarkably placid. But the surface
was deceptive. The war in Kosovo had plunged the Serbian economy
into free fall, incomes were collapsing and the U.N. World Food
Program was warning of massive wintertime shortages of food,
electricity and fuel.
 &HT;    In Belgrade, the downwardly mobile do not mind being quoted by
name. Helena took me one evening to meet her friend Darko Susnjar,
who grew up in Belgrade's upper middle class, but who has since
been skidding into the ranks of the working poor. He worked this
summer as a ticket taker on a private bus, making about $5.50 for a
12-hour day.
 &HT;    With a ring in his left ear, day-old stubble and long brown hair
tied in a ponytail, Susnjar, 26, bears a passing resemblance to a
young version of the comedian George Carlin. An only child, he
lives with his parents and admits to being a desultory student at
the University of Belgrade. Like many students there, he sees no
point in graduating. He studies ethnology, a field that he
acknowledges is a waste of time, given the circumstances in Serbia.
 &HT;    His father worked at the Hotel Yugoslavia, which on May 7 was
hit by three American cruise missiles. The Americans were
apparently trying to take out the hotel's casino, which was partly
owned by Arkan, but missed by a few feet and gutted a wing of rooms
in the hotel.
 &HT;    Darko and his family live near that hotel, and he happened to be
out that Friday night in May getting a hamburger at a fast-food
kiosk. He paid for his burger a few minutes before midnight, just
as the missiles ruined his father's livelihood.
 &HT;    ``I stood there for a minute and watched the hotel burn,'' Darko
said. ``What to do? I walked home and ate my hamburger. Now, from
day to day, we sink lower. You ask yourself, How much more?''
 &HT;    Darko, who listened to Radio Free Europe throughout the war, had
also heard about atrocities. He did not argue that they were
justified by Albanian treachery. He simply did not care to talk
about the subject. To avoid thinking about war and to salve
depression brought on by the summer of endless rain, Darko said he
was reading 19th-century novels and listening to sunny Cuban music.
 &HT;    ``Politics here is a kind of sickness, and I'm not interested,''
he said. ``Democratic change will take many years. In the meantime,
the Serbs will hibernate, like bears. At this time, Thanatos is
much stronger than Eros. It is dark here now. That is our
reality.''
 &HT;    I also learned that for young women in Belgrade, on the other
hand, career choices tend to lie somewhere on a continuum between
honest-impoverishing and criminal-lucrative. In the dispiriting
middle lies the temp work done by ``sponsor girls'' _ middle-class
high-school girls who tart themselves up and trade their bodies to
gangsters in return for designer clothes, cell phones and fancy
dinners.
 &HT;    I had dinner with two buxom, bejeweled and elaborately made-up
young women, age 18 and 19, one of whom used to date Helena's
brother. We met around midnight in the Fortress, an elegant new
outdoor restaurant built amid Roman and medieval ruins on a hilltop
at the confluence of the Danube and Sava Rivers.
 &HT;    It's an expensive place where gangsters gather late at night to
show off new cars, gold chains and teen-age babes in designer duds.
Without a gangster friend, the girls told me, you can't really
enjoy Belgrade; young women have no possibility of doing what they
want with their lives unless they are from rich families.
 &HT;    Both the girls had graduated from high school and said they were
planning on enrolling this fall in the law faculty at the
University of Belgrade. It didn't make sense to become a lawyer in
a country without laws, they said, but they didn't know what else
to do.
 &HT;    I asked them about Kosovo, about the bodies of Albanians that
were being dug up there from mass graves and if they were aware
that outside Serbia, many people had the impression that Serbian
forces had committed genocide. It was as if I had belched or
insulted their makeup. The conversation paused awkwardly. Both
girls seemed offended.
 &HT;    ``I don't know what happened in Kosovo,'' Olja said,
dismissively. ``I didn't hear that we did any more atrocities than
what the Albanians did to us.''
 &HT;    They wanted to talk about the weather. Both said the summer's
thunderstorms reminded them of the spring months when Americans
bombed Belgrade. They said they'd been having trouble sleeping and
that they'd heard the Americans were causing the rainstorms. I said
I did not think that was very likely. They left for another
nightclub.
 &HT;    The night before coming into Belgrade, I had dinner with Milka
Tadic, a prominent Yugoslav journalist. During an evening in which
she grew increasingly combative and angry, she warned me not to be
taken in by Serbs who claim that they do not know about the
atrocities committed in their name in Kosovo.
 &HT;    ``The silence in Belgrade about what went on makes me really
sick,'' she said. Tadic is the managing editor of Monitor, a weekly
political magazine published in Montenegro.
 &HT;    ``Serbs don't want to know, but most of them know,'' she went
on. ``They have satellite dishes and short-wave radios. They know,
but they don't care. All they care about is themselves. For them,
Albanians are not really human beings. The Serbs believe they are
the chosen people. It is racism. I hate to say it, but it is like
what the Germans did.''
 &HT;    I argued with Milka that night. I said it was unfair to tar an
entire people for the depravity of their leaders. But after a month
in Belgrade, after listening to intelligent and cultured people
dismiss the savagery in Kosovo as ``no worse than what they did to
us,'' I came to share Milka's rage.

ANOTHER KORESH PROBE UNNECESSARY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL THOMPSON 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Not again. Not another investigation of the Branch Davidian
fiasco.
</P>
<P>
   Everybody knows what happened, or ought to: A homicidal/suicidal
nut case named David Koresh set himself and his goofball cult on
fire, and most of them burned to death.
</P>
<P>
   Case closed.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI did not start the fire that consumed Koresh, his idiot
followers and their unfortunate children. If federal law
enforcement officials lied about using pyrotechnic tear-gas
grenades hours before the fire broke out, well, shame on them.
</P>
<P>
   If the attorney general and Congress want to find out who lied
and why, let them conduct a brief, limited investigation that
focuses on the whys and wherefores of the lying. We do not need
another in-depth rehash of the entire, ill-fated showdown between
Koresh and the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   For those who have happily forgotten this pitiful 51-day chapter
in American history, here's a quick refresher course: On Feb. 28,
1993, the federal Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms conducted
a raid on the Branch Davidians' headquarters near Waco after a
lengthy investigation turned up evidence that Koresh and his
bizarre band of misfits were illegally stockpiling weapons and
explosives for the purpose of waging violence against the outside
world.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody apparently tipped off the Koreshians about the raid,
and so they had their considerable arsenal at the ready when ATF
agents approached the so-called compound in which Koresh and the
others resided in the finest tradition of cultification. The
shootout left four agents and at least two Davidians dead. Sixteen
agents were wounded.
</P>
<P>
   After the ATF retrieved its dead and wounded, the FBI assumed
command of the scene and settled in for a 51-day standoff that
ended with the lethal conflagration on April 19.
</P>
<P>
   Arson investigators concluded that the fire was set by the
people inside the building, which came as no surprise to anyone who
had paid attention to the Koreshian rantings that emanated from the
place throughout the siege. It couldn't have been more obvious that
Koresh meant to end his life in what he considered a blaze of glory
_ and to take the others with him.
</P>
<P>
   Attorney General Janet Reno OK'd the tank-and-tear-gas assault
on the Davidian compound that evidently provided the excuse that
Koresh was looking for to ``light it up.'' The critics say that the
government shouldn't have forced the issue after a mere 51 days,
that the FBI should have continued to negotiate with Koresh until a
peaceful resolution was achieved.
</P>
<P>
   Ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Koresh had no intention of permitting a peaceful resolution. He
had promised his followers a fiery apocalypse, and he was hell-bent
on keeping his word.
</P>
<P>
   No, the FBI did not move too soon when it began poking holes in
the Davidians' happy little home and injecting tear gas. It acted
approximately 50 days too late.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as the initial ATF raid was repelled by the combative
Davidians, the government should have regrouped and mounted a
second assault _ a serious assault, the kind of assault that would
have overwhelmed the cultists and forced their surrender.
</P>
<P>
   The mistake the government made was sitting there all those days
and weeks, giving Koresh an opportunity to promulgate his
preposterous preachings and prepare his followers for the
diabolical climax he was plotting.
</P>
<P>
   What about the children? Wasn't the government responsible for
the safety of young children inside the Davidian compound?
</P>
<P>
   Nope. Koresh and the Davidian adults were responsible for the
safety of the children. The adults inside placed the children in
jeopardy. Koresh and whoever else set the fire murdered the
children. Blaming the government for any deaths that occurred
inside that building is an outrageous misallocation of
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI's newly revealed failure to be entirely forthcoming
about irrelevant details does not change the fundamental facts of
what happened that day: David Koresh perpetrated mass murder and
suicide.
</P>
<P>
   No further investigation is required.

BELLS, GIFT OF RUSSIAN CZAR, REMOVED FROM CHURCH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SARAH YANG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ For a century, the bells a Russian czar gave to
the Orthodox Holy Trinity Cathedral have survived earthquakes and
fires, but last weekend thieves got three of the bells.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the San Francisco church considered the missing bells
priceless. They were the smallest of five bells given to the
church, the oldest Eastern Orthodox parish in the continental
United States, in 1888 by Czar Alexander III.
</P>
<P>
   Cast in Moscow, the heavy bells adorned with decorative
scrollwork are believed to be unique in the United States and rare
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never imagined somebody actually stealing them,'' said
Robert A. Parent, the choir director of the church. ``Why would
anybody want to? I cannot imagine what kind of value they would
have to people other than to the church itself and to San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   A silver alloy was used to cast them, providing an unusually
pure, distinct tone not found in modern-day bells, said the rector,
the Rev. Victor Sokolov.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an art form,'' Sokolov said. ``Nothing exists today of
this caliber anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The church and its bells are a popular attraction in the city.
Guides regularly begin their tours by listening to the bells every
Sunday at 10 a.m. at Van Ness Avenue and Green Street.
</P>
<P>
   Choir members noticed the bells missing when they prepared to
ring them before the 6 p.m. service on Saturday. At first they
thought painters might have moved them, but an extensive search of
the building failed to turn them up.
</P>
<P>
   After a call to the painting company confirmed that workers had
not moved the bells, church officials notified the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just stunned,'' Sokolov said. ``This is a sacred space,
but it's not anymore sacred.''
</P>
<P>
   The bell tower stands some 50 feet off the ground, and normally
is accessible only from inside the church. The doors of the church
are locked and protected by an alarm system.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 days, however, parts of the two-story wooden
church have been undergoing repairs needed after a fire on Easter
Day 1998. The unsolved arson destroyed parts of the church and
caused $20,000 in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials suspect the scaffolding surrounding the
building and covered by a dark green canvas provided easy access
and shelter to thieves.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the five Russian bells, two others cast in the
same time period in the United States make up the complete set of
seven bells.
</P>
<P>
   Each bell represents a different tone, the smallest bell of
about 10 inches in diameter providing the lighter sounds, while the
largest ``Great Bell'' provides deeper tones.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone absconding with a bell would need to cut or untie the
cables and clamps supporting it from the beams of the tower and
then either carry it down the narrow scaffolding or lower it,
perhaps with a rope.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov said the theft would be an impossible feat for one
person, and a difficult task for two.
</P>
<P>
   In response to the theft, church officials have moved some of
the bells inside but left the two largest _ one of them weighing
5,765 pounds and presumably too heavy to steal without heavy
machinery.

WALL STREET MAY FIND A LESSON IN THE TULIP 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SCOTT WINOKUR  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Beneficial as it is in so many ways, prosperity
also brings out the worst in people _ the greed, the stupidity, the
criminal lust.
</P>
<P>
   For eight years, the stock market has been through the roof. Our
culture has changed, as a result, in subtle and not-so-subtle ways,
most of them awful. You can't listen to the radio without hearing
some boob pitch an utterly implausible get-rich-quick-scheme. But
people evidently buy into this gibberish; otherwise, the ads
wouldn't run.
</P>
<P>
   A major mental disorder gripped the Dutch between 1634 and 1637,
``tulipomania,'' the primary symptom of which was the investment of
one's life savings in the bulbs of a new kind of flower from Asia
Minor, the tulip. People didn't tiptoe into disaster; they dove in,
head first, and drowned.
</P>
<P>
   Are we different 360 years later? I think not.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long bull market,'' said Securities and Exchange
Commission Chairman Arthur Levitt, ``has not only proven attractive
_ it's created a stampede.''
</P>
<P>
   It has gotten so bad today that some companies standing to
profit from the thundering herd's run for the riches have tried to
rein in the cattle, lest they themselves get trampled by the
ignorant greedheads who are their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Schwab and Co. of San Francisco has identified 1,000
stocks it will no longer allow to be used as collateral for margin
buying.
</P>
<P>
   The latest issue of ``Fidelity Outlook,'' the big mutual-funds
company's magazine for ``preferred customers,'' cautions readers
against ``obsessive, compulsive'' investing behavior and
``overconfidence.'' It suggests that ``fear of losing'' may play a
useful role as a psychological ``ballast.''
</P>
<P>
   Some years ago, the SEC added to its San Francisco office. From
there, the feds could sneak a peak at the shamming and scamming in
Silicon Valley, much of it Internet-related.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody sees other people making a lot in the market,'' said
SEC attorney Mike Dicke, ``and they want to get in on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Said assistant district administrator Helane Morrison: ``People
won't want to be left behind. Greed kicks in.''
</P>
<P>
   I was glad to hear the feds had nailed some of the alleged
idiots.
</P>
<P>
   Brett Henderson, 24, a securities analyst for Morgan Stanley
Dean Witter in Menlo Park, was accused Aug. 2 of civil and criminal
insider trading violations for allegedly participating with a buddy
in Ohio in a scheme that began last July.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assume everything they say is true, it was a four-week piece
of stupidity by a young person'''' said Cris Arguedas, a lawyer
representing Henderson.
</P>
<P>
   The deal went like this, the feds allege: the two young men
split profits 60-40, with Henderson's Ohio pal taking the larger
share for providing the capital, while Henderson provided the
illegal insider information available to him even at his
entry-level position.
</P>
<P>
   Total take: an alleged $54,000, which strikes me as a pittance
given the risk _ maybe enough for a new BMW, but that's about all.
</P>
<P>
   Dicke said: ``In the '90s we have seen insider trading move from
Wall Street to Main Street, and now we're seeing a resurgence of it
in the brokerage industry.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Aug. 2, the feds filed civil charges against 15 people
for allegedly engaging in an illegal stock manipulation scheme
involving a cheap airline stock, PSA Inc., a name intended to evoke
memories of the long-defunct Pacific Southwest Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   The case was part of a nationwide sweep targeting alleged fraud
involving microcap stocks _ the penny-ante offerings that often
escape regulatory oversight but provide scam artists with all sorts
of opportunities for big profits.
</P>
<P>
   According to the SEC, the PSA group _ including Edward Durante
of Orinda, Thomas J. Donahue of Santa Rosa and Daniel C. Sanders of
Martinez _ artificially drove up the price of the stock from 50
cents a share to $5 in two weeks last year, then watched it
plummet.
</P>
<P>
   They made $1 million in illegal profits in the process, the SEC
alleges, by secretly controlling the supply of PSA stock on the
market and lying about it to investors in order to inflate the
value. Losers included retirees who were bilked of sums in the six
figures, the SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   Donahue's lawyer Peter Goodman of San Francisco, said his client
denies wrongdoing. Lawyers for the others did not return telephone
calls.
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of how it all shakes out, Dicke's warning to the
little folks who get caught in the stampede is a good one:
``Investors need to do their homework.''

 &HT;    A WARY EGYPT HOSTS PEACE TALKS AS SPECTRE OF CAMP DAVID LOOMS
 &HT;    600&AMP;ADD
 &HT;    With MIDEAST-PEACE-0902.
 &HT;    By LARRY KAPLOW 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Egyptian Yasmin Mahdy remembers the hope she felt
as a teenager when she watched and videotaped the signing of the
Oslo Accords between Israel and the Palestinians in 1993. Now, that
peace process has stalled and she's wary as her country hosts the
latest attempt Thursday(Sept. 2) to revive it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody will be glued to the television for
this,'' says Mahdy, 22, a member of the American University of
Cairo's Model Arab League, a diplomatic club similar to a model
United Nations program. ``Ink on paper is good, but it has to be
implemented ... It might be only by the time we're almost dead that
we see something happen.''
</P>
<P>
   This amateur diplomat looks on skeptically as the old pro
diplomats, including U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright,
meet here Thursday with the chance of signing a new memorandum
outlining the next steps in the long-delayed Oslo process.
</P>
<P>
   The meeting comes in the same month 21 years ago that President
Jimmy Carter hosted the Camp David negotiations, in which Egypt,
the largest Arab country with 66 million people, became the first
Arab nation to make peace with Israel. The agreement returned the
Sinai Peninsula to Egypt, but the legacy of Camp David looms large
over Thursday's meeting and a peace process many Egyptians feel has
let them down, mainly because Palestinians, who many Egyptians call
``Arab brothers,'' are still without a state.
</P>
<P>
   ``Egypt's status in the world is very much determined by its
ability to influence the peace process,'' said political columnist
Mohamed Sid-Ahmed. ``Egypt wants to prove that it was right to
follow the peace process.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, many call the peace treaty with Israel the ``pharaoh's
peace,'' a reference to former President Anwar Sadat, who signed
the deal in March 1979. He sprung it on his people and fellow Arab
leaders shunned him. Barely any Arab leaders attended Sadat's
funeral after he was slain by a militant group opposed to the peace
process in 1981.
</P>
<P>
   His successor, Hosni Mubarak will host Albright Thursday.
Mubarak has stressed that Arabs need to be patient with Israel's
new Prime Minister Ehud Barak. He has pressured fellow Arab leader
Yasser Arafat to be flexible.
</P>
<P>
   Mubarak is sure to win his fourth term in office later in
September in a referendum vote, but a signing ceremony Thursday
could inject some enthusiasm into the vote.
</P>
<P>
   It is an indication of the Egyptian anxiety over Israel that
Mubarak, now in office 18 years, has only gone next door to visit
Israel once, to attend the funeral of slain Prime Minister Yitzhak
Rabin.
</P>
<P>
   The Egyptian press regularly warns of Israeli conspiracies. The
latest accused the Egyptian agriculture minister of being an
Israeli agent because he was letting Egyptian farmers train in
Israel and use Israeli seeds.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   A popular movie in Cairo is, ``The Girl from Israel,'' the story
of a seductress sent to undermine Egyptian values. Though many
Israelis vacation at Sinai beach resorts, few Egyptians venture
into Israel and many that do face scrutiny and harassment from
Egyptian authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Trade between Egypt and Israel is minimal and Egypt still lags
behind in key indicators _ per capita income in Egypt in 1997 was
about $4,400 compared to $17,500 in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Egyptian newspapers Wednesday warned that hope of a signing
Thursday should be tempered with the consideration, as one
columnist noted, that ``even Albright herself cannot guarantee that
Barak will keep his commitments.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   Wealthy and educated students at AUC are not typical of all
Egyptians, most of whom are preoccupied with making a living. But,
Mahdy is typical of many who feel that the principles their country
envisioned in peace have not been fulfilled.
</P>
<P>
   Primarily, the Camp David agreement called for a five-year
period before autonomy would be granted to Palestinians. That
autonomy has developed slowly and fallen short of the statehood
they still seek.
</P>
<P>
   When Mahdy hears Albright and other diplomats speak of their
goal for a ``comprehensive peace'' in the region within a couple
years, she worries it will be just a forced deal favoring Israel
and papering over the injustices to the Arabs.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in her Model Arab League training she learns that
countries act for their interests and, ultimately, peace is in the
interest of all the parties. She thinks it might take a generation,
however.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is as optimistic as you're going to get,'' she says.

   Depriving citizens of food has become a vicious tool of modern
warfare. And in Sudan, a poor country in East Africa, the
government is using hunger as a weapon. The Houston Chronicle, a
partner of the New York Times News Service, examines Sudan's
16-year-old civil war and the deaths of more than 2 million people,
more than any conflict since World War II.

THEY'VE GOT THE WORLD IN THEIR PALMS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a summer of relative leisure, when jobs or camp ate up
most of the day, the new school year can ring in a head-spinning
array of classes, athletic practices and after-school lessons. How
does the beleaguered student make sense of it all, and still
remember to hand in a history project by its due date?
</P>
<P>
   Most school-age children write their schedules in notebooks,
scribble appointments on the refrigerator or just rely on their
parents to remind them. But some, like 10-year-old Alden Mathieson
of Atlanta, are turning to handheld electronic organizers to keep
track of their time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to have a paper planner on my desk in my room, but I'd
write something down one day and not look at it again until after
I'd missed the appointment,'' said Alden, who now records all his
homework assignments and appointments in his Palm III organizer. A
two-toned chime will sound on the Palm III in his back pocket 15
minutes before a friend is due to arrive or on the night before a
report is due.
</P>
<P>
   For many children, of course, Palm Pilots and similar handheld
organizers are attractive because of the many games that can be
played on them or because of the programs for things like
calculators or dictionaries that can be loaded onto them to help
with schoolwork. But increasingly, students are following their
parents' lead, using the devices to help schedule their lives.
</P>
<P>
   Does a child really need an electronic organizer? Many parents
would say no, that children often have too much to do and that an
organizer just encourages overscheduling. But other parents are
supporting the use of the devices by their children.
</P>
<P>
   Mike Elgan, who publishes a weekly online Palm newsletter, The
Palmreader (www.thepalreader.com), said he had given his Palm III
to his 10-year-old son, Kenny, when he upgraded to a Palm V.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been warming to it more and more and is starting to
record his friends' phone numbers and keep track of his own
schedule,'' said Elgan, of Elmont, N.Y. ``But the thing he uses it
the most for at this point is games. He likes chess and arcade
games like Pac-Man. It's good for long car trips or when we're
waiting for a table in a restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents, however, say they are a little perplexed by their
children's desire to use organizers.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Shannon of Los Angeles, who has boys 6 and 9 years old,
said that after his older son, Zachary, had expressed interest in
the To Do lists on Shannon's Palm III, they had set about creating
one for the boy. It included tasks like ``feed the dogs'' and
``help Mom with the dishes.''
</P>
<P>
   Shannon said that his son got satisfaction from checking off
completed items but that he himself could not remember wanting _ or
needing _ to keep track of daily functions when he was that age.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a couple of chores, but the only thing that mattered was
that I would have enough time afterward to go out and play,'' he
said. ``The same thing was true the next day and the day after
that. As for the rest of it, I didn't care.''
</P>
<P>
   The process of scheduling appointments, which originated in the
workplace, has not only moved into the home but has also altered to
some extent how people structure their lives outside the office,
said Jan English-Lueck, an associate professor of anthropology at
San Jose State University. Dr. English-Lueck directs the Silicon
Valley Works Project, which studies technology's effects on work
and family.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people tend to schedule appointments at work in
hourly increments,'' Dr. English-Lueck said. ``Even when a meeting
might take only 20 minutes, they still set aside an hour block.
This approach seems to translate seamlessly to their kids, and it
fuels the way people handle schedules at home.''
</P>
<P>
   Some parents with children who use electronic organizers say
they appreciate being relieved of the burden of insuring that their
children make their appointments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Kids have to be reminded of things all the time,'' said Peter
Fiekowsky of Los Altos, Calif., whose 11-year-old son, Daniel, uses
his Palm III to keep track of homework assignments, piano lessons
and morning exercise routines. ``Now the Palm beeps, and I don't
have to be the bad guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The reason Daniel often has his Palm with him, however, is
because he is an avid fan of Sub Hunt and Hardball, two of the
hundreds of games available for the Palm that can be downloaded
from the Internet. Like many children, Daniel was initially
attracted to the games on the Palm, he started learning how to use
the scheduling features later.
</P>
<P>
   Some students do schoolwork on their organizers. Joe Malchow, a
14-year-old resident of Scotch Plains, N.J., who last year designed
a student scheduler for the Palm, writes book reports, short
stories and other English projects directly on his Palm III.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can input words into my Palm almost as fast as I can write
on paper,'' he said. ``About the only thing I can't do are math
problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Even though Joe cannot write out long equations for math
assignments on his Palm, dozens of numeric and scientific
calculator programs are available for Palms, as well as
applications that convert currencies, weights and other
measurements.
</P>
<P>
   Electronic organizers are not as ubiquitous among teen-agers as
cell phones or pagers. ``I'm still the only kid in my class with a
Palm,'' Joe Malchow said. ``But I think that will change,
especially because they've gotten a lot cheaper.''
</P>
<P>
   In July, Palm Computing, a division of 3Com, began selling a
less expensive version of its popular Palm III, the IIIe. And
several companies have recently introduced Palm-like organizers
that are even less expensive, including some in the $100 range.
</P>
<P>
   Although there are elementary, middle and high schools that
allow children to use the built-in calculators found in most
electronic organizers while in the classroom, many schools consider
them to be like Gameboys and other portable games.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Many teachers also wonder about their value as an educational
tool.
</P>
<P>
   ``As with calculators, children can rely too much on technology
without learning the real skills,'' said Janice Levitan, an
elementary school teacher in Austin, Texas, who says she still
remembers the phone numbers of her childhood friends. ``I don't
think students should have a combination
Gameboy-calculator-organizer at a time when their lives should
still be relatively simple.''
</P>
<P>
   But most parents of children who use organizers say they help
children learn to keep track of their days.
</P>
<P>
   Alden Mathieson's mother, Wendy Shapiro, said: ``We think it
will help him in middle school, when he has to go to a different
classroom for every period. He has an incredible memory now, but
his organizer will come in handy when things get more
complicated.''

<P>
   Like hundreds of thousands of other high school students, Greg
Myers, 16, began using a graphing calculator in freshman algebra.
</P>
<P>
   Graphing calculators, which bear little resemblance to their
1970s ancestors, are sophisticated devices that can run small
computer programs and draw the graph represented by complex
equations in an instant.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few years, they have become mandatory in many high
school math classes and can be used on the SAT and advanced
placement exams and other standardized tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``I use graphing calculators all the time, and am a big
enthusiast,'' Greg said. ``In my math class last year, I was known
as the expert on graphing calculators.''
</P>
<P>
   And like many of his high school peers, Greg has found another
use for his calculator, a Texas Instruments TI-83. He has gone into
business with his brother, Douglas, 17, writing 20 programs that
can be fed into graphing calculators to help solve math problems in
the SAT exam and SAT II subject tests.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no work involved, you just run the program, plug in
the known values, and watch your answers appear,'' says their Web
site (members.aol.com/highersat). The brothers are charging $35 for
the programs and guarantee that a student's score will rise by 160
points or more. They said they had not had many takers so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we don't take credit cards,'' Greg said. ``It's got
to be check, money order or cash. If things get better, we'll
probably start accepting credit cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Graphing calculators, which cost around $100, are lauded as the
greatest innovation in math classrooms in a generation. Proponents
say they lift students' confidence, cultivate their analytical
adeptness and make mathematics more tangible. But they have also
given students new ways to one-up their teachers and the rules.
</P>
<P>
   In response, adults have been forced to develop more
sophisticated defenses, tests and regulations. Even while they
solve difficult problems, graphing calculators have changed the
political equation in the classroom.
</P>
<P>
   Greg contends that his and his brother's programs are not
cheating. ``Cheating is violating regulations unfairly, but our
programs do not violate any regulations,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Graphing calculator programs are allowed on College Board
examinations. Teachers and test administrators say that the arrival
of the calculators allow questions to focus more on problem
solving, rather than plug-and-chug calculations, and they are
skeptical about claims like those of the Myers brothers.
</P>
<P>
   The two brothers, who attend Princeton Day School, a private
school in Princeton, N.J., said that they anticipated a potentially
large market for their wares.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instruments, which dominates the market for high school
graphing calculators, estimates that one-quarter to one-half of all
high school math students use graphing calculators and that nearly
all of them take the SAT I or SAT II. Hewlett-Packard and Casio
have a small share of that market.
</P>
<P>
   ``These calculators are handheld computers,'' said Ellen Hook of
Norfolk, Va., who has been teaching high school math for 20 years.
``They are marvelous. I can do more mathematics better now than I
could 15 years ago. Students' critical thinking skills have
changed.''
</P>
<P>
   Since their introduction in high schools in the early 1990s,
graphing calculators have not only pushed students to expand their
mathematical reasoning skills but have also fired up their
ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Sullivan, 15, a student in Georgetown, Texas, used his
Texas Instruments calculator to explore the structure of triangles
in trigonometry. The algorithms that computed the intricate
relations among cosines, angles and lengths gave him an
appreciation for the elegance of math and programming. ``You can
understand how math comes together more,'' Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   But once Charles is convinced that he understands the math, he
simply programs his calculator to do the number-crunching for him.
``In math class a lot of the homework is routine, you can do it
over and over,'' he said. ``If you know it, you can whip out your
calculator, write a program and press Enter a couple of times, and
you've got your answer.''
</P>
<P>
   The graphing calculator is also his weapon against boredom.
Charles keeps a number of games like Space Invaders and Tetris on
his calculator, and he has no qualms about playing them in class.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Instrument calculators are essentially Nintendo Game Boys
in disguise _ they have a nearly identical microprocessor with less
obtrusive packaging. ``If some kid brought a Game Boy into class,
they'd be sent to the office, whereas a graphing calculator can't
get you into trouble,'' Charles said.
</P>
<P>
   There are now hundreds of games, including Pac-Man and the
Legend of Zelda and versions of Mario Brothers, available for
graphing calculators. The majority of them are written by students
and are available free for downloading on www.ticalc.org and other
sites on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The games can then be transferred to the calculators through a
cable. Students can also exchange games with each other by
connecting their calculators, and it is possible to make the
calculators communicate through infrared signals.
</P>
<P>
   Games became popular only after the Texas Instruments assembly
language, the most basic level of programming, became commonly
available. But that itself came about because of student ingenuity
at work.
</P>
<P>
   Originally, Texas Instruments had decided not to release the
assembly language, which provides the most efficient building
blocks for programming.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had internal bets to see if people could figure out the
assembly language,'' said Richard Schaar, a vice president at Texas
Instruments. ``But then kids figured it out their own. They
reverse-engineered the assembly language.'' The engineers at Texas
Instruments were impressed.
</P>
<P>
   Students like to play games on the graphing calculators because
they blend into an educational setting. But teachers are not easily
fooled.
</P>
<P>
   ``If the kids are moving the keys real fast on the calculator,
you know something's up,'' said Sam Powell, a math and computer
teacher from Middlebury, Ind. ``Usually you walk around the class
and quietly ask the kid not to play on the calculator, and they
usually comply.''

`OUTSIDE PROVIDENCE' GETS THE '70S RIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The ads for ``Outside Providence'' trumpet its connection to
``There's Something About Mary's'' creators, the Farrelly brothers,
leading viewers to expect another politically incorrect, gross-out
comedy. The opening scenes don't dispel this notion; they're home
movies of a bike-riding teen-age boy towing his little brother
along on a paper route in his wheelchair, with their one-eyed,
three-legged dog running behind. Somehow, you expect the dog and
the kid in the wheelchair to suffer indignities inspiring guilty
laughter.
</P>
<P>
   They do, but not as graphically as you might expect, because
``Outside Providence'' isn't simply a Farrelly brothers movie. What
the ads don't say is that it's directed by Michael Corrente, who
gave 1994's ``Federal Hill'' a sense of grit. He layers ``Outside
Providence'' with unusual perception, charm and depth while not
slighting its laugh quotient. It's the best coming-of-age film in a
year that sometimes seems dedicated to the genre.
</P>
<P>
   That young man on the bike is dumb-but-sweet Tim Dunphy (Shawn
Hatosy, allowed to stand out rather than get lost in a teen
ensemble as he was in ``The Faculty''). It's 1974 in Pawtucket,
R.I., and ``Dunph'' does what most guys like him did back then _ he
hangs out. He loves his little brother, has a love-hate
relationship with his blue-collar single father, and spends most of
his free time getting high and talking about life with his buddies.
</P>
<P>
   That means mostly talking about sex, although there's no
evidence that Dunph or his buddies have any sexual experience. For
all their banter, they never seem to have any girls around. Even
when one pulls Dunph onto a disco floor, he's uncomfortable,
dancing with his arms folded as if he instinctively knows that this
incipient fad is a threat to his long-haired, field-jacket-clad way
of life.
</P>
<P>
   But he also suspects that he's a little different from his
friends, and he finds out more about himself when he's shipped to a
prep school after an unfortunate car accident.
</P>
<P>
   The prep school is a way of keeping Dunph out of jail, although
it has so many rules it doesn't seem like much of an alternative.
Naturally, Dunph hates it at first, but he soon discovers that
other students like to get high and talk about life; they're merely
smarter, better-dressed versions of his Pawtucket friends (one of
them owns a bong that would make Cheech and Chong bow in worship).
Dunph also discovers Jane ``(Varsity Blues''' Amy Smart), an
intelligent, fresh-faced blonde who just happens to like getting
stoned and hanging out, but who also has ambitions that begin to
rub off on Dunph.
</P>
<P>
   The plot of ``Outside Providence'' isn't particularly new;
what's different is the knowing observation that Corrente brings to
the story (he co-wrote the screenplay with Bobby and Peter
Farrelly, working from the latter's brief novel). Unlike the makers
of the likable but uneven ``Dick'' and the execrable ``Detroit Rock
City,'' Corrente actually appears to have lived in the '70s and
doesn't have to rely on celebrity impersonations or sharp set
design to evoke the period.
</P>
<P>
   You get the sense that he knew guys like Dunph and his buds, and
he brings as much poignancy to the teens' impromptu memorial
service for a friend as he brings humor to the prep school's very
formal dean reading of a stoned-out letter written by one of
Dunph's friends (despite all the pot-smoking in this movie, it
contains more than a few anti-drug messages).
</P>
<P>
   Corrente and the Farrellys deftly balance views of Dunph's two
cliques and his dad's poker-playing friends, who are merely
grown-up versions of male-bonders. Alec Baldwin gives his best
performance since 1992's ``Glengarry Glen Ross'' as Dunph's
none-too-bright dad, particularly in an emotional scene in which he
tells Dunph just why his mother left them. But his portrayal is
just one of many that give multiple dimensions to a character that,
in other hands, would be a mere stereotype.
</P>
<P>
   The '70s have done so poorly in movies lately that it's a wonder
people keep making films about the decade. Even the vibrant
``Boogie Nights'' was a box-office disappointment. But ``Outside
Providence'' gets it right, with astonishing tenderness for a movie
with such clueless characters. We've seen so many teen-age tales
this year that we're approaching burnout, and that leads to concern
about how well this movie will do as it kicks off the film biz's
off-season. With any luck, the Farrelly name will draw audiences,
and they'll be pleasantly surprised by a movie with considerable
humor, and even more heart.

SAM-E: IS IT THE E-Z WAY TO HEALTH AND HAPPINESS?

   Don Smith, an executive with General Nutrition Center in
Pittsburgh, says his staff loves the new dietary supplement SAM-e.
They love it because Smith, the boss, takes the supplement, and he
credits it with improving his mood.
</P>
<P>
   ``Things just don't get to me as much,'' Smith says.
</P>
<P>
   It's reports like his and a flurry of media coverage that have
bottles of SAM-e (pronounced ``Sammy'') flying off the shelves of
health-food stores and drugstores nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   ``We sell out in a couple days every time we get some in,'' says
Anthony Foreman, sales associate at a General Nutrition Center in
Grapevine, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   SAM-e is credited not only with improving moods, but also with
promoting flexibility and cleansing the liver of toxins. Plus, some
consumers say it aids in weight loss.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are coming in wanting to know if it will make them
dinner and serve it to them, too,'' says Egil Gude, nutrition team
leader at the Whole Foods grocery store in Arlington.
</P>
<P>
   It's not a miracle drug, Gude tells them. But SAM-e is popular
not just because it is new on the market but because it has gotten
a lot of publicity as a supplement that may aid several ills.
</P>
<P>
   SAM-e is S-adenosylmethionine, a compound produced by all plants
and animals. It is a naturally occurring part of many biochemical
reactions, including the manufacture of joint cartilage and the
maintenance of nerve cell membranes. Nature Made, a vitamin
manufacturer that sells SAM-e, says that studies show some people,
particularly the elderly, have low levels of naturally occurring
SAM-e and would benefit from supplements.
</P>
<P>
   After two decades of use in Europe, SAM-e went on sale in the
United States this year. It ranges in price from about $25 to $45
for a package of 20 pills. Nature Made recommends from one to eight
pills a day, with two a day the most effective dose for most
people. Most people, then, should expect to pay $75 to $135 a month
for a supply of SAM-e.

 UNDATED: usually comply.''

<P>
   Teachers are also becoming aware of the power of calculators on
tests. Many teachers make students erase programs from their
calculators before exams, and some standardized tests make clear
calculator memories mandatory.
</P>
<P>
   But a number of utilities exist that can make it appear that a
calculator's memory is clear even though it still has programs in
memory. The utilities either throw up a screen that mimics the real
Mem Clear display, or they can make the list of programs disappear
while leaving them accessible to those who know the specific names
of the programs.
</P>
<P>
   Calculators have even had educational impacts beyond
quantitative subjects. A few years ago, French and history teachers
approached Ms. Hook because they were curious about why students
were using their graphing calculators during their tests. Ms. Hook
quickly deduced that students were storing information for the
tests as text in the memory of the calculator. Now calculators are
forbidden for such tests.
</P>
<P>
   Teachers are wising up.
</P>
<P>
   ``A teacher that is smart enough to use technology is smart
enough to know what students are doing,'' Ms. Hook said.
``Physically clear the calculator yourself. Don't just accept a
blank screen.'' At her school, some teachers get together after
school to have a calculator-clearing session.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than fighting students' programs, some teachers are
redesigning their exams to take the programs into account.
</P>
<P>
   ``My level of sophistication has changed in what we ask the kids
to do,'' Ms. Hook said. ``I never ask a question that just depends
on calculator use. You want to mix the question with analysis.''
Occasionally she will even distribute programs for the graphing
calculators for students to use on tests.
</P>
<P>
   The Educational Testing Service, which offers the SAT, says
students who use calculators on the SAT I, the general college
admission test, do slightly better than students who do not. But
that is because those students can avoid computational errors, not
because of the design of the test, said Kevin Gonzalez, a spokesman
for the service. Calculator programs will not help on the tests,
the testing service said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing about the test that is geared to the
calculator,'' Gonzalez said. ``This is mathematical reasoning _
it's not one plus one equal two. It's not a test of what you know,
it's how you apply what you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Then what about the Myers brothers' programs? Douglas Myers said
he had raised his score on a SAT math subject test by 90 points, to
700, in part because he used his programs _ only about a third of
them were available at the time. On his first try, Greg scored a
640 on a similar test, but he said he planned to use the graphing
calculator again.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of common formulas and stuff that you have to
use,'' Greg said. ``To have programs to do them faster without
mistakes for a long problem really helps, especially the speed
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Others are skeptical about the brothers' contentions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their claims are logically implausible,'' said Robert
Schaeffer, public education director of Fairtest, a nonprofit
testing watchdog organization based in Cambridge, Mass. ``It's hard
to believe that it would be a significant boost to anybody's scores
since so few questions involve calculators of any form. The basic
formulas are supplied on the test booklets.''
</P>
<P>
   But he gives the brothers credit for their ingenuity. ``It's
creative marketing,'' he said. ``And it's creative programming to
get the power of that handheld to get that kind of information.''
</P>
<P>
   Other students have used graphing calculators to show their
flair for engineering. Charles Sullivan is constructing a pair of
infrared links based on designs he found on the Internet. He plans
to lend an infrared accessory to friends so their calculators can
communicate using invisible signals. ``During the test, I can be
giving answers across the room or getting answers across the
room,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Sami Khawam, 19, an engineering student at the University of
Edinburgh in Scotland, began the design for the infrared accessory
for the Texas Instrument calculators while he was in high school.
The infrared link can act as a universal remote control that can
send commands to televisions and VCRs.
</P>
<P>
   ``The calculator is also able to receive IR data, thus making it
controllable by any remote control device,'' Khawam said.
</P>
<P>
   The infrared devices have raised some eyebrows, but some doubt
that they can be used effectively to cheat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The concern with calculators is that there are some schools
who are afraid that students can use this IR feature to cheat on
exams,'' said Whit Hickman, a technical sales manager at
Hewlett-Packard. ``The reality of that happening is that you have
to be within two inches of each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, in response to the criticism, Hewlett-Packard
pulled the infrared feature from one of its latest models of
graphing calculators.
</P>
<P>
   The cat-and-mouse game between teachers and students will
probably accelerate as calculators grow even more sophisticated.
The latest generation of Texas Instrument calculators now have what
is known as flash memory, which gives the calculator the
flexibility to offer functions beyond mathematics. A calculator
could, for example, act as a handheld digital organizer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can see the handheld devices getting pretty close to the
Apple IIe functionality from the early 1980s,'' predicted Jim
Kaput, a professor at the University of Massachusetts at Dartmouth.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hook said the increasing power of calculators was a positive
trend. The more power in the hands of her students, the better, she
said. ``I think that is exactly what we need for this generation,''
she explained. ``They need to be in control.''

JAPAN RESOLUTION DIVIDES ASIAN-AMERICANS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM WONG  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PIEDMONT, Calif. _ Behind the California Assembly's demand that
Japan apologize and pay for atrocities before and during World War
II is a tangle of politics and emotions that has divided many
Japanese-Americans and Chinese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the legislators approved a resolution sponsored by
Assemblyman Mike Honda, D-San Jose, that the Japanese government
formally acknowledge atrocities committed by the Japanese Imperial
military throughout Asia from 1931 to 1945 and provide unspecified
compensation for victims.
</P>
<P>
   At first blush, it seems odd that California lawmakers would
step so directly into what appears to be a foreign policy issue.
</P>
<P>
   But Honda and his supporters (mainly Chinese-Americans) don't
think it's odd at all. They view the matter as one of human rights
that transcends national boundaries and ethnic considerations.
</P>
<P>
   That Honda, 58, is a third-generation Japanese-American makes
his leadership on this touchy issue all the more remarkable.
</P>
<P>
   The nuances and ironies in this case are a fascinating study of
the richly complex political development of the diverse
Asian-American communities here in California and nationally. Those
promoting the issue are affluent Chinese immigrants living in
Silicon Valley who carry direct or indirect memories of the
horrendous Asian chaos two generations ago. They pushed for a
similar congressional resolution last year, but didn't succeed. It
is the depth of their emotions that has propelled this issue into
the public's consciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Other Chinese-American activists, however, have concentrated on
a different political agenda. It includes, among other issues,
getting Bill Lann Lee confirmed by the Senate as an assistant
attorney general; favoring a statistical sampling method in the
next Census; opposing immigration restrictions and welfare cuts
against legal immigrants; and supporting stronger hate-crime laws.
</P>
<P>
   In light of the campaign financing scandal involving some Asians
and Asian-Americans and the spying allegations against a
Chinese-American scientist, these latter activists have worked
strenuously to get Congress and the news media to make distinctions
between Asian-Americans and Asian nationals.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Honda resolution is not a domestic issue. It does not
belong in the California Legislature. It perpetuates the myth we
are foreign,'' said one Asian-American political activist, who
asked for anonymity. ``It compromises the battle that
Asian-Americans are fighting, that we are loyal to our root Asian
homelands.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Japanese-Americans are upset with Honda because they fear
backlash from Americans who may consider them more Japanese than
American. For many Japanese-Americans, especially those who were
interned in camps during World War II, the matter of a distinct
American identity has been crucial to their efforts to persuade
Americans they aren't loyal to Japan. Ironically, according to some
sources, Japanese-Americans who oppose the Honda resolution won't
speak out publicly for fear their opposition will be interpreted as
endorsing Japan's heinous acts half a century ago.
</P>
<P>
   Honda's assertiveness on this issue demonstrates that there
should be no confusion between Japanese-Americans and Japanese
nationals.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, some Japanese-Americans support Honda. One is Dr.
Clifford Uyeda, former national president of the Japanese-American
Citizens League.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're not betraying the country of your parents or
grandparents by criticizing it,'' the retired pediatrician said.
``We Americans criticize the U.S. government all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   Another irony is the fact that a decade ago, when Japanese
companies were buying up American icons like the Rockefeller
Center, some Americans engaged in unfettered Japan-bashing.
</P>
<P>
   Japanese-Americans and other Asian-Americans protested. Now we
have a Japanese-American politician unapologetically bashing Japan,
in the estimation of some other Japanese-Americans.
</P>
<P>
   This dust-up certainly disabuses those naive enough to believe
Asian-Americans are of one mind politically and emotionally.

 &HT;    MISSING AT SEA: A FAMILY'S STORY OF STRUGGLE AND SURVIVAL
 &HT;    With Photos
 &HT;    Advance for Sunday, Sept. 5
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c. 1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEAN CITY, Md. _ The Stewarts of southwestern Ohio had been at
sea for 11 days when they made this notation in the log they'd been
keeping: ``readying to abandon ship if nec (necessary).''
</P>
<P>
   The Jolly Joyce departed Newport, R. I., uneventfully on July
26, heading for Fort Lauderdale to see a marine mechanic they
trusted with the twin diesels in their 65-foot boat.
</P>
<P>
   Under sail, Rick and Deb Stewart, with their 16-year-old son and
12-year-old daughter, were making a few knots of headway with a
light breeze pulling the heavy, wooden hull through a small chop in
the Atlantic Ocean. The freedom of being underway was a release.
</P>
<P>
   For the Stewarts, the past year had been a rocky one filled with
high excitement and deadening frustration. Last Tuesday, in Ocean
City, Md., where the U.S. Coast Guard towed their boat several days
earlier and ended reports that they had been missing, the Stewarts
discussed their experiences.
</P>
<P>
   They were supposed to have made a dramatic leap from suburban
family in Ludlow Falls, Ohio, to vagabond sailors of the world last
November, but the transition was coming in halting spurts.
</P>
<P>
   The day they emptied their house in Ohio and put it on the
market last fall, they thought they'd never see it again. The boat
was in Fort Lauderdale, waiting, and they were eager to begin a few
years of exotic ports of call and home-schooling for the kids.
</P>
<P>
   But the Jolly Joyce wasn't ready as expected, and the Stewarts
did see their house again. At Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a bit of a downer,'' Deb, 47, said.
</P>
<P>
   The latest setback had been Newport itself, where a conspiracy
of more mechanical trouble and a local lack of necessary parts kept
them trapped at the dock for six long weeks. When the Stewarts
chose to depart, they promptly headed off shore to avoid the
powerful northward sweep of the Gulf Stream, and soon had sailed
out of contact with everyone on earth.
</P>
<P>
   The Stewarts finally were at sea, bravely living a private
adventure they'd chosen as their mission only three years before.
But after days of radio silence, their family, friends and the
Coast Guard began thinking they'd been lost.
</P>
<P>
   ``We may have been the least worried of anybody,'' Rick Stewart
says now, with the Jolly Joyce pinned to a dock in Ocean City by
the peripheral winds of Hurricane Dennis.
</P>
<P>
   An air search turned up nothing because the Stewart's strategy
of dodging the Gulf Stream wasn't working. They'd taken off without
the use of the port engine, which needed to be rebuilt, and with
only emergency use of the starboard engine, which had a major oil
leak. The plan to sail all the way to Florida was meeting
significant resistance from the weather.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first days went well and Stewart laced his log book
entries with commentary on their progress that included words such
as ``nice'' and ``perfect direction,'' circumstances soon would
change.
</P>
<P>
   Within days, a series of violent thunderstorms halted their
southward progress and planted them in the Gulf Stream's path.
Their tenth night at sea was spent engulfed in a thunderstorm
``which refused to move and refused to release the boat. Both bilge
pumps failed forcing us to hand bail the bilge. (200 gals.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's on edge; need some sleep.''
</P>
<P>
   And the trouble wasn't behind them. More storms drove them
backward (``sure will be glad to get engines back!'') and tore the
sail on the mizzenmast, the smaller of the two at the back of the
boat. The bilge pump, which pulls water from the inner cavity of
the hull and pumps it overboard, still wasn't working.
</P>
<P>
   And so they considered the possibility that they'd have to
abandon the boat. But the dire moments passed, if only to return,
and the Jolly Joyce plunged on against the sea. In the weeks that
followed, as the 10-day sailboat ride down to Florida stretched
into 34 days on the ocean, trouble plagued the Stewarts.
</P>
<P>
   After losing the mizzen, another storm kicked up and tore the
main sail at the corner point, called the clew, where the sail is
attached to lines that stretch it back. Using scraps of string they
pieced the sail together, only to see it break again. Three times.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was like, `Oh, the clew tore, OK let's put it back,''' said
Chad Stewart, 16.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, a combination of heavy fishing line and nylon straps
provided a repair that withstood the elements.
</P>
<P>
   But on day 15, still less than halfway through their time at
sea, another storm (``lightning in all quadrants'') dealt a
crippling blow that ultimately helped determine that the Stewarts
wouldn't be going to Florida and would instead need to seek a port
where they could find it.
</P>
<P>
   The rudder broke.
</P>
<P>
   Riding six-foot seas in gale-force winds of 30 knots and more,
the wheel of the Jolly Joyce suddenly went dead. The autopilot
wouldn't hold coordinates and when Deb Stewart grabbed the wheel,
it spun freely.
</P>
<P>
   Soon, they discovered that the hydraulic system that connects
the wheel to the rudder had broken. And soon after that the
emergency tiller _ a metal pipe that fits on a peg atop the rudder
itself _ had broken, too.
</P>
<P>
   Bobbing in a tumultuous sea, the Stewarts began sailing and
drifting and sailing and drifting, steering their 60-ton ketch with
a screw driver jammed into the hole at the top of the rudder.
</P>
<P>
   When they had been back in port, where there had been nothing to
do for days on end, the Stewarts had begun reading the Bible. Not
in any serious, religious way, but simply as another valuable way
to spend time together. After watching the reruns of Seinfeld and
Jeopardy they could pick up on their small television, they read
passages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It turned out OK,'' Deb said about goading the kids into
taking turns reading from the Bible, ``we had a lot of fun doing
it, and a lot of knowledge gained.''
</P>
<P>
   But at sea, who has time? Once, 12-year-old Mischa raced for the
Bible and began leafing through it for inspiration to a prayer when
the winch on the anchor pulled out of the deck and she was scared
to death. But that was months ago, in the Florida Keys on a short
trip designed to get them and their boat ready for a long cruise up
the eastern seaboard.
</P>
<P>
   Now, off in the Atlantic, the Stewarts were accustomed to their
roles and went about their business. They took turns trying to
steer with the screwdriver as they sought to raise a passing boat
for a radio check.
</P>
<P>
   For Rick Stewart, none of the strain that had enveloped them in
the weeks at sea was dampening his enthusiasm for the new life he'd
chosen for his family.
</P>
<P>
   Back at the dock last week, he admitted he's a man who plunges
forward.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somewhere along in my life I decided I was going to do what I
want to do,'' Rick Stewart, 50, said. ``Money has never been that
important to me. I've made a lot and I've spent a fair amount.''
</P>
<P>
   When he wanted to be a pilot he went to an airfield, started
lessons and in due time had his license. Then he bought a plane,
then he bought more.
</P>
<P>
   He grew up all over the place, as his family moved with his
father's job as an executive with a national chain of bakeries that
operated under a variety of names, among them Colonial Bakery. When
the Anheuser-Busch Co. bought the bakery, one of its largest yeast
customers, the Stewart family ended up being large shareholder's in
the beer giant, Stewart said.
</P>
<P>
   Later, Stewart struck another stock deal when the Dayton, Ohio,
company where he was vice president and general counsel was bought
out. Allied Paper had been a division of Smith Corona Corp., and
specialized in making office forms and supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, Stewart has been in the video business, owning a pair of
Video Vault stores in southwestern Ohio. But he fantasizes about
owning a bar on an island somewhere, schmoozing with the customers,
and shoving off when he gets tired of it.
</P>
<P>
   Money isn't important. But Control is.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't discouraging,'' Stewart said of their string or
problems at sea, ``because we were in control of our fate.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Coast Guard greeted them about 15 miles off the coast
of Maryland, Stewart declined an offer to be towed. Later that
night the Coast Guard returned and insisted.
</P>
<P>
   ``You wonder,'' Deb said as her husband spoke, ``if we should be
doing this with the kids. If we should have waited until they were
18 to go do this ourselves because you feel guilty, you know, about
how much peril you're putting them in.''
</P>

   But Deb and Rick Stewart both said they like the way the kids
have responded to their trials at sea. They're more confident, and
more responsible. More familiar with the power of teamwork.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good for them when it's all said and done,'' she said.
``The surprise is they're as far along as they are in this short
time.''

   Q: .MDNM/I'm trying to identify the novel and author of the
following quote, ``It was a dark and stormy night on the west coast
of Scotland.'' I'm informed it is from a nonsense novel. Can you
help? _ D.R., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ That's the opening sentence of ``Gertrude the
Governess,'' a story by humorist Stephen Leacock from his 1911 book
``Nonsense Novels.''
</P>
<P>
   The story's next line: ``This, however, is immaterial to the
present story, as the scene is not laid in the West of Scotland.''
</P>
<P>
   Another memorable quote from the same story: ``Lord Ronald said
nothing; he flung himself from the room, flung himself upon his
horse and rode madly off in all directions.''
</P>
<P>
   Leacock, who lived from 1869 to 1944, wrote several humorous
books and essays and headed the McGill University political science
and economics department for many years.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ I'd like to write to Anthony Quinn, the actor and
artist, to inform him about the popularity of his work in my
country. How can I contact him? _ M.B., Secunderabad, India
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Write to Quinn at Box 479, Bristol, RI 02809-0479.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, 84, has been exhibiting art since the early '80s. In
December, he teamed with his son, Lorenzo, to display more than 90
works in Seoul, Korea.
</P>
<P>
   His next film appearance is likely to be in ``Ringside,'' a film
directed by Norman Mailer that also stars Paul Sorvino and Halle
Berry.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for Quinn's six-decade, two-profession career:
13 children with five women, including 3- and 5-year-olds with his
current wife, Kathy Benvin.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Was George Hamilton ever a member of ``The A-Team,''
the series with Mr. T? _ T.G., Brownwood
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ The only George on the team was Peppard, who played
Col. John ``Hannibal'' Smith.
</P>
<P>
   The other members were Dirk Benedict as Templeton ``Faceman''
Peck, Dwight Schultz as H.M. ``Howling Mad'' Murdock and Mr. T as
Bosco ``Bad Attitude'' Baracus.
</P>
<P>
   The NBC series aired from 1983 to 1987.

JACK LORD WASN'T MUCH FOR WRITING
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Did the guy who used to star in ``Hawaii Five-O,'' Jack
Lord, ever write an autobiography? _ G.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ The fiercely private actor, who died in 1998 at age 77,
does not appear to have written any books. The closest he came to
revealing anything personal in print may have been Jack's Favorite
Watercress Soup, a recipe he and wife Marie Lord contributed to the
1974 ``Hawaiian Celebrities Cookbook''.
</P>
<P>
   A 1971 ``TV Guide'' article states that Jack Lord was planning a
book on Hawaii, but none turned up in a Library of Congress search.
</P>
<P>
   The article, which details Lord's efforts to control how he was
portrayed in the news media, quotes several things the actor added
to his network biography. Lord wrote that he was ``a highly
disciplined product of the theater, steeped in the art of acting''
and that he possessed ``a striking facial bone structure for which
the cameras have an affinity.''
</P>
<P>
   During his acting career, Lord also claimed to be born in 1930
rather than 1920.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ What does it mean when the announcers on ESPN and other
channels say ``come join us, we are a part of the GO Network''? _
A.B., via the Internet
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ On Jan. 12, Disney and Infoseek launched the GO
Network, a World Wide Web site that combined Infoseek with several
successful Disney Internet properties: ABC, ABC News, Disney, ESPN,
Family.Com and Mr. Showbiz.
</P>
<P>
   The combined Web site attracts more than 20 million visitors
each month and is the fourth-most-visited ``portal'' on the
Internet, according to the technology news service CNET.
</P>
<P>
   The site, which is published at www.go.com, is mentioned
whenever a Disney TV channel's Web site is referred to on the air.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1998, Disney purchased 43 percent of Infoseek in
exchange for $70 million in cash and its ownership stake in
Starwave, a Web design company.
</P>
<P>
   Q:.MDNM/ Is Turkish Taffy by Bonomo still being made? _ T.B.,
Whitinsville, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   A:.MDNM/ Turkish Taffy is no longer available, but Sweety's
Candies sells a similar-tasting product called ``DORK
double-flavored taffy.''
</P>
<P>
   The candy comes in chocolate/banana, blue raspberry/marshmallow,
strawberry/banana, and chocolate/cherry flavors, and sells for
$5.40 per carton of 36.
</P>
<P>
   To order, call (888) 793-3897 or visit the World Wide Web site
mall0.register.com/sweetys.
</P>
<P>
   Sweety's sells dozens of unusual candies, including Candy
Flipstick taffy lipstick, Delfa Rolls, Squirrel Nut Zippers, Wax
Fangs and Wax Lips.

  (dal) 
(Elizabeth Stone is a professor in the English department and
communication and media studies department at Fordham University.) 
 By ELIZABETH STONE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's 3 in the morning, and not a creature is stirring, except
for the mouse. My mouse. I can't sleep, which is why I'm in my
nightie, on line at the computer, my study dark except for the
light cast by my monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly, there is the telltale tinkle of Instant Message,
America Online's system for real-time communication among its
members, followed by a note from a student _ let's call her Rachel,
or Elmo1972 _ across my screen. ``HI PROFESSOR!! IT'S ME,
RACHEL!!!'' That presumes that I don't already know who Elmo1972
is. Which I do.
</P>
<P>
   Here we are again, I think, just the two of us, alone in the
dark in the middle of the night. Undaunted by my failure to respond
as instantly as the Instant Message genre suggests I should, Rachel
types me another message.
</P>
<P>
   ``What are u doing up so late???!''
</P>
<P>
   When I became a college professor, I imagined having
conversations after class with students over coffee in the
cafeteria. I did not imagine that I would be a presence on their
Buddy Lists, someone to be dragooned into insomniac pajama parties
in cyberspace. Nor did I imagine that they might learn more about
me than I care to have them know _ like my nocturnal online habits.
And I didn't envision that, like Rachel, they would be able to leap
out of the cyberbushes at me, any time day or night.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm marking your paper,'' I finally type back, ``That's what
I'm doing.'' I remind myself I have to block Rachel's screen name
so she won't know when I'm on line, a way of drawing a curtain
between my personal life and hers. I've said this to myself before
and didn't do it, but this time I will, less because I don't want
to be on call 24 hours a day (though I don't) than because I don't
like being imagined in my nightgown.
</P>
<P>
   ``Marking my paper? Oh phat!!'' she types back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, see you in class,'' I reply, hoping she'll take the
hint.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   ``How do u like it so far?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Can't go into it now or I'll never get them all done.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, I manage to end the conversation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleep tight,'' she types by way of adieu.
</P>
<P>
   The day I first gave students my e-mail address, I knew it would
add a new dimension to our professional relationship. And in the
beginning, I thought it would be a simple one.
</P>
<P>
   They could send me papers via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   I could use e-mail to send them back.
</P>
<P>
   They could send me questions via e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   I could use e-mail to send back answers.
</P>
<P>
   Since I teach journalism, I could send them to Web sites to read
The Denver Post the day after the Littleton killings or tell them
to check out the new study on coffee posted at the National
Institutes of Health or give them an assignment to find out as much
information as they could about a classmate, armed with only that
person's phone number.
</P>
<P>
   I tried to mold this new aspect of our relationship around the
traditional pedagogical core. I changed my screen name from ElizaS
to the more restrained ElizStone. I was their teacher, after all.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the initial rough spots were familiar ones, only in a
new key. I found, to my chagrin, that I could misplace just as many
e-mail papers as I did the hard-copy kind. For their part, excuses
for missing work remained essentially unchanged. ``I know I left it
in your mailbox'' altered not at all, while ``my dog ate it,''
merely changed to ``my computer ate it.''
</P>
<P>
   What I didn't anticipate were the options available to those
students of mine who, like Rachel, were AOL subscribers _ and that
was nearly half of them, as it turned out. For users like us, the
first part of an e-mail address is the screen name. Once my
students knew my screen name, they could slap it onto their Buddy
Lists. Then whenever I went on line, my name would appear in a
small window on their monitors.
</P>
<P>
   I began to think of the Buddy List window as a sort of online
``Rear Window,'' from which they could secretly watch my comings
and goings. I knew more about them, too, than I once had, often
from their screen names alone.
</P>
<P>
   Sports zealots _ like a Mets fan, Piazza1979 _ were obvious.
When Flipper70 hobbled in on crutches one day saying her tendon had
snapped, I figured out, correctly, that she was a gymnast.
</P>
<P>
   Sometimes, though, what was right before my eyes proved
mysterious. Gigglez122 is one of the most somber students I've ever
had. Does she have a merry side? Does she yearn to? Sabachik is
Irish. I don't know what to make of BluLady, Punkissa and
Snowinlove. Last year, there was EatsDirt. I didn't dare inquire.
</P>
<P>
   Recently, a screen name I didn't recognize emblazoned itself
across my screen in an Instant Message note. ``WAIT!'' BBoop181
said, ``DON'T SHUT ME OUT! IT'S ME, RACHEL!''
</P>
<P>
   ``What happened to Elmo?'' I typed back.
</P>
<P>
   ``U blocked Elmo,'' she said, her font dripping with accusation.
``I know because Ken and I were both on line one day while we were
talking on the phone. Ken could see u come on line from his Buddy
List, but I couldn't see u on mine. That's when I knew.''
</P>
<P>
   I had been caught. After years of teaching, I knew how to handle
lots of ticklish problems _ kids who were unhappy with their grades
or depressed or falling asleep in class or on the verge of dropping
out _ but this ticklish Elmo issue was a new one.
</P>
<P>
   But Rachel seemed oddly unfazed. ``So anyway, now that I reached
u, could u do me a favor? That paper I e-mailed u yesterday? My
printer is broken. Do u think u could print me out a hard copy?''

IN RUSSIA, BIG BROTHER ISN'T WATCHING, HE'S READING -- ONLINE
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By CHARLES W. HOLMES  
c.1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ In the former Soviet Union, Big Brother may not be
watching you any longer, but he'd like a peak at your e-mail.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's security service, the FSB, the main successor to the
Soviet-era KGB, is tapping into most of the country's Internet
service providers under a federal directive that allows it sweeping
powers to monitor e-mail and Internet traffic.
</P>
<P>
   But one crusading Internet company in the southern city of
Volgograd has balked, and has launched a legal challenge in what
could be the first privacy-rights fight of its kind in
post-Communist Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``People should be able to use the Internet without fear that
someone is watching them,'' said Nail Murzakhanov, 33, general
director of Bayard-Slavia Communications in Volgograd, a city of 1
million on the banks of the Volga River.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are relying on their grandfather's methods,'' he said,
referring to the Soviet spy agency. ``That's not the way Russia is
supposed to work today.''
</P>
<P>
   In April, FSB agents came to the firm's offices to demand a list
of his clients and the ability to read their e-mail. The agency
also wanted the Internet provider to buy the thousands of dollars
of equipment its agents would need to carry out its electronic
snooping, and train them how to use it.
</P>
<P>
   They threatened to shut him down if he did not comply,
Murzakhanov said, and soon afterward the company abruptly lost its
lease on the Moscow-based satellite service it used.
</P>
<P>
   The company's 850 clients in the Volgograd region can e-mail
each other on the local network, but are cut off electronically
from the outside world. Murzakhanov said he and other employees of
the company received personal threats if they did not drop their
objections to the new rules.
</P>
<P>
   Civil libertarians in Russia say the regulations, known as
SORM-2, violate the spirit of Russia's constitution by giving the
government vast and unchecked powers of surveillance, similar to
the Soviet era.
</P>
<P>
   In theory under the regulations, the FSB would need a warrant to
monitor e-mail exchanges. But the rules also require that a ``black
box'' be attached to every Internet system, allowing agents to sit
at computer screens in the FSB offices and tap via a high-speed
fiber-optic line into the e-mail exchanges anytime they wish.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one is saying that the FSB should not have access in the
course of a criminal investigation. There is a law that says
Internet providers must render assistance. But access to the
(Internet) system should be carried out by a court order and under
the rule of law. Not this way,'' said Ina Zemskova of St.
Petersburg-based Citizens' Watch, a human-rights group.
</P>
<P>
   An FSB spokesman declined to discuss the new regulations or the
Volgograd case with Cox Newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   In the routine business of hunting spies and criminals, the
United States and most advanced countries maintain
intelligence-gathering networks capable of intercepting telephone
calls and data transmissions.
</P>
<P>
   A recent flap erupted in the European Union over the reach of
the U.S. National Security Agency, the super-secret spy
organization that specializes in eavesdropping. With the help of
the British government, the NSA reportedly has established a system
to monitor every e-mail, fax and telephone call made in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The task for countries large and small has become more difficult
and expensive in the Internet age, requiring security services to
gain greater technical expertise and expensive equipment.
</P>
<P>
   In cash-strapped Russia, the FSB wants it done for them. The
SORM-2 regulations _ SORM is the acronym, when translated from
Russian, means System for Operational-Investigative Activities _
require telecommunications companies to shell out thousands of
dollars to equip the FSB, or risk losing their licenses to do
business.
</P>
<P>
   More than 100 companies provide Internet services to an
estimated 1 million computer users in Russia, mainly in the larger
cities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many companies had their arms twisted and were compelled to
get the equipment,'' said Andrei Shipilov, editor-in-chief of
Komputerra, an on-line and published Russian-language computer
magazine based in Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   But in Russia, where corruption is rampant, Shipilov suggests
that many companies may simply be able to bribe their way around
the rule to avoid giving the FSB access to their systems.
</P>
<P>
   More than just individual rights of privacy are at stake, say
computer and legal experts. In Russia, the FSB's system also could
be used for corporate espionage. After the Soviet Union fell in
1991, many of the KGB's top agents left to enter the lucrative
field of corporate security and many still have ties to the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   ``If providers grant the FSB this kind of access, the
information could be sold to the highest bidder,'' said Viktoria
Yevgorova, a journalist who writes for Russia's Libertarian
movement.
</P>
<P>
   No one is certain just how far and wide the new rule has been
applied.
</P>
<P>
   The SORM-2 rules were written in 1998 by the FSB and the State
Communications Agency and enacted this year. The new rules updated
a 1995 version that applied only to telephone, fax and pager
communications.
</P>
<P>
   The rules have been slow to be applied because of the highly
technical nature of the Internet and the inconsistent way
regulations are enacted in Russia, varying from region to region.
Because they are administrative regulations and not law, they
required no presidential or legislative approval.
</P>
<P>
   Alexei Milechko, an official with GlasNet, one of Russia's
largest Internet providers, said his company has not yet been
approached by the FSB.
</P>
<P>
   Another company, MTK-Mobile, said it and other firms have slowed
the process by seeking negotiations with the FSB. ``In practice, we
know we have to do something but we need to know the legal basis
and the technical specifications,'' said Alexei Volchkov, the
company's technical director.
</P>
<P>
   In its first legal step, Bayard-Slavia Communications asked the
local prosecutor to take up the case as a constitutional matter and
file an appeal to the Supreme Court to overturn the law on the
public's behalf. The prosecutor refused in an Aug. 18 reply,
stating that the FSB had the legal authority to pursue its
monitoring system.
</P>
<P>
   Next, the company plans to appeal to the nation's chief
prosecutor. If that fails, it will file a lawsuit directly with the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want to fix this problem in silence. We want to
overcome this problem publicly so all will know that there is
nothing to fear,'' said Murzakhanov, head of the Volgograd Internet
provider.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, given the sophisticated nature of Internet
technology, the FSB is probably reading the e-mail only of those
with nothing to hide.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, the FSB is only going to have access to ordinary
users. Anyone engaged in espionage or criminal activity will easily
get around it using encryption software that the FSB doesn't have
the means to decipher,'' said Shipilov, the computer magazine
editor.

BEWARE MEN WITH BLACK BAGS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By HIAWATHA BRAY   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Soon, every well-dressed hoodlum may be carrying a laptop
computer. It may be the only way to keep their criminal enterprises
safe from the scrutiny of Uncle Sam.
</P>
<P>
   By now you've heard that the Clinton admininstration wants
Congress to grant federal law enforcement agents the power to break
into the homes and businesses of criminal suspects and plant
digital bugs in their computers. These devices would bypass
encryption programs that can be used to scramble data. As a result
of such ``black-bag jobs,'' the Feds would be able to acquire all
manner of useful evidence that is presently beyond their reach.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-industry officials, members of Congress, and Internet
activists have denounced the idea. With good reason, they fret
about privacy, free speech, unreasonable searches and seizures, and
so on.
</P>
<P>
   My doubts were of a more technical nature. Can you really bug
somebody's computer without the user noticing? I mean, a room can't
tell you it's been bugged, but a computer will tell you quite a lot
about what it's doing, if you run the right kind of diagnostic
software.
</P>
<P>
   Say the government wants to read my encrypted e-mails. John
McCown, technical director for network security at ICSA Inc. in
Reston, Va., says agents could subtly alter my encryption software
to make messages much easier to crack. Suddenly, secret messages
become easy prey.
</P>
<P>
   OK, but to do that, the spies would have to change at least one
file on my computer. Couldn't I just run a search to see if any
files have been modified? You can do that with the Find feature in
Windows 95, and there are more sophisticated programs that will
check every sector of the disk for alterations. Run such a check
every day and I'm safe, right?
</P>
<P>
   Wrong, says Bruce Schneier, inventor of the Blowfish encryption
algorithm and president of Counterpane Systems, a computer security
firm in Minneapolis. If the FBI got hold of your computer, they
could rig it so that none of these tests would work any more.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, snoops could alter the operating system so that it
no longer displays evidence of a tampered file. And if you try to
load a specialized disk-checking program, the tampered computer
could be set up to load its own phony version of the software
instead _ a version that would tell you all is well. Because the
computer's been compromised, you can't rely on any test results.
``The thing being modified can't check itself,'' Schneier said.
</P>
<P>
   The cops might not even need to enter your home. Richard Smith,
security expert and president of Phar Lap Software in Cambridge,
says some Internet software contains security holes that'll let
skilled programmers install software on distant computers, without
the user knowing. ``The feds can try that first,'' says Smith,
``and then in a couple of days, if that doesn't work, try a
break-in.''
</P>
<P>
   And as long as the federal agents are in your house, why should
they stop at altering your software? They've got the entire
computer to play with. ``You could insert devices that would attach
to the motherboard, that the software wouldn't even see,'' says
Phil Zimmermann, inventor of the legendary Pretty Good Privacy
encryption program.
</P>
<P>
   A spy could insert a gadget that would keep a record of every
button you push on the keyboard. The data could be transmitted over
a wiretap, or squirted over the Internet the next time you log on.
Or the device could simply record your typing for later retrieval
by the black-bag squad. ``It would work all too well,'' says
Zimmermann.
</P>
<P>
   There is an upside to all this. The Clinton administration has
previously sought to stop everybody from using high-quality
encryption software. At least the new plan targets suspected
criminals, and in theory leaves the rest of us alone. Federal
judges would have to sign off on the break-ins, just as they do
with phone wiretaps. The feds seem to have been fairly responsible
in their use of phone-tapping, so there's reason to hope that
they'd show the same restraint with our computers.
</P>
<P>
   But just in case, you might want to start using a ThinkPad or
PowerBook as the nerve center of your criminal empire. Carry it
with you when you leave the house, to frustrate visitors wearing
gloves and black sneakers. And remember what they used to say at
Apple Computer Inc.: Never trust a computer you can't lift.

WEB-BASED CALENDARS OFFER FREEDOM, WITH RISKS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SIMSON L. GARFINKLE   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I was planning my vacation to Silicon Valley _ where every
billboard along the highway advertises another dot-com company _
and I thought it might be fun to have dinner with my old friend
David. So I called him up and we set a time and place.
</P>
<P>
   A few hours later I discovered I had e-mail from David _ or
rather, from David's Calendar. It was a bright blue-and-white
invitation, telling me that my appointment with David had been
confirmed. Near the top was a little button with the words ``add to
my calendar.'' And at the bottom was an advertisement for Yahoo
Calendar: ``Do You Yahoo?''
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Calendar is a free Web-based scheduling system. It's
designed to replace both those old-style paper-and-ink appointment
books and calendar programs such as Microsoft's Outlook Express
that run on PCs. To view your calendar, you just point your browser
at http://calendar.yahoo.com/ and type in your Yahoo username and
password. (If you don't have an account, Yahoo will create one for
you.)
</P>
<P>
   Once you are there, you can type in your appointments and
meetings. Once you have set it up, you can view your daily, weekly,
or monthly calendar just like a day timer. Yahoo can automatically
send you e-mail before your appointments. And, as I discovered, it
can notify your friends of an impending rendezvous.
</P>
<P>
   Besides its calendar, Yahoo also has a Web-based address book.
In fact, the two work together: It's easy to schedule an
appointment with somebody in your address book. And both of these
services operate with Yahoo Mail, the company's Web-based e-mail
system.
</P>
<P>
   Yahoo Calendar is just one of several Web-based personal
information services springing up on the Internet. Another one is
AnyDay.com. Within a few months you're likely to find calendar and
address book services at your favorite Internet portal, including
Excite, AltaVista, and others. Best of all, they are all free, paid
for by advertising.
</P>
<P>
   The big advantage of these Web-based services is that they are
everywhere the Web is. No matter where you are, if you can access
the Net, you can see your calendar. If you don't live the tethered
life, you can print out your calendar and carry it with you. And
most of them can synchronize with palm-top organizers such as the
3Com Palm Pilot and machines based on Microsoft's Windows CE.
</P>
<P>
   But the fact that these services store all of your personal
information somewhere else can be a potential problem as well. You
don't control your data: The calendar provider does. And these
companies can do whatever they want with your information.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, few on-line calendar companies are doing much to mine
the personal information stored on their computers. When you
register for Yahoo Calendar, the company asks for your real name,
your age, sex, marital status, occupation, and interests. Yahoo
runs fancy statistics on this information and gives the summary
results to advertisers _ the people who are picking up the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Right now advertisers might be satisfied knowing some percentage
of Yahoo's users are unmarried geeks in their 30s. But who knows
what will happen in the future. Someday you might schedule dinner
at Bob's Pizza and, a few minutes later, get a coupon suggesting
you change your plans and eat at Joe's.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Yahoo and the other calendar companies all have
privacy policies that promise to keep your personal information
private _ well, more or less. If you actually read these policies
you'll find they are filled with wishy-washy words and, in any
case, are subject to change at any time. No law protects your
personal information stored on these services. And, to date,
on-line companies have a pretty poor record when it comes to
protecting private information _ especially in the face of a
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, for example, Yahoo was sued by Raytheon,
which wanted the names of people who had been participating in a
Yahoo chat group. Yahoo caved in and coughed up the names, after
which the suit was dropped. There is a lesson here: When you store
your information on another company's computers, you are trusting
that company's legal department to defend your privacy. The problem
for Web users is that Yahoo's legal department works for Yahoo, not
for you.
</P>
<P>
   Put your data into Yahoo Calendar and you are also trusting the
company will weed out any rogue employees who might violate the
company's privacy policy and sell your information. And the threat
of rogue employees is very real. Over the past decade the Internal
Revenue Service, the Social Security Administration, and even MCI
have had problems with employees selling personal information. It
is unreasonable to assume that companies such as Yahoo and AnyDay
will be free from similar incidents.
</P>
<P>
   Another problem is encryption, or rather, the lack thereof. None
of these on-line services uses encryption to scramble the data sent
over the Internet. This means your password can easily be sniffed
by a hacker, who might then go into your calendar and change your
information.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, I suspect more and more people will minimize the
potential for abuse and start keeping their calendar on the Web. I
would like to use these services myself. Sadly, I'm just not that
trusting.

RESEARCHERS DEMONSTRATE COMPUTER CODE CAN BE BROKEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ An international team of researchers
demonstrated this week that it was possible to break the security
codes commonly used to protect financial transactions over the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The actual feat involved finding the two prime factors for a
number about 155 digits long. The answer enables one to obtain the
key used to decode a particular piece of encrypted data.
</P>
<P>
   While the seven-month effort required a significant amount of
computing power _ involving 292 computers at 11 sites in six
countries _ it showed that the standard level of encryption for
Internet transactions, known as 512-bit encryption, was not secure.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have said for a long time that 512 is not a secure
standard,'' said Burt Kaliski, chief scientist for RSA Research in
San Mateo, Calif., a part of Security Dynamics Technologies' RSA
Data Security Inc., which makes encryption technology and sponsored
a challenge to break the 512-bit code. ``I don't think this means
that overnight, Web sites will be attacked, but we need to make the
transfer to a larger key size.''
</P>
<P>
   The feat also raises questions about the government's policy of
export controls on encryption. The 512-bit system has become the
standard because, with some exceptions, it is the most secure
encryption allowed for export.
</P>
<P>
   Although higher levels of encryption exist, experts estimate
that 95 percent of Internet commerce uses the 512-bit standard.
</P>
<P>
   Last September, the administration announced that the export
policy would be reviewed and an update announced within one year.
</P>
<P>
   William Reinsch, the under secretary of commerce for export
administration, said Thursday that the administration would make an
announcement by mid-September. He could not say, however, what
impact the recent demonstration would have on the encryption policy
of the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our policy is intended to track market developments, but it's
too soon to come to a conclusion on this,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Being able to factor a 512-bit number enables one version of
what is known as the RSA public key encryption system to be broken.
RSA, designed in the mid-1970s by Ronald Rivest, Adi Shamir and
Leonard Adleman, is used extensively in software to protect
electronic data traffic.
</P>
<P>
   RSA and similar encryption systems are based on the fact that it
is immensely difficult and time-consuming for even the most
powerful computers to factor large numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Although the factoring task took the researchers seven months,
they were using a relatively small amount of computing power,
mostly overnight and on weekends.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there is a huge potential to speed this up a lot
more,'' said Arjen Lenstra, a computer scientist at Citigroup, and
one of the researchers involved in the project. He said that
harnessing the computational power available to government agencies
or major corporations could enable such codes to be broken in less
than one week.
</P>
<P>
   ``Microsoft could do this over a Thanksgiving weekend,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In May, Shamir, a computer scientist at Weizmann Institute of
Science in Rehovoth, Israel, presented a paper describing a device,
not yet built, that could break a 512-bit code. But until this
week, the feat was only theoretical. Lenstra and Shamir are working
on a way to use the device to further speed the factoring process.

INTERNET BOARD ADOPTS RULES FOR RESOLVING CLAIMS TO DOMAIN NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JERI CLAUSING   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTIAGO, Chile _ The Internet's new oversight board Thursday
adopted a proposal for resolving competing claims to the names used
for Internet addresses. But it heeded calls to delay putting the
rules into effect until it can address concerns that they favor big
companies and trademark holders over individuals and small
businesses.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal for resolving disputes over domain names _ the
words or phrases used for Internet addresses, like Amazon.com or
Netscape.net _ was the major issue before the group, the Internet
Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, at an open meeting
here.
</P>
<P>
   At issue are the disputes that arise when different parties want
the same name, as well as ``cybersquatting'' _ the practice of
buying domain names made up of popular words and trademarks in
hopes of reselling them at a hefty profit.
</P>
<P>
   The new policy, which will be written into all domain name
registration contracts, will require that all disputes involving
trademarks be sent to mandatory arbitration, with the loser paying
the fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The major benefit of this policy is that the people who
register domain names, whether they are individuals or businesses,
will have a much clearer picture of what their rights are,'' said
Esther Dyson, interim chairwoman of the group, which is known as
ICANN. ``This makes it much easier to resolve disputes.''
</P>
<P>
   Some participants were concerned that the definition of
cybersquatting as an ``abusive'' use of a trademark was too broad,
and would enable trademark holders to take back names from people
who had legitimate claims to them.
</P>
<P>
   That practice has increased as more companies trying to build
businesses on the Internet find that names they want have been
taken _ often by businesses with the same name or by people who use
the name for a personal Web site.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, ICANN said the policy should not be put in place
until a committee can more clearly define what constitutes bad
faith and abuse in registering Internet addresses.
</P>
<P>
   The board gave its staff 45 days to appoint a group to devise a
narrower definition of cybersquatting and to strengthen language
safeguarding the rights of all sides in disputes over legitimate
claims to a domain name.
</P>
<P>
   Officials on both sides said they were pleased with the
compromise, reached after two days of preliminary meetings by
advisory groups.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a definite step in the right direction,'' said Mike
Heltzer of the International Trademark Association. ``I'm glad to
see the ICANN board has recognized that cybersquatting is in fact a
problem for trademark holders and consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Kleiman, who is part of a group of noncommercial interests
that pushed for changes to the policy, said, ``If that spirit of
compromise carries through, I think we will wind up with a process
that more fairly balances the rights of domain name holders and
trademark holders.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   One of the first charges of ICANN, which was picked last year by
the U.S. Department of Commerce to take over the administrative
functions of the Internet, was to introduce competition into the
business of registering names in the popular domains of .com, .net
and .org. Since 1993, Network Solutions, a Herndon, Va., company,
has held an exclusive government contract to provide that service.
</P>
<P>
   In opening that business to competition, the board has been
working to insure that common rules apply to all the companies it
accredits to register domain names, and one rule involves domain
name disputes.
</P>
<P>
   Network Solutions has traditionally favored trademark holders
when presented with such claims, resulting in highly publicized
cases like that of a boy nicknamed Pokey who almost lost the domain
name of his personal Web site to the toy company holding the
trademark for the Gumby and Pokey dolls.
</P>
<P>
   Just this week, a federal court recognized for the first time
the rights of individuals in such cases. The 9th U.S. Circuit Court
of Appeals ruled against the Avery Dennison label company,
returning the domain of avery.net to a man who owns the domain and
leases it to several individuals with the last name of Avery.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the first time that the board, under pressure from
the Clinton administration and the U.S. Congress, had opened its
decision-making meeting to the public.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The decision on the dispute-resolution policy came at the fourth
public gathering of ICANN's interim board. It was the first
substantive decision by the international board, whose main charge
is to create the structure for a membership that is expected to
begin electing permanent board members at its next meeting, in
November in Los Angeles.

<P>
   Now here's an even-handed approach to the debate between
creationism and science. Newprayer.com is offering to use a
``directional radio transmitter'' to beam prayers to the part of
the universe ``where we know God resided.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the Newprayer.com Web site, God's last-known
approximate whereabouts have been determined as follows:
</P>
<P>
   ``What do we know about the location of God? We know that God
was at the birth of His universe. We know how the universe began _
with a `Big Bang.' We know where the oldest part of the universe is
located. We can transmit radio messages to this precise location.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is the going rate for this convergence of e-commerce
and evangelism? Five dollars will send one prayer on its way, with
bulk rates of $25 for six prepaid prayers and $75 for 20. Major
credit cards accepted.
</P>
<P>
   As precisely as Newprayer.com may have pinpointed God's last
known whereabouts, though, finding the company is a bigger
challenge. The site does not say where Newprayer.com is based,
provide any contact information or otherwise indicate who is behind
this venture.
</P>
<P>
   So doing business with Newprayer.com may require a leap of
faith.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really helpful for consumers to be able to check
something out, but sometimes it's impossible on the Web,'' said
Susan Grant, director of Internet Fraud Watch for the National
Consumers League.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Grant said her organization was deluged with complaints
about fraud on the Net, having received 7,700 last year and 6,000
through the first six months of 1999.
</P>
<P>
   As for Newprayer specifically, she declined to say whether her
organization had received any complaints about it. But she added,
``Consumers might be right to be skeptical about these claims.''

   XEROX AND ADOBE TO UNVEIL ANTI-PIRACY TECHNOLOGY
</P>
<P>
   As companies seek a way to prevent the rampant piracy that has
plagued the digital music industry from overtaking digital
publishing, the Xerox Corp. plans to introduce software that
protects books and documents distributed online from being
illegally copied. The technology, called Content Guard is to be
announced Monday at the Seybold 21st Century Publishing Conference
in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Xerox plans to announce a pact with Adobe Systems to integrate
the new technology with Adobe's existing PDF format for
distributing documents on line. Xerox also intends to announce
publishers that have agreed to adopt the technology, including
Thomson Learning, a publisher of educational materials; the
National Music Publishers Association, which distributes sheet
music online, and Haymarket Publications, a European business
publisher.
</P>
<P>
   Compared with offerings from other companies, including
Intertrust, that have produced their own types of digital rights
management software, the Xerox tools are based on an industry
standard: Java, an Internet programming language developed by Sun
Microsystems.
</P>
<P>
   The flexibility of Java would allow users to read Xerox
protected documents on various types of software operating systems
using any of the standard Web browser programs. Publishers,
corporations or individuals could specify who had access to the
document, set a time frame for protection and even designate the
type of authentication (like a password or a fingerprint) needed to
read the document. If a secure document was e-mailed to a person
not authorized to view it, that person would have to go to the
publisher's Web site to obtain permission before the document could
be viewed.
</P>
<P>
   Netty Douglass, director of rights management for Thomson
Learning, based in Stamford, Conn., said the Xerox technology would
be appealing not only for its security features but because it
would allow Thomson to track the use of its documents. That
information would be useful both for marketing purposes, she said,
and for tallying usage fees for images owned by other companies
included in their documents.

   MONKEYING AROUND WITH COMPANY NAMES
</P>
<P>
   The letters that form the name Boeing can be rearranged to spell
``big one.'' Time Warner can be converted to ``mean writer.'' And
the title of Rupert Murdoch's sexy London tabloid The News of the
World is an anagram for ``tender, hot flesh _ wow.''
</P>
<P>
   These are just a few of the possibilities in business anagrams,
a game being played by office workers throughout the
English-speaking world.
</P>
<P>
   To play, contact the Internet Anagram Server at
www.wordsmith.org/anagram, which provides immediate answers, or
another site called Anagram Genius Server at
www.anagramgenius.com/server.html, which gives a more considered
response and replies by e-mail after a few minutes or hours,
depending on traffic volume.
</P>
<P>
   At no charge, these sites will attempt to create anagrams from
any word or phrase, not just company names. But somehow there's a
special mischievous thrill to plugging in your employer's name and
learning, for example, that New York Times can be reconfigured as
``monkeys write.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anagrams never lie,'' insists Anu Garg (his real name, not an
anagram). He and his wife, Stuti, have just founded a Web service,
called Namix, (www.namix.com), that uses anagrams and other
techniques to help companies come up with names and trademarks.
Namix which also links to the Internet Anagram Server, offers an
archive of its ``Business Anagram of the Day.''
</P>
<P>
   In his day job, Garg is a computer specialist in Columbus, Ohio,
with AT&AMP;T Laboratories _ whose letters also happen to spell ``a
sailboat retort.''

MICROSOFT BRINGS IN TOP TALENT TO PURSUE THE TABLET COMPUTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hoping to fulfill a dream that has eluded the industry for
nearly three decades, a team of designers from the Microsoft Corp.
is trying to create a so-called tablet computer. The portable,
wireless, keyboardless device would be about the size and weight of
a writing tablet and be intended to serve most of a person's
everyday computing and Net-surfing needs.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft, which has no set timetable or manufacturing plans for
the tablet computer, knows that success is far from certain. ``This
is a long-haul effort and the road in the past has been fraught
with conspicuous failures,'' said Dick Brass, the company's vice
president for emerging technologies.
</P>
<P>
   But betting that past computer-tablet stumbles, like AT&AMP;T's Eo
and Apple Computer's Newton, were simply ideas too far ahead of
their technological times, Microsoft has bolstered its team with
two legendary computer innovators, Butler Lampson and Chuck
Thacker.
</P>
<P>
   The pair were part of a group that helped pioneer some of the
most important ideas in the personal computer industry back in the
1970s as researchers at the Xerox Corporation's Palo Alto Research
Center in California. It was at PARC that such innovations as the
computer mouse, the Ethernet PC networking system and the
what-you-see-is-what-you-get screen display for word processing
were developed _ although it would be other companies, like Apple,
the 3Com Corp &UR; .  &LR;  and Microsoft that would turn those ideas into
commercially viable products.
</P>
<P>
   One PARC concept from that era that has yet to bear commercial
fruit, however, is the tablet computer, though no one is blaming
Lampson and Thacker.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they're going to take another whack at this, there aren't
two better guys to do it,'' said John Shoch, a former member of the
Xerox PARC team who is now a venture capitalist. ``Butler and Chuck
are superb designers in the broadest sense of the word.''
</P>
<P>
   Thacker, for his part, says that idea of a tablet computer may
now be ripe enough to bear fruit. ``This has been something that
people have been taking runs at for almost 30 years now,'' he said.
``But the confluence of technologies is happening that may finally
make it possible.''
</P>
<P>
   Thacker, 56, and Lampson, 55, were part of a group, led by the
computer scientist Alan Kay, that set out in 1971 to build a
portable computing machine they called a Dynabook that would enable
a user to stay wirelessly connected to a world of information. As
graduate student at the University of Utah, Kay had written his
doctoral thesis about such a machine, which he then called the
Sketchpad.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember people telling Alan he was crazy,'' said Adele
Goldberg, who helped manage the Xerox PARC effort and is now a
Silicon Valley software developer and consultant. ( Kay is now a
researcher at the Walt DisneyCo. imagineering laboratory.) ``We
look back and think, well, we were just a little too early,'' Ms.
Goldberg said.
</P>
<P>
   The PARC group developed a programming system called Smalltalk
and a series of prototype computers that they referred to as
``interim Dynabooks.'' But these efforts, like commercial flops
that followed, were hampered by limitations of the software and
hardware arts at the time.
</P>
<P>
   In the past few years, however, the success of the 3Com's
hand-held Palm Pilot ``digital assistants'' _ which use simple
handwriting recognition, perform simple computing and have
rudimentary communications capabilities _ have helped revived
industry hopes for a more powerful, full-fledged tablet computer.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to see if we can produce a tablet PC and the
software for it that will be sufficiently powerful and intuitive
and inexpensive to capture the imagination and the marketplace,''
said Brass, who formed the Microsoft tablet team in March and last
month recruited Lampson and Thacker from other parts of the
company.
</P>
<P>
   A portable tablet computer might finally be able to replace the
keyboards of today's portable machines with either handwriting or
speech input, Brass said.
</P>
<P>
   He acknowledged past commercial failures, including Apple's
Newton, the Go Corp. (whose technology was used in the abortive
AT&AMP;T Eo) and even a Microsoft project of a decade ago called Pen
Windows. But Brass said the time might now be right to build a kind
of computer that many computer executives, including Microsoft
Chairman Bill Gates, have said will eventually replace the current
desktop standard.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of things have changed,'' Brass said. ``Display
technology has gotten cheaper and the processors are now probably
fast enough.''
</P>
<P>
   Brass _ who was an early software developer in the personal
computer industry and then a vice president at the data-base
software giant, the OracleCorp. _ joined Microsoft two years ago to
lead an electronic book effort. Part of that work has included the
company's recently introduced Cleartype, a software approach to
improving the readability of fonts on flat panel computer displays
_ whether electronic books or portable computers.
</P>
<P>
   With Microsoft set to announce its electronic book plans this
week at the Seybold Publishing Conference technology conference in
San Francisco, Brass said that he had been shifting his focus
recently to the company's effort to design a new class of computer
embodying many of the features envisioned in the original Xerox
Dynabook.
</P>
<P>
   It was only late last month that he asked Lampson and Thacker to
join the tablet team.
</P>
<P>
   Thacker, who left a position at the Digital Equipment Corp.
laboratory in Palo Alto to join Microsoft two years ago, has been
working at a new Microsoft research laboratory he helped set up in
Britain. Lampson, who also previously worked at Digital Equipment,
came to Microsoft four years ago to work with Nathan Myhrvold, who
recently took a leave of absence as the company's head of research.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has no plans to begin manufacturing computers, Brass
said. But if the tablet effort succeeds, he said, the company will
probably form partnerships with hardware companies to build and
sell the systems.
</P>
<P>
   The new tablet project is small by Microsoft standards, said
another Microsoft developer who spoke on condition that he not be
identified. He said it was not yet clear whether the research
project would garner the resources that Microsoft throws at major
projects, which frequently involve hundreds of developers.
</P>
<P>
   But Thacker, who was one of the two principal hardware designers
of the Xerox Alto, a prototype computer that was the first
``interim Dynabook,'' does not seem concerned about whether
Microsoft is committed to this effort.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always wanted this kind of device,'' he said, ``and in
systems research one of the most motivating things is that you want
the device yourself.''
</P>
<P>
   And now, many people in the computer industry and at Microsoft
believe that there is a convergence of a number of technologies,
including display, processing, battery and storage that will
finally pave the way for commercial tablet computers.
</P>
<P>
   Tablet computing will be pervasive, Lampson said. ``I think this
will be the way most people interact with the Net and with the rest
of the computing universe as well.''

WELL-DESIGNED WEB SITE CAN HAVE A BIG IMPACT ON THE BOTTOM LINE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By BOB TEDESCHI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   As IBM positioned itself as an Internet leader last year, with a
marketing campaign that helped e-commerce gain mainstream currency,
a somewhat troubling reality emerged.
</P>
<P>
   The company wasn't minding its own e-business.
</P>
<P>
   On IBM's Web site, the most popular feature was the search
function, ``because people couldn't figure out how to navigate the
site,'' said Carol Moore, IBM's vice president for Internet
operations. The second most popular feature was the ``help''
button, because the search technology was so ineffective.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's solution was a 10-week effort to redesign the site, which
involved more than 100 employees at a cost Ms. Moore estimated ``in
the millions.'' As the redesign neared completion in February, IBM
consciously held off on promoting the Web site, so it could gauge
the effectiveness of the new design. The result: In the first week
after the redesign, use of the ``help'' button decreased 84
percent, while sales increased 400 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Internet users have for years complained about how difficult it
is to use most Web sites, frustrated by things like shoddy search
engines, Byzantine navigation schemes and long waits for pages to
download. But with e-commerce sites proliferating on the Web, those
shortcomings are increasingly recognized as grave threats to the
bottom line. And as more sites seek profitability by expanding
their product offerings _ and customers struggle to click their way
through complex product listings _ Web site design is looming as an
ever-more crucial facet of the business.
</P>
<P>
   ``The customer's experience on the Web can make or break a
business,'' said Mark Hurst, president of Creative Good, a
consulting firm that helps clients address what is known as Web
site usability. ``There was $3 billion lost on the Web last year
because of poor design _ sites not realizing that if they just make
it easier for the consumer to buy, they'll make more sales.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moore said IBM's redesign focused not just on the ``Shop
IBM.'' section of the site, but on each of the more than one
million pages on that site (www.ibm.com). The project involved
several components, including information architecture _ or the
arrangement of information within a site _ navigation, graphic
design and the selection of words and photographs for each page.
</P>
<P>
   The first order of business, Ms. Moore said, was to create some
cohesion at the site, which had previously been split into three
segments: a software section, a PC section and a catalog site for
products like cables, printers and disk drives. Each section had
been designed by a separate team, she said, in conjunction with 60
so-called interactive agencies, which help companies develop their
Web sites.
</P>
<P>
   The fragmentation was apparent: Information was arranged
differently from section to section, search results were
inconsistent and pages loaded at different speeds. ``It may sound
obvious,'' Ms. Moore said, ``but things have to work the same
everywhere on the site for people to feel comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The company assembled a team made up of people from several
departments, including programming, information technology and
marketing. The team then developed a plan to change the site's
navigation and improve its search technology. It also created
templates for each page, so the interactive agencies IBM works with
_ which the company winnowed to four from 60 _ could conform to a
single design standard. The templates helped decrease the time it
takes to load a page by 30 percent, Ms. Moore said, noting that the
average time spent per visit has fallen 28 percent since the
redesign, ``so we know people are getting what they want more
quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hurst of Creative Good said e-commerce sites with enormous
inventories were particularly at risk for design flaws. ``If Amazon
adds 30 more shopping categories, and just puts 30 more tabs on
their home page, that would be a problem,'' he said. ``There could
be a way to design it so it's not too hard to find what you want,
but whatever way you go you're adding more work for the user.''
</P>
<P>
   In the future, he said, ``we may see that the customer
experience is better and faster on more focused sites, and the
superstores that get too big either die out or come back to a
better focus.
</P>
<P>
   ``If another store had the same books and service as Amazon and
you could get to the books right away, why wouldn't you go to that
store?'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   One site that has had to figure out how to manage an enormous
inventory is Travelocity, a travel site owned by the Sabre Group.
The site offers 95 percent of the available airline seats in the
world on any given day, the company said, along with listings from
40,000 hotels, 50 car rental companies and numerous cruise lines
and tour companies.
</P>
<P>
   Terrell Jones, Travelocity's president, said that when the
company began its online operations 13 years ago on Compuserve,
Prodigy and America Online, its system ``was easy, but not
simple.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We'd step you through everything, which was very supportive,
but it took a long time and lots of screens,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the company put a simplified ticket-buying system on
the site's front page, allowing users to immediately type in their
destination and the times they want to travel; the system then
returns nine different flight results. Notably, Jones said, the
company tested the feature with focus groups, ``with the marketing
and programming people behind the one-way mirror.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For it to work, the programmers need to hear people call their
baby ugly,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones said Travelocity also changed certain features based on
e-mail complaints from customers. The company values such comments,
he said, because many people don't bother to write. ``We were lucky
because on the Web site, if people don't understand it, they just
leave,'' he said. ``It's not like a corporation where people will
call to tell you what's wrong. So usability is exceptionally
important, because you don't have face-to-face contact with the
customer.''
</P>
<P>
   Jakob Nielsen, a usability consultant who publishes a column on
the topic at www.useit.com, said e-commerce sites were ``actually
getting much better than traditional sites, because there's such a
direct bottom-line impact'' from design.
</P>
<P>
   The legacy of first-generation non-e-commerce sites is, in fact,
partly to blame for the current state of e-commerce site design, he
said. ``A lot of sites started simply as informational sites, and
they've grafted e-commerce onto themselves, so they have split
personalities,'' Nielsen said.
</P>
<P>
   Companies are loath to part with Web pages they spent millions
of dollars to develop, he said, even if the pages do not add to the
site's functionality. ``It's a good excuse,'' he said, ``but the
user doesn't care about all that history.''

A GREAT Y2K MYSTERY: HOW MANY MISTAKES ARE GOING UNNOTICED?
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By BARNABY J. FEDER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A growing number of companies and government agencies are
claiming that their vital systems are ready for any and all Year
2000 dates, but life seems as hectic as ever for many Year 2000
technical workers in that advance guard.
</P>
<P>
   Managers continue testing on the assumption that at least minor
flaws lie buried in some ``ready'' systems. Previously unknown Year
2000 defects keep popping up in commercial software. And normal
activities like adding equipment or software carry the risk of
inadvertently introducing bugs into systems that had been cleaned
up and tested.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is testing and retesting,'' said Steven Kutnick, the
Year 2000 project leader at the Northern Trust Company in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   How many crucial mistakes are being caught by testing _ or
missed _ has become a great Year 2000 mystery.
</P>
<P>
   Consultants and companies selling Year 2000 software-testing
tools contend that repairs typically miss many date problems and
introduce bugs that may or may not be related to dates. Some
authorities, like Capers Jones, chief scientist at Software
Productivity Research, a consulting company in Burlington, Mass.,
warn that testing fails to catch many defects.
</P>
<P>
   The Gartner Group, a technology consultant in Stamford, Conn.,
says it is common for independent tests to find errors lurking in 5
percent of computer code that has been altered during Year 2000
work and that the error rate reaches 15 percent in poorly run
projects. Nearly two-thirds of those errors are serious enough to
create faulty data or cause programs to crash, according to
Gartner.
</P>
<P>
   There have been a number of reports highlighting the
consequences of failing to screen out defects. Northwest Metrology,
an electronic test equipment company in Bakersfield, Calif.,
recently disclosed that an office computer it had tested last year
had nevertheless crashed and destroyed data in January after
encountering Year 2000 dates. The company, already out $80,000 as a
result, is still struggling to restore the lost data eight months
later.
</P>
<P>
   Year 2000 project managers agree that such perils are real and
that they make rigorous testing worthwhile. But many say their
experience in fixing programs, testing them and putting them back
into use leads them to doubt that hidden defects are anywhere near
the levels projected by Jones and influential consultants like
Gartner.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to change less than 1 percent of our programs after
testing,'' said Mary Stewart, who heads Year 2000 work at Total
System Services Inc. of Columbus, Ga., which handles 195 million
credit- and debit-card accounts for major banks and retailers like
Sears, Roebuck and Nordstrom.
</P>
<P>
   The Chase Manhattan Corp. and its outside consultants found just
300 errors after the bank made needed alterations to three million
lines of computer code. ``They tended to be extremely easy to
fix,'' Brian Robbins, a Chase senior vice president, said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, testing strikes Year 2000 managers whose repairs are
completed as a good bet to minimize risks, if only by increasing
confidence among business partners and consumers in general. Chase,
in fact, went so far as to pay for independent testing of the
repairs at the Alltel Corp., a key telecommunications supplier.
</P>
<P>
   No testing program can cover everything software programs do, so
managers like Ms. Stewart have allotted time to other forms of Year
2000 double-checking too, including assigning some programmers to
what could be the most mind-numbing of all follow-up work, a
process called desk checking. That is techno-speak for the job of
reading through critical code line by line to search for possible
errors that did not show up during the repair work or earlier
rounds of testing.
</P>
<P>
   In between the elaborate world of testing and the drudgery of
desk checking lie a range of other tasks for Year 2000 technical
workers finished with critical repairs. Some are repairing systems
that had been on the back burner because businesses regard them as
useful but not vital.
</P>
<P>
   CSX Technology Inc., a unit of the Richmond-based CSX Corp. that
has handled Year 2000 work for the CSX railway, its sister company,
is about to repair some desktop programs it could do without,
according to Charles Wodehouse, president of CSX Technology. Such
``dogs and cats,'' as Wodehouse calls them because they are like
old pets, produce reports or do other tasks that could be done on
newer software like Microsoft Office. But it can be a battle to
persuade managers to let the old programs die, he said.
</P>
<P>
   At some big companies, retiring programs has become a
time-consuming late-stage Year 2000 activity in its own right.
Household International, a consumer credit company in Prospect
Heights, Ill., is halfway through a two-month drive to shelve more
than 10,000 programs it replaced with new software rather than
fixing, according to Thomas Wilkie, head of the company's Year 2000
program. But the shelved programs will be archived for a year
before they are discarded.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't want to eliminate anything that might be used,''
Wilkie said.
</P>
<P>
   Wilkie and others are also busy repatching systems that they had
classified as ready as major software vendors like Microsoft report
previously unknown Year 2000 defects. Microsoft recently released
supplementary code, known as a patch, that represented its sixth
attempt to make its NT operating system fully compliant with Year
2000 needs.
</P>
<P>
   If a patch released by a vendor is deemed to be crucial, a
company might have to undergo a new round of testing and training.
Microsoft has been criticized because scarcely a month goes by
without announcements of newly discovered flaws in popular programs
like Windows, the NT operating system or the Excel spreadsheet, but
it has plenty of company. Software vendors have posted nearly 480
warnings of previously unreported Year 2000 flaws since early May,
according to the Infoliant Corp., a Pittsburgh firm that tracks
such data.
</P>
<P>
   A related concern _ benignly called ``clean management'' _ is
preventing the software and systems the company has worked so hard
to fix from being infected with Year 2000 problems by new, untested
software or links to the outside.
</P>
<P>
   The dangers are substantial for companies like Public Service
Enterprise Group, parent of New Jersey's largest power company.
Public Service finished Year 2000 work on its giant customer
information system in January. This year, though, Year 2000 experts
hovered anxiously as it rewrote 60 percent of the programs in the
system to prepare for utility industry deregulation. The activities
ranged from essentials like billing to helpful refinements like the
data on past contacts that telephone agents see as they greet
customers.
</P>
<P>
   Fears of corrupting clean code _ along with the need for final
testing _ are two key reasons computer users are almost universally
talking about freezing all changes in their computers at some point
this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``No programmers here are working on Year 2000 right now but
nearly everyone is rushing to complete other projects before the
freeze,'' said Ron Kerr, senior manager of information services at
Home Depot Inc., which plans to halt changes on Oct. 11. Until
sometime next year at the earliest, it may be hard to find a
computer worker immune from the gravitational pull of Y2K.

CONSUMERS' DESIRE FOR PERSONAL INFORMATION PRIVACY IGNORED 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DENISE CARUSO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If privacy is indeed the pivotal concern for people who use data
networks _and by every objective indication to date, it is _ then
why are companies and law enforcement agencies still getting away
with monitoring and collecting, and using and selling, as much of
our personal data as they can get their hands on?
</P>
<P>
   What is it about ``no'' that these folks don't understand?
</P>
<P>
   Several new, sweeping Internet surveillance initiatives, for
example, have been introduced by the Clinton White House over the
last few weeks _ including one that would monitor private
industries for illegal transactions. Another would allow law
enforcement agents with a court order to secretly enter private
homes or offices to ``wiretap'' the hard disks and Internet
connections of computer users.
</P>
<P>
   Even the Federal Trade Commission, which a few years ago had
shown such enthusiasm for making Internet-based businesses toe the
consumer privacy line, has backed down from consumer advocacy and
is now advocating for industry. The agency officially concluded
last month, in its 1999 Report to Congress on Self-Regulation and
Privacy, that voluntary industry practices were working just fine
and that ``no legislative action is necessary at this time.''
</P>
<P>
   This summation came despite comments from one FTC commissioner,
Sheila F. Anthony, who said in a written statement to a Senate
subcommittee in July that she was dismayed by the results of
studies that show a gap as large as 89 percent between the number
of sites that gather personal information and those that post
substantive privacy policies. Self-regulation ``is not enough if
the privacy practices themselves are toothless,'' wrote Ms.
Anthony, who dissented in part from last month's report.
</P>
<P>
   More recently, a telephone industry posse, led by U S West,
persuaded a federal appeals court in Denver to reverse some recent
FCC rules that had been specifically designed to protect private
customer data.
</P>
<P>
   According to the chairman of the Federal Communications
Commission, William E. Kennard, who said the agency would appeal
the decision, those rules were the result of a request by Congress
to provide ``meaningful protection for consumers' privacy rights.''
</P>
<P>
   The FCC rules had required phone companies to get explicit
permission from their customers _ a method known as ``opt in'' _
before using or sharing customers' records, calling patterns and
other personal information to market new services to them.
</P>
<P>
   ``You call your doctor, your clergyman, your therapist,''
Kennard said. ``You order products. And when you pick up that
telephone, most consumers have no earthly idea that call might be
used by someone to market another service to them. When you pick up
that telephone, you should have ownership of that information. It's
the way we live our lives and it's private to us.''
</P>
<P>
   But in a 2-1 ruling published on Aug. 18, which has obvious
implications for the data-hungry Internet economy, the 10th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals said that rules protecting consumers from
having information like the numbers they call and the services they
subscribe to used without their permission interfered with the
phone companies' First Amendment rights to free speech.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although we may feel uncomfortable knowing that our personal
information is circulating in the world,'' the ruling said, ``we
live in an open society where information may pass freely.''
</P>
<P>
   One wonders how many circuit court judges would be willing to
have the form and substance of their phone bills ``pass freely''
among the employees of U S West or its partners.
</P>
<P>
   The court's decision does not allow U S West and others to sell
proprietary customer data to outsiders, but it does give the
telephone companies permission to scrutinize this highly personal
data _ data gathered only as a byproduct of subscribing to their
services _ without the subscribers' explicit permission. Not
incidentally, it gives the companies an enormous edge over others
selling competing services.
</P>
<P>
   Kennard said he was disappointed that the court came down on the
side of the business interests of telephone companies. ``If that's
the way privacy laws will be interpreted,'' he said, ``then I think
consumers will have a lot to worry about.''
</P>
<P>
   Oddly enough, the ruling _ which, if it stands, would seem to
hamper any future attempts to limit the ability of companies to
disclose consumers' personal information _ got very little play in
the national news media.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the victorious companies _ U S West, Vodaphone
Airtouch, Sprint, SBC Communications, MCI Worldcom, Bell South and
Frontier _ did little to call attention to the ruling.
</P>
<P>
   And who can blame them? Consumers do not like it when companies
do not protect their privacy, as Amazon.com found out this week
when it started publishing lists of its products purchased by
specific companies, nonprofit groups and government agencies. But
refusing to flaunt data mining and refusing to practice it are two
different matters. ``The technology generates a lot of information
that's very valuable, and everybody wants to get their hands on
it,'' says David L. Sobel, general counsel for the Electronic
Privacy Information Center in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Sobel does not buy the ``corporate First Amendment'' argument
that he said won the day for U S West et al. ``We do, in fact, have
existing federal laws that restrict companies from disclosing
personal information, like video rentals,'' he said. ``It's not a
violation of free speech rights to forbid people to divulge inside
information. Why should it be a violation to pass laws restricting
the use of private data?''
</P>
<P>
   And Kennard said he saw a broader issue around the collection of
detailed consumer data in every transaction from the supermarket
scanner to the credit-card number on the Internet. ``As a society,
we have to come up with a way of protecting that information for
benefit of consumers,'' he said. ``It doesn't necessarily mean that
government has to do it, but government is certainly a logical
place for it to be done if industry isn't going to step up to the
plate.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Anthony, the FTC commissioner, has also become a believer in
a government role. In her statement to the Senate subcommittee, she
wrote that ``industry progress has been far too slow'' since the
FTC encouraged voluntary fair information practices in 1996. ``I
believe that the time is ripe for federal legislation to establish
at least baseline minimum standards upon which meaningful
self-regulation can flourish.''
</P>
<P>
   And despite their protests, that may be the only ``no'' that
industry will understand.

AMAZON.COM TRIES TO STEM CONTROVERSY OVER ITS LISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DAVID F. GALLAGHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Amazon.com is trying to stem controversy over a new marketing
tactic that uses personal data about its 10.7 million customers to
compile online lists of books and music that people they live near,
or work with, are buying.
</P>
<P>
   After critics raised privacy concerns late last week, Amazon.com
said that it would adjust the program by letting customers request
that their buying habits not be included in the ``purchase
circles,'' as the listings are known.
</P>
<P>
   But the controversy underscored the growing tension between
sales goals and personal privacy in the new world of online
commerce.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're doing things that have never been done before,'' Paul
Capelli, an Amazon.com spokesman said, after the company agreed to
let consumers opt out of the purchase circle program. ``We use our
customers to help us evolve.''
</P>
<P>
   The purchase circles, which Amazon.com introduced on Aug. 20,
comprise thousands of best-seller lists that enable customers to
browse and see what books, music and videos are popular among
various groups of people _ by categories that include geography,
employer, university or professional organization.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com customers from New York City, according to a listing
last Friday, were buying up copies of Kurt Andersen's novel ``Turn
of the Century,'' for example. U.S. Navy buyers were ordering many
copies of Cher's ``Believe'' compact disk. And Amazon.com shoppers
logging in from Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co. tended to select the video
``Tae-Bo Workout: Instructional and Basic.''
</P>
<P>
   To generate the lists, Amazon mines the data that all of its
customers provide when they shop: a shipping address, an e-mail
address and the list of items bought. The shipping addresses let it
create its best-seller lists based on geographic areas like towns
or foreign countries. Using the Internet domain name in the e-mail
address, Amazon can often identify a customer's employer or
college, for example.
</P>
<P>
   The lists give no actual sales figures. Nor do the purchase
circles identify individual buyers, even though Amazon.com's data
base is capable of doing so. Amazon said these rankings of
``uniquely best-selling'' products _ titles that are more popular
with a particular group than among its customers generally _ are
simply meant as a way to let browsers know the buying preferences
of people with whom they might have something else in common, or
about whom they might simply be curious.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon and other online retailers have long offered
recommendations generated by software that analyzes buying
patterns, letting a customer know that people who bought the same
R.E.M. and Miles Davis CD's also tend to like Liz Phair, for
instance. The drawback to such referrals is that a customer knows
very little else about who those other customers are.
</P>
<P>
   So Amazon came up with preference circles as a way to give a
customer a stronger sense of common cause with fellow shoppers. The
premise is that peer pressure might make the lists more effective
as a sales tool than a generic list that reflects the buying habits
of the entire country. Amazon said the preference circle lists
would be updated weekly or monthly, depending on the size of the
group. Customers can sign up to have new lists e-mailed to them.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever Amazon.com's motives, once word began circulating last
week of Amazon.com's new program, privacy-rights advocates began
sounding alarms.
</P>
<P>
   ``An awful lot of people, including myself, purchase books using
their own money but using the e-mail address that's assigned to
them by their company,'' said Beth Givens, director of the Privacy
Rights Clearinghouse, a nonprofit organization in San Diego. Ms.
Givens said she would not want one of her own recent book purchases
to show up on a list that might appear to be endorsed by her
organization.
</P>
<P>
   The privacy policy on Amazon's site says the company does not
disclose information about individual customers or their purchases
to outside parties. But the policy statement also says that the
company reserves the right to do so in the future. Amazon.com,
however, allows customers to indicate by e-mail that they never
want their information released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are continuing to look at ways that we can take this data
and reapply it back to Amazon.com in a way that is fun and
interactive, but is done in a way that our customers are
comfortable with,'' Capelli said. ``We would never do anything that
would compromise or call into question individuals' confidentiality
for items they have purchased.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Corporate confidentiality is a separate issue from individual
rights. When Amazon's computers zoom in on purchasing quirks at a
specific company, the results could end up revealing more than
Amazon's customers might like, since the lists are available to any
curious or nosy outsider.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for example, Levi Strauss &AMP; Co., which has been trying to
make its classic jeans brand hip again. Amazon's purchase circle
listing for Levi says that employees at the company have been
busily ordering the books ``Strategic Brand Management,''
``Building Strong Brands'' and ``Street Trends: How Today's
Alternative Youth Cultures Are Creating Tomorrow's Mainstream
Markets.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Beckman, a spokesman for Levi Strauss, said company
officials would not comment on the Amazon list because, ``as you
know, we're intently focused on revitalizing the brands here.''
</P>
<P>
   The Levi book purchases simply confirmed what outsiders already
knew about the company's hot buttons. But critics wondered what
clues outsiders might glean about the internal issues of a company
if its book list revealed heavy purchases of titles about
international expansion, say, or finding a new job.
</P>
<P>
   Anita Allen, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law
School and co-author of a recent book, ``Privacy Law'' (West
Publishing, 1999), said that ``confidential business plans or
corporate issues might be indirectly revealed'' by the lists. But
she said that Amazon's use of customer data in this way was
``disturbing but not necessarily illegal.''
</P>
<P>
   There are laws protecting some facets of individual privacy in
this area. A federal law prohibiting video stores from releasing
movie rental records was passed in 1988 after reporters obtained
such records for Robert Bork when he was a Supreme Court nominee.
And most states have similar laws protecting library patrons from
disclosure of their book-borrowing habits.
</P>
<P>
   But ``things like the Bork law governing video checkouts or
library records don't apply when you have information aggregated''
for many individuals, Ms. Allen said. And in any case, the privacy
laws that would protect individuals in such cases have not been
shown to apply to corporations, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Capelli of Amazon said last week that no companies had
complained about the purchase circles. But because some people had
said that they did not want their purchasing data used for such
lists, the company amended its Web site on Thursday, telling
customers that they could send an e-mail to have their purchases
excluded from the lists. And companies can send faxes on their
corporate letterhead requesting that their employee purchasing
lists be removed from the site.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon also updated its privacy policy to mention the purchase
circles. Customers who never read the privacy policy or visit the
purchase circle pages, however, are unlikely to see this opt-out
information or know that they have a choice about how their
purchasing data are used.
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly the opt-out should appear at the time the individual
is making the purchase,'' said Ms. Givens of the Privacy Rights
Clearinghouse.
</P>
<P>
   Capelli said allowing an opt-out at the time of purchase would
be ``excessive.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the marketing and privacy implications, the lists do
offer an unscientific survey of regional tastes. Outside of major
cities like Los Angeles and New York, the lists of best-selling
music, for example, are remarkably homogeneous across the country,
with artists like Sarah McLachlan and the Dave Matthews Band
predominating.
</P>
<P>
   The book lists show more regional variation. A series of novels
about an imminent apocalypse by Tim LaHaye and Jerry Jenkins is
popular on the charts in Memphis, Tenn.; Wichita, Kan., and
Jackson, Miss. But none of those books made it to New York's list,
which after Andersen's ``Turn of the Century,'' lists ``The Girls'
Guide to Hunting and Fishing'' by Melissa Bank and ``For the Relief
of Unbearable Urges'' by Nathan Englander. The highest-ranked book
in Salt Lake City, meanwhile, is the paperback version of ``Secret
Ceremonies: A Mormon Woman's Intimate Diary of Marriage and
Beyond.''

Nature: Virtual Serengeti a little brutal for children 
By Jack Warner  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A new CD-ROM from Grolier, by way of the television
series ``Nature,'' entitled ``Nature: Virtual Serengeti,'' is aimed
at children, and it has a great many strengths. But it will require
a certain amount of strength from the youngsters who get into it.
</P>
<P>
   Rather than just link together a series of video clips or still
shots, the producers turned out a self-contained education package.
</P>
<P>
   The premise is that a researcher sent to the East African plains
has wandered off to study baboons, and your youngster is recruited
to take his place, finish his research and put together a film for
Nature magazine.
</P>
<P>
   This is less preposterous than it might seem, since from the
frequent e-mails and the stuff he wrote in the research journal,
the original researcher is no more than 10 years old himself.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the new researcher has a base camp, a Land Rover
and a plane to use in studying wildlife from the Mara River to
Amboseli.
</P>
<P>
   The all-important video is based on nodes in each area to be
visited. Each node allows a full 360-degree view by swinging the
cursor to one side of the screen or the other. By clicking on the
horizon or somewhere around it at the proper place, one moves to
another node.
</P>
<P>
   There are animals to be found at virtually every node, but they
aren't obvious. Their presence is indicated by sudden animal
noises, at which point you click around the screen until the view
zeroes in on the animal in question. The animal, and the behavior
observed, are recorded automatically in a long file. These records
can then be used to complete the research simply by connecting the
right picture to the right question.
</P>
<P>
   ``Virtual Serengeti'' is lavishly produced; the video and audio
are very good; and most of it really does shed interesting light on
the behavior and traits of the animals in question. But a major
slip seems to have occurred between the production and the
packaging.
</P>
<P>
   The program comes in a large, multicolored box, inside which is
the usual heavy cardboard stiffener box. When you open all this up,
all that falls out is one shrink-wrapped pasteboard CD-ROM jacket.
</P>
<P>
   There are no instructions, a rather unsettling state of affairs
that seems to be gaining momentum in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Generally, this would be all right, because ``Virtual
Serengeti'' is not a difficult program, and it has a sort of
prelude to orient the user. Unfortunately, some of the finer points
of this prelude don't seem to be quite accurate.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, it indicates that when you see a forward arrow,
you can go forward. You can't. It says you're supposed to sweep the
cursor around each view and when animals are located, it will
change to a sort of box. In practice, animals can't be located
until they make noises, and then the cursor will turn into a box at
a dozen places on the screen, some of which take you to the beast
and some of which don't. In addition, there are about a half-dozen
other cursors that pop up that are entirely unexplained and that
don't seem to do anything most of the time.
</P>
<P>
   All this is going to require a certain amount of patience on the
part of kids.
</P>
<P>
   The second caveat I'm going to issue may or may not be a
problem, depending on your attitude. I don't see it as a problem,
but I tend to put a premium on realism. ``Virtual Serengeti'' is
realistic. Animals die, often violently, which is usually the way
death comes in this part of the world, where the food chain is
plain for all to see.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nature shows on television now don't bat an eye at
this sort of thing, and kids who'd be interested in this program
have probably seen a lot of such shows. But you'll have to be the
judge of that.
</P>
<P>
   Virtual Serengeti costs $30, and if you can't find it locally
you can order it from gi.grolier.com.

Springing for better monitor can be an eye-saver 
By Gerry Yandel  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Since the first time I ventured into a dungeon and
reduced a monster to a pile of fur and gore, I've had this
half-baked notion that it would be really cool to get one of those
60-inch TV sets, hook it to a computer, turn off all the lights and
scare myself silly playing a life-size version of ``Hexen.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, re-creating the putrid tones of the dank walls of
``Hexen'' or the eerie red glow of a ``Doom'' burial chamber in the
living room is much easier said than done.
</P>
<P>
   In my quest for the techno-chops to see what it would take to be
able to creep down a dungeon hallway on a giant-screen TV, I
learned a good deal about monitors, video cards and how they work
together.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first things I learned is that a computer won't work
very well with a TV set. Without getting too technically obtuse,
about the best resolution I could hope for, even using specialized
_ and expensive _ converter equipment, is 640 pixels by 480 pixels,
which would look terrible ... especially on one of those monster TV
sets.
</P>
<P>
   These days, with computer manufacturers practically giving away
their machines, it makes sense to build a system around your
monitor as opposed to the CPU. Especially for people who use their
machines primarily to surf the Net, send e-mail, write letters and
play solitaire.
</P>
<P>
   It's not going to make too much difference whether the computer
you buy for those uses is a 166-MHz or a 500-MHz machine _ unless
you are using some kind of whiz-bang 3-D solitaire game. But there
is a significant difference between a 15-inch, a 17-inch, a 19-inch
and a 21-inch monitor.
</P>
<P>
   It makes even more sense for heavy gamers and artistic types
using complex imaging software to invest extra in a monitor because
they will be spending even more time in front of a machine.
</P>
<P>
   No matter how you look at it, your eyes do most of the heavy
lifting when it comes to computers. In the long run, the money you
invest in a good monitor may save you the price of a pair of
glasses.
</P>
<P>
   Like most things related to computers, there is enough
information on monitors and video cards to fill several thick
books, but a good enough understanding of how video works to make
informed choices is not so hard to come by.
</P>
<P>
   The first thing to know is that two things are involved that
work together but should be considered separately: the monitor and
the video card.
</P>
<P>
   In a simplified explanation, the card tells the monitor what to
display. The monitor is responsible for the display quality _
sharpness, brightness, resolution and stability. The card transfers
the data between the computer and monitor.
</P>
<P>
   So you can buy the biggest, baddest, fastest video card out
there, but if your monitor is a piece of junk, the picture will be
poor. On the other hand, a high-end monitor used with a standard
video card would most likely yield pretty decent results for casual
home users.
</P>
<P>
   There's not a whole lot to the monitor side of things. What you
see, is, um, what you get. The primary considerations when
purchasing a monitor are the refresh rate and the screen size.
</P>
<P>
   Because of cost, the most common screen size was 15 inches as
recently as a year ago, when they cost between $300 and $350. But
17-inch monitors have since fallen to around $200 and are quickly
becoming the screen size of choice, and a 19-inch monitor now costs
what a 15-inch used to cost. Don't forget, too, that screen sizes
are measured diagonally. The viewing area on a 15-inch screen is
actually about 13 inches.
</P>
<P>
   The refresh rate is measured in megahertz _ standard speeds on
new monitors these days are around 65-75 MHz _ and it is the speed
the screen is redrawn, which happens every time the cursor blinks
or moves. A lesser factor is dot pitch _ a measure of the distance
between pixels _ but anything 0.28 mm or less is good, although the
lower the dot pitch, the better.
</P>
<P>
   The most common monitors are cathode ray tube (that's the
familiar picture tube, called the CRT) and liquid crystal display
(LCD) monitors, which use liquid crystals between two polarizing
plates. The flat-panel monitors use the LCD technology and are only
a few inches thick, but they are new to the market and still priced
extremely high. Consider a flat-panel screen if space or design is
a factor _ and you have a couple of hundred spare dollars _ but a
CRT should be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   It's when you start playing games that video gets serious.
Upgrading a video card can enhance every aspect of your computer's
imaging processes.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, your computer has a card that can handle 2-D
display (or else you wouldn't be able to see anything). Systems
from a year or two ago, like my Pentium 166, have cards that handle
2-D and 3-D, albeit in a limited capacity, with 1 or 2 megabytes of
video memory. New systems these days normally come with video cards
that handle 2-D and 3-D display and have at least 4 MB _ if not 8
MB _ of video RAM.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of RAM on a card serves two purposes: the number of
colors that can be processed _ i.e., 8-bit (256 colors) or 24-bit
(16.7 million colors) _ and the speed at which images can be
rendered. Some cards _ like the S3 ViRGE in my computer _ can be
upgraded simply by adding more RAM. Different types of RAM can be
used on video cards, so check the manufacturer's info on your card
to see what it takes. In other cases. it makes more sense to add a
3-D graphics accelerator card, either in addition to or instead of
your VGA card.
</P>
<P>
   The way accelerators work is fairly straightforward. A VGA card
has no processor on it, and all graphics commands to the monitor
come from your CPU. Video accelerators have processors built onto
the card that handle most of the graphics commands and leave your
CPU and video bus free to do other things. Obviously, the more
memory on your video card, the higher the performance. When I
bought my computer a year and a half ago, 1 megabyte of video
memory was cutting edge. Nowadays it's not unusual to see several
different cards available with 16 MB or 32 MB of RAM.
</P>
<P>
   It would be great if video accelerators were no more complex
than that, but, alas, that's not the case. (We are talking about
computers, after all.)
</P>
<P>
   The processors on video cards are proprietary, which means that
each has its own set of commands. Consequently, a game _ or any
other program _ used under one type of card may perform differently
under another video accelerator.
</P>
<P>
   Another quirk to consider: No matter how much you soup up your
video card, it is limited to the top speed of your computer's video
bus. Although there seems to be some debate whether the new video
bus _ called AGP for advanced graphics port _ is really that much
better than the older PCI bus, AGP has become the standard in new
systems.
</P>
<P>
   Manufacturers generally make video accelerators in both flavors
for those of us who have PCI graphics ports and don't have an AGP
slot on the motherboard. Naturally, AGP and PCI are not compatible.
</P>
<P>
   So it shouldn't seem like too big a deal to rig the TV to the
computer, right? Unfortunately, U.S. TVs are only capable of 525
vertical lines of resolution, hence the 640x480 I mentioned
earlier. The advent of HDTV, which will have about double the
resolution capabilities, undoubtedly will change the video picture
(sorry again).
</P>
<P>
   Then again, blowing the life-sized undead into little bits of
decayed flesh at that resolution might be a bit much to stomach.

SimCity 3000 more intellectually challenging than its predecessors 
By Charles Haddad  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ ``SimCity'' always has been a thing of intellectual
beauty. This computer game is so well thought out, so full of
nuances in its understanding of modern urban life, that you can
play it again and again and still be surprised.
</P>
<P>
   This tradition continues with the latest version, ``SimCity
3000.'' The PC version has been out for more than a year. The Mac
version has now been released.
</P>
<P>
   ``SimCity 3000'' is even more sophisticated and complex than its
two predecessors, making game play not only addictive but much more
challenging. I built a city of 180,000 and watched it collapse in
financial ruin. You never can let your guard down in this version
of ``SimCity.''
</P>
<P>
   The first thing you'll notice about ``SimCity 3000'' is the
stunning new look. There are hundreds of new buildings, and you can
study them at street level. You'll see people walking your streets
and all kinds of traffic: buses, cars, firetrucks and police cars,
to name a few. In ``SimCity 2000,'' the only representation of
traffic was a flowing river of little blue dots.
</P>
<P>
   ``SimCity 3000'' has added lots of new special buildings given
as awards. For instance, if you reach a certain population level
you'll receive a university, a golf course, a medical research
complex and many more.
</P>
<P>
   The game includes replicas of scores of famous buildings from
around the world. There's the United Nations complex, Westin
Peachtree Plaza and Notre Dame, to name a few. You can add up to 10
of these landmark buildings in any city.
</P>
<P>
   With this additional detail comes added complexity. In addition
to traffic, development, power and water, you now must manage
waste. Left unmanaged, it will litter your streets and pollute your
water. This is a major new challenge to master in developing a
successful city.
</P>
<P>
   Another big new challenge is deal-making with neighbors. You can
sell them your garbage, for example, or take the garbage of others
for a fee.
</P>
<P>
   These added elements make ``SimCity 3000'' more difficult to
play and less forgiving of mistakes, even at the easiest levels. In
earlier versions, with a city of 180,000, I pretty much would have
been home free.
</P>
<P>
   While ``SimCity 3000'' is stunning, it does have a few
weaknesses. A big one is the huge amount of computing power needed.
You have to set virtual memory, for example, at a minimum of 128
megabytes to play.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the functions appear to need tweaking. It's very hard _
in some cases impossible _ to build bridges. Nor does the game
recognize basic Mac key commands such as Command W to close a
window.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, though, this is a great new version of a great game.

Search engines refining `pathfinder' services 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ One of the big changes on the Web over the last few
years has been the addition of truly useful services.
</P>
<P>
   In the beginning, the World Wide Web was more of a curiosity _ a
pig that could sing _ but nowadays many of us use the Web in daily
life. Today, we'll take a look at some sites that can help you find
a good barber, locate the nearest grocery store or help you
navigate to a new friend's home.
</P>
<P>
   Let's travel to our first of these ``pathfinder'' sites. It's
called AltaVista Connections and is located at www.zip2.com/.
AltaVista, as you probably know, is one of the best known of the
search engines. But _ as is true of most of these places _ it has
diversified into other services.
</P>
<P>
   When you go to that page, you'll see a list of services and
businesses such as dining, home and real estate, health, and sports
and recreation. Clicking on any of these broad topics brings up
other lists of specific kinds of businesses. Once you select the
exact type of business you want to find, the search engine will ask
you for your home address.
</P>
<P>
   Now the site can really go to work. It'll give you a list of
businesses in that category _ let's say barber shops _ that are
near your home. You'll be told how far away each is, its address
and its phone number. If you wish, you can get a map and driving
directions to that location.
</P>
<P>
   The next site today is maintained by another search engine,
Yahoo, and it's located at yp
</P>
<P>
   .yahoo.com/. This site works very much like the one from
AltaVista. The mechanics of how you go about it are a little
different, but the end result will be the same sort of a list of
businesses, addresses and phone numbers.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, one nifty thing about the Yahoo site may surprise you or
frighten you (since some people have an almost obsessive fear that
computers are somehow invading their privacy). The Yahoo site uses
a cookie (a tiny text file it sends to your computer) that will
identify you the next time you try the service. So, on subsequent
visits from the same computer, you can simply select the business
category and Yahoo will automatically assume that your home address
is the same as it was last time. It gets all that information from
the cookie.

Accelerator card, more RAM can make PC game-ready 
By Bill Husted  
c. 1999 Cox News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I had a friend who claimed she quit school in the
third grade because of recess. She said: I don't play games.
</P>
<P>
   When I first began using computers _ back when the Appalachian
Mountains were young _ games fascinated me. The graphics in some of
the earliest games were literally little dots on the monochrome
screen. If there was sound at all, it was no more than a beep that
came from the PC's built-in speaker.
</P>
<P>
   I continued playing through the advent of the color monitor and
saw games become increasingly complicated. I saw the day when games
(as they are now) were the most demanding application run on most
home PCs. You need more processing power and better video
performance for ``Mutant Martian Unwed Mothers'' than for your word
processor, to check e-mail or even to mess with the
graphics-intensive Web.
</P>
<P>
   While my home computer is an OK machine (a 350-megahertz Pentium
II), it wasn't in shape to play games when I got the urge to try
them again. Finding a game was not a problem. Since I write about
computers, there are usually plenty of review copies to try. But _
for most new games _ I needed more oomph than my PC could deliver.
</P>
<P>
   Since I was determined to try a game, I spent some time (and
money) getting my PC game-capable. I pay my own way when it comes
to my home PC. I don't take free machines or hardware _ that would
create a conflict of interest when it comes to writing about the
various companies. So it was out of the question to buy a new PC
already up to the task. It also meant I couldn't wander the aisles
of the computer stores and ignore the price tags.
</P>
<P>
   Serious gamers will get nothing from my adventure. They use
top-of-the-line machines and spend hours reading about and
discussing the latest hardware. But if you are a typical home PC
user and just looking to play an occasional game, maybe what I
learned can help.
</P>
<P>
   The most important (and expensive) part of the game upgrade was
to replace my old plain vanilla video card with a 3-D accelerator
card. Since I'm writing this for the real PC novice, let's stop and
explain some things. The hardware device that connects your monitor
to the PC is a video card. Like your computer, it has memory chips
of its own. For most applications _ word processing, home finance
programs, Web browsing, spreadsheets and the like _ any video card
with 4 to 8 megabytes of RAM works fine. Most modern games profit
(and some require) a video card that uses a special accelerator
chip that makes game graphics come alive.
</P>
<P>
   You simply pull out your old video card and replace it with the
new one (the accelerator card will work fine for your regular
computing chores, too; you don't need both). Before you go
shopping, check your computer manual to see if your video card uses
the Advanced Graphics Port connection. That's a special slot in
your PC designed for these cards (they'll say AGP on the box). Get
the AGP video accelerator card if your computer supports that
standard, and get the regular one if it doesn't.
</P>
<P>
   If you're curious, I bought the Voodoo 3D card with 16 megabytes
of memory. There are plenty to choose from, and it would be smart
to read reviews in a computer gaming magazine before you buy. I
paid around $130 for the card. There are plenty that are much more
expensive and have twice that amount of memory. But those are for
heavy-duty gamers. My 16-megabyte card worked fine. And Voodoo is a
popular brand, so almost any game you find will work fine on that
card.
</P>
<P>
   Since my computer, probably like yours, already had a halfway
decent sound system, the only other upgrade I needed was memory.
Memory is a great investment. Adding RAM _ unlike an accelerator
card _ speeds everything you do. If you have 32 megabytes, you
definitely need to bump the memory up to 64 megabytes. I already
had 64 megabytes, and I upgraded to 128 megabytes and saw a
performance increase. But, if you are frugal, you can get by fine
with 64 megabytes.
</P>
<P>
   If you have a relatively modern PC, that's all you need to play
a game or two. I did everything for about $200. So, if you want to
play games, there is no need to quit school and get a job.

QUITTERS NEVER WIN _ OR GO HOME
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)  By DR. EMILIO BOMBAY  
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: Recently, I have been having problems shutting
down my computer. It will get to the part where it says ``Please
wait while your computer shuts down,'' and then it doesn't. I know
I need to get it worked on, but would like to have some idea of
what they need to do rather than just paying for anything the tech
tells me.
</P>
<P>
   _ Quittin' Time
</P>
<P>
   DEAR QUIT: This is such a common problem, I don't even know
where to start. Or stop, I guess. And the first thing we have to
stop is this ridiculous notion you have to pay somebody to fix your
computer problems.
</P>
<P>
   A Windows machine is no Macintosh. You actually have to learn
what makes it tick, and you get smarter in the process. So here's
lesson No. 1: The reason it takes Windows so long to shut down is
that it's trying to terminate all the stuff that's going on behind
the scenes, making it safe for you to kill the power. That stuff
can include programs that are running, memory caches that are being
dumped or even Microsoft Stealth Inquisitor 2000 transferring your
bank balance and all your private personal records to World
Domination Headquarters in Redmond, Wash.
</P>
<P>
   Something is refusing to shut itself down, so Windows can't. Do
a Control-Alt-Delete, and you'll see everything that's going on
displayed in a new window on your screen. You can selectively
terminate programs there, then try shutting down to see if things
work better. Virus checkers are prime candidates for gumming things
up, but almost anything else has the potential to do it, too.
</P>
<P>
   I've also seen a clogged CD-ROM memory cache get caught in the
flywheel. Unless you're some data-crunching Poindexter, right-click
on My Computer, then select Properties. Click the Performance tab,
and go for the File System button. You get another set of tabs to
deal with. Hit the CD-ROM tab and cut your cache size to the
minimum. Never thought you'd turn into such a tech-head did you?
But look how much more you know about your computer now.
</P>
<P>
   If things are still jammed, Microsoft has an online
troubleshooter to help you identify the problem. I guess they got
tired of answering calls from irate consumers, Go to
support.microsoft.com/support/tshoot/w98startup.asp and have at it.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I forgot about using the Add/Remove utility in
Windows 98 to eliminate programs. I merely deleted the folders to
get rid of them. They are still listed in the Add/Remove programs
list, though.
</P>
<P>
   _ Gone But Not Forgotten
</P>
<P>
   DEAR GONE: Normally, I'd tell you to go look on Microsoft's Web
site for TweakUI, a wonderful little free utility that works harder
than my rehab counselor. One of the things it does is clear bogus
entries from that list.
</P>
<P>
   But it's as if Microsoft is embarrassed by TweakUI, which
contains tools that are so helpful only a moron would have left
them out of the release version of Windows. If it's still on the
download site at all, then it's hidden better than crazy old Uncle
Elbert during a Bombay family reunion. Tweak UI used to be buried
on the Win98 CD, too, but I can't find it on the Second Edition
disc.
</P>
<P>
   Don't mess with Microsoft. Go to www.shareware.com and do a
search for TweakUI98.
</P>
<P>
   DEAR DR. BOMBAY: I would appreciate it if you would let me know
if you get this E-mail.
</P>
<P>
   _ Without a Clue
</P>
<P>
   DEAR CLUE: Nope. Never got it. Better try again.
</P>
<P>
   (Dr. Bombay will let you know if he doesn't get your e-mail,
too. Just look for no letter from him in your mailbox to confirm
nonreceipt. The address is drbombay(at)star-telegram.com or, if you

<P>
   ``How to Stay Christian in College''
</P>
<P>
   By J. Budziszewski
</P>
<P>
   NavPress, $8
</P>
<P>
   J. Budziszewski's resume reads (in part): ``Former atheist, Yale
Ph.D. and 18-year faculty veteran of the University of Texas at
Austin.'' So his credentials for writing a book on retaining faith
while gaining a degree are about as good as those of any and better
than those of many.
</P>
<P>
   The university experience, Budziszewski observes in ``How to
Stay Christian in College,'' ``can be like moving to Mars.'' The
author sets his stage by discussing two views of the non-Christian
world _ its own and God's _ and then moves on to tackle common
myths and how to cope with campus social, religious and classroom
life.
</P>
<P>
   Budziszewski's style is blunt and common-sensical. Particularly
worthwhile are his observations on love and sex (''on guy myths my
comments will be about fifty percent longer because guys take more
convincing'') and discussing beliefs with others (''challenge the
ridicule _ but do so calmly, concisely and politely'').
</P>
<P>
   You may not agree with all of this academician's lecture, but
his class is worth the minimal tuition.

   ``Back to My Roots''
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Womack
</P>
<P>
   The Right Stuff
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Womack is best known for his R&AMP;B hits _ including
``Lookin' for a Love'' and ``It's All Over Now,'' the latter a hit
single for the Rolling Stones _ even though he started off singing
gospel as part of the Womack Brothers.
</P>
<P>
   Incredibly enough, the new ``Back to My Roots'' is Womack's
first gospel CD, and it's a gem. R&AMP;B always stemed largely from
gospel, and the 17 tracks find Womack, 55, fusing the two and
putting his own stamp on a variety of standards, such as ``Jesus Be
a Fence Around Me,'' as well as Paul Simon's ``Bridge Over Troubled
Water.''
</P>
<P>
   Womack's grainy, gritty voice is still excellent, and he knows
just how to shape the favorites he has chosen. He rewrites Sam
Cooke's ``Stand by Me'' to include some overtly religious lyrics,
strolls through ``What a Friend We Have in Jesus,'' and imbues ``Oh
Happy Day'' with all the joy one could ask for.
</P>
<P>
   Womack has certainly been through his own problems (he's
admitted to past drug use), and to hear him praising Jesus and
doing so well is a real treat. He sounds like a survivor who
realizes how much he nearly lost, and how much he has to live for.
Any Womack fan _ and indeed, any gospel fan _ should add this to
his or her collection.

INTERNET NOT YET A THREAT TO THE CAMPUS BOOKSTORE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By DANIELLE FURFARO   
 c.1999 Albany Times Union   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ College bookstores have enjoyed a virtual
monopoly on textbook sales for years. The Internet promised to
change that.
</P>
<P>
   But so far, it's just a promise. A spot check of textbook Web
sites indicates that e-commerce prices are not always cheaper, some
take weeks for delivery and choice is limited.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easier to look around in a bookstore where you know you
can find the books you need,'' said Mark Simmons, a junior at the
State University of New York at Albany.
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, professors at SUNY-Albany have given a list of
required and recommended books for each course to the school
bookstore, which is owned by the national retailer Barnes and
Noble. The store then makes sure that it has enough of each book
for all students taking a class.
</P>
<P>
   SUNY-Albany's only competitor for textbooks is Mary Jane Books,
a downtown retailer. However, since the independent textbook store
opened before the spring 1998 semester, most professors have
ignored the store's requests for book lists, making it difficult
for Mary Jane Books to compete with Barnes and Noble. The store has
sent Freedom of Information Act requests to both the administration
and the professors seeking the lists, according to Mary Jane Books
owner Adam Militello.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it is still the university that is responsible,''
Militello said. ``It'll be a cold day in hell before I sue a
faculty member.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, several textbook stores and distributors opened
e-commerce sites, with inventories that cover the reading lists of
several courses offered at the university.
</P>
<P>
   Although these sites advertise prices discounted as much as 60
percent, many on-line sites charge higher prices than the Barnes
and Noble store at SUNY-Albany.
</P>
<P>
   For example, ``Science of Ecology,'' which is required for a
biology course, costs $89 at the university's bookstore. At
efollett.com, a wholesale bookseller in Illinois, the book costs
$97. The company also charges a minimum shipping fee of $3.95 for
the first book and 95 cents for each additional book in the same
order. It also takes two to three weeks to ship.
</P>
<P>
   There were many books in a survey sample that were not available
from the site or only available new, even though the company bills
itself as the largest wholesaler of used books in the country.
</P>
<P>
   In a survey of prices of randomly selected textbooks required
for courses at SUNY-Albany, only one on-line site offered lower
prices than those of Barnes and Noble.
</P>
<P>
   That site is bigwords.com, a startup Internet company in San
Francisco that compiles the reading lists of classes across the
country by contacting professors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bookstores of public institutions have to give you the
reading list information, but it usually gets changed after you
receive it,'' said the company's co-founder, John Bates. ``If you
have a good relationship with the professors, they will give you
the updated information.''
</P>
<P>
   The company charges $78.12 for ``Science of Ecology.'' It does
not charge for regular three- to five-day shipping on orders of
more than $35, and there is no state sales tax.

HURDLE TO NET GROWTH SEEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By ROSS KERBER   
 c.1999 The Boston Globe   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Poll some of the Internet's top technical gurus and
each might name a different issue as the chief impediment to the
growth of the on-line medium.
</P>
<P>
   But when just such a group was assembled at Harvard University
Tuesday, there did seem to be a near-consensus that one of the
biggest problems isn't technical so much as social: the large
number of people who presently lack the skills to make full use of
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   ``That'll be a big bottleneck, more than any technology,'' said
Leonard Kleinrock, a professor at the University of California at
Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Just how to solve the problem was a matter of some dispute _ and
the point of the panel discussion held in Sanders Theatre, part of
a conference sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery.
</P>
<P>
   The technical organization, based in New York, held a special
meeting to review the technical history and outlook of the Internet
and drew some of the chief academic and industry figures whose work
in the 1960s through the 1980s laid the foundations of the
international computer network.
</P>
<P>
   Forecasting the outlook for the new medium would seem a
formidable task, in an era when many advances are made by obscure
Internet start-ups rather than in famous university labs.
</P>
<P>
   But conference organizer Lyman Chapin, chief technology officer
of GTE Internetworking in Cambridge, said young entrepreneurs might
gain some insight into the process through which the Internet has
evolved _ a goal that seemed to be borne out by the several hundred
twenty and thirtysomethings who turned out to hear the public
discussion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's easy to think of the people who invented the Internet as
a bunch of graybeards,'' Chapin said. ``But I think there's a lot
of room to combine their energy and ideas with what's happening
today.''
</P>
<P>
   The panel's discussion touched on many technical issues, such as
how to improve current Internet codes to express Asian language
characters, or the most economic ways to connect masses of
individual homes to high-speed data networks.
</P>
<P>
   Some fundamental themes came up as well, chiefly just how much
knowledge designers of new networks and Web sites should assume
among the general population.
</P>
<P>
   Not much, implied Kleinrock, the UCLA professor, best known for
developing ways to move data quickly over high-speed digital
networks. He argued the increasing complexity of software has
already begun to discourage many potential new users. They suffer
from what he called ``feature shock,'' or a disinclination to
relearn fancy new software programs every year.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a question of just how much ability humans have to learn
a new technology,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But Robert Kahn, who began a key networking program as a
Pentagon official in 1973, suggested the opposite: that more people
might be trained with programming skills of their own. Such steps,
said former IBM researcher Paul Green, would help bring populations
on line in poorer areas and in the developing countries. The issue
is not more to distribute more expensive hardware, he said, but
rather how much it costs general users to ``get friendly'' with
software and technology in general.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the ultimate academic answer came from Dave Clark, a
senior researcher at MIT, who called for more research into exactly
what Internet users want. ``We techies tend to be presumptuous,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Other parts of Tuesday's conference featured war stories from
the senior scientists, told in what the conference program
described as ``a collective oral history format.''
</P>
<P>
   One popular speaker was David Walden, a retired engineer who
once helped Cambridge-based BBN Corp. build computers used to send
the first digital messages over a West Coast data network 30 years
ago next month.
</P>
<P>
   The devices were built to the specifications of the University
of California researchers who conducted tests of the system, Walden
recalled. But at the same time, the machines were configured to
specifications set by the US military agencies who paid for the
early research _ and who were wary of curious academics who might
make changes without permission, what would later be known as
``hacking.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We worked very hard at trying to have this thing run in what
they consdered the hostile university environment,'' Walden said.

MARKET PLACE: HOW RELIABLE IS INTERNET RETAILERS' FINANCIAL DATA?

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Financial reports from Internet retailers are like the
pronouncements of the Delphic Oracle: future-focused and infamously
inscrutable.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional retailers, Sears and Wal-Mart among them, report
changes in sales for stores open at least one year, providing
analysts a way to evaluate whether growth is real or merely a
construct of new stores. Online merchants offer no such equivalent.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, the king of e-tailers, reports skyrocketing revenues
each quarter. But the numbers include income from newly acquired
businesses, leaving outsiders no way to discern whether the core
book business is driving the growth or whether income from the new
additions masks a decline there. (In his most recent quarterly call
with investors, Amazon.com founder and chief executive Jeff Bezos
said revenue was growing across all parts of the business, but
declined to give specifics. His remarks put pressure on the stock,
which has fallen 40 percent from its peak in April but remains up
16 percent for the year.)
</P>
<P>
   Since most Wall Street analysts who follow Internet retailers
work for firms grown fat on taking these companies public, there is
little incentive to complain. But a small group of renegade
skeptics has taken on the task of clearing the fog and are applying
their approach to companies besides Amazon. Their method is simple
_ perhaps deceptively so. They are taking the two numbers that
e-tailers love to trumpet (because they are always growing) _ total
revenues for a quarter and total customer base _ and dividing one
by the other. The results are eyebrow raising. They go straight
down.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Von der Porten, who runs a small hedge fund in San Carlos,
Calif., has crunched the numbers for Amazon and CDNow, the online
music store rated the sixth-largest Web shopping site in July by
MediaMetrix. He found that CDNow's revenues per customer declined
in 1998 from $23.15 to $21.26. The first half of 1999, after CDNow
bought a competitor N2K, brought an even more precipitous drop to
$18.15 at the end of the first quarter and $14.42 in the second.
</P>
<P>
   For Amazon, Von der Porten calculates a similar plunge. Revenues
per customer for the fiscal quarter ended in July were $29.26, down
20 percent from a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Looked at through this prism, Ebay also looks like a bloodbath.
Faye Landes, who follows the online auction leader for Thomas
Weisel Partners, estimates that revenues per user declined from
$10.30 in the first quarter of 1998 to $6.80 for the second quarter
of this year. Significantly, the decline resists cyclical upturns
around Christmas, and has been a steady drum beat since early last
year.
</P>
<P>
   The sharp drop at Ebay suggests that its dazzling stock gain may
be masking a major weakness. Ebay's stock has gained 56 percent
this year. Ebay closed Tuesday at $125.5625, up $6.125, while CDNow
closed at $14.125, down 22 percent for the year and well off its
$16 offering price.
</P>
<P>
   Internet companies are swift to point out the gaping flaw in the
formula, namely that the number of customers is cumulative, not
taking into account people who shop once or twice and never come
back. It is inherently unfair, they say, to divide revenues for one
quarter by all-time customers. ``Not every person shops every
quarter. So a steady decline is exactly what you would expect to
see,'' said Bill Curry, an exasperated Amazon spokesman.
</P>
<P>
   Ebay also faults the approach. ``It doesn't pass the common
sense test,'' added Steve Westly, a vice president of Ebay. ``On
average, the number is going down because not all customers stay,
but the customer who is staying is spending so much more that it
outweighs the attrition.''
</P>
<P>
   While stock analysts acknowledge the equation is not perfect,
they say it is justified by the companies' own business model.
Online merchants have long argued that they should not be judged as
conventional businesses. They justify huge current loses by saying
that revenues will be recouped as customers spend more.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon, for example, rationalizes the deficits it has rung up
lately to add an auction house and a toy store to its site by
reasoning that in the future, customers who previously used the
site to buy just books will add a Ricky Martin CD and Pokemon cards
to their shopping baskets when they come in search of the John
Grisham thriller.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are the ones inviting this comparison and this
calculation,'' Von Der Porten said. ``E-tailers need strong repeat
business in order to generate profits from their customer bases.
That's why the declining per-customer revenues call into question
the viability of the business model.''
</P>
<P>
   Sensitive as they are to the criticism, Internet retailers have
not released numbers that might make such imperfect calculations
unnecessary. Amazon could disclose how many customers it has each
quarter, a statistic that would provide a fairer measure of growth.
Will they? ``Nope,'' said Curry. ``We consider that proprietary
information.''

INTEL'S NEW PROCESSOR LINE TO FOCUS ON INTERNET LINKS  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Repeating as part of a weekly roundup of computer features)   By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Trying to expand its core personal computer
business into a new market, the Intel Corp. will announce a new
family of processors on Wednesday capable of powering the devices
that route data through corporate networks and the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement follows an initial public demonstration Tuesday
of Intel's much-ballyhooed Merced chip, designed around a new
64-bit architecture, which Intel has been developing with the
Hewlett-Packard Co. and expects to begin shipping in volume in
mid-2000. All the activity was timed to coincide with the Intel
Developer Forum in Palm Springs, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Both developments reflect Intel's increasing expansion of its
core business _ processors for personal computers and work stations
_ into three new areas, all connected to the Internet: network
processors; servers, computers that manage network resources, and
what Intel calls ``bit factories,'' networks of computers housed
and managed by Intel that power electronic-commerce sites.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are investing heavily in developing all of those efforts,''
said Pat Gelsinger, vice president and general manager for the
Intel Desktop Products Group.
</P>
<P>
   The company plans to base its new line of network-oriented
processors on what it is calling the Intel Internet Exchange
Architecture, or IX, an open specification for the design of a
system of hardware components that can be linked together to
provide the framework for Internet devices.
</P>
<P>
   An open architecture allows the system to be connected easily to
devices and programs made by other manufacturers. The blueprint for
the design will be released to enable systems designers to build
products compatible with the Intel products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been the brains of the personal computer; now we want to
become the brains of the Internet,'' said Mark Christensen, vice
president and general manager of Intel's Network Communications
Group.
</P>
<P>
   The flagship component of the new Intel line is a network
processor that, rather than being built for a specific function, is
flexible and can be programmed to perform different tasks.
Christensen said the new processor would make possible a
fundamental shift in networking and communications system design,
an area that has typically relied on a development cycle of one to
two years for custom chips hard-wired for very specific tasks.
</P>
<P>
   The network processor is designed to allow greater flexibility
for manufacturers of devices _ routers, switches and access
concentrators _ that control the flow of information through the
Internet. Companies designing products that work on top of the
Intel framework could add features to networking products after
they have been deployed, Christensen said, thereby speeding the
development process and potentially extending product life.
</P>
<P>
   Intel said it was now shipping samples and would be in
production in the fourth quarter, with the network-processor-based
systems costing significantly less than custom-built systems
typically used today.
</P>
<P>
   ``Intel is saying let's move away from a hardware-intensive
model and move toward something more software intensive,'' said
John Armstrong, an analyst at Dataquest, based in San Jose, Calif.
``The opportunities here are very big.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts and officials of other companies said they expected IBM
to announce its own initiative in the network processor field this
week.
</P>
<P>
   For its part, Intel will establish a $200 million fund that will
be used in part to invest in companies developing hardware and
software based on the IX architecture.
</P>
<P>
   Companies that Intel said plan to endorse the Intel architecture
or announce specific products that incorporate elements of it are
Broadband Access Systems; Cabletron; CAG; Cisco, and Newbridge
Networks.
</P>
<P>
   One company already in the business of making building blocks
for network systems is the C-Port Corp., a start-up based in North
Andover, Mass. C-Port announced an open architecture for network
processors in February and followed last week with a programmable
chip that fits into their architecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're changing the business from being hardware based to being
software and service based,'' said Larry Walker, the company's
chief executive. ``We invite Intel to work with us.'' He said
C-Port would soon announce a collaboration with IBM for a standard
for their architecture so that software compatible with IBM
hardware will also work with C-Port's hardware.
</P>
<P>
   At the Palm Springs conference Tuesday, Intel's president and
chief executive, Craig Barrett, demonstrated the Merced processor,
whose 64-bit chip architecture will process data in longer chunks
than the current standard 32 bits. The chip is intended both for
high-end work stations and for Internet server applications. Intel
said that it had begun shipping engineering samples of the Merced
to computer companies for testing and that it remains on track for
production in mid-2000.
</P>
<P>
   Intel's stock closed down 6.25 cents Tuesday, at $82.1875.

EVOLVING DIGITALLY INTO RESPECTABILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Michigan, California)  (dal) 
 By SARA ROBINSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Richard Lenski, a biologist at Michigan State University, used
to study evolution by allowing bacteria to reproduce, generation
after generation, in a laboratory dish. Now he just lets digital
organisms run rampant in a computer.
</P>
<P>
   The virtual organisms are small programs that, like computer
viruses, are capable of replicating over and over. But unlike
computer viruses, digital organisms can help, not harm: they can be
a tool for studying how real organisms change and adapt, an area
that has long stymied researchers because the evolutionary process
is slow.
</P>
<P>
   In a paper published last month in the journal Nature, Lenski
collaborated with Chris Adami, a physicist at the California
Institute of Technology, and others to create an artificial world
to study populations of digital organisms that replicate, mutate
and compete for resources. The researchers used a software program
called Avida, which was designed by Adami and one of his students,
Charles Ofria.
</P>
<P>
   ``The novelty for me is that here we have completely distinct
organisms that we can do genetics with,'' Lenski said. ``This is
throwing in a whole new class of organisms not derived from that
common ancestor on earth.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of life-like creatures created by computer programs as a
tool for biological research is one aspect of a growing field of
research known as artificial life. While the field has existed for
decades, it has long been viewed with skepticism by some computer
scientists who dismiss it as eccentric and by some biologists who
believe that the study of artificial organisms does not have much
relevance to actual life forms.
</P>
<P>
   But Chris Langton, editor of the journal Artificial Life, said
the field was undergoing a quiet renaissance. The study by Lenski
and Adami is significant, he said, not so much because the
techniques are new or the conclusions startling. Rather, he said,
it represents an ``interesting collaboration'' between an
artificial life researcher and a well-respected biologist. And even
more significant, the study was published in Nature, one of the
world's premier research journals for biologists.
</P>
<P>
   Inman Harvey, a scientist at the University of Sussex in England
who wrote an article accompanying the paper in Nature, said he
concurred with Langton's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This Lenski paper may well be a first in explicitly mentioning
artificial life techniques in such a prestigious journal,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   In the study, each organism contained a command to copy itself
one line at a time before dividing in half and spawning another
organism. The copying process was intentionally made imperfect to
simulate the naturally occurring mutations of genes in living
organisms.
</P>
<P>
   Digital organisms that could perform certain simple mathematical
computations were rewarded with extra computer processing time _
the equivalent of the energy and nutrients for which real organisms
compete. That extra processing time, in turn, enabled the fittest
organisms to replicate more frequently.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers used their artificial world to study the effects
of mutations on evolution. The Avida program allowed them to
systematically mutate the genes of these creatures one at a time
and then study the effects thousands of generations later.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can turn off and on any mechanism we want to study, which
is quite hard to do with living organisms,'' Adami said. ``It opens
up all kinds of avenues that you can go down. We can study 10,000
generations of these organisms then go back and change one thing
and then study 10,000 generations again.''
</P>
<P>
   While Lenski said he believed the method and philosophy of the
experiment was at least as interesting as the specific results of
the experiments, there were two findings he highlighted.
</P>
<P>
   The first was that the combined effect of multiple mutations was
greater than the sum of the effects of individual mutations.
Studies of evolution, Lenski explained, have often focused on the
effect of mutations of a single gene.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we can generalize single-gene studies depends on
whether the interactions of multiple mutations have a big effect or
not,'' he said. In these digital organisms, interactions of
multiple mutations proved to be very significant, supporting the
conclusions of less exhaustive studies with real organisms.
</P>
<P>
   The second result was the finding that size and complexity _ in
this case the length and computational power of the digital
organism _ protects organisms against the harmful effects of
mutations. ``I don't know if people have asked that question _
whether complexity protects against mutations _ in real
organisms,'' Lenski said. ``It's a very rare lab that even works on
multiple organisms.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear whether digital organisms will become widely
accepted as research subjects among biologists in the future, but
Adami said that since the Nature article had appeared, other
biological researchers had expressed strong interest in his
software.
</P>
<P>
   While his software used to be downloaded fewer than 10 times
each week, Adami said, it has been downloaded 4,000 to 5,000 times
since the Nature article appeared on Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biologists haven't been able to make sweeping studies on life
as a whole,'' he said. ``We think this has created a new avenue of
research.''

   Spam decomposing on a plate, penguins falling on their faces and
a cubicle dweller coping with day-to-day office life: Webcams have
brought out an odd combination of the voyeur and exhibitionist.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cam,'' like .com, has become a trendy technological suffix for
sites like the Spam Cam (www.fright.com/spam/spamcam.html), the
Penguincam (www.discovery.com/cams/penguin/penguinmain.html) and
the Davecam (ranier.oact.hq.nasa.gov/staff/davecam.shtm).
</P>
<P>
   There is Kremlinkam, Fogcam, Trafficam. Animals, in particular,
seem to draw large Internet audiences to sites like Puppy Cam,
Catcam, Sharkcam. They are overshadowed only by webcams that cater
to voyeurs, like the well-known Jennicam. Last year there was
Monicacam, which surveyed the building office doors of Monica
Lewinsky's lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   Prices for Webcams have become reasonable; rebates and discounts
available for many models can bring the cost of Webcams down
sharply from list prices. For less than $100 and a dial-up Internet
connection, home computer users can set up their own cameras, hook
them up to the World Wide Web and become one-person broadcast
studios.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Ringley, of Jennicam fame, uses four Webcams for her
broadcasts, including a Connectix Quickcam Pro, a model now sold
under the Logitech name. That model was also featured in a pivotal
scene in the recent movie ``American Pie.''
</P>
<P>
   More than 1,000 Webcams are sold each day, according to NPD
Intelect, a market tracking firm in Port Washington, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   All Webcams on the market can take single shots and can record
digital video. Single shots can be used to update Web pages, can be
sent via e-mail to friends and relatives or can be manipulated in
photo editing programs.
</P>
<P>
   Digital video feeds allow business executives and families to
talk over the Internet, emulating the futuristic videophones in the
``Jetsons'' cartoons. Webcams with motion sensor capabilities have
also found a niche as security devices for computers _ you leave it
on and if someone moves nearby it captures the image.
</P>
<P>
   The market leader for home Webcams is Logitech, which has models
compatible with Macs and PCs. Other large manufacturers are
Panasonic, Creative Labs, Intel and Kodak; all of them sell Webcams
in the $80-to-$130 price range, mostly for PCs. The brand-name
companies are popular because of their warranties and level of
technical support, but low-cost cameras can also succeed. Ezonics
has carved out a niche with its Ezcam, which costs less than $50
after a rebate.
</P>
<P>
   A Webcam consists of a digital camera and software, which are
sold as a package. When selecting the camera, the most important
things to consider are picture quality, the maneuverability of the
camera (how well it pans or tilts) and the cost. In the last two
years, Webcams have improved in quality while dropping in price.
</P>
<P>
   But home digital studios still have a long way to go; the
quality of the pictures is far from that seen on television or in
camcorder shots. Lighting in the Webcam world is seldom flattering,
the pictures are jerky, and the resolution is poor. Nonetheless,
users still find it a great novelty to see their own movements
captured on computer monitors for the very first time.
</P>
<P>
   The installation of Webcams has been standardized. Almost all
manufacturers sell PC models that feature Universal Serial Bus, or
USB, ports, and some still sell versions with parallel and serial
port connections.
</P>
<P>
   Not too long ago, installing a Webcam meant digging into the
innards of the computer to put in a video capture card. USB
connections mean that users are ready to go after plugging in the
camera and popping in a software CD _ barring any software
glitches, which can be a nightmare to solve.
</P>
<P>
   Computers manufactured after 1996 probably have USB ports. For
earlier models, USB cards can be purchased for $30 to $150 to plug
into the PCI slot. (A computer that is too old for a PCI slot is
probably not powerful enough to handle a Webcam's video feed.)
</P>
<P>
   The minimum system requirements for a PC are: Windows 95 or
later, a Pentium 100-megahertz chip or faster and 16 megabytes of
RAM and 10 megabytes of free hard-disk space.
</P>
<P>
   The main components of Webcams are analogous to those in the
human eye. A Webcam has a lens; a sensor, which captures images
like a retina, and a computer chip, which acts like a brain to
translate the light patterns into data.
</P>
<P>
   Glass lenses generally produce better pictures than plastic
ones. But glass lenses are also up to three times as expensive so
the Webcams designed for home users tend to have plastic lenses.
</P>
<P>
   Two types of resolution are available for sensors. Common
Interchange Format, or CIF, sensors cost a lot less than Video
Graphics Array, or VGA, sensors but have only one-third the
resolution. The greatest resolution for home Webcams is 640 by 480
pixels, the VGA resolution. Any resolution higher than that has
been augmented by software.
</P>
<P>
   VGA Webcams have sold for $140 and up, but prices recently
dipped below the $100 mark. Creative Labs recently came out with a
VGA Webcam III priced at $80.
</P>
<P>
   There are two competing technologies for image sensors:
Complementary Metal Oxide Silicon, or CMOS, and Charged-Coupled
Devices, or CCD. While CMOS is less expensive, smaller and uses
less power, it is not as efficient as CCD in very low light.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, bright light causes CCD sensors to produce a
halo-like effect known as light bloom. But in most lighting
situations, both types perform comparably. All cameras work best
with soft diffused lighting hitting the face.
</P>
<P>
   An important, but not critical distinction between home Webcams
is in how fast they can capture images. Webcams, like film, create
moving images by capturing a succession of still images, or frames.
The higher the number of frames per second, the higher the quality.
</P>
<P>
   The recommended minimum frame rate is 12 to 15 frames per
second. A rate of 30 is good, and 40 will give very smooth quality.
The maximum rate is usually possible for only the smallest picture
sizes on the computer. As the size of the picture goes up, the
frame speed goes down. For videoconferencing, however, the speed of
the connection rather than the speed of the camera is usually the
limiting factor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Some optional features to consider include shutter buttons,
microphones and the length of the cord. Shutter buttons allow the
user to snap pictures manually instead of having the software
solely in charge. Built-in microphones are not vital because
microphones and sound cards are often installed separately.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the ideal position for microphones is not the same
as the ideal position for cameras. Long cords give the user more
freedom in deciding where to place a Webcam. The Kodak DVC323, for
example, has a generous 10-foot cord.
</P>
<P>
   All Webcams come with basic photograph and video capturing
software. The more expensive models come with high-end photo
editing programs like Adobe Photodeluxe, a lower-end version of
Adobe's well-known Photoshop software.
</P>
<P>
   Webcams intended for a more sophisticated audience also include
videoconferencing software, like Microsoft's Netmeeting. Other
popular programs allow for automatic Web page updating and security
functions. Most software can be mixed and matched with different
cameras, and many shareware programs are also available for
downloading from the Web.
</P>
<P>
   Parents should be aware that the Net teleconferencing software
has opened up a new level of prank calls. ``The plain fact is that
there are people who are very into being exhibitionist,'' said Jim
Carlton, a senior brand manager for Creative Labs. ``Every once in
a while,'' he said, ``people call up to show me their private
bits.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For almost as long as students have been going off to college,
educators have been trying to bring college home to them. More than
100 years ago at Cornell University, professors traveled to rural
areas on horseback to teach farmers about the latest agricultural
research. Correspondence courses have been available for decades,
through the mail at first, and then through television and video.
</P>
<P>
   But the development of the Internet has created new excitement
around what has become known as distance learning. This summer a
startup company called UNext.Com, based in Deerfield, Ill.,
announced a venture that is one of the most ambitious yet:
delivering executive training and, eventually, a full M.B.A. over
the Internet. This summer, UNext.com christened its virtual school
Cardean University after the Roman goddess who could, ``open what
is shut, and shut what is open,'' in the words of a company press
release, quoting Ovid.
</P>
<P>
   The plan attracted attention not only because one of the initial
investors was former junk-bond king Michael Milken, but because of
the five prestigious institutions the company had brought on board
_ the University of Chicago, Columbia University, Carnegie Mellon
University, Stanford University, and the London School of Economics
and Political Science _ a veritable all-star team of elite
universities.
</P>
<P>
   According to the proposed plan, UNext.Com would produce, market,
and distribute the courses _ as well as hiring a corps of employees
to serve as mentors and e-mail correspondents for UNext.Com's
students. The universities would provide the curriculum and the
impressive credentials, without risking their endowments on untried
technology. Some of them have projected that they will earn at
least $20 million in royalties from UNext.Com within five to eight
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a way to embark on distance education by using what
others bring to it,'' said John Preis, associate dean for finance
and administration at Columbia University's School of Business.
``We think this is a home run.'' Distance learning, it seems, has
come of age.
</P>
<P>
   But has it? Since the dawn of the Web in the mid-1990s, the
concept of earning degrees entirely online has become a rallying
point for university presidents, politicians and profit-seekers
alike. Yet while millions of people are diving into online shopping
malls and chat rooms, virtual universities have been something of a
bust.
</P>
<P>
   Western Governors University, a venture started by 17 states and
Guam, opened its online doors to much fanfare last year but has
only enrolled 120 students, far below its projections. California
Virtual University, a project initiated by California Board of
Regents in 1997, folded this spring, citing financial problems.
Many other virtual university projects have appeared to be nothing
more than online catalogs of courses that can only be taken for
credit by students who are already on campus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's going to be the joke of the 21st century,'' said
Carole Fungaroli, a lecturer in English at Georgetown University
who is writing a book about the value of university degrees. ``I
don't see anything that these people are offering that you can't
get better on campus.''
</P>
<P>
   One place that the distance education concept has been
successful is Wall Street, where analysts' reports are thick with
data on the rapidly growing adult-student market. The Apollo Group,
the company that runs the University of Phoenix, an accredited
institution that offers online degrees, has seen its stock soar
more than 1,500 percent since 1994. Apollo, which also operates
other educational programs, now has a market capitalization of $1.7
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Administrators at the universities that have signed up with
UNext.com readily admit that the possibility of becoming part
owners of a publicly traded Internet company was a part of
UNext.Com's attraction. ``I was less interested in the income
stream than in the market capitalization of UNext.Com,'' Columbia
business school dean Meyer Feldberg told The Wall Street Journal.
``The huge upside essentially is the value of the equity in the
IPO.''
</P>
<P>
   There have been other concerns raised about UNext.com. The
management of the company is made up of several Chicago professors,
including John P. Gould, a former dean of the university's business
school, and two Nobel laureates, Gary Becker and Merton H. Miller.
Several other members of the Chicago faculty have publicly raised
questions about conflicts of interest. Whose interests will be
served, the company's or the institutions who need to protect their
good names and academic integrity?
</P>
<P>
   The entrepreneur behind UNext.com is Andrew Rosenfield, a
business consultant and University of Chicago alumnus who was
running Lexecon, a company that employed many of the same people
who are now involved in UNext.Com. Over the last decade, he has
also served as a part-time law professor and trustee for the
university, remaining immersed in the culture of an institution
known not only for breeding free-market intellectuals but also for
being strongly resistant to change.
</P>
<P>
   In the mid-1990s, Rosenfield started thinking about about
creating an Internet-based education company that would be both a
radical departure and a continuation of the values of his alma
mater. He wanted to create an online environment that would be
``the technological equivalent of the small break-out session or
the evening at the coffee shop, where students really teach each
other.'' He also wanted to reach students outside the United States
who want access to education delivered by American universities but
who cannot travel to get it.
</P>
<P>
   He mulled the idea over with Becker _ his former professor and
now longtime friend, who had won his Nobel prize for his theories
about human capital. The two brainstormed over lunch at the
University of Chicago's faculty club and while watching Chicago
Bulls games.
</P>
<P>
   The first investor for the company, which was founded in
December, 1997, was Knowledge Universe, a company owned in part by
Milken. His involvement stirred gossip throughout the
higher-education community last year, when Rosenfield started to
shop his idea around to select universities. By the time Rosenfield
has signed up his first partner _ Columbia University, in March
1999 _ the contracts included the condition that Milken's
investment would never exceed a 20 percent ownership stake and that
he would have no voting rights.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Over the last four months, four more universities signed on, the
last being Carnegie Mellon, which struck a deal in July. Other
universities, like Cornell, were approached by UNext.com to be
pioneering members but declined. Cornell has already developed its
own distance-education technology, said Jonathon Levy, executive
director of Cornell's distance-education office.
</P>
<P>
   Critics say that the partnership could damage the universities'
academic credibility. The quality associated with getting a degree
from these schools cannot be replicated on the Internet, said John
K. Wilson, an outspoken graduate student at the University of
Chicago who has written columns accusing administrators of jumping
in blindly with ``dollar signs in their eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   University administrators have responded vaguely to questions
about how much the deals may be worth. Preis, at Columbia
University, confirmed reports that his institution expects to make
at least $20 million in five to eight years. Other university
administrators said that they expected the same return.
</P>
<P>
   But UNext.com would not confirm the $20-million figure. ``That's
the universities' expectation,'' said Edwin Eisendrath, UNext.com's
spokesman. Eisendrath added that not every university signed the
same deal. He would not elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Within the faculties themselves, the reaction to the announced
deals has also ranged from approval to confusion. Administrators at
some of the participating schools have pleaded ignorance about
exactly what the deal means and who will be affected. At Chicago, a
committee was formed to talk about UNext.com before the deal was
struck, but at Columbia University most professors awoke to an
announcement of the deal without any prior consultation. In
Carnegie Mellon's case, a Chicago public-relations firm sent out an
announcement about the university's involvement before the
university's press office had a chance to see the release and fix
several errors in it.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, some professors are wondering what involvement with
UNext.com will mean to their scholarly reputations, the coin of the
realm in the academic world? Robert Connolly, a professor in the
business school at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill,
has worked with another distance-education company, called
University Access, to create several economics courses using the
Web and videotape. The experience, he said, has improved his
teaching skills but hurt his standing in his department.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't get people in my own school to talk to me about it,''
Connolly said. Colleagues who have been willing to acknowledge his
distance-education work expect that his research _ a professor's
ticket to tenure _ must be suffering, he said. ``They look at it
and say, `If you are spending time on that, that takes time away
from your research and publishing.'''
</P>
<P>
   The American Association of University Professors has also asked
questions about teaching quality. Last spring, when an online
university called Jones International University became the first
completely Internet-based school to gain accreditation, the
association wrote a letter of protest to the accrediting agency.
The letter cited ``major worries about the denigration of quality''
that could come with online education.
</P>
<P>
   Most distance-education courses are not cheap, either. In the
spring of 1998, a Baltimore based company called the Caliber
Learning Network has persuaded three universities _ the University
of Pennsylvania, Johns Hopkins University, and the University of
Southern California _ to join it in offering business courses via
satellite television and the Internet. Tuition is high: Students
who take the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton Direct program
pay $2,500 each for six-week courses.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the students can afford to attend, according to Alison
Pierce, Wharton Direct's director, because they are already in
upper-income brackets and the companies for which they work pick up
most of the tab.
</P>
<P>
   While UNext.com expects to benefit from companies'
tuition-reimbursement programs as well, it will offer lower tuition
prices, Rosenfield said. The company has not yet set its prices,
but the cost of an Internet-based education, he said, should not be
more than that of attending schools in person.
</P>
<P>
   Still, critics ask, what will a degree from Cardean University
be worth? Ms. Fungaroli has called such online programs ``a new
version of a trade school.''
</P>
<P>
   And students who enroll in M.B.A. programs from Stanford or the
University of Chicago, argued Wilson, are doing so to build
networks of contacts. ``There is a real question about whether the
`good-old boy's network,''' he said, ``can be created in the same
way it is created in elite business schools.''
</P>
<P>
   But IBM, UNext.Com's first customer, is willing to to give the
concept a try as a way to encourage their employees to learn
without losing them to on-campus business schools. The computer
company will offer its employees a course in finance this year. IBM
is also a partner in the UNext.Com venture; the courses are being
delivered through Lotus Learning Space, a piece of software
developed by Lotus, an IBM subsidiary.
</P>
<P>
   Rosenfield admits that UNext.com does not plan to offer a full
M.B.A. online for years. Until then, the company will focus on
executive training. UNext.Com is not being structured, Rosenfield
stressed, to attempt to compete with what universities are already
offering on campus.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Rosenfield himself thinks that on-campus education is
the best way to learn. ``Replication is probably too high a
standard,'' Rosenfield said. ``For people who have the ability to
attend facilities-based schools, we recommend it.'' But, he asked,
why not also attempt to create a worthwhile experience for people
who cannot attend those schools?
</P>
<P>
   ``They will not have direct interaction,'' he continued, ``but
what they will have is the wisdom of professors and pieces of their
knowledge that are captured and scalable. And they will have
supporting resources and mentors who are their guides.''
</P>
<P>
   So would Rosenfield take these courses? ``Absolutely,'' he said.
``The days when you ended your education at college, or graduate
school, are truly over.''

 By FELICIA R. LEE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ All the family photographs of the writer Connie
Briscoe recently displayed in the HarperCollins lobby in midtown
Manhattan burst with tales to be told. One in particular, though,
captured at once the complexity of her family, American history and
Ms. Briscoe's latest novel.
</P>
<P>
   The caption for the sepia-toned photograph of three young male
ancestors, whose mother was a slave, notes that as an adult one
disappeared for some years. The family believed that he was
``passing'' for white. He resurfaced in Boston years later, with a
white wife and two children.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Briscoe, who has sold over a million copies of her two
novels about the romantic travails of buppies, or black urban
professionals, has ventured into her past and into slavery for her
new book, ``A Long Way From Home,'' released last month. It is the
story of two of Ms. Briscoe's ancestors, Susan and Ellen, who were
born as slaves on the Montpelier, Va., plantation of President
James Madison. It was Susan's son Oliver Jr. who ostensibly decided
to take advantage of his white ancestry.
</P>
<P>
   Both Susan, Ms. Briscoe's great-great-grandmother, and Susan's
sister, Ellen, were light enough in color to appear to be white. As
a child, Ms. Briscoe recalled looking at their photographs and
asking her family why they looked white and wondering what their
lives were like. As an adult, Ms. Briscoe began researching her
ancestry and filled the rest in with fiction.
</P>
<P>
   What results is a book that Ms. Briscoe counts as her first with
wide appeal beyond her core readers, black women, who put ``Sisters
and Lovers'' and ``Big Girls Don't Cry'' on best-seller lists. Like
those two novels, the new book is more in the category of popular
commercial fiction, rather than literary fiction.
</P>
<P>
   Now, Ms. Briscoe said, white readers come to her book readings
and ask about the dual racial heritage of many black families as
well as some of their own presumably white ones. On the West Coast
some of her audiences have been predominantly white. At the same
time, she said, her faithful fans of the stories of the lives and
loves of the black middle class have thanked her for telling ``our
story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``As I did the book tour, I met many black women who had the
same experience,'' Ms. Briscoe said. ``It's a side of slavery and
that era we don't talk about, but it's an open secret. There are a
lot of us walking around who don't know who our great-grandfather
was or hear stories about white ancestors.''
</P>
<P>
   While the news releases put out by HarperCollins describe Ms.
Briscoe as ``the descendant of the slaves on the Madison family
plantation,'' her novel leaves hints rather than giving direct
answers about the paternity of Susan and Ellen. Ms. Briscoe never
answered the question herself, after wading through her old family
Bibles, letters, photographs and documents in various libraries and
archives. Many records were lost, destroyed or simply badly kept.
It was common for slaves not to know their birth date or even the
names of both parents.
</P>
<P>
   Family lore has it, though, that Susan and Ellen's father was a
white plantation master. In the novel he buys his own enslaved
daughter to be a nursemaid to the children of his ``legitimate''
white daughter. In the novel, as in real life, Susan's husband,
Oliver Armistead, was negotiating her freedom with her putative
father when the Civil War erupted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Often, when a slave had a white father, they kept it hidden
from the white family to protect the child,'' said Ms. Briscoe, who
did extensive research of the plight of female slaves.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up hearing that Susan and Ellen's father was the master
of the plantation,'' Ms. Briscoe said. ``It was never said James
Madison was the father but that it was the master, and that he
would come into the room at night and give the children a penny.
All I knew was that Susan was sold between the ages of 12 and 14 to
be a nursemaid. And she was bought by her father.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A Long Way From Home'' opens in the 1830s. The story is
initially told through the eyes of Clara, a 10-year-old house
slave. As a young woman she becomes pregnant but refuses to reveals
the identify of the child's father, who is white. She has two
children: Ellen and then Susan. The girls wonder who their father
is and why their mother refuses to talk about him. They know only
that he is ``a real important white man from Richmond.''
</P>
<P>
   When plans are made to sell Ellen off the plantation, her family
hides her. Instead of Ellen, the plantation owners sell Susan, who
is torn from the arms of her wailing mother. When Susan arrives at
the home of Willard Montgomery, or Mass Willard, her new master in
Richmond, she recognizes him as the man who gave her and her sister
a penny every night as children. She wonders if he is her father.
She continues to wonder, even as the Civil War breaks out. She
marries and dreams of being reunited with her sister and mother.

</P>
<P>
   As the fortunes of the South crumble and Susan prepares to flee
Richmond with her new husband (moments before, the white family had
tried to persuade her to stay), Mass Willard hands her a velvet
sack of coins.
</P>
<P>
   ``But just like back then, he wasn't prepared to give her what
he'd denied her all these years, what she wanted most. An identity.
A real family. So she wanted nothing else from him.''
</P>
<P>
   The topic of so-called miscegenation has been in the news lately
because of the DNA tests indicating that Thomas Jefferson probably
fathered at least one child with Sally Hemings, a woman he owned.
The efforts of the black branch of the Jefferson family to be
recognized have also made headlines and generated lively debates
about identity and the inherent contradictions of slavery in a
nation whose founders spoke so eloquently of personal freedom as
the cornerstone of the new republic.
</P>
<P>
   James Madison, the fourth President, was a slave owner and
master of a 2,700-acre Virginia plantation. He was also the chief
proponent of the federal bill of rights. He and his wife, Dolley,
had no children.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago at the invitation of the staff at the Montpelier
estate, Ms. Briscoe visited and gave a talk about her research for
the novel. She said she met other descendants of Madison slaves.
When it comes to the white Madisons, ``I feel no sense of kinship
or entitlement,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Briscoe, 46, who lives in Virginia and grew up in
Washington, is thin and sandy-haired. She wears a diamond
engagement ring, given to her by a man she met on the Internet. She
says she spends no time feeling sorry for herself or other black
people and says that awareness of the wrenching abuses that black
people historically endured can put steel in the spine of
African-Americans today.
</P>
<P>
   She herself is an example of graciousness meeting adversity. Ms.
Briscoe was born with a mild hearing loss resulting from a genetic
abnormality, but in her late 20s she went from a 20 percent hearing
loss to an 80 percent loss. She can read lips and uses a
sign-language interpreter. She also speaks, although her diction is
somewhat muffled.
</P>
<P>
   ``I went through a rather difficult period,'' she said of her
hearing loss. ``I was going through a divorce, too.'' The hearing
loss took place over several months.
</P>
<P>
   ``First, you can't hear things on the phone,'' she said. ``Then
you can't hear it ring. You make excuses for what's happening. Then
you get to the point you can't ignore it anymore. I went though the
period of the doctors, the emotional adjustment, but I'm lucky I
have a supportive family.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I was brought up to think that you don't let things hold you
back,'' Ms. Briscoe said. ``My parents never allowed me to think I
was handicapped or this was an excuse so I couldn't do all the
things I dreamed of doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Briscoe found her own measure of freedom in 1994 when she
left a job as managing editor of The American Annals of the Deaf at
Gallaudet University to pursue a writing career. She uses index
cards and character sketches to develop her main characters. It was
a challenge, she said, to write a novel about slavery that would
appeal to her contemporary readers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By not looking into our history and our past in a realistic
way, we are depriving our young people,'' Ms. Briscoe said. ``We
are too accepting of the history of ourselves that has been handed
down and written about.''

A LONG-AGO CELEBRITY GRABS THE LOS ANGELES SPOTLIGHT ONCE MORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID MERMELSTEIN   c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ She sits on a rustic throne like Britannia
herself, clothed in a richly embroidered gown, with an enormous
pearl necklace around her swan's neck. In striking half-profile
this imposing figure stares upward as if transported to some
far-off world. The woman is Sarah Siddons (1755-1831), the English
tragedienne, and the view is that of Sir Joshua Reynolds, in his
painting ``Sarah Siddons as the Tragic Muse'' (1784).
</P>
<P>
   The portrait, arguably Reynolds' finest, normally hangs at the
Huntington Art Collections in San Marino, a Los Angeles suburb. But
until Sept. 19 it can be viewed some 25 miles from its home, at the
J. Paul Getty Museum in the Brentwood section of Los Angeles. The
painting is the centerpiece of a small exhibit, ``A Passion for
Performance: Sarah Siddons and Her Portraitists.''
</P>
<P>
   The show, which features 10 works in oil by esteemed artists
like Thomas Lawrence, George Romney, Gilbert Stuart and Thomas
Gainsborough, examines the nature of 18th-century fame through the
prism of the current era's infatuation with celebrity. Though
Siddons was primarily a subject of fascination for British
audiences, she also enjoyed renown in America.
</P>
<P>
   Few outside academic circles recognize Siddons today. If she is
known at all, aside from her portraits, it is because of the film
``All About Eve,'' in which the characters played by Bette Davis
and Anne Baxter vie for a fictitious Sarah Siddons Award. Yet the
real Sarah Siddons was an actress of legendary talent and
following. An unconventional beauty acclaimed for her portrayal of
Lady Macbeth (she was also a sensation in such now-neglected works
of her day as ``The Tragedy of Isabella'' and ``The Tragedy of Jane
Shore''), Siddons possessed the most famous profile of any actor
until perhaps John Barrymore.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 18th century actors were the most celebrated figures
after royalty,'' said Robyn Asleson, a research associate for
British art at the Huntington and the curator of ``A Passion for
Performance.''
</P>
<P>
   Siddons reveled in that celebrity, and she took it to new
heights, paving the way for actors like Henry Irving and Sarah
Bernhardt in the 19th century and Ralph Richardson, John Gielgud
and Laurence Olivier in the 20th. Hollywood, too, owes Siddons a
great debt. ``She certainly pioneered the whole notion of a star
culture for women,'' said Ms. Asleson.
</P>
<P>
   It is in that spirit that the Getty exhibition and a companion
show at the Huntington, ``Cultivating Celebrity: Portraiture as
Publicity in the Career of Sarah Siddons,'' have been assembled.
The Huntington exhibition, which Ms. Asleson also supervised,
comprises a host of smaller portraits and ephemera related to the
actress and closes on the same day as the Getty show.
</P>
<P>
   ``She was famous so young that practically every scrap of paper
she ever touched has been preserved,'' said Ms. Asleson, noting
that hundreds of Siddons relics survive.
</P>
<P>
   The Huntington show features only a selection of the cache, but
among the etchings and chalk drawings on display are watercolor
caricatures mocking her elaborate costumes, wax heads of Siddons
and her brother, the actor John Philip Kemble, and a battered
manuscript copy of Thomas Campbell's ``De Montfort: A Tragedy''
filled with Siddons' editorial comments. In a nod to the present
the show also includes a movie prop that once belonged to Bette
Davis, her Sarah Siddons award from ``All About Eve,'' inscribed to
``Miss Margo Channing.''
</P>
<P>
   A chance encounter at the Dulwich Picture Gallery in London in
1995 inspired these shows. Mark Leonard, the conservator of
paintings at the Getty, was visiting the gallery when he glimpsed a
well-known copy, credited to Reynolds, of the famous Siddons
portrait. The Dulwich painting, which dates from 1789, seemed an
ideal candidate for restoration, and so discussions began about
flying it to California, where it would be cleaned and compared
with its inspiration, the Huntington's ``Sarah Siddons as the
Tragic Muse.''
</P>
<P>
   The Getty does not charge for restoration but reserves the right
to display works for six months after the conservation effort.
Leonard said he felt that placing the Dulwich copy of the Reynolds
portrait alongside the Huntington painting could prove the basis
for a show. After all, the paintings had not been in the same room
for more than 200 years. He asked Shelley Bennett, the Huntington's
curator of British and European art, if she would sanction such a
show, and she agreed, releasing Reynolds' portrait from the
Huntington for the first time since its acquisition in 1921.
</P>
<P>
   Both the Dulwich and Huntington portraits were X-rayed as part
of the Getty's study and restoration process. The X-rays revealed
that the Dulwich picture was not painted by Reynolds but rather by
an unidentified studio assistant. By contrast the Huntington's
painting was confirmed to be entirely Reynolds' work, an unexpected
finding given that artists of his stature frequently delegated some
details to underlings.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was a big surprise,'' said Ms. Asleson. ``Up until that
point, we didn't know how we would handle this aspect of the
exhibit, because we didn't know what the study would turn up.''
</P>
<P>
   But more than questions of provenance were illuminated by the
X-rays. They demonstrated that the striking composition and elegant
sense of proportion in Reynolds' portrait (and the inferior Dulwich
copy) were not achieved effortlessly. The X-rays proved that
Reynolds made several substantial changes to his canvas before
pronouncing it completed.
</P>
<P>
   Leonard said a putto, or cherub, once knelt at Siddons' feet,
and her dress, now brownish-gold, was originally blue. More
significant, one of the shadowy allegorical figures that flank
Siddons was different. In the finished painting, she is framed by
Pity on her right and Terror on her left, a nod to Aristotle's
conception of tragedy. But Terror, as the X-rays show, replaced
Melancholy, a kind of Hamlet-like figure with chin resting on fist.
Photographs of the X-rays are displayed at the entrance to the
Getty's Siddons exhibition. In an effort to surpass traditional
expectations for museum exhibitions, the Getty also commissioned a
play, hoping it would shed light Siddons' career and her continuing
impact on the theater. ``The Affliction of Glory: A Comedy About
Tragedy,'' by Frank Dwyer, was produced in association with the
Mark Taper Forum and runs at the Getty through Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The idea for an accompanying play was Leonard's. Dwyer, whose
play jumps through time to mix modern fictional characters with
18th-century figures like Siddons, Reynolds and George III, said,
``I found myself challenged writing about a woman who made men weep
and women hysterical.''
</P>
<P>
   A relentless self-promoter who took up sculpture because she was
so dissatisfied with the plaster busts made in her image, Siddons
would undoubtedly applaud the tributes at the Getty and Huntington.
And how could she not? At these exhibits, and in Dwyer's play, she
is a star once more.

GOT THE EXPRESSWAY BLUES? GO SOUTH, YOUNG GARDENER 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MARTHA BAKER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Come the weekend, when half of Manhattan is packing
shorts and cell phones for a mass migration to the beach, two of
its number are making a beeline for the South.
</P>
<P>
   About an hour's plane ride later (even as others, sustained by a
kind of grim fatalism, are still inching along the Long Island
Expressway), these same two are already enjoying the amenities of
their weekend retreat in Richmond, Va.
</P>
<P>
   But for Garren, of the Garren New York hair salon at Henri
Bendel, and a fellow Bendel's hair stylist, Thom Priano, time and
traffic weren't the sole reasons for making Richmond their getaway
of choice.
</P>
<P>
   While visiting friends there in 1980, they were charmed by the
leisurely pace, the old plantations along the James River and the
city's obvious reverence for the past. (In Richmond, history is
taken seriously, as the Confederate memorials lining Monument
Avenue reflect.)
</P>
<P>
   The ultimate lure, however, was a house they had seen on that
initial trip: a property so impressive that in 1990, when it
finally came on the market, they snapped it up in a New York
nanosecond.
</P>
<P>
   No prizes for guessing why. Located in a 300-acre enclave of
trees and lakes known as Byrd Park, the Mediterranean-style villa
sits on Mansion Row, the park's only residential block, alongside
similar European-inspired estates developed there in the 1920s and
'30s.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in our own little world here, walled in, away from
everything,'' Garren said. ``It's so solitary, it's like
floating.'' For two men whose talents are in constant demand by
salon patrons and magazine editors (Priano is also overseeing the
development of a line of hair-care products that will be sold at
the Garren New York salon this fall), solitude is an alluring
prospect at the end of a workweek.
</P>
<P>
   And the price was right. Ten years ago, Mansion Row was in a
state of genteel dilapidation. Garren and Priano, who wouldn't
divulge the price of the property, figure that the renovations on
their garden were paid for by what they saved on the house, had
they settled in, say, the Hamptons or Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   The house was built in 1934 for Webster Rhodes, an owner of the
Miller &AMP; Rhodes department stores. After several years in
residence, Rhodes married and traded his Mediterranean bachelor
digs for more traditional Virginia brick, and other owners
succeeded him. By the time Garren and Priano bought the house, it
was more than a half-century old, and restorative measures had
become imperative.
</P>
<P>
   First on their to-do list was the badly needed repair of the
stucco walls that had been damaged by tenacious blankets of ivy.
Then came a bit of remodeling, including the striking conversion of
a dark, screened-in back porch into an airy loggia with
ceiling-high glass doors that open onto the terrace.
</P>
<P>
   Conveniently located near the kitchen, the loggia and terrace
were to be living room and focal point for outdoor entertaining,
which, given the Virginia climate, can extend all the way from
early March to late December. But the garden it overlooked _ in
fact, the entire property _ was such a jungle of bamboo plants and
other rampant growth that even the swimming pool was hidden from
sight.
</P>
<P>
   Although the identity of the garden's original designer isn't
entirely certain, strong evidence points to the landscape architect
Charles Gillette, famed for his classic Virginia gardens.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, Gillette is known to have been a friend of
Webster Rhodes; for another, the garden's distinctive formal style,
complete with pool, parterre and pergola, is typical of Gillette's
work in the region. So, five years ago, when the new owners hired
Doug Wood, a Richmond-based landscape designer, to return their
garden to its former glory, Charles Gillette was the inspiration
for his design.
</P>
<P>
   After the jungle was conquered and the pool repaired, the real
landscaping began. Part of the restoration involved accommodating
original plantings, like the 70-year-old beech tree that rises from
a mossy bed on the front lawn. To prevent the moss from browning in
winter, Wood devised a special sprinkler system to keep it
constantly watered.
</P>
<P>
   Wood also introduced new plants to complement the old ones. He
mixed traditional Southern-zone favorites (Cornus florida dogwoods,
magnolias and cypress) with a selection of northern varieties,
which, with some exceptions (lilacs, for example), do very well in
this temperate climate. What resulted were three separate gardens,
lovely enough to have pleased the great Gillette himself.
</P>
<P>
   Lying in direct view of the loggia and terrace is the pool
garden, which consists of a formal parterre with corner beds of
white impatiens, the pool area itself and, at the far end, a stucco
pergola, its roof thick with wisteria vines.
</P>
<P>
   Framed by paths of herringbone brick, the garden has walls of
towering azaleas: giant-flowered, free-form varieties like the pink
George Tabor and white Gigi Gerbing. Fragrant gardenias thrive
here, too, as do puffy hydrangeas, spiraling topiaries of juniper,
and crape myrtle shrubs that explode in a burst of coral blossoms
throughout July and August.
</P>
<P>
   To the left of the pool garden is the fountain garden, so named
to mark a pedimented wall fountain that was discovered only after
runaway growth was cleared. Now, it's the focus for a green garden
of impeccably mounded boxwood spheres, Southern magnolias (an
evergreen variety) and espaliered pear trees. In one inviting spot,
there is a teakwood bench, weathered to a warm coppery bronze,
shaded by a stand of tall paper mulberry trees.
</P>
<P>
   At the right of the center garden, there's a flagstone path with
a border of showy Casablanca lilies, zinnias and black-eyed Susans;
this is the cutting garden. In this case, though, the term is
purely a formality: the flowers are almost never cut.
</P>
<P>
   When the men need centerpieces for their dining tables, as they
often do for the lunches and dinners Priano is famous for, they
usually choose from the many varieties of orchids that flourish in
the nurturing light of the loggia.
</P>
<P>
   These days, it takes a full-time gardener to keep the property
in pristine shape, and with a climate as generally gentle as
Virginia's, full time means year round. Of course, even Virginia
can't escape winter entirely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have so many ice storms that we have to wrap the cypresses
and the topiaries in burlap,'' Garren said. ``It looks wonderfully
weird, like the movie `Orlando.'''

AT HOME WITH ESTHER WILLIAMS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Argentina)   By TODD S. PURDUM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEVERLY HILLS, Calif. _ On the spreading terrace of the hilltop
house, there's a pretty blue pool and an Esther Williams-brand
whirlpool spa. There's a panoramic view to the Pacific Ocean and a
custom-made Esther Williams kick board propped on the lawn. There's
Perry Como, on an unseen stereo, singing ``Fly Me to the Moon,''
and Judy Garland insisting, ``I've Got a Right to Sing the Blues.''
</P>
<P>
   But nothing quite prepares a visitor for the sight of Esther
Williams herself, in short white shorts, black flats, black tube
top and white cotton blouse adorned with a rhinestone-speckled
applique of a top hat and gloves on the front. She emerges from the
shade of her living room in full-body makeup, legs firm and posture
perfect, smiling that 1,000-watt waterproof smile, and asks
politely, ``Would you like to take a swim?''
</P>
<P>
   The offer is tempting, but there are no trunks and the task at
hand is talk. The topic is Miss Williams' new memoir, ``The Million
Dollar Mermaid'' (Simon &AMP; Schuster), a ribald account of her years
as MGM's aquatic sensation, the godmother of synchronized swimming
and one of the top 10 box office stars in the world. The book,
which she wrote with Digby Diehl, chronicles her journey from
genteel poverty in southwest Los Angeles through amateur swimming
championships in the late 1930s, four marriages, failed romances,
lecherous co-stars, sadistic directors, broken eardrums, fractured
vertebrae, family tragedies and a movie career that ended nearly 40
years ago, a victim of changing tastes and times.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the book's most explosive story is its account of how
Jeff Chandler, the silver-haired macho star with whom Miss Williams
had a passionate affair in the late 1950s and who died in 1961, had
a secret life as a cross-dresser. Miss Williams writes that after
discovering her lover in makeup and flowered chiffon, she first
declared, ``You look like Betsy Bloomingdale,'' then broke off the
romance with this parting shot: ``Jeff, you're too big for polka
dots.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't ever talked about any of this,'' Miss Williams says,
by way of explaining why now, at 76, she decided to disgorge a
flood of secrets, many of which are still too salacious to be more
than swiftly summarized in this newspaper. The Chandler story drew
a scolding from the gossip columnist Liz Smith as unseemly, and
Miss Williams says she ``gave a lot of thought'' before deciding to
tell it and other tales from a long-vanished time.
</P>
<P>
   But for all her memoir's confessional mode, and for all her
relaxed, unpretentious manner, she remains every inch the studio
star that MGM made her, capable of deflecting any question with a
friendly anecdotal filibuster. Eventually, it emerges that she
first considered this autobiographical exercise 15 years ago, as a
television movie.
</P>
<P>
   Her third husband, Fernando Lamas, the Latin lover who inspired
Billy Crystal's ``You look mahvelous!'' routine, had just died
after a relationship of more than 20 years in which, she writes, he
had controlled her every move, forced her to choose between him and
her three children from a previous marriage and expected her to
wait on him hand and foot. She planned to end the movie with his
death.
</P>
<P>
   Then she got a telephone call from Edward Bell, a former French
literature professor and sometime actor 10 years her junior, who
was helping arrange some events for the 1984 Olympics in Los
Angeles. He reminded her that her life was far from over, and he
was right, because he became her fourth husband and now the two say
they hope the book's publication might finally prompt that
television movie after all.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother once said to me, `There's something that should be
on a needlepoint frame in your house: ``Every age has its
compensations,'' ''' Miss Williams says. `` `You may get older, but
you'll know more.' And I guess I didn't have the view from the
bridge. Fernando had to stop being so in control of my life. I
couldn't have written this book with him alive. He'd've had to see
every page and OK it. I think it's so funny when people think they
can't control a movie star. They can. We're just women, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Williams' life story is a tale of the tug of war between a
resilient, resourceful woman and the men she says managed to
exploit her. There was the foster brother who repeatedly raped her
when she was a teen-ager, and the MGM moguls who plucked her from
the Aquacade at the 1940 World's Fair in San Francisco to make her
a swimming version of the skating movie star, Sonja Henie. There
was the first husband, a medical student who left her when she
decided to pursue a film career, and the second, a hard drinker who
lost millions of dollars of her earnings through bad investments
and gambling. She found great passion with Fernando Lamas, her
Argentine co-star in ``Dangerous When Wet,'' but says he was so
jealous that he tore out any page of her scrapbooks that contained
pictures of her children and refused to let them live with her,
though she took in his son, Lorenzo, by the actress Arlene Dahl.
</P>
<P>
   Just why Miss Williams had so much hard luck with men is
difficult to fathom. In the book, she explains how her mother, a
teacher who later became a psychologist, had not wanted a fifth
child and tried to induce a miscarriage while pregnant with Esther.
But in the book, and in a two-hour conversation, she raises these
presumably traumatic details only to dismiss them with rueful
asides like, ``Four would have been enough for me, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've thought a lot about that, because writing a book is like
therapy,'' Miss Williams says of her man trouble. ``And of course I
had that wonderful mother who, when I was just 5 years old coming
home from kindergarten, would say: `I wonder why it is people hit
you in the nose, Esther. What part of the problem are you?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll bet if I compare notes with Junie Allyson and Debbie
Reynolds and anyone else who's had more than one marriage, the fact
is that you fall in love and it's so wonderful to think about
something other than yourself and whether the script's right for
you and who's going to be your leading man, that you don't really
ask yourself questions about the fellow. He's just wonderful
looking and he dances well and you have a wonderful time and it's
fun to go out and all of a sudden you're in a lifelong marriage.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Miss Williams tried therapy, but says she gave up when two
successive psychiatrists sat gaga before a movie star. In 1959, her
career at a seeming end and her second marriage over, she did try
LSD under the direction of Cary Grant's psychiatrist, and had a
hallucinatory experience in which she envisioned herself in the
body of her older brother Stanton, a child movie actor who had died
years earlier as a teen-ager. She begins her book with an account
of the trip.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was like solving a mystery,'' she says quietly now. ``I
realized that my mother and father had not filled in the blanks,''
in their lives, ``and the reason was that it was because it was
such a shock to live without that wonderful boy. So I became that
boy. Cary told me LSD was like instant psychiatry, and I was sorry
the kids got ahold of it and made it a recreational drug, but I
think it needed to be clinical for a long time, tested and
tested.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Williams herself was repeatedly tested. She arrived at MGM
self-conscious enough about her abilities to demand a clause in her
contract stipulating that she could not be forced to appear in a
movie for at least nine months. ``I told them when I went to MGM, I
don't sing, I don't dance, and I've got to learn to act,'' she
says. ``So they immediately started me singing.''
</P>
<P>
   In ``Neptune's Daughter,'' with Ricardo Montalban, she was
supposed to sing Frank Loesser's ``I'd Love to Get You (On a Slow
Boat to China)'' but the MGM censors decided that ``get'' meant
``have'' and banned the song. ``So then I went to Frank, and said,
`Have you got anything else?''' The result was ``Baby, It's Cold
Outside,'' which went on to win the Academy Award as best song of
1949.
</P>
<P>
   The hoity-toity of Hollywood, including Gene Kelly, loved to
poke fun at Miss Williams, and one MGM veteran from those years
recently recalled that studio wags used to describe her acting by
striking the sides of their heads with their hands, as if to shake
water out of their ears. But because her movies were wildly
popular, the studio seldom gave her a chance to stretch her water
wings. Even her most talented colleagues were awed by her grace and
skill in the pool.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once my front doorbell rang when I lived in Mandeville Canyon
and it was Danny Kaye and he's standing in my doorway with his
daughter, Dena,'' she recalls. ``I'd never met him. And he said, `I
want you to give my daughter a swimming lesson.' And I said, `If
she'd showed an interest in piano, would you go to Arthur
Rubinstein or Horowitz?' He said, `Yes, I would,' without any
hesitation, so I gave Dena her first swimming lesson. Happened
again with Candy Bergen and her Chloe.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Williams' relationships with her own children were not
always so buoyant. She writes with some guilt of shuttling ``the
only station wagon in Bel Air that smelled of gravy'' between her
house and her former husband's in Santa Monica, taking her children
meals and then returning to Fernando Lamas.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mom was always there within touching distance, but she was
very busy and Fernando was very difficult,'' says her daughter,
Susan, who grew up mostly living with an aunt and her father and is
now an administrator at a nonprofit counseling center in the San
Francisco area. ``We used to meet in grocery store parking lots and
talk. Fernando wouldn't let us come to the house. Once I got older
and was able to confront him and ask him why he did that, he was
very clear: we were the evidence that my mother had slept with
another man.''
</P>
<P>
   The first Christmas after Fernando's death from pancreatic
cancer, Miss Williams tearfully apologized to her children and
promised to try to make up for lost time. She says they are now
close, and her daughter says that ``we've found a relationship
that's so precious to both of us, and because of what we've been
through it feels invulnerable,'' though she says it was still a bit
of a shock to read in the book of her mother's affair with Victor
Mature, her hunky co-star in ``Million Dollar Mermaid.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Williams says she now also has far more time to keep up
with old pals in the ``big club'' than she ever did when they were
all working. She loves to visit with June Allyson and Ann Miller,
whom she drove to James Stewart's funeral two years ago, getting a
traffic ticket on the way.
</P>
<P>
   Though the Turner Classic Movies channel on cable television has
helped her movies reach a new generation (the channel plans a
daylong Williams festival on Sept. 15), these days, Miss Williams'
bread and butter is business: licensing arrangements for
above-ground swimming pools and a line of swimsuits for mature
women, based on some of her classic costumes and sold at department
stores like Nordstrom and Dayton Hudson.
</P>
<P>
   ``Women worldwide are fighting a thing called gravity,'' says
Miss Williams, who still swims every day in her backyard pool and
writes that she had a face lift before appearing as a commentator
at the 1984 Olympics. ``I say to women when I talk to them, `You
girls of 18 have until about 25, 30 at the most, and then you have
to report to me.' My suits are quality fabric.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know,'' the old star says bluntly. ``It just seems so
crazy to have a bra made out of a piece of cotton that could double
as a napkin on the table. And the thongs! God, we've spent our
lives trying to keep our underwear out of that spot, and all of a
sudden they want to put a fish line there? I have very definite
ideas about what a swimsuit should be: it should be swimmable.''

<P>
   Gales will persist along the Middle Atlantic Coast from Virginia
to North Carolina as the circulation associated with Dennis
continues to draw large quantities of moisture toward the
shoreline. Squalls will move inland across southeast Virginia and
eastern North Carolina. The center of lowest pressure will drift
close to the Outer Banks.
</P>
<P>
   As the storm unwinds like a tight spring, high and middle clouds
will spread farther away from it, reaching from southern Long
Island to the central Appalachians. Showers will slowly spread into
North Carolina during the next 24 hours.
</P>
<P>
   A long ridge of high pressure stretching from southern New
England west to the Great Lakes and south to the Tennessee Valley
will promote dry, but increasingly warm weather. Sunshine will
dominate and after a comfortably cool morning, readings will rise
to above seasonal levels in many sections.
</P>
<P>
   The combination of an upper level disturbance and a tropical
wave in the Gulf of Mexico will bring thickening clouds and some
thundershowers from Louisiana to southwest Missouri. A wedge of
hot, sticky air will occupy the western Plains under sunny skies.
</P>
<P>
   Very cool air will surge into the northwest Plains and Montana
ahead of strengthening low pressure system. Thick clouds and rain
will dampen much of the region. Thunderstorms will erupt over the
central and eastern Rockies ahead of a slow-moving cold front.
Cooler weather will cover the Northwest while onshore winds bring
marine air into southern California with low clouds near the coast.
</P>
<P>
   FOCUS: DEATH KNELL
</P>
<P>
   Like a dagger to the heart, a wedge of cool, dry air circulated
from the Middle Atlantic States into the center of what was
Hurricane Dennis on Wednesday. The chill was able to stymie the
development of new thunderstorms around the center of the storm
system, virtually eliminating the source of its energy. Record cool
temperatures were recorded on Wednesday morning from West Virginia
to northern Florida. Myrtle Beach, S.C., which had been soaked on
Monday as Hurricane Dennis approached, tied a record with a minimum
of 61 degrees.

EXERCISE SMART, BECAUSE, BABY, IT'S HOT OUTSIDE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Late summer, when the sun is burning a sizzling 100-degree
trail, is no time to take up jogging or biking in North Texas _ or
Southern California.
</P>
<P>
   Comic actor Martin Lawrence, 34, was in a coma for three days
and on a ventilator for most of a week after collapsing while
jogging in heavy clothing, in 100-degree heat, near Thousand Oaks,
Calif. He was reportedly trying to loose weight for a movie role.
</P>
<P>
   He is lucky to be alive.
</P>
<P>
   Most likely, Lawrence suffered heatstroke _ a life-and-death
emergency that sends body temperature soaring and causes confusion,
amnesia, loss of balance, incoherent speech, dizziness, delirium,
convulsions and unconsciousness.
</P>
<P>
   Heatstroke kills approximately 4,000 Americans each year, says
Steve Farrell,
</P>
<P>
   an exercise physiologist and associate director of the Cooper
Institute for Aerobics Research in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's temperature was 107 degrees when he reached Los
Robles Regional Medical Center, a hospital spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When your temperature gets that high, a protein in the blood
begins to boil. It causes organ failure _ usually the kidneys or
liver first, then you go on from there. It can severely damage
vital organs,'' Farrell says.
</P>
<P>
   He is not encouraging anyone to give up exercise in the heat of
summer. Just use common sense.
</P>
<P>
   That means wearing light clothing, drinking plenty of fluids,
planning shorter, less intense early-morning or late-evening
workouts, and never, ever putting on one of those dark rubber suits
designed to help you sweat off pounds more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen people exercising in the heat with those stupid
black plastic or rubber suits,'' Farrell says. ``Their sweat can't
evaporate. They are cooking in their own juices. It increases the
risk of heatstroke by about 100 times. They are just asking for a
heatstroke.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``sweat suits,'' sold in sporting-goods stores, have become
popular with high-school and college wrestlers and boxers who need
to shed a couple of pounds overnight to compete in a particular
weight category.
</P>
<P>
   But Farrell says he's seen people walking, jogging and riding
bikes in the suits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see it a lot, but I am amazed to see it at all,''
Farrell says. ``Mostly you see overweight people trying to lose
weight quickly. When you lose the weight, it's water weight. You
put it right back on when you replace fluids. You need to think
about loss of fat, not water.''
</P>
<P>
   What about athletes in training? Farrell says that with the
right precautions, they should be OK and notes that highly
conditioned people tend to tolerate hot weather better than those
who are untrained.
</P>
<P>
   Farrell also says that a higher awareness among coaches of the
risks of heatstroke has led to improved conditions for high-school
and college football players struggling through ``two-a-day''
practices as they prepare to kick off the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Death is much less common among high-school football
players,'' Farrell says. ``They used to not let them have any
fluids during workouts and give them salt tablets. Now they push
fluids and are very aware of warning signs of heat injury,
especially nausea and muscle cramping,''
</P>
<P>
   As for the rest of us?
</P>
<P>
   The American Council on Science and Health warns that heat poses
a particular threat to the very old; the very young; people
susceptible to heart and vascular disease, diabetes or other
chronic illnesses; alcoholics; and drug abusers.
</P>
<P>
   Fitness experts say most people can exercise safely in hot
weather if they modify normal workouts, following common-sense
guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   For example, if you are a beginning exerciser and not very fit,
running is not a good choice, especially in the summer. It's too
strenuous. If you are highly fit, you can run _ even in the summer,
but you should stick to the recommendations: early morning or late
evening, white clothes, plenty of fluids and shorter runs.
</P>
<P>
   The key for everyone _ including those determined to shed pounds
quickly _ is to stick with moderate, not extreme, workouts in
loose, light clothing. ``Back in the '70s, we thought exercise had
to be vigorous and painful,'' Farrell says. ``Studies today all
point to moderate exercise being the most beneficial for most
people.''
</P>
<P>
   GUIDELINES FOR HOT-WEATHER TRAINING
</P>
<P>
   If you are going to train in the heat, it's a good idea to have
attained a high level of fitness.
</P>
<P>
   Acclimatization to heat takes approximately 10 to 14 days.
</P>
<P>
   Don't expect peak performance during hot weather. (The heart
works harder to shunt some blood to the skin, and less is delivered
to the working muscles.)
</P>
<P>
   Don't take salt tablets unless a physician prescribes them.
</P>
<P>
   Clothing should be loose and absorbent, and light-colored to
reflect heat. Don't wear black. Don't layer on the clothes to sweat
more in the hope of losing weight.
</P>
<P>
   Drink before, during and after exercise, every 10 to 15 minutes.
Electrolyte replacement (sports drinks) are unnecessary for
short-term exercise sessions, but should be used during long-term
exercise when profuse sweating occurs. Over a longer time, you are
not losing just water, but also electrolytes. Salt needs to be put
back in the body, but not with salt tablets.
</P>
<P>
   Beware of sunburn.
</P>
<P>
   Avoid rubber or plastic suits at all times.
</P>
<P>
   Consider temperature and humidity. Humid air prevents the
evaporation of sweat.
</P>
<P>
   Do not use oil-based sunscreen or suntan oil. It can interfere
with normal sweating.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   HOW THE BODY DEALS WITH HEAT
</P>
<P>
   It takes 10 to 14 days of exercise in the heat to acclimatize
fully. With acclimatization:
</P>
<P>
   Sweating rate increases.
</P>
<P>
   Sweating begins earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Sweating becomes better distributed over the entire body.
</P>
<P>
   Sweat becomes hypotonic (less salty).
</P>
<P>
   Blood plasma volume increases.

ALL HAIL TO CAPTAIN BEEFHEART
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   From Cher's ``Believe'' to Carlos Santana having a Top 10 CD and
being appreciated by a whole new generation of rockers and
hip-hoppers to Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band being the
hot tour of the summer, 1999 has seen some amazing comebacks.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps the most impressive is by a guy who sold very few
records in the first place, made precisely one promotional video,
never came close to having a hit single and hasn't put out new
material since 1982, when he abandoned music altogether.
</P>
<P>
   I speak of Don Van Vliet, better known as Captain Beefheart, the
weird and wonderful singer/songwriter/band leader whose sometimes
surreal _ and often pun-filled _ mutant strain of blues and jazz is
being appreciated all over again.
</P>
<P>
   For whatever reason, the summer of 1999 has seen an absolute
flood of the good Captain's work hitting the shelves. The most
accessible retrospective is the just-released ``The Dust Blows
Forward (An Anthology),'' a two-CD anthology from Rhino Records: 45
songs, from the stomping blues of his first single, 1966's ``Diddy
Wah Diddy,'' to three tracks from his final record, 1982's ``Ice
Cream for Crow.''
</P>
<P>
   But that's not all. Heck, no. His 1967 debut LP, ``Safe as
Milk'' and the later ``Mirror Man'' have been reissued on CD. And
for the hard-core fans there is ``Grow Fins,'' a massive five-CD
collection of live tracks, demos, radio broadcasts and more,
including a whole bunch of enhanced CD footage.
</P>
<P>
   Time has not changed this essential fact: Captain Beefheart is
one of those guys whom a very few people love very much, and the
rest of the world either A) can't stand to listen to for more than
about three minutes, or B) never heard and never will hear. Which
is probably best.
</P>
<P>
   Pal of Frank Zappa, blower of good 'n' greasy blues harmonica,
taskmaster band leader and definite eccentric, Beefheart took basic
Chicago blues and sort of, well, how to put it? ``Altered its
consciousness'' might be the best description.
</P>
<P>
   Full of surreal tales and stinging guitar work, the music of
Beefheart and his ever-changing Magic Band is one part Muddy
Waters, one part beat poetry, one part avant-garde jazz, one part
that ranting weirdo uncle whom nobody invites to family gatherings
anymore, one part tent preacher, one part _ heck, I don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Songs such as ``Big Eyed Beans From Venus'' and ``The Floppy
Boot Stomp'' may not make any sort of literal sense, but in a world
that's drowning in cookie-cutter music, they sound fresh and
twisted, adventurous and playful and human. You want alternative?
``Real'' alternative? Pick up the Rhino box and play just about any
track; what you'll find is much that's more challenging and just
plain fun than most anything by any current artist.
</P>
<P>
   Which may be because Beefheart's influence extends so widely.
Col. Bruce Hampton, the granddaddy of jam-band rock, was obviously
listening closely to Beefheart back in the '60s. Tom Waits' vocal
style is, at times, reminiscent of Beefheart's, and no small part
of Little Feat's oddball charm bears the Captain's mark.
</P>
<P>
   John Lydon _ who as Johnny Rotten led the Sex Pistols _ is an
avowed fan, and Pere Ubu (a very important proto-punk band from
Cleveland) was clearly touched by Beefheart's music. One can't
imagine the odd rants by vocalist David Thomas without Beefheart's
trailblazing work, which for my money was at its best on ``Milk,''
1969's ``Trout Mask Replica'' and 1980's ``Doc at the Radar
Station.''
</P>
<P>
   Years later, Captain Beefheart's music can still astonish and
captivate. You've gotta wonder what Van Vliet makes of all this as
he does his artwork somewhere out there in California, but he ain't
talking. He didn't even do an interview for the excellent booklet
that accompanies the Rhino box. But that, too, is somehow fitting:
Captain Beefheart said his piece, twisted as it often was, and then
exited. He doesn't need us, but listening to this stuff reminds me
just how much fans of adventurous music continue to need him.

<P>
   TELLURIDE, Colo. _ Melissa Margetts will never forget the time
she sliced open the bulging stomach of a cow elk that had been
seriously injured by a car on top of Dallas Divide.
</P>
<P>
   The emergency roadside Caesarean yielded a calf in obvious
distress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We grabbed her by the back legs and spun her around so the
centrifugal force would get this fluid out of her lungs,'' explains
Margetts. ``I had given her mouth-to-mouth and it took four minutes
to get her going.''
</P>
<P>
   The calf, nicknamed Junebug, was nursed back to health and
released into the wild last December.
</P>
<P>
   Margetts is a modern-day Dr. Dolittle meets MacGyver.
</P>
<P>
   Take the time she rescued a baby porcupine from its mother's
womb using only her Swiss Army knife, cinnamon dental floss and a
little ingenuity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was my first C-section,'' says Margetts, laughing. ``I got
the uterus out and opened it up and got the baby out. The placenta
was attached to it and I thought with a human baby you tie off the
umbilical cord so they don't bleed to death, so I had cinnamon
dental floss in the car, and I thought, what the heck.''
</P>
<P>
   The baby, dubbed Stickers, was featured on a National Geographic
Explorer television special with Boyd Matson.
</P>
<P>
   Margetts, 43, heads up the Rocky Mountain Ark Wildlife
Rehabilitation Center on a 14-acre spread high in the San Juan
Mountains near Telluride. She jokingly refers to her wildlife
refuge as the ``Damn Nice Ranch'' because that's what she said to
herself when she spied the rugged plot of land off a dirt Forest
Service access road.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Margetts has rescued thousands of wild and
domestic animals. Current residents include Spike, an
African-crested porcupine; Wile E. Coyote; a homeless donkey dubbed
Jackson Browne; Elvis the mutt; and a sassy exotic parrot named
Diego who seems to have picked up a bit of office lingo from his
previous owners.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right!'' screeches the brilliant blue and yellow bird from his
perch next to the deck.
</P>
<P>
   It's just after 10 a.m. and Margetts and an intern, Ann Allen,
make the usual feeding rounds _ every four hours around the clock _
armed with containers of mealworms for the birds, a bucket of milk
for the fawns and roadkill for Ruby the mountain lion. Elvis and
Jackson Browne trail behind for company, occasionally chasing each
other. It seems one of them has forgotten that he is a donkey.
</P>
<P>
   A typical season at the Ark produces as many as 150 animals,
many considered hard-luck cases after tangling with the most
dangerous creature of all _ humans.
</P>
<P>
   Such was the case with Chaos, a great horned owl.
</P>
<P>
   ``This couple was driving from California to their home in
Arizona,'' begins Margetts, with Chaos perched on her gloved arm.
``They were driving at night and they hit him and thought he was
just stunned. They put him in a box and kept him overnight while
they continued to drive and their dog got into the box and totally
mangled him. The dog tore off his left foot and it was hanging by a
thread and his left wing was dangling. They put him back in the box
and thought he would be dead and continued to drive to Arizona. He
was still alive when they got there, so they thought the most
peaceful way to die was when you freeze to death. They stuck him in
the freezer and left him there for 30 hours and when they checked
on him, he was still alive. They finally called the sheriff's
department and asked what to do. The sheriff's department picked
him up and took him to Liberty Wildlife, where his left wing was
amputated and his left foot was sewn back on. This was good
intentions really gone awry.''
</P>
<P>
   Margetts is a woman on a mission. She's on call 24 hours a day
and can often be found behind the wheel of her old green-and-white
ambulance picking up wounded animals and bringing them back to the
Ark.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our primary goal is wildlife rehab and reintroduction into the
wild,'' she says. ``All we are is a second chance for these guys to
be free. There's no guarantee. They die in the wild all the time.''
</P>
<P>
   With a 63 percent survival rate, many of Margetts' animals are
too critically wounded to survive and must be euthanized. Those
that make it are released back into the wild if they are able.
</P>
<P>
   ``The animals that I get attached to are the ones that I don't
think are going to make it,'' says Margetts. ``I am down at the
incubator at 2 o'clock in the morning and I've got my fingers
crossed and I am prepping myself for the idea that this animal is
more than likely going to be dead. Those are the ones that bring
tears to your eyes when it finally comes time to open up the box
and you see them tear across the field.''
</P>
<P>
   Animals that are maimed or unable to survive in the wild for
various reasons are retained for adult and children's education
programs at schools and national parks.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can plant a seed in one kid, you never know what kind
of a difference they will make,'' says Margetts. ``If you inspire
one kid not to throw that plastic six-pack container in a bag
without cutting it up and he tells his son who becomes a
schoolteacher and tells more kids _ you never know how it is going
to steamroll.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to her education programs, Margetts has been
featured in People magazine for her pet lending library, believed
to be the only one of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
   For 5 bucks, kids can get a library card and check out a
plethora of pets, including chinchillas, rabbits, guinea pigs,
hamsters, snakes, birds, pygmy goats _ even a tarantula spider in a
locked viewing box.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my favorite animal in the pet lending library,'' says
Margetts, while holding up what appears to be a gigantic New York
sewer rat. ``This,'' she says, ``is Howard Stern.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ark is also part of the International Placement Program, in
which animals are placed from all over the United States and
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   That's how she acquired a webbed-footed beaver named Wally.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came from Montreal, Canada, and his dam had been blown
up,'' says Margetts. ``The parents were killed and the two babies
floated to the surface. A couple brought the babies home and they
tried to feed them but didn't do it properly, so they got metabolic
bone disease which caused their legs to break. They were taken to a
zoo, but the zoo didn't want them, so they were put on the
placement program list.''
</P>
<P>
   Those animals that can be released back into the wild undergo an
intensive ``demanning'' process where Margetts and her volunteer
assistants beat on pots and pans with silverware or bang on the
side of their pens three times a day in an effort to make the
animals afraid of humans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The goal is not to harass the animals,'' says Margetts, ``but
we want them to have negative human contact. That's the hardest
part of the job. These guys start to follow you around after a
while and you have to start scaring them, banging on pots and pans
and flipping blankets and yelling and screaming. You want them to
run from you every time they see you.''
</P>
<P>
   Margetts' compassion for critters began at an early age while
growing up in Telluride. Her father, a medical doctor, often
doubled as the town vet and would bring home animals for Margetts
and her half dozen brothers and sisters to nurse back to health.
</P>
<P>
   She gleaned much of her medical knowledge from Dr. Dad, who was
known to dissect the chicken before dinner while pointing out
things like tendons and joints to anyone who would listen.
</P>
<P>
   After a short stint in Minnesota as an engineer for Honeywell
designing laser eyepieces for anti-tank weapons, Margetts heard the
call of the wild and followed it back to her hometown of Telluride.
</P>
<P>
   Life hasn't always been easy for the auburn-haired animal lover
who firmly believes that one person can make a difference. In 1992,
she was diagnosed with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The cancer went into
remission after several bouts of chemotherapy.
</P>
<P>
   Margetts is never short on animal stories. She remembers the
time a woman offered her $20 and told her to go to the grocery
store after she spotted Margetts tugging on a dead animal carcass
she was attempting to bring home to her animals. Then there was the
time she yelled at her son Jake to put his toys away only to find
out later that he had put his toys away before going to bed and it
was the baby beaver who was dragging them back out at night in an
attempt to build a dam across the doorway. Margetts and her
husband, Steve, once trapped an out-of-control badger inside a
Rubbermaid container. Taz, as the badger was affectionately called,
was making horrible noises and the container was flipping all over
the place as the two struggled to keep it intact. It was then that
Steve turned to Margetts and said with a straight face, ``Don't you
wish everything was made like Rubbermaid?'' And she still remembers
the time a couple from Norwood gave her a pair of milk goats but
neglected to tell her that they only produced milk if they got to
listen to the country radio station KKXK.
</P>
<P>
   ``Them's country goats,'' she remembers the man telling her.
</P>
<P>
   Margetts takes a moment to reflect on her life as rain pours
from the dark storm clouds that have gathered overhead near the San
Juan Mountain range. After watching four otters gleefully swimming
in the enclosed otter pond outside her living room window, she
turns and says, ``If I won the lottery, I would still be doing this
on Monday. Even if I didn't have a dime to my name, I'd be doing
this on Monday. It's a fulfillment in my life that I would have a
hard time explaining to anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   She just hopes she has many more Mondays. In November 1998,
Margetts' cancer returned. She underwent surgery to remove masses
from her pancreas and stomach. Since that time, she has lost 80
pounds.
</P>
<P>
   Ironically, it's the animals who are now keeping Margetts alive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believe the animals have had more to do with healing
me than I had to do with healing them,'' she says, quietly. ``I
feel that I have made a difference, not only in the lives of
thousands of animals, but also the kids. If I died tomorrow, that
would be perfectly fine with me.''

   ATLANTA _ Bye-bye, Carmen Miranda. Celebrity chef Paul Luna has
stolen your punch.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Portuguese bombshell _ who moved to Brazil, put a bunch
of bananas on her head and became a kitsch classic _ Atlanta's
wackiest chef is putting on a show at Loca Luna, his new
Brazilian-inspired late-night hangout in Midtown.
</P>
<P>
   The other night, as a whispery bossa nova band played jazz
standards, Luna was on the bar blowing bubbles and handing out
bright red rum drinks to a fawning crowd. A few nights later, he'd
strapped on the most outrageous Carnival outfit he could find _ a
revealing getup of leopard prints and pheasant feathers _ and was
ready to samba.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, did we mention that he also cooks everything from pickled
pig's feet to guava flan?
</P>
<P>
   Blame it on Rio.
</P>
<P>
   Like any number of trend-savvy entrepreneurs, Luna knows that
the biggest wave of the moment is Brazilian. Starbucks has been
promoting its Ipanema Bourbon bean in a fancy package with a
Carnival dancer on the label. Even the rock star Beck has recorded
``Tropicalia,'' a song based on the stylish '60s Brazilian sound.
</P>
<P>
   In Atlanta, Delta Air Lines has added nonstops to Brazil and
says it wants to offer flights from other U.S. cities. Emory
University says its Evening at Emory Portuguese classes are second
only to Spanish. Arts venue directors say that when a Brazilian
ensemble comes to town, the community of Brazilian expatriates _
estimated at 10,000 to 15,000 _ crawls out of the woodwork. Back on
the culinary front, Tierra, the new pan-Latin restaurant on
Piedmont Avenue, is seizing the moment by offering feijoada _ the
Brazilian national dish _ at a special, one-night-only dinner Sept.
7. Chef Ticha Krinsky, who lived in Brazil for seven years and
speaks Portuguese, says it's the first time an Atlanta restaurant
has offered the complicated dish of pork, black beans, rice and
numerous other accompaniments (reservations recommended:
404-874-5951).
</P>
<P>
   ``Carnival is what people want,'' says food industry
standard-bearer Michael Batterberry, founding editor of Food Arts
magazine.
</P>
<P>
   ``Carnival history is what drives people into deliriums of
excess and happiness, and it's usually in places that are pretty
repressive. . . . It goes back to the Saturnalian rituals, when all
conventions were tossed out the window and you just got your cans
full of pebbles and jumped up and down.'' He's referring to
S.O.B.'s, Manhattan's hottest restaurant-cum-samba room, where
patrons get an aluminum can full of rocks so they can play
percussion and dance between bites (S.O.B., by the way, stands for
``Sounds of Brasil'').
</P>
<P>
   That's clearly the kind of revelry Luna has in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they want to get on the table, go for it,'' says the
35-year-old chef, who turned the town onto Spanish tapas at Eclipse
di Luna, his other Atlanta restaurant, in 1997. Luna's new place _
wedged between the popular gay nightspots Backstreet and the Armory
at the corner of 6th and Juniper streets _ is open until 1:30 a.m.
on Tuesdays through Thursdays and until 5:30 a.m. on Fridays and
Saturdays. Never mind that he's from the Dominican Republic and
doesn't speak Portuguese. Luna is so convinced of the trend that he
wants to do a cooking show _ in Portuguese.
</P>
<P>
   Done up to look like a South American beach bar, Loca Luna is
painted in Starburst shades of purple, orange, red, yellow and
green. There's even a mural of Corcovado, the landmark Rio de
Janeiro mountain with the statue of Christ on top. But because
authentic Brazilian ingredients are hard to find, Luna has fudged a
bit on the menu. He says he'll soon be adding some authentic
dishes, including bolinho de bacalhau (fried codfish balls),
moquecas (coconut-milk-based fish stews) pao de queijo (cheese
rolls).
</P>
<P>
   ``I really like it,'' says Alessandra Lange, 24, an Atlanta
Ballet dancer from Curitiba, Brazil, who was at the restaurant on a
recent Saturday. ``I just wish it was more Brazilian. It's like the
first city I've lived in the United States where there is not a
Brazilian place.'' Lang says that Brazilians hang out at North Cafe
Diem (642 North Highland Ave. N.E.) on Monday nights and Voodoo
(3186 Roswell Road N.E., Buckhead) on Wednesdays.
</P>
<P>
   But restaurant-industry insiders say it's only a matter of time
before the rodizio craze, already big in New York, California and
Texas, hits Atlanta. After all, barbecue-loving Southerners ought
to go for the all-you-eat meat concept, in which roving waiters
carve slices of meat right onto your plate. ``It satisfies a lot of
hunger today for people in their 20s and 30s,'' says Batterberry.
``It suggests a place where you can cut lose and have fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Atlanta-Brazil business connection is booming.
Although Atlanta's Brazilian Consulate closed in June due to
government cuts back home, it wasn't for lack of interest on the
part of tourist and business travelers from Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can tell you easily that both the number of tourist and
business people going to Brazil increased threefold in the 3 1/2
years we were in Atlanta,'' says Mario Graca Roiter, Brazil's
former consul general in Atlanta, who has been re-assigned to
Tokyo. According to the Brazilian Embassy in Washington, 9,020
visas were issued by the Atlanta consulate in 1998, out of a total
of 148,321 nationally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil has been the best performing Latin American market,''
says Delta spokesman John Kennedy. ``Passenger loads have been
extremely high this summer.'' In 1997, Delta began offering
non-stops to Sao Paulo, with continuing service to Rio. Kennedy
says the airline is seeking permission to add non-stop flights from
other major U.S. cities. ``Europe is still the dominant market,
approximately 3 to 1, but we are seeing a burgeoning Latin American
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Stoffle, Emory's director of community education
services, says: ``We've been really amazed by the response to
Portuguese. We tried it as an experiment, and it just started going
like gangbusters. So there's definitely a market for it. Doing
business in Brazil has been one of the key motivators for people.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Rialto Center for the Performing Arts downtown and
Charleston's Spoleto Festival USA, Brazilian artists have been on
the program for the last several seaons _ and both presenters are
considering bringing back Bale Folclorico da Bahia, which sold out
two Rialto shows in March 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``In future seasons,'' says Rialto executive director Bill
Baites, ``I plan to include Brazilian music and dance as a regular
part of our programming, because the audiences are extremely loyal.
... We've documented the fact that in two performances of Bale
Folclorico da Bahia in a 900-seat hall, we have sold out with a
strong Brazilian presence in the audience.''
</P>
<P>
   So what about that Ipanema Bourbon bean?
</P>
<P>
   ``Ipanema is the name of the farm it comes from, and bourbon is
the type of coffee tree,'' says Starbucks spokesman Helen Chung,
pronouncing ``bourbon'' as ``bur-BONE.''
</P>
<P>
   And we thought Ipanema was a beach.
</P>

<P>
   NEW YORK _ MTV and the Met? They may sound incompatible, but
next Thursday MTV plans to present its 16th annual Video Music
Awards in the elegant opera house at Lincoln Center.
</P>
<P>
   The award ceremony has taken place in New York before, but MTV
executives said they wanted to do something particularly majestic
this year in honor of the millennium.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to find a venue that fits the spirit of the show,
which is kind of like an awards show but twisted,'' said Judy
McGrath, the president of MTV.
</P>
<P>
   Radio City Music Hall, where the awards have been presented
before, is under renovation. MTV felt the Universal Amphitheater in
Los Angeles, site of last year's awards, was too cavernous. They
weighed the possibility of staging it in Central Park or on a barge
in the Hudson River. Then someone thought of the Met, suspecting it
would be like asking for the moon. Ms. McGrath likened the first
meeting between MTV and the Met to a U.N. conference, ``feeling
each other out.''
</P>
<P>
   But in short order the Met agreed.
</P>
<P>
   With the comedian Chris Rock as host, the show is to include
Madonna, Jennifer Lopez and Susan Sarandon as presenters, along
with performances by Ricky Martin, Lauryn Hill, the Backstreet Boys
and Britney Spears.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the Met's first production of the season is a
double bill: ``Cavalleria Rusticana'' with Jose Cura and ``I
Pagliacci'' with Placido Domingo.
</P>
<P>
   Although one might expect such a collaboration to result in a
clash of high and low culture, instead, both MTV and the Met say,
so far so good. ``They've been unbelievably open-minded about this
as we have been respectful and flattered to be there,'' Ms. McGrath
said. ``They're not like geeks who've never understood anything
creative. In fact, their set for `Mephistopheles' could give
Marilyn Manson a lesson or two.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Joseph Volpe, thegeneral manager of the Met, he said MTV
was more than welcome, particularly since the opera season does not
begin until Sept. 27, and the stage would otherwise be unoccupied
at this time of year. ``The worst thing a theater can be is dark,''
Volpe said. ``Here is an opportunity for it to be alive again.''
</P>
<P>
   MTV may also have wanted to find something that would upgrade
the production, given past criticism. In The New York Times, Neil
Strauss called last year's ceremony ``a three-hour salute to
tastelessness.''
</P>
<P>
   The Met, which would not disclose what its rental fee, is not
entirely unfamiliar with unorthodox tenants, like Robin Williams,
who staged a comedy special there. Nevertheless, there have been a
few bumps in the creative process: like the time MTV reported that
one rapper, DMX, wanted to include pit bulls in his performance and
another wanted to drive a Bentley onto the stage. ``Since they're
accustomed to dealing with livestock, I think we'll figure that
out,'' Ms. McGrath said. ``And they're used to vehicles, but it's
usually a horse and a cart.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGrath said the Met has learned that opera divas have
nothing on rock divas. ``Opera stars don't have posses,'' she said.
``They're used to dealing with divas, but they don't have divas
that come with 40 friends.''
</P>
<P>
   On some issues, MTV said, the Met drew the line. Ruled out was
the standard method of operation for the production team that sets
up the show: camping out and ordering in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The staff that works on a show tends to move in and live
there,'' Ms. McGrath said. ``They said, `Absolutely no eating in
the hall. You can't have a tub of Pepsi in the aisle and a sandwich
at your right hand.'''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time the opera house has been extremely
accommodating in other ways. For example MTV will be replacing the
opera costumes on display in the Met lobby with famous outfits worn
by various musicians at previous MTV music video awards, like a
pair of seatless yellow pants worn by Prince when he sang ``Get
Off'' in 1991 and a Marie Antoinette outfit worn by Madonna when
she sang ``Vogue'' in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   On the backs of seats, instead of the usual opera titles, the
lyrics of the featured performers will be displayed. (The featured
songs will not include profanities, MTV said.)
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody comes into the Metropolitan Opera, what's the
point of having them if you can't be hospitable?'' Volpe said.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The auditorium, which usually holds 4,000, will also feel
different, with 500 seats removed to accommodate sets and cameras
and pits for dancing fans and a thrust that will allow musicians to
move out into the audience. The lobby will be transformed with DJ
Moby choosing tunes at the top of the grand staircase. The outside
plaza will be a spectacle including a live MTV News broadcast
featuring the band Smash Mouth and limousines dispensing
star-studded attendees onto a red carpet.
</P>
<P>
   MTV, in turn, has decided to pay tribute to its environs with
certain operatic touches. The awards are to open with ``Carmina
Burana,'' a cantata composed by Carl Orff in the 1930s that turns
up in the hip-hop works of NAS and Sean (Puffy) Combs. The
16-year-old Welsh opera singer Charlotte Church will present an
award with the heavy metal band Limp Bizkit. The ad campaign
depicts rock stars posing as opera characters: Chris Rock as
Rigoletto, David Bowie as Mephistopheles and Janet Jackson as
Cleopatra.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM.)
</P>
<P>
   To create its set MTV chose the Russian designer George Tsypin,
who has mostly worked on operas.
</P>
<P>
   Tsypin said he meant his set _ a looming steel and glass
structure that includes a rendering of the Statue of Liberty _ to
invoke an image of New York as a Tower of Babel. ``For me it's not
such a big departure because even though I design mostly opera, I
kind of go against operatic tradition,'' he said. ``All these
things kind of merge _ classical music and rock-and-roll _ in my
mind. I listen to all of it.'' (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. McGrath said the musicians scheduled to appear seemed
somewhat awed by the prospect of playing at the Met. ``A lot of
bands are starting to feel like, `Gosh, maybe this calls for more
layers of fabric than I was initially thinking about,''' she said.
``For musicians who care deeply about sound and acoustics, I think
this adds a layer of anxiety and energy to it.''
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In addition, it seems the featured musicians feel that the Met's
atmosphere is sufficiently attention getting. ``In the past, a lot
of people felt they had to come with huge production numbers,'' Ms.
McGrath said. ``I generally get millions of requests, `Can I hang
the neon sign behind me?' This time, almost everyone coming wants
to just stand there, enjoy the moment and the space and sing their
best.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   As to whether or not the experience of being in the Met might
create some new operagoers, Volpe said he was optimistic. ``I think
once they're in the house, they might say, `I want to come back and
see what this opera thing is all about,''' he said. While one might
not expect Volpe himself to be jamming on an air guitar in the
aisles, he said he hoped to attend and added, ``You've never seen
me on the dance floor.''

`FASTER': CAN YOU SPARE 7 MINUTES OF LIFE TO READ THIS? 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds.: Publication notes are at end of review.)  
 Patricia Volk is a novelist and essayist who lives in New York.  
(editors: in last graf, replace (POUND SIGN) with the typographical
symbol)

<P>
   On the old television show ``Beat the Clock,'' contestants were
given wacky tasks to do while a giant second hand ticked away. The
audience howled as grown men and women raced around in gorilla
suits with eggs on spoons. In ``Faster: The Acceleration of Just
About Everything,'' James Gleick says that is what we're doing now.
Life is a 33 rpm record spinning at 78. We are a culture of racing,
panicky white rabbits. Naturally, you've noticed.
</P>
<P>
   You don't just do one thing at a time anymore. You multi-task.
In the car you drink coffee, listen to self-improvement tapes, talk
on the cellular phone and floss. You wash your hair with J.F.
Lazartigue's ``sechage rapide,'' a shampoo with polymers that
hastens drying by 30 percent. In advanced cases of ``hurry
sickness'' you punch 88 on the microwave instead of 90 because it
takes less time to tap the same digit twice. There is a whole
generation of workers weaned on video games who function at
``twitch speed.''
</P>
<P>
   Can we get any faster than twitch? We're trying. The fastest
elevator in the world travels at ``a good climb rate for an
airplane.'' Not fast enough? Look forward to the pressurized sky
lobby, a room ``high inside a megaskyscraper, where passengers pass
through an airlock to repressurize before making a rapid descent to
the ground.''
</P>
<P>
   IBM promises to cut waiting at airport immigration checkpoints
to 15 seconds once you surrender your biometrics: fingerprints and
voiceprints. Politicians are coached to speak in 10-second sound
bites. A three-minute television news segment is considered ``long
form.'' We're even learning to hear faster. Telephone answering
machines speed up messages 25 percent in case your friends drawl.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to real time. Gleick writes, ``If you can sign the
check, lick the stamp and toss the envelope onto the passing mail
room robot cart just as you tell your caller, `It's in the mail,'
you have at least part of your life running in real time.''
</P>
<P>
   And what is the price for all this speed? You can't keep up.
``Software product cycles, already short at 18 months to 2 years,
have begun to evaporate,'' Gleick says. ``Instead of distinct,
tested, shrink-wrapped versions of software, manufacturers
distribute upgrades and patches that change within months or even
days.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Faster'' points to science writer James Burke, who predicts,
``We will need to reskill ourselves constantly every decade just to
keep a job.'' We are speeding cartoons, cloud puffs scuttling
behind our heels. There is no time for contemplation. We live life
in the crisis lane.
</P>
<P>
   A man who lives in real time, Jay Walljasper, an editor at large
at the Utne Reader magazine, is quoted: ``I can't stand small talk,
waiting in line or slow numbers on the dance floor. . . . It has
gotten to the point where my days, crammed with all sorts of
activities, feel like an Olympic endurance event: the
everydayathon. . . . I hear an invisible stopwatch ticking even
when I'm supposed to be having fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Observing us glued to our cellular phones or our screens, or our
cell phones  &UR; and &LR;  our screens, Gleick, a frequent contributor to
The New York Times Magazine, looks for the why. ``It is the way of
keeping contact with someone, anyone, who will reassure you that
you are not alone. You may think you are checking on your
portfolio, but deep down you are checking on your existence.''
</P>
<P>
   So what are we doing with all this time we are saving? We're
having sex for an average of four minutes a day. Seven minutes are
lavished on the care of plants and pets. Internet users wait nine
minutes daily for their Web sites to materialize. Sixteen minutes
drop into the black hole of looking for lost objects. ``The
software industry alone leaves Americans waiting on hold for an
estimated 3 billion minutes a year,'' Gleick writes. Television
sucks up three hours a day. A strategy for bargaining power is
bragging about how little time you have: ``The more time you have
on your hands, the less important you must be.''
</P>
<P>
   In rat-a-tat yet elegant prose, Gleick hammers out precisely how
time-driven we are. Smell the roses? Fine, if you order them on the
Web and ship them overnight. I tried to think of things no one
could make faster. There's dawn. (Unless you jet past the
international date line.) There's pregnancy. (For the birth itself,
we have the drug Pitocin.) There is still the three-minute egg.
Gleick offers compost and souffles, but I bet you could do
something with a microwave. Not that we always opt for speed.
Pistachio nuts that have already been shelled are quicker, but
they're not nearly as great as pistachio nuts in the shell.
</P>
<P>
   In years to come, ``Faster'' will tell people what we were like
as clearly as Dickens or Tom Wolfe. It would help if you knew a
little high school physics. What on earth are Tetris blocks,
teraflops, parsecs and Mersenne primes? What does folding a piece
of paper in half  &UR; n &LR;  times mean? Precooked meals take up more space
in the supermarket than fresh fruits and vegetables? Not at my
market. And sorting stamps is boring? I'd kill to get my old stamp
collection back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eventually, if we pay attention to our watches, they teach us
something even more valuable: that lived time is different from
clock time,'' Gleick writes. ``Our experience of time changes with
our moods, with our age, with our level of busyness, with the
complexity of our culture.'' Time, he writes, ``is a version of the
truth you wear on your wrist.''
</P>
<P>
   The writer Mark Helprin says, ``Life is lived with the kind of
excitement that your forebears knew only in battle.'' So if you
don't have time to read ``Faster'' (it took me 412 minutes, or 103
days of sex), here is a time-saving hint: on your telephone,
pressing the (POUND SIGN) key lets you skip the automated prompts.
``f y cn rd ths, y cn ern mo py,'' the old bus advertisement used
to say. Speed is our destiny, speed is our fate. Gleick cites the
historian Stephen Kern: ``Human beings have never opted for
slower.'' Tell that to my friend who still makes toast in a
skillet.

 &HT;    Business Week tracks the launch of an IPO
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many a corporate executive thought a public stock
offering was the right way for a company to go, only to regret it
later. Business Week (Sept. 6) explains why in a step-by-step
profile of an initial stock offering, or IPO.
</P>
<P>
   The magazine follows an Internet mortgage company, E-Loan,
through this grueling process. It goes from making a pitch to
investors, includes a hectic national road show to visit money
managers and underwriters and culminates in the tension-filled
launch on the day the company begins trading, in this case on the
Nasdaq market.
</P>
<P>
   E-Loan raised $56.3 million in a June 29 IPO and got to keep
$50.3 million after the underwriters, attorneys, accountants,
regulatory agencies and miscellaneous other individuals deducted
their fees.
</P>
<P>
   But at least the first day of trading made it seem worthwhile.
E-Loan's stock, which went on the market at $14 per share, rose 164
percent, giving the company a market value of $1.4 billion. The
stock continued to rise for several more days until it peaked on
July 6 at a closing price of $63 per share. After that, the stock
dipped into a trading range at about one-third its top price.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting on the experience, E-Loan Chief Executive Chris
Larsen said, ``If it wasn't for Prozac, I never would have gotten
through it.''
</P>
<P>
   Home Depot's bright future
</P>
<P>
   Economist A. Gary Shilling has a slightly different take on why
Atlanta-based Home Depot has become the giant of home improvement
retailing. It's U.S. tax policy, he says in Forbes (Sept. 6).
</P>
<P>
   In addition to overhead costs and the need for a profit margin,
the professional plumber, electrician or carpenter has to charge a
huge fee to cover the government's tax take _ a fee that may be
bigger than the cost of doing it yourself with products bought at
Home Depot, Lowe's or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   He says the outlook for these retailers is bright, since ``high
tax rates are not going away any time soon,'' nor will the yearning
of ``deskbound professionals'' for do-it-yourself, hands-on work.
</P>
<P>
   Worth mentioning ...
</P>
<P>
   _ Indexing is probably the most popular way to invest in mutual
funds these days, since the fund is guaranteed to do at least as
well as the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, or whatever it is indexed to.
But Bloomberg Personal Finance (September) says funds tracking the
S&AMP;P 500 may not be right for every investor. There are multiple
indices to choose from, and it will take some homework to find the
right one.
</P>
<P>
   _ Fortune (Sept. 6) continues its look at 20th century business
giants with profiles of pioneers in mass media: William Paley of
CBS, Henry Luce of Time and David Sarnoff of RCA. The ``B'' list
includes Ted Turner of CNN, newspaper mogul William Randolph Hearst
and Australian media magnate Rupert Murdoch.

MOSCOW BOMBING TIED TO GROUP OPPOSED TO CONSUMERISM 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By MICHAEL WINES    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ An explosion on Tuesday evening at a lavish underground
shopping mall opposite the Kremlin may be the work of a previously
unknown group that opposes materialism and warns that it is
dangerous to consumers, Russian investigators said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   As police stepped up security at the three-level mall and other
major buildings, the Federal Security Service said a leaflet that
attacked modern consumer society, attributed to a group called the
Union of Revolutionary Writers, had been found at or near the video
arcade that was the blast site.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumers, we do not like your way of life and we are
dangerous to you,'' the pamphlet stated. ``The half-eaten hamburger
left by the dead man on the streets is now a revolutionary
hamburger.''
</P>
<P>
   An Internet address in an advertisement on the pamphlet leads to
a Russian-language Web site with slogans like, ``To sell or to
betray: Which is better?'' and rambling comments on fascism, death
and other topics. The site purports to be the work of a novelist,
but his identity could not be confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   The explosion at the Manezh mall, a popular hangout for young
Muscovites, killed no one and injured 41 people, at least six
seriously. More than 20 were in hospitals Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The blast seized the headlines in a city made jittery by a
series of bomb scares at synagogues, a huge blast in a downtown
hotel and repeated government warnings about the potential for
terrorism. The Kremlin has said for months that political extremism
was becoming a threat to public safety and that law-enforcement
agencies were prepared to crack down on radical factions.
</P>
<P>
   The first suspicions about Tuesday's blast centered on Muslim
separatists in Dagestan and Chechnya, regions where government
forces have waged an increasingly bloody battle this summer against
rebel armies and criminal gangs.
</P>
<P>
   But Wednesday the chief of the security service, Nikolai
Patrushev, said that there was no reason ``for the time being'' to
tie the bombing to the separatists and that other extremists or
hooligans were more likely responsible. Other experts speculated
that warfare among criminal gangs, a likely cause of the bombing at
the Intourist hotel four months ago, might be behind the explosion.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the security service said the blast had been
caused by a homemade bomb, with the explosive force of 10.5 ounces
of TNT, packed in a plastic canister with a timer. Police said they
were studying videotape from mall security cameras in hopes of
spotting the person or people behind the bombing.
</P>
<P>
   The mall, beneath a large square just north of the Kremlin wall,
opened in 1997 at the height of an investment boom. The city
government poured hundreds of millions of borrowed dollars into the
project and says it has been profitable. Private analysts say that
is unlikely, given the nation's economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   Moscow Mayor Yuri Luzhkov called the bombers beasts and said an
attack on an arcade, where children would be expected to gather,
was especially cowardly.
</P>
<P>
   Luzhkov, who heads his own political party and is a leading
candidate to succeed President Boris Yeltsin, said the bombing
could be an attempt to embarrass him in advance of the winter
parliamentary elections, which will be followed next year by a
presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people need to be shot,'' he told the Itar-Tass news
agency.

   MIDEAST-PEACE _ CAIRO, Egypt _ U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright begins delayed trip to the Middle East here amid positive
signs that Israeli and Palestinian leaders are making headway to
restarting the accords laid out in the Wye River Memorandum. That
agreement, hammered out over several days with President Bill
Clinton and Jordan's King Hussein meditating, has been stalled for

   RUSSIA-CAUCASUS _ TBILISI, Georgia _ It may seem like a small
war. But looks are deceiving. Russia's latest military action in
its southern republic of Dagestan has far-reaching implications for
the stability of the former superpower and the well-being of the
oil-rich Caspian Sea region. Russia declared victory two weeks ago
when Russian forces managed to re-take several villages and push
many of the guerrillas out of Dagestan, back across the border into
the breakaway republic of Chechnya. But the Chechen warlords, now
back in Chechnya, vow they will regroup and return to challenge
Russian forces in Dagestan. It was a clear sign that Russia may
have won some battles, but it has not won the war. (Christie, Cox

cow elk that had been seriously injured by a car on top of Dallas
Divide. The emergency roadside Caesarean yielded a calf in obvious
distress. ``We grabbed her by the back legs and spun her around so
the centrifugal force would get this fluid out of her lungs,''
explains Margetts. ``I had given her mouth-to-mouth and it took
four minutes to get her going.'' The calf, nicknamed Junebug, was
nursed back to health and released into the wild last December.
Margetts, a modern-day Dr. Dolittle meets MacGyver, heads up the

   MALCOLMX-DONATION _ATLANTA _Local guy has donated to Emory
University Library a horde of previously unseen correspondence from
Malcolm X. Experts of Malcolmology say they are quite significant
for scholarship, since many of his private papers were destroyed
after his assassination. ``Given how well-known and appropriately
celebrated Malcolm is, it's embarrassing that the historical
scholarship on him is so modest and spotty and incomplete,'' Garrow
says. ``This material shows what an immensely talented individual
he was, even when he was 20 years old. (Hendrick, Atlanta

feather for certain customs as a Creek Indian. Problem is, eagles
are protected by the government (even dead ones are kept at a
Colorado depository), and the govt doesn't recognize his branch of
the Creeks. Supposedly, Judge Hurley in his ruling did say he was
``troubled'' by the arbitrary manner by which the govt chooses to
recognize Indians; Gibson said he's disappointed, but he's
appealling the decision. (Hiaasen, Palm Beach Post) MOVED

   DILI, Indonesia _ With a jumble of swords, slingshots and
automatic weapons, gangs of street toughs battled outside the
United Nations compound here Wednesday, killing at least one person
and trapping scores of U.N. officials and journalists inside for
several hours.
</P>
<P>
   One man was clubbed to the ground with a rifle butt, then hacked
to death with machetes a few yards from the U.N. gate.
</P>
<P>
   The Indonesian police, who have been criticized by the United
Nations for their ineffectiveness, were slow to arrive. And they
mostly stood aside during much of the fighting, failing to protect
either Indonesians or foreigners who were beaten by the thugs.
</P>
<P>
   The street battle, which ended in early evening, was part of a
surge of tension as U.N. officials began counting ballots
Wednesday, two days after a referendum to decide on whether this
tiny, disputed territory should become independent of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   After Indonesian invasion and the 24 years of war that followed,
during which some 200,000 people died in this former Portuguese
colony, East Timor has become a symbol of the resistance of small
territories against foreign occupation.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the United Nations, which conducted the referendum,
said it would be about a week before the process of counting and
validating the ballots is complete and the results are announced.
</P>
<P>
   Officials and analysts here said the period just before and
after the announcement holds a high potential for violence.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``I am gravely concerned about the prospect of renewed violence
in this post-balloting stage,'' said the British ambassador to
Indonesia, Robin Christopher, a few hours before the fighting
erupted Wednesday. ``The situation is quite dire. In East Timor we
have really seen intimidation developed into a fine art.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's violence resembled a gang war between groups of
toughs supporting the two sides in the referendum. They taunted and
threatened one another, dancing, wiggling their behinds and making
rude gestures, then firing slingshots and homemade pistols,
accompanied by puffs of smoke.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unequal fight. The rulers of the street were the young
men who have been organized by the Indonesian military into ragtag
militias that have terrorized East Timor in an effort to derail the
referendum and block independence.
</P>
<P>
   Monday's strong turnout of nearly 99 percent of registered
voters was a defeat for their campaign of intimidation, and it
suggested the strong possibility of a victory for the
pro-independence side.
</P>
<P>
   ``They may see this as their last chance of reversing the
process,'' Damian Kingsbury, a professor at Monash University in
Australia, said of the pro-Indonesian gangs. ``It seems they really
have nowhere to go but to create havoc.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Donald Emmerson, a professor at the University of Wisconsin in
Madison, said the violence could be seen as a last attempt by the
militias to assert their importance against a tide that may have
turned against them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Many militias are more or less resigned to the momentum toward
independence,'' he said.``They have shifted to an assertive mode
in which you kill in order to maintain your place on the landscape.
People have to take you into account. You matter.''
</P>
<P>
   There is frustration evident in the gangs' anger against
foreigners, whom they see as favoring the pro-independence forces.
They seem particularly angry at foreign journalists, who keep
rushing to take their pictures when they become _ as one elderly
woman here put it _ ``naughty.''
</P>
<P>
   One reporter, Jonathan Head of the BBC, was beaten with a rifle
butt, although he was not seriously injured.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's fighting also showed the role played by feuds among
local gangs. These have been heightened as the military has armed
some groups to act as their surrogate spoilers.
</P>
<P>
   With Dili, East Timor's capital, broken into a checkerboard of
pro- and anti-independence neighborhoods, the violence Wednesday
apparently began when a militia group attacked a market area near
the U.N. compound, burning several houses.
</P>
<P>
   Local ruffians fought back with their homemade weapons, and the
little street in front of the compound became a chaos of people
running back and forth with sticks, stones, hatchets and television
cameras.

 &HT;    Excerpts from the Malcolm X collection
 &HT;    By Staff Reports
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _
</P>
<P>
   EDS: These are excerpts from the Malcolm X collection lent to
Emory University's Woodruff Library in Atlanta. All typos,
incorrect grammar, etc., are cq per the manuscripts.
</P>
<P>
   In 1941, 16-year-old Malcolm Little was living in Boston. He
wrote a four-page letter to a friend, Zelma Holman, back in
Michigan:
</P>
<P>
   Dearest Zel,
</P>
<P>
   Sorry I haven't gotten around to writing you sooner but I have
been very busy. You know how we traveling men are. How is
everything in Jackson. Boston's fine. The place is really
``jumpin.'' Count Basie will be here Thanksgiving nite. I'm working
in a dance hall where all the large bands come, therefore I've seen
quite a few of them. ...
</P>
<P>
   Is Thomas Looper still jiving you. It look to me like he was
getting pretty serious _ that's why I stayed my distance that nite
I was there. Listen, will you send me a picture of you. I want to
show the fella's out here that we have some fine girls in Michigan
to &AMP; I want pictures of only the finest ``no jive''.
</P>
<P>
   I'm leaving for Florida after Xmas and when I leave there I'm
going to try and spend the rest of the summer in California. I've
already been in 23 different states. I'll be in Georgia for about a
month.
</P>
<P>
   Do you know if Lansing Central won or lost their game with
Lansing Eastern. Do you see Phil and the rest very often. ...
</P>
<P>
   I'll stop boring you with this bad writing and poor spelling now
and close. I do hope you will answer sooner than I wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Always,
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm
</P>
<P>
   While in Boston, Malcolm got a job as a cook in a railroad
dining car. He received this undated note:
</P>
<P>
   We should not be compelled to WRITE you EVERY TIME a payment is
due on your account.
</P>
<P>
   Only receipt of a payment immediately will prevent us from
taking legal action.

</P>
<P>
   Credit Manager
</P>
<P>
   In 1946, Malcolm was in prison in Charlestown, Mass. He wrote to
his half-sister, Ella Collins:
</P>
<P>
   My Dear Sister,
</P>
<P>
   I'm writing this to let you know what I want for Xmas. At least
I'm blunt _ hu? I've worn my fountain pen completely out. Thats
what I need, a fountain pen and a pair of gloves (preferably
mittens). You asked me two months ago what I wanted for Xmas, so
don't go blowing your top, now that I've told you.
</P>
<P>
   The pen, I need, because I still intend writing that book while
I'm here. I've already started on it (several times) but I've had
to destroy it because I wasn't satisfied with what I had
accomplished. ...
</P>
<P>
   Are you still going to get me transferred to Norfolk (penal
colony). I'm working in the foundry now. The work is a little
harder and very much dirtier, but I don't have any of these
prejudice, narrow-minded instructors messing with me now. I almost
broke my own code and lost my head last week. But I counted to ten,
and was transferred the next day. One good thing you learn here to
do while you're in here, and that is how to use a little
self-control. If you get me transferred to Norfolk, I'll try and
complete that whole book next year. They have a fine library down
there and one can learn so many more different things. My only
reason for wanting to go is the library alone. ...
</P>
<P>
   Hoping to see or hear from you soon.
</P>
<P>
   Your Brother,
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm Little
</P>
<P>
   Still in prison in 1948, the year after Jackie Robinson broke
baseball's color barrier, Malcolm wrote to Ella Collins:
</P>
<P>
   Hello Sis,
</P>
<P>
   Well how is my pretty little baby today? This being Easter, I
thought it would be nice of me if I tried to write you a charming
letter. However, I fear I've lost my touch. Charming and flattering
people used to be easy for me to do but now I'm finding it
extremely difficult. Maybe I'm growing old and more serious. Better
still, maybe I am just to evil. I do get my kicks by writing you
irritating letters. I must have inherited some sadistic traits from
someone along the line somewhere. Whom? ...
</P>
<P>
   Maybe I'm just beginning to find myself in this crazy world. ...
</P>
<P>
   Now that the baseball season has begun I have much to occupy my
mind because I follow Jackie Robinson and the Brooklyn Dodgers so
closely that, at times, I forget I'm in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Yvonne has graduated from high school, why don't you
invite her out for the summer? It certainly couldn't do any harm.
Or have I made you lose faith in your brothers and sisters. One
certainly can't compare the rest of them with me. I stand in a
class alone _ all by myself. ...
</P>
<P>
   I remain
</P>
<P>
   Your Brother
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm, after his conversion and name change, wrote in 1950 to
a friend named Raymond:
</P>
<P>
   My Most Dearly Beloved Brother Raymond,
</P>
<P>
   May the All-Wise Allah be with you as I write, and may He bestow
upon you Eternal Life. May He strengthen your understanding and
increase your wisdom; may He make you ever-thirsty for knowledge.
May your Humble Heart forever be filled with His essence of Pure
Love, giving you the peace and happiness that you so justly
deserve. ...
</P>
<P>
   The most beautiful thing in the world, and is a beauty that
forever attracts, is that which is read in the depths of ones eyes
_ therin lies the essence of ones Soul _ the Book of Allah _ for it
is this deep unfathomable work of Nature that forever leaves the
onlooker mute with silent admiration.
</P>
<P>
   People who possess this look of far-awayness are very deep
thinkers _ and are often classed as `Dreamers'. The Dreamers are
never sad, for they remain not in this wicked world of saddness _
they live in the `Within' _ they can climb to the `Heights', and
abode in Worlds of their own _ and the earthly creatures who are
bound by material desires, gaze into depths of the In-dwellers'
dreamy eyes and become enslaved by the captivating Mystery of that
Soul lost so deeply within Itself _ and the Way-Beyond. Long ago
the Brothers of our Black Nation knew and practised the Art of this
True Beauty _ and they were perfectionists. ...
</P>
<P>
   So your father is a Preacher? Mine was also; thats' why he is
dead today _ he didn't preach according to ``Hoyle''. He was a
devout Garveyite, in fact Marcus Garvey lived with us much of the
time. He was a Muslim, you know. My mother was very close to him,
having come from the Islands too. There is much more that I know
today concerning that affair that I didn't know before because of
my youth and my dead mind (my mother taught us Islam from birth,
but we never realized it. They put her in an asylum in 1938. You
can imagine why) In 1931 my father was ``placed'' under a street
car _ again, you can imagine why. We children were all too young to
fully ever know what was going down _ but Brother, these devils
were even then stomping out Islam. ...
</P>
<P>
   It will be nice when you are out, because you can induce many
... to see the Light. Give Lonny my ``hello'' _ he knew me in Flint
as ``Detroit Red.'' He was working for ``Chappie'' at his nite
club, and I worked in his gambling house. I wasn't on the scene
there too long, but there was a nice story behind my leaving
hurriedly _ which he may have heard (smile). ...
</P>
<P>
   As I now close, I pray Almighty Allah will keep you within His
Arms, Guiding you at all times in righteousness, and protecting you
from all evil _ always in the name of Mr Elijah Muhammad. ...
</P>
<P>
   Sincerely
</P>
<P>
   Your Brother in Truth, Malcolm X.

   Apple Is Top Banana in the PC Speed Wars &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Apple Computer humbled the rest of the personal computer
industry this week by introducing a new desktop machine based on
the Motorola PowerPC G4 processor, which Apple calls ``a
supercomputer on a chip.'' Using the Intel Corp.'s own benchmark
software, a 500-megahertz G4 Macintosh simply smoked the fastest
chip in Intel's PC lineup, the Pentium III.
</P>
<P>
   Intel countered by announcing that its long-awaited Coppermine
Pentium III processor, operating at a minimum speed of 700 MHz,
will be available in new personal computers by the end of October.
Coppermine is a code name for Intel's new submicron chip
manufacturing process that packs all the circuitry of a Pentium III
chip into a much smaller package, which makes the chip run faster.
</P>
<P>
   Intel itself needs to run faster to catch up to its competitors
in the PC world. The new Advanced Micro Devices Athlon (formerly
called K-7) processor, used by Compaq and several other PC makers,
outperforms the top Pentium III chips on benchmarking tests.
</P>
<P>
   But Apple, with the surprise announcement of its G4 chip family,
is now the top banana in the PC speed wars. Apple announced three
new, silver-and-gray Macintosh desktop models based on G4 chips, at
roughly same prices as Apple's current G3 models. The first,
available now, is a 400-MHz G4 that starts at $1,599.
</P>
<P>
   Power-hungry Mac users might be advised to wait, however. The
400-MHz model is based on an older Mac system design and is
considered the runt of the litter. The next two models will be
based on a new, high-performance Macintosh architecture called
Sawtooth. Apple said it would begin shipping the first of these
screamers, a 450-MHz G4 starting at $2,499, in a couple of weeks,
followed a few weeks later by a 500-MHz model that costs $3,499.
</P>
<P>
   And no desktop supercomputer would be complete without a
super-sized flat-panel monitor, so Apple also introduced a 22-inch
``Cinema Display'' for just $4,000 extra. The new systems are
expected to be popular among graphic arts and publishing
professionals, especially those on expense accounts.

<P>
   New Receiver for PC's Sounds and Looks Good  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With the growing popularity of large computer monitors,
high-fidelity sound cards and internal DVD-ROM and MP3 players, the
quality of personal computer speaker systems is beginning to share
the sort of cachet once only associated with the of the latest
microprocessors.
</P>
<P>
   Now the PC audio ante is being upped yet again with the
introduction of a stereo receiver made specifically for home
computers. Packing 30 watts per channel, Yamaha's home
entertainment reeceiver called the (at)PET RP-U100 is designed to
stand between a computer's Central Processing Unit and its
speakers, amplifying and refining the resulting sound. The $500
receiver, which, of course, includes an AM-FM digital tuner, and
home theater enhancements to help create surround-like sounds,
looks very much like a CPU tower as it stands on its four little
feet next to the monitor.
</P>
<P>
   The Yamaha receiver uses a universal serial bus to connect to
computers, and features connectors that permit home stereo speakers
to be used, rather than the often tinny-sounding one frequently
included with personal computers.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, high-output, powered computer speakers with their own
built-in amplifiers will do much the same job, and perhaps better,
for less than half the price (even Yamaha makes an 80-watt
three-piece speaker system for PCs).
</P>
<P>
   But powered speakers don't have as many cool buttons and dials
as the beefy new desktop receiver has. And that should count for
something, right?

   The High-End Camera Moves Up a Notch
</P>
<P>
   Just as digital cameras are dropping in price and consumers are
growing more eager to squint into the viewfinders of relatively
low-resolution, point-and-shoot cameras, some manufacturers are
preparing to offer a new, more highly evolved digital camera that
has much more in common with their professional-grade,
single-lens-reflex counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Sony Electronics recently announced its Cyber-shot DSC-F505,
priced just below $1,000, a mega-pixel camera that looks like an
unlikely marriage between a digital point-and-shoot and the kind of
barrel-lensed still camera more commonly found in the hands of
fashion photographers. A closer look at this magnesium-skinned
machine reveals a rotating, Carl Zeiss Vario-Sonnar lens,
high-speed automatic focus and digital zoom.
</P>
<P>
   This camera also shoots in 2.1 million pixel, 1,600-by-1,200
resolution, meaning that prints made from this digital camera are
more likely to rival photographs taken with traditional
35-millimeter cameras. The Cyber-shot can also produce moving
picture and sound clips in MPEG movie mode.
</P>
<P>
   Sony has also introduced a $1,999 Cyber-Shot Pro that features
even higher image resolution and a sort of no-tech mode that
permits photographers to manually set their exposure settings and
focus. Canon USA is also offering its own version of a new
professional-class digital camera _ but with a twist. Called the
PowerShot S10 (price still undetermined), this 2.1 mega-pixel
camera with a zoom lens is the smallest and lightest of its kind,
Canon says.
</P>
<P>
   While the Sony Cyber-Shot camera uses only Memory Sticks for
removable storage, the PowerShot and Cyber-Shot Pro uses flash
memory cards.
</P>
<P>
   Yukiaki Hashimoto, vice president and general manager of the
photographic products group for Canon USA called the camera
``sophisticated and easier to use.''

   A New Reason Not to Curse at Your PC  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Remember the scene from ``2001: A Space Odyssey'' where the evil
computer Hal 9000 discovers the plot to disconnect him by reading
the astronauts lips? In a few years, your PC will use the same
technique to find out when you might pull the plug on it.
</P>
<P>
   Alex Waibel, a professor of computer science at Carnegie-Mellon
University in Pittsburgh and the University of Karlsruhe in
Germany, has been developing a speech-recognition software that
reads lips as part of a project to increase the accuracy of
recognition systems.
</P>
<P>
   ``The problems with speech-recognition systems are they're not
good in a noisy environment and that they're not robust enough for
spontaneous speech,'' Dr. Waibel said. ``They basically don't know
what you're talking about.''
</P>
<P>
   The software, Nlips, uses a video camera to observe the
speaker's lips, jaw and, when visible, tongue. Observed
lip-sequences, which Waibel playfully calls ``visemes,'' because
they are the visual equivalent of differentiated sounds called
phomenes, were then fed into a neural network. The software would
then take the phrase, for example, ``no new taxes'' and check the
lip sequences against the sound sequences.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were working with the interesting effect, first observed in
the 1970s, that when people are listening, they are also visually
tracking the movements of the lips.''
</P>
<P>
   The Nlips software only increases speech-recognition accuracy by
1 percent or 2 percent in a quiet environment. But when there's
background noise and the accuracy of speech-only recognition drops
to about 60 percent, Nlips can lift the figure back up to 85
percent. Dr. Waibel expects the technology will be commercial
applications in five to 10 years, when cameras on computers and
even in cars become more common.

<P>
   BERLIN _ Germany on Wednesday marked the 60th anniversary of its
invasion of Poland and the start of World War II by declaring that
its eastern neighbor should have a place in the European Union as
soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
   On a day when most major newspapers chose to ignore the
anniversary _ a sign of a certain German weariness over such
commemorations _ President Johannes Rau traveled to Gdansk,
birthplace of the Solidarity labor movement, and thanked Poles for
igniting the resistance in the former Soviet bloc that ultimately
led to the collapse of communism in Europe and the unification of
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Referring to Solidarity, Rau said: ``This freedom movement made
the reunification of Germany possible. On this day and in this
place, I would like to pay tribute to that fact.''
</P>
<P>
   No such formal acknowledgment at the highest level had
previously been made, and Rau's visit clearly reflected the
continuing German attempt to overcome the bitter wounds of the war,
an effort that began when Willy Brandt fell to his knees in the
Warsaw ghetto in 1974 and has quickened since the Cold War's end.
</P>
<P>
   But although official ties have improved enormously, and the two
countries became NATO allies this year when Poland joined the
alliance, relations between Poles and Germans remain generally
cool. They are clouded by old suspicions, problems of illegal
immigration across the now porous border, and sometimes plain
prejudice.
</P>
<P>
   ``A trip over the border to a market is usually sufficient for
the German tourist who fears his car will be stolen if he goes
deeper into the country,'' The Berliner Morgenpost noted.
``Beautifully renovated cities like Gdansk and Wroclaw arouse
little curiosity among Germans.''
</P>
<P>
   With the German capital now back in Berlin, just 50 miles from a
border that was moved a long way westward at the end of World War
II, relations with Poland have become an important concern.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusually forceful statement issued Wednesday, Joschka
Fischer, the German foreign minister, said that ``Germany believes
that measures must be taken to insure Poland's entry into the
European Union at the soonest possible date.''
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations on membership of the 15-member bloc have been
painstakingly slow. With Europe long focused on the introduction of
the single currency, the euro, and still concerned over competition
from former East bloc countries with cheaper labor, progress has
proved difficult.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder, who shares a growing German desire
to look forward rather than back, chose to defer Wednesday to Rau,
whose role is mainly ceremonial. But in remarks to journalists, the
chancellor said it should be remembered that Berlin is the city
``where the most hideous crime ever began.''
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder is to travel to Poland on Friday for two days of
meetings.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The chancellor has been criticized since taking office for
declining a French invitation last November to join World War I
armistice celebrations, for being absent from Parliament this
summer when a long-delayed project for a Berlin Holocaust memorial
was approved, and for not interrupting his summer vacation last
month to attend the burial in Israel of Ignatz Bubis, the leader of
the main German Jewish organization.
</P>
<P>
   But there can be little doubt that the chancellor's position _
acknowledgment and awareness of the past allied to a determination
to look beyond it _ reflects that of a large majority of Germans,
tired of being pilloried for crimes that took place before most of
them were born.
</P>
<P>
   Germany had hoped to reach a settlement by Wednesday for the
compensation of slave laborers and others forced to work by the
Nazis, but disagreements over the amount to be paid have stalled
the discussions. The issue is sensitive because many of the
laborers were Poles, and Rau said ``reconciliation'' would be
helped by an accord.
</P>
<P>
   Rau held a symbolic meeting with Aleksander Kwasniewski, the
Polish president, on the German-Polish border, before going on to
Gdansk, the city that was the object of the dawn barrage from the
battleship Schleswig-Holstein that started the war. Gdansk was then
Danzig, a port and free city populated largely by ethnic Germans.
</P>
<P>
   At the Gdansk ceremony, Kwasniewski recalled that six million
Polish citizens died in World War II _ about half of them were
Jews. ``Shalom!,'' he said. ``I turn to the Jews among you, to the
victims of the Holocaust, and descendants of a common fate. You
sentenced to death by Nazism _ the world must never forget.''
</P>
<P>
   In the light of frequent tensions between Catholic Poles and
Jews over the extent of their respective suffering in World War II,
Kwasniewski's allusion to ``a common fate'' appeared a significant
sign of Poland's determination to put such friction behind it.
</P>
<P>
   A German veteran of the Schleswig-Holstein, Martin Menzel, said,
``I now understand what the war was and I ask for forgiveness.''

 NEW YORK: Bull said.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the early 1980s, before frames increased in price, Roger
Ward, the curator of European art at the Nelson-Atkins Museum, made
a list of the 20 most difficult to frame paintings in his
collection. ``The price I paid then for a period frame couldn't
even pay for a reproduction now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The Nelson-Atkins was one of the first museums to
comprehensively reframe major portions of its Old Masters and
European art collection.
</P>
<P>
   Ward said that 60 of his paintings now wear antique frames.
</P>
<P>
   One of his prized paintings, Caravaggio's ``St. John the
Baptist,'' had been framed in a spindly 18th-century tapestry
molding that had been cobbled together. Ward found a 16th-century
Italian altarpiece frame that was appropriate to the scale and
color of the painting.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since this was originally stuck in a stone altar, this frame
is as close to the original as I could get,'' he said. When he
bought the frame in 1987 it cost just over $26,000. ``It would cost
a lot more now,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ward said he realized that he is luckier than most museum
curators: ``I had sympathetic trustees and a sympathetic director.
I have an endowment for my department, which includes expenses for
things such as frames, so I don't have to find a donor for every
frame I want to buy.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Art Institute of Chicago, curators have been evaluating
the need to reframe gallery by gallery. With financial help from
the museum's Old Masters Society, a group of about 400 people, and
from the institute's director, curators have raised $125,000 for
the Dutch and Flemish galleries and are raising another $225,000
for reframing major works in the mid-19th-century galleries.
</P>
<P>
   The ``before and after'' presentations at the museum have
persuaded potential donors to help. To illustrate the difference an
appropriate frame can make, curators take Corot's ``Interrupted
Reading,'' an image of a woman looking up from her book. First they
show the painting in its original 17th-century Italian frame, which
had been stripped and painted a dull brown, presumably to match the
painting's background. Then they replace that frame with an 1870
Louis XIII-revival-style frame from Wiggins in London.
</P>
<P>
   ``It restores the balance between the background and the flesh
tones in the figure,'' said Gloria Groom, a curator in the museum's
department of European paintings. ``This is a frame the artist
would have put on the painting for an exhibition in a salon in the
second half of the 19th century.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum started to think about reframing nearly 10 years ago,
with the exhibition ``Monet in the 90s.'' ``When we put paintings
of similar subjects together we could actually see what was
historically and esthetically pleasing,'' Ms. Groom said. Some of
the original frames on works the museum borrowed, she said, opened
curators' eyes. ``Ninety-nine percent of the time we try to figure
out what the artist put the picture in himself,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
   The reframing project has been ``a consciousness-raising
exercise,'' said Douglas Druick, the senior curator of European
paintings at the Art Institute of Chicago. ``A lot of the Dutch
paintings that had entered the collection at the same time were
suffering under the weight of the robber-baron frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Curators don't always have the luxury of spending years seeking
the right period frame when they make changes gallery by gallery.
The Chicago museum has often had reproductions made. Of the six
Monet haystack paintings in their collection, two have their
original frames. The others have frames made by Mitchell, all
different but all based on the classical vocabulary of the Louis
XVI style.
</P>
<P>
   The museum's star painting, Seurat's ``Sunday Afternoon on la
Grande Jatte,'' still doesn't have a frame that satisfies curators.
They consider it too big, too round and too white. ``We feel we
need to revisit this,'' Ms. Groom said.
</P>
<P>
   While the designers who made the frame in 1989 took the shape
from the artist's rendition (Seurat is famous for his
impossible-to-match white frames), what they considered
historically correct then does not do justice to the painting.
``Historically correct doesn't always work,'' Ms. Groom said.
``It's difficult to age white because there's a patina you can't
get. We just have to keep experimenting.''
</P>
<P>
   What may be considered historically accurate and what an artist
would have wanted are not always what the public likes. In 1986
curators at the Baltimore Museum of Art removed the ornately carved
wood-and-cast-plaster frames from the fabled collection of Matisses
that had belonged to Dr. Claribel Cone, a Baltimore pathologist,
and her sister, Etta Cone, who bequeathed their collection to the
museum.
</P>
<P>
   They replaced the Cones' elaborate frames with simple strip
frames and stored the originals. Scholars applauded the museum's
boldness, but some visitors criticized the move.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, when Doreen Bolger became the museum's new director,
one of her first decisions was to restore the Cone sisters' frames.
``We know that Matisse made comments about not liking elaborate
frames, but there have been strong feelings in Baltimore that the
Cones' frames should go back on the Matisses,'' she said. ``When I
first saw them in strip frames I wanted to see the paintings in the
more traditional frames.''
</P>
<P>
   Archival pictures of the artist's studio show that Matisse put
his paintings in flat-edged strip frames, and in a letter that he
wrote in 1916 he said he was ``very opposed to frames and
particularly heavy frames that surround the paintings with a yellow
color, stopping all expansion.''
</P>
<P>
   He continued, ``A modern painting has no need for a frame: it
should have a simple border at most.''
</P>
<P>
   So who is right? ``We have to acknowledge changes in tastes and
no doubt tastes will change again; it's cyclical,'' Ms. Bolger
said. ``Framing is definitely subject to interpretation.''
</P>
<P>
   One reason museums are saddled with frames that do not do
justice to their paintings is that many of the world's most famous
dealers during the last two centuries _ figures like Joseph Duveen
and Paul Durand-Ruel _ put paintings in imposing gilt frames to
impress their nouveau-riche clients.
</P>
<P>
   The scroll-shaped corners of a Durand-Ruel frame, for example,
can be instantly identified by any seasoned curator. Their
flourishes served a purpose. When a painting looked more impressive
framed in heavy gilt, it could command a higher price. Ornately
carved gilt frames were also used to tame what were considered wild
Impressionist paintings, and they went well with the fine
18th-century French furniture that was the decorating trend of the
moment.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, however, artists
became involved in framing. Whistler refused to allow anyone to
design his frames and made simple ones himself. Some
Impressionists, particularly Pissarro and Degas, put their pictures
in plain white, gray, yellow and even purple frames of their own
design. Post-Impressionist artists like Seurat, van Gogh and
Gauguin made frames that in colors that complemented their
paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Today there are no rules for what makes an appropriate frame,
although curators are mindful of a painting's history.

MUSEUMS LOOK AGAIN AT THEIR PICTURE FRAMES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By CAROL VOGEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a hushed gallery at the Brooklyn Museum of Art,
Elizabeth Easton, the curator of European paintings, and Jared
Bark, the founder of Bark Frameworks in SoHo, were huddled around a
Sisley landscape. The talk was not about the painting, but of its
Louis XV-style reproduction gilt frame festooned with intricately
carved flowers, swags and shells. ``Look how the frame overpowers
the painting,'' said Ms. Easton. ``It's just too Louie-Schmooie.''
</P>
<P>
   Dissatisfied with the frames on many of the pictures in their
collections, museum curators from Brooklyn to Kansas City, Mo., are
caught up in a flurry of costly reframing projects. At the
Nelson-Atkins Museum of Art in Kansas City the curator of European
paintings has spent $500,000 to reframe 75 paintings. The National
Gallery of Art in Washington paid $60,000 to put a 17th-century
walnut frame on Rembrandt's ``Man in Oriental Costume,'' the most
it has ever paid for a frame. At the Art Institute of Chicago
curators do a special ``before and after'' presentation to
encourage benefactors to support the cost of reframing paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Increasingly, as museums across the country expand, works that
have languished in storage are being re-evaluated. In today's
robust art market, curators can no longer afford to buy paintings
as often as they once could, so they try to make the best of what
they have. Sometimes a painting brought back into view has a frame
deemed hopelessly out of fashion; or a painting, framed to enhance
a donor's decor, just doesn't work in a museum. But scholarship
also plays a role. In recent years curators armed with new
information about how artworks were originally framed are becoming
fussier about authenticity
</P>
<P>
   So now, in addition to raising money for exhibitions,
acquisitions and expansions, curators are also trying to convince
donors that the right frame, which can cost tens of thousands of
dollars, is not just window dressing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Framing has always been a business,'' said Keith Christiansen,
a curator of European painting at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.
``But now there's big money in it.'' Like the price of all
antiques, those of frames from the 17th through 19th centuries have
escalated in the last decade. The most expensive and hardest to
find are the simple, hand-carved 17th-century frames that curators
covet.
</P>
<P>
   In London, at the Bond Street gallery of Paul Mitchell, frames
of all ages, sizes and styles line every available inch of wall.
Mitchell's business is booming largely because of work from
American museums. ``It's a ripple effect,'' Mitchell said. ``Once a
curator changes a frame on one picture he wants to keep going.''
When one curator learns that a colleague at a competing museum is
reframing a collection, he suddenly wants to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   In art history books, pictures are shown, but rarely their
frames, Mitchell said. ``Famous paintings are cataloged from head
to toe, but about their frames you know nothing,'' he said.
``That's because art history books only show the picture. They
don't show the frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Some artists have had definite ideas about how their works
should be framed, but this information is also rarely documented.
</P>
<P>
   So framers like Mitchell compiled their own historical
references. He has systematically photographed pictures in their
frames and created an archive of more than 40,000 paintings from
museums, private collections, exhibitions and auctions worldwide.
He also uses computer imaging to show clients how one painting
might look with different frames.
</P>
<P>
   ``Few paintings have withstood the ravages of time in their
original frame,'' he said. ``Generally Old Masters have been
divorced from their frames, either because of change of ownership,
transport (it's easier to ship a painting without its frame) or
changing tastes in interior decoration.''
</P>
<P>
   Every artistic movement has produced its own style of frame. The
earliest frames, from the Renaissance, were merely protective edges
for religious paintings and were extensions of the painting. The
conception of frames as separate from the painting began in Italy
during the 16th century. By the 19th century frame making had
become a growth industry as the new middle class framed everything
from paintings to lithographs.
</P>
<P>
   At the National Gallery of Art in Washington, a frame committee
of four museum staff members _ David Bull, a senior consultant in
the conservation department; Philip Conisbee, senior curator of
European paintings; Mark Leithauser, chief of design, and Alan
Shestack, deputy director and chief curator _ was formed 10 years
ago to reduce the chances of choices based purely on personal
taste.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before we change a frame all of us have to agree,'' Bull said.
Since 1990 the National Gallery has reframed some 200 paintings and
plans to do 200 more.
</P>
<P>
   Because it is so large, the museum has a growing computer
database that consists of some 3,000 frames in its collection.
Along with images and detailed descriptions of each frame are
conservators' reports. ``We look within our own collection first
whenever we decide to reframe something,'' Conisbee said.
</P>
<P>
   When the committee members decided to find a new frame for
Degas' ``Three Dancers,'' for instance, they discovered the perfect
one in their storeroom. It was designed by Degas and was originally
on the painting, which had been badly reframed by a dealer by the
time it came to the museum in the 1940s. Luckily the original frame
accompanied the painting. Because museum policy is never to throw
out a frame, conservators were able to restore the more restrained
Degas frame.

   ``We don't get rid of frames just in case 50 years from now
people think we've made a mistake,'' Leithauser said. ``This way
they can easily change something.''
</P>
<P>
   For Dutch Old Masters, reframing can be a challenge because
large 17th-century frames rarely exist. ``In the 19th century
dealers and collectors took off the original 17th-century black
frames believing they were too somber and devoid of decoration,''
Leithauser said. ``If you were a collector with a Rembrandt, you
wanted a frame that said, `I am a Rembrandt.' The older frames were
therefore scrapped or burned.''
</P>
<P>
   For van Eyck's ``Annunciation,'' which is 36{ inches by just
over 14] inches, the committee studied the original frames that
they found on paintings by the same artist. One in the National
Gallery of Art in London became the basis for a reproduction.
</P>
<P>
   But the gallery was able to find a perfect match for Rembrandt's
``Man in Oriental Costume,'' a 17th-century frame costing $60,000
from Guttman Frames. It replaced the overpowering gold frame that
was on the painting when the museum acquired it. The men have no
regrets. ``Compared to what the painting is worth, it's cheap,''
Bull said.

WORKING AMERICANS SUPPORT BUSH OVER GORE

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite his ardent courtship of organized labor and
his emphasis on workplace issues, Vice President Al Gore trails
Texas Gov. George W. Bush among working Americans, according to a
poll being released Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The survey by Rutgers University in New Jersey and the
University of Connecticut found that in head-to-head competition
Bush beat Gore 49 percent to 34 percent.
</P>
<P>
   When other candidates were considered, Bush still had a solid
plurality, garnering 32 percent compared with 23 percent for Gore,
according to the poll, which surveyed 1,000 randomly selected
Americans who are employed or looking for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the frontrunners were Republican Elizabeth Dole with 10
percent, Democrat Bill Bradley with 6 percent and Sen. John McCain,
R-Ariz., with 3 percent. The survey was conducted between July 30
and Aug. 12.
</P>
<P>
   ``This definitely is something of a wake-up call for the Gore
campaign,'' said Carl E. Van Horn, a political science professor at
Rutgers and co-director of the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn said the main reason for Gore's deficit is that working
Americans have given him ``little credit'' for the booming economy
and low unemployment.
</P>
<P>
   When asked how much credit should be given to Gore for the
health of the economy, 8 percent responded ``a lot,'' 44 percent
said ``some'' and 31 percent said ``not at all.'' Asked about any
credit due Clinton, 25 percent said ``a lot'' and 44 percent said
``some.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, Gore is remembered more as the man who supported
Clinton through impeachment than as an architect of the surging
economy,'' Van Horn said.
</P>
<P>
   He also said Gore has been hindered by a common problem for vice
presidents who run for president: he is considered ``the weak
family member.''
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn added, ``Let's face it, the job of vice president is
not a glamorous position designed to make you look like you're the
one in charge. And that image takes time to shake.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, the only groups of working Americans to
support Gore over Bush were minority workers, those making less
than $10,000 a year and those identifying themselves as Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has won the endorsement of the Communications Workers of
America, the International Association of Firefighters and the
United Transportation Union, as well as several chapters of the
American Federation of State, County and Municipal Workers.
</P>
<P>
   Kiki Moore, a Gore spokeswoman, downplayed the poll results,
saying the presidential campaign is in its ``early stages'' and
that most voters have yet to hear where the candidates stand on
issues important to working Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only thing these numbers reflect is the fact that most
voters are still learning what Al Gore and George Bush are saying
about things like health care coverage and education,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Van Horn said a ``silver lining'' in the poll for Gore was that
a large number of working Americans _ 27 percent _ said they were
unsure which candidate would handle the economy best. ``There is
still time for the vice president to turn this situation around,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, the top issue for working Americans is
education. Ninety percent of those surveyed said improving the
nation's schools and increasing the number of programs to retrain
workers for high-tech jobs are the most important tasks facing the
next president.
</P>
<P>
   Poll respondents listed other critical issues as expanding
medical coverage, protecting retirement benefits and ensuring
economic security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unlike past elections, working people today are not terribly
worried about finding a job,'' Van Horn said. ``Instead, they're
worried about the future _ both their and their children's
future.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll was conducted by the Heldrich Center for Workforce
Development at Rutgers and the Center for Survey Research and
Analysis at the University of Connecticut.

CHURCH RECOVERS BELLS, A GIFT OF RUSSIAN CZAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Complete writethru to reflect that bells recovered; edits to
conform.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MALCOLM GLOVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three bells that were the gift of a 19th-century
Russian czar were returned to the Orthodox Holy Trinity Cathedral
on Wednesday, four days after they disappeared from the bell tower.
</P>
<P>
   They were among five bells that were given to the San Francisco
church _ the oldest Eastern Orthodox parish in the continental
United States _ in 1888 by Czar Alexander III.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Victor Sokolov said the bells were found on the front
steps of the church, at Van Ness Avenue and Green Street, at 8 a.m.
Wednesday by painters who were repairing damage from an arson fire
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov said a man went to the church and said he had the bells,
``but emphasized that he hadn't stolen them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov said the man told his daughter that he had bought the
bells from another man ``on the street'' for $250. He said he
didn't realize that they had been stolen until he read about it in
the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The man did not have the bells with him but said that he would
return them to the church. He apparently returned them sometime
late Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning, Sokolov said.
</P>
<P>
   The bells did not appear to be damaged, Sokolov said.
</P>
<P>
   Cast in Moscow, the heavy bells adorned with decorative
scrollwork are believed to be unique in the United States and rare
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Choir members noticed the bells missing when they prepared to
ring them before the 6 p.m. service on Saturday. At first they
thought painters might have moved them, but an extensive search of
the building failed to turn them up.
</P>
<P>
   After a call to the painting company confirmed that workers had
not moved the bells, church officials notified the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never imagined somebody actually stealing them,'' said
Robert A. Parent, the choir director of the church. ``Why would
anybody want to? I cannot imagine what kind of value they would
have to people other than to the church itself and to San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   A silver alloy was used to cast them, providing an unusually
pure, distinct tone not found in modern-day bells, Sokolov said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an art form,'' he said. ``Nothing exists today of this
caliber anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The church and its bells are a popular attraction in the city.
Guides regularly begin their tours by listening to the bells every
Sunday at 10 a.m. at Van Ness Avenue and Green Street.
</P>
<P>
   The bell tower stands some 50 feet off the ground, and normally
is accessible only from inside the church. The doors of the church
are locked and protected by an alarm system.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 days, however, parts of the two-story wooden
church have been undergoing repairs needed after a fire on Easter
Day 1998. The unsolved arson destroyed parts of the church and
caused $20,000 in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials suspect the scaffolding surrounding the
building and covered by a dark green canvas provided easy access
and shelter to thieves.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the five Russian bells, two others cast in the
same time period in the United States make up the complete set of
seven bells.
</P>
<P>
   Each bell represents a different tone, the smallest bell of
about 10 inches in diameter providing the lighter sounds, while the
largest ``Great Bell'' provides deeper tones.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone absconding with a bell would need to cut or untie the
cables and clamps supporting it from the beams of the tower and
then either carry it down the narrow scaffolding or lower it,
perhaps with a rope.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov said the theft would be an impossible feat for one
person, and a difficult task for two.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials have moved some of the bells inside but left
the two largest _ one of them weighing 5,765 pounds and presumably
too heavy to steal without heavy machinery.

DECEASED AUTHORS CONTINUE TO PUBLISH
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JEFF GUINN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Their tombstones might read: ``Dead, but still being
published.'' Recent bestseller lists have included fiction by Ralph
Ellison and Ernest Hemingway. This summer, critics have raved about
a short-story collection from Dashiell Hammett.
</P>
<P>
   Among the most anticipated books of the fall are new titles from
Jack Kerouac and Sir Winston Churchill, with the latest John
Steinbeck title just a few years away.
</P>
<P>
   These authors have two things in common: Each was lionized in
life, and each has just been published or is about to be published
years after his death. Their modern-day publishers, from Knopf to
Random House to Scribner, are secure in the knowledge that there's
always a ready market for previously unavailable work by famous
deceased authors, and that the quality doesn't necessarily matter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It ranges from treasures to curiosities, just like what you
might come across in Grandmother's attic,'' says Charles Scribner,
whose company has published seven books by Hemingway since the
legendary ``Papa's'' death in 1961.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a story about a former president that is appropriate
here,'' Scribner says. ``The widow of Warren G. Harding said of her
late husband, `He was great in life and even greater in death.'
Sometimes that is true of authors, as well.''
</P>
<P>
   It seems that readers are always ready to snap up anything
``new'' by their favorite dead authors.
</P>
<P>
   ``In cases like Ellison and Hemingway and Hammett, there are
always fans out there who love them and must have any new books by
them,'' says Michael Millman, an editor at Penguin/Putnam, which
will publish a collection of Kerouac's early, previously
unpublished stories in November under its Viking imprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``It often seems immaterial whether it's of high quality or just
any old thing pulled out of a shoe box by surviving family
members.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Juneteenth,'' gleaned from a 2,000-page work in progress by
Ellison when he died in 1994, received rave reviews when it was
published this summer. Hemingway's ``True at First Light,'' a
heavily edited retooling of a novel he began and discarded some 40
years ago, was savaged by critics but still made most bestseller
lists. Hammett's ``Nightmare Town'' is expected to do the same.
</P>
<P>
   Random House senior editor Scott Moyers, who worked on Ellison's
``Juneteenth,'' says he felt ``responsibility to the author, the
author's estate and fans not to exploit his reputation. You want to
do right by the author, and also sell books to pay the light
bills.''
</P>
<P>
   Posthumous publishing is nothing new; a famous example is ``The
Mystery of Edwin Drood,'' cited by many as one of the earliest
``modern'' mystery stories. It was written by Charles Dickens, who
died in 1870 without completing the tale. His editors finished the
work on his behalf, and grieving fans rushed to buy it.
</P>
<P>
   But recent years have seen publishers intensify efforts to track
down anything from completed, hitherto-undiscovered manuscripts to
scraps of story ideas from famous authors. In many cases, family
members have come forward with material.
</P>
<P>
   ``If one of Hemingway's sons comes to Scribner and says, `Here's
a book by my dad, do you want to publish it?' do you think Scribner
is going to turn him down?'' says an editor at a rival publishing
house who did not want his name used.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Tolkien, son of J.R.R. Tolkien, has edited nearly a
dozen new works by his father since the elder Tolkien's death in
1973. ``The Hobbit'' and the ``Lord of the Rings'' trilogy made
Tolkien a household name in the '60s and '70s, although these
eventually revered titles were published from the '30s through the
'50s.
</P>
<P>
   In death far more than in life, Tolkien has been prolific. His
post-1973 titles include ``The Book of Lost Tales,'' ``The Book of
Lost Tales, Part II,'' ``The Simarillion,'' and ``Morgoth's Ring:
The Later Simarillion,'' among others. All were welcomed by Tolkien
die-hards.
</P>
<P>
   Unfinished works by Edith Wharton and Dame Agatha Christie have
been resurrected, spruced up and published in recent years. Critics
were routinely unkind. But sometimes, books by dead writers have
been proclaimed classics.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, a frustrated would-be writer named John Kennedy Toole
committed suicide at age 32. His novel-in-progress had been
rejected by a series of publishers.
</P>
<P>
   Toole's mother badgered anyone who she thought might help get
her late son's book into print. Finally, author Walker Percy agreed
to read the manuscript. Through his championing of the work, LSU
Press published ``A Confederacy of Dunces'' in 1980, working from
the manuscript Toole had considered finished but other, larger
publishing houses judged unsuitable. ``Dunces'' won the Pulitzer
Prize for fiction.
</P>
<P>
   For publishers, anniversaries are an opportune time to unveil
works by well-known deceased authors. ``True at First Light'' was
published, in part, to take advantage of publicity about
Hemingway's 100th birthday in July.
</P>
<P>
   Sources at Viking have confirmed what industry insiders have
suspected for months: that in 2002, the Steinbeck centenary will
probably feature a new collection of his nonfiction works, possibly
newspaper and magazine articles collected in hardcover for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   But industry insiders say this isn't a trend. ``It has been
going on for a long, long time,'' says Moyers of Random House,
whose current projects include the final editing of ``The Great
Republic: A History of the United States'' by Sir Winston
Churchill, which comprises material selected by Winston Spencer
Churchill from his grandfather's Nobel Prize-winning, four-volume
``A History of the English Speaking People.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   On a recent sweltering Monday evening, nearly 50 residents of
the Bay Ridge neighborhood in Brooklyn jammed into the living room
of a two-story brick row house to talk about problems like erosion
and rats in Owl's Head Park, 27 acres of trees and grass on the
Brooklyn waterfront. It was classic grass-roots organizing, more or
less the way it has been done for generations.
</P>
<P>
   But with every passing month, as more people go online,
community organizers are finding new ways to harness the power of
the Internet. The basics of organization _ using communication to
start a group or keep it together, and finding information that
will arm community organizers with data _ are, one by one, moving
into cyberspace. And individuals can also turn to those same
sources of information when they want to make their voices heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole notion of the Web is to try to get people
involved,'' said William Revelle, a psychology professor at
Northwestern University who says he maintains a page of links to
civic groups (pmc.psych.nwu.edu/civicpart99.html) because, well,
people with computers and civic interests should do that sort of
thing.
</P>
<P>
   Group members can stay in touch through a Web site or a
listserv, a kind of mass mailing possible through e-mail. Both
technologies have their advocates, but Web sites are indispensable
for gathering information. E-mail has also made it vastly easier to
get in touch with elected officials and civil servants.
</P>
<P>
   And because the Web shrinks both time and space, concerned
residents in places like Bay Ridge can turn to it for help,
regardless of whether they want a fenced dog run or Rudy Giuliani
or Hillary Clinton to be their next U.S. Senator.
</P>
<P>
   GROUP E-MAIL  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Before each monthly meeting of his coalition of antipoverty
groups in Philadelphia, a veteran community organizer and advocacy
consultant, Edward Schwartz, sends out mass mailings through
ordinary mail and through e-mail. ``Overwhelmingly, the people who
show up are the people on the e-mail list, even though our print
mail goes out to a far larger number of people,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Schwartz began his work as a community organizer when he was
still a teen-ager, nearly 40 years ago. From his perspective, the
real innovation that the computer revolution has provided is what
he calls ``the overlooked technology'': group e-mail, or listservs,
which is ``where the bulk of organizing occurs,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   If a new group's members can tolerate the advertisements,
Schwartz recommends that the group start an e-mail group free
through www.egroups.com. (Egroups will let you set up a group
without the ads, but it charges $4.95 a month.) Setting up a group
takes 10 minutes or less.
</P>
<P>
   The other way for a group to make its mark in cyberspace is with
a Web site from an organization like Neighborhood Link, which is
free but also has ads (www.neighborhoodlink.com).
</P>
<P>
   A group does not need a computer expert to build a page. Leave
HTML for power users: setting up a page today is no harder than
following the recipe for cookies on the back of the chocolate chips
bag. Service for community groups is a fast-growing areas of the
Internet, and new companies are getting into it almost weekly.
Alternatives to Neighborhood Link include Geocities
(geocities.yahoo.com/home), recently bought by Yahoo, and the
community section of America Online (aol.com/community/home.html).
</P>
<P>
   Is a Web site necessary, or will a listserv suffice? Reading
one's e-mail takes virtually no effort, while going onto the Web
requires at least some. On the other hand, on some listservs that
urgent note about the litter problem in the park can get lost amid
the neighbors' vacation pictures. In the end, though, the two
routes are not exclusive.
</P>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   RELIABLE INFORMATION  &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With thousands of Web sites out there talking politics, someone
seeking reliable political information is in the position
Archimedes described in the third century B.C.: ``Give me where to
stand and I will move the earth.''
</P>
<P>
   Finding such a place on the Net is getting easier because some
people and groups are, in effect, beginning to catalog the
worthwhile stuff. The best sources to begin with are often
universities, which have access not just to libraries but to good
reference librarians.
</P>
<P>
   A particularly helpful site for citizen surfers is Grace A.
York, the federal documents librarian at the University of Michigan
(www.lib.umich.edu/libhome/Documents.center/federal.html). A
handful of the links from her page are to databases that cost money
and are available only at the university, but the list of free and
universally available sites is among the most comprehensive, and
comprehensible, anywhere.
</P>
<P>
   Another reference librarian, Gary Price, at George Washington
University in Washington maintains a number of Web sites, including
something called Direct Search
(gwis2.circ.gwu.edu/gprice/direct.htm), an eclectic almanac of
information that general search engines (Google, Alta Vista, etc.)
are apt to miss. And a linked state site,
(gwis2.circ.gwu.edu/gprice/state.htm), is also a good place to go
for local and state government sources.
</P>
<P>
   For reliable, meat-and-potatoes political information, research
experts nearly all recommend Project Vote Smart
(www.vote-smart.org). There's no place in the government sites to
find an easy assessment of the voting records of members of
Congress, but on this site, you can track 13,000 voting records,
for them as well as state officials. It's so good that even the
federal government's own congressional portal, Thomas, named for
Thomas Jefferson and his famous advocacy of the free flow of
government information (thomas.loc.gov), recommends it. Vote Smart
is paid for by foundation grants and individual memberships.
</P>
<P>
   Public Agenda, also paid for primarily by foundations rather
than ads, offers as serious and sober a look at public-policy
questions as one could ask for (publicagenda.org). On each of a
score of major issues like crime, the economy, education, Internet
speech and privacy, the site offers an overview, recent articles on
the topic and, especially useful, extended arguments for and
against the major positions on the topic.
</P>
<P>
   The other major plus to this site is its polling primer, which
is understandable because the organization's co-founder (along with
the former Secretary of State, Cyrus R. Vance) is Daniel
Yankelovich, the pollster. The site gives tells you how to figure
out if a poll is reliable, listing 20 things you should know about
a poll before making up your mind.
</P>
<P>
   Another site, politics1.com, is favored by academics and policy
wonks. It has hundreds of links to all manner of political sites.
(Be careful with the section that auctions political buttons. The
prices tend to be much higher than the same items go for on Ebay or
on specialized political collectors' auction sites.)
</P>
<P>
   Policy.com, has an impressive list of annotated links, and many
scholars point to it as an example of a good gateway, or portal, to
the world of politics and policy. A caveat: the annotations are
provided by the groups themselves. Thus, the descriptions of two
media watchdog groups, Accuracy in Media and Fairness and Accuracy
in Reporting, sound very similar. AIM says its goal is to ``combat
political and ideological bias in the news media'' while FAIR says
it ``offers well-documented criticism in an effort to correct media
bias.'' There's no hint until you go there that AIM is a
conservative organization, and only a fairly oblique hint in the
FAIR description that it is liberal.
</P>
<P>
   The Web also provides a fairly easy way for readers and viewers
to check up on the accuracy of the news stories they've been
watching and viewing, said John Coleman, a political science
professor at the University of Wisconsin at Madison. ``You can see
some of the data yourself,'' Coleman said. ``You can dig into the
numbers as minimally or as heavily as you want.'' Polling Report,
for one, provides a wealth of raw polling data (pollingreport.com).
</P>
<P>
   For the adventurous who want to surf for information on their
own, experts say sites offer a few clues to their nature and
reliability. A good site will say who owns it, who maintains it and
when it was last updated. Be suspicious of any site that doesn't
make these things clear.
</P>
<P>
   VIEWS LEFT AND RIGHT
</P>
<P>
   The 19th-century British politician and philosopher John Stuart
Mill recommended reading and hearing arguments counter to one's own
beliefs as the best way to keep one's own arguments sharp and
convictions keen. Otherwise, he said, beliefs degenerate into
``dead dogma.''
</P>
<P>
   For those people, or for those believers who want to hear the
righteous word redux, the Web offers two nice portals. On the left,
www.commondreams.org leads to a huge collection of straight wire
services (Associated Press, Agence France-Presse, Reuters, United
Press International, etc.), as well as progressive sources
(Alternet, Utne Reader, etc.) and liberal commentary ranging
(alphabetically, not politically) from Eric Alterman, a columnist
for The Nation and MSNBC, to Dave Zweifel, editor of The Capital
Times in Madison, Wis. There are also links to a flock of daily
newspapers and to various political sites in Washington, including
the home pages of both major political parties.
</P>
<P>
   On the right, www.rightnow.org has a list of links to
conservative news sources (it includes Fox News, calling it ``not
as liberal as CNN'') and to categories of conservative sites about
anti-abortion efforts, libertarians and the U.S. Taxpayers Party. A
category called Labor leads to links on how to break unions and how
union members can get out of paying for lobbying efforts for
pro-labor causes. An introduction to the news list explains that
its ``news sources either have a conservative slant, or at the very
least they are not as liberal as the majority of the major media.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the merits of the left and the right politically, the
right has generally had far better Web sites. Compare the visually
attractive, well-organized National Rifle Association's site
(nra.org) with, say, the League of Women Voters site (lwv.org). The
league site is, well, serviceable. Its new Webmaster, Jennifer
Recine, said she was working with Web designers to spiff up the
look.

   CONGRESSIONAL DATA
</P>
<P>
   What is most remarkable about the Web is what's not available,
at least not easily. Guidance is especially needed for Web sleuths
heading in the direction of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   While Congress provides a wealth of valuable information, it
does not make available voting records for members of Congress, as
basic a piece of political information as a voter is apt to want.
Nor does it provide an easy way to get members' e-mail addresses,
although nearly all members of Congress now have them.
</P>
<P>
   The sites available through the Thomas site (thomas.loc.gov)
list roll call votes on individual bills, but nowhere on the
government's site is that information sliced the other way to show
how an individual member has voted across a career.
</P>
<P>
   The Thomas site contends that since many votes are voice votes,
any attempt to list the voting record of a senator or
representative would be incomplete. An e-mail question to the
Thomas Webmaster asking why this is so, since Thomas' own site
acknowledges that citizens want this kind of information, brought a
response citing the Thomas page with a link to Project Vote Smart
(www.vote-smart.org), which does have the information.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to use the government's own information to find out
your congressman's voting record, Thomas recommends that you call
up vote after vote after vote and make manual notes on how that
person voted until you have a complete record. Thanks, Tom.
</P>
<P>
   Those outside government service suspect that this is not an
oversight.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was done on purpose,'' said Bruce Maxwell, who has
written or edited more than a dozen books on Internet
information-gathering. ``It took years for Congress to put any type
of voting data online. It has only become available recently, long
after all the other congressional stuff was posted. Congress now
has the best of all worlds: it can proudly crow that the voting
data is online for all Americans, while at the same time making it
inaccessible for all practical purposes.''
</P>
<P>
   Playing peek-a-boo with voting records, of course, makes it
tough for voters to tell if a representative or senator's
contentions in re-election speeches are strictly legitimate.
Committee votes are also not recorded on the site.
</P>
<P>
   Until relatively recently, members of Congress did not even have
their e-mail addresses and phone numbers listed on the Web. They're
still not in one place, to reduce unwanted mass mailings, said
Grace A. York, the federal documents librarian at the University of
Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. York prides herself on having perhaps the nation's most
current list of Congressional e-mail addresses. For years, she
said, Congress had no such lists at all. Even after the House put
up its own list, she said, ``It didn't maintain it very well.''
</P>
<P>
   The Center for Democracy and Technology, a Washington
organization that pressures Congress to release more information,
has a couple of interesting pages, one a quick guide to locating
federal government data (but not as comprehensive or attractive as
the Michigan site), the other a list, generated by write-in
suggestions from the public, of federal information that is public
record but not on the Web (www.cdt.org/righttoknow/10mostwanted).
The list reminds us that it will still be awhile before citizen
surfers can find everything they want to know online.

CHURCH RECOVERS BELLS, A GIFT OF RUSSIAN CZAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: SUBS lede to reflect bells discovered missing sted
disappeared; pickup: They were.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MALCOLM GLOVER  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Three bells that were the gift of a 19th-century
Russian czar were returned to the Orthodox Holy Trinity Cathedral
on Wednesday, four days after they were discovered missing from the
bell tower.
</P>
<P>
   They were among five bells that were given to the San Francisco
church _ the oldest Eastern Orthodox parish in the continental
United States _ in 1888 by Czar Alexander III.
</P>
<P>
   The Rev. Victor Sokolov said the bells were found on the front
steps of the church, at Van Ness Avenue and Green Street, at 8 a.m.
Wednesday by painters who were repairing damage from an arson fire
in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov said a man went to the church and said he had the bells,
``but emphasized that he hadn't stolen them.''
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov said the man told his daughter that he had bought the
bells from another man ``on the street'' for $250. He said he
didn't realize that they had been stolen until he read about it in
the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   The man did not have the bells with him but said that he would
return them to the church. He apparently returned them sometime
late Tuesday night or early Wednesday morning, Sokolov said.
</P>
<P>
   The bells did not appear to be damaged, Sokolov said.
</P>
<P>
   Cast in Moscow, the heavy bells adorned with decorative
scrollwork are believed to be unique in the United States and rare
in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Choir members noticed the bells missing when they prepared to
ring them before the 6 p.m. service on Saturday. At first they
thought painters might have moved them, but an extensive search of
the building failed to turn them up.
</P>
<P>
   After a call to the painting company confirmed that workers had
not moved the bells, church officials notified the police.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never imagined somebody actually stealing them,'' said
Robert A. Parent, the choir director of the church. ``Why would
anybody want to? I cannot imagine what kind of value they would
have to people other than to the church itself and to San
Francisco.''
</P>
<P>
   A silver alloy was used to cast them, providing an unusually
pure, distinct tone not found in modern-day bells, Sokolov said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an art form,'' he said. ``Nothing exists today of this
caliber anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   The church and its bells are a popular attraction in the city.
Guides regularly begin their tours by listening to the bells every
Sunday at 10 a.m. at Van Ness Avenue and Green Street.
</P>
<P>
   The bell tower stands some 50 feet off the ground, and normally
is accessible only from inside the church. The doors of the church
are locked and protected by an alarm system.
</P>
<P>
   For the past 10 days, however, parts of the two-story wooden
church have been undergoing repairs needed after a fire on Easter
Day 1998. The unsolved arson destroyed parts of the church and
caused $20,000 in damage.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials suspect the scaffolding surrounding the
building and covered by a dark green canvas provided easy access
and shelter to thieves.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the five Russian bells, two others cast in the
same time period in the United States make up the complete set of
seven bells.
</P>
<P>
   Each bell represents a different tone, the smallest bell of
about 10 inches in diameter providing the lighter sounds, while the
largest ``Great Bell'' provides deeper tones.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone absconding with a bell would need to cut or untie the
cables and clamps supporting it from the beams of the tower and
then either carry it down the narrow scaffolding or lower it,
perhaps with a rope.
</P>
<P>
   Sokolov said the theft would be an impossible feat for one
person, and a difficult task for two.
</P>
<P>
   Church officials have moved some of the bells inside but left
the two largest _ one of them weighing 5,765 pounds and presumably
too heavy to steal without heavy machinery.

COLOR TV? IT COULD LOOK MOSTLY WHITE THIS FALL

<TEXT>
<P>
   SARASOTA, Fla. _ Turn on your television during most times of
the day, and you're likely to find a diverse world of people, from
white talk-show hosts to black newscasters and Hispanic soap stars.
</P>
<P>
   But when the new prime-time TV season begins in September, the
color will look a little bland.
</P>
<P>
   The six broadcast networks _ ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC, UPN and The WB
_ are introducing 38 new series this fall, but 29 of them have no
minority characters in the pilots. Only two of the shows are built
around minority characters (``The Parkers'' and ``Grown Ups'').
</P>
<P>
   Remove UPN and The WB from the mix and the results are even more
distressing.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing.
</P>
<P>
   The 26 new shows on ABC, CBS, Fox and NBC amount to a
whitewashing of television.
</P>
<P>
   Network executives say it's an unfortunate coincidence of
timing. Producers claim they cast the best people they can find,
regardless of ethnicity.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of people aren't buying the excuses, least of all the
NAACP, which lodged a formal complaint and challenge in mid-July,
days before TV critics began their annual summer network press tour
in Pasadena, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Kweise Mfume, president of the National Association for the
Advancement of Colored People, said that his organization would
open an office in Hollywood to monitor the progress toward
integrating TV series, an effort that could lead to a boycott of
programs and sponsors that remain segregated. He also called for
meetings with network leaders that eventually were held earlier
this month.
</P>
<P>
   The NAACP challenge was a main topic during three weeks of
Television Critics Association news conferences with network
executives, show creators, writers and stars. Early on, some
participants seemed shocked by the tone and frequency of the
questions, but by the end, executives were prepared with press
release-style answers of all that they're doing to counteract the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   No person or group, including the NAACP, will claim that every
show has to feature multiracial casts (that would certainly wipe
out many of the mostly black shows that have made UPN and The WB
popular among African-American viewers). But something clearly must
change if network television is going to resemble more closely the
diversity of the nation as a whole.
</P>
<P>
   You'll still find Bill Cosby, Della Reese, D.L. Hughley, Brandy,
Hector Elizando and other actors of color on returning shows. And
NBC has Jesse L. Martin (Ally McBeal's former boyfriend) on the new
spinoff, ``Law &AMP; Order: Special Victims Unit.'' But in a surprise
twist, gay characters seem to have a stronger presence this fall
than blacks and Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   You might forgive some producers or creators if their shows are
all-white, like ``Friends.'' We are, after all, a society that is
still segregated, although it is difficult to understand how
attractive, white professionals in a big city like New York can
live without ever encountering ethnic minorities.
</P>
<P>
   But how can you overlook what Aaron Sorkin has done in the pilot
for one of the season's best new dramas, ``The West Wing''? He has
created a show in a modern-day White House without any leading
black characters. That's unfathomable in this day and age. It's
difficult to imagine a president of any party or political bent not
being savvy enough to have an ethnically diverse staff.
</P>
<P>
   Could it be, as some claim, that network executives believe that
the majority of white viewers won't watch shows with black lead
characters? If so, how would you explain the success of ``The Cosby
Show'' or ``The Jeffersons'' in years past?
</P>
<P>
   Day after day at the press tour, critics were told that minority
characters were planned all along, but they just didn't make it
into pilots, some of which, admittedly, will be altered before you
get to see them.
</P>
<P>
   It got to the point that one of the critics won big laughs for
asking, ``Which character are you going to tell us you meant to
show all along that just didn't make it into the pilot?''
</P>
<P>
   Network executives took their turns offering mea culpas for the
lack of diversity, each offering his or her variation on comments
made by Fox Entertainment President Doug Herzog: ``I do believe we
want to put on the best shows possible, and I don't care if the
casts are blue, green, yellow, orange. I want to put on the best
shows....Should we be doing a better job of presenting a more
diversified front in terms of our programming? Absolutely. Is it
going to be a priority? Absolutely.''
</P>
<P>
   But what can executives and groups like the NAACP do when faced
with comments from a successful producer like Dick Wolf, who will
be introducing his ``Law &AMP; Order'' spinoff ``Special Victims Unit''
this fall on NBC? The two leads in the new police drama,
Christopher Meloni and Mariska Hargitay, are white.
</P>
<P>
   ``I really can't be very apologetic about my casting,'' said
Wolf. ``I mean, `New York Undercover' (his mid-1990s Fox series) is
the only minority lead show that's ever been renewed on network
television.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolf emphasized what others said about casting the best actors
for the roles.
</P>
<P>
   ``We looked at a lot of actors and they were not all-white, but
I am not going to put myself in a position for apologizing for not
casting an African-American or a Hispanic actor when there were
other actors who better fulfilled the structure and what the
creative idea was in the show,'' he said. ``But it was an open
casting call. I mean, the best actors got the job. I don't care if
they're white, black, Hispanic, Asian or any mixture thereof.''
</P>
<P>
   Leslie Moonves, president and chief executive of CBS Television,
said that for every show his network considers for a pilot, ``We
discuss the options for adding minority characters to that show, if
a role by necessity can be colorblind. And we do it every day of
our lives. By the same token, I don't think you can madate that in
every series, there will be a minority character member.''
</P>
<P>
   Moonves' comments actually exemplify the problem facing the
minority community. If the creators don't think about minority
actors when they're coming up with the ideas for the series, or
widening the racial mix from the beginning, does adding ethnic
characters amount to tokenism?
</P>
<P>
   Things can be taken to the extreme. In The WB's new family drama
``Safe Harbor,'' a pair of young twins who are supposed to be sons
of the star Gregory Harrison have been replaced with what the
creator calls ``cosmic twins.'' One is black and one is white.
</P>
<P>
   Characters have to fit the show and the setting. And then the
producers have to find actors who fit the roles they've created.
Keeping an open mind is sometimes helpful.
</P>
<P>
   Roselyn Sanchez is one Hispanic actress who got a role on a new
fall show, playing a rookie cop on the Fox series ``The Badland.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the script was written for a Latina. And I've seen
that so many times before that it's written for a Latina, but it
doesn't go to a Latina,'' said Sanchez, who acknowledged that her
heavy accent made her worry about losing the role.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just went there and I said I'm going to be very Latina and
I'm going to try to do my best. And they went for me. And I'm very
grateful. Any white person or black girl can do it, you know. I'm
just proud that they took the chance and went with a Puerto Rican
accent for real.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Creators also had trouble convincing critics that some of the
minority actors introduced at the sessions had been planned all
along, even if they weren't seen in the pilots that were shown to
advertisers in May and critics in late-June.
</P>
<P>
   Roger Kumble, executive producer of ``Manchester Prep,'' a Fox
series that won't debut until the winter, introduced Sean Patrick
Thomas as one of the additions to the series. Thomas, who is black,
was featured in the film ``Cruel Intentions,'' which inspired the
series, but Kumble said that having Thomas in the pilot would have
taken away from the focus on the three main characters.
</P>
<P>
   He has a point, but saying he wanted Thomas because he's ``a
phenomenal actor'' made that point sound hollow. There had to have
been some way that his character could have been included in the
pilot without distracting us from the main focus. That is, if
Thomas was planned for the show all along as we were told.
</P>
<P>
   In some cases, producers said they wanted to explore the
black/white issues that can arise in their shows.
</P>
<P>
   Judd Apatow, one of the creators of NBC's charming ``Freaks and
Greeks,'' based the high-school comedy-drama partially on his own
experiences. He went to an all-white high school, but some black
students entered the district before his graduation (the show is
set in 1980).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I want to explore that and how the dynamics changed
with new people in the school,'' Apatow said. ``So even though it's
mostly white now, we're going to address the issue when it comes
up.''
</P>
<P>
   Rationalization for casting decisions took on almost ludicrous
tones when Martin Sheen joined the rest of the cast for a session
on NBC's ``The West Wing.'' Sheen, whose real last name is Estevez,
plays the president in Aaron Sorkin's White House drama. He was
asked how it feels to be a symbol for diversity for Latinos on
television.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize I was a symbol,'' he said. ``I've been an
actor for 40 years. I've played all kinds of parts. I'm Hispanic by
birth and I'm Irish by trade,'' he said, referring to many roles
he's played as Irish-American characters.
</P>
<P>
   Aaron Sorkin, the creator of the show, took some knocks for the
pilot of his White House drama and its all-white cast, but
cautioned that critics and viewers shouldn't ``draw too big a
conclusion about this entire series from its first 42 minutes.
There are a lot of people we haven't met yet. These people aren't
going to be background scenery, nor will they be (as one critic
wrote) `kitchen help.'''
</P>
<P>
   He said the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff will be black,
as will one of the president's personal aides. Other characters
will be Hispanic and Asian, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his praise for the quality of his core cast re-emphasized
the ``cast-the-best-you-can'' theory, which only makes you wonder
more about why they're all white. There is no real answer.
</P>
<P>
   Well, there is an answer. TV and movie writer Don Roos told The
Los Angeles Times last month, ``You couldn't do better than grow up
Jewish and gay if you want to be in show business. And you couldn't
do worse if you (grew up) black and Protestant.'' That's because
gays and Jews have more positions of power than blacks, Latinos and
Asians in Hollywood. Opening up that power structure is really the
only way for any meaningful change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who develop and oversee network television
shows are white males who live in Malibu, Brentwood or Bel Air.
They don't know a lot of black people and they're not interested in
really writing those kinds of characters,'' said Paris Barclay, an
Emmy-winning director of ABC's ``NYPD Blue,'' and co-creator of the
midseason drama ``City of Angels.''
</P>
<P>
   Barclay, who is black and gay, created the show set at an
inner-city hospital with Steven Bochco, creator of some of the best
and most-acclaimed dramas in TV history.
</P>
<P>
   The solution, Barclay said, is to do what Bochco has done _
mentoring. ``None of the writers that we have on (`City of Angels')
have ever been on a staff before and half of them are
African-Americans and half of them are not. And these people are
getting a new experience, which is phenomenal and which is
something that we're always going to take with us as long as we're
in the business. If only other people in Steven's position took
that opportunity and took that time and sort of beat the bushes a
little bit more and found the young writers and directors who are
out there, and I'm telling you they're out there.''
</P>
<P>
   NBC shouldn't get all the blame in this issue. Consider its new
``Third Watch,'' in which five of the nine lead characters are
people of color.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Sassa, President of NBC West Coast, made a personal and
impassioned statement on the diversity issue. He is an
Asian-American himself, and recalls being angered ``growing up,
seeing David Carradine as a Chinese guy (as Kwai Chang Caine on
``Kung Fu'')''
</P>
<P>
   He wants more than just a diverse array of actors on screen.
Sassa said he wants ``meaningful diversity. You not only want to
see someone that looks like you on TV, you want to see someone that
is a role model, someone that you want to be with, someone that you
want to be like, someone that you want to aspire to be.''
</P>
<P>
   While some have suggested that the networks are only targeting
white viewers to appease advertising demands, Sassa said that makes
no sense. Networks make most of their money from their owned and
operated stations, he said. NBC has 13 such stations in such major
markets as New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia, Chicago, Miami and
Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The point is, these are all markets that have a higher
concentration of minority populations. It's totally within the
business sense _ it makes good business sense _ to try to reach
these minority groups in order to get bigger audiences. So it's not
only the right thing to do, but this is something that makes
business sense.''

CHINA PREPARES GRAND 50TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ERIK ECKHOLM   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEIJING _ China's Communist leaders have always loved a good
anniversary, which gives them a chance to portray the country
exactly as they want and to mobilize a good share of the
population.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, the 50th birthday of the People's Republic of China
this Oct. 1 has been vested with special value by leaders who want
to assure their people that the revolution has indeed been a
success. In addition, the extravaganzas have clearly been designed
to build up President Jiang Zemin as one of the titans of Communist
Party history.
</P>
<P>
   With some last-minute rushing, a surprising number of
construction projects set for completion by then appear to be on
schedule. Army tanks and troops, exemplary students, a float-load
of fashion models and hundreds of thousands more special honorees
have been out rehearsing the big day's parade and entertainment.
</P>
<P>
   About the only apparent hitch in the preparations has gone
unpublicized: the missing wax statue of Jiang at the Museum of the
Revolution on Tiananmen Square. The museum is commemorating the
50th with a special exhibit depicting ``Great Men of China,'' all
life-size in wax.
</P>
<P>
   First comes Deng Xiaoping, the late mastermind of China's
economic opening, standing beside the huge black car in which he
cruised China's anniversary celebrations in 1984, the year the
party approved the extension of the economic reforms from the
countryside to the cities. Later in this small show _ it only
features 10 heroes _ is a large showcase for Mao, the founding
father, gazing thoughtfully from a mountaintop.
</P>
<P>
   The final diorama, the only one intended to celebrate a living
hero, has a startlingly different backdrop: a painted skyline of
modern, high-rise Beijing, complete with an understated touch of
smog. But the red platform for Jiang's statue is glaringly empty.
</P>
<P>
   A wax statue of Jiang was made, but someone up high, it seems,
rejected it as unacceptable. None of the museum staff could say
exactly why.
</P>
<P>
   The preparations for Oct. 1 have not exactly turned Beijing into
``a big park,'' as one newspaper declared, but it has made it a
little less clogged and ugly.
</P>
<P>
   Several avenues and sidewalks have been widened and lined with
grass and billboards removed along Changan Avenue, the thoroughfare
that runs along Tiananmen Square. Around the city, thousands of
substandard houses and street stalls, most used by migrants from
rural China, have been knocked down.
</P>
<P>
   Reflecting the new environmental concerns here, the Communist
Party newspaper, People's Daily, reported enthusiastically that on
Oct. 1 people will see ``a new vision of blue skies, clear rivers,
green grass and broad avenues.'' Because that vision is a bit ahead
of reality, though, the government is using drastic measures to
create a Potemkin paradise.
</P>
<P>
   In particular, the authorities hope to temporarily suppress the
acrid smog that normally envelops Beijing. They have decreed that
from Sept. 21 to Oct. 1, more than 25 of the city's largest, most
polluting industries will be prohibited from burning coal and oil.
Many large trucks, farm vehicles and most out-of-city cars will be
barred from the city for 10 days or more.
</P>
<P>
   In another sign of the new China, the Oct. 1 parade of 140,000
people will include _ along with a major showing of troops, tanks
and the latest rockets _ a float bearing 30 leading fashion models.
For the first time, too, the parade will include handicapped people
in wheelchairs and a contingent of private businessmen.
</P>
<P>
   But Communism still reigns, and the flashy elements may be
overshadowed by more customary themes. The entire procession,
including more than 90 floats, will be divided into three sections,
each honoring a phase in the party's glorious history.
</P>
<P>
   The first will celebrate the ``arduous epic,'' as People's Daily
described it, of the creation of the People's Republic and its
initial three decades under Mao. The second will honor the
achievements of the Deng era, from the late '70s to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The third will begin with a float _ its design unannounced and
rather hard to imagine _ honoring the 15th Party Congress of 1997.
That is when Jiang stepped out of the shadow of the deceased Deng,
laying out his own version of further economic change. This third
section is expressly designed to honor the achievements of the
current leadership ``with Jiang Zemin at the core,'' as they say.
</P>
<P>
   The evening's dances and flag shows on Tiananmen Square, like
the parade set up for television cameras, will hew to the theme
``Congratulations, Motherland,'' said one of the chief planners,
Zhao Dongming. Two hours of entertainment will reach a climax with
the song titled ``Congratulations, Motherland.''
</P>
<P>
   The song will be accompanied by 100,000 dancers, said Zhao, who
when he is not planning national galas is head of the Beijing
Office of Spiritual Civilization. (This refers not to spirituality
but fighting unhealthy cultural influences.)
</P>
<P>
   Parade and dance practice has gone on for months, but in the
last two weeks the first two big on-site rehearsals, on Changan and
Tiananmen Square, took place, closing streets and disrupting
traffic for hours. In the first rehearsal, tanks rumbled along
Changan _ an eerie reminder to many onlookers of the suppression of
the demonstrations in Tiananmen Square in 1989, the last time large
numbers of tanks headed down this road.
</P>
<P>
   Hours before the second rehearsal, Saturday night, huge crowds
of would-be passengers formed at bus stops all over the city, as
hundreds and hundreds of buses were diverted to take students and
dancers to Tiananmen Square. But residents seem to accept the
repeated inconveniences with a shrug, typically saying, ``What can
you do? It's the 50th anniversary.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked why China is spending so much for the holiday, one of
Saturday night's gawkers, Zhu Chaochao, a 42-year-old engineer,
laughed and said, ``If you lived long enough in China you'd
understand.
</P>
<P>
   ``These things have implications for the present,'' he said of
the celebrations.
</P>
<P>
   At the Museum of the Revolution, the director of the wax
exhibit, Xu Yi, said ``It's not very likely'' that a new Jiang
figure will be ready by Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   ``The appearance of the figure is very important,'' she said,
``because leaders have to be shown at their best, fully reflecting
their place in the life of the country.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Xu said it seemed inconceivable to her that Jiang might have
personally inspected and rejected the initial rendition, but she
added, ``We have to listen to the opinions and suggestions of our
superiors.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This isn't an ordinary exhibition,'' she said. ``It has
historic significance.''

I WANT TO BE PRESIDENT BECAUSE ...
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Friday, Sept. 3)  
(mk) 
 By DAVID GRIMES   
 Sarasota (Fla.) Herald-Tribune   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   If you believe, as I do, that we should take lessons in good
government only from countries that have even more embarrassing sex
scandals than our own, then you will surely be delighted by this
idea from British Prime Minister Tony Blair.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to dismantle the heredity-based House of Lords,
Blair has ordered all 633 blue bloods to write a brief essay
explaining why the member would like to be in the House of Lords.
</P>
<P>
   Voters will presumably consider the essay, which must be 75
words or less, in determining which, if any, lords get to keep
their seats in an election later this year.
</P>
<P>
   Columnist Giles Coren of The Times of London was kind enough to
suggest the following essay for those lords who may be unaccustomed
to expressing themselves with such commonplace things as words and
sentences:
</P>
<P>
   ``Am proactive self-starter with good working knowledge of
estate management, horsemanship, dithering, dribbling and claret
drinking ... Have experience in the intricacies of the tax system _
specifically in relation to inheritance tax loopholes _ and
seller's knowledge of the art market.''
</P>
<P>
   Many lords are outraged by the essay rule, which just proves, to
me at least, that it's a wonderful idea, and one that would work
equally well for candidates running for office in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   A U.S. presidential campaign is a grueling affair for all
concerned, especially the voters. Although the election is still 14
months away, voters are already bored and cranky and would pay
money to get the thing over with tomorrow, if such a thing were
possible. Instead, we are doomed to watch millionaires in plaid
shirts and jeans holding press conferences in the middle of Iowa
pig farms to deny that they (the millionaires, not the pigs) have
ever used cocaine, or at least not recently.
</P>
<P>
   The present system is tedious and annoying and very expensive
without giving voters any useful information or any idea how the
candidate will pan out once elected.
</P>
<P>
   It would be better, or at least no worse, to simply require
candidates to submit a short essay one week before the election and
let voters use that to make their decision.
</P>
<P>
   All essays would be required, by law, to begin with the words
``I want to be president because ...'' but beyond that the
candidates are free to say whatever they want, as long as they say
it in 75 words or less.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates should feel free to borrow from the following
``form'' essay if they have trouble coming up with 75 words on
their own:
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be president because I have the (leadership,
fund-raising, coke-snorting) skills necessary to lead America into
the (17th, 19th, 21st) century. Our nation's facing (difficult,
moderately challenging, partly sunny) days ahead and it's important
that a qualified (man, woman, dancing chicken) is at the (helm,
wheel, bar) to (steer, run aground, sell to the highest bidder) our
ship of state. During my (years, months, seconds) in the (White
House, statehouse, big house) I (accomplished, fantasized about,
saw on TV) many things and forged many (lasting, easily forgotten,
10-minute) relationships with some of the (world's, nation's, local
lingerie-modeling studio's) most (influential, corrupt,
well-endowed) (leaders, terrorists, massage therapists). Let me
(use, abuse, pad) my (skills, ambitious spouse, bank account) to
(build, destroy, mortgage) a (better, worse, pretty much the same)
America.''

UNITED STATES OF WASTE 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MIKE SCOTT  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WALNUT CREEK, Calif. _ The United States is covered, swamped,
buried in garbage, 85 percent of it readily recyclable.
</P>
<P>
   The largest man-made object on Earth, dwarfing anything you can
name _ the Great Pyramid of Cheops, the Great Wall of China, the
World Trade Center _ is New York City's aptly named Fresh Kills
Landfill. It is visible to the naked eye from orbiting spacecraft.
At this date, with global deforestation, fouled air,
manufacturing's dioxins and PCBs in our water, and 6 billion
people, each unrecycled aluminum and tin can, glass and plastic
bottle, Styrofoam peanut, cardboard box and piece of paper (office,
fax, computer, magazine, newsprint) is a coffin nail in our shared
home.
</P>
<P>
   Here in the allegedly aware, allegedly progressive San Francisco
Bay Area, hardly one community in seven comes close to recycling
goals set in 1989. Americans comprise less than 5 percent of the
world's population, yet consume half the global resources. Most of
these resources, despite all the ``eco'' and ``green'' hype, wind
up in landfills. Not recycled.
</P>
<P>
   The chief product of the United States is trash. Not wheat,
corn, soybeans, machinery. Trash. Unrecycled recyclable trash.
</P>
<P>
   Three hundred years of endless frontier, bottomless cornucopia,
westward ho! mentality intermingles with our ``I got mine'' concept
of ``freedom.'' Freedom to waste. Freedom to throw away food.
Freedom to coo at the lovable critters on the Nature Channel whose
habitats our profligacy is destroying while mindlessly tossing
another microwave dinner box, designer water bottle and
active-lifestyle magazine in the garbage.
</P>
<P>
   Small and medium-sized local businesses and corporations are
even worse offenders than households. Here in upscale Walnut Creek,
store after silly trend du jour store, doors propped wide open, air
conditioners full blast, beckon shoppers too uncommitted or too
addle-brained to take that wee bit of effort to push open the door.
</P>
<P>
   The alleys behind these stores and theme restaurants are lined
with bins overflowing with recyclables and untouched food _ steel
cornucopias of sloth, stupidity and waste.
</P>
<P>
   This may not be as exciting as the most recent campaign sex
scandal allegation or gross weekend receipts of the latest
mallplex-to-video-in-two-weeks movie. But this is the great, quiet
tragedy of our time.
</P>
<P>
   There are solutions. The best: In New Jersey, garbage ``meter
maids'' in Newark poke curbside trash bags and cans. If they hear
glass or cans or find paper, the resident or business is fined.
</P>
<P>
   More money for schools, libraries, street repair.
</P>
<P>
   We need such enforcement nationally. A diseased, dying planet
should qualify at least as a federal emergency. We're zealots about
issuing parking tickets. Anyone too self-absorbed to fathom
Reduce/Reuse/Recycle deserves a whopping ticket.
</P>
<P>
   It's hard to believe this is the same nation that during World
War II made real sacrifices, had scrap metal drives, observed
Meatless Mondays and rationed gas, tires, butter, eggs and sugar.
</P>
<P>
   Weren't that generation's children and grandchildren taught to
pick up after themselves? We need legal inducement to do so
responsibly. A half-century of postwar heedless consumption is
over.
</P>
<P>
   Tossing trash from your car window is already a $500 to $1,000
fine. Punishment for ``failure to recycle'' should be at least as
severe.
</P>
<P>
   If we enforce such new laws, we can finally pay teachers as much
as junior execs at tobacco companies, expand our libraries, even
pay off our national debt.
</P>
<P>
   This time the enemy isn't Hitler, Tojo, Khrushchev, Hussein or
Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   It's our own sloth.

 &HT;    Bosnia-Herzegovina celebrate peace with national holiday
 &HT;    By Scott Montgomery
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Bosnia and Herzegovina will create a national
holiday to commemorate the signing of the Dayton Peace Accords,
officials announced Wednesday, cementing Nov. 21 as a date of
historical significance to the region.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton lauded the announcement, calling the date ``a
symbol of multiethnic democracy and solidarity between the people
of the United States and the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In so doing,'' Clinton said, ``the leaders of every ethnic
community in Bosnia-Herzegovina have made clear that Dayton marked
not merely the end of a war, but the beginning of a new country and
a blueprint of its future.''
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, made by the triad of presidents who govern the
country, came as Dayton officials prepared to invite them to Ohio
for the annual celebration of the peace treaty that was brokered in
1995 at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. This year, Dayton's
celebration of the treaty will begin Nov. 13 when the Sarajevo
Philharmonic Orchestra joins the Dayton Philharmonic Orchestra in a
Concert for Peace.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Ellen Glynn, spokeswoman for U.N. Ambassador Richard
Holbrooke, attended the announcement in Sarajevo and said Dayton
was remembered warmly during the event.
</P>
<P>
   ``They talked about the city of Dayton and the people opening
their hearts to them and that it meant so much to achieving
peace,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Holbrooke was the chief negotiator for the U.S. in the peace
talks that led to a formal splitting of disputed lands between the
warring parties of the region.
</P>
<P>
   R. Bruce Hitchner, director of UD's Center for International
Programs, said commemorating the signing of the Dayton agreement is
a good sign for the future of the troubled region. It reaffirms the
determination of people there to achieve the principles of
cooperative life on which the treaty is based, Hitchner said.
</P>
<P>
   Bosnia and Herzegovina continue to exist under a tense peace
that is aided by an international military force, including a large
U.S. contingent.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the only day of the year that unifies the country,''
Hitchner said of Nov. 21. ``It's the only idea that unifies the
nation.''

 &HT;    UNCONVENTIONAL JURIST PRESIDES IN CISNEROS CASE
 &HT;    For release Sunday, Sept. 5.
 &HT;    VBy JULIA MALONE
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. District Judge Stanley Sporkin looked at the
federal prosecutors and $495-an-hour defense lawyers arrayed before
him. ``I can try a case in two days,'' he asserted.
</P>
<P>
   The boast last July was tinged with defensiveness. The colorful
and sometimes controversial judge prides himself on his ability to
cut through legalistic lollygagging. But he was speaking on the
12th day of what he had predicted to be a two-day hearing to
prepare for the trial of former federal housing secretary Henry G.
Cisneros, who is charged with lying in an FBI background check
about paying ``hush money'' to his former mistress.
</P>
<P>
   The pretrial wrangling has hardly burnished Sporkin's reputation
for keeping things moving in his court. But the preliminary hearing
provided a preview of how the unconventional jurist will preside
when jury selection finally begins this week.
</P>
<P>
   Lounging on his big leather-padded rocking chair in midsummer,
Sporkin fidgeted impatiently as the two sides clashed over
admitting into evidence secret recordings made by Cisneros's
ex-lover, Linda Jones. Chomping on ice and occasionally yawning
broadly, Sporkin shifted his glasses from his nose to his forehead
to the top of his head. He summoned documents to read and then
leaned back, shutting his eyes long enough to make onlookers wonder
whether he was drifting off.
</P>
<P>
   But hearing something that pricked his interest, he would
suddenly lift his arms into the air and interrupt lawyers
mid-argument, or pepper witnesses with his own questions.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome to the unpredictable world of what critics have dubbed
``Sporkin's law,'' and what fans applaud as justice with
spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   Washingtonian magazine once rated him among the top judges on
the local bench, although not without a mixed review. He is a
``bright, engaging, often baffling jurist,'' the journal said. ``He
is also a restless soul with little patience for legal games.''
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin is given to blunt, off-the-cuff observations.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess there are people who don't know how to tell the
truth,'' he opined in July, after hearing Jones admit to lying
repeatedly to investigators.
</P>
<P>
   After Jones described how she edited taped conversations with
Cisneros, then filed a lawsuit and plotted a public relations
campaign that included appearing on a tell-all TV show, Sporkin
wryly asked, ``Is this more of the 'Kosovo strategy? Bomb him into
submission?' ``
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, sir,'' said Jones.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Sporkin warned the Cisneros lawyers from the
early going that, despite their vigorous objections, he almost
certainly would allow some of the tapes to be heard at trial. When
lead defense attorney Brendan V. Sullivan made a dramatic
demonstration to lampoon the tapes as doctored-up phonies, Sporkin
listened with open admiration.
</P>
<P>
   But a month later, he ruled that most of the contents of 26
recordings could be used as evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Sporkin earned a reputation for toughness as a career lawyer who
headed enforcement at the Securities and Exchange Commission.
Although his zeal in attacking businesses earned him the ire of
conservatives, Sporkin formed a tight bond with then SEC chief
William Casey.
</P>
<P>
   When President Reagan made Casey director of the CIA, he took
Sporkin along as his general counsel and loyal defender. Reagan
rewarded Sporkin by appointing him to the bench in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   His career on the court has not been all smoothness, however.
</P>
<P>
   Three years ago he was unceremoniously dumped from the federal
government's first antitrust action against Microsoft Corp. after
he mentioned reading a book on the company and then ruled that a
settlement offer was too easy on the software giant.
</P>
<P>
   The Circuit Court of Appeals issued a sharp rebuke, concluding
that his ruling had been swayed by his extracurricular reading and
calling him biased against Microsoft. Sporkin's decision was
reversed, and he was taken off the case.
</P>
<P>
   He has been involved in other high-profile cases:
</P>
<P>
   _ He ordered the Navy not to dismiss a sailor, Master Chief
Petty Officer Timothy R. McVeigh of Hawaii, who described himself
as ``gay'' on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   _ He ordered the Federal Elections Commission to investigate
allegations that the late Commerce Secretary Ronald H. Brown sold
seats on overseas trade missions for Democratic campaign
contributions.
</P>
<P>
   _ He blocked the merger of four of the nation's top drug
wholesalers this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Now 67, he has taken senior status and spoken publicly of trying
to set up an academic institute on crisis management, a long-time
interest of his.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, his ice-chomping irreverence continues to rule in
Courtroom 6 of the U.S. Courthouse. On one hearing day, the court
was summoned into afternoon session by two young boys, chanting
``Hear ye! Hear ye!'' Once ensconced on his rocking chair, Sporkin
announced that these were his grandsons. He confided cheerfully
that neither had any interest in becoming a lawyer, or a judge.

   WACO-INQUIRY (Washington) _ Attorney General Janet Reno wants to
move quickly to open an independent investigation of the 1993
deadly siege in Waco, Texas, and plans to pick a leader for the
inquiry from a short list that includes two former Republican
senators, law enforcement officials said today. By Neil A. Lewis.
</P>
<P>
   WACO-ZEALOTS (Houston) _ Four years ago the investigation into
the fatal siege at the Branch Davidian compound near Waco came to
an end. Congressional hearings concluded with Attorney General
Janet Reno blaming the deaths of about 80 members of the religious
sect on the group's leader, David Koresh. With the close of the
hearings, the mainstream media mostly lost interest in the story,
and Waco faded away. But Waco has never faded away for Michael
McNulty and David Hardy. By Jim Yardley.

   RUSSIA-U.S. (Washington) _ The Clinton administration said

</P>
<P>
   NY-MARCH (New York) _ An appeals court on Wednesday emphatically
rejected the city's final legal challenge to a Harlem youth rally,

safety, it ordered the Police Department not to monitor the event
with ``undue rigidity.'' By David Barstow.
</P>
<P>
   SCI-SMART-MICE (Undated) _ In a major test of how learning works
at the level of nerve cells, a scientist has created a smarter
strain of mice by manipulating a gene involved in memory formation.
He believes his work lays the basis for eventually doing the same
in people, whether in helping patients with memory deficits,
counteracting the loss of memory in older people, and even in
making healthy individuals smarter. By Nicholas Wade.

<P>
   GUIDANCE-COMPANIES (San Jose, Calif.) _ In a trend that
educators say is sure to spread across the country, a growing
number of public-school districts in California and elsewhere,
faced with budget cuts and an increasingly complex college
admissions process, are contracting with private companies to
relieve guidance counselors of responsibility for college and
career advising _ on matters as large as choosing an appropriate
college to those as small as how to draft a letter asking a
favorite teacher for a letter of recommendation. By Jacques
Steinberg.

<P>
   Whenever she is cooking dinner or taking her sons, Jack, 41/2,
and Zach, 20 months, on short car trips, Dallas resident Shaun
Mayner plays classical music.
</P>
<P>
   Mayner grew up in the '60s and was raised on rock 'n' roll, but
she wholeheartedly believes that classical music is good for her
kids _ in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm convinced there's something there _ I know it directly
affects their behavior,'' she says. ``Classical music is very
organized, and that structure _ whether it's fast or slow and
relaxed _ affects their mood and how they act.''
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, she says, when the music's on in the car, her
kids begin to notice the outside world. Jack starts a two-way
conversation with her instead of issuing a series of ``I want'' or
``I need'' demands, she says. And both children are drawn to the
kitchen when Mayner turns on the classical music _ otherwise, she
says, they tend to stay in their rooms.
</P>
<P>
   But it's not just mood that Mayner, and many other parents, are
concerned with. She is one of thousands of Americans who believe in
the ``Mozart effect,'' a theory that classical music can affect the
learning capabilities of children 3 and younger.
</P>
<P>
   The theory is that although classical music has a calming effect
on anyone, it is especially important to young children, whose
minds are quickly developing and who need positive stimuli.
</P>
<P>
   Based on studies in 1993 and 1995 at the University of
California-Irvine, the Mozart effect has become the latest craze in
child development, bringing with it several popular parenting books
and an onslaught of CDs _ all aimed at directing American parents
toward the music and at giving them one more factor in the formula
for effective parenting.
</P>
<P>
   But is cranking up the notes of dead European composers hype or
helpful?
</P>
<P>
   This summer, some researchers stepped forward to rebut the
theory behind the Mozart effect. The most well-known is Dr. John
Bruer, president of St. Louis' McDonnell Foundation. In ``The Myth
of the First Three Years,'' which will be published Sept. 9 by Free
Press (hardcover, $25), Bruer makes a case that too much emphasis
has been placed on brain development in the first three years of
life.
</P>
<P>
   He writes that ``... there is no evidence at all for the claims
that listening to classical CDs improves children's spatial
reasoning skills.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Steele agrees. A psychology professor at North
Carolina's Appalachian State University, Steele says the Mozart
effect does not exist, that the original conclusions of the
California studies don't hold up.
</P>
<P>
   Remember, says Steele, that the original studies didn't even
include young children _ they were performed on college students,
who were played classical music and then asked to immediately do a
specific spatial-reasoning task having to do with folding and
cutting a piece of paper. This is, he says, hardly a measure of any
sort of long-term brain developmental abilities.
</P>
<P>
   Steele says he replicated the test exactly and found that there
was virtually no difference in performance levels among subjects
who listened to nothing, a Mozart sonata and a work of modern
composer Philip Glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got no effect,'' Steele says; the results of his study were
published in July in ``Psychological Science.'' ``These students
were equivalent across the board; their performance was the same.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Bruer and other naysayers are still clearly in the
minority, as the signs of Mozart madness proliferate.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous stores offer display racks of baby-themed classical
CDs, such as ``Baby Needs Mozart.'' Three of the 15 top-selling
classical albums in the country are credited to Don Campbell, the
author whose bestselling 1997 book ``The Mozart Effect'' (Avon
hardcover, $24), has become the standard text for those who believe
in the effect.
</P>
<P>
   On the national level, Florida toddlers now listen to classical
music in public schools _ by law. The National Academy of Recording
Arts and Sciences handed out free CDs of classical Grammy winners
this past spring.
</P>
<P>
   For many Mozart-effect aficionados, the theory makes sense.
Californian Heidi Brende, who teaches piano, says that classical
music helps calm her 2 1/2-year-old, Carter, and her newborn, Emma.
</P>
<P>
   ``Classical music stimulates the same neural pathways used for
complex reasoning tasks,'' says Brende, who has recorded two CDs of
classical pieces, ``SmartPlay With Classical'' and ``SmartSleep
With Classical,'' that are sold in stores nationwide. ``I am
convinced. I believe it.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics like Steele say it may be something as simple as
people's need to believe that actually gives the theory its power.
The whole Mozart-effect craze hinges greatly on people's desire to
do something good for their children. Parents who play their kids
the music of Mozart feel some peace of mind from their belief that
they're helping their child's development.
</P>
<P>
   But there's something else fueling the rush to Mozart, too,
Steele says with a laugh. It all comes down to the money. Babies
will always be born to proud, new parents who want to do what's
best _ which means that classical albums for kids may be major cash
cows.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of commercial interest here,'' Steele says. ``A
lot of companies see it as a way to sell a lot of CDs very fast.''

THE NEW TETRIS? BOOOOOOOOOOOORING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MALCOLM MAYHEW 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tetris is been one of those games that, from a distance, look
boring. But once you start playing, it becomes help-me-I-can't-stop
addicting.
</P>
<P>
   When it first came out in the '80s, a lot of fans were saying
that they were so hooked, they dreamed about different ways to
position the game's falling-from-the-sky jigsaw-puzzle pieces. Then
they'd wake up and beat everyone.
</P>
<P>
   Through the arcade, Super Nintendo, PC and Nintendo's Game Boy,
Tetris has been passed down from one video-game generation to the
next. The newest incarnation _ The New Tetris (Nintendo for N64,
$60, all ages) _ is, oddly, the easiest to master, making it a bit
on the _ dare I slag a Tetris title? _ boring side.
</P>
<P>
   The big deal is that up to four people can play. Yeah, big deal,
all right. And, granted, playing _ and, in my case, creaming _
three other players would be a blast. That is, if it weren't so
easy.
</P>
<P>
   What makes The New Tetris so unchallenging: Before a piece
drops, it casts a shadow of where it's gonna land, revealing how
the puzzle will look. Part of Tetris' fun was making mistakes, then
learning from them; this is almost like cheating and not getting in
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Nintendo made it easier on purpose, to get younger kids
into it. Gotta say I'd rather see my kid playing this than, say,
Slaughter House 2000. It's probably the only game I could beat the
kid at, too.
</P>
<P>
   To compete with Sega's upcoming Dreamcast machine, arriving
Sept. 9, Sony and Nintendo have dropped the prices of their home
machines _ the PlayStation and Nintendo 64 _ to $99. (And you
bought one a year ago for $200.) If you wanna spend a few extra
bucks on the N64, go for Nintendo's Star Wars Episode I: Racer
bundle. You get the unit, one controller and the Star Wars game for
$120.
</P>
<P>
   Well known with the ages 3-8 in-crowd, Pajama Sam is a little
cartoon character from Humongous Entertainment that, like Barney
and Big Bird, teaches kids how to think logically, remember junk
and solve problems. (Picking out clothes, though, is obviously not
one of Pajama Sam's strong points, as proved by his Superman
Underoos outfit. Can we recommend something from Pokemon?)
</P>
<P>
   Parents looking for a good deal simply can't go wrong with
Humongous' latest Pajama Sam release, the Pajama Sam Deluxe Pack.
Selling for $20, the set includes two new Pajama Sam CD-ROMS _
Pajama Sam 2: Thunder and Lightning Aren't So Frightening and
Pajama Sam's Lost &AMP; Found _ and a pretty neat watch with a
detachable character. I'm never gonna play these games, so I'm
giving my pack to the little sister of this girl I'm dating.
Keeping the watch, though. C'mon, it's cute.

PANAMA SWEARS IN ITS FIRST WOMAN PRESIDENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By DAVID GONZALEZ    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ Mireya Moscoso, a schoolteacher's daughter
who grew up in rural poverty, was sworn in Wednesday not only as
Panama's first woman president but also as its first president who
will lead a completely sovereign country, once the United States
withdraws its remaining troops and hands over the Panama Canal on
Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   Those twin themes flavored her inaugural address, one in which
she repeatedly urged the Panamanian people to join her in
eliminating poverty and corruption and in reviving the civic and
moral spirit of the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``At this moment, when we are about to end the century and our
nation ends a historic era with the departure of a foreign
presence, when we are ready with pride and dignity to usher the new
millennium with our sovereignty fully rescued, it is I, the first
woman, who has received the trust of the Panamanian people,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We begin to make real the hopes of thousands of Panamanian
women over the centuries who, through generations of history, have
nourished the hope that our society recognize their ability and
merit, and share with all the men of this country the great
responsibility of leading the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by her young son, Ricardito, she entered the
National Stadium and raised her arms in a symbolic embrace of the
cheering, flag-waving crowd of thousands of Panamanians from
throughout the country. The site was a gesture to the populist
pillars of her Arnulfista Party, which was named after her late
husband, Dr. Arnulfo Arias, who was elected and forced from the
presidency three times.
</P>
<P>
   Although her father was a teacher, her political education came
during her marriage to Arias, a legendary _ and somewhat eccentric
_ nationalist whose own beliefs included fascist and mystical
leanings. She has often invoked his memory in her speeches, and her
address Wednesday was filled with poignant references.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is the beginning of the period of government he never
had a chance to fulfill for the benefit of the poor and
marginalized of Panama,'' she said. ``How much I wish my mother and
father and Dr. Arnulfo Arias were sitting in front watching this
historic day. But I know they are in heaven blessing us and saying
`Mireya, keep on and fulfill the work I could not finish.'''
</P>
<P>
   While the audience included heads of state and diplomats,
notably absent was the man she defeated in last May's election,
President Ernesto Perez Balladares, who left the Presidential
Palace even before the inauguration.
</P>
<P>
   The slight was the final skirmish in a summer-long battle marked
by moves that could hobble his successor's administration, such as
packing the Supreme Court with his political allies and appointing
associates from his Revolutionary Democratic Party to civil service
posts.
</P>
<P>
   President Moscoso, 53, leads the nation into its most important
period, as it takes over the canal and some $4 billion dollars in
surrounding property.
</P>
<P>
   Although the canal is a $700 million operation, it is not a
windfall, because much of that revenue goes back into operations.
Several companies have invested in tourism and other projects, but
some observers said the United States should provide more help.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't tried to support them with a package of trade and
investment incentives that will ensure the transfer of facilities
and land be done smoothly,'' said Bob Pastor, a political scientist
at Emory University and former member of the National Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso vowed to run the canal efficiently and safely,
projecting an international image of stability. In her address
Wednesday, she reminded citizens of their new relationship with the
canal and the challenges and opportunities of Panamanian ownership.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the 31st of December, at 12 noon, we will once and for all
attain our true independence,'' she said. ``From then on, we will
have to go on a new path, one where we will have to provide all the
elements of a national identity.''
</P>
<P>
   Her supporters have high expectations because of her promises to
create jobs, alleviate poverty and deliver better social services.
In a country where more than a third of the population is in
poverty, many voters became suspicious of government after her
predecessor's policies of privatization and open markets resulted
in little they could see, except for miles of new highways. He has
left behind an unemployment rate of approximately 14 percent, $7
billion dollars in debt and little cash to pay for Moscoso's
platform.
</P>
<P>
   Some foreign diplomats said she has only vaguely explained how
she will translate her intense grass-roots appeal into a workable
social and political program.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's very good at retail politics, in sensing the mood in a
crowd,'' one diplomat said. ``But don't talk to her about big
policy details. She goes blank.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso has said she would not privatize any more state-run
industries, though few remain. She has also said she wants to raise
tariffs to help farmers devastated by imports, although her ability
to do so is limited by Panama's membership in the World Trade
Organization.
</P>
<P>
   She has suggested dipping into a $1.7 billion fund generated by
her predecessor's sale of state industries, but her slim majority
in the Legislature may not prove strong enough to push through such
reforms.
</P>
<P>
   While viewed as having the most pro-American administration in
decades, the president has chosen a Cabinet of relatively young
professionals with little government experience. They have been
hampered by the outgoing administration's almost total lack of
cooperation in any transition meetings.
</P>
<P>
   But Roberto Eisenmann, an informal adviser on social issues,
said the president was focused on the task ahead and aware of the
risks.
</P>
<P>
   ``A few months ago when the euphoria of her victory was still
present, I was in a meeting with people who were talking about the
difficulties of governing with a strong opposition in the
Assembly,'' Eisenmann said Tuesday. ``A loyal supporter stood up
and said, `Dona Mireya, remember you have the people!'''
</P>
<P>
   ``With a serenity that was really remarkable she said, `I have
the people today. I could lose it tomorrow if we don't dedicate
ourselves and work for the people.'''

<P>
   LAGOS, Nigeria _ Gasoline stations, once the defining image of
Nigeria's seemingly willful collapse, have undergone a remarkable
transformation since the military rulers handed over power to
civilians three months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Gone are the mile-long lines that choked roads, made fistfights
part of the Nigerian streetscape and transformed gas stations into
high-security zones swarming with soldiers, police officers, thugs
and the long-suffering ordinary Nigerian, citizen of the world's
sixth-largest producer of oil.
</P>
<P>
   Now most gas stations operate the way an Agip station on Iju
Road here does: motorists pull up to a pump and drive away a minute
later.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is fundamental change in things,'' said Abiodun
Akinloye, 34, an attendant at the station for six years. ``Before,
the tension was too high. People were begging to buy fuel and
sometimes had to wait for days. Now you buy fuel at the actual
price and at your own convenience. Everything has become fine.
Everybody is feeling fine.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after Africa's most populous nation inaugurated its
first civilian government in 16 years, gas stations offer perhaps
the clearest promise of what could become one of the most
remarkable political transformations on the continent.
</P>
<P>
   Only 15 months ago, Nigeria was held in the grip of a rapacious
military regime that had turned the country into an international
pariah and manipulated oil supplies so that Nigerians often had to
pay several times what Americans do for a gallon of gasoline.
</P>
<P>
   Today, after a year of traumatic events that pushed this fragile
nation to the brink of civil war, Nigeria is intact, but its
president, Olusegun Obasanjo, has quickly pushed reforms that are
altering its face. Nigerians, an industrious people paralyzed until
last year by the repressive military under Gen. Sani Abacha, are
now even talking of freedom.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   ``It is like Joseph getting out of the pit to get to the palace
in Egypt,'' said Baba Adi, a lawyer and prominent member of the
president's People's Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Even the government's fiercest critics, who argue that it has
yet to make lasting changes, acknowledge that there is greater
individual freedom.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even if it's temporary,'' said Beko Ransome-Kuti, a well-known
human rights campaigner who spent three years in jail under Abacha,
``it's a nice holiday.''
</P>
<P>
   While it is perhaps too soon to talk of democracy, the end of
the military state has visibly affected daily lives here. Obasanjo
has forbidden politicians from driving in convoys with sirens
blaring, once a common practice. Several streets in Lagos have been
renamed for slain pro-democracy activists.
</P>
<P>
   The notorious security forces that patrolled cities with
unchallenged authority _ known here in Lagos as Operation Sweep _
have grown tamer. In Lagos the forces are now called by the less
sinister Rapid Response Squad.
</P>
<P>
   On Iju Road, often made impassable in the past by motorists
waiting at its many gas stations, soldiers and policemen once
posted at checkpoints every two miles have disappeared.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   So there is no one now shaking down Isaac Bodunrin, 45, and his
fellow cab drivers for the equivalent of 20 cents every two miles.
``If we can continue like this, there will be progress in this
country,'' said Bodunrin, who in the past was often left with
nothing at the end of the day but now makes about $10. ``If we can
drive free, I can do my job.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The job that Obasanjo has done so far includes changes in many
vital sectors. He has established a panel to investigate human
rights violations since the mid-1980s and another one to look into
government contracts awarded since 1976. He has sent an
anti-corruption bill to the National Assembly, though many say the
proposal goes too far in potentially invading people's privacy.
</P>
<P>
   On the burning issue of the Niger Delta, the source of Nigeria's
oil but still profoundly poor, Obasanjo proposed legislation toward
its development. In addition, in a highly symbolic act, he
permitted the family of Ken Saro-Wiwa, the writer who was hanged in
1995 for criticizing the government's oil policies, to claim his
body.
</P>
<P>
   In the oil industry, the source of almost all of Nigeria's hard
currency, he has cut out shadowy middlemen from sales of crude oil
and rescinded prospecting contracts awarded to cronies of the
military regime.
</P>
<P>
   The president, a retired general who was Nigeria's military
ruler from 1976 to 1979, shook up the military by forcing about a
hundred top officers to retire. Most were northerners who dominated
the military and ruled the country for all but 10 years since
independence from Britain in 1960, and their successors were chosen
from diverse regions. His government also announced plans to cut
troop strength significantly.
</P>
<P>
   In his choice of ministers, the president has tried to strike a
balance among the dominant ethnic groups and the many minorities.
The move has drawn praise from many pressure groups and Western
diplomats. But it has been criticized by northerners, who say they
are now being marginalized, and by the Ibo from the east, who say
they have not gotten any top ministerial positions.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the changes, critics say the Obasanjo administration
has not taken urgently needed steps to address the roots of
Nigeria's problems. According to the constitution, which was handed
down by military decree, the appointments of judges, the control of
police officers and the direction of primary schools all still rest
with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   Many critics argue that unless the relationship between the
federal government and the 36 states is renegotiated _ and that
includes the formula by which oil revenues are shared _ Nigeria
will remain a divided nation, with most of its ethnic groups
feeling oppressed by another group. In the last three months,
hundreds have died in ethnic skirmishes across the country,
including two clashes between the Yoruba and the Hausa, who with
the Ibo are the country's largest ethnic groups.

</P>
<P>
   ``We must sit down and decide what to say together,'' said Ayo
Opadokun, general-secretary of the National Democratic Coalition,
the main civilian opposition group to the Abacha military
government. ``If not, we may have to look for the U.S.S.R. on the
map.''
</P>
<P>
   Until reforms are written into law, democratization remains
overly dependent on Obasanjo's personality, say critics. That is a
dangerous situation in a country where one man, whether Abacha or
Obasanjo, can completely change the direction of the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Obasanjo dies today, what happens to Nigeria?'' asked
Ransome-Kuti. Mohammed Ashorobi, a member of the national executive
committee of the president's party, argued that Obasanjo has begun
to lay ``the foundation for the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The priority, he said, has been to try to meet the country's
essential needs, a task made easier by the recent rebound in crude
oil prices to more than $20 a barrel. In addition to the
availability of gasoline, electricity service has improved
noticeably in many parts, and the government recently announced
that the price of a phone line would fall significantly.
</P>
<P>
   Ashorobi said, ``Regarding the basic comforts of life, the
current regime has been able to bring some confidence into society
where there was only despair before.''
</P>

<P>
   On Iju Road, in a cacophony of human voices and engine sounds,
its two lanes teem with pedestrians, cars, motorcycles, peddlers
selling everything from vegetables to raw meat. With the gasoline
lines now gone, traffic moves in both directions, slowly but
surely.
</P>
<P>
   At the Agip station, three yellow fuel trucks were parked
waiting to discharge their load, two of them for the last seven
days because the station simply did not need more fuel. The
situation would have been unthinkable just months ago.
</P>
<P>
   Nigerians have not seen such plentiful gasoline since 1993 when
Abacha let the country's refineries deteriorate, thereby forcing
one of the world's top oil producers to import refined products,
through his middlemen.
</P>
<P>
   ``The change came with the new government, so we are all
happy,'' said Adeniyi Johnson, 40, a civil servant who drove his
white Volkswagen Beetle to a pump. ``I hope it will continue this
way.''
</P>
<P>
   The gas bounty even pleased those who had benefited from the
artificial scarcity. In the past, soldiers would sometimes take
over the station and control the lines, moving drivers ahead in
exchange for a bribe. At the end of the day, the soldiers would tip
the thugs who informally controlled the lines, at the very bottom
of the corruption food chain.
</P>
<P>
   One former regular, Eyo Kulaba, 25, said he was able to save
enough money from the bribes he collected to buy a used motorcycle.
And so in Nigeria's peculiar job classification, he had moved up
from being an ``area boy'' _ a jobless youth who hustles for tips
and bribes on the streets _ to an ``okada man,'' a youth who
ferries passengers around on his motorcycle.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although I benefited materially, I was not very happy that
people were suffering daily,'' Kulaba said. ``People were bashing
each other's vehicles to get fuel and there was always a lot of
fighting. It was really terrible.''

   ``It's the same old story,'' Burns said Wednesday. ``We are
going to need a complete overhaul, even if we make the playoffs.
But, to be objective, you can't completely change all 22 players.
You have to keep some.
</P>
<P>
   ``The players who want to be here should be here and the ones
who don't want to be here should move on _ and that is not
necessarily a bad thing. They might want to leave the league or go
to another MLS team.
</P>
<P>
   ``Change is sometimes good. This situation affects the
perception of players. Some players who are in D.C. are regarded as
better players than they are, but here some players are regarded as
worse players than they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Burns began playing soccer in his native Marlborough, Mass., has
been with the US national team for two World Cups, and had
exceptional success in Copa America '95, US Cup '95, and CONCACAF
Gold Cup '97. But Burns has not had similar success with his
hometown professional team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been frustrating to the point of embarrassment,''
Burns said. ``We've been behind the 8-ball since Day 1. We've had
four terrible years. But I said this at the start of the season,
I've been here for the bad and I want to be here when we turn it
around.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution have used 67 players in four seasons, and many of
Burns's former teammates have gone on to have successful careers
elsewhere. Meanwhile, the Revolution have been consistently near
the bottom of the Eastern Conference standings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the people who have been involved deserve some
criticism, but some are not as much to blame as others,'' Burns
said. ``In the past, the chemistry has not been good. But with this
team, the chemistry is not bad.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing now is that we are 3 points out of the playoffs
and everyone is thinking in the back of their mind that, after
losing eight of nine games, that is pretty remarkable. If we were
not in the playoff race, a lot of guys might have packed it in and
thrown away the season. Now, if we win, we are right back in it.
But we have to win this weekend or else the season is virtually
over.''

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House chief of staff Thursday urged the
Republican majority in Congress to send President Clinton its $792
billion tax cut bill so that he could promptly veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the tax measure early last month but lawmakers
have refrained from forwarding it to the White House, where it
faces certain rejection. Republicans have been stumping across the
country for their tax plan during the current congressional recess,
hoping to generate public support. Clinton and his aides have taken
every opportunity to criticize the proposal as an unwarranted
windfall for the rich and a threat to the booming American economy.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, pleaded with
the GOP leadership Thursday morning to release the bill ``so we
don't have to keep fooling around with the phony debate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to veto it,'' Podesta said in an appearance at the
National Press Club. ``So send it down to us so that we can veto it
and then move forward, putting first things first and seeing
whether we can find some bipartisan agreement on these other major
budget questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and members of Congress have been out of Washington for
the past two weeks and there has been no movement on this year's
tax-and-spending debate beyond the occasional rhetorical salvo like
the one fired Thursday morning by Podesta. Congressional officials
said Thursday that the leadership intends to send the tax-cut bill
to the White House by the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is clearly spoiling for the fight over taxes and
spending to resume. Polling and political experience have persuaded
the president and his advisers that they hold the high ground of
public opinion in the looming struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has argued that projected federal budget surpluses
should not be given away in the form of tax cuts but rather
``invested'' in education, technology, the environment and an
expansion of Medicare benefits to include prescription-drug
coverage for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinarily camera-shy Podesta took advantage of a relatively
news-free week in Washington to venture out of his West Wing office
to attend a crowded news conference at the Press Club. In his
prepared remarks, he complained about Republican plans to pay for
their tax cut in part through what he called ``devastating''
reductions in the administration's proposed federal spending for
research and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a 19th century budget for a 21st century economy,''
Podesta said of the Republican spending plan. ``One has to wonder
whether the people designing these budgets spent too much time
watching Fred Flintstone and not enough time watching the
Jetsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta said that Congress had cut the administration's request
for civilian research and development spending by $1.8 billion from
roughly $38 billion and had cut $1 billion from the
administration's proposed $13.6 billion for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Republicans also blocked a
proposed $200 million increase in funding for the National Science
Foundation, Podesta complained.
</P>
<P>
   He said that, until now, American science and technology have
traditionally enjoyed strong bipartisan support in Washington.
Congress has long lavished substantial funding on the American
space program, medical research, fundamental science and advanced
military technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this year, the Republican-led Congress _ to make room for
their risky tax plan _ is playing politics with science and
technology funding,'' Podesta said. ``They have proposed deep cuts
in many important research programs. And in so doing, they are
threatening the potential progress of innovation in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Morra, spokeswoman for the House Appropriations
Committee, said that the White House was indulging in the luxury of
sniping from the sidelines while congressional appropriators tried
to devise a budget beneath stringent spending limits decreed in the
1997 balanced budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week another Cabinet officer or White House official
complains about some part of the budget we've underfunded,'' Ms.
Morra said. ``We've done the best we can to prioritize spending
under very tight caps.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the administration's budget submission in January
included $42 billion in tax increases and user-fee increases that
Congress rejected, money that is not available for new spending on
research, technology or anything else. In addition, the
administration is preparing to submit emergency supplemental
spending requests for Kosovo, the Middle East and disaster relief
for Turkey without specifying how they should be paid for, Ms.
Morra noted.
</P>
<P>
   She said that many of the research accounts that were cut were
contained in the appropriations bill for the departments of
Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development that also
includes money for Nasa, the National Science Foundation and the
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morra said that a majority of the committee decided to
increase spending on veterans' health programs substantially,
requiring offsetting reductions in research programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about prioritizing,'' she said.

HAYNES IS THE APPLE OF THE OAKLAND A'S 
</HEADLINE>
 -HNS   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By BRIAN MURPHY  
 c.1999 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ They piled into the clubhouse at Yankee Stadium just
short of midnight on Tuesday, whooping and hollering like Little
Leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, though, the Oakland A's were celebrating a big-league
win, a 3-2, 11-inning, in-your-face job against the defending
champions on the Yankees' own patch of grass in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the clubhouse, the emotions flowed, and tributes were
paid to what was one of the most pivotal performances of the season
_ and who in their right-thinking noggin would have anticipated
these words to hang in the air on the eve of September in an
unlikely A's playoff chase?
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's hear it for Jimmy Haynes!'' the cry went out, and cheers
went up.
</P>
<P>
   How about that: Let's hear it for Jimmy Haynes.
</P>
<P>
   For Jimmy Haynes, a man so down on his luck that he was thought
ousted from any role but mop-up reliever down the stretch. For
Jimmy Haynes, a pitcher who had lost the confidence of his
clubhouse. For Jimmy Haynes, who stared down demons _ not to
mention Derek Jeter, Bernie Williams and the rest of the Bombers _
to turn in seven innings of five-hit, eight-strikeout ball, to hold
the swaggering Yankees to two runs, to give his a team the boost to
pull out a win that again ranks among the season's finest.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was one of the best,'' manager Art Howe said. ``We all
cheered him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' said right fielder Matt Stairs.
</P>
<P>
   And from the man of the hour himself, Georgia-born Jimmy Wayne
Haynes: ``They don't get much better than that.''
</P>
<P>
   Remember, Haynes took the mound despite a million reasons not to
believe in him. He was on a four-game losing streak. He had been
bounced from the rotation. He had been pounded by the Yankees as
recently as Aug. 9, when he failed to pitch out of the second
inning.
</P>
<P>
   He was dueling David Cone. He was trying to keep the A's two
games back of streaking Boston in the American League wild-card
race. And the decision to start him came only after
behind-the-scenes chicanery revealed a rift in the decision-making
process between manager Art Howe and general manager Billy Beane,
with Beane naming Haynes as the starter just 24 hours before game
time.
</P>
<P>
   In the face of all that, Haynes began the game by striking out
Chuck Knoblauch and Jeter on his 90-mph-plus fastball, and ended
his seven innings by fanning Luis Sojo looking on a wicked
curveball to kill a Yankee threat.
</P>
<P>
   In between, he was brilliant, save for a mistake pitch to
slugger Paul O'Neill, who pounded a two- run homer in the third to
give New York a 2-0 lead that looked like it might be enough. But
Haynes would yield no more. Given a choice of sinking into oblivion
or staking his turf and daring the Yankees to beat him, Haynes
chose the John Wayne route.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can only sink so far in this game,'' third base coach Ron
Washington said, ``and then you're either up, or you're out.''
</P>
<P>
   Pitching coach Rick Peterson has handled the chore of building
Haynes back up, piece by piece. His work was validated on Tuesday
night when Haynes' confidence was oozing, when Haynes took the late
August pressure and made it his friend.
</P>
<P>
   Peterson remembers sitting with Haynes and Howe in the manager's
office in the visiting clubhouse at Yankee Stadium on Monday, and
telling Haynes that he would be given the start on Tuesday.
Peterson noticed a glow in Haynes' face. There was a glow on
Peterson's face talking about Haynes, too; he was visibly moved by
Haynes' stand.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought to myself: He believes he can do it,'' Peterson
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there were questions, that against David Cone, in one
of the biggest games of the year, were we crazy? It's a beautiful
moment for this team.''
</P>
<P>
   Haynes got the team through the seventh tied 2-2, and the A's
did the rest. Doug Jones followed suit with three innings of
one-hit relief to keep it locked, and after pinch hitter Rich
Becker delivered John Jaha home with an RBI single in the top half
of the 11th, new closer Jason Isringhausen pitched out of a
bases-loaded, one-out jam to save it.
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows what we're made of,'' said Howe, who deemed it too
early to determine whether Haynes would make a start on Sunday
against the Tigers. Expect it, though.
</P>
<P>
   Of all things, Haynes took strength in the venue. He felt the
aura of Yankee Stadium, he said, and it fueled him. A typically
intense Yankee crowd of 33,476 cheered against him. Haynes fed off
of it, saying the atmosphere made him better.
</P>
<P>
   His teammates and coaches could only stand and cheer.
</P>
<P>
   ``People doubted whether I could pitch,'' Haynes said. ``That's
not the way it is. I can pitch with anybody.''
</P>
<P>
   And on Tuesday at the House that Ruth Built, Haynes stopped
being a nobody.

HANCOCK OK'S PLAN TO GO PUBLIC 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By KIMBERLY BLANTON  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- John Hancock Mutual Life Insurance Co. has approved a
detailed plan to become a publicly traded company, including a
provision that would set aside up to 5 percent of the shares in
stock plans for the insurer's employees, executives, and board
members.
</P>
<P>
   It was expected the Boston insurer's board would approve a plan
to sell stock, a proposal the company has aired for over a year.
Yet, the final plan contained new details, including a name for the
holding company _ John Hancock Financial Services Inc. _ that will
sell the stock and own the insurance unit, which would be renamed
John Hancock Life Insurance Co.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock's board also scheduled a Nov. 30 vote in which
policyholders would be asked to approve or reject the plan.
Policyholders, however, won't know the value of the stock they
would receive as compensation on the day they vote because the
value would be determined only when the stock hits the market
through an initial public offering.
</P>
<P>
   The Hancock board's approval Monday, revealed by the company
Wednesday, is another step in a tortuous process to transform the
nations' ninth-biggest insurer from a company owned by its 2.8
million policyholders to one owned by the investing public.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to policyholders, the plan must be approved by
insurance regulators in New York and Massachusetts, and from the
Securities and Exchange Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been refining this plan over a period of more than a
year,'' said Stephen Brown, chief executive and chairman of
Hancock's board. ``This starts the public process.''
</P>
<P>
   The company has scheduled public informational hearings across
Massachusetts on Oct. 25 in Springfield, Oct. 27 in Marlborough,
and Oct. 29 in Westport. A public hearing, conducted by regulators,
will be held on Nov. 17, prior to the policyholder vote.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock said earlier that it hoped to sell its stock in the
first quarter of 2000. Given the board's approval, the insurer
appeared on track to meet that schedule. The performance of the
high-flying stock market is an unknown that may change the
insurer's plans.
</P>
<P>
   Few details emerged about which parties _ employees,
policyholders, and executives _ would receive how much stock under
the process known as ``demutualization.''
</P>
<P>
   But the plan explicitly barred the insurer from issuing any
stock or stock options to board members and top-level management
for a year after the public offering. The provision was required by
regulators over Hancock's proposal for a six-month waiting period.
</P>
<P>
   But stock for rank-and-file employees has no such restrictions,
and the company is devising a plan to issue stock to employees
through their 401(k) retirement plans, bonuses, or other channels,
said David D'Alessandro, president.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to convert the company culture to people who are
completely aligned with stockholders' interests,'' D'Alessandro
said.
</P>
<P>
   Details of such plans have not been hammered out, the insurer
said.
</P>
<P>
   As for policyholders _ the current owners of John Hancock,
through their policies _ the amount of stock they receive would be
based on two factors. First, each eligible policyholder would
receive a fixed number of shares. Then, additional shares would be
issued proportionate to the value of Hancock policies eligible to
receive dividends.
</P>
<P>
   One Wall Street estimate put Hancock's value, in the stock
market, at $10 billion. Based on that, each of the company's 3.7
million policies outstanding would bring in about $2,700, on
average, in stock.
</P>
<P>
   Policyholders can receive cash or stock or can accept credits
that would increase the value of their policies.
</P>
<P>
   Hancock disputed the estimate, noting that the insurer's value
would be set only when the stock is sold and that some
policyholders may receive significantly less than the average.
</P>
<P>
   Arthur Fliegelman, an analyst who covers Hancock for Moody's
Investors Service Inc. in New York, called the number of shares
that would be available after the stock sale ``sort of irrelevant.
That's like going into a pizzeria and asking how many slices in a
pie. It could be eight, 10, 12, or 100.''
</P>
<P>
   He added Hancock's documents won't contain that information.
``Only the market is going to do that,'' Fliegelman said.

GET YOUR KID'S SLEEP RHYTHM BACK IN SYNC
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ALYSON WARD 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   We know what you did this summer. All glorious no-school season
long, your kids stayed up till the wee hours and then slept until
noon every day. Now that summer's over, they can't wake up in time
to catch the bus. They're making mornings miserable.
</P>
<P>
   We got some advice from Dr. Joel Steinberg, professor of
pediatrics at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center
at Dallas and medical director of the sleep disorders clinic at
Children's Medical Center of Dallas. Turns out there's something
you can do to get the kids back on track.
</P>
<P>
   Steinberg gave us a good reason to put a stop to those
late-night habits, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sleep deprivation has been well-documented to have an adverse
effect on academic performance,'' Steinberg says. Kids who don't
get enough sleep aren't as attentive in school and usually end up
with lower grades.
</P>
<P>
   When your kids are not tired at bedtime and not ready to wake up
when they need to, they are suffering from phase-delay syndrome or
delayed-sleep syndrome. It's as if you're in Texas but your body's
on West Coast time, Steinberg says. But with a conscious effort,
you can get back into a good sleep schedule.
</P>
<P>
   Here are five ways to correct those back-to-school sleep-rhythm
blues:
</P>
<P>
   Limit your child's caffeine intake. Eliminating caffeine is
ideal, Steinberg says, because it is a stimulant and not a dietary
necessity. But it's likely to sneak into kids' diets through tea,
chocolate and soft drinks, so be sure those are consumed early in
the day and not near bedtime.
</P>
<P>
   Do not put your child to bed until he or she is truly tired, no
matter how late the hour, but wake the child at the same time every
day, even on weekends. At first that may mean less sleep, but a
consistent wake-up time lets the body adjust its sleep rhythm. If
you're getting up at the same time every day, you'll start getting
tired at the right time every night.
</P>
<P>
   Let the sun shine in: Exposure to bright light upon awakening
will help your child's sleep rhythms adjust. When the body's
internal clock is thrown off, getting up in time for school is like
waking in the middle of the night. Bright light helps your internal
clock to reset itself by suppressing the body's secretion of
melatonin, which tells the body to sleep. If your child's room
doesn't get a lot of sunlight, turn on a bright lamp or two in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
   Direct the time spent in bed toward sleeping only, with less
time for bedtime struggles, reading or playing, even if that means
less total time in bed. If kids associate bed with other
activities, going to bed won't mean going to sleep.

   ``Putting him to bed at 9 and having him toss and turn until 11
is very disturbing to the child,'' Steinberg says. Soon, the idea
of bed becomes frustrating instead of restful, creating more
problems.

   See a pediatrician if your child continues to demonstrate sleep
difficulties. Sometimes, sleep problems are more than a summer
hangover; they can be the result of asthma or allergies.

CREATION OF A SMARTER BREED OF MICE LAYS FRAMEWORK FOR IMPROVING
HUMAN MEMORY 
</HEADLINE>
 
(ATTN: N.J., Mass., Calif., Mo.)  (dal) 
 By NICHOLAS WADE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a major test of how learning works at the level of nerve
cells, a scientist has created a smarter strain of mice by
manipulating a gene involved in memory formation. He believes his
work lays the basis for eventually doing the same in people,
whether in helping patients with memory deficits, counteracting the
loss of memory in older people, and even in making healthy
individuals smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts, while praising the technical quality of the work,
see its first application as lying in treating patients with memory
deficits rather than in enhancing intelligence. Also, they say,
although there are reasons to believe mice and humans are similar
in this respect, the applicability of the work to people remains to
be established.
</P>
<P>
   The mice were created in an experiment designed to assess how
memories are formed in the mammalian brain. The animals performed
better than normal mice in six different tests, a strong indication
that the altered gene is indeed involved in learning and memory
formation.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, reported in Thursday's issue of Nature, also
explains why young animals learn better than older ones, because
the manipulated gene is one whose activity is known to fade with
age in mice, monkeys and probably people too.
</P>
<P>
   The smarter mice were created by a team of researchers led by
Dr. Joe Z. Tsien, a neurobiologist at Princeton University. Dr.
Eric R. Kandel, a leading brain expert at Columbia University,
praised the quality of Tsien's work, saying his new research
``seems really reliable and is very nicely done.''
</P>
<P>
   For scientists, the importance of Tsien's paper is that it goes
a considerable way toward proving a longstanding idea, known as
Hebbs rule, about how the brain forms the neural associations that
are the basis of memory. ``This paper takes a big step forward to
showing people had been on the right track,'' said Dr. Charles
Stevens, a neurobiologist at the Salk Institute.
</P>
<P>
   For others, the interest of Tsien's work lies in its possible
application to people. Though no one yet knows whether the same
manipulation would make people smarter, Tsien said, the DNA
sequence of the gene he manipulated is 98 percent identical in mice
and humans, suggesting that altering it by drugs or gene therapy
might also make people smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a hypothetical question. It is time for people and
the public to begin to discuss these issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tsien's work builds on the work of many other biologists and
used known techniques for manipulating the genes of mice. The gene
that he and his team altered is one that makes part of a feature
known as the NMDA receptor. This structure is embedded in a nerve
cell's membrane and serves as a sort of biological antenna to pick
up signals from other nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to understand the basic mechanism of memory, the
forming of an association between two events, biologists have long
focused on the NMDA receptor because it needs two separate signals
to be triggered into action.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Tsien, then working in Tonegawa's laboratory,
created mice in which a gene for the NMDA receptor could be
deleted. The mice performed considerably less well on certain tests
but the experiment, while important, was not regarded as conclusive
because there are many ways of damaging the brain that make it
perform less well but are not specific to memory.
</P>
<P>
   Tsien then decided another approach would be more persuasive,
that of trying to enhance the function of the gene instead of
knocking it out.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens the NMDA receptor is composed of a variety of
subunits. One such component, known as the NR2B subunit, is common
in young animals while another kind, known as the NR2A subunit,
predominates later in life. The juvenile form of subunit produces a
much stronger effect in the nerve cell, and this is believed to be
the reason why younger animals learn more easily than older ones.
</P>
<P>
   Working with colleagues at MIT and at Washington University, St.
Louis, Tsien created strains of mice that have extra copies of the
gene that specifies the NR2B subunit. He also inserted a DNA
sequence just in front of the extra genes that causes them to be
active only in the appropriate tissues, notably the forebrain and
the hippocampus, a brain module associated with spatial and other
kinds of memory.
</P>
<P>
   Having generated these genetically altered mice, Tsien's team
first dissected out neurons from the hippocampus and showed that
the electrical change to be expected from having extra copies of
the NR2B subunit was indeed taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The biologists then performed six different types of standard
learning tests on the mice which exercised different association
areas of the brain. One test required remembering the location of a
submerged platform hidden in milky water, another the ability to
dissociate a sound from shock when the shock was no longer given.
</P>
<P>
   In all these tests the genetically engineered mice performed
consistently better than normal mice, giving Tsien his basis for
believing the animals have enhanced intelligence as well as better
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Kandel notes that Tsien was not restoring the learning ability
of old mice but doing something even more interesting, that of
enhancing the natural abilities of young mice. The experiment thus
raises the question of ``whether intelligence is optimized by the
brain or could you push it even further. That you can improve a
young animal's performance is interesting,'' Kandel said.
</P>
<P>
   Tsien has named the new strain of mice Doogie after the
precocious character in the television show ``Doogie Howser, MD.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His experiment brings home the fact that the blueprint for the
brain is written in the genes and that, probably well before
society is ready to assess the full implications, biologists now
stand on the threshold of being able to change fundamental aspects
of the brain's architecture. ``Our results suggest that genetic
enhancement of mental and cognitive attributes such as intelligence
and memory in mammals is feasible,'' Tsien and colleagues declare
in their Nature article.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts do not disagree with this assessment but put
greater emphasis on the complications that lie ahead. ``One has to
move with great caution and the realization that these are very
complicated processes,'' Kandel said. ``Our understanding of memory
processes is quite shallow _ this is the beginning of the
beginning. What the bad consequences or limitations are we don't
really understand. But by and large the thinking is probably on the
right track.''
</P>
<P>
   In principle, human intelligence could be enhanced by altering
people's genes, when reliable methods of gene therapy are
developed, or more simply by developing drugs that would change the
activity of the memory association gene, Tsien said.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these possibilities could be explored, in his view,
without wide public discussion and the establishment of guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   A more reserved approach was taken by Kandel, who said the first
applications of Tsien's work should be in the medical context of
helping those with memory deficits. Kandel described as
``neurobiological cosmetics'' the notion of enhancing normal
intelligence, and also emphasized that intelligence was far from
being the only mental attribute of importance.
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing human intelligence, Kandel said, ``is a very slippery
turf from a moral point of view. It's one thing to improve memory
in people with a memory deficit. But to begin to mess around with
normal memory is tricky. I don't think we want to emphasize in
society that intelligence is the only factor that counts, because
whatever allows someone to be creative and effective is probably
not determined by the activity of the NMDA receptor in the
hippocampus alone,'' he said, referring to nerve cell receptor
altered by Tsien.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to come across with some simplistic view that
`Take this pill' and we could produce a superior race,'' Kandel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists agree that both genetics and a person's
environment are important in shaping intelligence. But they differ,
often in politically polarized ways, on the relative importance of
each.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kandel, other brain biologists noted the problems in
applying Tsien's work to people. Dr. Timothy Tully, a biologist at
the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory who has genetically enhanced the
memory of fruit flies, said the altered receptor unit was a
reasonable target for new drugs but that these could fail to
enhance human intelligence for many reasons. ``Maybe the juvenile
brain needs to be maximally plastic but as the animal matures you
don't want the brain to be so plastic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nature might have deliberately arranged the tapering off of
learning ability with age, said Stevens of the Salk Institute, so
as to prevent the brain's memory capacity from becoming overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that learning things too well is bad. We could be
stuck learning things we didn't want to learn and our hard disks
would be full of too much information,'' he said. The difficulty
that older people have in recalling things may be due in part to
the complexity of accessing an increasing store of information, he
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Tsien, however, is skeptical of the natural wisdom argument,
noting that nature does many things that are not in the
individual's best interest, such as letting people's bodies run
down and die. He believes that improving people's intelligence,
whether by drugs or genetic alteration, could have profound effects
throughout society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civilization is based on our extraordinary human intelligence.
That is why our society evolves and civilization evolves, and if
there is a way to enhance intelligence then it may not be
surprising to see a change in the evolution of society,'' he said.

AT&AMP;T, BELL ATLANTIC TRADE BARBS OVER SERVICE IN NEW YORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER  
 c.1999 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ An AT&AMP;T executive on Wednesday accused Bell
Atlantic of ``incompetence'' and said New York should deny the
company entry into the long-distance market. And Bell Atlantic
responded with a suggestion that AT&AMP;T quit whining and start
competing.
</P>
<P>
   The two telecommunications giants are embroiled in an
increasingly acerbic battle over local and long-distance markets.
Bell Atlantic is seeking federal permission to invade AT&AMP;T's
long-distance market, which it cannot do until the local market is
open for competition.
</P>
<P>
   Michael J. Morrissey, the AT&AMP;T vice president for law and
government affairs, said Bell Atlantic was not yet up to the task
of providing competitors with suitable local telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   Morrissey, commenting on a Public Service Commission hearing on
Tuesday, said that while Bell Atlantic has made progress in
offering other companies access to its local equipment, service
remains subpar.
</P>
<P>
   ``They do not treat competitors who interface with their systems
at the same parity level they do when they treat their own
customers,'' Morrissey said. ``In the marketplace, this obviously
presents a real problem to us when we have to acknowledge to a
small business customer that if you go with AT&AMP;T, because of
problems with the Bell Atlantic systems, you run an eight to 15
percent chance that your service will be disrupted, and at least a
10 percent chance that your number will be dropped from the
directory. This obviously has a pretty severe impact on a small
business.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrissey said he did not suspect Bell Atlantic of intentionally
providing competitors with inferior service.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not believe they are intentionally doing bad,'' he said.
``I think it is more incompetence rather than intentional.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark A. Marchand, spokesman for Bell Atlantic, which serves the
Northeast and Mid-Atlantic states, characterized Morrissey's
remarks as inaccurate, offensive and petty.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a shame to see behavior such as this,'' Marchand said.
``The message from Bell Atlantic to AT&AMP;T is: Give it up, get over
it and compete like everybody else instead of asking for your
market to be protected.''
</P>
<P>
   Marchand said that over 70 companies are now offering local
telephone service in New York, many of them using Bell Atlantic
equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``To use a phrase like `incompetent' is insulting,'' Marchand
said. ``I hope every Bell Atlantic employee, and we have 44,000 in
New York, sees this and knows how AT&AMP;T feels about the work they
do. It is a ridiculous, second-grade taunt, and not something we
want to have any part of.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic plans to petition the Federal Communications
Commission in the next several weeks. The FCC will then seek an
advisory opinion from the state Public Service Commission on
whether the local market in New York is open to competition.
</P>
<P>
   The major long-distance carriers, as well as Attorney General
Eliot Spitzer, contend that the local market is not yet fully open,
and therefore Bell Atlantic should be denied immediate entry into
the long-distance market.
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic hopes to be selling long-distance service to New
Yorkers by early next year.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Bell Atlantic has made substantial progress, which we
acknowledge, they are not ready for prime time,'' Morrissey told a
news conference on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Marchand said AT&AMP;T is engaged in a ``last gasp, desperate effort
... to keep us out of the long-distance market. ... AT&AMP;T chooses to
sit on the sideline and, for the most part, whine while all the
other companies come in.''

 &HT;    A revelation in letters: Educated, tender Malcolm X
 &HT;    By Bill Hendrick
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Malcolm X is a modern legend, the subject of a Spike
Lee movie and an Alex Haley book. But in important ways, he's not
well known at all.
</P>
<P>
   Emory University has acquired a cache of Malcolm's private
papers that are likely to fill many of the gaps, and even to change
some of the popular notions about the assassinated civil rights
leader's formative years.
</P>
<P>
   The material _ including letters to and from him, personal
receipts, school work and photos _ mostly covers the period
1938-1955, when Malcolm was in his teens and 20s.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really quite stunning, really extraordinary,'' said
Randall Burkett, head of Emory's Woodruff Library African-American
Studies Collection. ``It's a real coup for us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This shows there were a lot of Malcolm Xs out there, not just
the angry, militant one people think of,'' said Leroy Davis, a
professor of African-American studies at Emory.
</P>
<P>
   A collector in Boston bought the papers from a family member,
then sold them to James Allen, an Atlanta antiques dealer, and his
partner, John Littlefield, for an undisclosed sum. Allen and
Littlefield are lending them to Emory's library.
</P>
<P>
   The collection includes a wealth of correspondence, both to and
from Malcolm. Most of it is from 1938 to 1955, when Malcolm was a
teen-ager and young adult, but some of the papers are from the
'60s. The collection also includes a box of cuff links and other
jewelry.
</P>
<P>
   It will be available to researchers starting Tuesday, and will
likely be in high demand. Scholars say the Allen-Littlefield
collection not only is unique _ other than these letters, almost
none of Malcolm's early correspondence has been found _ but also
sheds new light on one of the most admired, feared and important
civil rights leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, Malcolm's letters suggest that, despite his
self-cultivated persona as an uneducated street tough, Malcolm X
was extremely articulate. His letters are elegant, well-punctuated
and laced with sarcasm, humor, even tenderness.
</P>
<P>
   A number of books on Malcolm X paint inaccurate pictures of the
fiery civil rights leader, says David Garrow, an Emory historian
and author of a Pulitzer Prize-winning book on Martin Luther King
Jr. The new collection will help scholars correct those pictures.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given how well known and appropriately celebrated Malcolm is,
it's embarrassing that the historical scholarship on him is so
modest and spotty and incomplete,'' says Garrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``This material shows what an immensely talented individual he
was, even when he was 20 years old,'' Garrow says. ``A lot of us,
even within the scholarly community, sort of had the sense that
Malcolm was a no 'count until the Nation of Islam made him grow up
and get his act together.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But now we see he had his act together early. This collection
makes crystal clear that Malcolm was someone of very impressive
intellect, though nonetheless clearly troubled, long before he
became a Muslim.''
</P>
<P>
   Born Malcolm Little in 1925, Malcolm grew up in Lansing, Mich.
After his father's murder and his mother's institutionalization, he
moved to Boston. Malcolm became a petty criminal as a teen-ager,
and was sent to prison in 1946 at age 21. There he became a
disciple of Elijah Muhammad, head of the Nation of Islam, who
preached rigorous asceticism and advocated a separate nation for
blacks. Released in 1952, Malcolm devoted his life to what then was
called the Black Muslim movement, rejecting civil rights leaders
like King who were pressing for integration.
</P>
<P>
   Malcolm, who adopted the initial ``X'' because he considered
Little a ``slave name,'' in speeches referred to whites as devils
and once met with Ku Klux Klan leaders because he agreed that total
separation of the races was the only way for African-Americans to
achieve equal rights.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1964, after in-fighting sparked by Malcolm's success and
celebrity, he broke with the the Nation of Islam. The same year,
after traveling to Mecca, the seat of Islam in Saudi Arabia, his
views toward whites softened. Scholars like Garrow and Davis
contend he was coming closer to King's integrationist views when he
was assassinated in New York in 1965 by followers of Muhammad.
</P>
<P>
   One of Malcolm's legacies was the burgeoning black-power
movement of the '60s. Allen, himself an expert on Malcolm, says he
opened his collection to scholarship because he considers Malcolm
as important in the civil rights struggle as King.
</P>
<P>
   The papers and other artifacts tend to ``personalize him and the
times in which he lived, enumerate the demons he fought and
overcame, and rekindle the devotion and love he inspired in life,''
he says.
</P>
<P>
   Emory's Davis says the collection also offers new insights into
Malcolm as a historical figure and could fill in blanks that don't
exist about King, whose life was much better documented.
</P>
<P>
   ``The earliest letters speak to Malcolm's adolescence,
especially his friends and associates in the eighth grade at age
14, in a local high school in Mason, Mich.,'' Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a five-and-dime notebook that Malcolm turned into a
makeshift yearbook, he revealed all of his classmates' likes,
dislikes, favorite pastimes, girls and boys and teachers admired in
his school. What obviously comes through in the construction of the
questions is Malcolm's early quest for perfectionism, his
organizing ability in particular, and discipline in tasks he really
enjoyed,'' Davis says.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malcolm was perhaps a closet intellectual, even in those days,
at least in the eighth grade.''
</P>
<P>
   Other documents speak to darker facets of Malcolm's early life.
In one letter, his sister Hilda complains he stole from her ``all
the time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That indicates Malcolm's problem with theft didn't just begin
when he fell in with the wrong crowd,'' Garrow says. ``That, in a
nutshell, is the intriguing, complicated irony of Malcolm. We've
got this impressively bright person writing these extremely
articulate, expressive letters, and on the other hand, we've got
someone who is clearly headed down the serious juvenile delinquent
track.''
</P>
<P>
   Later letters describe Malcolm's life in prison and his
conversion to Islam.
</P>
<P>
   In one, Malcolm writes proudly of his self-discipline,
describing how, when made angry by ``prejudiced, narrow-minded''
guards, ``I counted to 10. One good thing you learn how to do while
you're in here, and that is how to use a little self-control.''
</P>
<P>
   ``In one letter to his half-sister Ella from prison, Malcolm
talks about a book he is writing and asks Ella for good quality
pens for Christmas,'' Allen says. In another he writes also of a
desire to be transferred to another prison because ``they have a
fine library down there and one can learn so many more different
things. My only reason for wanting to go is the library alone.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Together these two letters tend to undermine one image Malcolm
wanted to portray. As the spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, he
portrayed himself as an irretrievable and illiterate hoodlum until
his introduction to Elijah Muhammad and his painful conversion to
Islam,'' Allen says. ``Now we know that his intellectual life and
ambitions were fully engaged prior to his conversion.''
</P>
<P>
   Davis says when word of the collection gets out, it's likely to
attract other letters and Malcolm memorabilia now in hands of
people he knew, and who may want to make it available to scholars.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because of Malcolm X's prominence, and Emory's superior
research facilities, it increases the likelihood of much more
material being added to it,'' Davis says. ``It is of course not
just Emory that would be attractive but the city of Atlanta, the
birthplace of MLK Jr. and a major center of black activist activity
during Malcolm's lifetime and after.''

COMMENTARY: NO PROBLEM 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By BOB HERBERT    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service

<P>
   NEW YORK _ We no longer have to worry about Gidone Busch. He
won't freak out and frighten his neighbors in the Borough Park
section of Brooklyn anymore. He's been taken care of by the police.
He's dead.
</P>
<P>
   The mayor and the police commissioner would like you to believe
that the bullet-riddled Busch had been some monstrous, hulking
figure _ a big man armed with a claw hammer that he was ready to
embed in the skulls of all and sundry.
</P>
<P>
   At a City Hall press conference, Mayor Rudolph Giuliani
earnestly told reporters, ``He was in the course of attacking a
police officer with, I think we have a picture of it, a hammer _''
</P>
<P>
   At which point Police Commissioner Howard Safir helpfully
interjected, ``A claw hammer.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A claw hammer,'' said the mayor.
</P>
<P>
   The idea, of course, was to make Busch seem as menacing, as
dangerous, as possible, and thus take some of the heat off the
police officers who killed him. Said Safir: ``A claw hammer is a
very dangerous instrument and had not the police officers, in my
opinion, taken the action, that could have been planted in one of
our sergeants' brains.''
</P>
<P>
   The hammer was, in fact, an ordinary household hammer. And
Busch, who was mentally ill and extremely agitated, used it to hit
Police Sgt. Terrence O'Brien on the arm and on the thigh. He did
not attack the sergeant's head, and he did not seriously hurt him.
</P>
<P>
   As for Busch being a hulking figure _ well, he was tall.
According to the medical examiner, he was 6-3. And he weighed all
of 159 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   There were six cops at the scene. They didn't pounce on this
raving stringbean and drag him to the ground and handcuff him. Why
go to all that trouble when you've got a gun on your hip? Why take
the humane route when you can just blow somebody away?
</P>
<P>
   Four of the officers opened fire on Busch, hitting him 12 times.
</P>
<P>
   The matter was handled very efficiently. Less than 10 minutes
elapsed between the 911 call that summoned the officers and the
barrage of gunfire that ended Busch's life.
</P>
<P>
   The sense in the city that there is a serious problem with the
Police Department grows with each new example of excessive force.
Borough Park is a quiet place with little crime and a high level of
respect for the police. The killing of Busch surprised, angered and
dismayed many of the residents. ``Why did they have to kill him?''
was the standard refrain.
</P>
<P>
   While the mayor and the police commissioner have said it appears
the cops acted appropriately, other officials expressed
bewilderment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not faulting the individuals involved,'' said Council
Speaker Peter Vallone, ``but I am faulting the system which, as we
head into the 21st century, doesn't seem to be able to figure out
any way of stopping a sick person from trying to hurt somebody
other than killing him.''
</P>
<P>
   The borough president of the Bronx, Fernando Ferrer, asked,
``Was this kind of massive force actually necessary to subdue a man
with a hammer?''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer said the debate over police tactics and attitudes should
not be ``hijacked'' by police-bashers on the one hand and knee-jerk
supporters of the police on the other. He said most New Yorkers
were saying, in effect, ``Wait a minute, I like the city I live in
when crime is down, but I also want these bad contacts with
civilians to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferrer favors the creation of an independent monitor for the
Police Department, and he would like civilian complaints against
the police to be dealt with honestly and effectively _ which is not
something that happens very often now.
</P>
<P>
   The place where such complaints are taken most seriously is in
court. Comptroller Alan Hevesi expects the annual cost of settling
lawsuits against the Police Department to surpass $40 million in
fiscal 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Like Nixon going to China, the one New Yorker who could do
something real about the police problem is Giuliani. But he won't
even acknowledge that there is a problem. So there will be no
gathering of bright and responsible civic leaders to look at ways
of curbing the excesses and improving relations between the police
and the people they are supposed to serve. No advice will be sought
and no unsolicited advice will be taken.
</P>
<P>
   We await the next barrage of gunfire.  &QL;

DESIGN FLAW TO DELAY AMTRAK'S HIGH-SPEED TRAIN SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
  
(ATTN: Colo., Mass., R.I., Conn.) (th) 
 By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Amtrak's new 150-mph express train, which was
supposed to begin service between Washington and Boston this year,
will be delayed several months because the wheels on the passenger
coaches vibrate at high speeds and are wearing out too quickly, the
railroad said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak is counting on the new service, called Acela, to lure
business away from the airlines and to generate $180 million a year
in profits. Those profits are supposed to help the railroad meet a
cut-off in operating subsidies at the end of the 2002 fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
   George Warrington, Amtrak's president and chief executive, said
the railroad would face a shortfall in the next fiscal year as a
result of the delay. But he said Amtrak would make ends meet with
new revenue, most of which is derived from one-time deals. He would
not say what these deals were, but said they did not include sales
of assets.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about taking the time necessary to get this train
right,'' said Warrington during a conference call with reporters.
``As a practical matter, it's not a tough choice because we have no
interest in cutting corners, and accepting a train that does not
meet performance standards.''
</P>
<P>
   The flanges of the train wheels, which descend along the inside
edge of the rails, are wearing out too quickly, according to
engineers.
</P>
<P>
   The problem came to light in shakedown testing on a high-speed
track in Pueblo, Colo. A French company, Alstom SA, which builds
the wheels, is redesigning the suspension to reduce wear, but
testing will take several months.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak said it would know in 60 days when the trains would be
ready. Alstom and its partner, Bombardier Inc. of Montreal, said
the trains would be ready for delivery in the spring.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is a phenomenon known to rail engineers as
``hunting,'' a side-to-side oscillation of the wheels.
</P>
<P>
   Warrington and the president of Bombardier, Jacques Lapare, were
not specific about the cause of the problem, but Lapare said that
it became apparent only because of instrumentation on a test train
at Pueblo.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a safety issue, it's like a maintenance aspect,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   The builders are altering the stiffness of the suspension to
eliminate the problem, Lapare said.
</P>
<P>
   The delay comes on the heels of reports from the Transportation
Department and the General Accounting Office, an investigative arm
of Congress, raising questions about whether the railroad will be
ready to give up operating subsidies after 2002. The GAO
anticipates that subsidies will be required indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   Amtrak is also upgrading the tracks between Washington and
Boston, said Warrington, which should lead to improved service even
before the high-speed trains are introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Electrification of the tracks from New Haven, Conn., to Boston
will be finished in December, he said. That will allow two electric
trains that the railroad is now refurbishing to begin service on
that stretch in January, reducing travel times from New York to
Boston by 48 minutes to as much as one hour, 48 minutes. The
electricity is scheduled to be turned on Wednesday night in the
first segment, an 18-mile stretch of track west of Warwick, R.I.
</P>
<P>
   The tracks in Rhode Island have been extensively rebuilt. Nearly
400,000 railroad ties have been replaced 15 bridges have been
repaired, among other steps. The Acela will reach maximum speed
there in Rhode Island. Through much of the rest of the route the
speed of the trains will be limited by curves.
</P>
<P>
   The wheel problem is the second setback for the high-speed
train. The first was the discovery that the benefits of a tilt
mechanism, designed to improve passenger comfort in high-speed
curves, could not be fully realized. The tracks are too close
together, so that trains passing in opposite directions might
sideswipe each other. Railroad officials say, however, that the
trains should still meet the trip-time improvements called for in
the contract.
</P>
<P>
   The contract includes penalties for late delivery, beginning at
$1,000 per train per day and rising to $13,500 per train per day.
Officials said Wednesday that they did not know what the penalty
would be because they did not know how much the deliveries would be
delayed.

CONDE NAST HIRE'S HEARST EDITOR TO EDIT MADEMOISELLE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Britain )   By ALEX KUCZYNSKI   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   For the second time in two years, Conde Nast has plucked an
editor of Hearst's Cosmopolitan magazine to run one of its
magazines. Wednesday, Mandi Norwood, the editor of British
Cosmopolitan, was named editor-in-chief of Mademoiselle magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Norwood, 35, succeeds Elizabeth Crow, who resigned last week
after nearly six years as editor in chief. Last year, the editor in
chief of American Cosmopolitan, Bonnie Fuller, joined the Conde
Nast magazine Glamour.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Norwood's appointment comes at a critical time for
Mademoiselle. Circulation has slipped from 1.3 million in 1995 to
1.1 million in 1998; for the six-month period ending in June, sales
of single copies at the newsstand _ a generally reliable barometer
of consumer enthusiasm for a magazine _ dropped by 16.5 percent.
Advertising pages are down slightly: for the period from Jan. 1 to
Aug. 31 this year, the magazine sold 691 advertising pages. For the
same period last year, the figure was 819, according to the
Publishers Information Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   But most importantly, Mademoiselle _ a magazine for young women
that offers advice about career, relationships and cellulite cream
under headlines like ``Fear and Lusting at the Office'' _ has more
competitors than ever before in its 64-year history. Just last
week, Advance Publications, the parent company of Conde Nast,
acquired Fairchild Publications, which publishes one of
Mademoiselle's competitors, Jane.
</P>
<P>
   When Ms. Crow became editor in chief in 1993, Mademoiselle was
in direct competition with the mass-market titles Cosmopolitan and
Glamour. Now, ``Millie'' _ its nickname in the corridors of Conde
Nast _ faces competition from both of those titles, as well as an
ever-expanding field of relatively new women's magazines, a group
that includes Jane; Marie Claire, a joint venture between Hearst
Magazines and Marie Claire Album of France; Time Inc.'s In Style,
and even Rodale's New Woman magazine, which recently unveiled a
redesign oriented to younger readers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Norwood has been the editor of the British edition of
Cosmopolitan since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, she edited Company, a lifestyle and fashion
magazine for young women.

DOCTORS ATTMPTING TO REPAIR CHINA DETAINEE'S FRACTURES 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Daja Meston, the Boston-based scholar and activist who
suffered severe injuries while in the custody of Chinese security
officials last week, was in fair condition and undergoing extensive
medical evaluations at Brigham and Women's Hospital Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital declined to provide further information on Meston,
who arrived in Boston on a medical-evacuation aircraft around
midnight Tuesday. But Carl Williams, a human-rights activist and
friend of Meston's, said doctors are likely to work first on the
activist's crushed heels, then on his two fractured vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   Meston sustained the injuries when he jumped or fell from a
third-floor hotel room where he was undergoing prolonged
interrogation by Chinese security personnel. The Chinese detained
him, and an Australian colleague who was freed unharmed, on charges
they were conducting research illegally and taking pictures in a
restricted area.
</P>
<P>
   Sociology professor Gordon Fellman, who taught Meston when the
29-year-old former monk was enrolled in Brandeis University's
program on peace and conflict studies, said after a half-hour
hospital visit Wednesday that Meston ``was thrilled to be home, but
it seemed that the trauma of whatever they did to him was
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellman said he did not question Meston about what happened
during his detention, and said it might be weeks before Meston is
ready to discuss the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel there is a lot of emotional and physical pain,''
Fellman said. ``He is a very shy, retiring guy under the best of
circumstances. He does not want to be a public figure.''
</P>
<P>
   A Jewish-American whose parents raised him in a Tibetan Buddhist
monastery in Nepal, Meston has been daring in his efforts to rally
public sentiment against Chinese efforts to destroy Tibetan
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago he assisted US Representative Frank R. Wolf, a
Virginia Republican, in making an unauthorized trip to Tibet, after
which Wolf sharply condemned Chinese repression of the Tibetans, to
the fury of the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The trip last month was made to examine the impact on Tibetans
of a Chinese government scheme to resettle 58,000 poor farmers into
an area now dominated by Tibetan and Mongolian herdsmen. The area,
in the remote far west of China, has been designated Qinghai
Province since the Chinese conquest of Tibet, but it is part of
historic Tibet and encompasses the birthplace of the Dalai Lama,
the country's exiled spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese plan depends on financing from the World Bank to
irrigate the land. The bank board voted narrowly in favor of the
$40 million loan in late June, but only on condition that outside
observers have unrestricted access to the area to assess any danger
to indigenous people or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Tibetan activists say that because of the Chinese commitment to
open access Meston, who is more commonly known by his Tibetan name,
Wangchuk, could not have been conducting an illegal investigation,
as Chinese authorities alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Before his release, Meston signed a confession, which Williams
said was not made under duress, outlining his activities in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``He agrees with the events'' described in the document, said
Williams, the friend who helped bring Meston home from China, ``but
not . . . that it's a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Meston is able to move his legs and feet, and to
swivel his torso from side to side, despite his foot and back
injuries, but will probably need permanent pins and screws to
repair his bones.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Meston did not talk about his ordeal during a
hospital stay in Hong Kong between his departure from the Chinese
mainland and his arrival in Boston. `` `I was in hell for two
weeks,' '' he said Meston told him. `` `This (Hong Kong hospital)
is heaven.' ''

<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO, Egypt _ Israeli and Palestinian negotiators worked late
Wednesday night trying to give U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright the gift she needs for her Middle East tour _ a deal to
remove old obstacles in the peace process and let her focus on the
lofty goal of regional peace.
</P>
<P>
   But Israeli officials said talks ended after 1 a.m. (local
time), and that it was unclear when they would resume. A deadlock
could throw a wrench into Albright's plans to join Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarak in overseeing the signing of an agreement
to re-start the stalled Middle East peace process at a palace in
the ancient Egyptian port city of Alexandria Thursday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The palace was being prepared Wednesday even as negotiators in
Jerusalem postured, delivered ultimatums, called off and resumed
talks. U.S. President Bill Clinton called Mubarak and Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat Wednesday to urge a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   The land-for-security deal being considered would cover steps
that were meant to be completed months ago but floundered under
former Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. A resolution
would clear the way for Albright to turn her attention to the
larger issues still remaining in the peace process between Israel
and the Palestinians. It would also add impetus to Albright's hopes
to restart talks between Israel and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The trip comes amid expectations fueled by the presence of a new
Israeli prime minister, Ehud Barak, and indications from Arab
leaders that they are anxious to make peace. Albright's aides have
characterized the trip as the start of a push to, ``close the
circle of peace in the Middle East.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a desire to have peace,'' Albright told reporters on
her plane Wednesday. ``There is a sense we have to move on. And
what I want to do is to play a fruitful role.''
</P>
<P>
   But, first that requires a resolution of snags in the Wye River
Memorandum, which was signed in Washington by Israelis and
Palestinians nearly a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Wye itself was meant to repair the 1993 Oslo peace plan, in
which Israel was scheduled to withdraw its occupying troops from
undetermined portions of the West Bank, captured from the Arabs in
the 1967 war.
</P>
<P>
   But the Wye accords were halted in January by then-Prime
Minister Netanyahu, who originally opposed the Oslo process. Barak
promised to restart the process, but the methodical former general
wanted more certainty about the course the peace process would take
and insisted on restructuring the agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Israelis are hesitant to give up land in a process in which they
do not know the final outcome. Also, Barak worried that handing
over the 13 percent of the West Bank land set out in Wye would
endanger enclaves of Israeli settlers to Arab attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, who comes under frequent criticism for taking the
Palestinians down the Oslo path, wants to get any land as soon as
possible. Even with the Wye land, he will control only 40 percent
of the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   The deal approached Wednesday would slow down the schedule for
land hand-overs. The transfers would resume within days but be
spread through mid-January.
</P>
<P>
   By that time, the two sides would be well into discussions on
the major issues between them and of primary concern to Barak,
including whether Israel will share Jerusalem or allow millions of
Palestinian refugees return to land in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   A major snag also existed Wednesday over the release of
Palestinian prisoners, many of whom killed or tried to kill
Israelis. To Palestinians, the inmates are prisoners of war who
should be released during peacetime. Their continued detention
despite the Oslo process makes Arafat look weak. To Israelis, they
are terrorists and their release could create a political firestorm
for Barak.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides appeared to be nearing a figure between 350 and
400 prisoners, down from the 650 the Palestinians wanted.
</P>
<P>
   If such arrangements on land transfers, timetables and prisoners
are reached, they would grant little more to the Palestinians than
they felt they were already promised. But, Israel holds the land
and, under the current Wye deal, has many opportunities to halt the
process. As late as Wednesday afternoon, Barak threatened to be
especially tough in implementing Wye if Palestinians did not let
him renegotiate it.
</P>
<P>
   There have also been reports that Barak, if allowed to move
quicker into the final issues, might be willing to recognize
Palestinian statehood or give them slightly more land.
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: Begin optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to really see that we are not making concessions for
five years without having a clear understanding of what the picture
will look like when it is over,'' said Barak advisor Jacob
Goldberg.
</P>
<P>
   A Palestinian analyst said the deal could be a hard sell to the
restless Palestinian people lead by Arafat.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's exactly like Netanyahu forcing Arafat to compromise Oslo
with Wye, now Barak is forcing Arafat to compromise Wye with
this,'' said Ghassan Khatib, a former Palestinian negotiator.
``This process is becoming a process of compromising the
compromises.''
</P>
<P>
   (EDs: End optional trim.)
</P>
<P>
   But, a deal would help Albright. She has insisted she does not
want a re-run of fruitless trips under Netanyahu's term, in which
she got bogged down refereeing the details of the
Palestinian-Israeli dispute. It made all the parties look bad. Even
this trip was postponed from last month, when the negotiations
snagged.
</P>
<P>
   From Egypt, Albright is expected to travel on to Israel, Syria
and Jordan to lay the groundwork for regional peace.
</P>
<P>
   A deal between Israel and the Palestinians Thursday could put
pressure on Syria to resume long-stalled talks with Israel. Barak
has announced that he will pursue peace in the track that looks to
have the most potential.
</P>
<P>
   ``It creates a type of competition between the Palestinians and
Syrians,'' Khatib said.
</P>
<P>
   Syria seeks the return of the Golan Heights, which Israel
captured in 1967. In return, Israelis hope that Syria will rein in
anti-Israeli Hezbollah guerillas in Lebanon, a country Syria
effectively controls.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Israel would be expected to end its occupation of
southern Lebanon.

ECONOMIC SCENE: EXPLAINING THE FIXATION ON ECUADOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By MICHAEL M. WEINSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Has the looming possibility that Ecuador will default on its
foreign debts provoked an excessive amount of hand wringing? At
first glance, it surely appears so. Ecuador produces less output in
a year _ about $15 billion _ than the United States produces in a
day. The financial travails of such a pint-sized economy would not
ordinarily threaten anyone beyond its own borders.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Treasury Department and International Monetary Fund
remain fixated on Ecuador's problems for reasons that go beyond the
ordinary duty to help out a distressed country. This week Ecuador
became the first country to skip interest payments on Brady bonds _
bonds issued by Mexico, Ecuador and other Latin countries during
the debt crisis of the late 1980s and 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   Ecuador has a month to make interest payments before its Brady
bonds are technically in default. But if it does default, some
analysts worry that the Brady bonds issued by other debtor
countries will also be tarnished, scaring investors away.
</P>
<P>
   So, will Ecuador's potential default contaminate financial
markets in Latin America and beyond? The debate is lively.
</P>
<P>
   ``Probably not,'' said Albert Fishlow of Violy, Byorum &AMP;
Partners, a New York investment firm. ``Ecuador's debt problem is
understood to be far worse than that of other countries in the
region.''
</P>
<P>
   But Gary Hufbauer of the Institute for International Economics
warned that if the IMF did not handle the situation carefully,
Ecuador's problem could soon become Brazil's, Argentina's and even
sub-Saharan Africa's.
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s, Mexico, Ecuador and several other Latin
American countries had borrowed from foreign banks far beyond their
capacity to repay. The solution, spearheaded by Nicholas Brady, who
was treasury secretary in the Bush administration, was to replace
the bank loans with Brady bonds.
</P>
<P>
   The Brady bonds helped debtors and creditors. Ecuador came out
ahead because the banks agreed to knock down the value of its debt
payments by about 40 percent. The banks came out ahead because the
debtor countries put up collateral to guarantee repayment of the
principal and some interest payments.
</P>
<P>
   By eliminating some of the debt overload and creating a security
that could be easily traded, Brady bonds made it possible for
Mexico, Ecuador and others to re-enter foreign capital markets, a
necessary step to raising their depressed economies.
</P>
<P>
   But floods and a plunge in the price of oil, a key export,
rocked Ecuador's finances last year. Political paralysis has
prevented Ecuador from closing a huge deficit by raising taxes or
by ending expensive subsidies for gasoline and other consumer
products.
</P>
<P>
   Fishlow said that Ecuador's debt was perhaps three times
greater, comparative to the size of its economy, than that of its
neighbors. Its foreign debt exceeds $13 billion, of which about $6
billion is in Brady bonds. According to Lehman Brothers, the
country spends over 30 percent of its budget on interest payments.
Few experts believe that Ecuador can repay all of its debt.
</P>
<P>
   The IMF is negotiating a bailout package that would provide
about $400 million in direct aid and release another $800 million
from other international institutions. The fund will require
Ecuador to reduce its deficit. The fund will also insist that
Ecuador negotiate debt relief from its private creditors _ a new
direction for the IMF, designed to insulate it from criticism that
the money it would pump into Ecuador would flow right back out to
pay off private creditors.
</P>
<P>
   But David Roberts, international economist for Bank of America
Securities, warned that current holders of Brady bonds were the
wrong target for the fund's new policy toward private creditors.
``The banks that originally took Brady bonds in exchange for
existing loans already wrote down the value of their loans,'' he
said. ``If the fund becomes cavalier toward current holders of
Brady bonds, it threatens to drive the right type of foreign
lenders out of Latin America.'' If the IMF encourages Ecuador to
force a legal default, he warned, ``it will create a legal mess.''
</P>
<P>
   Hufbauer agreed: ``Brady bonds helped countries pull themselves
out of depression. The Bradys were thought of as superior debt,
protected by collateral and a firm resolve to repay in full. For
the fund to appear to be forcing Ecuador to default on these loans
could make it impossible to use this device again.''
</P>
<P>
   Hufbauer conceded that Ecuador could not pay all of its debts
and must negotiate relief. What worried him was the possible role
of the fund in insisting on default on the Brady bonds.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hood of J.P. Morgan disagreed, warning, ``Do not
sanctify Brady debt.'' It trades like other debt, he said, and its
holders need to provide some debt relief.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the debate is not so much about Ecuador as about the
fund's role in forcing further losses on the holders of Brady
bonds. Why, some economists ask, should those who helped save Latin
America be treated as villains? Because, says the other side, they
are among the only sacrificial lambs available.

DIABETES SINGLED OUT AS HEART DISEASE RISK 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Budgeted as Diabetes-Risk)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DOLORES KONG  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In a new strategy to attack the nation's No. 1 killer, the
American Heart Association is for the first time Wednesday called
diabetes a major risk factor for heart disease, ranking it with
high blood pressure and smoking.
</P>
<P>
   Adding particular weight to the announcement, which is being
formally published in the association's journal Circulation next
week, is the support being thrown behind it by the National
Institutes of Health, the American Diabetes Association and the
Juvenile Diabetes Foundation International.
</P>
<P>
   The move comes as scientific evidence is emerging about the
relationships between the two diseases, which affect millions of
Americans, and as the US demographics are changing and putting more
people at risk of adult-onset, or type 2, diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the aging of the population, the growth in obesity and
the increase in the number of minorities who are at higher risk in
this country are already starting to lead to an increase in type 2
diabetes, say health officials. And that suggests that the nation's
successes so far in addressing heart disease might also be reversed
if nothing is done, they say.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the predominant reason for the American Heart
Association giving attention to this area,'' said Dr. Robert H.
Eckel, chairman of the group's nutrition committee, which worked on
the scientific statement on diabetes and heart disease. ``As type 2
diabetes increases. . ., the relationship to heart disease can only
increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Peter J. Savage, deputy director of the division of
epidemiology and clinical applications at the National Heart, Lung
and Blood Insitute (NHLBI), agreed. ``Diabetes is becoming an even
more important risk factor.''
</P>
<P>
   The heart association's naming of diabetes as a major modifiable
risk factor is one of three additions it has made since 1992 _
obesity and sedentary lifestyle being the other two. Previous
additions occured in the 1960s, when high blood pressure and
cholesterol were included.
</P>
<P>
   Health officials hope the listing of diabetes will focus the
attention of patients and physicians on preventing or aggressively
treating the disease and its complications.
</P>
<P>
   opt trim this graph A new generation of drugs to control blood
sugar levels and studies showing the importance of strictly
regulating blood pressure and cholesterol levels for diabetics are
available, but the word has not yet filtered down to many primary
care physicians and patients, say heart and diabetes specialists.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of that could be better treated, but it is just not being
done,'' said Dr. William Castelli, former director of the federally
funded Framingham Heart Study and now director of the Framingham
Cardiovascular Institute. In addition to the national campaigns
that already exist against high cholesterol, high blood pressure
and smoking, ``we need a campaign against high blood sugar and we
also need a campaign against obesity.''
</P>
<P>
   Nearly 1 million Americans a year die from cardiovascular
disease, while more than 59 million suffer from some form of it,
whether it be heart disease, high blood pressure, or stroke.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 10.3 million Americans have been diagnosed with
diabetes, while another 15 million are believed to have undiagnosed
diabetes or elevated blood sugar levels not yet high enough to be
called diabetes. All of them are at greater risk of heart disease,
up to four times greater than people who have normal blood sugar
levels.
</P>
<P>
   But because diabetes is rarely, if ever, listed on death
certificates, the disease ``is very much underestimated as a
contributor to death rates,'' said Dr. Judy Fradkin, deputy
director of the division of diabetes, endocrinology and metabolic
disorders for the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and
Kidney Diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Yet studies have found that about 80 percent of people with
diabetes go on to develop some form of cardiovascular disease, said
Fradkin, whose agency joined the National Heart, Lung and Blood
Institute and the diabetes groups in supporting the heart
association's statement in an editorial in Circulation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about time that they pay a little more attention to
diabetes,'' said Dr. Om Ganda, senior physician at the Joslin
Diabetes Center and an associate clinical professor of medicine at
Harvard Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   While a family history places people at greater risk of type 2
diabetes, so does being overweight, increasing age and being a
member of a minority group. The United States has one of the
highest rates in the world of both diabetes and heart disease,
largely as a result of the sedentary lifestyle and poor diet here.
And blacks, Latinos, Asians and Native Americans have some of the
highest rates of diabetes in the United States, according to Ganda.

 &HT;    Taking control of canal top challenge in Panama, diplomat says
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Neither Mireya Moscoso, who was sworn in Wednesday as
the new president of Panama, nor her Arnulfista Party has any
significant experience in governing. And she and her allies will
have little time to learn as they face the dual _ and inseparable _
challenges of invigorating their nation's economy and taking
control of the Panama Canal, said Robert Pastor, a diplomat and
Emory University professor.
</P>
<P>
   ``The canal is so important to Panama's economy, you can't
really separate one from the other,'' Pastor said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But, despite the importance of the moment, the Clinton
administration has done little to help ensure a smooth transition
of the canal's control, Pastor said.
</P>
<P>
   The key question, he said, is: ``How do we help her make this
transition? I don't hear anyone in the administration asking, let
alone answering, that question.''
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso, 54, took the oath of office 31 years after her husband,
Arnulfo Arias, was overthrown by Gen. Omar Torrijos. Moscoso won
election in May by defeating Martin Torrijos, the late dictator's
son.
</P>
<P>
   In her inaugural address, Moscoso pledged ``efficient and
responsible'' administration of the canal. ``My government intends
to increase the autonomy of the canal so it may operate without any
partisan political influence,'' she told a cheering crowd of 25,000
at Panama City's new baseball stadium.
</P>
<P>
   Pastor has played a significant role in recent Panamanian
history. Working on the National Security Council during President
Jimmy Carter's administration, Pastor helped negotiate the treaty
that calls for the transfer of the canal to Panamanian control by
the end of this year.
</P>
<P>
   And in 1989, he negotiated an agreement with Panamanian
strongman Manuel Noriega to allow Carter and others to monitor a
Panama election. Carter declared that election fraudulent _ helping
create an atmosphere that, though it was not Carter's intent,
helped legitimize the U.S. invasion of Panama under President
George Bush later that year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994, President Clinton nominated Pastor to become ambassador
to Panama, but the appointment was blocked by Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.), chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Moscoso is the second freely elected president since the 1989
invasion. Pastor said the importance of her assumption of power is
that voters decided to switch parties.
</P>
<P>
   ``This represents a step toward consolidating democracy,'' he
said. ``Whenever you have a peaceful change in administration from
one party to its opposition in a fragile democracy, then that's an
encouraging step.''
</P>
<P>
   Transfer of the operations of the canal _ running the locks and
making sure shipping travels well _ should go smoothly, he said,
because the Panamanians have long experience at it, Pastor said.
</P>
<P>
   But transfer of the canal's facilities and bases and security
planning are going poorly, he said. And neither government has had
the foresight to give much consideration to security issues, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   But Pastor dismissed concern expressed by Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott (R-Miss.) that, in hiring Hong Kong-based Hutchison
Whampoa Ltd. to manage some canal ports, Panama has given China
control over the waterway. ``Among the many fears that are being
voiced by members of Congress, this idea must rank among the most
absurd,'' Pastor said.

SUBURU ROLLS OUT HUGE CAMPAIGN, BUT STICKS TO FAMILIAR THEMES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.J., Australia, Japan)   By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Suburu is rolling out the largest advertising campaign in its
history, but don't expect to see a new cast of characters or any
other drastic changes to its existing theme. Instead, the company
is sticking by an old adage: ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hogan of ``Crocodile Dundee'' fame continues as Subaru's
spokesman in the integrated campaign from Subaru's agency of six
years, Temerlin McClain in Irving, Texas, and the campaign
continues to emphasize safety and performance features, including
all-wheel-drive technology. Subaru, however, is doubling the amount
of broadcast and print placements and backing the ads with $70
million to $80 million to push its revamped Legacy line and its
2000 Forester model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subaru understands who they are,'' said David Lyon, group
account director at Temerlin McClain, a unit of True North
Communications. He added, ``That's why you see consistency, focus,
continuity, and you see the courage to stay with what's working.''
</P>
<P>
   Clive Chajet, chairman of Chajet Consultancy, a brand and
corporate image company in New York, agrees that sticking to a
similar format seems to be the right formula for the Subaru of
America unit of Fuji Heavy Industries of Japan. ``Given the
intensity of the noise level of automobile advertising, essentially
the only way they are breaking through the clutter is staying with
what they already have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest campaign for the company's redesigned Legacy
models, which include the Outback wagon, the Outback sedan and the
Legacy GT, the overall slogan is still, ``The beauty of all-wheel
drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nine new television commercials, which began running
nationally last month, are for the Outback models. In one spot for
the Outback sedan, a sleek black car is shown cruising through a
city and passing imagery of the Australian Outback, including a
woman walking a kangaroo on a leash, crocodiles in potholes and a
herd of sheep crossing the street at a crosswalk. Hogan steps out
of his Subaru and says, ``My kind of town.''
</P>
<P>
   A spot for the Outback Sport vehicle, which is aimed at younger
consumers, shows Hogan tagging along with his nephew en route to an
outdoor concert. The two drive on a dirt road through a variety of
obstacles to demonstrate the car's performance and horsepower. As
they reach their destination, passing tattooed fellow concertgoers,
the nephew says, ``This might not be your type of crowd, Uncle,''
to find Hogan already body surfing in the mosh pit. The Outback tag
line is, ``The world's first sport utility wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   A third commercial to demonstrate the traction and control of
all-wheel-drive technology has Hogan in the classic Subaru chase
scenario in the jungle. Two other spots for the Forester emphasize
its carlike handling and that it is easier to climb into than other
sport utility vehicles. The Forester slogan is, ``Sport utility
tough, car easy.'' Another commercial, showcases the entire line of
Subaru's all-wheel- drive vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone would look at the work and say there is a
significant departure from what we have done,'' Lyon said, ``though
we have done some things differently to call attention to the fact
that we have a new car.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, who has been in the Subaru campaign for five years
``represents everything we want to say about this car _ that it's
rugged, it's adventurous, it can provide the driver with a lot of
confidence and that it's fun,'' Lyon said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``We had to find a way to use Paul a little
differently to make sure that we signal news that we have a new car
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cyphers, vice president for marketing at Subaru in Cherry
Hill, N.J., said the company's sales figures were argument enough
for continuing with the current theme. ``We've had three wonderful
years back to back _ each year is better than the last,'' he said.
``And this past year was our best sales year in over 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six years, Subaru said that sales in the United
States had grown more than 50 percent. As of July, Subaru had sold
85,478 cars this year, up 8 percent, from the corresponding period
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   `` Hogan continues to work for us. The type of ads that we do
continue to work, and we are targeting those people with the active
life style who have a high propensity to buy our cars,'' Cyphers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Subaru buyers are college-educated, make approximately
$75,000 annually and enjoy an active life style involving canoeing,
hiking and skiing, Cyphers said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyon added that Subaru was also trying to win over consumers who
had become disillusioned with sport utility vehicles, which are
essentially light trucks and have poor fuel economy.
</P>
<P>
   As Subaru has brought itself back from a string of declining
sales ending in the early 1990s, it has grown from a marketer of
niche products like front- and four-wheel-drive vehicles that were
positioned as cheap and reliable to a full-line producer of
mainstream offerings like upscale all-wheel-drive sedans, sports
utility wagons and the Forester sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The print portion of the campaign gives readers glimpses into
the active, outdoor-oriented life styles of Subaru owners. Six ads
began appearing in the August issues of publications including
Automobile, National Geographic, Outside, People, Southern Living,
Smithsonian and Time. All the ads refer consumers to a refurbished
Subaru corporate Web site, subaru.com or to a special site designed
to showcase the new line, 2000.subaru.com. In addition to search
engines like Yahoo, Subaru interactive banner ads have been placed
on sites like Autobytel and Carpoint. &QL;

DOCTORS ATTMPTING TO REPAIR CHINA DETAINEE'S FRACTURES

<P>
   BOSTON -- Daja Meston, the Boston-based scholar and activist who
suffered severe injuries while in the custody of Chinese security
officials last week, was in fair condition and undergoing extensive
medical evaluations at Brigham and Women's Hospital Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The hospital declined to provide further information on Meston,
who arrived in Boston on a medical-evacuation aircraft around
midnight Tuesday. But Carl Williams, a human-rights activist and
friend of Meston's, said doctors are likely to work first on the
activist's crushed heels, then on his two fractured vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   Meston sustained the injuries when he jumped or fell from a
third-floor hotel room where he was undergoing prolonged
interrogation by Chinese security personnel. The Chinese detained
him, and an Australian colleague who was freed unharmed, on charges
they were conducting research illegally and taking pictures in a
restricted area.
</P>
<P>
   Sociology professor Gordon Fellman, who taught Meston when the
29-year-old former monk was enrolled in Brandeis University's
program on peace and conflict studies, said after a half-hour
hospital visit Wednesday that Meston ``was thrilled to be home, but
it seemed that the trauma of whatever they did to him was
overwhelming.''
</P>
<P>
   Fellman said he did not question Meston about what happened
during his detention, and said it might be weeks before Meston is
ready to discuss the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel there is a lot of emotional and physical pain,''
Fellman said. ``He is a very shy, retiring guy under the best of
circumstances. He does not want to be a public figure.''
</P>
<P>
   A Jewish-American whose parents raised him in a Tibetan Buddhist
monastery in Nepal, Meston has been daring in his efforts to rally
public sentiment against Chinese efforts to destroy Tibetan
culture.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago he assisted US Representative Frank R. Wolf, a
Virginia Republican, in making an unauthorized trip to Tibet, after
which Wolf sharply condemned Chinese repression of the Tibetans, to
the fury of the Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   The trip last month was made to examine the impact on Tibetans
of a Chinese government scheme to resettle 58,000 poor farmers into
an area now dominated by Tibetan and Mongolian herdsmen. The area,
in the remote far west of China, has been designated Qinghai
Province since the Chinese conquest of Tibet, but it is part of
historic Tibet and encompasses the birthplace of the Dalai Lama,
the country's exiled spiritual leader.
</P>
<P>
   The Chinese plan depends on financing from the World Bank to
irrigate the land. The bank board voted narrowly in favor of the
$40 million loan in late June, but only on condition that outside
observers have unrestricted access to the area to assess any danger
to indigenous people or the environment.
</P>
<P>
   Tibetan activists say that because of the Chinese commitment to
open access Meston, who is more commonly known by his Tibetan name,
Wangchuk, could not have been conducting an illegal investigation,
as Chinese authorities alleged.
</P>
<P>
   Before his release, Meston signed a confession, which Williams
said was not made under duress, outlining his activities in China.
</P>
<P>
   ``He agrees with the events'' described in the document, said
Williams, the friend who helped bring Meston home from China, ``but
not . . . that it's a crime.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Meston is able to move his legs and feet, and to
swivel his torso from side to side, despite his foot and back
injuries, but will probably need permanent pins and screws to
repair his bones.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said Meston did not talk about his ordeal during a
hospital stay in Hong Kong between his departure from the Chinese
mainland and his arrival in Boston. `` `I was in hell for two
weeks,' '' he said Meston told him. `` `This (Hong Kong hospital)
is heaven.' ''

 &HT;    Milosevic releases 2 CARE workers from prison; 1 remains
 &HT;    By Don Melvin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Three weeks ago, Samira Pratt said she would like
nothing better than to have her husband, languishing in a Yugoslav
prison, released in time for the birth of their first child.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's my husband, and I really need him,'' she said from
Canberra, Australia.
</P>
<P>
   The baby was due Aug. 30. But she may yet get her wish.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic released two
employees of the relief organization CARE Australia _ Peter Wallace
and Samira Pratt's husband, Steve.
</P>
<P>
   The baby is overdue. But if Steve Pratt can make it to Australia
in good time, he may yet help with the birth.
</P>
<P>
   Pratt and Wallace, both Australians, were arrested March 31 as
they tried to leave Yugoslavia shortly after the start of the NATO
bombing campaign. On April 8, a third CARE Australia employee,
Branko Jelen, a Yugoslav citizen, also was arrested.
</P>
<P>
   Espionage charges against the three were dropped, but they were
convicted by a closed military court of passing secret information
out of the country. After appeals for sentence reduction were
granted, Pratt was still left with a prison term of eight years;
Wallace was left with one year and Jelen was left with three.
</P>
<P>
   CARE officials have maintained that the men did nothing wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The three appealed for clemency on humanitarian grounds. On
Wednesday, after meeting with former Australian Prime Minister
Malcolm Fraser, who is chairman of CARE Australia's board of
directors, Milosevic ordered Pratt and Wallace released.
</P>
<P>
   Jelen, however, remains in prison.
</P>
<P>
   After meeting with Milosevic, Fraser traveled to the prison, an
hour or more outside of Belgrade. There, according to Peter Bell,
president of CARE USA, an affiliated relief organization based in
Atlanta, Fraser met the governor of the prison, ``shared a glass of
plum brandy, and walked out with the two prisoners.''
</P>
<P>
   The men were taken to Croatia, and are expected to travel to
Great Britain, where they will be counseled by psychologists
experienced in treating prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is good news, but it's incomplete,'' said Bell. CARE
officials will not be satisfied _ nor will they discuss resuming
humanitarian operations in Yugoslavia _ until Jelen is released.
</P>
<P>
   ``We re determined to keep a light focused on him,'' Bell said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the atmosphere at CARE USA headquarters in Atlanta
was festive, and the feeling of relief was palpable. One worker
posted a sign out front that said, simply, ``They're Free.''
</P>
<P>
   CARE Australia chief executive Charles Tapp accompanied Wallace
and Pratt to Croatia.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're both stunned and amazed to be free,'' he told
Australian Associated Press. ``They're in reasonable condition
given what they've been through. I'm going to take them for a beer
tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   The men were buoyed by support from around the world. Former
President Jimmy Carter wrote Milosevic a letter supporting the
men's release, thousands of people wrote letters and e-mails, and
children in Atlanta _ the sons and daughters of CARE employees _
drew pictures for the men to use in decorating their cell.
</P>
<P>
   CARE employees speculated that Pratt, who is scheduled to
participate in a news conference from London today, may bolt for
Australia as quickly as he can.
</P>
<P>
   He had sent a message to CARE workers asking that they buy his
wife a stuffed bear as a present. Now, they hope he will deliver
the present himself _ and arrive in time to help his wife deliver
the baby.

c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``All the Little Animals'' is the type of movie you could
describe as deceptively simple, if only it weren't so intent on
telling you that it's deceptively simple. It's an allegorical
little movie about an innocent's struggle between father figures _
and about other themes that you might not notice at first blush,
except that the movie is so intent on putting them across.
</P>
<P>
   The innocent is a British lad named Bobby (Christian Bale), who
hasn't been running at full mental speed since he was injured in a
car accident as a child. For most of his life, Bobby has remained
inside his London house, playing with his pet mouse and only
occasionally interacting with other people. After his doting mother
dies, he's left in the hands of a calculating stepfather (Daniel
Benzali), who threatens to put Bobby in a home if he doesn't sign
over the family department store. Driven to desperate measures,
Bobby discovers _ almost by accident _ that although he feels like
a prisoner in the house, all he has to do to escape is walk away.
</P>
<P>
   And walk he does, and hitchhike, till he's nearly reached the
Cornwall region of the southwest English coast a few hundred miles
from London. It's there that he meets Mr. Summers (John Hurt), a
curmudgeonly hermit sort who has little use for other people but
finds enough sweetness in Bobby to enlist him in his daily task:
making sure that all the area's road kill receives a decent burial.
</P>
<P>
   On the surface, this looks like another quirky indie story, but
it's also a parable about city vs. country, greed vs. altruism,
and, of course, good vs. evil. Director Jeremy Thomas, working from
Walker Hamilton's novel, almost scuttles the material because he's
too reverential toward its subtle ecological undertones. It's hard
to miss subtleties in a movie in which the bad guy is named Mr.
DeWinter and the good guy Mr. Summers.
</P>
<P>
   As Bobby, Bale is a little annoying _ he's the type of actor who
communicates sweet naivete by perpetually leaving his mouth hanging
open. He's stuck between more accomplished pros, although Benzali's
deftly malevolent performance is undercut a little bit by his
unfortunate resemblance to Austin Powers' Dr. Evil. As for Hurt, he
could probably play a cantankerous sort like Mr. Summers in his
sleep; his only false note here is an overplayed temper tantrum
that looks to be as much a fault of the directing as of his acting.
</P>
<P>
   Two-thirds of the way through, the movie takes a turn from its
allegorical bent to more standard suspense, which Thomas builds
surprisingly well. The climax has its pros and cons. Coming after
more lyrical, literary segments, it feels like a degeneration into
the violent norm. But it also ups the interest level in a movie
that sometimes takes itself too seriously.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the Little Animals'' is rated R for brief but relatively
graphic violence.
</P>
<P>

AUTO SALES   JUMP SHARPLY   IN AUGUST  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mich.)   By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ In a sign that strong consumer spending continued to
power the American economy last month, many auto makers announced
Wednesday that their sales soared in August, with the biggest
growth occurring for some of the most expensive models with the
highest profits.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler AG said that its Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth, Jeep
and Mercedes-Benz brands had their best August ever, together
climbing 9.6 percent from already brisk sales in August 1998. Honda
Motor reported that its sales had climbed 10.5 percent in August
from a year earlier, to the highest level ever for any month, while
Toyota Motor reported its best August ever in the United States
with a 2.8 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors said that its sales jumped 63.4 percent. But its
sales in August of last year were severely depressed because a
54-day strike had just ended and dealerships had not yet been
restocked with popular models.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives and dealers were jubilant about the strength of
the market last month. ``It was unbelievable, it was as hot as
Texas,'' said Alan B. Helfman, a Chrysler, Plymouth and Jeep dealer
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly sales of new automobiles have long been an important
barometer of the economy's health, because they account for 4
percent of the nation's economic output and because auto makers
announce the sales immediately at the start of the next month. Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, made his reputation
as an economic consultant while working for the steel and auto
industries in the 1950s and 1960s. He has watched auto sales
reports closely ever since, although noting that the auto
industry's role in the economy has diminished somewhat over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle E. Gramley, a former Federal Reserve Board governor and now
a consulting economist for the Mortgage Bankers' Association of
America, said the soaring sales increased the chances that the
central bank would raise short-term interest rates at the next
meeting of its interest-rate policy committee on Oct. 5,
particularly if other economic indicators showed the same strength
as the August auto sales.
</P>
<P>
   While the minutes of recent committee meetings show that the Fed
keeps expecting consumers to become satiated with big-ticket
purchases and slow their spending, Gramley said, ``These auto sales
say it is not happening.''
</P>
<P>
   In another indication of economic strength, the Conference
Board, a New York business group, said Wednesday that the Index of
Leading Economic Indicators had shown an increase of three-tenths
of a percent in July. But the Commerce Department announced
separately that construction spending was surprisingly weak in
July, which could mean that the Federal Reserve's two small
interest-rate increases this summer are starting to hurt the
housing market.
</P>
<P>
   But the rate increases seem to be having little effect on the
auto market. ``Demand has exceeded our expectations and everyone
else's in the industry,'' said Paul Ballew, GM's general director
of industry and market analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for sales and
marketing operations, said that the pace of sales actually
increased after the Fed's most recent increase in short-term rates,
on Aug. 24. ``We closed 3 or 4 percent higher than we had
forecasted in the middle of the month,'' he said. ``There are a lot
of people who have made a lot of money in the stock market, and it
seems like they're cashing it out.''
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler also raised Wednesday its forecast for auto
sales next year, predicting very strong sales of 16 million
vehicles, including heavy trucks. That would be a little less than
this year, which is on course for a record 17.2 million vehicles,
according to DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility vehicles sold best last month, followed by pickup
trucks, with cars and minivans trailing. Auto makers and dealers
make their biggest profits on sport utility vehicles because supply
has outstripped demand, allowing many models to be sold at full
retail price with little discounting.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of new designs has increased competition in the
market for mid-sized sport utility vehicles. But with
DaimlerChrysler offering lower-cost leases on the Jeep Grand
Cherokee this summer, sales shot up last month to the highest level
ever, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Helfman said that while his dealership stocked a dozen models of
cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles, just one model, the Jeep
Grand Cherokee, accounted for 100 of the 210 vehicles sold last
month. If Chrysler, Plymouth or Jeep built an even larger sport
utility vehicle, the size of a Ford Expedition, it would sell
extremely well too, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a big one, there'd be another 30 or 40 sales _ man,
we'd be eating caviar down here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor is scheduled to release its sales figures on
Thursday. Auto analysts predict that it will show only a small gain
from a year ago, when Ford dealerships profited from the lack of
inventory at rival GM dealerships. Without Ford's sales, auto
makers' market shares cannot be calculated precisely. Ballew said
that GM's share should be ``pretty close'' to 30 percent, the
company's target.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Motor, which has been struggling, reported a 7.7 percent
drop in sales last month from a year ago. But Subaru, a unit of
Fuji Heavy Industries, announced that August was its best month in
12 years, with a 9 percent improvement from last year, while
Mitsubishi Motors said that its sales had jumped 43 percent.
Volkswagen, which has been riding the popularity of the New Beetle
and the mid-sized Passat sedan and wagon, posted a 34 percent
increase in August sales.

   DILI, East Timor _ In the most brazen violence since Monday's
generally peaceful vote on the future of this tiny island
territory, gun- and machete-toting pro-Indonesia militias and
rock-hurling backers of independence clashed outside UN
headquarters here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The militias shot and hacked to death one man and chased, beat,
and shot at journalists and United Nations workers. At least a
half-dozen Timorese were seriously injured in the melee.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesian police, who are responsible for keeping the peace in
the disputed territory, took more than an hour to send
reinforcements to the chaotic scene. Officers firing weapons were
able to restore order after about half an hour.
</P>
<P>
   The escalating violence prompted an emergency meeting of the UN
Security Council in New York and calls from New Zealand for an
international military force to maintain order in East Timor, a
former Portuguese colony that was forcibly annexed by Indonesia 23
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Some 150 locals, UN staff, and journalists scrambled over the
walls into the UN compound and hid in cars to escape clubbings and
gunfire by militia members, who wore black T-shirts and
red-and-white headbands representing Indonesia's national colors.
After attending the funeral of one of their comrades killed in an
earlier clash, the militias marched into a pro-independence
neighborhood near the UN compound and set up roadblocks.
</P>
<P>
   Two houses were torched and three large fires blazed outside the
compound, spewing black smoke. Outnumbered Indonesian soldiers at a
nearby military post locked their gates rather than intervene to
stop the violence.
</P>
<P>
   The situation here appeared to be deteriorating sharply just two
days after an estimated 99 percent of the population turned out in
a largely peaceful vote to choose between autonomy under Indonesian
rule and full independence for the former Portuguese colony. With
the people of East Timor, population 800,000, believed to have
voted for independence by a wide margin, pro-Indonesia militias
broke promises to lay down their arms and resumed a seven-month
campaign that has destabilized the territory.
</P>
<P>
   Human rights groups and diplomats have evidence that the
Indonesian military has supplied weapons and training to militias,
many of which formed to oppose Indonesian President B. J. Habibie's
January pledge to let East Timor decide its own future in a
UN-sponsored vote.
</P>
<P>
   There were unconfirmed reports Wednesday night that five people
had been killed in the clash in Dili, and journalists saw a
half-dozen people in one local clinic who were wounded by gunfire.
The streets of Dili were empty, and large groups of people were
seen fleeing their homes for the hills above the capital.
</P>
<P>
   The violence prompted Portugal, the territory's onetime colonial
power, to demand that Indonesia keep its pledge to maintain peace
whatever the result of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   In New York, UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan called on police
``to arrest those responsible for the violence and to take
immediate steps to ensure it does not happen again.'' His spokesman
said it was unlikely that UN troops would be sent to the territory,
since Indonesia is responsible for security.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's representative asked UN officials to come up with
``ideas for contingency plans'' if the situation in East Timor
spirals out of control, but the Security Council would not discuss
the possibility for fear it would further destabilize the
situation, UN sources said.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia objects to bringing in any UN peacekeepers, and a few
hundred unarmed UN civilian police allowed in have been unable to
stop armed groups from rampaging.
</P>
<P>
   New Zealand Foreign Affairs Minister Don McKinnon said in
Wellington that if conditions worsen, New Zealand, Australia,
Japan, and the United States should send in a peacekeeping force
independent of the UN.
</P>
<P>
   But Australia, the only major nation to give recognition to
Indonesia's rule over East Timor, said it would not join any non-UN
force. Australia is anxious not to tread on the toes of neighboring
Indonesia, but its military is believed to have prepared troops for
deployment in East Timor if necessary.
</P>
<P>
   UN officials collected ballot boxes in Dili to prevent counting
fraud and to maintain the secrecy of how each local district voted.
Officials began tallying votes Wednesday, and results will be
announced in New York next week.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia invaded East Timor, an island territory the size of
Connecticut on the eastern end of the Indonesian island chain, in
1975, shortly after Portugal withdrew from the colony. An estimated
200,000 people died in the next five years from civil war,
guerrilla fighting, starvation, and disease.
</P>
<P>
   If the vote goes for independence, the UN-brokered plan calls
for Indonesian forces to remain until the parliament in Jakarta
revokes its annexation of East Timor when it meets this fall. Only
then, the UN has said, would it consider sending in peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
   Indonesia's military commander in East Timor, Colonel Mohammad
Muis, said his forces were on full alert. Jakarta said 360 officers
of an elite unit would fly in Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Charles Costello, head of an observer delegation from the
Atlanta-based Carter Center, said, ``The Indonesian government
needs to recognize there will now be calls for stronger
international action if they fail to fulfill their obligations'' to
maintain order under agreements signed in May at the United
Nations.

MEDICAL SCHOOLS SEE DECLINE IN ENROLLMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of applicants to medical schools declined nearly 5
percent last year, continuing a downward trend since applications
peaked in 1996, according to a study published Wednesday in the
Journal of the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   The author of the study and others in the field said the trend
may result from cyclical patterns in applications, which tend to
dip in prosperous times when students have more options for
high-paying careers.
</P>
<P>
   Other factors may include a toughening job market for recent
medical school graduates, and doctors' complaints of excessive
paperwork and a loss of autonomy brought on by the growth of
managed care.
</P>
<P>
   Applications reached an all-time high in 1996, when 46,968
people applied for roughly 16,200 openings at the 125 medical
schools accredited by the American Medical Association.
</P>
<P>
   But since then applications have dropped about 12 percent, to
41,004 last year. Figures for 1999 are not yet available, but Dr.
Barbara Barzansky, the principal researcher and director of medical
schools services for the American Medical Association, said
applications in May were down 2,000 from the same time last year.
</P>
<P>
   The number of applications from minorities _ blacks, American
Indians, Mexican Americans and Puerto Ricans _ also declined at
higher rates. Since 1996, Barzansky said, the drop among that group
was 12.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The data set off a round of speculation over how to explain the
trend.
</P>
<P>
   Barzansky said a decline in the number of doctors is not likely
because medical schools were still drawing two or three people per
available slot and there is no indication the quality of candidates
is declining, since grade point average and medical college
admission test scores have remained about the same over the past
few years.
</P>
<P>
   But the dip in underrepresented minorities raises some concern
because it comes amid aggressive recruiting of minorities by
medical schools, she said. One explanation could be reverberations
from affirmative action debates, leading some minority students to
believe there are fewer opportunities at the schools, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A continuation of that trend could hold broader implications.
``Students who are from minority groups are more likely to serve
minority groups,'' she said. ``In addition, there is a feeling a
diverse student body is considered a good learning experience for
everybody.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Andrew Frantz, the associate dean of Columbia University's
College of Physicians and Surgeons, said that there were a little
more than 3,000 applicants for 150 spots last year at his college,
a decline of more than a 1,000 since 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Frantz noted that applications also rose and fell during the
1970s and 1980s, usually in stride with the economy. He said he was
not alarmed because there is hardly a shortage of doctors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the boom we've had since 1995 has encouraged people to
think they can make more money elsewhere,'' Frantz said. ``I'm
being partly facetious but I do suspect it has something to do with
the economic boom, and if and when our next recession comes we will
see an increase.''
</P>
<P>
   Jordon Cohen, president of the American Association of Medical
Colleges, agreed that the economy may explain the trend but also
attributed it to the growth of managed care. ``It's hard to argue
that it is not playing some role,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for the American Association of
Health Plans, a trade group based in Washington that represents
1,000 managed care organizations, said blaming managed care was
``too simplistic.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a transition going on from the old system to the new
system and I think people who want medicine as a career will not be
daunted by the challenges,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pisano suggested an oversupply of doctors as another factor.
The Journal of the American Medical Association last year reported
that one quarter of physicians who recently completed residency
training reported difficulty in finding employment.

FASTER NEW YORK-TO-BOSTON TRAINS SEEN

   WASHINGTON _ Trying to take a sting out of the delay in the
Northeast Corridor high-speed rail line, Amtrak officials promised
Wednesday that travelers will have a somewhat speedier ride between
Boston and New York City in January, when the line is fully
electrified.
</P>
<P>
   The electrified service, which now run only between New York and
New Haven, will be completed soon after the New Year and will shave
48 minutes to an hour and 40 minutes off the Boston-New York trip,
Amtrak President George Warrington told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The high-speed line, which will shorten the Boston-New York trip
to about 3 hours, and the New York-Washington route to about 2
hours, will be delayed until spring because of mechanical troubles
with the new trains, Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   The wheels are scraping against the tracks, presenting a
maintenance headache, but not a safety problem, said Jacques
Lapare, president of the Montreal-based Bombardier Transportation,
North America, one of the two companies building equipment for the
high-speed line.
</P>
<P>
   While travelers are being mollified, the consortium building the
high-speed trains is being punished. For every day Bombardier and
the France-based ALSTOM are late, they will have to pay a fine of
up to $270,000, Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   The delay is embarrassing to Amtrak, which has been touting the
fast, luxurious new line. But waiting is preferable to rushing
ahead with a substandard system, Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about taking the time necessary to make the trains
right,'' Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   While testing the French-modeled trains in Pueblo, Colo.,
manufacturers found that too much pressure was being put on the
wheels when the trains sped around the curves of the American
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanics have to fiddle with the suspension systems to create
more ``give'' for the wheels, so they do not scape the tracks,
Lapare said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delay is unfortunate, but not unusual when new technology
is being introduced into a new environment,'' Lapare said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim RePass, president of the National Corridors Initiative that
has been pushing hard for a high-speed line for a decade, lauded
Warrington for making ``a good management decision, instead of a
political decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to delay the system and have it work right, rather than
meet a deadline that's media-driven,'' said RePass, who was a
management consultant before heading the advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Amtrak nor Bombardier officials would say which of the
two firms in the consortium would have to pay the fines, although
ALSTOM is responsible for the train construction, said Amtrak
spokesman Rick Remington.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of how to apportion the penalty burden is something
that ``will be worked out within the consortium,'' said Lapare of
Bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, which will range from $1,000 to $13,500 per day for
each of the 20 train sets ordered, will not be determined until the
fixed trains are delivered and the financial damage is assessed,
Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   The other elements of Amtrak's $2.6 billion project are on track
and will be delivered as scheduled, Warrington said. Improvements
to the lines, including repairs of bridges and replacement of
wooden ties with concrete ties, will be done this year, Remington
said.
</P>
<P>
   Once electrification of the remaining segment of the New
York-Boston line is finished by early January, Amtrak will run four
round-trip trains per day, Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   On slower trains that make four stops and now chug for well over
five hours between New York and Boston, the time would be shortened
to about three hours and 50 minutes. When the high-speed train is
introduced later in the spring, the time will be cut to three
hours, Remington said.
</P>
<P>
   The new trains have been operating at 165 miles per hour in
testing but will operate at only 150 miles per hour once put to
use, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warrington said he could not estimate how much the delay would
cost Amtrak in operating revenues. But he insisted that Amtrak
would ``more than close any kind of revenue loss'' with a series of
unspecified commercial projects.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to detail the plans, but said Amtrak would not sell
any of its assets.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Amtrak has generated cash through arrangements such
as selling its rights-of-way to fiber optic cable providers, a deal
under which fiber optics companies pay Amtrak to lay cables
alongside the tracks. Amtrak also has an exclusive concessions deal
with Pepsi-Cola, Remington said.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1996, Amtrak pulled in $90 million through such
agreements, he said.

GENE IMPLANTS PRODUCE SMARTER MICE, SCIENTISTS SAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RICHARD SALTUS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Scientists say they have genetically modified mice to make them
smarter, and the feat raises anew provocative questions of when or
if such genetic enhancement of normal abilities should ever be
attempted in humans.
</P>
<P>
   After using gene implants to create a strain of mice having
double the normal amount of a memory protein in their brains, the
researchers found that the animals learned significantly faster and
remembered longer than their normal counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the added gene prevented the normal decline in memory
and learning that occurs with advancing age in both mouse and man.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, being reported in a journal Thursday, is certain to
attract wide interest and stimulate debates over how society should
use the growing power of genetics.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first evidence for manipulation of genes producing
improvement in a higher function'' in animals, said Dr. Larry
Squire, a leading memory researcher, at the University of
California in San Diego.
</P>
<P>
   The gene-altered mice outshined unmodified rodents in a series
of tasks that measured how fast they could learn something (like
the location of a submerged platform in a pool of water) and how
long they could retain information they had learned.
</P>
<P>
   However, specialists pointed out, creating improved memory and
learning ability is not the same as boosting intelligence, the
complex and hard-to-define ability measured by IQ tests.
</P>
<P>
   Daniel Schacter, chair of psychology at Harvard, said the paper
does not assert that the mice had superior reasoning or analytical
skills _ elements of what would be called intelligence in humans.
Nevertheless, Schacter said the report ``raises a host of thorny
issues.''
</P>
<P>
   If the research led to a safe and reliable memory drug that
helped people with dementia or other memory disorders, said
Schacter, ``there would be the question of who should be using this
among the normal population, and are you penalized if you don't use
these drugs? _ these are questions we've never had to face
before.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides drugs, this line of research could theoretically lead to
genetic modification of human embryos to include a human version of
the gene that created the ``smart'' mice.
</P>
<P>
   George Annas, professor of health law at Boston University
School of Public Health, said the mouse experiment ``doesn't mean
we'll ever be able to enhance human intelligence,'' but if that
were to happen, he said, ``people would pay any price for it, and
that would raise the question of whether the government should
subsidize it for everyone.''
</P>
<P>
   The report in the current Nature came from the laboratory of Joe
Z. Tsien at Princeton University and collaborators at the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Washington University.
Ya-Ping Tang of Princeton is lead author.
</P>
<P>
   The researchers came up with the name Doogie for the strain of
brainy mice, a nod to the TV series ``Doogie Howser, M.D.'' about
an exceptionally precocious boy who is only 10 when he graduates
from college _ Princeton, in fact.
</P>
<P>
   The discovery might be applicable to humans because the
mechanism that the scientists tinkered with in the mice is
fundamentally the same one that creates memory in animals as lowly
as the sea slug, and all the way up to humans. Memories _
representations of thoughts _ are stored in networks of brain cells
in many places in the brain, but indexed in a structure called the
hippocampus.
</P>
<P>
   Information is transmitted through the brain as electrical
impulses that flow through one brain cell, or neuron, and hurdle
the gap, or synapse, between one neuron and the next. Chemical
messengers carry the impulse across the synapse. When the same
information (a sight, a sound, a thought) repeatedly crosses the
same synapse, chemical changes make the synapse easier for the
message to cross. When this happens, the information becomes more
strongly etched into the neuron pathways as a memory that can later
be retrieved.
</P>
<P>
   Controlling the flow of impulses across the synapse is a protein
called the NMDA receptor, which acts as a switch for memory
formation. When it is stimulated by two adjacent nerve cells _
which would happen if two pieces of information were coming
together in an association to be remembered _ the NMDA receptor
opens for a fraction of a second, allowing the impulses to jump the
synapse easily and create a stored memory.
</P>
<P>
   When humans (or mice) are young, the NMDA gateway stays open
slightly longer, providing more time for the mental association to
be made and remembered. As people age, that time window narrows,
and people store information less easily.
</P>
<P>
   The Tsien group at Princeton created the smarter mice by adding
extra copies of a gene called NR2B (which makes a protein for the
NMDA receptor) to normal mouse embryos. The resulting newborn mice
had about twice as much NR2B activity as normal mice, and this
extra dose meant their brains were more open to new information in
a shorter time.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, the genetically modified animals were able to
remember associations, like whether an object in their cage was new
or had been there previously, for several more days than the normal
mice.
</P>
<P>
   Tim Bliss, a brain scientist at the National Institute for
Medical Research in London, said in an interview that further
research was needed to find out if the animal pays a cost of any
kind in having this ability enhanced.
</P>
<P>
   Because of that concern and because so many questions remain
unanswered, said Bliss, ``I think we're miles and miles away'' from
trying similar experiments in humans.

IN WAKE OF CORRUPTION CASE, U.S. FOCUSES ON AID TO RUSSIA 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The Clinton administration said on Wednesday it
wants assurances that international financial aid already sent to
Russia has not been lost to corruption, but stopped short of
calling for a halt in future loans to Moscow from the International
Monetary Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Seeking to defend the administration's policy of supporting aid
to Russia _ and to defuse an issue that could have political
ramifications for Vice President Al Gore _ Treasury Department
officials and John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, said
the administration wanted to be certain that no money loaned to
Russia by the IMF had been moved surreptitiously out of the
country. They were responding to reports of alleged money
laundering in which billions of dollars were sent by Russians
through the Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to make sure that the IMF money is going to
reform-oriented projects,'' Podesta said Wednesday in an appearance
at the National Press Club. ``The IMF, in its latest lending, has
instituted additional safeguards, but we want an accounting of the
ways the IMF money has been spent.''
</P>
<P>
   Previous investigations of monetary fund loans to Russia have
found no evidence that the money had been misused, and Justice
Department officials have told their counterparts at the Treasury
Department that they have no evidence that the money laundering
investigation involves the proceeds of IMF loans. Officials at the
IMF on Wednesday repeated that they have no evidence of any misuse
of loans to Russia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's wait and see what the facts are,'' Podesta said.
</P>
<P>
   But it is unclear how much new evidence the administration hopes
to assemble. Officials at the monetary fund said they have not
undertaken new studies of how Russia has used past loan proceeds
since news of the money laundering investigation broke on Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the monetary fund has had some serious problems with
Russia, including questions about whether the Russian central bank
used transactions with an offshore affiliate known as Fimaco to
deceive the IMF about the country's financial condition. The fund
is now waiting for a follow-up report on the Fimaco case from the
accounting firm of PriceWaterhouseCoopers on a separate matter that
looks at the Central Bank and its affiliates in Britain, France and
Germany.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the IMF is conducting a routine review of its
current lending agreement, which was signed last July.
</P>
<P>
   Russia is eligible for $4.5 billion in loans from the fund over
the next year and a half, of which $640 million was disbursed as a
first installment in July. The next installment, probably of
roughly the same size, is scheduled to be released in the next
several months. Like the first installment, the next one is
intended to help repay previous loans, and will simply be
transferred from one IMF account to another without entering the
Russian banking system. Russia already owes the fund about $16
billion.
</P>
<P>
   Treasury Secretary Lawrence H. Summers said in an interview
published Wednesday by USA Today that the ``United States will not
support disbursement'' of the next loan installment to Russia from
the monetary fund ``without adequate safeguards to assure that any
funds disbursed are used properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Treasury officials said Summers was not implying _ as the
headline on the USA Today story suggested _ that the United States
was ready to block the next loan installment.
</P>
<P>
   It would be ``premature to make any judgments as to whether
Russia will meet the conditions'' for the loan, said Michelle
Smith, a spokeswoman for the Treasury Department.
</P>
<P>
   The statements suggested that the administration wanted to
express concern about the possibility that the international aid
had been misappropriated without changing its policy toward Moscow
as Russia struggles to continue its rocky transformation toward
democratic capitalism.
</P>
<P>
   Federal investigators are looking into the movement of at least
$4.2 billion from Russia through the Bank of New York over the past
18 months. However, some investigators estimate that as much as $10
billion may have flowed through the bank.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have said the money might have come from some
combination of organized crime, corporate embezzlement and
political graft. Given the sums of money involved, there has been
speculation that some of the money might have come directly or
indirectly from international aid packages, of which the loans from
the IMF are the largest component.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lack of hard evidence, Republicans in Congress have
used the case to raise questions about the administration's policy
of granting aid to Russia, and to renew their attacks on the
monetary fund as inefficient and perhaps unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   Rivals in the presidential race have also used the case to
attack Gore, who long prided himself on his role in helping to
manage the administration's Russia policy.
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Russian officials denounced reports that they might
have misused the international aid. Foreign Minister Igor Ivanov
said the reports came from people ``who do not want our country to
take on its role in the world as a great power.''
</P>
<P>
   Alexander Livshits, Russia's ambassador to the Group of Eight
industrial nations, said the previous studies by the monetary fund
and PriceWaterhouseCoopers showed no misuse of money and that he
did ``not understand this game.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the problem in resolving the questions lies with the way
the monetary fund operates. Until now, money loaned by the IMF to
Russia has typically gone into the Russian Central Bank. Although
agreements between the monetary fund and its borrowers include
economic benchmarks that the country must meet to qualify for
further aid, they do not specify precisely how the money is to be
used.
</P>
<P>
   In practice, the money becomes intermingled with the borrowing
country's other foreign currency reserves, making it all but
impossible to trace where any particular dollar or euro or ruble
might go.
</P>
<P>
   ``By and large it goes to the central banks, and it's their
money to use appropriately,'' said William Murray, a spokesman for
the monetary fund. ``We do not earmark _ we don't say, `Of this $1
billion, $600 million has to go to pension subsidies.' We don't
track individual transactions.''

 &HT;    Georgia senator slams FALN releases
 &HT;    By Don Melvin and Ken Foskett
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Criticizing President Clinton's decision to grant
amnesty to 16 Puerto Rican nationalists, Sen. Paul Coverdell
(R-Ga.) said Wednesday that he will hold hearings on the
administration's policy toward terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations terrorism
subcommittee, has expressed outrage over Clinton's decision to
commute the sentences of 16 Puerto Rican nationalists jailed for
their involvement with FALN, the Armed Forces of National
Liberation, a militant group calling for Puerto Rican independence.
</P>
<P>
   Coverdell said the group was responsible for 100 bombings, six
deaths and 130 injuries. None of those whose sentence Clinton
proposed for commutation, however, was convicted of killing or
injuring anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is this administration setting a new standard that only
successful terrorists should be punished?'' Coverdell wrote in a
letter to Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The hearings are scheduled for Sept. 15.

   CARE aid in East Timor reminder of challenges there
</P>
<P>
   While a referendum on independence this week sparked optimism in
East Timor, Atlanta-based CARE USA supplied a reminder of some of
the challenges that still face the Asian island.
</P>
<P>
   CARE is distributing food to about half the 53,000 people
displaced by recent conflict between forces in favor of
independence and those supporting continued ties to Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
   ``Families that have been displaced by the conflict are almost
entirely dependent on host villages for food, water and shelter,
but these villages are still recovering themselves from a severe
drought, a national economic downturn and then the unrest in the
province,'' said Isam Ghanim, CARE USA's regional director for Asia
and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The western half of Timor, formerly called Netherlands Timor,
became part of Indonesia in 1949. The eastern half remained a
province of Portugal until 1975, when it was occupied by Indonesia
_ an annexation never recognized by the United Nations.
</P>
<P>
   Residents of East Timor voted this week on whether to become
independent, but the results may not be announced until Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Monsoon flooding strikes early in India
</P>
<P>
   CARE USA is trying to ease a crisis in India, where monsoons
have hit early and hard, causing flooding that has affected 5
million people through displacement or disease, said Bob LaPrade,
CARE USA's deputy director for Asia and Europe.
</P>
<P>
   CARE is feeding about 80,000 families _ about 1 million people _
in Bihar, India's poorest state.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have large tracts of land that are little seas with tiny
little islands,'' said LaPrade, who recently returned to Atlanta
after inspecting the area.
</P>
<P>
   While the flooding this year is severe, LaPrade noted that there
was severe flooding last year in nearby Bangladesh. Deforestation
has exacerbated the problem, and the expanding population has
forced people to live in flood-prone areas.
</P>
<P>
   ``The human suffering is increasing, actually, each year,'' he
said. ``The International community needs to start looking at this
as a larger problem, a regional problem.'' Early warning systems
and perhaps a system of dams may be needed, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Lawmaker returns from Congo visit
</P>
<P>
   U.S. Rep. Cynthia McKinney has returned from a mission to the
Democratic Republic of Congo during which she visited local
hospitals and met with President Laurent Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   McKinney joined efforts by Atlanta Hawks player Dikembe Mutombo
to improve health care. The basketball player has created the
Dikembe Mutombo Foundation, which is building a hospital in the
capital, Kinshasa. During her visit, McKinney saw children being
vaccinated against polio.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Democratic Republic of Congo has 10 million children who
need to be vaccinated against this disease,'' she said. ``Our goal
is to replace fatal gunshots with life-saving polio shots. I think
we are accomplishing that goal, but so much more needs to be
done.''
</P>
<P>
   N. Ireland official honored
</P>
<P>
   Marjorie ``Mo'' Mowlam, the British secretary of state for
Northern Ireland, is being honored in Atlanta this week. The
American Political Science Association gave her its Hubert H.
Humphrey award for her career in public service.
</P>
<P>
   Mowlam, educated in the United States, was appointed in 1997 and
played a key role in securing the Good Friday Agreement that is
supposed to end the conflict in Northern Ireland. In 1998, she
walked into the Maze prison in Belfast to negotiate with convicted
killers and other criminals. The agreement, however, has been in
danger recently of collapse.

TRUANTS TO GET QUICK TRIP TO `Y' COUNSELORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BETH DALEY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Tracking down truant public school students was the
easy part for police last year. But with no place to bring them,
officers could do little more than jot down names, scold the
students _ and let them go.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in October, youngsters between the ages of 12 and 15
had better beware: Police will haul those playing hooky to one of
nine truancy centers being created in YMCAs throughout the city.
Teachers and parents will be called. Schoolwork will be done. And
if students don't shape up, they could be assigned a probation
officer.
</P>
<P>
   ``That might make me not skip school,'' admitted Josh Currivan,
14. He will be a freshman at West Roxbury High School when classes
begin next week.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one has ever stopped me when I played hooky last year, and
I never got in trouble for it,'' Currivan said. ``If they pulled
you over and arrested you, that might work. But a lot of kids just
do what they want.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's announcement of the truancy centers follows two
years of successful efforts to slow rampant truancy in the city's
public schools.
</P>
<P>
   Overall daily attendance rose 1.3 percent to 91.8 percent in the
past year. And the number of chronically absent students _ those
with more than 15 absences _ declined 12 percent in the last two
years, school officials said. Two years ago, more than 25 percent
of schoolchildren missed three or more weeks of classes.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while daily attendance at high schools increased nearly
two percentage points last year, chronic truancy by older students
remains troublesome and among the worst in the country. Boston high
school students miss 28 days a year, four days more than the
average of the country's 10 largest cities, according to a 1997
report for the Boston schools by Bain &AMP; Company, a consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   The number may be even greater, as students report a regular
practice of showing up for homeroom _ often fourth period in high
school _ and then leaving. Because attendance is based on being
present in homeroom, some students know they can be counted and
then disappear.
</P>
<P>
   The new truancy centers probably won't help those high school
students, since those over 15 have the right to drop out and police
cannot force them to attend school.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have a long way to go with high schools,'' said city
Superintendent Thomas Payzant.
</P>
<P>
   While many students play hooky simply because they don't want to
go to school, others stay home to work or care for siblings. Still
other students have said they are afraid of violence in schools or
of being hurt while walking to school. The end result is students
who fall too far behind in coursework and fail or drop out.
</P>
<P>
   Last year police wrote up some 1,000 students they found
lingering around the city during weekly truancy sweeps. But the
students soon learned they would not be returned to schools because
they lacked the resources to handle them.
</P>
<P>
   The new approach, made possible in part with a $300,000 grant
from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, will have police pick up
students and take them to the nearest YMCA. There, YMCA officials
will meet with students and decide whether they need a stern
warning or more complex services.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The White House chief of staff on Wednesday urged
the Republican majority in Congress to send President Clinton its
$792 billion tax cut bill so that he could promptly veto it.
</P>
<P>
   Congress passed the tax measure early last month but lawmakers
have refrained from forwarding it to the White House, where it
faces certain rejection. Republicans have been stumping across the
country for their tax plan during the current congressional recess,
hoping to generate public support. Clinton and his aides have taken
every opportunity to criticize the proposal as an unwarranted
windfall for the rich and a threat to the booming American economy.
</P>
<P>
   John D. Podesta, the White House chief of staff, pleaded with
the GOP leadership Thursday morning to release the bill ``so we
don't have to keep fooling around with the phony debate.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We intend to veto it,'' Podesta said in an appearance at the
National Press Club. ``So send it down to us so that we can veto it
and then move forward, putting first things first and seeing
whether we can find some bipartisan agreement on these other major
budget questions.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and members of Congress have been out of Washington for
the past two weeks and there has been no movement on this year's
tax-and-spending debate beyond the occasional rhetorical salvo like
the one fired Thursday morning by Podesta. Congressional officials
said Thursday that the leadership intends to send the tax-cut bill
to the White House by the middle of this month.
</P>
<P>
   The White House is clearly spoiling for the fight over taxes and
spending to resume. Polling and political experience have persuaded
the president and his advisers that they hold the high ground of
public opinion in the looming struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has argued that projected federal budget surpluses
should not be given away in the form of tax cuts but rather
``invested'' in education, technology, the environment and an
expansion of Medicare benefits to include prescription-drug
coverage for the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The ordinarily camera-shy Podesta took advantage of a relatively
news-free week in Washington to venture out of his West Wing office
to attend a crowded news conference at the Press Club. In his
prepared remarks, he complained about Republican plans to pay for
their tax cut in part through what he called ``devastating''
reductions in the administration's proposed federal spending for
research and technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a 19th century budget for a 21st century economy,''
Podesta said of the Republican spending plan. ``One has to wonder
whether the people designing these budgets spent too much time
watching Fred Flintstone and not enough time watching the
Jetsons.''
</P>
<P>
   Podesta said that Congress had cut the administration's request
for civilian research and development spending by $1.8 billion from
roughly $38 billion and had cut $1 billion from the
administration's proposed $13.6 billion for the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Republicans also blocked a
proposed $200 million increase in funding for the National Science
Foundation, Podesta complained.
</P>
<P>
   He said that, until now, American science and technology have
traditionally enjoyed strong bipartisan support in Washington.
Congress has long lavished substantial funding on the American
space program, medical research, fundamental science and advanced
military technology, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this year, the Republican-led Congress _ to make room for
their risky tax plan _ is playing politics with science and
technology funding,'' Podesta said. ``They have proposed deep cuts
in many important research programs. And in so doing, they are
threatening the potential progress of innovation in America.''
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Morra, spokeswoman for the House Appropriations
Committee, said that the White House was indulging in the luxury of
sniping from the sidelines while congressional appropriators tried
to devise a budget beneath stringent spending limits decreed in the
1997 balanced budget agreement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every week another Cabinet officer or White House official
complains about some part of the budget we've underfunded,'' Ms.
Morra said. ``We've done the best we can to prioritize spending
under very tight caps.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the administration's budget submission in January
included $42 billion in tax increases and user-fee increases that
Congress rejected, money that is not available for new spending on
research, technology or anything else. In addition, the
administration is preparing to submit emergency supplemental
spending requests for Kosovo, the Middle East and disaster relief
for Turkey without specifying how they should be paid for, Ms.
Morra noted.
</P>
<P>
   She said that many of the research accounts that were cut were
contained in the appropriations bill for the departments of
Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development that also
includes money for Nasa, the National Science Foundation and the
Environmental Protection Agency.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Morra said that a majority of the committee decided to
increase spending on veterans' health programs substantially,
requiring offsetting reductions in research programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's about prioritizing,'' she said.

CHRISTINA AGUILERA CD IS WORTH YOUR ALLOWANCE
</HEADLINE>
 AGUILERA-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DAVE FERMAN 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Oh, no, I thought, not another one.
</P>
<P>
   This was a couple of weeks ago, as Christina Aguilera's ``Genie
in a Bottle'' began to pretty well take over the airwaves.
</P>
<P>
   Cute song, good chorus, but man _ how many young pop singers are
we going to throw against the wall to see who sticks? And then
Aguilera came to Six Flags in Arlington to play that End of Summer
Bash and was, according to our reviewer Malcolm Mayhew,
overshadowed by Run-D.M.C.
</P>
<P>
   If we're to believe my buddy Malcolm, Aguilera _ an 18-year-old
from Pittsburgh first heard on the soundtrack to ``Mulan'' _ cannot
sing live. Or dance very well. And I always believe Malcolm, as
should you.
</P>
<P>
   So I wasn't looking to be that impressed by her self-named
12-track CD. At all. Another anonymous bit of disposable candy-pop
by yet another cute kid.
</P>
<P>
   But Christina Aguilera is a pleasant, if modest, surprise.
Although nobody will ever confuse the material here with truly
great pop music, and it's repetitive on more than a few occasions,
and it does include two songs from the queen of schmaltz, Diane
Warren, it's far from all bad.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, the (relative) maturity of Aguilera's voice
puts her at least one cut above her closest rival, the omnipresent
Britney Spears. There are no rap interludes and very little Latin
influence; those looking for a hip-hop/pop/Latin CD reminiscent of
Jennifer Lopez's can look elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   What the CD offers is pure pop _ danceable stuff, torch ballads,
medium-tempo cuts, and it shows that if given a little time to
mature, Aguilera might (just might) be capable of some good, adult
pop music somewhere down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``Reflection'' from the ``Mulan'' soundtrack is here, but the
best songs are ``Come on Over (All I Want Is You)'' and ``Love Will
Find a Way,'' both uptempo numbers with a bit of R&AMP;B slinkiness.
The arrangements are nice and simple, the hooks memorable.
</P>
<P>
   Aguilera's voice shows some nice maturity on these tracks, as it
does on ``Reflection.'' She may never be more than a one-hit
wonder, but right now Aguilera is OK. Whether she will develop into
something more than a flash in the pan who does a couple of songs
to prerecorded tracks at a pop radio station-sponsored show is
anyone's guess. I wouldn't bet on it, but I wouldn't be totally
surprised, either.

FASTER NEW YORK-TO-BOSTON TRAINS SEEN 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SUSAN MILLIGAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Trying to take a sting out of the delay in the
Northeast Corridor high-speed rail line, Amtrak officials promised
Wednesday that travelers will have a somewhat speedier ride between
Boston and New York City in January, when the line is fully
electrified.
</P>
<P>
   The electrified service, which now run only between New York and
New Haven, will be completed soon after the New Year and will shave
48 minutes to an hour and 40 minutes off the Boston-New York trip,
Amtrak President George Warrington told reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The high-speed line, which will shorten the Boston-New York trip
to about 3 hours, and the New York-Washington route to about 2
hours, will be delayed until spring because of mechanical troubles
with the new trains, Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   The wheels are scraping against the tracks, presenting a
maintenance headache, but not a safety problem, said Jacques
Lapare, president of the Montreal-based Bombardier Transportation,
North America, one of the two companies building equipment for the
high-speed line.
</P>
<P>
   While travelers are being mollified, the consortium building the
high-speed trains is being punished. For every day Bombardier and
the France-based ALSTOM are late, they will have to pay a fine of
up to $270,000, Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   The delay is embarrassing to Amtrak, which has been touting the
fast, luxurious new line. But waiting is preferable to rushing
ahead with a substandard system, Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is about taking the time necessary to make the trains
right,'' Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   While testing the French-modeled trains in Pueblo, Colo.,
manufacturers found that too much pressure was being put on the
wheels when the trains sped around the curves of the American
tracks.
</P>
<P>
   Mechanics have to fiddle with the suspension systems to create
more ``give'' for the wheels, so they do not scape the tracks,
Lapare said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The delay is unfortunate, but not unusual when new technology
is being introduced into a new environment,'' Lapare said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim RePass, president of the National Corridors Initiative that
has been pushing hard for a high-speed line for a decade, lauded
Warrington for making ``a good management decision, instead of a
political decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``Better to delay the system and have it work right, rather than
meet a deadline that's media-driven,'' said RePass, who was a
management consultant before heading the advocacy group.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Amtrak nor Bombardier officials would say which of the
two firms in the consortium would have to pay the fines, although
ALSTOM is responsible for the train construction, said Amtrak
spokesman Rick Remington.
</P>
<P>
   The decision of how to apportion the penalty burden is something
that ``will be worked out within the consortium,'' said Lapare of
Bombardier.
</P>
<P>
   The fine, which will range from $1,000 to $13,500 per day for
each of the 20 train sets ordered, will not be determined until the
fixed trains are delivered and the financial damage is assessed,
Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   The other elements of Amtrak's $2.6 billion project are on track
and will be delivered as scheduled, Warrington said. Improvements
to the lines, including repairs of bridges and replacement of
wooden ties with concrete ties, will be done this year, Remington
said.
</P>
<P>
   Once electrification of the remaining segment of the New
York-Boston line is finished by early January, Amtrak will run four
round-trip trains per day, Warrington said.
</P>
<P>
   On slower trains that make four stops and now chug for well over
five hours between New York and Boston, the time would be shortened
to about three hours and 50 minutes. When the high-speed train is
introduced later in the spring, the time will be cut to three
hours, Remington said.
</P>
<P>
   The new trains have been operating at 165 miles per hour in
testing but will operate at only 150 miles per hour once put to
use, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Warrington said he could not estimate how much the delay would
cost Amtrak in operating revenues. But he insisted that Amtrak
would ``more than close any kind of revenue loss'' with a series of
unspecified commercial projects.
</P>
<P>
   He refused to detail the plans, but said Amtrak would not sell
any of its assets.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Amtrak has generated cash through arrangements such
as selling its rights-of-way to fiber optic cable providers, a deal
under which fiber optics companies pay Amtrak to lay cables
alongside the tracks. Amtrak also has an exclusive concessions deal
with Pepsi-Cola, Remington said.
</P>
<P>
   In fiscal 1996, Amtrak pulled in $90 million through such
agreements, he said.

`NONCOMPETE AGREEMENTS' AREN'T FAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DIANE STAFFORD  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ If professional football were like many
businesses, Neil Smith and Dale Carter would have signed noncompete
agreements with the Kansas City Chiefs and been forced to sit out a
season before playing with the Denver Broncos.
</P>
<P>
   They also might have had to excuse themselves when the Broncos
studied Chiefs' films because they knew Chiefs' secrets.
</P>
<P>
   They didn't, of course. They took their talents and knowledge to
the Broncos and used them from day one. (No jokes, please, from
Smith or Carter detractors.)
</P>
<P>
   Contrast their full-speed-ahead job changes with recent movement
in another industry _ moves that led to a breach of contract
lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   One Kansas City area advertising agency, Barkley Evergreen &AMP;
Partners, is suing another, Sullivan Higdon &AMP; Sink, for inducing
three employees to violate their noncompete agreements with Barkley
Evergreen. In other words, Sullivan Higdon this summer hired three
men who previously worked together at Barkley Evergreen.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the outcome of this agency vs. agency lawsuit,
Barkley Evergreen still could go after the individuals for
noncompete contract violations. It's a kind of legal action that's
repeated daily in courtrooms nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   Call me mystified.
</P>
<P>
   Confidentiality agreements I understand. It really wouldn't be
nice for the guy who knows Campbell's recipe for tomato soup to
hand it over to rival Heinz. Granted, nice is sometimes different
from business reality, but I see fairness and logic in trying to
prevent blatant trade-secret leaks.
</P>
<P>
   But noncompete agreements? Workers have jumped ship for better
offers as long as there has been more than one candle maker in
town. The soup guy doesn't make the move as a blank slate.
</P>
<P>
   If you're good at what you do, if a competitor makes you a
better offer, if a client wants to follow you to the new place _
well, isn't that what business competition is all about?
</P>
<P>
   Inducing a fellow worker to change jobs or inducing a client to
change companies is not an easy thing. There's no lasso or
bullwhip. There's free choice. There can be counteroffers. The free
market says the best person or best product wins.
</P>
<P>
   A typical noncompete agreement _ once limited to top management
but now sought from other workers _ prohibits an employee from
competing with an employer for a year after leaving that
employment. Typically, the agreements say a worker won't call on
the employer's customers. Some agreements also say a worker won't
raid the employer's talent.
</P>
<P>
   These contracts are hard to enforce. Violation allegations
usually come through the grapevine. Verification is difficult. It
comes down to arguments of coincidence vs. inducement.
</P>
<P>
   There may be valid reasons for noncompete pacts to exist, but
I'd bet some companies are rethinking the time and expense involved
in trying to enforce them. They may see it's more efficient to
focus on attracting and keeping the best talent than chasing after
the ones that left.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, an industry leader doesn't have to panic if an
also-ran competitor hires someone away. Copiers are just that.
Copiers. Remember who had the benefits of the employee's work
first.

UPSTATERS CURIOUS, NOT IMPRESSED, BY HARD-TRAVELING HILLARY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   SKANEATELES, N.Y. _ Edward G. Mogren, a retired manufacturing
manager, got up from his front porch to see what ``all the
commotion'' was down the street. It was Chelsea Clinton heading
into the town library.
</P>
<P>
   Like so many other residents of this scenic lakeside village,
the 78-year-old Mogren wasn't passing up the chance to see Chelsea,
President Clinton or first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   While Mogren said Mrs. Clinton's decision to vacation here is
politically ``so obvious,'' he did give her some credit over her
likely Republican opponent, New York City Mayor Rudolph Giuliani.
``She has crisscrossed the state, and I don't think Giuliani can
say that.''
</P>
<P>
   But Mogren doesn't like the Clintons' politics and won't vote
for Mrs. Clinton if she runs for the US Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's wrong of her to think that she can become a
representative for the state of New York when her entire knowledge
of it has been acquired in a few months,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the first family arrival on Monday for a five-day vacation
_ after a nine-day stay on Martha's Vineyard and a weekend in the
Hamptons _ even their political enemies have rolled out the welcome
mat.
</P>
<P>
   The village mayor, Don Price, a Republican, Wednesday presented
the president and Mrs. Clinton with a painting of the lake and a
box of postcards.
</P>
<P>
   Though Republicans outnumber Democrats better than 2-to-1 in
this town of 2,700 people (with 4,800 more in surrounding areas),
residents have lined up outside restaurants and shops the Clintons
haven't even visited, hoping they will.
</P>
<P>
   But, whether that enthusiasm will translate into actual votes
for Mrs. Clinton is less clear. With polls showing her either
locked in a statistical deadheat or slightly trailing Giuliani,
political analysts say her chances of winning the seat held by
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan, the Democrat who is retiring,
could hinge on a strong showing in upstate New York.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, the spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's Senate
exploratory committee, tried to knock down any political connection
to the trip. ``She's not looking at this visit in a political
context,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton Wednesday she was having such a ``great time'' in
the Finger Lakes region that she had called her mother the night
before. ``It reminds me so much of where I spent my childhood,
because I spent every summer at the little lake in northeast
Pennsylvania,'' she said. ``The nights were cool, and the mornings
were cool, and it warmed up. It's my favorite kind of weather. It's
so nostalgic.''
</P>
<P>
   With Mrs. Clinton running strong among voters in New York City
and Giuliani more favorable to those in the surrounding suburbs,
the first lady must capture about 40 percent of the vote upstate,
said John Zogby, a pollster for the Utica-based Zogby
International.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton and her family on Monday visited the State Fair in
nearby Syracuse, a rite of passage for New York politicians. After
spending Tuesday out of public view, she and the president stopped
at a coffee shop Wednesday and toured several museums that were on
Mrs. Clinton's Saving America's Treasures tour last year. Wednesday
night, they had dinner with Mark Gearan, a Massachusetts native,
former head of the Peace Corps, and now president of Hobart and
William Smith Colleges in Geneva, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   Thursday night, they are scheduled to attend a $250-per-person
fund-raiser for Mrs. Clinton's exploratory committee and later a
$1,000-per-person reception at Mulrooney's Restaurant in Syracuse,
all part of the $600,000 she hopes to have raised for her campaign
before returning to Washington Friday.
</P>
<P>
   Lee Miringoff, director of the Marist Institute for Public
Opinion in Poughkeepsie, which has been polling voters on her
Senate campaign, said Mrs. Clinton needs to settle on finding a
house to wear down her carpetbagger image.
</P>
<P>
   ``By flying in and out, she simply underscores the fact that
she's not from New York, and establishing residency, in a symbolic
way, says she is,'' Miringoff said. But once Mrs. Clinton does put
down roots in New York, he said, ``the first question people are
going to ask is, `Is this Splitsville?' ''
</P>
<P>
   That's why, Miringoff said, ``we've seen this very visible
effort on the part of the Clintons to show this is merely her
moving to New York to establish herself.''
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Zimmerman, a political science professor at the State
Univeristy of New York in Albany, said, ``It is very important for
her to have the president's support, and to show she is a good,
devoted wife and now she's got a devoted husband.''
</P>
<P>
   But on the streets of Skaneateles, being the first family cuts
both ways.
</P>
<P>
   John Angyal, owner of Johnny Angel's Heavenly Hamburgers,
renamed a $3.50 grilled baloney and cheese sandwich ``the Hillary
special _ mostly baloney.''
</P>
<P>
   But Angyal, a Republican who says he ``would never vote'' for
Mrs. Clinton, is nonetheless miffed at Doug Clark, owner of Doug's
Fish Fry just three doors down. Clark had told a reporter he would
refuse to serve the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``He lied to the American people,'' Clark said Wednesday. ``He
pointed his finger and said he did not have sex with that woman.
He's a disgrace to the country.''
</P>
<P>
   But Angyal shot back, ``They are still the president and first
lady . . . They've been elected twice. Somebody likes them,
apparently many people do, which is what I've seen over the last
couple of days.''

 &HT;    Georgia dips into reserves to buy land along Chattahoochee River
 &HT;    By Kathey Pruitt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Gov. Roy Barnes said Wednesday he expects to tap into
state reserve funds to buy environmentally sensitive land along the
Chattahoochee River as part of his effort to preserve one-fifth of
the state's undeveloped areas for green space.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes wouldn't say how much money he will ask the state to ante
up for the project, but said he's likely to ``pay for it with
cash'' next year out of Georgia's reserve funds or from a $582
million surplus from the fiscal year that ended in June.
</P>
<P>
   The money would help start a second phase of an aggressive
land-buy for a 180-mile park along the river, stretching from Helen
to Columbus.
</P>
<P>
   ``This should be the major green space,'' Barnes said of the
river corridor spanning the top half of the state. ``This is good
business sense. It's not a bunch of tree-huggers ... saying we
shouldn't have any growth whatsoever.''
</P>
<P>
   Georgia also is planning two state parks along the river between
Atlanta and Columbus to provide natural areas for ``underserved''
portions of the state, said Department of Natural Resources
Commissioner Lonice Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike others that focus on lodges and golf courses, the new
2,000-to-3,000-acre parks will be built around nature trails, bike
paths and interpretive centers, Barrett said. About $10 million has
been set aside for the undisclosed sites.
</P>
<P>
   As for the governor's riverfront proposal, ``There couldn't be
better timing,'' said Don Stahle, development director of the Trust
for Public Land's southeast regional office in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   River frontage along the Chattahoochee costs about $1 million a
mile, according to state figures. About 166 miles _ representing
land along both sides of the river _ are still targeted for
acquisition as part of the river protection plan Barnes launched
this year in conjunction with the Trust and a host of private
donors.
</P>
<P>
   That initiative has raised about $23 million in private
donations to match about $75 million from state and federal funds,
a private foundation grant and other sources to buy at least 75
miles of the river corridor, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
   While declining to talk about specific dollar amounts, Barnes
said he wants the state to be ``a major participant'' in the second
phase of the river protection effort, indicating a commitment
possibly larger than the $15 million Georgia allocated earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   Protecting the Chattahoochee corridor, Barnes said, is key to
his plan to push the state's fast-growing counties to allot 20
percent of their undeveloped land for a series of greenbelts.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes unveiled his 20 percent plan at a national governor's
conference last month. He said county officials would have to
include the green space goal in their land use plans or risk losing
state money for infrastructure _ everything from roads and bridges
to schools and water-sewer expansion. He proposed incentives _
including state money to help with the land purchases _ for local
governments to participate.
</P>
<P>
   Critics of the green space plan _ who grumble that it could be
an expensive infringement on private property rights _ cautioned
against dipping into reserves that hedge against economic
downturns. But they gave guarded approval to use state surplus
money for the river program.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's exactly what we should be doing,'' said state Senate
Minority Leader Eric Johnson (R-Savannah). ``Obviously, there's a
limit to how much we can spend, but it's a legitimate use of tax
dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   Using the surplus, Johnson said, is preferable to levying new
taxes. But local governments, not just the state and private
donors, should have a say in what properties are acquired, he said.

PALISTINIAN-ISRAELI TALKS STALL ON EVE OF ALBRIGHT'S ARRIVAL  
</HEADLINE>
  (js) 
 By DEBORAH SONTAG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ By very early Thursday morning, the optimism of
Israeli and Palistinian negotiators had soured, and it seemed
unlikely that a new agreement would be reached before Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright's arrival in Egypt later in the day.
</P>
<P>
   A signing ceremony that was to be held in Alexandria on Thursday
afternoon was put in doubt after Israelis and Palestinians played a
classic hand of Middle Eastern brinkmanship that ended in a
stand-off on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   It remained possible that negotiations over the peace
initiative, which were on-again, off-again all Wednesday, would
resume after sunrise Thursday morning. But after a tense day of
diplomatic double-dare, it seemed equally possible that the
Israelis and the Palestinians would not resolve their differences.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, it would be left to Albright _ perhaps alongside
Hosni Mubarak, the Egyptian president _ to help them finalize a new
plan for reviving the frozen peace process. State Department
officials have said that Albright would be reluctant to mediate the
fine-point details of the current dispute, preferring that the
parties work those out themselves.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat cut short a trip to the
Netherlands to fly to Alexandria late Wednesday before hopes had
been dashed that negotiations would begin again. A late-night
Israeli security Cabinet meeting ended without public comment, but
a spokesman for Prime Minister Ehud Barak said he was not
optimistic that there would be any celebrations _ or summits _ in
Egypt later Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Will the prime minister go to Alexandria?'' asked David Zisso,
a spokesman for Barak. ``Alexandria was meant to be the place for
the signing of an agreement, so right now it doesn't seem that
way.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   It was hard to measure whether Wednesday was a day of
last-minute panic or a genuine crisis. Each side, and particularly
the Palestinians, seemed to need to show its people that it was
prepared to sweat out every last detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``During the endgame and closing process of these agreements,
there is always room for a crisis,'' a top Israeli diplomat said
late Wednesday afternoon. ``We are in such a situation now.''
</P>
<P>
   After 15 rounds of negotiations between the Israelis and the
Palestinians last month, it all come down to one last sticking
point: 50 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   When the Israelis pushed away from the negotiating table on
Wednesday, that was what separated them from the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   Essentially, the Israelis had agreed to release 350 prisoners
while the Palestinians wanted 400. The Israelis, who have insisted
that they would not release any prisoner who had murdered an
Israeli, said they couldn't find 50 more who met their criteria for
release.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians, according to an Israeli negotiator, said:
``Invent them.''
</P>
<P>
   Both sides were using Albright's trip to the region as an
artificial deadline for completing a detailed plan for carrying out
the U.S.-brokered Wye River memorandum. The Wye agreement is a
land-for-security deal that was sealed in Wye, Md., last fall only
to be suspended by the previous Israeli government of former Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations last month represented the first peacemaking
efforts of Ehud Barak. The new prime minister has an ambitious plan
to forge a broad peace in the region. With the Palestinians, he
aims to complete a final status peace agreement by the end of next
year. Reviving the Wye agreement is, for the Palestinians, a
prerequisite first step to final status talks, which were to have
started Wednesday.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Since Barak is determined to make concrete achievements quickly
and Arafat wants a deal, it seemed unlikely that they would allow
the issue of 50 prisoners to sour their infant relationship.
Modifying the Wye agreement is baby play compared with tackling the
sensitive final status issues, like Jerusalem and the return of
refugees.
</P>
<P>
   But a top Israeli negotiator said Wednesday of the Palestinians,
``I've come to believe that for them the prisoners are almost more
important than the land.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly that is the issue that resonates with the Palestinian
public, especially the mothers whose sons are behind bars for
political or terrorist acts committed before the Palestine
Liberation Organization gave up its violent struggle against
Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Palestinian negotiators have not forgotten a sobering moment
that followed the completion of the Wye memorandum last fall. The
villa of Mahmoud Abbas _ the second in command of the Palestinian
Authority _ was pelted with stones because some Palestinians
believed that their leaders had failed them.
</P>
<P>
   The peace memorandum, while calling for Israel's release of 750
prisoners, did not specify that they should be what the
Palestinians call political prisoners. And indeed, as they feared
he would, Netanyahu took advantage of that vagueness by releasing
many common criminals before the agreement was suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts believe that the stoning incident made such a
strong impression on the Palestinian leadership that they now want
to make it as clear as possible to their people that they have held
their ground this time.
</P>
<P>
   But the Israelis, too, would suffer a backlash if they seemed
too lenient in their prisoner release policy. The issue is
particularly jarring to some Israelis when set against the backdrop
of a stabbing murder that took place last weekend. A young Orthodox
Jewish couple was killed in a nature reserve near Meggido, and
police suspected a nationalist motive, if not terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, the military arm of Hamas, an Islamic
fundamentalist group, claimed responsibility for the killings.
</P>
<P>
   A large front-page advertisement in the Haaretz newspaper on
Wednesday said, ``Death trap! The terrorists butcher a young
student couple and in return Ehud Barak releases terrorists.''
</P>
<P>
   After a long sleepless night of talks on Tuesday, Israeli and
Palestinians negotiators felt close enough to a deal to schedule
separate press briefings for Wednesday afternoon. Then the air of
crisis descended.
</P>
<P>
   After waiting hours for Saeb Erekat, the Palestinian negotiator,
to descend to the lobby of the King David Hotel, Israeli
journalists received a pager message from their prime minister's
office.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli government considered the negotiations over, the
message said.
</P>
<P>
   Starting on Thursday, the message continued, the Israelis would
begin carrying out the Wye agreement unilaterally, sticking very
literally to the text. Everything negotiated over the last month _
from specifics on prisoners to those on opening the seaport _ would
be thrown out, an official said later.
</P>
<P>
   Erekat fumbled through a short statement. ``I would urge my
colleagues in the Israeli government to refrain from any
insinuations and threats,'' he said. ``We will continue to try to
bridge the gaps.''
</P>
<P>
   Even as Gilad Sher, Israel's lead negotiator, was pulling away
from the table, the conversations were continuing behind closed
doors at the King David. When Sher left, Haim Ramon, a minister in
the prime minister's office, quietly took his place.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everything will be resolved,'' Ramon said as he left hours
later.
</P>
<P>
   By early Thursday morning, that seemed less clear. Negotiators
were supposed to return to the table after a late-night Israeli
security Cabinet meeting finished, but they later dropped those
plans as Israelis decided that there was nothing to talk about
until the Palestinians accepted their final compromise position.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Israeli and Palestinian negotiators have held 15 rounds
of fairly amicable and constructive talks since the beginning of
August. Both sides said the discussions had gone a long way toward
rebuilding trust that had frayed during the tense years of the
Netanyahu administration.
</P>
<P>
   In these talks, they hammered out a four-page draft document
muddily entitled: ``Memorandum on Implementation Timeline of
Outstanding Commitments of Agreements Signed, and the Resumption of
Permanent Status Negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   What it amounted to was a reiteration of and plan for carrying
out the Wye memorandum _ almost a year after it was signed amid
great ceremony at the White House.
</P>
<P>
   In this tense conflict, where every interim agreement is
celebrated as a break-through achievement, the agreement is often
not enough and has to be re-negotiated to hold up.
</P>
<P>
   The re-negotiation process is often confusing, even to the
participants.
</P>
<P>
   Arafat, watching Arab television in Saudi Arabia, reportedly
balked when Erekat announced last month that he had achieved an
agreement with Israel for the opening of a seaport in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
   He reportedly shook his head, asking aides what kind of an
achievement that could be when the seaport had already been
guaranteed by Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
   In the new memorandum for carrying out the Wye memorandum, the
Israelis and the Palestinians set a timetable for Israeli
withdrawals from the West Bank _ the first pullback would take
place immediately as would the first release of prisoners. They
also defined the steps toward opening safe passage routes between
Gaza and the West Bank.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the prisoners, they squabbled Wednesday over the
wording of the text. The Israelis wanted to say that a framework
for a final peace agreement would be accomplished within six months
of the memorandum's signing.
</P>
<P>
   The Palestinians wanted to include a specific date.
</P>
<P>
   That reminded some experts here of a wording crisis that almost
derailed the Hebron agreement in the mid 1990s. The Israelis wanted
the document to call for an Israeli pullback in April of 1998,
while the Israelis insisted it should be in the fall. The
negotiations were at a breaking point when the late King Hussein of
Jordan offered a compromise: ``mid-year.''
</P>
<P>
   The pullback still hasn't happened.

LEWINSKY'S FATHER RECEIVES DONATION REQUEST FROM CLINTON
COMMITTEE 
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A form letter seeking contributions was sent by
President Clinton's legal defense fund to the father of Monica
Lewinsky, whose affair with the president led to his impeachment.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lewinsky's father, Dr. Bernard Lewinsky, a Los Angeles
oncologist, was not happy to get the request. ``Return to sender,''
he wrote on the envelope. ``You must be morons to send me this
letter!''
</P>
<P>
   An image of the front of the envelope was published in The Los
Angeles Times on Wednesday along with a brief account of the
episode. The report did not say when Lewinsky received the letter,
and he could not be reached for comment.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Lucas, a Washington lawyer with the firm of Arnold &AMP;
Porter who serves as outside counsel to the fund, said Lewinsky's
name might have appeared on a list of prospective donors that was
obtained by the fund's direct-mail consultant. ``We certainly are
sensitive to Dr. Lewinsky's reaction,'' Lucas said. ``It was
inadvertent.''
</P>
<P>
   According to figures recently released by the fund, $5.3 million
of the $10.5 million in legal bills accumulated by Clinton and his
wife, Hillary, have been paid.  &QL;

YEARS OF EFFORT BY TWO MEN SPURRED RE-EXAMINATION OF WACO 
</HEADLINE>
  (With WACO-INQUIRY) 
(th) 
 By JIM YARDLEY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ Michael McNulty and David Hardy refused to let go. In
the six years since the Branch Davidian compound went up in flames
on April 19, 1993, the two men have waged an obsessive quest to
discredit the official account of what happened.
</P>
<P>
   Espousing views popular with many right-wing groups, McNulty in
particular has blamed federal agents for the deaths of the Branch
Davidian leader, David Koresh, and about 80 of his followers, a
position many critics regard as anti-government propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   He and Hardy, however, regard as government propaganda the
official explanation that Koresh and his followers carried out a
suicide pact by setting fire to the compound and shooting
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Now the fire at the compound, near Waco, has emerged again as a
national issue. As much as anyone else, McNulty and Hardy helped
set in motion the events that have led Attorney General Janet Reno
to consider an independent investigation.
</P>
<P>
   An Arizona lawyer, Hardy, 48, requested, then sued the federal
government for documents and evidence related to Waco. Both men
pushed the Texas Rangers to launch an inquiry into the evidence
under state control.
</P>
<P>
   They also fed information to lawyers representing the families
of deceased Branch Davidians in a wrongful death lawsuit. And
McNulty, 53, a documentary filmmaker from Colorado, toured the
state evidence lockers four times, unearthing what he says are
potentially flammable devices capable of starting a fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mike and Dave deserve the lion's share of the credit for
coming up with the evidence,'' said Joe Phillips, a lawyer for the
Branch Davidian families in the wrongful death lawsuit, scheduled
to go to trial in federal court in Waco on Oct. 18. ``They've been
working on this for years.''
</P>
<P>
   Once again, Waco is looming as a potential embarrassment for the
FBI and the Justice Department. Congress is issuing subpoenas for
evidence and witnesses in response to disclosures that the FBI,
despite denials to the contrary, used pyrotechnic tear-gas
canisters on the morning of the fire.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of it all, McNulty and Hardy are enjoying a broad
new forum, appearing regularly on radio and television programs.
McNulty often uses his media appearances to promote his forthcoming
documentary, ``Waco: A New Revelation.'' In an interview on Court
TV, McNulty waved a handwritten sign with a 1-800 number for the
film.
</P>
<P>
   Critics, however, say they fear that, while the two men may have
come up with some information worth examining, they have spread
unsubstantiated and misleading information as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really unfortunate,'' said Mark Potok, a spokesman for
the Southern Poverty Law Center, a group that monitors the militia
movement and other anti-government groups. ``This has given
credence to the rest of McNulty's view, which are unsupported.''
</P>
<P>
   In a series of interviews, McNulty said he and Hardy met about a
decade ago in Southern California, either at a pistol range ``or
some kind of gun get-together.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, a former Interior Department lawyer in Washington, said
he returned home to Arizona in 1990 and soon entered private
practice, writing law review articles, including one he co-authored
tracing the legal history of militias.
</P>
<P>
   He described himself as ``an obsessive compulsive'' whose pet
issue is his belief that law enforcement is becoming dangerously
militaristic. Convinced that Waco proved his point, Hardy filed
eight Freedom of Information requests against the Justice
Department and the FBI.
</P>
<P>
   He got nowhere in what became a paper trail of fruitless
correspondence with government officials. In 1996, Hardy filed a
lawsuit, claiming that the government was stonewalling his efforts
to obtain documents and evidence that belonged in the public
domain.
</P>
<P>
   As it turned out, much of that evidence was stored in Austin,
inside the evidence rooms of the Texas Department of Public Safety.
In the aftermath of the Branch Davidian fire, the Texas Rangers
were asked to investigate and collect crime scene evidence, and
they kept it.
</P>
<P>
   But when Hardy requested evidence from the Rangers under the
state's public records act, he was told that only the Justice
Department could authorize access to the evidence. When he wrote to
the Justice Department, he was told that the evidence was under the
control of the Rangers.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, a federal judge agreed that Hardy had been wrongly
denied documents and, as a penalty, awarded him more than $32,000
in legal fees.
</P>
<P>
   In the midst of his paper trail, Hardy wrote one letter to Texas
officials bluntly saying, ``Did it ever occur to you guys that
you're being set up?''
</P>
<P>
   McNulty, meanwhile, was pushing on a different front. Until the
early 1990s, he sold insurance in Southern California, living
comfortably until he said the national company he represented
decided to uproot from the West Coast.
</P>
<P>
   A Vietnam veteran who converted 20 years ago from Catholicism to
the Mormon faith, McNulty said the Branch Davidian fire reminded
him of a bloody incident in Mormon history, the Haun's Mill
Massacre of 1838. In that episode, a mob in Missouri herded Mormons
into a grist mill and shot them to death. Ultimately, the Mormons,
led by Joseph Smith, were ordered out of Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   With his insurance business in disarray, McNulty said he became
increasingly consumed with Waco, obtaining evidence such as a copy
of an infrared videotape of the incident. He moved his wife and
five children to Ft. Collins, Colo., and became a producer on a
documentary, ``Waco: Rules of Engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   A critical assessment of the role of the government, the film
was nominated for an Academy Award. The executive producer, Dan
Gifford, filed a lawsuit against McNulty, accusing him of selling a
pirated and re-edited version of the film, though the dispute was
settled out of court.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the Oscar nomination (the film did not win), ``Rules of
Engagement'' also was criticized for failing to accurately present
evidence that placed the government in a favorable light, and for
numerous inaccuracies.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Mark Pitcavage, a historian who specializes in
right-wing extremist groups and operates The Militia Watchdog Web
site, said the film made McNulty a celebrity among followers of
right-wing, anti-government groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Waco documentary was highly publicized, but the
inaccuracies were not,'' Pitcavage said. ``I don't think the
McNulty Waco documentary could even remotely be considered
objective.''
</P>
<P>
   McNulty strongly denied that he is ``an anti-government type''
and stoutly defends the findings in his first documentary. He
claimed that his upcoming film will detail his claims that federal
agents started the Waco fire and killed the Branch Davidian
followers. He has supported himself during his investigations with
payments from his film company, MGA Films, and with stipends paid
by plaintiff's lawyers in the civil case.

MIDEAST TALKS NARROW FOCUS ON LAND-FOR-SECURITY ACCORD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By CHARLES M. SENNOTT  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CAIRO _ A long night of tense Israeli-Palestinian negotiations
ended in Jerusalem without a deal, but both sides held out hope
that a signing ceremony would still take place in Egypt Thursday
for a new agreement to move the long-stalled peace process forward.
</P>
<P>
   The negotiators were trying to hammer out the details of a
revised ``land for security'' accord before US Secretary of State
Madeleine K. Albright's arrival in the Middle East.
</P>
<P>
   Albright landed in Morocco Wednesday and is expected to arrive
in Alexandria, Egypt, Thursday for the possible signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope we will reach a conclusion of the present negotiations
within the next few hours,'' Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat told
reporters in the Netherlands just before the talks had concluded
and before he cut short a trip to the Hague, reportedly to head to
Alexandria.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier, Israeli Cabinet minister Chaim Ramon emerged from a
Jerusalem hotel after a negotiating session between Israeli and
Palestinian negotiators, saying, ``Everything will be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   The key sticking point, negotiators on both sides said, was the
issue of the release of Palestinian prisoners currently held in
Israeli prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were said to be locked in debate over the fate of
fewer than 50 prisoners. The Israelis agreed to release some 350,
and the Palestinians were demanding at least 400 be freed. The
Palestinians originally requested 650 be release.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye River deal, brokered by President Clinton last October
at the Wye River plantation in Maryland, was signed in Washington
by Arafat and then Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. It
called for Israel to hand over land to the Palestinians in return
for security measures and for Israel to release Palestinian
prisoners. But Netanyahu froze the interim agreement only two
months later after handing over just two percent of West Bank land
to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The release of prisoners is an emotional issue for both sides.
The Palestinians say these are prisoners of war and political
detainees who fought for the Palestinian cause. Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak has insisted he will not violate an Israeli vow
not to release prisoners who have taken part in the killing of
Israelis.
</P>
<P>
   Israel's intense public sentiment against releasing Palestinians
with Israeli ``blood on their hands,'' as Barak has put it, ran
higher than usual with news Wednesday that the military wing of the
radical Islamic group Hamas claimed responsibility for killing an
Israeli couple hiking in the West Bank Monday and pledged to
continue its attacks against Israeli and Jewish interests around
the world.
</P>
<P>
   The Wye deal, as originally conceived, called for the release of
750 Palestinian prisoners and a three-stage Israeli troop
withdrawal from a further 13 percent of the West Bank in return for
further security steps to be taken by Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   If that 13 percent of the West Bank is ceded to the Palestinian
Authority, the Palestinians would be left with full or partial
control of roughly 40 percent of the West Bank, which Israel
captured from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day War.
</P>
<P>
   Under the emerging agreement, the next Israeli troop pullback
would begin in the next few days, to be followed by a second one
Nov. 15 and a third one at the end of the year or the beginning of
2000.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides appeared to have compromised on a new deadline for
a final peace agreement, which would tackle the thorny issues of
the status of Jerusalem, the fate of millions of Palestinian
refugees, and the distribution of water resources.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has expressed an eagerness to implement the Wye agreement
and reportedly is willing to accept Arafat's cherished goal of an
independent Palestinian state in an effort to move quickly to
resolving the so-called ``final status'' issues.
</P>
<P>
   Barak has said he believes the longer the interim agreements
take, the more likely the process is to hit snags along the way
that will further delay the final peace. But to avoid that, Barak
has said he wants to fold the final phases of troop withdrawals in
the Wye agreement into the final status talks. It is a move that
the Palestinians are leery of because they believe it could in the
end leave them with less West Bank land and a weaker bargaining
position.
</P>
<P>
   Albright is hopeful the agreement will be reached so she can
avoid playing the role of mediator and instead concentrate on
laying the groundwork for a resumption of direct talks between
Israel and Syria over the Golan Heights. After stopping in Israel
and in Palestinian Authority administered territories on Friday,
Albright is expected to visit Syria on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   The Israeli-Syrian negotiating track was derailed in 1996.
Syrians claim the Israelis agreed in principle to a full withdrawal
from the Golan Heights, which they captured in 1967, but Israel
disputes that.
</P>
<P>
   State Department spokesman James Foley said, ``It's an obstacle
that can be overcome pecisely because both sides want to overcome
it. They want to be back at the table instead of talking about how
they negotiate.''
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Egypt was preparing the presidential palace in
Alexandria for the signing ceremony. But despite what promises to
be a day of fanfare and handshakes, there are many skeptics in the
Arab world. They wonder how the truly tough issues, such as the
status of Jerusalem and the fate of Palestinian refugees, can be
negotiated if the two sides can get held up over 50 prisoners.
</P>
<P>
   Mohammed Sayed al Said, political analyst and director of the Al
Ahram Strategic Center in Cairo, said, ``Forgive me for not joining
in the euphoria. But why should a deal that has already been agreed
upon need to be revised? These are games that the Israelis are
playing. I don't see it as a positive sign of movement forward, but
as a worrisome sign over how things will go in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Ahmed Esmat Abdel Meguid, secretary general of the Cairo-based
Arab League, who was instrumental in the early phase of acheving a
peace agreement between Egypt and Israel in 1979, was less
pessimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know something about dealing with the Israelis,'' he said.
``Barak still has a chance to prove himself. His predecessor was a
hopeless case, but we still have hope for Barak. But he must move
quickly and stop playing these games.''

<P>
   In his forthcoming ``Seven Wonders: Timeless Tools for a
Healthier Planet'' (Sierra Club; $12.95),  &UR; John Ryan &LR;  of the
Northwest Environmental Watch finds the following causes for seven
different kinds of joy:
</P>
<P>
   The bicycle, the condom, the ceiling fan, the clothesline, Thai
food, the public library and the ladybug.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; THE CELEBRITY TREATMENT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Jenny Craig &LR;  announced Wednesday &LR;   &LR; that  &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR;  has
been on its diet program since early this summer.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky is not getting services free in exchange for the
announcement and is being treated like any other client, said Craig
spokesman  &UR; Brian Luscomb &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Barbra Streisand &LR; , on the other hand, seems to think that
playing the stock market is like making reservations in a
restaurant: A star can get in where everyone else is turned away.
</P>
<P>
   A recent item mentioned Streisand's contacting thestreet.com
before it went public and requesting (successfully) the privilege
of getting in on the friends and family list before the public
offering.
</P>
<P>
   The latest Business Week reports that Streisand called E-Loan, a
Dublin outfit that went public earlier this year, and made the same
request. The head of the company was ``so thrilled _ and impressed
with Streisand's gumption to call people she has never met,'' that
she put her on the friends and family list, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   Personals called Streisand's spokesman _ who wished to be
identified only as spokesman _ to inquire about the buy and whether
she'd been using her clout with other companies as well. ``A lot of
companies simulate these stories in order to attract investors,''
he said. ``I imagine that she makes some inquiries, but it's not
like she spends all her time on it. Everything is misleading. Her
first job is being an artist.''
</P>
<P>
   The spokesman said the story about Streisand and thestreet.com
wasn't true; CEO  &UR; Kevin English &LR;  confirmed to Personals that it
was.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; RULES AND REGULATIONS &LR;
</P>
<P>
   - A judge has ruled that  &UR; Alan Edelstein &LR; , a disgruntled
employee who has been giving muckraker  &UR; Michael Moore &LR;  a dose of
his own medicine _ calling him, e-mailing him, following him around
with a bullhorn and challenging him in public _ must stand trial
for harassment. Moore had filed charges against Edelstein, whose
lawyer told MSNBC that the issue was ``freedom of speech. Michael
Moore's behavior has been the epitome of hypocrisy.''
</P>
<P>
   - The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is suing
Sotheby's for emblazoning its catalog covers with images of Oscars
for sale. All of the Oscars auctioned off in recent years were from
before 1951, when the winners began signing agreements not to sell
their prizes. The academy allows the pre-1951 sales but is upset
about the use of the Oscar images for what it deems advertising.
The lawsuit claims that Sotheby's infringed upon the academy's
copyright and trademark by using the statue ``as a pawn for
commerce,'' lawyer  &UR; David Quinto &LR;  told the Wall Street Journal.
</P>
<P>
   - According to a Marin County police report forwarded by
 &UR; Robert Steiner &LR; , ``Someone in the 5800 block of Nave Drive reported
that a man (was) screaming behind Nave Bowl. An officer contacted a
religious group involved in a group hug.'' In additional mysterious
crime news, a woman accused of trespassing in a store was seen a
few minutes later outside wearing ``a tribal hat and pink jeans.''
Can anyone describe a Marin tribal hat?
</P>
<P>
   - A reader who stays regularly at the Harvard Club in Manhattan
forwards a memo dated Jan. 1, 1999: ``Although the House Committee
has decided to end the experiment in casual dress at breakfast in
the Main Dining Room, a discreet display of business papers will
continue to be permitted.''
</P>
<P>
   &UR; MMM-MMM-GOOD &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Francis Rigney &LR;  forwards the entire ingredient list for Sweet
'n Low Li'l Bits Chocolately Candies, as printed in the Nutrition
Action Newsletter:
</P>
<P>
   Maltitol, salatrim, cocoa powder, sodium caseinate, gum arabic,
Yellow 5, Yellow 6, Red 40, Blue 1, Blue 2, titanium dioxide,
lecithin, acesulfame K, natural flavor, artificial flavor, carnauba
wax, beeswax and confectionary glaze.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; WHO SAID WHAT &LR;
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw (Queen Elizabeth II) once, in Vancouver. She was driving
by about 10 feet away, and she was in a beautiful dove gray outfit
and pillbox hat, and she was doing her wave and she looked like a
real nice lady. I hope she is. Because, for all her faults, we love
our Queen, as W.S. Gilbert said. Also, she looked very Jewish to
me.''

 HOUSTON: civil case. 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Until just over a year ago neither McNulty nor Hardy had been
able to collect much, if any, evidence from the government. Then,
McNulty began telephoning assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston,
one of the federal prosecutors in Waco who had handled the criminal
case against several Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was very skeptical when he heard who I was,'' McNulty said.
</P>
<P>
   McNulty placed scores of calls to Johnston, prodding and
cajoling for access to the locked state evidence room. Toward the
end of 1998, McNulty said he confronted Johnston with copies of
records from Fort Bragg, N.C., that suggested members of an elite
military unit were present at Waco.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he had obtained the documents from Hardy. Unlike the
Justice Department or the FBI, the military responded quickly to
Hardy's FOIA requests, providing documents that detailed how
members of the elite Delta Force military unit were present at Waco
during the day of the fire. The Pentagon now says there were three
Delta Force soldiers present as observers.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, Johnston decided that McNulty should be allowed to
peruse the evidence with a camera crew. He said he contacted the
head of the Justice Department's office of public relations in
Washington for final approval.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't want to be a party to even the appearance of
stonewalling him,'' said Johnston. ``Ultimately, this is the
public's evidence.''
</P>
<P>
   Between November 1998 and March 1999, McNulty said he paid four
visits to the evidence rooms in Austin, always escorted by at least
one Texas Ranger.
</P>
<P>
   He said he found at least four projectiles that he believes are
pyrotechnic and other potentially flammable devices known as
``flashbangs'' that had been discovered inside the compound.
</P>
<P>
   On one visit, McNulty said he brought a munitions expert to take
samples for later testing. He said he reported his finding to the
Texas Rangers, noting that some evidence listed on the inventory
was missing or mislabeled.
</P>
<P>
   Hardy, the lawyer, meanwhile, had continued to try to get both
the Rangers and the Justice Department to grant his FOIA requests.
Frustrated, he said he made copies of his correspondence and sent
them to Jerry Patterson, a former Texas state senator. Patterson is
a conservative Republican who authored the state's 1995 concealed
weapons law.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess I'm the go-to-guy for the black helicopter crowd,''
joked Patterson, now a lobbyist in Austin. He said Hardy's Texas
friends ``called me up and said the Department of Public Safety has
possession of evidence that brings a whole new light on what
happened at Waco. We feared that the evidence will be turned over
to the Department of Justice never to see the light of day.''
</P>
<P>
   Patterson said he first contacted Clay Johnson, chief of staff
for Gov. George W. Bush, who referred him to James B. Francis Jr.,
chairman of the Texas Department of Public Safety. He said he met
with Francis, explaining that neither the Rangers nor the Justice
Department claimed to control access to the Waco evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a mess,'' Francis said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   This summer, the Department of Public Safety began an
investigation of the evidence in the storage rooms. Francis said
the Rangers would complete their report in time to respond to a
congressional subpoena for a hearing planned for Sept. 7. The
department also asked U.S. District Judge Walter S. Smith Jr. to
take possession of all evidence related to the Branch Davidian
case, much of which remains with the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   In a sweeping order issued earlier this month, Smith ordered the
government to hand over everything ``in any way relevant'' to the
Branch Davidian siege and subsequent fire. The judge noted that the
plaintiffs in the civil case ``have a right to seek access'' to the
evidence. On Tuesday, Justice Department lawyers sought to block
Smith's order and maintain control of the evidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once the court decided that the evidence was worth taking
control of, it was the triggering device of everything that has
happened since then,'' Francis said.
</P>
<P>
   Francis would only speak in broad terms about the evidence, but
he said there were eyewitness accounts and photographs that raised
questions about whether the Delta Force participated at Waco. By
law, military units such as the Delta Force are allowed to observe
but not operate inside the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are military guys in body armor and in face paint,''
said Francis, describing pieces of evidence. ``It might be
significant evidence when all the facts come out.''
</P>
<P>
   Unless Smith grants a continuance, the wrongful death lawsuit
will begin in about a month. Michael Caddell, the lead plaintiff's
lawyer, said that government lawyers have stymied all of his
discovery attempts since the case was filed in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, Caddell said he has had to rely on McNulty and Hardy to
provide him with copies of documents and evidence. He estimated
that he has paid McNulty between $40,000 and $50,000 for services
such as testing of evidence, lab work and investigative help.
</P>
<P>
   ``His access to information has been critical,'' Caddell said.
``He has looked at information that Congress didn't see and the FBI
didn't see or didn't want to acknowledge.'' Without evidence
provided to him by McNulty and Hardy, Caddell said Smith might have
granted a government motion to dismiss the case.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, everything was pushed fully into the public eye last
week when a former senior FBI official told Lee Hancock of the The
Dallas Morning News that two potentially flammable tear-gas
projectiles were used at Waco by an FBI hostage rescue team on the
same morning as the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The official, Danny Coulson, said he learned of the canisters in
recent weeks after years in which FBI officials, including himself,
had denied that any potentially flammable projectiles were used. He
declined to say how he heard of the canisters. Justice Department
officials initially denied Coulson's claims but later recanted.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview earlier this week, Coulson reiterated his belief
that the canisters were not connected to fire. On that day, FBI
agents using tanks had sprayed tear gas into the Branch Davidian
compound in an attempt to forcibly end the siege.
</P>
<P>
   ``The significance as it applies to the fire is none,'' Coulson
said. ``The real significance is that the attorney general and many
FBI officials, including myself, have given statements that
pyrotechnic devices were not used, and now we know that is an
error. It goes to the very credibility of the inquiry conducted by
the Department of Justice.''
</P>
<P>
   For critics of McNulty and Hardy, the new admissions by the
government are particularly frustrating. ``They deserve a little
bit of credit,'' Pitcavage said grudgingly. ``But you wish that
someone else had discovered this stuff instead. These guys have
ulterior motives.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hardy and McNulty make no apologies. ``I'm downright happy
about it,'' said Hardy.

JEFFERSON SEES RESILIENCY IN PATRIOTS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Shawn Jefferson has been around the NFL for nine
years. He's survived a lot. He went to a Super Bowl with the San
Diego Chargers in 1994, lost, then watched the almost instant
dismantling of that team in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Former Chargers and present Detroit Lions coach Bobby Ross told
Jefferson he had to let him go because the Chargers were making
room for younger receivers.
</P>
<P>
   Not long after, Bill Parcells scooped up Jefferson, signing him
to a four-year deal that expires at the end of this season.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson understands how teams can win and he also understands
how teams can die quickly. He's witnessed a subtle but constant
erosion of the Patriots since they appeared in the 1997 Super Bowl,
but he insists it isn't San Diego all over again.
</P>
<P>
   ``No way,'' said Jefferson, who has played in 127 of a possible
128 regular-season games and who last year averaged 22.7 yards per
reception. ``This team has shown tremendous resiliency over the
years. We've lost players and we've lost games, but we always come
back strong and show what we are. I think we're a tough team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson said the Patriots, who Thursday night will attempt to
atone for the 45-14 shellacking they received from the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers last Saturday in their exhibition finale against the
Carolina Panthers in Charlotte, N.C., have shown a different
attitude in practice this week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We came out the other day and started to fly around,'' he
said. ``We can't let one bad game in the preseason bother us. I
think we have to take these setbacks, learn from them, and then
don't make the same mistakes over and over again. I think we've
done that in the past and we'll do it again. It shows that you're a
mature team if you can do that. I think we've done that time and
time again. When we take a blow, we don't sulk. We'll be ready to
play.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson said that while the Patriots need to finish the
exhibition season strongly, ``We're just prepping for the regular
season. We don't have all of our packages in yet. Preseason is a
warmup for the regular season. Teams look at preseason in different
ways. You call it dress rehearsal. Whatever. We have to execute.
But I think we're way ahead of where we were last year. We've shown
improvement every game. Our offense has the potential to be
something special. It's the second year of this system and I think
we all feel comfortable in it.''
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson, who was mentioned this offseason as a player who
might be cut for salary cap purposes or traded to fill another need
_ the Jets reportedly were ready to pounce if he were cut _ has
survived and is still starting opposite Terry Glenn. At the age of
30, Jefferson remains a deep threat. If you watch Jefferson's deep
routes, he's open more often than not. Yet in the Patriots'
offense, he's often no more than a decoy. He gets the defensive
backs to chase him downfield to open things up for Ben Coates or so
Drew Bledsoe can throw to Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   It's a role Jefferson has accepted without much fanfare. He's
also taken on the role of mentor to younger receivers such as Glenn
and Tony Simmons, and still he works on scout teams _ playing the
part of the opponent's top receiver _ so he can prepare starting
cornerbacks Ty Law and Steve Israel. Jefferson does it without
being asked, setting an example for younger players.
</P>
<P>
   Through it all, Jefferson understands this may be his final year
in New England. The team didn't address his contract status in the
offseason. He will earn a nice salary of $1.8 million this season,
and given the fact he's done quite well in the stock market, he
will likely never have to worry about money.
</P>
<P>
   There was a brief recent conversation with Patriots owner Bob
Kraft, who expressed gratitude to Jefferson for what he's meant to
the team, but whether that translates into a contract extension
remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson has watched as other veterans _ such as Todd Collins,
Willie Clay, Dave Wohlabaugh, and Tom Tupa _ have gone elsewhere.
Jefferson said he's not afraid of relocating and told personnel
head Bobby Grier before camp started that he would accept whatever
was best for the team.
</P>
<P>
   Even recently, there were reports of the Dallas Cowboys looking
into a deal for Jefferson, but the Patriots wanted linebacker
Randall Godfrey in return so nothing came of it.
</P>
<P>
   Grier then announced that none of his receivers were going to be
traded, fearing what occurred last season when three of them
(Jefferson not included) went down in a 10-day period.
</P>
<P>
   Jefferson's top asset is durability. The only game he's ever
missed was his second as a Patriot, in 1996, when Parcells kept him
out because he had suffered a mild concussion the week before in
Miami. Jefferson is still upset that Parcells cost him a perfect
attendance record and ended his consecutive-game streak at 81.
</P>
<P>
   In spite of this, it's obvious the Patriots are grooming Simmons
to take Jefferson's place. Jefferson understands this and just
keeps showing up for work, helping Simmons and anyone else who
needs it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had people who helped me when I was coming up with
Houston,'' said Jefferson. ``Warren Moon took me aside and showed
me how to play and how to act. I always remembered that, and I'll
always be willing to do that for a young kid. We're a team. I've
been around a long time. If I can help a kid be better, that's good
for our team.''

   In his forthcoming ``Seven Wonders: Timeless Tools for a

his own medicine _ calling him, e-mailing him, following him around
with a bullhorn and challenging him in public _ must stand trial
for harassment. Moore had filed charges against Edelstein, whose
lawyer told MSNBC that the issue was ``freedom of speech. Michael
Moore's behavior has been the epitome of hypocrisy.''

   - The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is suing
Sotheby's for emblazoning its catalog covers with images of Oscars
for sale. All of the Oscars auctioned off in recent years were from
before 1951, when the winners began signing agreements not to sell
their prizes. The academy allows the pre-1951 sales but is upset
about the use of the Oscar images for what it deems advertising.
The lawsuit claims that Sotheby's infringed upon the academy's
copyright and trademark by using the statue ``as a pawn for
commerce,'' lawyer  &UR; David Quinto &LR;  told the Wall Street Journal.

   Jim Ivy fears that his son Jonathan, a freshman business major
at Pennsylvania State University, will graduate from college
without ever having taken a chemistry course. Montville High
School, the New Jersey school he attended, did not require
chemistry, and his adviser at Penn State says he can skip it there,
too _ provided that he signs on for more computer science courses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone says computer sciences are mandatory for him, but no
one has ever recommended that he even look at chemistry,'' said
Ivy, the chief executive of Savin Corp., a copier company in
Stamford, Conn. ``It's truly sad that kids can graduate today
without getting exposure to the fun of physical sciences.''
</P>
<P>
   No one questions the need to emphasize computers in education
these days. Nor do they deny the plethora of high-paying jobs that
the computer world offers, from the mundane tasks of fixing
computers to the mind-stretching ones of designing digital code.
Few suggest that basic sciences are disappearing from the
classroom.
</P>
<P>
   But a sense is growing in some business quarters that the sheer
ubiquity of computers has deflected attention from more traditional
sciences and skills.
</P>
<P>
   Experts worry that vocational schools will soon churn out too
many computer repair people and too few refrigerator technicians.
They worry even more that universities will produce scads of people
who can use computers as research and calculating tools but far too
few who can use the scientific method to solve problems. They fret
that the prospect of quick wealth will lure bright students who
might have become research scientists _ or science teachers and
professors _into joining Internet ventures instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not going to need more HTML coders five years from now.
We're going to need biotechnologists,'' said Paul Saffo, a director
of the Institute for the Future, a research group in Menlo Park,
Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone wants to start an Internet business today,'' he
added, ``because they don't realize that the science moguls of a
decade down the road will be the biotechnologists. And that means a
good chance that the biotechnology moguls a decade from now will be
foreign-born.''
</P>
<P>
   Others worry that the next generation might not develop the
experimental zeal and creative thinking of the precomputer days.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer science courses teach skills and techniques, but they
don't teach critical thinking the way physics does,'' said Gerald
Wheeler, executive director of the National Science Teachers
Association.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, many computer scientists take umbrage at any hint
that theirs is an intellectually bankrupt field. Indeed, Michael
Hammer, the management consultant who coined the term
``re-engineering'' and who is often cited as a premier management
thinker, has a doctorate in computer science.
</P>
<P>
   ``Computer science gives you the intellectual grounding to deal
with enormous complexity,'' he said. ``The liberal arts teach
critical thinking, the basic sciences teach the scientific method,
but computer sciences gives you systems thinking skills. It teaches
the value of precision, and it gives you the ability to deal with
tradeoffs and with huge issues of design.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, that idea does not stop science educators from worrying
that their fields are being eclipsed. According to Richard Heckel,
a professor emeritus of metallurgical engineering at Michigan
Technological University, who collects statistics on engineering
enrollments, ``The number of undergraduates going into computer
sciences and computer engineering is growing rapidly, while
enrollments in electrical and environmental engineering is
plummeting.''
</P>
<P>
   Warren Hein, associate executive officer of the American
Association of Physics Teachers, cites a similar trend. ``The
number of undergraduate majors in physics is at a post-Sputnik
low,'' he said. ``Kids are saying, `Why should I go into something
as demanding and rigorous as physics when I can take computer
science and make more money?'''
</P>
<P>
   Take the case of Paul Hallee. All through high school he was on
the four-year college track, taking chemistry, biology, physics,
earth sciences _ all the traditional science courses. And he has
always loved the outdoors. So, going for a four-year degree in
environmental law _ the kind of program that trains forest rangers
_ seemed a no-brainer.
</P>
<P>
   That is, until he realized that his hobby, fixing computers,
could be a better career bet. Hallee was accepted into a four-year
program, but instead he took a two-year course in computers and
electronics. Now, at age 20, he is working for Maine Business
Solutions, a computer repair operation in Waterville, and hopes to
carve out a career administering computer networks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have ended up with a fancy four-year degree and no
clue of where to get a job,'' Hallee said. ``Computers seemed a
really viable option.''
</P>
<P>
   Most parents, worried about future jobs, are anxious to give
their children a head start in this computer-oriented world.
According to the Toy Manufacturers of America, some 10 million
scientific toys _ Chem Craft sets and such _ were sold in both 1997
and 1998. Some 32 million electronic toys _ computer games and such
_ were sold last year, up from 28 million in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   The widening interest gap is particularly apparent in vocational
schools, which are often pressed for funds. Many have added
computer skills courses and subtracted courses in, say, automotive
repair, welding and other traditional blue-collar skills. ``If they
are using resources for new computer programs, they have to cut the
ones they see as marginal, or that have low enrollment,'' said
Thomas Holdsworth, director of college and technical programs at
Skills USA-Vica, &UR;  &LR; which creates programs for vocational education.

</P>
<P>
   Within schools, the financial crunch is affecting academic
programs, too. Western Hills High School, in a poor part of
Cincinnati, used to offer anatomy, earth science, botany and
advanced-placement courses in biology, chemistry and physics. Last
year, it abolished all of them and converted many of its
laboratories to other uses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was all part of a cost-cutting directive, but the computer
labs did not get hit,'' said Louise Gerl, a biology teacher at the
school who says she spends her own money for supplies to do even
rudimentary experiments. ``Local companies bombard us with free
computers, but no one will give me materials to build a laboratory
or conduct experiments,'' Ms. Gerl said.
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, industry is trying to fill the gap. Dow Chemical
Co. recently sent a road show, made up of professional actors and
run by a professional director, around to junior and senior high
schools to ``educate children on the importance of science in a fun
MTV singing-dancing-game-show way,'' said William Stavropoulos,
Dow's chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Two years ago a consortium of automotive companies formed
Automotive Youth Educational Systems, a nonprofit organization in
Troy, Mich., that sets up mentoring and apprenticeships between
high school students and automotive executives and dealers. It has
even begun inviting kindergarten classes in to see how cars are
fixed or sold.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can make good money without a college degree in this
industry, but moms and dads just don't encourage their kids to be
technicians anymore,'' said Donald Gray, the president of the
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Although such industry-specific efforts can fill some job
pipelines, few educators believe they can do much to stop the
erosion of hands-on science in the schools. ``What corporations do
is a Band-Aid on a hemorrhaging wound,'' said Sylvia Ware, director
of education at the American Chemical Society, which has set up
groups to seek ways to train better science teachers.
</P>
<P>
   Computers and science education are not mutually exclusive, of
course. A growing number of teachers and professors, from the
prekindergarten level through graduate schools, are using software
packages and Web sites as tools to teach sciences.
</P>
<P>
   The American Chemical Society has set up a Web site
(www.chemcenter.org) that enables children to simulate some
experiments. ``Too many teachers are teaching science as something
that is learned from a book, rather than as a way of testing
reality, of looking at the world,'' Ms. Ware said.
</P>
<P>
   Educational associations are running with the computer ball,
too. The National Science Teachers Association, in conjunction with
Toshiba Corp., a leading maker of laptop computers, just sponsored
a contest among teachers to pick the best lesson plans using
laptops to teach scientific principles. Among the winning programs
was one that helped students learn about the human body's response
to physical activity by measuring their pulse rates at various
running speeds at the gym.
</P>
<P>
   The teachers association has also begun a program with textbook
publishers to include, in the margins next to specific topics,
links to its new Web site (www.scilinks.org), which offers expanded
discussions or experiments. Holt, Rinehart &AMP; Winston, a division of
Harcourt Brace, is including the links in two high school chemistry
and environmental science textbooks, and another publisher plans to
do so in new versions of elementary school science books.
</P>
<P>
   Still, many teachers worry that while chemical formulas and
physics equations can be conveyed through a computer screen, the
basic scientific questing that is supposed to accompany them
cannot. ``Computers can teach information, but they don't teach a
way to ask questions or conduct experiments where you don't know
the correct answer ahead of time,'' said Eric Gruenstein, a
professor of molecular genetics at the University of Cincinnati
Medical School.
</P>
<P>
   Saffo, the futurist, put it more succinctly. ``Computers done
right can open entirely new educational horizons,'' he said, ``but
computers done wrong will turn our high schools into trade
schools.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do computers teach that science can be just plain fun. That
is what Sarah Beth Corning is trying to do. She teaches science to
children ages 3 to 7 at the Village Infant Center in New York City.
It is an affluent school, and she has ample access to computers.
She pretty much shuns them.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, computers can simulate the bubbles that will rise if acid
is added to an alkali, but Ms. Corning infinitely prefers letting
the children make ``volcanoes'' by pouring vinegar into a baking
soda solution. ``They'll look at it on a computer once and get
bored, but they'll make the volcanoes again and again, and they'll
even check to see what happens if they add something else,'' she
said. ``They can learn from computers, but they need this kind of
hands-on experience to get hooked on science.''

AUERBACH ON BIRD'S HEART: `NO BIG DEAL' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER MAY  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Red Auerbach found out for the first time Tuesday that
Larry Bird had a heart problem while still with the Celtics. His
reaction: ``No big deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach was president of the franchise at the time and said
Wednesday that he wasn't the least bit upset that Bird never
brought up the subject.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a big guy; he was no kid,'' Auerbach said. ``It was no
big deal. It's not like he had a diseased valve or a lack of
circulation or he needed a balloon (angioplasty) or something. It
was up to him to tell us. From what I understand, it's no big
deal.''
</P>
<P>
   Bird revealed this week that he had an irregular heartbeat
called atrial fibrillation at the end of his playing career but
never told the Celtics about it. He finally came clean years after
he retired and still needs medication to control it. Celtics team
physician Arnold Scheller said he thought Bird needed to modify his
lifestyle, from alcohol intake to diet to exercise, to control the
problem.
</P>
<P>
   Auerbach said he understood exactly why Bird chose to talk about
the situation now _ he has a book to sell.
</P>
<P>
   ``You (media) guys amaze me,'' Auerbach said. ``Why now? If it
was really big news, don't you think it would have come out before
now? He's got a book.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he felt at all disappointed that Bird did not tell him
about the situation, Auerbach said, ``Look, all I know is that he
passed all the physicals. And at that time of his career, he was
under a doctor's care almost all the time for his back. Who knows?
It's always serious when it's the heart, but at the same time he
didn't seem to be concerned about it, or he would have mentioned
it. I just don't think it's a big deal.''
</P>
<P>

<P>
   The Celtics released their exhibition schedule Wednesday, and it
features two each games against Utah, Atlanta, Charlotte, and
Washington. Three games will be played in New England _ two in the
FleetCenter (Oct. 13 vs. Charlotte and Oct. 27 vs. Washington) and
one in Providence (Oct. 15 vs. Atlanta). The other ``home'' game is
at Lexington, Ky., vs. Utah Oct. 23. The most exotic stop is Oct.
25 in Biloxi, Miss., against Atlanta.

 &HT;    Class-action status requested in suit filed against UGA over
admissions
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin and Ernie Suggs
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a second attack on University of Georgia admissions
standards, three white women are charging reverse discrimination
and, perhaps more significantly, are asking a federal judge to
allow hundreds of others to join their case.
</P>
<P>
   The lawsuit, filed this week in U.S. District Court in Savannah,
contends that UGA's admissions policies have been
unconstitutionally discriminatory because they provide preferences
to male and African-American applicants.
</P>
<P>
   The three women _ Aimee Bogrow, Lindsay Donaldson and Molly Ann
Beckenhauer _ were denied admission to UGA this school year.
</P>
<P>
   Their lawyer, Lee Parks, who attacked the admissions standard in
a lawsuit by another white female last month, said if the lawsuit
prevails, the financial cost to the state could be steep.
</P>
<P>
   Donaldson and Beckenhauer qualify for the HOPE scholarship, but
their parents are paying as much as $20,000 a year for them to
attend out-of-state schools, he said. The three women will want to
be reimbursed for their current tuition costs, and Parks said he
will ask the state to pay his attorney fees.
</P>
<P>
   ``These are real numbers,'' Parks said. ``This is not symbolic,
and it's not going to be cheap.''
</P>
<P>
   UGA communications director Tom Jackson said the university is
aware of the lawsuit. ``We haven't determined any course of action
on it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Bogrow, 18, a graduate of North Springs High School, said she
wants to go to UGA.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am very disappointed, because I had high hopes of going,''
she said. ``I felt sure that I would be able to get in. I had the
extracurricular activities, the GPA, a good SAT, community service,
everything. ... Why am I not going? Because I'm not a black male.
That is what I am guessing.''
</P>
<P>
   Her mother, Cheryl Bogrow, a principal at an elementary school
near Atlanta, said the family was shocked when UGA rejected her
daughter's application. ``Her whole goal was to go to UGA,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   When Parks filed a similar lawsuit last month on behalf of
Jennifer L. Johnson, the university quickly admitted her.
</P>
<P>
   The school also said it no longer will give male applicants a
slight advantage in the applicant weighting process, called the
Total Student Index. But UGA has not changed policies that grant a
preference to African-American applicants. UGA is the only
state-funded university that has admitted to using such an
admissions formula.
</P>
<P>
   Parks estimated that hundreds of white women could seek damages
against the state Board of Regents if the case, before U.S.
District Judge B. Avant Edenfield, is granted class-action status.
The regents oversee higher education in Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   If UGA decides to admit Bogrow, Donaldson and Beckenhauer _ as
it decided to admit Johnson _ that action would bolster his
class-action claims and ``not resolve the problem,'' Parks said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's important for them to recognize that people who have been
harmed get in as soon as possible _ that's good,'' Parks said.
``But they're dragging their heels on institutional change.''
</P>
<P>
   Even if UGA ultimately adopts race-neutral admissions polices,
Parks said, he will press the class-action lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Edenfield has put UGA on notice that he thinks its current
admissions program is unconstitutional. In a ruling in July, the
judge said: ``UGA cannot constitutionally justify the affirmative
use of race in its admissions decisions.''

OLDER AMERICANS WANT WORK IN RETIREMENT, SURVEY SHOWS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif., Pa., Ariz.)   By SARA RIMER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A new survey of older Americans has found that 40 percent are
working in retirement or plan to work after they retire, while an
equal percentage do volunteer work or plan to.
</P>
<P>
   Marc Freedman, the president of Civic Ventures, a nonprofit
organization in California dedicated to expanding the social
contributions of older Americans and the sponsor of the survey,
said the poll showed that the concept of retirement as strictly
leisure is outdated.
</P>
<P>
   ``The golden years are dead,'' Freedman said in an interview
Wednesday after the results of the poll were released. ``These are
people who are demanding a more vital and engaged role in American
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The poll, however, indicated that older adults have a difficult
time finding meaningful volunteer opportunities, and that they feel
that their skills are not valued by organizations.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are tired of stuffing envelopes,'' Freedman said,
adding that his own grandmother, a retired clothing store manager,
was frustrated by the only volunteer job she could find, pushing a
gift cart in a Philadelphia hospital.
</P>
<P>
   The poll, which surveyed 803 men and women ages 50 to 75 and was
conducted by Peter D. Hart Research Associates in Washington, was
commissioned to explore the role of older people in American
society.
</P>
<P>
   One thing the poll found is that older Americans, whether they
are 55 or 75, hate the label ``the elderly.'' ``Elderly'' was cited
by 38 percent of those surveyed as the term they dislike most,
followed by ``Golden Agers,'' at 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Seniors'' was preferred by 32 percent of those surveyed, and
35 percent preferred either ``older adults'' or ``older
Americans.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked to choose between two different approaches to
retirement, 65 percent of those surveyed (61 percent of retirees
and 70 percent of non-retirees) agreed that it is ``a time to begin
a new chapter in life by being active and involved, starting new
activities, and setting new goals.''
</P>
<P>
   Just 28 percent (32 percent of retirees and 23 percent of
non-retirees) chose retirement as ``a time to take it easy, take
care of yourself, enjoy leisure activities, and take a
much-deserved rest from work and daily responsibilities.''
</P>
<P>
   Freedman said the poll showed that a new vision of retirement is
emerging in contrast to the leisure years promoted by marketers and
developers starting in the 1950s and 1960s. He noted that the
``golden years'' was a phrase coined by the Del Webb Corp.,
builders of the first large-scale retirement community, Sun City,
which opened outside Phoenix, Ariz.
</P>
<P>
   A few years after the Sun City opening, another huge retirement
community began attracting buyers in Laguna Hills, Calif., with its
name, Leisure World, echoing the Del Webb philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, the poll confirms earlier surveys that most
Americans stay in their homes when they retire, rather than move.
Seventy-three percent of those surveyed said they either have not
moved or do not plan to move to a new home or community during
their retirement.
</P>
<P>
   While they have diverse plans and goals for retirement, a large
majority say they will carve out a new path for later life, with 80
percent rejecting the idea that ``my retirement is or will be
similar to my parents' retirement.''
</P>
<P>
   Their attitudes toward retirement are hopeful, with 81 percent
volunteering a specific positive impression of this stage in life,
including freedom from job pressures, having time to do what they
want, and enjoying life. Only 19 percent volunteered a negative
impression of retirement, with those views stemming largely from
being perceived by others as ``over the hill'' or ``past their
prime,'' though they also expressed concerns about health and
financial security.
</P>
<P>
   According to the poll, 57 percent of retirees and 62 percent of
non-retirees say they have volunteered or done community service
work in the last year. The poll found that older Americans are most
interested in raising money for charities like churches, schools
and universities, helping the elderly and working with children and
youth.
</P>
<P>
   As for role models, 43 percent of those surveyed held up former
President Jimmy Carter, who teaches Sunday school, writes books,
builds houses with Habitat for Humanity, and travels around the
world as an unofficial goodwill ambassador, as the best example of
the ideals they seek in retirement. Other role models listed were
former Gen. Colin Powell and John Glenn, the retired astronaut who
returned to space last year at the age of 77.

   News of the GOP straw poll taken Aug. 14 in Ames, Iowa, made the
front pages of newspapers nationwide in the past couple of weeks.
The poll marked an important early step in a long process to select
our next president. The series of events will ends with the
national election Nov. 4, 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Many straw polls occur in the presidential election process, but
few draw as much attention as the one in Iowa; the next big one is
a Democratic Party straw poll in Orlando, Fla., in December.
</P>
<P>
   What is a straw poll?
</P>
<P>
   A straw poll tests the opinions of a group of voters. In this
case, members of the Republican Party voted on their choice for the
top candidate for president from among the individuals in their
party. This year, a record 24,000 Iowans voted in this event.
</P>
<P>
   The event, which has been held since 1979, is not like a regular
election in that voting is not free _ the price to participate is
$25. The money raised goes toward the Republican Party of Iowa.
</P>
<P>
   Any political party can hold straw polls. The outcome of a straw
poll has no official effect on the presidential race. The poll
serves only as an early test of a candidate's organization in a
particular state, and it generates a lot of coverage by the news
media.
</P>
<P>
   Some critics say that the event serves as more of a popularity
contest than an indication of how much support exists for any
candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Critics also say that voting may be biased because the
candidates' campaigns often provide transportation, food and the
tickets required to take part in the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Where does the name come from?
</P>
<P>
   There are a couple of theories on the origin of the name.
</P>
<P>
   One says that taking a straw poll of opinion is kind of like
throwing a handful of straw in the air to see which way the wind
blows it, according to a ``San Francisco Chronicle'' report. The
Iowa Republican Party's Web site credits author John Selden with
writing, ``Take a straw and throw it up into the air _ you may see
by that which way the wind is.''
</P>
<P>
   Others say the origin of the word comes from political
tradition. In elections of long ago, each voter would get a piece
of straw and place it in the pile for his or her candidate of
choice.
</P>
<P>
   Why are straw polls taken?
</P>
<P>
   A strong showing in a straw poll, such as the one in Iowa, can
help candidates get attention _ and, they hope, more money for
their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   A poor showing in the poll shows a lack of support for the
candidate. Lamar Alexander's weak standing in the Iowa poll caused
him to drop out of the race.
</P>
<P>
   What are the next steps?
</P>
<P>
   Americans can expect to see the results of new polls practically
every day in the months leading to the election. But the next
serious stage in the race for the presidency involves state
caucuses and primaries.
</P>
<P>
   Then, next summer, delegates from all the states and Washington,
D.C., will come together at the Republican and Democratic
conventions to decide which candidate will be the party's nominee
for president. After that, the real fun begins as the parties
square off against each other in the contest to see who will be
elected president.
</P>
<P>
   Terms to know
</P>
<P>
   Political party: a group that joins together because its members
share many ideas about what the government should do. The main
parties in the United States are:
</P>
<P>
   Republican Party, nicknamed Grand Old Party or GOP. Its symbol
is an elephant.
</P>
<P>
   Democratic Party. Its symbol is a donkey.
</P>
<P>
   A new independent party, the Reform Party, was begun in 1996 by
Dallas businessman Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
   Candidate: someone seeking an elected office. Qualifications to
be president are that the man or woman must have been born in
America, be at least age 35 and have lived in the United States for
at least 14 years.
</P>
<P>
   Delegates: officials chosen by the public to represent it in
political-party votes.
</P>
<P>
   Presidential primary: statewide elections to select delegates to
the party's national nominating convention.
</P>
<P>
   Caucus: a private meeting of political-party members to select
delegates for a state or national nominating convention.

   TOPSAIL BEACH, N.C. _ During lunch Tuesday at the Topsail Beach
Shop and Grill here, most people were checking with their neighbors
to see how they weathered Hurricane Dennis and the evacuation. But
anyone who walked up to Jean Beasley's table first asked how the
sea turtles fared.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Beasley and the six people at her table, sea turtles are
like family. Everyone at the table spends much of their summer
helping turtles through birth, sickness and even death.
</P>
<P>
   They are among more than 100 volunteers in the Topsail Turtle
Project who patrol the 26-mile-long beach of Topsail Island every
day, all summer, to protect the more than 180 sea turtle nests laid
this season.
</P>
<P>
   And each of them also volunteers at the Karen Beasley Sea Turtle
Rescue and Rehabilitation Center here, named in memory of Ms.
Beasley's daughter, who founded the Topsail Turtle Project. The
hospital is caring for nine injured or ill sea turtles, found along
the beaches of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beasley, 63, a retired teacher, is the director of the
turtle project and of the turtle hospital, as it is called.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers share a love of the big, mysterious, prehistoric
creatures who lumber from the sea every year to burrow nests in the
sand. The female turtles, which are often 200 to 300 pounds, lay a
clutch of about 125 eggs, cover them with mounds of sand and then
amble back into the ocean.
</P>
<P>
   ``I first saw a mother turtle come up and nest at the steps of
my house 30 years ago,'' Ms. Beasley said. ``And it was such an
awesome sight that I have been committed to the turtles ever since.
They are such benign, magnificent creatures.''
</P>
<P>
   The turtle eggs hatch about two months after the nest is dug.
The hatchlings then join together in the night to push up the sand
covering them and, guided by the light of the moon, make their way
into the ocean. They go into a ``swimming frenzy'' for a few days
until they reach warmer waters, where they live for their first
year or more.
</P>
<P>
   That is, if everything goes well.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 percent of the hatchlings make it to water, said Terry
Meyer, 42, one of five volunteer coordinators who work with Ms.
Beasley. ``About 1 in 1,000 of those will survive the first year.
And about 1 in 5,000 to 10,000 will reach adulthood, which is
anywhere from 20 to 30 years old.''
</P>
<P>
   There have always been many natural predators, like sharks, in
the sea. In addition, hurricanes threaten the nests of the turtles,
who have a life span of more than 100 years. But in the past few
decades, human activities are what has put the turtles on the verge
of extinction.
</P>
<P>
   Beach-front development has thrown off the turtles' nesting
instincts. Lights from houses and businesses sometimes trick the
baby turtles into heading inland instead of into the sea. If they
do not get to the water soon after hatching, they die. And
motorboat propellers and the nets and hooks of commercial fishers
have killed many turtles.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, all five species of sea turtles found on the shores of
this country are on the endangered or threatened species lists of
the United States Fish and Wildlife Service.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Beasley, Ms. Meyer and thousands of other volunteers along
the Southeastern coast are determined to make sure the turtles do
not become extinct. In North Carolina, which is the northernmost
region in the United States with sea turtle nests, 21 such
volunteer groups, totaling about 500 people, patrol about 320 miles
of beaches.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina, Georgia, Florida and a few other states have
similar projects, which are mandated and financed by the Federal
Endangered Species Act.
</P>
<P>
   The volunteers sit with the turtles' nests at night when they
look ready to hatch, protecting the hatchlings from natural
predators like ghost crabs.
</P>
<P>
   They ask vacationers unfamiliar with the effects of lights on
the hatchlings to keep their outside lights and beach-front house
lights off at night. They patrol the beaches at dawn looking for
new nests, and then block off the nests so that people will not
inadvertently disturb them. And they teach people about sea
turtles, which are particularly beguiling to children.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turtles and kids always go together,'' said Ruth Boettcher,
who works for the North Carolina Wildlife Resources Commission as
the North Carolina sea turtle project coordinator, overseeing the
ea turtle protection groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``If somebody's curiosity about them is sparked when they are
young, it stays with them,'' Ms. Boettcher said.
</P>
<P>
   This year, preliminary data from the states have shown the
highest number of nests since records have been kept, which is
about the last 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Ms. Beasley said, ``Until we have at least a decade of
growth in the number of nests, I wouldn't say the population has
increased.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Hurricane Dennis did not seem as threatening as
Hurricane Bonnie last year, the volunteers did not evacuate the
turtles as they did then. Today they hooked up water pumps in the
turtle hospital, which they had disconnected before the storm, and
fed the turtles for the first time since Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Also, Ms. Meyer and the other volunteers began checking today on
each of the nests. In a few days, the volunteers will report
</P>
<P>
   to the state on the storm's effect on the nests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The turtles teach us that we are just specks in a great big
world,'' Ms. Meyer said. ``Through these turtles, we learn how
important it is to take care of other things in the world besides
ourselves.''

GAS MAY HAVE COME FROM GROUP'S SUPPLY 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Calif.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS FARRAGHER  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- MIT is investigating whether the gas that killed a
junior came from ``a community canister'' used by other students,
school officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A school spokesman said campus police had received a tip that
the nitrous oxide that asphyxiated 22-year-old Richard A. Guy,
whose body was found in a dorm room early Tuesday, ``was available
for a certain community.''
</P>
<P>
   ``How big that community was, I don't know,'' said Kenneth
Campbell, MIT's spokesman, who offered no other details. ``That's
one of the things that police are looking into.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the information that students other than Guy may have
had access to the nitrous oxide, also known as laughing gas, was
given to police ``presumably by someone in the MIT community.''
</P>
<P>
   The university said its investigation is focusing on who may
have supplied the gas to Guy.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the investigation is complete, and we fully expect that
to be prompt, we will take whatever action is appropriate based on
that report,'' said Rosalind Williams, MIT's dean of students and
undergraduate studies, noting that inhalation of the gas is
illegal.
</P>
<P>
   MIT also corrected its earlier report that the body of Guy, a
native of Mission Viejo, Calif., was found in his dorm room, which
was on the top or fifth floor of his East Campus residence hall. A
female student found Guy alone in a neighbor's room on the fifth
floor. She had gone there to feed a cat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The person who had the room was not at MIT, so presumably
(Guy) had a key,'' Campbell said.
</P>
<P>
   He could not say whether the gas canister contained markings
that would make it easy to trace to its supplier.
</P>
<P>
   Campus police are treating Guy's death as an accident. His body
was discovered with a plastic bag on _ but not over _ his head,
authorities said.
</P>
<P>
   As the probe into Guy's death continued, students returning to
classes in Cambridge acknowledged that life on a campus where Nobel
laureates teach and the nation's top students learn can be an
academic pressure cooker. But they warned that the tragedy may have
had nothing to do with the advent of another year of classroom
rigors.
</P>
<P>
   And they called the popular image of MIT as a place of students
wearing pocket protectors and staring at computer screens day and
night a one-dimensional caricature.
</P>
<P>
   ``MIT in some ways does pressure its students,'' said Eric J.
Plosky, a columnist for the student newspaper The Tech. ``But how
students respond to it individually does not always a trend make.''
</P>
<P>
   Plosky said a column he wrote earlier this week that implored
MIT students not to wrap themselves too tightly in the cocoon of
academia was written with tongue planted firmly in cheek.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a world outside your MIT course work,'' Plosky wrote.
``Don't neglect it. Entering freshman often succumb to various
kinds of physical and psychological sloth. Immersing themselves in
the celebrated geek culture of MIT, students many times become
completely apathetic about happenings off campus.''
</P>
<P>
   Plosky said that because it is unclear what happened to Guy,
there are no clear conclusions that can be drawn from his death.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would be the last person to say that what happened to
Richard Guy is the result of academic pressure at MIT,'' he said by
telephone from the dormitory where Guy died, and where police
Wednesday were carrying away boxes of evidence.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said MIT makes no apologies for the short-term
pressures and demands on campus. It's part of its longtime legacy,
she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This characteristic of MIT is terribly important in our way of
life here and in our self-identity,'' Williams said. ``That has
real positives and real negatives.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the negatives are that we have a lot of students here
and they're at an age where there are types of dangerous behavior
that are well-known in this age group.''
</P>
<P>
   But Williams said MIT's dropout rate is lower than the national
average and its binge-drinking rate is about half that of the
national norm.
</P>
<P>
   As students made plans for a memorial service for Guy, friends
and associates at his Ames Street dormitory declined to speak to
reporters. Campus officials said they believe Guy's family had
arrived from California to make funeral arrangements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's difficult when someone so young dies,'' said Matthew
McGann, a senior management major and president of MIT's
Undergraduate Association. ``People want to grieve in peace.''
</P>
<P>
   McGann said MIT, mindful of the need to improve life away from
the classroom, has increased funding for student activities
three-fold over the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people here _ not by any means the majority _ who
are incredibly devoted to their academics and there are people in
the faculty going for the Nobel Prize, but that is a small
percentage of our population,'' McGann said.
</P>
<P>
   ``People want to have a well-rounded life, and students want to
be involved in things outside of the classroom and the
laboratory,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Seema Sanzgiri, a premed senior from New Orleans, called MIT's
curriculum challenging but not ``cut-throat competitive.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know a lot of people do feel a lot of stress here,''
Sanzgiri said. ``Coming from high school the transition is very
hard. MIT does a lot to ease that transition. I think what happered
(to Guy) was just an accident. I don't think it had to do with
academic pressures, especially since the year hasn't even started
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Guy's inhalation of a substance commonly used as a
anesthetic by dentists came a week before classes were to resume.
</P>
<P>
   Pure nitrous oxide dissolves in the bloodstream. It pushes
oxygen out from the blood into the lungs and deprives the brain and
other organs of oxygen.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Kruger, associate executive director of the
Washington-based National Association of Student Personnel
Administrators, said nitrous oxide is hardly the recreational drug
of choice on most college campuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most students don't know the toxicology of nitrous oxide,''
Kruger said. ``It's one of those invisible things that you don't
smell and can't see and it's very difficult to intervene if someone
is doing this quietly in his room.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, the MIT spokesman, said the death of Guy and the 1997
alcohol overdose of freshman Scott Krueger does not mean MIT has an
unusual problem with substance abuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had a couple of people overdose _ one on alcohol and one
on nitrous oxide,'' he said. ``I can't think of that as a
pattern.''

BARGAIN HUNTING LIFTS MAJOR MARKETS 
</HEADLINE>
  (th) 
 By ROBERT D. HERSHEY Jr.    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stocks finished higher Wednesday as bargain hunting
overshadowed interest-rate jitters in advance of fresh statistics
on the tight American job market.
</P>
<P>
   Halting a four-session skid that had lopped nearly 500 points
from last week's record level, the Dow Jones industrial average
gained 108.60 points, or 1 percent, to 10,937.88, paced by a 2
11/16-point jump in IBM which has benefited this week from new
contracts with Cisco Systems.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq market and the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index also
climbed. The Nasdaq market jumped 11.45 points, or 0.4 percent, to
2,750.80. It is now up 25.45 percent for the year. The S&AMP;P 500 rose
10.66 points, or 0.8 percent, to 1,331.07.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really hard to identify sustainable trends in a week like
this,'' said Timothy E. Woolston, a portfolio manager at Boston
Advisors. ``Everybody's waiting for the numbers.'' The job and
earnings report for August is to be published Friday, and on
Thursday the Labor Department is to report on last week's
first-time applications for unemployment insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Timothy E. O'Grady, senior portfolio manager at First Capital
Group in Philadelphia, said, ``Inflation is still a potential
issue, an item to contend with.''
</P>
<P>
   An initial belief that the Federal Reserve's Aug. 24
credit-tightening would be its final one of the year has been
seriously undermined, most recently by Tuesday's survey of
corporate buyers, who reported paying markedly higher prices last
month.
</P>
<P>
   Higher interest rates make stocks less competitive with bonds,
making corporate borrowing more expensive and, for some, more
difficult. Rates were narrowly mixed Wednesday, edging up for
longer-maturity bonds while money rates eased.
</P>
<P>
   Drug stocks and those of paper and forest products companies
made some of the day's biggest gains, the latter helped by an
upgrade at Paine Webber.
</P>
<P>
   International Paper, one of 23 Dow blue chips to advance, rose 1
9/16, to 48 5/8, while Willamette Industries was up 3 1/2, to 43
1/8, and Fort James, Westvaco, Champion and Weyerhaeuser each rose
more than a point. Georgia Pacific, now up 46 percent so far this
year, climbed 15/16, to 42 5/16.
</P>
<P>
   Among the drug makers, Warner-Lambert jumped 2 1/4, to 68 5/8,
and Merck, Bristol-Myers and Schering-Plough posted gains of more
than a point.
</P>
<P>
   Retailing stocks, beaten up of late, rebounded slightly in most
cases, though J.C. Penney surged 1 7/8, to 38 1/8, while Sears lost
5/16, to 37 3/16.
</P>
<P>
   AT&AMP;T was up 2 3/8, to 47 3/8, and General Electric was up 1 3/8,
to 113 11/16. Intel was another sizable gainer, up 1 1/4, to 83
7/16, after the company introduced a new line of networking chips.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Qualcomm, the cellular company, fell 23 1/2,
to 168 11/16, after an analyst at Everen Securities warned of an
earnings shortfall after meeting with management.
</P>
<P>
   Juniper Networks was another casualty, sliding 24 3/4, to 180
1/4, after registering 5.75 million shares for a secondary
offering, more than half from company officials.
</P>
<P>
   MMC Networks was battered for a second day, losing 4 1/8, to 26
3/4, on top of a 38 percent drop Tuesday after IBM said it would no
longer make products using MMC chips.
</P>
<P>
   Turnover on the New York Stock Exchange was 697.1 million, with
1,715 advancing issues and 1,288 declines. New 52-week lows swamped
new highs, however, 97 to 25.
</P>
<P>
   Major European markets closed about 0.5 percent to 1 percent
higher, but the best overseas gains were 2.1 percent in Tokyo and
3.2 percent in Sao Paulo, Brazil.

FOUNDER GAUT REGAINS CONTROL AT TROUBLED PICTURETEL CORP. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY ACKERMAN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   PictureTel Corp., once the world's premier maker of
videoconferencing equipment, is brining back one of its founders to
lead its battle against growing competition from Internet-based
technology and service providers.
</P>
<P>
   Norman E. Gaut, 61, who helped get PictureTel launched in 1984
and was chairman and chief executive for 10 years before retiring
last year, said he is resuming those titles ``until I get this
thing in shape.''
</P>
<P>
   He succeeds Bruce R. Bond, 53, a former America Online Inc.
executive who was hired in February 1998 in an effort to turn
around PictureTel's already sagging fortunes. Gaut called Bond's
resignation, submitted on Tuesday, ``a joint decision between the
board and him.'' Picturetel is located in Andover, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Gaut praised Bond, who had been with AT&AMP;T Corp. and US West, for
developing a strong recovery strategy, but said continuing declines
in both sales and earnings forced a change in command.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were not overly pleased with the way things were heading,''
said Gaut, who remained a member of PictureTel's board after his
retirement as chairman. ``We were not making any headway in
shareholder value, and there were product issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Those ``product issues'' included an ouburst of customer anger
last spring following shipment of PictureTel's newest
videoconferencing units. The product, named SwiftSite and produced
in a joint venture with Intel Corp., had so many hardware and
software bugs that they had to be recalled.
</P>
<P>
   ``Let's face it,'' Gaut said in a telephone interview, ``we blew
that. In the future we are only going to get products out that are
fully quality assured.''
</P>
<P>
   A SwiftSite upgrade came out in June and the company says it has
shipped 6,000 units _ but after a promotional discount to $4,000
per unit is making no profit on them.
</P>
<P>
   PictureTel shares that had traded as high as 43 1/8 in late 1995
and early 1996 have hovered between 5 and 6 for most of the past
year as red ink continued to mount. Following more than a decade of
profitability, PictureTel has been in black during only one of the
past nine quarters and predicts further losses this year.
</P>

   Analysts said the entire videoconferencing market faces an
uncertain future until such generic Internet operating issues as
bandwidth availability are resolved.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, rivals including Sony Corp. and Polycom Inc.
are taking advantage of cheap digital technology to produce
``set-top'' units that compete against SwiftSite and undercut the
costly top-of-the-market product line tha established PictureTel's
reputation during the 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   ``The low end is where the future of this business is,'' said
David Dines, an analyst for Aberdeen Group in Boston. ``PictureTel
leads at the high end, but I see few buyers.''
</P>
<P>
   Gaut said PictureTel's strategy recognizes this. The company
hopes to reestablish itself primarily as a service provider, making
and selling low-cost units but backing them up with broad bandwidth
network connections to ensure high-quality pictures.

INS CHIEF CALLS OPERATION RIO GRANDE `HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL' 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JAMES PINKERTON 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BROWNSVILLE, Texas _ The head of the U.S. Immigration and
Naturalization Service on Wednesday hailed the 2-year-old Operation
Rio Grande as a ``highly successful'' effort to reduce illegal
immigration and smuggling, and she pledged that the border
operation would not come at the expense of native habitat and
endangered wildcats.
</P>
<P>
   INS Commissioner Doris Meissner said that arrests of illegal
immigrants have dropped by 32 percent in South Texas and that crime
in Brownsville has fallen 19 percent since 1997. She said the next
step is to expand the operation to Laredo and Del Rio as immigrants
move upriver to avoid being caught.
</P>
<P>
   Meissner also tried to assuage the fears of environmentalists by
meeting privately with them for several hours.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the Rio Grande Valley chapters of the Sierra Club and
the Audubon Society, along with the Washington-based Defenders of
Wildlife, filed suit against the INS and other federal agencies,
claiming the Border Patrol was clearing brush and disrupting two
endangered cats, the ocelot and jaguarundi.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the important benefits of a well-managed border is the
return of native vegetation and wildlife to areas where illegal
entry has been curtailed,'' Meissner said at a news conference.
``I'm confident that legitimate environmental concerns can be
addressed in tandem with Operation Rio Grande and our commitment to
effective border enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm pleased to hear the commissioner actually, in very general
terms, addressed some of those issues,'' said Jim Chapman of the
Sierra Club. ``It's very clear that she's aware of them, and the
agency appears prepared to deal with them constructively. That's
really what we want, and we're disappointed it's taken them that
long to get to that point.''
</P>
<P>
   At issue is some of what Meissner called ``force-multiplying''
equipment the INS has brought to the border to assist patrol
agents, including 30 permanent and 186 portable banks of stadium
lights aimed along the river.
</P>
<P>
   Environmentalists complain that some tactics _ including use of
high-intensity lights and clearing of brush _ run counter to an
expensive and lengthy effort by the U.S. Interior Department to
assemble a wildlife corridor along the Rio Grande.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, lights don't catch smugglers, lights don't catch
bandits. It's agents that catch smugglers and bandits,'' Chapman
said. ``Some of the areas the Border Patrol is taking credit for
the decrease in the crime rate, border banditry and smuggling are
areas where there are yet no lights.''
</P>
<P>
   Similar to earlier Border Patrol containment strategies in El
Paso, Texas, and San Diego, agents assigned to Operation Rio Grande
hold highly visible positions on the river bank at short intervals
to discourage illegal immigrants from wading or swimming the
shallow river.
</P>
<P>
   In South Texas agents have cleared brush, installed boat ramps
for 10 river patrol boats, buried 1,048 electronic sensors along
the river banks and wheeled in 36 ``Skywatch'' towers with powerful
lights and night-vision equipment.
</P>
<P>
   But what was on the mind of many Border Patrol officers was
manpower.
</P>
<P>
   South Texas' ranking Border Patrol agent called Operation Rio
Grande ``a work in progress,'' explaining that while alien
smugglers have been slowed, they are still successful in moving
loads of clients north from the Rio Grande Valley.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, a lot of them are getting through us, because we are not
totally staffed,'' said Joe Garza, the Border Patrol's McAllen
sector chief. He said that even more agents are needed in spite of
the nearly threefold increase in his sector since he took command
in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have 91 miles of the border here, from the mouth of the
river to near Harlingen, that we feel are being properly managed.
We have 280 miles on the border (in the McAllen sector), so we have
about 90 miles controlled and probably another 190 to go,'' Garza
said.
</P>
<P>
   Since the Operation Rio Grande began in August 1997, personnel
at the McAllen sector has increased from 756 agents to 1,139.
Additional agents have posted at stations upriver in Laredo, Del
Rio and El Paso.
</P>
<P>
   But the INS has been criticized for failing to meet a 1996
federal mandate that called for hiring 1,000 new agents a year
through 2000.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unfortunately we are short of this goal,'' Meissner said. ``It
is not for lack of effort.''
</P>
<P>
   This year, INS would have to hire 2,000 new agents to meet the
requirement because it must also replace agents who have left, she
said, adding that the agency intends to focus hiring efforts on the
local area, where unemployment rates remain higher than most areas
of the country during an economic boom.

 &HT;    N.C. island sliced in two by Dennis
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Tropical Storm Dennis has stranded 5,000 people on
North Carolina's Hatteras Island, cut in half by pounding waves
that washed away a three-quarter mile section of N.C. 12.
</P>
<P>
   Another 700 people on Ocracoke Island, just south of Hatteras,
are cut off from food and water.
</P>
<P>
   In a symbolic blow to Hatteras, at North Carolina's eastern tip,
the National Park Service has canceled Saturday's plans to relight
the Cape Hatteras Lighthouse at Buxton.
</P>
<P>
   Relocated inland this summer from its perilous perch overlooking
the Atlantic, the historic beacon has survived Dennis, the National
Park Service said.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency crews have mobilized to ferry food, water and other
supplies to Hatteras. But as of Wednesday night, strong winds
prevented state ferry boats from making the 4 1/2-hour trip from
Manns Harbor across the Pamlico Sound to Hatteras Village, at the
island's southern tip.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are looking for a window for the wind to drop below 25
mph,'' said Donald Chapman, assistant director of the North
Carolina State Shipyard at Manns Harbor.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are starting to run low on food and supplies and the
like,'' Chapman said. ``They are without electricity and phones. It
is not life threatening, but it sure is inconvenient for them.''
</P>
<P>
   A Coast Guard helicopter airlifted a pregnant Hatteras Island
woman who went into labor Wednesday. Amber Simerly, 19, was
transported to Albemarle Hospital in Elizabeth City. The hospital
wouldn't release information about Simerly's condition.
</P>
<P>
   After pounding the North Carolina coast Monday, Dennis turned
out to sea and stalled. Tuesday, it began backtracking, lashing the
Outer Banks with gale-force winds and 14-foot waves.
</P>
<P>
   An estimated 5,000 residents and tourists stayed on Hatteras
Island after Sunday's evacuation order. They were stranded when
waves dumped sand, and in some places, washed out, the island's
two-lane highway.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, a National Guard convoy drove four-wheel-drive
vehicles down N.C. 12 and delivered supplies as far south as Avon.
</P>
<P>
   They were unable to travel farther because waves cut an
8-foot-deep breach between Avon and Buxton, at one of the island's
most narrow stretches.
</P>
<P>
   The sea had washed over the spot as recently as May, but crews
quickly reopened N.C. 12, the island's only north-south road.
</P>
<P>
   Dennis' damage is far more severe. ``One-half to three-quarters
of a mile of paved road has been cut off,'' National Park Service
spokesman Bob Woody said.
</P>
<P>
   Emergency crews' top priority is getting supplies to stranded
people, according to North Carolina's emergency response team. The
next step is getting the people off the island.
</P>
<P>
   ``The main thing is getting the road clear so we can get some
help to those people,'' said Sgt. Craig Garriss of the North
Carolina Highway Patrol. ``They're in dire need of help.''
</P>
<P>
   In Hatteras Village, ham radio reports indicated extensive
flooding had occurred.
</P>
<P>
   On Ocracoke Island, flooding was widespread and islanders
remained without power Wednesday. But ham radio operator Dale Mutro
said everyone seemed to be getting along all right.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just had a high tide just a little bit ago, and sound-side
flooding is still quite severe,'' Mutro said. ``But it's not as bad
as it was at the height of the storm. With every high tide, the
water's still way on up there.''
</P>
<P>
   National Hurricane Center forecasters said Dennis, once a
Category 2 hurricane, could be downgraded further, but likely would
linger near the North Carolina coast for days, moving to the
southwest without making landfall.
</P>
<P>
   The forecast is distressing to hotels, restaurants and other
northeastern North Carolina businesses counting on a big Labor Day
weekend.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is looking bad; everyone is canceling,'' said Jodi Sherman,
assistant manager of the ocean-front Best Western hotel in Kill
Devil Hills.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was going to be our last big opportunity to make some
money,'' she said, ``but Dennis the menace took it away.

SERB REFUGEES STRUGGLE AFTER BEING DRIVEN FROM KOSOVO 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   KURSUMLIJA, Yugoslavia _ Srbislav Bisercic, a competent, bluff
and imposing figure who always wore a pistol when he ran the
Podujevo municipal administration in Kosovo, is now a broken man,
ashamed to be in a jobless exile and hunting for a cheap apartment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, I'm depressed,'' he said. ``How could I not be? I left
everything down there, everything, my flat, my house, 20 acres of
land, my cattle, pigs and tractor.''
</P>
<P>
   Stopped on the street, Bisercic is all smiles at first, but his
mood quickly darkens, and at one point his eyes become red and wet.
</P>
<P>
   ``My biggest problem is being jobless, not having work,'' he
said. ``I get my salary, late like everyone else, but I don't know
what the state will do with us, since they haven't made it possible
for us to go back'' home to Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   Kursumlija, a southern Serbian town of 14,000 people just 15
miles north of Podujevo, is now struggling to host 7,000 displaced
Serbs from Kosovo, increasing the population by a half.
</P>
<P>
   With the school year starting, Serbs who had been living in
Kursumlija's schools are being moved to a tattered local cultural
center; thousands more live with host families or relatives or in
any apartment they can find.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eighty percent of Podujevo's Serbs are looking for a flat
here,'' Bisercic said. Most Kosovo Serbs are getting only 60
percent of their regular salaries from a state with a severe
shortage of cash, its industry smashed by NATO bombs and 10 years
of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone is depressed,'' said Milivoje Mihajlovic, a Serbian
journalist from Pristina whose parents now live here. ``My wife
says, `I dream every night, and my dreams are in Pristina.' And I'm
the same. I spent my whole life, 40 years there, and
psychologically that's the biggest problem. Everyone asks everyone
else, `When can we go back?'''
</P>
<P>
   Bisercic, humiliated and distraught, vows to return to Kosovo
soon. Mihajlovic knows better. ``It will take years, if ever, for
the pressure to go out of Kosovo,'' he said. ``Everyone needs to
calm down, the Serbs and the Albanians.'' And both need to find
less aggressive leaders, he conceded.
</P>
<P>
   According to Vesna Petkovic of the U.N. High Commissioner for
Refugees, by last Friday 133,737 displaced Serbs and Gypsies from
Kosovo were registered in Serbia, having left Kosovo since
February. But the agency estimates the true total was 173,000.
</P>
<P>
   In all of Yugoslavia, including Montenegro, 157,259 people were
registered as displaced, and the total was estimated at 196,500.
</P>
<P>
   With 500,000 to 700,000 other Serbs displaced from Bosnia and
Croatia, Yugoslavia has more refugees and displaced people than any
other country in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   The policies and nationalist wars of Yugoslav President Slobodan
Milosevic have been the prime source of the refugee burden, which
the U.N. refugee agency is working to relieve. This year, it will
spend some $60 million to help those in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   Mira Nikolic, deputy minister of the Yugoslav Ministry for
Refugees, Displaced Persons and Humanitarian Affairs, said in a
telephone interview that the refugees ``need almost everything:
food, shelter, beds, blankets, hygiene products _ it's better to
ask what don't they need.'' She said that the agency was providing
important help, but the biggest problem now would be fuel for
heating in the winter.
</P>
<P>
   Host families, with whom some 85 percent of the displaced are
living, cannot afford the burden, Ms. Nikolic said, so Belgrade is
looking more toward collective housing. The United Nations is ready
to help prepare buildings for the winter with construction
material, beds and heating fuel.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Nikolic and Ms. Petkovic agreed that Belgrade's policies had
softened toward the Kosovo Serbs. At the beginning, they were urged
to return immediately to Kosovo, and Belgrade refused to register
them or let them register their children in local schools. That has
changed, with nearly all students registered for school, but the
displaced are encouraged to live near Kosovo and are actively
discouraged from trying to settle in Belgrade, where they would be
more visible.
</P>
<P>
   Kursumlija is a pleasant but isolated town in the middle of an
agricultural area. There is one large company, Drvni Kombinat,
making wood products, but average salaries are only 200 dinars a
month, or $20 at the official rate of exchange. A beer at a cafe
costs 50 cents, a sixth of the price in Belgrade. Unlike in bigger
towns, there is no cellular telephone service.
</P>
<P>
   At the shops, people buy 200 grams, or 7 ounces, of meat at a
time. ``If you buy a kilo,'' or 2.2 pounds, Mihajlovic said, ``they
think you're a millionaire.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   If anything, the influx of Kosovo Serbs has pushed up prices a
little here, especially for housing, and because the new arrivals
are generally better educated they are often seen as a threat to
the jobs of the locals.
</P>
<P>
   In the small main square, surrounded by parking, there are many
cars with license plates indicating that they are from Pristina and
Podujevo and Pec and Prizren.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm lost,'' said Caslav Bojovic, 44, who was the principal of
a school for 367 children in Podujevo. ``I feel terrible. I don't
know who I am, where I'm going, what I'll do tomorrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are `temporarily dislocated people,''' he said bitterly,
``and no one cares very much for us, and there is no chance to go
back.''
</P>
<P>
   He shrugged. ``We all feel like this. Whatever I had was in my
work of 20 years, and it's gone. I was on good terms with my
Albanian neighbors. That hurts me, because my neighbors call me and
say I should not come back, and I know they are right.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he is angry that Kosovo's Albanians are driving out
Serbs, no matter the provocation by others, under the eyes of NATO.
``Why don't they indict Thaci as a war criminal?'' he demanded,
referring to Hashim Thaci, the leader of the Kosovo Liberation
Army.
</P>
<P>
   Bojovic is now looking for a building here to try to reopen his
school, and says the local authorities are open to the idea. ``I
can't leave the kids,'' he said. ``And we need to work.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the street, at the shabby Evropa Restaurant, the Kosovo
Serbs line up, shamefaced, for a free lunch organized by the local
Holy Trinity Church, with help from Belgrade and international
organizations like the World Food Program. A section of the
restaurant is set aside for the refugees, and Radovan Rajovic, the
chef, provides a balanced meal, usually a meat and vegetable stew
of some kind, salad and bread. Wednesday, the choice was paprikash,
a Hungarian-style veal stew that actually had chunks of veal.
</P>
<P>
   The restaurant serves 1,000 meals a day to the Kosovo Serbs in a
program that began Aug. 16, said Radoje Milanovic, the restaurant
manager.
</P>
<P>
   Registered refugees have cards that entitle them to the meal,
and their names are checked off. But 80 percent take the food away
with them, rather than sit and eat in a group, Milanovic said. As
they leave, their heads are down.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't come at first, but we have to eat,'' said a woman
in her 50s who asked to remain anonymous. ``Of course I'm
ashamed.''
</P>
<P>
   Bisercic, the Podujevo official, had insisted that he would stay
in Podujevo. But in the end, he left, on June 21, 11 days after
Yugoslav forces pulled out in long columns from the city, creating
a vacuum that NATO forces did not move in to fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those Serbs who stayed there are dead,'' Bisercic said. ``I
took three of the last out with me.'' U.N. officials in Kosovo
confirm that only three Serbs remain in all of Podujevo, women too
old and alone to leave.
</P>
<P>
   Bisercic faults NATO for the vacuum of power, but he also
considers it a mistake of the Belgrade government to allow one.
``They should not have signed anything until they filled the
territory with international forces,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But asked if he blamed Milosevic, Bisercic bristled, even more
upset. ``I voted for Milosevic,'' he said. ``Don't touch me
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Velisa Malevic, 37, was head of the Podujevo tax police. On the
square, wearing shorts and flip-flops and a two-day beard, he said
he and his mother and brother and their families _ 14 people _ had
all moved here, where his wife was born. There, they had two houses
and an apartment, with 10 acres. But the apartment has been taken
by Albanians and the two houses burned, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get a salary but I'm not working,'' Malevic said. ``That's
the worst thing.'' He said he dreamed about his life before. ``It's
the biggest wish in my life to go back.'' He laughed, then said
sardonically of Kosovo's new rulers, ``I believe in the United
Nations and the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   He, like the others, insists that the Albanians of Podujevo were
his finest friends and that he protected them as best he could.
``The KLA attacked the Serbs, and the Serbs defended themselves
with guns, and then NATO came and disarmed the Serbs but not the
Albanians, and that's the whole story,'' Malevic said.
</P>
<P>
   When told how ridiculous his version would seem to an Albanian
whose family was murdered by Serbs or who was driven out of Kosovo
by force, Malevic laughed bitterly. ``The Albanians are no
angels,'' he said. ``You in the West will find out soon enough.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sladjana, worked at the Fagar factory in Podujevo.
Here, she is back to being dependent on her father while trying to
care for three young children. ``I feel ashamed,'' she said. ``It's
very unpleasant.''
</P>
<P>
   She said the people from Kosovo were overwhelming the town.
``The people here are more kind to us, since I was born here,'' she
said. ``But they are very distant with the others.''
</P>
<P>
   She buried her nose in the hair of her son, Lazar, 4, named
after the prince who led the Serbs in the famous battle of Kosovo
in 1389. She lifted red eyes and said softly, ``We had everything,
and now it belongs to someone else.''

 &HT;    Smoky odor prompts return of AirTran flight
 &HT;    By Gary Hendricks
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ An AirTran Airways DC-9 with 76 passengers and five
crew members bound for Orlando, Fla., on Wednesday returned to
Hartsfield International Airport after members of the flight crew
said they smelled a smoky odor in the cockpit and cabin, the
airline said.
</P>
<P>
   No injuries were reported, and the passengers were put on a
later flight, according to AirTran spokeswoman Carla Maruskin.
``The oxygen masks never came down,'' Maruskin added.
</P>
<P>
   AirTran mechanics inspected the plane to see what may have
caused the smoky odor, but the tests were not complete late
Wednesday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   The plane, flight 357, had reached 4,000 feet after a 10:30 a.m.
departure when the captain said he smelled smoke, according to
AirTran Atlanta station director Curtis Barrett.
</P>
<P>
   A flight attendant also said she smelled smoke in the cabin. No
one saw any smoke, Maruskin said.
</P>
<P>
   The plane landed and parked on a taxiway. The passengers left
the aircraft by flight stairs and were shuttled back to Concourse C
to meet another plane. The passengers were on the tarmac and kept
in a secure area during the transfer, company officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Jackie White, who was traveling from Chicago for a visit to
Disney World, said she and her husband, nephew and two children
almost boarded the flight after arriving to change planes in
Atlanta. AirTran invited them to take the plane, although they were
booked on a later Orlando flight.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't because it made no sense to get to the airport ahead
of our luggage and have to wait on it to come on the later plane,''
White said.
</P>
<P>
   After hearing about what happened, she said, ``It made me very
nervous. But we have no choice but to go on.

<TEXT>
<P>
   PANAMA CITY, Panama _ Accusations by Justice Department
officials that the American Embassy undercut the department's
investigation into visa trafficking and alien smuggling by
high-ranking Panamanian officials are unfounded, according to
several U.S. officials close to the case. The reason, they say, is
simple: there was no investigation to disrupt.
</P>
<P>
   The officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said they
had no doubt that Panamanian visas were being sold to Chinese
immigrants using Panama as a back door to sneak into the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   But these officials said they had seen no hard evidence that
Panamanian officials did anything more than break the laws of their
own country. They said that a Justice Department investigation
could begin only if there were indications that the Panamanians
were helping the Chinese enter the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless it can be shown that they were involved in trafficking
people across the border, then they have not broken U.S. laws,''
one official said.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute has drawn the attention of Sen. Jesse Helms, R-N.C.,
the chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee. He sent a letter
on Aug. 26 to both the State and Justice departments asking when
the Justice Department began an investigation and inquiring about
its status.
</P>
<P>
   An aide to Helms was out of town and did not return a message
left at his office, but officials said that the departments had not
yet responded.
</P>
<P>
   Officials close to the case said that consular officials here
acted within their rights when they revoked the U.S. travel visa of
Samantha Smith, who was the head of Panamanian intelligence from
September 1998 to June of this year. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The decision to revoke her visa was made because of strong
suspicions that she was part of a ring that sold Panamanian visas
to Chinese immigrants who were looking to sneak into the United
States by land at the Mexican border.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Smith said she did approve some 140 suspect visas at the
request of President Ernesto Perez Balladares, whose term ended
Wednesday and whom she accused this week of selling the visas for
as much as $15,000 apiece to supplement his budget.
</P>
<P>
   State Department regulations and U.S. immigration law allow
consular officials to revoke visas if they suspect someone is
engaged in corruption.
</P>
<P>
   The revocation of Ms. Smith's visa drew the anger of officials
at the Justice Department, who said that the move had tipped off
the smuggling ring and severely damaged any chances of nabbing
senior Panamanian officials.
</P>
<P>
   But several officials familiar with the decision to revoke Ms.
Smith's visa said that Simon Ferro, the U.S. ambassador to Panama,
kept all the necessary agencies in Washington informed about his
actions and at no point was he warned off.
</P>
<P>
   After Ms. Smith's visa was revoked, Ferro attended a June 17
interagency meeting in Washington where he defended his actions to
Justice Department officials.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Ms. Smith has said she has yet to be contacted by
Justice Department investigators, although she said she was willing
to share with them what she knew about the scheme.
</P>
<P>
   She did say that at one meeting with Perez she asked him how he
was sure the Chinese immigrants were going to stay in Panama. ``He
told me to impede their exit,'' she said. ``But that is not one of
my functions. I can only collect information.''
</P>
<P>
   She added that she had informed CIA officers last December about
reports she had received of Chinese immigrants arriving at Tocumen
International Airport with false visas or no passports at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``How could I be in a smuggling ring?'' she said. ``If I was
involved in something like that, why would I tell them this?''

SOUTH KOREA PLANS HUGE CASH INFUSION FOR INSOLVENT SEOULBANK  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN:   Britain)   By SAMUEL LEN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEOUL, South Korea _ The South Korean government plans to
declare the ailing Seoulbank insolvent on Thursday before injecting
billions of dollars into it after talks to sell it to a foreign
bank broke down, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A representative of the government's financial watchdog agency,
the Financial Supervisory Commission, said officials planned to
request the cash infusion at a meeting on Thursday. The
representative did not specify an amount, but Seoulbank said it
expected to receive 4 trillion to 5 trillion won, or $3.4 billion
to $4.2 billion.
</P>
<P>
   HSBC Holdings PLC, the big British bank, withdrew its $900
million offer for a 70 percent stake in Seoulbank on Tuesday.
Regulators said the talks had broken down because of differences in
the assessment of Seoulbank's bad loans.
</P>
<P>
   South Korea made a pledge to the International Monetary Fund in
late 1997 to sell Seoulbank and another ailing institution, Korea
First Bank, to foreign buyers in exchange for a $57 billion bailout
loan. The sales of the two banks are considered litmus tests for
Seoul's willingness to open its financial market to foreign
investors and accept international expertise in a traditionally
closed industry.
</P>
<P>
   The government holds more than a 90 percent stake in both banks
after recapitalizing them early this year, injecting 1.5 trillion
won ($1.27 billion) into each bank. It agreed in December to sell a
51 percent stake in Korea First to Newbridge Capital Ltd. and then
agreed in February to sell the Seoulbank stake to HSBC.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts feared that the failure to sell Seoulbank had set a
negative precedent that would affect negotiations to sell Korea
First.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a possibility that the sales will not take place,''
said Kim Dae Sik, an economics professor at Chung Ang University.
He said potential buyers in the future would raise the same issues
in assessing nonperforming loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Negotiations take a lot of time, and that is what the current
administration does not have,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Kim said that although the government might feel it was losing
money by quickly selling both banks to foreign buyers, such
selloffs would raise foreign investor confidence and reduce South
Korea's financial burdens.
</P>
<P>
   But the government's decision to inject capital into Seoulbank
while holding on to Korea First may be what it wants _ to retain
the banks to foster corporate reforms.
</P>
<P>
   ``It takes coordination between banks and the government for
successful restructuring,'' said Chang H. Lee, a senior banking
analyst at Daiwa Securities. ``If Seoul and Korea First banks fall
into the hands of foreign investors, that coordination would be
difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   He added that an injection of 4.5 trillion won in public money
would be enough in the short run for the banks to assist in
corporate restructuring.
</P>
<P>
   However, as selloffs fail to materialize, the banks' equity
continues to be eaten up through write-offs of nonperforming loans,
further damaging foreign investor confidence, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pace of restructuring has slowed down more than I had
expected,'' said James Han, a bank analyst for Jardine Fleming
Securities.

AUDIT FINDS TEXAS AGENCY PUTTING $830 MILLION IN FEDERAL, STATE
FUNDING AT RISK 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By POLLY ROSS HUGHES 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ A troubled state agency has jeopardized hundreds
of millions of dollars through its lax oversight of locally run
welfare-to-work programs, according to a report released Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The state auditor's highly critical report on welfare reform
implementation at the Texas Workforce Commission comes as Texas
increasingly turns to private companies and faith-based groups to
perform government work.
</P>
<P>
   Gov. George W. Bush championed hiring local contractors to carry
out welfare-to-work programs _ such as job placement, counseling,
training and child care _ as part of the state's landmark welfare
reform legislation in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   The new audit, however, identifies up to $830 million in federal
and state funding that has been placed at risk because of the
state's inadequate oversight and monitoring of the way contracts
are awarded by 26 new local workforce development boards. Federal
funding is contingent on strict controls and accountability by the
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We do not agree that funds were at risk,'' said Texas
Workforce Commission spokesman Larry Jones. ``We are implementing
virtually all of their recommendations. There are still some
findings with which we do not agree.''
</P>
<P>
   In one instance, financial safeguards at the Texas Workforce
Commission itself were so weak that the agency awarded three
job-training contracts to a Dallas company that declared bankruptcy
just five months later, the auditor's report said.
</P>
<P>
   The company, Medical Assistance Program Advisors Inc., had
contracts to place welfare recipients into jobs in the San Angelo,
Texarkana and Amarillo areas, Jones explained.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that state workers did have to scramble to take over
the program when the company declared bankruptcy last January.
Jones added that private contractors now undergo more rigorous
checks of their financial viability before contracts are awarded.
</P>
<P>
   The state audit said that incident was just one of 13 directly
mishandled by the agency as it awarded local service contracts
under the federal Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, or TANF,
grant. The process ``did not ensure that it paid a fair price for
services or that the bidders were financially sound,'' according to
the report.
</P>
<P>
   Other findings in the audit conclude:
</P>
<P>
   _ The agency certified 16 local workforce boards to dole out
contracts before making certain they were financially ready to do
so.
</P>
<P>
   _ Up to $9.6 million in TANF funds were jeopardized in the 13
employment service contracts directly awarded by the agency.
</P>
<P>
   _ The agency's oversight is inadequate to identify all problems
and some problems are not adequately tracked or resolved when they
are discovered.
</P>
<P>
   _ The agency is not providing timely and responsive technical
assistance to the local boards.
</P>
<P>
   ``We appreciate the state auditor's work and recommendations on
how to strengthen these local boards,'' said Bush spokesman Ray
Sullivan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Texas is a leader in shifting workforce development to the
local level and these local boards are a relatively new phenomenon.
. .I think the Workforce Commission has gotten the message.''
</P>
<P>
   Patrick Bresette, who analyzes welfare policy at the Center for
Public Policy Priorities, said the findings come as no huge
surprise to those who have watched the agency's rocky past.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the Texas Workforce Commission has been criticized not
just in this audit but in other circles, budgeting circles, for
appearing not to have adequate methods for tracking and monitoring
these contracts,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   To be fair, however, he pointed out that the commission was
given the enormous task of merging incompatible accounting systems
and even work cultures as part of the state's sweeping welfare
overhaul.
</P>
<P>
   The Workforce Commission was created four years ago as the
federal government began giving states more control over the
welfare system. In turn, Bush championed creation of the new agency
to consolidate 28 programs scattered elsewhere and to oversee the
transfer of welfare programs to the local level.
</P>
<P>
   Labor unions have sharply attacked the Workforce Commission's
handling of programs that help the poor and the working poor,
especially as private contracting pushes state workers out of jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's fair to say at this point that it's an agency
that's been beset by trouble since its inception. I'm not saying
they have an easy job, but the facts are the facts,'' said Rick
Levy, a lawyer for the Texas AFL-CIO.
</P>
<P>
   While Jones said the Workforce Commission has successfully moved
51 percent of the welfare population off the roles since 1995, Levy
said it's clear they didn't all land in jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still don't have adequate information about where those
folks are going, how many of them are working,'' he said. ``The
total focus is the-numbers-off-welfare, but there is a lot more
towards building an economy in Texas that works for everybody than
just playing a numbers game.''

GOP WANTS CLINTON TO EXPLAIN CLEMENCY FOR PUERTO RICAN
NATIONALISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ind., Utah, Ill.)  (mk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Congressional Republicans stepped up pressure on
the administration Wednesday to explain President Clinton's offer
of clemency to 16 members of a violent Puerto Rican nationalist
group, subpoenaing White House and Justice Department records and
raising the likelihood of congressional hearings in the fall.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Clinton offered to reduce the sentences of 16
members of the Armed Forces of National Liberation, commonly known
by its Spanish initials, FALN, on the condition they renounce
violence. The group was involved in more than 100 bombings in the
United States during the 1970s and 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 FALN members were not linked to crimes involving deaths
or injuries, and the White House said Clinton considered their
sentences, in some cases more than 50 years in prison, to be out of
proportion to their crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, the House Committee on Government Reform issued
subpoenas to the White House and the Justice Department seeking all
records relating to the president's decision. The committee is also
considering holding hearings on the clemency offer when Congress
returns after Labor Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do what we hope is a short investigation to
find out why the president would be interested in pardoning 16
terrorists,'' said Mark Corallo, a spokesman for the committee
chairman, Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind. ``It should come as no shock that
people on both sides of the aisles are against this.''
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, chairman of the Senate Judiciary
Committee, sent a letter to Attorney General Janet Reno Wednesday
requesting Justice Department records from the case. In his letter,
Hatch said he was particularly concerned about a report in The New
York Times that a wide range of federal law-enforcement agencies
were opposed to commuting the sentences of the 16.
</P>
<P>
   Spokesmen for the White House and Justice Department would not
comment on the subpoenas. But a senior Justice Department official
said the department was likely to resist complying with the
subpoenas on the ground that pardons are the exclusive power of the
president, over which Congress has no say.
</P>
<P>
   The two committees' demands for records were part of a broader
wave of criticism and second-guessing about Clinton's clemency
offer coming from both parties on Capitol Hill this week.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Daniel Patrick Moynihan, D-N.Y., said through an aide
Wednesday that he opposed the clemency offer, but declined to
elaborate. And the state's junior Democratic senator, Charles
Schumer, usually a strong defender of the Clinton administration,
said he wanted to see the internal Justice Department report on the
clemency proposal before he took a position on it.
</P>
<P>
   At the request of Rep. Vito Fossella, R-N.Y., the House
Judiciary Committee is also considering holding hearings on the
clemency offer this fall.
</P>
<P>
   ``The question for us, given the level of resistance from
federal agencies to the clemency offer, is, why now?'' said Sam
Stratman, a spokesman for Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., the committee's
chairman. ``The White House has been very reserved in defending
itself on this decision, and it might be helpful to them and to us
for there to be a better explanation.''
</P>
<P>
   Many Republicans believe that Clinton made the clemency offer to
help his wife, Hillary Rodham Clinton, win support from New York's
large Puerto Rican community in her expected run for the Senate
from New York. Burton's subpoenas include a request to Mrs. Clinton
and her office for any records relating to the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Howard Wolfson, a spokesman for Mrs. Clinton's campaign, said
the first lady supports clemency provided the 16 renounce violence.
But he said she had ``no involvement whatsoever'' in the decision.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani of New York, Mrs. Clinton's likely
Republican opponent in the Senate race, has criticized Clinton's
offer to reduce the sentences.
</P>
<P>
   Under Clinton's proposal, 11 of the 16 FALN members would be
eligible for immediate release from prison, two would have to serve
more time before being eligible for release, and three others who
have already been released from prison would have fines reduced.
The 16 are still reviewing the offer.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of Clinton's clemency proposal to the FALN members,
supporters of Jonathan Jay Pollard, an American who spied for
Israel, have increased their lobbying efforts to get the
administration to commute his life sentence.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, a coalition of New York Jewish groups demonstrated
outside Mrs. Clinton's Manhattan campaign headquarters, asking her
to support Pollard's release. ``She can't lose on this, politically
or substantively,'' said state Assemblyman Dov Hikind, a Democrat
from Brooklyn. ``Her input could be decisive.''
</P>
<P>
   Wolfson said, ``She understands the importance of this case, and
has no further comment.''

MORE CHOICES, NOT NECESSARILY MORE INFORMATION OR COUNSELING
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not your mother's (or father's) birth control.
</P>
<P>
   It's not even the birth control you knew back in college.
</P>
<P>
   Like the Oldsmobile, birth control methods and trends have been
a-changing, and what you were doing to avoid pregnancy in the past
decade may not be what you want to be doing anymore. And although
the information is out there, you may not be aware of all your
options.
</P>
<P>
   The overall state of birth control in America? Pregnancy rates,
birth rates and abortion rates are dropping, and contraceptive use
is up. Condom use is way up: from 3.6 million users in 1982 to 7.9
million in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Norplant, Depo-Provera, female condoms and spermicidal film have
all been introduced this decade, and Planned Parenthood clinics in
Tarrant and Johnson counties have seen some increase in the number
of young women asking in particular for Depo-Provera _ the
prescription drug given by injection four times a year _ and
Norplant, the tiny hormone sticks that are implanted in a fan shape
in the upper arm to provide birth control for up to five years.
</P>
<P>
   Promoted as ``birth control you think about just four times a
year,'' Depo-Provero contains the hormone progestin to suppress
ovulation. Unlike most birth control pills, it does not contain any
estrogen and so does not pose any extra risk for longtime users who
smoke.
</P>
<P>
   When Depo-Provera is taken as scheduled, the failure rate is
exceptionally low _ 0.3 percent, compared with 5 percent for oral
contraceptives.
</P>
<P>
   Also available since the early 1970s _ but still relatively
unknown _ is emergency contraception to prevent pregnancy after
unprotected intercourse. Emergency contraception involves taking
specific high-dose combinations of a number of available birth
control pills within 72 hours of unprotected intercourse. It is
similar to taking RU-486, the ``morning after pill'' (which is
still not marketed in the United States). Emergency contraception
must be used immediately _ best within 12 hours, before
fertilization and implantation take place.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not contraception of the future; it's emergency
contraception, and it's now,'' says Jackie Bzostek, education
director for Planned Parenthood of North Texas.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the contraception of the future?
</P>
<P>
   Transdermal contraceptive patches that can be worn like
Band-Aids are expected by the end of 2000. And more than 100
experimental contraceptive methods _ including soft silicone
vaginal rings that release estrogen and progestin slowly over a
full month, biodegradable implants and ``frameless IUDs'' _ are all
being tested for women, along with contraceptive injections, nasal
sprays and implants for men.
</P>
<P>
   Vaccines to immunize women against pregnancy are also in the
future. The vaccines would stimulate the immune system to produce
antibodies that attack eggs or sperm. One targets a crucial type of
protein molecule found on the head of sperm.
</P>
<P>
   A reversible ``unisex'' contraception relies on a new group of
drugs known as ``gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonists'' and may
be appropriate for women and men. The targeted hormone triggers
ovulation and sperm development.
</P>
<P>
   The proliferation of these new contraception methods is meeting
a rising mulitigenerational demand for reliable options. In 1982,
about 30 million U.S. women were practicing contraception; the
number of contraceptive users grew to
</P>
<P>
   to almost 39 million in 1995. Most of the increase was in the
number of condom users, which rose in every age group. More than
two-thirds of those using the condom were relying on the condom
alone, but virtually all users of multiple contraceptives were
using the condom as one method.
</P>
<P>
   More young people are also choosing abstinence, and those who
choose to have sex are using contraceptives at first intercourse,
according to the latest figures from the Center for Health
Statistics.
</P>
<P>
   Data suggest that concern about HIV//AIDS and other sexually
transmitted diseases is the principal factor prompting these
trends.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the rise in the number of options _ and the rise in
consumer interest in reliable birth control _ recent surveys show
many women are still unaware of their choices _ especially the
long-acting, reversible choices such as Depo-Provera and Norplant.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of women pick a birth control method and stick with it
throughout their reproductive years,'' Bzostek says. ``That's a lot
of years. Needs change, situations change. Our needs at 21 are
different from our needs at 50.''
</P>
<P>
   In a survey released this summer by Pharmacia &AMP; Upjohn, the
pharmaceutical company that makes Depo-Provera, almost half the
women in the 30- to 49-year-old age group were unaware of any
long-acting birth control methods other than sterilization. Yet 87
percent of those surveyed said they do not plan to have more
children.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1999, the Alan Guttmacher Institute released data
showing that between 41 percent and 51 percent of pregnancies in
women over 35 were unintended. Approximately half the unintended
pregnancies were among women whose contraception failed, suggesting
inconsistent or incorrect use.

   Health experts say this needs to change.

   ``To this day, when women have access to all types of
information about their health, we need to make sure they are
constantly informed about their contraceptive options,'' says Dr.
Mary Jane Minkin, clinical professor of obstetrics and gynecology
at Yale University School of Medicine.
</P>
<P>
   A woman and her physician need to re-evaluate her contraceptive
needs periodically to ensure she has access to the best possible
contraceptive methods for her lifestyle, Minkin says. ``The fact
is, a woman rarely gets counseled more than once throughout her
reproductive life.''

<P>
   In a major test of how learning works at the level of nerve
cells, a scientist has created a smarter strain of mice by
manipulating a gene involved in memory formation. He believes his
work lays the basis for eventually doing the same in people,
whether in helping patients with memory deficits, counteracting the
loss of memory in older people, and even in making healthy
individuals smarter.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts, while praising the technical quality of the work,
see its first application as lying in treating patients with memory
deficits rather than in enhancing intelligence. Also, they say,
although there are reasons to believe mice and humans are similar
in this respect, the applicability of the work to people remains to
be established.
</P>
<P>
   The mice were created in an experiment designed to assess how
memories are formed in the mammalian brain. The animals performed
better than normal mice in six different tests, a strong indication
that the altered gene is indeed involved in learning and memory
formation.
</P>
<P>
   The finding, reported in Thursday's issue of Nature, also
explains why young animals learn better than older ones, because
the manipulated gene is one whose activity is known to fade with
age in mice, monkeys and probably people too.
</P>
<P>
   The smarter mice were created by a team of researchers led by
Dr. Joe Z. Tsien, a neurobiologist at Princeton University. Dr.
Eric R. Kandel, a leading brain expert at Columbia University,
praised the quality of Tsien's work, saying his new research
``seems really reliable and is very nicely done.''
</P>
<P>
   For scientists, the importance of Tsien's paper is that it goes
a considerable way toward proving a longstanding idea, known as
Hebbs rule, about how the brain forms the neural associations that
are the basis of memory. ``This paper takes a big step forward to
showing people had been on the right track,'' said Dr. Charles
Stevens, a neurobiologist at the Salk Institute.
</P>
<P>
   For others, the interest of Tsien's work lies in its possible
application to people. Though no one yet knows whether the same
manipulation would make people smarter, Tsien said, the DNA
sequence of the gene he manipulated is 98 percent identical in mice
and humans, suggesting that altering it by drugs or gene therapy
might also make people smarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is not a hypothetical question. It is time for people and
the public to begin to discuss these issues,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tsien's work builds on the work of many other biologists and
used known techniques for manipulating the genes of mice. The gene
that he and his team altered is one that makes part of a feature
known as the NMDA receptor. This structure is embedded in a nerve
cell's membrane and serves as a sort of biological antenna to pick
up signals from other nerve cells.
</P>
<P>
   In seeking to understand the basic mechanism of memory, the
forming of an association between two events, biologists have long
focused on the NMDA receptor because it needs two separate signals
to be triggered into action.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Tsien, then working in Tonegawa's laboratory,
created mice in which a gene for the NMDA receptor could be
deleted. The mice performed considerably less well on certain tests
but the experiment, while important, was not regarded as conclusive
because there are many ways of damaging the brain that make it
perform less well but are not specific to memory.
</P>
<P>
   Tsien then decided another approach would be more persuasive,
that of trying to enhance the function of the gene instead of
knocking it out.
</P>
<P>
   As it happens the NMDA receptor is composed of a variety of
subunits. One such component, known as the NR2B subunit, is common
in young animals while another kind, known as the NR2A subunit,
predominates later in life. The juvenile form of subunit produces a
much stronger effect in the nerve cell, and this is believed to be
the reason why younger animals learn more easily than older ones.
</P>
<P>
   Working with colleagues at MIT and at Washington University, St.
Louis, Tsien created strains of mice that have extra copies of the
gene that specifies the NR2B subunit. He also inserted a DNA
sequence just in front of the extra genes that causes them to be
active only in the appropriate tissues, notably the forebrain and
the hippocampus, a brain module associated with spatial and other
kinds of memory.
</P>
<P>
   Having generated these genetically altered mice, Tsien's team
first dissected out neurons from the hippocampus and showed that
the electrical change to be expected from having extra copies of
the NR2B subunit was indeed taking place.
</P>
<P>
   The biologists then performed six different types of standard
learning tests on the mice which exercised different association
areas of the brain. One test required remembering the location of a
submerged platform hidden in milky water, another the ability to
dissociate a sound from shock when the shock was no longer given.
</P>
<P>
   In all these tests the genetically engineered mice performed
consistently better than normal mice, giving Tsien his basis for
believing the animals have enhanced intelligence as well as better
memory.
</P>
<P>
   Kandel notes that Tsien was not restoring the learning ability
of old mice but doing something even more interesting, that of
enhancing the natural abilities of young mice. The experiment thus
raises the question of ``whether intelligence is optimized by the
brain or could you push it even further. That you can improve a
young animal's performance is interesting,'' Kandel said.
</P>
<P>
   Tsien has named the new strain of mice Doogie after the
precocious character in the television show ``Doogie Howser, MD.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   His experiment brings home the fact that the blueprint for the
brain is written in the genes and that, probably well before
society is ready to assess the full implications, biologists now
stand on the threshold of being able to change fundamental aspects
of the brain's architecture. ``Our results suggest that genetic
enhancement of mental and cognitive attributes such as intelligence
and memory in mammals is feasible,'' Tsien and colleagues declare
in their Nature article.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts do not disagree with this assessment but put
greater emphasis on the complications that lie ahead. ``One has to
move with great caution and the realization that these are very
complicated processes,'' Kandel said. ``Our understanding of memory
processes is quite shallow _ this is the beginning of the
beginning. What the bad consequences or limitations are we don't
really understand. But by and large the thinking is probably on the
right track.''
</P>
<P>
   In principle, human intelligence could be enhanced by altering
people's genes, when reliable methods of gene therapy are
developed, or more simply by developing drugs that would change the
activity of the memory association gene, Tsien said.
</P>
<P>
   But none of these possibilities could be explored, in his view,
without wide public discussion and the establishment of guidelines.
</P>
<P>
   A more reserved approach was taken by Kandel, who said the first
applications of Tsien's work should be in the medical context of
helping those with memory deficits. Kandel described as
``neurobiological cosmetics'' the notion of enhancing normal
intelligence, and also emphasized that intelligence was far from
being the only mental attribute of importance.
</P>
<P>
   Enhancing human intelligence, Kandel said, ``is a very slippery
turf from a moral point of view. It's one thing to improve memory
in people with a memory deficit. But to begin to mess around with
normal memory is tricky. I don't think we want to emphasize in
society that intelligence is the only factor that counts, because
whatever allows someone to be creative and effective is probably
not determined by the activity of the NMDA receptor in the
hippocampus alone,'' he said, referring to nerve cell receptor
altered by Tsien.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't want to come across with some simplistic view that
`Take this pill' and we could produce a superior race,'' Kandel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Psychologists agree that both genetics and a person's
environment are important in shaping intelligence. But they differ,
often in politically polarized ways, on the relative importance of
each.
</P>
<P>
   Like Kandel, other brain biologists noted the problems in
applying Tsien's work to people. Dr. Timothy Tully, a biologist at
the Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory who has genetically enhanced the
memory of fruit flies, said the altered receptor unit was a
reasonable target for new drugs but that these could fail to
enhance human intelligence for many reasons. ``Maybe the juvenile
brain needs to be maximally plastic but as the animal matures you
don't want the brain to be so plastic,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Nature might have deliberately arranged the tapering off of
learning ability with age, said Stevens of the Salk Institute, so
as to prevent the brain's memory capacity from becoming overloaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It may be that learning things too well is bad. We could be
stuck learning things we didn't want to learn and our hard disks
would be full of too much information,'' he said. The difficulty
that older people have in recalling things may be due in part to
the complexity of accessing an increasing store of information, he
suggested.
</P>
<P>
   Tsien, however, is skeptical of the natural wisdom argument,
noting that nature does many things that are not in the
individual's best interest, such as letting people's bodies run
down and die. He believes that improving people's intelligence,
whether by drugs or genetic alteration, could have profound effects
throughout society.
</P>
<P>
   ``Civilization is based on our extraordinary human intelligence.
That is why our society evolves and civilization evolves, and if
there is a way to enhance intelligence then it may not be
surprising to see a change in the evolution of society,'' he said.

FROM SEA TO (NOT SO) SHINING SEA
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RICH MARTIN  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For some, nature is a proving ground. Others see
it as a sacred place with special powers than can help us regain
perspective and passion.
</P>
<P>
   Using nature's mirror for reflection into the inner world is an
old and noble genre. Henry David Thoreau wrote brilliantly on the
simple, rustic life in ``Walden''; more recently, Aldo Leopold's
``Sand County Almanac'' is a classic in conservation and seasonal
reflection.
</P>
<P>
   But it can be tricky play, often turning into self-conscious
pontificating and self-absorbed navel-gazing.
</P>
<P>
   Two books reveal the contrasts: ``A Year by the Sea'' would
appear to be headed toward shallow New Age cliches yet is enriched
by mature wisdom and some fine description of the natural world,
while ``Eye on the Sea'' is composed of poorly connected essays and
weak writing. The like-titled books are written by Massachusetts
authors, but that's where the similarities end. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``A Year by the Sea: Thoughts of an Unfinished Woman'' by Joan
Anderson (Doubleday; $22.95) is a memoir about a woman who slows
life's pace by living alone in a Cape Cod cottage. She refuses to
accompany her husband to an out-of-state job and seeks to renew her
love for life.
</P>
<P>
   Though it starts like it might turn into a Lifetime network
victim-of-the-week story, the title by a veteran journalist is
strongly evocative: ``Gently lured by the sea's distant roar, I
begin to stroll to her music. . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Anderson's use of natural metaphors to describe her inner state
_ though sometimes strained by overreaching _ is often poetic:
``The frothy white caps appear as a ruffled chorus dancing across
the surface of the sea, spitting, hissing, kicking all the way,
acting very much like the woman I'm becoming, not content unless
I'm tickling the rocks, slivering up the shore, embracing
everything in sight.''
</P>
<P>
   A simple existence by the breakers helps her recover her
moorings. Anderson's strong description moves the 196-page book
well beyond familiar territory.
</P>
<P>
   Some may be put off by the flowery style, while others might not
like the almost embarrassingly personal narrative. But it seems to
work well for the genre.
</P>
<P>
   Nature lovers will enjoy the description of how swimming among
seals and staying overnight on an island alone rejuvenated a tired
soul. Our rating: HHH &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, it's hard to see how anyone could find much
value in ``Eye on the Sea: Reflections on the Boating Life'' by
Mary Jane Hayes (Breakaway Books; $22).
</P>
<P>
   Hayes is trying to be poetic and ends up being vague. She aims
for wisdom but achieves pedantry. Worst of all, the writing is
clumsy, like a landlubber on a sailboat for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The Hanover, Mass., author writes, ``(A boat's) vulnerable
condition and attitude focused for me a human and very moving
truth: that boats _ beneath their infinite variety _ are but one
(and one of the most versatile and inspiring) of the outward
expressions of the spirit of man: and in particular his courage,
his curiosity and ingenuity, his desire to be challenged.'' She's
way off-course there _ and in many spots elsewhere _ in the
188-page book.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the problem is with organization. The title was poorly
conceptualized _ each chapter is wayward.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes' writing lacks concrete details that give a sense of the
moment _ there are few good descriptions. Cliches prove weak
substitutes: ``Maine is as much a state of being as it is a
place.''
</P>
<P>
   The state of Hayes' style is insufficient. Nature writing should
be rich in description and vision; this lacks either. Our rating:
(zap)H &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Guidebooks don't have to be complicated, daunting or lengthy. The
best often are deceptively simple. They should be like gifted
teachers, explaining so clearly students are not left in a fog.
</P>
<P>
   Derek C. Hutchinson, a resident of South Shields on the
northeast coast of England, efficiently and crisply proves his
expertise in ``The Basic Book of Sea Kayaking'' (Globe Pequot
Press; $7.95).
</P>
<P>
   Introductory chapters focus on equipment and include such
elementary tips as ``dress for immersion'' and ``don't paddle
alone.'' More difficult tasks are added later on: How to load the
kayak, how to embark and disembark, how to lift and carry the boat
and how to recover after falling out of the vessel.
</P>
<P>
   One of the best elements is the full-color illustrations. They
are especially helpful for capsize drills and addressing the
deepest fear many kayakers have _ getting caught upside down. The
A-B-C description and drawings are just what beginners need to
overcome the apprehension.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson, often writing with the touch of a feathery paddling
stroke, has explained the fundamentals of the recreation in just 78
pages. The title might well be an ideal complement to prepare tyros
for their maiden voyages. Our rating: HHH{ &QL;

In the future, anyone can be a television star or a published
novelist. And the future is a lot closer than you think.
</P>
<P>
   Two companies _ one public and sitting squarely in Silicon
Valley, and one private and based in lower Manhattan _ are out to
turn traditional media models upside down.
</P>
<P>
   The firms are Fatbrain.com and Pseudo Programs. Mountain View's
Fatbrain this week unveiled an online way for authors of everything
from magazine articles to technical manuals to weighty literary
novels to get their work published and distributed with ease _ and
with 50 percent royalties.
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo, the New York company, is running an Internet
``television network'' with an impressive 70 hours of original
programming a week.
</P>
<P>
   The two companies are out to prove the transformative nature of
the Internet. It won't be easy. Competition is fierce. Established
media giants will want to squash them or own them. And there's no
guarantee that the consumer mass market will even buy into their
concepts of catering to individuals.
</P>
<P>
   Consider Fatbrain. The company is not content merely to sell
professional and technical books online, Amazon-style. This week,
it unveiled eMatter, the concept it hopes will revolutionize
publishing.
</P>
<P>
   Using eMatter, any author can post a work of any style or length
for sale on the Fatbrain site. The author pays Fatbrain $1 a month
for the service and then splits the sales with the company 50-50,
much more than authors' typical 5 percent royalties.
</P>
<P>
   People can read what they want, how they want to: Short pieces
can stay on the screen, 10-page essays can be printed out, and
Fatbrain can send books to the printing press (with additional
costs for binding, artwork and hard covers). Already, said Fatbrain
President and CEO Chris MacAskill, ``About 10.8 percent of our
sales, we print and bind and send them out.''
</P>
<P>
   How does this change the world? Many ways, MacAskill says:
</P>
<P>
   _It lets authors publish works that otherwise had no forum.
</P>
<P>
   _It solves inventory problems for publishers. (And Fatbrain has
signed up such publishers as Macmillan USA, McGraw-Hill, O'Reilly
and Associates, the Motley Fool, Salon.com and the Coriolis Group.)
</P>
<P>
   _Works never have to go out of print; they can sit at Fatbrain
until someone wants to buy them.
</P>
<P>
   _Authors can update or alter their works any time, and readers
can buy only the chapter they need.
</P>
<P>
   Authors can start posting to Fatbrain now, and the first items
go on sale October 15.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street responded enthusiastically. The stock soared 60
percent Tuesday alone, before it slid back yesterday. It posted an
18 percent drop, closing down $4.38, at $19.69 _ still double its
opening price in January.
</P>
<P>
   But some on the Street see hurdles. Analyst Randall Roth at
Renaissance Capital in Greenwich, Conn., said shorter articles are
hard to sell because ``it's just a hassle. People don't want to
have chapters of books for $2 charges on their credit cards.''
</P>
<P>
   Longer works will face serious competition, as print-on-demand
grows in popularity and becomes an option offered at big companies
like Barnesandnoble.com and Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Likewise, Pseudo Programs CEO Larry Lux _ who visited San
Francisco last week _ must solve some fundamental problems, such
as: Who wants to watch television while sitting at their computer?
</P>
<P>
   Well, the site (www.pseudo.com) already boasts 700,000 unique
visitors a month, and that's before it's done any real promotion.
</P>
<P>
   Pseudo offers nine ``channels'' and 55 shows, with topics
including professional wrestling (``And Justice for Brawl''),
computer games and hip-hop music.
</P>
<P>
   It's sort of a cable access meets the Web. It's cheap to produce
and distribute. Anyone with passion can be a host. Why tilt at
windmills, trying to sell a program to a network or put a new cable
channel on an already crowded lineup, when you can go online for
microbucks?
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the business of cranking out content and delivering
highly segmented audiences to advertisers,'' Lux said. ``It's much
simpler and more cost-effective to do it through the Internet.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It amazes me,'' Lux said. ``It's such a departure from
traditional media.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SOMETHING SONY: Sony Electronics last month showed off Sony Style,
a splashy magazine produced by Time Inc. Custom Publishing, the
folks who produce a similar publication for Starbucks named Joe.
</P>
<P>
   Sony actually is charging money for the magazine _ $5.95 _ and
sells full-page color ads for $7,500. The premier issue features
ads from the Gap, eBay, Altoids and Yahoo, among others, but not
from Sony.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps that's not so strange when you consider all the Sony
plugs in the editorial copy. The magazine contains articles about
Sony's new San Francisco playland, Metreon; about Sony's robotic
dog; about how Hollywood filmmakers use Sony digital cameras; and
about how designers made Sony's sleek laptop, the Vaio.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SLIPPERY SLATE: Could shifting winds in Redmond, Wash., be bad news
for Slate?
</P>
<P>
   After all, Slate is Microsoft Corp.'s online magazine, and tea
leaf readers see the software giant bailing out on its media
efforts.
</P>
<P>
   If that's true, Michael Kinsley _ Slate's editor _ doesn't show
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have no reason to expect anything cataclysmic is on the
way,'' Kinsley said.
</P>
<P>
   Ominous signs include Microsoft's sale in July of its Sidewalk
city guides and the hiring _ widely reported, but still not
formally announced _ of former Silicon Graphics chief executive
Richard Belluzzo to run its Internet operations.
</P>
<P>
   Will boss Belluzzo move the company more into e-commerce and
away from low-margin content? ``Everybody here is curious about
what's going to happen, what a new guy is going to do,'' Kinsley
said. ``We've been given very positive encouragement.''
</P>
<P>
   Kinsley is irked at pundits asking, ```What about Slate?' as if
they know something,'' he said. ``If they know something, they know
something I don't know.''

DREAM TEAM TIME: In 1995, former San Francisco Examiner columnist
Bill Mandel, now working in high-tech PR, wrote a memorable story
in SF Weekly called ``The Dream Team.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, he posited that a combined San Francisco daily newspaper
could achieve greatness by pulling together the most talented
writers from The Chronicle and Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Mandel says that scenario now appears likely to play out. Hearst
Corp., the owner of the Examiner, has bought The San Francisco
Chronicle and says it is seeking a buyer for the Examiner.
</P>
<P>
   Mandel scoffed at the notion of Hearst inviting competition,
predicting that his ex-employer soon will merge with The Chronicle.
He said, ``Hearst is looking for a buyer for the Examiner like O.J.
is looking for the real killers.''

 &HT;    Monica packs up troubles in a bold knit bag
 &HT;    By Staci Sturrock
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ Monica Lewinsky is bagging it all.
</P>
<P>
   In an attempt to make a silk purse out of her sow's ear of a
professional life, the former White House intern has launched her
own line of purses and totes on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Her latest incarnation as fashion designer began when she
learned to knit in the aftermath of her affair with President
Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I survived the frustrating stages of dropping every other
stitch, it became a new form of relaxation,'' she explains on her
Web site: www.TheRealMonicaInc.com. ``However, I lacked a
fundamental tool essential to every knitter _ the knitting bag.''
</P>
<P>
   Unable to find a bag that she liked, the plucky 25-year-old
decided to sew her own. ``I began designing bags using beautiful
and exquisite materials, and I tried to make unique and artistic
combinations.''
</P>
<P>
   Combinations such as black velvet, crimson velvet, faux-fur
leopard print and black-and-rose brocade _ all in one handbag! Each
purse and tote also features a flowery tag that reads, ``Made
especially for you by Monica.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight bags range in price from $70 to $130.
</P>
<P>
   (All bags, incidentally, are dry clean only.)

<P>
   &UR; Apple Macs Now Have Chops to Play MP3 &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &QL; 
Q: My Windows-using buddies are heavily into MP3 music from the
Web, and they've been busting my chops because they claim the Mac
can't do MP3. Can that really be true? I looked at the feature on
MP3 in The Chron's Datebook section a few weeks ago, but I didn't
find anything about the Mac.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
A: Good news: Your buddies are all wet. Or at least behind the
times. Until a few months back, there really wasn't much support
for MP3, currently the most common format for downloadable digital
music, on the Mac _ not because Apple's hardware couldn't handle
it, but simply because the required software wasn't available.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, all that has changed, and now, there's a plethora of MP3
programs for the Mac. For starters, Apple's QuickTime 4, available
free at www.apple.com/quicktime, can play back most MP3 files.
</P>
<P>
   Pay attention when installing, though: By default, the installer
proposes a ``minimum'' setup, and if you just say OK to that, you
won't get the files needed to play MP3. Instead, choose a ``full''
or (if you really know what you're doing) custom installation.
</P>
<P>
   If you want a snazzier player and especially if you want to
create your own MP3 files from your CDs, you'll need to go beyond
QuickTime.
</P>
<P>
   Among the many third-party programs that have cropped up
recently, the most polished and professional is Casady &AMP; Green's
SoundJam MP; you can download a seven-day demo for free or the full
program for $39.99 at www.soundjam.com, or buy the packaged version
($49.99 list, including a stereo cable) from a retail or catalog
outlet.
</P>
<P>
   Other contenders include MacAMP ($25) and MacAMP Lite ($10),
available at www.macamp.net, and Xing Technology's AudioCatalyst
($29.95) at www.xingtech.com.
</P>
<P>
   There's one area where the Mac continues to lag: You need a PC
to load music onto the leading first-generation MP3 portable
players, such as the popular Rio from RioPort (formerly Diamond
Multimedia) and the Nomad from Creative Labs.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, that soon will change, too: The Rio 500, a new
version due any day now, will work with any Mac that has USB ports,
notably the iMac, the upcoming iBook and the blue-and-white Power
Mac G3s.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; Reading Mac Disks on PC &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Q: Is there any way I can set up my PC at work to read floppies
I bring in from my home Mac?
</P>
<P>
   A: Sure, but Windows by itself won't do the trick _ you'll have
to install Asome special software on your PC. I use a program
called MacDrive 98 from Media4 Productions (about $65, available at
www.media4.com or at some stores and catalog outlets).
</P>
<P>
   But there are lots of other options, including a free program
called HFVExplorer. For a complete rundown, look at
www.macwindows.com/disks2.html, part of a Web site devoted to
facilitating peaceful coexistence between Macs and PCs.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
Navigating Memory
</P>
<P>
   Q: How much memory should I allocate to Netscape Navigator? I
crash a lot when I run it at a little more than minimum.
</P>
<P>
   A: The more memory you can allocate to Netscape (within reason),
the faster it'll run and the less it'll crash. Same goes for
Internet Explorer.
</P>
<P>
   It sounds as if you've reduced Netscape's ``preferred'' RAM
settings below the original setting (``4,000 K'' for Navigator
4.08). As you're discovering, that's living dangerously. Your
system will be much more stable if you give it (and just about any
other application you use) at least as much memory as the
developers wanted when they set the original ``preferred'' values.
That's especially true if you use plug-ins that let you enjoy
QuickTime, Shockwave and other multimedia formats from your
browser.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, I generally increase the preferred allocation for
all my applications by at least 50 percent above the default
amount. You may not be able to keep as many programs open at once,
but to me, increased stability and speed are well worth that price.
</P>
<P>
   To modify an application's preferred memory allocation, first
make sure the program isn't running. Then go to the folder where
you keep it, highlight (single-click) its icon and choose Get Info
from the File menu.
</P>
<P>
   A small panel with information about the program will open. If
you're running Mac OS 8.5 or 8.6, click on the pop-up menu labeled
General Information, select Memory and change the number in the
Preferred box; if you have an older version of the Mac OS, you'll
immediately see the Preferred box.
</P>
<P>
   I'll catch hell from some Mac enthusiasts for saying this, but
memory management is one area where Windows is more user friendly
than the current Mac OS. Microsoft's OS dynamically allocates the
available memory among open programs, so users don't have to bother
with such arcane details. Fortunately, Mac OS X, a major new
version due early next year, finally should fix this problem.

FIGHTING THE TRAPPINGS OF THE PRESIDENCY ON A SENATE RUN 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   SENECA FALLS, N.Y. _ As a likely Senate candidate, Hillary
Rodham Clinton set the agenda for Wednesday's activities with her
husband. They visited sites that honored women's rights, the kind
of place any woman running for the Senate would want to log on her
campaign itinerary.
</P>
<P>
   But as first lady, Hillary Rodham Clinton spent the day trapped
in the bubble that inevitably envelops a president and his family
as they travel among the people. No matter how close to the voters
she wanted to get, there was always the barrier of security and the
frenzy that distorted what should have been a routine day of
campaigning for office.
</P>
<P>
   The third day of a quasi-vacation, quasi-campaign visit to New
York's Finger Lake region illustrated the dual nature of the first
lady's unprecedented (and all-but announced) pursuit of her own
political office, especially as she tried to do it with her
husband.
</P>
<P>
   With a president in tow, Mrs. Clinton benefited from even bigger
crowds and the attention of the national media. Every word and even
the most minor action was noted, down to her declining of whipped
cream for her French vanilla decaf this morning.
</P>
<P>
   But as the spouse of a president, she found herself inside a
14-car motorcade and presidential-level security.
</P>
<P>
   This in turn seems to have prompted an extra effort by the
Clintons to seem like a normal vacationing family. It has helped
that they shed the black limousine that normally ferries them
around and are traveling instead in a Suburban van, which they
usually do on vacation. This has become the standard mode of
transportation among politicians in New York, including Mayor
Rudolph Giuliani, the Republican who is likely to run against Mrs.
Clinton for the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton billed Wednesday's outing, to four historic
sites across the region, somewhat quaintly as an ``excursion,'' a
neutral-sounding, stately tour befitting a first family. But it
clearly carried a political energy that Mrs. Clinton needs to
harness as she reaches out to voters in this largely Republican
territory. (She plans two fund-raising events for Thursday.)
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Clinton's dual pursuits have led to some confusion over who
is in charge of the unwieldy press corps that has sprung up here.
It is divided between those who permanently cover the White House
and those covering Mrs. Clinton's candidacy. The president is
traditionally followed by a small pool of reporters. Now, a pool is
developing to keep track of Mrs. Clinton as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something we're going to have to watch unfold,'' said
Marsha Berry, the spokeswoman for the first lady's office,
reflecting on Mrs. Clinton's metamorphosis into a candidate.
``She'll be making the decisions as she goes along.''
</P>
<P>
   In other words, no one really knows how to do this _ and that
includes the president. Inside the Women's Rights National Historic
Park here in Seneca Falls, Mrs. Clinton chatted with visitors and
eagerly explored the site while her husband wandered off by
himself, first to the bathroom, then to browse in the bookstore.
</P>
<P>
   The crowds here have been overwhelmingly supportive and
positive, but curious too. As they waited outside the historic park
here, Eric Aaron and Curtis Quinn, both 17, mulled the Clintons'
relationship. ``Ever since the scandal, all the power has shifted
to her,'' Aaron mused.

 Voice over DSL could provide high-speed Net access, multiple  phone
numbers over a single wire 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By Deborah Solomon &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Copyright 1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QL;  &LR; 
 &UR;  &QL;  &LR; 
 &QL; 
Households and small businesses that need lots of phone lines for
Internet service, fax machines and talkative teens may soon have a
cheaper alternative than buying these services a la carte.
</P>
<P>
   Several Bay Area companies are testing a technology called voice
over DSL, which will let customers get a high-speed Internet
connection and up to 16 telephone lines over a single copper wire.
</P>
<P>
   DSL, short for digital subscriber line, uses a portion of the
same copper wire that carries telephone service to also provide
Internet access that is up to 50 times faster than a dial-up modem.
DSL is ``always on,'' meaning users don't have to dial their
Internet service provider each time they want to check out a Web
site.
</P>
<P>
   DSL, which costs about $50 per month plus a setup fee, is
gaining popularity among Internet users, but right now it only
carries data.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology will split the DSL portion of the wire into
multiple channels, so it can carry voice and data at the same time.
</P>
<P>
   Bay Area companies such as Santa Clara's CopperCom, Sunnyvale's
TollBridge Technologies and Jetstream of Los Gatos are among those
making voice over DSL equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one of the applications that will help DSL take that
next step and become more widely used,'' said Charles Carr, an
analyst with Dataquest.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, when a household or small business wants to add a
second or third phone number, a technician must come out and may
need to install additional wiring. Extra residential phone lines
cost $11.25 per month each, plus monthly taxes and installation
charges.
</P>
<P>
   With the new technology, companies don't have to put in
additional wires. As a result, DSL providers can instantly provide
additional phone numbers and are expected to charge less than
Pacific Bell for additional lines, although no prices have yet been
set.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you can use one wire to carry high-speed Internet access
and layer on 16 phone lines on top of that, the savings can be
significant,'' said Cynthia Ringo, CEO of CopperCom.
</P>
<P>
   Voice over DSL could be especially attractive for small
businesses, which typically pay more for additional phone lines
than either residential customers or big businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, small businesses tend to pay more for their voice
lines and there's probably a bit more profit margin to be made in
that arena, especially with packages of multiple lines,'' said
Jeannette Noyes, who tracks the DSL market for International Data
Corp.
</P>
<P>
   It could also be a bargain for households that want separate
phone lines for each family member, a phone and a fax for a home
office and fast Internet connections for everyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the residential market, certainly there are households with
four or more telephone lines that would be interested in this
service,'' Noyes said.
</P>
<P>
   As more carriers offer voice over DSL, the price will continue
to fall, which could pressure Pacific Bell to lower its prices for
second phone lines as well.
</P>
<P>
   However, there is a downside. Since the wire carrying DSL is
shared by both voice and data, Internet speeds decline as more
telephone lines are in use.
</P>
<P>
   But the companies developing voice over DSL say the degradation
of the line is not significant and that even when multiple phone
numbers are in use, most users will still be able to access the
Internet at 128 kilobits per second. That's more than twice as fast
about 20 times faster than a  &LR; asstandard 56 kbps dial-up modem.
</P>
<P>
   So far, the voice quality of voice over DSL seems comparable to
a traditional phone line, according to industry watchers. DSL can
also support services such as call waiting, caller ID and call
forwarding.
</P>
<P>
   But the new technology has the same limitation as regular DSL
service: Users must be within three miles of a phone company's
central switching office, because the farther the DSL signal
travels, the more it degrades.
</P>
<P>
   Consumers probably won't get access to voice over DSL for at
least a year, but business customers can expect to see it in
mid-2000. Customers who already have DSL will be able to add the
voice over technology to their existing service.
</P>
<P>
   DSL providers are still testing the technology to make sure it
can withstand heavy use. Small businesses are accustomed to
temporary glitches in Internet service but will not tolerate an
interruption in phone service.
</P>
<P>
   ``The equipment that allows us to do this technology is still
relatively new ,and people are much more sensitive to voice than
data,'' said Michael Malaga, CEO of NorthPoint Communications of
San Francisco, a DSL provider.
</P>
<P>
   The new technology will be offered by phone companies that
compete with the regional Bell companies, such as GST Telecom, and
by traditional DSL providers, such as NorthPoint and Covad
Communications of Santa Clara.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, ISPs and phone companies may offer it as well.
Pacific Bell already offers regular DSL service.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the voice over DSL providers will buy equipment from
companies such as CopperCom, Jetstream and TollBridge. These
companies make ``enablers,'' which let DSL lines carry voice.
Enablers about the size of an external modem sit at the customer's
home or office. Larger enablers sit at the central switching office
of the phone-service provider.
</P>
<P>
   Voice over DSL providers are bullish on technology but admit
that it might take awhile it to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be a little more tempered (than regular DSL),
because people aren't going to immediately swap out their voice
lines for voice over DSL,'' said NorthPoint's Malaga. ``With DSL,
people were looking to upgrade from a dial-up connection to a much
faster connection.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Malaga said, if companies and consumers realize they can
save money by using voice over DSL, it will start to catch on.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just another example of competition working,'' he
said.

 MEXICAN PRESIDENT PROMISES A CLEANER ELECTION  (mk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ President Ernesto Zedillo, in a state of the union
address delivered as the race to choose his successor reaches full
swing, promised to insure a ``climate of freedom'' for the vote and
to prevent government funds from seeping into political campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can all be confident that a democratically legitimate
government will emerge from these elections,'' Zedillo said
Wednesday night in the packed chambers of the lower house of
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   His words conveyed the promise of an enormous step forward for
Mexico, which has been ruled for most of the last 70 years by a
single authoritarian party that has renewed its dominion every six
years in often-tainted elections.
</P>
<P>
   The speech is the culminating rite of the annual political
calendar. This address, the fifth in Zedillo's six-year term, was
especially important. It was his last before the election in July,
and therefore it was his final chance to speak above the racket of
the most competitive presidential campaign modern Mexico has seen,
and to put forth his achievements.
</P>
<P>
   But true to his down-to-earth, almost anti-political style,
Zedillo made no effort to give a stirring performance and limited
himself largely to a bland recitation of facts and figures.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo, who strikes many Mexicans as a hard-working,
unpretentious and relatively honest politician, is enjoying the
highest popularity of his term. A national poll in in the newspaper
Reforma on Wednesday showed that 66 percent of those interviewed
approved of his performance in office. His ratings have
consistently climbed since he hit a low in December 1995, in the
midst of a crushing economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
   A Yale-educated economist, Zedillo used the central passages of
his speech to highlight the sustained growth that his disciplined
fiscal policies have produced despite economic tumult in Asia,
Russia and Brazil and the plunge in world oil prices earlier this
year.
</P>
<P>
   He said Mexico would meet its goals of 3 percent growth and 13
percent inflation this year. He once again rejected any form of
currency controls and said the peso would continue to float freely.
</P>
<P>
   Next year, even though Mexico will be in a campaign year, when
past governments could not resist the temptation to send a little
extra money to vote-getting social programs, Zedillo intends to
reduce the budget deficit, from 1 1/4 percent to 1 percent of the
gross domestic product.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes without saying that no public funds will be diverted
to campaigns,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo had sharp though indirect words for presidential
aspirants from the opposition, but also for figures in his own
party like Roberto Madrazo Pintado, who have criticized his
economic policies.
</P>
<P>
   ``Destruction is what inevitably happens, and is what we
Mexicans have experienced again and again, when irresponsibility,
demagoguery, populism and an unhealthy desire for easily won praise
become the rule in economic management,'' Zedillo said.
</P>
<P>
   He did not discuss his role in the elections. Many observers
wonder whether he will intervene with his still-vast powers to
favor a candidate whom he likes. But Zedillo did promise that he
would ``scrupulously respect all parties and all candidates'' and
do what he could to guarantee a clean vote.
</P>
<P>
   Opposition lawmakers who spoke before his speech expressed
skepticism about Zedillo's commitment to a fair election and to
refraining from exercising his presidential clout.
</P>
<P>
   ``This president still wants us to believe that there is no
other power than his, as in the old days,'' said Pablo Gomez
Alvarez, a leader of the left-of-center opposition.
</P>
<P>
   He and other opponents criticized Zedillo for blocking an
electoral reform that would have made it much easier for opposition
groups to form coalitions against the president's party.
</P>
<P>
   Most Mexicans believe that Carlos Salinas de Gortari won the
election in 1988 by fraud. Even Zedillo's rise to power in 1994 was
shadowed by the assassination in mid-campaign of the man who had
been his party's candidate, Luis Donaldo Colosio.
</P>
<P>
   In a moment of candor, Zedillo conceded that his anti-crime
programs have not worked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is with great regret that I must acknowledge that the state
has not yet met this demand of the Mexican people,'' he said. He
detailed a series of legal changes that have made it slightly
easier for police to arrest and jail criminals, as well as purges
of local and federal police forces intended to encourage a greater
focus on fighting crime.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuous for their absence were references to other pressing
issues like the four-month-old student strike that appears to be
permanently injuring the National Autonomous University, Latin
America's largest; the strife with Zapatista rebels in the state of
Chiapas, and the congressional struggle to shore up the banking
system.

 &HT;    No hearing likely regarding evidence from assault on Davidian
compound
 &HT;    By Mark England and Tommy Witherspoon
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ No hearing is likely to be scheduled on a
government motion questioning the authority of U.S. District Judge
Walter S. Smith Jr. of Waco to order the production of all evidence
relevant to what happened at Mount Carmel, a federal court official
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The court official, who asked not to be named, said Smith will
probably issue an order this week based upon a previous ruling.
Smith is trying hard to ensure the Branch Davidian civil lawsuit
begins on Oct. 18, the court official said.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 9, Smith, acting on a request from the Texas Department
of Public Safety, ordered government agencies _ and any individuals
with pertinent evidence _ to produce all records, documents,
photographs, audio and video tapes related to the raid on Mount
Carmel, the 51-day siege and the fire on April 19, 1993, that
killed David Koresh and 75 followers.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Department of Justice protested the order Tuesday,
filing a 19-page motion arguing that Smith exceeded his authority;
put an ``unwarranted and substantial burden'' on the federal
government as it prepared to defend itself against the civil
lawsuit filed by Davidian survivors and others that is set for Oct.
18; and threatened to disrupt Attorney General Janet Reno's
investigation of why it took six years to learn that incendiary
devices were used against the Branch Davidians.
</P>
<P>
   Regarding the latter, Reno, according to Justice Department
sources, was searching for a qualified outsider but had reached no
final decision Tuesday, spokesman Myron Marlin said.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department motion, signed by William Blagg, the U.S.
Attorney for the Western District of Texas, said that the
principles of separation of power prevent a federal court from
``acting as an independent investigator'' of the events that gave
rise to the litigation before it.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said they don't object to the U.S. Marshal's
Service taking custody of the Davidian evidence that was held by
the DPS _ just to Waco's Smith requiring the government to produce
additional evidence.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department's motion comes as there is renewed
interest in the Davidian case _ fueled by the FBI's admission that
military tear gas canisters, which are incendiary devices, were
fired on the day of the Mount Carmel fire.
</P>
<P>
   However, both the FBI and Reno have said there is no evidence to
suggest the blaze was set by the tear gas canisters, which were
lobbed at a concrete bunker 40 yards from the wooden compound a few
hours before the fire erupted.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant U.S. Attorney Bill Johnston of Waco _ who this week
revealed the existence of 1994 notes detailing a paralegal's
interview with members of the FBI's Hostage Rescue Team, in which
they admitted using military tear gas _ announced that he will keep
a lower profile in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Johnston was criticized by attorneys for the jailed Davidians.
They questioned his motive for releasing the notes, given that he's
named in them as having sat in on the Hostage Rescue Team
interviews.
</P>
<P>
   In his defense, Johnston said his action was an effort to warn
Reno about the notes' existence, not protect himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I should not be a spokesman regarding the issues as the
inquiry moves forward,'' Johnston wrote in a letter faxed to the
media. ``Therefore, unless unforeseen circumstances arise, I do not
intend to comment further publicly, after today, regarding the
matter at hand until such time as Congress has had the opportunity
to perform its work.''

IT MAY BE TOO SOON TO BURY THE BEANIES 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt)

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Beanie Baby backlash has begun.
</P>
<P>
   As word spread Wednesday that the maker of Beanie Babies would
``retire'' all of the pint-size stuffed animals by the end of the
year, many consumers were outraged.
</P>
<P>
   Some were simply disappointed at the thought that the toys might
actually be discontinued. More, though, said they were furious at
being manipulated by the maker of Beanies, Ty Inc., for what was
probably a publicity stunt to ratchet the through-the-roof prices
for the toys even higher.
</P>
<P>
   There may be something to those hunches.
</P>
<P>
   A spokeswoman for the McDonald's Corp. said Wednesday that it
would continue to offer Teenie Beanies again next year as part of
its Happy Meal promotion. And last month, Ty filed trademark
registration requests for several new Beanie-related names with the
Patent Trademark Office of the Commerce Department. One is for Bean
E Bears, and toy industry experts said Wednesday that it was likely
that all the hype about Ty's intentions might come down to a slight
name change for new versions of what are essentially the same toys.
</P>
<P>
   No matter, parents and consumers simply want a straight answer
from the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I'm tired of being put off by a company that has
no care or concern for the consumer,'' said Phyllis Karpinski, a
researcher for an executive search firm in Coral Springs, Fla., who
has a collection of about 300 Beanies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have a sneaking suspicion that they are trying to clear the
shelves all out and they are going to come out with more at the
beginning of the year,'' said Ms. Karpinski, whose collection
includes Hoot the owl and Mooch the monkey. ``I think this is just
a millennium kind of thing. If it is, I'll quit buying.''
</P>
<P>
   Consumers who left messages on Ty's Internet chat rooms
expressed similar sentiments. Though some expressed support for the
company, the headlines reflected an overwhelming frustration among
cybercustomers. One said, ``Let's boycott.'' Another customer
pleaded, ``Could you please work on improving your communication
with us, your CUSTOMERS!!''
</P>
<P>
   Ty was unfazed. Asked specifically if the company was interested
in clearing up the confusion for customers, Anne Nickels, a Ty
spokeswoman, said, ``We have no comment at this time.'' She said
the founder, Ty Warner, also declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The company posted a terse, cryptic announcement on its Web site
on Tuesday that started the Beanie buzz. The statement said simply
that ``All Beanies will be retired'' as of Dec. 31. The consensus
among consumers and toy industry experts Wednesday was that Ty,
which does not advertise and instead relies heavily on marketing
gimmicks, was simply engaging in a corporate game of ``gotcha'' to
drive sales as Beanies begin to lose their appeal to youngsters who
have moved on to Pokemon and Furby.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is a great risk here of having the whole thing backfire
in Ty's face,'' said Cliff Annicelli, managing editor of
Playthings, a trade publication. ``If Ty is manipulating what
children want, that is going to affect the parents of those
children. I think they have a right to feel like they are being
manipulated at this point.''
</P>
<P>
   Such tactics, Annicelli said, hurt the entire toy industry.
``After going through the last few Christmases with seemingly
manipulated shortages of toys and constant questions going on about
`how come I can't get Tickle Me Elmo or why can't I get Furby,'
this certainly doesn't help in terms of the perception of the toy
industry on the part of consumers.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Beanie owners, though, were taking the news in stride. ``I
think they should give a little more information, but I'm sure
that's part of their strategy,'' said Shelley Mosby, the mother of
a 2-year-old who received Beanies as gifts at birth. ``I just think
it's marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, there was a mix of consumer fury and frenzy, as
people rushed to snap up the toys. A Manhattan cabdriver whose
fares Wednesday included a man from Collectingnation.com, an online
auction site that specializes in Beanies, found himself on a
shopping spree.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a guy in my car, from nation something, he was going to
be on four talk shows today,'' said the driver, Joseph Kastner.
``He was frantic,'' Kastner added. ``He said buy whatever you can
buy.''
</P>
<P>
   On that advice, the cabdriver headed directly to Candy and Nuts
Too on Park Avenue in Manhattan, where he bought 19 Beanies,
including Beak the bird. ``I know this guy's expensive, but what
are you going to do?'' And with only a hint of buyer's remorse at
having paid $230 for his new plush pals, he added ``I'm broke,
believe me I should not have done this. I can't believe how cute
they are.''
</P>
<P>
   Retailers said their Beanie business was beginning to pick up
but would probably surge in the days ahead as more people got word
of the announcement by Ty. Michael Updegraff, assistant manager at
Noodle Kidoodle in Manhattan, said people were buying ``to a
limited degree,'' about 30 people by 12:30 p.m. or so, which he
considered a lot. ``The older styles are moving much more rapidly''
like Snort'' the bull and Spinner the spider.
</P>
<P>
   The general reaction to the news? ``They're in shock, I think,''
Updegraff said. ``The regular Beanie people, they don't know what
it means.'' &QL;

<P>
   The quest to find a major medical treatment for the 2.1 million
Americans _ 70 percent of them women _ who suffer from rheumatoid
arthritis has led to one local company's near shutdown and
another's potential success.
</P>
<P>
   AutoImmune Inc. said Wednesday the drug it had under development
has failed. At the same time, Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. Wednesday
said it would receive up to $82 million for its promising compound
that has so far tested well in Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, several new drugs to treat the disease _ in which
hands, wrists, and feet become painful, swollen, and stiff _ were
approved by the US Food and Drug Administration. And with more than
$2 billion spent annually by consumers on various treatments for
the disease, more than two dozen drugs are now under development,
most focused on reducing both the signs and symptoms of rheumatoid
arthritis and retarding bone damage.
</P>
<P>
   AutoImmune, of Lexington, Mass., said results from its pivotal
clinical trial involving 772 rheumatoid arthritis patients at 36
medical centers were disappointing. The drug proved to be no better
than the placebo.
</P>
<P>
   The company said it will dismiss most of its remaining 26
employees and spend the next few weeks determining its future
direction. AutoImmune shares, which were as high as 18 1/4 in 1997
and have been sliding since, closed Wednesday at 7/8, down 2 1/2 on
trading of 3.5 million shares.
</P>
<P>
   AutoImmune, which spent about $10 million for the phase III
clinical trial to test its oral tablet drug Colloral, will have
about $6 million in cash after the employee layoffs, according to
chairman and chief executive Robert C. Bishop.
</P>
<P>
   His decision to launch the phase III Colloral trial was
controversial, since an earlier trial failed to demonstrate
statistically significant effects. AutoImmune had tried
unsuccessfully to develop a similar oral tolerance drug to treat
multiple sclerosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have any second thoughts or nagging feelings over what
we did or how we did it,'' said Bishop. ``This is just one of the
vagaries of pharmaceutical development, but we have to move
forward. I am proud of the people and team that we put together.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other end, Vertex is optimistic that its proposed oral
drug for rheumatoid arthritis, called HMR 3480/VX-740, will succeed
based on early testing in Europe by Hoechst Marion Roussel, which
helped fund its initial development. Vertex is in Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Those positive results prompted Hoechst to seek to alter and
expand its initial agreement, retaining all rights to the drug and
funding its development for a trio of disorders with Vertex
receiving royalties on global sales.
</P>
<P>
   Hoechst will pay Vertex $20 million in license fees plus an
additional $62 million for successful development of the drug for
rheumatoid arthritis, the first targeted disorder. Vertex will
receive an additional $124 million if it successfully develops the
drug for two other disorders for a total of $206 million, making
the deal Vertex's single-largest research and development
collaboration.
</P>
<P>
   The Vertex drug, known as an interleukin-1 beta converting
enzyme, is expected to compete against Embrel, a genetically
engineered injectable drug approved by the FDA last September. It
was developed by Immunex Inc. of Seattle and is marketed by the
Wyeth Ayerst Laboratories, a unit of American Home Products.
</P>
<P>
   Embrel inhibits one of the key proteins that plays an important
role in the cascade of reactions that causes rheumatoid arthritis.
Another drug, Celebrex, marketed by Pfizer Inc., inhibits an enzyme
that plays a key role in pain and inflammation.
</P>
<P>
   For Hoechst, the Vertex drug would be its second major drug for
treating rheumatoid arthritis. Last fall, Hoechst gained FDA
approval for Arava, an oral medication that reduces symptoms of the
disease and retards bone damage.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a huge market with an aging population of baby boomers
that is underserved, and having an oral tablet vs. an injectable
should give us a significant advantage,'' said John Randle, a
Vertex program executive.
</P>
<P>
   Vertex shares closed Wednesday at 28 3/4, up 1.

IRS SUGGESTS CASH-BALANCE PENSION PLAN MAY VIOLATE
AGE-DISCRIMINATION LAWS  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Ohio, Ind.)   By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr.   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Cash-balance pension plans have drawn heavy criticism lately
because they often reduce the pensions of older workers. In fact, a
memo written by an Internal Revenue Service district director one
year ago _ and released Tuesday by a member of Congress _ stated
that one cash-balance pension plan may violate age-discrimination
laws.
</P>
<P>
   Cash-balance pension plans have become popular with employers
because they are cheaper and can offer better benefits to young
workers unlikely to spend their career in one place.
</P>
<P>
   But middle-aged employees at a number of companies that have
converted to cash-balance plans have complained about benefit
reductions that they say can take away up to 50 percent of the
value of their pensions. In response, some lawmakers in Washington
have sought to stop cash-balance conversions through legislation or
action by federal agencies.
</P>
<P>
   Traditional pension-plan benefits are typically calculated using
the number of years an employee was at a company and final pay, so
most of the value of the pension is based on years late in a
person's career. Under cash-balance plans, companies contribute a
percentage of an employee's pay to an account every year, and then
guarantee that money will grow at a certain interest rate, such as
the yield on a Treasury bill. At retirement, that account is the
pension.
</P>
<P>
   The September 1998 IRS memo, released Tuesday by Rep. Bernard
Sanders, a Vermont Independent and critic of cash-balance plans,
could fuel efforts to slow cash-balance conversions. In the memo,
the IRS district director in Cincinnati, C. Ashley Bullard, told
IRS officials in Washington that one company's cash-balance plan
may not comply with age-discrimination rules because the ``plan's
benefit accrual rate decreases as a participant attains each
additional year of age.''
</P>
<P>
   Sanders said in a statement, ``This memo bears out what I and
others have been saying: If the rate of accrual goes down as
workers get older, then the plan violates the law.''
</P>
<P>
   Bullard declined comment Wednesday. A spokesman for the IRS, Don
Roberts, said the memo merely reflected internal agency debate
about a pension plan at one specific company. He declined to say
whether the IRS had made any formal decision relating to the plan.
In the memo, he said, regional IRS officials were seeking guidance
from the national office about the one plan, and the document did
not necessarily reflect the position of Bullard. It ``is not
precedent-setting and may not be cited as a broad statement'' of
IRS policy, he said.
</P>
<P>
   IRS officials are also working on a response to a letter from
some members of Congress about whether cash-balance plans violate
age-discrimination or other rules.
</P>
<P>
   The name of the company that was the subject of the memo was
blacked out, but according to people close to the matter, it refers
to the Onan Corp., a subsidiary of the Cummins Engine Co. based in
Fridley, Minn.
</P>
<P>
   As previously reported, the IRS, in a filing in a lawsuit in
U.S. Tax Court, has taken the position that an Onan pension plan
should be stripped of its tax-exempt status because of the way it
converted to a type of cash-balance plan. If the judge in that case
agrees with the IRS, Onan will be given the opportunity to correct
any problems with the plan.
</P>
<P>
   Cummins said Wednesday that the company had not received
confirmation that Onan was the subject of the IRS memo, and that
the agency had not raised age discrimination in the tax court case.
``Onan does not believe there can be age discrimination when
everyone who makes the same amount, no matter what age, gets the
same company contribution each year,'' said the spokeswoman, Marya
M. Rose.  &QL;

 &HT;    Beanie plan brings panic, skepticism
 &HT;    By John Pletz
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Retired, yes. Buried, no.
</P>
<P>
   That's the word on Beanie Babies, the popular bean-filled toy
creatures that have been popular collectibles with children, teens
and adults.
</P>
<P>
   Beanie manufacturer Ty Inc. created a minor uproar Tuesday when
it posted a message on its Web site that it would retire its lineup
of critters Dec. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The vague message, which followed a list of 10 new Beanie Babies
due out this month, had many wondering if Ty was getting out of the
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``A bunch of people panicked,'' said Jack Ball, manager at Pat's
Beanies &AMP; More, a shop in North Austin. ``People have been calling
for two days. Sales tripled.''
</P>
<P>
   Some retailers said they suspect that's just what Ty and its
namesake owner, Ty Warner, had in mind.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, my thoughts on it are it's a marketing scheme,''
said Cari Cox, assistant manager at Always Collectible.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Ty, which has an unlisted phone number, aren't
talking.
</P>
<P>
   For several weeks, Ty's Web site had been promoting ``a news
flash'' for Aug. 31. The company periodically discontinues or
``retires'' individual characters, retailers said. Only 47 of the
300 Beanies produced are ``current'' in collector parlance. The
rest already have been retired.
</P>
<P>
   This time the announcement was earlier than usual.
</P>
<P>
   Ball said he thinks it's Ty Warner's way of making sure that
retailers can get product moving. The summer's shipment of Beanies
is still taking up space on shelves, and the Christmas season is
coming quickly.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Warner) knows what he's doing,'' Ball said. ``He's smart as
hell. He's a great marketer.''
</P>
<P>
   Pat Johnson, the Pat behind Pat's Beanies, said it was unlikely
that a company that recently expanded into five countries across
Europe and Asia would abandon its business.
</P>
<P>
   Some customers said Wednesday they weren't falling for Ty's
gimmick, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just a ploy,'' said Sherrie Frachtman, who stopped at
Johnson's store for a birthday present, not a Beanie Baby.
</P>
<P>
   She said her 7-year-old daughter, Adrienne, did hear about the
retirement at school and asked whether the Beanies she collects
were going away for good.
</P>
<P>
   Many Beanie collectors took to the Internet after the
announcement, offering their wares on auction services such as eBay
and collecting.nation.com. But for the most part, prices didn't
seem any higher than normal, ranging from $2.50 to about $50.
</P>
<P>
   Beanies sell for $6.99 new at retailers. But once retired, they
fetch more. Some extremely rare Beanies have commanded more than
$1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Although Ty, a private company, doesn't disclose sales figures,
Beanie Babies have been wildly successful from a marketing
standpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an 8-year-old daughter, and we have countless Beanie
Babies,'' said Meme Drumwright, an assistant professor of
advertising at the University of Texas. ``But even older boys
collected these. My aunt has a friend in her 70s who has a whole
room full of these. Many other toy products have captivated one
market, but very few have been able to span the age groups.''

LOWE'S SORE TOE KEEPS HIM FROM GAME 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOE BURRIS  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Red Sox reliever Derek Lowe reported to work Wednesday
and got the medical OK to miss Wednesday's game against the Royals.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe, who had appeared in four of the team's last five contests,
was excused because the pain from an ingrown toenail he's had the
last month had become unbearable. After an impromptu media session,
he was scheduled to have it removed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I pitched for four of five days, so they decided it was the
good day to take it out so I can pitch again,'' said Lowe. ``It's
just for a day. I'll pitch again tomorrow if needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of guys with bumps and bruises this time of the
year, but you have to put those aside. You have six months to heal
in the offseason, so you have to go as hard as you can.''
</P>
<P>
   His brief departure came on a day when help was arriving. Rod
Beck, acquired Wednesday in a deal with the Cubs, showed up just
prior to game time. The addition of Beck should help improve a
bullpen that has gone through many changes since Tom Gordon exited
with an elbow injury.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's great. The guy had 51 saves last year,'' said Lowe of his
new teammate. ``He knows how to pitch in late games. He's been a
closer for I don't know how many years and he's done it in playoff
pressure and done a tremendous job. Whenever you can add a guy like
that, all it does is make the team a lot better.''
</P>
<P>
   In his last four appearances, Lowe pitched 4 1/3 innings,
allowing a hit and a walk and striking out five, while recording a
win and picking up three saves. In 60 appearances this season, Lowe
is 5-2 with an earned run average of 2.76, 10 saves, and 3 blown
saves.
</P>
<P>
   Lowe leads Red Sox relievers in appearances, innings (88), and
strikeouts (64).
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the reason I can do it is I throw a majority of
fastballs,'' said Lowe of his durability. ``I'm a fastball pitcher
and your arm has a tendency to bounce back more when you're
throwing strictly fastballs. I'm not going to say you're feeling
100 percent when you're out there. But that's the job you're asked
to do and you do it the best you can.''
</P>
<P>
   The second-year major leaguer said he would prefer starting,
``but if you look at my track record, it's not too good,'' said
Lowe, who began last season as a starter and went 0-7 before
recording his first victory. ``I think I could be a much better
starter (now) just because I've been in the league a couple of
years. I've got more confidence. My changeup has gotten a lot
better than it was last year, my curveball, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this game, you don't dictate what you do. Management has a
plan for everybody. You just go out and pitch and your goal is to
stay healthy. Everyone wants to go to the World Series and if the
best chance is for me to be a set-up guy, that's what I will do.''
</P>
<P>
   Lowe is a quality set-up man but doesn't mind closing. He said
someone who has been in the league for two years should not make
demands on his role. He is merely trying to improve his skills to
aid the team during the stretch run.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think last year helped me a lot in pitching,'' said Lowe.
``The stretch run of last year, pitching in September and then
pitching in postseason, helped me to pitch under pressure and enjoy
the atmosphere because this is exciting, this is what every player
plays for.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you have to relax and still make quality pitches. This
last two weeks really helped me out. Hopefully I can still learn
and have it to lean on in the end of the year.''

personal, even trivial, ``factoids'' about him (he likes to work
standing up at his desk, for one).
</P>
<P>
   The site includes Dell's speeches, his view of the Internet,
details about computers he uses, an interactive game for children
and a link to the Austin Children's Museum Dell Discovery Center.
</P>
<P>
   The Round Rock-based company says most of the content is simply
responding to customer interest in the founder, who attracts crowds
of autograph-seekers when he appears in public.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are getting so many requests for this kind of information
about Michael that we decided to consolidate it and make it
available to everybody,'' Dell spokeswoman Patty Rowell said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   But the site also signifies that the chief executive, who used
to be uncomfortable in front of audiences, accepts his role as an
industry icon. The subject of an increasing number of news media
profiles and TV interviews, he also appears in a round of recently
started TV commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, 34, has typically resisted moves that might be seen as
self-promotion. His book, ``Direct from Dell,'' which was published
last spring, is a dry history of his company and a description of
how its direct model works. There is little biographical
information.
</P>
<P>
   In 1987, Dell opposed an employee's suggestion to change the
company's name from PC's Limited to Dell Computer Corp. when it
launched the business in the United Kingdom.
</P>
<P>
   ``He didn't want to be seen as a man who was pushing his ego out
in the marketplace,'' said Andrew Harris, the U.K. executive who
prevailed on the name change.
</P>
<P>
   Even last year, Dell seemed uncomfortable offering his opinion
on issues that didn't directly involve his company. In May 1998, a
reporter approached him at an Austin hotel where he was speaking to
ask for comments about Andy Grove's surprise decision to step down
as CEO of Intel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Dell, who knows Grove personally, looked blankly at the
reporter, while her tape recorder picked up only background sounds.
His Web site, which resembles a site on Grove at intel.com, is
further evidence that those days are over. Harris, who left Dell
and started Hand Technologies, an Austin PC company, said Michael's
wife, Susan, helped him grow comfortable in his high-profile role.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, Susan had a big impact, because Susan is a gregarious
lady,'' Harris said.

AS HIGH AS A KITE IN THE SKY _ 'WAY TOO HIGH, IN FACT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service Clients) 
By KATHY SANDERS 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Larry Frakes was flying high _ too high,
really _ and then he came reeling down to earth. Or at least his
kite did.
</P>
<P>
   A 39-year-old Bell Helicopter machinist and all-around tinkerer
and inventor, Frakes gets his thrills from seeing how high he can
fly his homemade, modified box kite.
</P>
<P>
   His exhilaration, however, came to an abrupt halt Monday night
when his rainbow-colored, 4-foot-tall kite soared to 2,500 feet,
where it interfered with air traffic at three local air strips, put
the medical helicopter service on standby and sent the police
helicopter zooming up to check the altitude of the potentially
catastrophic toy.
</P>
<P>
   Police pilot Ron Paddock and Officer F.C. Ferguson, acting as
relief flight officer, initially couldn't locate the kite while
flying at 500 feet.
</P>
<P>
   From the ground, another officer told them to look up, Ferguson
said. Their immediate response was a few choice words. The kite was
cruising at 2,000 feet, they said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It frightened me. If you get tangled up in that cord, it'll
bring you down. It doesn't make sense to do something that
idiotic,'' said Paddock, who said he feared that the rotors of the
helicopter, Air One, might get caught in the kite's cord.
</P>
<P>
   ``My wife said he probably was trolling for aliens,'' Paddock
said. ``It's the only UFO in the city that's now been identified.''
</P>
<P>
   Frakes said the kite reached 2,500 feet _ almost five times the
height of the tallest downtown building _ before the helicopter
arrived to help Officer R.P. Ross, who was in a patrol car, search
for the kite flyer. But Frakes said he had reeled it in about 500
feet by the time the officers arrived.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did notice one small aircraft had to move to avoid hitting
it, but I really think the pilot was overexaggerating,'' Frakes
said. ``He wasn't that close to it.''
</P>
<P>
   The kite, which Frakes designed and built in four months after
he helped his daughter with a school kite project, is equipped with
a red strobe light to increase its visibility to pilots.
</P>
<P>
   Frakes became a bit sheepish when Ferguson and Ross traced the
kite's line to his home and informed him that his high-flying
gambit had stopped traffic at Sycamore Air Strip and had caused
planes to be diverted from Meacham _ a major general aviation
center _ and Spinks airports.
</P>
<P>
   ``It made me feel kind of stupid, but I brought it down,'' he
said. ``I like flying it high. There's an adrenaline rush when it
goes way up. I tried to push it to its maximum.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just like watching it fly real high with the clouds as a
backdrop. It's very peaceful.''
</P>
<P>
   His wife, Sherry, and two daughters, Alicia, 13, and Lauren, 10,
don't like to see the kite soar that high because it becomes only
only a dot in the sky.
</P>
<P>
   ``You just don't see kites being flown at that height in Fort
Worth,'' Ferguson said. ``This is one for the memory books.''
</P>
<P>
   Roland Herwig, a Federal Aviation Administration spokesman in
Oklahoma City, said he had no information about the incident, but
he said that any time a kite exceeds 150 feet, ``then we would like
to know.''
</P>
<P>
   Frakes initially was discouraged after talking to police, but
now said he is more optimistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't stop flying the kite,'' he said. ``I just won't fly it
as high as I like.''

 &HT;    European teams no lock to qualify for Euro 2000
 &HT;    By Wendy Parker
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Many of Europe's top teams are feeling the pressure as
Euro 2000 qualifying resumes during the next week. Czech Republic
is the only team to clinch a place in next summer's 16-nation
finals in Belgium and Holland.
</P>
<P>
   Reigning World Cup champion France trails the Ukraine by a point
in Group 4 and must play Saturday in Kiev, then at Armenia on
Wednesday. Midfielder Zinedine Zidane returns for France after a
five-match injury absence.
</P>
<P>
   Defending European champion Germany is tied with Turkey at the
top of Group 3 but travels to Finland on Saturday and is without
promising midfielder Sebastian Deisler, who has an injured thigh.
</P>
<P>
   In Group 5, Englandneeds all three points from a home match
Saturday against Luxembourg to tie second-place Poland, then has to
play in Warsaw on Wednesday in its finale. Sweden leads Poland by a
point. Injuries have affected England, too, as goalkeeper David
Seaman and defender Sol Campbell are out of action for both games
and Michael Owen might be relegated to the bench.
</P>
<P>
   All nine group winners and the second-place team with the most
points automatically qualify. The eight other runners-up will play
for the last four spots.
</P>
<P>
   Spain has a commanding goal differential in Group 6, but Israel
and Austria are only two points behind. Italy is cruising in Group
1 but is host to Denmark, tied for second with Switzerland.
Portugal and Romania, battling for the top of Group 7, meet in
Bucharest on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Group 8 is playing catch-up because of postponements by the NATO
bombings in the Balkans. Ireland beat Yugoslavia 2-1 Wednesday in
Dublin to take the lead by a point, but has to play Saturday at
second-place Croatia and then at Malta on Wednesday. Yugoslavia,
two points behind, is host to Macedonia on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Champions League: ``B'' is for brutal
</P>
<P>
   Cries of protest are coming from Barcelona, Fiorentina and
Arsenal after they were placed in Group B of the initial European
Champions League draw; the fourth, weaker member is AIK Stockholm.
</P>
<P>
   That foursome is the most difficult as the expanded 32-team
event starts Sept. 14 after three qualifying rounds that yielded
few surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Defending champion Manchester United should be able to prevail
against Group D rivals Olympique Marseille, Croatia Zagreb and
Sturm Graz. Runner-up Bayern Munich will have a challenge in Group
F with Rangers, PSV Eindhoven and Valencia.
</P>
<P>
   England: Robson to Newcastle?
</P>
<P>
   Former England manager Bobby Robson, a childhood Newcastle fan,
has expressed interest in managing the floundering club after the
resignation of embattled Ruud Gullit. The 0-5-1 Geordies, off to
the worst start in their 107-year-old history, suffered a 5-1
defeat to Manchester United on Monday, with former Newcastle star
Andy Cole scoring four goals.... Liverpool dominated injury-plagued
Arsenal 2-0 Saturday, as Robbie Fowler and Patrick Berger got the
goals.
</P>
<P>
   Germany: Bayern fights, then wins
</P>
<P>
   Roque Santa Cruz, 18, scored the lone goal to lead Bayern Munich
to its first win of the Bundesliga seasonSaturday over tiny
Bavarian neighbors Unterhaching.
</P>
<P>
   Bayern's defenders Lothar Matthaus and Bixente Lizarazu got into
a fight at a Friday practice. Lizarazu was fined $5,300 for
punching Matthaus in the face. Bayern midfielder Mario Basler,
involved in a contract dispute, was fined $10,000 for staying late
at a Munich disco the night before the game. Two years ago, Basler
was fined for making a habit of attending Oktoberfest.
</P>
<P>
   Italy: Hat trick for Vieri
</P>
<P>
   The world's richest soccer player got his Inter Milan debut off
to a bang Sunday. Christian Vieri, who signed for an international
record of $50 million this summer, had a hat trick in a 3-0 win
over Verona.... But several Serie A favorites didn't fare as well
in their season openers, including defending champion AC Milan,
which blew two leads in a 2-2 draw with newly promoted Lecce.
Juventus drew 1-1 at home against Reggina, playing its first match
in Serie A.... Fiorentina got a goal from Enrico Chiesa to edge
Bari 1-0, while Lazio, which beat Manchester United on Friday in
the UEFA SuperCup, got early goals from new signees Juan Veron and
Simone Inzaghi in defeating Cagliari 2-1 Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Spain: Rayo scores another upset
</P>
<P>
   Newly promoted Rayo Vallecano scored its second consecutive
upset in the Primera Division. Manuel Carrabal scored the clincher
with three minutes left, asRayo Vallecano beat Mallorca 2-1....
Rivaldo had a goal and an assist as Barcelona beat Racing Santander
2-1. Ex-Liverpool midfielder Steve McManaman had his first Spanish
goal in Real Madrid's 4-1 win over Numancia.
</P>
<P>
   France: Fit to be tied _ four times
</P>
<P>
   For the fourth match in a row, first-division favorite Olympique
Marseille has drawn, Saturday by a 1-1 score against Bastia. AS
Monaco, tied for the lead with three teams, got two goals from
David Trezeguet in a 3-0 win over Troyes. Paris St-Germain could
have taken over sole possession of first place, but lost 1-0 to
Olympique Lyon, which joined the top group on a penalty-kick goal.

COURT REJECTS CITY APPEAL ON HARLEM RALLY
</HEADLINE>
   (dal) 
 By DAVID BARSTOW   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A federal appeals court on Wednesday emphatically
rejected the city's final legal challenge to a Harlem youth rally
and, in an unusual step, explicitly ordered the Police Department
not to oversee the event with ``undue rigidity.''
</P>
<P>
   Searching for a way to head off the violence of a similar rally
held last year, the judges also ordered organizers of the event,
billed as the Million Youth March, to make ``all reasonable
efforts'' to end the event promptly and peacefully by the judges'
deadline of 4 p.m. Saturday. If the organizers fail to make a
sincere effort, the judges warned, they could be held in contempt
of court.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for the city said that they would not appeal the ruling,
even though Mayor Rudolph Giuliani called it ``one of the more
irresponsible decisions that I have seen a court render.''
</P>
<P>
   ``These judges have their heads in the sand,'' he said Wednesday
of the three judges who heard the case in the 2nd U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Thank goodness they don't have to govern a city,'' the mayor
said, ``because things would be really dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Giuliani said he would not grant a permit for what he
called a ``hate march.'' In turn, the march's primary organizer,
Khallid Abdul Muhammad, vowed to hold the rally anyway, calling it
a ``love march.'' City lawyers went to court, arguing that a
history of inflammatory, racially charged speeches by Muhammad was
sufficient cause to deny the permit, but those arguments were
rejected on Tuesday by U.S. District Judge Denny Chin.
</P>
<P>
   In upholding that ruling on Wednesday, the judges ordered the
city to grant a rally permit under virtually the same terms and
conditions as last year's event. Once again, the event will be held
on Malcolm X Boulevard between 118th and 124th Streets. The event
is scheduled to start at noon and end at 4 p.m., as it was last
year.
</P>
<P>
   But even those seemingly straightforward parameters failed to
head off a serious confrontation last year, when, just after 4
p.m., a phalanx of officers swept toward the stage, only to come
under furious attack from demonstrators who hurled chairs and
anything else they could get their hands on. Dozens were injured.
</P>
<P>
   As they questioned lawyers for the city and the Million Youth
March during oral arguments Wednesday morning, the judges were
plainly determined to avoid a repeat of last year's violence, while
also directly challenging much of the angry bluster that has
characterized public statements on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   They were visibly impatient with the city's argument that
Muhammad's angry exhortations last year for violent resistance
against ``attacks'' by the police constituted a valid basis for
denying a rally permit this year. Judge Jon O. Newman asked the
city's corporation counsel, Michael D. Hess, to cite a legal
precedent in support of this position. ``Any court ever done
that?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   Hess paused. ``May I have a moment?'' he asked. He paused some
more. He was unable to come up with a case.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Later, Newman asked Hess whether the city had ``given
instructions to the Police Department concerning techniques to be
used'' at the conclusion of the rally.
</P>
<P>
   No, Hess said.
</P>
<P>
   Frowning, Newman suggested that such conversations take place
immediately, and he invited Hess to spell out recommendations he
would make to the Police Department.
</P>
<P>
   Hess replied that he would tell the police that ``all efforts
should be made'' to end the rally promptly and safely. Still not
satisfied, Newman asked Hess whether promptly meant ``at the stroke
of 4.''
</P>
<P>
   Hess conceded that there ``should be some flexibility,'' but the
judges, in a written order, were far more explicit. The Police
Department, the judges wrote, ``may announce that the crowd must
begin to disperse at 4 p.m., but must allow a few minutes to permit
the dispersal to begin, and may not forcibly act to disperse the
crowd unless it is apparent, within a few minutes after
announcement of a requirement to disperse, that dispersal is not
about to begin or, if begun, is not continuing with reasonable
dispatch.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, the judges said that nothing in their order
limited ``any reasonable action'' by the police ``to respond to any
acts of violence'' or to arrest anyone who otherwise violates the
law.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   When it came to the rally organizers, the judges repeatedly
expressed concern about Muhammad's insistence on marching with or
without a city permit. Newman asked a lawyer for the organizers,
Roger Wareham, whether Muhammad and the other organizers were
prepared to abide by whatever restrictions the court imposed on the
rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes, they are,'' Wareham replied. But here, too, the judges in
their written order left little room for misunderstanding about the
responsibilities of the rally organizers.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the Million Youth March, the judges wrote, ``have
represented to this court that they will abide by the street
limitations that have been agreed upon, and by the time limitations
ordered by this court, that they will end their rally at the time
designated by this court, and that they will make all reasonable
efforts to disperse those in attendance as promptly and peacefully
as possible, and these representations are hereby made an order of
this court.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet within hours of these admonitions for reason and restraint,
city officials and rally organizers resumed squabbling over several
details, such as the placement of barricades and whether subway
service to the area would be shut down, as it was last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Here we go again,'' Wareham said with disgust, after trying
unsuccessfully to arrange a meeting with city officials Wednesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Hess and police officials declined to discuss preparations for
the rally, saying those were ``operational'' details that could not
be disclosed. Hess said he did not know whether the subways would
be closed again, or whether fewer officers would be sent to the
rally, or whether barricades would be used more sparingly.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the city was prepared to agree to the organizers'
demands for a reduced police presence, Hess said yes, there was one
item that might be negotiable. The organizers have asked the city
not to send police helicopters buzzing low over the crowd, as
happened at the conclusion of last year's rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would think that's something to be seriously considered,''
Hess said in an interview.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Efforts to find any accommodation have been complicated by a
steady stream of insult and invective flowing between the two
protagonists. Giuliani, who seems to delight in mispronouncing
Khallid Muhammad's name, has referred to the event as the
``Khalleel Mao-hammad hate march.'' Muhammad has called Giuliani a
``racist, cantankerous, constipated cracker.''
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday night, during a news conference in Harlem to
promote the rally, Muhammad continued his harsh criticism of
Giuliani, accusing him of attempting to create a climate of
repression and fear. He was joined by about 50 supporters, who
punctuated his remarks with chants of ``black power.'' Several wore
T-shirts bearing Muhammad's picture over the words, ``The white
man's worst nightmare.''

 &HT;    Fan hurt by thrown bat loses court case
 &HT;    By Bill Rankin
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ A man seriously injured by a flung baseball bat during
a 1997 Atlanta Braves game has struck out in his attempt to collect
damages.
</P>
<P>
   In a unanimous opinion, a three-judge panel of the 11th U.S.
Circuit Court of Appeals in Atlanta rejected a lawsuit by Sterling
Lapinski, a former Georgia Power Co. employee whose skull was
shattered by a bat flung by New York Mets catcher Todd Pratt.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Lapinski) assumed the risk of injury from the bat
accidentally released by the New York Mets ballplayer,'' the court
said.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski's lawyer, Bill deGolian, said he may ask the court to
reconsider its decision. ``We're terribly, terribly disappointed,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   At the July 11, 1997, game, Lapinski sat in field-level seats
behind the third-base dugout. In the fifth inning, Pratt swung and
missed at a Tom Glavine fastball and flung his bat into the stands.
</P>
<P>
   Lapinski, who was talking to a waitress at the time, heard the
yells and turned toward the field. Pratt's bat slammed into his
forehead. The impact shattered his skull, crushed his sinus cavity
and tore the lining of his brain. He was taken to Crawford Long
Hospital. Doctors said the injuries increased his risk of seizures.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling, handed down last week, relied on a 50-year-old
opinion.
</P>
<P>
   In 1949, the Georgia Court of Appeals, considering a lawsuit by
a spectator injured by a wildly thrown baseball during a game in
Thomasville, said a person who accepts a seat in an unprotected
portion of the grandstand ``voluntarily assumes the risks inherent
in such a position.'' The court recognized injury by ``foul balls,
flying bats and other like missiles'' as an inherent risk.
</P>
<P>
   DeGolian had argued that a flung bat was a much rarer occurrence
and something a player should be able to control.
</P>
<P>
   In each of Pratt's first three trips to the plate during the
game, his bat sailed into the stands. Only Lapinski, struck during
Pratt's second at-bat, was seriously hurt.

GORE TO ANNOUNCE COMPENSATION FOR DISTRESSED FISHERMEN  
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By SCOTT ALLEN  
 c.1999 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- Hundreds of hard-pressed New England fishermen will
receive up to $1,500 for each day that their fishing grounds were
closed by regulators this past spring, under a federal
disaster-relief program that Vice President Al Gore plans to
announce Thursday during a visit to Boston.
</P>
<P>
   The $5 million aid package targets some of the region's most
vulnerable fishermen, the crews of small boats from Gloucester to
eastern Maine villages that ply the near-shore waters of the Gulf
of Maine. There, the once-plentiful codfish have become so scarce
that regulators have all but closed the entire fishing ground.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for the federal aid, fishermen must help in
scientific research over the next two years in an effort to end
disagreements between scientists and fishermen over the severity of
the fishing crisis.
</P>
<P>
   ``For too long, we acted as if the ocean's resources were
infinite, and we must help those who are now paying the price,''
said Gore in a statement prepared for release Thursday.
``Ultimately, our goal must be to rebuild sustainable fisheries so
that the working families of the New England coast can again reap
the harvest of the sea.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials and fishermen praised Gore's announcement as an
important step in helping fishermen hard hit by recent limits on
their livelihoods, while also helping scientists better understand
the problems. For instance, cod, long a staple of New England
fishing, are not producing many young fish, and biologists don't
know why.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think fishermen would rather go out and fish, but I'm glad
to hear'' of the disaster relief, said William Amaru, a member of
the New England Fishery Management Council that sets fishing
regulations.
</P>
<P>
   The relief package, negotiated with officials from
Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine, opens a new phase in aid
for New England's tattered fishing industry. Since the collapse of
the offshore Georges Bank fishing ground in 1994, the Commerce
Department has spent nearly $60 million on everything from buying
fishermen's boats to training them for new jobs.
</P>
<P>
   But the program Gore will detail marks the first time that the
federal government has specifically targeted the 750 fishing boats
in the Gulf of Maine, a swath of water that includes the near-shore
fishing grounds from Cape Ann in Massachusetts east to the Canadian
border. Even as other fishing grounds slowly rebound, biologists
say the gulf is still reeling.
</P>
<P>
   A big part of the problem, say industry analysts, is that
fishermen flocked to the Gulf of Maine over the last few years as
other fishing grounds were closed by regulators and the price of
cod ran high, causing a rapid depletion of the cod and other fish.
Now, Gulf of Maine cod populations are in the worst condition of
all major commercial fish stocks.
</P>
<P>
   In response, the New England Fishery Management Council started
a wave of closures in the Gulf of Maine from February to June this
year to protect cod during spawning season. Since then, the council
has adopted an unpopular 100-pound limit on the cod catch,
effectively closing the gulf to cod fishing.
</P>
<P>
   Under the program, any fishing boat owner who can prove that the
Gulf of Maine closures forced him to miss fishing days can apply
for $1,500 for each lost day, though some of that money must be
shared with the crew. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration will notify eligible fishermen by mail in the next
two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   In return for each day of aid, fishermen must agree to a day of
fishing research, such as netting fish to check their abundance.
Fishermen and biologists have clashed repeatedly over the years,
with fishermen contending that the biologists overstate the fishing
crisis by undercounting the fish.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good start and that's the bottom line. More
industry-scientist endeavors need to be done,'' said Tom Hill,
chairman of the New England Fishery Management Council, which just
named a scientific steering committee to identify the major areas
of research needed.
</P>
<P>
   Gore, who will be at Boston's New England Aquarium to announce a
new federal task force on ocean conservation, said in a statement
that the new aid ``will bring fishermen and scientists together in
research collaborations that will improve our understanding of
ocean fisheries so we can better manage them in the future.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
said the announcement will be just the first installment of federal
aid, if Congress approves aid measures put forward by President
Clinton or members of the Massachusetts congressional delegation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are arguing that we need a long-term recovery program for
the Gulf of Maine,'' said one senior federal official. ``There's no
question this is a multi-year problem. Though cod is a bellwether
stock, the Gulf of Maine as a whole is being overfished.''
</P>
<P>
   To tide fishermen over, aid of the sort that Gore is announcing
will be needed on a long-term basis, he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   KUALA LUMPUR, Malaysia _ Taking a major stride back into the
world's financial mainstream, the Malaysian government Wednesday
lifted a steep tax on the repatriation of foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
   The move is expected to uncork a stream of capital out of
Malaysia, as overseas fund managers withdraw money that had been
effectively locked in the country since the government imposed
sweeping capital controls last September.
</P>
<P>
   Still, several analysts said they expected the outflow to be on
the order of $1 billion to $2 billion _ far smaller than earlier
forecasts of $6 billion to $7 billion. As a result, the
long-awaited easing of restrictions caused little commotion in
stock prices here, which declined less than 2 percent _ an ordinary
fluctuation in an emerging market.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia was also buoyed by new statistics reaffirming that its
economy is in the midst of a remarkable recovery. The government
reported that the trade surplus rose to $1.52 billion in July, a 46
percent increase over the comparable period last year, on the
strength of surging exports.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some unreconstructed enemies of Malaysia,'' said
P.K. Basu, an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in Singapore.
``But most of the people I talk to are eager to invest in the
country again.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia's decision last year to impose controls made it a
maverick among Asia's economically stricken nations. While most of
its neighbors adhered to the International Monetary Fund's
prescription of open markets and high interest rates, Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohamad turned his back on the West, even laying
the blame for Asian ills on foreign currency traders.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir had relaxed the controls once before. In February, he
replaced a moratorium on removing foreign money with an exit tax
that penalized investors for withdrawing it in less than a year.
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia has not lifted all capital controls: Its currency, the
ringgit, remains nonconvertible outside the country, with an
exchange rate fixed to the United States dollar. Also, while
investors no longer have to pay a penalty for withdrawing money,
they will still be taxed on their gains.
</P>
<P>
   As with the exit tax, the capital-gains tax is graduated to
encourage investors to leave their money in Malaysia as long as
possible. Profits on investments held for less than a year will be
taxed at 30 percent; with investments held for more than a year,
the rate will be 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think too many people have capital gains on their
Malaysian investments, but for those that do, it's a factor,'' said
Bill Kaye, senior managing director of the Pacific Group, a Hong
Kong hedge fund.
</P>
<P>
   On the face of it, Malaysia's experience would seem to vindicate
the 73-year-old Mahathir, who drew worldwide opprobrium when he
imposed the controls last September. He said they were necessary to
protect Malaysia from the destructive ebbs and flows of foreign
capital that had plunged the country into recession and ignited a
regionwide crisis.
</P>
<P>
   Critics here and in the United States predicted that Mahathir
would turn a nation that depended on trade into a pariah. Morgan
Stanley Dean Witter removed Malaysia from its influential Asian
emerging markets stock index. Foreign portfolio investment all but
evaporated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Malaysia has chosen to become a heretic, a pariah if you
like,'' Mahathir said in a speech then.
</P>
<P>
   He further alienated investors and others by ousting and
imprisoning his protege, Deputy Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim.
Anwar, who received a six-year prison term for what his defenders
say were politically motivated corruption charges and is now being
tried on accusations of sodomy, had advocated a more open financial
policy.
</P>
<P>
   As Malaysia has gradually loosened the capital controls, it has
won back some of the skeptics. Last month, Morgan Stanley
reinstated it on its index, effective next February. Prominent
economists, including Paul Krugman of the Massachusetts Institute
of Technology, note that the controls had some beneficial effects.
</P>
<P>
   By fixing its currency at a relatively low rate of 3.8 ringgit
to the dollar, Malaysia made its exports extremely competitive. Its
booming trade in computers and peripherals is the major reason its
economic output swung from negative statistics to 4.1 percent
growth in the second quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pegged exchange rate is the key to Malaysia's export
success,'' Basu of Credit Suisse said. ``The predictability of the
exchange rate allowed exporters and foreign direct investors to
plan.'' He noted that the new rules could still put off investors.
The capital-gains tax will make it difficult for fund managers to
value their portfolios since they cannot calculate their profits
beforehand.
</P>
<P>
   Kaye is among those who refuse to put money into Malaysia. ``Who
wants to be told the terms on which you can or cannot invest?'' he
said. ``They're putting themselves at an enormous competitive
disadvantage.''
</P>
<P>
   Malaysia has attracted less foreign investment than South Korea
or Thailand, even though its economy has rebounded at least as
strongly as those countries have. But Basu said it was a sign of
Malaysia's strengths that it attracted more than $1 billion in
foreign money between March and July _ a period when it was not
included in Morgan Stanley's stock index.
</P>
<P>
   Basu said it would be a few weeks before one could judge the
magnitude of the capital exodus from Malaysia.
</P>
<P>
   Mahathir, however, said to reporters Wednesday that he was
confident the government could withstand the outflows, which he
estimated at $3 billion to $4 billion. It has accumulated $32
billion in reserves and is running a large current-account surplus.
With exports booming, economists said that at least for now,
Malaysia does not really need foreign money.

 &HT;    Rose's former bookie hit with assault charge
 &HT;    By Lawrence Budd
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The bookie infamous for taking the sports bets
that led to Pete Rose's lifetime ban from major league baseball
could be headed back to prison.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Peters, 42, remained in the Warren County jail Wednesday, a
day after his arrest on charges including assaulting a police
officer. He was scheduled to appear this morning for a preliminary
hearing in Warren County.
</P>
<P>
   Ten years ago, Rose was banned from baseball for gambling,
largely based on Peters' records of bets placed on sports events by
the former Cincinnati Reds great, who still holds the career record
for hits.
</P>
<P>
   Peters, who ran his betting operation from Jonathan's Cafe in
Franklin, was convicted of tax evasion and drug trafficking charges
and sent to federal prison for two years in July 1989. After his
release from prison, he returned to Warren County and was working
for a Cincinnati company.
</P>
<P>
   About 3 a.m. Tuesday, Peters was accused of assaulting a
Springboro police officer and running away after being stopped near
the city's eastern limits. According to police reports, Peters was
weaving when he was pulled over. The officer reported that Peters
gave his father's Social Security number, then grabbed ``a small
object'' as he climbed from the car. When the officer spun Peters
forward in an attempt to get the object, Peters elbowed the officer
and escaped, according to reports.
</P>
<P>
   According to a police report, the officer was injured and his
uniform was damaged.
</P>
<P>
   He was arrested about five hours later by a Warren County
sheriff's deputy and taken to the county jail. On Wednesday, he was
held and bail was set at $50,000. He is charged with driving under
suspension, resisting arrest, falsification and assault.
</P>
<P>
   If convicted of the assaulting charge, Peters faces up to 18
months in prison.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, his employer, Alan Aronson, was trying to help
Peters.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really surprised. The only person he continues to hurt
is himself,'' said Aronson.
</P>
<P>
   Centerville lawyer Bill Knapp said he would be try to convince
the court to reduce Peters' bail amount.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not sure exactly what happened just yet,'' Knapp said.

IBM PREPARING TO SEEK ROLE IN COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By STEVE LOHR   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   IBM is making a bid to become a leading supplier of technology
to the communications industry, a move that is another step in the
company's campaign to tap the Internet market.
</P>
<P>
   The company is detailing its plan on Thursday with the
introduction of a new line of semiconductors for network equipment,
the creation of a communications research center and an alliance
intended to encourage the spread of industry-standard software in
telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
   The IBM move comes only two days after it announced a deal with
Cisco Systems, the leading producer of specialized computers for
relaying data traffic over the Internet. Cisco said it would
purchase $2 billion in parts like chips from IBM over the next five
years, and it also agreed to pay IBM for the use of its
intellectual property in networking.
</P>
<P>
   The current IBM plan for the Internet-era communications market
seems sound, analysts say. It is an extension of its accelerating
effort to exploit its industry-leading computer expertise in disk
drives, chips and flat-panel display screens by selling those parts
to other companies. So far this year, IBM has announced parts-sale
deals totaling $30 billion over the next seven years with companies
including Dell Computer, Acer, EMC and Cisco.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts noted that while its strategy is a good one, there
is an element of defeat in its parts deal with Cisco. IBM was once
the leader in the computer networking business that Cisco now
dominates. Yet Cisco, they say, moved to make sure that its data
routers adopted networking technology that could communicate with
different kinds of computers and over the Internet. IBM, by
contrast, clung too long to its own proprietary technology.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cisco would have never been alive if IBM had paid attention to
this business,'' said Howard Anderson, managing director of the
Yankee Group, a research firm. ``IBM bungled what was one of the
biggest market opportunities in communications in decades.''
</P>
<P>
   With its current strategy, IBM faces formidable competitors. The
Intel Corp. on Wednesday announced its own chip entry in the
communications market, and it is in head-to-head competition with
the IBM product. Both companies are introducing a ``network
processor,'' which Intel and IBM are marketing as nimbler, cheaper
alternatives to the custom chips that now power routers and
switches on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The new chips from Intel and IBM are programmable _ more like
the general-purpose microprocessors used in computers _ so that
changes can be made in the software to speed up or redirect the
flow of data packets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Companies are realizing the flexibility that software can
bring to this market,'' said Kevin Reardon, director of strategy
for IBM's technology group.
</P>
<P>
   The telecommunications customers that have already placed orders
for IBM's network processors include Alcatel, Newbridge Networks
and Nortel.
</P>
<P>
   IBM's renowned research laboratories, analysts say, could give
it an edge in supplying the communications market. In the last two
years, IBM has come up with a series of advances in semiconductor
development and manufacturing that enable it to make chips that
consume less power and run at higher speeds, both big potential
advantages.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's true that IBM should have been Cisco in this market,
though that's also true of AT&AMP;T,'' noted G. Dan Hutcheson,
president of VLSI Research, a research firm in San Jose, Calif.
``But the situation today is that IBM is an outstanding R&AMP;D house
and a really good silicon shop. And in the long run, that could
give IBM tremendous leverage in this new world.''
</P>
<P>
   To focus its research, IBM is establishing a Communications
Research and Development Center, comprised of scientists at its
labs in Switzerland, Israel and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   And to try to encourage the adoption of industry-standard
software for the programmable chips, IBM said it would support the
open architecture announced by the C-Port Corp. in February. In
addition, IBM said that C-Port, a start-up company in North
Andover, Mass., had selected IBM to build its C-5 network
processor. For IBM, the manufacturing pact with a coming rival in
the new field is another way that the computer giant is selling its
expertise.

MUSEUM PRESERVES CONTRACEPTIVES OF YORE
</HEADLINE>
 
(EDS: Sider to BIRTH-CONTROL) (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CAROLYN POIROT 
c.1999 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   The perfect contraceptive remains elusive, but we've come a long
way since women in China drank mercury to combat fertility 4,000
years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Women have also, over the course of time, swallowed carrot seeds
and sipped alcoholic teas brewed from dried beaver testicles to
prevent pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   And, in the second century, they used vaginal plugs made of
gummy agents such as honey combined with the dung of crocodiles and
elephants, according to one display at the History of Contraception
Museum in Toronto.
</P>
<P>
   And that's all just the beginning of a long human (but sometimes
hardly humane) history of birth control methods that vary from the
practical to the practically silly.
</P>
<P>
   The history of the IUD dates back at least 3,000 years when,
according to legend, smooth pebbles were inserted into the uteruses
of camels to prevent them from becoming pregnant during long desert
crossings. Cervical caps gained popularity with Casanova, who in
the mid-1700s advocated the use of half a squeezed lemon to cap the
human cervix and prevent conception.
</P>
<P>
   What is probably the first-ever written prescription for birth
control dates back to 1550 B.C. and is carefully printed out on a
scroll of papyrus on display at the contraceptive museum:
</P>
<P>
   ``To make a woman cease to become pregnant for one year, two
years or three years, tips of acacia and dates are triturated with
honey. Seed wool is moistened therewith and placed in her vulva.''
</P>
<P>
   The prescription from the Ebers Papyrus may actually have been
effective, says Percy Skuy, a past president of the Ortho-McNeil
drug company and founder of the museum.
</P>
<P>
   ``Acacia is a gum which breaks down to lactic acid, a known
spermicide that's even used today in some contraceptive jellies,''
Skuy points out in ``Tales of Contraception,'' his chronicle of the
museum and its unusual artifacts.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the ages, people have pursued the right to control
fertility, Skuy says. He began collecting contraceptive artifacts
as a product manager for Ortho Pharmaceutical, a company
specializing in the manufacture of family planning products.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've had to search long and hard for some of these. People
just didn't save old contraceptives,'' says Walter Masanic,
director of public affairs for Janssen-Ortho, as the company is now
called in Canada. ``It is interesting that people thousands of
years ago were just as interested in controlling their own
fertility as people are today.''
</P>
<P>
   The museum, displaying more than 600 contraceptive items _ 300
IUDs _ is open to the public.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our exhibits come from the strangest places,'' Masanic says.
``We have one 14-karat-gold intracervical device that a lady just
brought to us and said, `This belongs to you.' ''
</P>
<P>
   Her husband had been a pharmacist, and when he died, she sold
the family business. She was removing personal items when she came
across the little gold device, and without knowing what it was, she
had a jeweler drill a hole in it and attach it to her charm
bracelet as a memento.
</P>
<P>
   Several years later, someone at a cocktail party saw the charm
and asked her if she knew what it was. When she learned, she had it
removed, and later took it to the museum to share with the public.

CELLUCCI TO NAME TWO TO HIGHEST COURT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON -- With the opening of the court's session nearly upon
him, Governor Paul Cellucci is expected to announce two nominations
for the Supreme Judicial Court Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   Cellucci, Lieutenant Governor Jane Swift and the governor's
chief legal counsel, Leonard Lewin, were expected to wrap up the
interviews for the vacancies by Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
   One candidate, appeals court Judge Francis Spina, appears to be
a strong contender for one of the slots.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Cellucci would like to announce his decision
sometime Thursday, if background checks on the candidates can be
completed in time.
</P>
<P>
   As he prepares to make the final decision, Cellucci has kept the
process under tight wraps. One source said the governor, as of late
Wednesday, had not made up his mind.
</P>
<P>
   Sources said Cellucci has been impressed by Spina, 52, who is
from Pittsfied. He was appointed to the bench in 1997 by Weld.
</P>
<P>
   But Cellucci is also looking at two other men, Christopher
Armstrong, a 63-year old appeals court justice who was appointed by
governor Francis Sargent, and Daniel Toomey, 55, a Superior Court
judge.
</P>
<P>
   Among the women Cellucci is considering are: Judith Cowin, a
superior court judge appointed by Weld and a former prosecutor with
strong Republican credentials; Margaret Sosman, 48, a superior
court judge who founded an all-woman law firm in Boston; Cynthia
Cohen, 50, a civil litigator with a Boston law firm; and Margot
Botsford, 52, a superior Court judge who was appointed by former
governor Michael S. Dukakis.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile Wednesday, in a suprise move, the governor's council
delayed until at least next week setting a hearing date for
Cellucci's nominee to be chief justice of the court, Margaret
Marshall. Cellucci said councilors were ``dragging their feet'' and
he tweaked them for trying to gain some media attention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that would be unfortunate, particularly given the
quality of this nomination,'' Cellucci said. ``This is probably
their moment in the spotlight.''
</P>
<P>
   Council Michael Callahan, who represents Marshall's district,
said he had not had a chance to talk with her and therefore wanted
to wait a week before setting a date.

AUDIT SUGGESTS MINORITY, POOR STUDENTS BEING DUMPED IN ALTERNATIVE
PROGRAMS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By KATHY WALT 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ The state's alternative education programs _
where violent and chronically misbehaving students are supposed to
be sent _ have become dumping grounds for minority and poor
students, a new state audit suggests.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, school officials do not consistently remove violent
students _ even those who bring knives and firearms to school _
from regular classrooms to alternative school settings as required
by law, nor do they test these troubled students to see if they are
learning, according to a state auditor's report on Texas' Safe
Schools Program.
</P>
<P>
   The report, released Wednesday, is based on preliminary data
from the 1997-98 school year, the second year of operation of
alternative education campuses. The state spent about $50 million
on the two programs in that year.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, under the Safe Schools Act, the Texas Legislature
established two types of school settings for troubled youths _
juvenile justice and disciplinary alternative education programs.
The Juvenile Justice Alternative Education Programs, or JJAEP,
exist in the state's 22 largest counties and are overseen by the
Juvenile Probation Commission; each school district must operate
its own disciplinary alternative education program, or DAEP, which
is overseen by the Texas Education Agency.
</P>
<P>
   The auditor's report, however, found that by the second year of
operation, minority, poor, special-education and students at risk
of dropping out of school had already become disproportionately
represented in alternative education programs.
</P>
<P>
   That does not come as a surprise to some.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expected that a disproportionate number of students that we
would serve unfortunately would be represented by minority
populations, and that has been borne out,'' said David Wingard, who
runs Harris County's Juvenile Justice Alternative Education Program
_ the largest of its kind in the state with 934 students in the
1997-98 school year. That expectation, he added, is explainable in
large part by socio-economic factors.
</P>
<P>
   ``Minorities as a whole are disproportionately poor,'' Wingard
said. ``Income relates directly to academic achievement. We all
know that. Kids who are frustrated academically tend to act up, and
poor people tend to be powerless to fight the system.''
</P>
<P>
   Wingard added, however, that Harris county officials ``have
tried to do everything we know we can do'' to ensure that its
program does not become a dumping ground for minorities.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the auditor's report found that while minorities constitute
55 percent of all Texas public school students, they account for 72
percent of all students in juvenile justice programs and 64 percent
in the school district-run disciplinary programs.
</P>
<P>
   ``While some programs' large percentage of minority students
merely reflects the composition of the community, it may point to
inconsistent application of discipline policies as well,'' the
report states.
</P>
<P>
   The report also concludes that the law designed to make Texas
classrooms safer may not be achieving that goal because school
districts do not always expel violent students to JJAEPs.
</P>
<P>
   For example, auditors found at least 850 on-campus incidents
during the 1997-98 school year in which school officials did not
expel students to juvenile justice programs as required by law.
Those 850 incidents included 255 instances in which students
carried illegal knives to school; 218 other instances in which
students had weapons such as explosives and brass knuckles; 196
incidents of aggravated assault and 74 firearms incidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some school officials base their expulsion or removal
decisions on local criteria that differ from the (law), while
others may be unaware of them,'' the report states. ``As a result,
some students who commit serious and violent offenses remain in
regular classrooms.''
</P>
<P>
   Under Texas law, JJAEPs serve expelled students who commit
serious or violent offenses and DAEPs serve students who are
removed from their regular classrooms for disruptive behavior or
felonies committed off campus. DAEPs may be located on the regular
school campus or elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   Auditors also faulted the alternative education programs for
failing to track student performance to determine if they are
learning or improving their behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Such practices, the auditors said, increase ``the risk of
charges of discrimination, inequity and civil rights violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Wingard, of the Harris County JJAEP, said his program measures
student performance in a variety of ways.
</P>
<P>
   ``We spend a lot of money and a lot of effort to make sure that
the students are academically well served, and well served from the
standpoint of a lot of the social factors that negatively impact on
them.''
</P>
<P>
   Wingard added that he has long been troubled by the lack of
academic standards required of DAEPs under TEA regulations. TEA,
for example, has allowed alternative programs to be rated on
performance measures other than the state-mandated Texas Assessment
of Academic Skills test.
</P>
<P>
   Under the alternative accountability process, he added,
alternative education programs could be rated acceptable even
though their students may not be getting credit for their courses
because they miss too much school.
</P>
<P>
   TEA spokeswoman Debbie Graves Ratcliffe said the agency expects
some of the auditor's findings to change once complete data is
available. For example, some school districts miscoded student
disciplinary incidents, thus falsely inflating the number of
expellable offenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who send in the reports tend to be clerks who may not
have'' all the training on the Safe Schools Act requirements that
school administrators and teachers get, Ratcliffe added.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcliffe added that TEA agrees with many of the audit's
findings and has already begun to implement the recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   Among the auditor's recommendations are calls for:
</P>
<P>
   _ Uniform measurements for alternative education programs,
including graduation and recidivism rates.
</P>
<P>
   _ TEA review of the criteria schools use for placing students in
alternative programs
</P>
<P>
   _ The establishment of more accurate data reporting methods.
</P>
<P>
   _ Additional training of school employees on the Safe Schools
Act.

 &HT;    Umpires left feeling blue
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ With the last pitch in the last inning of the last
game Wednesday night, baseball changed. Blue turned a lighter
shade.
</P>
<P>
   The resignations of 22 umpires _ some of them the most
experienced arbiters in the game _ become official after the
conclusion of Wednesday's schedule, initiating an unprecedented job
turnover in the most demanding officiating job in American sport.
</P>
<P>
   The late Bill Klem, the first umpire admitted to the Hall of
Fame, was correct in his famed observance, ``It ain't nothin' 'til
I call it.'' Any ump worth a whisk broom can call this one only an
unadulterated mess.
</P>
<P>
   Plotting last July to improve job security via mass
resignations, the Major League Baseball Umpires Association has
instead facilitated the departure of nearly one-third of its
membership. Some of those departures _ NL strike zone phantom Eric
Gregg; AL veteran Richie Garcia, who blew the Jeffrey Maier home
run call in the 1996 ALCS and then signed autographs the next day _
do not seem ill-timed.
</P>
<P>
   Others are more painful. AL veteran Drew Coble has been tending
to his wife and her bout with terminal cancer. NL veteran Terry
Tata has worked seven postseason series in the 1990s alone. Both
resignations were accepted.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-five minor-league umpires stand signed and ready to step
into full-time jobs today. Throughout, there have been reports
through the umps' grapevine that many resignees will be hired back,
that it is posturing before real contract talks begin in the
offseason.
</P>
<P>
   ``Baseball has just had so many labor issues over the years,''
Hall of Famer George Brett said. ``Each one has caused work
stoppages and lock-outs and a cancellation of a World Series. It
took years for baseball to rebound from that. I don't think it can
afford another black eye.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now, what is the solution? I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   Nor do most umps.
</P>
<P>
   Here are stories about two men caught in the middle.
</P>
<P>
   Welcome, rook
</P>
<P>
   Paul Nauert took out a loan 13 years ago and went to umpiring
school on a dare from a friend. He failed to get his certification
and slunk back to his Louisville home to work Little League games
and repay the loan, aware only that umpiring was ``the most
intriguing thing I'd ever come across.''
</P>
<P>
   A year later _ after securing another loan _ Nauert returned to
become a top qualifier out of Harry Wendelstedt's Florida ump
school and went straight into the minors, setting a course that
finally last April 1 landed him one of two vacant major-league
jobs. He cried when he got the news.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, he did not cry when he was informed in July his
resignation had been accepted by the National League.
</P>
<P>
   ``You learn how to shut out the distractions and put everything
out of your mind,'' he said. ``To say you don't think about
(resigning) is really not true because you do think about it. But
I've always approached this job as professional as possible. It's
something I dearly enjoy, to the point that I love doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Nauert, who has lived in Atlanta since 1990, just celebrated the
birth of his and wife Kim's third child, Danielle, in June. A
first-year umpire draws $75,000 a year and now they could afford to
buy their first home. Nauert has no qualms with this initial
experience with his union.
</P>
<P>
   ``These guys laid their lives on the line in 1979 (in an earlier
strike) for older umpires and I'll lay my life on the line for
these guys,'' he said. ``They all need to be back on the field,
including myself.''
</P>
<P>
   Nauert has received strong marks for his work this year, leaving
some wondering what baseball's front office motives really are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've seen a lot of young umpires come and go,'' said Jerry
Crawford, his crew chief. ``This kid is the absolute prototype of
what baseball is trying to hire.''
</P>
<P>
   Nauert declines to question his fate. His mother was just 53
when she died of cancer in 1993, leaving him with an object lesson
in how harshly life can treat the living. Now 36, he will be
recalling that lesson tonight
</P>
<P>
   A call from New York
</P>
<P>
   The general manager of the Columbus Clippers had just sent to
the umpires' dressing room for Marvin Hudson. He was back working
the Class AAA International League that night of July 22, after
returning from a fill-in job in the majors.
</P>
<P>
   Hudson has progressed quickly. This season is just his eighth as
a professional umpire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd just gotten back from Montreal that day,'' he said. ``It
was about 15 minutes before walking out on the field when I got
called up to the GM's office. I thought I was going up there
because they were expecting a rain delay or something.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he just said Mr. Coleman had called and wanted me to call
him back. And I had to work the plate that night, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Coleman'' was National League president Len Coleman, and
the returned call later than night bore an invitation for Hudson to
become a full-time NL ump.
</P>
<P>
   His work would begin today.
</P>
<P>
   ``It took me by total surprise,'' Hudson said. ``I had the
answer that night, but I also wanted to make a couple phone
calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Hudson has been calling baseball since he was a student at
Marietta High School in the early 1980s, working T-ball games on
the weekends. A four-year career as a catcher at Piedmont College _
he had a failed tryout with the Braves _ had confirmed his feel for
the game and though he set out hoping just to work local prep and
college games, older umps advised that he shoot a little higher.
The period between Joe Brinkman's umpire school and Coleman's phone
call passed quickly. ``Getting the job the way I got it, that's not
the way you want to go about getting it. But I'm here,'' said
Hudson, married for 16 years with two children. ``I want the guys
to get their jobs back, just as bad as anyone who's been up here
all year. I don't want to see anybody lose their job.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as me and my family, I haven't celebrated yet. And I
won't celebrate until the other guys get their jobs back.''

 By W.H. STICKNEY JR.  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
NEW YORK _ The instant the 1999 WNBA finalists had been
established, someone from the league should have dashed to a store
for napkins, party hats and souvenirs with the inscription ``Old
Home Week.''
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Comets and the New York Liberty, opponents tonight in Game 1
of the best-of-three WNBA Championship Series at Madison Square
Garden, are quite familiar with this little gathering. They were
the first two teams to tussle for a title in 1997, the WNBA's
start-up year.
</P>
<P>
   At that time, the championship was a single-game affair, and the
Comets won 65-51 at Compaq Center.
</P>
<P>
   ``That year was very special,'' Comets guard Cynthia Cooper said
Wednesday. ``It was the inaugural season, the first of any kind. It
was the first time in America that you had a major professional
women's basketball league, actually two leagues (including the
now-defunct American Basketball League).
</P>
<P>
   ``We were going to make history. We were writing our names in
the history books. This is two years later, and we're facing New
York again.''
</P>
<P>
   As has been the case this year, when the Comets went 26-6 in the
regular season and beat the Los Angeles Sparks in the Western
Conference finals, the Comets in '97 were the class of the league
(18-10) and beat Charlotte to advance to the championship against
New York.
</P>
<P>
   It was close through the first half. Then Cooper, Tina Thompson,
Kim Perrot and the rest of the Comets really went to work over the
final 20 minutes to claim the inaugural title trophy.
</P>
<P>
   There was joy throughout the organization. Leslie Alexander's
belief in Van Chancellor, the ``fifth choice'' for coach whom
Alexander hired with implicit instructions to turn the Comets into
a winner, had been confirmed.
</P>
<P>
   Chancellor delivered the third world championship in four years
to Alexander, whose Rockets had prevailed in the 1994 and 1995 NBA
Finals.
</P>
<P>
   So often denied the trip to the NCAA Women's Final Four he
wanted badly through 19 seasons as coach at Mississippi, Chancellor
finally had his cherished diamond-and-gold ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time I look at that ring, I just get happy,'' Chancellor
said. ``It symbolizes so much for me. We've got two rings now, and
I still wear that first one.''
</P>
<P>
   The quest is on now for a third ring, ``No. 3 for No. 10,'' a
tribute to Perrot, who died of cancer Aug. 19.
</P>
<P>
   It's uppermost in the mind of Sheryl Swoopes. So, too, is the
chance to party with a familiar foe in an effort to salve some
personal wounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first year when we played New York in the championship, I
didn't really contribute. I didn't have a whole lot to do with us
winning the title that year,'' said Swoopes, who sat out the first
half of 1997 to give birth to her son. ``To me, this one's a little
more special and maybe even a bigger challenge for me personally,
to come out here tomorrow and kind of set the tone for the whole
series. We want to, hopefully, jump on them early.''
</P>
<P>
   That would be a departure from the way the Comets began the
Western Conference finals against the Sparks. Still drained
emotionally from the death of Perrot, the Comets were easy fodder
and lost Game 1 75-60. They've done a 180 since.
</P>
<P>
   ``This team for the last few games has been playing in a way
that Kim would like to see,'' Chancellor said. ``They've faced all
kinds of obstacles and never once gave up. We were down by nine
points to LA (in the first half of Game 3 Monday night) and found a
way to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the way Kim played. She never gave up. She never gave
in.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Cooper: ``I don't know exactly why teams can't knock us
out, even though I don't think that's exactly true. Teams have come
out and played extremely well and beat us. It's been proven that we
are beatable, we are human.
</P>
<P>
   ``So what we have to do is maintain our composure, concentration
and focus. And we've been able to do that. We've done it more
consistently maybe than other teams have done that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we're one of the more talented teams in the league.
But talent means nothing unless you play with heart. And I think
this team has a lot of heart and has demonstrated that throughout
our short WNBA career.''
</P>
<P>
   When the Garden lights go on tonight, Thompson believes
vengeance will be on the minds of the Liberty.
</P>
<P>
   ``They could have been the first-ever WNBA champions, so there
might be a little bit of personal feelings there,'' she said.
``It'll definitely bring a lot of emotions to the series. They came
out and played hard (in 1997) and played us tough. I think we
expect the same thing in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   The Comets-Liberty rivalry actually began early in the '97
season, when the teams were both in the Eastern Conference and
played each other three times over the first 10 days of the season.
It received a bit more fuel this year.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets and Liberty played twice in the preseason, each
winning at home, then faced off twice more during the regular
season.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets played dreadfully in a 74-71 road loss Aug. 8,
turning the ball over seven times in the final six minutes. But it
had been a quite different story at Compaq Center on July 3. The
Comets held New York to 15 first-half points and 50 overall. The
Liberty hit just 21.9 percent of its shots from the field, a WNBA
record low.
</P>
<P>
   The Comets and Liberty are tied at 5 in the overall series. But
the Comets own that pleasant 1-0 edge in the playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not even thinking about 1997,'' Chancellor said. ``I'm
thinking about, `Can we beat the New York Liberty, right here in
Madison Square Garden, the toughest environment for us?'
</P>
<P>
   ``I enjoyed (the first title game with New York), but all their
players have forgotten about that.''
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe not. Let the party begin.

MARSHALS ACTING ON RENO'S ORDERS SEIZE WACO TAPE FROM THE FBI
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Wednesday ordered
U.S. Marshals to the FBI's headquarters to seize a previously
undisclosed tape recording of voice communications between FBI
commanders and field agents during the ill-fated tear-gas assault
at the Branch Davidian compound, Justice Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The recording contains the voices of agents asking for and
receiving authorization from their operational commanders at Waco,
Texas, to fire flammable military tear-gas rounds at a covered
bunker not far from the main Branch Davidian compound several hours
before a deadly fire ignited, leaving about 80 people dead.
</P>
<P>
   Even before the latest disclosure, Reno had decided to open an
independent investigation of the 1993 siege, and officials said
Wednesday that she planned to name a prominent figure to head the
inquiry, making her choice from a short list that included
Republicans, among them former senators, law-enforcement officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's list of people under consideration does not include any
present or former officials of the Justice Department or the FBI.
The officials said that Reno had added and subtracted names in
recent days from a list that has at times included former
Republican senators John Danforth of Missouri and Warren Rudman of
New Hampshire. Another candidate is Dan K. Webb, a prominent
Chicago lawyer who was a highly successful Republican-appointed
federal prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   Before Wednesday's extraordinary order to the marshals to take
custody of evidence from the FBI, Reno was said by subordinates to
be furious when she was told of the existence of a tape that had
remained hidden in FBI files for more than six years. It was
discovered on Saturday at the FBI's training academy in Quantico,
Va., in the offices of the Hostage Rescue Team, the unit that was
heavily criticized for its tactics in carrying out the Waco
assault, law-enforcement officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman, said Wednesday
night that the Justice Department did not know of the tape's
existence until that day. ``The FBI informed the Department that it
had come across the material in Quantico, Va.,'' he said. ``On
learning of the discovery of the material, senior officials of the
Justice Department immediately directed the marshals to take
posession of and inventory the materials at the FBI's
headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the tape represents another deeply wounding
blow to the credibility of Reno and FBI officials who had said
repeatedly in the years since the operation that they had unearthed
all relevant information about the assault before concluding that
there was no possiblity that the FBI had caused the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The recording is on the audio track of an infrared videotape
that picked up heat images from inside the compound. The tape was
made by an aircraft flying over the site at the time the tear-gas
canisters were launched at the bunker. Law-enforcement officials
said the tape supports their account that the flammable canisters
bounced harmlessly off the bunker's roof and could not have ignited
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Arson investigators had found evidence that gasoline, charcoal
lighter fluid and camp stove fuel had been poured inside the wooden
structure, and they said that the fire appeared to have started in
three places. The FBI also cited evidence from listening devices
that recorded ambiguous conversation of Davidians discussing
possible plans for a fire just hours before the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the disclosure of the use of two incendiary
military tear-gas rounds prompted an uproar that has forced Reno to
announce that she would reopen a long-closed internal inquiry into
the operation.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual scene Wednesday afternoon at FBI headquarters,
agents from the marshal's service arrived at the J. Edgar Hoover
Building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the FBI's headquarters across the
street from the Justice Department, to take the tape and related
materials. The step was said by officials to be taken as a rebuke
by Reno to the bureau for its failures to turn over information
related to the central question of who started the deadly fire.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's action seemed almost certain to further strain the
increasingly uneasy relationship between Reno and FBI Director
Louis J. Freeh. Earlier in Reno's tenure, the two were close
allies, but their relationship, while publicly cordial, has
privately soured over several issues, most recently this week after
Freeh's aides announced his desire for an independent inquiry into
Waco before Reno announced her own support for it.
</P>
<P>
   At the FBI, officials said that they were embarrassed by the
discovery, but did not try to conceal it. They said it had been
unearthed during a thorough search of the offices of the hostage
rescue unit, which is now part of a larger group called the
Critical Incident Response Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI located important items and brought them to the
attention the Justice Department,'' said John Collingwood, an FBI
spokesman. ``We are cooperating fully with the effort to identify
and preserve anything that may bear on the firing of the military
gas rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the FBI did not object to the marshal service action.
``We are in full agreement that the FBI not maintain possession of
anything located that may bear on the issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, senior Republicans in Congress are considering
a separate, exhaustive investigation that would examine the
government's conduct during the entire Waco episode, and not be
limited to the final day of the siege at the Branch Davidian
compound that ended in a fire in which about 80 cult members died,
many of them children.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said he would soon introduce legislation to establish a
wide-ranging investigation of the events at Waco. Hyde's
legislation would establish a five-member investigative commission
that would examine everything that happened during the government's
handling of the Waco matter, including but not restricted to the
fateful raid in which fire consumed the Davidians main structure.
</P>
<P>
   The commission could take more than a year to complete its work
and would be aimed, in the words of a Hyde assistant, ``at insuring
that this matter is put to rest once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide, Sam Stratman, said that the commission would try to
``find out everything that happened, everything. We would want to
get the definitive answers so that we are not having to deal with
new conspiracy theories in years to come based on newly emerging
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressionally authorized commission would likely have
subpoena power and a generous budget. The Democratic and Republican
leaders of the House and the Senate would each choose a member.
Those four, in turn, would select the fifth member who would be the
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   And just as Reno is looking for someone with a solid reputation
for probity to lead the Department's efforts, it is likely that the
Congress would seek to have the commission members, especially the
chairman, be people with impeccable credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic officials in Congress Wednesday said that they
might not support the commission that Hyde is contemplating if
Reno's investigation appears to be credible and sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Epstein, the Democratic staff director of the House
Judiciary Committee, said that there would be no need for two
competing investigations and the Reno effort should take precedence
over any by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have an outside independent investigation by
individuals who have unquestioned credentials and expertise,'' said
Epstein, who is a top aide to Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the
ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that the attorney general is going to appoint such a
person or persons and so long as that is so,'' Epstein said. ``The
legislation for a congressional commission would be moot.''
Similarly, some senior advisers to Republican leaders said it was
unclear that there would be support for such a wide-ranging
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The recent revelations that some incendiary devices were used on
the day of the siege, despite years of denials, has also spawned a
third likely investigation, by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., that could
lead to public hearings as early as next month, his spokesman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, chairman of the House Committee on government Reform,
Wednesday sent committee subpoenas to the White House, FBI and
Justice Department demanding all records, phone logs, faxes and any
communications those agencies had with the siege headquarters at
Waco at the time of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Burton had on Tuesday subpoenaed the same information from the
Defense Department and a federal prosecutor in Texas long involved
in Waco matters.
</P>
<P>
   A major problem for any new inquiry into Waco, senior
law-enforcement officials agree, is that most of the major players
are locked into sworn testimony about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, at least one unanswered question: Which
officials at what level decided to play down and thereby
effectively conceal the use of the incendiary tear gas devices?
</P>
<P>
   Some bureau officials have said that they believe no one
deliberately concealed anything but rather thought the use of the
pyrotechnic devices were not material to the assault on the
compound and were in no way related to the fatal fire. The grenades
were fired six hours before the fire started and were directed not
at the residence that burned, but at a nearby bunker.
</P>
<P>
   No official, not even Reno, has suggested that they now believe
that the tear-gas grenades contributed to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Arson investigators found evidence that gasoline, charcoal
lighter fluid and camp stove fuel had been poured inside the wooden
structure, and they said that the fire appeared to have started in
three places. The FBI also cited evidence from listening devices
that included recordings of Davidians discussing plans for a fire
just hours before the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The expiration of the independent counsel law in June would have
no impact on the effort to mount an independent review of Waco,
officials said, because the Justice Department inquiry would not be
a prosecutor's task but more akin to blue-ribbon investigative
panel. If anyone were to be found to have committed a possible
crime of concealment or anything else, that person could then be
prosecuted by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said through a spokesman Wednesday that his inquiry was
needed to determine ``whether the Justice Department misled the
American people and Congress.'' The spokesman, John Williams, said
that Burton's inquiry would focus on three issues: the use of
incendiary devices, the possible use of military personnel in the
assault on the compound, which is prohibited by law, and
accusations that a helicopter used by the FBI fired on the compound
just hours before the fatal assault.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations about the use of the military and an FBI
helicopter have been spread on the Internet and elsewhere by the
wide assortment of Waco conspiracy enthusiasts. ``We have no firm
evidence of any of these allegations,'' Williams said, adding that
Burton believes it is necessary to investigate them.

HILTON HOTELS DISCUSSES DEAL WITH PROMUS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Tenn . )  (dal) 
 By EDWIN McDOWELL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Hilton Hotels Corp., which was left standing at the altar
after its two most recent attempts to buy other hotel companies, on
Wednesday confirmed that it was in talks to acquire the Promus
Hotel Corp.
</P>
<P>
   Although both companies declined to disclose details of the
negotiations, which were reported Wednesday in the Wall Street
Journal, Promus has a market value of $2.5 billion, and a deal
would most likely be worth more than that.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton, which has about 275 hotels, had net income of $298
million last year on revenue of $1.77 billion. Promus, based in
Memphis, had net income of $154 million on revenue of $1.1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Hilton fell 56.25 cents on Wednesday, to $11.6875,
while Promus rose $2.9375, to $32.
</P>
<P>
   Promus is one of the largest hotel companies in the United
States, according to Business Travel News, the trade publication.
Its holdings range from limited-service properties to suites and
full-service properties. Its hotels include Doubletree, Red Lion,
Embassy Suites, Hampton Inn and Homewood Suites. The Promus brands
are scattered throughout the United States but are also expanding
in Canada, Mexico and Central and South America.
</P>
<P>
   The Promus portfolio consists of about 1,000 franchised
properties, almost 200 properties under management contracts, and
ownership of 62 properties. Its 192,000 rooms rank it eighth, well
behind giants like the Cendant Corp. (529,000); Bass Hotels and
Resorts, the owner of Holiday Inns (462,500), and Marriott
International (328,300).
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Promus have been in a slump since late May, when the
company lowered its earnings-per-share growth rate to single digits
from the midteens. The main reason for lowering the estimate was
Promus' difficulties in trying to rebrand many Red Lion Inns and
Hotels as Doubletrees. Doubletree Hotels, Guest Suites and Resorts
bought Red Lion in 1996, and Promus merged with Doubletree in
December 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton properties, most of which carry the Hilton name, are
among the favorites of business travelers. And while the
acquisition would give Hilton a broad range of properties, some
analysts wonder about the fit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although it is not easy for us to see how the companies would
fit together, their potential union is not the strangest concept we
have ever contemplated,'' said Jason Ader, an analyst at Bear
Stearns.
</P>
<P>
   Bjorn Hanson of PricewaterhouseCoopers said that although the
deal at reported levels ``would be dilutive to Hilton's
shareholders,'' it would also be Hilton's entry into the
extended-stay market, a fast-growing segment that encompasses
guests who spend at least five nights.
</P>
<P>
   Hilton lost the bidding for the ITT Corp. in 1997 and for
Wyndham International, formerly Patriot American, this year.

</P>
<P>
   H&AMP;R Block said that it had agreed to buy Olde Financial, the
parent of the nation's fourth-largest discount brokerage firm, for
$850 million in cash, intensifying its push to become a broad-based

</P>
<P>
   The acquisition is the latest in a two-year buying spree by H&AMP;R
Block, which has bought eight accounting firms, two mortgage
brokers and another brokerage firm. Analysts said the purchase made
sense, but investors sent H&AMP;R Block's shares down $4.625, to $51.

index jumped 11.45 points, or four-tenths of a percent, to

H &AMP; R BLOCK TO BUY OLDE FOR $850 MILLION IN CASH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mo., Mich . , Ariz., Calif., New England, Ill.)  (dal) 
 By KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Intensifying its push to become a broad-based provider of
financial services to Middle America, H &AMP; R Block Inc. said
Wednesday that it had agreed to buy the Olde Financial Corp., the
parent of the nation's fourth-largest discount brokerage firm, for
$850 million in cash.
</P>
<P>
   While the acquisition is Block's biggest ever, the company,
which is based in Kansas City, Mo., has been on a spending spree
over the last two years.
</P>
<P>
   During that period, the company, which made its name as a
nuts-and-bolts tax preparation service, has bought eight accounting
firms, two mortgage brokers and Birchtree Financial Services,
another brokerage firm.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the company opened H &AMP; R Block Financial Centers in
four markets during the 1999 tax season. By the end of this year,
it plans to open 70 such offices in Arizona, California, Illinois
and New England, offering financial services, home mortgages and
tax preparation under one roof.
</P>
<P>
   ``With the acquisition of Olde, we will have in place the major
building blocks to achieve our vision of becoming the preferred tax
and financial partner for our clients while offering an attractive
product portfolio for new Block customers,'' Frank L. Salizzoni,
the company's president and chief executive, said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   From a strategic perspective, analysts said, the Olde purchase
makes sense. But investors were less than thrilled, and a big
credit rating agency said the way Block intended to finance the
acquisition was risky.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of Block, which have run up sharply this year, slumped
$4.625, or 8.3 percent, to $51.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the surface, this deal looks like it should be good news,''
said Alexander Paris Jr., an analyst at Barrington Research in
Chicago. ``But the stock had been priced for perfection, and there
is execution risk here.''
</P>
<P>
   Block intends to borrow in the short term to pay for Olde,
adding to its debt load. Company executives said they intended to
put the Option One Mortgage Corp., which Block bought in April 1997
from Fleet Financial Services for $190 million in cash, up for
sale. Proceeds from that sale would be used to retire the debt.
</P>
<P>
   In a statement announcing the acquisition, H &AMP; R Block said
Olde, which is privately held, would add 6 to 8 cents a share in
its 2000 fiscal year, which ends April 30, and 20 to 30 cents a
share in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, the deal raised eyebrows at Moody's Investors
Service. The rating agency placed Block's $1.15 billion under
review Wednesday for possible downgrade.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, Moody's has an A-minus rating on Block's debt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Logically, this deal holds together,'' said Steven Nelson, a
vice president and senior analyst at Moody's. ``But to fund any
sort of acquisition with short-term commercial paper while another
transaction, the sale of Option One, is in flux, is an aggressive
strategy. There have been a number of franchises similar to Option
One that have been put up for sale and have not been sold.''
</P>
<P>
   Olde's brokerage unit, the Olde Discount Corp., based in
Detroit, has 181 offices in 35 states and 1,200 representatives.
The firm has more than 600,000 active accounts.
</P>
<P>
   The company is just emerging from a scandal that last year
resulted in a $7 million settlement of allegations that its
management practices in the early 1990s encouraged its brokers to
defraud investors.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the Securities and Exchange Commission contended
that Olde Discount's brokers promoted high-commission stocks over
lower-commission stocks more suitable to clients' needs. Brokers
who failed to sell their quota of high-commission stocks were
forced to forfeit their clients to other Olde Discount brokers, the
SEC said.
</P>
<P>
   The regulatory agency gave clients who had maintained accounts
with Olde from 1992 through 1995 until March 9 this year to file
claims against Olde Discount for reparations.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to those penalties, the New York Stock Exchange
fined the company $1 million for bribing an exchange official to
obtain waivers of job requirements for more than 285 employees
between 1993 and 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Mark A. Ernst, who was recruited to H &AMP; R Block from American
Express Financial Services in 1998 and is now the company's chief
operating officer, said in a telephone interview that Olde's
problems were behind it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the mid-1990s, they made wholesale management changes and
changed the culture throughout the organization,'' he said. ``We
did extensive due diligence to make sure those issues are well
behind the firm.''
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said Ernst's experience at American Express would be
critical in determining the success of H &AMP; R Block's
diversification drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Ernst is a highly qualified executive, one who was an
architect of American Express' foray into many of these same
markets,'' Paris said. ``He has done this before as part of a team.
Now, he will be doing this on his own.'' &QL;

 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ten years ago, at age 21 and with a promising medical
career in front of him, Gidone Busch learned that he had an
incurable kidney disease.
</P>
<P>
   It was that knowledge, his family and friends said, that
capsized all the plans he had for his life, driving him on a search
for spiritual enlightenment in Orthodox Judaism and sometimes
sending him skidding into immobilizing depressions.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the time, he was a sweet-natured young man everyone
called Gary, who loved music and the quiet grace of celebrating the
Jewish Sabbath with friends. But Busch could also slide into a
deeply troubled and disoriented world of his own frenetic prayers,
fears and symbols.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides _ often incompatible and impenetrable _ followed
him to his death.
</P>
<P>
   The police officers who shot and killed him in Brooklyn on
Monday evening said Busch, tall and skinny at 6 foot 3 and 159
pounds, attacked them with a hammer outside his tiny basement
apartment in the Borough Park neighborhood. On that hammer, Busch,
31, a devoutly religious man who prayed so loudly the neighbors
complained, had carved the four Hebrew letters signifying the name
of God.
</P>
<P>
   A Brooklyn grand jury will begin hearing evidence next week to
determine whether the shooting of Busch by police was legally
justified, officials said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Brooklyn District Attorney Charles Hynes said that a grand jury
would be convened on Tuesday to examine the circumstances
surrounding the shooting. ``The facts and circumstances of this
incident warrant a careful review by the grand jury,'' Hynes said
in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   The grand jury will look at the crucial nine-minute period
between the time police received a 911 call about a threatening man
wielding a hammer and the time the officers who responded called
for an ambulance to take Busch to a hospital, a law-enforcement
official said. The jury will also examine Busch's mental history
and see how well he was served by the mental health establishment.
</P>
<P>
   ``In his good times, he was an outgoing fellow and would talk
and sing psalms around the Sabbath table,'' said Rabbi Yakov
Saacks, the director of the Chai Center in Dix Hills, N.Y., where
Busch grew up in suburban comfort on Long Island. ``In his bad
times, perhaps when he wasn't taking his medication, he didn't look
up from his prayer book or his food.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were two different Gary Busches,'' the rabbi added. ``I
loved them both.''
</P>
<P>
   As they prepared for his funeral, Busch's family said he was a
gentle, if distressed, young man who never hurt anyone.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a mental illness, no question about it,'' said his
father, Norman Busch, a retired dentist living in the Long Island
town of Bay Shore. ``But he was not a violent person. He was never
violent.''
</P>
<P>
   But Busch was hospitalized involuntarily for psychiatric
treatment three times at a hospital on Long Island, where doctors
said he had made threats to his parents and evinced signs of
paranoid schizophrenia. Two years ago, he entered a residential
program for the mentally ill in Borough Park, but soon checked
himself out against the advice of doctors who said they did not
believe he was capable of living on his own.
</P>
<P>
   Still, his family said they did not recognize the man portrayed
in published reports since the shooting as behaving so erratically
that his neighbors called police, and as lunging with a hammer.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not what he was or who he is,'' his mother, Doris
Busch Boskey, said, weeping. ``They've created a person to explain
away or excuse what happened and what they did.''
</P>
<P>
   Busch was studying to be a doctor at Mount Sinai Medical School
when he discovered, when all the students tested their own urine
sample as part of a classroom exercise, that he suffered from an
immune system problem. He was given a diagnosis of IgA nephropathy,
a disease that can lead to kidney failure.
</P>
<P>
   Until then, his relatives said, Busch showed no signs of mental
instability. But the diagnosis shook him deeply and kicked off what
his father described as a ``series of incidents.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't that he thought he was going to die,'' recalled his
mother. ``It's just that it couldn't be cured. You constantly
worry. You can lose function of your kidneys, you might need
dialysis. It's on your mind.''
</P>
<P>
   Busch continued his studies for a short time, but in his third
year of medical school, he told his family he wanted to drop out.
He read books on philosophy. He immersed himself in his favorite
classical music and jazz. He talked of finding a spiritual path to
well-being, of exploring the meaning of life. His own religion,
Judaism, called him and he moved to Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Busch spent much of the next seven years there, trying out
different trends and practices within the religion. He studied
Hebrew and the Torah in a conventional Orthodox yeshiva in
Jerusalem. Drawn to the more mystical Hasidic movement, he delved
into the messianic Lubavitch sect.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, his family said, he drifted to the city of Safad in
northern Israel to study at a school dedicated to the mystical
teachings of Rabbi Nachman, founder of the Breslover Hasidic sect
who died in 1810.
</P>
<P>
   The school and its graduates, however, are not associated with
the mainstream Breslover sect, which has shunned them as a fringe
group that has gone too far in making a cult out of the rabbi's
memory. The group is known in Israel for spray-painting Nachman's
name on walls and bouncing up and down, as if in a trance, on
street corners.
</P>
<P>
   Busch threw himself into the group, worrying his relatives back
home.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get involved in the inner circle of a fringe group,
they are very warm and welcoming,'' Saacks said. ``But they had a
very narrow focus. They were only reading Nachman's books, only
discussing his teachings, only telling the message of their teacher
_ which I'm not sure what it is _ and not focusing on much else.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Busch had recently told family and friends that he realized the
group was too extreme and assured them that he was gravitating
toward the more mainstream Breslover Hasidic sect in Brooklyn and
in suburban communities like Lakewood, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   But he seemed drawn, still, into his own sometimes inscrutable
world of extremes, where his absorbing passion for religion turned
into a fervor that seemed to amplify his episodes of mental
instability.
</P>
<P>
   ``He bounced in and out of it,'' Saacks said. ``Last January, he
said he felt he was maybe too entrenched and saw that he had to
pull back. I welcomed that. And on Aug. 8, the last time I spoke to
him, he was back in the Breslov swing of things with `Rebbe Nachman
said this and Rebbe Nachman said that' and this very insular
approach to life.''
</P>
<P>
   What his family saw were periods of quiet, sometimes desperate
depression. His mother said Busch once kicked a hole in the wall of
his room in her house and became very agitated. ``He kept saying,
`I can't believe I did that. I love this house. I grew up in this
house,''' Mrs. Boskey recalled. Her son kept covering the patched
hole with a towel. Shortly after that, he became so depressed he
was hospitalized, she said.
</P>
<P>
   About three weeks ago, Netanya Ullman ran into Busch on the
subway in Manhattan. They had met briefly when both were studying
in Safad five years ago, she said, and when they met again, there
was an instant rapport.
</P>
<P>
   The couple decided to get married, she said, and spoke
constantly of Busch's interpretations of Nachman's teachings.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all about talking to God out loud and going into nature
and praying and very intense meditation,'' Ms. Ullman said.
</P>
<P>
   When he meditated, he would play music very loudly, she said.
Recently, he took to dancing with the hammer, which he called his
staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``He put God's name on it to make it something that would bring
holiness into the world,'' Ms. Ullman said. ``He'd go outside and
dance with it and raise it up and move slowly. He was like bringing
down light from his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was for holy purposes,'' she added. ``He wanted to bring
people closer and his way of doing that was this pushing toward the
boundaries of what's acceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   Busch's behavior drew comments from his neighbors in the
Orthodox Jewish neighborhood where he had moved last December in
the apparent hope of submerging himself in the close-knit religious
culture.
</P>
<P>
   But his family said he usually traveled to Orthodox communities
in upstate New York and New Jersey to celebrate the Sabbath, the
most important and family-centered event of the week for observant
Jews. He did not seem to connect with his neighbors, who said after
the shooting that they regarded Busch as an oddball whose ecstatic
dancing and music did not fit in.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, his parents said that Busch seemed content with his new
life. He had taken a course in computer programming and was
thinking of starting a business designing Web pages. Ms. Ullman
said he told her he wanted to start trading stocks on the Internet
and earn a lot of money.
</P>
<P>
   But there were disturbing signs.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, he stopped by his brother Glenn's law office.
``He seemed agitated, but OK,'' his brother said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ullman said he stopped wearing his prescription eyeglasses.
When police came on Monday night, she suggested, he might not have
seen them as anything more than blurry threatening figures. ``Who
knows what he saw in his mind?'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the tiny basement apartment, police said they found strange
scribblings on signs on the wall. One spelled out the word
``police,'' as ``pointedly off-wing litigating intensely careful
errand-deliverers.''
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, police said, Busch struck a passing car with his
hammer, and when the driver stopped and rolled down his window, he
swung at him and broke his nose.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday evening, someone called 911 to report that a man at
Busch's address was menacing children in the neighborhood. When
officers arrived to question him, they said, he waved the hammer at
them.
</P>
<P>
   His family and friends, outraged by the shooting, said they
believe Busch was frightened and panicked by the armed police
officers. They said he was a spiritual man who wished for nothing
but peace, but often sought it in vain.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was happy with the path he had taken,'' his father said.
``But with mental disease, you do have periods of high emotion and
periods of calm. He was a loving wonderful person, but he was never
violent.''

PROPOSED RULE COULD COVER UP COMMODITY TRADING VOLATILITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The regulator of the nation's commodities markets is proposing a
rule change that would allow commodity trading advisers to smooth
out past returns in the performance records they present to
prospective investors.
</P>
<P>
   The proposal, made by the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
and supported by the industry, could bolster business by making
commodities trading look less prone to wild swings, which have been
known to frighten away potential investors.
</P>
<P>
   Under the proposal, commodity advisers would be able to use a
hypothetical account size to figure their returns for all sales and
promotional materials. Commodity advisers are now required to
calculate their returns based on the actual amount invested _ the
same way returns are calculated across the securities industry. But
commodity advisers would be able to choose a hypothetical account
larger than that chosen by the typical customer _ a size that may
not represent even one customer's account.
</P>
<P>
   Using a hypothetical account, or what the industry calls a
nominal account, that is larger than the typical customer's account
would have the effect of smoothing out the monthly performance of a
manager because his actual gains or losses would be judged as a
percentage of a larger investment base. That would make both losses
and gains smaller in percentage terms than that experienced by most
customers.
</P>
<P>
   George H. Painter, one of two administrative law judges that
hear cases brought before the CFTC, opposes the rule change. Using
a hypothetical account size opens up the possibility of fraud and
unrealistic expectations of good returns with low risk, he said.
``My problem is that adopting this proposal means that they are not
required to disclose the true results of what happened on those
accounts,'' Judge Painter said in an interview. ``It's to enable
CTA's not to disclose a disastrous result of old accounts. It's
absurd.''
</P>
<P>
   The commodities trading industry, which has an estimated $35
billion under management, has advocated a switch to nominal account
size for calculating returns for 12 years. But on Aug. 2, the CFTC
issued such a proposal for the first time. The commission, now
headed by William J. Rainer, has invited public comment on the
matter until Oct. 1.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates of the change say that the rule would help alleviate
the differences in returns that are the result of variations in the
amount of cash an investor borrows for commodities trading. Few
investors put up 100 percent of the recommended account size to
trade commodities. It is estimated that two-thirds of the money
invested in commodities goes into partly funded rather than fully
funded accounts. One of the lures of commodities trading is that
investors need put up only a fraction of a contract's value,
usually 5 to 10 percent, compared with 50 percent for stock
purchases.
</P>
<P>
   I. Michael Greenberger, director of the division of trading and
markets at the commission, said: ``To the extent that the `actual'
amounts invested by a large number of clients are significantly
different within a trading program, it is difficult to identify a
meaningful, useful rate of return for prospective customers. The
CFTC proposal would allow the adviser to base his calculation on
the actual investment strategy recommended, providing uniform,
realistic information to customers with full disclosure about
calculation of the rate of return and risks of investing in the
program.''
</P>
<P>
   And Arthur F. Bell Jr., managing partner of a certified public
accounting firm of the same name in Lutherville, Md., said that the
rule change would bring some discipline to commodity trading
advisers' track records. The rule, he said, ``gives some certainty
of what you're looking at versus looking at numbers depending upon
how much cash an investor has put up. Now you can go from one
trader to the next and have confidence that what you're looking at
was calculated in a similar fashion.''
</P>
<P>
   But critics question why returns in commodities accounts should
use a hypothetical account size and therefore be calculated
differently from other investments, such as mutual funds. Moreover,
allowing commodity trading advisers to choose the account size that
they want to have their performance judged on leaves the
calculations subject to possible manipulation.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, according to opponents, the proposal
would make month-to-month fluctuations in commodities accounts
appear to be smoother and therefore make commodities seem more
conservative as investments. And because one commodities manager
could have a hypothetical account size that is far larger than
another, returns among many managers would not be comparable.
</P>
<P>
   An opponent of the rule is Katherine H. Daigle, assistant
professor of economics and finance at the University of
Mississippi. Ms. Daigle, who was an economist at the CFTC from 1990
through 1994, calls the proposal duplicitous.
</P>
<P>
   The current method of figuring returns is complex and needs to
be improved, she says. But if the commission wants investors to
receive information that is understandable, accurate and complete,
she says, it should require commodity managers to provide
calculations consistent with common practice, meaning returns on
actual funds managed by an adviser.
</P>
<P>
   The rule change, she said, would smooth out a commodity
adviser's returns. ``It's not going to look like they're doing
really badly and not going to look like they're doing really
well,'' she said. ``But from my point of view, investors ought to
be able to see what they really did and make their decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule change also seems at variance with the course taken by
the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has pushed mutual
fund operators to write their performance reports in plain English
that makes it easier to compare results with those of other
managers. Staff members of the CFTC emphasize that the rule would
take effect only after the public's response is assessed. Given the
controversy the proposal has already generated, how the CFTC
handles the rule change may be one of the first signs of where the
commission will go under its new chairman. Rainer, who was sworn in
last month, was a co-founder of Greenwich Capital Markets, a bond
trading firm in Greenwich, Conn. Between 1971 and 1981, Rainer held
various positions at Kidder Peabody &AMP; Co. Rainer declined to
comment on the proposal. &QL;

TEXAS A&AMP;M TO UNVEIL CLONED BULL 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By TODD ACKERMAN 
c.1999 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ A cowboy may never sit astride his back, but there's
still a lot riding on Second Chance.
</P>
<P>
   The 3-week-old calf, a clone of a 21-year-old show bull named
Chance, will be introduced to the world Thursday at Texas A&AMP;M
University in College Station, and then watched, prodded and tested
to determine if he's aging prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   The answer is anxiously awaited by scientists concerned by
recent news that Dolly, Scotland's famous cloned ewe, may be aging
prematurely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the oldest animal ever cloned, one that died of old
age soon thereafter,'' said Jonathan Hill, a research veterinarian
at A&AMP;M College of Veterinary Medicine, which will unveil Second
Chance at Thursday's news conference. ``If ever there were a good
research model to observe DNA showing premature aging, this would
seem to be it.''
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M has long been a leader in animal reproductive technologies,
but the cloning of Chance _ the world's first of a bull _ is the
Aggies' first from an adult cell. Most of A&AMP;M's work has involved
cloning from embryos and genetically altering animals, though it is
currently in the midst of a much-ballyhooed $2.3 million effort to
clone a dog named Missy, the so-called ``Missyplicity Project.''
</P>
<P>
   Chance himself was no stranger to attention in his lifetime. A
Brahman, he starred in the 1997 Kate Capshaw film ``The Locusts,''
appeared on David Letterman and competed in Houston rodeo show
events. He was described as unusually tame.
</P>
<P>
   Chance's owner, Ralph Fisher, suggested A&AMP;M take cells from the
ailing bull when he brought him to the veterinary college about a
year ago. Though it had no plans to clone Chance at the time, A&AMP;M
took the cells. And a month later, using state and private grants,
researchers decided to try cloning him.
</P>
<P>
   Second Chance was born after a successful nine-month pregnancy.
Though its lungs and heart were initially as fragile as those of
premature infants, he is healthy now, said Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's so miraculous, my hair stands on the back of my neck when
I see him,'' said Fisher, a rancher from La Grange, Texas, who
calls Chance a family member and business partner and plans to
mount his hide. ``He's got the same eyes, forehead, big bones _
it's like deja vu.''
</P>
<P>
   According to Fisher, Chance resembled the Brahman bulls that
were imported from India in the 1930s _ big horns, big hump, loose
skin. Because of selective breeding, most bulls in the United
States today have lost much of that skin and usually all of their
horns.
</P>
<P>
   A&AMP;M scientists already have performed and are waiting on the
results of the test to determine if Second Chance's cells show
telltale signs of wear typical of an older animal. Such cells have
shorter ``caps'' than average. The caps, called telomeres, prevent
a cell's DNA from ``fraying,'' which signals the cell to
self-destruct as part of the aging process.
</P>
<P>
   Dolly, for instance, has the DNA of a 6-year-old sheep, even
though it is only 3, an article in the journal Nature reported in
May. A&AMP;M scientists hope to get the results on Second Chance's
cells in about a month, but will continue to do the testing at
least once a year. Fisher will take possession of Second Chance at
6 months.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I think if it passes the first test, it should be all
right,'' said Hill.
</P>
<P>
   Because Chance was so gentle, Hill noted that his cloning should
provide some evidence of how much personality is passed on in the
process. Thus far, Second Chance has been quite tame, said Hill,
but it's too early to tell if that's a result of Chance's DNA or
the inordinate amount of handling he's received.
</P>
<P>
   Hill also said the cloning of Chance is important because a bull
must usually be older before ranchers know if it is likely to
become their best meat producer, an important issue if cloning is
ever going to revolutionize the beef-cattle industry.
</P>
<P>
   Other mammals to be cloned besides Chance include of monkeys,
mice, cows and, of course, Dolly.
</P>

UMPIRES RETAIN PAY, BUT NOT THEIR JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By MURRAY CHASS    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   PHILADELPHIA _ Opting to choose safe over sorry, the umpires
union accepted a settlement with Major League Baseball on Wednesday
that will retain the pay but not the jobs of 22 umpires whose
resignations had been accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The union trumpeted the settlement as a victory, but the
departing umpires, one-third of the union membership, did not get
what they wanted _ the right to continue working as major league
umpires.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed,'' said Mark Johnson, one of nine American
League umpires whose on-field jobs end at 6 a.m. Thursday under the
agreement signed Wednesday at the federal Courthouse here. ``An
umpire wants to umpire and be out on the field. This is a critical
time of the year.''
</P>
<P>
   Richie Garcia, a 25-year American League veteran, said he didn't
feel good either. ``I want to be on the baseball field,'' he said.
``He's taken that away from me. He doesn't want me on the field,
but he's paying me anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Garcia referred to the Commissioner Bud Selig, who came under
heavy fire from the umpires and their union leader, Richie
Phillips. According to Phillips and the union's lead lawyer, Susan
Davis, Selig quashed part of the agreement under which he could
have directed the use of any or all of the 22 umpires during the
remainder of the season and the post-season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is clear,'' said Davis, a New York labor lawyer, ``that
yesterday he would have had the discretion to put the umpires on
the field and this morning it was taken off the table.''
</P>
<P>
   Baseball's lawyers left the courthouse without commenting on the
settlement or any elements of it, and Selig did not return
telephone calls seeking comment on the change the union attributed
to him. But Richard Levin, baseball's spokesman, said baseball's
lawyers had made it clear to the union's lawyers Tuesday night that
every element of the agreement had to be reviewed and approved by
Selig.
</P>
<P>
   The two sides were in U.S. District Court before Judge J. Curtis
Joyner ostensibly for a hearing on the union's request for a
preliminary injunction blocking the National and American leagues
from accepting the umpires' resignations. Joyner, however, urged
them to try to negotiate a settlement.
</P>
<P>
   ``This judge is not letting anyone out of here,'' one of the
lawyers said well into the second day of talks that took place over
16 hours.
</P>
<P>
   In the end, the union decided to play it safe and accept the
settlement, even after Selig's refusal to leave open the
possibility that the umpires could work in the next two months.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still had the 22 guys' lives on the line,'' Jerry Crawford,
an NL umpire who is the union president, said. ``The guys were not
getting paid. As of right now, these guys are on the payroll and
they are employed. I think that's more of a sure thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Major League Baseball was confident it could avoid an
injunction, but its officials decided to make a deal to insure that
the umpires would not strike in support of their 22 departing
colleagues.
</P>
<P>
   Under the agreement, the union and its officers ``agree that
they will not engage in any strike or work stoppage.''
</P>
<P>
   Based on the total salaries of the 22 umpires of $3,389,500,
paid over a 12-month period on the first of each month, the leagues
will pay them the remaining quarter, or $847,375, and also continue
to provide health benefits. The 22 umpires also will share in the
post-season bonus pool, although the money will come out of the
bonuses the other umpires would normally receive.
</P>
<P>
   In agreeing to pay their salaries, however, Major League
Baseball was taking no risk. The question of its acceptance of the
resignations will be heard by an arbitrator under a grievance the
union filed with the American Arbitration Association last Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If the umpires were to prevail in the arbitration and regain
their jobs, they would have received back pay anyway. If the
leagues win the grievance, however, the money they would have had
already paid out in salaries will be deducted from severance
payments that 16 of the umpires will receive.
</P>
<P>
   Money paid out to the six umpires who don't have 10 years of
service and therefore don't get severance will be recouped from a
$100,000 bond the union agreed to obtain.
</P>

GLOBAL CROSSING IS EXPECTED TO SWEETEN FRONTIER BID 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By SETH SCHIESEL   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In an attempt to reinvigorate its flagging effort to acquire the
Frontier Corp., one of the nation's biggest long-distance telephone
carriers, Global Crossing Ltd. has offered to modestly sweeten its
bid in exchange for Frontier's commitment to spurn other suitors,
executives close to the negotiations said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier's board met Wednesday night to consider Global
Crossing's latest offer, the executives said. If Frontier's board
does approve the new deal, the companies will probably announce the
agreement on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   If Global Crossing's offer is accepted, the companies intend to
announce a $500 million stock buyback, according to the executives
close to the deal. Both Frontier and Global declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   The looming renegotiation is the latest episode in a takeover
soap opera that began in March when Frontier agreed to be acquired
by Global Crossing, an upstart international phone company, in a
deal then worth $10.8 billion in stock. Over the summer, Global
Crossing wrangled with Qwest Communications International, another
long-distance newcomer, for control of both Frontier and U S West,
the regional Bell giant, before the two competitors agreed to
divide the spoils, with Frontier going to Global Crossing.
</P>
<P>
   But the high-flying stock Global Crossing wanted to use as
currency to acquire Frontier has not held up. The
telecommunications sector in general has edged lower over the last
six months amid concerns of a price war. At the same time, some of
Global Crossing's shareholders have appeared concerned that a deal
for Frontier, with its somewhat sluggish local phone operations in
places like Mondovi, Wis., and Fort Dodge, Iowa, would slow Global
Crossing's growth.
</P>
<P>
   So Global Crossing's shares, which traded above $51 before the
original Frontier deal was announced, have plunged, closing down
$1.875 Wednesday, to $24. Bigger names in telecommunications have
also lost value over that time, but not as much. AT&AMP;T has fallen to
$47.375 from $55, MCI Worldcom to $76 from $88.125 and SBC
Communications to $49.75 from $53.375.
</P>
<P>
   Frontier's shareholders could have maintained some equanimity
through some of Global Crossing's drop. Global Crossing guaranteed
them $63 worth of stock for each of their Frontier shares, but only
so long as Global Crossing's shares stayed above $34.56. Below that
``collar,'' Frontier's stock owners were to receive a fixed ratio
of about 1.82 Global Crossing shares.
</P>
<P>
   So rather than $63, Frontier's shareholders are now set to
receive $43.68 a share, less than the $44.625 Frontier shares were
worth before the original deal was announced last spring. The
overall stock value of the deal has been reduced to $7.6 billion.
With Frontier's shareholders set to vote on the deal later this
month and no immediate rebound in Global Crossing's shares sure to
come, a renegotiation appeared in order to executives involved in
the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the most solid way to bolster Global Crossing's offer
would be to add some cash to the mix. But Global Crossing does not
appear to be able to devote billions to such an effort.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, executives close to the negotiations said Global
Crossing's new offer was to give Frontier's stockholders two shares
of Global Crossing stock instead of 1.82. At Global Crossing's
current stock price, that would raise the value of the takeover to
Frontier's stock owners to $48 a share from $43.68 a share, an
increase of almost 10 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The catch, however, is that in order to win the higher ratio,
Frontier would have to agree to eliminate the deal's collars
altogether, according to people close to the negotiations. Frontier
would also have to agree not to consider other offers.  &QL;

WITH LIGHT TOUCH, TRADE CHIEF TAKES OVER  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., New Zealand, Switzerland)   By ELIZABETH OLSON   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GENEVA _ Mike Moore of New Zealand began his first day as leader
of the World Trade Organization on Wednesday with a reminder of
some nettlesome issues he faces as the top global trade arbitrator.
</P>
<P>
   White placards with such slogans as ``God Is Dead; the WTO Has
Replaced Him,'' waved by a small but voluble band of demonstrators,
greeted him as he arrived in a chauffeur-driven black Lexus.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a bit flattering I would have to say,'' Moore remarked
of the slogan. The protesters represent groups that have
increasingly criticized the trade organization as having too much
power. They are threatening to disrupt global trade talks in
Seattle late in November, which is scheduled as Moore's initial
challenge as director general. According to his count, he has 11
weeks to pull together a workable agenda on an array of complex
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Moore's congeniality and breezily informal style may help smooth
over disagreements among the 134 often-fractious member countries
on issues as diverse as cutbacks in farm subsidies, the taxation of
electronic commerce, market access to financial services like
banking and insurance, and tariffs on industrial goods.
</P>
<P>
   Looming as particularly contentious is whether to include
genetically modified food on the trade talk agenda, in light of the
dispute between the United States and the European Union over
whether barring American hormone-treated beef from the Continental
market violates global trading rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whether we like it or not, these are issues the public is
concerned about,'' Moore said.
</P>
<P>
   Some trade experts think he will have a second full-time job
mending fences with envoys from developing countries who supported
his rival for director general, Deputy Prime Minister Supachai
Panitchpakdi of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
   The 10-month contest escalated into a clash of wills with
delegates of many nations expressing resentment of Moore's support
from the United States. This was particularly true among nations
that contend they have not benefited from trade liberalization and
suspect the United States of having tried to undermine Supachai's
candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   In July, a compromise was struck in which both men will serve
three-year terms, with Moore going first. ``It's been a lot of
drama and theater,'' the new trade chief said, ``but it will be
forgotten in six months because the real issues are so enormous.''
</P>
<P>
   Moore, 50, has spent much of his career in New Zealand, where he
was most recently opposition spokesman for trade and foreign
affairs. He worked briefly for the printers' union but mostly
served in government posts. In 1990, he was briefly New Zealand's
prime minister. ``I was there such a short time it made Gerald Ford
look like Franklin Roosevelt,'' Moore remarked.
</P>
<P>
   Jovial one-liners aside, he is well aware that he faces a tough
task in figuring out how the trade organization presents itself to
a public that is increasingly aware and suspicious of centralized
power over trade.
</P>
<P>
   Criticism over the lack of openness erupted last year when the
organization brushed aside American safeguards for endangered sea
turtles caught in shrimpers' nets. Such environmental or
conservation measures are at odds with the views of many emerging
economies, which have resisted opening their commerce to outside
scrutiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have have to recognize that many nongovernmental
organizations have enormous influence,'' Moore said, ``so we have
to engage them and show a more human face.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got something to hide, the best way is to give out
5,000 sheets of paper and dare people to find it,'' he said
jokingly.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, he has repeatedly emphasized that the trade
organization is driven by its members' needs. To bring more smaller
economies into the fold _ about 30 countries are too poor to have
diplomats in Geneva _ Moore plans to help them better protect their
trading interests.
</P>
<P>
   ``The WTO now doesn't look like the real world,'' he said. ``It
looks too rich and clubby, so we have to work on that.'' That
includes admitting Russia and China to the group, he said.
</P>
<P>
   However, the trappings of his new job _ a six-figure salary, an
entertainment allowance, the luxury car and a spectacular view of
Lake Geneva _ obviously fit the the upscale model, although Moore
says he is too down-to-earth to have his head turned by such perks.
A worry, he said, is that he does not speak French _ something
considered tantamount to sin in Geneva circles.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from that, how will he know if he has been successful?
``If I manage to offend everybody, then I'm doing a good job,'' he
said.

ARIZONA GOT JUST WHAT IT DESERVED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ There is a sky-is-falling mentality hanging over
the Pacific-10 Conference, as everyone tries to overanalyze what
went wrong in Arizona's embarrassing loss to Penn State.
</P>
<P>
   Everything from the Wildcats' offensive scheme to their tackling
ability has been questioned following the 41-7 thumping they took
in the Pigskin Classic.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel disgusted, violated and what we've got to do is take
this (butt) whipping and learn from it,'' said Arizona linebacker
DaShon Polk, who played at Taft High.
</P>
<P>
   There's only one thing that needed to be learned, and somebody
forgot it when the game was scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Tomey was never going to take a team into Beaver Stadium,
with 97,000 rabid fans, and beat Joe Paterno.
</P>
<P>
   That is simply not something a program like Arizona's is capable
of doing. For that matter, neither is going to the Rose Bowl.
</P>
<P>
   It's one thing to beat a downtrodden Nebraska team in San Diego,
but Penn State was never going to let a bunch of rubes come into
State College before a national-television audience and pull off an
upset.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona hones its success against teams like Iowa, Illinois and
New Mexico. That is a far cry from playing in Beaver Stadium and
giving Paterno an entire summer to prepare for you.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're trying to find out who we are,'' Tomey said. ``Right
now, we don't like what we see. We need to take the hurt and the
pain from this game and transfer that into positive energy.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't worry, positive energy will come Sunday, when the Wildcats
play Texas Christian. That's their level of opponent, and as long
as Tomey remembers that, Arizona fans will be happy.
</P>
<P>
   The chosen one:The headline in The Daily Cal read ``Jesus in
Cleats'' when former Hart star quarterback Kyle Boller arrived in
Berkeley.
</P>
<P>
   Already, two reserve quarterbacks have left town. David Page
announced after spring drills he wasn't sticking around. And about
a week into fall drills, Ryan Sorahan said he, too, was leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Even temporary starter Sam Clemons admitted he thought about
transferring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It crossed my mind,'' Clemons said. ``But I felt I could
handle this, that everything would be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   As to how the quarterback setup will play out, offensive
coordinator Steve Hagen said: ``(Clemons will) be our starter
against Rutgers (on Saturday). And Kyle will play. The cards will
fall where they do.''
</P>
<P>
   Football is king:You think Tennessee lets anything get in the
way of football?
</P>
<P>
   This summer, 6-foot-4, 240-pound rookie defensive end Constantin
Ritzmann was stranded in his native Germany for five weeks because
of visa problems.
</P>
<P>
   The state responded with Gov. Don Sundquist, a Tennessee
congressman and an ambassador to the U.S. Embassy in Berlin getting
involved to chop through the red tape.
</P>
<P>
   Coaching carousel:All Big East head coaches return this year,
making it the only conference that can make that claim.
</P>
<P>
   Full house:The SEC had six of the top 10 teams in national
attendance and its 12 teams played to 99.6 percent of capacity last
season. One of every five fans who attended a Division I-A game
last season was at an SEC game.
</P>
<P>
   Classified info:Former Hawkeyes linebacker Ryan Loftin, who
started 11 games last year but had been moved to the second team
this year, has been charged with felony extortion and misdemeanor
fifth-degree theft.
</P>
<P>
   His crime? He allegedly threatened coach Kirk Ferentz in a
letter and stole Iowa playbooks. According to court records, Loftin
threatened to expose classified information that would harm the
professional reputation and business of the victim. Loftin also
expected to force the victim to continue to provide support through
scholarship funds.
</P>
<P>
   Loftin, 22, has received his degree but had one year of
eligibility remaining. He left the team Aug. 17.
</P>
<P>
   Bulking up: Ralphie IV, Colorado's 3-year-old buffalo mascot,
had a great year. Since her debut last Sept. 5, she doubled her
body weight from 400 pounds to 825.
</P>
<P>
   Her resume also shows she's one tough buff. Born on the Flying D
Ranch in Gallatin Gateway, Mont., in April of 1997, she was
separated from her mother at about a month old.
</P>
<P>
   Ranch hands found her in the jaws of a coyote, suffering from
bite marks on her neck. Bottle fed for about four months, she was
released back into the herd but didn't bond with the other buffalo.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder what she thinks of Rick Neuheisel? &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule book reviews:
</P>
<P>
   ``Isaac's Storm''By Erik Larson (Crown, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the turn of the century, a blustery time in an America
full of national pride and technical confidence. ``In this new
age,'' Larson writes, ``nature itself seemed no great obstacle.''
Then came tragedy in Galveston, Texas. On Sept. 8, 1900, the worst
hurricane ever to target America roared ashore from the Gulf of
Mexico, killing 8,000 men, women and children. The storm is still
the deadliest natural disaster in American history. Larson builds
his story around Isaac Monroe Cline, the chief meteorologist in
Galveston and the one man who might have saved the city. But
America's inflated self-image and rivalries among meteorologists
combined to downplay the storm's strength until it was too late
(Cuba's meteorologists, who had pioneered the art of hurricane
prediction, correctly judged the storm's scale and path, but their
warnings were ignored by the U.S Weather Bureau, which, Larson
says, ``wanted hurricanes all to itself''). Larson creates tension,
suspense and an ominous sense of impending tragedy as he follows
Cline through the days before the storm and then its ghastly
aftermath. The weatherman, who had thought of his own house as a
fortress, watched as water rose around it, first to his waist and
then to his neck, with tiny toads taking refuge on anything that
protruded above the surface. By the time the storm was over, Cline,
like thousands in Galveston, had lost someone he loved. ``This is
the story of Isaac and his time in America,'' Larson writes, ``the
last turning of the centuries, when the hubris of men led them to
believe they could disregard even nature itself.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The Last Survivor: In Search of Martin Zaidenstadt'' &QL; 
By Timothy W. Ryback (Pantheon, $21) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There are jarring moments in this book when Ryback quietly
reminds us that Dachau today is a charming and prosperous community
in the rolling hills of Germany, that it has citizens and shops and
a downtown, that it is picturesque. But who can think of Dachau
without imagining its ghosts? In 1992, editors at ``The New
Yorker'' asked Ryback to write a report on the town and its people,
who, as Ryback notes, live in the shadow of the notorious
concentration camp and ``have DACHAU stamped on their birth
certificates, carry DACHAU on their drivers' licenses and in their
passports, pay DACHAU electric bills, DACHAU water bills and DACHAU
gas bills.'' Ryback wrote his story and went on to other work, but
two months later found himself back in Dachau, driven to further
explore the moral issues that permeate the very air there. It was
at the camp in 1996 that he encountered Martin Zaidenstadt.
Zaidenstadt was 87, a former inmate of the camp who after his
liberation made his home in Dachau _ he married a German woman, had
three children and for years ``discarded'' his Jewish identity. Now
Zaidenstadt kept a daily vigil outside the camp's crematorium,
accosting visitors and tour guides and violating cordoned-off areas
to give impassioned demonstrations of how mass death was carried
out. To the people of Dachau, he was a tortured soul, a madman. To
Rybeck, he was an eyewitness urged on by moral righteousness,
astonishing memories, his own demons and the vanity of firsthand
knowledge. This look at Dachau is as thought-provoking as the old
man who became its living ghost, haunting the camp and haranguing
people with what he knows. ``Who's going to kick him out?'' Ryback
asks.``Who is going to tell him he can't go in there? Martin was
supposed to be gassed in that chamber, burned in that crematorium.
But the Nazis are gone, and the ovens are cold, and Martin is still
there. He has an historic claim like no one else in the world.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
``The Nest: An Artist's Sketchbook''By Maryjo Koch (ST&AMP;C, $35) &QL; 
The oversize format of this pretty book accounts for much of its
appeal, because Koch renders many birds, nests, eggs and feathers
in their actual size. This might not seem like such an endeavor,
but consider a peacock's feather, with the eyespot that Charles
Darwin called ``the most beautiful object in the world.'' Stretched
across two pages, it is 28 inches long and 10 inches high _ lazy,
lanky and delightful. Among the other pleasures are an array of
wrens and jay eggs, a tanager nest built inside a hornet's nest,
and an American robin's nest that incorporates, along with the
traditional mud and grass, a gum wrapper, a Q-tip, a cigarette
paper and a scrap of duct tape. Our favorite rendering: a selection
of impossibly tiny hummingbird nests, accompanied by words that
botanist Nehemiah Grew wrote in 1693: ``I saw one of these nests
made of cotton wool, in form and bigness of the thumb of a man's
glove, with the taper end downwards wherein were two eggs of the
bigness of a pea of oval form. Who can but admire to see the whole
body and all the parts of a bird folded up in an egg little bigger
than a pepper-corn?'' With a forward by Gretel Ehrlich. &QL; 
 &QL; 
``I Just Kept Hoping''By Gloria Stuart (Little, Brown, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Quick, call Celine Dion so she can put us in the mood. Stuart
became famous when at age 87 she played the ancient-but-cute ``Old
Rose'' in James Cameron's film ``Titanic.'' We weren't sure we
wanted to read 306 pages about her, but we now admit that there are
some interesting moments, as when Stuart reveals that she is
addicted to expletives and quotes herself screaming obscenities _
really, really bad ones _ at Cameron and other members of the film
crew. But not to worry. Stuart is 89, so Cameron still loves her,
and her memoir can be called ``irreverent'' by the people who write
the jacket copy. We call it chatty, and would be willing to
overlook all the exclamation points if we could just get Celine to
hum a few bars. &QL;

   VENEZUELA: POLITICAL SHOWDOWN
</P>
<P>
   With Congress gutted by decrees that transferred its functions
to a new Constitutional Assembly, opposition legislators threatened
to convene an ``extraordinary session'' in defiance of the
measures, but also began a ``dialogue'' with leaders of the panel
in an effort to recover some congressional powers. For its part,
the assembly has begun deliberations on a new decree allowing them
to ``evaluate'' government employees and possibly fire those deemed
guilty of corruption or other misdeeds.
</P>
<P>
   COLOMBIA: REBELS REPELLED
</P>
<P>
   In the heaviest fighting since mid-July, the army says it has
repelled an attack by left-wing rebels on a provincial town,
killing at least 47 guerrillas of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of
Colombia. The attack was made in solidarity with an indefinite
nationwide strike called by more than a million unionized workers
and members of peasant associations.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO: UNIVERSITY ULTIMATUM
</P>
<P>
   Francisco Barnes de Castro, the president of the National
Autonomous University of Mexico, issued an ultimatum to striking
students, saying their shutdown of the campus ``must not continue
for another day'' and warning he could use ``the force of the law''
to end it. He spoke to some 10,000 students and faculty at the
largest demonstration so far against the 134-day-old strike.
</P>
<P>
   CANADA: CHINESE INTERCEPTED
</P>
<P>
   Officials plan Thursday to start questioning 190 Chinese
migrants detained off Vancouver Island. Two other ships from China
were earlier intercepted as they sought to disembark 254
undocumented migrants. Reflecting a hardening of attitudes, a
national poll showed that 49 percent of respondents wanted the
undocumented immigrants to be deported, while 49 percent said they
should be allowed to apply as refugees.
</P>
<P>
   NORTHERN IRELAND: TORY CHIEF'S PROTEST
</P>
<P>
   Abandoning the traditional bipartisan approach to British
policy-making in Ulster, the Conservative Party leader, William
Hague, attacked Prime Minister Tony Blair's refusal to halt the
continuing release of paramilitary prisoners there as ``an
outrage.'' The early release procedure is part of the faltering
peace settlement that will be the subject of a rescue effort in
Belfast next week by George Mitchell, a former U.S. senator and the
chairman of the talks that produced the April 1998 accord.
</P>
<P>
   BRITAIN: CANING BAN EXTENDED
</P>
<P>
   Caning has been banned in Britain's private schools, 13 years
after corporal punishment was outlawed in state schools. The move
faces a legal challenge from a group of 40 private schools that say
violence against teachers has increased in state schools.
</P>
<P>
   GERMANY: BARAK'S SYMBOLIC VISIT
</P>
<P>
   Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak will be the first foreign
leader to visit Germany's new capital in Berlin since the
government moved there last month. Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder,
speaking on the 60th anniversary of the start of World War II, made
clear the visit had important symbolic value given ``Berlin's heavy
historic responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   TURKEY: AMNESTY BILL VETOED
</P>
<P>
   President Suleyman Demirel vetoed a bill passed by Parliament
that would have given amnesty to thousands of prisoners, including
some of the country's best-known gangsters and assassins. Many
political and civic leaders had protested the law. Parliament is in
recess until Oct. 1, and will then have a chance to override
Demirel's veto by a simple majority.
</P>
<P>
   SIERRA LEONE: REBEL LEADERS HELD
</P>
<P>
   Two commanders of the rebellion that recently signed a peace
accord with the government remained in captivity after a group of
former soldiers kidnapped them in Freetown. The soldiers are among
those who also held a group of U.N. officials in July for several
days, saying they had been excluded from the agreement. They had
been allied since 1997 with the Revolutionary United Front, whose
leader, Foday Sankoh, has yet to return to Sierra Leone almost two
months after the signing of an increasingly fragile peace deal.
</P>
<P>
   INDIA: ELECTION ALERT
</P>
<P>
   After discovering several caches of explosives and ammunition in
New Delhi, the police are beginning a major effort to guard polling
places as the first round of parliamentary elections take place
this Sunday in the capital and other locations. Most recently, a
large supply of bomb-making materials was seized from a member of
an Islamic militant group active in hit-and-run raids in Kashmir,
police said.
</P>
<P>
   VIETNAM: SECOND THOUGHTS
</P>
<P>
   The Vietnamese army ``made mistakes'' when it took over South
Vietnam in 1975, the army newspaper said, indicating that a debate
continues in Hanoi over the decision by northern Communists to
destroy the freewheeling economy of the south, sending thousands of
South Vietnamese into re-education camps. The general who signed
the article, according to a Reuters report from Hanoi, said
soldiers had failed to heed Ho Chi Minh's warnings against
arrogance in victory.
</P>
<P>
   CHINA: BRIGHT TOURISM FUTURE
</P>
<P>
   China is expected to become a major force in international
tourism in coming decades, the World Tourism Organization said in
Hong Kong. The Madrid-based group predicts that rising standards of
living will allow about 100 million Chinese to take international
trips by 2020, putting them in fourth place in numbers of travelers
after Germany, Japan and the United States. By the same time, China
will outrank France as the world's top destination, the
organization said.

EDITORIAL OBSERVER: A LEGACY OF CONSCIENCE FROM MILTON ROGOVIN  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By VERLYN KLINKENBORG   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Three weeks ago an air-conditioned truck pulled up to Milton
Rogovin's house in Buffalo and carted away his entire archive of
photographic negatives, contact sheets and prints _ a lifetime of
work. When artists allude to posterity, they often do so only
half-believing in it, but this was posterity's actual moving van,
come to carry Rogovin's archive to the Library of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The day must have seemed strange in many respects, not least in
the faint but still discernible irony that hung over it. Rogovin's
career as a professional photographer began only after he refused
to testify before the House Un-American Activities Committee, a
refusal that diminished his livelihood as an optometrist. ``They
already had enough stool pigeons,'' Rogovin says. ``They didn't
need me.''
</P>
<P>
   That was in 1957. The next year Rogovin was asked by a friend to
photograph storefront churches in a black section of Buffalo, a
neighborhood Rogovin already knew well as a voting-rights activist.
The result was a series of photographs capturing the pathos,
religious and otherwise, of that urban communion. Since then
Rogovin, who will turn 90 in late December, has devoted himself to
a photography of implicit activism, to portraits of working men and
women, of the rural and urban poor in America and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   In a sense Rogovin has continued on his own the project of the
Farm Security Administration, the 1930s sponsor of some of the most
remarkable photographic work of this century. His subject is not
the Great Depression but the chronic depression that still shapes
the lives of the working poor and unemployed.
</P>
<P>
   Two of Rogovin's most striking photographic series rely on the
transformations that place and time bring about. In ``Working
People,'' Rogovin photographed his subjects at work, dressed in the
armor of heavy industry, and at home, dressed however they chose.
Labor transfigures, but so does leisure, and it is a little
alarming to notice how much more sharply defined Rogovin's subjects
seem in hard hats and shop aprons than in coats and ties and Sunday
dresses. But nothing transfigures like the years going by.
</P>
<P>
   Three times in the past quarter-century, Rogovin went to
Buffalo's Lower West Side and photographed the same people in
settings of their own choosing. The result is a book called
``Triptychs,'' as pure a witnessing of time's movement, and the
ways in which poverty coarsens that movement, as there is.
</P>
<P>
   If it made sense, during the Depression, to send photographers
out into the countryside to chronicle the ``ill housed, ill
clothed, and ill fed,'' it makes equal sense to acknowledge, as
Rogovin's portraits do, that for many people those conditions have
never changed. An art raised upon that sad fact can sustain itself
in esthetic terms without falsely ennobling or falsely degrading
the people who stare at us still from these pictures. There is true
collaboration in Milton Rogovin's photographs, a conspiring of
artist and subject, and that is a legacy of conscience worth
preserving.

KING OF HYPE COMES TO TOWN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DOUG KRIKORIAN  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With trademark bombast, Don King staged a press
conference Wednesday at the venerable Biltmore Hotel in downtown
Los Angeles to hype the Nov. 13 rematch between Evander Holyfield
and Lennox Lewis at the Thomas &AMP; Mack Center in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   Ah, if only the two reigning heavyweight champions---Holyfield
owns the WBA and IBF belts, while Lewis is the WBC
titleholder---were able to provide as much action in the ring as
King does out of it.
</P>
<P>
   King, pursued by the United States government with a
resourcefulness usually reserved for the likes of Osama bin Laden,
easily stole the proceedings with his comedic mixture of double
entendres, non sequiturs, mangled polysyllabic utterances,
hyperbolic descriptions and a record-breaking name-dropping of
historical figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he took up basketball, Lennox Lewis would have been another
Michael Jordan,'' was just one of King's more mild pronouncements
during an amazing flurry of verbiage in which he also spoke of,
among many, many other things, the Lord and his Apostles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't know Don King was a Christian,'' cracked Lewis,
deprived of becoming the undisputed heavyweight champion last March
13 at Madison Square Garden when he wound up with a much-disputed
draw against Holyfield in what most observers perceived as another
King-orchestrated fraud.
</P>
<P>
   My ears still are ringing from listening to King's booming
voice.
</P>
<P>
   And my stomach still is aching from the seizures of laughter I
suffered from hearing King's latest monologue, which was unique in
that it was even more frenzied, more surrealistic, more bizarre and
more downright entertaining than those he's dispensed in the past.
</P>
<P>
   They'll be singing Amazing Grace at my dear departure before
you'd be able to finish reading all the goofy things King
articulated during a session in which he made references to King
Henry VIII, Alexander Graham Bell, John The Baptist, Thomas
Carlyle, William Cullen Bryant, Shakespeare, Socrates, Plato,
August Busch, Frank Sinatra, Sammy Davis Jr. and, of course,
himself.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been vilified, castigated, and, oh yes, indicted so many
times,'' said King, almost with a hint of pride. ``But I've always
come out on top at the end because America is a great country that
believes in me. It's the people that have made Don King. Without
the support of the American people, I'd be in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, for sure, Don King would be in jail, having been acquitted
twice in federal trials in recent years by a jury of his peers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is there going to be another crooked decision this time?''
wondered wise guy sportscaster Joe McDonnell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, Joe, it's so nice to see you!'' roared King. ``It wasn't a
corrupt decision last time. An unpopular one, yes. But the fight
game has a long history of unpopular decisions. People can view a
fight two different ways. The Holyfield-Lewis fight was much closer
than most people seem to think.''
</P>
<P>
   It was?
</P>
<P>
   What people?
</P>
<P>
   Don King?
</P>
<P>
   Evander Holyfield?
</P>
<P>
   Lennox Lewis easily won the fight, no matter what the judges
decreed and it's doubtful the upcoming return engagement will be
any different.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, Evander Holyfield, nearing 37, still is talking bravely,
although this time he's not going to make any silly third-round
knockout predictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``I learned my lesson from talking too much last time,'' said
Holyfield, who will earn another $15 million for the upcoming
frolic, the same as Lewis. ``There was no way Lennox was going to
let me knock him out in that third round. He was covering up and
running away from me, and it's impossible to knock out a guy when
he's doing that. But I'm going to beat Lennox this time. I promise
you there won't be any controversy.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What will you differently?'' I asked Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``First off, I'm not going to fight as badly as I did the last
time,'' he said. ``I was sick during that fight. I had the stomach
cramps, and probably shouldn't have fought. But how could I not go
through with it? I had to fight, and I just had a bad performance.
I'll be better this time.''
</P>
<P>
   That's doubtful because Holyfield still will have to figure out
how to get inside the taller, bulkier Lewis, who is five inches
taller and will be at least 30 pounds heavier than Holyfield.
</P>
<P>
   Holyfield kept walking into Lewis' jab that memorable evening at
Madison Square Garden, and that scenario figures to happen again.
</P>
<P>
   ``I won't change my strategy except this time I might try harder
for a knockout,'' said Lewis. ``I did everything properly last time
in the ring. I stuck and moved and avoided getting hit. Maybe I
should have been a little more aggressive. This time I will be.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're calling this fight the `Search For The Truth,' '' said
King. ``We're finally going to find out who's the best heavyweight,
who deserves the title. What a show this is going to be! What a
truly magnificent event! People are going to descend on Las Vegas
by car, train, plane and Pony Express. This is the fight everyone's
been waiting for.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, not really, Don.
</P>
<P>
   That one you're co-promoting with Bob Arum on Sept. 18 between
Oscar De La Hoya and Felix Trinidad is slightly more appealing,
considering that Lewis and Holyfield didn't exactly inspire
passions with their performances in their first fight.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, there was far more animation after (italicize) that
snoozer over the scoring that there was during the 12 one-sided
rounds in which Lewis dominated what little activity there was.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ohhh, Doug, at least you've been around long enough to know
what the real story was on that fight,'' said Don King to me when I
questioned him about the scandalous scoring.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, I have been around long enough to know, Don, you
sly devil, that your Machiavellian behind-the-scenes maneuverings
played a vital role in one of the worst decisions in a sport with
an infamous history of such injustices.

HARTLEY HOLDS ON AT OREGON
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE IRVINE  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   There has been an NFL dream burning inside Tony Hartley since he
first grabbed a football as a youngster.
</P>
<P>
   It was the thing that made Hartley spend endless hours working
on his skills as a receiver at Los Alamitos High. The thing that
made him do what was necessary to immediately step on the field at
the University of Oregon and make a contribution. The thing that
made him do what he had to in the classroom at Oregon to stay
eligible to play football.
</P>
<P>
   ``Never have I coached a guy that was more serious about being
great,'' Los Alamitos assistant coach Barry Sher said.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, the dream was the thing that the 6-foot, 190-pound
Hartley expected to come true following his junior season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to succeed in life so bad,'' Hartley said, ````and I've
always felt football is my way to go. I've always said I would
leave after my junior year. But, to tell you the truth, going into
my junior year, I didn't know. I wasn't sure I was ready.''
</P>
<P>
   After the season's ninth game, though, Hartley decided he was
ready to test the NFL waters. The realization came moments after a
nine-catch, 242-yard, two-touchdown performance in Oregon's 27-22
victory over Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the Washington game, I was thinking this would be it,''
Hartley said.
</P>
<P>
   But a strange thing happened on the way to the opportunity to
culminate a dream. Hartley decided to stay in Eugene.
</P>
<P>
   So, instead of sweating his way through an NFL training camp
attempting to win a job this summer, Hartley resumed his familiar
position at receiver for the Ducks in preparation for tonight's
Oregon season opener on ESPN at Michigan State.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talked to my mother (Bambi) a lot,'' Hartley said, ````and I
did a lot of praying. It was put in my heart to stay.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision will allow Hartley to make up for what would have
been a disappointing way to end his Oregon career. The conclusion,
if he would have bolted, would have come with him sitting at home
after violating an unspecified team rule while the Ducks played
Colorado in the Aloha Bowl. His replacement that day - Donald
Haynes - had seven catches for 148 yards and a touchdown in a 51-43
Colorado victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``It hurt because I let the team down,'' said Hartley. ``I would
have had a big game. What I did is not something that is part of my
life. I made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Aloha Bowl appearance should have culminated a breakout
season for Hartley, who had 48 receptions for 1,015 yards with 10
touchdowns. Twenty-eight catches, 628 yards and six touchdowns came
in the final six weeks of the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The bottom line is he helped (former Oregon quarterback) Akili
Smith make a lot of money,'' Sher said. ````The tape of (Smith)
during the draft looked like a Tony Hartley highlight film.''
</P>
<P>
   Following the season, Hartley looked into where he might fit in
that very NFL draft. The answer wasn't what he expected.
</P>
<P>
   ````I was told I was looking at the third or fourth round,''
Hartley said. ````That's not good enough. I feel I'm a
first-rounder. This year, I'll prove I'm a first-rounder.''
</P>
<P>
   Proving himself is nothing new to Hartley. As a Los Alamitos
senior, Hartley had 86 catches for 1,690 yards with 13 touchdowns.
Yet, when Parade Magazine selected its All-American team, it was
Los Al teammate Stanley Guyness, who had 46 receptions for 989
yards with 12 touchdowns, who made the squad.
</P>
<P>
   When discussion of the top Pac-10 receivers begins, the first
players generally mentioned are UCLA's Danny Farmer, USC's R. Jay
Soward, Stanford's Troy Walters and Arizona's Dennis Northcutt.
Yet, aside from possibly Farmer, Hartley was as productive as any
of them by the conclusion of last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really kind of funny,'' said Oregon receiver coach Chris
Petersen. ``In a weird sense, that's kind of the way its been for
Tony in our program as well. At first, it was Pat Johnson and then
it was Damon Griffin. We've always had another go-to guy, yet
nobody makes as many plays as Tony.''
</P>
<P>
   However, even though Hartley worked with track coaches in the
spring to improve his speed, he won't ever bust a 4.3 in the
40-yard dash. And his size, while certainly adequate, is not going
to jump out at a scouting combine.
</P>
<P>
   What he will do, though, is make the plays when counted upon. In
three years, Hartley has latched on to 104 passes for 1,863 yards
with 19 touchdowns. Hartley could surpass the school record in each
of those categories with a big season. He is 58 receptions, 635
yards and five touchdowns shy of the standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he could be the toughest receiver in the Pac-10,''
said USC free safety Ifeanyi Ohalete, a former teammate at Los
Alamitos. ````He's definitely not slow. He has great hands, maybe
the best I've ever seen. He's strong, has good size and runs great
routes. I'd say he's a guy who belongs on the next level.''
</P>
<P>
   But, with the next level on hold, Hartley will finally get his
chance to be called the go-to guy for Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   The timing isn't exactly the greatest with Smith in Cincinnati,
a pair of untested quarterbacks responsible for getting Hartley and
a group of new receivers. He knows he'll see double coverage in
nearly every game.
</P>
<P>
   Life couldn't be better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being double-teamed can be tough,'' said Hartley. ``But I've
been waiting my whole career for this. I've never been the first
option at Oregon. What I have been is the guy who just happens to
be open. If I keep doing that, the NFL will notice.''

EDITORIAL: AN UNBIASED INQUIRY ON WACO

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 2:
</P>
<P>
   Louis J. Freeh, the FBI director, has urged his boss, Attorney
General Janet Reno, to appoint a qualified group of outsiders to
investigate the agency's failure to keep Ms. Reno and Congress
fully informed about all aspects of its role in the 1993 siege of
the Branch Davidian compound in Waco, Texas This is the right thing
to do, since it would be an appalling conflict of interest to have
the FBI and the Justice Department investigating themselves. Ms.
Reno, who is said to be leaning in the same direction, should seek
out and appoint qualified independent investigators as soon as
possible.
</P>
<P>
   The focus would be to find out why the FBI failed for six years
to tell anyone, including Congress and the attorney general
herself, that it had used incendiary tear-gas canisters near the
end of the siege. The revelation last week that such devices were
used has damaged the agency's credibility and greatly embarrassed
Ms. Reno, who for six years had proclaimed that they were not used.
</P>
<P>
   About 80 members of the Branch Davidian sect died in the fire
that consumed the compound on April 19, 1993. There is no evidence
so far to suggest that the incendiary canisters had anything to do
with the fire, which the government says was set by the cultists
themselves. The canisters were apparently lobbed at a concrete
bunker 40 yards from the compound about six hours before the fire
broke out. But the mere fact that the FBI has concealed an
important piece of evidence for six years can only reinforce the
suspicions of those who have never believed the government's
version of events.
</P>
<P>
   The House of Representatives, which also feels badly misled by
the FBI, is talking about two investigations, one by the government
Operations Committee and another by a joint House-Senate commission
that would look into all aspects of the government's handling of
Waco. Such moves seem premature and might interfere with the
independent inquiry proposed by Freeh.
</P>
<P>
   A more sensible course would be for the Justice Department to
appoint outside investigators and, perhaps in consultation with
Congress, determine what ground to cover. Congress, in its
oversight role, could monitor the process and the final report of
that inquiry. At any hint of a cover-up, or if it becomes obvious
that there are important unanswered questions about Waco, Congress
could then hold its own hearings. But for now, a single
investigation, free of partisan bickering, is the way to go.

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 2:
</P>
<P>
   East Timor's long struggle to control its own destiny is at a
decisive juncture. Monday's U.N.-supervised referendum on the
territory's future status went off peacefully and with a remarkable
turnout of nearly 99 percent. The outcome, to be announced next
week, is expected to favor independence from Indonesia. But
militias backed by the Indonesian army have unleashed a new
campaign of violence aimed at thwarting independence. Indonesia's
president, B.J. Habibie, must act quickly and firmly to assert
control over the military, rein in the militias and fulfill his
promise to abide by the will of the Timorese people.
</P>
<P>
   East Timor has suffered mightily in recent decades. Abandoned by
Portugal in 1975 after three centuries of colonial rule, it was
quickly invaded and annexed by Indonesia, which has ruled the
territory harshly. But with last year's overthrow of Indonesia's
longtime dictator, Suharto, and his replacement by Habibie, Jakarta
changed its approach. Habibie offered the Timorese a plan for local
autonomy under continued Indonesian rule, then declared that if
autonomy was rejected, Indonesia would leave East Timor by the end
of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Those decisions did not suit Indonesia's powerful army, which
feared encouraging separatist movements in other restive
territories. Independence also alarmed some East Timorese who had
served the Indonesian authorities. Their combined resistance gave
birth to the militia movement, armed and protected by local units
of the Indonesian armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   Militia attacks have killed hundreds of civilians this year.
There is a danger that militia violence will now escalate in a
furious attempt to forestall independence. President Clinton
rightly warned Habibie last week that failure to control the
militias would damage relations with Washington.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the results of the referendum, Indonesia remains
officially responsible for security in East Timor for the next
several months. Habibie must send disciplined and reliable police
and military forces into East Timor with orders to disarm the
militias and see that the referendum results are carried out.  &QL;

<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Thursday, Sept. 2:
</P>
<P>
   The fatal shooting of a mentally disturbed man in Brooklyn,
N.Y., has raised concerns again about the use of excessive force by
New York City police officers. Gidone Busch was shot 12 times by
police in a confrontation on Monday evening. Six officers were
called to the scene when Busch, an Orthodox Jew who lived in the
largely Hasidic neighborhood of Borough Park, had behaved in a
threatening manner to others on the street. The officers tried to
use pepper spray to subdue him, but opened fire after he struck one
of them with a hammer and defied orders to drop it.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly afterward, several hundred residents took to the streets
to protest the killing. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani and Police
Commissioner Howard Safir met with Jewish community leaders Tuesday
to explain the circumstances of the shooting. The Police Department
is conducting an investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Although comparisons have been made between this incident and
the fatal shooting of Amadou Diallo in February, there are some
differences. In the Diallo shooting, officers fired 41 shots at an
unarmed man who was standing in a doorway. Busch, by contrast, was
wielding a hammer and was said to have attacked an officer with it.
</P>
<P>
   According to the police, the officers called the Emergency
Service Unit, which is equipped to handle the emotionally
disturbed, but Busch attacked them before that unit arrived. The
police say that as the officers backed away to give him room, one
stumbled and fell and another, trying to protect the first, was hit
repeatedly on the arm and thigh with the hammer until he too fell.
At that point the police ordered Busch to drop the hammer, and when
he failed to, opened fire.
</P>
<P>
   The police are trained to use deadly force only as a last
resort, to save a life. Given that a hammer blow to an officer's
head could be fatal, that criterion may well have been met.
</P>
<P>
   Still, it is understandable that many citizens are asking
whether deadly force was absolutely necessary against a man who did
not have a gun and who was outnumbered six to one. Was there no
other way to disarm him or wrestle him to the ground? Clearly, a
thorough investigation is needed to look at such questions and to
test the police account of the events.
</P>
<P>
   Even if this shooting conformed to police guidelines, that does
not mean the guidelines for dealing with disturbed people should go
unexamined. The police have 100 such calls a day. It may be time to
consider giving every patrolman increased training and a wider
array of nonfatal weapons to restrain or disable troubled
individuals.

AUTO SALES   JUMP SHARPLY   IN AUGUST 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Texas, Mich.)   (Eds: Subs to change 12th graf to reverse order of `supply' and
`demand')  (DW) 
 By KEITH BRADSHER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ In a sign that strong consumer spending continued to
power the American economy last month, many auto makers announced
Wednesday that their sales soared in August, with the biggest
growth occurring for some of the most expensive models with the
highest profits.
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler AG said that its Chrysler, Dodge, Plymouth, Jeep
and Mercedes-Benz brands had their best August ever, together
climbing 9.6 percent from already brisk sales in August 1998. Honda
Motor reported that its sales had climbed 10.5 percent in August
from a year earlier, to the highest level ever for any month, while
Toyota Motor reported its best August ever in the United States
with a 2.8 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
   General Motors said that its sales jumped 63.4 percent. But its
sales in August of last year were severely depressed because a
54-day strike had just ended and dealerships had not yet been
restocked with popular models.
</P>
<P>
   Auto executives and dealers were jubilant about the strength of
the market last month. ``It was unbelievable, it was as hot as
Texas,'' said Alan B. Helfman, a Chrysler, Plymouth and Jeep dealer
in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Monthly sales of new automobiles have long been an important
barometer of the economy's health, because they account for 4
percent of the nation's economic output and because auto makers
announce the sales immediately at the start of the next month. Alan
Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, made his reputation
as an economic consultant while working for the steel and auto
industries in the 1950s and 1960s. He has watched auto sales
reports closely ever since, although noting that the auto
industry's role in the economy has diminished somewhat over the
years.
</P>
<P>
   Lyle E. Gramley, a former Federal Reserve Board governor and now
a consulting economist for the Mortgage Bankers' Association of
America, said the soaring sales increased the chances that the
central bank would raise short-term interest rates at the next
meeting of its interest-rate policy committee on Oct. 5,
particularly if other economic indicators showed the same strength
as the August auto sales.
</P>
<P>
   While the minutes of recent committee meetings show that the Fed
keeps expecting consumers to become satiated with big-ticket
purchases and slow their spending, Gramley said, ``These auto sales
say it is not happening.''
</P>
<P>
   In another indication of economic strength, the Conference
Board, a New York business group, said Wednesday that the Index of
Leading Economic Indicators had shown an increase of three-tenths
of a percent in July. But the Commerce Department announced
separately that construction spending was surprisingly weak in
July, which could mean that the Federal Reserve's two small
interest-rate increases this summer are starting to hurt the
housing market.
</P>
<P>
   But the rate increases seem to be having little effect on the
auto market. ``Demand has exceeded our expectations and everyone
else's in the industry,'' said Paul Ballew, GM's general director
of industry and market analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Jamie Jameson, DaimlerChrysler's vice president for sales and
marketing operations, said that the pace of sales actually
increased after the Fed's most recent increase in short-term rates,
on Aug. 24. ``We closed 3 or 4 percent higher than we had
forecasted in the middle of the month,'' he said. ``There are a lot
of people who have made a lot of money in the stock market, and it
seems like they're cashing it out.''
</P>
<P>
   DaimlerChrysler also raised Wednesday its forecast for auto
sales next year, predicting very strong sales of 16 million
vehicles, including heavy trucks. That would be a little less than
this year, which is on course for a record 17.2 million vehicles,
according to DaimlerChrysler.
</P>
<P>
   Sport utility vehicles sold best last month, followed by pickup
trucks, with cars and minivans trailing. Auto makers and dealers
make their biggest profits on sport utility vehicles because demand
has outstripped supply, allowing many models to be sold at full
retail price with little discounting.
</P>
<P>
   The introduction of new designs has increased competition in the
market for mid-sized sport utility vehicles. But with
DaimlerChrysler offering lower-cost leases on the Jeep Grand
Cherokee this summer, sales shot up last month to the highest level
ever, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Helfman said that while his dealership stocked a dozen models of
cars, minivans and sport utility vehicles, just one model, the Jeep
Grand Cherokee, accounted for 100 of the 210 vehicles sold last
month. If Chrysler, Plymouth or Jeep built an even larger sport
utility vehicle, the size of a Ford Expedition, it would sell
extremely well too, he added.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we had a big one, there'd be another 30 or 40 sales _ man,
we'd be eating caviar down here,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ford Motor is scheduled to release its sales figures on
Thursday. Auto analysts predict that it will show only a small gain
from a year ago, when Ford dealerships profited from the lack of
inventory at rival GM dealerships. Without Ford's sales, auto
makers' market shares cannot be calculated precisely. Ballew said
that GM's share should be ``pretty close'' to 30 percent, the
company's target.
</P>
<P>
   Nissan Motor, which has been struggling, reported a 7.7 percent
drop in sales last month from a year ago. But Subaru, a unit of
Fuji Heavy Industries, announced that August was its best month in
12 years, with a 9 percent improvement from last year, while
Mitsubishi Motors said that its sales had jumped 43 percent.
Volkswagen, which has been riding the popularity of the New Beetle
and the mid-sized Passat sedan and wagon, posted a 34 percent
increase in August sales.

GRAND JURY TO BE CONVENED IN FATAL POLICE SHOOTING 
</HEADLINE>
  (See also NY-POLICE-BUSCH) 
(mk) 
 By MICHAEL COOPER   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A Brooklyn grand jury will begin hearing evidence
next week to determine whether the shooting death of a mentally
ill, hammer-wielding man by police in the Borough Park section of
Brooklyn on Monday night was legally justified, officials said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Brooklyn district attorney, Charles Hynes, said that a grand
jury would be convened on Tuesday to examine the circumstances
surrounding the shooting of Gidone Busch, 31, an emotionally
disturbed man who officials say was fatally shot by police officers
after he struck and injured one of them with a hammer. ``The facts
and circumstances of this incident warrant a careful review by the
grand jury,'' Hynes said in a statement.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to hearing evidence about what took place in the
crucial nine minutes between the time police received a 911 call
about a man wielding a hammer threateningly and the time the
responding officers called for an ambulance to take Busch to a
hospital, the grand jury will examine Busch's mental history and
see how well he was served by the mental health system, a law
enforcement official said.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators are being sent to several hospitals where Busch
was treated for mental illness to check records and try to
determine whether it was appropriate for Busch to be released, the
official said. Busch was involuntarily committed to hospitals three
times in 1996 and 1997, and had sought treatment at other hospitals
since then, officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Stuart London, a lawyer for the Patrolmen's Benevolent
Association, said he was confident that the grand jury would find
that the four officers had acted appropriately.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time the man was shot he was within four feet of the
officers,'' London said. ``They were concerned not only abut their
own safety but the safety of others. He was a danger to himself,
others and the police officers.''
</P>
<P>
   Police officials have said that when the officers arrived at
Busch's house after receiving the 911 call, he menaced them with a
hammer. One officer tried to subdue him with pepper spray, but it
was ineffective. Then, police said, Busch beat Sgt. Terrence
O'Brien with the hammer.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, Sgt. Joseph Memoly and Officers William Loshiavo and
Martin Sanabria began shooting, police said, firing 12 shots, all
of which hit Busch. Two other officers did not fire their weapons,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien suffered minor lacerations on his wrist, arm and thigh,
officials said. One of the officers at the scene told investigators
that he saw Busch ``try to strike Sgt. O'Brien in the hip area near
the sergeant's gun belt,'' an investigator said.
</P>
<P>
   The shooting drove hundreds of Orthodox Jews into the streets of
Borough Park to protest the shooting and ask why it was necessary
for police officers to shoot a man armed with a hammer. And it led
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani to move swiftly to try to reassure Jewish
leaders about the incident, which threatens to erode at least some
of his support in a neighborhood that has long been one of his
political strongholds.
</P>
<P>
   Busch's mother, Doris Busch Boskey, said that she would call for
a federal investigation of the case. ``I really want to get all the
facts,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   And she said police should be better trained to handle people
with mental illness. ``If they had more training with people with
emotional problems they would know how to deal with this,'' she
said.
</P>
<P>
   Police Commissioner Howard Safir defended the officers involved
and said that police were adequately trained to deal with
emotionally disturbed people.
</P>
<P>
   He said that the department was constantly examining nonlethal
alternatives to guns in subduing people, but that most of those
available _ including foams, nets and nonlethal bullets _ worked
only ``sporadically.'' Even Taser guns _ which the department uses
to administer electric shocks to people _ fail about a third of the
time, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Safir also stepped up his criticism of state Assemblyman Dov
Hikind, who represents Borough Park and has been a vociferous
critic of the shooting. ``I don't think Dov Hikind was helpful,''
Safir said, likening Hikind's response to the shooting to that of
the militant Jewish Defense League. ``I think he and the JDL,
instead of asking for calm, were trying to incite the crowd, and I
think responsible elected officials should not do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Hikind said that he found the commissioner's remarks
``stupefying'' and that he had spent hours at the shooting scene on
Monday night trying to calm the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``There wasn't a single arrest made. There wasn't a single piece
of glass broken,'' he said.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Goran Ivanisevic has been trying for 11 years to
deploy his serves like dynamite and crack this $14 million U.S.
Open wide open like a safe. But when Goran Ivanisevic looked around
Wednesday and surveyed the wreckage of a tournament suddenly bereft
of Pete Sampras and Patrick Rafter, the brooding, bearded Croat
didn't think he was home free.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Grand Slam is nobody's tournament,'' said the 27-year-old
stringbean best known for admitting to suicidal impulses after his
three unsuccessful treks to the Wimbledon final.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like Mount Everest. You cannot ever predict who's going
to win any Grand Slam,'' Ivanisevic declared after a 7-5, 7-6
(7-5), 4-6, 6-2 defeat of the Finnish unknown Ville Liukko.
</P>
<P>
   Still, with 10 first-round losses on his 1999 report card that
includes just two victories in five summer hardcourts events, this
victory over a 125th-ranked qualifier assumed morale-building
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything is possible,'' said Ivanisevic, who has never won a
slam.
</P>
<P>
   Ivanisevic was one of several relieved winners on a relatively
drama-free afternoon where 56th-ranked Tara Snyder's 7-5, 6-3 upset
of the 43d-ranked Mirjana Lucic, 17, the Wimbledon semifinalist,
was the main surprise and 17th-seeded Felix Mantilla was the only
deposed seed. The Spaniard fell to Magnus Norman, 1-6, 6-1, 6-2,
6-4.
</P>
<P>
   The top-ranked Martina Hingis confessed to never breaking a
sweat in her 6-1, 6-1 dismissal of Sarah Pitkowski but said she
wasn't worried about advancing too easily and peaking too early.
``I think I can save myself,'' said Hingis, who captured one of her
five Grand Slam titles here in 1997. ``I won a Grand Slam before,
hopefully it wasn't the last one. I know how to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   As the night session's headliner, the third-seeded Venus
Williams, who has noted that the only danger to her designs on
claiming her first Grand Slam title here are the leg-cramping rides
between Manhattan and the National Tennis Center, did not
disappoint. With her hair swept into a beaded chignon and her
second-round outfit _ traditionally white but untraditionally
backless _ on display under the spotlights, the 19-year-old
powerhouse reached the third round with a 6-4, 6-3 disposal of
35th-ranked Anne-Gaelle Sidot of France.
</P>
<P>
   On the men's side, the Open continued to experience the
aftershocks of Tuesday's dual debacle: the withdrawal of the
top-seeded Sampras to nurse a herniated disc in his lower back and
the defending champion Rafter's tortured default after dropping
serve in the first game of the final set of his five-setter with
Cedric Pioline with a recurrence of a rotator cuff problem.
</P>
<P>
   ``With them or without them it's tough, always tough,''
Ivanisevic said. ``Without them now is different story. But there's
so many other good players there.''
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's cataclysmic developments not only removed a two-time
defending champion and a four-time champion from contention,
robbing the Open of its odds-on favorites to clash in the
semifinals and leaving a pair of glaring vacancies in the upper
half of the men's draw, it guaranteed that Sampras will lose his
No. 1 ranking to second-seeded Andre Agassi or third-seeded Yevgeny
Kafelnikov after the Open.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's descent will be even steeper: he will tumble out of the
top 10.
</P>
<P>
   The immediate and future consequences to those two stars
presented immediate opportunities to their comrades in the top
half.
</P>
<P>
   Two of those players, Britain's Rusedski, who downed Spain's
Juan Carlos Ferrero, 4-6, 6-2, 6-3, 6-4, and Haas, who handled the
19th-ranked Thomas Enqvist, 6-2, 6-4, 7-6 (8-6), counted their
blessings after passing the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``It certainly opens up the draw,'' said Haas, a 21-year-old
German who has spent the past decade at the Florida think tank of
Nick Bollettieri, the coach who guided Agassi through his formative
years. ``There's actually three top players who did really well
here last year and haven't had the chance to play, like
Philippoussis or Sampras or Rafter,'' he said, referring to the
1998 runner-up, semifinalist, and champion, respectively. ``You
have to give Agassi a pretty good chance at it, the way he's been
playing.''
</P>
<P>
   Haas declined to link the slight hip flexor strain he sustained
while galloping for a forehand in the third set to the injury jinx
that has plagued his side of the draw. ``I don't think it's much of
a problem; it was still good enough to keep playing,'' he said,
more pleased about his straight set dismissal of this year's
Australian Open runner-up than worried by his aches and pains.
``Enqvist was one of the players close to being seeded; I'm sure
everybody watched who was going to draw him. I was the one who got
him.''
</P>
<P>
   While Rusedski, on the rebound from the foot injury that knocked
him out of Wimbledon, hasn't had a banner summer, he saw no reason
why he couldn't retrace the path he took the 1997 Open final.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it definitely is a little more open,'' he said. ``I
think I have a good chance to win the tournament. But the key for
me is to get to that second week.''
</P>
<P>
   MATCH POINTS
</P>
<P>
   Pete Sampras 's replacement, the 130th ranked Mikael Tillstrom
of Sweden, failed to get past his first-round encounter with
Russia's Marat Safin. Safin prevailed, 6-2, 5-7, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4 in 2
hours 39 minutes. . . . The 15th-seeded Amelie Mauresmo, who became
a French heroine and unwilling celebrity when she revealed her
lesbianism during her breakthrough run to the Australian Open
final, was the only seeded woman to drop a set. But 20-year-old
rebounded against Marianne De Awardt, 4-6, 6-1, 6-3. &QL;

 By NEIL HOHLFELD  
 c. 1999, Houston Chronicle  
COLLEGE STATION _ After 357 days of watching and waiting, Texas A&AMP;M
running back D'Andre ``Tiki'' Hardeman will get an early birthday
present Saturday night when the Aggies open the season against
Louisiana Tech in Shreveport, La.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Hardeman will turn 23 on Sept. 7, three days after his first
game action in nearly a year.
</P>
<P>
   Coincidentally, Hardeman's last game was against Louisiana Tech
last Sept. 12. He played in only the first two games of 1998 before
being ruled academically ineligible and missing the rest of the
Aggies' Big 12 championship season.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yeah, I've been looking forward to this for a long time,''
Hardeman said. ``Last year was hard, being on the sideline and
watching the team win and knowing that I was supposed to be out
there but I couldn't because I didn't take care of my business.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good way to come back. That was my last game last year,
and this year it's my first game. I want to see if I can start up
where I left off.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman was the Aggies' leading rusher with 105 yards on 24
carries last year before an error by the A&AMP;M registrar's office was
discovered. The wrong grade for a course taken by Hardeman was
inadvertently posted, and when the error came to light, his
grade-point average was too low for him to be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman remained at A&AMP;M and did well enough in class to regain
eligibility for his fifth season. He will start at fullback
Saturday, displacing for the moment Ja'Mar Toombs, who took over
for Hardeman and gained 422 yards as a true freshman.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiki already has established that he's a very good runner,''
said Aggies coach R.C. Slocum. ``But at this point, he's a better
blocker than Ja'Mar. Tiki has demonstrated over several years that
he can block. Both of them will play, but Tiki will start.''
</P>
<P>
   When Hardeman arrived at A&AMP;M in 1995, it was assumed he would
make a name for himself as a top-flight ball-carrier and not as a
blocking fullback. The Galena Park native was a Parade All-American
after gaining 1,729 yards in his senior season at North Shore High
School and was considered the top running back in the state after
the 1994 high school season.
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman was a tailback for A&AMP;M in 1995, when he gained 313
yards on 62 carries as a freshman. He excelled the next season,
gaining 660 yards with 17 touchdowns on 109 carries, an average of
6.1 yards per carry. That season he picked up the nickname
``Touchdown Tiki.''
</P>
<P>
   But Hardeman's career never blossomed the way many believed it
would. In 1997, he was moved out of the tailback spot by Dante
Hall, who led the team with nearly 1,000 yards rushing. Playing
fullback, Hardeman gained 508 yards rushing that season and
averaged 5.6 yards per carry.
</P>
<P>
   Before the eligibility snafu ended his season last year,
Hardeman gained 79 yards on 14 carries and scored three touchdowns
in a 28-7 win over Louisiana Tech. There was speculation he would
not return to A&AMP;M, instead taking his chances at making an NFL
team. But when Hardeman was advised he likely would not be drafted,
he worked toward regaining his eligibility and staying in shape for
this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``That would have been very easy (not to come back),'' Hardeman
said. ``I chose the hard road to follow, and now it's paying off.
For the most part, it was tougher going through this mentally. You
have to go do a lot of thinking about what you have to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've made the best out of the situation, and now I'm back.
Coach Slocum supported me, talking to me every day about what I had
to do to get back. I listened to him, did what I had to do, and now
I'm back.''
</P>
<P>
   Slocum said he was looking forward to seeing Hardeman return.
The 5-10, 240-pounder will give the Aggies a bruiser in the
backfield and a short-yardage specialist. Hardeman has 30 career
rushing touchdowns, tied for sixth in Aggies history. In addition,
he has four touchdown receptions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiki's always been a great worker on the field,'' said Slocum.
``We've never had any complaints with work habits on the field or
his toughness. He is a physical back who can run the ball up inside
and hammer it up in there in short-yardage downs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been impressed with the way he's come back. He's always
been able to play himself into shape because he practices so
hard.''
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman has been especially diligent in preparing for this
season. He knows this is his last chance to produce at College
Station and also knows he could play a large part as the Aggies
defend their Big 12 title. He admits it was difficult to switch
from tailback to fullback, but he did so because A&AMP;M's coaches
determined it would be better for the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was hard at first, but they felt that was the best thing
for the time,'' Hardeman said. ``That means I have to adjust to
playing fullback and get my mind set to playing fullback.''
</P>
<P>
   Though they are in a battle for playing time, Toombs and
Hardeman have become good friends. Toombs said both players have
asked running backs coach Lawrence Livingston about the possibility
of playing at the same time. With Hardeman and Toombs weighing a
combined 475 pounds, it would literally be a full-house backfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``You think about it, we could pound on teams,'' said Toombs.
``I don't know what might happen, but we could have some real
power.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hardeman said that in short-yardage situations the
alignment could be effective. But he is more focused about the
reality of playing in a game again Saturday night than on a
whimsical formation that may never occur.
</P>
<P>
   Hardeman has a second chance for a senior season, and he wants
to make the most of it. While it was disappointing not being a part
of last year's Big 12 championship team, he might be able to
contribute to a team that has the goal of winning a national
championship.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel that everything happens for a reason, so maybe me being
ineligible last year was the best thing that could have happened,''
Hardeman said. ``What happened last year, I just took it, kept a
positive attitude, and now I'm ready to go do what I can do.''

TEST REVEALS SMALL TEAR IN RAFTER'S SHOULDER 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By ROBIN FINN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Patrick Rafter, the two-time U.S. Open champion whose
latest title defense ended almost before it began _ with a sobering
first-round default on Tuesday night _ underwent a magnetic
resonance imaging test Wednesday at the Hospital for Special
Surgery in Manhattan that revealed a small tear to the rotator cuff
of his right shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   The injury does not require surgery at this time, but Rafter's
rehabilitation period appeared to likely force him to miss the
coming Davis Cup semifinal between Russia and Australia on Sept.
24-26.
</P>
<P>
   Wary of facing surgery or a lengthy layoff, Rafter had
previously played down the shoulder problem as chronic tendinitis
but apparently came into the Open with the rotator cuff injury,
which contributed to his 4-6, 4-6, 6-3, 7-5, 1-0 loss to Cedric
Pioline.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter's manager and brother, Steve, said that the player
consulted with two Manhattan orthopedists on Wednesday, including
the U.S. Davis Cup physician David Altchek, after receiving the MRI
diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been at doctors' offices all afternoon. It's one of those
things where they're not certain how long he's had it, and they're
going to be treating it constantly,'' Steve Rafter said. ``He
obviously wants to be available for the Davis Cup the same way he
wanted to come here to the Open and defend his title, but it would
be silly to come back for the Davis Cup and reaggravate it. He's a
sensible guy. I'm sure he'll listen to the doctors and not do the
wrong thing. The positive thing is the MRI showed no injury to the
cartilage.''
</P>
<P>
   Rafter said that John Newcombe, the Australian Davis Cup
captain, had suggested to him before the Open that regardless of
what transpired at the tournament, he ought to skip the Davis Cup
semifinal and take the rest of the year off to make sure the
shoulder problem did not follow him into next year.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Rafter, the first defending Open champion to falter
in the first round, felt the Open and the Davis Cup were more
crucial to him than next year's Australian Open.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday night, Rafter exited the stadium to the tune of boos
from a late-night crowd that felt entitled to watch him go the
distance and scrap it out with Pioline in a sudden-death fifth-set
tie breaker.
</P>
<P>
   Rafter said he wanted to quit after the fourth set because he
realized the shooting pain in his serving arm would never permit
him to advance past Round 2 even if he outlasted Pioline.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once one person starts booing, I guess the rest of them do,''
Rafter said. ``To be booed off, that hurts, no doubt about it. It
is very disappointing. I mean, what can I do?''
</P>
<P>
   Even Pioline took exception to the booing. ``He loves the
tournament,'' he said. ``If he gave up it's because he had a
serious problem. I think it's not fair from the crowd.''
</P>
<P>
   Early Dose of Tennis
</P>
<P>
   The children on the playgrounds around the Fort Greene section
of Brooklyn used to look with amusement at Levar Harper-Griffith.
``Hey, here comes Arthur Ashe,'' they'd call out to the kid who had
to set up his own net on the ramshackle courts in the neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   While his friends were often busy playing basketball, he fell in
love with tennis in an environment far removed from any country
club. It was a fascination that seemed inevitable after his mother
introduced him to tennis when he was all of 2 days old.
</P>
<P>
   That was when she wrapped him in a blanket and took him to his
first U.S. Open, on Sept. 6, 1981. In the years since,
Harper-Griffith has become a regular at the event as he slipped
past security and found his way onto the grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has a free pass. Three days removed from his 18th
birthday, Harper-Griffith and his partner, Andy Roddick, won their
first-round doubles match, 6-2, 6-2, Wednesday, scoring an upset
over the NCAA doubles champions, K.J. Hippensteel and Ryan Wolters.

   As the 1999 USTA National Boys' 18 doubles champions,
Harper-Griffith and Roddick received an automatic entrance into the
Open's main draw. Having the train to the National Tennis Center to
hit balls as a child and rising through the inner-city tennis
programs started by Ashe, Harper-Griffith made his return to his
home turf a success. Yet to some degree he remains as wide-eyed as
he was when he was a youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I'm walking around, saying, `Hi,' to Jim Courier and
Ivanisevic,'' said Harper-Griffith, who was ranked sixth in the
Boys' 18 last year and is mulling over when he will turn pro.
``You've got to try and act like you're cool about it, but every
time you pass them, you smile a little bit. These are the guys I've
been watching on TV since I was like, 8.''

DNA EVIDENCE SECURES RELEASE OF MAN CONVICTED IN '82 RAPE  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Calif.)   By STEVE STRUNSKY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Accompanied by the 78-year-old woman who worked more than a
decade to overturn his rape conviction, Vincent Jenkins walked out
of prison Wednesday, 17 years older and two surgeries frailer than
when he walked in.
</P>
<P>
   The woman, a lawyer from Manhattan named Eleanor Jackson Piel,
used DNA evidence to persuade a federal judge in Buffalo to order
her client's release.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a beautiful thing,'' said Jenkins, who sat between Ms.
Piel and his other lawyer, Barry Scheck, at a news conference
Wednesday night. ``It's like walking into a whole new world.''
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins has no immediate plans. He cannot work, he said, because
he had part of his lung removed when he learned he had lung cancer
in prison; he also had a hip replaced. For now, he is going to live
with his sister in the Bronx.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's hard to tell how I feel,'' he said, ``because your heart
is like your toe. It grows skin on it and it gets hard. ``But,'' he
added, ``people like Mrs. Piel soften it up.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Piel and Jenkins have had a long relationship. She defended
him in a manslaughter case in the 1970s, and though Jenkins was
convicted, she continues to defend him, saying that he stabbed the
victim in self-defense. Ms. Piel was not Jenkins' trial lawyer in
the rape case, but he wrote to her following his conviction in
1983, asking if she would handle his appeal. She agreed.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, after discovering that there was still physical
evidence from the rape trial, she contacted Scheck, who is
co-director, with Peter Neufeld, of the Innocence Project at the
Benjamin N. Cardozo School of Law in Manhattan. Jenkins is the 65th
person in North America to be freed by DNA evidence, Scheck said.
</P>
<P>
   Although Jenkins was ordered released on Monday, the judge in
the case, John T. Elfvin, has not announced his reasons. He has
promised to issue a written opinion.
</P>
<P>
   Jenkins was living in Buffalo in May 1982 when a young woman was
raped in a nature conservancy there. More than four months after
the rape, Jenkins was picked up by police in Buffalo who, his
lawyers said, convinced the victim to identify him as the rapist
despite her initial response that he was not the one. He was
convicted and sentenced to 20 years to life in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Even without the DNA evidence that would free him two decades
later, Ms. Piel said, the conviction was surprising in that Jenkins
was five inches shorter and several years younger than the
attacker.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Piel said the first of two DNA tests was conducted in 1993,
after she was joined in the case by Scheck. But that test was
inconclusive, and she said there was not much progress in the case
for several years.
</P>
<P>
   A second, more refined test was conducted in April by Edward T.
Blake, a criminologist who runs a lab in Richmond, Cal., Forensic
Science Associates. The test showed that Jenkins' DNA did not match
the attacker's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, great,'' Blake said, when he learned Wednesday that
Jenkins had been released. He praised Ms. Piel: ``She's someone
who's been there, done that and is still fighting the good fight,''
he said.

LOU HOLTZ IS TRYING TO RESCUE WOEBEGONE SOUTH CAROLINA 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By TIMOTHY W. SMITH    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Sitting on the credenza behind the desk in Lou Holtz's office at
William Brice Stadium are three things that could make his
inaugural season as the University of South Carolina football coach
a little easier to handle: a bottle of Rolaids, a bottle of
Excedrin and a bottle of Stress Tab vitamins.
</P>
<P>
   Consider that the Gamecocks finished 1-10 last season, that they
play in the Southeastern Conference _ one of the toughest in
college football _ and that 8 of the 11 teams on their 1999
schedule played in bowl games last season, including Tennessee,
which won the national championship. Holtz is going to be reaching
behind his desk a lot this season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wouldn't send me a schedule before I accepted the job, so
I never knew who we played until after I accepted the job,'' Holtz
said recently in an interview following a morning practice at the
university, in Columbia. ``When I saw the schedule I thought it was
somebody's pre-season top 10.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't cry for Lou Holtz. His daunting task begins Saturday when
the Gamecocks open the season at North Carolina State, but he is
back in his element. He is accustomed to taking over moribund
college football programs and turning out winners, usually within
two years. In 1972, Holtz took over a North Carolina State team
that had gone 3-8-1 the year before and guided it to an 8-3-1
record and a victory in the Peach Bowl. The next year the team went
6-0 in the Atlantic Coast Conference and won the league
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz had great success in seven seasons at Arkansas before
moving to Minnesota in 1984, taking over a team that had gone 4-18
over two seasons and had lost 17 straight Big 10 games. His first
Minnesota team was 4-7, but in his second season, Minnesota got off
to a 5-1 start before it finished 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   But it was his 1986-96 tenure at Notre Dame, during which his
team won a national championship, in 1988, that burnished Holtz's
image as a college football program savior. The reputation prompted
Mike McGee, the South Carolina athletic director, to offer Holtz
the head-coaching job three times before he accepted.
</P>
<P>
   The situation at South Carolina seems to resemble that with the
New York Jets, who were coming off a 3-11 season when Holtz took
over in 1976. Unlike his various college experiences, Holtz was not
able to turn around the Jets' fortunes. He left one game before the
season ended, having coached them to a 3-10 mark, and the team
continued to stumble afterward.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolina, which once belonged to the ACC, has no winning
tradition in football, except for George Rogers winning the Heisman
Trophy in 1980. The Gamecocks have won just one bowl game (the
Carquest Bowl in 1995) and have never won more than 10 games in a
season since their program started in 1892.
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, college football's version of Elmer Gantry, has rolled
into town to give the Gamecocks a winning identity after the
dismissal of Coach Brad Scott. A record number of season tickets
(53,000) have been sold, and the Gamecock Club, an athletic booster
association, has raised a record $8.3 million for the athletic
programs at South Carolina since Holtz was hired last December.
</P>
<P>
   ``I looked at the job and said we could win here,'' Holtz said.
``You look at the loyalty of the people. We have 87,000 fans a
game. You've got great fan support. You've got a great stadium.
You've got good athletes in the state of South Carolina. The
problem is they leave. I take the challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz, 62, cited burnout as the reason he left Notre Dame
following the 1996 season.
</P>
<P>
   In the wake of his departure, the university's football program
erupted in controversy, starting with the successful age
discrimination lawsuit filed against Notre Dame in February 1997 by
a former offensive line coach, Joe Moore, then age 65. Moore
contended that he was fired by Bob Davie after he took over from
Holtz in November 1996 because Davie thought Moore was too old to
coach.
</P>
<P>
   During the trial, Davie, who contended he fired Moore because he
had been disrespectful to Holtz and other coaches, admitted that
while he was defensive coordinator in Holtz's final year at Notre
Dame, he and Moore had a conversation questioning Holtz's mental
stability. Holtz said in a statement he was ``completely
mystified'' at that remark and that Davie ``never said anything but
positive comments to me personally.''
</P>
<P>
   In another case, Kimberly Dunbar, a former Notre Dame booster,
acknowledged using some of the $1.2 million she embezzled from her
employer to buy gifts for Notre Dame football players _ some during
Holtz's tenure. National Collegiate Athletic Association
enforcement officials have recommended that the contact between
Dunbar and the Notre Dame players be considered a secondary
infraction, which means the university would avoid major sanctions.
A decision from the NCAA is pending.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Holtz said he had never heard of Dunbar, had never met her and
wasn't aware of players receiving gifts from her when he was there.
He said didn't believe there was any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Notre Dame has never talked to me about that situation,''
Holtz said. ``If there is a major violation, I'd find that hard to
believe. I know the people at Notre Dame, and there is no way
possible that there was ever anything but a great effort to run the
most honest program in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   McGee, the South Carolina athletic director, said he became
familiar with Holtz when facing Holtz's North Carolina State team
as head coach at Duke in the early 1970s. McGee believes that
Holtz, who signed a five-year contract that pays $600,000 annually,
is committed for the long haul.
</P>
<P>
   ``At every institution that he's coached he's brought a higher
level of play both from the commitment of the athlete to improved
fundamentals,'' McGee said. ``That back-to-basics approach was
something that we needed. Also, when I was at Duke and he was at
North Carolina State for those seven years, I saw up close and
personal that he always had a strong staff. He has made the comment
that the staff he has here is the best he's ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   As for Davie's suspicion that Holtz was slipping mentally in his
last year at Notre Dame, McGee said: ``I checked everything out at
Notre Dame, not because I was suspicious of Lou Holtz, but because
I had to. Due diligence was done. I've known Lou a long time and I
put zero stock in that.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz said he accepted the job at South Carolina at the urging
of his wife, Beth, who he said has regained strength after battling
throat cancer for two years. The job became more attractive to him
after his son, Skip, decided that he would give up his head
coaching job at Connecticut and join his father at South Carolina
as the Gamecocks' offensive coordinator.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came here sight unseen,'' said Skip Holtz, who worked with
his father for four seasons at Notre Dame. ``I asked him if this
was something he really wanted to do, and he said it was. That's
all I needed to hear. Having the opportunity to work with Lou Holtz
again, being back in the SEC coaching football is a win/win
situation. I couldn't lose.''
</P>
<P>
   While he was away from football, Holtz was a motivational
speaker, earning as much as $20,000 an appearance, and he worked as
a college football analyst for CBS Sports. All the while he said he
missed coaching.
</P>
<P>
   During a recent morning practice, Holtz gathered his offensive
unit around him and spent 45 minutes going over each of 130 plays
from scrimmage. Holtz lined up against behemoth offensive linemen
to demonstrate the proper blocking angle on certain plays. He did
it over and over again. He wanted each player to know his
assignment as well as the assignments of the players around him.
The bedrock of his coaching philosophy is drilling fundamentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``Coaching is trying to eliminate a mistake before it happens in
a game,'' Holtz said.
</P>
<P>
   The Gamecock players have taken to Holtz's approach, screaming
included.
</P>
<P>
   ``People always told me that he was real intense, and he is
intense,'' John Abraham, a senior outside linebacker, said. ``I
kept seeing all those clips of him grabbing people by the jersey
and grabbing them by the facemask. But he treats us like men. I
want to play up to my potential, and that's what he wants for each
player.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz and his staff got a late start recruiting, but still
managed to get running back Derek Watson, a 6-foot-1-inch,
205-pound running back who was Football in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   It was a significant signing for South Carolina followers who
are still galled at the fact that three of the four down starting
linemen on Tennessee's national championship team are from South
Carolina. Watson, of Williamston, S.C., had verbally committed to
Tennessee before accepting a scholarship with the Gamecocks.
</P>
<P>
   The atmosphere around the South Carolina football program is the
opposite of last year's. Ray Green, a senior defensive back, said
that as the losses mounted last season, players openly argued with
each other on the sideline and coaches questioned each other's
decisions in play calling. ``The losses just snowballed and it just
killed our morale,'' Green said. ``There was no control. The heart
of the team just wasn't there.'' Holtz has instilled greater
discipline and confidence in the players in the few months he has
been on the job.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to come out every game knowing that we've prepared
to win,'' said Arturo Freeman, a senior free safety who missed all
of last season with a knee injury. ``We have confidence in our
ability and we have confidence in the play selections. On defense
it's no more of that `let's try to hold them down.' We're coming in
with an attack attitude. There are no more doubts. You can go to
bed the night before the game expecting to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Holtz said he can't do anything about outside expectations for
the team this season. He won't predict how many games the team will
win and he is concerned that the players' confidence will be shaken
if they experience too many early-season losses. The Gamecocks open
on Sept. 4 at North Carolina State, which defeated the powerhouse
Florida State last year, and play Georgia at Athens the following
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could be a pretty good football team by the middle of the
year,'' Holtz said. ``How do we build confidence? That's the
question. If somebody has expectations, that's their concern. I
want us to be as good as we can be and build it on a firm
foundation.''  &QL;

UCLA HAS SECONDARY CONCERNS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In two decades as a defensive coach, UCLA's Bob
Field has opposed Peyton Manning, Drew Bledsoe and John Elway. He's
tutored Bruins standouts Jamir Miller and Carnell Lake. He's
coached in the Rose Bowl and the Bluebonnet Bowl. He's designed
man-to-man defenses and zone defenses for young teams and veteran
teams, good teams and bad teams.
</P>
<P>
   But since his arrival in Westwood in 1978, Field has never
experienced anything like his current dilemma: Of the five
cornerbacks available for Boise State, only one has played college
football. The Bruins will use senior Jason Bell and four freshmen
Saturday night _ and Boise State knows it.
</P>
<P>
   ``The No.1 thing they want to do is throw the football,'' Field
said. ``They believe in running, but their priority, the thing
they've done best, is throw it.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I feel good about the way our guys have worked. They don't
have much experience, but if they recognize formations and get
lined up right, we'll be fine.''
</P>
<P>
   The Broncos averaged 246.5 passing yards per game last year.
Although their skill players are unproven, they have a massive
offensive line (306 pounds per man) and a veteran quarterback (Bart
Hendricks) who's mobile and throws a soft, deep ball.
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins will counter with Bell, redshirt freshman Joe Hunter,
true freshman Ricky Manning, redshirt freshman Paul Nelson (a
converted receiver), and redshirt freshman Lovell Houston, who's
doubtful because of a strained thigh.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all know we're vulnerable, and they're going to try to pick
on us,'' Hunter said. ``They'll come after us, and that's fine. We
can't worry about it. We just have to make a statement that we're
ready to play.''
</P>
<P>
   How they stand: Bell and Hunter will start. Manning is the top
reserve. He'll spell the starters and play in passing situations as
the third cornerback. Nelson is the fourth cornerback.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to remember our fundamentals, our footwork, the things
we do in practice,'' Hunter said. ``We have to stay calm, be
patient, and just play. We can't think too much.''
</P>
<P>
   Sophomore Jason Stephens will start at strong safety and senior
Joey Strycula at free safety. Junior Jason Zdenek, of West Hills,
is the third safety and will play both positions. Sophomore Julius
Williams, a converted cornerback, is the fourth safety.
</P>
<P>
   On certain third-and-long situations, UCLA will use receiver
Freddie Mitchell and tailback DeShaun Foster to bolster the
secondary.
</P>
<P>
   So far, so good: In practice, at least, UCLA's defense looks
more confident and better organized _ much better organized _ than
it did last year. Field's simplified system has helped, as has the
defensive line's maturation.
</P>
<P>
   ``UCLA should never be 99th in the nation,'' head coach Bob
Toledo said of last year's defensive ranking. ``There's much less
confusion, and they're better fundamentally. They're playing hard
and confidently. I have a better feeling than I did a year ago.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A BIG SHOT, AN OLD SHOT, A NEW SHOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By HARVEY ARATON    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ricky Ledee was a wide-eyed 13-year-old when he got
his first glimpse of Darryl Strawberry. Granted, it was mostly of
the top of Strawberry's baseball cap, not the best of views, from a
distant row in the corner of the right-field upper deck.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets were home, at Shea Stadium, against Houston that summer
day in 1987, only beginning their descent from the crest of a
championship season. Ledee at the time had his own waves of emotion
to ride. His father, a well-known salsa singer, was recently
deceased after falling asleep at the wheel of his car.
</P>
<P>
   Ana Ledee decided it was as good a time as any to flee the
scene, escape the pain. She stretched the budget, flew Ricky and
her two younger sons from their home in Salinas, P.R., to New York.
A sister was living in Brooklyn, and that's where they stayed, and
a promise was made to her oldest son. During a month in New York,
he would go to a baseball game.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Mets were the kings, who you wanted to see,'' Ledee said.
``Not that I could see that good, but it didn't matter. My first
game. I could see the field. How could I forget?''
</P>
<P>
   He remembered Strawberry hitting a muscular double, and that's
about it.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the big shot in those years,'' Ledee said.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is 12 years later, and if Ledee isn't such a big shot
himself, he has at least made the most of his opportunity to play
left field for the most famous baseball team there is. When Darryl
Strawberry walked back into the Yankees' clubhouse Wednesday
afternoon _ an inevitability that might have been at Ledee's
expense had he allowed it to be _ it was already established that
Strawberry was returning as the spare part he has reduced himself
to.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, in the lineup Wednesday night against the Oakland
right-hander Omar Olivares, confronted the hollow specter of a
faded 37-year-old star, who is more of a threat to himself than
anyone else, with the best month of his baseball life. He hit .371
in August, drove in 14 runs, left the suggestion of the minor
leagues far back in the rearview mirror. Even if it is as part of a
platoon, there should be no turning back now on the Yankees'
commitment to him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had faith in myself, but that's because my mother always had
faith in me,'' he said. ``She was pregnant when my father died, and
she couldn't work and we struggled, but even though I was the
oldest son, she always made me pursue my dream of being a
ballplayer. Without her, I'd probably be, I don't know, in
Alaska.''
</P>
<P>
   He laughed at the thought of such misdirection, his words as
soft as his southpaw swing is sweet. But the voice turned firm when
he spoke of the discomfort he feels when his mother calls from
Salinas, not to be confused with Beverly Hills, to make the
occasional financial request.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell her, `I don't want you to have to ask,''' he said. ``I
say, `Whatever you need, whatever my brothers need, it's there.'
That's what it's for. We have something now.''
</P>
<P>
   Ledee, no rich athlete, pulling down a couple of hundred grand,
said, ``This is family, responsibility.''
</P>
<P>
   And this is what makes Ricky Ledee such a comfortable fit on a
team that counts professionalism and accountability foremost among
its governing principles. ``This is more than a place where you
just come and play baseball,'' Ledee said. His eyes scanned the
nearly empty room. ``You have people who care about their families,
who care about each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly, it is asked why the Yankees take Strawberry
back when he has failed them before, when they don't much need him.
Eyes roll in the direction of the owner, but you get the idea that
if George Steinbrenner had the players vote, Joe Girardi or Scott
Brosius or some other compassionate soul on this most human of pro
sports teams would stand up to say that Strawberry is family,
responsibility.
</P>
<P>
   Quiet as he is, Ledee said, in fact, he would have been quick to
second the motion, and not because Strawberry was a big shot in the
eyes of a heartbroken kid.
</P>
<P>
   Ledee had been at his dressing stall when Strawberry, reporting
to work early, walked in, and right over. They hugged and
Strawberry looked Ledee in the face and said: ``You are the left
fielder. I'm happy for you. You've earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   This was Strawberry, his life's prognosis no better than day to
day, at least acknowledging his tenuous reality. The view of a
troubled man once seen as larger than life from a distant seat in
the sky may not get any better than that. &QL;

THE GREAT BEANIE BABIES MYSTERY DEEPENS

<TEXT>
<P>
   Are Beanie Babies headed to the giant toy box in the sky?
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer, Ty Inc., says it's retiring all current and
soon-to-be-released Beanies at the end of the year. That leaves
open the possibility of new models in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But a leading collectibles analyst and expert on Beanie Baby
marketing says he believes the toys are not coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ty is getting out at the top, just like an aging football star
who comes to his senses and says it's time to call it a career,''
said analyst Harry Rinker of Rinker Enterprises, a leading research
center for antiques and collectibles in Vera Cruz, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Rinker said Wednesday that he thinks that Ty Inc. did not want
to get stuck with warehouses overflowing with Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   Rinker, whose sharp insights and critical assessments of the
Beanie craze earned him the nickname ``Beanie Meanie,'' added: ``Ty
recognizes everything is trendy. We as a society don't have long
attention spans. They got three good years out of this. I mean
Tickle Me Elmo dolls was (popular) for what, four months?''
</P>
<P>
   Rinker said that now is a perfect time for people to sell
Beanies if they want to get anything for them. ``Five years from
now ...,'' he said, trailing off with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Rinker did not rule out the possibility that Ty may have
something up its sleeve for next year. He said Ty Warner, the
company's head, is a ``great market manipulator'' who is good at
drumming up support for the fad.
</P>
<P>
   Already, he said, this week's publicity is guaranteed to give
Beanie Babies one last popular push timed well to coincide with the
company's scheduled release of a new line of Beanie Babies in a
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the fate of Beanie Babies was mulled over and over
Wednesday as the Great Beanie Mystery deepened and fans scrambled
to learn if one of the decade's hottest crazes was over.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Brook, Ill.-based Ty Inc. wasn't spilling the beans about
the fate of pellet-filled Butch the Bull Terrier, Goochy the Ty-dye
Jellyfish, Kuku the Cockatoo and their gang of furry friends.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation was fueled by the company's Web-site posting of a
cryptic and tersely worded message Tuesday: ``VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE
_ On December 31, 1999 at 11:59 p.m. (Central Time) ... All Beanies
will be retired''
</P>
<P>
   The news immediately affected fans and sellers of the toy.
</P>
<P>
   Maddy Johnson, a 6-year-old Seattle collector of Beanies, said
she would ``feel kinda sad'' if the toys went away. She has a dozen
babies and says they are fun to play with because ``there are all
sorts of animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddy's older brother, Charlie, 10, said where he and Maddy see
Beanies as fun, other kids see dollar signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend will say, `Hey, this one is worth a lot!''' Charlie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Beanie Babies have become big-time collector items, particularly
among adults. Predictably, Tuesday's announcement influenced
Internet auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   California-based online retailer Ebay reported its auction area
for ``Beanies'' increased slightly to 10,700 postings early
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At Seattle's Amazon.com, company spokeswoman Sharon Greenspan
noticed more attention to Beanies, adding, ``as news spreads, more
people are listing, and bidding is becoming more active.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Beanie Baby auction site Collectingnation.com, the number
of bids was dramatically higher.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers Wednesday said it was impossible to learn what was
going on because it was difficult to get through to Ty Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Altman of Boehm's Candy Express in Seattle's Capitol Hill
neighborhood tried to contact Ty for nearly six hours Wednesday
before finally reaching someone.
</P>
<P>
   Even then it was only a chipper Ty receptionist who answered her
questions by saying: ``It's a big secret. We can't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beanie Boom started in the specialty toy market when Ty
introduced the toys in late 1994. By 1996, the toys hit number
eight on the annual survey of best-selling toys published by
Playthings, a New York-based trade publication that racks toy
trends. Their popularity soared so high that, at the peak, some
stores reported selling 40,000 Beanie Babies a day.
</P>
<P>
   That generated big money for privately held Ty Inc., which
within three years was earning about $250 million in annual
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, the popularity began to show signs of fatigue.
Last year, Rinker predicted Beanies had started to peak. Retailers
said last Christmas would probably be their last hurrah. And in the
second quarter of 1999, the Web site www.AbsoluteBeanies.com
reported online bid values for Beanies had dropped 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Altman, who had her business increased tenfold by Beanie
Babies, said the toy _ whether it stays or goes _ has forever
changed her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone had told me that five years ago a little stuffed
toy animal would turn my life around, put a line outside my
business, make phones ring off the hook and cause hundreds of
people to sleep outside my store door ... I would have said they
were out of their mind. It's been an exciting and fun ride.''

`PENDING' NOTICE IS POSTED ON HOUSE THE CLINTONS TOURED RECENTLY  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
   By LISA W. FODERARO   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHAPPAQUA, N.Y. _ As word spread here that someone _ perhaps the
president _ had signed a contract to buy the Dutch Colonial that
the Clintons toured on Saturday, a steady stream of cars looped
around the tiny cul-de-sac called Old House Lane for a peek at The
House, and a CNN camera crew descended on the hamlet.
</P>
<P>
   In short, Chappaqua, a suburb that is not easily impressed, was
in a tizzy.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the talk of the Grand Union,'' said Ellis Lesser, a
32-year-old mother of two who runs a stationery business from her
home. ``Everybody I know is very excited. It'll certainly make the
property values go up.''
</P>
<P>
   Some residents appeared pleased that the Clintons' designs on
the five-bedroom house, at 15 Old House Lane, suggested that
Chappaqua had won the strange suburban real estate pageant that had
been unfolding in Westchester for weeks as the first couple scoured
the county. But they also braced for the fallout.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the main qualm _ that we could become a tourist
attraction,'' said Nina Gorki, who was running errands on King
Street in the business district. ``It's a quiet town, and we love
it that way.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillary Rodham Clinton, who is widely expected to run for the
U.S. Senate from New York, has to establish residency in the state
by Election Day 2000 to be eligible.
</P>
<P>
   The Westchester Multiple Listing Service, a computerized roster
that gives the status of properties for sale in the county,
indicates that the house is ``pending,'' which means a contract has
been signed and all conditions are met. But the listing does not
say who the intended buyer is.
</P>
<P>
   ``To me, that means it's a done deal,'' Elio DeCecchis, a real
estate broker in Tarrytown, said Wednesday after checking the
house's status on his computer screen.
</P>
<P>
   The ``pending'' designation, which was updated from ``active''
status on Tuesday, also signals that real estate brokers are no
longer showing the house to prospective buyers. Typically, home
buyers will sign a contract that is subject to a number of
conditions, like their being approved for a mortgage and the
house's passing an inspection.
</P>
<P>
   On Saturday, between vacationing on Martha's Vineyard in
Massachusetts and attending fund-raisers in the Hamptons, the
Clintons stopped in Chappaqua and spent two hours inside the
110-year-old house, which resembles an old-fashioned rambling
seaside cottage. It was the only house the Clintons looked at that
day. Two weeks earlier, the couple had toured five houses.
</P>
<P>
   Kathy Sloane, a broker with Brown Harris Stevens in Manhattan
who has led the search on behalf of the Clintons, could not be
reached for comment Wednesday. On Tuesday night, however, she said
she had ``no news of a signed contract.'' She then changed her
comment to ``no news of an unconditional contract.''
</P>
<P>
   She added, ``If there were a signed contract with no caveats,
there would have been an announcement.''
</P>
<P>
   Speculation was rife among realtors and residents today that one
condition might have to do with security. The house sits on just
1.1 acres _ far smaller than any of the five properties the
Clintons saw in mid-August. The Secret Service has to sign off on
any residence the Clintons might buy.
</P>
<P>
   A 35-acre plot of land that was recently approved for a
subdivision rises behind 15 Old House Lane but does not abut the
property. There is some concern that the future development could
pose a danger to the Clintons because the parcel looks down on the
backyard.
</P>
<P>
   There were unconfirmed reports that either the Clintons, or
possibly the Secret Service, were trying to buy adjacent land or a
piece of the subdivision. One neighbor, Charles Chepigin, whose
house occupies 1.58 acres to the immediate east of the Dutch
Colonial, said he had ``no comment at this point'' when asked if he
had been contacted about selling part of his property.
</P>
<P>
   The Dutch Colonial, an 11-room, 5,200-square-foot house, is
listed at $1,695,000. It has a white-shingled exterior, and its two
wings are punctuated by fan windows and topped by gambrel roofs.
Across the back of the house, overlooking a pool, is a sweeping
porch with a long row of stout white columns. A detached barn
functions as a garage and could also serve as quarters for Secret
Service agents.
</P>
<P>
   The house's owners, Dr. Jeffrey Weisberg and his wife, Cheryl,
have lived there more than a decade, the neighbors said. Their
property taxes last year were $25,900.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lesser, who owns the stationery business, is a member of the
same book club as Ms. Weisberg and has been inside the house.
``It's gorgeous,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The one concern in Chappaqua Wednesday seemed to be the traffic
that motorcades and such might bring. A hamlet in the town of New
Castle, Chappaqua is prized for its public schools, its elegant old
houses and its hilly, wooded terrain. Many residents feel there are
too many Volvos and BMWs on the winding roads as it is.
</P>
<P>
   But Bonni Pactor, who was walking her golden retriever, Timber,
in the small downtown, dotted with coffee shops and antiques
stores, was not too worried. ``People are concerned about traffic,
but she's going to be in New York City most of the time,'' she
said, referring to Mrs. Clinton. ``I can't imagine she'll be
hanging out in Chappaqua all that much.''

SUBARU ROLLS OUT HUGE CAMPAIGN, BUT STICKS TO FAMILIAR THEMES  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to correct spelling of SUBARU in slugline, hed and lede.)  
 (ATTN: Texas, N.J., Australia, Japan)   By COURTNEY KANE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Subaru is rolling out the largest advertising campaign in its
history, but don't expect to see a new cast of characters or any
other drastic changes to its existing theme. Instead, the company
is sticking by an old adage: ``If it ain't broke, don't fix it.''
</P>
<P>
   Paul Hogan of ``Crocodile Dundee'' fame continues as Subaru's
spokesman in the integrated campaign from Subaru's agency of six
years, Temerlin McClain in Irving, Texas, and the campaign
continues to emphasize safety and performance features, including
all-wheel-drive technology. Subaru, however, is doubling the amount
of broadcast and print placements and backing the ads with $70
million to $80 million to push its revamped Legacy line and its
2000 Forester model.
</P>
<P>
   ``Subaru understands who they are,'' said David Lyon, group
account director at Temerlin McClain, a unit of True North
Communications. He added, ``That's why you see consistency, focus,
continuity, and you see the courage to stay with what's working.''
</P>
<P>
   Clive Chajet, chairman of Chajet Consultancy, a brand and
corporate image company in New York, agrees that sticking to a
similar format seems to be the right formula for the Subaru of
America unit of Fuji Heavy Industries of Japan. ``Given the
intensity of the noise level of automobile advertising, essentially
the only way they are breaking through the clutter is staying with
what they already have,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest campaign for the company's redesigned Legacy
models, which include the Outback wagon, the Outback sedan and the
Legacy GT, the overall slogan is still, ``The beauty of all-wheel
drive.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the nine new television commercials, which began running
nationally last month, are for the Outback models. In one spot for
the Outback sedan, a sleek black car is shown cruising through a
city and passing imagery of the Australian Outback, including a
woman walking a kangaroo on a leash, crocodiles in potholes and a
herd of sheep crossing the street at a crosswalk. Hogan steps out
of his Subaru and says, ``My kind of town.''
</P>
<P>
   A spot for the Outback Sport vehicle, which is aimed at younger
consumers, shows Hogan tagging along with his nephew en route to an
outdoor concert. The two drive on a dirt road through a variety of
obstacles to demonstrate the car's performance and horsepower. As
they reach their destination, passing tattooed fellow concertgoers,
the nephew says, ``This might not be your type of crowd, Uncle,''
to find Hogan already body surfing in the mosh pit. The Outback tag
line is, ``The world's first sport utility wagon.''
</P>
<P>
   A third commercial to demonstrate the traction and control of
all-wheel-drive technology has Hogan in the classic Subaru chase
scenario in the jungle. Two other spots for the Forester emphasize
its carlike handling and that it is easier to climb into than other
sport utility vehicles. The Forester slogan is, ``Sport utility
tough, car easy.'' Another commercial, showcases the entire line of
Subaru's all-wheel- drive vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone would look at the work and say there is a
significant departure from what we have done,'' Lyon said, ``though
we have done some things differently to call attention to the fact
that we have a new car.''
</P>
<P>
   Hogan, who has been in the Subaru campaign for five years
``represents everything we want to say about this car _ that it's
rugged, it's adventurous, it can provide the driver with a lot of
confidence and that it's fun,'' Lyon said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, he added, ``We had to find a way to use Paul a little
differently to make sure that we signal news that we have a new car
this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Bill Cyphers, vice president for marketing at Subaru in Cherry
Hill, N.J., said the company's sales figures were argument enough
for continuing with the current theme. ``We've had three wonderful
years back to back _ each year is better than the last,'' he said.
``And this past year was our best sales year in over 10 years.''
</P>
<P>
   Over the last six years, Subaru said that sales in the United
States had grown more than 50 percent. As of July, Subaru had sold
85,478 cars this year, up 8 percent, from the corresponding period
a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   `` Hogan continues to work for us. The type of ads that we do
continue to work, and we are targeting those people with the active
life style who have a high propensity to buy our cars,'' Cyphers
said.
</P>
<P>
   Most Subaru buyers are college-educated, make approximately
$75,000 annually and enjoy an active life style involving canoeing,
hiking and skiing, Cyphers said.
</P>
<P>
   Lyon added that Subaru was also trying to win over consumers who
had become disillusioned with sport utility vehicles, which are
essentially light trucks and have poor fuel economy.
</P>
<P>
   As Subaru has brought itself back from a string of declining
sales ending in the early 1990s, it has grown from a marketer of
niche products like front- and four-wheel-drive vehicles that were
positioned as cheap and reliable to a full-line producer of
mainstream offerings like upscale all-wheel-drive sedans, sports
utility wagons and the Forester sport utility vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   The print portion of the campaign gives readers glimpses into
the active, outdoor-oriented life styles of Subaru owners. Six ads
began appearing in the August issues of publications including
Automobile, National Geographic, Outside, People, Southern Living,
Smithsonian and Time. All the ads refer consumers to a refurbished
Subaru corporate Web site, subaru.com or to a special site designed
to showcase the new line, 2000.subaru.com. In addition to search
engines like Yahoo, Subaru interactive banner ads have been placed
on sites like Autobytel and Carpoint. &QL;

EUGENE OSTROFF, GUARDIAN   OF PHOTOGRAPHY'S TREASURES, DIES AT 71 
 (DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Pa., Calif., Fla., Texas)   By MARGARETT LOKE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eugene Ostroff, a former curator of photography at the
Smithsonian Institution, an authority on the history of photography
as a technology and an influential lecturer and writer on
photographic conservation, died on Aug. 26 in Washington, where he
lived. He was 71.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his daughter Gia Ostroff-Welsh.
</P>
<P>
   Ostroff joined the Smithsonian in 1960 and retired in 1994 from
the National Museum of American History, one of the Smithsonian's
16 museums. During his 34-year tenure, he had charge of a
collection that charted the changes in photographic processes and
techniques from the 1830s until the present.
</P>
<P>
   In this collection of more than 100,000 images and 10,000 pieces
of equipment is the world's longest photo negative, 180 feet long
and 5 inches wide. Alan Fern, who joined the prints and photographs
division of the Library of Congress in 1961 and who is now director
of the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, recalled that
Ostroff had persuaded the Navy to provide the Smithsonian with a
coast-to-coast aerial photograph of the United States, completed in
one take and using the latest reconnaissance camera.
</P>
<P>
   Helena Wright, curator of the Smithsonian's graphic arts
division and acting curator of Ostroff's photo history section,
confirmed that the Navy gave the panoramic photograph and negative
to the institution in 1965.
</P>
<P>
   So extensive was Ostroff's knowledge of photographic technology
that he occasionally came up with unusual solutions for problems.
There is his method of ``restoring'' photographs by irradiation.
``If you irradiate a faded print,'' explained Grant Romer, director
of conservation and museum studies at the George Eastman House in
Rochester, ``it makes the silver radioactive. Put that in contact
with film and you'll get a stronger image because you can reclaim a
greater range of density.''
</P>
<P>
   Born in 1928 in New York City, Ostroff studied photography at
Los Angeles City College. During much of the 1950s he worked as a
photographer at the Rockefeller Institute for Medical Research and
other research institutions. He also took courses in photographic
engineering and technology at New York and Columbia Universities.
</P>
<P>
   Fern recalled that after Ostroff joined the Smithsonian, which
began its photographic collection in the 1860s, ``his interest in
collecting and interpreting and writing about photography
supplanted his interest as a practicing photographer.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to acquiring photographic equipment and artifacts,
Ostroff assembled numerous exhibitions of works by noted
photographers, including Imogen Cunningham, Elliott Erwitt, Arthur
Rothstein and Robert Capa. In 1962 Ostroff gave Richard Avedon his
first major solo show. The Smithsonian circulated two Ostroff
exhibitions, ``Western Views and Eastern Visions'' (1981) and
``Photographing the Frontier'' (1976).
</P>
<P>
   A 6,500-square-foot Hall of Photography, another Ostroff
brainchild, opened at the museum in 1972. For about two decades it
held a permanent exhibition of images and objects showing the
history of photography.
</P>
<P>
   Besides writing for many technical and scientific journals,
Ostroff was the editor of a book, ``Pioneers of Photography: Their
Achievements in Science and Technology'' (1987). For some years he
had been working on another book, ``What Made Photography Popular?
Its Industry and Cultural History,'' which he completed last year.
</P>
<P>
   Ostroff's marriage to Caroline Lindt ended in divorce. In
addition to his daughter Gia, of Jenkintown, Pa., he is survived by
his wife, Elise; two other children from his first marriage, Mika
Ostroff-Geiger of Austin, Texas, and Eric, of North Hollywood,
Calif.; a sister, Harriet Bloom of Delray Beach, Fla., and four
grandchildren.

THE GREAT BEANIE BABIES MYSTERY DEEPENS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROBERT L. JAMIESON JR.  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Are Beanie Babies headed to the giant toy box in the sky?
</P>
<P>
   The manufacturer, Ty Inc., says it's retiring all current and
soon-to-be-released Beanies at the end of the year. That leaves
open the possibility of new models in 2000.
</P>
<P>
   But a leading collectibles analyst and expert on Beanie Baby
marketing says he believes the toys are not coming back.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ty is getting out at the top, just like an aging football star
who comes to his senses and says it's time to call it a career,''
said analyst Harry Rinker of Rinker Enterprises, a leading research
center for antiques and collectibles in Vera Cruz, Pa.
</P>
<P>
   Rinker said Wednesday that he thinks that Ty Inc. did not want
to get stuck with warehouses overflowing with Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   Rinker, whose sharp insights and critical assessments of the
Beanie craze earned him the nickname ``Beanie Meanie,'' added: ``Ty
recognizes everything is trendy. We as a society don't have long
attention spans. They got three good years out of this. I mean
Tickle Me Elmo dolls was (popular) for what, four months?''
</P>
<P>
   Rinker said that now is a perfect time for people to sell
Beanies if they want to get anything for them. ``Five years from
now ...,'' he said, trailing off with a chuckle.
</P>
<P>
   Rinker did not rule out the possibility that Ty may have
something up its sleeve for next year. He said Ty Warner, the
company's head, is a ``great market manipulator'' who is good at
drumming up support for the fad.
</P>
<P>
   Already, he said, this week's publicity is guaranteed to give
Beanie Babies one last popular push timed well to coincide with the
company's scheduled release of a new line of Beanie Babies in a
couple of weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the fate of Beanie Babies was mulled over and over
Wednesday as the Great Beanie Mystery deepened and fans scrambled
to learn if one of the decade's hottest crazes was over.
</P>
<P>
   Oak Brook, Ill.-based Ty Inc. wasn't spilling the beans about
the fate of pellet-filled Butch the Bull Terrier, Goochy the Ty-dye
Jellyfish, Kuku the Cockatoo and their gang of furry friends.
</P>
<P>
   Speculation was fueled by the company's Web-site posting of a
cryptic and tersely worded message Tuesday: ``VERY IMPORTANT NOTICE
_ On December 31, 1999 at 11:59 p.m. (Central Time) ... All Beanies
will be retired''
</P>
<P>
   The news immediately affected fans and sellers of the toy.
</P>
<P>
   Maddy Johnson, a 6-year-old Seattle collector of Beanies, said
she would ``feel kinda sad'' if the toys went away. She has a dozen
babies and says they are fun to play with because ``there are all
sorts of animals.''
</P>
<P>
   Maddy's older brother, Charlie, 10, said where he and Maddy see
Beanies as fun, other kids see dollar signs.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friend will say, `Hey, this one is worth a lot!''' Charlie
said.
</P>
<P>
   Beanie Babies have become big-time collector items, particularly
among adults. Predictably, Tuesday's announcement influenced
Internet auction sites.
</P>
<P>
   California-based online retailer Ebay reported its auction area
for ``Beanies'' increased slightly to 10,700 postings early
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   At Seattle's Amazon.com, company spokeswoman Sharon Greenspan
noticed more attention to Beanies, adding, ``as news spreads, more
people are listing, and bidding is becoming more active.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Beanie Baby auction site Collectingnation.com, the number
of bids was dramatically higher.
</P>
<P>
   Retailers Wednesday said it was impossible to learn what was
going on because it was difficult to get through to Ty Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Terri Altman of Boehm's Candy Express in Seattle's Capitol Hill
neighborhood tried to contact Ty for nearly six hours Wednesday
before finally reaching someone.
</P>
<P>
   Even then it was only a chipper Ty receptionist who answered her
questions by saying: ``It's a big secret. We can't tell you.''
</P>
<P>
   The Beanie Boom started in the specialty toy market when Ty
introduced the toys in late 1994. By 1996, the toys hit number
eight on the annual survey of best-selling toys published by
Playthings, a New York-based trade publication that racks toy
trends. Their popularity soared so high that, at the peak, some
stores reported selling 40,000 Beanie Babies a day.
</P>
<P>
   That generated big money for privately held Ty Inc., which
within three years was earning about $250 million in annual
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, the popularity began to show signs of fatigue.
Last year, Rinker predicted Beanies had started to peak. Retailers
said last Christmas would probably be their last hurrah. And in the
second quarter of 1999, the Web site www.AbsoluteBeanies.com
reported online bid values for Beanies had dropped 35 percent.
</P>
<P>
   But Altman, who had her business increased tenfold by Beanie
Babies, said the toy _ whether it stays or goes _ has forever
changed her life.
</P>
<P>
   ``If someone had told me that five years ago a little stuffed
toy animal would turn my life around, put a line outside my
business, make phones ring off the hook and cause hundreds of
people to sleep outside my store door ... I would have said they
were out of their mind. It's been an exciting and fun ride.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ From Port of Spain in Trinidad to London to Miami,
the exultant sound of the steel drum band rings across carnivals
and continents. Formed anew every Carnival season, giant steel-drum
(or ``pan'') bands rehearse daily for months to perform a short
piece before enthusiastic crowds and tough competition judges.
</P>
<P>
   In Brooklyn the sound of steel drums grows more vibrant with
each week of the summer, as pan bands a hundred musicians strong
gather on sidewalks and in vacant lots, practicing every night to
prevail in the annual competition that ushers in Brooklyn's giant
Labor Day West Indian American carnival. Along with Trinidad's own
Carnival in February, Brooklyn's is one of the two epicenters of
pan music.
</P>
<P>
   To increase their competitive chances, bands call on a handful
of world-class arrangers whose job is to turn amateurs into
virtuosos with razzle-dazzle versions of the year's calypso
favorites. Year after year bands turn to Len (Boogsie) Sharpe.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, 45, has been renowned in steel-drum music for 40 years,
from his days as a prodigy who could barely reach the drum to his
emergence as a composer, arranger and band leader. He uses the most
traditional methods to create startling, innovative arrangements
for the instrument that has become the musical symbol of the West
Indies. Since the mid-1980s he has often competed with himself,
working for multiple bands in a single Panorama competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boogsie is head and shoulders above everybody else,'' said Bob
Telson, the composer of Broadway's ``Gospel at Colonus,'' who often
draws on world music.
</P>
<P>
   This year Sharpe is the mastermind for the Pan Rebels steel
band, named after a song he wrote in 1983. On Monday night in
Brooklyn, steel drums pealed down Parkside Avenue in Flatbush, as
the Pan Rebels warmed up for one of their last rehearsals before
Saturday's competition. The tinsel-trimmed scaffolding that holds
the drums had been rolled out of the band's headquarters, a
deserted garage across the street from Intermediate School 2, and
nearly a hundred drummers were taking their places on the sidewalk.
</P>
<P>
   The musicians, most of them with roots in Trinidad and Tobago,
included an 8-year-old girl and men in their 60s; dreadlocked
teen-agers and working women in their 30s; teachers, carpenters,
salesmen, plumbers. Limbering up, they bent over their drums with
rubber-tipped mallets and bits of calypso melody filled the air
with a random, shimmering clangor. The sidewalk had become a
panyard, a steel-band practice area. At around 9:30 p.m. Sharpe
strolled into the ranks of drums and tapped a syncopated beat on
the side of one with a drumstick.
</P>
<P>
   Suddenly chaos gave way to harmony: Sharpe's arrangement of a
calypso called ``In My House,'' 10 minutes of flashy variations,
full of ping-ponging counterpoint and vertiginous key changes. It
was the kind of showpiece _ bursting with melodies,
countermelodies, stops and starts _ that has made Sharpe's
reputation.
</P>
<P>
   And it sounded like liquid jubilation. People from the
neighborhood gathered on the sidewalk to listen; cars along
Parkside crawled by with their windows open, reluctant to drive
away from the music. Caribbean food vendors opened up stands,
selling corn soup and roti and sorrel-scented beer; they've been
doing business since July, when the Pan Rebels and two other steel
bands started nightly rehearsals on Parkside Avenue. The brisk
calypso beat, tapped out on salvaged brake shoes, set both drummers
and listeners dancing.
</P>
<P>
   The Pan Rebels were polishing ``In My House,'' a tribute to
steel drums by the songwriter Oba, for Panorama, which takes place
Saturday night behind the Brooklyn Museum of Art on Eastern
Parkway. The Pan Rebels will be judged alongside 13 other bands.
About 24 hours after the Panorama judges announce their decisions,
the Pan Rebels and the other steel bands will march in Jouvert, the
parade of satirical costumes and steel bands that gets under way at
3 a.m. Monday on Grand Army Plaza in Prospect Heights and makes its
way to Nostrand Avenue in Wingate until mid-morning. Jouvert
(pronounced Joo-VAY) is a grass-roots revival of an old Trinidadian
custom. With or without sleep, some of the steel bands go on to
perform in the Eastern Parkway carnival parade, which draws more
than a million spectators every year.
</P>
<P>
   For all the bands Labor Day weekend is the culmination of two
months of practicing, night after night, often until 2 or 3 a.m.
The musicians are unpaid, but they willingly sustain the tradition.
``People lose jobs, wives, everything because of their love for
this,'' said Gary Rogers, one of the Pan Rebels' three
coordinators.
</P>
<P>
   When Trinidad was used as a refueling stop for aircraft carriers
during World War II, the islanders recycled empty oil barrels as
drums. African drums were banned in Trinidad in 1884 by British
colonial rulers, and for half a century carnival processions made
music from bamboo tubes called tamboo bamboo, along with biscuit
tins, bottles and scrap iron.
</P>
<P>
   Steel drums brought a new precision and refinement to carnival
music. Hammering various-sized dents in the tops of the barrels
made it possible to play different notes on a steel drum, and in a
few years Trinidadians devised an orchestral range of instruments,
from the tenor pans that usually carry the melody down to bass pans
with only a few deep notes on each drum.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe, 45, has made the tradition his calling. ``Pan is my
life. It's all I know,'' he said. ``I live music, sleep music, eat
music. Sometimes, when I am playing, I just feel like my whole body
and soul is inside of the pan.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe does not read or write music. Neither do most of steel
drummers. But in a feat of memory that Trinidadians take for
granted, he conceives elaborate arrangements and teaches them to
the drummers note by note, phrase by phrase. He does not sketch the
music on a keyboard, as some steel-band arrangers do; he doesn't
use recordings.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have the whole picture in my head,'' he said. The music
exists only in Sharp's imagination, and then in the sound of
mallets on steel.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpe was born in a panyard in Port of Spain, where his cousin
led a steel band. He had perfect pitch and was immediately drawn to
music. When he saw symphony orchestras on television, he wanted to
become a conductor. But steel drums were closer at hand, and at the
age of 3, he was tapping out melodies. ``The pan was taller than
me,'' he recalled; he stood on a cinderblock.
</P>
<P>
   Recognized as a prodigy, he started winning prizes when he was
5, and he put together a band to play his first compositions while
he was a schoolboy. At 15, Sharpe dropped out to join the Starlift
Band, the first steel band to play its own compositions instead of
transcriptions. And at 20 he founded his own band, Phase II Pan
Groove, which he still leads in Trinidad's original Panorama during
the February carnival.
</P>
<P>
   It was more than a decade before Phase II won first prize at
Panorama in Trinidad. In 1987 Sharpe became the first arranger to
win the competition with his own composition, ``This Feeling
Nice.'' By then, he was widely recognized as an innovator in
steel-band music.
</P>
<P>
   ``He can do things that are very modern and still keep an
old-time calypso feel in the harmonies and the phrasing of the
melodies,'' said Telson, who has performed with Sharpe's bands in
Trinidad and Brooklyn. ``His chords are much richer than anyone
else's, and his counterpoint is also deeper than anyone else's. He
has so many countermelodies happening that although the music is
harmonically so rich, you can also focus on any one of three
different lines at the same time. And it always swings.''
</P>
<P>
   By the late 1980s Sharpe was being commissioned to create
arrangements for other bands as well as Phase II. His tunes, with
lyrics added by various collaborators, became hits for the singer
Denyse Plummer. Sharpe's peak as a prize winner came in 1988, when
he supplied seven different bands with arrangements. Three of them
won regional awards for the north, east and south zones, another
arrangement was a winner for Tobago, and Phase II won the national
prize.
</P>
<P>
   More recently Pan Trinbago, which runs Panorama in Trinidad,
decreed that no more than two bands in the main competition can use
the same arranger, and Sharpe said he has heard that the number may
be cut to one.
</P>
<P>
   ``That is unfair,'' he said. ``You can't tell a lawyer how many
clients to have, and you can't tell a doctor how many patients to
see. Why are they trying to deprive me of my livelihood?''
</P>
<P>
   Outside carnival season Sharpe works in clubs, playing steel
drum with leading calypso singers and jazz musicians, from the
Mighty Sparrow and David Rudder to Wynton Marsalis, Randy Weston
and Art Blakey. His current schedule includes an Oct. 17 concert at
Afrika House in Brooklyn, playing a tribute to the calypso composer
Lord Kitchener with a small group. And he has just released a
pop-jazz album, ``Fresh Air,'' on his own label. He would be happy,
he said, to compose soundtracks for movies and television.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile steel-band jobs keep Sharpe in motion. His home is in
Miami, where he leads a band for the carnival on Columbus Day
weekend. Around the end of November he goes to stay with his mother
in Trinidad, relaxing until the day after Christmas, when he begins
serious work on carnival pieces for Trinidad's Panorama; an
arrangement for a top Trinidadian band may bring him $5,000 for the
two-month process. In spring he arranges steel-band music at
Disneyland in California. And he spends July and August in the
panyards of Brooklyn, shaping his latest arrangement.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't come with anything planned, I do it all on the spot,''
he said. ``I have the melody in my head, I hear the chords that go
with it, and I hear the bass that goes with it. I teach the tenor
the melody, and teach the bass, and then I put all the inside music
in. I'm adding a piece, a piece, a piece. I use a little jazz
influence, or drop in a little Latin influence. And I always try to
come up with a better part, so it can be more exciting.''
</P>
<P>
   After the Pan Rebels ran through ``In My House,'' Sharpe got a
new idea for the introduction. ``I'm going to put a part
together,'' he told a visitor. Standing at one of the double-tenor
pans, he plinked out a new harmony line, four notes at a time. One
drummer stood next to him, playing back each group of notes; three
others gathered around to watch. Sharpe made sure the drummer at
his side had both the notes and phrasing right, then moved on to
the cello pans, another layer of harmony.
</P>
<P>
   He hummed a tune for a drummer, and listened as she played it
back to him until the rhythm was crisp. Eventually all eight
sections of the band had been taught, and Sharpe tapped once again
on the side of a shiny steel drum. The ranks of players leaned into
the brand-new music, all the parts meshed easily, and Sharpe gave
his latest handiwork a calmly appraising ear.
</P>
<P>
   Holding drumsticks instead of a baton, dressed in a windbreaker
instead of a tuxedo, he didn't look like a symphony conductor. But
he had a full-sized orchestra at his disposal, eager to realize his
musical impulses as they occurred. ``This is the thing I always
wanted to be,'' he said.

LOUISE PATTERSON, FIGURE IN HARLEM RENAISSANCE, DIES AT 97  
(DW)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Calif., Va., Ala., Russia, Spain)   By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Louise Alone Thompson Patterson, an advocate of civil
rights and leftist causes, a participant in the Harlem Renaissance
and a longtime associate of one of its leading figures, the poet
Langston Hughes, died on Friday at the Amsterdam Nursing Home in
Manhattan. She was 97.
</P>
<P>
   The 1920s and '30s saw an artistic and literary flowering in
Harlem and an outpouring of social criticism examining the position
of blacks in American society. Soon after her arrival in 1928, Mrs.
Patterson, then Louise Thompson, gravitated toward that
intellectual ferment, which became known as the Harlem Renaissance.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Chicago on Sept. 9, 1901, she had experienced racism
while living in a succession of predominantly white towns in the
Pacific Northwest, before entering the University of California at
Berkeley, where she was inspired by a lecture on racism given by
W.E.B. DuBois.
</P>
<P>
   After graduating from Berkeley in 1923 with a degree in
economics, she taught at Hampton Institute in Virginia, which had a
black student body but a predominantly white and paternalistic
administration. She supported a student strike there, then went to
New York to study at the New School for Social Research under a
scholarship from the Urban League.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Thompson entered Harlem Renaissance circles through a
friendship with the painter Aaron Douglas and his wife, Alta, and
she married the writer Wallace Thurman. They separated six months
later. In the late 1920s, she became a secretary to Hughes, and a
long professional association and friendship began.
</P>
<P>
   In 1932, after helping found a Harlem branch of the Friends of
the Soviet Union, she became a leading organizer of a trip to the
Soviet Union by 22 black intellectuals, journalists and writers who
were to make a Soviet-sponsored movie called ``Black and White,''
about white supremacy in America.
</P>
<P>
   She enlisted Hughes' participation in the trip, but the film
project was canceled by Soviet authorities after the group's
arrival, ostensibly because of inefficiency on the part of the
Soviet film company. The real reason may have been Soviet fears
that the film would create enmity in the United States and
jeopardize diplomatic recognition.
</P>
<P>
   Louise Thompson enjoyed her experience of Soviet society and
told how ``the Russians would push us to the front of the queue
line for a bus or ticket, or offer us seats in a crowded
streetcar.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For all of us who experienced discrimination based on color in
our own land, it was strange to find our color a badge of honor,
our key to the city, so to speak,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The group eventually split into two factions. Those who saw
Louise Thompson as too trusting of the Russians nicknamed her
Madame Moscow.
</P>
<P>
   After returning to the United States, she organized a march to
Washington to speak out on the ``Scottsboro Boys'' _ nine black
youths wrongly convicted of raping two white women in Scottsboro,
Ala. She later traveled to Spain on behalf of the Republican cause
in the Spanish Civil War.
</P>
<P>
   She was an organizer of Vanguard, a left-wing salon organized at
her Harlem apartment in the 1930's for cultural presentations and
discussions of Marxist theory. In 1938, she helped Hughes start the
Harlem Suitcase Theater, where he presented his play with music
``Don't You Want to Be Free?'' Hughes dedicated his 1942 collection
of poems, ``Shakespeare in Harlem,'' to her.
</P>
<P>
   In 1940, having moved to Chicago, Louise Thompson married
William Patterson, a figure in the American Communist Party. He
died in 1980. She is survived by a daughter, MaryLouise Patterson
of Manhattan, two granddaughters and a great-grandson.

L.A. VISIT IS BRIEF FOR NFL OFFICIALS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By STEVE DILBECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CARSON _ They came, they saw, they reviewed, they got out of
Dodge.
</P>
<P>
   And in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Three high-ranking members of the NFL staff made a whirlwind
one-day stopover in Southern California on Wednesday, meeting with
representatives of all four areas vying for that fleeting Los
Angeles expansion franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Then they boarded a flight back to New York by 4 p.m. and left
without a single comment.
</P>
<P>
   Fear not, many more meetings remain scheduled. The NFL expansion
committee will meet Sept. 9 in Washington D.C., staff members are
tentatively scheduled to meet with representatives of Los Angeles
and Houston in New York on Sept. 13, and the entire NFL ownership
will meet Oct. 6 in Atlanta, presumably to finally award the 32nd
franchise.
</P>
<P>
   Sandwiched between all that is the NFL's Sept. 15 deadline, when
the Coliseum, Carson, Hollywood Park and Anaheim are all supposed
to have their packages finalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if they're going to change it or not, but they've
established and changed deadlines in the past,'' noted Carson city
manager Jerry Groomes.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's hectic NFL effort was to gather a current assessment
of each site, and the different options available, so that the
staff would be able to make an updated presentation to the
expansion committee in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The NFL was represented Wednesday by Roger Goodell, executive
vice president of league development, Neal Glat, director of
strategic development, and Jeff Pash, executive vice president and
legal counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Groomes and Carson attorney Darold Pieper, they
met with Ed Roski Jr. with the Coliseum group, Anaheim Mayor Tom
Daly and presumedly Marvin Davis, who holds an option on the land
at Hollywood Park.
</P>
<P>
   A Davis spokesperson said he had no comment, even on whether the
meeting even had taken place.
</P>
<P>
   Los Angeles City Councilman Mark Ridley-Thomas issued a
statement, again trying to rally the troops, that ended with: ``We
will play until the very end. We play to win.''
</P>
<P>
   The beleaguered Coliseum effort is currently trying to design a
new financing scheme based on potential tax increment derived from
activity generated at a renovated Exposition Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``To other sites that wish to re-emerge as potential venues, we
say, `Don't even think about it,''' Ridley-Thomas said in his
statement.
</P>
<P>
   That, of course, is exactly what the NFL asked the others to do
last month when it grew frustrated at the lack of public funding
surrounding the Coliseum following its six-month Southern
California exclusive.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they had given a shot to Carson as they gave to the
Coliseum, we would have nailed it,'' Groomes said. ``They wouldn't
be looking for anybody else right now. But can we nail this in two
weeks? Not likely.''
</P>
<P>
   The Carson project includes a connecting shopping mall.
Previously, it was championed by potential franchise owner Michael
Ovitz. When the NFL selected the Coliseum as the Los Angeles site,
Ovitz then designed plans for it, angering some Carson officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a much different situation now,'' Groomes said. ``All
of what was presented to the NFL in the past about Carson went
through Ovitz. This is a conversation directly between us and the
NFL.''
</P>
<P>
   The previous Carson project included $180 million in bonds to
help develop the former dump site. Groomes said the city will
ultimately develop the site regardless of what happens with the
NFL.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't view ourselves as a desperate community trying to
find a life raft in this NFL franchise,'' he said. ``Frankly
speaking, without suggesting we're not interested, we can take it
or leave it. We're going to move on with or without this.''

BAGGAGE AND ALL, STRAWBERRY COMES BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (jt) 
 By JACK CURRY    
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Darryl Strawberry folded his powerful arms, swayed in
a blue chair and leaned forward when he spoke, using the dozens of
reporters in front of him as amateur psychiatrists. Strawberry
talked about making a serious mistake, about being an alcoholic and
about the thrill of finally returning to the Yankees.
</P>
<P>
   There was no bluster or bragging from this Strawberry. He was
sullen and contrite. He hugged almost every Yankee he saw, looked
as physically imposing as ever and claimed that it did not matter
whether he was on the post-season roster.
</P>
<P>
   Mostly, though, Strawberry treated his return news conference at
Yankee Stadium Wednesday night like one of the Alcoholic Anonymous
meetings he says he attends at least once a day. ``This time
around, when I looked in the mirror, I looked at the enemy,''
Strawberry said. ``It was me. It wasn't anyone else. Didn't no one
tell me to pick up that drink. That's the disease of alcoholism. If
you're not doing the 12-step program, you're going to drink, I
don't care who you are. You could be me or you could be Joe Blow.''
</P>
<P>
   After Strawberry was arrested for possessing three-tenths of a
gram of cocaine and for solicitation of a prostitute last April 14
in Tampa, Fla., he said that he had been drinking and was
depressed. He said that had helped push him into a compromising
situation. Strawberry pleaded no-contest to the charges and was
suspended from baseball for 113 days. He emphasized Wednesday that
he never should have resumed drinking and never should have
committed any crimes.
</P>
<P>
   So Strawberry, now 37 years old, began another well-publicized
comeback Wednesday, his fourth with the Yankees since 1995, and
probably his last. If the owner George Steinbrenner had not
supported Strawberry and had tried to void his contract for
behavioral reasons, Strawberry's career would probably have ended.
</P>
<P>
   It nearly did last October, when he had surgery for colon
cancer. But after six months of chemotherapy that ended in April,
the Yankee doctors say there has been no sign of the disease.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm quite sure he feels like this is it,'' said David Cone, a
teammate of Strawberry's with the Mets and Yankees. ``He needs to
take advantage of this one.''
</P>
<P>
   To conquer addiction, Strawberry said that he once again
participated in Alcoholic Anonymous' 12-step recovery program. He
said with pride that he was two weeks away from being sober for
five months. He focused exclusively on alcoholism and did not
mention cocaine once.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many people that relapse, but they're not Darryl
Strawberry,'' he said. ``Some die. Some never make it back. It's a
gift to be able to make it back, and I accept that gift. That's the
most important thing. I put my recovery at the top of my list. No
matter what pain I might face, I can't allow myself not to go to
meetings anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   While Strawberry waved a bat like a toothpick during batting
practice, Manager Joe Torre spoke about how he would try to find
him some at-bats in the final month of the regular season. Torre
hinted that Strawberry would start at designated hitter against
Oakland Thursday afternoon because Chili Davis would be rested in
the day game after a night game.
</P>
<P>
   With 332 career home runs, including 24 in 101 games last
season, Strawberry is a formidable presence on the Yankee bench,
and Torre would love to spot him as a pinch-hitter a few times a
week. But he is unsure whether the 17-year veteran can stay sharp
with so few at-bats. So Torre might use Strawberry in left field or
at DH once or twice a week, and as a pinch-hitter a few times, to
determine whether he can help the Yankees in October.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he is a weapon, we'll incorporate it into the club,'' Torre
said. ``We pretty much have to figure out if he is a weapon.''
</P>
<P>
   When Strawberry was asked about his surgically-repaired left
knee and his mobility in the outfield, he gave a brief response
about feeling fine. Then he started talking about spirituality.
Similarly, when he was questioned about his chances of making the
post-season roster, the chief reason he spent almost a month at
Class AAA Columbus getting into baseball shape, Strawberry again
sounded very mellow.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not important at all,'' Strawberry said. ``What's
important to me is to live one day at a time and take care of
myself. I'm not saying I don't want to be on the playoff roster. If
I get playing time and I play well enough and Joe feels that way,
fine. If not, that's fine, too.''  &QL;

<P>
   Paul Showers, author of a series of science books for young
readers and a former editor for The New York Times, died on July 17
at the home of his daughter, Dr. Kate B. Showers, in Orange, Mass.
He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   He wrote some 25 science-related books in the ``Let's Read and
Find Out'' series, all first published by Crowell. One of them,
``Before You Were a Baby'' (1968), was written jointly with his
wife, Dr. Kay Matteson Sperry, a psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   The first in the series, ``Find Out by Touching'' (1961),
enjoyed a success that led Showers to keep on writing juvenile
nonfiction. Another book in the series, ``The Listening Walk''
(1961), was praised by a reviewer in The New York Times Book Review
who wrote, ``An ordinary walk won't seem like the same old route
after being alerted by Paul Showers to listen for sounds along the
way.''
</P>
<P>
   Showers' other books included ``The Moon Walker,'' about how
babies learn to move, ``Sleep Is for Everyone,'' ``Use Your
Brain,'' ``How You Talk,'' ``Me and My Family Tree,'' ``A Book of
Scary Things'' and ``The Bird and the Stars.'' His writings have
been translated into Dutch, French, Japanese and Portuguese and
Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   He was on the staff of The Times' Sunday department from 1946 to
1976, serving as a copy editor on the Sunday magazine and in other
posts. He also wrote numerous articles and book reviews for The
Times.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Sunnyside, Wash., he spent much of his youth in Michigan
and received a bachelor's degree in 1931 from the University of
Michigan. He became an Army staff sergeant in World War II and was
an editor of Yank, the Army weekly, in Okinawa. Early in his career
he worked for The Detroit Free Press and The New York Herald
Tribune.
</P>
<P>
   His 1946 marriage to Dr. Sperry ended in divorce in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Besides his daughter, a research fellow at Boston University,
who has since moved to Petersham, Mass., he is survived by a
grandson.

LABOR BEGINS CAMPAIGN TO PROTECT EFFORTS TO JOIN UNIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  (dal) 
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The city's trade unions kicked off the nation's Labor
Day celebrations on Wednesday with a large rally in Central Park
that highlighted one of the labor movement's principal themes,
claiming that employers often violate the right of workers to join
unions.
</P>
<P>
   To hammer home that theme, the labor movement used six immigrant
workers as spokesmen, and they described how their employers had
either dismissed them or threatened them to discourage them from
forming unions.
</P>
<P>
   At a breakfast that brought together 400 labor leaders,
politicians and religious leaders, one of the immigrants, Fatima
Pareja, a 34-year-old leather worker from Ecuador, told how a
handbag factory had dismissed her because she supported a
unionization drive aimed at improving wages and safety conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The other immigrant spokesmen _ two limousine drivers, a
computer operator, a janitor and a food-service worker _ also
described how they and their fellow workers had been harassed for
supporting a union.
</P>
<P>
   ``These six workers represent millions of workers who want to
make themselves and our movement stronger by joining our unions,''
said John J. Sweeney, president of the AFL-CIO. ``But they cannot
do so because their employers are willing to bend the law and break
the law and use the courts to remake the law. It is a national
disgrace.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney, who heads a federation with 13 million members,
returned to New York, his hometown, for the march and rally, hoping
that it would set the tone and theme for dozens of other union
rallies scheduled for this weekend in other cities.
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said that with Wednesday's rally, the labor movement was
beginning a new campaign called ``Voice at Work: Freedom to Choose
a Union.''
</P>
<P>
   The effort, he said, would ``shine a light of shame on employers
who violate workers' rights not only in New York City, but in
thousands of communities across our country.''
</P>
<P>
   At the breakfast at the Sheraton New York Hotel, Denis Hughes,
the new president of the New York State AFL-CIO, urged the dozens
of labor leaders to pressure political officials to do more to
safeguard workers when they speak out for unions and hold elections
to win union representation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the new civil rights movement of the next millennium,
and we're going to fight for it,'' Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   The city's unions held their Labor Day rally on Wednesday rather
than on the actual Monday holiday because they saw that it was
difficult in past years to persuade large numbers of workers to
attend a parade on a three-day weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Union leaders also decided this year not to hold the rally on
the Saturday after Labor Day _ as they had the last three years _
because this year that day is the Jewish holiday Rosh Hashana.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday's rally was far smaller than the parades of the last
three years. The police estimated that more than 100,000 union
members marched in each of those parades up Fifth Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   The leaders of the New York City Central Labor Council, the
umbrella group representing the city's more than 1 million union
members, estimated that 25,000 people took part in Wednesday's
march along Central Park South and the subsequent rally at the
Central Park Summerstage. But several union officials said
privately that there were probably not more than 10,000 people at
the rally.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   In the march, there was a large turnout from workers
representing electricians, carpenters, teachers, teamsters,
operating engineers and garment workers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, labor leaders said they had no intention of
trying to turn the rally into a huge event, saying they would
husband their energies for future rallies.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McLaughlin, president of the city's central labor council,
said that over the next year the city's unions would stress several
themes: improving public education, insuring adequate health care
for all New Yorkers and providing child care for all working
families that need it.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the events, one of the main themes was how to help
immigrant workers raise their wages, improve their working
conditions and remove obstacles to their joining unions.
</P>
<P>
   Donna Rivera, who worked for a contractor that did computer work
for the city's child services agency, said her employer refused to
pay overtime or holiday pay and fired several workers who backed a
union, including her.
</P>
<P>
   Mohamed Bedir, a limousine driver from Egypt, said his employer
had sought to block a unionization drive and deny benefits by
declaring that his drivers were independent contractors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The boss tried to take advantage of us,'' Bedir said,
``because we were immigrants and didn't know our rights, but we
will fight him.''
</P>
<P>
   Sweeney said, ``It's shocking to hear what things are like for
so many immigrant workers who try to form unions.''  &QL;

 &HT;    MEXICAN PRESIDENT HECKLED BY OPPOSITION DURING STATE OF UNION
SPEECH
 &HT;    By SUSAN FERRISS 
 &HT;    c.1999 Cox News Service 
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ Mexican President Ernesto Zedillo's annual state
of the union address turned into a raucous event Wednesday night,
with mostly leftist opposition members of Congress punctuating the
speech with verbal attacks about corruption and poverty.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why so much optimism if 30 million people live in poverty?''
said one of a number of banners also waved at the normally calm
event.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo _ who has clearly staked out greater democracy in Mexico
as his legacy _ was interrupted repeatedly when he touched on
topics like rural poverty and reforms that have been enacted to end
corrupt elections.
</P>
<P>
   Hecklers from Mexico's leftist Democratic Revolutionary Party
(PRD) also criticized Zedillo for his administration's policies in
Chiapas state.
</P>
<P>
   Banners urged the president to ``stop militarization'' and
withdraw Mexican troops from that state in southern Mexico, which
has been rocked over the last several weeks by renewed clashes
between the Mexican Army and civilian sympathizers of the state's
Zapatista rebels.
</P>
<P>
   At first the heckling from members of Congress seemed limited to
a small group. But the angry mood was contagious. After Zedillo
finished his speech, members of Zedillo's party _ the long-ruling
Revolutionary Institutional Party, or PRI _ began to wave fists and
shout insults at the opposition congressman who was chosen to
deliver a rebuttal to Zedillo.
</P>
<P>
   Until 1997, Mexico's Congress was dominated by the PRI, which
usually rubber-stamped whatever the president sent to it. Now
Mexico's opposition parties form an majority bloc in Congress, from
left to right.
</P>
<P>
   The parties are even considering forming an alliance to
challenge the PRI in next year's presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo is entering his last year as president and despite the
catcalls he appears to be enjoying a his highest level of
popularity. On Wednesday, Mexico City's Reforma newspaper published
a poll showing that 66 percent of Mexicans approve of the way
Zedillo is managing the country.
</P>
<P>
   Zedillo devoted the first part of his speech to describing
advances in education, healthcare and other social services.
Hecklers first exploded when he began to talk about Mexico's
agricultural population, and he suggested that Mexico is ``leaving
behind'' a crisis that has hurt its farmers.
</P>
<P>
   ``In general, the dispute for land is over,'' Zedillo also said,
drawing more jeers.
</P>
<P>
   Carlos Medina Plascenia of Mexico's conservative National Action
Party, who later delivered the rebuttal, ordered the hecklers to
respect Zedillo. But as Zedillo's speech went on, Medina ended up
having to beg for calm from his opposition colleagues more than
half a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Zedillo kept speaking over the din, urging tolerance
and describing electoral reforms designed to give candidates equal
access to the media and to make the country's 2000 presidential
elections the most competitive in history.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today in Mexico no one is persecuted for his ideas or beliefs,
nor for organizing to fight for those beliefs,'' Zedillo added,
over jeers. ``Today in Mexico nobody is censured for what they say,
write or publish.''
</P>
<P>
   At first Zedillo appeared stunned by the heckling, but then he
began to smile and deliver his planned remarks more loudly and
deliberately.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tolerance is to respect the practices and opinions of others,
although they may be different from our own,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   After shaking hands with Zedillo, Medina began his rebuttal,
instantly drawing shouts of protest from Zedillo supporters.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does us no good to hear one more time that 'things are
going well' while poverty continues to dangerously increase,''
Medina said, looking uncomfortable as congressmen on the floor
milled around, shouting at him and at each other.
</P>
<P>
   After the event was over, a Zedillo administration aide said he
thought Zedillo was ``a bit amused at the spectacle'' of the
evening. ``But I don't think he liked it,'' the aide said.

NAVY TO EXPAND PROWLER FORCE AT WHIDBEY ISLAND N.A.S. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ED OFFLEY  
 c.1999 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pentagon has authorized the Navy to create a new EA-6B
Prowler squadron at Whidbey Island Naval Air Station in response to
higher-than-anticipated demands on the radar-jamming units during
the air war in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The squadron will have a standard makeup of four aircraft and
184 personnel, including 24 pilots and electronic countermeasures
officers and 160 enlisted technicians. The unit would be the fifth
Whidbey-based Prowler squadron dedicated to supporting Air Force
units that operate from land-based facilities overseas.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to beef up the Prowler force is one of the first
Pentagon steps to adjust the armed forces in the wake of a review
of ``lessons learned'' from Kosovo, a Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   The primary impetus for creating the new squadron is to avoid
undue strains on the Prowler force and its people, the Pentagon
official said. ``This is sort of like a relief valve,'' the
official said. ``It will allow a little bit more flexibility (for
the Prowler aircrews) and it will allow more time between
deployments.''
</P>
<P>
   Three months after the Kosovo conflict ended, the pace of
overseas deployments has already resumed for the Whidbey units. Of
the six units that flew combat missions in Kosovo, one is still on
deployment, two have returned and left on new overseas missions, a
fourth is preparing to deploy for six months in late September, and
the other two are engaged in training missions at the Oak Harbor
base located about 55 miles northeast of Seattle, a Whidbey
official said.
</P>
<P>
   The Pentagon plan includes accelerating research into developing
a new jamming aircraft to replace the EA-6B by 2015, officials
said. The military trade newsletter ``Inside the Navy,'' which
initially disclosed the plan earlier this week, said the new
F/A-18E/F Super Hornet is the most likely candidate to become the
follow-on aircraft for the Prowler, which first entered service in
1971.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said initial steps to organize the new Whidbey
squadron would begin in 2001 with activation in 2003. ``There is a
long lead time'' for assembling the aircraft and personnel and
initial training, a Pentagon official said.
</P>
<P>
   Defense officials said Wednesday they could discuss the
tentative plan only on condition of anonymity.
</P>
<P>
   The decision to expand the Prowler force by only one squadron of
four aircraft stems from the fact that the EA-6B airframe is no
longer in production and there are no plans to reopen the assembly
line. There are 123 Prowlers in the Navy-Marine Corps inventory, of
which about 31 are undergoing modernization or maintenance.
</P>
<P>
   Navy officials say they are arranging loans of aircraft to units
in training and providing deploying squadrons with the full number
of Prowlers they require. During Kosovo, one Whidbey squadron
returned home without any of its aircraft, which were left behind
in Europe and divided up among several other squadrons flying
combat missions.
</P>
<P>
   There are 19 EA-6B Prowler squadrons in service, including 14
based at Whidbey Island, four operated by the Marine Corps out of
Cherry Point, N.C., and one operated by the Navy Reserves at
Andrews Air Force Base near Washington, D.C.
</P>
<P>
   The EA-6B mission is to knock out enemy air-defense systems by
jamming radar systems and by hitting them with the missiles.
</P>
<P>
   The Defense Department relied heavily on the Prowlers to defend
U.S. and NATO aircraft during the 78-day air campaign against
Serbia, which involved thousands of air strikes.
</P>
<P>
   The Prowler is the U.S. military's only electronic warfare
aircraft and is essential to protect both American and allied
planes in combat.

MARSHALS ACTING ON RENO'S ORDERS SEIZE WACO TAPE FROM THE FBI
</HEADLINE>
  
 (SUBS to recast grafs 3 thru 6 to stress Reno's anger; picks up
original text at `The disclosure of...' In 2nd graf, inserts
`officials said' and `including many children.' Adds sentence to
5th graf about transfer of the tape to FBI headquarters.)    (nk) 
 By DAVID JOHNSTON and NEIL A. LEWIS   
 c.1999 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno on Wednesday ordered
U.S. marshals to the FBI's headquarters to seize a previously
undisclosed tape recording of voice communications between FBI
commanders and field agents during the 1993 tear gas assault at the
Branch Davidian compound, Justice Department officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The recording, officials said, contains the voices of agents
asking for and receiving authorization from their operational
commanders at Waco, Texas, to fire inflammable military tear-gas
rounds at a covered bunker not far from the main Branch Davidian
compound several hours before a deadly fire ignited, leaving about
80 people dead, including many children.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure a week ago that agents had used the military tear
gas rounds infuriated Reno, forced her to acknowledge that her
credibility had been damaged and led her to decide Wednesday to
form an independent inquiry into the matter, Justice Department
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The officials said the extraordinary order for marshals to seize
the tapes from the FBI was intended as a harsh rebuke for the
bureau's failure to hand over information related to the central
issue of who started the deadly fire.
</P>
<P>
   Reno was said by subordinates to be furious when she was told of
the existence of a tape that had remained in FBI files for more
than six years. It was discovered on Saturday at the FBI's training
academy in Quantico, Va., in the offices of the Hostage Rescue
Team, the unit that was heavily criticized for its tactics in
carrying out the Waco assault, law-enforcement officials said.
Later, the tape was transferred to FBI headquarters here.
</P>
<P>
   Myron Marlin, a Justice Department spokesman, said Wednesday
night that the Justice Department did not learn of the tape's
existence until Wednesday. ``The FBI informed the department that
it had come across the material in Quantico, Va.,'' he said. ``On
learning of the discovery of the material, senior officials of the
Justice Department immediately directed the marshals to take
possession of and inventory the materials at the FBI's
headquarters.''
</P>
<P>
   Even before the latest disclosure, Reno had decided to open an
independent investigation of the 1993 siege, and officials said
Wednesday that she planned to name a prominent figure to head the
inquiry, making her choice from a short list that included
Republicans, among them former senators, law-enforcement officials
said Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's list of people under consideration does not include any
present or former officials of the Justice Department or the FBI.
The officials said that Reno had added and subtracted names in
recent days from a list that has at times included former
Republican Sens. John Danforth of Missouri and Warren Rudman of New
Hampshire. Another candidate is Dan K. Webb, a prominent Chicago
lawyer who was a highly successful Republican-appointed federal
prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   The disclosure of the tape represents another deeply wounding
blow to the credibility of Reno and FBI officials who had said
repeatedly in the years since the operation that they had unearthed
all relevant information about the assault before concluding that
there was no possibility that the FBI had caused the fire.
</P>
<P>
   The recording is on the audio track of an infrared videotape
that picked up heat images from inside the compound. The tape was
made by an aircraft flying over the site at the time the tear-gas
canisters were launched at the bunker. Law-enforcement officials
said the tape supports their account that the flammable canisters
bounced harmlessly off the bunker's roof and could not have ignited
the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Arson investigators had found evidence that gasoline, charcoal
lighter fluid and camp stove fuel had been poured inside the wooden
structure, and they said that the fire appeared to have started in
three places. The FBI also cited evidence from listening devices
that recorded ambiguous conversation of Davidians discussing
possible plans for a fire just hours before the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the disclosure of the use of two incendiary
military tear-gas rounds prompted an uproar that has forced Reno to
announce that she would reopen a long-closed internal inquiry into
the operation.
</P>
<P>
   In an unusual scene Wednesday afternoon at FBI headquarters,
agents from the marshal's service arrived at the J. Edgar Hoover
Building on Pennsylvania Avenue, the FBI's headquarters across the
street from the Justice Department, to take the tape and related
materials. The step was said by officials to be taken as a rebuke
by Reno to the bureau for its failures to turn over information
related to the central question of who started the deadly fire.
</P>
<P>
   Reno's action seemed almost certain to further strain the
increasingly uneasy relationship between Reno and FBI Director
Louis J. Freeh. Earlier in Reno's tenure, the two were close
allies, but their relationship, while publicly cordial, has
privately soured over several issues, most recently this week after
Freeh's aides announced his desire for an independent inquiry into
Waco before Reno announced her own support for it.
</P>
<P>
   At the FBI, officials said that they were embarrassed by the
discovery, but did not try to conceal it. They said it had been
unearthed during a thorough search of the offices of the hostage
rescue unit, which is now part of a larger group called the
Critical Incident Response Group.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FBI located important items and brought them to the
attention the Justice Department,'' said John Collingwood, an FBI
spokesman. ``We are cooperating fully with the effort to identify
and preserve anything that may bear on the firing of the military
gas rounds.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the FBI did not object to the marshal service action.
``We are in full agreement that the FBI not maintain possession of
anything located that may bear on the issue,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, senior Republicans in Congress are considering
a separate, exhaustive investigation that would examine the
government's conduct during the entire Waco episode, and not be
limited to the final day of the siege at the Branch Davidian
compound that ended in a fire in which about 80 cult members died,
many of them children.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said he would soon introduce legislation to establish a
wide-ranging investigation of the events at Waco. Hyde's
legislation would establish a five-member investigative commission
that would examine everything that happened during the government's
handling of the Waco matter, including but not restricted to the
fateful raid in which fire consumed the Davidians main structure.
</P>
<P>
   The commission could take more than a year to complete its work
and would be aimed, in the words of a Hyde assistant, ``at insuring
that this matter is put to rest once and for all.''
</P>
<P>
   The aide, Sam Stratman, said that the commission would try to
``find out everything that happened, everything. We would want to
get the definitive answers so that we are not having to deal with
new conspiracy theories in years to come based on newly emerging
facts.''
</P>
<P>
   The congressionally authorized commission would likely have
subpoena power and a generous budget. The Democratic and Republican
leaders of the House and the Senate would each choose a member.
Those four, in turn, would select the fifth member who would be the
chairman.
</P>
<P>
   And just as Reno is looking for someone with a solid reputation
for probity to lead the Department's efforts, it is likely that the
Congress would seek to have the commission members, especially the
chairman, be people with impeccable credentials.
</P>
<P>
   But Democratic officials in Congress Wednesday said that they
might not support the commission that Hyde is contemplating if
Reno's investigation appears to be credible and sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Julian Epstein, the Democratic staff director of the House
Judiciary Committee, said that there would be no need for two
competing investigations and the Reno effort should take precedence
over any by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should have an outside independent investigation by
individuals who have unquestioned credentials and expertise,'' said
Epstein, who is a top aide to Rep. John Conyers Jr., D-Mich., the
ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``We expect that the attorney general is going to appoint such a
person or persons and so long as that is so,'' Epstein said. ``The
legislation for a congressional commission would be moot.''
Similarly, some senior advisers to Republican leaders said it was
unclear that there would be support for such a wide-ranging
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   The recent revelations that some incendiary devices were used on
the day of the siege, despite years of denials, has also spawned a
third likely investigation, by Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., that could
lead to public hearings as early as next month, his spokesman said
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Burton, chairman of the House Committee on government Reform,
Wednesday sent committee subpoenas to the White House, FBI and
Justice Department demanding all records, phone logs, faxes and any
communications those agencies had with the siege headquarters at
Waco at the time of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   Burton had on Tuesday subpoenaed the same information from the
Defense Department and a federal prosecutor in Texas long involved
in Waco matters.
</P>
<P>
   A major problem for any new inquiry into Waco, senior
law-enforcement officials agree, is that most of the major players
are locked into sworn testimony about what happened.
</P>
<P>
   There is, however, at least one unanswered question: Which
officials at what level decided to play down and thereby
effectively conceal the use of the incendiary tear gas devices?
</P>
<P>
   Some bureau officials have said that they believe no one
deliberately concealed anything but rather thought the use of the
pyrotechnic devices were not material to the assault on the
compound and were in no way related to the fatal fire. The grenades
were fired six hours before the fire started and were directed not
at the residence that burned, but at a nearby bunker.
</P>
<P>
   No official, not even Reno, has suggested that they now believe
that the tear-gas grenades contributed to the fire.
</P>
<P>
   Arson investigators found evidence that gasoline, charcoal
lighter fluid and camp stove fuel had been poured inside the wooden
structure, and they said that the fire appeared to have started in
three places. The FBI also cited evidence from listening devices
that included recordings of Davidians discussing plans for a fire
just hours before the blaze.
</P>
<P>
   The expiration of the independent counsel law in June would have
no impact on the effort to mount an independent review of Waco,
officials said, because the Justice Department inquiry would not be
a prosecutor's task but more akin to blue-ribbon investigative
panel. If anyone were to be found to have committed a possible
crime of concealment or anything else, that person could then be
prosecuted by the Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said through a spokesman Wednesday that his inquiry was
needed to determine ``whether the Justice Department misled the
American people and Congress.'' The spokesman, John Williams, said
that Burton's inquiry would focus on three issues: the use of
incendiary devices, the possible use of military personnel in the
assault on the compound, which is prohibited by law, and
accusations that a helicopter used by the FBI fired on the compound
just hours before the fatal assault.
</P>
<P>
   The accusations about the use of the military and an FBI
helicopter have been spread on the Internet and elsewhere by the
wide assortment of Waco conspiracy enthusiasts. ``We have no firm
evidence of any of these allegations,'' Williams said, adding that
Burton believes it is necessary to investigate them.

ARIZONA GIRL'S ABORTION CASE ADDS TO DEBATE IN KANSAS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN A. DVORAK  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   As if Kansas didn't have enough conflict over abortion, now
comes Arizona with new ammunition for the battle.
</P>
<P>
   The case of a 14-year-old girl, who six months into her
pregnancy received approval to travel from Arizona to Kansas for an
abortion, may help galvanize sentiment in the Kansas Legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Tony Powell of Wichita, an outspoken abortion opponent,
said, ``Cases like this once again bring us to the reality that
Kansas is the abortion capital of the nation. I think this case
helps us.''
</P>
<P>
   But Erika Fox, an abortion rights advocate and vice president
for public policy for Planned Parenthood of Kansas and
Mid-Missouri, said the girl's case illustrates the difficult
choices a troubled pregnancy may lead to.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do not think that it is necessarily harmful to our cause,''
Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   The girl, a possible rape victim, apparently will end the
pregnancy at Women's Health Care Services in Wichita, where
physician George Tiller has gained wide attention for providing
late-term abortions. One report Wednesday said she already had
arrived in the state.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, foes of abortion have tried to pass laws that
would stop late-term abortions in Kansas. One law did go on the
books in 1998, but it has been faulted for being contradictory and
unclear.
</P>
<P>
   Next year could be showdown time for a new abortion law.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, members of the House and Senate face re-election,
meaning they'll be particularly sensitive to heated issues like
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   Also, the Arizona case is the second in which a girl came to
Kansas for a late-term abortion she could not get at home. The
other was a Michigan case in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   ``For some of us, it is a rallying call,'' said Sen. Karin
Brownlee of Olathe, a leading abortion opponent. ``It's disturbing
that Kansas is known for this type of business.''
</P>
<P>
   But Sen. Lana Oleen of Manhattan, an advocate of abortion
rights, said of the Arizona case, ``I think it's a very sad
situation that will be exploited by some.''
</P>
<P>
   Not many places in the United States offer late-term abortions,
a practice that opponents of abortion condemn. Such abortions
involve a far more developed fetus than abortions done in the early
weeks of pregnancy.
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona teen is 24 weeks pregnant. No clinic in Arizona
provides abortions at that stage.
</P>
<P>
   The girl lives under the control of state authorities rather
than parents, and she ran away for several weeks after becoming
pregnant. The Arizona Supreme Court ultimately approved her
abortion.
</P>
<P>
   In the Michigan case, a 12-year-old girl who came to Kansas for
an abortion was said to have been impregnated by her teen-age
brother.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes I think it's helpful to be able to visualize the
type of situation a family could face,'' Fox said.
</P>
<P>
   On Wednesday, people opposed to abortion gathered outside
Tiller's office in Wichita in an attempt to talk to the Arizona
girl, said David Gittrich, executive director of Kansans for Life,
the Wichita-based anti-abortion group.
</P>
<P>
   The case will be cited during debate in the Legislature next
year, he predicted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can guarantee we're going to address it in the elections.''
</P>
<P>
   The Legislature probably will consider several abortion bills. A
ban on a procedure called ``partial-birth abortion'' is one
possibility. There also could be an attempt to outlaw all late-term
abortions.
</P>
<P>
   Senate President Dick Bond of Overland Park, who favors abortion
rights, expects a full battle over the issue and said the Arizona
girl's case might be cited.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know if it adds any more arguments than were already
present,'' Bond said. ``I've anticipated a high-level, intense
debate in an election year.''

LAKERS' DEAL BRINGS A.C. BACK TO L.A.
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By HOWARD BECK  
 c.1999 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   INGLEWOOD _ The Lakers finally dipped into the free-agent pool
Wednesday and added a big man, but the return of A.C. Green _ six
years removed from his glory years here, his numbers in decline _
is unlikely to fill their vacuum at power forward.
</P>
<P>
   Green, who won championships with the Lakers in 1987 and '88,
was obtained in a sign-and-trade deal with the Dallas Mavericks,
who acquired reserve center Sean Rooks. Green, who played the last
two-plus seasons in Dallas, signed a three-year contract before the
trade.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Lakers' decision to trade for Green, who turns 36
next month, rather than sign him as a free agent, indicates they
are still looking for help _ the one-for-one trade leaves the
roster at 11 players.
</P>
<P>
   The trade also reflected the Lakers' frustration with Rooks, who
signed a seven-year, $13.2 million contract with them three years
ago but never became a consistent backup to Shaquille O'Neal. The
Lakers unloaded the remaining four years and $9.12 million on his
contract.
</P>
<P>
   The trade sends Rooks, a seven-year veteran, back to the team
that drafted him in 1992. And it brings Green back to his original
team, just in time to make another run at a championship or two.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy with the final result,'' said Green, who also
considered the Sacramento Kings and Miami Heat. ``There's just so
much history here. I have a long-term relationship here more than
with any other organization. It's just really something to be able
to come back and hopefully complete where you started a career.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an answer to many close friends' prayers, to be sure.
I'm close to home (near Culver City) and to my home church and the
community here in L.A.''
</P>
<P>
   Whether the devout Green is the answer to Laker fans' prayers,
the ones asking for a starting power forward, remains to be seen.
Green joins Robert Horry and Travis Knight in the mix, with no
clear starter among them.
</P>
<P>
   Though Green has averaged 10.4 points and 7.8 rebounds in his
14-year career, those figures dipped to 2.7 points and 2.0 rebounds
during the lockout-shortened 1999 season, and he was replaced in
the starting lineup by Gary Trent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know I'm more than capable of playing whatever the position
might be or the minutes that might be required,'' said Green.
</P>
<P>
   The Lakers also announced they have signed special consultant
Walt Hazzard to a two-year contract extension.

H&AMP;R BLOCK BUYS OLDE FINANCIAL CORP. 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By GENE MEYER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ H&AMP;R Block Inc. said Wednesday that, in its
largest diversification bid yet, it was paying $850 million in cash
to buy Olde Financial Corp., owner of the country's fourth-largest
securities discount brokerage.
</P>
<P>
   Olde Discount Corp.'s brokerage offices in 35 states serve more
than 600,000 clients, whose incomes and other household
circumstances on average nearly match those of about one-fourth of
Block's traditional tax service clients, Block and securities
analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts described the purchase as a good fit that could
increase Block's profit at least 6 cents a share this fiscal year,
which will end in April, and help Block become a broader-based
company more quickly.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Block's stock fell as much as 13 percent in
heavier-than-normal trading on the New York Stock Exchange before
it recouped more than half of that in a late rally. The shares
closed Wednesday at 51, down 4 5//8.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts said investors sold initially because credit rating
agencies, including Moody's Investors Service Inc., expressed
concern about the debts Block is piling up with its two-year string
of acquisitions and because Olde has had highly visible run-ins
with securities regulators.
</P>
<P>
   Olde and three of its former executives, including its
then-chairman and founder, last year agreed to pay $7 million to
settle federal allegations that the company encouraged its brokers
to defraud clients by promoting stocks that paid the highest
commissions to brokers. Olde paid the settlement without admitting
to or denying the allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Block went to great lengths in the purchase negotiations to make
sure Olde has reformed its practices and ``now has a compliance
culture that is considered sound,'' said Linda McDougall, Block's
media relations chief.
</P>
<P>
   Neither Block's debt nor Olde's trouble with regulators appears
insurmountable, and Block's revenue and earnings will increase
markedly when Block further pulls its many new parts into a whole,
said analyst Pete Heckmann at George K. Baum &AMP; Co. in Kansas City.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now it's time during the next 12 to 18 months for the company
to buckle down and integrate,'' Heckmann said.
</P>
<P>
   Olde has a sales force of about 1,200 registered securities
representatives in 181 offices across the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Presuming that the acquisition is completed before tax-filing
season starts in January, ``we will have in place the major
building blocks to achieve our vision of becoming the preferred tax
and financial partner for our clients,'' said Frank L. Salizzoni,
Block's president and chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Olde, a privately held firm based in Detroit, will be the second
securities broker that Block, of Kansas City, has bought in a
two-year drive to begin converting as many of its 9,000 U.S.
seasonal tax offices as practical into year-round full-service
financial centers. Block also owns Birchtree Financial, a much
smaller Kansas City financial planning organization that offers
stock, bond and mutual fund trading.
</P>
<P>
   Some of Block's other big buys have been of major regional
accounting firms that serve business and higher-income clients.
Included is the previous record $290 million it paid this summer
for the nation's seventh-largest accounting firm, McGladrey &AMP;
Pullen.

TRUMP'S CASINO DEAL STILL NOT SEALED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By TED SICKINGER  
 c. 1999 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ What are the odds that The Donald is coming
to Kansas City?
</P>
<P>
   It's still up in the air.
</P>
<P>
   Under the terms of the $15 million deal that Donald Trump
reached in January to buy the Flamingo Hilton Casino in Kansas
City, either party could walk away from the deal if it didn't close
by midnight Aug. 31.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, however, is still bogged down in background checks at
the Missouri Gaming Commission, which has taken longer than
expected to deliver its judgment on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   Now the deadline has come and gone, and Hilton is rumored to be
quietly shopping the property to parties other than Trump.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies, however, are maintaining poker faces. Neither
would comment last week on the approaching deadline. Neither
returned calls Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   A Hilton subsidiary still owns the Kansas City casino despite
spinning off virtually all of the rest of its far-flung casino
empire into Park Place Entertainment Inc. last year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't heard anything from either company,'' said Harold
Bailey, a spokesman for the Gaming Commission. ``We're not at this
time ready to make a recommendation to the commissioners regarding
(Trump's) suitability to do business in the state.''
</P>
<P>
   The commission next meets on Sept. 22 in St. Louis. If the
Trump-Hilton deal falls through, the commission is back to where it
was in January, reopening Hilton's licensing investigation because
of bribery and perjury allegations.
