<HEADLINE> Finland to Help China Test Diseases in Newborns </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A Finnish Company signed an
agreement with Chinese Red Cross Foundation today for the donation
of medical equipment valued at 200,000 US dollars.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, five sets of pre- and neonatal
screening equipment from Finland's Wallac Oy will be used for
diagnosis of congenital diseases of newborns, such as
hypothyroidism and PKU, which are widespread in China.
</P>
<P>
The donation is designed to help the Chinese Ministry of Public
Health carry out its "Mother and Baby Health Care" project, said
Yin Dakui, the vice-minister of public health, during the signing
ceremony.
</P>
<P>
The president of Wallac, Rabbe Clemets, explained that improved
testing of thyroid-related diseases is vital to newborns, as such
diseases can result in severe retardation and reduce life
expectancy.
</P>
<P>
The 10th anniversary of the scientific and technical
cooperation agreement between China and Finland will be celebrated
this week.
</P>
<P>
The donation complements this cooperation program and its
principles, said Antti Kallionmaki, the Finnish minister of Trade
and Industry.
</P>
<P>
Wang Guangying, vice chairman of the Standing Committee of the
National People's Congress, Sun Baiqiu, the vice president of the
Chinese Red Cross Foundation and officials from the Chinese
Ministry of Public Health also attended the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
Wallac was founded in Turku, Finland in 1950, and started
business activities in China in 1979. It is now part of the
American Company EG&AMP;G Inc.

<HEADLINE> Norway Sends Environmental Message to Japan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Norway has sent environmental
message to Nagano before it hosts the 1998 Games.
</P>
<P>
"I think the most important message from Lillehammer is that
we have to be aware of the environment," Reuters quoted Audun
Tron, the mayor of Lillehammer, which staged the 1994 Games.
</P>
<P>
"We just can't continue to have mega-events, sports events,
without taking care of the environment," Tron said.
</P>
<P>
Tron was in Nagano to help greet a group of four Norwegians
and one Japanese, who arrived on Wednesday after travelling
16,000 kilometers from Norway to promote environmental awareness.
</P>
<P>
Environmental concerns have been raised about some of the
facilities at Nagano, although organizers said those worries are
being considered.
</P>
<P>
Nagano officials have taken a strong line on the
environment. They have refused a request by the International Ski
Federation to raise the start of the downhill course to 1,800
meters above sea level from the current 1,680 meters because that
would push the course into a national park.
</P>
<P>
Nagano also changed the course for the biathlon because it
might have damaged nesting habitats of rare birds such as
goshawks and buzzards.
</P>
<P>
But some local activists say there will still be some
environmental damage because of the construction of high-speed
trains and highways in preparation for the Games.
</P>
<P>
The Nagano Olympics will run for 16 days starting on February
7, 1998.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Qian Qichen on Arms Control </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
United Nations, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier
Qian Qichen stressed here today that the final conclusion of the
Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty by the United Nations General
Assembly is the first step in the entire process of comprehensive
nuclear disarmament.
</P>
<P>
Qian, also minister of foreign affairs and chairman of the
Chinese Delegation, delivered the statement at the 51st session of
the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He explained that there are still huge stockpiles of nuclear
arms in the world. Some nuclear powers still refuse to undertake
not to be the first to use such weapons. So, "We still have a long
way to go and must continue to work strenuously in order to
achieve the ultimate goal of total elimination of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the Chinese government, Qian reiterated the
following calls:
</P>
<P>
1. The major nuclear powers should renounce their policy of
nuclear deterrence; those possessing huge nuclear arsenals should
continue to drastically cut back their stockpiles;
</P>
<P>
2. All nuclear states should assume the obligation not to be
the first to use nuclear weapons at any time or under any
circumstances; they should unconditionally renounce the use or
threat of use of such weapons against non-nuclear states or
nuclear-free zones; and they should conclude international
instruments to this effect without delay;
</P>
<P>
3. Those states which have deployed nuclear weapons overseas
should withdraw them completely; all nuclear states should pledge
support to the moves to set up nuclear-free zones; they should
respect the status of such zones and assume corresponding
obligations;
</P>
<P>
4. All states should refrain from developing or deploying
weapons systems in outer space and missile defense systems that
undermine strategic security and stability; and
</P>
<P>
5. All states should negotiate with a view to concluding an
international convention on the complete prohibition and thorough
destruction of nuclear weapons.
</P>
<P>
"The Chinese government and people are ready to join hands with
all governments and peoples of the world to strive for the
realization of this lofty goal," Qian said.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Vice Premier Addresses UN on World Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua)--Chinese Vice Premier and
Minister of Foreign Affairs Qian Qichen said today that a counter
current of trade protectionism has arisen in the ranks of
developed countries designed to hamstring the development of
developing countries.
</P>
<P>
Qian, who is also Chairman of the Delegation of the People's
Republic of China, said in his statement at the 51st Session of
the United Nations General Assembly that some developing countries
have achieved sustained and rapid economic growth, thereby giving
a great impetus to world economic growth.
</P>
<P>
These and other changes in the world scene, he said,"have
widened the prospects of international cooperation. Regrettably,
however, a counter current of trade protectionism has recently
arisen in the ranks of developed countries designed to hamstring
the development of developing countries and exclude them from the
decision-making process of major world economic issues.
</P>
<P>
Facing the tide of economic globalization, neither developed
nor developing countries should resort to trade protectionism, he
pointed out. Only by enhancing international exchanges and
cooperation on the basis of equality and mutual benefit, can we
jointly cope with new problems arising in the course of world
economic advance and achieve sustained common development and
prosperity, he said.
</P>
<P>
No one should overlook the unevenness of world development and
the further widening gap between developed and developing
countries, he stressed. The least developed countries are in
distress and the risk of marginalization is looming large. To make
matters worse, the amount of official development aid from richer
countries is shrinking every year with harsher strings attached.
</P>
<P>
The international community and especially the developed
countries are duty-bound to take effective measures to reverse
this dire situation, he said. To promote economic development and
prosperity of all countries and to eliminate poverty--these should
always be on top of the United Nations agenda.
</P>
<P>
Poverty, unemployment, refugee, crime, over-population,
environmental deterioration, drug abuse and terrorism--these
scourges remain implacable and impede global stability and
development, he said. In the face of such challenges, all
countries should not only carry out social development policies
commensurate to their national conditions, but also actively
cooperate with one another in line with the principle of mutual
respect, equality and mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations needs to enhance its social programs
focusing on developing countries. The international community at
large should press for the implementation of the follow-up actions
of the Cairo Conference on Population and Development, the
Copenhagen World Summit for Social Development and the Beijing
Fourth World Conference on Women in favor of universal social
development, he concluded.

<TEXT>
<P>
United Nations, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice Premier
Qian Qichen said here today that it is imperative for the United
Nations to carry out appropriate rational reforms to better
perform the noble mission of the times and to usher a better world
into the 21st century.
</P>
<P>
Qian, also minister of foreign affairs and chairman of the
Delegation of the People's Republic of China, made the remarks at
the 51st session of the United Nations General Assembly.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that all reforms must be conducive to realizing the
purposes and principles of the Charter and improving the
efficiency of the U.N. and they must also contribute to a more
positive and effective role of the U.N. in promoting world peace
and common development. They must conform to the principles of
sovereign equality among all states, and reflect the aspirations
of the developing countries which comprise more than two-thirds of
the membership, he said, adding that democratic consultations
should be practised through this process.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the serious financial crisis faced by the United
Nations, Qian Qichen called on the major countries in arrears of
their financial contributions to the Organization to fulfill the
financial obligations set forth in the Charter by unconditionally
paying up in full without further delay.

<P>
BEIJING, September 20 (Xinhua) -- The second-phase production
line of glass vacuum solar energy heat concentration pipes has
gone into operation in Beijing, increasing the annual output of
the pipes to five million -- the highest number manufactured in
the world.
</P>
<P>
The 45-million-yuan project was a joint venture between the
Qinghua University Solar Energy Electronic Factory and the Beijing
Glass Instruments Plant.
</P>
<P>
The first phase of project went into production in 1993. Its
output of heat concentration pipes in 1995 reached 650,000, and
the total output value stood at 38 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Glass vacuum solar energy heat concentration pipes are a new
type of light and heat converters. They can be used to heat water,
desalinate seawater, for heating greenhouses and for general
heating purposes.
</P>
<P>
Preparations for the third phase project, with a total
investment of 60 million yuan, are going smoothly.

UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China's economy is
expected to have a growth rate of about 10 percent this year,
maintaining its healthy momentum.
</P>
<P>
This was stated by Chinese Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen in his speech delivered during the General Debate of
the U.N. General Assembly here Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The country's inflation will be kept below 10 percent this
year, Qian said, briefing representatives from different countries
on China's economic development.
</P>
<P>
Grain output for the entire year is expected to top the
previous year's figures, despite severe natural disasters in some
parts of the country, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese vice-premier also said that 17 years of reform and
opening-up have brought about a 4-fold increase of the country's
GNP. China's overall national strength will grow further in
another 15 years. "Yet China will still be a developing country
with relatively low placing in areas like per capita GNP," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"We pose no threat to anyone anywhere but will only help to
strengthen the cause of world peace, stability and development,"
Qian said.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if China fails to achieve economic
development and her population of 1.2 billion are bogged down in
the mire of poverty, that would indeed be ominous for world
peace and stability.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Hegemony and power
politics will only come to grief in the context of a growing trend
towards multipolarity, Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister
Qian Qichen said here today.
</P>
<P>
Delivering his statement at the 51st session of the United
Nations General Assembly, Qian, who is chairman of the Chinese
delegation at the session, said peace should have prevailed in the
post-Cold War world, but the reality is that the world today is
far from being tranquil.
</P>
<P>
"The Cold War mentality still dies hard and hegemonism has
repeatedly raised its ugly head," he said. "Interference in other
countries' internal affairs under various pretexts and indulgence
in sanctions-wielding or even the use of force are trampling on
the purposes and principles of the U.N. Charter and all accepted
norms of international relations, thereby threatening and
undermining world peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
Qian said equal members of the international community should
respect each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity,
refrain from invading each other or interfering in each other's
internal affairs, and live in harmony with each other in the
spirit of seeking common ground while putting aside differences.
</P>
<P>
"Liquidation of the bipolar structure has rekindled a hope that
the world would be a community of countries with equal rights for
all, rather than one dominated by a single big power," he said.
</P>
<P>
Multipolarity is gaining momentum in a global as well as
regional context, Qian said. "Major powers are readjusting their
relationships," while the developing nations "have become
increasingly aware of the need to bolster their strength through
concerted efforts," he noted.
</P>
<P>
In the Asia-Pacific region, he said, the endeavors to maintain
peace and stability and promote common development through
dialogue, consultation and cooperation have yielded positive
results.
</P>
<P>
The past year has seen peace returning to a number of war-torn
countries and regions, such as the former Yugoslavia areas, Qian
said.
</P>
<P>
He said the strong impact on Africa produced by the drastic
changes in the post-Cold War international situation is almost
over and the continent is entering a new historical era for peace,
stability and development.
</P>
<P>
"But the path towards peace is tortuous," Qian said, citing the
Middle East peace process, which he said "has hit snags again."
</P>
<P>
China hopes, he said, "all the parties concerned will strive
for an early comprehensive and just settlement of this issue by
strictly observing the agreements already reached and resuming
negotiations and dialogue on the basis of the relevant resolutions
of the United Nations."

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China is fully capable
of ensuring a smooth transfer of government and transition in Hong
Kong, Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said
here today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the General Debate of the 51st General Assembly of
the U.N., Qian gave an account of China's overall policies
concerning the Hong Kong and Taiwan issues.
</P>
<P>
China will put into effect the policy of "one country, two
systems" right after it resumes the exercise of sovereignty over
Hong Kong on July 1, 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We have set a good example of countries peacefully resolving
issues left over by history," he said.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong will enjoy a high degree of autonomy, and the
existing social and economic system and way of life will remain
unchanged and the laws currently in force in Hong Kong will be
basically maintained, according to the Chinese vice premier.
</P>
<P>
He assured foreign investors of Hong Kong's position as a free
port and separate customs territory.
</P>
<P>
On the issue of Taiwan, Qian said that according to Resolution
2758 adopted by the U.N. General Assembly 25 years ago, the
People's Republic of China regained its lawful rights in the
United Nations. "The resolution has thoroughly settled the
question of China's representation in the United Nation in all
aspects," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that Taiwan is an inalienable part of the Chinese
territory. He listed "peaceful reunification and one country, two
systems" as China's "unswerving guideline" for settlement of the
Taiwan question.
</P>
<P>
The Taiwan issue is "purely China's internal affair which
brooks no outside interference," Qian said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people are determined to carry
through the struggle against all attempts to split their territory
or create an independent Taiwan, Qian said.

UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- German Foreign
Minister Klaus Kinkel today called on the international community
to convert the environmental awareness into environmental action.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the 51st session of the U.N.
General Assembly this morning, Kinkel said that North and South,
East and West, are struggling to survive together in the spaceship
Earth, whose blue protective shield is becoming increasingly
fragile.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it has been estimated that the world's population
will number about 10 billion in 2030. "For their sake, for the
sake of our children and grandchildren, we must take steps today
to ensure that the earth remains inhabitable," he said.
</P>
<P>
Peace and human dignity, economic progress and protection of
the natural foundations fo life are inseparable, he said. Without
social justice, without any vision for the world's economic
progress, he added, it is not possible to break the vicious circle
of poverty, environmental destruction and population explosion.
</P>
<P>
He noted that 1997 will be a crucial year for environmental
action. The special session of the General Assembly devoted to
environment and development must chart the course of the next
millennium in order to restore the balance between man, nature and
economy, he said.

<HEADLINE> French Government to Send 3.56 Billion Francs to Save Bank </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The French government will send
3.56 billion francs (712 million U.S. dollars) in a new aid
package to the bank of Credit Lyonnais (CL) which suffered
billions of francs of loss.
</P>
<P>
Local media quoted official sources as making the announcement
after the European Commission, the executive organ of the European
Union (EU), agreed today to a previous plan by the French
government of sending 3.9 billion francs (780 million
U.S. dollars) to CL in 1996.
</P>
<P>
The new aid package is aimed at helping the bank pay the debt
which resulted from a loan by the bank to a construction firm
which sold non-banking credits for CL.
</P>
<P>
France has asked EU to support this new saving plan, which is
aimed at relieving the bank from the debt within the first quarter
of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The EU commissioner in charge of competition Karel Van Miert
said today in Brussels that the EU will make a decision by the end
of the year to let CL decide on its quarterly policy of accounts
in March 1997.
</P>
<P>
The EU commission, which enjoys the power to decide whether to
let a national government to provide aid to its banks, had agreed
to a French government aid package to CL for 1995 which amounted
to 45 billion francs (9 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
In return, France agreed to restrict overseas business of CL
between 1995 and 1998, especially in Europe.

<HEADLINE> Canadian Women Do Two-Thirds of Housework </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
OTTAWA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Canadian women did two-thirds
of the nation's household chores in 1992, which would have cost
over 110 billion U.S. dollars if maids were hired to do it.
</P>
<P>
Women continue to do most of the 25 billion hours of unpaid
work even though men are getting better at taking on the
traditionally female tasks of meal preparation and clothing care,
said a recent report from Statistics Canada.
</P>
<P>
The report estimated 170 billion dollars worth of household
chores were performed in 1992, which included shopping, cleaning,
cooking, child care, painting, lawn mowing and volunteer work.
</P>
<P>
On average, women spent 1,482 hours per year on unpaid
household chores compared to 831 hours for men.
</P>
<P>
Cooking meals and cleaning dishes are the most onerous
household tasks, taking up one-quarter of all the time spent on
unpaid chores, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Working Canadian women are finding it increasingly difficult to
balance jobs and families.
</P>
<P>
In 1992, 58 percent of women were employed, double the number
of 30 years ago, and the number of employed women with children
under the age of three climbed to 61 percent from just 32 percent
in 1976.
</P>
<P>
"I can see the stress level in my own office," said an official
from the Canadian Research Institute for the Advancement of Women.
"Women are never really very far removed from household
responsibility, that's the difficulty."
</P>
<P>
"The society is slow to change, to accept that it's not just
women who are responsible for household chores," she added.

<HEADLINE> US Existing Home Sales Down 0.5 Percent in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Sales of existing homes in
the U.S. declined by 0.5 percent in August but remained strong,
according to a report from the U.S. National Association of
Realtors today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that sales of previously owned single-family
homes in the nation totaled 4.13 million on a seasonally adjusted
annual rate, down from 4.15 million in July.
</P>
<P>
The realtors association also revised down the July sales from
4.16 million rate which were initially announced last month.
</P>
<P>
But sales of existing homes have remained above the 4 million
mark since the rate reached 4.2 million in March. They were
stronger than last year when sales for all of 1995 totaled 3.8
million.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that high mortgage rates have resulted in the
slowed sales of existing homes in the U.S.
</P>
<P>
Thirty-year, fixed-rate mortgages averaged 7.95 percent in
August, down from 8.25 percent in July and 8.32 percent in June.
But it was much higher than the rate of 7.03 percent last January.
</P>
<P>
Regionally, sales jumped by 5.6 percent in the U.S. West and
rose by 0.9 percent in the Midwest. The sales plunged by 9.5
percent in the Northeast and declined by 1.9 percent in the South.

<HEADLINE> IMF: World Economic Conditions Generally Encouraging </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Monetary
Fund (IMF) predicted today that the global economic and financial
conditions remain generally encouraging despite of a disappointing
performance recently in Western Europe.
</P>
<P>
The IMF's latest World Economic Outlook (WEO), which was
released prior to the IMF-World Bank joint annual meeting, said
that the global economic expansion is expected to continue at 4.1
percent, a satisfactory pace in 1996-97 and over the medium term.
</P>
<P>
The 296-page report noted that the strength of economic
activity is particularly impressive in the emerging market
countries of the developing world, with an increasing number of
them reaping the benefits of structural reforms and strong
macro-economic fundamentals. In some Asian countries, concerns
about overheating have been alleviated to some extent by a
moderation of growth.
</P>
<P>
For the industrial countries, there has generally been
continuing success in the containment of inflation, but growth and
labor market performance have remained uneven. Some countries,
such as the United States, are experiencing robust growth of
output and employment. In Japan, supportive monetary and fiscal
policies and a correction of the earlier overvaluation of the yen
have finally put the economy on the path of recovery after a
protracted economic slowdown.
</P>
<P>
However, many industrial nations, some Western European
countries in particular, are yet to share fully in the current
expansion and continue to face the important policy challenges of
addressing the deep-seat structural and macro-economic weaknesses
in their economies. Some countries are also experiencing
difficulties in their banking systems with attendant downside
risks to confidence and economic activity, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
In the developing world, the role of market forces is generally
increasing, but high degrees of government intervention in the
economy and large claims on financial resources by the public
sector and quasi-public entities continue to hamper the
development of the private sector in many countries.
</P>
<P>
In the transition countries, where there have been considerable
improvements in inflation performance, there is still a need to
continue the reform process and to achieve and safeguard greater
macro-economic stability. In many countries, including some that
are relatively advanced in the transition process, fiscal deficits
remain excessive and contribute to continued price pressures.
</P>
<P>
The IMF published the WEO report annually from 1980 through
1983 and has published it biennially since 1984.

<HEADLINE> S. Leone's Strategic Highway Closed Amid Rebel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, September 25 (Xinhua) - A strategic highway which is
the outlet from Sierra Leone's capital Freetown remained closed
for nearly 10 days as rebels of the Revolutionary United Front
(RUF) stepped up their blockade.
</P>
<P>
Vehicles carrying vital supplies and commuter buses have been
pinned down at Masiaka, 47 miles from the city, as military
officials have declared it unsafe for any vehicle to proceed
beyond that point to the interior.
</P>
<P>
Reports from Sierra Leone's second largest city of Bo said
commuters and vehicles traveling to the capital are held up at
Matoi, some 91 miles to Freetown.
</P>
<P>
Government sources said a special task force was being set up
to provide escort to all vehicles plying the route. But so far it
is not yet known when the team will go into operation.
</P>
<P>
They said the rebels were commandeering trucks carrying relief
food items including rice, corn oil and flour and forcing
passengers in captured vehicles to carry the goods to their
bases.
</P>
<P>
Last weekend, a driver who ignored a rebel order to stop his
vehicle was killed and his petrol tanker was set ablaze.
</P>
<P>
In another development, the country's civilian defense unit
known as the Kamajos fought pitched battles with the government
troops in the eastern town of Kenema on Monday, leaving at least
10 soldiers and two Kamajos dead.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition MPs Against Ratification of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Ten MPs from Nepal's main
opposition the Communist Party of Nepal (United Marxist Leninist,
CPN-UML) today criticized the party's decision to vote for a
border river treaty with India in parliamentary.
</P>
<P>
The lawmakers, who abstained from the voting in a joint meeting
of both houses of parliament last Friday, said in a statement
today that the CPN-UML's support for the Mahakali treaty in its
present form is the result of the party leadership's failure to
function in an organized manner.
</P>
<P>
They urged the party to correct the mistake and develop itself
into a national force committed to safeguarding the national
interest.
</P>
<P>
The Nepali parliament last week ratified the Mahakali border
river integrated development treaty between Nepal and India with a
vote of 220 to 8. The treaty was signed seven months ago in New
Delhi.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML, the main opposition party, played a crucial role in
ratifying the treaty as it has 101 MPs in the 265-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
However, some 30 MPs from the party boycotted the voting
despite the party's decision to support the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The 10 CPN-UML MPs, including several party central members,
said in the statement that the present Mahakali treaty does not
secure Nepal's equal rights over the waters of the border river,
making it against the national interest of Nepal.
</P>
<P>
They said they were compelled to boycott the voting as it was
not corrected as demanded by the party earlier.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML party had demanded necessary corrections to the
treaty as  a precondition for the ratification. Its demands
included clarification of the status of the Mahakali river,
India's commitment to its proposed power purchase from Nepal and
Nepal's right claim to the river.
</P>
<P>
But the opposition decided to order its MPs to vote for the
treaty last Friday at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
The party's decision to support the treaty was made with a
wafer thin majority vote of 17 to 16 in the central committee.

<HEADLINE> WHO, UNICEF Call for More Funding for Vaccines, Immunization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) today called
on governments and donors to pay more on vaccine research and
global immunization campaigns to save millions of lives every year.
</P>
<P>
A new report on the state of the world's vaccines and
immunization produced jointly by the two U.N. agencies said that
over the next 15 years, revolutionary new vaccines generated by
secientific advances could save lives of some eight million
children who now die each year from infectious diseases.
</P>
<P>
However, they warned that the promise that science holds may be
squandered tragically by a funding crisis.
</P>
<P>
The new generation of vaccines are expected to be very much
more expensive than those in use today, the report said, noting
that research and development costs today for a single vaccine
can range from 50 million dollars to 200 million.
</P>
<P>
At current prices, immunizing a child with vaccines against the
six most common infectious diseases -- diphtheria, tetanus,
whooping cough, polio, measles, and tuberculosis -- costs no more
than about one U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
But vaccines are likely to cost not cents but dollars a dose
from now on, the report said.
</P>
<P>
"Greater advocacy is needed to ensure that vaccine research and
development is driven not only by commercial interests but by
public health goals as well," the report said, with manufacturers
seeing financial incentives.

<HEADLINE> Jordan's Crown Prince Voices Concern over </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's regent, Crown Prince
Hassan, said today that the Israeli excavation and reopening of a
tunnel along the Western Wall of the Al Aqsa Mosque in the Arab
east Jerusalem will change the features of the holy city and
undermine its religious and historical sites.
</P>
<P>
In a telephone call to Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu, Crown Prince Hassan stressed Jordan's principle stands
on the issue of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein of Jordan is now on a tour of Gulf states.
</P>
<P>
Following the telephone conversation, the crown prince said
that the Israeli authorities should not disregard Arab and Moslem
feelings because Jerusalem is the "gate for peace and the cause
of wars."
</P>
<P>
He said the Israeli prime minister had pledged to review the
issue.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli reopening of the tunnel has triggered great anger
from the Arab world and conflicts between Jews and Israeli Arabs
in the Jewish state which killed at least three Palestinians and
wounded another 200 Palestinian protesters today.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat had asked the Arab League
member countries to convene an extraordinary meeting on the issue
of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli premier reportedly would cut short his current
trip to Britain, France and Germany to solve the domestic issue.

<HEADLINE> EU to Crack Down on Drug Trafficking </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
justice ministers are due to hold an informal conference in Dublin
Thursday and Friday to discuss tougher laws against drug
trafficking in the bloc, according to reports from Dublin.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press briefing before the conference today, Irish
Justice Minister Nora Owen, whose country is the current EU
presidency state, said that the EU ministers will debate on how to
tackle the worsening issue of drug abuse and drug trafficking
across the 15-nation bloc.
</P>
<P>
"I am confident that as a result of some initiatives I have
taken as president of the council and from proposals being put
forward by other countries, we will make progress" in fighting
against drug trafficking, she said.
</P>
<P>
The Irish minister noted that Ireland already had tough
legislation in place and she urged his EU partners "to commit
themselves in their own countries to bring in such legislation, if
they have not already got it in place."
</P>
<P>
She said that other EU countries have asked for "a great deal
of discussion" of man-made drugs being manufactured in European
and neighboring countries.
</P>
<P>
"Fast and furious, we are now becoming producers of drugs
ourselves. Man-made drugs are becoming more and more of a problem
as they are seen as almost respectable, just like popping a
tablet," she added.
</P>
<P>
She stressed that the advancement of drug profiling can help
track down where a drug was made as the the-Hague based European
Drugs Unit has identified chemical imprints on drugs which can
reveal their origin.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Asks Mubarak to Help Defuse Crisis With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu today appealed to Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to
help defuse the violence in Palestinian territories, in which
three Palestinians, including two policemen, were shot dead today
by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak has agreed to go to Israel soon to mediate between
Israel and Palestinians, said Netanyahu.
</P>
<P>
"I have profited from the hospitality of Prime Minister Alain
Juppe by telephoning Mr. Mubarak and asked him to use his
influence to calm the atmosphere," said Netanyahu, who arrived
here today for a visit.
</P>
<P>
He said that he told Mubarak that peace and tranquility "are
in the common interests of Palestinians, of Israel and of the
whole world."
</P>
<P>
"One should return to the table of negotiations (with the
Palestinians), put an end to violence and talk," he said in
reference to the worsening crisis in the Palestinian territories
of West Bank and Gaza Strip, which was triggered by Israel's
decision to dig a tunnel near a Muslim holy site in east
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Netanyahu today, Prime Minister Juppe said
that there will be no future for both Israel and Palestinians in
confrontation and violence, no matter from which side they come
from.
</P>
<P>
Juppe also promised Netanyahu that France would provide advice
and assistance "in this painful problem." He reaffirmed France's
attachment to the Middle East peace process and its friendship
with Israel as well as with Arab countries.
</P>
<P>
About 150 Palestinians were also wounded in clashes with
Israeli soldiers on a road between Ramallah and Jerusalem today.

<HEADLINE> France, US Clash at NATO Meeting Over South Command </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- France and the United States
today clashed at a meeting of NATO defense ministers over who
should head the Naples-based South Command of the western military
alliance.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, France Defense Minister Charles Millon warned that
France would stop returning to the integrated military structure
of NATO if the South Command continued to be in the hands of
Americans.
</P>
<P>
"If a certain number of the conditions are not met, France will
not stay in the position where it is," reports quoted Millon as
saying at an informal meeting of NATO defense ministers held today
in Bergen, Norway.
</P>
<P>
France, which withdrew from the integrated military structure
of NATO in 1966, decided in December 1995 to send its defense
minister and chief of staff of the armed forces to the meetings of
their NATO counterparts to start a rapprochement with the
Trans-Atlantic alliance.
</P>
<P>
The French request for Europeanization of the South Command was
strongly opposed by the U.S. delegation headed by Defense
Secretary William Perry, who considered France's stand as "hard"
and "intransigent," Agence France Presse quoted a U.S. official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
Millon said that the decision to make the request was
specifically made by President Jacques Chirac himself, who has
made the Europeanization of the South Command of NATO as a
precondition for France's full return to NATO.
</P>
<P>
The United States has been heading the South Command while
holding two other supreme strategic commanding seats of NATO, and
Washington refuses to give up its position in the South Command
for its geographical importance and holding a U.S. competence zone
in southern Europe.
</P>
<P>
Apart from France, Germany, Spain and Italy also prefer the
South Command to be headed by a European.
</P>
<P>
"We want a renovation of the alliance through taking into
account of a European identity of defense.... This ia a point of
view shared (by other European countries). The problem is not one
between France and the United States but of taking into account
the European identity within NATO," said Millon.
</P>
<P>
NATO Secretary General Javier Solana said that NATO would try
to find a solution to the problem.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Warplanes Attack South Lebanon </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli warplanes attacked
this afternoon the suburbs of al-Loza town in Iglim al-Toffah in
south Lebanon, the Lebanese National Information Agency (LNIA)
reported.
</P>
<P>
The warplanes launched 4 air-to-ground missiles, the sound of
which was clearly heard in the city of Nabatiya, which is further
south of Iglim al-Toffah, but the reports gave no details about
the casualties or damages of the raid.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli military aircraft violated the airspace of
the Lebanese capital of Beirut at the small hours today, while
other airplanes flew at a low altitude over the villages at
Nabatiya and Iglim al-Toffah, LNIA said.
</P>
<P>
On its part, the Lebanese Islamic Resistance said in a
statement released today that it had monitored at noon today the
concentration of Israeli forces in the vicinity of Iglim
al-Toffah area, and that Resistance units had launched direct
attacks at them.
</P>
<P>
On the other hand, a statement issued by the pro-Syrian
faction Amal Movement today said that Israeli troops pulled away
the corpse of a Resistance militant who died during Tuesday's
confrontations near the Israeli position of al Suwaidaa. It added
that another militant was still missing.
</P>
<P>
Military confrontations occurred Tuesday between Lebanese
fundamentalist guerrilla Hezbollah, or Party of God, and Israeli
troops around Iglim al-Toffah, causing the death and injury of a
number of militiamen of the Israeli allied South Lebanon Army.
</P>
<P>
Iglim al-Toffah, a ridge opposite the Israeli self-styled
"security zone," is often used by Lebanese guerrillas as a
springboard for launching attacks at Israeli occupation forces in
south Lebanon.

<HEADLINE> Sudanese Official: Sudan to Continue Its Current </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KHARTOUM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Sudan will continue to
implement its current foreign policy of good neighborliness,
respect of others and non-interference in the internal affairs of
other states in the future, a high-ranking Sudanese official said
today.
</P>
<P>
While addressing the National Assembly, Mustafa Osman Ismail,
Sudan's Minister of State at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs,
spelled out the necessity of doubling efforts to do away with the
deformed image of Sudan, calling for Arab solidarity in
confronting the dangers facing the Arab nations.
</P>
<P>
The Sudanese minister pointed out that Sudanese-Saudi
relations have undergone noted improvement, and the relations
between Sudan and each of the Sultanate of Oman, Qatar and the
United Arab Emirates were moving forward.
</P>
<P>
With regard to Sudan's relations with African countries, the
Sudanese official said that his country was seeking to develop
ties with neighboring countries, and that contacts were under way
with Eritrea and Ethiopia for resolving differences.

He asserted that Sudan was committed to Iranian-mediated
agreement with Uganda, adding that efforts were being exerted to
contain the Sudanese-Ugandan differences through the joint
tripartite committee.

<HEADLINE> White House Calls FBI Files Issue "Blunder" </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The gathering of FBI files
by the White House on former Reagan and Bush administration
officials were a "bureaucratic blunder," a government official
said today
</P>
<P>
White House counsel Mark Fabiani made public a package of
documents citing the Secret Service lists that included the names
of former Reagan and Bush staffers for whom FBI background check
files were obtained. Among those listed were prominent officials
of the previous administrations.
</P>
<P>
The Secret Service lists, under the title "Update Project," had
been turned over to the independent counsel's office and were
returned to the White House Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"The Secret Service lists support what the White House has said
all along about the FBI files matter," said Fabiani. "The files
were mistakenly sought as the result of a bureaucratic blunder."
</P>
<P>
But hearings were scheduled today by Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-
Utah, of the Senate Judiciary Committee to further probe how the
FBI files on former officials turned up in the White House and who
requested them. Former personnel security director Craig
Livingstone has been called as a witness.
</P>
<P>
Republicans have charged that the lists were compiled as an
"enemies list."
</P>
<P>
Fabiani said that according to sworn testimony, the original
Secret Service list used to see the "A through G" background files
were discarded once the lists's mistakes were discovered.
</P>
<P>
He said the Secret Service list generated on June 10, 1993 runs
from names from Po-to-Zy and is titled "Exclusive Employer
Directory for White House Operations Personnel."
</P>
<P>
But Fabiani said, the White House stopped soliciting the FBI
files for "Update Project" at "Go."
</P>
<P>
"In short," he said, "these newly revealed Secret Service lists
undermine the charges made by our political opponents and support
what the White House has said all along about the FBI files."
</P>
<P>
In effect, the White House blamed the Secret Service for
providing an old list of people who formerly held permanent passes
to the White House.
</P>
<P>
Late Tuesday, the House Reform and Oversight Committee released
and approved a report on the FBI files controversy, which stemmed
from its probe of the White House travel office firings.
</P>
<P>
The committee's chairman, Rep. Bill Clinger, a Republican of
Pennsylvania, issued the call for FBI general counsel Howard
Shapiro to resign because of allegations that he compromised his
position and the FBI's independence from the White House.

<HEADLINE> French FM Calls for Fight Against Terrorism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign
Minister Herve De Charette today made a solemn appeal to the
entire international community to join the fight against
terrorism, crime and drugs.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the 51st session of the U.N.
General Assembly, he said the world is confronted today with these
terrible problems which know no borders and spare no population.
</P>
<P>
"The fight against these scourges is foremost in our concerns
and high on the international agenda," he said.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the 25 recommendations adopted at the conference
by the Group of Seven countries and Russia, he said that they are
destined to be implemented by each state internally and to
strengthen international cooperation against terrorism.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the international community to react without
weakness to the challenge of organized crime, which knows how to
make the fullest use of the possibilities that have been opened up
by the liberalization of trade.
</P>
<P>
On money laundering, he said that all states should pay
particular attention to this phenomenon which is one of the
hardest forms of organized crime to counter.
</P>
<P>
"One of the most loathsome aspects of organized crime is that
it targets our children," he said.
</P>
<P>
On combating the sexual exploitation of children, he stressed,
"Everyone must now make a commitment to implement effective
measures for immediate application."
</P>

for them.

<HEADLINE> French-German Brigade to Be Deployed in Bosnia in 1997 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A 5,200-man French-German
brigade will be deployed in Bosnia in early 1997 as part of the
future Western force to succeed NATO's peace Implementation Force
(IFOR), French Defense Ministry sources said today.
</P>
<P>
If the decision is officially announced, this will be the first
time for the world's only bi-national brigade to carry out
military operations abroad.
</P>
<P>
Germany will send its troops into Bosnia after having sent a
4,000-man peacekeeping force -- most of them military medical
personnel -- to Croatia to work as part of the 52,000-man IFOR.
German combat aircraft have also participated in the IFOR patrol
over Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
The 16 NATO defense ministers' meeting in Bergen, Norway, has
decided to maintain the military presence of the Western military
alliance in Bosnia in the post-IFOR era of the former Yugoslav
republic.
</P>
<P>
The Mulhein-based French-German brigade was set up in 1989 by
former French President Francois Mitterrand and German Chancellor
Helmut Kohl as a "laboratory"in search of new ways of European
defense under the hypothesis of an American disengagement from
Europe.
</P>
<P>
The French and German soldiers of the brigade, composed of four
regiments, wear their own uniforms and bear their own weapons, and
are specially trained for peacekeeping missions.
</P>
<P>
The German constitution banned Germany from sending German
soldiers abroad until July 1994, after the country's
constitutional court made a widened interpretation of the
constitutional texts.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Aircraft Missile Kills Two in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A large explosion killed
two people at a former military camp in Daynile District of south
Mogadishu last night.
</P>
<P>
The explosion was resulted from the improper use by the
deceased of a Sam-2 missile which detonated the missile.
</P>
<P>
Mohamed Hassan Ali who was among the survivors said that they
have been working on those missiles for some time. They collected
the explosive powder from the missiles and sold them in Bakara
market in kilograms as their only means to survive.
</P>
<P>
Colonel Abdullahi Omar from the former military camp said
there are altogether 21 missiles which had been made by the
former Soviet Union consisted of sam-2 and sam-3 guided from the
ground.
</P>
<P>
Unfortbately, the missiles guidance system together with
radars were destroyed by the civil war, said Omar.
</P>
<P>
Quite a number of internally displaced refugees have found
their houses inside those former military camps. Rahma Osman
Ahmed, 40, said she couldn't find a better place to live in. She
has six children and does her heaviest duty in prevening her
children from going too close to these missiles. ''The missiles
sometimes cast smoke without anyone touching them,'' she said,
''They frighten us to death, but we can't help,'' she added.
</P>
<P>
Despite the continuous hazards by the land mines in the
country in general, these missiles are currently posing a threat
to about six hundred families living in more than nine former
military camps in Mogadishu.

<HEADLINE> 7 Workers Injured When Pipe Bursts at Nuclear Plant </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- A reactor at the Oconee
Nuclear Station in South Carolina was being restarted after
routine maintenance when an 18-inch pipe burst, scalding seven
workers with steam, with four hospitalized today in critical
condition.
</P>
<P>
No radiation leaked and Reactor Unit 2 remained shut down this
morning. Two other nuclear reactors were still operating,
according to an Associated Press report.
</P>
<P>
The accident Tuesday afternoon occurred on the side of the
plant where there are turbines and steam generators that make
electricity. It is separate from the area where water is used to
help cool the nuclear reactor.
</P>
<P>
Unit 2 was operating at 55 percent capacity when a line split
as technicians adjusted valves in the basement, according to
Charlotte, N.C.-based Duke Power Co., which runs the plant.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the four workers in critical condition, the
three others were listed in stable condition at hospitals this
morning.
</P>
<P>
The accident, which was not classified an emergency by the

<HEADLINE> King Hussein Calls for Arab Solidarity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Jordanian King Hussein
today called for the promotion of Arab solidarity and the
unification of Arab ranks in the face of challenges, so that the
Arabs may achieve their rights and have an impact in the
international arena.
</P>
<P>
In a Bahraini television interview in Manama today, King
Hussein said that he had briefed the Emir of Bahrain Sheikh Isa
bin Salman al-Khalifa about the latest developments in the
Mideast peace process, pointing out that the absence of Arab
dialogue was having negative consequences on the process.
</P>
<P>
He said that his visit to Bahrain will have strong effect in
enhancing fraternal relations and cooperation in the various
fields between Jordan and Bahrain. He added that his talks with
the Emir of Bahrain covered a review of bilateral, Arab and
international issues.
</P>
<P>
The king reiterated Jordan's support of the Bahraini measures
to safeguard its security.
</P>
<P>
On his recent visit to Saudi Arabia and his meeting with Saudi
King Fahd, the Jordanian monarch described his talks there as
candid and successful, and that the atmosphere of the talks was
characterized by fraternal sentiments.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein condemned the measures taken by Israel in the
vicinity of the Al Aqsa Mosque Tuesday. These measures, he said,
jeopardize the rights of all Arabs and Moslems in the holy city.
</P>
<P>
He called for the formation of an international committee to
examine the possible consequences of such Israeli acts on the
holy places.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed a tunnel Tuesday along Jerusalem's Al Aqsa
Mosque compound, the third holiest site of Islam. The
Palestinians claim the tunnel undermines their rights to the
Moslem shrines.
</P>
<P>
King Hussein left Manama this afternoon following his
television interview, proceeding to the Qatari capital of Doha
within the framework of his Gulf tour.

<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- French Foreign
Minister Herve de Charette today urged the wealthiest states to
assist the developing countries actively and effectively.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the general debate of the 51st session of the U.N.
General Assembly, he said that poverty and exclusion cannot
constitute the sole prospects for two-thirds of mankind on the
threshold of a new century.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the globalization of the economy and the
liberation of trade and investments open up unprecedented
prospects.
</P>
<P>
However, the gap should not be widened between the nations
which trade, invest and derive profit from this new factor, and
those which remain on the sidelines of this new prosperity.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the commitment on Africa where real prospects for
progress are beginning to emerge.
</P>
<P>
Africa has embarked with courage and perseverance on the path
to readjustment and recovery, and for the first time in a long
period, Africa's growth rate has been on the order of 5 percent in
these past two years, higher than its demographic expansion, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Still, official development assistance must be maintained and
strengthened, he said.
</P>
<P>
France reaffirmed the need to increase aid to the poorest
countries, asking for more generous treatment of debt for them,
and for new global partnership to be defined between the
developing countries and the multilateral institutions, he said.

<HEADLINE> IFC Offers Record Financing to Back Private Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The International Finance
Corporation (IFC) today announced it has approved a record 3.2
billion U.S. dollars in financing for 264 projects in 1996 fiscal
year, up from 2.9 billion dollars in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The results represent the fifth consecutive year of
double-digit annual increases in the amount of financing approved
by the IFC, a lending arm of the World Bank Group for the private
sector of developing countries.
</P>
<P>
According to the IFC's annual report for 1996 fiscal year,
ending June 30, the IFC's syndications with financial institutions
reached a record total of 4.8 billion dollars, an 88 percent
increase over the previous year. The gross increase which includes
loans, equity and syndications, over 1995 fiscal year was 47
percent.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting the strong catalytic role played by the IFC's
own financing, the total cost of the projects approved in 1996
fiscal year came to some 19.6 billion dollars. It means that for
every dollar in direct IFC financing, other investment partners
contributed more than five.
</P>
<P>
The IFC approved projects in 68 countries in the year. The
number of projects in each region increased, particularly in
Sub-Saharan Africa which has 71 projects -- the largest number
ever for any region. The volume of investments also expanded in
Asia, Central Asia, the Middle East and North Africa as well as
Latin America and the Caribbean.
</P>
<P>
Of major investment sectors, agribusiness and food processing
investments continued to increased strongly in the year, with the
IFC approving over 379 million dollars for its own account in 51
projects.
</P>
<P>
The IFC's volume of loan syndications grew substantially in
1996 fiscal year -- to some 4.8 billion dollars, sharply
surpassing the previous year's record of 2.6 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
The IFC syndicated almost twice as much in loans from financial
institutions as it provided directly for its own account.
</P>
<P>
Syndicated loan signings also increased to 2.5 billion dollars,
as compared with 1.6 billion dollars in the previous year --
involving 127 participating banks and institutional investors from
30 countries. There were 396 individual loan participations. The
IFC's loan portfolio for the account of its participants exceeded
6.1 billion dollars on June 30 this year.
</P>
<P>
The IFC, which was set up in 1956, made its first investments
in a number of new member countries such as in Albania, Angola,
Croatia, Maldives, the Slovak Republic, Vanuatu and Western Samoa.
Azerbaijan, Bahrain, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Eritrea and St. Kitts
and Nevis joined the IFC this year, bringing its total membership
to 170.

<HEADLINE> Three Palestinians Killed, Some 200 Wounded in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Israeli security forces
today killed at least three Palestinians and wounded about 200
others in the West Bank town of Ramallah, in the worst bloodshed
in two years.
</P>
<P>
Israeli soldiers exchanged fires with Palestinians, some in
uniforms, who held protests over opening a controversial
underground tunnel in east Jerusalem Tuesday, Israel Radio
reported.
</P>
<P>
Hundreds of young Palestinian protesters also rained the
Israeli police stations with stones and bottles. Other reports
said Israeli soldiers also fired rubber bullets and tear gas to
disperse the protesters.
</P>
<P>
Israel Television reported that some Israeli soldiers were
wounded in the clashes, most by the stones thrown by the
Palestinian protesters.
</P>
<P>
In east Jerusalem, Israeli police dispersed two smaller-scale
Palestinian demonstrations, but no violent clashes occurred. The
Temple Mount, at the center of the current dispute, was closed by
Israeli authorities to prevent potential violence.
</P>
<P>
This was the worst clash since Israel and Palestinians made
peace in 1993, revoking the memory of the 1987-1993 "intifada," or
uprising, which featured similar bloody clashes between
stone-throwing Palestinian youths and armed Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Acting Prime Minister and Tourism Minister Moshe Katzav
telephoned Prime Minister Nejamin Netanyahu, who is currently in
Paris on a three-nation European tour, to inform him of the
ongoing crisis. Netanyahu reportedly charged the Palestinians
with "totally unfounded" "over-reaction."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Katzav chaired an inner cabinet meeting to
discuss the worsening situation in east Jerusalem and the
territories.
</P>
<P>
He said that he and Public Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani
have made contacts with Palestinian Authority (PA) President
Yasser Arafat to try to calm the tension.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, apparently angered by Israel's actions in east
Jerusalem, called Tuesday Palestinians to stage a general strike
today and hold massive demonstrations to protest Israeli
policies.
</P>
<P>
Arafat termed the opening of the tunnel as a big crime
against Moslem religion and holy places and violation of signed
peace accords.
</P>
<P>
The latest bloody confrontation was provoked by Israel's
opening Monday night of a underground tunnel near the Temple
Mount, where the Moslem holy places of the Dome of Rock and
Al-Aksa Mosques are situated.
</P>
<P>
Israel insisted that the opening of the tunnel, discovered in
1867 but excavated four years later, was only for archeological
and tourism reasons and not politically motivated. However, the
Palestinians denounced it as a plot by the Israelis to undermine
the foundations of the Moslem holy places.
</P>
<P>
The worst bloodshed in two years is apparently severe setback
to the already rocky relations between Israel and Palestinians
after Israel's hardline Likud government came to power in June.
</P>
<P>
In late August, Palestinians held a four-hour general strike
and a protest prayer to protest Israel's expansion of Jewish
settlements and destruction of Palestinian buildings in
Jerusalem, creating the first crisis in Israeli-Palestinian
relations in two years.
</P>
<P>
The crisis was only defused after Netanyahu held first
meeting with Arafat days later and promised to push forward the
peace process on signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
The status of Jerusalem has been one of the thorny problems in
the Israeli-Palestinian disputes. The Israeli Likud government
has ruled out any compromise on its sovereignty over the
self-claimed capital, while the Palestinians demanded it be the
capital of a future independent Palestinian state.
</P>
<P>
Under the Oslo agreements signed by Israelis former Labor
government and the Palestinians, the issue of Jerusalem should be
 settled through the final-status talks which are expected to
end by May 1999. However, the talks, firstly started in last
May, have been suspended indefinitely due to the early Israeli
elections in late May.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Official Condemns Israel's Opening of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- An Arab League official
strongly condemned here today Israel's opening of a tunnel in
Arab east Jerusalem, saying that the action was more serious than
Israeli confiscation of Palestinian lands.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Assistant Secretary General for Palestinian
Affairs Said Kamal said that the previous Israeli government led
by the Labor Party leader Shimon Peres had confiscated some 73
hectares of Palestinian lands, but the opening of the tunnel near
the Al Aqsa Mosque was a more serious move against the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
An emergency meeting of the league to be held Thursday comes
within the context of Arab coordination and efforts to stand up
to such practices adopted by the Israeli right-wing government
under Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Kamal said.
</P>
<P>
In statements carried by Egypt's Middle East News Agency
(MENA) today, Kamal said that the meeting is a part of an Arab
move reflecting Arab solidarity with the Palestinians and Arab
residents of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
He said that Israel's aim of digging the tunnel is to destroy
the Al Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest shrine of Islam, after
Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
"By this tunnel, the Israeli authorities could greatly control
east Jerusalem and create a new fait accompli," he was quoted as
saying.
</P>
<P>
He stressed the need of convening a meeting of the United
Nations Security Council to discuss the serious situation in
Jerusalem in the wake of the completion of the tunnel Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
The league's emergency meeting, to be held at the request of
Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat, will be attended by permanent
representatives to the 22-member league.
</P>
<P>
The Cairo-based league said in a statement Tuesday that the
opening of the tunnel was part of Israel's attempt to Judaize
Arab east Jerusalem and destroy its Arab and Islamic features.
</P>
<P>
But Israel says that opening the tunnel will give tourists
easier access to archeological sites beneath the "Wailing Wall,"
Judaism's holiest site.
</P>
<P>
The minister of Islamic Waqf in the Palestinian Authority,
Hasan Tahboub, told Egypt's Sawt Al Arab (Voice of Arabs) Radio
today that the Palestinians would work to close the tunnel.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Disturbed by Spy Office Working for South Korea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- U.S. leaders were said to
be disturbed on Wednesday by the discovery of a U.S. Navy officer
supplying secrets to South Korea.
</P>
<P>
According to the FBI, Robert Kim, a computer specialist with
access to top secret of U.S. naval intelligence was arrested at a
diplomatic reception at Fort Myer, Virginia, on Tuesday on charges
of spying for South Korea.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that
President Bill Clinton, who was on a campaign trip to
Pennsylvania, was disturbed by the incident but said it was
unlikely to affect U.S.-South Korea ties.
</P>
<P>
"Relations between the United States and the Repubic of Korea
are strong and of the nature that they can endure any alleged
wrongdoing by an individual," McCurry said.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher was also disturbed by the
arrest of the spy for South Korea and said Washington had been in
touch with South Korean officials over the case.
</P>
<P>
"I've been very disturbed by the reports that I have received
of that arrest and the incident itself," Christopher told
reporters in New York before his talks with the Mexican foreign
minister.
</P>
<P>
"We've been in touch with the South Korean officials about it.
Because this is a matter that's an ongoing criminal investigation,
you'll understand why my comments will be very limited," he said.
</P>
<P>
Christopher met with South Korean Foreign Minister Gong Ro-mung
on Tuesday afternoon but he did not raise the matter during their
talks, State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said.
</P>
<P>
Robert Kim, 56, was born in South Korea and became a U.S.
citizen in 1974. He has been in the U.S. government for 19 year,
working at the U.S. Navy intelligence offices in Suitland,
Maryland.
</P>
<P>
According to a FBI spokeswoman, Kim was not an intelligence
officer but had access through his computer to top secret
information.
</P>
<P>
Justice Department officials said the arrest came after "a
number of months of investigation", with found that he had passed
classified information to a South Korean agent, a Korean naval
attache identified as Dong-Il Baek. Baek's office was said to have
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
FBI agents searched Kim's house, car and office at about the
same time as his arrest.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Central Committee of
the "Fatah" Movement, the mainstream of the Palestine Liberation
Organization (PLO), has strongly denounced Israel's move to
complete an underground tunnel in east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here today, the Fatah central
committee called upon Arab and Islamic masses to voice their
indignation, anger, denunciation and rejection of the Israeli
measures to Judaize the various Jerusalem sites, particularly the
Al Aqsa Mosque.
</P>
<P>
Israel completed a 500-meter tunnel Tuesday along Jerusalem's
Al Aqsa Mosque compound, the third holiest site of Islam after
Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia, thus causing indignation among
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
The central committee appealed to Arab national force to
undertake the most extensive and effective action to expose and
confront this Israeli policy.
</P>
<P>
It also called for support for the Palestinian national force
and masses in their relentless struggle against Israel until the
Palestinian people achieve their cherished objectives of
liberation and return to their homeland.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the statement said that Israel was maintaining its
challenge to Arab and Moslem sentiments by its steady
provocations and implementation of a policy of Judaization.
</P>
<P>
Israel has repeatedly claimed Jerusalem as the sole capital of
the Jewish state while the Palestinians want the city to be the
capital of a future independent Palestinian state.

<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni
Mubarak received this evening a phone call from Israeli Prime
Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is currently on a visit to
Paris, France.
</P>
<P>
Over the telephone, the two leaders discussed the
Palestinian-Israeli track of the Middle East peace process and
the escalation of tension in Jerusalem and the West Bank town of
Ramallah in the wake of Israel's opening of a tunnel in
Jerusalem, Egyptian Information Minister Safwat el-Sherif said.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak stressed the exigency of implementing the signed
agreements between Israel and the Palestinians by starting with
the redeployment of the Israeli troops in the West Bank town of
Hebron, el-Sherif told reporters.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu promised Mubarak that he would give careful
consideration to the issue, noting that the joint
Palestinian-Israeli coordination committee would convene within
the coming few days to agree on ways to implement the agreements.
</P>
<P>
In Paris, the Israeli prime minister also briefed reporters
on his phone call to Mubarak.
</P>
<P>
"Mubarak suggested that we meet soon and have further
discussions and I thought that was a very good idea, and we'd
coordinate that after my return to Israel," he said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, President Mubarak also received a number of phone
calls from Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat, who briefed his
Egyptian counterpart on the situation in the Palestinian
territory following the opening of the tunnel.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel, which was opened late Monday secretly, runs
alongside the Al Aqsa Mosque compound, the third holiest site of
Islam, after Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia, thus causing great
anger among the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> Russian Surgeon Optimistic about Yeltsin's Operation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Russian surgeon Renat Akchurin
said today that chances for successful operation on Russian
President Boris Yeltsin will boost up to almost 100 percent after
a preparation period that will last at least six weeks.
</P>
<P>
Akchurin, who attended today's consultation meeting on whether
Yeltsin needs a heart surgery, is due to head a team of doctors
who will operate on the Russian President.
</P>
<P>
According to Akchurin, medical tests showed that if operated
today, Yeltsin has chances of about 80 percent. These words mean
that the operation, originally planned for late September, will be
postponed.
</P>
<P>
The doctor said that Yeltsin's attitude to the prognosis was
"courageous and calm," and that Yeltsin expressed his readiness to
follow doctors' advice in full.
</P>
<P>
According to U.S. top specialist Michael DeBakey, there are no
grounds to doubt that Yeltsin will be able "to return to normal
work" after the forthcoming operation.
</P>
<P>
DeBakey, who together with Akchurin attended the key medical
consultation today, confirmed that the operation is needed and
will be performed, and that he is optimistic about its results. In
his words, the post-operation rehabilitation period will take from
six to ten weeks.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the delay in operation has been prompted by
only the necessity to prepare Yeltsin's heart to it. The
preparatory period of six to 10 weeks will be needed to minimize
the risk of the operation, and Yeltsin will spend this period in a
clinic under the supervision of doctors, he added.
</P>
<P>
Sergei Mironov, head of the Presidential Medical Center
specified that the delay in Yeltsin's operation will be from six
to ten weeks.
</P>
<P>
He said that during the prepartion period Yeltsin will proceed
with "work on documents, information exchange and necessary
working meetings." However, he went on to say, all this time the
President will spend either in hospital or sanatorium conditions
"under a strict medical monitoring."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Anti-Israel Wave Surges throughout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 25 (Xinhua) -- In response to the call
by Palestinian Authority (PA) President Yasser Arafat,
Palestinians today launched a fierce anti-occupation protest
throughout the Palestinian territories in the most violent way
since Israel's rightwing Likud government took power in June.
</P>
<P>
Three Palestinians were killed by Israeli soldiers and nearly
200 others wounded today in the clashes between Palestinians and
Israelis, which were triggered by the Israeli opening of a tunnel
along the Al Aqsa Mosque, the third holiest site of Islam, in
Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
In east Jerusalem, the Palestinians went on a general strike
and a demonstration was held in the Sultan Suleiman Street. A
march was staged from the Al Aqsa Mosque to Damascus Gate of the
Old City after mid-day prayers.
</P>
<P>
The procession was attended and led by Waqf officials,
Palestinian Council members and PA ministers as well as prominent
figures in the city to protest against the opening of the tunnel
under the compound of the Al Aqsa Mosque.
</P>
<P>
Israeli mounted police and border guards attacked the
demonstrators. Armed policemen used clubs beating PA Minister of
Finance Mohammed Zuhdi Nashashibi. PA Minister of Religious
Affairs Sheikh Hassan Tahboub was run over by a horse mounted by
a policeman. He and other eight Palestinians were admitted to
the Maqassed Hospital for medical treatment. Palestinian Council
member Ziad Abu Aiad was also beaten near Al-Majless Gate in the
Old City as he attempted to enter the Al Aqsa Mosque.
</P>
<P>
In Beit Haninah area, high school students threw stones at
Israeli vehicles. Stone-throwing incidents also took place in
Al-Ram and Shu'fat Refugee Camp.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Council member Hatem Abdel Qader urged residents
of the city to go to Maqassed and Ramallah hospitals to donate
blood for the large number of the injured "compatriots" in
Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
Faisal Husseini, member of the PLO Executive Committee, cut
short his visit to Germany and returned to Jerusalem. He visited
Minister of Religious Affairs Sheikh Hassan Tahboub in the
Maqassed Hospital. Late afternoon he held a meeting with foreign
consuls in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Ramallah witnessed the bloody clashes between students of Bir
Zeit University and Israeli soldiers near Al-Bireh
checkpoint. The soldiers opened fire with live ammunition and
rubber bullets at the Palestinian protesters, killing three and
wounding nearly 200.
</P>
<P>
In flagrant violation of the Oslo agreement, the soldiers
reportedly intruded into the autonomous area. Exchange of fire
was also reported between Palestinian police and Israeli
soldiers. Israel also sent helicopters to quell the violent
demonstrators in addition to tear-gas canisters and sound bombs.
</P>
<P>
The spokesperson of the Palestinian Council media office
announced that the 88-member chamber will hold an emergency
session Thursday to discuss the escalation of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
In Hebron, students demonstrated from the city municipality to
Bab Al-Zawieh area of the Old City where they threw stones at
Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
In another incident, three cocktail bombs were tossed at Beit
Haddassah Synagogue in the Old City. Israeli soldiers raided the
area and arrested 20 Palestinian residents.
</P>
<P>
In Bethlehem, which lies south of Jerusalem, students from
Bethlehem University and other schools demonstrated near the
Israeli checkpoint adjacent to Rashel Tomb, throwing stones at
the soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to reporters, Palestinian Council member Salah
T'amari said that "the apartheid practices of Israel will not
pass without a reaction."
</P>
<P>
Before noon, clashes erupted near the checkpoint between the
residents of Dheisheh Refugee Camp and Israeli soldiers who
intended to enter the camp.
</P>
<P>
In Qalqilya, local residents took to the street expressing
their rejection of Israeli practices particularly in
Jerusalem. The demonstrators marched in the city center. The city
mayor told the crowd that the opening of the tunnel by the side
of Mount Temple was "a big blow to the peace process."
</P>
<P>
In the Gaza Strip, demonstrations and rallies were held in
many places. Demonstrators marched to the building of the
Palestinian Council, chanting anti-Israeli slogans. PA Minister
of Justice Freih Abu Medein told the protesters that the opening
of the tunnel constituted a very dangerous act against the
Palestinians. Secretary of the Palestinian Council Rawhi Fatouh
said that the confrontation will escalate.

LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The British Telecommunications
(BT) and News International plan to launch an internet service,
with its content ranging from news report to information about
television programs.
</P>
<P>
A joint venture company, Springboard, has been set up to create

<HEADLINE> "People's Daily" Editorial on Poverty Eradication (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The "People's Daily" will
issue an editorial Friday saying that China's poverty-relief work
has entered the critical stage of breaking down obstacles that
hinder success.
</P>
<P>
The editorial, titled "Making Great Efforts in Launching
Assault on Heavily Fortified Positions in the Poverty-Alleviation
Campaign," says that the key speeches made by the CPC General
Secretary Jiang Zemin and Premier Li Peng during the just-closed
central poverty-relief conference held by the Communist Party of
China (CPC) Central Committee and the State Council will serve to
mobilize work in this field.
</P>
<P>
The speeches, which have further clarified the policies and
requirements for future poverty-relief work, are of great
strategic significance, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
This year is the "International Year for the Eradication of
Poverty" set by the United Nations, and China, as the world's
largest developing country, will make its due contributions in
response to the worldwide call by the UN.
</P>
<P>
Poverty has become serious worldwide, as the planet's poor
population has increased from one billion to 1.3 billion in the
past five years, and in developing countries, nearly one third of
the population are destitute, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China has made enormous achievements in poverty
alleviation since it adopted reform and open policies 18 years
ago. During that period, the country decreased its poor population
by nearly three fourths, and as a result, the proportion of
China's poor population to the world's total poor population has
gone down from 25 percent in the late 1970s to the current five
percent, according to the paper.

<HEADLINE> Orders for Durable Goods in US Down in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Orders to U.S. factories
for durable goods plunged by a sharp 3.1 percent in August, the
Commerce Department reported today.
</P>
<P>
It was the steepest decline since the orders were down by 3.4
percent in April 1995.
</P>
<P>
The department said orders totaled a seasonally adjusted 167
billion dollars in the month, down from 172.4 billion in July.
</P>
<P>
It was also the third decline in the last five months and many
analysts had expected that orders for durable goods would drop
only by a slight 0.1 percent in August.
</P>
<P>
The report also showed that orders in July were not as strong
as first thought. The increase of orders was revised down to 1.4
percent from the earlier estimate of 1.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Durable goods include items such as cars and computers expected
to last more than three years and orders are considered a key
gauge of the U.S. manufacturing sector.
</P>
<P>
Orders for every major category showed the decline with the
transportation orders dropping by 7.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
Orders for electronic and other electrical equipment fell by a
big 5.6 percent, the first decline since May. Communications
equipment had the largest decrease.
</P>
<P>
Those for primary metals were down 2.7 by percent and demand
for industrial machinery and equipment slipped by 0.7 percent.
</P>
<P>
Orders for nonmilitary capital goods excluding aircraft fell 5
percent, erasing a 3.9 percent gain in July.
</P>
<P>
These orders often are a barometer of business plans to expand
and modernize and have been a major source of economic strength
during the current expansion.
</P>
<P>
Unfilled orders slipped 0.3 percent after rising 1.4 percent a
month earlier. Shipments, a measure of current activity, slowed to
a 0.3 percent advance after rising 0.5 percent in July.
</P>
<P>
The report was further evidence the economy may be moderating
without any increase in interest rates.

<HEADLINE> "People's Daily" Editorial on Poverty Eradication (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The ultimate goal of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics is to eradicate poverty and realize common
prosperity of the whole nation. To basically provide enough food
and clothing for the country's rural poor people by the end of
this century is a strategic goal set by the CPC Central Committee
and the State Council.
</P>
<P>
"Poverty is by no means socialism," the editorial says, quoting
a famous saying by Deng Xiaoping.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, the Chinese government drafted a national seven-year
poverty-eradication program to solve the lack of food and clothing
faced by the country's 80 million poor people, which provides
basic guidelines for wiping out poverty by the end of the century.
</P>
<P>
The editorial quotes Jiang Zemin as saying "By the end of this
century, when we solve the problem of food and clothing for the 80
million poor people, the problem about the right to subsistence,
the top and basic human right issue for the Chinese people, who
make up one fourth of the world's entire population, will be
completely solved. This is not only a great event in the history
of the Chinese nation, but also a great step in the development
history of mankind."
</P>
<P>
In the three years that the national poverty-relief program has
been in operation, outstanding achievements have been made, the
paper says.
</P>
<P>
Although the country's poor population has been decreasing, it
is becoming more and more difficult to solve the problem of
poverty, the paper stresses.
</P>
<P>
The great attention paid by the central leadership, the
effective measures, the current reform and opening up, the
strengthening of the comprehensive national strength and the
strong desire and positive attitude of the people, especially
poverty-stricken people, to wipe out poverty have brought hope to
the campaign.
</P>
<P>
However, harsh natural conditions in the poor areas, which are
mostly located in the remote southwest and northwest, have created
enormous obstacles, the editorial notes.

<P>
To realize the poverty-relief goal by the end of the century,
the editorial urges Communist Party committees and governments at
all levels, especially those in the poverty-stricken areas, to
keep in mind the principle of serving the people wholeheartedly.
</P>
<P>
The successful experiences of the country in poverty relief
show that only socialism can fairly, reasonably and efficiently
distribute the social wealth in line with the demands of human
development, while pushing forward economic development and
creating social wealth, the editorial says.
</P>
<P>
It holds that the socialist system and the leadership of the
Chinese Communist Party provide the political advantages for
eradicating poverty.
</P>
<P>
Under the leadership of the Communist Party, Chinese people
have won political emancipation through hard struggle, and have
succeeded in promoting the economic and social
development. Therefore, they can also surely wipe out poverty
through hard struggle, realize common prosperity of the whole
nation, and contribute to the eradication of poverty worldwide,
the editorial concludes.
</P>
<P>
The paper calls on all Chinese to make strenuous efforts in
carrying out the battle against poverty by following Deng
Xiaoping's theory of building socialism with Chinese
characteristics and by closely uniting around the CPC Central
Committee with Jiang Zemin at the core.

<HEADLINE> WHO Launches Project to Control Cholera in West Africa </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The World Health Organization
(WHO) said today that its regional office for Africa has begun a
new project to halt a surge of cholera in 16 countries of West
Africa.
</P>
<P>
According to the WHO, the incidence of cholera has risen
dramatically throughout West Africa in the past three years.
Thirteen of the 16 countries in the region have reported cholera
in 1996, compared to only six in 1993.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the annual number of cholera cases in the region has
exploded from a total of 7,000 in 1993 to 42,500 in the first nine
months of this year.
</P>
<P>
The number of cholera fatalities has risen even faster during
the same period, from 369 deaths in 1993 to more than 2,900 this
year. The West Africa region now accounts for two thirds of all
cases on the continent and more than 70 percent of all cholera
deaths.
</P>
<P>
The WHO said that the data clearly show that the weight of the
cholera burden on the continent has shifted from the south and
east to West Africa.
</P>
<P>
To improve the region's capacity to identify outbreaks quickly,
the WHO will help establish a regional network of clinical
laboratory support and supply laboratories with essential
reagents.
</P>
<P>
Another primary objective of the WHO project is to reduce the
cholera fatality rate from the current 6 percent to 1 percent or
less by improving case management, especially by promoting greater
use of oral rehydration solution and, in severe cases, appropriate
antibiotics.
</P>
<P>
The project will also seek to improve the capacity of
participating countries to develop and implement a common policy
for epidemic preparedness and control.
</P>
<P>
Countries participating in the project are Benin, Burkina Faso,
Cameroon, Chad, Cote d'Ivoire, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea,
Guinea-Bissau, Liberia, Mali, Niger, Nigeria, Senegal, Sierra
Leone and Togo.

<HEADLINE> 22 Die of Encephalitis, Meningitis in Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Recent outbreaks of
encephalitis and meningitis have claimed 22 lives in four
districts of southern Nepal, the official news agency RSS reported
today.
</P>
<P>
The diseases, which sporadically hit Rupandehi, Nawal Parasi,
Kapilvastu and Palpa districts in the Lumbini zone about 100
kilometers southwest of Kathmandu, have in the past month or more
spread as epidemics, it said.
</P>
<P>
Thirteen of the 68 encephalitis patients admitted to the
Lumbini zonal hospital have died as of last week, hospital sources
were quoted by the RSS as saying.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, of the 74 meningitis patients in the hospital, nine
have died.
</P>
<P>
The patients receiving treatment in the hospital are mostly
children, of whom nine have died so far.
</P>
<P>
The increasing incidence of encephalitis and meningitis has led
to a shortage of necessary medicines in the affected area, a
hospital official said, adding that the number of patients
visiting the hospital is growing.
</P>
<P>
People in rural areas are found to be more susceptible to the
diseases due to poor sanitation.

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Veteran Tranmere
player-manager John Aldridge has been recalled to the Republic of
Ireland squad for the World Cup qualifying tie against Macedonia
at Lansdowne Road in Dublin on October 9.
</P>
<P>
Aldridge could win his 69th cap against the Macedonians. The
38-year-old striker has so far scored 19 international goals,
just one short of Frank Stapleton's Irish record.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile Manchester United midfielder Roy Keane could be
missed from manager Mick McCarthy's original selection due to
injuries.
</P>
<P>
Keane has not played for his country since being sent off in
the dying seconds of a 2-0 defeat by Russia in a friendly in
Dublin last March.
</P>
<P>
With the absence of Keane, McCarthy may use Jason McAteer in
his starting line-up. The Liverpool man missed last month's
triumph in Liechtenstein as he suffered a virus on the day of the
game.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Urges Israel to Stick to Peace </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League ended its
two-hour emergency meeting here today, urging Israel to stick to
peace agreements and start negotiations on the final status of
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member Arab League warned Israel in a three-page
statement that clashes in the Palestinian territories could create
"a whirlpool of violence, instability and bloodshed."
</P>
<P>
"We call on Israel to lift its siege on Jerusalem and on all
Palestinian land," the league said in the statement issued at the
end of the emergency meeting called by Palestinian leader Yasser
Arafat.
</P>
<P>
The emergency meeting was held amid an escalation of tension
between Israel and the Palestinians in the wake of Israel's
opening of a tunnel in Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The member states' permanent delegates to the 22-member league
attended the meeting and discussed the serious conditions in
Jerusalem and the Palestinian self-ruled areas.
</P>
<P>
The meeting came just one day after the opening of the tunnel
triggered clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops in
Jerusalem and the West Bank town of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians' riots, which broke out in protest of the
opening of the 500-meter-long tunnel, were the worst violence
since the 1987-93 Intifada, or uprising, against Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
Arab League Secretary General Esmat Abdul-Meguid condemned the
Israeli move at the meeting, saying the opening of the tunnel
under Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, which the Jews call the Temple
Mount, has stirred Palestinian resistance.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the riots continued and spread to
Gaza today.
</P>
<P>
In two days of clashes, more than 20 Palestinians and two
Israeli soldiers have been killed, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid warned that the tunnel seriously endangers the
structure of Al Aqsa Mosque, thus the mosque itself may collapse.
</P>
<P>
Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest shrine of Islam, after
Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel, which was completed late Monday night, has angered
Palestinians and other Arabs, who accuse Israel of trying to turn
Jerusalem into a wholly Jewish city and obliterate sites of
importance to Moslems.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Jerusalem is believed to be the most contentious
one in Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. Israel claims the city to
be its eternal and indivisible capital, while the Palestinians
regard Arab east Jerusalem as the capital of their future
independent state.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Sobeih, the Palestinian ambassador to the Arab League,
said at the emergency meeting that the Palestinian territories
have turned into a battlefield.
</P>
<P>
"We are now confronted with a state of war with Israel," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the meeting to help pressurize Israel into stopping
their practices against the Palestinians so that the bloodshed
could end.

<HEADLINE> French Law Aims to Toughen Crackdown on Illegal Employment </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- France will soon put into force
a new law for toughening the crackdown on illegal employment which
is sucking in 1.1 percent of the country's national wealth.
</P>
<P>
The law, presented by Prime Minister Alain Juppe on Tuesday,
will serve as "an accelerator blow" against underground
enterprises as well as their patronizers, the Minister of Labor
Jacques Barrot told the local press today.
</P>
<P>
About 80 billion francs (about 16 billion U.S. dollars) is
gulped each year by the black economy, according to the French
National Statistics and Economics Study Institute.
</P>
<P>
But underground enterprises most often employ French workers
and legal foreign residents, while only 10 percent of the
clandestine work force are made up with illegal immigrants,
according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Describing illegal employment as a problem of "national
priority," the minister said that once the law comes into force,
the government will reject application for employment and
professional training aid from enterprises involved in illegal
employment.
</P>
<P>
France is burdened with a 12.5 percent unemployment rate and
the French government is adopting an austerity budget of public
spending in order to meet European Union's criteria for entering
European Monetary Union in 1999.
</P>
<P>
Barrot said that the government will prepare "a black list" of
those from big companies signing contracts with underground
workshops to sub-contract illegally employing workers.
</P>
<P>
Police and government agents will be empowered to entering
factories and construction sites to check papers whenever they
want, according to the draft law, which will be submitted to the
National Assembly in its full session next week.

<HEADLINE> Fatah Movement Calls for All-out Battle Against Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The PLO Fatah movement
today called for staging a "battle of all Palestinians" to
confront Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
In a statement that Xinhua received, Fatah High Committee
denounced the current violent clashes between Israeli soldiers
and Palestinians as a "crime" committed by Israeli "occupation
government."
</P>
<P>
"The latest Israeli crime forms a harsh blow to all who call us
for patience and pause. Also the crime will drag the entire area
to a coming war. Israel bears the total responsibility on the
severe deterioration," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
In two days of bloody clashes, Israeli soldiers killed more
than 20 Palestinians and wounded over 300 across the self-rule
areas of West Bank and Gaza Strip. Stone-throwing Palestinian
teenagers and armed policemen fought fierce street battles with
Israeli soldiers, reviving memories of the 1987-1993 Intifada, or
Arab Uprising.
</P>
<P>
This is the worst violence since the two sides made peace
since 1993, endangering the whole peace process. It was triggered
by Israel's opening a controversial underground tunnel in east
Jerusalem, which Moslems accused of being a plot to undermine
their holy places above.
</P>
<P>
The Fatah statement denounced Israeli government for starting
the battle against all Palestinians by returning to settlement
policy, at a time when it should implement the signed agreements.
</P>
<P>
It said that the occupation policies by Israeli government
justified Palestinians' "right to practice all forms of struggle
particularly after the occupation military treaded over all the
signed accords."
</P>
<P>
"We call our people and their political forces to form an
expanded national front entitled Jerusalem Front for confronting
the occupation. This is the battle of all Palestinians," the
satement said.
</P>
<P>
The statement stated that Fatah Movement would strive to
protect Palestinian people and their national rights in general,
especially the sovereignty over Hebron and Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"With all of our force, we will encounter the Israeli policy
that aims at Judaizing the two cities," it said.
</P>
<P>
It also called on the U.S. and Russia, co-sponsors of the
Middle East peace process, to halt "Israeli dangerous practices
aiming at blowing up the peace process."
</P>
<P>
In the meantime, it required all Arab countries to freeze any
effort to develop relations with Israel, and recall their
diplomatic envoys. It demanded an urgent Arab summit to discuss
"Israeli crimes against Jerusalem" and its intransigence
obstructing peace talks with Syria and Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
At last, the statement urged all Palestinian prayers to hold
demonstrations after the Friday prayer in the Al-Aqsa Mosque in
east Jerusalem tomorrow to protest against Israel's policies
against Moslem holy sites.
</P>
<P>
Jerusalem police are put on high alert in anticipation of
possible spill-out of bloodshed in Jerusalem. Police dispersed
several minor demonstrations in Jerusalem Wednesday and today,
without causing major violence.

<HEADLINE> China Expects Further International Anti-Poverty Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China expects to increase its
exchanges and cooperation with the international community in
order to successfully eliminate poverty in the country,
Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government and people endorse and support the
United Nations' global initiative for wiping out poverty through
action, Jiang said at the Commemoration of the International Year
for the Eradication of Poverty.
</P>
<P>
Boutros Boutros-Ghali, secretary-general of the United Nations,
sent a message to the meeting, which was held by the State
Council, China's highest governing body, expressing his support
for China's work in this area.
</P>
<P>
China formulated a national program for poverty alleviation in
1994, aimed at solving the problem of food and clothing for the
nation's eighty million poverty-stricken residents by the turn of
the century.
</P>
<P>
"The implementation of the program has, on the whole,
progressed smoothly and produced tangible results," Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
While the poverty-stricken population in the world is expanding
by 25 million each year, the figure for China dropped from 250
million in 1978 to 65 million last year, according to official
statistics.
</P>
<P>
Most of the poor population live in remote, backward and
economically underdeveloped regions, Jiang said. To help them,
China must show greater determination and take more effective
measures, in the poverty-relief work, he added.
</P>
<P>
While relying mainly on itself to tackle the problem, China
hopes that international exchanges and cooperation will continue
to grow and play a greater role in poverty eradication in the
country, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said in his message that poverty is "a
global concern requiring global attention."
</P>
<P>
"By focusing on poverty, we continue the vital work of building
a more just, equitable and humane world," the secretary-general
said. "China has displayed constant vision and leadership in this
quest, to the lasting benefit of all members of the international
community."
</P>
<P>
He noted that China is one of the few countries in the world
that has introduced a comprehensive national program to eliminate
poverty by the year 2000, and that the UN organizations will
continue to support the efforts of China to successfully implement
its poverty alleviation program in the coming years.

<P>
The country's three leading shipbuilders -- Dalian Shipyard,
Shanghai Hudong Shipyard, and Jiangnan Shipyard -- will use the
money to build six export-oriented vessels with a combined
capacity of more than 200,000 tons, including two 73,000-ton ships.
</P>
<P>
The banks that offered the loans include Japan's Sumitomo Bank
Ltd. and Sanwa Bank Ltd, the Credit Suisse of Switzerland, the
Credit Lyonnais of France, the National Bank of France, and the
Shanghai-Hong Kong Banking Corporation.
</P>
<P>
"It is the advantage and hope of CSSC to enhance the export of
its vessels," Chen Xiaojin, vice-president of CSSC, said in a
speech during the signing ceremony.
</P>
<P>
With the upgrading of China's status in the international
shipbuilding and navigation sector, more and more overseas
financial institutions and shipbuilders want to establish stable
and long-term relationships with CSSC, and they are welcome, Chen
said.
</P>
<P>
A group of international banking businesses led by the Royal
Bank of Canada reached the first overseas loan agreement of more
than 45 million US dollars with CSSC, the country's national flag
carrier, last December, sources said.
</P>
<P>
China's shipbuilding industry quickly entered the world market
after the country's opening-up drive started in 1979. Its
shipbuilding output ranked third in the world last year.
</P>
<P>
Export commodities of CSSC, with vessels accounting for the
majority, are now marketed in more than 40 countries and regions,
including Japan, the Republic of Korea, the United States,
Germany, and Norway.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the corporation had a combined industrial
output value of 9.73 billion yuan in the first seven months of
this year, up 17.5 percent over the same period a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Over the period, 550,000 tons of ships were exported, involving
an output value of nearly five billion yuan (about 602 million
US dollars).

BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng today
told a group of foreign experts attending the fifth meeting of the
China Council for International Cooperation on Environment that
sustainable development requires the improvement of overall
economic quality.
</P>
<P>
China put forward its sustainable development strategy in a
long-term plan which was issued in March, Li said.
</P>
<P>
He said that China has made significant progress in
environmental protection, noting that governments at all levels
have adopted measures to protect rural environments from pollution
and to keep the ecological balance from being destroyed.
</P>
<P>
"We have decided to close those factories that use backward
techniques and produce severe pollution, and have issued a series
of rules and regulations on environmental protection," Li said.
</P>
<P>
The council has played an important role in China's
environmental protection work, and suggestions offered by the
council have been well received, Li said.
</P>

<HEADLINE> Arab League Chief Condemns Israeli Actions in </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General
Esmat Abdul-Meguid condemned here today the Israeli measures in
Jerusalem such as the opening of a tunnel near Al-Aqsa Mosque and
the expansion of Jewish settlements.
</P>
<P>
Addressing an emergency meeting of the Cairo-based league,
Abdul-Meguid said that the measures were considered not only as a
flagrant violation of the holy city's Islamic sanctuaries, but
also of the Israeli-occupied Arab lands.
</P>
<P>
The one-day meeting was held amid an escalation of tension
between Israel and the Palestinians in the wake of Israel's
opening of the tunnel in Arab east Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The member states' permanent delegates to the 22-member league
are attending the meeting to discuss the serious conditions in
Jerusalem and the Palestinian self-ruled areas.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, convened at the request of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, came just one day after the opening of the tunnel
triggered clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops in
Jerusalem and the West Bank town of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians' riots, which broke out in protest of the
opening of the 500-meter-long tunnel, were the worst violence
since the 1987-93 Intifada, or uprising, against Israeli
occupation.
</P>
<P>
The opening of the tunnel under Al-Aqsa Mosque compound, which
the Jews call the Temple Mount, has stirred Palestinian
resistance, the Arab League chief said.
</P>
<P>
According to media reports, the riots continued and spread to
Gaza today.
</P>
<P>
In two days of clashes, more than 20 Palestinians and two
Israeli soldiers have been killed, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Abdul-Meguid warned that the tunnel seriously endangers the
structure of Al Aqsa Mosque, thus the mosque itself may collapse.
</P>
<P>
Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest shrine of Islam, after
Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The tunnel, which was completed late Monday night, has angered
Palestinians and other Arabs, who accuse Israel of trying to turn
Jerusalem into a wholly Jewish city and obliterate sites of
importance to Moslems.
</P>
<P>
The Arab League said in a statement Tuesday that the completion
of the tunnel was part of Israel's attempt to Judaize Arab east
Jerusalem and destroy its Arab and Islamic features.
</P>
<P>
But Israel says that opening the tunnel will give tourists
easier access to archaeological sites beneath the Wailing Wall,
Judaism's holiest site.
</P>
<P>
"Policies adopted by the Israeli government toward the
Palestinian people run counter to the principles of international
legitimacy and Palestinian-Israeli agreements," said Abdul-Meguid.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians hold that the tunnel violates Israeli
assurances that no changes would be made in Jerusalem until the
city's future status has been determined through peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
The issue of Jerusalem is believed to be the most contentious
one in Palestinian-Israeli peace talks. Israel claims the city to
be its eternal and indivisible capital, while the Palestinians
regard Arab east Jerusalem as the capital of their future
independent state.
</P>
<P>
Mohammed Sobeih, the Palestinian ambassador to the Arab League,
said at the emergency meeting that the Palestinian territories
have turned into a battlefield.
</P>
<P>
"We are now confronted with a state of war with Israel," he
said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the meeting to help pressurize Israel into stopping
their practices against the Palestinians so that the bloodshed
could end.

<HEADLINE> Asphalt Plants to Get Privileges in Thailand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Investors in asphalt
production in Thailand will get preferential treatment such as
tax breaks under a decision announced today by the Board of
Investment (BOI) of Thailand.
</P>
<P>
The board said in a press release that it has re-opened what it
calls the investment promotion category for raw asphalt and
emulsion asphalt, which had been closed for three years.
</P>
<P>
The re-opening of this category is intended to help boost
production and thus meet strong demand for asphalt, which is
expected to reach 1 million tons in 1997, according to the board
chaired by Thai Prime Minister Banharn Silpa-Archa.
</P>
<P>
However, the privileges will be granted only to factories
located in remote provinces instead of Bangkok and its neighboring
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Manufacturers who wish to be issued a BOI promotion certificate
are required to obtain approval from the Ministry of Industry,
which will supervise construction and operation of all raw asphalt
plants.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Thailand's annual asphalt production capacity is
about 450,000 tons, but demand is expected to exceed 1 million
tons after 1997 as the country is planning to extend its highway
system to all provinces.

PARIS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
reportedly telephoned Palestinian President Yasser Arafat today to
express France's support to the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Chirac made the call as clashes between the Israelis and

<HEADLINE> Jordan Denounces Israeli Actions in Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Jordan reiterated here today
its denounciation of Israeli actions in Arab East Jerusalem,
saying that they constitute obstacles in the way of the Middle
East peace process.
</P>
<P>
Jordan's acting Foreign Minister Abdul Hadi Majali said that
it was a firmly announced Jordanian position that the
geographical nature of Jerusalem along with other cities should
not be tempered with.
</P>
<P>
He blamed Israel for its hardline stance which, he said,
turned negotiations with the Palestinians to the "zero" point.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli government's decision to open a tourist tunnel
near the Al Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem has led to new waves of
protests and denounciations from Arab world and an unprecedented
severe conflict between the Palestinians and Israeli forces.
</P>
<P>
Israeli troops reportedly shot dead at least 10 Palestinians
and wounded over 70 others in clashes in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip today.
</P>
<P>
The conflict between Palestinians and Israeli troops has
prompted Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to cut short
his current visit in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that the current conflict between Israel
and the Palestinians, Israel's shelling of south Lebanon and the
trade of verbal attacks between Tel Aviv and Cairo might derail
the Middle East peace process, which has been deadlocked since
Israeli former Prime Minister Shimon Peres launched a military
operation in South Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
They believe that the peace process could be ruined by
Netanyahu's hardline policy vis-a-vis the peace talks unless the
Israeli government shifted its attitude towards the agreed-upon
principle of "land for peace."

<HEADLINE> HK Mortgage Loans Rise Slightly in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The growth of residential
mortgage loans for the purchase of properties in Hong Kong slowed
in August, according to a monthly survey conducted by the Hong
Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA).
</P>
<P>
The total amount of outstanding mortgage lending by the 33
institutions in the survey increased by 0.6 percent in August to
304.8 billion HK dollars (39.3 billion US dollars). The growth
rate is substantially below the monthly average of 1.4 percent
over the last 12 months.
</P>
<P>
"Loan growth eased in August, reflecting the reduced activity
in the primary property market in the preceding month," said David
Carse, deputy chief executive of HKMA.
</P>
<P>
The annual growth rate in lending in last June-August period
decreased to 14.3 percent from 17.7 percent in last May-July
period. The 12-month average of outstanding loans ending in
August showed an average monthly growth rate of 16.2 percent,
compared with 16.6 percent in the 12-month period ending in July.
</P>
<P>
Of the 11.9 billion HK dollars (1.54 billion US dollars) new
loans approved in August, about 84 percent were accounted for by
properties aged 15 years or below.
</P>
<P>
Lending for the purchase of properties in China increased by
1.1 percent to 5.8 billion HK dollar (748 million US dollars) in
August. New loans approved in August decreased in number from 370
to 338 and in amount from 269 to 238 million HK dollars (34.7 to
30.7 million US dollars).

<HEADLINE> Shuttle Atlantis Returns Home With Record-Setting Astronaut </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- U.S. space shuttle
Atlantis landed this morning at Kennedy Space Center in Florida,
ending astronaut Shannon Lucid's 188-day voyage, the longest space
endurance by a woman and an American.
</P>
<P>
The weather over the landing site this morning was favorable,
with wispy clouds and light winds for the first landing
opportunity. The shuttle touched down at the runway at 8:13
a.m. local time successfully in spite of the failure of one of its
three hydraulic units that control the rudder, wing flaps and
landing gear.
</P>
<P>
Lucid, a 53-year-old biochemist and mother of three children,
took off on Atlantis and was supposed to return to Earth in early
August. But equipment trouble and two hurricanes delayed the
shuttle's launch, leaving her in orbit an extra seven weeks.
</P>
<P>
Atlantis took off on September 16, and docked with the Russian
space station Mir on Wednesday night. U.S. astronaut John Blaha,
54-year-old retired Air Force colonel, took Lucid's place. He is
the third American to live on Mir. The first was Dr. Norman
Thagard last year.
</P>
<P>
The shuttle and space station flew together for five days, and
the nine space crew members moved two tons of food, water and
other supplies from Atlantis to Mir and one ton of scientific
samples and equipment to the shuttle. Atlantis undocked from Mir
on Monday night.
</P>
<P>
A fifth Atlantis-Mir-docking mission is planned for next
January. Atlantis will bring up U.S. astronaut Jerry Linenger to
Mir and give Blaha a home ride.

<HEADLINE> Ethiopians Stage Hunger Strike in Mogadishu </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Ten Ethiopians began their
hunger strike at a human rights organization in North Mogadishu
today to protest the insecurity in the Somali capital where their
compatriots got killed.
</P>
<P>
Their spokesman Mesfin Asefa said today that the strikers,
aged from 19 to 30, will "fight to death" until they're evacuated
from Somalia to their homeland in Ethiopia.
</P>
<P>
"We have no better options. This is the only way we can
attract the eyes of the international community," Asefa, a
27-year-old former apprentice soldier for Ethiopia's toppled
military Head of State Mengistu Haile Mariam, confessed when
speaking about the reason to start the hunger strike.
</P>
<P>
The young man, together with many other former soldiers, came
to Somalia when Mengistu was overthrown. They have been turned
into cooks, waiters, cleaners, or porters working in Mogadishu.
</P>
<P>
According to the human rights organization, the strikers
refused to drink anything, even the morning coffee today.
</P>
<P>
The organization therefore issued this morning an appeal to
the Nairobi office of the Red Cross and the Ethiopian Embassy in
Nairobi for humanitarian evacuation for the Ethiopian nationals.
But so far no response has been received.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, four Ethiopian nationals were killed in
Mogadishu while two others were killed in the city of Beletuein.
The murders were believed to have been conducted by Somalia's
Moslem fundamentalist group the Al-Itihad Al-Islam.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Ethiopia and the Al-Itihad Al-Islam have
been worsening ever since the fundamentalists claimed the
responsibility of bomb attacks in hotels in the Ethiopian capital
of Addis Ababa and the assassination attempt of the Ethiopian
minister for Transport and Communication in Addis Ababa three
months ago.
</P>
<P>
Last month, more than two brigades of Ethiopian troops,
supported by helicopter gunships and tanks, crossed the border
and delivered a major attack on the Somali towns of Dolow, Luq
and Bulohawo where Al-Itihad Al-Islam had strong basses.

<HEADLINE> Palestinian Islamic Authorities Refutes Israeli Claim </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Higher
Islamic Committee and Waqf Council have issued a statement
denying an Israeli claim that the Palestinian side had agreed to
opening the controversial tunnel below al-Omariyye School in the
Old City of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The statement was referring to Israeli press reports quoting
hardline Likud Mayor of Jerusalem Ehud Olmert, according to a
report of JMCC, a Palestinian press service based in East
Jerusalem today.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that the Higher Islamic Committee and Waqf
Council, being the only responsible party in charge of Islamic
holy sites and lands, totally reject and deny that there was an
agreement with any Israeli authority concerning the opening of the
tunnel, because none of the Islamic committees has the authority
to negotiate or compromise on any part of the Islamic waqf, and
this position is known to the local and international media.
</P>
<P>
"The false claims that were lashed out by (Ehud) Olmert cannot
cover up the Israeli aggressions against Islamic Waqf, nor can it
recruit public opinion in favor of the Israeli actions," it said.
</P>
<P>
"It is strange to hear Olmert's allegations, and at the same
time, Israeli PM (Benjamin) Netanyahu states from Europe that he
is proud to implement a decision taken by the former Labor
government."
</P>
<P>
The statement continued: "Being completely aware of our
responsibilities, we state it clearly that the Israeli allegations
are but tactics trying to reduce the effect of their aggressions
against Islamic sites in our Jerusalem."

<HEADLINE> Anti-Corruption: A protracted War in China (3) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
The anti-corruption drive has won the people's full support,
which is mainly embodied in their reports on offenses through
various hotlines. This year, procuratorates across the country
have received 209,708 tips on crimes committed in the economic
field, a 22.3 percent increase compared with the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Liyou, director of the Report Center of the Supreme
People's Procuratorate, said that 80 percent of the clues for
serious cases of graft, bribery and embezzlement come from these
reports.
</P>
<P>
More and more informants report with their real identities, an
indication of the people's confidence in the anti-corruption war,
Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
According to Liang Guoqing, deputy procurator-general of the
Supreme People's Procuratorate, the 26 provincial anti-corruption
bureaux and 293 prefectural and county bureaux in the
procuratorial organs will constantly improve themselves and get
more efficient.
</P>
<P>
"We should enhance our capacity of conducting investigations,
pay attention to the role of information in them, and train a
group of anti-corruption experts," Liang said.
</P>
<P>
Corrupt cases have been handled according to two laws, namely
the Criminal Law that defines the acts of crimes such as graft and
bribery; and the Criminal Procedure Law that ensures the
legitimate enforcement of the Criminal Law.
</P>
<P>
The revised Criminal Law will be put into effect on January 1,
1997, which offers a more effective weapon for the procuratorial
organs to fight corruption "while putting on more strict demands
on us," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We are studying it hard and getting ready to deal more
accurate, timely and powerful blows at the crimes committed by
government functionaries," the deputy procurator-general added.

<HEADLINE>   Death Toll Continues Rising in Worsening </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- At least 10 more people
were killed today in worsening clashes in the Palestinian
territories between Palestinian protesters and Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Two Israelis were killed and 20 others wounded in widespread
clashes that continued in the Gaza Strip and West Bank. They are
the first victims on the Israeli side in the second day of
wide-spread bloody confrontations, Israel Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures put the total number of casualties at 15
dead, and over 300 wounded in two days of violent conflicts that
were reminiscent of the 1987-1993 Intifada, or Palestinian
uprising.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, media reports said eight more Palestinians were
killed in today's clashes with Israeli soldiers. In Gaza Strip,
Palestinian protesters threw stones at a Jewish settlement and
clashes also occurred near the Erez checkpoint between Israel and
Gaza.
</P>
<P>
In Ramallah, the scene of the first bloody clash Wednesday,
stone-throwing Palestinians continued fighting with Israeli
soldiers. In Nablus, clashes also erupted between Palestinians
and Israeli troops near the Joseph's Tomb, a holy Jewish site.
</P>
<P>
In Jerusalem, hundreds of Israeli policemen were put on high
alert and dispersed Palestinian demonstrators near the Damascus
Gate to the Old City, but no violent clashes were reported.
</P>
<P>
Israel Radio said that armed Palestinian policemen took part
in the fighting for the second day. Israel charged Palestinian
police with sparking the first bloodshed in Ramallah by shooting
at Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
Israel braced more violence as the funerals for the victims in
Wednesday's clashes were taking place today. Israel has imposed a
total closure on the territories from Wednesday night, but Public
Security Minister Avigdor Kahalani expressed concern that the
total closure would only serve to heating up the tension.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, efforts continue to calm the situation which is in
danger of out of control.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who is currently
in Germany on a three-nation European tour, has decided to cut
short his visit to fly home today.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu telephoned Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat to ask
him to control the situation in order to save the peace
process. On Wednesday, Netanyahu telephoned Egyptian President
Hosni Mubarak, the leading mediator between Israel and
Palestinians, to help calm the situation.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Israeli President Ezer Weizman also asked Egyptian
Ambassador in Israel Mohammed Bassiouny to help cool the
tension.
</P>
<P>
The latest bloody conflicts, the worst since the two sides
made peace in 1993, were triggered by Israel's decision two days
ago to open a controversial underground tunnel in East
Jerusalem, which Palestinians accused of being a plot to
undermine the Moslem holy sites above.

<P>
TEHRAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The U.N. World Food Program
(WFP) provided food assistance worth 760,000 U.S. dollars to
some 40,000 new Iraqi Kurdish refugees for three and a half
months until the end of December 1996.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. Information Center in Tehran said that the

The commodities, except oil, are already in Iran and
sufficient quantities are being released from the existing stocks
for immediate distribution to the new refugees in the three
affected western provinces of West Azarbaijan, Kurdistan and
Kermanshah.
</P>
<P>
As for oil, efforts are being made to supply a small quantity
from nearby countries on an urgent basis to meet the immediate
requirements until the supplies arrive next month.
</P>
<P>
The WFP has also delivered a total of 110 tons of commodities
including 31 tons of oil from its stocks in northern Iraq to

<HEADLINE> Foreigners Evacuated From Afghan Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 26 (Xinhua) -- About 70 foreigners in the
embattled Afghan capital of Kabul left on emergency flights in the
past two days, said a report reaching here today.
</P>
<P>
The report said that the flights were provided by the United
Nation and the International Committee of the Red Cross.
</P>
<P>
Some of the foreigners who left Kabul went to the Afghan
northern city of Mazar-i-Sharif, the headquarters of
Junbush-i-Melli led by General Rashid Dostum, while others went
directly to Peshawar in northwestern Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
Many aid agencies in Kabul only keep a few staff to cope with
emergency programs while the exact number of foreigners remaining
in the battered capital is not known.
</P>
<P>
Unlike the UN and other non-governmental agencies in the past
the Red Cross has never completely pulled their staff out of
Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Of the four permanent diplomatic missions in Kabul -- those of
Iran, India, Indonesia and Turkey, only the Iranians are believed
to remain in Kabul.
</P>
<P>
It is reported that the fighting had forced the Red Cross to
temporarily freeze its flights between Kabul and Peshawar on the
border with Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The Afghan capital's only airport, also used as an air force
base, is located in Bagram, some 50 kilometers north of Kabul.
</P>
<P>
Afghan government forces and the Taliban, who advanced into the
edge of Kabul, have been locked in heavy fighting in the eastern
suburbs in the past two days.

SINGAPORE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The National Computer Board
(NCB) of Singapore and Sun Microsystems are to jointly set up a
Java Competency Center here, local television reported today.
</P>
<P>
It said that this would be the first of its kind in the
Southeast Asia region.
</P>
<P>
The NCB's Information Technology (IT) Institute will work with
Sun Microsystems, the Internet software giant, to develop a wide
range of Java-based programs.
</P>
<P>
Java is the Internet's newest computing language which is fast
becoming an industry standard.
</P>
<P>
NCB Chief Executive Officer Stephen Yeo said the new agreement
would boost Singapore's ability to become a key information
technology hub in the region.
</P>
<P>
This is because the competency center will be a focus for Java
innovations in Singapore and serve as a resource center for the
industry to develop new applications.
</P>
<P>
The center will receive nearly 3.5 million Singapore dollars
(about 2.5 million US dollars) in funding for the first three
years. It will be split between the NCB, and National Science and
Technology Board of Singapore and Sun Microsystems.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The following is the full
text of the message of Boutros Boutros-Ghali, secretary-general of
the United Nations, to China on the occassion of the Commemoration
of the International Year for the Eradication of Poverty that was
held by China's State Council in Beijing this afternoon:
</P>
<P>
This conference is yet another manifestation of China's
enduring commitment to the goals and ideals enshrined in the
Charter of the United Nations. I thank the Government and people
of China for hosting these valuable proceedings.
</P>
<P>
By meeting today, we sustain the momentum generated at the
Fourth World Conference on Women, held last September here in
Beijing, where remarkable progress was made in the empowerment of
the world's women. And by focusing on poverty, we continue the
vital work of building a more just, equitable and humane
world. China has displayed constant vision and leadership in this
quest, to the lasting benefit of all members of the international
community.
</P>
<P>
I want to convey to you, in the strongest possible terms, my
deep personal concern about poverty. Poverty offends the most
basic values of the Charter. It is an affront to human dignity,
and an intolerable violation of the rights of the human person.
</P>
<P>
Statistics reveal a world characterized by great disparities in
human well-being, and by widespread human need. The wealth of
nations has increased sevenfold since 1945, yet 1.3 billion people
live in absolute poverty. There is enough food for everyone on
earth, yet 800 million people, 200 million of them children, are
chronically undernourished. More than 1.5 billion people have no
access to health care, and 1.3 billion lack access to safe water.
</P>
<P>
This situation is unacceptable. It is unacceptable that
deprivation and despair should be the lot of so many people. And
it is unacceptable that the 20 percent of the world's population
at the top of the income ladder receives 83 percent of global
income, while the bottom 20 percent receives only 1.5 percent.

<P>
Anti-Pollution projects are being built in China's coastal
cities such as Qingdao, Yantai, Tianjin, Shenzhen, Zhuhai,
Guangzhou, and Shantou.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai City boasts a higher than 40 percent waste-treatment
rate. Throughout the country thousands of pollution-generating
small paper mills have been closed in a clean-up drive.
</P>
<P>
China has been engaged in ocean oil exploitation for more than
a decade, but no major accidents or oil spills have ever occurred,
a safety record mainly attributed to strict measures protecting
the oceanic environment.
</P>
<P>
All waste discharged by oil drilling platforms in the country's
sea areas meet discharge standards.
</P>
<P>
Treating plants for polluted oil have been set up in many ports
in China, and more than 95 percent of China's large fishing ships
have been equipped with facilities separating oil from water. As
many as 37 oceanic biology reserves have been set up to protect
coastal regions, islands, ocean resources, polders, wet lands, and
marine life.
</P>
<P>
A Law on Sea Environment Protection took effect in 1983, and
has played an important role in fighting against oceanic
environment pollution.
</P>
<P>
But the challenge ahead is still tough, with nearly 300 red
tides occurring in China's sea areas since 1980s, causing annual
economic losses of billions of yuan.
</P>
<P>
To improve the sea environment, China should make efforts to
control the total amount of waste discharged into the sea as soon
as possible, ocean environment experts have suggested.

<HEADLINE> Feature: Anti-Corruption, A protracted War in China (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The fact that an east China
city's leading official was executed this July, and three other
officials were sentenced to death with two years' probation has
shown China's determination to combat corruption.
</P>
<P>
Although this national fight against corruption was initiated
by China's top leaders, it has won wide support among the masses
and the results have turned out to be fruitful.
</P>
<P>
When an investigation on a fraud case was filed in October,
1994, procurators at Tai'an in east China's Shandong Province did
not expect that their probe would serve to expose a big graft case
and bring down six local officials, including the city's top
leader, Hu Jianxue.
</P>
<P>
Hu, secretary of the municipal Party committee of Tai'an while
the case was filed, was convicted of taking bribes worth a total
of 610,000 yuan (8.3 yuan equals one US dollar) between 1990 and
1995. In July, 1996, the higher people's court of Shandong
sentenced him to death with two years' probation.
</P>
<P>
Five other local leading officials got the same or more severe
punishments for their crimes. Two were also sentenced to death on
two years' probation and another two prisonment for life, while Li
Huimin, the local police chief, who was convicted of raping and
taking bribes worth 850,000 yuan, was sentenced to death and
executed immediately.
</P>
<P>
While the Tai'an case indicates the rampancy of embezzlement
and graft at certain places and among certain officials in China
today, it also demonstrates the Chinese legal workers and
government's determination to combat corruption.
</P>
<P>
"Major cases of graft and embezzlement involving leading
officials have been the focal point of our anti-corruption drive
this year," said Zhang Deli, spokesman for the Supreme People's
Procuratorate.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of this year, 34,070 cases related to
graft, bribery, embezzlement and other economic crimes were filed
for investigation in China, and these cases involved 1,478
officials at or above the county and section level.
</P>
<P>
Through investigations on these cases, Zhang said, a total of
2.029 billion yuan was recovered for the State, 500 million more
than that of the same 1995 period.

<TEXT>
<P>
Since its inception, the United Nations has lead the global
campaign for economic development and social progress. It
encourages universal adherence to the International Covenant on
Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. It promotes full realization
of the right to development. Its specialized agencies work to
improve living conditions throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
The International Year for the Eradication of Poverty provides
an excellent opportunity to redouble these efforts. But let us not
underestimate the challenge. Combating poverty requires extensive
international cooperation and bold national initiatives in several
priority areas, such as education and employment generation, basic
social services, food security, the control of drugs and
transnational crime, and access of the poor to credit, technology,
training and markets. The advancement of women, who are the prime
victims of poverty, is also essential.
</P>
<P>
China serves as a positive example. Following the "Earth
Summit" in Rio, it launched a comprehensive national Agenda 21
plan for the sustainable and balanced development of its economy,
society, resources and environment. It played a leading role at
the Fourth World Conference on Women. And the People's Republic
was represented at the highest level at the World Summit for
Social Development, where His Excellency Premier Li Peng called on
all nations to join hands for what he described as a "momentous,
historical mission".
</P>
<P>
The struggle against poverty responds to the deeply felt needs
and aspirations of the world's people. It is a global concern,
requiring global attention. The entire United Nations system
stands ready to assist in a joint effort aimed at nothing less
than the complete eradication of this scourge from the face of the
earth.
</P>
<P>
I would like to add that China is one of the very few countries
of the world that has introduced a comprehensive national program
to eliminate its absolute poverty by the year 2000 in accordance
with the decision taken by world leaders at the World Summit for
Social Development in Copenhagen. In this respect, China's 8-7
Poverty Alleviation Program has already made substantial progress
in its goal of basically eliminating absolute poverty among 80
million people in China's officially designated poor counties in
seven years. The World Bank, UNDP, World Food Program, UNICEF,
International Fund for Agricultural Development, FAO and other UN
organizations will continue to support the efforts of the
Government to successfully implement its 8-7 Poverty Alleviation
Program during the Ninth Five-Year Plan period.

<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China's coastal provinces are
making strenuous efforts to bring the blue sea water back to some
of the country's most-polluted offshore areas.
</P>
<P>
The quality of sea water in outer sea areas is basically good,
but pollution in offshore sea areas is becoming a serious problem.
</P>
<P>
Heavy metal pollution has been controlled, but oil pollution is
now mainly found in sea areas in the south, and pollution of
nutritive salt and organism has become grave.
</P>
<P>
"Industrial and domestic sewage poured into the sea are blamed
for 80 percent of sea pollution," said Chen Bingxin, vice-director
of the National Bureau of Oceanography.
</P>
<P>
"Coastal projects, ocean oil exploitation, ocean ships, and
high density sea breeding are also to be blamed," he added.
</P>
<P>
As much as 8.6 billion tons of waste was discharged into the
sea last year, and various waste-treating plants have been set up
by coastal provinces to control sea pollution.
</P>
<P>
Local governments are required by the law to order
waste-discharging plants to rectify the problem, and important
measures also include closures, production stoppages, and
relocation of polluting sources.
</P>
<P>
Dalian Bay used to be one of the most seriously polluted sea
areas in China, but pollution in the area has been controlled
thanks to the relocation of more than 80 enterprises from the city
of Dalian, an important port city in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
Malan River across Dalian City, which was the gathering place
of both industrial and life waste, was noted for its foul smell.
</P>
<P>
But now it has become a river full of clean water thanks to
efforts made by the city government. And a waste-water treatment
plant with a daily capacity of 120,000 tons is being built in its
estuary.

<HEADLINE> Arab League Opens Emergency Meeting on Jerusalem </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Arab League opened a
one-day emergency meeting here today amid an escalation of tension
between Israel and the Palestinians in the wake of Israel's
opening of a tunnel in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The member states' permanent delegates to the Cairo-based
league are attending the meeting to discuss the serious conditions
in Jerusalem and the Palestinian self-rule areas.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, convened at the request of Palestinian leader
Yasser Arafat, came just one day after the opening of the tunnel
triggered clashes between Palestinians and Israeli troops in
Jerusalem and the West Bank town of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
In Ramallah Wednesday, Israeli troops fired live ammunition,
rubber bullets and tear gas to break up stone-throwing riots, and
over 300 Palestinian protesters were hurt.
</P>
<P>
The riots, held in protest of the opening of the tunnel near Al
Aqsa Mosque, were the worst violence since the 1987-93 intifada,
or Palestinian uprising, against Israeli occupation.
</P>
<P>
Al-Aqsa Mosque is the third holiest shrine of Islam, after
Mecca and Medina in Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
The 22-member Arab League and the Palestinians have said that
the completion of the 500-meter-long tunnel was part of Israel's
attempt to Judaize Arab East Jerusalem and destroy its Arab and
Islamic features.
</P>
<P>
But Israel says that opening the tunnel will give tourists
easier access to archaeological sites beneath the Wailing Wall,
Judaism's holiest site.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, Minister of Planning and International
Cooperation at the Palestinian Authority Nabil Shaath called on
the Arab League permanent delegates, during their emergency
meeting, to adopt a firm stance in support of the Palestinian
people in the face of Israel's repeated violations of their rights
and sanctuaries.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Egypt's Sawt Al Arab (Voice of Arabs)
Radio, Shaath said that the meeting would be held amid a new
intifada in the West Bank.

<HEADLINE> Anti-Corruption: A protracted War in China (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In the first half of this year, some 7,065 lawbreakers from
these organizations were put on file for investigation and
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
Another concern of the anti-corruption drive is the criminal
practice that seriously jeopardized the country's reform progress
and economic development, Zhang said.
</P>
<P>
In this respect, he said, 1,984 cases related to bribery and
misappropriation of public funds were investigated in the area of
financial and negotiable securities business, which involved 2,142
people. And 137 functionaries in the administrative departments
for real estate development were prosecuted for their offenses.
</P>
<P>
Criminal cases in the state-owned enterprises and institutions
are not neglected, either, with 3,017 offenders in this field
filed and investigated in the first six months of 1996.
</P>
<P>
"Anti-corruption is an arduous and long-term task of ours which
concerns the future of our nation," said Zhang. "We cannot relax
our effort for a moment."
</P>
<P>
The protracted war is mainly targeted at crimes in leading
positions and key departments because corruption reflects the
degeneration of public power and is closely related to the use or
abuse of public power for personal gains.
</P>
<P>
In the struggle against corruption, leading officials at
various levels are required to discipline themselves through
self-education first. They are required to examine themselves
against the regulations for them.
</P>
<P>
Those engaged in wrongdoings are encouraged to check themselves
and confess through self-examinations, and turn in their
inappropriate gains. But for people who are not so "clean" and who
would take chances, disciplinary means or legal procedures will be
resorted to so as to resolve the problem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, anti-corruption bureaux have been established in
procuratorates at various levels to toughen the anti-corruption
efforts, Zhang added.

to 2273.4 points.

expiration of some share options also added to the buying interest
in the local bourse.

<P>
DALIAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Dalian, the leading open
coastal city in northeast China, has been equipped with a
well-developed service network for overseas clients.
</P>
<P>
Overseas investors find international settlement fairly
easy, since the city's financial institutions have ties with
counterparts in 155 countries and regions, thus
becoming an international settlement center in northeast China.
</P>
<P>
The work is also helped by the presence of all major Chinese
banks, insurance companies, and securities firms.
</P>
<P>
The foreign exchange market in Dalian is also the largest in
northeast China, accounting for 12 percent of the country's total
exchange dealings last year.
</P>
<P>
The turnover and the transaction value of the city's grain
futures trading account for the nation's fourth and fifth
respectively.
</P>
<P>
The city's law firms, public accountants offices, and other
intermediary agencies are also growing.
</P>
<P>
In infrastructure, as well as improved ports, power plants,
roads, gas supply, and posts and telecommunications, the city is
now building a water supply project believed to be the largest in

<HEADLINE> Sinn Fein Leader Cancels Parliament Visit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Sinn Fein President Gerry
Adams early today canceled his meeting at the House of Commons
with Labor left-wing Jeremy Corbyn scheduled for today, a
statement from the Sinn Fein office said.
</P>
<P>
The announcement followed threats from Labor leaders Wednesday
night to withdraw the party whip from Corbyn if he went ahead with
the meeting.
</P>
<P>
In response to the threats, Jeremy Corbyn declared that he
would go ahead with plans to meet Adams despite the threat of
disciplinary action.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for Corbyn, however, said it was not he who had
pulled out. The decision had been taken by Sinn Fein.
</P>
<P>
The private meeting, which the former Cabinet minister Tony
Benn had helped to organize, was part of Adams's two-day trip to
London.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the private meeting, Adams had originally a plan to
launch his autobiography in the Commons. But it was canceled by
parliamentary officials at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Donald Dewar, Labor's chief parliamentary business manager said
Wednesday night that it was "reprehensible" in the light of recent
events involving the Irish Republican Army (IRA).
</P>
<P>
On September 23, Scotland Yard foiled bombing plans of the IRA
with five suspects arrested and one killed in London.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has planted a number of bombs in Britain since calling
off a l7-month cease-fire in February, citing Britain's
intransigence over the progress of peace efforts in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Adams said that the timing of his visit was "not at all"
insensitive, even though it comes three days after the huge IRA
explosives were found in London.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Suspends Germany Visit Due to Violence at Home </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu suspended his visit to Germany today as a result of
escalating violence between Israelis and Palestinians, according
to a senior Israeli official.
</P>
<P>
Shi Bazak, the prime minister's spokesman, told reporters that
Netanyahu, who arrived from Paris in Germany Thursday as scheduled
for a one-day visit, would leave after meeting with German
Chancellor Helmut Kohl but canceling the planned talks with
Speaker of the German Federal Assembly Rita Suessmuth, as well as
opposition and Jewish leaders.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a third straight day of violence erupted between
Palestinians and Israeli forces in the Palestinian territories,
which had so far killed at least 10 Palestinians and wounded many
others.
</P>
<P>
Five Israeli soldiers were also wounded in the bloody
fight. Despite Israeli closure of Palestinian territories,
violence erupted again first in the Gaza Strip and then spread to
the West bank.
</P>
<P>
According to a local Palestinian report, Netanyahu had
telephoned Palestinian President Yasser Arafat in the day before
cutting short his Germany visit, appealing to him to cool the
tensions and end the latest violence.
</P>
<P>
Arafat agreed to make efforts and help stablize the situation
in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli prime minister began his Europe tour with a visit
to France, during which he was urged to restart the Arab-Israeli
peace process "on the right footing," after holding talks with
President Jacques Chirac and Prime Minister Alain Juppe.
</P>
<P>
The massive Palestinian protest campaign was touched off by
Israel's opening of a tunnel by the side of the Islamic holy site
of Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
Israel claimed that its opening was solely for the sake of
tourist development, but Palestinians charged that it would
undermine the Islamic holy site.

<HEADLINE> Taliban Believed Unable to Achieve Peace Alone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Pakistan does not think
peace will return to Afghanistan even if the Taliban Militia
controls Kabul, a Pakistani Foreign Office spokesman said here
today.
</P>
<P>
During a weekly briefing, the spokesman said all major Afghan
groups should be involved in a central government if they want to
achieve peace in the country.
</P>
<P>
They should come to the understanding that they cannot solve
the long-term problem by conquering each other, he added.
</P>
<P>
He said Pakistan would not object to Afghan government
officials, including President Burhanuddin Rabbani, Prime Minister
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, coming to Pakistan if Kabul fell.
</P>
<P>
All Afghan leaders have their families or houses in Pakistan,
he said, adding that there is nothing new if these leaders come to
stay in Pakistan.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman firmly denied the report that some Pakistani
military officers were on board when a Taliban jet defected to the
Kabul government recently.
</P>
<P>
He said that there is absolutely no truth in the allegation and
that Pakistan remains totally neutral in the Afghan factional
fighting.
</P>
<P>
He said however that it was possible that on board were some
Pakistani delegations, including religious ones, which visit Kabul
and other major cities frequently and engage actively in peace
negotiations.
</P>
<P>
But such visits are totally private and have nothing to do with
the Pakistani government, he noted.
</P>
<P>
The government is obliged to believe that sometimes, these
visits, more often than not, hinder the peace effort by the
Pakistani government, the United Nations and other countries.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the situation in Afghanistan, he said the Taliban
advanced to Kabul much faster than anticipated by most experts.

<HEADLINE> Delhi High Court Dismisses Rao's Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Delhi high court today
dismissed Indian former prime minister and president of the
Congress party P.V. Narasimha Rao's plea for anticipatory bail in
the Pathak cheating case of 100,000 us dollars.
</P>
<P>
In his brief order, Justice Mahajan said that the anticipatory
bail could only be entertained in cases where non-bailable arrest
warrants have been issued by the trial court. He rejected the
contention of Rao's counsel that Rao would be arrested immediately
on appearing before the trial court on September 30, saying that
the trial court had only issued summons to him.
</P>
<P>
In case Rao was arrested on his appearance before the trial
court, which fixed September 30 as the date for framing of charges
against the former prime minister in the cheating case, he was
free to make a regular bail application, the justice further said.
</P>
<P>
Delhi additional sessions judge Ajit Bharihoke on September 21
issued summons to Rao to appear before the court on September 30
for framing of charges against him.
</P>
<P>
UK-based non-resident Indian businessman Lakhubhai Pathak in
his testimony earlier had alleged that Indian godman Chandraswami
and his associate had duped him of 100,000 US dollars in 1983 on
the false promise of securing him newsprint and paper pulp
contracts in India and at that time then Indian foreign minister
Rao had assured of the contracts.
</P>
<P>
Rao made a plea to the Delhi high court here Wednesday for
anticipatory bail in the Pathak cheating case.

<HEADLINE> 1st Death Under Euthanasia Legislation in Australia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A 66-year-old cancer
sufferer, Bob Dent, used a "self-deliverance" machine on Sunday to
become the first man to die under the "Rights of the Terminally
Ill Act" legislated by the Northern Territory of Australia.
</P>
<P>
Bob Dent, a former builder and pilot, died at his home in
Darwin, Northern Territory (NT), using lethal drug administered by
a so-called "death machine," a computer-operated device, which
releases the drug after the patient pressed the required buttons.
</P>
<P>
The death is the first under the NT's landmark "Rights of the
Terminally Ill Act," which was passed by the state's Legislative
Assembly in May last year and enables a terminally ill patient to
request a doctor to administer a lethal drug it for
self-administration.
</P>
<P>
Under the act, a patient is required to obtain the signatures
of a doctor, a specialist in his illness who must confirm the
diagnosis and prognosis and a psychiatrist who must state the
patient is not suffering a treatable clinical depression.
</P>
<P>
Sunday's death came as the legislation faces its strongest
threat from a federal private member's bill introduced by a
Victorian backbencher, Kevin Andrews, which would overturn the
NT's legislation. The act has survived a Supreme Court challenge
but faces a High Court challenge in November.
</P>
<P>
While announcing the first death under the law, Philip
Nitschke, who is Dent's doctor and involved in Dent's death, told
a press conference in Darwin today that there were about five
other people actively seeking to use the NT's world first
euthanasia law, and it was possible another death could occur
within weeks.
</P>
<P>
The first death caused strong reaction throughout the country,
but the strongest came from the churches, which condemned the
death of a Darwin man by legally sanctioned euthanasia as "ugly
evil" and "a shameful day for Australia."
</P>
<P>
Deputy Prime Minister Tim Fischer said today "it was a step
away from the culture of life towards the culture of death." New
South Wales Premier Bob Carr said that he personally was against
laws that allowed voluntary euthanasia, adding that he would call
a special session of parliament to debate the issue on October 16
in his state.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister John Howard has promised the bill about the NT's
euthanasia legislation would be debated in the federal parliament
without delay.

<HEADLINE> Ramallah Government Condemns Israeli Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Municipal Council of
Al-Bireh, a satellite town of Ramallah, issued a statement today
sternly condemning what it called the rightwing Israeli's
government's policy of war, according to a report of JMCC, a
Palestinian press service based in East Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that five Palestinian civilians were killed
and over 200 wounded by Israeli soldiers at the southern
entrance of Al-Bireh.
</P>
<P>
"The peaceful march by the Palestinian masses toward Jerusalem
was a demonstration against the latest step of the right Likud
government of Israel to kill the peace process by renewing the
settlement drive in the Palestinian territory and to decide
unilaterally the future of Jerusalem in contradiction to all
agreements and against the international will to keep Jerusalem
open for three universal religions," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the Israeli army's reaction to this peaceful
march is a clear proof that "this new Israeli government is
not headed for peace as Mr. Netanyahu is trying to fool his
people and the world public opinion."
</P>
<P>
The statement called on all peace-loving forces across the
world to "condemn this Israeli policy and to demand from the
Israeli government to honor its commitments to the Palestinian
National Authority and to abide by the international consensus
with regard to the Palestinian rights and with regard to
Jerusalem and the holy places."

<HEADLINE> China Strongly Opposes US House's Act on Taiwan's Entering International Community </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China today warned that
Sino-US relations could be undermined by a House of
Representatives move to offer support to Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
A spokesman for China's Foreign Ministry in Beijing said today
that China is "seriously concerned and strongly opposes" an act
recently approved by the US House of Representatives which
supports Taiwan's entering the international community.
</P>
<P>
Commenting at a weekly press conference, spokesman Shen Guofang
said the act, approved on September 24, called for Taiwan's entry
into some international organizations was an attempt to support
Taiwan "re-entering the United Nations."
</P>
<P>
The move is open support to the Taiwan authorities in creating
"two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", thus seriously
interfering in China's sovereignty and internal affairs, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We express our serious concern and strong opposition to this
move, which seriously violates the three Sino-US joint
communiques," Shen said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman reiterated that Taiwan is an unalienable part of
the Chinese territory, and no foreign government, parliament or
other force has the right to interfere in any matters relating to
Taiwan, which belongs to China's internal affairs.
</P>
<P>
Shen noted that such a move by the US House of Representatives
to split China runs counter to the overwhelming will of the
international community, and will undermine Sino-US relations. He
added that this move will not succeed.

PARIS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has reawakened
Palestinian Intifada. Four Palestinians were killed and 200
wounded Wednesday when Israeli troops brutally suppressed
Palestinian demonstrations protesting the opening of a tunnel near
an Islam religious shrine in Jerusalem. By incessantly making
provocations, Netanyahu is playing with fire.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, disagreement persisted between France and Israel
over the Middle East peace process when Netanyahu visited Paris on
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
-- The vacuum of power in Russia is to be prolonged after a
council of doctors decided on Wednesday to make a heart bypass
operation on President Boris Yeltsin in six to 10 weeks.
</P>
<P>
But the risk of operation is not ruled out, as the U.S. heart
transplantation expert Michael Debakey said that one can safely
operate a heart bypass operation on an 80-year-old as long as he
is neither fat, nor alcoholic, nor smoking.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Israel has returned to Palestinian Intifada after the
opening of a tunnel along the esplanade of Mosque al Aqsa in
Jerusalem triggered an eruption of anger among thousands of
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
-- Meeting in Bergen, Norway, the defense ministers of 16 NATO
countries decided on Wednesday to prolong NATO's mission in Bosnia
after the Peace Implementation Force ends its mission in
December. However, the peace-keeping force is expected to be cut
by half or even two thirds, from 52,000 to 15,000-20,000, which
means that France will reduce its force in Bosnia from 7,500 to
2,500.
</P>
<P>
-- While attending the U.N. General Assembly in New York,
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette has urged the United
Nations to apply its oil-for-food plan with Iraq as quickly as
possible, as the humanitarian situation in Iraq is deteriorating
each day.

<TEXT>
<P>
MAPUTO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwean farmers are
looking forward to buying land in neighbouring Mozambique to
grow flowers, coffee, eucalyptus and other cash plants, the
local Noticias newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Mina Alumina Company exported 80 tons of cut
flowers to Holland last year, earning more than four million
U.S. Dollars.
</P>
<P>
Noticias quoted Artur Canana, Governor of the central
Mozambican province of Manica, as saying Zimbabwean farmers
hope to expand their flower exports while doing timber and
charcoal businesses in his province.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwean Mina Alumina Company applied for the purchase
of the land of the province in 1994, only to wait for further
discussions of cooperation, according to the governor.
</P>
<P>
By the middle of September this year, Mozambique's northern
Niassa Province had allocated 100,000 hectares of land for the
first 20 South African farmers to arrive for business
operations.

BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Beijing is paving the way for
the establishment of more branches of business-oriented foreign
financial institutions in the Chinese capital, a senior Beijing
bank official said.
</P>
<P>
Liu Chunming, deputy governor of Beijing Branch of People's
Bank China said at a meeting, called to introduce future foreign

</P>
<P>
He said foreign banks will be a major part of the introduced
foreign financial organs, and sole-foreign funded and Sino-foreign
jointly-run financial institutions will play a supplementary role.
</P>
<P>
By the end of August, 213 foreign-funded financial institutions
had opened offices in Beijing, with one billion U.S. dollars of
capital.

In 1995, foreign investment to China arranged by Beijing
offices of foreign-funded financial institutions reached 1.65

<P>
COLOMBO, September 26 (Xinhua)-- Over 30 Tamil rebels were
killed and some 50 others wounded Wednesday in clashes with
government troops during Operation Sathjaya (Certain Victory)
phase III in Northern province of Sri Lanka, a military spokesman
said today.
</P>
<P>
The troops engaged in Operation Sathjaya phase III in
Kilinochchi District continued to advance on two flanks amidst
tough resistance from the rebels.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said that on the western flank, the government
troops captured an important road junction on Wednesday.

<P>
Thirteen soldiers were killed and 30 others wounded during the
fighting.
</P>
<P>
Troops advancing south-eastwards took Nurusumudai, he said.

According to the latest military reports, the rebels launched a
massive counter-offensive during the early hours of this morning

counter-attack has been repulsed, inflicting heavy casualties on
the rebels.

<HEADLINE> IMF Gives Positive Assessment of Philippine Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- An International Monetary Fund
(IMF) team has concluded a two-week review of the Philippine
economy with an overall satisfactory assessment of this year's
performance, according to a statement issued here today.
</P>
<P>
In a joint statement issued by the IMF team and the Philippine
authorities, the IMF said that the economic expansion sustained
for a third year in the Philippines helped lift the country toward
the ranks of the fast growing industrializing countries and paved
the way for progress on the social reform agenda.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government's economic program is on track with
the growth of its gross national product comfortably within the
6.5 percent to 7.5 percent range and inflation declining rapidly,
the IMF team said.
</P>
<P>
It said that the overall balance of payments has been strong
and international reserves have increased sharply over the year.
</P>
<P>
"The steady reduction in external debt and debt service ratio,
with the prospect of continued economic expansion, has generated
strong foreign capital inflows and increasingly favorable terms
for the Philippines in capital market," the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
But the IMF team urged the Philippine authorities to pass a
comprehensive tax reform package, saying that a strong and
meaningful tax reform is critical, not only to secure the gains
made in the fiscal accounts in the recent years, but also to
permit an expansion of infrastructure spending and national
savings.
</P>
<P>
According to the statement, the IMF team and the Philippine
authorities agreed that the implementation of the tax reform will
be instrumental in sustaining higher economic growth and improving
social equity.

<HEADLINE> Manila Works Out Agenda for Sustainable Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos
announced here today that the Philippines has newly formulated an
agenda that emphasizes action rather than mere words in sustaining
the country's development in the next century.
</P>
<P>
He said the agenda, which is called "Philippine Agenda 21:
Towards Sustainable Development," was formulated after more than
one year's consultations between the government and the various
sectors of the society.
</P>
<P>
"The agenda emphasizes doing rather than mere consulting
because after all the dialogues and consultations were over, but
the question whether or not things can be done will still have to
be answered," he said at the 5th meeting of the Philippine Council
for Sustainable Development.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Ramos reiterated the three objectives he
said at the ministerial meeting of Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation (APEC) on sustainable development which was held in
Manila last July.
</P>
<P>
The objectives are the reduction and elimination of mass
poverty and promotion of equity, the preservation of environmental
resilience and the promotion of efficiency, or the ability of the
market to price resources according to the structure of supply and
demand and the wider consequences of their loss.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Ramos also pointed out the defects in the growth of
the Philippine economy. He said the United Nations Development
Program had reminded his country that its economic growth might
turn out to be jobless, ruthless, voiceless, rootless and
futureless.
</P>
<P>
If not careful, the economic growth will not generate adequate
meaningful and quality jobs while the country's gap between the
rich and the poor will become wider and the cultural diversity
will be eroded.

<P>
BONN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu suspended his visit to Germany today as a result of
escalating violence between Israelis and Palestinians, according
to officials from the Israeli embassy in Germany.
</P>
<P>
Earlier today, a third straight day of violence erupted between
Palestinians and Israeli forces in the Palestinian territories,
killing two more Palestinians and wounding many others in Gaza.
</P>
<P>
Five Israeli soldiers were also wounded in the bloody
fight. Despite Israeli closure of Palestinian territories,
violence erupted again first in the Gaza Strip and then spread to
the West bank.
</P>
<P>
Palestinians threw stones at Israeli soldiers and burned tires
today on the roads in protest against Israeli occupation following
two days of clashes with Israeli troops, which killed seven
Palestinian demonstrators and policemen, and wounded more than 300
others.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian massive protest campaign was touched off by
Israel's opening of a tunnel by the side of the Islamic holy site
of Temple Mount. Israel claimed that its opening was solely for
the sake of tourist development, but Palestinians charged that it
would undermine the Islamic holy site.

<HEADLINE> Angola Peace Process Still On, Says UN Envoy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUANDA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- UN special envoy to Angola
Blondin Beye has said that the Angola peace process is still on
with 5,000 of the 26,300-strong former rebel UNITA troops
selected for the integration of a national army.
</P>
<P>
Beye told a press conference about his optimism here on Wednesday
after his meeting with Angolan President Eduardo dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
Beye said he would meet UNITA leader Jonas Savimbi and
preside over the joint peace commission before attending a UN
Security Council meeting on Angola in October this year.
</P>
<P>
Beye made the announcement in the wake of a dispute between
the government and UNITA on the status of Savimbi in the future
government.
</P>
<P>
The ruling Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola
(MPLA) decided early in the year that the southern African state
have one president and two deputy presidents in the future.
</P>
<P>
UNITA later expressed strong opposition to the MPLA decision,
saying there should be one president and one deputy president in
the future.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement signed by the two sides in late 1994
in the Zambian capital Lusaka, Savimbi should be offered deputy
presidency in a government of national unity.
</P>
<P>
Savimbi has said that a second deputy president would mean a
surplus.

<HEADLINE> Two Foreign Banks to Establish Offices in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Philippine Central Bank
announced today that it has approved the establishment of offshore
banking units by Societe Generale and Chase Manhattan
International Finance Ltd. in the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Societe Generale had operated an offshore banking unit in the
Philippines from 1979 to 1992 until it decided to terminate its
Manila operations as a result of allocation of priorities by its
Paris headquarters.
</P>
<P>
According to banking sources, Societe Generale saw no bright
economic prospects in the Philippines in 1992, but the recent
economic situation in the country has made it reassess its
position.
</P>
<P>
Societe Generale was ranked the 19th largest bank in the world
in 1995 with its total resources at 326.5 billion U.S. dollars. At
the end of 1995, it had 2,000 branches in France and 500 offices
in 70 countries.
</P>
<P>
Chase Manhattan International Finance is a subsidiary of the
Chase Manhattan Bank of New York, which merged with the Chemical
Banking Corp. in July to become the Chase Manhattan Corp.
</P>
<P>
Chase Manhattan International Finance will assume the assets
and liabilities of the local offshore banking units of Chemical
Bank and the Chase Manhattan Bank.
</P>
<P>
The two offshore banking units will join 16 other offshore
banking units currently operating in the Philippines.

JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A third straight day of
violence erupted today between Palestinians and Israeli forces in
the Palestinian territories, killing two more Palestinians and
wounding many others in Gaza.

<P>
Five Israeli soldiers were also wounded in the bloody

violence erupted again first in the Gaza Strip and then spread to
the West bank.

Palestinians threw stones at Israeli soldiers and burned tires
today on the roads in protest against Israeli occupation following
two days of clashes with Israeli troops, which killed seven

<HEADLINE> Taxis Become Important Transport Means in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Bicycles and buses are no
longer the two major means of getting around for people in
Shanghai when they go shopping or on outings.
</P>
<P>
Instead, taxis have started to play a bigger part in people's
daily lives.
</P>
<P>
The local statistical bureau says that in 1995 the average
fares local residents spent on taxis increased by 55 percent and
the first six months of this year saw another jump.
</P>
<P>
Taxis, which undertake 300 million passenger journeys each
=year, have become an important part of public transportation in
China's largest metropolis, with a 14 million population.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai now has over 550 companies and 1,067 self-employed
business people involved in the taxi industry, and boasts 38,000
taxis of various kinds, ranking second place in China, next to
Beijing which has 63,000 taxis.
</P>
<P>
The starting fare for each taxi ranges from 10.8 yuan to 14.4
(8.3 yuan equals one US dollar), and local residents, whose
average monthly income is 700 yuan, can now afford the occasional
taxi ride.
</P>
<P>
The local public transport department has vowed to make every
effort to improve management of the taxi industry in a bid to
increase passenger satisfaction.

<TEXT>
<P>
China has found a way of "building socialism with Chinese
characteristics" expounded by Deng Xiaoping, who initiated reforms
that are aimed to establish a market economy in place of central
planning.
</P>
<P>
During the five years ending 1995, China received 160 billion
US dollars in foreign capital, 70 percent of which is in direct
investment from foreign businesses, and the rest from foreign
governments and banks. It boasts about 260,000 foreign enterprises
involving in the sphere of activities ranging from processing to
basic industries and infrastructure, and from coastal cities to
interior regions.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, exports and imports reached 280.9 billion US dollars,
ranking China 11th in the world's top trading nations. Its foreign
exchange reserves stood at 73.6 billion US dollars by the end of
the year.
</P>
<P>
Living standards of the Chinese people have improved, with the
income of urban residents increasing annually by 7.7 percent and
that of rural families by 4.5 percent over the last five years. The
number of people living below the poverty belt is now 65 million,
or 5.4 percent of the total population, from 85 million in the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
China has notched up successes in international communication
satellites, manufacture of military and civilian aircraft,
ocean-going vessels, its telephone networks, and construction of
new east-west and north-south trunk railways and expressways.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, new China remains a developing country, with its
huge population weighing down its per capita GNP to merely 540 US
dollars, according to a World Bank estimate. An urgent task for
the country is still to focus on economic development in the
decades ahead.
</P>
<P>
China will, therefore, continue to implement its independent
foreign policy of peace and friendship with all nations. And it
will continue to carry out its reform program aimed at setting up
a market economy, strive to build a stronger material and
technical basis for modernization, and improve the ethical and
cultural standards of its people.

WASHINGTON -- The United States State Department Wednesday
summoned a senior diplomat of the South Korean Embassy, and told
him the U.S. is very disturbed by his naval attache gathering
secret information.
</P>
<P>
Baek Dong-Il, the naval attache at the Washington embassy,
arrived on Oct. 1, 1994 for a three-year term. He will leave soon
for Seoul before the State Department declares him persona no
grata and expels him, said a Justice Department source.
</P>
<P>
The secret information Baek received was allegedly from Robert
Chaegon Kim, 56, who worked at the U.S. Office of Navy
Intelligence, in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Kim, a native of Seoul, became a U.S. citizen in 1974, and
began working for the Office of Naval Intelligence in 1978. He
worked a computer system that gave him access to top-secret
documents generated by other U.S. intelligence-gathering agencies.

SARAJEVO -- The United States has suspended the delivery of
weaponry to the Bosnian Federation Army because of its
dissatisfaction with the speed of establishing a joint
Muslim-Croat military force.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Federation Defense Minister Vladimir Soljic told the
Croatian News Agency (HINA) on Wednesday that the establishment of
the joint force was slow as the two sides missed the deadline for
the appointment of its commander and his deputy.
</P>
<P>
"We have the obligation to abolish the Defense Ministry of the
Republic and the Federation and the Defense Ministry of
Herzeg-Bosnia and link them into one ministry," Soljic said.
</P>
<P>
He believed the suspension of U.S. weapon delivery would slow
the implementation of the "Equip and Train" programme, the
U.S. plan to beef up the proposed joint Muslim-Croat army,
according to HINA.

DHAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh and India are
preparing the ground for an agreement on the sharing of Ganges
water by synchronizing the differences in data on the flow of the
river during the dry season.

<HEADLINE> Resources for Ecological Tourism Developed in Guizhou </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Scientists have concluded
that an underground lake in southwest China's Guizhou province has
the least natural radiation known in China.
</P>
<P>
With water screening gamma rays from the earth itself, and rock
stratum totally shutting sun rays out, the Longgong Lake in the
Anshun National Scenic Zone has become a popular tourist spot for
its unpolluted environment.
</P>
<P>
There are many such places in the mountains that span the
province, a local tourism official noted.
</P>
<P>
Yang Shengming, director of the provincial tourism
administration, said inconvenient transport with the outside, once
a liability for the province's development, has now unexpectedly
helped preserve valuable resources for the development of
ecological tourism.
</P>
<P>
Ecological tourism is becoming increasingly popular in the
world, and Guizhou's diversified and well-preserved natural
ecological environment will give tourists more access to Mother
Nature, she added.
</P>
<P>
A mountainous province in a plateau region in southwest China,
Guizhou is known to have more than 3,000 species of woody plants
and over 900 species of vertebrates, with many of them given
national protection status.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, an ecological protection network, with 21
natural preservation zones, with a total are of 246,000 hectares
has been built in the province.
</P>
<P>
Four of these zones are national level. The Fanjing Mountain
Natural Preservation Zone in northeast Guizhou is home to Qian
golden monkeys, an endangered species under first-rate national
protection. After the establishment of the zone, the number of
monkeys has grown to more than 700, twice that of a decade ago.
</P>
<P>
There are also rare karst forests and plateau lake ecological
systems in the zones.
</P>
<P>
The rich variety of ecological zones has sparked the interest
of specialists in animal protection and ecologists across the
world, and dozens of experts have visited the zones.
</P>
<P>
Tourists have been attracted to Guizhou also, to enjoy the
well-preserved natural scenes and well-protected rare animals in
the preservation zones.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou and other two provinces, Sichuan and Hubei, have been
designated key regions for the development of ecological tourism
by China National Tourism Administration.
</P>
<P>
And the Ministry of Finance has decided to allocate 30 million
yuan for development of ecological tourism in Guizhou during the
next three years.

<HEADLINE> China to Formulate Strategy of Invigorating Marine Industry (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
As mankind is now facing rapid population growth, shortages of
resources and a deteriorating environment, the development of
marine resources is considered worldwide as an important way to
speed up economic growth.
</P>
<P>
According to experts, China's sea areas have 20,000 species of
marine life. China has an estimated 13 million hectares of
offshore areas with a water depth of up to 20 meters, and 2.1
million hectares of polders, where aquatic products farms can be
built.
</P>
<P>
According to government plans, aquatic product pilot centers
will be built in the Bohai Bay, Laizhou Bay, Liaodong Bay, the
Development Zone in the Yangtze River Estuary and Hangzhou Bay,
the coastal development zone in eastern Fujian Province, the Pearl
River Estuary Development Zone and the Beibu Bay Development Zone.
</P>
<P>
By adopting marine biological techniques and efficient aquatic
product breeding techniques, the centers will try to increase
production of fine species of fish, shrimps, oysters and scallops.
</P>
<P>
Scientists will also concentrate on developing marine products
with a high added value, marine pharmaceuticals, products made
from the waste of aquatic products and marine fine chemicals.
</P>
<P>
Technical preparations for developing deep-sea mineral
resources are under way, said the official of the oceanography
bureau.
</P>
<P>
Coastal cities in China all face the problem of fresh water
shortages, he said, noting that the desalination and direct use of
sea water is a pressing task.
</P>
<P>
Over the next few years, scientists will help Tianjin, a city
with a population of 9.6 million, desalinate and directly use sea
water, the official said.
</P>
<P>
Tianjin's experience will be spread to other coastal cities, he
added.
</P>
<P>
China currently has 100 marine research institutes, employing
30,000 scientists and researchers. A number of regional marine
technique transfer centers will be set up over the next five
years.

SHENYANG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The collectively-owned
economic sector is playing a principal role in China's rural
economic development, Wan Baorui, vice-minister of Agriculture,
said at a recent meeting in Shenyang.
</P>
<P>
The collectively-owned economic sector in China's rural areas
generated a combined revenue of over three trillion yuan in 1995,
five times the 1990 figure.

The ratio of revenue yielded by rural collectively-owned firms
in the country's total rural earnings has risen from 41 percent in
1990 to present 52 percent.
</P>
<P>
Officials from the the Ministry of Agriculture attributed the
success to the implementation of a household contract
responsibility system, which links remuneration with output, and a
dual system which combines unified management with independent
management.
</P>
<P>
More than half of the villages in China now have renewable
household contracts, which proved to be an effective operation.

BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese government
departments are formulating a strategy to invigorate the marine
industry by means of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
The strategy represents the efforts of the Chinese government
to step up development of marine resources over the next five
years.
</P>
<P>
The departments include the State Science and Technology
Commission, the State Planning Commission and the National Bureau
of Oceanography. The program for invigorating the marine industry
by means of science and technology is nearly complete.
</P>
<P>
An official at the oceanography bureau said that in the course
of invigorating the marine industry, the Chinese government will
take a series of measures including the use of hi-tech research
findings.
</P>
<P>
The official said that at the turn of the century, great
progress is expected to be made in the breeding of aquatic
products in offshore areas, the development of marine biological,
pharmaceutical and chemical resources, and the desalination and
direct use of sea water.
</P>
<P>
"China has made much headway in accelerating the growth of the
marine industry over the past few years," he said.
</P>
<P>
The industry's production value came to 220 billion yuan in
1995. Economists estimated that by implementing the strategy of
invigorating the marine industry, the industry's production value
is expected to rise at an annual rate of 11 to 15 percent during
the 1996-2000 period.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China is working hard for
continued boom of its tourism industry and, for the next five
years, the country is targeting an annual growth rate of three to
four percent in its overseas tourist arrivals.
</P>
<P>
The number of tourists from overseas, including those from Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan, is expected to reach 54.5 to 55 million by
the year 2000, the China National Tourism Administration (CNTA)
told Xinhua.
</P>
<P>
With an annual average growth of ten to 12 percent, the
turnovers from international tourists is expected to hit 14
billion US dollars by then.
</P>
<P>
This and an additional 250 to 260 billion yuan in internal
tourist incomes will account for five percent of China's GDP, He
Guangwei, chairman of CNTA, said. "By the year 2000, the tourism
industry will have become a spectacular sector of the national
economy."
</P>
<P>
He expects the tourism industry's share in China's GDP to grow
eight percent by the year 2010. "By then, China should have built
up a tourism industry rated as one of the best in the world, with
an annual inflow of 64 to 70 million overseas arrivals and an
annual tourism revenue of 38 to 43 billion US dollars in hard
currency, plus 1,000 to 1050 billion yuan in incomes generated by
domestic tours," he said.
</P>
<P>
To fulfill the target, China is now going all out to upgrade
tourist facilities, improve services, diversify product structure,
repackage traditional products and offer new ones.
</P>
<P>
Special efforts are being made to improve tourist facilities in
the central and northwestern regions. Investments are put into the
construction of hotels and upgrading of the transportation and
communications along the "Silk Route," one of the most appealing
tourist attractions in northwest China. Despite their abundant
tourist resources, these regions have been handicapped in tourist
industry because of poor and inadequate facilities.
</P>
<P>
According to CNTA, China will build some 100 new hotels yearly
between 1996 to 2000 to cope with the demand of increasing
tourists. A total of 3,720 hotels with 486,000 rooms geared to
overseas tourists were in operation by the end 1995. Of them,
1,913 hotels are star-rated. In contrast, only 203 hotels were
available to international tourists in 1980.
</P>
<P>
The Revised Regulations on the Administration of Tourist
Agencies, soon to be issued by the State Council, is one of the
measures China is taking to improve its service up to the
international standards.
</P>
<P>
It will oblige the travel agencies to deposit an amount of
honest money with CNTA or local tourism authorities as a
commitment to the quality of their services. Tourists will be
compensated with the money in case they are proved victimized by
sub-standard services.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Troops Kill 2 Palestinians in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli troops killed two
Palestinians in clashes with Palestinian police in Gaza, reports
reaching here said today.
</P>
<P>
According to the reports, the Palestinian police and Israeli
forces battled each other with automatic gun fire as thousands of
Palestinian stone-throwers surrounded two isolated Jewish
settlements in the Gaza Strip in protest against the Israeli
killing of seven Palestinians in the West Bank Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Tension was high Wednesday in the West Bank town of Ramallah,
16 kilometers north of Jerusalem, where the Israeli soldiers
killed the seven Palestinian demonstrators protesting against
Israel's digging of a tunnel near the al-Aqsa Mosque, the third
holiest shrine of the Moslems across the world.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinian Authority (PA) has declared a day of mourning
today for those killed and wounded by Israeli soldiers in
Ramallah. The announcement was made in a statement issued in Gaza
Wednesday night. The PA also called for a general strike from
eight to 10 O'clock this morning.
</P>
<P>
Apart from the seven killed, more than 300 Palestinians were
wounded in the shooting, in which Israeli soliders exchanged fire
with Palestinian police in the bloodiest clashes in the West Bank
since the PLO began its self-rule two years ago.
</P>
<P>
The PA called on residents throughout Palestinian territories,
including East Jerusalem, to express their anger over what
happened Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
It also told the Palestinian security forces to be ready to
defend their people and land.
</P>
<P>
The statement was signed by eight Palestinian organizations.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's massive protest was ignited by Israel's opening of
a tunnel by the site of Temple Mount in the Old City of
Jerusalem. Palestinians charged that it would undermine the
Moslem holy sites on Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Palestinians demanded that a commission of inquiry
be formed to look into what had happened in the clash.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian Minister of Civil Affairs Jamil Tarifi said that
a court of martial should investigate who ordered the Israeli
soldiers to open fire.
</P>
<P>
Tarifi, who is responsible for negotiating with Israel on
civil affairs, described the shooting as a crime and warned that
talks with Israel could be resumed only after a trial takes
place.

On-job training for tour guides is another measure taken to
improve service. By the year 2000, all tour guides will have
undergone such training to qualify for work, according to a CNTA
plan. Nobody will be allowed to work as a tour guide without the
qualification certificate issued by the tourist authorities.
</P>
<P>
Efforts have also been made to diversify tourist product
structure, which used to be dominated by sightseeing tours in the
past decades. While a wide range of tourist products highlighting
the essence of the country's natural sceneries, cultural heritage,
folk customs are now available to tourists, vacationists,
adventurists and other types of travelers.
</P>
<P>
"We may need to further diversify out products to satisfy
tourists of varying interest, but at least we've become able to
offer our guests more than sightseeing tours," says the CNTA
chairman.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China handled a total of 43.38 million overseas
tourist arrivals, more than eight times the 1980 figure of 5.07
million.
</P>
<P>
With an earning of 8.7 billion US dollars in tourism turnover
last year, which accounted for five percent of the country's total
export revenue of the year, China now ranks ninth in the world in
terms of tourism dollars. But ten years ago, it took the 24th
place.
</P>
<P>
Nowadays, local pedlars even in remote scenic spots of Xinjiang
and Tibet can make deals with foreign visitors in their simple but
understandable English. Nevertheless, 20 years ago, a blond
tourist from a Western country could draw crowds of Chinese
onlookers even in such leading cities as Beijing and Shanghai, as
if he or she were from another planet.

<HEADLINE> Peres Blames Israeli Government for Riots </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Israeli former Prime
Minister Shimon Peres Wednesday night blamed the government for
the riots in the West Bank, saying Israel is "now at a
bad precipice, facing a very dangerous situation."
</P>
<P>
Peres' comment came after thousands of Palestinians Wednesday
vented their rage over the opening of the Hasmonean Tunnel in
Jerusalem's Old City.
</P>
<P>
Seven Palestinians, including three policemen and a
15-year-old boy, were killed and over 300 Palestinians and seven
Israeli soldiers were wounded during Wednesday's clashes between
Israeli soldiers and Palestinian police in the West Bank town of
Ramallah, 16 kilometers north of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Peres rejected the current government's charge that it was his
government that had decided on the opening of the tunnel, which
went just beside the Temple Mount.
</P>
<P>
Peres said: "I would have tried to talk with the Palestinians
before making any sensitive move."
</P>
<P>
Peres claimed that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and his
government provided the "pretext for the violence".
</P>
<P>
Peres, one of the architects of the Middle East peace
process, also said that those in the Likud Party who spoke of
"peace for peace, now realize that there is no peace for no
peace."
</P>
<P>
He charged that Netanyahu, the first directly elected Israeli
prime minister, had made no progress in the peace process during
his first 100 days in office following his victory in the May 29
general elections.
</P>
<P>
Peres added that "the agreement with the Palestinians is
good, but it must be implemented."
</P>
<P>
During an interview with Israel Television, Peres, Chairman
of the Labor Party, also warned that Israel's relations with Egypt
and Jordan are deteriorating dangerously and the day is not far
off when this will be the case with Europe too.

<HEADLINE> Family Planning Theater in Biyang County </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A theater, specializing in
promoting family planning, has become a popular recreation place
for farmers in Biyang county in central China's Henan Province.
</P>
<P>
The so-called "Family Planning Theater", the first in the
country, has staged 1,300 programs and attracted more than 30,000
local farmers in the Yangjiaji town in the past three years.
</P>
<P>
During rainy weather, or during their spare time, local farmers
swarm to the theater to watch programs on birth control and on
scientific training.
</P>
<P>
The theater was initiated in 1993 when a local family planning
office invested 20,000 yuan (about 2,410 US dollars) to renovate a
deserted theater.
</P>
<P>
Since then, many birth control programs have been staged by
professional and amateur performers.
</P>
<P>
Most of the programs are centered on local events and this has
served to be more appealing to the audience.
</P>
<P>
Birth control is a state policy in China, which has a
population of 1.2 billion, the largest in the world. The country's
800-plus million farmers are the top target group.

<HEADLINE> Central Part of SDH System Passed Final Test </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The core part of an advanced
microwave telecommunications system developed by Chinese
scientists has passed its final test.
</P>
<P>
The successful test in Xi'an, capital of Shaanxi Province,
signals a breakthrough in the country's telecommunications
research.
</P>
<P>
According to "People's Posts and Telecommunications News", the
SDH (synchronous digital hierarchy) system, with a transmission
speed as high as 155 MB per second, is manufactured by a research
institute under the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The system can help to raise the transmission speed of both
public telecom networks and speciality microwave trunks.
</P>
<P>
China's industrial analysts said the system represents a major
step forward in the localization drive of SDH technology, which
can be widely used in many kinds of information arteries, and is
taken as a priority task in the ministry's five-year development
program.
</P>
<P>
The technical breakthrough will give rise to the hi-tech
development of domestic telecommunications enterprises, as the
whole industry becomes more determined to challenge the dominance
of foreign telecom powers.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that over past several years, China's
telecommunications sector maintained an annual growth rate between
of 30 to 40 percent, a figure far higher than the average in the
global market.

BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China's Barcelona Olympic
champion shooter Wang Yifu, who has been suffering a damaged
cervical vertebra which was believed to have cost him the gold
medal at the Atlanta Games, was discharged from the hospital on
Thursday.
</P>
<P>
The four-time Olympian collapsed after his last shot in the
Atlanta Games which squandered a 3.8-point lead. The medal was
won by Italian Roberto Di Donna.
</P>
<P>
Wang blamed his disastrous last shot to blackout caused by the
injury and doctors agreed with him after diagnosis.
</P>
<P>
"Wang has been suffering a very serious injury to his cervical
vertebra and it was caused by years of shooting, the sport
requiring the head to turn to one side," said Zhang Yunzeng, the
vice-president of the Chinese Armed Force Hospital which treated
the 36-year-old shooter.
</P>
<P>
"The injured vertebra pressured the arteries and slowed the
blood supply to Wang's head," Zhang said. "After a month of
treatment, Wang has got better, but I can hardly promise I can
heal him of the injury."
</P>
<P>
Wang has won the Olympic, world and World Cup titles in his
20-year-long career.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Net Users Fear Being Charged For Accessing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Internet surfers in
Singapore are concerned about being caught and fined for visiting
pornographic sites on the Internet, after a man was fined here on
Monday for having obtained pornographic material via the Internet.
</P>
<P>
According to the Straits Times today, Internet users' concern
came after 41-year-old Lai Chee Chuen was convicted on Monday for
downloading obscene films from the Internet in the first case of
its kind here.
</P>
<P>
Reflecting concerns expressed by many of the Internet users
interviewed, the Straits Times report quoted businessman David
Lee, 34, as asking: "What if I just access a pornographic site
accidentally?"
</P>
<P>
He has been using the Internet for over a year. He asked: "What
if I don't download any information from the site; can I be
charged for just accessing it?"
</P>
<P>
Other users were also unclear whether they would run foul of
the law for downloading pornographic pictures and graphics, rather
than films.
</P>
<P>
Net surfer Shirlyn Khoo, 25, a sales executive, asked: "So,
does this mean that someone can be charged with obtaining blue
films from the Internet, but not with obtaining sexy photo from
it?"
</P>
<P>
The Straits Times said that the Attorney-General's Chambers
said it was working on answers to some of these questions, but
they were not immediately available.
</P>
<P>
Assistant Superintendent of Police Ann Ho Lay Choo, who heads
the Financial Fraud Branch of the Commercial Crime Department, was
quoted as saying that the police do not have a special unit
dealing with Internet-derived pornography. Ho, who led the team in
Lai's case, added that there were no plans to set up such a unit.
</P>
<P>
However, the Singapore Broadcasting Association made its
position clear: the same pornography laws apply to Net surfers as
to all citizens. Under the Films Act, it is a crime to possess,
distribute or exhibit obscene films.
</P>
<P>
Deputy Public Prosecutor Lim Pek Bur said earlier that Lai Chee
Chuen was charged under the Films Act because changes have yet to
be made to the Computer Misuse Act to allow offenses of this kind
to be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
In the current situation, the term "film" was defined broadly
enough to include any sequence of visual images, thus allowing the
short visual images which Lai had downloaded into his hard disk to
be called films.

<HEADLINE> New China at 47  (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China has found a way for a
rapid, sustained national economic and social development over the
past 47 years since the People's Republic was founded on October
1, 1949.
</P>
<P>
Internationally, new China has emerged as a strong power in the
world, pursuing an independent foreign policy of peace, and
playing an important role in the world political arena in its
capacity as a permanent member of the United Nations Security
Council.
</P>
<P>
The country abolished all unequal treaties imposed by foreign
powers on the old China, doing away with social inequalities that
came with colonialism.
</P>
<P>
On July 1, 1997, nine months after this year's national day
celebrations, Hong Kong, seized from old China during the Opium
War, will return to the embrace of the motherland from British
rule.
</P>
<P>
China will also recover its sovereignty over Macao in 1999 from
Portuguese rule, heralding the end of the last vestige of colonial
rule in China.
</P>
<P>
Economically, its fast but sustained speed of growth since its
adoption of reform and open policies has drawn world attention. In
the last five years, its gross national product (GNP) registered
an annual growth of 12 percent, reaching 5,760 billion yuan last
year (8.3 yuan to the U.S. dollar), more than quadrupling the 1980
figure.
</P>
<P>
In agriculture, China has fed its 1.2 billion population, about
22 percent of the world's total, by farming only seven percent of
the world's cultivated land. In 1995, it produced 465 million tons
of food grain, a moderate 4.2 percent rise over five years ago,
but edible vegetable oil jumped by 38 percent to 22.5 million
tons; meat, by 74 percent to 50 million tons, and aquatic
products, by 94 percent to 25.38 million tons.
</P>
<P>
In 1995, China produced 94 million tons of steel, 1.3 billion
tons of coal, 149 million tons of crude oil, 1,000 billion kwh of
electricity, 24.5 million tons of chemical fertilizers (in terms
of 100 percent purity), 2.9 million tons of chemical fibers and
19.58 million color television sets. The statistics have elevated
China to the ranks of industrial giants of the world.
</P>
<P>
However, in terms of per-capita amounts, it still lags far
behind the developed countries.

<HEADLINE> Israel Imposes Curfew on Palestinian Territories </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Israel has imposed a full
curfew on the Palestinian territories after Wednesday's bloody
confrontation between Palestinian protesters and Israeli
soldiers, which killed at least seven Palestinians and wounded
300 others.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made at a meeting of senior Israeli security
officials called Wednesday night by Defense Minister Yitzhak
Mordechai in an effort to calm the worsening tension between
Israel and the Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, hundreds of policemen and soldiers are put on high
alert in East Jerusalem today in anticipation of more protests
or possible violence after eight ministers of the Palestinian
National Authority (PNA) called for a two-hour strike to protest
Israel's suppression.
</P>
<P>
Mordechai, Israeli Army Chief of Staff Amonon Shahak and
Central Command Head Uzi Dayan reportedly held a meeting earlier
Wednesday with Palestinian security officials to discuss ways to
cool the situation.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Mordechai and Shahak telephoned PNA
President Yasser Arafat. Both sides agreed to work to calm the
situation and investigate Wednesday's bloody clashes between
Israeli soldiers and Palestinians protesters in the West Bank town
of Ramallah, 16 kilometers north of Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Arafat, who strongly denounced the violence, promised that he
would call for restraint among his top commanders to avoid further
bloodshed on the assumption that Israel would do the same.
</P>
<P>
Wednesday's riots took place after Palestinians in the
territories and East Jerusalem held widespread demonstrations to
protest Israel's decision to open an underground tunnel along the
Al Aqsa Mosque in East Jerusalem, which the Palestinians regarded
as a plot by Israelis to undermine Moslem holy places.
</P>
<P>
As Israeli soldiers entered the area under PNA control in
Ramallah to catch stone-throwing protesters, they exchanged fires
with Palestinian security forces.
</P>
<P>
Latest figures put the Palestinian toll at seven, including at
least three policemen. Over 300 Palestinians were wounded by live
ammunition, rubber bullets and tear gas. Israeli side said that 12
soldiers were wounded in the clashes.
</P>
<P>
However, Shahak denied Israeli soldiers had entered the area
controlled by the PNA, adding that they would do so if necessary. He
denounced the riots as pre-planned by the Palestinians in a bid
to put pressure on the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
Dayan also tried to put the blame of the bloodshed on the
Palestinians, charging it was the Palestinians who started the
shooting that prompted return of fire by Israeli soldiers.
</P>
<P>
The bloody confrontation was the worst since Israel and
Palestinians made peace in 1993, and dealt a severe blow to the
already difficult relations between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
Israeli-Palestinian peace talks have in fact made no real
progress after Israeli hardline Likud government came to power
in June. Israel's provocative policies to expand Jewish
settlements and crack down on PNA activities in Jerusalem have
fueled increasing anger and dissent among the Palestinians.

<HEADLINE> State-Owned Coal Mines in Shandong Improves Efficiency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- State-owned coal mines in east
China's Shandong Province have been improving efficiency by
promoting a diversified economy.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials the coal mines have been more
efficient and boosted their earnings since 1993.
</P>
<P>
Until the efficiency drive the units were big money losers,
because of redundant workers and stockpiling of products.
</P>
<P>
In the first eight months this year, the mines generated 330
million yuan in profits, more than the earnings for the whole 1995.
</P>
<P>
Shandong has eight major state-owned coal mines, which used to
be confined to just the production of coal. They suffered losses
in successive years as a result of overmanning in coal
production, and a serious stockpiling of products.
</P>
<P>
When the central government decided, three years ago, to lift
price ceilings for coal, and to let mines become market-oriented,
the mining departments seized the opportunities and vigorously
expanded diversified economies, while maintaining coal production.
</P>
<P>
The mining administrations started to fix coal production
scales according to marketing results, and set the numbers of
workers needed according to production levels.
</P>
<P>
Over the past three years, 40,000 workers have been channeled
from front coal production lines to diversified economic
activities.
</P>
<P>
The practice has proved effective. All the mining
administrations have shown high economic efficiency and six of
them have been cited by the Ministry of Coal Industry as "high
output and high efficiency" coal mines.
</P>
<P>
State-owned coal mines in the province have invested a combined
total of 1.513 billion yuan to expand diversified economies, and
are now capable of producing 1,700 kinds of commodities besides
coal.
</P>
<P>
Some 140,000 workers, or 44 percent of the province's total
coal mining manpower, are engaged in diversified economic
activities.
</P>
<P>
Last year the mining administrations realized 4.42 billion yuan
from coal production and diversified economic activities, creating
210 million yuan in profits and taxes.
</P>
<P>
They also saw increases in profits and taxes created in the
first eight months compared with corresponding figures for same
period last year.

JERUSALEM, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Palestinian Authority
(PA) has declared a day of mourning today for those killed and
wounded by Israeli soldiers in Ramallah, the West Bank, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
The announcement was made in a statement issued in Gaza Wednesday
night. The PA also called for a general strike from eight to 10 O'clock
this morning.
</P>
<P>
A total of seven Palestinians, including three policemen, were
killed and more than 300 wounded in the shooting, in which Israeli
soliders exchanged fire with Palestinian police Wednesday in the

</P>
<P>
It also told the Palestinian security forces to be ready to

</P>
<P>
The statement was signed by eight Palestinian organizations.

<HEADLINE> CBI Expected to Oppose Rao's Bail Plea </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Central Bureau of
Investigation (CBI) is set to oppose former prime minister P.V.
Narasimha Rao's anticipatory bail plea today in a 100,000 dollar
cheating case, according to CBI sources.
</P>
<P>
Rao made an appeal to the Delhi High Court Wednesday for
anticipatory bail fearing arrest in the cheating case.
</P>
<P>
In his plea, Rao said that as the other two accused people,
godman Chandraswasmi and his associate Mamaji, were put into jail
and their bails have been rejected time and again, he feared
arrest when he appears before the court.
</P>
<P>
Justice S.K. Mahajan has fixed the hearing of Rao's plea for
Thursday and issued a notice to the CBI on the application.
</P>
<P>
The decision to oppose the bail plea in the high court was
taken on Wednesday evening after the CBI received Justice
Mahajan's notice on why Rao should not be granted the bail, the
CBI sources said.
</P>
<P>
The CBI sources, however, declined to give the reason for the
CBI's decision to oppose Rao's bail.
</P>
<P>
Rao has been summoned by Judge Ajit Bharihoke to appear before
the court on September 30 in connection with the cheating case.
</P>
<P>
The Britain-based non-resident Indian businessman, Lakhubhai
Pathak, alleged in his testimony before a trial court that he was
duped of 100,000 US dollars by godman Chandraswasmi and his
associate Mamaji on the false promise of securing him newsprint
and paper pulp contracts in India.
</P>
<P>
He says he paid the money on the basis of an assurance given to
him by Rao, the then external affairs minister.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Major Parties May Not Win Majority in Election </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Neither of Japan's two largest
political parties are likely to seize a simple majority in a
forthcoming race for the 500 seats of House of Representatives
next month, the Kyodo News Service reported today.
</P>
<P>
Political analysts predicted neither the Liberal Democratic
Party (LDP), the major ruling coalition party, nor the New
Frontier Party (NFP), the main opposition party, could achieve a
251-seat majority in the general election possibly to be called on
October 20.
</P>
<P>
The election will be the first in three years and three months,
and will also be the first under the new voting formula combining
300 single-seat constituencies and 200 proportional representation
seats, the report said.
</P>
<P>
The current 511-member house was elected under a multi-seat
constituency system.
</P>
<P>
Kyodo said Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto, president of the
LDP, was likely to dissolve the lower house at an extraordinary
Diet (parliament) session on Friday for an early election.
</P>
<P>
Analysts said the LDP would have easy running in farm areas
that used to be its strongholds, but face hard times in urban
areas due to the ruling coalition's decision to raise the
consumption tax next April.
</P>
<P>
The LDP wants to maintain its current tripartite coalition with
the Social Democratic Party (SDP) and New Party Sakigake after the
election if the three parties secure a combined majority, Kyodo
said.
</P>
<P>
The LDP is also seeking the feasibility of alliance with the
soon-to-be-launched Democratic Party of Japan (DPJ), which will be
set up by New Party Sakigake breakaway Yukio Hatoyama and Health
and Welfare Minister Naoto Kan. Many SDP and Sakigake candidates
are joining the DPJ.
</P>
<P>
The NFP, formed by nine parties in December 1994, is faring
well in urban areas, but will confront strong competition from the
DPJ and another opposition party, the Japanese Communist Party
(JCP), analysts say.
</P>
<P>
The SDP and Sakigake, the two smaller coalition partners, are
expected to face tough times because of their declining appeal to
voters and the decrease of members, Kyodo said.

NEW DELHI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Two people have died of the
suspected Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) in the Indian capital of
New Delhi in the past 24 hours, bringing the death toll to 32,
hospital sources said today.
</P>
<P>
Over 300 people have been affected with the dengue fever since

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Women Eager to Work </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai women laid off from
work have given the thumbs down to returning to lives as full-time
housewives.
</P>
<P>
Some 85 percent are eager to find jobs again, a new survey has
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Currently over 240,000 people in Shanghai have lost their jobs
because of the adjustment of industrial structure, with women
representing 55 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
The survey, conducted by the women's federation in China's
largest city, showed that many women now look for stable careers
rather than high incomes, a great change compared with several
years ago.
</P>
<P>
Most women are anxious to find jobs again, rather than stay at
home and do housework all day long, because of economic reasons.
</P>
<P>
Over 57 percent of the women said that they have looked for
jobs by themselves. Only three percent of them felt embarrassed
seeking job interviews.
</P>
<P>
And only six percent of the laid-off women were afraid of
being 'looked down upon' by others.
</P>
<P>
The major problems for the women are that they are too old for
some jobs, and are not professionals, or have little education.
</P>
<P>
Laid-off women hoped to receive training in sales techniques,
financial accounting, cooking and sewing.

<HEADLINE> New Freeway to Accelerate Economic Expansion </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NANJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The newly-opened
Shanghai-Nanjing Freeway is expected to accelerate economic
expansion in the Yangtze River Delta, one of the most developed
areas in China.
</P>
<P>
At the southern end of the lower reaches of the Yangtze River,
the 247-kilometer-long expressway connects the six major cities of
Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang and Nanjing in the
area.
</P>
<P>
The area along the Shanghai-Nanjing line has one of the highest
densities of industrial cities, population, and the most developed
economies in China, and traffic congestion has long been an
obstacle for further economic development.
</P>
<P>
Before the construction of the expressway, there was only one
major road connecting the cities, the 312 national highway. It
takes ten hours to travel the 386-km section between the two
cities.
</P>
<P>
In contrast, a car traveling on the Shanghai-Nanjing Freeway,
whose designed speed is 120 km per hour, takes only three hours.
</P>
<P>
Experts from the World Bank predict that an average of 30,000
motor vehicles will travel on the expressway each day by the year
2000.
</P>
<P>
And the industrial and agricultural output values in the six
cities along the expressway will grow at an annual average of 25
percent, thanks to improved transportation.
</P>
<P>
New development zones are being built along the
Shanghai-Nanjing Freeway. Four of Changzhou's ten development
zones are located close to major junctions on the expressway, and
Xishan City is readjusting its programs for road construction,
farmland cultivation, water conservation layout, and urban and
suburban planning in accordance with the direction and scope of
the expressway.
</P>
<P>
Huang Zhendong, the Minister of Communications, called the
Shanghai-Nanjing Freeway a lifeline for future economic expansion
in Shanghai and southern Jiangsu. It is expected to increase ties
between Shanghai and southern Jiangsu, and to promote development
of the Yangtze River economic belt.

<HEADLINE> EU Countries Mapping Out Tightened Economic Policies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- European Union member states
are working out austerity policies to meet the standards set for
an economic and monetary union including a single currency.
</P>
<P>
Jacques Santer, president of the Commission of the European
Union, said most of the EU member countries are carrying out
austerity policies, speeding up their drive for the monetary union.
</P>
<P>
Germany and France, the initiators of the single currency
system and often regarded as "engines" for the EU, have bent over
backwards to meet all the requirements by the Maastricht Treaty
approved in December 1991 and put into effect on November 1, 1993.
</P>
<P>
During their talks early this month, French President Jacques
Chirac and German Federal Chancellor Helmut Kohl expressed their
determination to meet the treaty guidelines so that they will be
among the first countries to join the economic union.
</P>
<P>
The treaty aims to promote economic and social progress which
is balanced and sustainable, in particular through the creation of
an area without internal frontiers, through the strengthening of
economic and social cohesion and through the establishment of
economic and monetary union, ultimately including a single
currency in accordance with the provisions of the treaty.
</P>
<P>
The economic standards set in the treaty include a deficit rate
below 3 percent of the gross domestic product, a national debt
below 60 percent of the GDP, an inflation rate that should be kept
no higher than 1.5 percent of the average rate of the three member
states which have the lowest consumer prices, and a long-term
interest rate that is no higher than 2 percent of the average of
the three member states which have the lowest interest rate.
</P>
<P>
France has met the requirement in its debt standard with the
national debt taking up 56.1 percent of the GDP, but its 4.2
percent deficit leaves much to be done to meet the 3 percent
Maastricht Treaty bottom line.
</P>
<P>
The French government has drawn a lesson from its 1996 fiscal
year budget which triggered a series of strikes after a budget cut
in its social welfare and is trying to cut down its budget deficit
to 3 percent by means of tax reforms.
</P>
<P>
Germany, with a 3.9 percent deficit rate and a national debt at
61.5 percent of the GDP, is planning to cut its administration
spending by 70 billion German marks (47 billion dollars) in the
coming fiscal year.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is aiming at a 2.2 percent deficit rate in
1997, which is 1.3 percent lower than the 1996 rate, and a
reduction in the debt rate from 79.4 percent this year to 76.2
percent next year.
</P>
<P>
Of the 15 EU member states, only three countries, namely,
Luxembourg, Denmark and Ireland, have so far met the deficit
criteria set by the Maastricht Treaty.
</P>
<P>
Santer however expected a quite number of EU member states to
be able to join the economic and monetary union from the very
start.

<HEADLINE> S'pore Ruling PAP Unveils New Faces for General </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The ruling People's Action
Party (PAP) of Singapore has unveiled the first three of the more
than 20 new candidates the party will be fielding in the coming
general election, the date of which is yet to be announced.
</P>
<P>
According to reports of today's Straits Times, Deputy Prime
Minister and PAP's First Assistant Secretary General Lee Hsien
Loong said on Wednesday, "It has been a good harvest. The quality
of the candidates has been high, we have got a strong team".
</P>
<P>
"This is the team which compares favorably not only against the
opposition, which is not saying very much, but even against
previous PAP teams in previous elections, which is saying a great
deal," he said.
</P>
<P>
The first three PAP new candidates introduced by Lee were the
company managing director Ahmad Magad, 43, former editor of a
Chinese newspaper Seng Han Thong, 46 and lawyer Ong Kian Min, 36.
</P>
<P>
Lee said the 20 or so new faces were picked from about 300
people the party had interviewed since the 1991 general election.
He described the new candidates as people of proven ability, good
character and with leadership qualities.
</P>
<P>
The PAP had found only one woman candidate so far and was still
searching for more, the Straits Times reports said.
</P>
<P>
Asked about the PAP's expectation at the general election, due
by April next year, Lee said, "We have a good slate, we expect to
win, we expect to win well".

<HEADLINE> China Dismisses 3,311 Civil Servants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- More than 3,300 civil
servants have been dismissed from China's administrative organs,
according to a recent survey.
</P>
<P>
Sources claim that most of them were fired for violations of
discipline. In 1990 a pilot dismissal system was initiated in some
regions and departments in China.
</P>
<P>
Various government bodies in Shenyang, capital of northeast
China's Liaoning Province which took the lead in the system, had
dismissed 163 civil servants by the end of 1994, constituting four
in every 1,000.
</P>
<P>
At a national conference on the dismissal system in July 1995,
the Ministry of Personnel noted that the civil servant system
would be implemented nationwide within one or two years. It also
issued a temporary regulation on the dismissal system.
</P>
<P>
This year, the ministry made public another regulation covering
dismissal in a bid to perfect the system.
</P>
<P>
Under former practices government officials, or civil servants,
were given lifetime employment in administrative bodies.
</P>
<P>
At present, some cities in China have started to recruit their
civil servants through public applications and exams.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Underground water in
water-staved Beijing has risen by over a meter, according to the
latest water survey.
</P>
<P>
The survey shows that the continuous downpours in the past
three months have ensured the city's water supply for at least two
years.
</P>
<P>
The local water resources bureau has strived to improve
management of land surface water and underground water. It has
switched some reservoir water underground, making the underground
water rise in a large step, according to the Beijing Daily.
</P>
<P>
Experts say this move has brought about relief to local scarce
water resources.
</P>
<P>
Rainfall in Beijing is 28.9 percent up over the same 1995
period because of the heavy downpours since June, with rainfall
rising to 611 millimeters in the past three and half months.
</P>
<P>
As much as 3.89 billion cubic meters of water have been stored
in 16 large reservoirs around the city, an increase of 350 million
cubic meters over 1995.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that the underground water in the local plains
was 10.79 meters under the ground by the end of August, with the
water level 1.03 meters higher than that of the same month last
year.
</P>
<P>
Among China's 600-plus cities, almost half of them are short of
water.

<HEADLINE> China Takes New Steps to Boost Foreign Investment in Coal Sector </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China's Ministry of Coal
Industry has devised more preferential policies to encourage
foreign investment in the country's coal sector.
</P>
<P>
According to a leading official at the ministry, foreign
investors will be given easier access to launching coal projects in
China.
</P>
<P>
China's Ministry of Coal Industry and local governments have
been given new rights to examine and approve foreign-funded coal
projects with total investments beneath 10 million US dollars,
rising to 30 million yuan in special economic zones and other open
cities.
</P>
<P>
In accordance with the new contemporary rules governing foreign
investment, foreign investors are allowed to hold a majority stake
in all coal projects in which they are allowed or encouraged to
invest.
</P>
<P>
The coal ministry will give priority to the construction of
foreign-funded coal projects, and actively arrange the domestic
segments of capital in co-funded coal projects.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the preferential policies granted by the State,
foreign investors can also enjoy preferential policies
worked out by local governments.
</P>
<P>
Local coal enterprises will also be allowed to provide
favorable treatment for the foreign investors in light of relevant
state rules.
</P>
<P>
The official said that the coal ministry will continue its
efforts this year to introduce 300 large-sized coal projects to
foreign investors, with priority given to building pit-head power
plants and coal transport facilities, exploiting coalbed methane
and developing clean coal technology.
</P>
<P>
He stated that coal will remain in the leading position for a
long time in the country's energy resources production and
consumption program.
</P>
<P>
China is expected to turn out 1.29 billion tons of coal this
year and is striving to enhance its annual coal output to 1.45
billion tons by the year 2000.

<HEADLINE> Domestic Cattle Invade Wildlife Reserve in East Nepal </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The massive invasion of
domestic cattle into a wildlife reserve in east Nepal has aroused
concerns over the survival of wild animals there, Nepal wildlife
officers said today.
</P>
<P>
Over 15,000 domesticated buffaloes and other cattle have
intruded into the Koshi Tappu Wildlife Reserve, nearly 200 km
southeast of Kathmandu, causing serious problems to wildlife
protection and reserve management, they said.
</P>
<P>
The domesticated buffaloes have not only put acute pressure on
wild buffaloes's food chain in the reserve but also jeopardized
the carrying capacity of the protected forests and grasslands,
Jagannath Singh, chief officer of the Koshi Reserve, was quoted as
saying by the Rising Nepal newspaper.
</P>
<P>
The domesticated buffaloes obviously outnumber their wild
cousins in the reserve areas, Singh said.
</P>
<P>
The 17,500-hectare Koshi wildlife reserve was established in
1976 specially designated to protect the country's dwindling wild
buffaloes.
</P>
<P>
Cross-breeding between the domestic and wild buffaloes is
another problem raising wildlife experts' concern over genetic
pollution, Singh said.
</P>
<P>
Some of the wild buffaloes have lost their genetic purity while
the domesticated ones become feral as a result of the genetic
pollution, he said.
</P>
<P>
The pressure from the domesticated buffaloes is gradually
ejecting wild buffaloes out of their habitat to raid farmers
living nearby and their crops, a reserve staff worker said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, for the farmers at villages near the reserve,
grazing and keeping their cattle within the protected areas has
become a regular thing.
</P>
<P>
Despite the reserve staff's efforts to reduce the wildlife
movement beyond the reserve boundary and check the entry of
domesticated ones, for example by installing barbed wire fences,
they always failed to deter buffalo keepers from entering.
</P>
<P>
Although reserve officers have the right to shoot the animals
invading the reserve, killing them could bring political troubles,
Singh said.
</P>
<P>
The Koshi reserve, which has a rich biodiversity including
birds, animals and aquatic species, is the only one where wild
buffaloes are found in Nepal.
</P>
<P>
"To protect them, we have to get the domesticated intruders out
of the reserve," he said.

<HEADLINE> Magnetic Medicine Research Institute Set up in Tianjin </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A magnetic medicine research
institute, the first of its kind in China, has been set up in
Tianjin in northern China.
</P>
<P>
The institute is aimed at carrying out more research on the
biological effects of magnetic objects on the human body, as well
as promoting clinical treatments and the production of magnetic
medical devices.
</P>
<P>
Records about magnetic stones able to treat diseases go back as
early as the 2nd century in ancient China.
</P>
<P>
The Compendium of Materia Medica, written by the famous Ming
Dynasty pharmacologist Li Shizhen (1518-1593), also gave detailed
illustrations about the medical functions of magnetic stones.
</P>
<P>
Chinese doctors and scientists have been putting much emphasis
on the study of magnetic medicine. Since 1983, there have been six
national conferences on biological magnetic medicine, and a
magazine "China Biological Magnetism" is published.
</P>
<P>
Modern research on magnetic medicine has been underway for more
than 20 years in Tianjin. In 1978, a group of doctors were
organized to apply magnetic treatment.

<HEADLINE> Rural Economy in Tibet to Benefit more from Spark Program </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LHASA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Tibetan farmers are expected to
benefit more from science and technology as the Spark Program
spreads to the plateau region.
</P>
<P>
The decade-old Spark Program, initiated by the government, is
China's first nationwide plan to encourage economic development in
rural areas with the help of science and technology.
</P>
<P>
A state-level Spark Program intensive area is well under way in
Gyangze County, the only one of its kind in Tibet. It was approved
by the State Science and Technology Commission in May this year.
</P>
<P>
By the end of next year, 15 rural scientific projects will have
been carried out in the area to boost the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Gyangze County sits along the upper reaches of the Nyang River,
boasting flat and fertile land, as well as good transportation and
energy conditions. It is one of the major grain and edible oil
producers in Tibet.
</P>
<P>
With technological, managerial, personnel and financial aid
from the central government and from Shanghai, the project will
bring about considerable benefits to local people, through tapping
local grain, livestock and mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
First-phase construction of the area will take two or three
years, involving a total investment of 200 million yuan (24
million US dollars).
</P>
<P>
During the period, emphasis will be put on improving the area's
infrastructure and upgrading some old enterprises, and
establishing rural product processing plants.
</P>
<P>
By 1998, the total output value of the county's industry and
agriculture is expected to reach 488 million yuan, 3.37 times that
of 1994.
</P>
<P>
Later processing plants which apply high technology to produce
high added-value products will be set up.

<HEADLINE> WFP Food Aid Gets Through to Western Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The World Food Program (WFP)
today finally succeeded in gaining entry to a previously
inaccessible area of the west African state of Liberia, where
thousands of hungry people are struggling for survival.
</P>
<P>
After months of negotiations with rebel factions, the U.N. food
aid agency, along with other U.N. agencies, entered Cape Mount
County in western Liberia with relief food.
</P>
<P>
Liberia has been devastated by a seven-year civil war. The
country suffered a further blow this year when security in the
supposed safe havens of the capital, Monrovia, collapsed as
factional fighters clashed throughout most of April and May.
</P>
<P>
The fighting led most foreign aid agencies to drastically
reduce their staff in Liberia or to pull out of the country
altogether. The last WFP food deliveries to the Cape Mount area
were in December, 1995.
</P>
<P>
The World Food Program is the largest international food aid
organization in the world. Last year, WFP fed more than 50 million
people, including half of the world's refugees and internally
displaced people.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh PM's Executive Authority Formally Approved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bangladeshi Cabinet has
formally approved new rules of business, under which the prime
minister will exercise the executive authority of the state while
ministers will enjoy full authority in running the affairs of
their respective ministries.
</P>
<P>
According to sources today, the approval was made last night at
a special meeting of the cabinet in the light of the 12th
amendment to the constitution under which the country had switched
over to a parliamentary system of governance from the presidential
one in 1991.
</P>
<P>
During the rule of the ex-government of the Bangladesh
Nationalist Party in 1991-1995, a three-member committee was
formed to update the rules of business. The committee prepared a
report on it, but it was not implemented.
</P>
<P>
The approval of the rules is apparently aimed at strengthening
the control of the state power of the present government of the
Awami League led by Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, which was formed
less than 100 days ago by winning the 7th parliamentary elections,
observers here said.
</P>
<P>
The new rules of business will come into effect immediately
after the president of the country signs it, the sources said,
adding that the head of the state is expected to sign the document
sometime next week.

<P>
TOKYO, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of Japan (BOJ) is
considering extending loans to central banks in the Asia-Pacific
region and using their holdings of yen-denominated bonds as
security, the Kyodo news agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
Under the plan, central banks would sell part of their holdings
of yen bonds under a re-purchase agreement allowing them to get
yen funds whenever they need them, Kyodo quoted the Nihon Keizai
Shimbun newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
The plan would help stimulate the global market in yen bonds as
the risk to Asia-Pacific central banks of holding such bonds would
be reduced.
</P>
<P>
The share of foreign currency reserves held by the region's
central banks in yen would also increase as the banks could step
up purchases of yen funds for investment on the yen bond market,
said Kyodo.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- China-United States
relations have been improving due to joint efforts on both sides,
Chinese Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen said here
today.
</P>
<P>
In a joint press conference with U.S. Secretary of State Warren
Christopher before their talks this evening, Qian said positive
progress had been made in bilateral relations.
</P>
<P>
The so called ring-magnet issue and those of intellectual
copyright and the most-favored-nation status, that once obstructed
Sino-U.S. relations, had been resolved one after another,
properly, he added.
</P>
<P>
Qian said exchanges and cooperation between the two countries
in economic, trade and other fields had continuously developed and
expanded. The planned exchange of high level visits had been
gradually implemented.
</P>
<P>
Although there were still some problems and differences between
the two, such as the question of Taiwan, the overall atmosphere
had improved significantly. And there existed favorable conditions
for further improvement, Qian said.
</P>
<P>
He said China was ready to work with the U.S. to increase
dialogue, extend common ground, develop cooperation and remove
barriers and various interferences, with a view to pushing the

For his part, Christopher stressed that the United States was
firmly guided by its firm commitment to the "one China" policy and
the three joint communiques.

<P>
On economic and trade ties, he said the two countries had a
very strong trade relationship. The U.S. would continue to support
China in opening its economy and to enter the World Trade
Organization on commercially acceptable terms.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that it is very important for the leaders of the
two countries to have frequent talks.
</P>
<P>
He said the great intensity of the dialogue between the two
countries recently showed how serious they were in managing their
relations in a constructive way.

OTTAWA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Several big Canadian banks are

The move, led by the Royal Bank of Canada, followed Tuesday's

Further cuts in key interest rates by Canada's central bank and
the prime rate of commercial banks, such as Royal Bank, are also
expected soon, according to local media reports.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Scurvy, a potentially fatal
disease long believed to have been eliminated in developed
nations, has been found in France again.
</P>
<P>
A hospital in Seine-Saint-Denis in Paris said doctors there
have reported 11 cases of scurvy and they believe the number of
patients actually suffering from the disease could be larger.
</P>
<P>
Doctors at the hospital said some of the patients contracted
the disease through malnutrition and the rest were sufferers of
cancer, AIDS and other blood diseases.
</P>
<P>
They said the reappearance of scurvy in France should be
regarded as a social phenomenon as well, because many patients are
poor people who can't afford a healthy and balanced diet.
</P>
<P>
The disease is caused by a deficiency of ascorbic acid (vitamin
C) and symptoms include weakness, anaemia and bleeding from the
mouth and nose.

BRUSSELS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- All 32 people on a pleasure
trip aboard a vintage World War Two plane were killed when the
aircraft crashed off the Dutch coast this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Coast Guard recovered 31 bodies from the sea, and a man
pulled alive from the water with serious injuries died later in
hospital in the northwestern town of Den Helder.
</P>
<P>
The 55-year-old DC-3 Dakota plane, en route to Amsterdam's
Schiphol airport from Texel island went down in Wadden Sea, a
stretch of water between the Dutch west coast and a group of North
Sea islands, about 60 kilometers north of the Dutch capital
Amsterdam at 4.45 p.m.(1445 GMT) after reporting engine trouble.
</P>
<P>
The Dutch Dakota Association (DDA) which operated the plane,
said the passengers were mainly guests of a sponsor of the
association. The DDA is a group of about 4,500 former civilian
and military pilots who bought the DC-3 in 1983 and restored it to
its former glory.
</P>
<P>
It was the only Dakota still flying in the Netherlands, and was
used for pleasure flights and air show displays.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the crash, DDA Chairman Anne Greoeneveld told a
news conference that the plane "was in perfect technical
condition. It was recently checked by the Dutch Aviation
Association."
</P>
<P>
Today's crash came just two months after a C-13 Hercules
transport plane crashed in the southern Dutch city of Eindhoven,
killing 34 passengers and crew.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 10 years, there have been several dozen air
crashes in the Netherlands mainly involving Dutch air force
planes.

<HEADLINE> S. Korean Embassy Spy Upsets U.S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States State
Department today summoned a senior diplomat of the South Korean
Embassy, and told him the U.S. is very disturbed by his naval
attache gathering secret information.
</P>
<P>
Baek Dong-Il, the naval attache at the Washington embassy,
arrived on Oct. 1, 1994 for a three-year term. He will leave soon
for Seoul before the State Department declares him persona no
grata and expels him, said a Justice Department source.
</P>
<P>
The secret information Baek received was allegedly from Robert
Chaegon Kim, 56, who worked at the U.S. Office of Navy
Intelligence, in Maryland.
</P>
<P>
Kim, a native of Seoul, became a U.S. citizen in 1974, and
began working for the Office of Naval Intelligence in 1978. He
worked a computer system that gave him access to top-secret
documents generated by other U.S. intelligence-gathering agencies.
</P>
<P>
He was arrested on Tuesday night at Fort Myer while attending
an Armed Forces Day reception sponsored by the South Korean
Embassy, and charged with spying.
</P>
<P>
A FBI affidavit released in a U.S. District Court said Kim had
handed over classified information, many with "secret" or "top
secret" designations, to Baek Dong-Il.
</P>
<P>
He was also accused of giving South Korea "above top-secret"
documents containing political and military intelligence about the
Democratic People's Republic of Korea and other Asian-Pacific
nations.
</P>
<P>
The FBI said it uncovered Kim's scheme by secretly installing
in his office a video camera which taped him copying and printing
classified records on his computer, and by listening to his phone
conversations and reading his mail.
</P>
<P>
The case against Kim began to move forward on May 5 when the
FBI conducted a court-authorized search of his work computer.
</P>
<P>
On it was found a January 24 letter from Kim to Baek in which
Kim "offered his services to Baek."
</P>
<P>
After the first set of 10 documents were transmitted up to
September 9, Kim was seen allegedly copying and either mailing or
faxing at least 50 additional documents, many of which had
high-level security classifications.
</P>
<P>
Kim could be charged under an espionage statute that carries a
maximum penalty of 10 years in prison, according to a Justice
Department official.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Mike McCurry told reporters that
President Bill Clinton, who was on a campaign trip to
Pennsylvania, was disturbed by the incident but said it was
unlikely to affect U.S.-South Korea ties.
</P>
<P>
Secretary of State Warren Christopher was also reported to be
disturbed by the arrest of the South Korean. He said Washington
had been in touch with South Korean officials over the case.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Suspends Weapon Delivery To Bosnian Federation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SARAJEVO, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States has
suspended the delivery of weaponry to the Bosnian Federation Army
because of its dissatisfaction with the speed of establishing a
joint Muslim-Croat military force.
</P>
<P>
Bosnian Federation Defense Minister Vladimir Soljic told the
Croatian News Agency (HINA) on Wednesday that the establishment of
the joint force was slow as the two sides missed the deadline for
the appointment of its commander and his deputy.
</P>
<P>
"We have the obligation to abolish the Defense Ministry of the
Republic and the Federation and the Defense Ministry of
Herzeg-Bosnia and link them into one ministry," Soljic said.
</P>
<P>
He believed the suspension of U.S. weapon delivery would slow
the implementation of the "Equip and Train" programme, the
U.S. plan to beef up the proposed joint Muslim-Croat army,
according to HINA.

<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- China's State Bureau of
Environment Protection has issued an order requiring all of the
country's 15 kinds of small-sized factories with serious pollution
problems to shut down by September 30. The order is expected to
force the closure of tens of thousands of factories across China.
</P>
<P>
Today's People's Daily cited the order, saying it includes
small paper mills, leather processing, printing and dyeing,
local-method coking plants, gold dressing plants, oil refineries,
farm chemicals, radio-active products factories, electric plating
factories.

<HEADLINE> Indonesia's Foreign Investment Set to Fall </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JAKARTA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia's foreign
investment approvals are likely to drop by 30 percent to 27
billion US dollars this year from 39.9 billion in 1995, a senior
official predicted.
</P>
<P>
State Minister of Investment Sanyoto Sastrowardoyo said here
Wednesday at parliament that the projected sharp drop in the value
of foreign investment approvals this year will not be caused by a
decline in foreign confidence in Indonesia's business climate.
</P>
<P>
"Last year, the value of foreign investment approvals was very
high because eight of the approved projects were very large,"
official sources today quoted the minister as saying.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investment approvals rose by nearly 70 percent to 39.9
billion dollars from 23.72 billion in 1994. Last year's surge was
mainly due to large oil refinery and power generation projects.
</P>
<P>
He said that in the period between January and September 15
this year, foreign investment approvals reached 24.61 billion
dollars.
</P>
<P>
"We are optimistic that the total value will reach 27 billion
US dollars by the end of this year," he added.
</P>
<P>
But domestic investment approvals showed a healthier
performance in the first eight and a half months of this year.
Their value already exceeded last year's total approvals by nearly
20 percent at 82.50 trillion rupiah (one dollar equals 2,320
rupiah), he said.

<HEADLINE> Poland Signs Accord to Import Gas from Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WARSAW, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Poland today signed a 25-year
agreement to import a total of 250 billion cubic meters of gas by
2021 from Russia through a Russia-Poland-Western Europe pipeline.
</P>
<P>
Under the accord, Poland will get some 3 billion cubic meters
of gas annually from 1997. The supply will shoot up to 14 billion
from 2010.
</P>
<P>
Chiefs of the Polish Oil and Gas Industry Company and the
Russian Gas Industry corporation Ltd. -- Aleksander Findziriski
and Rem Vyakhirev -- signed the agreement here.
</P>
<P>
Construction of the pipeline section on Polish territory, about
680 kilometers, started in 1994. That is part of the more than
4,000-kilometers-long gas pipeline from northern Russia's Yamal
peninsula to Germany.
</P>
<P>
Poland paid 15 percent of the cost for the section on its
territory which is planned to be completed in 2010.
</P>
<P>
Poland used to get more than 80 percent of oil and 90 percent
of gas it needed from the Soviet Union.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Lead Democrats in Senate Campaign Fund-raising </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Republicans have almost
twice as much ready cash to offer their Senate candidates as
Democrats do, financial reports show.
</P>
<P>
Entering the crucial final weeks of their election campaign to
defend their congressional majority, the Republican Senate
committee boasted a total of 12.6 million U.S. dollars in cash in
hand, while Senate Democrats had only 7.35 million dollars. Both
committees had debts of under 100,000 dollars.
</P>
<P>
In August, the Republican Party's Senate fund-raising arm
brought in 4.79 million dollars, compared with 2.38 million
dollars raised by the Democrats' Senate committee, according to
reports filed at the Federal Election Commission on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
Republicans have spent 1.25 million dollars so far in Senate
races, taking advantage of a loophole in campaign finance law
allowing unlimited spending on congressional races, so long as the
candidate who is helped gives no guidance or approval.
</P>
<P>
Democrats, who expected to raise 3 million dollars at a
fund-raiser Thursday night, played down the funding gap.
</P>
<P>
"Republicans claim they will retain control of the Senate
because they have the money to back their candidates, but the
truth is their fund-raising is down and there is a growing number
of needy Republican candidates, not all of which the Republicans
are going to bat for," Nebraska Senator Bob Kerrey, chairman of the
Democrat Senatorial Campaign Committee, said in a statement
Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
The Republican committee raised 1.24 million dollars of its
funds last month in what's called "soft money," donations that are
outside contribution limits set by reform laws following the
Watergate scandal in the early 1970s. Corporations and unions,
which aren't allowed to make campaign contributions, can give soft
money.
</P>
<P>
The Democrat Senate committee raised 1.45 million dollars in
soft money in August.

<HEADLINE> Strike fails to Block Traffic in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- A nationwide transport strike
spearheaded by a group of jeepney operators and drivers Wednesday
turned out to be a flop as the traffic situation remained normal
in the country.
</P>
<P>
The strike, which aimed to force a rollback of fuel prices,
failed to meet its target due to the non-participation of larger
organizations like the Federation of Jeepney Operators and Drivers
Associations of the Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Dante Lantin, chairman of the Land Transportation Franchising
and Regulatory Board, said they found through their monitoring
that the transport situation was normal despite the strike.
</P>
<P>
The gasoline prices in the Philippine have risen twice during
the past two months after the government lifted its 20-year-old
control on oil prices last August.
</P>
<P>
The hike triggered widespread opposition from jeepney operators
and drivers. In return, they asked the government to allow them to
raise the transport fare but their demand was refused.
</P>
<P>
Jeepney is a kind of minibus that is popular for wider
operation and lower fare in the Philippines.

<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Central China's Shen Nong Shelf
in Hubei Province has become a homely haven for increasing
families of golden-haired monkeys.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 3,000 monkeys are residing in this 270,000-hectare
mountainous area.
</P>
<P>
Hu Zhenlin, a man who has been making field investigations in
Shen Nong Shelf for many years, said that most of the monkeys
there are adults and their youngsters.
</P>
<P>
In the nature reserve -- Jinhouling natural forest area, more
and more tourists have the chance to see the lovely golden-haired
monkey, thanks to the high level of protection in the area, which
has led to the breeding of more monkeys.
</P>
<P>
Golden-haired monkeys were rarely spotted just 10 years ago
because of the over-felling of trees and illegal hunting in the
area.
</P>
<P>
In a move to protect golden-haired monkeys, as well as other
kinds of wild animals and the natural forest, the Shen Nong Shelf
Nature Reserve was established.
</P>
<P>
In 1988 the head of a group of farmers was sentenced to life
imprisonment for capturing golden-haired monkeys.

<HEADLINE>   Nicaragua Drafts Trafficking Funds Law </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANAGUA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Nicaraguan government is
concerned about the possibility of drug trafficking money being
used to fund campaigns for the October 20 elections.
</P>
<P>
On Monday, the government submitted to the Supreme Court of
Justice a draft law against money laundering. The law would extend
penalties from four to 25 years jail for candidates who received
illicit funds.
</P>
<P>
Vice Interior Minister Frank Cesar said today that the
government was confident the National Assembly (parliament) would
rapidly pass the law against laundering money from drug
trafficking and other connected crimes.
</P>
<P>
There was no evidence of funding political parties in the
country by drug cartels, but the possibility should not be
dismissed, he said.
</P>
<P>
"There is no proof of it, but the possibilities are very
strong, and we must be alert to it."
</P>
<P>
Cesar said that learning from the experiences of Colombia and
Panama, "It should be the candidates themselves who ought to
control their financing committees to prevent illicit funds from
entering their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
"I am making a warning to awaken people about the need for
approving this law to prevent money laundering, for which the
country is completely unprepared," he added.
</P>
<P>
The draft law, with 59 articles, stipulates procedures for
investigation, penalties, protection of witnesses, access to bank
deposits, and the creation of a technical commission to
investigate specific cases.

<HEADLINE> Over 3,000 Foreigners Get Job licenses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Eighty foreigners a day are
applying for permits to work in Shanghai, China's largest city.
</P>
<P>
Among the hundreds of thousands of professionals in Shanghai,
many are foreigners who, like their local colleagues, enjoy
working in the largest metropolis of China.
</P>
<P>
Most foreign workers are employees of local Sino-overseas joint
ventures or solely foreign-owned companies. Their existence has
given the East China city a more international flavor.
</P>
<P>
According to municipal labor departments, over 3,000 foreigners
have been granted official work permits since the city adopted a
licensing system in May.
</P>
<P>
The number of locally employed foreigners and people from Hong
Kong, Macao and Taiwan has now approached 20,000 in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Every day, the labor departments receives nearly 80
applications from expatriates.
</P>
<P>
Shanghai has become an ideal place for overseas job-seekers,
attracted by its fast opening up and economic progress. The large
number of foreign-funded companies in Shanghai has made it
possible for the city to accept more overseas employees.
</P>
<P>
Most of the foreign workers come from the United States, Japan,
the Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and some European
countries. They are working for over 4,000 offices of foreign
companies and over 2,000 Sino-foreign joint ventures.
</P>
<P>
Ninety percent of the foreign nationals are senior managerial
personnel and technicians, who have passed examinations by the local
labor departments.
</P>
<P>
Gu Kunsheng, director of the office for foreign employees under
the municipal labor bureau, said that transnational employment is
one of the important criteria in the economic development of a
country.
</P>
<P>
The growing number of foreign employees in Shanghai shows that
the city's economy has developed rapidly and is gradually linking
up with the world economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
The official noted that the increasing influx of foreigners is
favorable for Shanghai to introduce more funds, equipment and
technology, as well as managerial experience and information and
culture. The move is said to be good for the development of
multi-elementary economic development and culture in Shanghai.

<HEADLINE> Brazilian Army on Alert at Border Area with Colombia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRASILIA, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The Brazilian army announced
today that it has intensified its surveillance of the northern
border with Colombia, following reports of an alleged infiltration
of Colombian guerrillas into Brazilian territory.
</P>
<P>
The Colombian government claimed that the guerrillas
used Brazilian territory as a corridor toward Peru, said the
army's social communication center.
</P>
<P>
Brazilian army units started last week to increase their
vigilance of the northern border, especially across from the
Colombian city of Leticia, the center said.

<HEADLINE> Kris Brenner, Future US Master of Chinese Shadow Boxing (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Kris Brenner believes that
Chinese shadow boxing is more than a martial art -- it is a way of
life that can be traced back several thousand years.
</P>
<P>
The 40-something Californian has lived in a small village in
Central China's Henan Province since the end of 1993, where she
studies the ancient Chinese sport.
</P>
<P>
"China is a country extremely different from the West. You may
not judge it through foreign glasses," she said of her life here.
</P>
<P>
Brenner decided to learn shadow boxing after she was attacked
during a visit to another country. She has traveled extensively
worldwide and is now a special correspondent for an international
martial arts journal.
</P>
<P>
In December 1993, Brenner, who has given herself a Chinese
name, Jin Taiyang (Golden Sun), arrived at Xulu Village in Wenxian
County, the home of hen Qingzhou, a master of the slow-moving and
sophisticated martial art.
</P>
<P>
She was warmly welcomed by Chen, now 63, and his family. Her
life in Xulu with its poor, simple and exotic living conditions --
no shower, no heat and no air-conditioning as well as different
weather -- did not dissuade her from staying.
</P>
<P>
In the ninth months after her arrival, Brenner became a formal
disciple of Chen at a traditional ceremony, and since then has
become the 47th follower of the Shadow Boxing master.
</P>
<P>
She was then given another Chinese name, Chen Youji (balanced
temper), following Chen's family tree.
</P>
<P>
Brenner said she felt free and relaxed after nine months in
China, but soon discovered great cultural and ideological
differences existed between her and her Chinese hosts.
</P>
<P>
Chen embraced Confucianist views. Brenner says she was "typical
American": simple and straightforward.
</P>
<P>
"Master Chen and I have different cultural backgrounds and
lifestyles," she said. "We often think differently, and often come
up with contradictory views."
</P>
<P>
In 1994, Brenner accompanied Chen on a tour of the United
States, but the trip did not change her master's view about the
country across the Pacific Ocean.
</P>
<P>
"I have made great efforts to learn shadow boxing, but the
master has never praised me, as he thinks that we are now family
members and it is not necessary to appreciate me in that way," she
said.
</P>
<P>
Brenner thought she deserved thanks from Chen, as she had
treated him like a father by washing his clothes and doing other
chores, but the master said these were simply the duties of one of
his followers.
</P>
<P>
"A disciple should be 100 percent faithful to the master," Chen
told her.

<P>
BEIJING, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Highlights of today's major
Beijing-based newspapers:
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- The key to relieving poor counties from poverty is to choose
qualified county-level leadership, especially magistrates and the
Communist Party county committee secretaries, a senior Party
official said yesterday at a central conference on
poverty-alleviation and development of poor areas.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Rongji, member of the Standing Committee of the Political
Bureau of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee,
said central and local government departments have sent cadres to
poverty-stricken counties to make in-depth investigations and find
solutions to poverty-relief problems, but they are not authorized
to direct all aspects of the work.
</P>
<P>
 "People's Daily" (overseas edition)
</P>
<P>
-- Qiao Shi, chairman of the National People's Congress
Standing Committee, has stressed that China should speed up the
development, application and industrialization of its hi-tech
sector.
</P>
<P>
Qiao Shi, who is also a member of the Standing Committee of the
Political Bureau of the Chinese Communist Party Central Committee,
made the remarks recently during his inspection tour in
southwestern Sichuan Province.
</P>
<P>
 "Xinhua Daily Telegraph"
</P>
<P>
-- China is to give a high priority to aid-the-poor projects
with the help of science and technology in its central and western
areas.
</P>
<P>
It is part of China's effort to solve food and clothing
problems for the country's 65 million poor people.
</P>
<P>
Zhu Lilan, vice-minister of State Commission for Science and
Technology said yesterday in Beijing that her commission will
place 60 percent of its funds in the next five years for science
and technology promotion projects in central and western areas of
China.
</P>
<P>
 "China Daily"
</P>
<P>
-- China, the world's largest coal producer, will guide coal
production toward a market economy with the promulgation of a new
law.
</P>
<P>
The Coal Law will ensure that coal resources will be developed
and exploited in a rational and protective way, and that coal
production and trading be conventional.

<HEADLINE> MNLF, Ex-Rebels in Philippines Agree to Ceasefire </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 26 (Xinhua) -- The Moro National Liberation
Front (MNLF) had forged a ceasefire agreement with a rebel group
formed by former MNLF members in the southern Philippines, the
local press reported today.
</P>
<P>
The truce came after members of the mainstream MNLF assured the
breakaway group called "Magic 8" that those involved in last
Monday's shoot-out wherein five MNLF guerrillas died would be
turned over to the government.
</P>
<P>
"Magic 8" was led by eight former MNLF field commanders who
went over to the government's side during the Marcos regime. The
group is said to control politics in most of the 18 towns in Sulu
province.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that the "Magic 8" had clashed with some MNLF
members three times over the past two weeks in Indanan town in
the province,
killing at least eight people.
</P>
<P>
As the two sides agreed to ceasefire, the Armed Forces Southern
Command deployed a contingent of marines and policemen to Sulu to
restore peace and order in Indanan town.
</P>
<P>
As this developed, another Muslim insurgency group called the
Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF) said it was ready to join
forces with "Magic 8" to fight the MNLF.
</P>
<P>
The government's peace effort in Mindanao is being challenged
with the MILF and other rebels groups such as the Abu Sayyaf and
the Moro Islamic Liberation Organization opposed to the peace
accord signed between the MNLF and the government.

<TEXT>
<P>
Brenner once left Chen, saying she could no longer bear the
strictness of the Chinese lifestyle just for the opportunity to
learn shadow boxing.
</P>
<P>
"We are now one family and we should try to understand each
other," Chen told his American student.
</P>
<P>
"I love shadow boxing, and that love has overpowered
differences between us," Brenner said. Since then, she has made
greater efforts to understand Chinese people.
</P>
<P>
Now, Brenner and Chen are good friends. The master, who has
five sons, treats the American woman as his "best son," in keeping
with the Chinese tradition that a martial arts master only teaches
his skills to sons, not daughters.
</P>
<P>
Chen's wife also thinks highly of Brenner. "She is my only
daughter," the Chinese woman often tells other villagers.
</P>
<P>
Chen suffers from diabetes, and when he needs medicine, Brenner
makes the trip to a distant county to buy the drugs.
</P>
<P>
Chen said Brenner has studied the martial art very carefully
and made rapid progress. She has impressed him, he added.
</P>
<P>
"Even for Chinese, it is rare to see a person who loves shadow
boxing so much and has reached such a high level of skill," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Brenner said she has gradually come to understand her master,
and believes that he is a true hero.
</P>
<P>
Though her first love is shadow boxing, Brenner has learned a
lot about many other aspects of the Chinese culture. She likes to
chat with villagers and go shopping, always bargaining with the
shop assistants. She has attended many village funerals, and found
them entirely different from those in America.
</P>
<P>
"At Chinese funerals, everyone tries to soothe and comfort the
loved ones of the dead. They bring to the unfortunate family many
things, including food and money, trying to bring hope to the
family," she said.
</P>
<P>
Brenner's story has drawn so much attention from so many people
that an American publishing house has invited her to write a book
about her life in China.
</P>
<P>
"I want to tell my countrymen that China is a great country,"
she noted.
</P>
<P>
Brenner is now preparing to leave for home, and finds it
difficult to leave Xulu Village. "I would like to stay here
forever, if possible," she says.
</P>
<P>
She plans to teach shadow boxing in the United States.

<HEADLINE> Kilns to Make Bricks for Great Wall Found in Hebei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists
have found remains of some 20 kilns from the Ming Dynasty
(1368-1644) that were used to make bricks for the world-renowned
Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
At one of the kilns, the archaeologists discovered 403 bricks,
each measuring 41 cm long, 20 cm wide and ten cm thick.
</P>
<P>
After testing finished bricks found in the kiln sites, experts
said that the brick-making techniques of Ming were similar to or
even higher than those used now.
</P>
<P>
The experts said the discovery is proof that the bricks used to
build the Great Wall were made at the foot of the wall with local
earth, which kept the cost to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500 bricks could be made at a time in each kiln, and
every one-meter section of the wall required about 11,000 bricks,
they said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 km of the wall were made with the bricks during
the Ming Dynasty, they said.

UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The members of the

fighting in Afghanistan, Alfredo Lopes Cabral, the current

GUIYANG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,100 fossils dating
back 200-500 million years, which were confiscated from smugglers
or illegal diggers, are on display in Guiyang, the capital of
southwest China's Guizhou Province.
</P>
<P>
The fossils, including 359 rare types, belonged to 100
primitive vertebrates and 1,000 invertebrates which lived in the
area then.
</P>
<P>
Guizhou, which was then part of the sea, was home to 110 kinds
of organs from the pre-Cambrian period 500 million years ago, and
also the Kuizhousaurus, which dates back 200 million years.
</P>
<P>
The Kuizhousaurus, 100 million years older than the dinosaur,
looks similar to a dinosaur but was much smaller.
</P>
<P>
Scientists say that the fossils will contribute to the study of
the earth's early evolutionary period.

<HEADLINE> Kilns to Make Bricks for Great Wall Found in Hebei </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 26 (Xinhua) -- Chinese archaeologists
have found remains of some 20 kilns from the Ming Dynasty
(1644-1911) that were used to make bricks for the world-renowned
Great Wall.
</P>
<P>
At one of the kilns, the archaeologists discovered 403 bricks,
each measuring 41 cm long, 20 cm wide and ten cm thick.
</P>
<P>
After testing finished bricks found in the kiln sites, experts
said that the brick-making techniques of Ming were similar to or
even higher than those used now.
</P>
<P>
The experts said the discovery is proof that the bricks used to
build the Great Wall were made at the foot of the wall with local
earth, which kept the cost to a minimum.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 500 bricks could be made at a time in each kiln, and
every one-meter section of the wall required about 11,000 bricks,
they said.
</P>
<P>
More than 1,500 km of the wall were made with the bricks during
the Ming Dynasty, they said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. to Issue New Bond Protected against Inflation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The U.S government will
auction a new type of bond which is protected against inflation at
the beginning of next year.
</P>
<P>
It will be the first time that the U.S. government securities
is tied with inflation although some Western countries have been
offering such investment for some times.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton unveiled details of the new
government bond today at a presidential campaigning meeting in
Pennsylvania.
</P>
<P>
He said the U.S. Treasury Department will auction 10-year
"inflation protection" notes starting in next January and costing
as little as 1,000 dollars. The bonds' principal will be protected
against inflation, as measured by the consumer price index.
</P>
<P>
In addition, the U.S. government plans to offer inflation
protection to purchasers of certain types of savings bonds
beginning no later than 1998. The savings bonds will be available
for as little as 50 dollars and they will be tax-deferred until
they are cashed.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government offered 55 billion dollars worth of regular
10-year notes for sale last year. But the amount of securities
sold with the inflation protection will be much smaller, according
to the Treasure Department.
</P>
<P>
With the added protection, interest rates on the bonds will be
lower than on regular 10-year notes. But the administration
believes middle-class investors will welcome the shield against
inflation.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Urges Calm after West Bank Violence </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The United States on
Wednesday urged Israel and the Palestinians to exercise restraint
and halt violence to avoid raising new "issues" as Israel's
decision to open a tunnel near a holy Islamic site in Jerusalem
sparked serious riots on the West Band and in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
"The United States would like to urge all sides to move quickly
to restore calm, to exercise restraint, and to avoid further
violence," State Department deputy spokesman Glyn Davies said at a
State Department briefing.
</P>
<P>
State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns who is accompanying
Secretary of State Warren Christopher in United Nations said: "The
United States firmly believes that neither Israel nor the
Palestinians should create other issues that can make the
situation more difficult."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. standpoint, Davies said in a statement, is that
"Israelis and Palestinians focus on using negotiations to resolve
the outstanding issues related to the implementation of their
agreements".
</P>
<P>
The riots in Jerusalem and on the West Bank were touched off by
Israel's completion of an archaeological tunnel along Jerusalem's
Al Aqsa Mosque compound, one of the holiest sites of Islam.
</P>
<P>
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who had personally
given orders to workmen to break through the last stretch of the
tunnel under the cover of darkness on Tuesday, said the narrow
passage revealed an important chapter in Jewish history.
</P>
<P>
Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat denounced the tunnel as a "big
crime" that violated Muslim religious rights and called for a
general strike and protest marches.
</P>
<P>
Arafat also reportedly called off a meeting between senior
Israeli and Palestinian officials on peace negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Three Palestinians were killed and 170-180 injured on Wednesday
when Israeli police opened fire on protesters near the West Bank
city of Ramallah.
</P>
<P>
In other areas of the West Bank there were also reports of
Palestinians left wounded.
</P>
<P>
It was the worst crisis yet in Israeli-Palestinian relations,
which have been faltering since Likud leader Netanyahu won
election in May and led his country astray from the peace process
course, observers here said.
</P>
<P>
Arafat has warned Israel that a new uprising could erupt if
Netanyahu stuck to his tough positions.
</P>
<P>
Davies declined to assign blame in the situation or condemn
actions from either side, saying the "number one job" now for the
United States "is to do all we can diplomatically to convey this
message to the parties that what's needed is a measure of calm, a
measure of restraint, and to try to put an end to this dangerous
confrontations".
</P>
<P>
He said U.S. Ambassador to Israel Martin Indyk had been in
tough with the Israeli government, while Consul General Ed
Abington had talked with Arafat.

<HEADLINE> Armenian Speaker Hospitalized with Brain Injury </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Babken Ararktsyan, chairman of
the Armenian parliament, today received a bad brain injury and was
hospitalized, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
The 52-year-old speaker was forcibly taken away from his office
by protesters taking part in a thousands-strong rally staged by
the opposition in the Armenian capital of Yerevan earlier today in
support of the opposition leader, Vazgen Manukyan.
</P>
<P>
Manukyan, who collected over 42 percent of votes, lost the
presidential race in Sunday elections and was defeated by
President Levon Ter-Petrosyan supported by 52.8 percent of voters.
</P>
<P>
A crowd of people numbering around 10,000 broke an iron fence
around the parliament building and breaking through special
security troop cordons and ran towards the parliament building,
chanting "Vazgen - President."
</P>
<P>
At 19:20 local time, Interior Ministry troops wearing
protective helmets and carrying batons and protective shields
moved from the presidential palace towards the parliament
building.
</P>
<P>
At 19:23, first shots were fired.
</P>
<P>
It is not immediately clear whether the police fired warning
shots into the air or if they were targeted at protesters. Several
ambulances have been seen driving off from the site where the
clashes began.
</P>
<P>
Several thousands people are watching the developments outside
the parliament building, the reports said, adding that the
shooting continues.
</P>
<P>
Armenian Interior Minister Vano Siradegyan described the
disturbances as "abortive coup d'etat."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the leaders of Armenia's Communist Party, Sergei
Badalyan, stated that both the opposition and the ruling party
supporting the President had violated rules in the presidential
elections.

<HEADLINE> 16 States Calls on Renewing Multilateralism </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Sixteen heads of state
or government today urged all nations to support multilateralism,
focus on their common long-term interests and redouble their
efforts to ensure success of comprehensive refrom.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued here, the heads of state or government
from Australia, Brazil, Canada, Cote d'Ivoire, the Czech Republic,
Egypt, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Jamaica, Japan, Mexico, the
Netherlands, the Republic of Korea, South Africa and Sweden,
reiterated their support for global cooperation.
</P>
<P>
Despite some progress, the hopes they shared have not been
fulfilled, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
"In fact, unilateral actions, a deteriorating membership morale
and even a decline in the commitment to Charter obligations have
continued to undermine international cooperation," the statement
said.
</P>
<P>
"If the gap between the cooperation we have and the one we need
continues to widen, multilateralism will be threatened at its
core," the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Stressing the key role of the United Nations in promoting
multilateralism, the statement rejects any notion that the world
cooperation can meet the needs and expectations of people without
a stronger United Nations.
</P>
<P>
The 16 heads of state or government also stressed comprehensive
reform of the world organization and urged all countries to pay
their assessed dues in full, on time and without conditions.
</P>
<P>
"Furthermore, the financing of global cooperation in the
economic and social fields needs to be assured throughout the
multilateral system," the statement said.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Fed  Willing to Take Risk in Monetary Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- The decision by U.S.
Federal Reserve (Fed) to keep the interest rates unchanged has
roused strong and different reactions in the nation and some
economists said the U.S. Fed has decided to gamble.
</P>
<P>
After nearly five hours of closed-door discussions on Tuesday,
the Fed's policy-maker, the Federal Open Market Committee, decided
to leave short-term interest rates unchanged.
</P>
<P>
The decision surprised many economists and major U.S.
newspapers reported the decision today on their front pages, some
on their most leading positions.
</P>
<P>
Viewing the economy being speeding along dangerously rapid
pace, many economists had been expecting at least a tiny increase
in the short-term rates controlled by the Fed, especially after a
news leak that eight of the Fed's 12 regional banks were pushing
for a tighter monetary policy as a pre-emptive strike against
inflation.
</P>
<P>
"We think it is wishful thinking on the part of the Fed to
think that inflation is not going to begin to rise," said Paul
Getman of Regional Financial Associates.
</P>
<P>
"The risk to the Fed is that inflation will start to accelerate
and once inflation starts getting built into the system, it is
hard to get it out," said David Wyss, an economist at DRI-McGraw
Hill Inc.
</P>
<P>
"This is a gamble," economist Lynn Reaser of Barnett Bank in
Florida said of the Fed's decision. "Their failure to move this
summer and early fall may mean that larger steps will be required
by later this year or early 1997."
</P>
<P>
However, some economists voiced support for the Fed's action.
</P>
<P>
Bruce Steinberg of Merrill Lynch in New York said he believed
the economy would slow in the second half of this year to growth
rates of around 2 percent, far below the 4.8 percent pace in the
second quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
"In making this decision, the Fed listened to Main Street;
namely that higher economic growth, employment and wages are
possible without accelerating inflation," said Jerry Jasinowski,
president of the National Association of Manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
U.S. President Bill Clinton was pleased with the decision.
</P>
<P>
"It shows we have a strong economy with no inflation. I am glad
about that," he said.

<P>
UNITED NATIONS, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Afghan is calling the
attention of the U.N. Security Council to an "aggravated and
alarming situation in the country, which it said was caused by
aggression into Afghan by Pakistani militia forces.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council began consultations this afternoon on the
issue indicated by the Afghanistan government in a statement
submitted by the Afghan Mission to the United Nations earlier
today.
</P>
<P>
The statement said the aggravated and alarming situation in
Afghanistan was "emanating from an open and widespread incursion
and aggression into the Afghan territory by Pakistani militia
forces in support of the Taliban."
</P>
<P>
Norbert Holl, head of the United Nations Special Mission to
Afghanistan, issued a statement, too, expressing his concern about
the recent events in Afghanistan.
</P>
<P>
The official appealed to all the factions involved in the
ongoing conflicts to "observe immediate ceasefire, restrain from
further use of military force to resolve their problems.
</P>
<P>
He urges the parties involved to begin earnestly and seriously
negotiations for a lasting political settlement and peace in their
country.
</P>
<P>
He also called countries with influence in Afghanistan to
cooperate with the United Nations to search for a sustainable
resolution of the Afghan tragedy.

<HEADLINE> British MPs Warned over Adams Meeting </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 25 (Xinhua) -- Two Labor MPs face
disciplinary action if they go ahead with plans to meet Sinn Fein
President Gerry Adams in the Commons tomorrow, the BBC reported
this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
However, Left-wing MP Jeremy Corbyn has declared he would go
ahead with plans to meet Adams despite the threat of disciplinary
action. Ex-Cabinet minister Tony Benn also had plan to meet Adams.
</P>
<P>
It was announced here that Adams will begin a two day trip to
London on September 26. The trip starts with an early morning
interview on BBC and will be followed by a private meeting in the
House of Commons.
</P>
<P>
Originally, Adams had a plan to launch his autobiography in the
Commons on his first day in London. But it was cancelled by
parliamentary officials at the weekend.
</P>
<P>
Both Jeremy Corbyn and Tony Benn have been warned they face
losing the party whip if the meeting took place in parliament.
</P>
<P>
Donald Dewar, Labor's chief parliamentary business manager said
"It is particularly reprehensible in the light of recent events
involving the Irish Republican Army (IRA)."
</P>
<P>
Scotland Yard on September 23 foiled bombing plans of the IRA
with five suspects arrested and one killed in London.
</P>
<P>
The IRA has planted a number of bombs in Britain since calling
off a l7-month-long cease-fire in February, citing British
intransigence over the progress of peace efforts in Northern
Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Jeremy Corbyn said his aim was to promote the peace precess and
nothing could be achieved by "driving the IRA even further into
their bunker".

</P>
<P>
The London market, the largest in Europe, recovered from its
three days of losses of about 64 points and put on a strong
performance, with the FTSE 100 index closing 25.2 points higher at

</P>
<P>
