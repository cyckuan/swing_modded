DHAKA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Four people, including two
Bangladeshi nationals, were injured as the Bangladesh Rifles (BDR)
and India's Border Security Forces (BSF) traded gunfire in two
incidents on Friday and Saturday, the Associated Press of
Bangladesh (APB) reported.
</P>
<P>
Two Bangladeshi fishermen were hit by bullets on Friday when
BSF men opened fire on them as they were fishing in the
Brahmaputra River, along the border areas in northwestern
Bangladesh's Kurigram district.
</P>
<P>
Patrolling BDR members returned fire leaving an unidentified
Indian national injured, the APB news agency said.
</P>
<P>
On Saturday, BDR members at the border areas of the same
district fired at an India national who they suspected to be a
smuggler when he was trying to cross into Bangladesh territory.
</P>
<P>
Several incidents of shoot-out along the border areas have
taken place over the past few days after the BDR beefed up
vigilance along the border to curb smuggling, according to the
news agency.

<HEADLINE> New Constitution Urged in Zimbabwe </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Hundreds of Zimbabweans in the
capital Harare Saturday held a constitutional march in the city
centre to express their view on the need to write a new
consitution of the country.
</P>
<P>
The march was organized by the National Constitutional Assembly
(NCA) and several mass organisations.
</P>
<P>
NCA 's task force chairman, Morgan tsvangirai, told the placard
waving marchers who were escorted by the police, that Zimbabwe
needed a new constitution produced with the contributions from all
organizations and individuals in the country.
</P>
<P>
He said corruption in Zimbabwe is rampant because the current
constitution did not outline the need for politicians to be
accountable.
</P>
<P>
"We will follow the law to advocate for a new constitution and
demand the ban on job stayaways to be lifted, but if that fails,
we will do the usual things," said Tsvangirai, apparently
referring to nationwide stayaways.
</P>
<P>
The march was dominated by songs denouncing the government,
particularly its involvement of Zimbabwe in the Democratic
Republic of congo (DRC) war.
</P>
<P>
Tsvangirai, who is also Secretary General of the Zimbabwe
Congress of Trade Unions, urged the marchers who mostly consisted
of journalists, students from the University of zimbabwe not to
use violence when they had complaints against the government.
</P>
<P>
The ruling ZANU (PF) party, which last year endorsed the need
for the new constitution to replace the British-crafted Lancaster
House Document of 1979 at its national conference, has since
started channeles for the new constitution to be drafted.

<HEADLINE> Asia-Europe Finance Ministers Meeting Closed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The finance ministers from 15
European Union (EU) and 10 Asian countries agreed to deepen talks
on reforming international financial architecture.
</P>
<P>
They sought better ways to control institutions involved in
capital flows such as banks and hedge funds, said German Finance
Minister Oskar Lafontaine at the close of the ASEM meeting
Saturday in Frankfurt.
</P>
<P>
Warning of dangerous short-term capital shifts, Germany pushed
proposals for an international exchange rate regime while Japan
called for hard-hit Asian currencies to be pegged.
</P>
<P>
"Financial crises in Asia and other regions have highlighted
the potential for abrupt and destabilizing short-term capital
movements, especially in emerging markets," said Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
Ministers stressed in a joint statement that markets needed to
be kept open for flows of capital, goods and services and that
trade should be further liberalized.
</P>
<P>
There were extensive talks at the meeting on an exchange rate
regime for major world currencies, said Lafontaine.
</P>
<P>
But he was vague about what form it should take and how and
when such a regime could be imposed.
</P>
<P>
He said a first step was convergence of key economic and
financial data, as had been achieved by European states regarding
inflation, debt and budget deficits before joining the euro.
</P>
<P>
"In this context the introduction of the euro was also seen as
an opportunity to intensify the efforts to achieve more exchange
rate stability in the international monetary system," said a
statement issued by the ASEM meeting.
</P>
<P>
Lafontaine said convergence would be followed by placing
currency exchange rates in a corridor, as outlined in a recent
Bretton Woods report chaired by former U.S. Federal Reserve head
Paul Volcker.
</P>
<P>
But he admitted this would not be an easy task: "It is always a
problem when you ask the architect to rebuild you own house...Such
changes take time, as we know."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. government and the European Central Bank oppose
Lafontaine's calls for any sort of exchange rate corridors or
bands.
</P>
<P>
Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa proposed pegging
currencies of smaller Asian nations - not the yen - to basket of
major world currencies.
</P>
<P>
Reacting to the proposal, Malaysian Second Minister of Finance
Dato Mustapa Mohamed said: "This idea has been floated and now we
have to study it."
</P>
<P>
The European Commissioner for Economic and Monetary Union, Yves
Thibault de Silguy, said individual countries would have to decide
whether they wanted to use the euro, which was launched January 1,
as reserve currency.
</P>
<P>
"We didn't discuss the euro as a reserve currency because this
is not the sort of thing you can dictate by decree," said de
Silguy.
</P>
<P>
Nevertheless, the statement by all 25 ministers said the euro
would become a "major investment and reserve currency".
</P>
<P>
De Silguy said there were signals of recovery in some
countries, especially Thailand and South Korea.
</P>
<P>
The Asia-Europa Finance Ministers Meeting began on Friday.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Senate Majority Leader Calls for Witnesses in Trial </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Senate Majority Leader
Trent Lott has asked Democrats to meet to discuss the possibility
of calling witnesses later in the Senate trial against President
Bill Clinton, senate sources said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
However, Lott got a cool response from Senate Democratic Leader
Tom Daschle, according to the sources.
</P>
<P>
Lott proposed in a letter to Daschle that "a bipartisan group
of senators could anticipate and help resolve in advance any
complications" brought about by witness testimony. "We should
consider safeguards now so that testimony could begin as soon as
fairness allowed."
</P>
<P>
But Daschle said such a move would violate the Senate's
previous agreement, which calls for the witness question to be
settled later in the process. "I agree that the prospect of witness
testimony poses a number of troubling considerations that we would
be forced to confront," Daschle wrote. "It is my hope that such
arrangements will ultimately prove unnecessary."
</P>
<P>
A team of 13 House prosecutors, who opened their arguments
before the Senate on Thursday, have kept up their pressure on
senators to call witnesses by trying to highlight possible
conflicts in testimony that could be resolved only by hearing from
the people themselves.
</P>
<P>
The prosecutors, all Republicans, want to call at least a
half-dozen witnesses, including former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky, Clinton's secretary Betty Currie, and even Clinton
himself.
</P>
<P>
"If you have any significant doubts about Monica Lewinsky's
credibility or her testimony, you should bring her in here and let
us examine her face to face so you can judge her credibility for
yourself," prosecutor Bill McCollum told senators on Friday.
</P>
<P>
The issue of witnesses has polarized the Senate, with Democrats
arguing the mountain of evidence passed on from the House should
serve as the official record in the first presidential impeachment
trial since President Andrew Johnson escaped conviction by one
vote in 1868.
</P>
<P>
White House spokesman Joe Lockhart said Friday that the
prosecutors don't believe their case is strong enough so that they
are trying to expand it and open up new areas.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment approved by the House on December 19 last year along
partisan lines. A two-thirds vote of the Senate would be needed to
remove Clinton, something few believe is possible now.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ministerial Meeting on Congo (K) Achieves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The regional ministerial meeting
to seek a peaceful solution to the five-month long armed conflict
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) ended here Saturday
morning without achieving its anticipated result.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, which ended at 5:00 hours (local time)
in the morning, reviewed the current situation of peace process in
DRC.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued after the meeting, the
participants agreed on the mechanisms for moving the peace process
forward. To this end two working groups were set up during the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The committee on security concerns in the DRC and neighboring
countries comprises Zambia, Kenya, Botswana, Mauritius, the United
Nations, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The other group -- the committee on the implementation of
ceasefire agreement comprises Zambia, all warring parties, the
United Nations, OAU and SADC.
</P>
<P>
The two groups will begin their work immediately and submit
reports to the next regional ministerial meeting which should be
convened as soon as possible, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Foreign and defense ministers from a total of 15 countries, in
addition to OAU, SADC and the United Nations, attended the
meeting. They are South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi,
Tanzanian, libya, Uganda, Mozambique, DRC, Zambia, Botswana, Chad,
Namibia and Angola.
</P>
<P>
The rebels fighting to topple Congolese President Laurent
Kabila were barred from the meeting as it was before.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting Congolese Foreign Minister (please find out
his name) told the press that his country will continue to fight
to seize back its territories occupied by outside invaders.
</P>
<P>
On Friday South African Foreign Minister Alred Nzo told the
press that the primary objective of the meeting is to find a
solution to the conflict in DRC and ceasefire is a key to it.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said it is not an easy task to find the solution and
implement the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Before the three-day meeting, Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba traveled to Rwanda, Zimbabwe and DRC and discussed the
peace process with his counterparts in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who was mandated by SADC to spearhead the peace
process, made the visits as part of his efforts to arrange a
long-awaited regional summit, which would have followed the
ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
After the discussion on January 10 with Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe, Chiluba announced in Harare that the regional
summit would be held in Lusaka on January 16 or 17.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the ministerial meeting started here, Chiluba
flew to DRC to meet with Kabila. After his meeting with Kabila,
Chiluba said there was need to give more time to the ministerial
meeting to exhaust all thorny issues surrounding the peace
initiative before the heads of state could convene a final summit.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that because of deep divisions among the
parties concerned on how to end the conflict in DRC, the
ministerial meeting achieved no substantial results with only
empty promises.
</P>
<P>
Two days are inadequate for the ministers to complete the
consultations and come up with a complete document, Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka summit on Congo which should have been held on
December 8 of 1998 has been postponed twice due to Kabila's
refusal to have direct talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda have been accused of backing the rebels
while Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad have sent their troops to
DRC to support Kabila.

<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Some 26 students from the
University of Zimbabwe Saturday began a 440-km sponsored walk from
Bulawayo, the country's second largest city to Harare to raise
money for a fellow student who is suffering from renal failure.
</P>
<P>
"We want to raise three million Zimbabwean Dollars (about
75,000 U.S. Dollars) so that our colleague, Graciano Masauso can
undergo a kidney transplant in Johannesburg, South Africa sometime
next year and we hope we will be able to get something towards
that during the 11 days of our walk," Shepstone Musiyarira,
organizer of the walk told the Zimbabwe News Agency.
</P>
<P>
He said Masauso had to undergo a transplant in South Africa
because there was no equipment in Zimbabwe.
</P>
<P>
"This is the beginning of helping fellow citizens who are in
Masauso's condition as we are looking at setting up a fund that
will assist other patients who are not students," he said.
</P>
<P>
He added, "We are even thinking of linking up with institutions
 throughout the world that have kidney transplant facilities so
that we can build one in the country."

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Refuses to Take Back Illegal Immigrants </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon has rejected a request by
Cyprus to take in 29 illegal immigrants who had landed in Cyprus
three days ago, a Lebanese Foreign Ministry source said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The source said those illegal immigrants, mainly Iraqis, were
dumped on the southeastern coast of Cyprus Wednesday night.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after they reached the country in two fishing boats,
they were detained by the Cypriot police and were shipped back to
Lebanon Thursday night.
</P>
<P>
The illegal immigrants told the police they came from Lebanon's
northern port city of Tripoli and wanted to go to Italy.
</P>
<P>
However, Lebanon denied their entry into the country, saying
they are not Lebanese nationals and there is no evidence that the
ship which took them to Ayanapa in Cyprus had originally taken off
from a Lebanese port.
</P>
<P>
An unnamed Lebanese Coast Guard said that they were not
allowed into Lebanon also because they did not have passports or
other proper travel documents.
</P>
<P>
"Lebanese authorities are not showing any willingness to
cooperate and they refuse to admit that those people had actually
come from Tripoli," said Aleccos Shambos, a Cypriot Foreign
Ministry official.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has no other choice but to take the immigrants in if the
Lebanese authorities do not bend, he said.

<HEADLINE> Illegal Immigrants Issue "Very Serious": Cypriot FM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Cypriot Foreign Minister
Ioannis Kasoulides on Saturday described the illegal immigrants
problem between Cyprus and Lebanon as "very serious."
</P>
<P>
However, the issue does not affect Cyprus' diplomatic ties with
Lebanon, which he described as a "friendly neighboring country."
</P>
<P>
Lebanon refused to accept 29 illegal immigrants who were sent
back to Beirut by Cyprus police Friday and only allowed six
Egyptians who had entry papers to disembark.
</P>
<P>
Kasoulides said that consultations with the Lebanese government
are underway regarding the fate of the illegal immigrants.
</P>
<P>
Those immigrants, mainly Iraqis, were dumped on the
southeastern coast of Cyprus on Wednesday night aboard a fishing
boat which they said set out from the Lebanese port city of
Tripoli.
</P>
<P>
As Cypriot and Lebanese officials argued about who should take
the responsibility, the immigrants and 16 Cypriot police officers
sat stranded on the patrol boat off Beirut for most of the day.
</P>
<P>
It is the first time that Cyprus had promptly tried to send
back foreigners who entered the country illegally.
</P>
<P>
An understanding between the two countries requires that
illegal immigrants be repatriated within one week.
</P>
<P>
The illegal immigrants told the Cyprus police that they wanted
to go to the Rhodes island of Greece or Italy and had paid 800 to
1,000 U.S. dollars for the trip.

<HEADLINE> Israeli, Palestinian Police on Verge of Clashes </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Israeli and Palestinian
policemen Saturday were involved in a string of incidents in the
Gaza Strip, which almost triggered clashes between the two sides.
</P>
<P>
The drama began when the Israeli and Palestinian policemen
were conducting a joint patrol near the Jewish settlement of Gush
Katif in the Gaza Strip.
</P>
<P>
Suspicions arose among the Israeli policemen when a
Palestinian woman approached them.
</P>
<P>
At their request, the Palestinian policemen stopped and
questioned the woman, who turned out to be a Palestinian
policewoman.
</P>
<P>
While under questioning, the woman produced a knife and tried
to stab one Israeli policeman near her. The policeman was not hurt
and the woman was arrested.
</P>
<P>
But disputes erupted over which side should take the woman
away for further questioning.
</P>
<P>
At that point, an Israeli policeman accidentally discharged a
bullet from his gun. No one was wounded. However, some Palestinian
policemen jumped to take positions in a nearby orchard.
</P>
<P>
The situation was calmed down after senior Israeli and
Palestinian liaison officers arrived at the scene.
</P>
<P>
A main road which was blocked during the event was reopened and
the Palestinian woman was taken to the local liaison office.

<HEADLINE> Uganda's Embattled Mayor Appeals for Lenient </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KAMPALA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Embattled Mayor of Uganda's
Capital of Kampala City, Nasser Ssebaggala, Saturday appealed to
Ugandans to write to judge Reginald Lindsay and plead for a
lenient sentence in his favor.
</P>
<P>
This is contained in a message delivered by the mayor's
political assistant, Mathias Nsubuga Ssebaggala, at a press
conference here, Radio Uganda reported Saturday evening.
</P>
<P>
At the press conference at Uganda Media Center, the assistant
also pleaded for communication from his supporters.
</P>
<P>
He said that before the February 23, the mayor's lawyer Paul
Kelly is seeking for retrial for six counts, adding that there are
also grounds for appeal but can only be explored after hearing
sentence.
</P>
<P>
Nsubuga, who returned from Boston of the United States a few
days ago, said that the people of Kampala city are still
supporting Ssebaggala as Mayor.
</P>
<P>
He said his team is looking around for money to settle the
200,000- Dollar defense bill. So far only 70,000 Dollars has been
cleared.
</P>
<P>
Ssebaggala, who was charged with eight counts of crime
including forged checks and lying to the Customs officers, was
arrested in the U.S. in mid- June of 1998. He will be sentenced on
February 23 in the U.S. and faces a 21-27 month jail term.
</P>
<P>
Not being a member of the ruling National Resistance Movement,
Ssebaggala was elected Mayor of Kampala city in April 1998 in a
hotly contested race in which he defeated four other candidates.
</P>
<P>
The mayorship of the 51-year-old mayor has since become the
frequent topic of the city council and the general public of the
land-locked east African country.

DAR ES SALAAM, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Two residents of the same
family in the Tanzanian capital of Dar es Salaam were burnt to
death early Saturday morning, the police said.
</P>
<P>
Fatuma Mziray, 50, and her daughter, Zena, were killed by a

<HEADLINE> Iran Cuts down Work Permits to Foreigners </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Facing an economic crisis and
growing unemployment, Iran said on Saturday that it has cut down
the number of work permits issued to foreigners in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Director General for Foreign Employment of the Labor Ministry
Shakour Ebrahimi said that his ministry issued 9,781 work permits
to foreigners during last Iranian calendar year (ended on March 20,
1998), showing a sharp fall from the figure of 18,408 five years
ago.
</P>
<P>
A total of 7,855 permits were renewed or issued to the
foreigners during the first nine months of the current Iranian
year by the ministry, Ebrahimi told the Islamic Republic News
Agency (IRNA).
</P>
<P>
Of the total, 21.4 percent were extended to Iraqi citizens
while the Afghans lagged behind all others with only 4.2 percent
of the permits, he said.
</P>
<P>
Iran reported a 9.08 percent unemployment rate for 1996, but
experts believed the current rate was above 15 percent, up by
about 9 percent annually in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Senior labor officials warned earlier that the country would
see a 100 percent increase in unemployment rate since some 37
million of its 60 million population are under 24.
</P>
<P>
Around 800,000 young people join the workforce each year,
according to official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Ebrahimi called on the government to adopt a more vigorous
scheme to prevent illegal entry of foreigners and to prevent
movement of the foreign workforce in the country.
</P>
<P>
According to the statistics released by the U.N., there were
2,039,359 foreign refugees living in Iran by the end of 1998,
including 1,414,649 Afghans and 579,200 Iraqis, the official
said.

ADDIS ABABA, January 16 (Xinhua) -The first health care and
welfare clinic for donkeys, built on the premises of the Addis
Ababa University (AAU) faculty of veterinary medicine, was
inaugurated Saturday.
</P>
<P>
According to the Ethiopian News Agency, the clinic, situated at
Debre Zeit, some 40 km from Addis Ababa, is the first of its kind
in Ethiopia which has more than five million working donkeys
throughout the country.

Inaugurating the clinic, AAU President Mogesse Ashenafi said
despite all the help they have offered to man, donkeys are
mistreated by the broad section of the public here in Ethiopia and
in other countries as well.
</P>
<P>
The president said the opening of the clinic facilitates the

field.

<HEADLINE> U.S. House Prosecutors Wrap Up Opening Phase of </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- U.S. House prosecutors said
in the Senate trial against President Bill Clinton Saturday that
the president's conduct in his affair with former White House
intern Monica Lewinsky amounted to "high crimes and misdemeanors"
warranting his removal.
</P>
<P>
Wrapping up arguments in the last day of their three-day
presentations in the trial, the 13 House prosecutors, all
Republican lawmakers, launched a blistering attack on what they
called Clinton's "so-what defense." They told senators he should
be removed from office because he "abused the trust placed upon
him by the American people."
</P>
<P>
"Our Constitution, and the American people, entrust to the
president singular responsibility for enforcing the rule of law.
Perjury and obstruction of justice strike at the heart of the rule
of law," Steve Buyer told a hushed Senate chamber.
</P>
<P>
Buyer said, "I'm not offended by the 'so what' defense. If that
is all you have then try it." He said presidential lawyers seemed
to feel their only chance was to "attack the prosecutor and
attempt to confuse those who sit in judgment."
</P>
<P>
"The House is prepared to establish that the president, William
Jefferson Clinton, willfully and repeatedly violated the rule of
law and abused the trust placed upon him by the American people,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
"A president who has committed these crimes has plainly and
directly violated his most important executive duty," Buyer added.
</P>
<P>
Lindsey Graham said Clinton's case was one of "serious offenses
colored by sex and there is absolutely no way to get around that.
And I know it is uncomfortable to listen to."
</P>
<P>
Graham also cautioned senators that if they convict Clinton
they would put a "burden" on the next president: "Don't lie under
oath when you are a defendant in a lawsuit against an average
citizen. Have the courage to apply the law in a fair manner to
yourself."
</P>
<P>
Charles Canady, another of the prosecutors, reminded senators
they have impeached and removed federal judges for perjury. "The
Senate should not establish a lower standard of integrity for the
president than the standard it has already established for federal
judges," he argued in prepared remarks.
</P>
<P>
"Contrary to the claims of the president's lawyers, there is
not a bright line separating official misconduct by a president
from other misconduct of which the president is guilty," Canady
argued.
</P>
<P>
However, Democratic Party leaders and the White House have
repeatedly stated that Clinton is not guilty of perjury or
obstruction of justice and that the charges, even if proved, do
not rise to the level of "high crimes and misdemeanors" warranting
removal from office.
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment approved by the House on December 19 last year along
partisan lines. A two-thirds vote of the Senate would be needed to
removal Clinton, something few believe is possible now.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions Claim 1.85 Million Iraqis: Health </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, December 16 (Xinhua) -- The eight-year-old
U.N. sanctions have claimed some 1.85 million Iraqis including
over 0.4 million children under the age of five, said Iraqi
Health Minister Umid Midhat Mubarak Saturday.
</P>
<P>
In a statement to the Iraqi News Agency (INA), Mubarak said
since the 1991 Gulf War, 425 Iraqi hospitals and clinics have
been damaged severely.
</P>
<P>
He said that the health status in Iraq had been deteriorating
due to acute shortages of medicine and food resulted from the
embargo.
</P>
<P>
The U.N. imposed sanctions on Iraq following its 1990 invasion
of Kuwait, which led to the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Mortality rate among infants has increased sharply, said
Mubarak, adding that before the imposition of sanctions, out of
every 1,000 newly-born infants, only 24 died, now the number
amounted to 98.
</P>
<P>
And the average monthly mortality rate among children over the
age of five was 1,600 before the sanctions, but now it has risen
to 8,600 due to various curable diseases and malnutrition, he
added.
</P>
<P>
The health minister accused the U.S. and Britain of blocking
the approval of the contracts Iraq signed with other countries to
purchase medicine and medical supplies.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Ministerial Meeting on Congo (K) Achieves </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The regional ministerial meeting
to seek a peaceful solution to the five-month long armed conflict
in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) ended here Saturday
morning without achieving its anticipated result.
</P>
<P>
The three-day meeting, which ended at 5:00 hours (local time)
in the morning, reviewed the current situation of peace process in
DRC.
</P>
<P>
According to a communique issued after the meeting, the
participants agreed on the mechanisms for moving the peace process
forward. To this end two working groups were set up during the
meeting.
</P>
<P>
The committee on security concerns in the DRC and neighboring
countries comprises Zambia, Kenya, Botswana, Mauritius, the United
Nations, the Organization of African Unity (OAU) and the Southern
African Development Community (SADC).
</P>
<P>
The other group -- the committee on the implementation of
ceasefire agreement comprises Zambia, all warring parties, the
United Nations, OAU and SADC.
</P>
<P>
The two groups will begin their work immediately and submit
reports to the next regional ministerial meeting which should be
convened as soon as possible, said the communique.
</P>
<P>
Foreign and defense ministers from a total of 15 countries, in
addition to OAU, SADC and the United Nations, attended the
meeting. They are South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Rwanda, Burundi,
Tanzanian, libya, Uganda, Mozambique, DRC, Zambia, Botswana, Chad,
Namibia and Angola.
</P>
<P>
The rebels fighting to topple Congolese President Laurent
Kabila were barred from the meeting as it was before.
</P>
<P>
After the meeting, Congolese Foreign Minister Okoto Lolacombe
told the press that his country will continue to fight to seize
back its territories occupied by outside invaders.
</P>
<P>
On Friday South African Foreign Minister Alred Nzo told the
press that the primary objective of the meeting is to find a
solution to the conflict in DRC and ceasefire is a key to it.
</P>
<P>
Nzo said it is not an easy task to find the solution and
implement the ceasefire.
</P>
<P>
Before the three-day meeting, Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba traveled to Rwanda, Zimbabwe and DRC and discussed the
peace process with his counterparts in the three countries.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba, who was mandated by SADC to spearhead the peace
process, made the visits as part of his efforts to arrange a
long-awaited regional summit, which would have followed the
ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
After the discussion on January 10 with Zimbabwean President
Robert Mugabe, Chiluba announced in Harare that the regional
summit would be held in Lusaka on January 16 or 17.
</P>
<P>
Shortly before the ministerial meeting started here, Chiluba
flew to DRC to meet with Kabila. After his meeting with Kabila,
Chiluba said there was need to give more time to the ministerial
meeting to exhaust all thorny issues surrounding the peace
initiative before the heads of state could convene a final summit.
</P>
<P>
Analysts here said that because of deep divisions among the
parties concerned on how to end the conflict in DRC, the
ministerial meeting achieved no substantial results with only
empty promises.
</P>
<P>
Two days are inadequate for the ministers to complete the
consultations and come up with a complete document, Chiluba said.
</P>
<P>
The Lusaka summit on Congo which should have been held on
December 8 of 1998 has been postponed twice due to Kabila's
refusal to have direct talks with the rebels.
</P>
<P>
Rwanda and Uganda have been accused of backing the rebels
while Zimbabwe, Namibia, Angola and Chad have sent their troops to
DRC to support Kabila.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian FM Consults With Arab Counterparts on </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian Foreign Minister Amr
Moussa conducted a series of contacts Saturday with his
counterparts of several Arab countries on an upcoming Arab
ministerial meeting.
</P>
<P>
Moussa told reporters that he conferred with the foreign
ministers of Algeria, Morocco, Libyan, Saudi Arabia and Syria
about the Arab foreign ministers' meeting due January 24.
</P>
<P>
And he is scheduled to meet Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdel-Meguid on Sunday for further discussions on arrangements for
the meeting which was originally slated for December 30.
</P>
<P>
Consultations are to be continued in the following days before
Arab ministers arrive in Cairo two days prior to the meeting for
more talks, he added.
</P>
<P>
France and the U.S. have briefed Egypt on their initiatives
concerning the Iraqi issue, said Moussa.
</P>
<P>
France, the U.S. and Russia have separately submitted their
initiatives recently to the United Nations Security Council about
easing economic sanctions on Iraq and ways of monitoring its
weapons programs.
</P>
<P>
"We are currently studying all these initiatives and it now
depends on what will be reached by the (U.N.) Security Council,"
Moussa said.
</P>
<P>
Egypt "believes in the importance of maintaining Iraq's
integrity and unity, and easing the sufferings of the Iraqi
people."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain launched a four-day missile attack on Iraq
for what the U.S. denounced as Iraq's defiance of the U.N. weapons
inspections.
</P>
<P>
The elimination of Iraq's weapons of mass destruction overseen
by the U.N. Special Commission holds the key to the lifting of the
crippling sanctions the U.N. Security Council imposed on Iraq in
1990 after its invasion of Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Iran Punishes Assailants on Government Officials </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, January 16 (Xinhua) -- An Iranian public court has
sentenced three men, who attacked two government officials last
year, to prison terms and lashings, the judiciary announced on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Tehran court sentenced Amir Farshad Ebrahimi to two years
in prison and 50 lashes. Kiyanoush Mozaffari and Seyed Babak
Shahrestani were each sentenced to six months in prison and 30
lashes.
</P>
<P>
The three were charged of attacking Minister of Culture and
Islamic Guidance Ataollah Mohajerani and Vice President for
Development and Social Affairs Abdollah Nouri last September.
</P>
<P>
The two officials were beaten up by "groups of unidentified
people" when attending a funeral ceremony for 700 Iranian soldiers
killed in the Iran-Iraq war (1980-1988).
</P>
<P>
The two main advocates of the open-minded policies of President
Mohammed Khatami's government became the targets of criticism by
the hard-line and conservative factions.
</P>
<P>
Nouri was ousted as interior minister by the conservative
Majlis (parliament) last June and some conservatives even claimed
to impeach Mohajerani for his policy on freedom of expression.
</P>
<P>
After the attacks, Khatami and Supreme Leader Ayatollah
Ali Khamenei ordered to arrest those involved in the case.
</P>
<P>
The Interior Ministry announced in September that a number of
assailants were arrested for attacking government officials, but
so far no exact number of the attackers were given.

<HEADLINE> British Vodafone Wins Airtouch in Bidding War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Vodafone Group PLC, the
British mobile phone company has agreed to buy U.S. Airtouch
Communications Inc. to form the world largest wireless
telecommunications company, the New York Times said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The two companies made a deal after Vodafone bid 60 billion
U.S. dollars for the purchase, beating its rival, Bell Atlantic, a
U.S. company who offered 45 billion dollars in the bid.
</P>
<P>
The combined company to be named Vodafone Airtouch PLC will
dominate wireless phone market in Europe. Until now, Vodafone,
Britain's largest wireless phone company, serves in Northern
Europe, including Sweden, France, Germany and Netherland as well
as Britain while Airtouch operates in the southern part of the
continent, including Italy, Spain and Portugal.
</P>
<P>
It will also give Vodafone a presence in the U.S. market. The
British company has shunned the market so far.
</P>
<P>
The marriage of Vodafone and Airtouch will create powerhouse
with more than 11 billion dollars in annual revenue and about 20
million customers world-wide. The giant will be based in Newbury,
England, with U.S. operation in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
Airtouch, a regional company based in San Francisco,
California, lacks a national wireless network in the U.S. It's the
very reason for the company to be attractive to Bell Atlantic,
which also lacks a national cellular network.
</P>
<P>
The Vodafone's acquisition of Airtouch is a setback to Bell
Atlantic for its national presence in the U.S. Bell Atlantic said
in a statement last night that it had ended its merger discussions
with Airtouch.

<HEADLINE> Hyde: Remove Clinton or See Presidency Permanently </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Henry Hyde, leader
prosecutor of the U.S. House, said in the Senate impeachment trial
against President Bill Clinton Saturday that the presidency could
be "permanently damaged" if Clinton is not removed from office for
perjury and obstruction of justice.
</P>
<P>
Framers of the Constitution knew the presidency could be
"gravely damaged if it continued to be unworthily occupied," Hyde
said in his prepared remarks ending the arguments in the last day
of the three-day of the House prosecutors' presentation in the
trial.
</P>
<P>
"If on impeachment, the president is not convicted and removed
from office despite the fact that numerous senators are convinced
that he has... egregiously failed the test of his oath of office,
violated the trust of the American people and dishonored the
office.
</P>
<P>
... then the office of the presidency has been deeply, and
perhaps permanently damaged,'' Hyde said.
</P>
<P>
Hyde, who is also the chairman of the House Judiciary
Committee, said that it would harm the nation's standing in the
world "if a presidential perjurer represents our country in world
affairs."
</P>
<P>
Clinton, who went on trial in the Senate on January 7, is
charged with perjury and obstruction of justice in two articles of
impeachment approved by the House on December 19 last year along
partisan lines.
</P>
<P>
Clinton is the second president in U.S. history to be subjected
to a trial, after Andrew Johnson in 1868. A two-thirds vote of the
Senate would be needed to remove Clinton, something few believe is
possible now.

<HEADLINE> Egyptian Company Capital Up in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Egypt saw an increase of 15
percent in the capital of the firms set up last year from that in
1997, Chairman of Egypt's Investment Authority Ibrahim Fawzi said
on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Fawzi told reporters that capital volume of these firms stood
at 25.3 billion Egyptian pounds (7.44 billion U.S. dollars),
compared with 22 billion pounds (6.47 billion dollars) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
Fawzi said 2,187 investment companies were established in Egypt
in 1998, 1,142 more than that in 1997.
</P>
<P>
These investment companies attracted 5.1 billion pounds (1.5
billion dollars) of foreign investments in 1998, compared to 3.4
billion pounds (1 billion dollars) in 1997, he added.
</P>
<P>
Domestic capital in these companies jumped to 20.2 billion
pounds (5.94 billion dollars) from 19.4 billion pounds (5.7
billion dollars) in 1997, he said.
</P>
<P>
Among the companies formed last year, 1,401 were in the
industrial sector with a total capital of 6.7 billion pounds (1.97
billion dollars) and 228 in the agricultural sector with a
capital of 4.2 billion pounds (1.24 billion dollars).
</P>
<P>
The rise shows that the Egyptian government has succeeded in
providing a healthy climate for investments and in eliminating
impediments and red tape facing companies.
</P>
<P>
This also shows the growing confidence at home and abroad in
Egypt's economy, which has been developing steadily in the 1990s
due to the country's profound economic reforms, Fawzi said.

<HEADLINE> S. Leonean Govt Committed to Political Settlement </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The government of Sierra Leone
has assured the international community of its commitment to
political settlement of the conflict in the country, a report
reaching here said Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The assurance, which came after the government refused to
release detained rebel leader Foday Sankoh in exchange for an
earlier ceasefire agreement, was contained in a statement Friday
by Sierra Leone's permanent mission to the United Nations
headquarters in New York.
</P>
<P>
The statement accused the rebels of the Revolutionary United
Front (RUF) and their allies of the ousted military junta of
Johnny Paul Koromah of having been brutalizing innocent citizens
with the support of external forces.
</P>
<P>
It said the government would not abdicate its responsibility to
provide safety and security for its citizens, adding that any
military action by the government against the rebels would be
"self-defense".
</P>
<P>
"The offensive against the rebels and their vicious allies is
not merely a struggle to uphold the principle of democracy or to
bolster the democratically elected government of President (Ahmed
Tejan) Kabbah, but designed to protect, by all means necessary,
the very lives of the people of Sierra Leone and to prevent the
total destruction of Sierra Leone as a nation," said the
statement.
</P>
<P>
It further noted that while Kabbah has, since coming to power
in 1996, been pursuing a peaceful settlement of the conflict with
the RUF, the rebel group has not shown the political will to honor
all the peace agreements it has signed.
</P>
<P>
Though the rebels have been chased out of Freetown after fierce
fighting with the west African peacekeeping force ECOMOG, they
still hold the whole northern half of the country.
</P>
<P>
Kabbah on Friday refused the rebels' demand to free Sankoh as a
 condition to political settlement of the crisis, thus stalling
mediation efforts by some west African countries and the U.N. .
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, rebel spokesman Omrie Golley said Saturday the RUF
will go ahead with its one-week unilateral ceasefire starting from
Monday.
</P>
<P>
The rebels said they will resume their offensive if Sankoh is
not released at the end of the ceasefire.

A motion to that effect will soon be tabled in parliament, said
Moi at a rally in Nyahururu Town, Rift Valley Province in west
Kenya, according to a report available here.
</P>
<P>
He said that members of parliament should stick to and respect
the policies of the political parties on whose tickets they were
elected.
</P>
<P>
Lawmakers who want to form new parties should first resign and
seek new mandate from the electorate, he said.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, youthful members of parliament loyal to both the
ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) and the opposition
expressed desire to form a new political party.
</P>
<P>
On constitutional review, Moi called on stakeholders to come up
with a document aimed at uniting the nation.
</P>
<P>
Unless Kenyans approached the constitutional review debate
soberly and patriotically, no tangible result would be achieved,
warned Moi.

KUWAIT CITY -- U.S. President Bill Clinton has reiterated the
American policy to end the Iraqi crisis through helping topple the
current regime in Baghdad.
</P>
<P>
In an interview appeared in the London-based Arabic daily
Al-Sharq Al-Awsat's Saturday edition, Clinton said the best option
to resolve the Iraq crisis would be removal of Saddam Hussein's
regime.
</P>
<P>
The United States will boost support for the Iraqi oppositions
to this end, he said. But he ruled out the possibility of waging a
full-scale ground military operation to bring down Saddam.

<HEADLINE> Tourist Arrivals in Dubai Rise </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The number of tourists to the
United Arab Emirates' port city of Dubai reached 1,589,578 in the
first nine months last year, a rise of 18.67 percent compared with
the same period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
The latest figures released by the Department of Tourism and
Commerce Marketing (DTCM) in Dubai show tourists from other
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member states have grown
by a third in the first 10 months in 1998.
</P>
<P>
The GCC, a regional political and economic organization, groups
Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, the UAE and Qatar.
</P>
<P>
There was also a remarkable growth in the number of tourists
from the western countries, with those from Britain rising by
50.67 percent, Germany, 57.23 percent, France, 42.89 percent, the
United States, 51.83 percent and Australia and New Zealand, where
the DTCM established an office earlier last year, 99.69 percent.
</P>
<P>
The tourists from Asian and African countries registered a
steady increase of 10.36 percent.
</P>
<P>
The only market to have suffered a major slump was Russia, down
20.90 percent, mainly as a result of the economic meltdown there.
</P>
<P>
Despite the impact of the economic crisis in Russia and some
Asian states, Khalid A Bin Sulayem, director general of the DTCM,
is optimistic about the future of Dubai's tourist industry.
</P>
<P>
He predicted that 3 million visitors would make Dubai one of
their holiday destinations by the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
Outlining a number of initiatives to boost Dubai's tourism, Bin
Sulayem said exhibitions, roadshows, seminars and workshops will
be organized.

<HEADLINE> Italy Affirms its Stand on Ocalan Case </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Italian Foreign Minister Lamberto
Dini reaffirmed on Sunday that allowing Abdullah Ocalan to leave
Italy on his own was the only solution to a diplomatic incident
beginning last November.
</P>
<P>
Dini said he was satisfied with Ocalan's leaving on Saturday,
but did not tell where the Turkey-accused terrorist had finally
gone to.
</P>
<P>
Looking back over the last two months, Dini said that Europe
as a whole "was hurt by this affair."
</P>
<P>
Italy, he recalled, had investigated all possible options but
to no avail.
</P>
<P>
The only thing Italy could do, Dini said, "was to handle the
matter through the application of its own laws and obligations to
international treaties."
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK) leader left Rome
by a private jet for Russia Saturday afternoon, but there has
been no confirmation of this from Russia.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested in Rome on November 12 last year under
international arrest warrants issued by Germany and Turkey after
he arrived on a flight from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
But later Germany said that it would not seek to extradite
Ocalan to Germany, for fear of sparking unrest between its own
Kurdish and Turkish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish extradition request accused Ocalan of
terrorism-related crimes, saying that he was responsible for more
than 30,000 deaths during his 15-year armed struggle for a
Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey's extradition was ruled out by Italian law and thus
caused the rift between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
To resolve it, Italy and Germany agreed on 27 November that
Ocalan should be tried by an international tribunal supported by
the European Union (EU). But until now, no member of EU has been
willing to host the trial.
</P>
<P>
The Rome Appeals Court lifted on December 16 travel restricti
on on Ocalan, and on December 23, Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema announced that Ocalan could leave Italy "to go wherever
he wants."

<HEADLINE> Chinese Film-makers Hit Hollywood </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The first Chinese film outfit
to hit Hollywood is to shoot its debut film called "The Sky of
Los Angeles".
</P>
<P>
The Guangdong Superstar Film Company will produce what is
described as a light comedy based on the loves, hates, happiness
and conflicts of a new generation of Chinese and other immigrants
living in the world's best fantasy land.
</P>
<P>
It will depict both Chinese and American characteristics which
the company hopes will attract audiences from all the different
cultures.
</P>
<P>
Deng Jianguo, the company's general manager, said that all the
actors, and actresses will be American or Chinese Americans, and
he has recruited Hollywood experts to handle the script writing
Chinese and English sound recording, film editing and lighting.
</P>
<P>
Film buffs are convinced the project will not only demonstrate
that the Chinese film industry has started to exploit the
American market but also remark that this is the first time that
Chinese cash has been used in conjunction with American movie
making expertise.
</P>
<P>
Deng said he was aware he was taking a risk by putting a toe
in the American film industry but that he can learn a lot about
film-making by doing so, while on the other hand, it will enable
him to introduce China to other countries.
</P>
<P>
The company is one of the two biggest independent film
companies in China with assets of some 100 millions yuan; the
other is the Beijing Forbidden City Film Company. The company has
so far made three films and dozens of TV programs in the recent
years, one of it notable successes being "The Stories of
Guangzhou".

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Netanyahu's Election Economics?  (by Tan Xinmu) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel's inflation rate in
1998 ended up at 8.6 percent, within the target range of 7 to 10
percent, after the consumer price index (CPI) rose by a slight 0.1
percent in December, official statistics showed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate and slowed-down CPI growth strengthened the
belief of economists here that the initial inflation target of 4
percent for 1999 is likely, according to local media.
</P>
<P>
The statistics cast doubts on the necessity of a plan announced
by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a few days ago to raise the
inflation target for this year.
</P>
<P>
The inflation in 1998, 1.6 percent higher than in 1997, was
lower than what many economists had predicted last October, when
the monthly CPI rose by a record decade high of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The record monthly CPI surge was triggered by a sharp
devaluation of the Israeli currency shekel, a result of the
turmoil in the international financial market and speculations in
Israel's foreign exchange business.
</P>
<P>
At that time, experts said the inflation rate would possibly
hit 9 to 11 percent. Not a few economists and cabinet ministers
have said the government's inflation target for 1999 was also
unrealistic and had to be raised.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Bank of Israel, Jacob Frenkel, who was forced to
raise the interest rate twice in two weeks in an effort to curb
the depreciation of the shekel, insisted however that the 1999
inflation target is attainable.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu supported Frenkel's position at that time.
</P>
<P>
But after higher interest rate lowered the CPI growth in two
consecutive months, which was at 1.3 percent in November,
Netanyahu surprisingly announced 10 days ago that this year's
inflation target will soon be raised.
</P>
<P>
The plan immediately drew wide criticism from officials and
economists as well as opposition parties, who saw the move as an
election strategy aimed at inspiring a spurt of growth before
voters go to the polls in May.
</P>
<P>
Central bank officials have warned that such a move would hurt
Israel's standing on world markets, undermine the public faith in
government economic policy and risk the danger that the inflation
might grow out of control.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the May 17 election date was set, many Israelis
expressed concern that during a five-month long election period,
the government's decision-making would be affected by the ruling
party's campaign goals.
</P>
<P>
They feared that the government would take short-term measures
which would help boost its image before the elections at the cost
of impairing long-term interest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Netanyahu dismissed opposition claims that the plan
was his "election economics."
</P>
<P>
"Every correct economic decision I make, you're going to say
is election economics. Because of this I won't do it? I will do
it, elections or no elections," he said.

<HEADLINE> Turkey's Minority Government Wins Confidence Vote </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkey's newly formed
pro-secular minority government won a vote of confidence in the
parliament here Sunday, thus ending the near two-month-old
political crisis in the country.
</P>
<P>
The government led by the Democratic Left Party (DSP) leader
Bulent Ecevit obtained 306 votes in the 550-seat parliament, which
is regarded a clear victory for the veteran politician.
</P>
<P>
The DSP minority government was supported by the Motherland
Party (ANAP) and the True Path Party (DYP) from outside.
</P>
<P>
In Sunday's vote, 188 deputies mostly from the pro-Islamic
Virtue Party (FP) and the Republican People's Party (CHP) voted
against the government.
</P>
<P>
A total of 495 deputies participated in the vote in the
parliament.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit was reassigned by President Suleyman Demirel to form the
56th government on Janaury 7, one day after independent lawmaker
and Industry and Trade Minister Yalim Erez returned his mandate.
</P>
<P>
The previous government, led by leader of the Motherland Party
Mesut Yilmaz, collapsed in November in a no-confidence vote in
the parliament because of corruption scandals.
</P>
<P>
Demirel bucked at appointing the leader of the largest party in
the parliament to form a cabinet because such an appointment will
bring the pro-fundamentalists to power, thus angering the
pro-secular military.
</P>
<P>
Ecevit served as prime minister in 1974 when the Turkish
government landed its troops and took over the northern third of
Cyprus, in the wake of an abortive pro-Greece coup.

<HEADLINE> Semiconductor Suppliers Base Research in China </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China is becoming a huge
outlet for the world's semiconductor industry, with research and
product development as the focus.
</P>
<P>
Motorola Semiconductor Products Sector, the leading
manufacturer of embedded silicon solutions, recently opened its
China Predictive Technology Laboratory, a research operation
designed to improve state-of-the-art silicon processes.
</P>
<P>
The new lab has been established to develop a comprehensive
predictive system which will conduct process simulation and
device simulation based on the JAVA platform to shorten the
integrated circuit design cycle and reduce costs, said Barry
Johnson, corporate vice-president of Motorola.
</P>
<P>
The lab is the first to be solely funded in China by a major
semiconductor manufacturer involved in research.
</P>
<P>
Motorola already has comprehensive research, development and
production bases in the major northeastern port city of Tianjin
and in the eastern city of Suzhou. It has also invested 280
million U.S. dollars in a joint venture in southwest China's
Leshan city. The semiconductor products of the firm will be
marketed internationally.
</P>
<P>
Many other large semiconductor suppliers have also marked
China out as an important production and research center.
</P>
<P>
NEC of Japan set up a 29.99-million-dollar worth joint venture
in Beijing last May. The new company is expected to design 200
kinds of integrated circuits annually starting from February.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Japan's Fujitsu established its largest overseas
research outlet in Beijing last October.

<HEADLINE> New Evidence Proves Infamous Nanjing Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Evidence which proves that
the verdict of a Japanese court dismissing proof of the infamous
Nanjing Massacre in 1937, which was recorded in a war-time diary
by Shiro Azuma, a Japanese WWII veteran who was mis-directed, has
been made public by a collector of maps in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Shiro was a soldier in the Japanese brigade that captured
Nanjing, then China's capital, in December of 1937. In the
following weeks they killed more than 300,000 unarmed Chinese
soldiers and civilians and he recorded the atrocities in a secret
diary.
</P>
<P>
He published this diary in April 1996 and was promptly sued by
a former soldier named in it who was described as a war criminal.
The Tokyo Higher Court ruled in this man's favor and instructed
that his name should not be made known or any action taken
against him.
</P>
<P>
An appeal by Shiro, who feels justice should be done, to a
higher court was rejected last month.
</P>
<P>
However, Xu Youqun, a Shanghai citizen whose hobby is
collecting old maps, said that one in his collection could help
reverse the Japanese court's verdict.
</P>
<P>
The map, 79 cm x 55 cm and in 1:20,000 scale, which featured
the city of Nanjing in the 1930s, showed that there were three
ponds in front of the then Nanjing Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
In his diary, Shiro claimed that the man who sued him took
part in an atrocity which involved forcing a Chinese civilian
into a sack soaked with gasoline onto which was tied grenades,
and then lighting the bag and kicking it into one of the ponds
before the Nanjing court.
</P>
<P>
However, the Tokyo Higher Court ruled that there had never
been any ponds in front of the Nanjing Supreme Court in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
"According to my map, the ponds did exist at that time, and
they were quite large," said the 51-year-old Xu, who started
searching in his collection after reading newspaper reports on
the Shiro case.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Xu said, the map was published by a Japanese
bookstore in Shanghai in the 1930s and 40s.
</P>
<P>
A local historian said that Xu's map isn't old enough to becom
e a rare collectors' item as there must be similar copies in
Japanese libraries and museums.
</P>
<P>
"I really can't understand why the Japanese court should hand
down this verdict without seeking any reference to the historical
records," said the historian.

<HEADLINE> Crack Anti-Smuggling Squad Proves Its Worth in Xiamen </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
XIAMEN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A new crack anti-smuggling
squad in Xiamen, a major port in east China's Fujian Province,
said today it seized a haul of cigarettes worth 20 million yuan
on a boat Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese fishing boat, called Minshi No. 2822, was loaded
with some 4,000 cases of "555", "Hongtashan", "Ashima" and
"Peony" cigarettes.
</P>
<P>
The crew made an attempt to escape when customs police came
upon it early Saturday morning but was soon brought to a stop
after police fired warning shots across the boat's bow.
</P>
<P>
The boat, registered in the province's Shishi city, had sailed
to the Philippines to pick up the contraband, according to the
squad which was only established on Saturday morning.
</P>
<P>
The Xiamen customs team has an important role to play in
preventing smuggling in China and last year seized 1.08 billion
yuan worth of goods in 45 smuggling cases.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Attacks Italy over PKK Leader's Departure </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Turkish Foreign Ministry Sunday
attacked the Italian government for allowing Kurdish rebel leader
Abdullah Ocalan to depart from Rome to Russia.
</P>
<P>
Foreign Ministry Deputy Undersecretary Faruk Logoglu summoned
Italian Ambassador to Ankara, Massimilliano Bandini, Sunday
morning for 30 minutes to condemn the Italian move.
</P>
<P>
Lagoglu called Italy's action as "contrary to the international
agreements."
</P>
<P>
However, Bandini said that he had received "no message" from
the Italian government on Ocalan's departure from Rome, adding he
did not know where Ocalan went.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that accompanied by Italian policemen, Ocalan
left his villa in the town of Infernetto, 30 kilometers south of
Rome, and took a plane from Rome's military airport Ciampino to
Moscow around 13:00 local time (1200 GMT) on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan, who was sought after by Turkey, was arrested in Rome on
November 12 last year under international arrest warrants issued
by Germany and Turkey after he arrived on a flight from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
But Germany said later that it will not seek extradition of
Ocalan for fear of sparking unrest between its own Kurdish and
Turkish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish extradition request charged Ocalan with a long list
of terrorism-related crimes. Turkey blames Ocalan for the over
30,000 deaths during his 15-year armed struggle as leader of the
outlawed Kurdish Workers Party for a Kurdish homeland in
southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Relations between Italy and Turkey rifted after Italy rejected
Turkey's extradition request on account of Italian law, which
forbids extradition to countries where the death penalty is in
force.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh Group Urges Lifting Sanctions on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- A citizens' group in Bangladesh
on Sunday urged United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan to
lift sanctions against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In an open letter addressed to Annan, the group condemned the
missile attacks against Iraq by the United States and Britain last
month, on the eve of Ramadan, the holy month of Muslims all over
the world.
</P>
<P>
The two countries, both members of the U.N. Security Council,
launched the attacks in the name of the U.N., but the "action did
not represent the will of the international community," said the
group, which consists of some 20 well-known scholars in the
country, including National Professor Kabir Chowdhury.
</P>
<P>
"Not only was it unjustified and vengeful, it was against the
charter of the U.N. because the U.S.A and its ally Britain acted
without consulting all members of the Security Council," the group
said, accusing the U.S. of using the U.N. "to advance its own
agenda."
</P>
<P>
"We... condemn in the strongest terms American and British
action in Iraq and protest against America's subversion of the
world body and the moral basis of its authority," said the letter.
</P>
<P>
"It is felt by most decent nations in the world that the
sanctions originally designed to punish President Saddam Hussain
for his invasion of Kuwait (in 1990) have continued too long," the
letter said.
</P>
<P>
By preventing Iraq indefinitely from resuming its normal
economic life and commerce with the world, the sanctions "are
subjecting Iraq's men, women and children to starvation,
malnutrition, disease and death in large numbers," it noted.
</P>
<P>
"Also absurd is that ... the aim of a 'complete' eradication of
its potential to make certain weapons is not realizable without
compelling it (Iraq) to return to a pre-technological age," said
letter.
</P>
<P>
"The economic sanctions and the interminable search for weapons
by UNSCOM under its chairman Richard Butler have turned the U.N.'s
business in Iraq into a genocidal project aimed at the physical
and intellectual annihilation of a people," the letter said.
</P>
<P>
The group demanded an immediate end to the sanctions, and
called on the world community to make efforts to end the Iraq
crisis "in a way consistent with the ideals of the United
Nations."

<HEADLINE> China's Private Firms Now Tackle International Market (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China's private firms are now
allowed to compete directly on the international market and from
the start of the year, 20 private twenty companies were given the
go ahead to engage independently in exporting and importing
without the need for official approval.
</P>
<P>
"We are ready for the competition." said Yan Aimin who is
deputy general manager of the Shanghai-based Zhonglu Industrial
Co. Ltd., one of the world's leading bowling equipment
manufacturers.
</P>
<P>
Shortly after the company was allocated its trade license, it
signed letters of intent to export bowling equipment valued at
over 10 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, China's leading educational software producer
Clever Software (Group) Co. will now market its Chinese language
programs in Singapore. They are also planning to promote
throughout China educational software for children developed by
Davidson, the biggest educational software company of the United
States.
</P>
<P>
Including Zhonglu and Clever Software, the registered capital
of the 20 private manufacturers totals 1.36 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
They are engaged in such industries as animal feed,
foodstuffs, agricultural development, medicines, metallurgical
products, construction materials, textiles, garment manufacture
and retailing, light industry, electronics and machinery and
computer software development.
</P>
<P>
People in the sector said that China's private firms have now
broken the trading monopoly of state-owned enterprises and
believe this will be good for exports this year.

<HEADLINE> China's Private Firms Now Tackle International Market (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Sun Zhenyu, vice-minister of foreign trade and economic
cooperation, said the government wanted to encourage efficient
companies to break into the international market and create a
good impression.
</P>
<P>
Now, China is introducing a special licensing registration
system for those involved in foreign trade which will help bring
them in line with international standards and which will be
helpful in the country's bid to become a member of the World
Trade Organization, according to Feng Yuan, a research fellow
with the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
</P>
<P>
The 15th National Congress of the Communist Party of China
(CPC) declared it would encourage and develop non-state
businesses.
</P>
<P>
"Granting flexible trade rights is one of the mainstays of
doing this," said Liu Yonghao, president of China's largest
animal feed producer, the Hope Group. It was, he said, an
affirmation, encouragement, and an injection of confidence in the
sector.
</P>
<P>
Currently, China has approximately 30 million private firms,
with a combined registered capital exceeding 900 billion yuan.
Many economic pundits believe they can easily adapt to the
international market to become a new growth point in China's
foreign trade.
</P>
<P>
Fuxing Industrial Co. Ltd., a private firm in Shanghai, has
invested over 30 million yuan in developing a new medicine but
tapping the domestic market will not give it enough returns for
its investments. "We need to create an overseas market," said its
general manager Wang Qunbin.
</P>
<P>
However, some business experts warn that because the majority
of private firms are comparatively small and have less technology
and perhaps management skills, it will not be easy for them to
break into the overseas markets.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Corporation is
planning to offer training for the twenty selected firms to help
them familiarize themselves with trade policies and practices.
</P>
<P>
As more private firms are applying for foreign trade approval,
the ministry said that there will be no ceiling to the number of
manufacturing companies given such permission.

<HEADLINE> IMF to Finalize Discussions on Debt Forgiveness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Managing Director of the
International Monetary Fund (IMF), Michel Camdessus, will arrive
in Nigeria next Tuesday to finalize discussions with the Nigerian
government on possible debt forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
A monitoring team led by Hiroyuku Hine, senior adviser for IMF
African Department, is already in the country, according to a
Sunday Punch report.
</P>
<P>
Sources close to the team said meetings between the team and
the government had been held to monitor the level of the country's
conformity with conditions given by IMF for Nigeria to qualify for
debt forgiveness.
</P>
<P>
The conditions for debt forgiveness include a merger of the
dual exchange rate and a deregulation of the nation's oil
industry.
</P>
<P>
In his 1999 budget broadcast, Nigerian Head of State General
Abdulsalam Abubakar announced on January 1 the abolition of the
dual exchange rate and the deregulation of the oil industry.
</P>
<P>
During a meeting with the Special Adviser to the Head of State
on Petroleum Matter, Aret Adams, the monitoring team said
Nigeria's 1999 budget was a good one as the budget had already
taken care of the two issues.
</P>
<P>
Discussions between the IMF and Nigeria began last year
following the visit to the United States by General Abubakar last
September.
</P>
<P>
After that visit during which Nigeria has established contacts
with the IMF and the Paris Club, a group of foreign creditor
countries, Nigerian Finance Minister Mallam Ismaila Usman followed
up with discussions with the two bodies.
</P>
<P>
The Nigeria's external debt stands at about 28 billion U.S.
Dollars and the Nigerian government has been soliciting for loan
relief from international financial institutions following the
falling price of petroleum products at the world oil market.
</P>
<P>
The head of the monitoring team said last Thursday that the IMF
hinged the possibility of loan rescheduling for Nigeria on the
successful implementation of economic policies enunciated in this
year's budget.
</P>
<P>
He expressed concern at the level of corruption in Nigeria,
saying that the international community, especially financial
institutions would want to see a reduction in corruption in
Nigeria.

<HEADLINE> China Seized 7,000 Kg of Drugs Last Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese border police seized
more than 7,000 kg of drugs and arrested 1,253 people involved in
such illegal activities last year.
</P>
<P>
Ministry of Public Security sources told Xinhua that some
1,168 cases were handled and the drugs included 2,508 kg of
heroin, 325 kg of opium, 195 kg of "ice", 4,400 kg of marijuana
and other assorted drugs in addition to 48 tons of chemical
materials that could be used to manufacture drugs.
</P>
<P>
They said that drug related crime is rampant in southwest
China's Yunnan province and Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region and
is now sweeping into the eastern coastal regions.
</P>
<P>
Drug traffickers have various sophisticated ways of hiding
their contraband such as in petrol tankers and even using human
carriers who swallow plastic bags full of drugs which are later
excreted or regurgitated.
</P>
<P>
Major incidents included one involving the smuggling of 133 kg
heroin in a truck in Yunnan and of 4,400 kg of marijuana carried
in boat in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
Police have intensified their fight against drug trafficking
by increasing the number of staff in the search squads, using
more boats and boosting the frequency of patrols.

<HEADLINE> Colombo Port Traffic Falls in 1998 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
COLOMBO, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Transshipment traffic at
Colombo Port fell last year after two years of record growth, Sri
Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The port, South Asia's transshipment hub, handled 1.19 million
transshipment containers last year, down 3.4 per cent from the
previous year's 1.23 million boxes, said the officials.
</P>
<P>
They attributed the falling traffic to the disruption of normal
trading patterns by the Asian economic crisis.
</P>
<P>
Total container volumes, however, rose slightly from 1.68
million TEUs (Twenty foot Equivalent Units) to 1.71 million TEUs.
</P>
<P>
The negative growth in transshipment volumes came after two
years of rapid growth which propelled the port into the top 25 in
the world league of container ports.
</P>
<P>
The port exceeded its designed container capacity of 1.6
million TEUs a year in 1997, with over 20 percent annual increases
in cargo handling during the previous two years.
</P>
<P>
SLPA officials admitted that Colombo port, almost astride the
main east-west sealane across the Indian Ocean, can no longer rely
on its geographic advantage as competition is hotting up.
</P>
<P>
Colombo is facing a further threat once its competitor, the
newly commissioned Port Raysut container terminal in Salalah, Oman
adds more berths to the existing two there.
</P>
<P>
To counter the slowdown in cargo traffic, the SLPA has set up a
marketing research and intelligence unit while the Ministry of
Port Development recently established an advisory council to
monitor competition and work out ways to improve efficiency and
attract more cargoes.

<HEADLINE> Seoul's Usable Foreign Reserves Up to 52 Billion U.S. Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, January 17 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's usable foreign
exchange reserves rose to 52.51 billion U.S. dollars as of last
Friday from last year's 48.51 billion U.S. dollars, the Bank of
Korea said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The rise of usable foreign exchange reserves was attributed
mainly to domestic banks' brisk repayment of foreign
currency-denominated debt to the central bank, a continued
current account surplus and active introduction of foreign funds.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the appreciation of the Japanese yen also help S
outh Korean foreign currency reserves up.
</P>
<P>
So far South Korean financial institutions, which were loaned
23.29 billion U.S. dollars at the peak of the nation's financial
crisis caused by corporate bankruptcies and bad loans of
financial institutions in late 1997, have repaid a total of 20.12
billion U.S. dollars with only 3.17 billion U.S. dollars left.
</P>
<P>
Earlier this month, South Korea also returned 1.06 billion
U.S. dollars in rescue loans extended by the International
Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
The repayment reflected the fact that the nation now has
enough foreign reserves to meet international obligations and to
defend itself from possible attacks on the local currency, said
the bank.
</P>
<P>
Thanks to the effective economic measures taken by Kim
Dae-jung government since last February, South Korea's usable
foreign exchange reserves gradually increased from 12.36 billion
U.S. dollars at the end of 1997, to 43.37 billion U.S. dollars
last September and then to 48.51 billion U.S. dollar last
December.

<HEADLINE> Zambian Govt Urged to Improve Mining Management </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January (Xinhua) -- More and more Zambian women are
digging in small-scale mining, much of the activity is illegal, as
the government has been urged to improve mining management in the
country.
</P>
<P>
It was learned from the newly formed Association of Women
Miners Sunday, about 3,000 women have joined the association with
only 43 licensed by the mines ministry.
</P>
<P>
Chairperson of the association, Namakau Kaingu, said they are
digging for emerald, tourmaline, aquamarine, amethyst, gypsum and
gold as an alternative source of income and employment.
</P>
<P>
The restructuring of the economy has led to massive loss of
formal employment, mostly among women. According to the Zambian
Central Statistical Office, between March 1992 and June 1994, the
unemployment rate for women rose by 21 percent, compared with only
six percent for men.
</P>
<P>
The shrinking formal market has led many to venture into self-
employment. Women are discovering that small-scale mining is the
next best option to earn a living. The women miners are working
hard to take care of their families, Kaingu said.
</P>
<P>
There is a high degree of unproductive mining being conducted
by the women because of their ignorance of technical aspects,
which means that some miners make huge losses, she said.
</P>
<P>
In addition, there are problems of inadequate information on
marketing their stones, such as extremely low prices, or high
commission during their transactions for the middlemen, she said.
</P>
<P>
At a recent meeting held in Lusaka, the women recommended that
the government should encourage more women to study mining at the
country's universities, establish a revolving fund to offer soft
loans, speed up processing of mining licences and rights, and
improve transport and communication especially in rural areas.
</P>
<P>
Professor, Uzo Mokhunye, director of the United Nations
University Institute for Natural Resources in Africa which
organized the meeting, believes women miners, given adequate
support, can contribute to economic growth, improve social
infrastructure, curb rural-urban drift and increase tax revenue.
</P>
<P>
Kaingu also calls for cooperation among stake-holders to
resolve the problems. She said "There is need for concerted
efforts from the public, the miners, the government and donors."

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Netanyahu's Election Economics? </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Israel's inflation rate in
1998 ended up at 8.6 percent, within the target range of 7 to 10
percent, after the consumer price index (CPI) rose by a slight 0.1
percent in December, official statistics showed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The inflation rate and slowed-down CPI growth strengthened the
belief of economists here that the initial inflation target of 4
percent for 1999 is likely, according to local media.
</P>
<P>
The statistics cast doubts on the necessity of a plan announced
by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu a few days ago to raise the
inflation target for this year.
</P>
<P>
The inflation in 1998, 1.6 percent higher than in 1997, was
lower than what many economists had predicted last October, when
the monthly CPI rose by a record decade high of 3 percent.
</P>
<P>
The record monthly CPI surge was triggered by a sharp
devaluation of the Israeli currency shekel, a result of the
turmoil in the international financial market and speculations in
Israel's foreign exchange business.
</P>
<P>
At that time, experts said the inflation rate would possibly
hit 9 to 11 percent. Not a few economists and cabinet ministers
have said the government's inflation target for 1999 was also
unrealistic and had to be raised.
</P>
<P>
Governor of Bank of Israel, Jacob Frenkel, who was forced to
raise the interest rate twice in two weeks in an effort to curb
the depreciation of the shekel, insisted however that the 1999
inflation target is attainable.
</P>
<P>
Netanyahu supported Frenkel's position at that time.
</P>
<P>
But after higher interest rate, 1.3 percent in November, has
lowered the CPI growth in two consecutive months, Netanyahu
surprisingly announced 10 days ago that this year's inflation
target will soon be raised.
</P>
<P>
The plan immediately drew wide criticism from officials and
economists as well as opposition parties, who saw the move as an
election strategy aimed at inspiring a spurt of growth before
voters go to the polls in May.
</P>
<P>
Central bank officials have warned that such a move would hurt
Israel's standing on world markets, undermine the public faith in
government economic policy and risk the danger that the inflation
might grow out of control.
</P>
<P>
Soon after the May 17 election date was set, many Israelis
expressed concern that during a five-month long election period,
the government's decision-making would be affected by the ruling
party's campaign goals.
</P>
<P>
They feared that the government would take short-term measures
which would help boost its image before the elections at the cost
of impairing long-term interest of the country.
</P>
<P>
Last week, Netanyahu dismissed opposition claims that the plan
was his "election economics."
</P>
<P>
"Every correct economic decision I make, you're going to say
is election economics. Because of this I won't do it? I will do
it, elections or no elections," he said.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Map Collector Challenges Japanese Court     Verdict Against Nanjing Massacre Witness </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Evidence which proves that
the verdict of a Japanese court dismissing proof of the infamous
Nanjing Massacre in 1937, which was recorded in a war-time diary
by Shiro Azuma, a Japanese WWII veteran who was mis-directed, has
been made public by a collector of maps in Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
Shiro was a soldier in the Japanese brigade that captured
Nanjing, then China's capital, in December of 1937. In the
following weeks they killed more than 300,000 unarmed Chinese
soldiers and civilians and he recorded the atrocities in a secret
diary.
</P>
<P>
He published this diary in April 1996 and was promptly sued by
a former soldier named in it who was described as a war criminal.
The Tokyo Higher Court ruled in this man's favor and instructed
that his name should not be made known or any action taken
against him.
</P>
<P>
An appeal by Shiro, who feels justice should be done, to a
higher court was rejected last month.
</P>
<P>
However, Xu Youqun, a Shanghai citizen whose hobby is
collecting old maps, said that one in his collection could help
reverse the Japanese court's verdict.
</P>
<P>
The map, which featured the city of Nanjing in the 1930s,
showed that there were three ponds in front of the then Nanjing
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
In his diary, Shiro claimed that the man who sued him took
part in an atrocity which involved forcing a Chinese civilian
into a sack soaked with gasoline onto which was tied grenades,
and then lighting the bag and kicking it into one of the ponds
before the Nanjing court.
</P>
<P>
However, the Tokyo Higher Court ruled that there had never
been any ponds in front of the Nanjing Supreme Court in the 1930s.
</P>
<P>
"According to my map, the ponds did exist at that time, and
they were quite large," said the 51-year-old Xu, who started
searching in his collection after reading newspaper reports on
the Shiro case.
</P>
<P>
Ironically, Xu said, the map was published by a Japanese
bookstore in Shanghai in the 1930s and 40s.
</P>
<P>
A local historian said that Xu's map isn't old enough to
become a rare collectors' item as there must be similar copies in
Japanese libraries and museums.
</P>
<P>
"I really can't understand why the Japanese court should hand
down this verdict without seeking any reference to the historical
records," said the historian.

<HEADLINE>   China Dominate FESPIC Games </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 17 (Xinhua)-- Chinese athletes came away with
nearly half of the gold medals at stake as the week-long Far East
South Pacific (FESPIC) Games came to an end here on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese team tallied up 340 medals as they won 205 of the
464 gold medals awarded in 15 sports together with 90 silvers and
45 bronze medals.
</P>
<P>
Most of China's haul of golds came from track and field and
the pool in the Games which involved 2,430 athletes from 34
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
Chinese competitors grabbed 106 golds and smashed nine world
records in the athletics held in the Thammasat University stadium
that hosted Asian Games track and field last year.
</P>
<P>
Hosts Thailand, who had hoped for 30 golds before the Games,
grabbed the second place in the medals table with a 65-73-82
record, ahead of Australia, South Korea, Hong Kong of China and
Japan.
</P>
<P>
Many of the FESPIC sports like tennis, table tennis, shooting,
athletics and basketball had similar rules to those for
able-bodied athletes, changed only to take into account the
disabilities of the athletes.
</P>
<P>
Organizers billed the Games as a chance to show that disabled
people had as much potential as the able-bodied and should not be
treated any differently.

<HEADLINE> Philippines to Crack Down on Housing Syndicates </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Joseph
Estrada has vowed to crack down on professional squatter
syndicates that profit from the government's low-cost housing
program at the expense of the truly homeless, the Philippines News
Agency reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Estrada said his administration is gathering evidence against
these syndicates so they can be prosecuted and hauled to jail.
</P>
<P>
"I'm warning the leaders of these rings that I have had them
placed under surveillance," he was quoted as saying. "Once we have
enough evidence, we will send them to jail."
</P>
<P>
Estrada said these syndicates prey on the poor by acquiring the
resettlement lots first, then renting them out to the intended
beneficiaries of the government's housing program.
</P>
<P>
"This is really bad. These syndicates exploit our poor. They
also exploit our government program," he said.
</P>
<P>
According to government housing officials, these syndicates
wait for announcements of new relocation sites and then occupy the
lots.

<HEADLINE> Serbs Accuses OSCE Monitors of Lying About Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Serbian President Milan
Milutinovic on Sunday accused the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) monitors in Kosovo of lying about a
massacre of dozens of ethnic Albanian civilians.
</P>
<P>
In a strongly-worded statement against William Walker, who
heads the OSCE's verification mission in the separatist Serbian
province, Milutinovic said: "Relying on a heap of lies and
make-believe, he has made accusations against the organs of our
state so as to divert attention from terrorists and kidnappers
and once again to bring those people under his protection."
</P>
<P>
The statement, released early Sunday morning, came just hours
before NATO ambassadors were expected to convene in Brussels to
frame a response to the massacre.
</P>
<P>
According to a report carried by the Tanjug news agency, the
American diplomat Walker claimed late Saturday night that the
Serbia police force had killed 45 ethnic Albanian civilians in
the village of Racak, some 30 kilometers south of Pristina, on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
"From what I personally saw I do not hesitate to describe the
event as a massacre -- obviously a crime very much against
humanity," he told a press conference in the provincial capital
of Kosovo, Pristina, and demanded that the U.N. war crimes
tribunal in the Hague send investigators to the scene within 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
Milutinovic said in his statement that the Serbian police went
to the village of Racak on Friday in search for the killers of a
Serb policeman who was found dead five days ago. Albanian
separatists opened fire at the police and the police had to fight
back.
</P>
<P>
The Serbian President blasted Walker for neglecting the fact
and fabricating the horrible lies that the Serbian police force
had massacred Albanian civilians.

<HEADLINE> Brazil Events Unlikely Derail Philippines Recovery </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' economic
recovery is not expected to be derailed by the recent events in
Brazil and the recovery process in Asia is unlikely to be
fundamentally reversed, an official of the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) said.
</P>
<P>
Henri Lorie, IMF representative to the Philippines, was quoted
Sunday by government officials as saying, "In my own view,
Brazil's devaluation should not have lasting effects on the
currency and financial markets in the Philippines."
</P>
<P>
"In fact, there are now tangible gains in the macro and
structural reform areas in the Asian region, including the
Philippines, which ought to make investors more discriminating,"
he added.
</P>
<P>
Gabriel C. Singson, governor of the Central Bank of the
Philippines, said the country is not likely to be adversely
affected for long by the Brazilian situation.
</P>
<P>
"The contagion effect is now very limited," he added.

<HEADLINE> Saddam Calls for Forming New Grouping to Balance </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi President Saddam Hussein
on Sunday called on Asian and African countries to set up a new
grouping to balance the existing western alliances led by the
United States.
</P>
<P>
In a nationally televised address on the 8th anniversary of
the 1991 Gulf War, Saddam called for an institutional gathering of
"willing member-states" of the world "to establish a serious
cooperation in economic, political and military fields to maintain
balance, realize peace beginning in Asia."
</P>
<P>
Saddam assailed the U.S. and its western allies for the
maintenance and eastward expansion of the North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO).
</P>
<P>
"America, Britain and Zionism (Israel) ... have become a threat
to the security and stability of the world and its international
and regional interests at large," said Saddam.
</P>
<P>
The Iraqi president again took the chance to blast the
"intrigues" of some Arab rulers "who are of similar nature to
those enemies."
</P>
<P>
Saddam described the mid-December U.S.-British air raids
against Iraq as the day of triumph for his regime, saying the
bombardment exposed the scheme of the enemies.
</P>
<P>
He hailed the steadfastness of the Iraqi people, saying the
eight-year-old crippling United Nations sanctions, imposed on the
country following its 1990 invasion of Kuwait, has caused
"incomparable damages" to Iraq.

Estrada has rejected a proposal for a 10-percent across-the-board

Estrada made the decision during last Friday's meeting of the

Estrada was quoted as saying the pursuit of trade
liberalization is in line with the government's commitments with
the World Trade Organization, the Asia-Pacific Economic
Cooperation and the Free Trade Agreement of the Association of
Southeast Asian Nations.
</P>
<P>
However, he said exemptions were made for a few industries
after public hearings and consultations showed that they needed
temporary tariff changes to help them compete during the Asian
economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Zambian President Gives Tips to New Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambian President Frederick
Chiluba said Zambia would be a success story if local government
councilors became aggressive in implementing their programs.
</P>
<P>
Opening a two-day orientation seminar for newly-elected
councilors in Lusaka Saturday, the president also warned that he
would not tolerate any confusion in councils.
</P>
<P>
He said councilors must be resourceful and enterprising in
their various areas and not always expect to be given money to
carry out their programs, Zambian newspaper Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Chiluba said that the development coordination committee
institutional framework that already existed in districts must be
strengthened and made fully operational.
</P>
<P>
"This will provide for proper planning and implementation of
development projects and programs," he said.
</P>
<P>
In warning the over 1,000 councilors Chiluba said he would not
tolerate any confusion in the councils and would take stern action
against any councillor who misbehaved.
</P>
<P>
He said local government was an important wing of central
government that provided for participation of local communities in
decision-making and democratization of Zambia's political system.
</P>
<P>
The seminar is sponsored by the United Nations Development
Programs (UNDP).

<HEADLINE>   ATP Players Plan to Increase Drug Ban </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The ATP Players Council
planned to seek a ban of two years up from a current 12 months,
for any of its players found guilty a first time of using a Class
One drug when they met before the Australian Open in Melbourne, Au
stralia, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
An ATP spokesman said the recommendation will be passed onto
the ATP Board, which is possible to ratify it as policy to go
before the International Tennis Federation.
</P>
<P>
The move follows controversy over reigning Australian Open ch
ampion Petr Korda's positive test to the steroid nanrolene at
last year's Wimbledon.
</P>
<P>
The Czech player was not banned and was docked the prize
money and computer rankings points he earned at Wimbledon after
satisfying the independent appeals committee of the ITF that
there were exceptional circumstances surrounding his positive
drug test.
</P>
<P>
The ITF decided to challenge its own appeal committee's
decision, saying it may have misapplied the rule not to impose
the current 12-month ban for the Class One drug offence.
</P>
<P>
The Court of Arbitration for Sport in Lausanne is to rule on
the appeal.
</P>
<P>
Class One drugs include anabolic steroids, diuretics,
hormones and physical manipulation of urine testing samples.
</P>
<P>
The ITF, ATP and WTA all have 12-month bans in place for the
first positive test of a Class One drug. A second positive test
now carries a permanent suspension.

KAMPALA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan Vice President Specioza
Kazibwe has put up a spirited defense of her innocence in the
valley dams scandal in which an estimated 3.4 billion Shillings
(3.4 million U.S. Dollars) was reportedly missing.
</P>
<P>
She made the defense on a popular radio talk show here
Saturday, the New Vision paper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Kazibwe, who is also the Minister of Agriculture, Animal
Industry and Fisheries, stuck to her guns on the controversial
valley dams issue when answering all the panelists' queries and
callers' questions.
</P>
<P>
The vice president denied benefiting from the valley dams money
but blamed El-Nino, lack of funds and an expert technical team to
construct the 100 dams earlier proposed by President Yoweri
Museveni.
</P>
<P>
Some MPs are hounding her because she is a woman, she noted,
and they can't believe that a woman can give them directives.
</P>
<P>
She offered resignation if proved to have failed to supervise
the lost funds.
</P>
<P>
The valley dams scandal, in which the contractors are alleged
to have eaten money and failed to build the dams, has hit
headlines in this country which is also gripped by big scandals in
the privatization process.

<HEADLINE> National Bank of Ethiopia Starts Export Credit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The National Bank of
Ethiopia has announced that it will establish an export credit
guarantee scheme aimed at streamlining the activities of private
investors engaged in foreign trade sector.
</P>
<P>
According to Sunday's Ethiopian Herald, Governor of the Bank
Tekle-Wold Atnafu told local press the newly established scheme,
effective from the coming Monday, will create favorable conditions
whereby exporters may carry out their business activities
competitively on the world markets with their partners abroad.
</P>
<P>
The scheme will provide immediate credit services for those
exporters who in the past were unable to export their goods for
lack of bank credit services, said Tekle-Wold, adding in that way,
the country may be in a position to raise the quality and quantity
of its export products and to thereby earn considerable foreign
exchange.
</P>
<P>
"The scheme is also a good mechanism for cutting bureaucratic
red tape and overcoming financial problems," he said.
</P>
<P>
The governor noted that the establishment of the export credit
guarantee scheme is an integral part of the government's
consistent effort to boost the export sector, adding that the new
scheme is capable of providing a spur for economic development by
encouraging local producers and promoting credit and investment.

<HEADLINE> Bureaucracy Delays Billion-Dollar Platinum Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Bureaucratic haggling between
Anglo- American Corporation and the Zimbabwean government has
delayed the implementation of the billion-Zimbabwean Dollar
platinum joint venture project in Shurugwi of central Zimbabwe,
the Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Uncertainty now surrounds the project as the government and the
mining giant are still locked in discussions.
</P>
<P>
The government and Anglo-American are reported to be failing to
agree on tax concessions, contracts for the expatriate staff and
the financing of the project, which is the third single largest
investment in the country.
</P>
<P>
A source close to the negotiations said the Ministry of Mines,
Environment and Tourism was dragging its feet because it was not
happy with the tax concessions Anglo-American was asking for.
</P>
<P>
District Administrator for Shurugwi T.P. Mutikizizi expressed
concern at the delay in implementing the project which he said was
now long overdue.
</P>
<P>
"To date the mining licence has not been granted. It is
important that the issue be addressed as a matter of urgency, with
a view to embarking on the necessary activities soon," he said.
</P>
<P>
There were an estimated 20,000 people in urban Shurugwi and the
town was heavily dependent on mining and farming.
</P>
<P>
The project is expected to contribute approximately 30 billion
Zimbabwean Dollars (750 million U.S. Dollars) to the gross
domestic product.
</P>
<P>
With the emergence of more platinum producers in the country,
Zimbabwe is now placed third in the world on the platinum
producing countries after South Africa and Russia.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Refutes Allegations of Giving Military </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Zambia has refuted fresh
allegations by the Angolan government of its involvement in
military and logistic support to the Angolan rebel, the National
Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA).
</P>
<P>
Presidential Press and Public Relations Assistant Richard
Sakala said in Lusaka Saturday that Zambia had nothing to gain
from the prolonged instability in that country.
</P>
<P>
He was reacting to a protest letter written by Angolan Foreign
Minister Venancio de Moura to the Democratic Republic of Congo
(DRC) Foreign Minister Jean Lolakome during the just-ended
regional meeting of foreign and defense ministers on the situation
in DRC.
</P>
<P>
The letter which was circulated to foreign and local
journalists present at the talks held in Lusaka said it was in
view of the development that they had sent a representative at
ambassadorial level.
</P>
<P>
Zambian newspaper, the Sunday Times of Zambia, quoted Sakala as
saying that "having been a peace broker in the Angolan conflict
and hosted several meetings to resolve the problem, we cannot be
involved in the war there."
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Angolan government was quoted in a number of
foreign newspapers accusing Zambia of airlifting arms to the rebel
UNITA movement.
</P>
<P>
This is culminated when Presidential Affairs Minister Eric
Silwamba personally delivered a letter to the Angolan President
Jose Eduardo Dos Santos.
</P>
<P>
UNITA has for over 24 years waged a fierce civil war with the
Angolan government.

<HEADLINE> NATO to Meet on Kosovo in Brussels, U.S. Says </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization (NATO) will hold an emergency meeting in Brussels on
Sunday to discuss a response to the massacre of dozens of
civilians in Serbia's province of Kosovo, the United States said
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
U.S. State Department spokesman James Rubin said the
ambassadors to the 16-member NATO would convene on Sunday as
proposed by U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright.
</P>
<P>
NATO authorized its forces in October to hit Yugoslav military
targets if Belgrade violated pledges to seek a peaceful solution
to a conflict with ethnic Albanian separatists. However, the
United States and its allies do not support the independence of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Earlier, U.S. President Bill Clinton strongly condemned the
Friday massacre, which he blamed on Serbian security forces.
</P>
<P>
"This was a deliberate and indiscriminate act of murder
designed to sow fear among the people of Kosovo. It is a clear
violation of the commitments the Serbian authorities have made to
NATO. There can be no justification for it," Clinton said in a
written statement.
</P>
<P>
"I condemn in the strongest possible terms the massacre of
civilians by the Serb security forces that took place last night
in the village of Racak in Kosovo," Clinton said.
</P>
<P>
"It is urgent that these murders do not trigger a spiral of
reprisals," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Both sides have a responsibility to work toward a peaceful
resolution of this crisis and for a settlement that allows the
people of Kosovo the self-government they so clearly deserve," he
said.
</P>
<P>
Albright had talked with fellow NATO foreign ministers,
including those from Britain, France, Germany and Norway after
the bodies of some 40 ethnic Albanians were founded in the
village of Racak in Kosovo on Friday.
</P>
<P>
She demanded that Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic bring
those responsible to justice, said Rubin.
</P>
<P>
Rubin said Albright was demanding that Milosevic "identify who
gave the orders and who took this action, and ensure that those
perpetrators are then brought to justice."
</P>
<P>
"We want the Serbs to cooperate in the investigation of this
atrocity by the International War Crimes Tribunal," he added.
</P>
<P>
At the White House there was intense concern about the
situation in Kosovo where ethnic Albanians said the killings were
carried out by Serbian police.
</P>
<P>
National Security Adviser Sandy Berger kept the president
updated throughout the day.
</P>
<P>
Independence-minded ethnic Albanians outnumber Serbs by nine
to one in Kosovo, a Serbian province where some 2,000 people were
killed and 250,000 driven from their homes in the fightings last
year.

<HEADLINE> Prices of Stationery, Textbooks Up by 30 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's stationery and
textbook manufacturers have recently increased their selling
prices by 30 percent and are considering another hike by the end
of this month after paper producers increased the price of paper
by almost 100 percent, the Sunday Mail reported.
</P>
<P>
Paper producers claim the price increase has been forced on
them by the fall of the Zimbabwean Dollar as their product had a
high import content. The increase in the price of paper has also
resulted in the shooting up of newspapers prices.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the Zimbabwean Dollar was devalued by more than 60
percent. Last week, it was again devalued by over five percent.
</P>
<P>
The sharp rise in textbook prices is set to increase the burden
on parents who last week complained that the prices of school
uniforms had gone up by between 35 and 100 percent.
</P>
<P>
The increase was likely to affect school children as they would
be forced to share books in class, the weekly newspaper reported.

<HEADLINE> Garments Grapple with Slack Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Under pressure in both
domestic and overseas markets, Chinese garment manufacturers have
had to offer big price cuts, today's Business Weekly reported.
</P>
<P>
The average price for China's garment exports to Japan dipped
by 10 percent last year, and the domestic market has also seen
continually falling prices.
</P>
<P>
The newspaper quoted a forecast from the China Commercial
Information Center to say that 1999 would see the total retail
sales volume of consumer goods rise by seven percent from last
year to 379.5 billion U.S. dollars, of which garments are
predicted to account for 13.2 percent, 5.6 percentage points
higher than last year's level.
</P>
<P>
"Due to the slowdown in the income growth of the Chinese
people, the domestic demand for garment products is unlikely to
rise a lot this year," said an official from the State Textile
Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The growth rate of per capita consumption spending by city
residents has declined continually since 1995, and the proportion
of spending on garments in overall expenditure has also been
dwindling.
</P>
<P>
"While enabling consumers to buy more clothes, the price
discounts have also pinched current consumption by leading
consumers to expect more price cuts in the future," said the
official.

<HEADLINE> BOC Issues Huge Loans for Road Construction in Shandong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Bank of China, one of the
country's big-four commercial banks, has decided to extend 2.7
billion yuan-worth of loans for the construction of two
expressways in east China's Shandong Province.
</P>
<P>
Of the amount, 150 million US dollars in loans will be used to
help finance the construction of an expressway linking coastal
Rizhao City and inland Zhuyuan City, which is 114 km long.
Another 1.4 billion yuan will be issued for the construction of
the 90-km-long Zhaozhuang section of the Beijing-Fuzhou
Expressway. Fuzhou is capital of east China's Fujian Province.
</P>
<P>
The huge loans will not only help eliminate fund shortfalls
but also create 1.44 million job opportunities, according to a
provincial communications official.
</P>
<P>
Shandong, one of China's economic powerhouses, is well-known
for its relatively developed road systems. Currently Shandong has
63,000-km highways and 913-km expressways.
</P>
<P>
According to an official plan, Shandong will invest 72 billion
yuan in road construction between 1998 and 2000, raising the
length of highways to 75,000 km and that of expressways to 2,600
km.

<HEADLINE> Garment Workers Deprived of Eid Bonus in Bangladesh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, January 17 (Xinhua) -- More than 800,000 out of the 1.5
million garment workers in Bangladesh have been deprived of the
Eid bonus this year which is mandatory under the country's labor
law, The Financial Express daily newspaper reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
About 15,000 of them were not getting even their salary for the
last two or three months and overtime allowance for seven months,
the report said.
</P>
<P>
Leaders of the National Garments Workers Federation said that
only 30 to 40 percent garment workers this year were given bonus
for Eid-ul-Fitr, which is only two days away, and that the bonus
was not equivalent to one month's pay as mandatory under the law.
</P>
<P>
Admitting the situation, Vice President Nurul Haq Sikdar of the
Bangladesh Garments Manufacturers and Exporters Association said
that nearly 800 garment factories went sick -- 500 by political
disturbances and 300 by last year's flood.
</P>
<P>
He said the association would be ready to resolve the problem
and advised the labor leaders where bonus and salary were not paid
to contact the association immediately.
</P>
<P>
Sikdar complained that none of the commitments made by the
government had been fulfilled to help overcome the difficulties of
the sick factories.
</P>
<P>
The government had agreed that the liabilities caused by 173
days of hartal, staged by the ruling Bangladesh Awami League when
in opposition from 1991 to 1996, were to be entered into a blocked
account and the factories affected by the flood from July to
September in 1998 were to be given three months' working capital.
"None of the commitments was fulfilled," said Sikdar.
</P>
<P>
A report in The Independent daily said workers at the country's
second largest public jute mill, the UMC Jute Mill, in northeast
Narsindi district went on strike earlier this month to demand
festival bonus.
</P>
<P>
There are more than 27,000 garment factories in Bangladesh,
accounting for about 70 percent of the country's total export
earnings.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai's Pudong Maintains High Economic Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Pudong New Area in
Shanghai, a rising financial and trade zone, managed to maintain
healthy and rapid economic growth in 1998 despite the worsening
effects of the Asian financial crisis and a shortage of capital
resources, official figures show.
</P>
<P>
Pudong, which is separated from downtown Shanghai by the
Huangpu River, registered a gross domestic product of 71 billion
yuan in 1998, an increase of 16.8 percent from the previous year,
according to the latest statistics.
</P>
<P>
The GDP growth rate for all of Shanghai was 10.1 percent
while the national figure was 7.8 percent in 1998.
</P>
<P>
With around 8.3 percent of Shanghai's total area and 10
percent of the municipal population, Pudong accounted for 20
percent of the city's value of GDP last year.
</P>
<P>
Official statistics also show that Pudong's industrial output
value soared 15.8 percent to 146 billion yuan last year and
foreign trade rose 14.5 percent to 4.3 billion US dollars, with
both standing at nearly one quarter of Shanghai's total.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, contracted overseas investment in Pudong jumped 47
percent to 2.8 billion US dollars in 1998, about half of the
figure for all of Shanghai.
</P>
<P>
"All the figures indicate that Pudong has successfully
maintained a strong growth momentum in the past eight years and
become an important growth area of the Shanghai economy,"the
official said. Pudong was officially opened to overseas investors
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
Last year Pudong invested a record 58 billion yuan in fixed
assets, up 14.6 percent from 1997. Currently construction of the
Pudong International Airport, whose cost has been budgeted at 100
billion yuan, and construction of another 57 major projects are
proceeding smoothly.
</P>
<P>
Reforms in land use, measures to cut initial investment cost
and enhanced effort to give national treatment status to
overseas-funded enterprises, among other things, have combined to
attract more investors to Pudong last year, during which 519
overseas-funded projects were approved, including 22 projects set
up by 10 multinational corporations.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, 140 domestic companies from other parts of
China invested in Pudong in 1998, according to official figures.
</P>
<P>
So far investors from more than 60 countries and regions have
launched 5,437 projects in Pudong, with total investment hitting
28 billion US dollars. Eighty-eight of the top 500 multinational
corporations in the world have launched more than 140 projects in
Pudong.
</P>
<P>
The projects cover such sectors as modern telecommunications,
electric appliances, biological engineering, automobiles,
computers, machinery and electronics, according to the city
official, who added that new and high-tech products made up one
quarter of the area's industrial output value last year.
</P>
<P>
Experts here attributed Pudong's sustained and rapid economic
and foreign trade growth to the high quality of overseas-funded
enterprises in the development zone, as such firms accounted for
half of Pudong's exports in 1998.
</P>
<P>
Also last year nine more overseas banks settled in Pudong,
bringing to 71 the number of financial institutions in the area,
including 18 overseas banks licensed to deal in local currency
business.
</P>
<P>
The financial sector has become the prime factor for the
extraordinary growth of the service sector in Pudong, the
official said.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Mike Tyson lost the first
four rounds but knocked out Francois Botha in the fifth to win
his comeback fight in Las Vegas on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Botha, from South Africa, got an upper hand over Tyson but
with 10 seconds left in the fifth round, Tyson nailed Botha with
a right hand for good.
</P>
<P>
"He was talking a lot of smack and stuff, but I was cool,"
Said Tyson, who was fighting for the first time since biting
Evander Holyfield's ears on June 28, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Yeah, I was trying to bait him. I just walked into it,"
Botha said.
</P>
<P>
At the end of four rounds, two judges had Botha ahead 40-35
while another judge favored Botha 39-36.
</P>
<P>
"I had a tremendous amount of rust," said Tyson, who had not
fight for 19 months after his license was revoked.
</P>
<P>
Near the end of the fifth round, Botah went to throw a right
to Tyson's body, but Tyson countered with a quick right that hit
full into Botha's face and dropped him on the canvas.
</P>
<P>
Botha tried to get up, but fell back. He struggled up at the
count of 7, only to fall back as Richard Steele waved the fight
over. Tyson kneeled down, hugged him and kissed him on top of the
head.

<HEADLINE> Forest Protection Gains Great Economic Benefits </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Officials with the Liaoning Provincial Bureau of Forestry said
that the forest coverage rate has doubled since the founding of
New China in 1949, and the forest industry has gained social
benefits worth 50 billion yuan (6 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Over two million hectares of forests in the eastern part of
Liaoning have been under efficient protection, which has been
able to conserve more than 12 billion tons of water per year.
</P>
<P>
The provincial agricultural departments have also made great
efforts in building methane-generation projects, trying to
substitute firewood with methane gas so as to meet the daily
needs of rural residents.
</P>
<P>
And the ecological environment in the eastern part of the
province has improved a lot with the planting of trees and
pastures. Cities including Fuxin, Chaoyang, and Jinzhou which
used to be lack of food grain have developed into commodity grain
bases, and the grain yield of Chaoyang has accounted for one
tenth that of the whole province.
</P>
<P>
The total forest area in eastern Liaoning has exceeded 1.4
million hectares after over 30 years of efforts, which has helped
increase rainfall in the area in the past few years and water and
soil erosion has been reduced, with the sand content per cubic
meter of river flow decreasing from 106 kilograms to 60 kil
ograms, and the water table in some dry areas has risen by three
to four meters.

<HEADLINE> Yuan's Value Has Firm Backing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGCHUN, January 17 (Xinhua) -- China will not have to
devalue its currency as the yuan's stability has a firm backing
on at least three corner stones, according to a noted finance
expert.
</P>
<P>
Yang Huichang, a professor of Jilin University in northeast
China, said that China's high economic growth, low inflation and
big foreign trade surplus are three corner stones for the yuan's
stability.
</P>
<P>
"A stable yuan has helped to promote economic growth and
economic stability and prosperity have in turn provided a
powerful support for the yuan's stability," Yang said.
</P>
<P>
China has successfully maintained the value of the yuan and
relatively high economic growth amid the worsening effects of the
Asian financial crisis, which broke out in July 1997 and resulted
in massive currency devaluation in Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia,
the Philippines, the Republic of Korea, Japan and other affected
countries.
</P>
<P>
Many people in and outside China said that China has decided
not to devalue the yuan only to show to the world that it is a
responsible big country, according to Yang.
</P>
<P>
However, it is a strong macro economy that has provided the
firmest backing for the yuan's stability, Yang said, adding that
a prosperous China does not need to devalue its currency.
</P>
<P>
Official figures show that China's gross domestic product grew
7.8 percent in 1998, while the inflation index was 2.6 percent.
China's foreign trade surplus reached 45 billion US dollars last
year, 4.7 billion US dollars more than in 1997.

<HEADLINE> Colombian Official Urges Dialogue With Paramilitary Group </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTAFE DE BOGOTA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Columbia's High
Commissioner for Peace Victor Ricardo on Saturday urged the
government to hold dialogue with the country's ultra-right
paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
The paramilitary groups, which local and international human
rights organizations accuse of receiving tacit backing from the
military, have been involved in violent fighting with leftist
guerrillas for more than a decade, killing civilians they suspect
to be guerrilla sympathizers.
</P>
<P>
Last Sunday, the right-wing death squads reportedly killed
more than 100 people in a rampage across five northern Colombian
provinces.
</P>
<P>
Ricardo, interviewed in Cuba by the Radio Net, said there is a
need to sit down for talks with the paramilitary groups, whose
political status is not acknowledged.
</P>
<P>
He noted that those paramilitary groups and the nation's
leftist guerrillas are two different cases, and the government
should treat them differently.
</P>
<P>
He explained that the government granted the guerrillas
political status because they are seeking a political solution to
the country's violence, while the government will take another
course to deal with the paramilitary groups.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, Leonardo Gomez Serna, bishop of San Gil in
the northeast of Colombia, said he has contacts with paramilitary
groups and is in favor of a dialogue between the government and
the paramilitary groups.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar Launches Modified Registration System </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YANGON, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar has begun field-testing
a modified vital registration system in four pilot townships in
the country to improve the system in both urban and rural areas.
</P>
<P>
The testing of the new registration system, which began Friday
and will last for six months, covers Tiddim, Pwintphyu, Kyaukse
and Kyauktan townships in Chin, Magway, Mandalay and Yangon
divisions respectively.
</P>
<P>
The activities are jointly carried out by the Ministry of
National Planning and Economic Development, the Health Department
and the Central Statistical Organization with the assistance of
the U.N. Children's Fund.
</P>
<P>
The vital registration system covers all the birth and death
statistics and is said to become a most comprehensive source of
vital information up to the community level.
</P>
<P>
The system is also said to help realize the Convention of the
Right of the Child which stipulates that the child shall be
registered immediately after birth and shall have the right from
birth to a name and the right to acquire a nationality.
</P>
<P>
At present, the vital registration and statistics system covers
261 townships with 91 percent of the urban population, but only
167 townships with 63 percent of the rural population are
included.
</P>
<P>
The system was first introduced in Myanmar in 1904 and covered
a sizable portion of the population by 1931. The system was
reorganized in 1962 with the Health Department registering all
vital events such as birth and death and late fetal death and the
Central Statistical Organization processing and compiling vital
returns and producing official statistics.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar's population is estimated to have reached 46.4 million
in the 1997-98 fiscal year, growing by 1.84 percent annually. If
the present growth grate is maintained, Meander's population is
expected to reach 68.5 million in the year 2020, the country's
Immigration and Population Ministry predicted.

BANGKOK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Thai Foreign Minister Surin
Pitsuwan has called on European countries to open their markets so
as to help Thailand boost productivity and employment
opportunities.
</P>
<P>
Meeting with visiting Swedish Deputy Prime Minister Lena
Hjelm-Wallen on Saturday, Surin also asked Lena to persuade
Swedish firms to transfer technology that would be useful in the
development of Thai products and the creation of a production
base, according to Sunday's Bangkok Post.
</P>
<P>
Swedish producers in the past had tended to transfer only
technology that was useful to base companies back home, Surin
said.
</P>
<P>
Thailand is not just interested in technology which would
enable it to produce spare parts, he said.
</P>
<P>
Surin stressed that exports are the main route to recovery and
that the country seeks to benefit from Europe's economic growth of
7 percent.
</P>
<P>
The Swedish official commended Thailand for adopting a
recovery path that stayed clear of trade or investment barriers.
She said Europe regarded the Thai approach as a model for economic
recovery.
</P>
<P>
She said big Swedish companies, such as Ericsson, continued to
use Thailand as a production base.
</P>
<P>
Sweden, she said, would be glad to help support the development
of science, technology and the environment in Thailand.
</P>
<P>
Surin and Hjelm-Wallen also discussed the situation in Cambodia
and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the report said
without elaboration.

<HEADLINE> Employers Urged to Focus on Training </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Employment planners and labor
strategists said on Sunday that employers should improve the
skills and knowledge of workers to increase productivity and win a
competitive edge in the new millennium.
</P>
<P>
Gegorge R. James, secretary-general of the International
Employment Organization, told a labor strategies seminar that
employers' councils must always be active in organizing training
and promoting education for their employees as well as supporting
research studies.
</P>
<P>
Developing people's abilities would help employers survive the
economic crisis, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged employers to never stop thinking about expanding
businesses in order that new jobs could be created. Strengthening
labor relations would also be necessary since a peaceful working
environment could help boost productivity.
</P>
<P>
The seminar, jointly held by the Employers Council of Thailand
and the Thai Labor and Social Welfare Ministry, helped give advice
on how to increase work efficiency to lower costs.
</P>
<P>
Anantachai Khunananthakul, the council chairman, said
cooperation from workers would be needed in pulling businesses out
of the crisis.
</P>
<P>
Suriya Chuengrungruangkit, the Thai deputy industry minister,
urged employers to explain to workers that a wage cut may be
inevitable during the slump to prevent labor disputes.
</P>
<P>
Tan Peng Boo, an international Labor Organization specialist,
said employers play a vital role in promoting on-the-job training
to improve labor skills.
</P>
<P>
Tan said Thailand would need a master plan on labor skills
development of 70 percent of its workforce which had only primary
education.

<HEADLINE> Annan Calls for Probe Into Alleged Kosovo Massacre </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
UNITED NATIONS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- UN Secretary-General
Kofi Annan on Saturday called for "a full investigation" into the
alleged massacre of some 40 civilians in the Serbian province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
Annan said in a statement, issued here on Saturday night, that
"I am gravely concerned at this latest development and called for
a full investigation by the competent authorities."
</P>
<P>
"I am shocked to learn today of the alleged massacre of some
40 individuals, apparently civilians, in Kosovo," and "I appeal
once again to all sides in Kosovo to refrain from any action that
would further escalate the tragic situation."
</P>
<P>
The statement came after the U.N. chief received "a full
briefing" from Knut Vollebaek, foreign minister of Norway and
chairman-in-office of the Organization for Security and
Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), which sent a verification mission
into the Yugoslav province.
</P>
<P>
The bodies of 42 ethnic Albanian civilians, who locals said
had been killed in the village of Racak in southern Kosovo, were
identified on Saturday, reports said.
</P>
<P>
Also on Saturday night, a statement faxed from the Yugoslav
permanent mission to the United Nations accused terrorist groups
of ambushing the Serb police in action.
</P>
<P>
The statement said that Serb police were attacked early on
Friday "by terrorist groups from trenches, bunkers and
fortifications using automatic weapons and portable grenade
launchers" when police were moving towards the village of Racak
to arrest a terrorist group, which killed police officer Sevetisl
av Przic, five days before.
</P>
<P>
Conflicts broke out in Kosovo after ethnic Albanians, who make
up about 90 percent of the province's population of two million,
sought independence from the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.

<HEADLINE> Albania Calls for International Intervention in Kosovo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TIRANA, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The Albanian government got
into the swing of diplomatic actions Saturday urging immediate
international intervention in Kosovo, where 45 ethnic Albanians
were reportedly killed in a fresh outbreak of violence.
</P>
<P>
The bodies, including those of women and a child, were found
at Racak, some 30 kilometers south of Pristina, after intense
fighting Friday between Serbian security forces and the
separatist Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA).
</P>
<P>
The Albanian government announced Saturday that it had called
for an "emergency meeting" on Kosovo of the U.N. Security Council
and urged U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan to start intervention
in Kosovo as soon as possible.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Albanian Foreign Minister Paskal Milo asked the
North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) and the Organization
for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) to examine the
situation in Kosovo and take adequate measures.
</P>
<P>
He also sent letters to foreign ministers of the six-member
Contact Group on former Yugoslavia, expressing strong concerns
over the escalating violence in Kosovo. The Contact Group
comprises of the United States, Russia, Britain, Germany, France
and Italy.
</P>
<P>
On the same day, the Albanian government authorized its
representative to the OSCE to demand, at the OSCE permanent
council's meeting on Monday, "a fair and just investigation into
the Racak massacre" and punishment for those responsible for the
killings.
</P>
<P>
It also urged the OSCE to deploy all of its planned verifiers
in Kosovo to supervise ceasefire in the region.
</P>
<P>
The Albanian Foreign Ministry, in a statement issued Saturday,
condemned Belgrade's nationalism and chauvinism as well as
"neo-fascism" in the Racak killing and urged the international
community, world organizations, the United States and the
European Union to intervene in Kosovo immediately.

<HEADLINE> Chilean Ambassador Back to London for Pinochet Hearing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SANTIAGO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Chilean ambassador to the
United Kingdom Mario Artaza returned to London Saturday to attend
the new hearing in the House of Lords on retired general Augusto
Pinochet, after a one-month stay in Santiago.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of Pinochet's followers also went to the British
capital to attend the hearing.
</P>
<P>
Artaza had been called back to Santiago after British Home
Secretary Jack Straw decided on December 8 last year to give the
green light to the extradition of Pinochet to Spain, which
demands the trial of the former Chilean leader for alleged
genocide, terrorism and torture.
</P>
<P>
The Chilean government justified Artaza's return to London by
saying that the embassy will have a lot of work to do because of
the start of the new hearing in the House of Lords next Monday.
</P>
<P>
The highest British court of justice voided a decision made on
November 25 by a committee of five magistrates, who denied, by a
three-to-two vote, Pinochet's sovereign immunity.
</P>
<P>
Among Pinochet's followers who traveled to London were seven
deputies and four senators, who stated their confidence that this
time the decision will favor Pinochet, and with this he will be
able to return to Chile.
</P>
<P>
Pinochet's wife Lucia Hiriart had also returned to London on
Thursday after staying slightly over a week in Santiago.

<HEADLINE> Economists Predict Slowdown in Personal Savings Growth </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Chinese economists have
predicted that the growth of the gargantuan reserve of personal
savings in China's banks would continue slowing down this year,
today's Business Weekly said.
</P>
<P>
The volume of savings deposits from urban residents across
China had expanded from 21 billion yuan (2.5 billion US dollars)
in 1978 to 4.6 trillion yuan (558 billion US dollars) by the end
of 1997, with an annual growth rate of 32.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
However, the total stood at 5.34 trillion yuan (643.4 billion
US dollars) at the end of last year, with the growth rate sliding
to 17.1 percent, according to the People's Bank of China (PBOC).
</P>
<P>
The English newspaper quoted Wu Xiaoqiu, deputy dean of the
Finance Institute of the People's University, as saying that the
growth rate was likely to fall further in 1999, largely due to a
decrease in family earnings.
</P>
<P>
"The cuts in interest rates for personal deposits caused
direct reductions in household earnings, as did the corresponding
decrease in treasury bond interest rates," Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Since 1996, the PBOC has made six cuts in the country's bank
interest rates, three of which occurred last year.
</P>
<P>
The interest rate cuts are predicted to cause more than 100
billion yuan (12 billion US dollars) in lost returns on
individual savers' bank deposits this year, Wu said.
</P>
<P>
Deposits are also down because China's State enterprises have
laid off an increasing number of workers as part of the
government's reform drive, and are paying much less to those who
stay on the payroll, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
However, some analysts believe that the slowdown in growth is
not actually bad news, said the paper.
</P>
<P>
It quoted Wang Guogang, deputy director of the Financial
Research Institute of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, as s
aying that if the growth of personal savings stayed in high gear,
it would further aggravate the problem of idle capital.
</P>
<P>
At present, 81 percent of China's 6.5 trillion yuan (783
billion US dollars) in total financial assets is in the form of
bank deposits by individual savers, compared to between 20 and 30
percent in developed countries.

extinction, such as the African black scorpion, the Malaysian
black scorpion, and the Indian spider. Other insects include the
soldier crab, cockroach, chilopod, beetle, and stick insect --

<HEADLINE> Trust Company in Guangdong Declared Bankrupt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, January 17 (Xinhua) -- The Higher People's Court of
Guangdong province announced Saturday the bankruptcy of the
Guangdong International Trust and Investment Corp (Gitic) and its
four subsidiaries due to their failure to meet maturing debt obl
igations.
</P>
<P>
This is the first case involving the failure of a non-banking
financial institution in the nation, and a case that involves the
largest sum of assets so far.
</P>
<P>
"The bankruptcy of Gitic is handled according to law and
international practice," said court president Lu Botao, adding
that "it underlines the determination of the Chinese government
to rectify and reform the financial sector, and it serves to
protect domestic and overseas investors and help with Guangdong's
healthy economic development."
</P>
<P>
The local court also assigned a special group to take over the
failed company for assets liquidation and debts repayment.
</P>
<P>
Set up in 1980 as an investment arm of Guangdong, Gitic was
once active on the international capital market, raising funds
for key projects in Guangdong.
</P>
<P>
However, its poor management and illegal fund-raising have
resulted in mounting debts, which already amounted to 36.17
billion yuan (about 4.3 billion US dollars) at present, against
the company's assets of 21.47 billion yuan (about 2.6 billion US
dollars).
</P>
<P>
To protect the legal rights of debtors, the central bank asked
to close Gitic last October. The board of directors of the
company decided to apply for bankruptcy on January 11.

<HEADLINE> Pak, Saudi Arabia Enjoy Model Relationship: PM </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ISLAMABAD, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif
said Saturday evening that the meetings held with the Saudi
leadership are reflective of the fact that Pakistan and Saudi
Arabia enjoy a "model relationship."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said this while talking to the media at the
airport on his return from a four-day visit to Saudi Arabia.
</P>
<P>
On the outcome of his talks with the Saudi leaders, Sharif
said, "They cherish love and esteem for Pakistan and have always
supported it on all issues."
</P>
<P>
"It's a model relationship which will further strengthen with
passage of time," Sharif added.
</P>
<P>
On the approval of a bailout package by the International
Monetary Fund to Pakistan under the Enhanced Structural Adjustment
Facility, Sharif said, "it is an instance of revival of confidence
and understanding of the international donor institutions toward
Pakistan's economic policies."
</P>
<P>
Sharif noted that sanctions imposed on Pakistan in the wake of
its nuclear tests in May last year have been lifted, the matter of
F-16s with the United States has been resolved and the IMF package
stands restored.
</P>
<P>
"This amply ventilates the Pakistan government's principled
stand and makes clear that the imposition of sanctions was an
unjust measure," he said.

SHANGHAI, January 17 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai's 1998 exports of
machinery and electronic products grew by 19.6 percent on the
1997 level to 6.1 billion US dollars, according to local sources.

dollars, with exports to the United States rising by 46 percent
to 1.5 billion US dollars.

<HEADLINE> Ecuador to Seek New Oil Markets </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
QUITO, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Ecuadorian state oil company
Petroleos del Ecuador (Petroecuador) said Saturday that oil
prices will remain low during 1999 and that it will seek new
markets to increase exports.
</P>
<P>
"No much higher oil prices can be expected," company president
Ramiro Gordillo told Radio Quito.
</P>
<P>
The average price of crude oil per barrel could barely surpass
seven U.S. dollars this year, but might improve in the future, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The average price rose slightly in past few days to reach 7.34
dollars per barrel.
</P>
<P>
Gordillo said that his company will make efforts to increase
exports, especially to new markets that can offer more stability
and better prices.
</P>
<P>
Oil is the country's main source of revenue, financing 37
percent of the state budget.
</P>
<P>
Ecuador's oil output is 380,000 barrels a day, of which 60
percent is exported and 40 percent refined for domestic
consumption.

LONDON, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Billy Schwer of England
retained his European lightweight title after beating Zoltan
Kalocsai of Hungary on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
Schwer, 29, suffered a samll cut above his left eye in the
fouth round of the bout. But he was in charge throughout and
produced a devastating finish in the seventh round as he ended
the bout with a knock-out victory.
</P>
<P>
Kalocsai took a first count in the fifth round and then
crashed down again in the seventh when a tremendous right
uppercut sent the challenger reeling backwards.
</P>
<P>
Schwer charged after him and threw blows from every angle, and
referee Bob Logist wisely called a halt.
</P>
<P>
Now, his manager Mickey Duff expects him to get his chance of
winning the World Boxing Council (WBC) title against Cesar Bazan

WASHINGTON -- U.S. House prosecutors said in the Senate trial
against President Bill Clinton on Saturday that the president's
conduct in his affair with former White House intern Monica
Lewinsky amounted to "high crimes and misdemeanors" warranting
his removal.
</P>
<P>
Wrapping up arguments on the last day of their three-day
presentations in the trial, the 13 House prosecutors, all
Republican lawmakers, launched a blistering attack on what they
called Clinton's "so-what defense." They told senators he should
be removed from office because he "abused the trust placed upon
him by the American people." (US-Clinton-Senate-Trial)

<HEADLINE> Ocalan Departs From Italy to Russia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, January 16 (Xinhua) -- Kurdish rebel leader Abdullah
Ocalan departed from Rome's military airport Ciampino to Russia
Saturday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
The Turkey-wanted Kurdish Worker's Party (PKK) leader,
accompanied by Italian policemen has left his villa in the town of
Infernetto, 30 km south from Rome, and took a plane to Moscow
around 13:00 pm local time.
</P>
<P>
The statement of Italian Premier's office said that Ocalan has
decided with his willingness to leave Italy.
</P>
<P>
Italy's News Agency ANSA said that this is "an honorable
depart" which concluded the Ocalan case for Italy.
</P>
<P>
Ocalan was arrested in Rome on November 12 last year under
international arrest warrants issued by Germany and Turkey after
he arrived on a flight from Moscow.
</P>
<P>
But later Germany said that it will not seek to extradite
Ocalan to Germany, for fear of sparking unrest between its own
Kurdish and Turkish immigrants.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish extradition request accused Ocalan of a long list
of terrorism and terrorism-related crimes. Turkey blames Ocalan
for the more than 30,000 deaths during his 15-year armed struggle
for a Kurdish homeland in southeastern Turkey.
</P>
<P>
But Turkey's extradition is ruled out by Italian Low, which
excludes it to countries where the death sentence is in force.
</P>
<P>
Italy's rejection of Turkish demands for Ocalan's Extradition
has caused a rift between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
For resolve the sensitive issue, Italy and Germany agreed on 27
November that Ocalan be tried by an international tribunal
supported by European Union (EU). But until now, no member of EU
is willing to host the trial.
</P>
<P>
The Rome Appeals Court lifted on December 16 travel restriction
on Ocalan, and on December 23, Italian Prime Minister Massimo
D'Alema announced that he could leave Italy and "is free to go
wherever he wants", ignoring the extradition request by the
Turkish government.

<HEADLINE> EU Finance Ministers to Meet for New Year Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, January 16 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU)
finance ministers will have its first meeting in 1999 on Monday
under the chairmanship of Germany, which is holding current EU's
rotating presidency.
</P>
<P>
EU officials said that an open debate on the presidency's
priorities and an exchange of views on the financial perspective
for the 2000-2006 period will be main matters featuring on the
agenda for the year's first session of EU Council of Ministers.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, the EU member states' finance ministers are
expected to discuss global economic outlook, in particular the
latest developments in the Brazilian financial and monetary
crisis.
</P>
<P>
Now, the EU officials seems to see optimistically the European
economic situation. At the weeken's meeting in Frankfurt, finance
ministers from Europe and Asia have expressed their deep concerns
over Brazil's crisis because it may trigger a spillover effect
from Latin America on the global economy. However, some European
leaders show full of confidence. Yves-Thibault de Silguy, the EU
commissioner for monetary affairs, has said that the spillover
effects will be smaller since the EU countries have the euro.
</P>
<P>
World financial problems will be one of the most important
topics among other matters in the ministerial meeting. Currently,
the German presidency's "four all-important concerns" for the EU
Finance Council have also been confirmed: promoting growth and
employment, guaranteeing the success of the single currency in the
wake of its launch in January 1, moving forward in facilitating
tax cooperation between member states and securing a political
agreement on Agenda 2000. The Agenda 2000 is a set of proposals
designed to prepare EU for the next enlargement.
