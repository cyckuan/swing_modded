SUTHERLAND LEADS WILD BUNCH

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Has there ever been a PGA Tour event with a
final-day leaderboard as wild as this one?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe it could only happen in movieland, and even here this
script might be a tough sell:
</P>
<P>
   The leader is David Sutherland, who has never won a tour event,
is sponsored by a jellybean company and will step to the tee today
celebrating his 34th birthday.
</P>
<P>
   Chasing him _ at (begin ital)really(end ital) close range _ is
more than a third of the field, six of them a stroke back, 12 more
another stroke back and another 11 within three shots of the lead.
</P>
<P>
   That following pack of 29 includes a half-dozen of the world's
most celebrated players _ four of them winners of major
championships, the most notable being Tiger Woods.
</P>
<P>
   Jesper Parnevik, Fred Couples and David Duval are mixed among
the name-brand challengers chasing the candy man.
</P>
<P>
   If it were a movie, they might call it Willie Wonka's Wonderful
Dream.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be something, it's going to be exciting,''
said Sutherland, who expects and looks forward to a large and loud
crowd with so many in contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every time somebody makes a long par putt, you're going to
think he made eagle.''
</P>
<P>
   Sutherland earned his spot at the top of the pack by shooting
3-under-par 68 Saturday to get to 204 for the tournament, a stroke
better than Parnevik (67), Kirk Triplett (68), Brandel Chamblee
(69), Tommy Armour III (69) and midway co-leader Bob Tway (72).
</P>
<P>
   Rocco Mediate, who shot 64 for the best round of the day, also
is at 205 after making the best move of the third round.
</P>
<P>
   Two-time Nissan Open champion Couples (68) and two-time U.S.
Open champion Lee Janzen (69) are among a dozen players at 206,
including first-round leader J.P_. Hayes (72).
</P>
<P>
   Woods and Duval, the world's No.1 and 3-ranked players, both
shot 69 Saturday to get to 207 and will likely be among the
most-watched challengers today _ when Woods bids for his seventh
win in his last eight PGA Tour starts.
</P>
<P>
   ``We'll see what happens,'' said Sutherland, who has never
finished higher than second. ``Obviously I'm in good shape so far,
but I have not won six of my last seven tournaments. Golly, I
haven't won one tournament so far. So it's basically going to be an
exciting day for me. But I'll be honest. I'm trying to win this.''
</P>
<P>
   Why such a pack at the top?
</P>
<P>
   Chamblee offered a guess shared by many players:
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the softness of the greens have a lot to do with it,''
he said. ``I think they had this course set up just the way they
wanted and then it rains. And when it rains like that the quality
of shot you need to stay on the greens goes down, so the course
doesn't separate people.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone knows fast fairways and fast greens will separate
people, so that's my explanation. But it could be blind luck.''
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the reason for the pack, there's not much question
about who most of them are watching out for today:
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to expect something from Tiger,'' said Sutherland,
who finished 14th last week at the Buick Invitational, where Woods
got to 5-under par and erased a seven-stroke deficit despite
struggling with shots all day. ``It would be ridiculous to expect
he wouldn't play well. You've got to expect 67 or 66 if not
better.''
</P>
<P>
   Parnevik, who played in the same group with Woods on Saturday,
watched him struggle with a four-putt early in the round and then
regroup to record five birdies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way he's playing he can shoot pretty much zero around
here,'' Parnevik said. ``So I don't think anyone who's in the lead
is going to think it's a comfortable lead _ especially when you've
got 25-30 guys with a chance to win.''
</P>
<P>
   Woods, who has struck the ball well all week but had problems _
as have many _ on damp greens that have been difficult for their
bumpiness, took his putting woes in stride.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did all right to hang in there to give myself a chance,'' he
said. His game plan for the anticipated bad weather?
</P>
<P>
   ``If that's the case,'' he said, ``I need to be patient, make a
lot of pars, hit a lot of solid shots and take my opportunities
when I have them.''
</P>
<P>
   Opportunities for Woods are different than opportunities for
most touring pros. In each of his past two tournaments, he has
erased seven-stroke deficits in the final round _ the first time in
just seven holes, the next in eight.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what he can do,'' Chamblee said. ``You expect
spectacular stuff and every time he does it you say, `No way he can
do it again,' and the very next week he does it again.''
</P>
<P>
   Chamblee would like to make the most of that challenging
prospect: ``I'd like to be the one that he's trying to do it to.
I'd like to be the one he's trying to hole out a 6-iron to catch.
My hat's off to him if he does.''
</P>
<P>
   Double trouble: Woods posted a 6 on the par-4 No.13 for the
second consecutive round, and in similar fashion.
</P>
<P>
   Woods drove down the left side of the fairway and had a 10-foot
putt for birdie, but sent the ball three feet past the hole. He
missed that putt for par, then missed a two-footer for bogey. Woods
punctuated the hole by impaling the blade end of his putter into
the round behind the green.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what it is,'' said Woods, who parred the hole in
the first round. ``I hit a perfect drive and a perfect little
9-iron in there, and made a good putt but just missed it on the
left. I hit another putt and again it broke to the right, not to
the left, which was the opposite of the way it was coming up. Then
the next one I just hit a bad putt, pulled it. Then I tapped in for
a nice little four-putt.''

NORMAN'S IMPACT BEING FELT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN CROUSE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Greg Norman hasn't been affiliated with the PGA
Tour stop in L.A. for nearly as long as Glen Campbell. In 1985, two
years after the singer last lent his name to the L.A. Open, Norman
shot rounds of 72-73 at Riviera Country Club and missed the cut.
After that, Shark sightings dried up like the creek that once ran
through part of the Pacific Palisades course.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian golfing great hasn't appeared in the event since.
Nevertheless, the 17-year veteran is casting a long shadow on this
year's Nissan Open. Heading into today's final round four
Australians sit within three shots of the lead, all of them there
for the grace and greatness of Greg.
</P>
<P>
   Norman's swashbuckling style, so reminiscent of Arnold Palmer's
in his prime, has kindled interest in the game in his homeland,
same as Palmer's did in his during his heyday in the 1950s and
1960s.
</P>
<P>
   Australia produced prominent players - Peter Thomson, Bruce
Devlin, Bruce Crampton and Wayne Grady, to name a few - but no
transcendent personalities until Norman stormed onto the PGA Tour
and won two events and finished second in the U.S. Open in his
second full season, in 1984.
</P>
<P>
   By the force of his magnetism, Norman pulled would-be cricket
players such as Craig Spence and Australian Rules football players
such as Stuart Appleby and Bradley Hughes into golf.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it wasn't for Greg Norman, golf wouldn't be what it is in
Australia,'' said Melbourne native Robert Allenby. ``That's true as
it gets.''
</P>
<P>
   Allenby, 27, pulled to within two shots of third-round leader
David Sutherland on the strength of a 4-under-par 67. He scorched
the back nine - his first nine - in a 4-under 32 and hung on.
</P>
<P>
   He is tied for eighth at 7-under-par with 11 others, among them
Hughes and Spence. Another Aussie, Greg Chalmers, who was tied for
the second-round lead, is three behind Sutherland after shooting a
74.
</P>
<P>
   Hughes, 33, is Australia's answer to Deion Sanders. He signed
with the Melbourne Football Club but victories in the Australian
Masters in 1993 and 1998 spurred him to aim for greens and forget
the goalposts.
</P>
<P>
   Spence may seem as small as a sixpence, but his swing is pure
gold.
</P>
<P>
   The 25-year-old, who's as thin as his broomstick putter and more
boyish-looking than any standard-bearer we've seen this week, won
the Australian Masters last year and has one top-five finish in 11
career PGA Tour starts.
</P>
<P>
   Spence had never seen Riviera until he played a practice round
with Hughes last week. But he immediately felt at home amid the
kikuyu grass and poa annua and bent-grass greens.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Riviera could be Australian for golf, it's so much like
the courses Down Under.
</P>
<P>
   All eyes naturally are going to be on Tiger Woods, who is
lurking three strokes off the lead. But it would be unwise to count
out the Australians, who are as home as koala bears amid all the
eucalyptus trees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The design of the golf course and the shape of the greens are
the same as the courses we play back home,'' Spence said after his
1-under-par 70.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no water, no tricks to the course,'' Hughes
elaborated. ``If you hit goods shots, you can get rewarded.''
</P>
<P>
   There is one marked difference between Riviera and the course
Hughes played out of in Australia. It costs $85,000 to join Riviera
and the monthly dues are $500. Hughes paid only $200 for playing
privileges for the calendar year back home.
</P>
<P>
   ``Golf is still quite cheap in Australia,'' Hughes said. ``It's
more accessible to people than it is here in the States.''
</P>
<P>
   The greens fees are lower. That's the good news. The bad news is
so are the purses on the Australasian Tour, creating a scenario
whereby the best Australian golfers eventually grow too big for
their homeland. It doesn't help that the Australasian Tour starts
in December, which is what passes for an offseason for most of the
world's top golfers, and runs through February.
</P>
<P>
   The end result is Australia is exporting more golfers to the
U.S. than koalas, which has Australian golfing officials none too
pleased. To a man the Aussies playing here said they feel pressure
to prop up their home tour even as they're pressing to make a place
for themselves among the world's best golfers on the PGA Tour.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd have to win here and be secure for a few years before I'd
feel like I could (divide his time between the tours, as Norman
does),'' said Hughes, who twice has finished as high as second on
the PGA Tour. ``Until then, it's not worth jeopardizing my standing
here just to try to please everyone back home.''
</P>
<P>
   Spence can see both sides now. ``It's such a good argument in
both directions,'' he said. ``We need to compete with the best
players to continue to succeed and the best players are on the PGA
Tour. But our tour will go backwards if the good players don't
(grace) it.''
</P>
<P>
   Aussie rules obviously can get quite complicated.

Older and wiser, Gooden eyes fresh start
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOSEPH DUARTE
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle &QL; 
KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ At 35, Dwight Gooden feels like a rookie all over
again, not a pitcher entering the twilight of a storied and
sometimes troubled career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a fresh start for me,'' Gooden said Saturday as the
Astros held their first spring training workout.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden, signed to a minor-league contract last month, spent his
first official day as an Astro shaking hands and introducing
himself to teammates (just call him ``Doc'').
</P>
<P>
   After a 3{-hour workout, Gooden pronounced himself as being ``in
the best shape in 10 years'' and anxious to rebound from last
year's struggles with the Cleveland Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Entering his 16th major-league season _ with his third team in
four years _ the righthander holds no illusions of regaining the
magic that made him one of baseball's dominant pitchers in the late
1980s. But he believes he has a few years left in his arm.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still think I can be a starter. Still, you have to go out
and show it,'' said Gooden, whose 188 career victories rank him
fourth among active pitchers behind Roger Clemens (247), Greg
Maddux (221) and Orel Hershiser (203). ``My main thing is to go out
and show them I'm healthy and can still get people out.''
</P>
<P>
   With inexperience and injuries clouding the bottom half of the
rotation, the Astros hope Gooden can fill the No. 4 or 5 spot. A
role in the bullpen also is being discussed.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not the Dwight Gooden we once knew. But he still
demands a lot of respect for what he has done in his career,''
general manager Gerry Hunsicker said. ``When he walks into a
clubhouse, everybody turns around. There's something special in the
air.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden took the fast track to begin his career _ Rookie of the
Year at age 19, a Cy Young Award winner at 20, a member of the
World Series champion New York Mets at 21. He had his best season
in 1985, going 24-4 with a 1.53 ERA in becoming the youngest
pitcher to win a Cy Young.
</P>
<P>
   After helping the Mets win the World Series in 1986, Gooden had
his promising career sidetracked by drug problems. He missed two
months of the following season while undergoing rehabilitation for
a cocaine problem.
</P>
<P>
   Seven years later, Gooden was banned from the final six weeks of
the 1994 season and all of 1995 after testing positive for cocaine,
eventually ending his 11-year stay with the Mets. While serving the
suspension he considered suicide.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been tough,'' Gooden said. ``The good times override the
bad times. Unfortunately I had some tough times off the field. I
think by doing that you try and bring the positives out of those
situations as best as you can and help others with the situations
that I've had.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden returned to baseball in 1996, signing with the New York
Yankees, and pitched a no-hitter against Seattle. He spent the past
two seasons in Cleveland bothered by injuries, including a shoulder
strain that limited him to 22 starts in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   It got to a point last season that Gooden wondered if he was
approaching the end of his career quicker than expected. He was
left off the Indians' playoff roster and became a free agent.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were a lot of mixed reactions and you start wondering.
Deep down you keep telling yourself you still have it,'' he said.
``Last year for myself was a down year, probably the worst I had in
my career both on the field as well as mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden rededicated himself this offseason, enrolling at the
Bollettieri Academy in Bradenton, Fla. Each weekday, he worked
through a conditioning program with a personal trainer.
</P>
<P>
   ``My shoulder feels the best it's felt in a long time,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   He also spent time with his five children _ Dwight Jr. (14),
Ashley (9), Ariel (8), Devon (5) and Darren (3) _ and wife, Monica,
at their St. Petersburg, Fla., home. Dwight Jr. watched his dad
work out Saturday from the bleachers at Osceola County Stadium.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the season starts is when I get my rest,'' Gooden joked.
</P>
<P>
   Gooden could get more work than expected this season with the
uncertain physical status of Scott Elarton and the departure of
Mike Hampton, two of the Astros' top four starters when 1999 ended.
</P>
<P>
   However long the Astros have his services, some younger pitchers
plan to soak in the experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``Starting today I was getting tips from him how to prepare
yourself after a bad outing,'' Jose Lima said. ``It will be great
for me to hang out with him because he can teach me a lot of
stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   Gooden listed the opportunity to play for a playoff contender, a
return to the National League and the opening of Enron Field as
reasons for signing with the Astros.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's definitely a plus at this stage in my career,'' he
said. ``I thought it was a great fit for myself. Hopefully, I'd
like to finish my career here. I think I have at least three more
years.''

CLIPPERS FALL TO BULLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By RANDY HILL  
 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHICAGO -- Just when it appeared the Clippers had met an
occasion they could rise to, the NBA's sleeping midget hit the
snooze button and rolled over.
</P>
<P>
   Even the presence of new assistant coach Kareem Abdul-Jabbar
seemed to be no cause for alarm.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need a lot of practice,'' the NBA's all-time leading scorer
said after an initial review of his new pupils. ``We're already out
of the playoffs, so we're pointing for next year.''
</P>
<P>
   Abdul-Jabbar figured this thing out in a hurry.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, with all sorts of nasty numbers in their un-hip pockets,
the Clippers coughed up an 11-point, third-quarter lead Saturday
night and continued their impressive moonwalk through the NBA
standings by losing to the Chicago Bulls.
</P>
<P>
   The final count was 74-72 before a noisy sellout crowd of 22,241
at the United Center.
</P>
<P>
   This event was littered with more ugly numbers than your
bathroom scale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Two teams at the bottom of the league, both teams fighting it
out,'' said Clippers interim coach Jim Todd, who could have been
describing a chicken showdown between Ford Pintos. ``Both teams
played great defense.''
</P>
<P>
   That would qualify as spin.
</P>
<P>
   The Bulls tied a league season low for field-goal percentage
(28.6) and won. The Clippers shot a robust 38.5 percent. They also
extended their overall losing skid to 10, pushed their streak of
road defeat to 16, lost for the eighth time in the eight games Todd
has been their head coach and were beaten for the 25th time in 27
games.
</P>
<P>
   In the crucial Rookie-of-the-Year derby, Clipper Lamar Odom had
19 points (8 of 14 from the field) and 8 rebounds, while Bulls
forward Elton Brand, last year's top pick, had 18 rebounds and 13
points (6 of 23 from the field).
</P>
<P>
   For the Clips, it may be a lose-win situation, after all.
</P>
<P>
   By losing to the Bulls (12-38), the Clippers (11-42) took a
giant leap toward earning enough Ping-Pong lottery combinations to
secure the first pick in the 2000 draft. The Bulls, who heaved Toni
Kukoc overboard last week, have sabotaged their run for draft
supremacy by winning two in a row.
</P>
<P>
   For a while, it looked dicey.
</P>
<P>
   When point guard Troy Hudson (22 points, 8 assists, 6 rebounds)
cherry-picked a layup at 7:35 of the third quarter, the Clips held
a 53-42 advantage.
</P>
<P>
   They were caught at 63, when Chicago sub Chris Carr (19 points)
nailed two free throws at 4:36 of the fourth quarter. Abetting the
Clipper collapse was a hideous-looking fall by power forward
Maurice Taylor, who hopped to the locker room with 10:12 left to
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought it was blown,'' Taylor said, referring to his left
knee, not the game. The fall made the injury look worse than it
was. ``It's more of a hyperextension than a sprain. I thought I was
done.''
</P>
<P>
   His teammates weren't exactly finished until the final buzzer,
when Hudson shot a 21-footer from 22 feet. The air ball was fired
after the Clippers called time out and set up a play with 1.8
seconds remaining. This was the closing gasp in a last-minute chain
of events that included Eric Piatkowski mishandling an in-bounds
pass and the Bulls going stone cold at the free-throw line.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was in range,'' Hudson said of the final shot that could
have given his team a 75-74 victory. ``If I thought I had time for
a rhythm dribble, I think I could have got it.''

Elliott doggedly works way back after transplant
<TEXT>
<P>
   By JOHN P. LOPEZ
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ After Sean Elliott underwent a kidney transplant
last summer, his teammate, Avery Johnson, told him to live happily
ever after.
</P>
<P>
   He told Elliott to retire gracefully and happily. Enjoy life.
There no longer was anything out there he needed to prove. The NBA
championship finally was his, but more, so was personal redemption.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott, who once was considered a nice player in the most cruel
of ways, had risen above it all. After falling victim to the NBA's
most feared four-letter word _ soft _ he swatted away the too-nice
label with the softest of shots in an unforgettable gritty moment.
</P>
<P>
   It was the Memorial Day Miracle, a single flash of brilliance
and heart that forever exorcised Elliott's demons and etched his
name among the game's great heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The miraculous shot came in the waning seconds of Game 2 of the
Western Conference finals, as the Portland Trail Blazers threatened
to steal home-court advantage and yet again break Spurs hearts.
Elliott found himself in the middle of a frenetic moment, trapped
deep in the corner of the floor at the Alamodome as time was
ticking away.
</P>
<P>
   He took an inbounds pass from Mario Elie and turned toward the
basket only to find Blazers big man Rasheed Wallace rushing toward
him. He planted his feet, the heels of Elliott's shoes hanging over
the out-of-bounds line like something out of a LeRoy Neiman
painting.
</P>
<P>
   He lofted that soft shot of his and drained a 3-pointer that won
the game and ignited the Spurs' run to the NBA championship. It was
called a shot that sealed Elliott's fate as a warrior, but soon we
would find out that shot wasn't it at all.
</P>
<P>
   This is it. This is the warrior.
</P>
<P>
   This is Elliott's happily ever after: It's six months after the
kidney transplant and three hours before tip-off at the Alamodome.
Elliott is sprinting up the bleachers, grimacing and grunting all
the way, then bending over at the waist trying to grab one solid
breath of air.
</P>
<P>
   He runs the bleachers over and over again, before descending to
the floor to jump rope until his arms begin to tremble.
</P>
<P>
   He is virtually alone _ only a few stadium workers, a few
curious onlookers and the Spurs trainer watch him sprint and shoot,
jump and dunk.
</P>
<P>
   He sprints the length of the court for time, back and forth,
back and forth. He runs 20 sprints, then 10 more.
</P>
<P>
   He picks up a basketball and tosses it to the trainer, sprinting
sideline to sideline, taking passes and shooting 17-foot jumpers.
When he misses his last three shots in a row, Elliott screams and
kicks the ball in frustration, sending it some 30 rows into the
Alamodome stands.
</P>
<P>
   ``God, come on!'' Elliott yells at himself. ``Hit those shots.''
</P>
<P>
   He stops and cranes his head back, putting the tips of two
fingers on his throat to monitor his pulse. He shoots free throws,
then runs some more, slashing through the lane for dunks. Finally,
his legs go almost numb and all he can do is pitch layups.
</P>
<P>
   No one said happily ever after was going to be easy. But this is
Elliott's happily ever after.
</P>
<P>
   To play basketball again. To prove something to himself, instead
of someone else.
</P>
<P>
   To show transplant patients the world over that you can't
measure heart by counting the number of functioning kidneys inside
a person's body.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a challenge that I want to accept,'' Elliott, 32,
said. ``I don't want it to defeat me. I'm not going to let it
defeat me. I have to prove I can do this.''
</P>
<P>
   He is.
</P>
<P>
   After becoming practically frail six months ago, losing 20
pounds in a matter of weeks after the end of the Spurs' glorious
season, Elliott began taking small steps back to the game he loves
in November.
</P>
<P>
   On Feb. 2, he began practicing again with the Spurs, just five
months after all the energy that defined his game for a decade was
zapped.
</P>
<P>
   He would eat one bowl of fruit all day, then lie in bed for
hours.
</P>
<P>
   ``My favorite place was lying down,'' he said. ``I couldn't do
anything. I had no energy, no desire to get out of bed or do
anything.''
</P>
<P>
   He underwent the transplant Aug. 24 because of something called
focal segmental glomerular sclerosis. He thanked God for his
brother, Noel, who donated the kidney, often picking up the phone
and asking his brother, ``Are you sure you want to do this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``You're my brother,'' Noel would respond.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wasn't scared about the surgery because the doctors and
nurses were so good,'' Elliott said. ``But it was something that I
knew was serious.''
</P>
<P>
   For weeks during the Spurs' championship run a year ago,
Elliott, his family and Spurs teammate Steve Kerr were the only
ones who knew just how serious and fatiguing the condition was and
that it was worsening by the day.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew how I felt and it wasn't real good, but I wanted to
play with it as long as I could,'' Elliott said. ``I knew I needed
a transplant.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Game 2 against Portland, the protein levels in Elliott's
urine were dangerously high, as was his blood pressure. Doctors
told Elliott not to play because his kidneys were not functioning
properly and he was placing himself in serious danger.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he hit maybe the biggest shot in the history of the
franchise, and in Game 5 of the title-clinching series against the
Knicks, there was Elliott once again with the game on the line.
</P>
<P>
   Before Game 5 Elliott heard criticism for ``disappearing''
defensively against Knicks scorer Allan Houston, but he refused to
mention his condition. Elliott spent most days lying in bed during
the series, hardly eating, and retaining water in his legs, face
and neck because of his condition.
</P>
<P>
   Still, when the Knicks took their last shot in Game 5, it was
Elliott that hustled to the baseline in front of the Knicks'
Latrell Sprewell, forcing Sprewell under the basket and into a bad
shot.
</P>
<P>
   Sprewell missed and the Spurs were NBA champions. Elliott hopped
into David Robinson's arms after the buzzer and in the jubilant
locker room afterward, he was seen hugging the championship trophy
as tears filled his eyes.
</P>
<P>
   Two days later, Elliott rode a barge along the San Antonio River
in the victory parade. What the NBA world didn't know was that
after the parade, Elliott went to the hospital for kidney dialysis.
</P>
<P>
   Weeks later, after the transplant, Johnson told Elliott he never
wanted to see him in a uniform again.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Spurs visit Compaq Center tonight to face the
Rockets, even if Elliott will not be in uniform, it's only a matter
of time.
</P>
<P>
   Everything about Elliott's attempt to become the first
transplant patient to play professional sports is complete, except
for the paperwork.
</P>
<P>
   The Spurs, frankly, have worried about Elliott attempting such a
comeback almost from the day he was discharged from the hospital
late in August. But Elliott has stayed determined.
</P>
<P>
   When he got home from the hospital after the transplant, he
promised doctors he would stay in bed. But he went to the foot of
the staircase in his house and tested himself, walking up and down
a single stair until he became dizzy.
</P>
<P>
   It seems everyone around him has told Elliott no, don't try this
_ the league, agents, lawyers, the players association.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I've signed 200 waivers,'' Elliott said. ``I
understand. I'm the one pressing the issue, not them. But I'll keep
signing the waivers until they let me play.''
</P>
<P>
   Months ago, Elliott circled Feb. 18 on the calendar as the day
he wanted to return to the floor _ Friday's game in San Antonio
against the Rockets.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could have played 10 minutes,'' he said, ``but I guess I
haven't signed enough waivers yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Spurs coach Gregg Popovich has called himself a ``mother hen''
when it comes to Elliott's attempted return. But no longer is it a
matter of if, but when. And Spurs players that have scrimmaged with
Elliott say his skills are better than ever.
</P>
<P>
   He gobbles small mounds of pills every morning and works out
twice a day, lifting weights, running, shooting, dunking. He plays
livelier than before and his brittle knees are holding up nicely.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm standing in awe looking at Sean,'' Robinson said. ``Here's
a man you know, the paycheck is going to be there. It's not like
he's doing it for the money. He's hanging in there, coming back
from a life-threatening surgery, and he just wants to be on the
floor. Every time I see a guy like that and see that kind of
passion, it just gives me energy. I realize how fortunate we are to
do what we do.''
</P>
<P>
   Before Friday's win over the Rockets, Elliott was slumped
against the scorer's table after running a series of drills and
sprints, when a man in his mid-40s called his name.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sean, I have to tell you something,'' the man said. ``I gave
my sister my kidney two years ago. You're special, Sean. God bless
you, sir.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Thanks,'' Elliott told the man, asking, ``How's your sister
doing? Tell her I'm with her.''
</P>
<P>
   This is his happily ever after. Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't been to a city yet where someone hasn't come up to
me like that,'' Elliott said. ``They ask me, `What can I expect?
How's my surgery going to be? Were you scared?'
</P>
<P>
   ``It's motivated me even more to do this. I want people to look
at me and say, `Look, it's going to be all right. Look how he's
doing.'''
</P>
<P>
   In the Spurs' locker room after a recent workout, Elliott took
off his jersey to show the eight-inch scar on the lower right side
of his abdomen, rubbing his hand across the scar and laughing,
``Nice, huh?''
</P>
<P>
   He has nothing to prove. He has a championship ring. He's proved
himself to everyone, but this is for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show what's possible for organ recipients,'' Elliott
said. ``Anything's possible.''

Lima keeps time in his own world
<TEXT>
<P>
   By FRAN BLINEBURY
</P>
<P>
   Houston Chronicle
</P>
<P>
   KISSIMMEE, Fla. _ The little slugger stands barely as tall as
the top of a catcher's shin guards but is unafraid to call out when
the walking giggle machine saunters by on his way to the next
workout station.
</P>
<P>
   ``Excuse me,'' shouts the kid with the round face and the brown
hair. ``Could I please get a baseball?''
</P>
<P>
   And Jose Lima stops dead in his tracks, turns to look at where
the tiny voice came from, then squats down at eye level and gives a
conspiratorial wink before rolling a ball into those hungry little
hands.
</P>
<P>
   Another gleeful convert whose clock has been reset to Lima Time.
</P>
<P>
   It is a state of mind somewhere between Margaritaville and a
parakeet who's lost in a marijuana field. And following a season in
which you didn't think Lima could get much higher on life, here he
comes on the first day of spring training like a mountain climber
who just found a set of stairs at the top of Mount Everest.
</P>
<P>
   ``The best day ever,'' Lima says.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it's the newest one.''
</P>
<P>
   We've all been searching for several years to find a chink in
this armor of perpetual giddiness, so far unsuccessfully.
</P>
<P>
   There he is, pulling up to the front of the Astros' training
complex in a carload of buddies, music playing, a modern-day
minstrel who provides his own soundtrack.
</P>
<P>
   There he is on one of the diamonds, working on a drill that
involves fielding ground balls and covering first base, and he's
keeping a running, one-sided dialogue with coach Matt Galante, who
is swinging the bat.
</P>
<P>
   There he is inside the clubhouse, talking to everyone, singing
to no one, letting fly with jokes and one-liners in two languages
and laughing out loud even when nobody else understands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Life is wonderful,'' Lima says. ``Every day I get to put on a
baseball uniform and they call it a job. Are you kidding?''
</P>
<P>
   Monday in Sarasota, Ken Griffey Jr. will hold what is being
billed as his only news conference of the spring. The Cincinnati
Reds have sent out detailed instructions on where Griffey and the
media will sit and how the session will run, probably looking more
like a presidential briefing. So many dour, rich young men in
sports these days.
</P>
<P>
   To talk with Lima, all you have to do is be in the same area
code.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look at how the sun is shining and there are old people and
young people and everybody is here to see baseball,'' he says. ``I
couldn't wait to get here.''
</P>
<P>
   Which is not to say Lima didn't enjoy a winter that had him
coming off a 21-win season and signing a three-year contract worth
$18.75 million. He spent time at home in the Dominican Republic,
where the $1.3 million, 7,000-square foot house he had built for
his mother was completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always told my mother that someday I was going to buy her a
mansion,'' Lima says. ``Man, to see the look on her face the day
she moved in, you don't put any price tag on that. Now, no matter
what might happen to me, I can say I did the thing I wanted to do
the most.''
</P>
<P>
   He also spent time at home in Houston, playing golf, eating at
his favorite restaurant, Hooter's, and enjoying his celebrity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to be out there in the crowds, talking to the people
who support the Astros, who make it possible for me to have this
life,'' he says. ``I talked to kids groups, told them to stay in
school, to say no to drugs, to be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never get tired of it. When I talk to some of the fans who
tell me that they have been coming to the Astros games for 20 or 30
years and say that they really appreciate what I bring, that
they've never had anybody like me here, man, that gives me goose
bumps. Look, right here on my arms.''
</P>
<P>
   He won 16 games in 1998 and some called it a fluke. So he went
out and won 21 in 1999 and earned the big contract.
</P>
<P>
   Now he reads a comment in Baseball Weekly that says Lima can't
keep it up and he shakes his head.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love to prove people wrong,'' Lima says. ``Been doing it for
so much of my life. Man, there were all those years when I came to
camp and had to fight just to win a job, to keep my career going.
So this is nothing at all to me. They say I can't win 20 again?
Well, we'll see.
</P>
<P>
   ``I used to be just a thrower. Now I'm a pitcher and I know what
I can do. Just watch.''
</P>
<P>
   So you watch and listen and marvel and wonder if there are ever
any bad days in Lima Time.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sure,'' he says. ``That's when I get on the phone to my wife
or my mother or my agent. The world will never see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Especially not now, when the sun is so bright, the sky is so
blue, the grass is so green, the game is so fresh and it's the best
day ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until tomorrow,'' Jose Lima says.

USC LOSES, THEN BRAWLS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEMPE, Ariz. _ USC's NCAA hopes are evaporating thanks to a
listless performance against Arizona State, but the Trojans put up
a much better fight after the game Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Immediately following the Trojans' 93-81 loss to the Sun Devils
before 11,534, a brawl involving both teams broke out that lasted
about two minutes and included Arizona State students charging the
court before order was restored.
</P>
<P>
   The main participants were USC guard Jeff Trepagnier and Arizona
State forward Awvee Storey, although USC guard Malachi Thurston and
Arizona State forward Tanner Shell were also seen throwing punches.
</P>
<P>
   There were more than 100 people on the court by the time the
teams finally dispersed and went to the locker rooms.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what caused the melee depended on whom you spoke with.
USC said Storey hit Trepagnier as the teams were walking off the
court. Arizona State said Trepagnier hit Storey.
</P>
<P>
   ``My kids saw Storey hit Jeff. The guy took shots all night,''
USC coach Henry Bibby said. ``The kid said something to Jeff and
jumped at him.''
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier was less clear about what happened: ``He came up and
there was a squabble.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if Storey threw a punch, Trepagnier said: ``I don't know.
I can't remember. I was just trying to protect myself. He got in my
face.''
</P>
<P>
   But the USC players were aware Trepagnier threw a punch.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hear Jeff threw a pretty good one at him,'' guard Nate Hair
said.
</P>
<P>
   Storey said he never threw a punch at Trepagnier: ``I got
cheap-shotted. I didn't see it coming.''
</P>
<P>
   What remains to be seen is if the Pacific-10 Conference, sure to
investigate the incident, will decide to suspend any of the
participants.
</P>
<P>
   It's doubtful the two schools involved will agree on what
happened, based on the remarks of the coaches.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never had a situation like that in all my years of
coaching,'' Arizona State coach Rob Evans said. ``It just kind of
shows what kind of team they are. They tried every way to get us
unfocused but we wouldn't.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Bibby: ``I know the whole game my guys were getting hit
hard. Jeff got hit real hard. There was nothing called in the game.
Somebody has to see two elbows thrown at him during the game.
Storey threw one and (Eddie) House threw another. But that's what
their strategy was, to grab and hold us.''
</P>
<P>
   Trepagnier had a swollen lip after the game, which he said was
the result of a House elbow. Storey also had a swollen lip.
</P>
<P>
   The game was definitely physical. There were 58 fouls called (32
on ASU, 26 on USC), and two Trojan starters (Trepagnier and Kostas
Charissis) fouled out. Storey also fouled out.
</P>
<P>
   The seeds for discontent had been planted well before the game.
Bibby was upset over the physical nature of last month's contest at
the Sports Arena, when Sam Clancy broke his foot and Jarvis Turner
broke his ankle.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never seen such a catastrophe in my life,'' Bibby said.
``We know they're fouling every time down the court and the
officials let it get out of hand. It's terrible. This is what you
have when they do that altercations.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona State became perturbed Friday afternoon when its
practice at the Student Recreation Center was delayed more than 45
minutes because USC's practice ran longer than scheduled.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was stuff written on basketballs, and we had shootaround
an hour late,'' Evans said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are classless,'' added House, who scored a game-high 28
points. ``I lost all respect for them the way they handled
themselves at the end of the game. The way they were talking during
the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Right after the altercation, Bibby, USC athletic director Mike
Garrett, Evans and Arizona State athletic director Kevin White
discussed the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone was reasonable. It was really professional,'' Garrett
said. ``The game was over and we decided, `Let's come to an
appropriate response.' It was resolved with handshakes.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the game, the Trojans (13-11, 6-6) once again seemed to
fade, building a 23-12 lead that shrank to 39-38 at halftime.
Arizona State (16-9, 8-5) then had a 12-0 run in the opening
minutes of the second half to take a 52-43 lead. USC cut the lead
to three points (57-54), but a 12-4 ASU spurt pretty much put the
game away.
</P>
<P>
   The Trojans shot 37.7 percent from the field, and their starting
guards Trepagnier and Brandon Granville were 9 for 28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought they outplayed us,'' Bibby said. ``They wanted it
more than we did. They played harder.''
</P>
<P>
   What it means is simple: The Trojans must win five of their
final six games if they hope to earn an NCAA bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an even bigger sense of urgency now,'' Bluthenthal
said.

`WHERE'S TIGER?' IS BIG QUESTION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ As a ragtag army of tournament leaders trudges
into the final round of the Nissan Open, the question is what will
strike Riviera first today, that Pacific storm or Hurricane Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   A chance of sprinkles this morning is in the forecast, a chance
of rain this afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Tiger warning is in effect for Greater Pacific
Palisades.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe you have the impression the rest of the players on the PGA
Tour keep talking about Tiger Woods only because The Media keep
asking about him. Not so.
</P>
<P>
   With six wins and a second-place finish in his past seven
tournaments, Tiger hangs over his opponents, a cloud packing
thunder and lightning.
</P>
<P>
   Listen to the leaders Saturday as they knock the mud off their
spikes, tip their caps back on their heads and try to forecast the
next 18 holes (or however many holes the weather permits).
</P>
<P>
   David Sutherland, the bespectacled Sacramentan who leads by a
stroke at 9 under par, having followed a 67 Thursday and a 69
Friday with a 68 Saturday, talks about his chances of completing
his first PGA Tour victory today. He says he'll try not to glance
at a leader board until the back nine.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to expect something (great) from Tiger,''
Sutherland volunteers. ``A 65, 66, maybe better.'' He laughs --
uneasily.
</P>
<P>
   Kirk Triplett, the steady but winless Washington state native
who is one of six men tied for second, a stroke behind Sutherland,
is asked if the conditions might favor any particular type of
golfer today.
</P>
<P>
   ``You mean like Tiger Woods?'' Triplett says.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, I don't mean Tiger, but if you insist ...
</P>
<P>
   ``I think all conditions suit him,'' Triplett says.
</P>
<P>
   Brandel Chamblee, among those tied for second, is asked what
sort of score might win today.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it doesn't rain but it's windy, 8 or 9 under par can win
this tournament,'' Chamblee says. ``Where's Tiger? Six (under)?
(Then) 12 under ( can win it).''
</P>
<P>
   And so on. When none of the leaders seems inclined to take
control, everybody looks toward Tiger.
</P>
<P>
   On Thursday, the Daily News' Karen Crouse was interviewing Hal
Sutton's college coach, Floyd Horgen, who was on the phone from
Montana. She told him Sutton was five strokes behind leader J.P.
Hayes after the first round.
</P>
<P>
   ``What did Tiger shoot?'' came the reply from Montana.
</P>
<P>
   After three rounds, 19 players are within two strokes of the
lead. Next on the list, tied for 20th with nine others, including
David Duval, is you-know-who.
</P>
<P>
   Woods is three strokes off the lead despite a four-putting the
13th hol e Saturday. He wouldn't loom as such a threat if anybody
else had taken full advantage of what have seemed like perfect
conditions the past three days.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of golfers are shooting low scores, but none is making
like Ted Tryba, who was 13 under par when he began the final round
of the 1999 Nissan with the lead (only to finish tied with Woods
for second behind winner Ernie Els).
</P>
<P>
   ``It feels to me like 12 or 13 under should be leading,''
Triplett says of the conditions.
</P>
<P>
   One explanation for the good-but-not-great scores is the
swirling wind Saturday. Golfers would prefer a predictable gale to
swirling wind.
</P>
<P>
   Another is the overnight changes in the course. The par-3 sixth
hole, the one with the mid-green bunker, had its tee moved back 40
yards Saturday, and the par-4 12th got 35 yards longer.
</P>
<P>
   Then there's that old Riviera scapegoat, the coastal grass known
as Poa annua, pronounced Po' Anna by the golfers. It grows on the
greens and makes them bumpy each afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``It (the ball) looks like a basketball dribbling down there
once in a while,'' Triplett says. ``You become a little more
tentative (putting).' '
</P>
<P>
   The winner could turn out to be the player who's comfortable
enough wit h the final-round pressure to get aggressive with his
putts. And get lucky and hit the holes.
</P>
<P>
   Whom might that be?
</P>
<P>
   ``He can't physically come grab me and throw me down on the
fairway,'' Chamblee says of Tiger Woods. ``I'd like to be the one
he's trying to (beat), trying to hole a 6-iron to tie. My hat's off
to him if he does it. ''

<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. -- Gene Orza, associate general counsel of the
players association, said Saturday the case of Dodgers third
baseman Adrian Beltre is at least a month from being resolved.
</P>
<P>
   While all parties involved eagerly await the announcement of
even a hearing date for the grievance, Orza said the process is
only in its infancy . Meanwhile, Dodgers managing general partner
Bob Daly said the club would sign Beltre to a multi-year contract
if ``it was the right thing to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Beltre is seeking free agency because the Dodgers signed him
before he turned 16.
</P>
<P>
   Orza said the player association was yet to file the stipulation
for the appeal. After that's done, the next step is to file briefs
for the case , he said. At that point, arbitrator Shyam Das sets a
hearing date, the players association and Major League Baseball
present their sides, and then Das makes a ruling.
</P>
<P>
   ``It won't be (started) until the John Rocker issue is
concluded, and that could be some time still,'' Orza said. ``The
time frame (for Beltre) has been moved back. I don't think you
should expect anything until the end of March.''
</P>
<P>
   That could put a heavy burden on the Dodgers. Word is spreading
through baseball that the Dodgers are confident the ruling will be
in their favor, but they are prepared to end the ordeal by signing
Beltre to a multi-year deal, if the price is right. Sources said it
would likely be a three-year deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It has to be a reasonable situation,'' Daly said. ``I'm
prepared for this thing to go to a hearing. But I hope it gets
resolved. My wish is for this not to be an issue anymore. We would
do something (contract-wise) , but it has to be reasonable for the
Dodgers.''
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Beltre, in the Dominican Republic readying for
Tuesday's reporting date, remained firm on his stance that he wants
to remain with the club. But because it's a legal case still
pending, he's been advised not to talk about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Dodgers treat me right,'' said Beltre, 20, who hit .275
with 15 homers and 67 RBI in `99. ``They play baseball the way I
like to play baseball. I don't think (the pending case) will affect
me. I don't think about it. All I have to do is get ready for
spring training.''
</P>
<P>
   With Das not expected to rule for more than a month, it leaves
Beltre's agent, Scott Boras, and the Dodgers with plenty of time to
still negotiate a deal. But the late date of the situation has the
Dodgers wondering what's taking so long. The case was first
presented in November, commissioner Bud Selig ruled in December and
the grievance was field in early January.
</P>
<P>
   And while the Dodgers are optimistic Beltre will remain with the
club, there is concern that if he's lost, they'll have only a week
to develop a platoon between Kevin Orie and Jose Vizcaino.
</P>
<P>
   Osuna optimistic: Fresh off a season in which Antonio Osuna
pitched in two more games than he had surgeries on his elbow (5 to
3), the right-hander beamed with optimism that he could be back by
openi ng day.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the Dodgers don't think so. They have a June 1 target
date.
</P>
<P>
   ``He said he's going to be ready by opening day and I said the
all-star break,'' Dodgers manager Davey Johnson said. ``He's way
ahead of what I thought he would be.''
</P>
<P>
   Even so, Osuna's yet to throw off a mound. And with an influx of
right-handers in Gregg Olson, Terry Adams, Alan Mills, Mike Fetters
and Dan Naulty in camp, the Dodgers aren't in a hurry to add Osuna
to the mix.
</P>
<P>
   Odds and ends: Johnson likes to group certain players together
for workouts, and this year he made sure to place right-handers
Darren Dreifort, Chan Ho Park, Mike Judd and Jeff Williams with
veteran Orel Hershiser. . ..Describing rookie right-hander Eric
Gagne, Johnson said ``he's meaner than a water moccasin.''

KINGS LOSE TO SABRES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUFFALO -- Before he requested a trade, Vladimir Tsyplakov asked
for respect.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Kings decided last month that he never would be
more than a great stick handler who refused to shoot, Tsyplakov was
shipped to the Buffalo Sabres for low draft pick.
</P>
<P>
   That is where his old club picked up the story Saturday night
and quickly ended a chapter of their own.
</P>
<P>
   Tsyplakov scored the winning goal and assisted on two others as
the Sabres halted Kings five-game winning streak 4-1 in front of a
sell out crowd of 18,690 at Marine Midland Arena.
</P>
<P>
   Granted, it was his first goal since coming over on Jan. 23. But
Tsyplakov made a big difference in stopping the Kings' momentum
that peaked the night before with an impressive victory over the
Detroit Red Wings.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of flying to Edmonton with three victories to open their
longest trip of the year, they were sluggish in the second night of
back-to-back games.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone in here is happy for him although we wished
he hadn't done it tonight,'' Kings goaltender Jamie Storr said.
``He always worked very hard in practice and he had great stick
handling skill. Maybe this is the place where he can show that.''
</P>
<P>
   It certainly wasn't going to happen with the Kings. Tsyplakov
filled in on the first line at earlier this season when Luc
Robitaille, Ziggy Palffy and Jozef Stumpel were injured.
</P>
<P>
   His play was sometimes brilliant like Nov. 2 in Pittsburgh when
he deked three Pittsburgh defenders then slipped a pass in front to
Donald Audette, who scored. Most of the time it was frustrating for
teammates and coaches. Tsyplakov is from Russia where many players
are raised to pass first, score second.
</P>
<P>
   When the injured players returned, Tsyplakov mostly sat in the
stands, watching his career go nowhere. His agent went to Kings GM
Dave Taylor seeking a move.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I didn't enjoy myself there, but there were so
many scratches,'' said Tsyplakov, a King for almost five years. ``I
never felt like I got a chance. A game like tonight means
everything.''
</P>
<P>
   In Buffalo, Tsyplakov has not become an everyday player. But
with the Sabres one spot from making the playoffs after reaching
the Eastern Conference finals last year, he has been a boost to the
offense.
</P>
<P>
   He also brought another weapon to a team that Saturday scored
more than two goals for just the second time in 14 games. Captain
Michael Peca scored twice and Miroslav Satan added an empty netter
with 30 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's strange because he came to a team that has had trouble
taking advantage of their chances,'' Peca said after the Sabres
scored more than two goals for just the second time in 14 games.
``We've been afraid at times to pull the trigger. But we've worked
on it in practice and made sure Sippy takes shots when he has them.
He does the same for us.''
</P>
<P>
   After Ziggy Palffy scored his 23rd goal with just 2:58 gone in
the first period, Tsyplakov helped tie it with some hustle behind
the Kings net. Storr was attempting to clear the puck and made a
poor pass. Tsyplakov got it and passed to Peca in front.
</P>
<P>
   Midway through the second period, Tsyplakov did it himself,
taking a pass from Peca and beating Storr for the eventual game
winner. It was his seventh of the season, but the first since Jan.
3 in a Kings loss at Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Tsyplakov acknowledged his second assist -- on a goal by Peca
with 7:32 gone in the third period -- could have been called for a
holding penalty on Mattias Norstrom. Tysplakov held Norstrom's
stick as Peca circled behind him and beat Storr.
</P>
<P>
   Kings coach Andy Murray went to referee Dan Maroueli with a tape
to clarify the play. But Norstrom said it was too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was mad at the time, but what can you do,'' he said. ``In a
way I was glad for Sippy. It has been a long time coming for him. I
know this must have been great for him beating his old team. I know
he feels good inside.''

PEPPERDINE WINS ON EMOTIONAL NIGHT AT LMU
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By VINCENT BONSIGNORE  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the night Loyola Marymount remembered its past,
Pepperdine focused on what lies ahead.
</P>
<P>
   This time, the future won out. The Waves, playing against
history and emotion, remained alone in first place in the West
Coast Conference with a 77-65 win over the host Lions on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine needs wins in its final two regular-season games to
claim the WCC crown outright.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't easy, considering the poignant significance of the
night and emotionally charged atmosphere at Gerston Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   In a touching halftime ceremony, LMU retired the jerseys of the
late Hank Gathers and Bo Kimble, the two forces behind the Lions'
talented teams in the late 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Gathers collapsed and died at Gerston Pavilion in 1990 during
the Lions' WCC tournament semifinal against Portland. LMU, led by
Gathers' boyhood buddy Bo Kimble, shocked the country over the next
two weeks, advancing all the way to the Elite Eight of the NCAA
Tournament before falling to Nevada Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   The current Lions, playing inspired before a raucous home crowd,
fed off the atmosphere and stayed close throughout.
</P>
<P>
   The Lions' (2-23, 0-12) only two wins this year are against
against non- Division I-A opponents, yet they easily played their
best game of the season Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   But it wasn't enough against a Pepperdine (21-6, 11-1) team
trying to secure a conference crown and stay in position for an
NCAA Tournament berth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew from the get-go it was going to be a war,'' said
Pepperdine forward Tommie Prince. ``They had the ceremony and
Loyola is always hyped to play us so we knew it was going to be
tough in that the game would probably come down to the last
stretch.''
</P>
<P>
   David Lalazarian led the Waves with a career-high 23 points to
go along with 10 rebounds. Brandon Armstrong added 17 points and
Craig Lewis had 10. Nick Sheppard had 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Lalazarian is a key reserve who provides scoring off the bench.
His play did not surprise Prince.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows the type of character we have, and it shows that we
have guys to come off the bench and get the job done if the
starters aren't doing their job,'' Prince said. ``It's a different
guy getting it done for us every night, so it's tough for teams to
prepare for us because they don't know who that player is going to
be.''
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine shot just 42.6 from the floor (7 of 15 on
3-pointers), but held LMU to only 33.8 percent shooting with a
stifling effort defensively.
</P>
<P>
   Rupert McClendon led the Lions with 22 points. Pablo Machado had
18 points and 13 rebounds.
</P>
<P>
   Pepperdine closes the regular season on the road at San Diego on
Thursday and St. Mary's Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   San Diego upset Gonzaga last Thursday to push the Waves in first
place by themselves.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves started pulling away midway through the second half,
using 13-5 run to move ahead, 61-46 after Armstrong's two free
throws.
</P>
<P>
   Lalazarian kept Pepperdine's lead intact, hitting a running
layup in traffic and a 15-footer to make it 67-53 with four minutes
remaining.
</P>
<P>
   The Waves played the final three minutes without Tezale Archie,
who was called for a flagrant foul and thrown out of the game.

<P>
   ATLANTA_ Shaquille O'Neal made 15 of 20 free throws against the
Timberwolves, 11 of 12 against the Bulls and 6 of 9 against the
Hornets, including two with 22 seconds left to ice the Lakers'
victory.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neal, 32 of 41 in his past three games, runs back to the bench
with his right hand still in follow-through position _ having just
figured out he was supposed to be following through, all these
years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You saw the way it left my hand out there,'' O'Neal said. ``I
ain't missing no more. I'm at a point in my life where it's time to
concentrate now. So, I've been concentrating these last couple
games. I've developed more concentration, more confidence.''
</P>
<P>
   And the pose? ``That's a message. To whoever. That hack-a-Shaq
stuff will never ever work again. Period. Print it.''
</P>
<P>
   SAME OLD, SAME OLD
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, over at Los Angeles' other franchise, the Clippers,
we hear Derek Anderson saying, ``My mom said that I've changed,
that I hardly smile anymore. I guess she's right because, out here,
it is hard to show it. We should never be getting beat by 20 points
or have big leads and lose like we do. It's tough to know we're
going to play only for a certain time (each game).
</P>
<P>
   ``I was up for the challenge,'' Anderson said. ``I thought I
could come in and help change the situation. I really didn't know
anything about them. I didn't know one thing. I had never even
heard of (owner Donald Sterling).... It hit me during the first
couple exhibition games, when I noticed the crowds. I played in
front of sellout crowds at every level before I got here....
</P>
<P>
   ``I could understand if I was the only one who could play at
this level and we lost that many games, but that's not the case,''
he said. ``With us, there are just too many excuses. We should be
getting it done, regardless. This season has been like a
nightmare.''
</P>
<P>
   Can you spell q-u-i-t? ``If you look at our body language,''
Maurice Taylor said, ``it looks like we do.''
</P>
<P>
   WAITING FOR WALLACE
</P>
<P>
   Scottie Pippen wonders if Portland teammate Rasheed Wallace will
ever completely tap his vast reserves of talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``He might not ever scratch it,'' Pippen said. ``He just has so
much talent, it's kind of funny sometimes when you watch him. When
we're in practice, if he would just put a little bit more effort
into trying to perfect a few things, it would change his whole game
and make him a much better player. He's still a great player as he
is. He has so many tools, he can do so many things. None of his
talents are just so overwhelming that he doesn't have to work at
them. If he worked at them, he could be one of the greatest players
in the game. But I'm not sure 'Sheed wants that.''

 &HT;    Drivers shift gears with new cars, teams
 &HT;    By Rick Minter
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ When a football team isn't winning, the
first move is to change coaches. In racing, it's the driver that
sits in the hot seat.
</P>
<P>
   As the Winston Cup cars line up for the Daytona 500, even
die-hard fans might need a cheat sheet to keep up with who's
driving what car.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most visible changes is with the No. 28 Ford made
famous by the late Davey Allison and Ernie Irvan.
</P>
<P>
   Kenny Irwin drove the car for the past two seasons, but was
unable to live up to his billing. Irwin is being replaced by Ricky
Rudd, who disbanded his own No. 10 Ford team to drive a Robert
Yates-owned car. It comes from the same stable that prepared the
car Dale Jarrett drove to the 1999 Winston Cup championship.
</P>
<P>
   Rudd, who struggled as a team owner and driver, is expected to
be a contender for victories and possibly a championship.
</P>
<P>
   His car number, 10, will be on the Tyler Jet Motorsports Pontiac
driven by Johnny Benson, who left a Jack Roush team and will
replace David Green. Green is returning to a full-time ride in
NASCAR's Busch Grand National Series, where he won the series
championship in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   Irwin will move to the No. 42 car owned by Felix Sabates and
driven last year by Joe Nemechek. Irwin said he is motivated by a
desire to show his critics _ and his former car owner _ that he can
compete in Winston Cup.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to show Robert (Yates) that I can get the job done,''
Irwin said. ``I don't think he said, `Kenny couldn't get it done.'
He just couldn't get the whole deal together for me to get it done
in the 28 car.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite what has happened to him, Irwin said he doesn't think
Yates _ or other Winston Cup owners _ are too quick to make
changes.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're not performing, at some point somebody says, `Hey,
we've got to make the change,''' he said. ``The owners have to make
the team successful.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Nemechek got his walking papers in midseason last year, then
won at New Hampshire during his lame-duck stage. This year, he will
drive the No. 33 car prepared by Andy Petree.
</P>
<P>
   ``As they say, my stock went up at New Hampshire,'' Nemechek
said. ``That day, we outran them fair and square.''
</P>
<P>
   Nemechek said he thought he was making progress in the Sabates
car before he was released. Now he's starting over with Petree.
``Hopefully, it'll be a better circumstance,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ken Schrader left the Petree car to drive the No. 36 car that
became available when Irvan retired. With the MB2 Motorsports
team's close ties to Hendrick Motorsports, the latest Chevrolet
racing technology should be at Schrader's disposal. But so far, the
MB2 team is winless, and Schrader last won in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that we've got everything it takes to win, and that's
what we expect to do,'' Schrader said.
</P>
<P>
   And why has it been nearly 10 years since he won? ``If I could
answer that I would have fixed it already,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Nadeau, who filled in for Irvan in the No. 36 from August
until the end of the 1999 season, has moved to Hendrick Motorsports
and will drive the No. 25 car.
</P>
<P>
   Nadeau, unlike other drivers, said he feels no pressure to
produce results.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only pressure is what I put on myself,'' Nadeau said.
``We're going to have awesome equipment this year, and you're going
to see a big change out of myself this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Wally Dallenbach, who drove No. 25 last year, will replace Ted
Musgrave in the No. 75 Ford.
</P>
<P>
   A frustrated Musgrave parked the car during the race at
Homestead, Fla., and promptly resigned. He is not on the Winston
Cup roster for 2000.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Mast, who drove the No. 98 for Cale Yarborough last year,
has signed on to drive Larry Hedrick's No. 41 this year.
Yarborough's team is for sale and might not run a full schedule
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Underlying most of the changes is the pressure from sponsors to
perform on the race track. Companies shelling out $8 million a year
or more per driver expect results. And that pressure affects all
but the most successful.
</P>
<P>
   Even rookie Dale Earnhardt Jr., who drives a car owned by his
father and who has won two Busch series titles in a row, feels the
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's under contract, and everybody's under expectations
to win,'' he said. ``They're changing drivers, changing teams every
year. Everybody feels it.''
</P>
<P>
   Sponsors don't deny that they put pressure on drivers to win.
</P>
<P>
   W.A. DeVore is senior vice president of Citgo Petroleum Corp.,
which sponsors Elliott Sadler and the Wood Brothers' No. 21 Ford.
He said he expects Sadler to notch some top-10 finishes this year
and eventually take the car to Victory Lane.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing takes a tremendous investment, and the return we get
off that investment is media coverage,'' DeVore said. ``And we get
media coverage when you're up there in the top 10 and especially
when you win a race, so there's tremendous pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the competition is stiffer now, so there's even more
pressure.''

 &HT;    Pontiac, Ford, Chevy angle for edge
 &HT;    By Al Levine
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The sniping about Pontiac's alleged
aerodynamic advantage over Chevrolet and Ford got personal at the
end of last season. At least Bobby Labonte took it that way.
</P>
<P>
   After he qualified 37th for the last race at Atlanta Motor
Speedway and then went on to win it, Labonte was accused of
sandbagging. ``I heard it all weekend in the garage,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The inference was that he purposely qualified poorly and
intentionally lay back in the field.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of comical now,'' Labonte said, ``but at the time,
it wasn't that comical. It went to the wrong side of my nerves. We
changed motors, steering boxes, springs, everything. I guess,
(with) all the talk that the Pontiacs had an advantage, they
thought we were just sandbagging. That wasn't the case. I guess
some people didn't know we (usually) run good in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't sandbagging. We run as hard as we can every lap. I
guess, whenever you're busting your butt and trying to go fast and
you're about to wreck and you do hit it right and win the race,
somebody says you're sandbagging. If we were sandbagging, we should
have been sandbagging the whole race, I think. We didn't go there
to sandbag.''
</P>
<P>
   Pontiac drivers probably will have one more weekend to endure
such jibes. At today's Daytona 500, they will have essentially the
same car that won four of the last five races in 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Chevrolet is debuting a new racing Monte Carlo this season, and
Ford is taking the wraps off a new racing Taurus.
</P>
<P>
   Drivers of those makes complained last season that the Pontiacs
had more down force, thus increasing its advantage on flatter
tracks. Winston Cup director of competition Gary Nelson said at the
season finale at AMS that NASCAR might order alterations. More
recently, he said NASCAR will delay making changes until it sees
how the car compares with the new Chevys and Fords at Daytona.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's possibilities of making changes, but we're looking at
how these new cars fit in relative to the Pontiac, which is a known
quantity,'' Nelson said.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, Joe Gibbs' Pontiac-driving team is holding its
breath.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nothing's happened, and thank God,'' Gibbs said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at last year, the best Chevrolet won seven
races, the best Ford won six, the best Pontiac won five,'' he said.
``When you look at the point standings, No. 1 was a Ford, No. 2 was
our Pontiac, No. 4 was our Pontiac, and then the Chevys and Fords
come in all mixed in there. So, there's three Pontiacs in the top
10. Is this thing pretty even right now? You'd have to say, yes, it
is. I think NASCAR knows that it's even.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Ford and Chevy drivers were crying about Pontiacs last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Where we got in trouble is when they put all our cars in the
wind tunnel the first part of the year,'' Gibbs said. ``Our car
showed it couldn't hold up to the Chevy and the Ford with the rear
down force. What they did was give us a little more on the rear
spoiler. Well, that started everybody screaming.''
</P>
<P>
   Pontiacs raced with a spoiler that was about a quarter-inch
higher than Chevy's and Ford's.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever we won a race, it was because of the car, not because
we were good,'' Gibbs said. ``Whenever they won a race, it was
because they were good. That's part of life in Winston Cup. I think
what we're scared about right now is they're getting ready to come
out with two new cars to race against us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Pontiacs have had that body with those rules all last
year,'' said Robbie Loomis, Jeff Gordon's crew chief. ``They've got
a lot of stuff worked out. The Chevrolet teams are going to have to
work extra hard to figure out where we need to place the bodies and
how to build the fenders to get what we need out of it. I think
we've got a real competitive race car.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Makar, crew chief on Labonte's No. 18 Pontiac, has heard
reports that the 2000 Taurus is a better car for Daytona than last
year.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't really want an advantage,'' Makar said. ``If we can be
on even terms with both of those manufacturers, I feel like we can
race with them.''

 &HT;    GOODWILL GAMES NOTEBOOK
 &HT;    By KAREN ROSEN
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ Brian Boitano was Goodwill Games a-go-go
Saturday as Brian Orser's hopes at beating his old rival were
gone-gone.
</P>
<P>
   Boitano, who won the famous ``Battle of the Brians'' at the 1988
Olympics, worked with the same choreographer who did the Gap
``khaki-a-go-go'' commercial and used the same music. He had three
triple jumps to Orser's two to edge the Canadian. One of the seven
judges gave each a 10 on the pro scale for presentation.
</P>
<P>
   The other three competitors relied on gimmicks.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's Alexei Urmanov, who did a Phantom of the Opera routine,
tripped over the cape which he had dropped on the ice earlier.
Philippe Candeloro of France also wore a cape -- as well as a skirt
-- for his Braveheart routine. He got a standing ovation for a
program that included a simulation of a battle, surrender and
execution. He also showed the audience his underwear.
</P>
<P>
   Viktor Petrenko did his routine with a partner, a female dummy
that was attached to him. The audience loved him, and he got two
10s for presentation, but his technical scores were low.
</P>
<P>
   TRACK CONTROVERSY
</P>
<P>
   One day after five male athletes withdrew from the luge
competition citing safety factors on the new $24 million track,
Goodwill Games founder Ted Turner wasn't concerned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not really aware of it,'' he said. ``I've been at the
events, and I don't know what it's about.''
</P>
<P>
   But hometown hero Jim Shea, who is leading the skeleton
competition on the same track, was disappointed that three-time
Olympic champion Georg Hackl and the others gave the track the cold
shoulder.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a tough track,'' Shea said, pointing out that none of
the sliders had many practice runs. ``We go over there (to Europe)
to compete and we have a lot of trouble. The Americans never
complain and we never back out. For them to back out is pretty
unsportsmanlike.
</P>
<P>
   ``They realized they couldn't win and they pulled out, in my
opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   THE GAMES GO ON
</P>
<P>
   While the site for the 2003 Winter Goodwill Games is still up in
the air, Calgary has committed to host the 2005 Games. Calgary, the
1988 Olympic site, chose 2005 so the event will coincide with
Alberta's 100th anniversary celebration.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadians plan to add hockey and probably long-track
speedskating to the schedule. One of the 2003 candidates is
Sarajevo, the war-ravaged 1984 Olympic host city.
</P>
<P>
   The next summer Goodwill Games will be held in Brisbane,
Australia, in August-September 2001.
</P>
<P>
   Ted speaks, sort of:
</P>
<P>
   Turner said he might entertain non-Goodwill Games questions
after a press conference Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like what?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``John Rocker.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No!...What's your other question?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Um...''
</P>
<P>
   ``Like how am I doing with my wife?'' he asked, referring to his
separation from Jane Fonda.
</P>
<P>
   ``Well, yeah.''
</P>
<P>
   ``None of your business! How are you doing with your
boyfriend?'' Then Turner laughed and went to his next photo
opportunity.

 &HT;    Shea family tradition rides skeleton sled
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ A couple of years ago, Jack Shea showed his
son a photo that he'd come across amid his scrapbooks and
memorabilia. It showed Jack as a young man and scrawled in pencil
were the words, ``I want to be like him, Jim Shea.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't spell hardly anything right but my name,'' Jim Shea
said.
</P>
<P>
   Like his father, he became an Olympian. Now his own son, Jimmy,
is on the brink of continuing the family tradition. If he makes the
2002 Olympic team, the popular Lake Placid family would become the
first in the United States to send three generations to the Winter
Games. And they'll have done it in three different sports: On
skates, skis and sleds.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Shea was a double gold medalist in speedskating in 1932 and
still wears his United States team coat. With then-New York Gov.
Franklin Roosevelt in the audience, he won the first event of the
Lake Placid Olympics.
</P>
<P>
   Shea, 89, a former local politician, won the 500- and
1,500-meters at the Olympic oval, an outdoor rink which is just
down the street from Jim's liquor store and the Artist's Cafe,
where Jimmy was once a waiter.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Shea, 62, competed in cross country skiing and nordic
combined (which also includes ski jumping) at the 1964 Games in
Innsbruck, Austria. He calls himself ``a noncontender'' who was
proud to help carry in the Olympic flag. His wife Judy nearly made
the 1960 Olympic team in alpine skiing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just the bridge,'' he said. ``I'm just the go-between
between the generations.''
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy, 31, is the 1999 world skeleton champion and had the two
fastest runs Saturday at the Winter Goodwill Games, leading by more
than a second over Snorre Pedersen of Norway and American Chris
Soule. He'll race again today in front of family, friends and other
well-wishers.
</P>
<P>
   Skeleton was in the 1928 and 1948 Olympics at St. Moritz,
Switzerland, then was dropped from the Games. Jimmy Shea, who has
his grandfather's gift of gab, lobbied for it to be included in
Salt Lake City in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Anyone who's ever ridden a sled or toboggan can appreciate
skeleton. Athletes drive down the bobsled/luge run headfirst on a
sled reaching speeds up to 80 mph and forces of about 5 G's. Their
chin guards scrape the ice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like to scare myself,'' said Shea. ``You're trying to
control what's almost out of control. It's never the same twice;
you're always trying to get better and faster.''
</P>
<P>
   Jack Shea watched Saturday via the video screen from the bottom
of the run. ``I would like to have been up at the start,'' he said,
``but at 89 years, the hills are steeper than they used to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Although the elder Shea said he's always tried to impress upon
his grandson ``what a great honor it is to represent his country in
international competition,'' Jimmy wasn't weaned on the family
sports history.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was probably 11 years old when I realized I'd seen my
grandfather on TV twice a year and that he was a bigshot doing
something,'' said Jimmy. ``My father was really humble about it. He
never really talked about it. I didn't realize he was in the
Olympics until I was little older. I saw him on TV and said, 'Dad,
what did you do?'''
</P>
<P>
   Jim Shea said that becoming a three-generation Olympic family is
``a dream that we've had. My only concern is that there's not too
much pressure on (Jimmy).''
</P>
<P>
   The youngest Shea's first love was hockey. He attended every
hockey game at the 1980 Olympics, including the ``Miracle on Ice''
U.S. win over the Soviet Union. His father thought he'd play
semipro. Then Jimmy tried bobsled. But with top sleds costing
$40,000, he switched to luge, then flipped over to skeleton. The
smaller sleds cost only about $3,000.
</P>
<P>
   Within five years, he was world champion.
</P>
<P>
   Jack Shea, who finally hung up his skates about five years ago
because of a bad back, didn't see his son compete in the Olympics.
As the supervisor of the town of North Elba, N.Y., he said, ``I
felt I had to stay home. My wife was real mad at me for doing
that.''
</P>
<P>
   But he hopes to be in Salt Lake City.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm around in 2002, I'll be the most excited, most happy
man in the world,'' he said. ``I just know that Jimmy in 2002 will
be in contention for a gold medal, and what an honor it would be to
see my grandson stand on the podium, and have the flag raised and
`Star-Spangled Banner' play.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like 70 years earlier.

 &HT;    `Electronic house call' system gaining notice
 &HT;    By Andy Miller
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ The team of techies and medical folks knew the project
looked promising _ an electronic system to bring health care into a
patient's home. A high-tech return of the house call.
</P>
<P>
   ``We knew it had potential,'' said John Peifer, a senior
research scientist at Georgia Tech. He was one of more than a dozen
researchers from Tech and Augusta's Medical College of Georgia
developing the invention.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1995, ``We didn't realize the full potential,'' adds
Peifer, noting that the Internet then was still in its infancy.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the prospects for the CyberCare ``electronic house call''
system _ a melding of medicine and the Internet that can monitor
patients at home _ are being noticed on Wall Street, even before
the Food and Drug Administration approves the device.
</P>
<P>
   Shares of the parent firm, Florida-based CyberCare, were trading
at less than $1 at the time of an August merger. The share price
has zoomed to $36.25 at Friday's close.
</P>
<P>
   That ascent has taken the two Georgia universities and the
inventors along on its wild ride. Each college received about
720,000 shares after the technology was licensed to CyberCare. Now
that original stake is worth $26 million to each.
</P>
<P>
   With home care uses, telemedicine's backers say these systems
can improve health care for chronically-ill patients while lowering
medical costs.
</P>
<P>
   CyberCare is a textbook case of how research projects can be
turned into commercial products, said Bill Todd of the Georgia
Research Alliance, a public-private coalition to help foster
high-tech development in the state.
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, the buzz around CyberCare increased as the company
announced a subsidiary of Shanghai Industrial Holdings has signed
an agreement for a joint venture to market and sell the electronic
house call system in Asia. The joint venture will buy about 60,000
of the units CyberCare said.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall, the company received orders from a Florida company to
put the system in the homes of 250 elderly patients. That state's
Medicaid program is discussing a pilot project.
</P>
<P>
   The CyberCare house call system starts with a PC, but without a
mouse or keyboard. Attached to it are medical devices such as
stethoscope, thermometer, blood pressure cuffs, and other
instruments to monitor diabetes, asthma and other conditions.
</P>
<P>
   The patients, by hitting icons on the screen, can take their own
measurements, which are sent to health care providers. There's
two-way interactive video, so the provider and patient can see and
talk to each other. A camera at the patient end can zoom close to a
wound, an eye or a medicine bottle, so the nurse or doctor can
inspect it.
</P>
<P>
   CyberCare said the equipment will retail for $5,000 to $7,500,
and lease for $150 per month.
</P>
<P>
   Company officials point out that 1 percent of Americans consume
about 35 percent of health care costs. With conditions ranging from
diabetes to congestive heart failure, they require hospitalizations
more often than others. Constant monitoring can prevent some
expensive hospital stays.
</P>
<P>
   Parent company CyberCare, based in Boynton Beach, Fla., has
revenues of $50 million from air ambulance, pharmacy and therapy
center businesses. But the stock run-up is driven by the electronic
house call's promise.
</P>
<P>
   CyberCare isn't alone in seeing a huge home care market.
Minnesota-based American TeleCare has been producing home care
systems, and Kodak just received FDA approval for its own device.
</P>
<P>
   ``CyberCare is a work in progress,'' said Bob Cerza, chief
operating officer of American TeleCare, a private company. ``To
their credit, they have created a tremendous amount of excitement
in investment markets. They have enhanced visibility for us.''
</P>
<P>
   The key for these companies is producing a system that can prove
cost-effective for insurers or home care companies, while making it
easy for patients to use, said Jon Linkous of the American
Telemedicine Association.
</P>
<P>
   While CyberCare has competition, it has the lone patent for
Internet transmission of the audio, video and medical data
combined, notes analyst Paul Bornstein of Connecticut Capital
Markets, which has a ``buy'' rating on the stock. ``No one has what
CyberCare has,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The invention arose from a telemedicine project at MCG. The
original technology hooked up physicians with patients at remote
sites for diagnoses of health conditions. But the early systems
were more expensive.
</P>
<P>
   For the home care project, Tech brought to the table its
engineering capabilities, and MCG its medical expertise. ``The
magic came by putting these two parts together,'' said Dr. Max
Stachura of MCG, one of the inventors.
</P>
<P>
   The Army made a $950,000 grant to the Tech-MCG project in 1995,
and it was matched by the Georgia Research Alliance.
</P>
<P>
   A pilot program in 1995-1996 installed systems in 25 homes in
Augusta, Ga. and in a nursing home.
</P>
<P>
   ``The original test did videoconferencing, blood pressure,
temperature, pulse, stethoscope, and weight, all on a touch
screen,'' said Stachura. Eventually the project needed business
expertise. ``We realized this was work that could be
commercialized,'' said Jean-Lou Chameau, dean of engineering at
Georgia Tech. In 1997, three companies bid for licensing the
technology. The winner was an investment group that eventually
became CyberCare.
</P>
<P>
   ``We recognized it would revolutionize the way health care is
provided,'' said David Richey, a company founder.
</P>
<P>
   They signed an agreement with the universities to license the
technology. The universities got a 10 percent stake each in
CyberCare, plus royalties based on future shares.
</P>
<P>
   The company was bought in 1999 by Medical Industries of America,
and the resulting company took the name CyberCare (now known
legally as Cyber-Care). The FDA is expected to approve the
technology in April.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's one of the most successful commercialization projects
ever at Tech,'' said Michael Burrow, who worked on the invention
there and is now the CyberCare engineering director.
</P>
<P>
   Now the sales engine must kick in. CyberCare is looking at
companies to manufacture the equipment. The first line of customers
is expected to be HMOs and other health insurers looking to lower
the cost of care and avoid expensive hospitalizations.
</P>
<P>
   Potential customers will include home care companies. A visiting
nurse in a car can do five or six home visits a day, Richey said.
``With this, a nurse can do 20 to 25 of those visits a day.''
</P>
<P>
   Other buyers could be assisted-living centers, schools, prisons
and individuals. Richey said the company has also talked to
Wal-Mart about putting telemedicine booths in its stores.
</P>
<P>
   The colleges, meanwhile, plan to reinvest their CyberCare money
in research programs. Tech has distributed about half its stake to
about 10 inventors, while MCG plans to give about five people 35
percent of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a remarkable sum of money that has been generated by
both universities,'' said Matthew Kluger, vice president for
research at MCG.
</P>
<P>
   Along with seeing the commercial application of the research,
Peifer said, ``We've enjoyed watching the stock go up.''

INSPECTION RECORDS

   WASHINGTON _ While claiming that food from two Gold Kist chicken
processing plants in Alabama is wholesome as well as safe to eat,
the U. S. Department of Agriculture is refusing to immediately
release public inspection records at the facilities.
</P>
<P>
   Several federal inspectors at plants in Boaz and Guntersville,
Ala., said diseased poultry has been used in part to make chicken
nuggets which the federal government then buys for school lunch
programs in 31 states. While eating the product will not make you
sick and although the chicken is cooked at high temperatures to
kill bacteria, inspectors argue the food is not wholesome. They
also claim that they are hamstrung by new federal food safety rules
that give Gold Kist the power to police itself.
</P>
<P>
   Top Agriculture Department officials say inspection records show
there are no problems at the plant. But when asked for these
records last week, the agency said the records would have to
reviewed under the federal Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) before
they could be released, a process that in the past has taken
months.
</P>
<P>
   Although skeptical of inspector's claims, Carol Tucker Foremen,
a former Assistant Secretary of Food and Consumer Services at the
Agriculture Department, said the agency's unwillingness to quickly
make its inspection records public is ``dumb.''
</P>
<P>
   ``If you were going to release it on a FOIA,'' she said, `` Give
it to them the minute they ask.''
</P>
<P>
   Following a Cox Newspapers report earlier this month of the
inspectors' allegations, school districts in at least four states
stopped serving the chicken nuggets from Gold Kist while they
pondered what to do. In Ohio, for example, food service directors
in 12 school districts around Dayton have refused to use Gold Kist
chicken nuggets even though USDA officials have repeatedly assured
state and local officials there is no problem.
</P>
<P>
   Local school officials say they are concerned by the graphic
account of three inspectors at the Guntersville facility of
carcasses with tumors, sores and pus slipping by in the course of
an experimental food inspection program begun by the federal
government last October at the plant.
</P>
<P>
   To allay these concerns, the Ohio Department of Agriculture last
week tested the Gold Kist chicken nuggets to make sure they were
safe to eat. But these tests raised even more questions when the
state announced Friday that it found Listeria, a potentially deadly
pathogen, in one lot of the product stored at a Dayton warehouse.
The state is now doing further testing to track down the source of
the contamination.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new federal food safety program, company employees at
the Alabama plant instead of federal inspectors examine and, if
necessary, condemn carcasses. However, at least twice during each
shift federal inspectors scrutinize ten carcasses after they have
been processed. Inspectors said they routinely found a large
percentage of diseased birds during these checks.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Billy, head of the Agriculture Department's Food Safety
Inspection Service (FSIS), dismissed his own inspector's complaints
in a press release last week. He said his agency sets high
standards and ``through inspection, verifies that plants are
meeting these standards.''
</P>
<P>
   Billy's assurances are contradicted by a day's worth of
inspection records obtained by Cox Newspapers. They show the
Guntersville plant failing four inspections on Jan. 15. However,
because the records are only from one day, there is no way of
knowing whether this represents a serious problem or simply a
momentary lapse.
</P>
<P>
   Beth Gaston, a department spokesperson, said that although
inspection records are public, anyone who wanted to see them would
have to file a formal request under the Freedom of Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   Others who have requested public documents say they have had to
wait months for documents.
</P>
<P>
   ``We filed (a Freedom of Information Act Request) on December 4,
1998,'' said Glen Dosono, a paralegal at the Seattle law firm of
Marler Clark. ``And we have had several follow up letters. They've
given us hardly anything.''
</P>
<P>
   The law firm represents 11 students from Finley, Wash., who
claimed they were sickened when they ate ground beef allegedly
contaminated with E. coli 0157:H7 at their elementary school. The
beef was donated to the school by the Department of Agriculture
under its commodities program. The firm is requesting a variety of
records including inspections at the Nebraska plant where the meat
was processed.
</P>
<P>
   Cheryl Hicks, who heads the FOIA program at the agency, says she
has seven employees who field the approximately 800 requests made
each year for information. She said that she does not have any
statistics on the average time it takes to fulfill a request.
</P>
<P>
   However, in its most recent report on FOIA the Agriculture
Department said that in 1998 the deparment took over four months to
respond to half of the simple requests and nine and a half months
for what it said were complex questions.
</P>
<P>
   Members of the non-profit, public interest groups in Washington
that monitor government agencies like the Department of Agriculture
say the agency is slow to provide information. Caroline
Smith-DeWaal at the Center for Science in the Public Interest said
she typically has to wait six months after a request is filed.
</P>
<P>
   Felicia Nestor, a lawyer at the Government Accountability
Project, said she once got a document in three weeks but that
normally it will take four months. ``If it's a real specific
request like records of filth in a plant, I expect to wait over six
months,'' Nestor said.
</P>
<P>
   Gaston said the records could only be released through a Freedom
of Information Act request because they ``may contain proprietary
information.'' Cox Newspapers gave its copy of the inspection
records to Gaston so she could point out what was considered
proprietary. Gaston declined, saying she was not an expert in
identifying proprietary information.
</P>
<P>
   The form, which is filled out by inspectors, asks for the time,
date, shift and production line on which the inspection was
performed. Possible problems that inspectors might find are divided
into five categories on the form. These range from a category No. 1
for carcasses with poultry diseases, to category No. 5 for
``dressing defects'' The inspector enters the number of birds
inspected in each category in one box and the number that were
deficient in a second box. There is no other information on the
form.

from the parliamentary elections, and they show more gains for
reformers. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-UNREST (Mitrovica, Yugoslavia) _ U.S. troops raced out of
the divided Kosovo city of Mitrovica under a hail of snowballs,
stones and bottles hurled by a hostile Serbian crowd. ``We either
had to withdraw or shoot somebody,'' a U.S. soldier said. By
Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   MILOSEVIC-CRACKDOWN (Prague, Czech Republic) _ The government of
Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic _ its support sliding in an
election year _ has sharply intensified attacks on Serbia's
democratic opposition and the media, calling them traitors and
using a draconian press law to intimidate and impoverish
independent publications. By Steven Erlanger.
</P>
<P>
   MEXICO-POLICE (Mexico City) _ After police break up a school
protest, residents of a small Mexico town round up the officers and
humiliate them by making them strip and stand naked or semi-naked
in the town square. By Julia Preston.
</P>
<P>
   BRAZIL-IMF (Rio de Janeiro, Brazil) _ A new Brazilian government
plan to spend more than $22 billion on social programs in the next
decade has led to a squabble with the International Monetary Fund,
which argues the money should be used to reduce Brazil's
indebtedness rather than to fight poverty. By Larry Rohter.
</P>
<P>
   ISRAEL-LAUNDERING (Jerusalem) _ Almost uniquely among developed
democracies, Israel has not made money laundering a crime, though
it is now taking steps in that direction.
</P>
<P>

has announced that it plans to turn the faint remnants of the Ho
Chi Minh Trail into a highway, linking the north and the south for
peaceful commerce as it once did for wartime supply and transport.
By Seth Mydans.
</P>
<P>
   JAPAN-FATIGUE (Saku, Japan) _ When the Japanese government
announced this week that one-third of the working age population
was suffering from chronic fatigue, few stress-haunted denizens of

that quiet little towns like these are being hit every bit as hard

   MCCAIN-BACKGROUND (Phoenix, Ariz.) _ When Sen. John McCain of

presidencies, Bill Clinton's two terms have been fair to middling,
a survey of U.S. historians has found. Clinton finished 21st

struck the resident of the big cedar log cabin at the corner of De

and immediately after his loss to Felix Trinidad last September,
the first loss of his professional career. But in the last six
weeks it has dissolved into the pools of sweat in the makeshift
boxing gym that he set up in the four-car garage that sits 50 feet
from the main house. By Timothy W. Smith.

CATEGORY) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Arizona's early Republican primary has thrust the
Grand Canyon State into the national limelight, but it almost
didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the primary's fate dangled by a single thread in the
Legislature. The deciding vote was held by Sen. Jim Buster, a Yuma
Republican who was playing brinksmanship to save an environmental
bill from a veto.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary had friends, and Buster soon found out how
powerful they were. Near the end of the session, he was summoned
from a meeting and told that Sen. John McCain was calling _ from
North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was THAT important,'' Buster recalled. ``But
apparently he thought it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years before McCain himself would seek the nation's highest
office, he and then-Gov. Fife Symington wanted an early primary.
Both men supported Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas and wanted to give him
an easy win.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the best-laid plans of senators and governors often
go astray, and the primary was no exception. Gramm's presidential
bid fell apart before he reached Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   McCain quickly switched his support to the eventual nominee,
Sen. Bob Dole, but millionaire publisher Steve Forbes won the
primary. In the end, most of Arizona's delegates went to Dole after
Forbes dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the primary still accomplished its goal, said former
state Sen. Stan Barnes, who sponsored the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be the New Hampshire of the West,'' Barnes said,
``the first Western state to come off and make a difference. And
you know what? We are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is a big factor in the selection of the next president
of the United States, and as an Arizonan, I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the Arizona primary, which is Tuesday, has
lost some luster, because South Carolina comes just three days
before, and Michigan is on the same day. On the positive side, the
state hosted two GOP debates this cycle, which never would have
happened without a primary.
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP field narrowing to three candidates _ McCain, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and conservative pundit Alan Keyes _ the
dynamics have changed. Bush can simply write off a McCain win to
Arizona being that it's McCain's home state and keep gearing up for
Super Tuesday (March 7).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mike Hellon, Republican national committeeman for
Arizona, said other states have tried to steal Arizona's thunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the whole impetus behind the aborted effort to have a
Western regional primary among the Rocky Mountain states,'' Hellon
said. ``They're all very jealous of the attention that Arizona is
getting and they want to jump in on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for the primary goes to Barnes, now a
lobbyist for energy and mining interests.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes shepherded the primary bill through the Legislature,
watching it die not once but twice. Democrats, forbidden by party
rules to participate in an early primary, attacked the bill with a
vengeance, and a few moderate Republicans joined them.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the primary was too expensive _ it ultimately
cost the state $2 million _ to be limited to one party.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of rhetoric, the primary bill would have gone
down a third time without some serious lobbying _ such as McCain's
phone call from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Under serious pressure, Buster decided to dicker with Symington,
who vetoed Buster's environmental bill anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an internal memo obtained by ``The Arizona Republic,''
a Symington aide poked fun at Buster, now a lobbyist for the state
Department of Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buster should get the tough-guy award for his suicidal
negotiating style,'' Symington aide Chuck Coughlin wrote. ``You
need to be aware in the future that his style is to take you to the
edge and then jump off, hoping to catch a branch on the way down.''
Buster's leap notwithstanding, Barnes said there was little doubt
that McCain and Symington made the difference, although others had
agitated for a primary for years. An Arizona primary law was passed
in 1992, but it was vague on the date and had other technical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain and Symington behind an early primary, Barnes said,
``you had the political will to finally get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not to say that it was done for Phil Gramm,'' he
added. ``That has never been true. However, the folks who wanted
Gramm to succeed also wanted an early Arizona primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is a wonderful environment for coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   McCain wasn't through tinkering with the primary. Last year, his
operatives lurked in the background as a bill popped up late in the
legislative session, seeking to move the primary back into March,
after Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   To McCain's opponents, the strategy was obvious: save McCain
from expending critical resources to defend his home state from a
George W. Bush incursion. A number of state Republicans rejected
the move, saying it would forfeit the spotlight that Arizona had
gained.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Marc Spitzer, R-north-central Phoenix, supported moving the
primary to the same day as city elections _ March 14 _ to
consolidate the process and save money. But it was not to be.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the primary replaced an old-fashioned caucus system, in
which delegates were elected by party activists. That process
marginalized Arizona, because the state convention was held in May,
long after the heart of primary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old way was more insular,'' Hellon said. ``You had to be
more of an insider to participate. I think on balance we're
probably better off the more we open up the system.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old system, more than 1,000 delegates went to the state
convention, where they voted for about three dozen delegates, who
would attend the national GOP convention. The delegates campaigned
based on which presidential candidate they supported.
</P>
<P>
   The internecine warring made for some tense standoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, House Minority Leader John Rhodes, an Arizonan who
supported Gerald Ford, was slated to be chairman of the national
convention. But he had no support from state Republicans, who were
lined up behind Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Rhodes almost received the ultimate snub for a
powerful congressman _ not being elected a delegate from his own
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going to (elect him),'' Hellon said. ``But the
national Reagan campaign said he's going to control the gavel at
the convention, so we can't have him (ticked) off. You have to
elect him a delegate.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the state party made headlines by electing as a
delegate former Gov. Evan Mecham, who had been impeached and
removed from office just a month before. The move came over the
objections of Sen. Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   Hellon said there were advantages to the old system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are making the decisions, they typically know
more about the candidates,'' Hellon said, ``and from a political
standpoint, they make more informed decisions and are not as easily
influenced by short-term passions or media.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, all of Arizona's delegates are committed to the candidate
who wins Tuesday's (CQ: FEB. 22) primary. The delegates are back in
play if the winning candidate drops out before the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the attention, there's a more pragmatic reason for
state Republicans to want a presidential primary. It makes money
for the party _ about $100,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the candidates come in and all the news people come in, so
now we have a good reason for them wanting to come in,'' said Dodie
Londen, former chairman of the state GOP. ``Every party needs money
in order to operate for the rest of the year.'' &QL;

<P>
   ``ACTUAL INNOCENCE'' &QL; 
By Barry Scheck, Peter Neufeld and Jim Dwyer (Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In our rush to convict violent criminals and offer justice to
their victims, it's easy to overlook the plight of the innocent
man. Today, DNA tests are used before trial. Of the first 18,000
test results at the FBI and other crime laboratories, at least
5,000 absolved suspects of guilt before their cases were tried. But
what about men who were convicted before DNA testing was common
practice? Lawyers Scheck and Neufeld are founders of the
``Innocence Project,'' which fights for DNA tests for men who are
in prison. The authors present case after case in which bad
lawyering, police misconduct or false testimony by witnesses
resulted in the conviction of innocent men on rape or murder
charges. Although the book is at times overly dramatic (Dwyer, who
writes for the ``New York Daily News,'' refers to ``Barry and
Peter'' as if they are superheroes, swooping in to save the day
with their test tubes), it is a sobering reminder of the forgotten
victims of violent crime. &QL;

   Far be it from us to make jokes at Yanni's expense, but we're
willing to laugh if someone else steps up to the plate. In this
case, it's ``New Yorker'' writer Kurt Andersen, who presents
himself as the man who invented Yanni _ the hair, the name
(``Zazu'' and ``Yahweh'' were contenders), the waterbed smile.
Andersen is one of 54 humorists who contribute to this anthology of
funny writing. Among the others: Roy Blount Jr., on the game of
golf (the first time he saw himself hitting a golf ball on video,
he looked exactly like a man killing a snake); Christopher Buckley
on the art of name-dropping; Garry Trudeau, who admits, copiously,
that he has smoked marijuana; Ian Frazier, who visits upon his
children the laws of the home (``Bite not, lest you be cast into
quiet time . . . '') and Dave Barry on his visit to Paris, where
there was only one empty parking space and it was under heavy
police guard at the Louvre museum. This volume is the first in a
series. Rosen invites you to submit work for future installments. &QL;

   ``WILD MINDS: WHAT ANIMALS REALLY THINK'' &QL; 
By Marc D. Hauser (Holt, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone want to guess what that fine gentleman on the cover was
thinking when someone snapped his picture? Hauser, psychology
professor and head of an animal-research program at Harvard
University, delves into questions that have already spawned many
books and much speculation: Are animals capable of experiencing th
same emotions that we feel? Do animals simply follow rules, or do
they understand those rules and their purpose? Hauser calls
accounts of weeping elephants and altruistic dolphins ``wildly
speculative,'' as faulty as the scientific belief that animals are
``mindless and irrational, driven by instinct and overwhelmed by
their passions.'' He explores such ``animal'' behavior as making
tools, counting, calculating distance, communicating and
cooperating with others, showing compassion, and making and abiding
by rules. In the process, he discusses what sets humans apart from
other animals _ their mysterious awareness of self. We will never
understand animals, he says, until we stop trying to see ourselves
in them. &QL;

   ``LOSING YOUR PARENTS, FINDING YOUR SELF'' &QL; 
By Victoria Secunda (Hyperion, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Secunda interviewed 94 men and women who during their adulthoods
experienced the deaths of one or both parents. In the process, she
discovered that ``parental death is a defining event for adult
offspring that, with regard to its impact on one's sense of self,
often eclipses the variables of marital status, career achievement,
being a parent oneself, or the cause and manner of parental
death.'' In other words, it matters, and in many different ways.
Some people feel a sense of euphoric relief when their parents die.
Others feel lost, with no one to talk to or impress. Some find that
their marriages or their relationships with their siblings are
enhanced after a parent dies. For others, those ties deteriorate.
Secunda's book is not perfect (it begins with a bit of baggage, an
overlong description of her terrible relationship with her mother),
but it is interesting in the shared experiences she discovered
among the subjects of her survey _ experiences not of grief, but of
the long-term consequences of an inevitable and life-altering
event. &QL;

FALLOUT FROM FOX'S MULTIMILLIONAIRE WEDDING 
ONLINE HIRING EVALUATOR (OR EGO DEFLATOR)
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Fox broadcasting network created an unexpected television
phenomenon last week by marrying off a man who said he was a
multimillionaire to one of 50 female contestants vying to be his
wife.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Fox executives basked in the publicity from the
ratings-rich ``Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?'', they were
faced with questions _ and not just about the propriety of having a
woman agree to marry a man she had seen for about a minute.
</P>
<P>
   They had to explain how the groom _ a comedian named Rick
Rockwell with a penchant for stunts (he once told jokes for 30
straight hours in an attempt to make the Guinness record book) _
could be taken seriously as a wealthy man in need of a wife.
</P>
<P>
   Rockwell's resume is deep in show-business moments _ including
stand-up appearances in Las Vegas and a stint on a television
sketch-show as a love-starved beach nerd.
</P>
<P>
   His background underscores a basic flaw in the format not only
of the Fox special but also of the coming crop of reality-based
shows in which real people are supposed to be taking genuine
life-changing actions on camera: How do you keep the
``I'll-do-anything-for-a-break'' fringe element of show business
from infecting the pool of ``real people'' eager to have the most
intimate moments of their lives exposed on national television?
</P>
<P>
   Fox executives are rebroadcasting the show Tuesday night and are
planning to turn the ``Multimillionaire'' format into a
sweeps-month franchise. They say they do not believe they have put
the future of the program at risk by trotting out an initial
contestant who once said, ``I'll do just about anything that's
legal to make people laugh.''
</P>
<P>
   They also continued to vouch for both Rockwell's financial
portfolio _ he is said to have made money by investing with his
father in real estate properties along San Diego's beaches _ and
the sincerity of his proposal and marriage to Darva Conger, an
emergency room nurse.
</P>
<P>
   But they did acknowledge that for the next edition, which is
likely to be broadcast in May, they will choose someone with
absolutely no connection to show business.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that connection is essentially what got Rockwell the gig.
The network, which is owned by the News Corp., had a back-up
multimillionaire ready to go, in case Rockwell had cold feet. And
the back-up had a lot more money, Fox executives said.
</P>
<P>
   But Mike Darnell, the Fox executive who conceived the special,
said the producers had feared that a man long on wealth but short
on performing skills might be totally undone by the pressure of
having to propose, then exchange vows in front of a stage audience
and on camera.
</P>
<P>
   There was also the question of appearances. The show already had
an unseemly, gold-digging quality _ 50 women deciding to marry a
man sight unseen, just for his assets _ and Darnell acknowledged
that many of the other multimillionaires who had been willing to
take part were not much to look at.
</P>
<P>
   ``The perception is true,'' he said. ``Millionaires are not all
good-looking men.''
</P>
<P>
   Fox never expected the question about Rockwell's show business
background to become such an issue because they never expected the
special to be such a hit. The show exceeded the best estimate of
Fox's audience research department by about 30 percent, and even
more impressively captured a full third of the women viewers
younger than 35.
</P>
<P>
   The network also had no certainty it would ever try the format
again; now it can hardly wait to do the next show.
Multimillionaires and their prospective brides are piling up, Fox
executives said, with many hundreds of the former and many
thousands of the latter already signed up as possible candidates.
</P>
<P>
   The question is, as the saying goes these days, can they keep it
real?
</P>

<P>
   Online Hiring Evaluator (or Ego Deflator)
</P>
<P>
   How many people have the self-confidence to subject themselves
to a public appraisal of their market value? Judging by the early
reaction to a new feature of a popular Web site, plenty.
</P>
<P>
   On Vault.com, a 3-year-old site that provides career
information, dozens of job seekers have leapt at the chance to find
out what others think they should earn. The appraisals come from
compensation consultants and a gang of anonymous kibitzers, all of
whom seem eager to place price tags on the services of strangers.
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, Vault.com plans to introduce ``Am I worthy?'' _ a
service that lets people submit their resumes and pictures and get
free feedback on their aspirations.
</P>
<P>
   A test version appeared on the site last week. Some applicants
were more revealing than others, and so were some of the
appraisers.
</P>
<P>
   A young, blond woman calling herself Aerin G. and claiming two
degrees from Stanford University said that she was considering a
switch from a hedge fund to marketing at nonprofit organizations.
Lauren Bell, an account manager at Grady Levkov &AMP; Co. in Manhattan,
estimated the annual salary she could expect at $50,000.
</P>
<P>
   Others thought that was a little high, but mostly they wondered
why anybody would abandon a hedge fund for anything other than an
Internet-based start-up company. ``What can a job at PBS do for you
that a job at a hedge fund won't?'' asked someone calling himself
``Aerin admirer.'' He went on to add, ``My career advice would be
to skip on the nonprofit gig and be a model, in which case I'd
raise the valuation to about $500,000.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, most of the applicants, whether they are doctors or
investment bankers, want to jump to Internet companies. But Mark
P., who said he has a medical degree and experience as a health
care consultant, may not have been pleased to learn that one
personnel director thinks he is worth only $70,000 a year.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Oldman, a co-founder of Vault.com, declined to comment on
the new service before its formal debut Tuesday.

Here are Anne Stephenson's capsule reviews of news books:
</P>
<P>
   ``ACTUAL INNOCENCE'' &QL; 
By Barry Scheck, Peter Neufeld and Jim Dwyer (Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In our rush to convict violent criminals and offer justice to
their victims, it's easy to overlook the plight of the innocent
man. Today, DNA tests are used before trial. Of the first 18,000
test results at the FBI and other crime laboratories, at least
5,000 absolved suspects of guilt before their cases were tried. But
what about men who were convicted before DNA testing was common
practice? Lawyers Scheck and Neufeld are founders of the
``Innocence Project,'' which fights for DNA tests for men who are
in prison. The authors present case after case in which bad
lawyering, police misconduct or false testimony by witnesses
resulted in the conviction of innocent men on rape or murder
charges. Although the book is at times overly dramatic (Dwyer, who
writes for the ``New York Daily News,'' refers to ``Barry and
Peter'' as if they are superheroes, swooping in to save the day
with their test tubes), it is a sobering reminder of the forgotten
victims of violent crime. &QL;

FINANCIAL TIMES WADES INTO GERMANY

<TEXT>
<P>
   FRANKFURT, Germany _ Germany is the world's fourth-biggest
economy and home to globe-spanning corporations like the automaker
DaimlerChrysler and the media conglomerate Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   But as a market for business journalism, Germany could until
recently be described with only one word: boring.
</P>
<P>
   Most Germans were too conservative to buy stocks and were not
much interested in corporate news. Business reporting was
excruciating dull, yet also prone to highly trumpeted ``scoops''
that turned out to be flat wrong.
</P>
<P>
   One measure of inertia is circulation. In a country with a
population of 80 million, Germany's biggest business newspaper,
Handelsblatt, sells only 170,000 papers a day.
</P>
<P>
   But all that is changing. Thanks in part to a boom in German
high-technology stocks and a revolution in attitudes toward
investing, Germany has become a battleground for new business
publications.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday the Pearson Group, producer of Britain's Financial
Times, will start a German version of its salmon-colored business
daily with the Hamburg magazine publisher Gruner &AMP; Jahr, which is
owned by Bertelsmann.
</P>
<P>
   It is a big bet. Far from simply translating the British paper
into German, Financial Times Deutschland has its own staff of 130
reporters and editors. Using a state-of-the-art publishing system
in Hamburg, the paper will be printed at four plants around
Germany. It will also have the latest closing time of any newspaper
in Germany, 10:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   The Financial Times is hardly alone. Confronted by a direct
assault on its turf, the publishers of Handelsblatt put their own
paper through a radical redesign last fall and added several new
sections.
</P>
<P>
   Handelsblatt's parent company, the Holzbrinck Group, also formed
a broad alliance with Dow Jones &AMP; Co. and The Wall Street Journal
Europe. And, just to cover all the bases, it started a new weekly
magazine in January called Teleboerse.
</P>
<P>
   Germany is suddenly awash in business publications. General
interest newspapers, like Die Welt and the Frankfurter Allgemeine,
have bolstered their business sections.
</P>
<P>
   Boerse Online, a weekly investing magazine owned by Gruner &AMP;
Jahr, has seen its circulation quadruple the last three years to
207,000. At least a half-dozen other new business publications have
been introduced.
</P>
<P>
   Behind this surge lies a sea change in German attitudes toward
business. As recently as three years ago, less than 7 percent of
all Germans owned stocks. The German stock exchange was a
slow-moving market limited to the shares of big corporations.
</P>
<P>
   Today, the Frankfurt stock exchange's New Market, where small
companies are listed, has become one of the hottest exchanges in
Europe. With nearly 200 companies listed, most of them new
technology companies, the New Market has attracted hordes of
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Add to that a surge in corporate takeovers, particularly
Vodafone AirTouch's hostile takeover of Mannesmann, and corporate
news has become mass-market news.
</P>
<P>
   But the battle between The Financial Times and Handelsblatt
promises to be the fiercest.
</P>
<P>
   When it came to daily business news in Germany, Handelsblatt
seemed to have an undisputed franchise among its target audience of
top-level corporate executives.
</P>
<P>
   Reliable but extremely dull, Handelsblatt provided exhaustive
daily news about companies and the stock markets. But it offered
little in the way of investigative reporting, probing features or
anything close to humor.
</P>
<P>
   Handelsblatt had already been evolving for several years. The
Financial Times, in English, has more than 20,000 readers in
Germany. The Wall Street Journal Europe, also in English, is not
far behind.
</P>
<P>
   Pearson began talks about a new paper nearly three years ago
with Gruner &AMP; Jahr, and executives say they became convinced that
they could transplant their model without cannibalizing its
existing readership.
</P>
<P>
   Olivier Fleurot, president of Financial Times Newspapers, argued
that the potential readership among corporate decision makers in
Germany is about 1.9 million. Its actual goals are far more modest:
It is guaranteeing advertisers an initial paid circulation of
50,000 and hopes to reach 120,000 within five years.
</P>
<P>
   Executives at Handelsblatt have hardly been idle. Thanks to a
makeover last fall, the paper now has color graphics, a much bolder
design and new sections on information technology and personal
finance.
</P>
<P>
   Heinz-Werner Nienstedt, chief executive of Handelsblatt,
disputed Pearson's argument that there is a larger market. ``The
market is well covered by Handelsblatt,'' he said. ``Readers and
the advertisers will have to judge whether there is a market and
whether this new paper is the one to fill it.''

BUSH GIVING HEALTH CARE MORE ATTENTION 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By CLAY ROBISON 
c. 2000 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Columbia, S.C. _ Sometimes it takes a tough political campaign
to ``define'' leadership.
</P>
<P>
   Advocates seeking more rights for patients in our increasingly
expensive and frustrating health-care system have not always
considered Texas Gov. George W. Bush a hero _ or a leader for their
cause.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, to be sure, has signed several laws designed to improve
the lot of consumers dealing with health-care providers and
insurance networks. But on other notable occasions, he has greeted
consumer-backed bills with about as much warmth as insurance
executives offer plaintiffs' lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, his first year in office, Bush vetoed a Patient
Protection Act that would have given consumers more rights in
dealing with their health maintenance organizations. He said it
would be too costly. And, in 1997, his heart didn't seem to be in
it when he let another major consumer priority _ a bill allowing
patients to sue their HMOs for malpractice _ become law without his
signature.
</P>
<P>
   But suddenly, in the midst of his tougher-than-expected
presidential race, Bush started claiming championship credentials
for consumer-friendly health care, which is important to a lot of
people, including voters in states far from home.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of the South Carolina Republican primary, when he
wasn't attacking opponent John McCain, Bush was running television
commercials touting his own accomplishments in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the litany was familiar _ setting high educational
standards, fighting lawsuit abuse, reforming welfare, toughening
juvenile justice laws and cutting taxes. But there also was a new
line.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Washington politicians deadlocked, I delivered a
patients' bill of rights,'' Bush said in one ad. Back home in
Texas, one consumer advocate was surprised _ and amused _ to learn
of Bush's new campaign claim.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would say that using the word, `delivered,' is stretching
the truth a little,'' said Lisa McGiffert, a senior policy analyst
for Consumers Union's Southwest regional office in Austin, Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's campaign office released a list of more than a dozen
patient protections that have been enacted in Texas while Bush has
been governor. They include measures that require HMOs under
certain circumstances to give women direct access to their
obstetrician-gynecologists; require managed care plans to cover
minimum hospital stays of 48 hours following childbirth; require
HMOs to pay for emergency services provided by nonnetwork
caregivers; and various other requirements designed to make managed
care plans more receptive to consumers' needs.
</P>
<P>
   The so-called HMO malpractice bill, which Bush let become law
without his signature in 1997, allows a patient to appeal to an
independent review panel and, in some cases, take an HMO to court
if the network denies payment of treatment recommended by a doctor.
It was the first state law of its kind in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Scott McClellan believes the list speaks for
itself. ``It's one of the major accomplishments under his (Bush's)
record as a reformer with results,'' he said, reciting a new Bush
campaign tag line.
</P>
<P>
   McGiffert acknowledged that Bush has allowed ``some really good
consumer protection laws to get into place,'' and she gave the
governor credit for ordering the state insurance commissioner to
develop consumer-protection rules, many of which later were made
law.
</P>
<P>
   But McGiffert said that Bush never has taken the lead on patient
rights to the extent, say, that he did on civil justice reform, an
area in which the governor staked out goals for limiting lawsuits
and lobbied lawmakers to ensure that those goals _ or at least
satisfactory compromises _ were met.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's civil justice priorities also often ran counter to
consumer advocates' health-care efforts. The governor almost vetoed
the HMO malpractice bill because he feared that it could drive up
health-care costs and increase the number of lawsuits. Before he
let the bill become law, McGiffert said, he insisted that lawmakers
include some anti-lawsuit language that ``creates more hurdles for
people to jump through.``
</P>
<P>
   But the question of leadership aside, patients' rights advocates
have been grateful for what they have accomplished under Bush's
watch in Texas. Now, maybe health care _ which already has been a
major topic of debate between the Democratic presidential
candidates _ will begin receiving more attention in the Republican
race for the White House as well.

 &HT;    FlatTV: the latest in home entertainment products
 &HT;    By James Cummings
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   BEAVERCREEK, Ohio _ Hundreds of ants were marching around behind
the bar of Kirby Gaboury's Beavercreek home.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't an infestation; it was a movie.
</P>
<P>
   Gaboury, owner of the Audio Etc. home entertainment business,
was showing the movie ``Ants'' to demonstrate the operation of his
new 50-inch, high-definition video monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Though the screen of the monitor is as wide as some projection
televisions, the unit is only about 4 inches thick and hangs on the
wall behind the bar.
</P>
<P>
   Gaboury's screen is an example of a plasma monitor, a device
that delivers a wide-screen television image without the bulky box
of a picture tube television or the separate projector of
projection systems.
</P>
<P>
   But though Gaboury's system delivers an incredible picture,
plasma monitors are probably a long way from becoming common
because of their price. Gaboury's monitor retails for about
$20,000, and the least expensive plasma monitors available run
about $7,000.
</P>
<P>
   Most people have seen commercials for Philips FlatTV, a type of
plasma monitor that is shown being hung on walls or ceilings in the
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   But Gaboury said potential customers usually are shocked when
they ask about the Philips sets and find the units in the
commercials sold for about $15,000 each.
</P>
<P>
   Philips has introduced a second-generation FlatTV that is due in
stores by March that will sell for about $10,000, but still that
will be outside the reach of all but the most affluent gadget
freaks.
</P>
<P>
   Most retail stores don't even carry plasma monitors but they are
available online or through high-end home entertainment dealers.
</P>
<P>
   If you're curious about plasma monitors, you may run across
demonstration models at home shows or electronics shows as well as
in a few stores.
</P>
<P>
   NO PICTURE TUBE
</P>
<P>
   The normal television set is often about as deep as the screen
is wide because a normal picture tube, called a cathode ray tube,
uses an electronic gun that has to be a certain distance from the
screen.
</P>
<P>
   The gun at the back of the picture tube shoots a pattern of rays
at the screen and the rays excite red, blue and green phosphors
that create the images displayed on the screen.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of a gun, plasma televisions use an electrified gas to
activate the phosphors through a process using ultraviolet light.
</P>
<P>
   Some consumers are confused by the terms ``flat TV'' and flat
screen television. FlatTV is what Philips calls its plasma
monitors. Flat screen televisions are traditional deep-box
televisions with flat rather than rounded screens.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to its flatness, the first thing you'll probably
notice about a plasma monitor is the width of the screen.
</P>
<P>
   While the traditional television screen is only slightly wider
than it is tall, plasma monitors are shaped more like a movie
screen. The normal screen ratio is about 5:4, meaning it has about
five inches of width for every four inches of height. Plasma
monitors are 16:9, meaning the screen is nearly twice as wide as it
is tall.
</P>
<P>
   The wide aspect screen makes plasma monitors an excellent way to
watch DVD movies.
</P>
<P>
   When motion pictures are formatted for television, they must be
cropped to fit the narrower television screen. Action that takes
place at the sides of the screen is often lost in the reformatting
process.
</P>
<P>
   Movies in letterbox format capture the full movie image by
displaying the movie at full width and showing black bars at the
tops and bottoms of the television screen. Though letterbox format
reproduces the movie the way the director intended, but most
television watchers don't like it. They feel they're being cheated
because they don't get to use their whole screen.
</P>
<P>
   Many DVD movies offer the option of being displayed in 16:9
format. They'll fill the full plasma monitor screen giving you a
home theater experience much closer to the original movie theater
experience.
</P>
<P>
   When high-definition television broadcasts become widely
available, they too will come in 16:9 format. Having a plasma
monitor is one way to be prepared when broadcaster switch to HDTV
format in the next few years.
</P>
<P>
   HIGH DEFINITION OR NOT?
</P>
<P>
   It's important to realize that not all plasma monitors are high
definition.
</P>
<P>
   Within the foreseeable future all broadcasts could be in high
definition, a format that gives brighter, sharper picture quality
than convention televisions. When that happens, older televisions
will be able to receive high-definition signals by adding a
converter box, but they won't be able to take full advantage of the
improved picture quality.
</P>
<P>
   Television pictures are made up of horizontal lines drawn across
the screen, and the more lines the entertainment system provides
the clearer the picture tends to be. High-definition signals
include more lines of resolution than normal television signals,
and high-definition televisions can display more lines of
resolution than normal televisions.
</P>
<P>
   Gaboury's set, a Pioneer PDP505HD, is high definition and is
able to display high-definition pictures to their best advantage.
</P>
<P>
   His set has a feature called ``progressive scan'' that, in
effect, blends the scan lines on the screen so they are less
visible.
</P>
<P>
   If you get close to the picture on a normal big screen
television, you'll be able to see tiny black horizontal strips
dividing individual lines of resolution. Vertical white objects on
a dark background may have a slightly jagged edge of distortion at
each line.
</P>
<P>
   Progressive scan lessens that effect, Gaboury said, giving a
more natural picture.
</P>
<P>
   ``Your DVD gives you a lot more lines of resolution than
broadcast television does,'' Gaboury said. ``A high-definition
television gives you much better performance with a DVD right now
than you get on a normal television. You don't have to wait for
high-definition broadcasts to take advantage of a high-definition
TV.''
</P>
<P>
   The Philips new model FlatTV, Model 42PF9952, is not high
definition, according to Lori LeRoy, a spokeswoman for Philips
Consumer Electronics. She said it will display high-definition
programming without a converter box, but it won't offer true
high-definition performance.
</P>
<P>
   Despite their costs, plasma monitors are not complete
televisions; they are monitors only. That means they are designed
to show pictures but they don't have a built-in tuner to select
stations to watch, and they don't have sound.
</P>
<P>
   Plasma monitors are designed to be integrated into a home
theater system that already has a sound system and video sources.
Video sources can include cable or satellite television services,
DVD players, VCRs or computers.
</P>
<P>
   The new Philips FlatTV can be purchased with an optional
``e-box,'' a tuner that takes the place of the tuner found in an
ordinary television. The e-box costs about $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Gaboury drives his plasma monitor primarily with a DVD player,
but it's also connected to a VCR. Because the VCR has an internal
tuner and it's connected to a cable television service, Gaboury can
watch cable programming on his monitor.
</P>
<P>
   Because plasma monitors are designed to work with a variety of
video sources, they usually have a variety of connector types.
Gaboury's set, for example, is set up for standard RCA inputs
commonly used in cable television in addition to advance input
types Super VHS, component and RGB.
</P>
<P>
   Gaboury said some early plasma monitors had problems, especially
with overheating that shortened the lives of the units. But he said
the second- and third-generation models being sold today are more
dependable.
</P>
<P>
   He said many of his customers say they intend to wait for prices
to drop before they invest in a plasma monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're really interested in quality, it's not necessary to
wait,'' he said. ``Prices drop when companies start putting out
lower quality products with more compromises in the internal
components and in the bodies of the units.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's available now are mostly high-end units. The
top-of-the-line products are going to be selling for the same
prices in a few years as the products available now.''

OUT MAGAZINE, IN TROUBLE, ACQUIRED BY THE ADVOCATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By REED ABELSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The publisher of Out magazine, the nation's most widely read
magazine aimed at the gay and lesbian community, has been acquired
by the publisher of The Advocate, its major rival, according to the
two companies.
</P>
<P>
   Out, which was badly in need of capital and suffering from a
recent decline in readership, had been for sale after a failed
management buyout, according to Robert Hardman, the chairman and
majority shareholder of Out Publishing Inc., which created the
publication in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is an open field for a big turnaround when the money is
put in,'' said Hardman, who said he would join the board of
Liberation Publications Inc., the Los Angeles company that owns the
Advocate, and would continue to be play a role with the
publication. Although the magazine was ``very close'' to making
money, Hardman said, it needed a significant investment to help
build circulation and develop an online presence.
</P>
<P>
   Liberation will also be buying HIV Plus, a much smaller
publication, and Out's Web site, www.out.com, which is not
currently operating. Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It makes for a dynamite combination,'' said James Franklin,
the president of Liberation, which also publishes books and
operates its own Web site, www.advocate.com.
</P>
<P>
   The two magazines, which are located on opposite coasts, have a
very different approach to the gay and lesbian market. Out, which
is based in New York, is a monthly lifestyle magazine with a
circulation of about 115,000 readers. The Advocate, which was
started in 1967, focuses on delivering news every other week to its
88,000 readers.
</P>
<P>
   While there is only a minor overlap in their readership, the two
magazines were considered rivals. ``Out was the magazine we used to
collide with on certain covers,'' said Judy Wieder, the editor in
chief of The Advocate and the corporate editorial director for
Liberation.
</P>
<P>
   But the last two years have been difficult for Out. Circulation
continues to drop from its peak of slightly more than 140,000
readers, partly the result of turmoil at the magazine. In late
1997, Sarah Pettit, its editor and a member of the original team
that founded the publication, was replaced by James Collard, the
editor of a British gay magazine, in a move that created some
controversy. The magazine then went through a radical redesign,
complete with strikingly different graphics and a repositioning of
its content, which alienated some readers. Last year, Collard, who
continues to write for the magazine, was replaced as editor by Tom
Beer.
</P>
<P>
   While Franklin said Liberation was committed to keeping Out
magazine in New York, the future direction of the publication
remained unclear. ``We really hope to help it find its voice
again,'' said Wieder, who said she planned to meet with the staff
this week to start talking about what, if any, changes should be
made.
</P>
<P>
   While applauding the sale, Henry Buford, the president and chief
executive of Prime Access Inc., a New York advertising firm that
specializes in the gay and lesbian market, said the new owner faced
a significant challenge in trying to make Out and The Advocate into
major forces, given the better coverage from general-interest
newspapers and magazines and the appeal of local gay publications.
</P>
<P>
   The sale ``certainly makes sense in that both magazines have
similar audiences and they have different formats to appeal to that
audience,'' said Buford.
</P>
<P>
   But he emphasized that Liberation must still reach greater
numbers of gay and lesbian readers. ``It's not a very developed
category,'' he said. ``The issue is what is the format that is
going to yield a broad reach in that market.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ As a jazz-crazed member of the Hot Club of Newark,
N.J., 17-year-old Lorraine Stein made her first pilgrimage to the
Village Vanguard in 1940, five years after it opened in a former
basement speakeasy on Seventh Avenue South in the West Village. She
and American jazz have not been the same since.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the Vanguard that she met her first husband, Alfred
Lion, the founder of Blue Note records. It was there, too, some
years later that she fell for the Vanguard's owner, Max Gordon, and
left Lion to become Lorraine Gordon.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way the funky, pie-wedge Vanguard, with its superb
acoustics, became a jazz shrine, a refuge for musicians holing up
against the onslaught of rock 'n' roll in the 1950s and '60s, a
soapbox for poets and an incubator for entertainers from Lenny
Bruce and Woody Allen to Judy Holliday, Betty Comden, Adolph Green,
Harry Belafonte, Wally Cox, the Weavers, Bobby Short and the comic
billed as Prof. Irwin Corey, the world's foremost expert.
</P>
<P>
   And so, with an indomitable presence encompassing 60 of the
Vanguard's 65 years, Gordon is to preside Monday night at a private
65th birthday party for the club that is expected to draw many of
the artists who have played it over the years, including Roy
Hargrove, Jim Hall, Tommy Flanagan, Marian McPartland, Joe Lovano,
Etta Jones, Houston Person, Joshua Redman, Geri Allen, Jimmy Heath,
Eric Reed, Cedar Walton and Helen Merrill.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've invited every musician in town,'' said Gordon, 77. While
a jam session is not officially on the agenda, she said, ``if they
don't play, this is not a jazz club.''
</P>
<P>
   It was in 1934 that Max Gordon, a Lithuanian immigrant who
stumbled into the nightclub business, opened the first Vanguard on
Charles Street. The police quickly plastered it with violations,
and the following year he reopened at 178 Seventh Avenue South,
where the club remains. Lorraine Gordon took over when her husband
died at age 86 in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   ``You figure it out as you go,'' said Mrs. Gordon, who wasted
little time asserting herself, replacing staff members and hiring
new lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Max was beautiful,'' she said. ``He taught me how not to do
things.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When I have to make a decision,'' she said, ``I ask, `What
would Max do?' Then I do the opposite.''
</P>
<P>
   With a throaty laugh she added, ``Ahh, I say those things; I
don't mean it exactly.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, friends say she is clearly her own woman, keeping a
sharper eye on business than Max did _ although when it came to
salaries, Corey cracked, ``Max gave musicians jobs, and they'd
still be unemployed.''
</P>
<P>
   Backed up by her younger daughter, Deborah, Mrs. Gordon is
everywhere at the Vanguard, taking reservations over a rotary
telephone in the ancient former kitchen that serves as the office,
monitoring deliveries and, once the music starts, shushing talkers.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's tough, always has been,'' said the jazz writer Nat
Hentoff, who credited Mrs. Gordon with ``the taste and business
acumen'' to keep the 123-seat club clear of faddish distractions
and commercialism and focused on mainstream modern jazz. Hentoff,
who wrote the introduction to Max Gordon's 1980 memoir, ``Live at
the Village Vanguard,'' said that despite the danger of being
shushed, ``When somebody calls me from out of town and asks me,
`What club should I go to?' I always say, `You can't go wrong at
the Vanguard.'''
</P>
<P>
   Tough? Mrs. Gordon begged to differ. ``That's not tough, to tell
people not to use a cell phone, not to talk while the music is
on,'' she said. ``You can cough. You can sneeze. But this is not a
conversation pit.''
</P>
<P>
   Perched at a back table the other afternoon and sipping a vodka
and soda in a wine glass, she monitored a tide of deliverymen and
technicians setting up for the night's 9:30 and 11:30 shows.
</P>
<P>
   ``Can I help you?'' she challenged one stranger.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the piano tuner,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``OK,'' she said, ``try.''
</P>
<P>
   New as she was to the nightclub business when she took over _
``He didn't really listen to me,'' she said of her husband _ she
was no neophyte when it came to jazz. As a teen-ager in Newark, she
and her brother, Philip, were charter members of the Hot Club,
whose young jazz devotees shared an obsession for collecting
recordings and frequenting jam sessions in mostly black dives like
the Alcazar, then featuring a stirring trumpet player named Jabbo
Smith. (To her delight, in 1979 she rediscovered him, alive and
playing in the show ``One Mo' Time'' at the Village Gate, and
helped revive his career.)
</P>
<P>
   Times were hard, she said. ``But we didn't know it was the
Depression. We thought it was normal.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Vanguard in 1940 she met Alfred Lion, a debonair
immigrant from Germany who had founded Blue Note records, a premier
jazz label. He showed her his record collection, and she was
smitten.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother loved him, too,'' Gordon said. ``She said, `He's too
good for you.'''
</P>
<P>
   When the war came and Lion was drafted, she followed him to
Texas, where they were married. He was discharged with an eye
ailment, and the couple resettled in Greenwich Village, socializing
with jazz giants like Louis Armstrong, Sidney Bechet and Miles
Davis.
</P>
<P>
   They also met a struggling Hells Kitchen pianist named
Thelonious Sphere Monk and, impressed, tried to sell his records.
Mrs. Gordon said she had some under her arm during a 1948 visit to
Fire Island where she spotted Max Gordon in a restaurant eating a
Danish. She appealed for a gig at the Vanguard for Monk.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked me over and said, `Well, I just happen to have a
week in September,''' she recalled.
</P>
<P>
   One thing led to another, she said, and by 1949 she was Mrs.
Gordon. The pair became a fixture on the jazz scene, turning up at
Newport, R.I., and dividing their time between the Vanguard and
other clubs that Max Gordon opened, the Blue Angel and Le
Directoire. While raising their two daughters, Mrs. Gordon became
active in campaigns against nuclear weapons and the Vietnam War,
joining demonstrations for Women's Strike for Peace around the
world.
</P>
<P>
   From her perch in the back of the club last week, Mrs. Gordon
suddenly noticed that a photograph on the wall was askew. ``Hey!''
she called to technicians setting up. ``You knocked the picture.
That's Jabbo, my little Jabbo.''

`A CONSPIRACY OF PAPER': MONEY AND MURDER ON THEIR MINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Publication notes are at end of review.) 
(lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Near the beginning of David Liss' strikingly authentic-sounding
first novel, ``A Conspiracy of Paper,'' which is set in London in
1719, there is mention of a character ``profiting in his
speculation, taking advantage of the fluctuations in the markets
caused by the rivalries between the Bank of England and the South
Sea Company.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately you assume the conspiracy of paper mentioned in the
novel's title must somehow refer to the famous South Sea Bubble or
Scheme, which involved a plan to buy up England's national debt in
return for a trading monopoly in the South Seas and in South
America, and which led to a speculative frenzy and England's first
stock-market crash, in 1720.
</P>
<P>
   Well, this turns out to be not literally the case. The events
surrounding the Bubble are not mentioned until the novel's final
page. But in a figurative sense the novel's subject is the South
Sea scheme. For in Liss' rich historical imagination, a London
ripening for investment hysteria comes vividly to life.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator of the story is Benjamin Weaver, born Lienzo, a
former boxer known as the Lion of Judah because he is Jewish, who
has given up the ring for work as ``protector, guardian, bailiff,
constable-for-hire and thief-taker,'' this last duty being most
lucrative, Weaver explains, ``for by bringing felons to justice I
received not only the reward of my hirer but also the considerable
forty-pound reward of the state as well.''
</P>
<P>
   His memoir begins with a visit to his lodgings by one William
Balfour, who is convinced not only that his own father, an apparent
suicide, was actually murdered but also that Weaver's father,
Samuel Lienzo, a stock-jobber from whom Weaver had long been
alienated, shared the same fate. Balfour wants Weaver to
investigate. Weaver, though put off by Balfour's anti-Semitism,
agrees for the sake of the fat fee.
</P>
<P>
   He is upset by the subject of murder, because of his own
responsibility for a man's death while he was handling another
unsavory assignment: the retrieval of a purse from a prostitute for
Sir Owen Nettleton, a baronet with a weakness for night life who
wants his purse back for a packet of compromising letters it
contains.
</P>
<P>
   At first the reader is puzzled over what the connection, if any,
may be between Sir Owen's letters and the possible murders. But as
Weaver reconciles with the survivors of his family and begins to
explore his father's and William Balfour's pasts, the mysteries
pile up so thickly that it's hard to keep any connections straight.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the plot draws you in from page to page, just as Weaver
is enticed by his beautiful in-law Miriam, the widow of his cousin
Aaron, who died when a trading vessel sank. And the author has the
leisure to explore every aspect of early 18th-century London life
from the precarious relations of Jews with English society to the
way the underworld was organized to the behavior of people high and
low.
</P>
<P>
   In a concluding historical note, Liss writes that in the
language of his novel he has tried to suggest the rhythms of
18th-century prose, which seems evident in amusing passages like
the following, in which Weaver comments on his life after the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a shame that I did not anticipate the pugilists of today
who, like the famous Jack Broughton, in their retirement open
fighting academies to train the young bucks that would take their
place. Broughton has indeed been ingenious enough to construct a
piece of apparel he calls mufflers _ a kind of voluptuous padding
for the fist. I have seen these things, and I suspect to be hit by
a man wearing these gloves is quite like not being hit at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Liss further writes in his afterword that his novel grew out of
his work as a doctoral candidate at Columbia University, ``where my
research focused on the ways in which 18th-century Britons imagined
themselves through their money.''
</P>
<P>
   He continues: ``After years in the archives, reading pamphlets,
poems, plays, periodical essays and long-forgotten novels, I failed
to find the source that told me precisely what I wanted to know
about the new finance. So I wrote one. My goal in this novel has
been to capture both the unbridled enthusiasm and the pervasive
anxiety of the period leading up to the South Sea Bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the anxiety overwhelms the enthusiasm as Benjamin Weaver
battles the mysterious forces that try to keep him from the truth.
But ``A Conspiracy of Paper'' is an evocation of English history
that you can happily get lost in for days.

A POSSIBLE CONFLICT OF INTEREST IN ART SALES 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Minn., Ill., Wash., Calif.)  (lb) 
 By JUDITH H. DOBRZYNSKI   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Taken aback by the disclosure that some museums, like
dealers, request a commission when art they are exhibiting is sold,
museums around the United States scrambled last week to plead
innocence, profess ignorance or say that they had stopped doing it.
Only one of some two dozen museums surveyed _ the Walker Art Center
in Minneapolis, which is widely known for exhibiting the work of
new artists _ admitted to the practice.
</P>
<P>
   The museum world has been in turmoil over financing since the
fall when the the Brooklyn Museum of Art got into a fight with
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani over ``Sensation,'' the exhibition of art
that is owned and was largely supported by the British collector
Charles Saatchi. The latest commotion was set off on Feb. 12.
</P>
<P>
   At a University of Chicago conference on the arts in the wake of
``Sensation,'' Gilbert S. Edelson, administrative vice president of
the Art Dealers Association of America, revealed that some museums
ask for sales fees. Requiring such a commission could create a
conflict of interest, perhaps tempting curators to show work
because it would sell rather than because of its artistic merits
alone.
</P>
<P>
   Edelson declined to cite names, but Thelma Golden, who had been
a curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art for 10 years until
1998, said that the Whitney had such a provision in its loan
agreement while she was there.
</P>
<P>
   Interviewed after the conference, several lawyers who review
museum loan agreements for collectors confirmed that other museums
also had the provision, usually asking for a 5 percent fee. They
also declined to name the institutions.
</P>
<P>
   But calls to several museums confirmed that the Whitney was not
alone. At one time or another, the New Museum of Contemporary Art
and the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, both in Manhattan; the
Brooklyn Museum of Art; the Seattle Art Museum; the San Francisco
Museum of Modern Art; and the Museum of Contemporary Art in San
Diego all asked for a commission from the buyer if a work on view
was sold. As recently as last year, the Museum of Modern Art
requested a ``handling charge'' for works sold, in the loan forms
it used.
</P>
<P>
   All those museums said that they had changed their loan
agreements. Maxwell L. Anderson, the director of the Whitney, said
that he eliminated that provision of the museum's loan agreement
last fall after learning of it in a review of the museum's
policies, which he began after joining the Whitney in September
1998. ``We caught what struck me as a peculiar provision of the
loan agreement, and we changed it,'' he said. ``I thought it was
very outdated.''
</P>
<P>
   The Whitney stopped collecting the fees years ago, Anderson
said. ``In the 1990s there were no commissions that we know of.''
</P>
<P>
   Most of the other museums with the provision also said that they
received little, if any, money from it. ``We have never collected a
commission,'' said Lisa Dennison, deputy director and chief curator
of the Guggenheim. ``In an old version of our loan form we asked
for a commission of 10 percent, but we dropped the provision about
10 years ago. It's a very difficult thing to enforce.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, many collectors, or their lawyers, balked at the
practice. ``I've always crossed it out,'' said one arts lawyer who
declined to be identified, ``and no one has ever objected.''
</P>
<P>
   So sometime during the last few decades, these museums
discontinued the practice or forgot about it. As soon as he read
about Edelson's remarks, said John R. Lane, who has been director
of the Dallas Museum of Art for about a year, he reviewed the
institution's loan agreement for the first time. ``And I'm happy to
say we don't have any clauses on that subject,'' he said. Other
museums said they did not know what their policy was.
</P>
<P>
   Among the museums that said they had never asked for a
commission are the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the Art Institute of
Chicago, the Hirshhorn Museum in Washington and the Museum of
Contemporary Art in Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   The museums that once asked for commissions seemed to have
reached that position from two perspectives. The Whitney started
asking for a commission during the 1930s, when there was virtually
no contemporary art market, Anderson said. The money generated was
put into the museum's acquisition fund. Lane of the Dallas Museum
said that the provision was a fairly common part of the loan form
until at least the 1970s because many museums grew out of artists
associations.
</P>
<P>
   ``But by the 1980s,'' Lane said, ``interest in contemporary art
had grown, so that there were other ways of finding support for
contemporary art exhibits and, at the same time, the gallery system
had also grown strong by then.''
</P>
<P>
   At about that time another group of museums began requesting
commissions for that very reason. ``We'd put on an exhibition and a
big collector would come in and discover an artist,'' said Hugh
Davies, director of the San Diego Museum of Contemporary Art. ``The
artist's gallery would make a lot of money and the museum had done
all the work. There was a sense that museums were being cut out of
the validating process.''
</P>
<P>
   ``And at that time,'' Davies added, ``a lot of people thought
that museums should be more entrepreneurial.'' So several museums
started asking for commissions in the late 1980s. Davies said that
museums like his had changed their loan forms simply because the
system did not produce anything. ``I'd like to tell you we took it
out because we realized it was a conflict of interest and might
jeopardize our tax-exempt status, but it was really because nothing
was happening with it,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Like those museums, the Walker was being entrepreneurial _ out
of necessity, it said. David Galligan, the museum's administrative
director, said the Walker initiated a commission system in 1995,
when federal money for the arts had been cut and other sources of
money also dried up. Whenever an artwork was sold during an
exhibition or while on any subsequent tours, the museum was to be
paid 5 percent of the sale price.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see the appearance of a conflict exists,'' Galligan added,
``but no curatorial decision here has ever been influenced by the
potential for gain. It is now part of a review of our practices
we're undertaking in light of `Sensation.' It's my judgment that
the likelihood of its continuance is very small.''
</P>
<P>
   Galligan said the policy was enforced for only one show,
``Brilliant! New Art from London,'' which coincidentally included
some of the same artists as ``Sensation.'' The Walker collected
less than $4,000 from ``Brilliant,'' Galligan said. ``We never felt
comfortable with it, but it's still on the loan forms,'' he added.
</P>
<P>
   Davies, a former president of the Association of Art Museum
Directors, said the provision was more widespread than people
realized. ``I guarantee that after they read your article, a lot of
places will discover that they have it,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Neither that association nor the Association of American Museums
mentions commissions in their ethics codes, but both are reviewing
their policies and their officials said that the new codes would
probably address the subject. ``All museums are properly looking at
their conduct to see if it matches a standard, and the standards
are changing,'' said Anderson of the Whitney. ``We're more
accountable, and that's a good thing.''

E-COMMERCE: INTERNET RESHAPES THE CONSTRUCTION INDUSTRY

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Andy Ball, president of Webcor Builders, a Silicon Valley
construction company, can smell inefficiency in a project _ even
before he walks around the job site to discuss things with the
foremen and supervisors.
</P>
<P>
   The tell-tale odor is the ammonia-like one that can fill a
construction trailer with each new shipment of revised blueprints.
</P>
<P>
   To Ball, whose $500 million-a-year company is based in San
Mateo, Calif., the very presence of blueprints indicates that some
members of the construction team have not yet embraced the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
   He knows that those who have already entered the era of
e-construction can view architectural drawings online and print
relevant sections straight from their computers _ without wasting
time waiting for the drawings to be commercially printed, packaged
and delivered to the scores of participants in a given project each
time the plans get tweaked.
</P>
<P>
   ``It stinks,'' Ball said of the bad old blueprint era. ``It all
stinks. That's the whole point.''
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for Ball and others on the vanguard, the air is
not clearing quickly enough. Many construction executives complain
that their industry has been among the last to embrace the
Internet, even though the medium offers a ready solution to their
thorniest problem _ how to coordinate the efforts of what sometimes
amount to hundreds of separate teams across the lifespan of a
project as the original plan evolves, doorway by redesigned
doorway, conduit by rerouted conduit.
</P>
<P>
   True, the Internet has begun to reshape the highest reaches of
the nation's $1.2 trillion construction industry. The nation's
biggest contractors, like Turner Corp. and Bechtel Group, have
started to use e-commerce sites like Bidcom and Cephren, which help
them communicate with partners and subcontractors and even buy
materials and bid for jobs.
</P>
<P>
   Webcor, though perhaps one-fifth Turner's and Bechtel's size,
has joined them in incorporating the Web into its basic operations.
(The Web in Webcor's name predates the spread of the World Wide Web
by more than two decades; the company was founded in 1971.)
</P>
<P>
   Webcor is using the Cephren system extensively in building a $50
million, 12-story office tower in Santa Clara, Calif. The
building's owner, Tishman Speyer Properties, is based in New York,
but has employees in locations around the country who are involved
with the project. The architect, Hellmuth, Obata and Kassabaum
Inc., is in San Francisco, as is the engineer, Middlebrook and
Louie Structural Engineers.
</P>
<P>
   Ball said the Cephren system was proving invaluable, enabling
the various parties to communicate ``without all the faxes, without
all the calls.'' He estimated the cost savings at $50,000, but said
it could have exceeded $200,000 if all the subcontractors and
suppliers were online. ``Right now, it's a good tool for us,'' he
said. ``Next year, it'll be more necessary for people to have on
our projects. In two years, it'll be absolutely mandatory.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, though, e-commerce has barely penetrated the industry's
second and third tiers, among companies with less than $100 million
in annual revenue, where most communication still occurs the
old-fashioned way _ with faxes, voice mail and overnight packages.
The result, executives and industry analysts said, is the loss of
billions of dollars in potential savings.
</P>
<P>
   ``Construction has always been a very fragmented industry
because it's so local,'' said Kent Allen, an e-commerce analyst for
Aberdeen Group, a consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   So far only a fraction _ some $6.3 billion _ of the construction
industry's overall business is conducted online, according to
Forrester Research, which studies e-commerce. Even by 2004,
Forrester expects the online total to reach only $141 billion, or
less than 11 percent of total construction spending.
</P>
<P>
   Some construction executives cite a stubborn resistance in their
industry to any new approaches to business. Others suggest that the
Web's continued reliance on the personal computer makes the medium
impractical on many job sites (although at Webcor, hand-held Palm
computers supplement desktop and laptop machines). And some of the
holdouts say that the benefits of e-commerce sites have not yet
been made sufficiently clear to them.
</P>
<P>
   Still, enthusiasts say they have noticed a shift in the
attitudes of the biggest construction firms in recent months, and
they hope a trickle-down effect could compel more subcontractors to
catch the Web wave _ or face the prospect of losing work.
</P>
<P>
   Ball says Webcor now uses Cephren in connection with every new
construction project. As with other Cephren clients, Webcor pays a
start-up fee of $750 and a monthly fee of $1,250 to connect the
entire construction team, then receives passwords enabling all
parties to enter the portion of the Cephren site devoted to their
particular project. Cephren charges an initial $1,500 training fee
and offers support to clients during the life of a project, but
clients are primarily responsible for the site's content and
operation.
</P>
<P>
   The passwords allow for differing levels of access to
information and services. A midlevel manager on a building site,
for instance, might be able to post a request for information on
one area of the site, but might not be able to view the minutes of
the senior project-management team's meetings.
</P>
<P>
   Such centralized communication is the essence of Cephren's
offering _ as it is with the company's chief competitor, Bidcom,
and smaller newcomers like Buzzsaw.com. Analysts generally regard
Bidcom, founded in 1997 and based in San Francisco, as the
construction-oriented Web site with the biggest following, with
Cephren close behind.
</P>
<P>
   These companies and others on their trail are also developing
marketplaces for their sites, which would include huge catalogs of
construction goods, as well auction services that would allow
suppliers to bid on various portions of a project. But for these
Web sites, the core component ``is the linking together of the
communications of dozens of companies, as they collaborate on
everything from design and engineering to management,'' said Jas
Dhillon, chairman of Cephren, which was formed in January by the
merger of eBricks and Blueline Online. The company uses Blueline's
former headquarters in Palo Alto, Calif., where Blueline was
founded in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Web collaboration means that the most up-to-date blueprints can
be posted on the site, with e-mail notifications going out to
anyone who needs to know. Work schedules can also be e-mailed or
posted on a particular page on the site, so that different teams
can track how the job is proceeding.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, most of the construction Web sites also create a
virtual paper trail of the project _ including who has viewed what
information and when. If legal disputes arise, there is a
compendium of evidence about which parties were informed of and
accountable for what parts of the job.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the same information is vital to the building's
maintenance team after the job is completed. Rather than having
stacks of equipment manuals and building specifications stored in a
warehouse, the data can be compiled on disks or cartridges and kept
in a single desk drawer.
</P>
<P>
   It is during the construction itself, though, that the Web
offers the greatest advantages, Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can all work off of the same page. Before, I'd have to go
out to the job site, meet with people and ask them how things are
going,'' he said. ``Now, I know the answers to the questions before
I ask them.''
</P>
<P>
   That is, if everybody were using the system _ and not everyone
is. The steel subcontractor on one current Webcor project, for
instance, declined to sign up for the Cephren service. The supplier
was selected by the building's owner, anyway, because it had
submitted the low bid.
</P>
<P>
   But being offline meant that Webcor and the project engineers
``had to send paper back and forth'' to the subcontractor before
completing the specifications and placing the order for the 3,000
tons of structural steel required, Ball said.
</P>
<P>
   Using the Web site, he said, the structural engineers, the steel
subcontractor and the contractor could have worked on the plans in
tandem on the Web site. ``You get it done in one day, instead of
dropping a week'' each time the parties have to send the plans out,
review them and make changes offline, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ball said the losses from such inefficiencies depend on the
project. With an office building, ``if it takes another week to get
the project done because of that, there's another week that the
owner can't fill the building,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on the rents being paid, it can be anywhere from
$100,000 to $200,000,'' Ball said. ``But there's not much I can do
right now. A lot of these subcontractors are still in the Dark
Ages.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   That is not stopping entrepreneurs and their investors, though,
from setting up sites on the assumption that such laggards will
eventually see the light.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are hundreds of start-ups now with $5 million worth of
backing,'' said Carl Bass, chief executive of Buzzsaw.com. The
company was spun off from Autodesk, the maker of
computer-aided-design software, and last fall raised $15 million in
an initial round of financing. ``If you can quote the size of the
industry and spell AEC'' _ the industry acronym for architecture,
engineering and construction _ ``you can raise $5 million,'' Bass
said.
</P>
<P>
   He predicted that Buzzsaw would would be competitive because
Autodesk's AutoCAD software _ widely used by architects _ made it
easy to integrate the design and architectural drawings into the
Buzzsaw site easily. ``Design is at the headwaters of this whole
process,'' Bass said.
</P>
<P>
   Some other sites are focusing on more narrow slices of the
construction industry, hoping to entice smaller subcontractors to
log on. One, NetClerk, in South San Francisco, means to give users
a way to navigate the municipal permit process. On the site, users
can find, complete and submit permits that municipalities require
before installing a water heater, for instance. So far, NetClerk is
operating primarily in the Bay Area, but has ambitions for a
national expansion.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're going to see more and more companies like ours pop up,
to make the entire process easier,'' said Jon Fisher, NetClerk's
chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Matthew Sanders, an analyst with Forrester Research, agreed.
``Down the line a bit, these sites will evolve to the point where
they'll include players that are far upstream, like providers of
sawmill equipment,'' he said. ``Procurement will be in place, and
everyone will be plugged in along a virtual supply chain. It'll be
incredible to see how that drives efficiency.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, executives like Webcor's Ball plan to enlist the
support of building owners to persuade every subcontractor on a job
to get wired.
</P>
<P>
   As for that recalcitrant steel subcontractor that got the job
solely on the basis of a low bid?
</P>
<P>
   ``Next time I'll do a better job of convincing the owner to go
with somebody else who wasn't as low, but who'll save us money in
the long run by using this system,'' Ball said. ``It's the new math
of the Internet.''

   HOLLYWOOD _ This town's talent agents, facing rising competition
from talent managers, are no longer satisfied with merely being
powerful and rich. They want an even bigger share of the
entertainment industry's financial pie.
</P>
<P>
   Within the last week, the talent agency business took the first
significant step in decades to expand its power as well as its
financial muscle. Under a tentative agreement with the Screen
Actors Guild, talent agencies will soon be able to participate in
the financing and distribution of films and television shows as
well as have a noncontrolling interest in a production companies.
</P>
<P>
   Historically, because of the potential for conflict of interest
in the negotiating process, talents agents were legally barred from
investing in such companies or sharing the financing of films and
television shows.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond this, the agreement enables talent agencies to open the
door for the first time to investors, who could range from
advertising agencies to Internet companies. This would give talent
agents not only capital to grow, but a vehicle to make them
wealthier.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three driving issues here,'' said Jeff Berg,
chairman of International Creative Management, one of the town's
top talent agencies. ``The first is, agents have been living under
60-year-old regulatory guidelines which are not responsive to the
agency business in the 21st century. The second is, we need to
attract capital and investments to our businesses and we need to be
invested in other kinds of companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``And the third is, we need to be competitive as a source of
executive talent,'' he said. ``We're concerned about the migration
of agents to the management ranks. We need to retain our best and
brightest.''
</P>
<P>
   In some ways, the agreement, between the Screen Actors Guild and
The Association of Talent Agents, which represents 100 talent
agencies in the Los Angeles, rests on an acknowledgment on the part
of agents that their power has diminished over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   Talent agents in the 1980s and early 1990s ruled the town. They
earned huge fees packaging films and television shows, controlled
the careers of stars, demanded lavish sums for even mid-level
actors and even became _like Michael Ovitz _ more powerful than the
television and studio moguls who dominated Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Not any longer.
</P>
<P>
   Although agents still have extraordinary leverage, the
ascendancy of talent managers who can also produce films and
television shows has unhinged top talent agencies like Creative
Artists Agency, International Creative Management and William
Morris. Some stars like Leonardo DiCaprio, Kevin Costner and Robin
Williams no longer have agents, but rely on managers or lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   What has disturbed agents is that they are regulated, while
talent managers face few such legal barriers. Agents are licensed
by the state and earn their money finding work for clients and
negotiating contracts for them. Managers, on the other hand, are
unregulated.
</P>
<P>
   Managers charge anywhere from 10 percent to 15 percent of
clients' pay, but are also able to create and produce projects and
collect potentially substantial film and television fees. In
contrast to agents, managers, by law, are only supposed to advise
and secure employment for their clients but not negotiate
contracts. But this rule has never been enforced and managers often
work out the details of a client's deal. The line has become
increasingly blurred between managers and agents, even though
actors now often pay commissions to agents as well as managers.
</P>
<P>
   What made talent agents especially nervous was Ovitz's decision
less than two years ago to enter the ranks of talent management
after his dismissal as president of the Walt Disney Co. by Michael
Eisner, the chairman. Previously, the relationship between agents
and managers was generally friendly _ they often worked together
for clients.
</P>
<P>
   But Ovitz began luring some of his former clients at Creative
Artists to his management company, which outraged the agents. Last
year, Creative Artists told its clients that Ovitz was a direct
competitor, and that the agency would no longer represent anyone
who also used Artists Management. The result was that some Creative
Artists clients, like the directors Sydney Pollack and Martin
Scorsese, as well as Williams, joined Ovitz, and left the agency.
</P>
<P>
   Currently Ovitz's company, Artists Management Group, represents
a number of stars like DiCaprio, Cameron Diaz and Williams. Ovitz's
management company had not succeeded, though, in luring substantial
numbers of movie stars and directors.
</P>
<P>
   But the arrival of Ovitz on the management scene _ as well as
the success of top management companies like Basic Entertainment
(formerly Brillstein-Grey), which produces HBO's ``The Sopranos'' _
left agents worried that they were locked in by legalities that
diminished their leverage and hurt them financially. The result was
that an increasing number of agents joined the management ranks.
</P>
<P>
   Top agents, though, are hardly suffering or trading in their
Armani or Prada outfits. A senior agent who is not a partner at
Creative Artists can earn annual base pay of $500,000 plus a $1
million bonus, depending on his or her track record. (At
International Creative Management and, to some extent, William
Morris, agents can also buy stock in their companies. But equity in
Creative Artists is only given to its half-dozen partners).
</P>
<P>
   The agreement with the Screen Actor's Guild, which has to be
ratified by the union's executive committee, allows talent agencies
for the first time to retain a minority investment in television
and film production companies. It not only increases the leverage
of agents but allows them to reap profits from a successful
television or film production.
</P>
<P>
   Karen Stuart, executive director of the Association of Talent
Agents, said the agreement had been worked out over the last year.
``Our proposal was never designed to combat managers,'' she said.
``This is designed to deal with the realities of the entertainment
world today. The new media is exploding. It's a world of vertical
integration. We have got to be in a position to make new business
arrangements for ourselves and our clients.''
</P>
<P>
   Stuart added: ``Agents have been at a competitive disadvantage.
At long last, it's time for a change.'' &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   The closing arguments in the Microsoft antitrust case in
Washington on Tuesday promise to provide moments of courtroom
theater, but it is the settlement talks taking place behind closed
doors in Chicago that are the greater drama.
</P>
<P>
   The private deliberations, mediated by Richard A. Posner, a
leading antitrust scholar and chief judge of the 7th U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals, are at the settle-or-fold stage.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are high for both sides in what one person close to
the talks called ``the ultimate antitrust poker game.'' Walking
away from the settlement talks, under way since November, could
well mean waiting a couple of years for a final outcome in the
courts, including appeals.
</P>
<P>
   For the government, that means the risk inherent in a change of
administration, perhaps a Republican one with different views on
antitrust matters. For Microsoft, the risk is a likely legal ruling
that it violated the law, a wave of follow-on private antitrust
suits, and the business uncertainty of whether it will eventually
have to cope with severe sanctions or more modest ones.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the odds are against a settlement, people close to the
talks say. The trial judge, Thomas Penfield Jackson, indicated
earlier to both sides that he might delay closing arguments if the
government and Microsoft appeared near a settlement. But the court
issued a statement at the end of last week, detailing the itinerary
for Tuesday's proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   The government and Microsoft remained far apart as of last week,
despite a painstaking process employed by Posner to try to find
common ground. Typically, he has met one day a week in Chicago with
each side, not bringing the two camps together. Over the last few
months, the representatives have included William Neukom,
Microsoft's in-house counsel, and David Boies, the Justice
Department's chief trial lawyer in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Posner, according to people close to the talks, has issued sets
of written questions, sometimes a dozen or more to each side: How
does this contract work? How does this technology work? Often, he
will then ask one side about a conflicting answer from the other.
</P>
<P>
   The process is intellectually rigorous, these people say, and
there is homework. ``His approach is iterative, step by step,'' a
person close to the talks said. ``He's not retrying the case, but
he's really gotten down to immerse himself in the contracts and the
technology. He's not interested in just hearing lawyers talk.''
</P>
<P>
   To try to encourage a settlement, Posner assured both sides at
the outset of the talks that if they reached an agreement, he would
publicly support it, including testifying before Congress, if
asked. Under the Tunney Act, a court must give at least 60 days'
notice for public comment before a proposed settlement can be
approved. That review period is intended for a court to hear
witnesses and accept friend-of-the-court briefs. But it would also
provide time for wider public scrutiny in other forums, including
Congress.
</P>
<P>
   The differences between the two sides _ sizable throughout the
trial that began in the fall of 1998 _ grew even wider in November,
when Jackson issued his findings of fact. Though not a final
ruling, his findings emphatically supported the version of the case
presented by the Justice Department and 19 states suing Microsoft.
He found the big software maker to be a monopolist whose business
practices stifled competition and harmed consumers.
</P>
<P>
   The judge's findings gave the government a very strong hand at
the settlement talks. Microsoft's settlement proposals, a person
close to the talks said, must ``effectively address every issue
raised by the government.'' Yet one of those issues, and an
accusation in the suit, is that Microsoft tied its Internet
Explorer Web browser to its industry-standard Windows operating
system to unfairly squelch competition.
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft denies the charge, saying that its browsing software
is an integrated feature of Windows, not a separate product.
Microsoft also cites a June 1998 ruling in a related case that
supports its stance.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond that, Microsoft has maintained throughout its
long-running dispute with the Justice Department that its bedrock
principle has been to defend the ``freedom to innovate'' _ that the
company should be free to design Windows as it sees fit, unfettered
by government oversight.
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department maintains that a monopolist like
Microsoft can indeed engage in anticompetitive product designs, and
that the practice should be curbed.
</P>
<P>
   What is more, the issue of tying products together is one of
several obstacles to a settlement. ``The government has such a
strong hand at this stage, I can't imagine there is any settlement
the government would find acceptable that Microsoft would agree
to,'' said a Silicon Valley software executive who has talked to
the Justice Department about legal remedies.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's findings, according to government officials, suggest
one of two types of remedies: a powerful set of prohibitions on
Microsoft's conduct in the future or breaking up the company in
some way to foster competition.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with ``conduct'' remedies _ like forcing Microsoft
to ensure rivals access to its Windows technology and prohibiting
exclusive contracts _ is that they require the government or courts
to constantly police Microsoft's actions. Both the courts and the
Justice Department are reluctant to take on such a role.
</P>
<P>
   ``A long list of serious conduct remedies really does start to
look like regulation, continually looking over Microsoft's
shoulder,'' a person close to the talks said. ``You can argue that
a breakup is extreme and a bit scary, but its virtue is that it is
simpler and less regulatory.''
</P>
<P>
   Microsoft has refused to even consider the breakup option at the
settlement talks. Steven Ballmer, its president and chief
executive, has said it would be ``absolutely reckless and
irresponsible for anyone to try to break up this company.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, recent strategy within Microsoft has, if anything,
drifted in the opposite direction _ to more tightly bind its
various groups together. It is, for example, trying to take its
Windows business model from desktop computing and extend it to the
Internet with what it is calling ``next-generation Windows
services,'' a software platform for the Internet that other
programs run on.
</P>
<P>
   And after shifting strategies for years, Microsoft's consumer
group, which includes the MSN Web site and MSN Internet access
service, is adopting a course that links it closer to the software
plans of the rest of the company. Asked recently if there was any
consideration of making the consumer Internet unit a stand-alone
company, Richard Belluzzo, who heads the consumer group, replied:
``Our strategy is built around software integration with the rest
of Microsoft. It wouldn't make any sense if we were a separate
company.''
</P>
<P>
   In striking Internet deals with other companies, Microsoft has
sold itself as a concern that can supply the widest array of
necessary software and services, from Windows to WebTV to software
for smart phones. Last November, Tandy Corp., with its 7,000 Radio
Shack stores, struck a distribution deal with Microsoft. It chose
Microsoft over a competing bid from America Online, explained
Leonard H. Roberts, the Tandy chairman, because he believed that
Microsoft could provide ``the technology glue, the operating
system'' for all the Internet devices he plans to sell in his
stores.
</P>
<P>
   What if, as some have proposed, Microsoft is broken into three
to five companies as the result of the antitrust case? ``One way or
another, that case will resolve itself,'' Roberts said. ``Whatever
form Microsoft is in _ and I hope it's in the same form _ they have
committed that they will be able to deliver this technology.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I've signed a contract that is 120 pages long that was also
signed by Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer,'' he added, ``and it
includes ultimate issues of change of control.''
</P>
<P>
   Such language is reasonably standard in business contracts,
Microsoft insists, adding that it has not altered its contracts
with an eye toward the possibility of a breakup.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, Microsoft's message to business partners is: There
is no need to worry.
</P>
<P>
   Some antitrust experts agree. Robert Litan, a former senior
official in the Justice Department and now an economist at the
Brookings Institution, personally advocates breaking up Microsoft
into four companies _ three competing operating-system companies
and a fourth that takes Microsoft's other software businesses.
``But if Microsoft fights this long and hard enough in the
courts,'' Litan said, ``I think it can avoid a breakup.''

<P>
   PRESCOTT, Ariz. _ The national media's infatuation with Arizona
Sen. John McCain is only weeks old, sparked by his upset victory in
the New Hampshire GOP presidential primary. Like any new love, it
is intense and glosses over faults.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Prescott Mayor Sam Steiger has known McCain since
McCain burst onto the Arizona political scene in 1982. He even
worked for the senator for three years in the early 1990s. That's
why, Steiger says with a smile that stretches his walrus mustache,
he is supporting Texas Gov. George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``I like John as a person, but I just think his commitment to
big government is much stronger than anyone knows,'' said Steiger,
70, who was a freshman U.S. congressman with Bush's father. ``If I
knew George W. as well as I know John, I might have a hard time
voting for him.''
</P>
<P>
   There is little doubt that McCain will win the Arizona
Republican primary Tuesday _ the question is by how much.
Presidential candidates usually win in their home states by huge
margins, often by more than 40 percentage points. Though many polls
showed McCain ahead of Bush by less than 10 percentage points last
summer and fall, his standing has improved considerably since his
New Hampshire victory. Several recent polls show he leads Bush by
about 20 points, and in one poll Thursday he had a 36-point lead.
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign says a win is a win, but if its candidate
falls short of a landslide, many will interpret the results as a
telling statement from the voters who know McCain best.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a direct connection between McCain's lack of support
among many key Republicans in Arizona and his lack of support in
the Republican Senate caucus,'' said Larry Sabato, a political
science professor at the University of Virginia. ``What should
disturb people the most is that the people who know John McCain
best seem to have the most doubts about a McCain presidency.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Arizona political scientists say there are reasons for the
relatively tight margins that have little to do with how much
people here like McCain. McCain won re-election to the Senate in
1998 with 69 percent of the vote _ almost identical to the 68
percent that Bush got in his own gubernatorial re-election bid the
same year.
</P>
<P>
   One reason is that popular Gov. Jane Dee Hull endorsed Bush.
McCain and Hull just don't like each other, in part because McCain
was close to former Gov. Fife Symington and Hull was not. Hull was
the secretary of state who took over Symington's office in 1997
after he was convicted of lying to banks to obtain loans to shore
up his foundering real estate empire.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been endorsed by all but one of Arizona's Republican
congressmen, most GOP state lawmakers and most of the state's
big-city mayors and county officials, however.
</P>
<P>
   Another reason for McCain's less-than-stellar performance in the
polls, according to Arizona GOP director Nathan Sproul, is that
Arizona has so many newcomers _ almost a million in the last 10
years. The state population is 4.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   Some also point to the disparity in political advertising.
Arizona is a far cry from the super-charged political atmosphere of
New Hampshire and South Carolina. There are few signs or bumper
stickers for either candidate, and neither has campaigned in the
state recently. But Bush has had television commercials running
since the beginning of year, while McCain had been absent from the
airwaves until this weekend when he began running radio
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bush's game was never necessarily to win here, but to tie
McCain down,'' said Ken Goldstein, a political scientist at Arizona
State University. ``Every dollar McCain had to spend in Arizona was
a dollar he couldn't spend in South Carolina and Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   Mike Hull, the governor's son who is heading Bush's Arizona
campaign, would not reveal the campaign's overall strategy in
Arizona. ``We've put in a good effort here, and that's the
important thing. The people in the state know a lot about Governor
Bush. If he wins the nomination that will be highly critical in the
general election.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldstein says McCain's improved standing in the Arizona
presidential polls is a recent phenomenon because here, as in many
other states, people didn't view him as a serious contender until
after his New Hampshire victory.
</P>
<P>
   In Prescott, a town of 35,000 in heavily Republican Yavapai
County north of Phoenix, the people who support John McCain like
him for the same reasons they do in other states. In many ways the
town is a microcosm of Arizona: Fifty years ago, Prescott had fewer
than 7,000 people, many of them miners and ranchers. Today, its
Victorian homes and 100-year-old saloons are surrounded by
subdivisions, chain stores, Indian casinos and golf courses.
Retirees are pouring in.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm fairly cynical about politics, but I suppose I like McCain
more than most politicians _ he seems to have some integrity,''
said antique store owner Pete McNey, 47.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Chilleen, who works behind the desk at a local hotel, said
he is attracted by McCain's heroism as a prisoner of war in North
Vietnam for five years and the fact that he isn't part of the ``in
crowd'' of Republicans on Capitol Hill.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a bit of a maverick. He's been through hell and he still
has a great outlook on life,'' Chilleen said.
</P>
<P>
   But not all Arizonans like McCain's independence from his
Republican colleagues. Arizona is a deeply conservative state: It
produced Barry Goldwater, the father of modern American
conservatism, and voted Republican in every presidential election
between 1952 and 1992 (it went for Clinton in 1996) _ the only
state to do so. Despite McCain's solidly conservative voting record
during his 17 years in Congress, some see his recent crusades for
campaign finance reform and against tobacco companies as betrayals
of conservative principles. The Arizona primary, unlike those in
New Hampshire and South Carolina, is limited to registered
Republicans, so McCain won't get any boost from independents and
Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   There is also the issue of McCain's prickly personality. On the
campaign trail, he jokes that he isn't a contender for the Miss
Congeniality award in the Senate, a line that goes over well in
other states, but hits a little close to home for some here.
</P>
<P>
   ``You need a president who is not only tough-talking, but
someone who's a diplomat, and who can negotiate,'' said state Sen.
Scott Bundgaard, who has endorsed Bush. ``He's a hothead _ the
governor of Arizona said so herself. She's had those sort of
run-ins with him. Most of us have, and we know other people who
have.''
</P>
<P>
   Some Arizonans even say they are a little tired of hearing about
McCain's war record, the part of his campaign that seems to
resonate the most with people outside the state.
</P>
<P>
   ``That first (congressional) campaign was based almost entirely
on his being a prisoner of war. I'd go to meetings and he'd have
little old ladies crying, and he was crying, and I don't like
that,'' said 76-year-old Anna Cocklin of Prescott, who's been
active in GOP politics in Arizona since 1953.

does, now drives economic growth. Such thinking was, and to a

`LETTERS FROM CUBA': DANCING IN NEW YORK, DREAMING OF CUBA 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Fla.)  (lb) 
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ You would be taxed to name a show with a sweeter
temper than ``Letters From Cuba,'' a lovely and contemplative
autobiographical morsel by Irene Maria Fornes that opened Sunday at
the Signature Theater's Peter Norton Space.
</P>
<P>
   The story of Fran, a young dancer sharing a New York apartment
with two men and receiving regular missives that are somehow
yearning in their mundane concerns, from her brother Luis in Cuba,
the play conveys, with a gentle humor that is occasionally
exquisite, the procession of separate lives being led in spiritual
togetherness but spatial disconnect.
</P>
<P>
   At just over an hour, the play leaves you a bit hungry; the end
arrives like a wake-up call in middream. But, to spin it kindly,
that ache of unconsummation is what the characters are feeling too.
Directed as well by the Cuban-born Fornes, a celebrated artist in
the theatrical avant-garde, the play yields a rare organic sense
that the production was conceived along with the script.
</P>
<P>
   Donald Eastman's set, an almost empty Manhattan apartment spread
in blond wood across the stage, with a Havana rooftop in shades of
blue hovering above it, suggests in its geometry the layers of
Fran's emotional life, and in its coloring the heavenly consolation
she has not quite duplicated in her new home. The cast, delivering
lines that are often forthrightly resonant with deep feeling,
achieve a uniform poise in delicate dramatic circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   The play's structure is careful and complex. It draws on actual
letters that Fornes received from Havana over 30 years, and time
moves across decades on the Cuban roof. But in New York the action
seemingly spans only months.
</P>
<P>
   Fran's family, which includes Luis (played by Chris De Oni with
a marvelous mournful dignity) and his son Enrique (the boy's
mother, Ana, is never seen), is reconfigured in Manhattan in the
personages of her roommates _ the childlike, slightly dimwitted
Marc (Matthew Floyd Miller) and the older, brotherly Joseph (Peter
Starrett), whose romantic yen for Fran she cannot entirely resist
or deny.
</P>
<P>
   The parallel is underscored by the burly actor Peter Van Wagner
in a charming dual role as the New York apartment superintendent
(who takes dance lessons from Fran) and Gerardo, a grumpy Cuban
neighbor with a bad back. As the play proceeds, the characters
visit one another in poignantly staged dream sequences; in a
passage to New York by the teen-age Enrique (Rick Wasserman), the
youthful curiosity about the United States is a hoot.
</P>
<P>
   Fornes' script is fearless in confronting profound concepts like
love and art with both simple declaration and poetic imagery. The
play is a mite stilted in conversations between Marc and Joseph.
(It gets off to a rocky start in a discussion of poetry.) But the
sentiments expressed from Cuba, from Enrique (``Mother likes to
wash her hair with rainwater'') and Luis are touching and plainly
authentic.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, words may not be the playwright's most potent tool
here. Fran (a lissome young actress named Tai Jimenez) has few
lines, but she is soulfully revealed as she practices her balletic
routines in the near-empty apartment; and the eloquence of sheer
movement provides the play's most moving scene, a dance, passed
sequentially from character to character, to a slow 1940s swing
tune.
</P>
<P>
   ``Letters From Cuba,'' which is receiving its premiere, is the
final production of Signature's season-long examination of the work
of Fornes, an appropriate look back over a life on the one hand,
and evidence of continuing vigor on the other.
</P>
<P>
   As a portrait of the artist as a young woman, and in its elegiac
treatment of the tug of home on an expatriate, the show is a
happy-sad sigh, an appealingly understated conclusion to the
collective efforts of the playwright and the company.
</P>
<P>

TRAFFIC AND WEATHER GET REGULAR UPDATES. WHY NOT THE INTERNET?
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Susan Stellin is director of development for The New York
Times on the Web.) 
(nk) 
 By SUSAN STELLIN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the midst of the recent service disruptions at several
high-profile Web sites, television viewers who tuned in to the
evening news might have noticed the decidedly technical turn the
programs had taken. For those who were otherwise engaged, picture
the incongruous image of a network television anchor earnestly
explaining the intricacies of the ``denial of service'' attacks
that shut down the likes of Yahoo, eBay and ETrade.
</P>
<P>
   It was not the first time the networks had broadcast stories
about problems affecting the Internet, of course. But the recent
news reports shed the bright light of mass media coverage on an
issue previously overshadowed by stories about highflying Internet
stock prices: The global network we have come to depend on is not
nearly as reliable as we would like.
</P>
<P>
   This is old news to anyone who has ever had trouble connecting
to America Online or typed an address into a Web browser only to
confront the message ``server unavailable.'' But the extent of the
recent media coverage of the issue raises a question: How long
before some type of ``Internet update'' joins traffic, weather and
stock market reports as a staple in our daily media diet?
</P>
<P>
   Imagine, if after telling listeners about delays on a local
freeway, the weather forecast and the closing levels of the Dow
Jones industrial average and Nasdaq, the drive-time radio announcer
continued with this update:
</P>
<P>
   ``Internet traffic continues to be slow nationwide after a
backhoe cut through a fiber cable east of Cleveland. There are
scattered rubbernecking delays after the Victoria's Secret Webcast.
And word is just in that a security alert from the CERT
Coordination Center at Carnegie Mellon University warns that a new
version of last year's destructive Chernobyl virus has turned up in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell Stephens, a professor of journalism and mass
communication at New York University, said he could imagine some
type of Internet report becoming commonplace.
</P>
<P>
   ``In some sense,'' he said, ``we move on the Internet, and
anything that obstructs our traffic is newsworthy depending on the
number of people it affects.''
</P>
<P>
   But Stephens said it might be too early to predict what focus a
regular update about Internet traffic might take. ``Is it going to
be security concerns or is it going to be traffic tie-ups? What the
regular `Internet feature' is going to be isn't entirely clear
yet.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, it is not yet clear what medium consumers might
turn to for this information, or which medium would be most suited
to deliver it.
</P>
<P>
   Internet news feeds might be most likely to provide updates
about service disruptions at isolated Web sites. But in the event
of a more widespread problem, consumers might not not even be able
to log on to get this information.
</P>
<P>
   Stephens noted what happened during the power blackout in New
York City in 1965, when some broadcasters were off the air. ``Not
only did things go black, but the form of information to tell you
why it had gone black wasn't available,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   For now, in any case, the best place to find information about
Internet traffic flow, and problems that may have disrupted it, is
online. Typically, it is not all in one place, and you have to know
where to look to find useful data.
</P>
<P>
   The aptly named Internet Traffic Report
(internettrafficreport.com), published by Andover.Net, is one of
several sites that monitor the flow of Internet data. Using a test
called a ping, the site measures how long it takes data to travel
from one point to another and back and then posts average response
times for various regions.
</P>
<P>
   For someone whose Internet connection seems to be lagging
behind, this information can shed light on whether the problem is
global or local, though it may not necessarily explain why a
collector eager to unload a truckload of Fiestaware cannot call up
eBay.
</P>
<P>
   Bruce Twickler, the president and chief executive of
Andover.Net, said the Internet Traffic Report was more a hobby than
a core part of the company's business, which has shifted toward
providing resources for Linux software developers.
</P>
<P>
   As for whether some type of Internet report would ever become a
media staple, Twickler said the determining factor would be the
level of interest. ``It's not a technical barrier,'' he said.
``It's who wants to know and why _ and up until the last couple of
years no one would have cared.''
</P>
<P>
   Executives at companies whose core business is measuring
Internet traffic said there was now a higher level of interest in
the data they collect _ but more from the perspective of
corporations than consumers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not sure it ever becomes important to the consumer,'' said
Lloyd Taylor, vice president for operations at Keynote Systems
(www.keynote.com), which provides Internet performance measurement
and consulting services. ``If I can't get to Amazon.com, is my
natural inclination to go to some Internet weather site or just go
try Barnesandnoble?''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Keynote Systems offers a variety of charts on its
Web site that could be of interest to consumers, like the average
time it takes to execute a stock transaction at various Web
brokerage firms. The company also distributes the data it collects
through the trade publication Internet World and USA Today.
</P>
<P>
   Peter H. Salus, editorial director of Matrix Information and
Directory Services, which publishes the Internet Weather Report
(www.internetweather.com), contends that the network performance
data his company gathers is relevant to consumers, but shares some
of his colleagues' skepticism about whether people care. ``People
don't seem to want to know the technical details of how their baby
pictures get to Grandma,'' he said, ``but they do want to know that
they get to Grandma.''
</P>
<P>
   Salus said the information his company published was primarily
of interest to Internet service providers, multinational
corporations and financial services companies that must ``keep
track of slowdowns in trades where a matter of minutes can be
millions of dollars.''
</P>
<P>
   The average Internet consumers have much less at stake. Unlike
drivers stuck in a traffic jam, they also have much less ability to
devise a route around whatever is causing the delay.
</P>
<P>
   But Salus expects consumers' level of interest in network
traffic to rise, particularly as more bandwidth-sapping
technologies become part of their daily lives. And Salus, for one,
would be happy to provide media outlets with the data.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm willing to talk to Don Imus and tell him where the traffic
is,'' Salus said, ``and then he can curse at the ISP's.''

THE GOOD LIFE: ENJOYING HIGH ON THE HOG, THANKS TO GEORGE AND
MARTHA 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN OWEN  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   It is no surprise that a Washington, D.C., resident named Graff
would frequently be called to lead German tour groups of the
capital. And my cousin, Don Graff, has discovered that the visitors
from Friedrichshafen, Ludwigshafen and Baden-Baden like pork
stories.
</P>
<P>
   So he tells them about George Washington, particularly when the
first president's birthday is approaching.
</P>
<P>
   The way Don tells it, between the time Washington left office
and his death, he and Martha were alone at their dining table only
once.
</P>
<P>
   Friends, supporters, ex-soldiers and near strangers would arrive
at Mount Vernon to ``pay their respects'' and then forget to leave.
</P>
<P>
   That's not a problem for those of us who reside near the Pacific
Coast. All you have to do to get rid of a family of freeloaders
from Mandan, N.D., is to surprise them at dinner with a heaping
bowl of steamed clams. John the Baptist's tonsils, served on
skewers, would not provoke such a severe reaction.
</P>
<P>
   If steamed ``little necks'' will not do the job, just lead your
visitors past one of the fish counters at Pike Place Market. Point
at the largest geoduck in the bin and remark, ``I think I'll cook
that up for dinner tonight.''
</P>
<P>
   Goodby Seattle, hello Mandan.
</P>
<P>
   But they don't have geoducks on the shores of Chesapeake Bay.
</P>
<P>
   What George and Martha often served their guests was pork.
Servants were under orders to carve a prime cut from the roast, for
the most honored guests. It was a common practice known then and
now as ``eating high on the hog.''
</P>
<P>
   When visitors had overstayed their welcome, they were liable to
confront a lesser cut of meat, often a leftover haunch from the
kitchen cooler. That was known, then and now, as ``getting the cold
shoulder.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's what Don told me. Are you going to call my cousin a
liar? As far as I know, the visitors from Munster never do. But
they really like pork stories. And they would probably like this
meal.
</P>
<P>
   High on the Hog
</P>
<P>
   1 3-pound pork loin roast
</P>
<P>
   1 large clove garlic, cut in slivers
</P>
<P>
   Salt, pepper
</P>
<P>
   One-half teaspoon dried thyme, crumbled
</P>
<P>
   1 cup dry red wine
</P>
<P>
   5 tablespoons soft bread crumbs
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons Dijon mustard
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons chopped parsley
</P>
<P>
   Using a thin-bladed knife, make several deep insertions in the
roast. Shove a slice of garlic in each. Plunk the roast in a baking
pan and rub with salt and pepper.
</P>
<P>
   Mix the thyme with the wine, pour over the roast and let it sit
for 1 to 2 hours at room temperature. Don't rush things. It's not
like the redcoats are coming to dinner.
</P>
<P>
   Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Tent a sheet of aluminum foil over
the roast and shove the pan (including the marinade liquid) into
the oven. Let roast for 50 minutes. While it is cooking, hum two
choruses of ``Yankee Doodle'' while mixing together the bread
crumbs, mustard and chopped parsley.
</P>
<P>
   Remove roast from oven. Discard the foil. Baste with the pan
juices, adding more red wine to the pan if needed.
</P>
<P>
   Spread the mustard mixture over the top and sides of the roast
and return to oven for 40 minutes or until the thermometer reads
170 to 180 degrees. Let meat rest out of the oven a couple of
minutes then carve into thick slices.
</P>
<P>
   Don't have a cow if the roast is pink inside. Pork is safe to
eat once it exceeds the temperature of 137 degrees. This roast
should serve six or more, and you might serve it with:
</P>
<P>
   Martha's Potatoes
</P>
<P>
   5 potatoes, peeled and thinly sliced
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters cup chopped onions
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons butter or margarine
</P>
<P>
   One-quarter cup flour
</P>
<P>
   13 ounces chicken broth
</P>
<P>
   Quarter cut cup mayonnaise
</P>
<P>
   Three-quarters teaspoon salt
</P>
<P>
   One-eighth teaspoon pepper
</P>
<P>
   Paprika
</P>
<P>
   Alternate layers of potatoes and onions in a casserole.
</P>
<P>
   In a saucepan melt the butter and stir in the flour. When
foaming, slowly stir in the broth and mayonnaise. Cook until sauce
thickens. Add salt and pepper and pour the sauce over the potatoes.
Sprinkle top generously with paprika and bake in a 350-degree oven
for about 75 minutes.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Through Sunday, seasonal rainfall deficits of nearly 5 inches
were tallied in both San Diego and Los Angeles. On Monday, a
portion of this deficit will be erased as a powerful storm spirals
ashore from the Pacific. Moist ocean air lifted by an approaching
jet-stream disturbance will set the stage for heavy rain across
portions of southern California. As a pocket of cold air arrives
aloft, the atmosphere will turn increasingly unstable, heightening
the risk for thunderstorms.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, heavy snow will blanket the southern California
mountains above 4,000 feet with isolated amounts exceeding a foot
by evening. Mountain snow and low-elevation showers will reach
Arizona and southern Utah later Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Generally tranquil weather will cover the central and eastern
states Monday as the jet stream begins a slow retreat into southern
Canada. The jet stream's retreat will promote a notable warming
trend over the East during the upcoming week with 60-degree
readings possible as far north as New York City by week's end.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, sinking currents of air associated with high pressure
will lead to ample sunshine from the Mississippi Valley to the East
Coast. An exception will be found across portions of the interior
Northeast where a weak front will bring clouds and some light snow
showers.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere, a stream of clouds and spotty showers will stream
northward from Texas to the central Plains, as moistening winds
from the south develop. Despite the clouds, readings will average
more than 10 degrees above normal across the region.
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Pothole Weather
</P>
<P>
   Pothole season is arriving in the Northeast. It is a time when
highways literally go to pieces. The combination of melting snow
and thawing of the ground during the daytime leads to water seepage
into cracks in the sidewalks and roads in most of the northern
states. The water, which becomes trapped in asphalt crevices by
day, freezes during the cold nights of late winter. The ice
expands, forcing larger cracks in the paved surfaces. The fissures
become particularly common in the interior Northeast, where the
daily freeze-thaw cycle typically lasts about two months.

   SPRINGFIELD, Ohio _ Every environmentally-conscious Internet
surfer faces a moral dilemma when he gets rid of his early '90s
computer dinosaur:
</P>
<P>
   Pay $40 to $70 to have it recycled, or toss it in the trash.
</P>
<P>
   Millions of tons of computers and other electronic devices are
shoved off desks every year to make way for newer versions.
</P>
<P>
   They contain mercury, PCBs and heavy metals ranging from lead to
silver and gold.
</P>
<P>
   Landfill operators, under the squeeze of evolving Environmental
Protection Agency regulations, refuse to accept truckloads of
electronics from businesses, though a lone computer in a garbage
can still legally gets crushed and buried with the rest of the
trash.
</P>
<P>
   A computer collection day at the Clark County Fairgrounds in
November was ``less than successful,'' said Debra Karns, county
Solid Waste Management District director.
</P>
<P>
   Fewer than a dozen people brought electronics to the collection,
and many of them were dismayed at the cost, although it had been
included in the announcement, she said.
</P>
<P>
   A computer monitor costs $19 to leave; the cathode ray tube out
of a TV was $10, and a computer system intact was $3 a pound.
</P>
<P>
   ``People aren't accustomed to paying to have materials
recycled,'' Karns said. ``We've had calls all along from people who
want to do the right thing. We want to provide an avenue where
people can afford to do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Businesses herded toward computer recycling by the EPA rules
have nurtured a new species of entrepreneur: The trash broker.
</P>
<P>
   One of the first in the Miami Valley, Springfield resident Ray
Harris, incorporated Special Waste Systems two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't advertise; we're not in the phone book. We're pretty
busy as it is,'' Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   He charges about $50 to pick up a personal computer for
recycling, but his regular customers are businesses that discard
truckloads of electronics each quarter.
</P>
<P>
   Harris sends the goods to Recyclights, a Columbus, Ohio firm
that reclaims the useful metals, mercury, circuit boards and other
components, and recycles the rest.
</P>
<P>
   Recyclights' customers within 50 miles of Springfield, all of
whom contract through Harris, include 30 large industrial accounts
with monthly or quarterly pick-ups of computers, fluorescent bulbs
fixtures, batteries and other hazardous recyclables.
</P>
<P>
   General Electric near Cincinnati handed over 35 office computers
a couple weeks ago and will have another 35 within the next few
weeks. Fletcher-based Midwest Micro, which manufactures,
distributes and repairs computer systems, has Harris pick up 80 or
90 monitors every two or three weeks, Harris said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris was a special waste director for Laidlaw in Dublin before
the company was bought out by Allied Industries.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a lot of customers asking me, `There's got to be a
better way to do this. Can't we recycle this?' But we (at Laidlaw)
would opt to take it to a landfill because that was revenue for
us,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   According to the trade magazine ``Resource Recycling'',
consumers readily participate in computer recycling, whether it's
through collection events, computer store drop-off sites or
curbside pick-up.
</P>
<P>
   Government-sponsored collection programs operated by local solid
waste districts seem to work the best, but they've been slow in
coming, the magazine said.
</P>
<P>
   Harris is among bidders for a contract with the Darke County
Solid Waste District, which is attempting to gather grants to make
computer recycling free to individuals, district director Anne
Vehre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``End-of-life electronic equipment recycling won't happen until
someone takes it on,'' Vehre said. ``We have places to send printer
cartridges and floppy disks, but there's really nothing set up for
electronics.''
</P>
<P>
   America is lagging behind Europe in exploring ways to recycle
that make money and protect the planet, she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``A guy watching a soybean farmer separating beans from corn got
the idea for a new machine that can automatically separate the
parts of a TV or computer in minutes, but it's not to the point
where it has been marketed as yet,'' Vehre said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Technology's being developed where waste disposal is going to
look like it's out of a science fiction movie,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, solid waste districts across the country are
juggling their commitments to the environment and to the taxpayer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not good public policy to spend $600 a ton to recycle
something. You sometimes just have to dispose of it in the most
responsible way possible and move on,'' Karns said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our challenge is: how do you get people to understand there's
a cost for this and get them to support it?'' she said.

INTERNET USERS: ISOLATED, MAYBE, BUT NOT SO DIVIDED  
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By JOHN MARKOFF   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A Stanford University survey on the social impact of the
Internet sparked debate last week because of its contention that
the rise of the global computer network is leading to a new wave of
social isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Internet enthusiasts rose en masse to complain that the study
overlooked the community-building aspects of the Internet. They
rejected the idea that more time spent in front of computers means
more isolation.
</P>
<P>
   Largely overlooked in the uproar was another striking finding
made by the researchers: that the so-called ``digital divide''
between higher-income individuals with access to information
technology and others who lack such access is largely a myth.
</P>
<P>
   According to Norman Nie, a Stanford political scientist and a
former Gallup Poll researcher, the most significant variables in
predicting Internet access at home or at work were education and
age. College education increased the rate of Internet access by
more than 40 percent, and Internet access was 40 percent more
common among people under 25 than among those over 65. High-income
individuals were 21 percent more likely to have Internet access,
while women, blacks and Hispanics had lower rates of access by just
4 percent, 5 percent and 8 percent, respectively, than the average.
</P>
<P>
   The study, which was conducted by the Stanford Institute for the
Quantitative Study of Society, polled 4,113 individuals and 2,689
households, including both Internet users and nonusers. The
researchers found that overall, some 55 percent of those surveyed
had Internet access at home or at work and that 43 percent of
households were online.
</P>
<P>
   It also found that age differences in Internet usage reflect
generational differences, suggesting that Internet use will
increase sharply over time.

WEIRD AND FUN, ANYTHING GOES WHEN IT'S CYBERPALOOZA 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: disinfo.con is the name of the event; disinfo.com is the
organization's Web site) 
(lb) 
 By JON PARELES   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The gathering at the Hammerstein Ballroom on Saturday
was something like an academic conference. Lecturers spoke about
their latest research, showing slides on a screen overhead. But the
slides were of designs for a time machine, alien handwriting and
portents of apocalypse.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering was also like a religious service, with preachers
insisting on the truth of their revelations, and a sideshow,
complete with a sword swallower and unclad women. And at times it
could have been a motivational lecture or a self-help infomercial,
not about diets or relationships but the application of Aleister
Crowley's ``magick'' and the dissolution of dualities.
</P>
<P>
   The gathering was Disinfo.con, an 11-hour event that its
organizer, Richard Metzger, summed up as ``Cyberpalooza.'' It drew
an audience in the hundreds who were largely clean-cut, in their
20s and, in a random sampling, mostly working on the Internet or in
other media jobs; they paid up to $99.95 a ticket.
</P>
<P>
   Metzger promised, in opening remarks, ``The speakers appearing
on this stage will be messing with your head, playing with your
files and committing acts of higher revolutionary mutation.''
</P>
<P>
   Among those acts were a sermon from the artist Joe Coleman, who
declared that humanity was a cancer on the body of Mother Nature;
meanwhile, videotapes of corpses being dissected were shown. ``I
call on the cleansing fires of holy extermination,'' he said; then
he lighted a Roman candle attached to his chest.
</P>
<P>
   Women from the rock group the Voluptuous Horror of Karen Black,
nude or in blue body paint, performed a punk version of the Celine
Dion hit ``My Heart Will Go On.'' But most participants confined
themselves to speeches.
</P>
<P>
   Disinfo.con brought together artists, authors, rockers,
filmmakers and less categorizable characters like Paul Laffoley,
whose ``architectonic thought-forms'' envision futuristic projects
like homes grown from genetically engineered gingko biloba seeds.
</P>
<P>
   ``The culture is liquefying,'' said Grant Morrison, who created
``The Invisibles,'' a comic book that, he said, ended up
prophesying his life. ``People are wondering: Why don't we fit into
this world? Why don't we think they're telling us the truth?''
</P>
<P>
   Genesis P-Orridge, of the rock groups Throbbing Gristle, Psychic
TV and Thee Majesty, told the audience: ``You want people to say
stuff that nobody dared say. That's why you're here.'' He ruminated
on whether the earth was a recording device and how to escape the
territorial imperatives built into DNA.
</P>
<P>
   Of course a Web site was involved: www.disinfo.com, which has
been providing what Metzger calls alternative news since 1996. He
also has an Internet talk show and a television series, ``Disinfo
Nation,'' for Channel Four in Britain.
</P>
<P>
   With articles and links, disinfo.com covers attacks on the World
Wide Web, opium cultivation in Afghanistan, death-metal bands in
Scandinavia, religious cults and anything else that strikes its six
staff members as interesting. ``A lot of people just want a
reliable source for something weird, something fun,'' Metzger said.
</P>
<P>
   Disinfo, Metzger cheerfully admitted, is out to build brand
recognition. But he's doing this at a time when culture's
transgressive fringe is just one more niche market.
</P>
<P>
   Douglas Rushkoff, who has written books about corporate
colonization of the Internet, pointed out that would-be outsiders
soon find knockoffs of their clothes at the local mall. He urged,
in a keynote address, that the counterculture consider itself
victorious and not agonize over selling out.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they just buy the thing that we really believed in,
that's them surrendering to us,'' he said. ```Teach us,' they say.
`Here, take our money.''' He said that after his speech,
advertising-agency representatives approached him with invitations
to speak to their employees.
</P>

<P>
   Marilyn Manson, transmitted live by satellite from Los Angeles,
brooded over being considered a cause of violence among teen-agers.
``I'm an obvious and easy target because I look like I cause
problems and I do, I try to,'' he said. Condemning parental
pressure, he said, ``Bad parents make bad kids.''
</P>
<P>
   Robert Anton Wilson, whose ``Illuminatus'' trilogy of novels
presented a grand unified conspiracy theory, suggested that the
difference between Federal Reserve notes and counterfeit paper
money was that the Federal Reserve Bank waved a magic wand over its
currency.
</P>
<P>
   A panel of conspiracy buffs spent much of their time saying
conspiracy-mongers can go too far. ``The idea that there's an
absolute answer to anything is patently wrong,'' said Kenn Thomas
of the magazine Steamshovel Press.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're living in a post-`X-Files' world, so what's weird after
that?'' asked Mark Pesce, the chairman of the interactive-media
department at the University of Southern California film school,
whose presentation was a mock-indoctrination and initiation for his
church. ``Now that the weird is gone, maybe what's left is to play.
That's what we've been doing today, playing with the weird.''

   FOUR FROM ORIGINAL APPLE TEAM WILL FOCUS EFFORTS ON LINUX
</P>
<P>
   Four members of the original Apple Macintosh team are regrouping
in order to take the best of the quirky Apple computer and move it
to the world of Linux software.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Hertzfeld, Mike Boich, Susan Kare and Guy Tribble are
trying to recreate the innovative tone originally set by Apple's
founder, Steve Jobs, when he led a band of renegades to design the
Macintosh in the early 1980s. They plan to take some of the best

wife, but now it has to deal with the fallout from ``Who Wants to
Marry a Multimillionaire?'' Besides questions about the propriety
of having a woman agree to marry a man she had seen for
approximately one minute, they had to explain how the groom _ a
comedian with a penchant for stunts _ could be taken seriously as a
wealthy man in need of a wife.

<P>
   The publisher of Out magazine, the United States' most widely
read magazine aimed at the gay and lesbian community, has been

   TRAFFIC REPORTERS FOR THE INTERNET

   Internet analysts say the recent service disruptions for several

 &HT;    McCain uses fiery rhetoric to regain momentum
 &HT;    By William Hershey
 &HT;    Dayton Daily News
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. _ John McCain combined fiery populist
rhetoric, biting humor and an appeal to patriotism Sunday in an
attempt to regain the momentum that George W. Bush interrupted by
soundly defeating McCain Saturday in South Carolina's Republican
presidential primary.
</P>
<P>
   On the Michigan State University campus and at other campaign
stops, McCain urged Michigan's Republicans, Democrats and
independents to vote for him in Tuesday's presidential primary so
that together they can take back their government from ``the
special interests and big money people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I lived in a hotel where there was no mint on the pillows,''
said McCain, who spent more than five years a prisoner of war in
North Vietnam. ``I know how to take a punch and I know how to fight
back.''
</P>
<P>
   The flag-waving crowd of 600 here _ a mixture of students and
adults _ roared and waved American flags as McCain paced the stage
in a campus gym.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan's Republican primary is open to all voters. Vice
President Al Gore and former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley are not
listed on the Democratic ticket; Michigan Democrats will pick
convention delegates in caucuses on March 11.
</P>
<P>
   His campaign, McCain said earlier in Livonia, a Detroit suburb,
is ``fired up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to win in the state of Michigan,'' he said.
Arizona also holds a primary Tuesday and McCain said he expects to
win his home state.
</P>
<P>
   This state's 58 delegates will be the biggest campaign prize so
far, and the contest offers Bush and McCain the first opportunity
to test their appeal in a large state that reflects the nation as a
whole. The outcome will be closely watched as it may offer a
glimpse of what's likely to happen on ``Titanic Tuesday'' March 7
when primaries will be held in 12 states, including Ohio, New York
and California.
</P>
<P>
   While McCain insisted that he is running a positive campaign, he
blasted Bush as a captive of the special interests and mocked the
Texas governor's claim that he is the real reformer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gov. Bush called himself a reformer,'' said McCain, whose
signature issue has been campaign finance reform. ``If he's a
reformer, I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   ``George Bush used to call himself a compassionate conservative.
Now he calls himself a reformer with a record. Soon he'll call
himself a Texan with tenacity,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   At both stops he said Bush would do nothing to shore up Social
Security and that the Texas governor's tax cut proposals would
unfairly benefit the rich.
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends, I don't think Bill Gates needs a tax cut,'' said
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Focusing on the students, he told them that he wants to inspire
them to sacrifice and serve their country the same way Theodore
Roosevelt, Franklin D. Roosevelt, John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan
inspired earlier generations of Americans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what being president of the United States is all
about,'' McCain told the campus crowd.
</P>
<P>
   He also blasted President Clinton and Gore for money-raising
scandals in their administration. He recalled Gore's statement that
``no controlling legal authority'' prevented him from raising money
at a Buddhist temple.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to give him a controlling legal authority, a
controlling ethical authority. And then I'm going to beat him like
a drum,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   He blasted Clinton for letting Democratic contributors sleep
overnight in the Lincoln bedroom in the White House.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president of the United States treated the Lincoln bedroom
like Motel 6 and he was the bell hop,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's broad appeal seemed to be reflected in the enthusiastic
crowds that greeted him.
</P>
<P>
   Stacey Golick, 18, a college freshman, coaxed her father into
joining her in greeting McCain when he arrived at a suburban
Detroit hotel in the early morning hours Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The younger Golick said McCain's crusade for reform and
truth-telling in what it will take to get young people interested
in government again.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be the first Republican I've ever voted for,'' said
her father, 45, a supervisor with the Ford Motor Company.
</P>
<P>
   He said he got involved in Jimmy Carter's insurgent presidential
campaign in 1976 but that his interest in politics had all but
disappeared until McCain came along. He said he supports abortion
rights - McCain doesn't - but that he's willing to overlook that
disagreement.
</P>
<P>
   Public opinion polls have shown that strong support from
Democrats and independents is the key to McCain's victory hopes.
Bush has a strong lead among Republicans, but McCain draws much
more support than Bush from non-Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   State Sen. John Schwarz, a Battle Creek Republican and McCain's
Michigan chairman, told the Michigan State crowd that McCain has
across-the-board appeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain is as conservative as the United States
Constitution, as liberal as Abraham Lincoln and as progressive as
Teddy Roosevelt,'' said Schwarz.
</P>
<P>
   McCain was accompanied by his wife Cindy, Schwarz, Republican
Sen. Fred Thompson of Tennessee and Gary Bauer, the conservative
activist and former Reagan White House aide who dropped out of the
presidential race and now backs McCain.

   PALO ALTO, Calif. _ The Beatles never got back together, but
four members of the original Apple Macintosh team are regrouping.
And they mean to take the best of the quirky Apple computer and
move it to the world of Linux software.
</P>
<P>
   Andy Hertzfeld, Mike Boich, Susan Kare and Guy Tribble are busy
trying to re-create the innovative tone originally set by Apple
Computer's founder, Steven Jobs, when he led a band of renegades to
design the Macintosh in the early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   They work in a low-slung, nondescript office building here,
filled with Silicon Valley-style cubicles and adorned with the
ubiquitous penguin mascot of the Linux free software movement. They
plan to take some of the best ideas on computer ease of use and
blend them into a new visual desktop interface for Linux. With
others in the movement, their goal is to transform the Linux
operating system, which has been designed and maintained by a
rag-tag group of computer hackers, into a direct desktop competitor
to Microsoft's Windows.
</P>
<P>
   The group founded Eazel Inc. last fall with financial backing
from the Silicon Valley angel investor Ron Conway and the former
Apple and Macromedia executive John Colligan. Mike Homer, a former
executive for Apple and Netscape, is also on the board. This
summer, Eazel plans to begin offering a free user interface _ an
icon-based software control system that can be downloaded from the
Internet _ that they say will give Linux an ease-of-use advantage
over Macintosh and Windows-based computers.
</P>
<P>
   Eazel's biggest coup to date has been in persuading Tribble to
leave Sun Microsystems, where he had been chief technology officer
for Sun's alliance with Netscape. Known as a brilliant software
designer who made significant contributions to the original
Macintosh, introduced in 1984, Tribble followed Jobs two years
later to Next Inc. There, he led the design of the software
interface for the Next system, before joining Sun in 1993.
</P>
<P>
   Eazel faces a serious challenge. Microsoft has just begun
shipping a more robust version of its Windows operating system,
Windows 2000, and Linux has only a minuscule share of the market
for desktop personal computers _ the primary market for Eazel's
Linux interface.
</P>
<P>
   Linux's strength to date has been in the market for server
computers _ network machines on which the user interface and
popular desktop applications are much less important. Currently,
Linux has a 25 percent share of the server market, compared with 38
percent for Windows. But on the desktop, only 4 percent of the 99
million operating systems sold in the United States last year were
Linux, according to International Data Corp., a market research
company.
</P>
<P>
   But for Andy Hertzfeld, a programmer whose business card reads
``software wizard,'' market share is not necessarily what matters.
</P>
<P>
   Along with the hardware designer Burrell Smith, Hertzfeld was
the very soul of the original Macintosh development team, a group
of computer designers who professed a passionate belief that their
new computer would change the world. But after Jobs was forced out
of Apple by its former chief executive, John Sculley, in 1985,
Hertzfeld became disillusioned by the company's corporate politics.
</P>
<P>
   He left Apple and began pursuing software design for non-PC
based computing devices, like intelligent stereo systems. In 1990
he helped found General Magic, a design effort underwritten by
Apple, Sony and other consumer electronics companies intent on
devising a hand-held wireless computer.
</P>
<P>
   After General Magic failed, Hertzfeld turned his programming
explorations to the World Wide Web. Then, in January 1998, he
noticed Netscape's announcement that the company would freely
distribute what it called the Mozilla version of Netscape's browser
software for use by the so-called open source programming
community.
</P>
<P>
   Open source code _ free distribution of the underlying program
instructions for software, so that other programmers can pursue
further development _ is one of the basic principles behind the
open or free software movement that Mozilla and, even more
important, Linux, came to represent.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzfeld had known Richard Stallman, one of the founders of the
free software movement, for more than 15 years. But Stallman had
always struck him as a ``kook,'' he said. When Hertzfeld himself
began to rethink the idea of free software, he concluded that
Stallman was a visionary.
</P>
<P>
   ``It became so obvious to me,'' Hertzfeld said. ``The shared
software infrastructure should be owned by the community. It's
beautiful and it's correct. And so I started working in the free
software world.''
</P>
<P>
   Completely free software, of course, will not pay the rent. So
last summer Hertzfeld began to think about the idea of turning his
passion into a business. With Mike Boich, another early Macintosh
programmer who had gone on to start several Silicon Valley computer
hardware companies, Hertzfeld searched for a way to combine the
free-software philosophy with a for-profit business.
</P>
<P>
   Along with Bart Decrem, a Stanford law school graduate who had
created a nonprofit technology access center in East Palo Alto,
Calif., the two former Macintosh designers struck upon the idea of
designing a free user interface for Linux and then selling a highly
automated form of Linux service and support on a subscription
basis. The Eazel team persuaded Susan Kare, a graphic artist who
designed icons for the original Macintosh and also for Microsoft,
to join their effort.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   There are now at least 140 competing distributors of the Linux
operating system, and both Microsoft and Apple are already pursuing
similar Internet-based software-support ideas. So Eazel could have
trouble distinguishing itself in an already crowded field.
</P>
<P>
   But Hertzfeld contends that by automating many of the
system-configuration and management tasks that are now barriers to
ordinary computer users, the Linux community can achieve the same
kind of growth on the PC desktop that it is now seeing in the
computer and Internet server markets, creating a market big enough
for many players.
</P>
<P>
   Some industry analysts say that Eazel's timing may be right, if
the Linux movement can build the kind of popular applications that
are now largely dominated by Microsoft in the PC industry _
programs like word processors, spreadsheets and databases.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eazel is at the right time,'' said Dan Kusnetsky, an operating
system analyst at International Data. ``Nobody has made a major
impact on the desktop with Linux yet because the barrier has been
applications.''
</P>
<P>
   Eazel has formed an alliance with the group of Linux programmers
who developed the Gnome interface for the Linux operating system.
Under this pact, the Eazel team has taken responsibility for the
appearance _ the ``look and feel'' of the program that serves as
the control panel for the Linux operating system _ while the Gnome
group will concentrate on the internal plumbing.
</P>
<P>
   The Gnome programmers are led by Miguel de Icaza, a Mexican
software programmer who is the guiding light behind one of the two
main user interfaces in the Linux world. The other main interface
is a desktop manager system known as KDE _ for K Desktop
Environment _ which is also widely used by Linux programmers. But
Hertzfeld's programmers decided that the Gnome team more closely
matched their style and perspective.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gnome just resonated with my spirit,'' Hertzfeld said, while
acknowledging differences between the older, original Macintosh
people and the younger, free-software hackers. ``It was a little
bit strange meeting them,'' he said. ``We felt like graybeards and
they seemed like teen-agers.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, the year-old relationship has not been painless. The
two groups talked about, then rejected, the idea of merging, and
they have quibbled over various technical issues. In the end,
though, Hertzfeld said he believed that the two teams' ability to
reach an accommodation illustrates the strength of the Linux
programming movement.
</P>
<P>
   De Icaza, in turn, has started his own company, aiming at the
heart of Microsoft's dominant Office suite of business-productivity
application programs. His company, Helixcode, based in Boston, is
finishing a free Linux competitor to Office that includes a word
processor, spreadsheet and mail and calendar program.
</P>
<P>
   But de Icaza remains cautious about how quickly the Eazel-Gnome
alliance will be able to mount a direct challenge to the world's
largest software company in the operating system market. ``I'm not
so sure how vulnerable Microsoft is,'' he said.

ONCE AGAIN, A GENEROUS DOSE OF MESSIAEN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JAMES R. OESTREICH    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Who could have guessed a year ago, when there came
the seemingly rare opportunity to hear all of Messiaen's organ
works in expert performances and relatively quick succession, that
another would come around so soon, with the time frame even more
condensed?
</P>
<P>
   Then, Jon Gillock, an American, played the works over five
months at Riverside Church. Now, Olivier Latry, a Frenchman and the
organist at the Cathedral of Notre Dame in Paris, is performing
them over two and a half weeks on the splendid Mander organ at the
Church of St. Ignatius Loyola on Park Avenue.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to the simplifying mystics of Eastern Europe so much
in vogue, Messiaen proves something of a mystical maximalist at
times, with his polymodal textures and cathedral-like complexes of
sonority. Yet his standing has only grown in the eight years since
his death.
</P>
<P>
   That is clear from the advertisement on the back of the program
for this event, in which Deutsche Grammophon touts seven major
Messiaen recordings of recent vintage and announces that Latry is
to record the complete organ works at Notre Dame. He recently
finished a cycle there and soon goes on to do another, at St.
Paul's Cathedral in London.
</P>
<P>
   The second of the six programs here, on Feb. 15, was especially
attractive in its symmetry, presenting the ``Diptyque,'' from 1930,
and ``Les Corps Glorieux,'' from 1939, with a substantial diptych
of its own as centerpiece.
</P>
<P>
   Several programs this season have sensitized listeners to years
like 1939, when so many European composers were haunted by the
prospect of war. But just how little regard Messiaen, a fervent
Roman Catholic, had for worldly affairs is apparent in the
``Diptyque,'' where earthly life is depicted as a vain bustle in
contrast to the sublime stasis of paradise. The last note of the
gradual ascent of the second part stretches to half a minute or
more.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, ``The Combat of Death and Life,'' at the center of
``Les Corps Glorieux,'' refers not to war but to the suffering and
death of Christ. The work as a whole is a meditation on glorified
bodies, resurrected after death. Although its spiritual intent is
evident in its repeated use of chantlike monody and its repeated
specification of the ``celestial voice'' registration, the music is
abstract, colorful and multifaceted enough to rivet even the
skeptic.
</P>
<P>
   The simplicity of Messiaen's cosmology, if not his music,
remains a wonder. He seems to be on familiar terms with angels and
co-opts even the fallen ones, here using the tritone _ the interval
of three whole tones, the long-shunned ``devil in music'' _ as a
cadential figure, a point of repose, in the movement ``Refinement
of the Glorified Bodies.''
</P>
<P>
   Latry's readings were excellent, unhurried yet intense. And as
with Gillock, the unseen Latry was shown via closed-circuit
television, a happy innovation.
</P>
<P>
   The next program is on Tuesday. Despite present evidence, such
an abundance of this rich yet rarefied music may not return any
time soon.

THOMSON JUMPS HEAD FIRST INTO AN ELECTRONIC FUTURE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TIMOTHY PRITCHARD   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TORONTO _ The last 65 years, the Canadian media giant Thomson
has been in and out of nonmedia businesses that held temporary
promise _ oil and travel, to name two. But it has always owned
newspapers, dailies and weeklies through which millions of
Canadians and Americans knew the Thomson name.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, though, the Thomson Corp. said it would sell all its
newspapers _ 55 dailies and 75 other periodicals _ with the lone
exception of its flagship daily, The Globe and Mail, which is based
in Toronto but printed and sold across Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson plans to put some of the $2.5 billion these 130 papers
could fetch into expanding its electronic databases. These
subsidiaries already account for half of the company's $6 billion
in annual sales _ albeit through companies the public may know
little about.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson's other businesses include a legal and regulatory group,
led by the legal publisher the West Group and its Westlaw online
research service; Thomson Learning, a seller of textbooks for
professionals and students; Thomson Financial, a provider of
financial information that includes First Call/Thomson, which polls
financial analysts to produce earnings forecasts; and Thomson's
scientific, reference and health-care group, which sells
information to researchers and other professionals.
</P>
<P>
   Within five years, 80 percent of its revenue will come from the
electronic distribution of information, Thomson said. Investors
like this strategy, and since the announcement on Feb. 15 shares of
Thomson have gained 5.4 percent on the Toronto Stock Exchange. They
closed Friday at $34.56.
</P>
<P>
   ``The sale of the papers has been a catalyst,'' said Jeremy
Burge, media and telecommunications analyst at TD Securities in
Toronto. The decision to sell the newspapers has made the financial
world aware that Thomson is a global leader in electronic content,
Burge said, even if the move has nothing to do with entertainment,
which many think is how content is defined.
</P>
<P>
   Nominally, Toronto is Thomson's main office, but its operating
executives work in Stamford, Conn., and the bulk of its business is
in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Thomson's databases are valuable research tools for lawyers,
accountants, investment advisers and educators. Other systems
developed for the financial services sector manage a variety of
activities, keeping records of securities transactions and
measuring comparative performances _ of mutual funds, for example.
</P>
<P>
   Globalization is creating a demand for these services around the
world, Burge said, ``and Thomson can leverage off what it's got in
the United States.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, the company has spent more than $2 billion on
114 database acquisitions, he said, and there are still hundreds of
smaller companies that could be brought into the fold in Europe and
North America.
</P>
<P>
   A big takeover is also within Thomson's means. What fits in the
company's future must be electronic and global, not print and
local, Thomson's president and chief executive, Richard J.
Harrington, said last week. The newspapers on the block are mostly
in small cities in the United States, though five are in Canada.
Together, they had revenues of $810 million last year and earnings
before interest, taxes and depreciation of $220 million.
</P>
<P>
   There should be no shortage of buyers for the 125 papers in the
United States, said Jeremy Halbreich, chairman and president of
American Consolidated Media, a Dallas-based company that owns 22
small-circulation papers. Thomson is known for running good
businesses that are particularly strong in sales and marketing, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Dailies with circulations over 50,000 include The Tribune in
Mesa, Ariz.;nnecticut Post in Fairfield County, The
Repository in Canton, Ohio; and The Post-Crescent, in Appleton,
Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Prospective buyers are thought to include Knight Ridder of San
Jose, Calif.; the MediaNews Group of Denver; and Hollinger
International, a Toronto company that already has 90 papers in the
United States. But dozens of smaller regional chains will be
looking at opportunities to either fill a gap in their coverage or
expand. Although Thomson would prefer to sell everything at once,
analysts say it is more likely the papers will be sold in regional
clusters. Goldman, Sachs is Thomson's adviser on the sale.
</P>
<P>
   These days, weekly papers are being sold for five to six times
profit before taxes, interest and depreciation, analysts said. The
multiples on small dailies, depending on size and growth, can range
from eight to 12, and sometimes more if they have broadened their
services _ with Internet sites, for example, as many Thomson papers
have done.
</P>
<P>
   In Canada, only a handful of bidders exist for the five papers
on the block, the largest being The Winnipeg Free Press. Newspaper
ownership has become highly concentrated in Canada, partly because
of restrictions against foreign buyers. The Canadian publishers
that have expressed interest in this rare chance to expand are
Hollinger; Quebecor Inc. of Montreal, which owns the Sun chain; and
the Torstar Corp., owner of The Toronto Star.
</P>
<P>
   The Globe and Mail, Thomson said, fits with its new objectives,
in part because its base is national, not regional. More important,
though, The Globe has developed four Internet sites _ two
specializing in business information _ and a business television
channel. Those sites could lead the way to selling a wider range of
electronic services, which in Thomson's view might be easier to
market around a well-known core product, the newspaper.

TWEAKING AN ARTIFICIAL NOSE TO SNIFF OUT AILMENTS 
EYEGLASSES PANEL LETS WEARER SHOW TRUE COLORS
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SABRA CHARTRAND   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not hard to guess that a company named Cyrano might have
something to do with noses. It's less obvious that the company
produces sensors that can smell a sick person's breath, bodily
fluids or a wound, and diagnose infections or disease from their
odor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chemical profiles are pretty good markers for disease,''
explained Steven Sunshine, chief executive of Cyrano Sciences Inc.,
in Pasadena, Calif. Those chemical profiles _ or odors _ are
usually lost on the naked nose, but they are nevertheless a
byproduct of sickness.
</P>
<P>
   ``A hundred years ago, one of the primary tools physicians used
was smell,'' Sunshine said. ``But through more sophisticated tools
and technology, they migrated away from it, and it's not even used
at all anymore.''
</P>
<P>
   Cyrano has licensed a patent awarded to two researchers at the
California Institute of Technology, Nathan Lewis and Michael
Freund. Their invention uses a composite of 32 sensors made of
plastic and embedded with particles that can conduct electricity.
</P>
<P>
   The technology is designed to work like the human nose, Sunshine
said. ``The human nose works by having an array of sensors, none of
which are specific to any one vapor or odor. But each sensor
responds to stimulus or a chemical compound in a different way,
sending signals to the brain, and the brain interprets those
signals in different ways.''
</P>
<P>
   In the case of the invention, the brain's job is taken over by a
microprocessor and a pattern-recognition algorithm. The nose is
replaced by the composite of sensors, which Sunshine said ``acts
like a sponge.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When vapors come into our device or pass by the array, each
sensor element swells,'' he said. ``When the plastic swells, it
moves the particles farther apart and changes the resistance of the
composite, making it less conductive.''
</P>
<P>
   The change in resistance is measured, providing a pattern that
identifies the type of micro-organism present in the vapors; the
microprocessor and algorithm handle the analysis. The results are
displayed on a small screen.
</P>
<P>
   Though the artificial nose has 32 sensors, it can detect a far
greater number of odors.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number is huge, essentially two to the thirty-second
power,'' Sunshine said. ``The limitations are not in the number of
things it can smell, but how close the smells are to each other.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunshine said that hand-held devices incorporating the
technology will eventually have access to the Internet, allowing
the sample to be compared to much larger databases.
</P>
<P>
   His company (www.cyranosciences.com) is ready to release a
detector for quality control inspections in the chemical and food
industries. But its goal is to adapt the technology for health
care.
</P>
<P>
   ``The focus of this patent just issued is the use of the array
technology to detect infections,'' Sunshine said. ``We can actually
smell the difference between certain bacteria.''
</P>
<P>
   The company is about to begin clinical trials, using breath
samples to detect infections in the upper respiratory tract.
Eventually the same technology is expected to be used to sniff out
infection and disease in blood, urine or other body fluids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our first target is primary care physicians,'' Sunshine said,
with the idea that once the technology is proven, the devices will
be made available to consumers.
</P>
<P>
   So one day, parents who wonder whether their child has a simple
cold or an ear infection might use the electronic nose to determine
whether to see a doctor. And the physician who now relies on a
visual inspection of the ear to diagnose infection could use the
array to help determine whether the child needs an antibiotic.
</P>
<P>
   The sensor array received patent 6,017,440.
</P>
<P>
   Eyeglasses panel lets wearer show true colors
</P>
<P>
   The presidential campaign trail is lined with people wearing
T-shirts, hats and buttons to support one candidate or another. Now
an inventor from Webster, N.Y., has patented yet another way that
delegates to the party conventions this summer might proclaim their
allegiance: a small display panel that attaches to a pair of
eyeglasses like a flag.
</P>
<P>
   Mark Liebenow pictures it like this: a candidate's name or a
party slogan is emblazoned on the panel, which attaches with a
small arm to the temple of a pair of glasses. The panel is big
enough for labels or stickers, Liebenow says in his patent, or it
can be painted. The image or message could be anything the wearer
chooses _ a motto, the name of a sports team, insignia and so
forth.
</P>
<P>
   Liebenow received patent 6,023,864.
</P>

WHEN ART DIGESTS LIFE AND DISGORGES ITS POISON
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By MARGO JEFFERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   I watched the 1998 documentary ``The Brandon Teena Story'' and
the 1999 feature film ``Boys Don't Cry,'' based on the same events,
in one day. In fact, I watched them within an hour of each other,
which was harrowing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course there was the story. Teena Brandon, free, white and
21, wanted to be free of her female identity. So she left it behind
in Lincoln, Neb., and rode into Falls City, Neb., as a man named
Brandon. There she won the prettiest girl and hung out with the
toughest guys until her past caught up with her, for which she paid
by being raped and then, once she brought charges against those
same tough guys, killed.
</P>
<P>
   But I was also struck, no stricken, by what these two films
leave one thinking about that old matter of life versus art. It's
partly the question of what art must do with ``the bloody sprawling
mess'' (Katherine Anne Porter's words) to make us find something
redemptive in it. It's also about how life competes with art
voraciously, daring it to include all those trashy coincidences and
narrative pileups, all the personality twisters we encounter every
day.
</P>
<P>
   And these questions do not come up just when a wrenching life is
made into a wrenching work of art like Kimberly Peirce's ``Boys
Don't Cry.'' Look at how people throw themselves into the talk soup
of daytime television shows, performing their lives with histrionic
gusto or audition for serials like MTV's ``Real Life,'' in which
they can play themselves weekly with the naturalism so
characteristic of American acting. Why shouldn't they be rewarded
for playing the selves they're stuck with, since they are not going
to be rewarded for playing anyone else?
</P>
<P>
   This conundrum makes it extremely unsettling to watch the ``real
life'' people play themselves in Susan Muska's and Greta
Olafsdottir's spare, mournful documentary, and then to see actors
play them yet again. Peirce's cast is brilliant without ever
resorting to imitation, but the people playing themselves are
utterly compelling, too. If they were actors they would be getting
high praise and possibly award nominations.
</P>
<P>
   The documentary can show us only photographs of Brandon Teena
and play a brief recording of her flat alto voice, made the night a
Falls City sheriff grilled her with deliberate coarseness about the
rape. But there in living, apparently unrepentant color are John
Lotter and Thomas Nissen, who raped and killed her. Boys one wants
to call them, with those lethal juvenile-delinquent manners we've
seen on thousands of movie and television screens: the cocky
forthrightness followed by sullen blankness; the admission of guilt
delivered with a ``Hey man, stuff happens'' shrug or half-smile.
There is Lana Tisdel too, the snappy, karaoke-singing long-haired
blonde with the red fingernails who enraged Thomas and John by
continuing to date Brandon even after being told he was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   What a chasm there is between the waste and horror of the lives
we see here and the triumph of the art and the artists. Don't
misunderstand me: ``Boys Don't Cry'' is exactly the kind of art we
need, for it pulls viewers (with such visual and emotional care)
into worlds and lives they might otherwise neither know nor want to
know. But a critic's usual words, like ``astonishing,''
``beautifully crafted'' and ``powerful,'' feel wrong here. ``Boys
Don't Cry'' is not only art; it is art so shadowed by life that I
am tempted to call it an artistic hermaphrodite. I'd like to see
movie theaters show the documentary and the feature side by side.
Each is complete, but together they are a revelation.
</P>
<P>
   Hilary Swank does look very much like the dead man-woman. How
beautifully she captures everything you see in the photographs: the
sweet but also triumphant smile (``I'm getting away with it!''),
the proudly worn cowboy hat, the eagerness to charm and please.
</P>
<P>
   Her re-creation feels like a raising from the dead. But it
wouldn't be so astonishing if she didn't also remind us that every
boy has to practice being a boy. Getting the walk, the shoulders,
the handshake, right; asking a girl to dance or roller skate
without looking like a dork; impressing the guys without alienating
the girls. And finally the thrill of getting it right, having that
power. I'd never understood this so clearly until I saw a woman lay
claim to it all.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the documentary reveals things that the feature excludes
for the sake of dramatic intensity, or minimizes (for the sake of
audience sympathy?). We see only Brandon's affair with Lana in
``Boys Don't Cry,'' while quite a few ex-girlfriends from his
hometown appear in the documentary. Swank exudes androgynous
sexuality. Clearly, so did Brandon. He knew what girls wanted, his
ex's keep saying. He was courteous, and a good kisser too. ``It was
really nice being treated like a lady instead of like dirt,''
Tisdel recalls. Too many women savored Brandon's manly behavior to
want to admit he was a woman.
</P>
<P>
   The 21-year-old also had the profile of a young male delinquent:
wanted for auto theft and known for petty larceny and check
forging. Brandon was a beguiling con artist, stealing from friends
to buy friends gifts. (One girlfriend was given an engagement ring
bought on her own stolen credit card.) And ``Boys Don't Cry'' could
have shown this more clearly. Why not? Maybe the sympathies of some
viewers would have waned, but Peirce and her co-writer, Andy
Bienen, would have intensified the masquerade and the shock of its
end.
</P>
<P>
   For what the movie makes implacably real is the fury the men
feel at being fooled. They don't just rape Brandon because of the
sex with Lana; they have to rape because they were tricked.
</P>
<P>
   What a strong, gifted director Peirce is. And apart from Swank
there is Chloe Sevigny as Lana, so truculent and distant, then so
full of quicksilver excitement. And, so chillingly, there are Peter
Sarsgaard and Brendan Sexton III as the murdering pair. You do not
feel that you are watching actors play parts. You feel you are
watching them using their own bodies to house other people's souls.

Page 1, Monday, Feb. 21. The NYT frontpage advisory, with layout

Night Supervisor is Lynn Hoogenboom; phone: (888) 346-9867; e-mail:

<P>
   MICH-REPUBS (Dateline TK) _ Attention turns to the Michigan
primary. By Frank Bruni and Alison Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   OILPRICES-ECON (Washington) _ For the past year, even as the
price of oil tripled to $30 a barrel from a record low of $10,
policy makers, economists and many in the oil industry itself hewed
closely to the same line: oil doesn't matter much anymore.
Technology, which depends much less on energy than manufacturing
does, now drives economic growth. Such thinking was, and to a
certain extent remains, conventional wisdom. But it has taken only
a few weeks of $2 a gallon home heating oil, $20 airline ticket
surcharges, and $75 to gas up Ford Expeditions to make people
wonder if oil is really so irrelevant. By Joseph Kahn.
</P>
<P>
   IRAN-ELECTION (Tehran, Iran) _ Returns are still trickling in
from the parliamentary elections, and they show more gains for
reformers. By Susan Sachs.
</P>
<P>
   KOSOVO-UNREST (Mitrovica, Yugoslavia) _ Angry Serbs stoned,
punched and kicked American troops in the northern, Serb-dominated
district of this town today, forcing them to beat a hasty retreat
and cut short their part in a citywide search for weapons. German
troops also came under a hail of stones in the same area. By
Carlotta Gall.
</P>
<P>
   AUCTION-LAWSUIT (Undated) _ In the art world Herbert Black is
known as a man who loves art and antiques, and loathes the auction
houses where he buys and sells them. Suddenly he has a lot of
company. Black, a copper trader from Montreal, is suing the two
major art auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's. He and other
disgruntled customers contend that they were overcharged because of
collusion by the two rival auction houses, and they are basing
their suits in a criminal antitrust investigation being conducted
by the Justice Department. The fallout is likely to be not just
embarrassing but also expensive for Sotheby's and Christie's, which
could end up paying their irate clients tens of millions of
dollars. By Leslie Eaton and Carol Vogel.
</P>
<P>
   FLA-HOMESTEAD-REBUILD (Homestead, Fla.) _ Homestead has still
not reclaimed its old self. Andrew chased out much of the white
middle class, obliterated an Air Force base that poured more than
$400 million a year into the area's economy and reduced houses,
trailer parks and 3,000 acres of lime groves to a horizon of
sticks. Still, in the rubble of Hurricane Andrew, an entirely
different Homestead has begun to bloom, a transformed community
that says much about the changes that are sweeping small towns
across this state and much of the South. By Peter T. Kilborn.
</P>
<P>
   NY-TRASH (New York) _ The closing of Fresh Kills Landfill, which
Mayor Rudolph Giuliani has predicted could happen before the
state-imposed deadline of December 2001, has already evoked
reserved celebration on Staten Island. But the huge effort to
achieve that goal has come at an unexpectedly high price. By Eric
Lipton.
</P>
<P>
   NY-GORE-MRSCLINTON (Albany, N.Y.) _ Al Gore and Hillary Rodham
Clinton have left the White House nest and are learning to fly on
their own. Sunday at the Wilborn Temple, a red brick historic black
church in downtown Albany packed with 1,500 worshippers, the two
came together for the first time as candidates, he for president,
she for senator from New York. They praised each other to the
rafters, and their spokesmen said the two would be eager to appear
together again. By Katharine Q. Seelye.

NEW ZEALAND BEGINS DEFENSE WITH A VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (rk) 
 By HERB McCORMICK   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ Three-and-a-half-million Kiwis let out a
collective sigh of relief Sunday after Team New Zealand, an unknown
quantity before Sunday's contest, began its first defense of the
America's Cup with a decisive victory over Italy's Prada Challenge
in Race 1 of the 30th cup competition. Race 2 of the best-of-9
finals is scheduled for Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   On a spectacular summer afternoon, a massive spectator armada of
more than 2,000 vessels watched the Team New Zealand boat, NZL 60,
approaching from the starboard end of the starting line, lock up
with Prada's Luna Rossa with five minutes to go. Both crews
appeared tentative, but the Kiwi tactician Brad Butterworth was
jealously protective of the right-hand side, and he was having none
of the Prada strategist Torben Grael's attempts to steal it away.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Luna Rossa hit the line at full speed, with the Kiwis
three seconds behind. Now it was time to finally see what has been
the source of endless speculation along the docks of this
sailing-crazy city for months: would NZL 60 be able to match the
speed of the challenging boat?
</P>
<P>
   Holding to starboard tack, the two boats lined up side by side
and, sliding off to the left, the differences in pace were
indiscernible in the first third of the inaugural beat. If
anything, Luna Rossa appeared to have the tiniest of advantages.
``We've got more speed,'' said a member of the Prada after-guard.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, but the Kiwis had Butterworth, the laconic mastermind
who had somehow been pried off his beloved golf course for one of
the most important boat races in his nation's history, and who was
about to reveal his genius. The wind, flowing from the south at
compass readings between 180 and 190 degrees, had a right-hand
bias, and Butterworth played it for all it was worth.
</P>
<P>
   Working up the leg, NZL 60 began to initiate the action, tacking
toward the center of the course and forcing Luna Rossa, unable by
the smallest of margins to cross in front of the Kiwis, to tack
away.
</P>
<P>
   With each successive encounter, the New Zealanders added a few
more yards to their growing advantage. Grael, hoping to force the
Kiwis into an error, twice threw false tacks at NZL 60, instructing
the helmsman Francesco de Angelis to push the bow into the wind as
if beginning the maneuver, then falling back to his original
course.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were being rolled, so we tried the fake tacks,'' Grael
said. ``You have to do something when you are in the back.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   But the Kiwis would not bite. Prada's moves, undertaken with a
whiff of desperation, had backfired. Their momentum was lost with
each ill-advised head fake, and NZL 60 pulled steadily away. At the
top mark of the 18.5-mile course, the New Zealanders led by a firm
22 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   The Kiwis performed a perfect gennaker set while the Italians
struggled. ``Too slow,'' Grael shouted, pleading for a jump start
to the proceedings.
</P>
<P>
   Based on their quickness in the final two races of the
challenger series against America One, in light to moderate
conditions similar to Sunday's, many felt the forecast favored Luna
Rossa. But as the race unfolded, the Kiwis seemed as swift as the
Italians, if not faster. That fact was underscored at the second
mark, which they rounded with a lead of 36 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   ``As for who has the faster boat, I think it's too early to
comment after a shifty day like today,'' de Angelis said. ``I think
the boats are very close.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Someone had to win and someone had to lose. But it's
just the first day.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth was sailing as if he had a lifelong knowledge of the
Hauraki Gulf, which of course he has. He continued to play the
right and, when the wind swung even further in that direction,
spinning around to a compass reading of 215 degrees, he was in the
catbird's seat. At the completion of the second windward leg, with
the race at the midway point, the lead was a whopping 63 seconds.
</P>
<P>
   Prada was determined to make it interesting, and it did on the
ensuing run, bringing a hint of a new breeze with it from behind
and closing the gap to 25 seconds at the bottom mark.
</P>
<P>
   But on this day, the Italian's hopes were false ones. With the
wind continuing to shift and fluctuate, Butterworth kept finding
the better air, and NZL 60 opened a lead of 1 minute 16 seconds
with one leg to go. It was business as usual for the closing
stretch of Race 1, with the New Zealanders winning by 1:17.

TAKE 5 GUYS, BLEND VOICES, AWAIT FAME

   The story has possibilities: a music manager loses his job with
the group he discovered; now he has the chance to create a new
group, but only if he can do it in seven days, in time for ``this
whopper of a gig'' in Jacksonville, Fla. The form has
possibilities: this could be a mock documentary about a fictional
band like ``This Is Spinal Tap.'' But ``2Gether,'' a clunker of an
MTV movie that has its premiere Monday night, is so lacking in wit
and point of view that it makes ``That Thing You Do!,'' Tom Hanks'
film about a Beatles-like American rock band, look like Chekhov.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Buss (Alan Blumenfeld), the manager, knows how the music
business works. ``There are five basic types in every successful
boy band,'' he says, listing them: the bad boy, the shy type, the
little guy, the reassuring older brother and the heartthrob. So how
hard can it be to find five young men who fit those images and can
carry a tune?
</P>
<P>
   He finds his heartthrob, Jerry (Evan Farmer), singing on a
street corner. At the Mr. Teen New York pageant he finds his shy
type, Chad (Noah Bastian), clutching the stage curtain during the
swimsuit competition. And since Chad won't travel without his
brother, Doug (Kevin Farley, who looks a lot like his brother
Chris), Bob signs him on, too, as the older brother type.
Unfortunately, he's a little older than one might expect _ his wife
and two children have just left him _ so Bob puts him in
orthodontia in hopes that teen-agers will identify with him.
</P>
<P>
   The group's bad boy, Mickey (Alex Solowitz), is discovered as he
is about to attack a snack-van operator for selling bad cotton
candy. And Bob finds his cute little guy, Q.T. (Michael Cuccione),
in a juice bar singing ``The Battle Hymn of the Republic'' on
karaoke night. Q.T. has terminal liver disease and smiles big as he
confirms this to the other band members. ``We are going to get so
many chicks,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   This is actually one of the film's better lines, going for the
risky humor in a young man's taking sexual advantage of his coming
death. The rest of the attempts at humor just seem to establish
that everyone in the story is stupid. Bob tells his group that he's
the boss: ``There can be only one captain on this ship. No
Tennille.'' 2Gether's big hit begins: ``Say it, don't spray it. I
want the news, not the weather.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the supposedly serious dialogue is insipid. When Jerry's
girlfriend (Lauren Smith) urges him not to give up his job at the
hotel to become part of a band, he explains: ``That's all I think
about, Erin, is singing. I mean, when I'm in the hotel carrying
bags or when I'm holding doors open for people, I hum songs to
myself. And when I'm in the parking lot singing with the guys,
that's like my No. 1 element.''
</P>
<P>
   The vapidity seems deliberate, and the moral of ``2Gether''
appears to be that in the age of 'N Sync and the Backstreet Boys,
with a little slick packaging anybody can become a star. Yet
viewers are asked to love 2Gether and hate Whoa, the famous band
that came before them. The only definite point of view in the
script is that lip-synching is bad. It's good to know that the
current MTV generation and its moral arbiters can agree on
something.

   LONDON _ It may have a princely name, but the Royal Court
Theater is best known for being where John Osborne's ``Look Back in
Anger'' revolutionized postwar British drama in 1956, siccing the
angry young man character and his alienated world on the genteel
tradition of drawing-room mysteries, parlor dramas and comedies of
manners.
</P>
<P>
   ``To have swept all that crockery away,'' Arthur Miller remarked
in tribute to the pace-setting theater, ``took a mighty arm.''
</P>
<P>
   In the years since, the muscle has remained in the programming
of gritty, radical works, but it deserted the aging limbs of the
building itself. An Italianate confection built in 1888, it
increasingly groaned and sagged under its own busy history and
finally closed in 1996 for major repairs. Just how major the
repairs would be and how they would be paid for led to some
offstage restoration dramas, but the curtain is now set to rise
again _ the official reopening is Tuesday _ and the new scene looks
to be a characteristically original one.
</P>
<P>
   ``We inherited a theater with a magnificent tradition, an unsafe
stage, dressing rooms which were a disgrace to civilized society
and maximum discomfort for the audience,'' said Sir John Mortimer,
the playwright and author who is the theater company's chairman.
``We took our chance and created a beautiful and welcoming theater,
in which the size of the auditorium is unchanged and the ghosts of
Shaw, Granville-Barker and Osborne will feel as at home as the
challenging, innovative and exciting new writers we are there to
serve.''
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century the impresario Harley
Granville-Barker made the Royal Court's first mark on British
theater, staging untried plays by people like Shaw, Yeats, Ibsen
and Galsworthy. By the 1930s it had become a movie theater, and in
the 1940s the blitz of World War II put it out of business. Then
came the 1950s and the Royal Court regained stature as a dramatic
foil to the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   When reconstruction began, the ambitions seemed to outdistance
the possibilities. ``We were contemplating creating a proper
working theater out of the shambolic, unhygienic, aesthetically
problematic mess we had,'' said Stephen Daldry, the former artistic
director. ``At one point we thought of knocking the whole thing
down and starting from scratch.''
</P>
<P>
   The site could not have been more restricting. Only 8,000 square
feet, it was ringed by buildings on two sides, a subway station on
a third and the main sewer for southwest London at the back. ``They
told us if we broke into that, the whole Serpentine would flood
into the theater, `` said Steven Tompkins, the lead architect,
referring to the lake that snakes through nearby Hyde Park. ``That
raised the stakes somewhat.''
</P>
<P>
   The renovators did not want for advice. Everyone in the British
theater world, it seemed, had a sense of possessing a part of the
broken-down jewel box of a theater with its intimate 400-seat house
and its stately facade of columns and pediments and ornamental
windows overlooking Sloane Square in the Chelsea district.
Memories, stories, impressions and counsel poured in.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Royal Court, in my day, was the most exciting theater in
London,'' wrote the actress Sarah Miles. ``Its smell lingers still,
ripe pears and honey dripping off old, dusty walnut. Can you please
make sure it smells the same?''
</P>
<P>
   There was a grudging affection for its crumbling state. ``I'm
going to miss the throaty roar of the ladies' toilet just off the
stalls flushing loudly in the middle of many a great and moving
monologue,'' said the director Terry Gilliam, ``often just the
right touch of a sorely needed reality.''
</P>
<P>
   The playwright Alan Bennett remembered dozing off during a
rehearsal and waking suddenly when the fourth-story window he was
leaning against began to give way. The actress Lindsay Duncan
recalled waiting in the cramped wings, listening for her cue above
a howling sound system and thinking, ``Please God, oh please God _
anybody _ please destroy this building.''
</P>
<P>
   For the actress Maureen Lipman, the Royal Court was ``a place
that vibrated with excitement. It seemed daring, iconoclastic,
intrigue-filled, fashionable, feisty _ before the word existed _
and entirely the place one wanted to be accepted by.''
</P>
<P>
   People prided themselves on surviving its constricted
passageways and damp and drafty backstage areas. The playwright
Richard O'Brien remembered when a young director from a struggling
country theater saw the actress Coral Browne walking down the Royal
Court steps with a friend and asked her excitedly if she would star
in his next production. ``You see,'' she said, turning to her
friend, ``you work here and people think you'll work anywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   Ian Rickson, the current artistic director of the Royal Court,
said the renovating team wanted to preserve the love-hate
relationship. ``We knew we had to be respectful of our early
history without being precious about it,'' he said. He pointed
upward to the curving rim above the first balcony and made a face.
``There used to be cream-colored stucco there,'' he said through
the grimace, ``the kind of thing that some theater restorations go
in for, all prettified duck-egg blue and pink. You can't put the
dirty world that we put onstage into a place like that.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   In place of the unlamented stucco, the design team put nothing,
leaving exposed the riveted cast-iron plating they uncovered from
the original construction. It was an approach they used around the
building, letting the past of the theater catch up with the present
as a stripped-down narrative told through chipped bricks from
wartime bombing, patches of painted plaster from a one-time
executive suite, builders' wall scribblings, the ghostly traces of
steps from a vanished staircase and the grillwork windows from the
famously noisy old women's lavatory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The danger for the Royal Court was that the physical problems
would be solved with impeccable contemporary taste, but people
would still turn up and say, `It's got no soul, something's been
lost, everything difficult or anomalous or humane has been bleached
out by the forces of good design,''' Tompkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Rickson said they wanted to evoke the tension of being a radical
theater in a fashionable neighborhood. The theater is, in the end,
a place with royal in its name and rebellion on its stage. So
beneath the brawny steerage-class ironwork the renovators have
placed ribbed leather seats that would not look out of place in a
gentleman's club. ``Rough and ready with comfort,'' Rickson said.
</P>
<P>
   The seats are tan, the metalwork burgundy, and with the muted
lighting in the domed, narrow house, the atmosphere takes on a
shadowy sepia tone that suggests lurking mystery, maybe even
danger. The lack of ornamentation leaves sightlines uncluttered,
and the iron horseshoe along the edges of the balcony embraces
vision and propels it forward. The renovators seem to have never
forgotten they were building a theater.
</P>
<P>
   Walk about the place with the four principals in the
reconstruction _ Daldry, Rickson, Tompkins and Vikki Heywood, the
executive director _ and you find that they have become such a
seamless team that a thought that begins with one of them ends up
with another.
</P>
<P>
   Take the seats. Daldry said he was fond of running his nails
over the new leather to accelerate the breaking-in process. ``It
has to be knocked about a bit,'' he said. Tompkins said it needed
to mellow, like whiskey. He settled into one of the seats, with its
retractable armrests, to illustrate the cozy alignment with its
neighbors, and said it contributed to a communal spirit of
theatergoing. ``We don't want people to lean back because then you
become too disengaged with what's going on onstage,'' Rickson said.
</P>
<P>
   Daldry added, ``We don't want them to be snooze seats.''
</P>
<P>
   Rickson demonstrated how railings placed in front of the balcony
seats make audience members lean forward and become engaged.
</P>
<P>
   Heywood stepped forward when the conversation turned to
financing. The $43 million project benefited from a $30 million
grant from the National Lottery and a $5 million contribution from
the Jerwood Foundation, an arts-loving charity. ``Please remember
to call the theaters by their full names,'' she implored. The Royal
Court's two performance spaces are the Jerwood Upstairs Theater and
the Jerwood Downstairs Theater.
</P>
<P>
   The Jerwood money put the project over the top, but it caused a
ruckus last year in London's cultural salons when some of the Royal
Court playwrights objected to it as commercial intrusion.
</P>
<P>
   Rickson dismissed the complaints: ``It's more important what's
happening inside a theater than what it's called.''
</P>
<P>
   With nowhere to go on either side, the renovators came up with
the idea of building down, excavating from beneath the theater and
the eastern end of Sloane Square a sizable area housing a
restaurant, bars, a kitchen, bookshop and bathrooms. In their
unembroidered way, they call the cafe Food and Bar.
</P>
<P>
   The generous lobby windows and entrance give out onto the
square. A red drumwall by Antoni Malinowski forms the back of the
theater space and also links the two floors visually, dispatching a
vibrant, inviting signal out across the busy square. The smaller
upstairs theater is reached by a staircase that narrows
deliberately, Daldry said, to lend the impression of climbing into
an attic to hear a story.
</P>
<P>
   During the three years that its Chelsea headquarters was under
construction, the Royal Court's English Stage Co. kept busy,
putting on 40 plays at two theaters in the West End, the Duke of
York's and the New Ambassadors. The plays included Conor
McPherson's ``Weir,'' David Hare's ``Via Dolorosa,'' Martin
McDonagh's ``The Leenane Trilogy'' and Mark Ravenhill's ``Shopping
and ...'' For its reopening, the Royal Court is staging a new play
by McPherson called ``Dublin Carol,'' which started previews last
week.
</P>
<P>
   Opening night was supposed to have been Jan. 7, but the project
fell behind schedule. With everything else appearing to come out so
well, how did that happen?, Tompkins was asked over the sound of
last-minute sawing and hammering.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know what they say about builders,'' he said. ``They like
to build.''

`NOVA': DNA AS DETECTIVE AGAIN, BUT ON A BIBLICAL CASE 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds.: Broadcast notes are at end of review. Time, channel are for
New York area. Check local listings.) 
(ms) 
 By WALTER GOODMAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ To support their oral tradition that they are a lost
tribe of Israel, direct descendants of the biblical patriarchs, the
Lemba people of southern Africa point to tribal practices like
circumcision, the avoidance of pork, ritual slaughter techniques,
the wearing of prayer shawls and skullcaps and the ceremonial
blowing of the shofar or ram's horn. Now ``Nova'' reports in
Tuesday's intriguing hour that researchers are using genetic
markers to test whether there is anything to the Lembas' belief in
a Jewish heritage.
</P>
<P>
   The reasoning behind the new tests is fascinating. It begins
with the Old Testament's report that the family line of priests,
the cohanim, or Cohens, began with Aaron, the brother of Moses, and
that the role was transmitted down the generations from father to
son. As one of the scholars on the program says, when it comes to
the priestly line, ``The only thing that matters is your
heredity.''
</P>
<P>
   Thus began a search for similarities in the DNA (in particular
the Y chromosome, which is passed from father to son) between white
Jews named Cohen and the black priests of Lemba. Along the way the
program demonstrates how such an analysis is carried out.
</P>
<P>
   The findings were striking. A group of genetic markers, called
the Cohen Modal Haplotype and found in 10 percent of the general
population, was found in half of the Jewish Cohens. Turning to the
Lemba, researchers found a remarkably high frequency of the Cohen
chromosomes, much higher than in any non-Jewish group tested. In
one Lemba clan, the Buba, about half the men have the Cohen Y
chromosome type.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Tudor Parfitt, an anthropologist from London University who
has taken a leading role in this search, tracks down a somewhat
mysterious village called Sena, to which the Lemba trace their
origins. That leads him into speculation that the Lemba might have
been among the Yemenese Jews who migrated to Africa from the Middle
East perhaps a thousand years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Parfitt is convinced that he is on to something. Whether his
work will offer other clues to the origins of the Lemba or to the
fate of the myth-shrouded 10 lost tribes who were supposedly
expelled from Judea nearly 3,000 years ago remains far from
certain. But he doesn't seem about to give up.

IN THE WAR OF `ALL POLITICS, ALL THE TIME,' NBC IS HEAVILY ARMED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ ``Good morning, Ann. On this last day of
campaigning, Governor Bush awakes to some good news. Good morning,
Ann. On this last day of campaigning, Governor Bush awakes to some
encouraging news. Good morning, Ann...''
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, at 6:53 a.m., with 10 minutes to go before Ann Curry
of NBC's ``Today Show'' would introduce David Bloom's report
previewing South Carolina's Republican primary, Bloom, an NBC News
correspondent, was staring at a camera lens, rehearsing. A
spotlight illuminated the thin clouds of his breath as he repeated
the script he had written the night before, based on an NBC News
poll that showed Gov. George W. Bush of Texas as the solid
front-runner.
</P>
<P>
   Bloom's repetitions, heard in person by an audience of five
chilly spectators near the state Capitol dome, was an apt
distillation of what his employer would do with his work: present
it, with variations and updates, throughout the day and into the
night on the NBC broadcast network, on the MSNBC and CNBC cable
networks and even on the MSNBC.com Web site.
</P>
<P>
   As he followed Bush around the state, Bloom's image was
broadcast from Columbia to 6.4 million viewers of ``The Today
Show.'' From Clinton, he spoke live to about 150,000 MSNBC viewers
at 10 a.m. Reports from Greenville were heard by 11.3 million
viewers of ``The Nightly News'' at about 6:35 p.m., and by about
285,000 viewers of ``The News with Brian Williams'' on MSNBC a bit
after 9 p.m. Another 295,000 watched a repeat of Williams' program
at 10 p.m. on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   It was a typical campaign day for Bloom, who is 37 and a former
NBC White House correspondent. He has been covering the Republican
candidates since early summer. Like the days of countless campaign
correspondents, it was relentless. And like the days so familiar to
CNN's campaign reporters or those of The Associated Press, it was
punctuated with updates.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, with NBC News straddling both the broadcast and cable
news worlds, as well as the 24-hour-a-day Web, Bloom and his NBC
colleagues are finding their work spread before more viewers more
often than ever before. And there are signs that this
round-the-clock capability gives NBC News some advantages in
covering the primary campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   In the short run, Bloom said, the greater exposure helps his
reporting. Politics commands a fervent, if small, following among
cable viewers, many of them political professionals. ``They see us
reporting all through the day,'' Bloom said. ``So who are they
going to pick up the phone and call when they have news? They might
call CBS and ABC. But are they more likely to call us? Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   Longer term, the multiple platforms available to NBC News spread
Bloom's work _ and its costs _ over various network broadcasts, the
two cable networks and Web site.
</P>
<P>
   MSNBC, which makes heavy use of the coverage, picks up as much
as 35 percent of the total costs of political coverage, according
to an executive. Since MSNBC is a joint venture with Microsoft
Corp., that means if MSNBC runs a loss, Microsoft can pick up $5
million or more of a political budget that, the executive expects,
will exceed $28 million. If, as expected, MSNBC is profitable in
2000, then the cable channel could contribute its full share of $10
million or so.
</P>
<P>
   In effect, NBC, a unit of General Electric Co., is spending more
than it did in 1996, but paying less.
</P>
<P>
   Competing news organizations, particularly Walt Disney's ABC and
Time Warner's CNN, have also invested heavily in campaign coverage.
But their executives know very well how many satellite trucks,
camera crews, hotel rooms, correspondents and producers an extra $5
million could buy. In January, for example, ABC, CBS and the Fox
News cable channel said they had formed a ``news cooperative'' to
save money by sharing footage on breaking news events, like
campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   Eric Ober, who left the job of CBS News president shortly before
the 1996 birth of MSNBC and now oversees the creation of Web-based
material for E.W. Scripps, noted NBC's current advantage.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just gets clearer and clearer _ it's been known for some
time _ that a 24-hour news outlet is critical competitively,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It allows you to take care of your costs,'' he added. ``By
dint of having one-and-a-half cable channels on the air, with
politics or with any breaking story, you are on the air 24 hours.
''
</P>
<P>
   Bloom said his 24-hour outlets helped him get an exclusive last
Tuesday _that former Republican candidate Gary Bauer would endorse
Bush's main challenger, Sen. John McCain of Arizona. (The
endorsement did little for the Arizona senator, who lost the South
Carolina primary, 53 percent to 42 percent.)
</P>
<P>
   After a McCain campaign official confirmed the Bauer move at
9:30 a.m. on Tuesday, Bloom said, ``I called MSNBC and 30 seconds
later they were on the air.'' Just minutes after that, his report
was on the MSNBC.com site.
</P>
<P>
   The currency of Bauer's endorsement was perishable _ a news
conference was scheduled at noon. Otherwise, Bloom said, ``If I
have a piece of news that I think can hold until the Nightly News
and is not earth-shattering, I will hold it till Nightly, because
that is the broadcast of record.''
</P>
<P>
   Elections have long been a proving ground for network news
divisions and have been a centerpiece of CNN's coverage since its
inception in 1980. Astute political coverage helped make the
reputations of correspondents and anchors like ABC's Peter Jennings
and Cokie Roberts; CBS' Dan Rather and Bob Schieffer; CNN's Jeff
Greenfield and Judy Woodruff, and NBC's own Tom Brokaw and Tim
Russert.
</P>
<P>
   But, Ober and others cautioned, it is important not
automatically to equate quantity with quality.
</P>
<P>
   NBC ``is certainly doing well with volume,'' Ober said. ``But
the differentiators are going to be the Schieffers and Brokaws and
Rathers and Greenfields. It's not just about bulk. It's about
information and the interpretation of the information.''

 UNDATED: the information.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Certainly CNN, which pioneered bulk political coverage, is
devoting considerable resources to the primaries. In the last days
of the South Carolina and New Hampshire primaries, CNN matched NBC
in staffing, sending roughly 50 people to South Carolina and 200 to
New Hampshire. Christa Robinson, a CNN spokeswoman, maintained that
``we basically were the leader in creating the niche'' of cable
political coverage.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, when the CNN host Larry King moderated a Feb. 15
Republican debate, it drew 2.3 million households, a huge audience
for cable.
</P>
<P>
   Among cable channels, CNN does have an advantage in reach, since
it is available to 77 percent of the nation's 100 million
television households. MSNBC, by comparison, is carried in 54
million households, and Fox, owned by News Corp., on cable, is in
45 million.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the Fox News Channel's New Hampshire primetime coverage drew
372,000 households, 70 percent more than MSNBC's 220,000
households. (A spokesman for MSNBC noted that it outdrew Fox among
viewers between 25 and 54 years old, the group advertisers covet.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, NBC News has something no cable rival can match _ a
broadcast network with a news division. When NBC's Tim Russert
interviewed Bush on the Sunday broadcast program ``Meet The Press''
Feb. 13, 4.6 million people watched. And Brokaw's evening news
broadcast on NBC regularly gives prominence to political news.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, ABC, which collaborates with The New York Times on
Web-based political coverage, tends to make political reports on
the evening newscast as visible as NBC's. But without a cable
outlet, ABC is hard put to match the volume of NBC's coverage,
though it can offer depth with respected programs like Ted Koppel's
``Nightline.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The strength of the Bush victory Saturday in South Carolina
raises questions about how much longer the primary campaign
coverage will have an engaged audience. Thus far, NBC shows no sign
of retreating on its coverage commitments, or scaling back its
efforts to make MSNBC a real threat to CNN. And on Saturday night,
Brokaw and Russert were prominently featured on NBC's cable
programs.
</P>
<P>
   The risk, MSNBC executives acknowledge, is that the extensive
commitment to political coverage tends to lead cable channels to
inflate marginal events, simply to fill their many politically
oriented shows. On any given day, Bloom may appear on ``Imus in the
Morning'' or Andrea Mitchell's ``Decision 2000'' or Chris Matthews'
``Hardball,'' all on MSNBC, or ``Rivera Live'' on CNBC.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're always juggling'' with worries over inflating news'
importance, the better to fill the maw of a 24-hour channel, Erik
Sorenson, MSNBC's vice president and general manager, said. But, he
added: ``We're not a headline service. We're a big-story service, a
documentary service. We just made the decision to open up the
programming spigot.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, the primary race has real suspense, he said. ``And in
the cable news world, suspense is everything.''

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BANGKOK, Thailand _ In the world of transportation, there are
few brand names to match that of the Ho Chi Minh Trail, the secret,
shifting, piecemeal network of jungle roadways that helped the
North win the Vietnam War.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the trail has been consumed by the forest in the 25
years since the war ended, but its myth is still there. Indeed, it
seems to have seduced Vietnam's planners into a project that some
outsiders say they find unrealistic and misguided.
</P>
<P>
   The government announced last Friday that it planned to turn the
faint remnants of the old trail into an honest-to-goodness highway
that would link the north and the south for peaceful commerce, as
it once did for wartime supply and transport.
</P>
<P>
   According to an announcement from Hanoi _ wartime capital of the
communist North and peacetime capital of a unified communist
Vietnam _ the 1,000-mile, $678.6 million project is to be completed
in just three years.
</P>
<P>
   If they transported artillery pieces along it, the reasoning
seems to be, they can mobilize to lay asphalt at a record pace.
</P>
<P>
   An expert on Vietnam at Harvard University, Tom Vallely, was
skeptical. He called a paved road through the country's western
mountains ``something they don't need.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a misallocation of funds,'' said Vallely, director of
the Vietnam program at the Harvard Institute of International
Development. ``You are supposed to invest in things you need, not
in things you don't need. And you are supposed to invest in them in
a timely way. They already have a north-south highway, and there is
not a lot of traffic on it.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``I don't think they'll do it. I can't imagine they'll
do it. I don't think any international donor would touch it.''
</P>
<P>
   The government envisions a two-lane road to supplement the
current coastal route, Highway 1, with an eventual expansion of the
mountain road to six busy high-speed lanes.
</P>
<P>
   It is easy to see the attraction of the idea.
</P>
<P>
   The Ho Chi Minh trail has been the stuff of legend for both
America and Vietnam since it confounded the U.S. military and led
to a secret border-crossing bombing campaign that helped draw
Cambodia further into the war.
</P>
<P>
   Begun in 1959 as a hidden trail through the jungle, it expanded
over the years into a network of five main routes, portions of them
paved, that dipped here and there into neighboring Laos and
Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
   For both sides, the trail symbolized the determination and
ingenuity of the North and the overmuscled inability of America's
war machine to cope with small-bore guerrilla tactics.
</P>
<P>
   At one point near the end of the war, for example, frustrated
American commanders ordered that in certain intractable hostile
areas, any gatherings observed from the air of more than a handful
of people would be attacked with strikes by B-52's _ the war's big
guns, with a knockout punch capable of leveling an area the size of
several football fields.
</P>
<P>
   But no amount of bombing or the use of high-tech sensory devices
was able to slow for long the antlike traffic of men, women, trucks
and bicycles that allowed the North to pursue the war in the South.
</P>
<P>
   As the stuff of legend, the Ho Chi Minh trail has continued to
inspire Vietnam, a nation that has not been able to show its people
many heroic achievements since the war ended.
</P>
<P>
   For a time a few years ago there was a notion _ some called it
harebrained _ to exploit the trail as a tourist attraction.
According to the plan, ``rich visitors'' would be ferried in by
helicopter and housed in old bunkers converted into
``mini-resorts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Visitors would be provided with the old-time uniforms, hats
and walking sticks of the troops, which will remind them or help
them to imagine how it was for people and soldiers during the
war,'' said the plan's promoter, an architect named Hoang Phuc
Thang.
</P>
<P>
   In its way, Vallely said, the road-building plan seems almost as
misguided.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would take resources from things they need, like education
or science or building urban infrastructure or getting successful
provinces more ports,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the idea of integrating is good _ access roads,
electricity, the Internet. There are all sorts of ways to get the
country connected better and cheaper than this.
</P>
<P>
   In the former Saigon _ which now also bears the name of
Vietnam's wartime leader, Ho Chi Minh _ coffee table books are for
sale with propaganda photographs of the famous trail.
</P>
<P>
   Though much of it has disappeared now, its essence is alive in
these pictures: singing, optimistic soldiers _ men and women _ with
bouquets of camouflage leaves on their pith helmets; determined
patriotic fighters heaving heavy machinery through ravines and
across streams, and of course the famous Peugeot bicycles,
overladen like beasts of burden with more supplies than the laws of
physics would ever approve.
</P>
<P>
   But of course, the miracle of the Ho Chi Minh trail was that it
accomplished the impossible. If the Vietnamese had listened to
experts at Harvard, they would have given up without a fight.
</P>
<P>
   So who knows?

MAJOR AUCTION HOUSES FACE ANTITRUST LAWSUITS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By LESLIE EATON and CAROL VOGEL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In the art world Herbert Black is known as a man who
loves paintings and antiques and loathes the auction houses where
he buys and sells them. Suddenly he has a lot of company.
</P>
<P>
   Black, a copper trader from Montreal, is suing the two major
art-auction houses, Sotheby's and Christie's. So is a
philanthropist who endowed an Arizona art museum. And a New York
businesswoman once known as the Tugboat Empress. And a Minnesota
art gallery. And a Florida retiree. And about three dozen other
people, some of whom may have simply bought a wristwatch or sold a
great aunt's antique commode.
</P>
<P>
   All of these disgruntled customers contend that they were
overcharged because of collusion by the two rival auction houses,
and they are basing their suits in a criminal antitrust
investigation being conducted by the U.S. Justice Department.
</P>
<P>
   As part of that process a federal grand jury in Manhattan is
looking into whether the auction houses conspired to fix the
commissions they charged buyers and sellers at auctions dating as
far back as 1992, said people in the art and legal worlds who are
involved in the matter.
</P>
<P>
   The fallout is likely to be not just embarrassing but also
expensive for Sotheby's and Christie's, which could end up paying
their irate clients tens of millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Some in the art world worry that publicity from the antitrust
case will shake the public's confidence at a time when the art
market has been booming. ``For a lot of people to whom the art
world is hype anyway, does it increase their fears and cynicism?''
wondered Angela Westwater, a dealer in contemporary art in SoHo.
</P>
<P>
   For Sotheby's, the outcome could be even more dire. The company
faces steep fines, and its top executives face short prison terms,
if the Justice Department's investigation results in criminal
charges.
</P>
<P>
   That prospect became more likely last month, when Christie's
announced that in return for immunity from criminal prosecution, it
was cooperating with the investigation and turning over information
to the Justice Department. The announcement suggests that
Christie's has admitted wrongdoing; it leaves Sotheby's at risk
because prosecutors offer amnesty only to the first member of a
cartel to spill the beans.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has not commented on the investigation, except to say
that it was cooperating with prosecutors; nor has it responded to
the allegations of price-fixing.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's stock price has plunged from its high, last spring, of
$47 to $17} on Friday. Ron Baron, president of Baron Capital
Management, by far the largest outside shareholder in Sotheby's,
described himself as ``surprised, puzzled and disappointed'' at the
antitrust news, though he said he was confident that the outcome
would not be financially significant.
</P>
<P>
   Christie's, which was bought by a French businessman for over $1
billion in 1998, is now a private company and is no longer
obligated to report its financial results publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Both companies, which control about 95 per cent of the $4
billion worldwide auction market, will have to cope with the
lawsuits by disgruntled customers. If the plaintiffs win, they can
recover three times the damages they suffered. The losses could
come at a bad time. Both auction houses have just spent huge sums
on snazzy headquarters, and Sotheby's is pouring millions of
dollars into an Internet auction business.
</P>
<P>
   The investigation could also result in increased governmental
regulation. The New York City Department of Consumer Affairs, which
regulates auctioneers, is ``following the antitrust action
closely,'' said Jules Polonetsky, commissioner of the department.
Moreover, the art dealers fear that increasing the number of
regulations in the auction business could have a negative effect on
the entire art trade.
</P>
<P>
   Many in the insular art world are riveted by the drama and are
waiting for Sotheby's next move. Some dealers and collectors, who
generally have a love-hate relationship with the two big houses,
seem to be privately both aghast and slightly gleeful at their
problems.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers, too, are watching with interest as a patient and
painstaking federal prosecutor named John J. Greene deals with some
of the most experienced, expensive and aggressive defense lawyers
in the country (Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher &AMP; Flom for
Christie's, and Weil, Gotshal &AMP; Manges for Sotheby's).
</P>
<P>
   The investigation comes at a time when the art-auction business
seems finally to have recovered from the deep recession that
followed the frenzied art sales of the late 1980s. After a drop in
revenues, the auction houses began raising the fees they charge
customers, by exactly the same amount.
</P>
<P>
   In 1992 Sotheby's announced it was increasing the commission
that buyers pay to 15 percent of the purchase price on the first
$50,000 and 10 percent on the rest. (Before that, there was just a
flat 10 percent fee.)
</P>
<P>
   Christie's soon announced the same price increase.
</P>
<P>
   That behavior raised eyebrows in the art world. But the simple
fact that two competitors charge the same price is not enough to
prove that they have done something illegal, antitrust lawyers say.
After all, grocery stores and gas stations match each other's
prices all the time, and banks all charge the same prime rate.
</P>
<P>
   ``There has to be a meeting of the minds, a conscious commitment
to a common scheme,'' said Robert H. Lande, senior research scholar
at the American Antitrust Institute.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, another tough year in the auction business, the pattern
of price increases was repeated, this time on the commissions that
Sotheby's and Christie's charge sellers. Within six weeks of each
other, the two announced a sliding scale that would apply to all
sellers; previously, the two had officially charged fixed
commissions but had often cut them to woo big sellers.
</P>
<P>
   Not anymore, or so some disgruntled customers contend. ``Once
they instituted that elaborate sliding scale, there was no
negotiation unless maybe for the Onassis estate,'' said Jeffrey A.
Klafter, a lawyer representing customers in some of the 40-odd
class-action cases that have been filed in the last month.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Financially, the price changes worked out well for the houses.
In 1996 the amount of art sold at auction at Sotheby's edged down
by almost 4 percent, but its revenues from auctions rose 7 percent.
</P>
<P>
   By that time Greene was already taking a close look at the art
world. He had brought several cases against antiques dealers who
secretly agreed not to bid against one another at auctions.
</P>
<P>
   In the spring of 1997 both the auction houses and a dozen top
art dealers were subpoenaed for truckloads of documents, including
datebooks, Rolodexes and correspondence. Though the main focus
seemed to be on dealers, some lawyers suggested that the Justice
Department was also looking at the commission increases.
</P>
<P>
   Then silence. Lawyers for several of the dealers who received
subpoenas said recently that their clients had not heard from
prosecutors for a long time, suggesting that the investigation
might have stalled or that prosecutors began focusing only on the
auction houses.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile things were changing at Christie's. Francois Pinault,
the French investor who bought the auction house in 1998, installed
a team of accountants to comb through its books and records. He
also began shaking up Christie's management.
</P>
<P>
   On Christmas Eve last year Christie's announced the resignation
of Christopher M. Davidge, who had been the auction house's chief
executive for many years. Davidge's lawyer, Joseph Linklater,
declined to comment on his client's departure from Christie's.
</P>
<P>
   One month later Christie's said it ``recently became aware of
information relevant to the antitrust investigation,'' and had
turned this over to the Justice Department. Christie's added that
it had entered the department's amnesty program, which allows
companies to turn themselves in for antitrust violations in return
for leniency or immunity from criminal prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   The European Union then announced that it too was investigating
Sotheby's and Christie's for anti-competitive behavior.
</P>
<P>
   Why would a company confess to a crime that might otherwise seem
difficult to prove? The answer, antitrust lawyers said, is simple:
the threat of prison time and huge fines.
</P>
<P>
   Of course the innocent can always be acquitted, and criminal
antitrust cases are notoriously difficult to prove. The government
has lost some big cases but recently has had some major victories.
</P>
<P>
   A trial is a risk, especially for someone against whom there is
tangible evidence. So rather than recommending that their clients
try to tough it out, lawyers now often tell them to cooperate with
prosecutors _ before someone else does. ``There's a foot race to
the prosecutors,'' said Stephen M. Axinn, a specialist in antitrust
defense.
</P>
<P>
   It is not enough just to turn state's evidence, antitrust
lawyers said. For the courts to recognize that a conspiracy has
ended, the conspirator must make an open, public break with the
cartel agreement.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this month Christie's unilaterally changed the
commissions it charges both buyers and sellers. The new rates
increase the amount buyers must pay, to 17.5 percent, and reduce
the sellers' commissions for those who do a lot of business with
the auction house.
</P>
<P>
   Sotheby's has not responded, and the art world is abuzz.
Christie's new rate schedule makes it much more attractive to
sellers, just at the time when the auction houses are trying to
line up things to sell at their big spring auctions.
</P>
<P>
   Then there is the broader question of what Sotheby's will do
about the antitrust investigation. Some lawyers said that the
auction house would reach a settlement with the government, rather
than go to trial. ``There's no possible benefit, in terms of the
art world, in having all this ugly stuff in the newspaper every
day,'' said Axinn, the defense expert.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the outcome of the criminal case, both Sotheby's and
Christie's will have to cope with the hordes of disgruntled
customers. Thirty-eight class-action lawsuits were filed in
Manhattan as of Feb. 14, said Robert A. Skirnick, an antitrust
lawyer representing some of the plaintiffs. Others have been filed
in other states, and Sotheby's shareholders have also sued.
</P>
<P>
   Judge Lewis Kaplan, a federal judge in Manhattan, has scheduled
a hearing for Wednesday to begin consolidating the lawsuits brought
by the auction houses' customers.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these people, like Black, the copper trader, may have
had longstanding disagreements with the auction houses; last year
Sotheby's admitted that a pair of antique chairs for which he paid
about $2.7 million were, in fact, recent reproductions.
</P>
<P>
   But others were simply shocked when they learned of the
antitrust investigation. One is Gerard Cafesjian, a retired
executive with a large collection of works in 20th-century glass,
whose name is on the new home of the Scottsdale Museum of
Contemporary Art in Arizona. ``I don't think he had any inkling
until the first article came out,'' said Richard A. Lockridge, a
lawyer for Cafesjian. ``He was not very happy with the
allegations.''
</P>
<P>
   Civil suits like these are common in the wake of a criminal
antitrust investigation, class-action lawyers said. But plaintiffs
in these cases are not just any old consumers. They are richer _
and probably tougher.
</P>
<P>
   Take Evelyn Frank, whose family for many years ran a
controversial maritime business in New York and New Jersey. Frank,
who was known both as the Tugboat Empress and as the Dragon Lady,
pleaded guilty in 1990 to charges that her company illegally dumped
tons of sludge into the waters of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   The unusual makeup of the plaintiffs _ angry rich people _
should come as no surprise, said Joseph J. Tabacco, one of the
lawyers involved in the suits against Sotheby's and Christie's.
After all, he said, ``The zone of greatest impact is probably up
and down Park Avenue.''

<P>
   SAKU, Japan _ The air is remarkably crisp in this town at the
edge of Japan's ski country. The streets are uncluttered with
traffic. And unlike in high-decibel Tokyo, the prevailing sound
here is that of silence.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of its appearance as a haven of tranquillity, only
heightened on this day by a fresh dusting of snow, this city of
60,000 stands on the front lines of a stress-related condition that
is quietly ravaging Japan.
</P>
<P>
   When the Japanese government announced this week that one-third
of the working-age population was suffering from chronic fatigue,
few stress-haunted denizens of Tokyo, with its heavy overcrowding,
unrelenting pace and impersonal nature, could have been taken
aback.
</P>
<P>
   What is far more surprising is that quiet little towns like
these are being hit every bit as hard by a poorly understood
condition that leaves many of its victims incapacitated for months
or years on end.
</P>
<P>
   In the hulking, modern general hospital at town's edge, 32
percent of the patients hospitalized in the internal
medicine/psychology ward are being treated for chronic fatigue
syndrome, a diagnosis that is made only after six months of severe,
continuous fatigue in the absence of any known organic illness.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them, indeed, are immediately recognizable by the heavy
air of weariness that surrounds them as they slump in their seats,
waiting to see their doctors in the ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not even get up from my chair before my treatment,''
said Hiroaki Sugihara, 36, who was hospitalized here for three
months recently. ``I was too tired to walk, and it was very
difficult for me to get around, even in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   With treatments of anti-depressants, biofeedback and counseling,
Sugihara has found his life slowly edging toward normality since,
although he says he still lacks stamina. ``Of course I would like
to become energetic again, but I don't think I will ever be able to
work as hard,'' he said. ``I just want to be healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sugihara's condition may have been related to the overwork that
he said he once commonly engaged in as a free-lance computer
programmer. Indeed, during Japan's boom years, in the 1970s and
1980s, as many as 10,000 people were believed to die annually from
``karoshi,'' or overwork.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors here say that the explosion of chronic tiredness and
of chronic fatigue syndrome in particular is a distinctly post-boom
phenomenon. More complex than simple overwork, they say, it is
increasingly associated with the stresses placed on this society
since it began its dramatic economic slide more than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention says the syndrome affects perhaps 4 to 8 percent of the
population over 18. Its symptoms, which include weakness, profound
lassitude, difficulty concentrating, insomnia and often low-grade
fever, remain equally unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   But in Japan, where the condition appears to be far more
prevalent, experts are leaning toward explanations that emphasize
societal mutations far more than their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of patients like these is on the increase,'' said
Dr. Toshiho Iida, a specialist in treating chronic fatigue syndrome
patients at the hospital. ``As for the causes, they are many, but
we think they have to do with the changes in Japanese society which
have been accelerating in the last five or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes range from eating habits, environmental problems,
housing, and in many other things too. In the urban areas, for
example, people no longer know who lives next door to them anymore,
and that produces stress.''
</P>
<P>
   During Japan's economic downturn, many businessmen and workers
have taken their change of fortune personally. Struggling against
huge debts, many have found themselves working harder and harder to
meet their commitments and maintain their living standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is stress, part of it is depression-related, part
of it may be caused by infection, and part of it is certainly
overwork, because overwork is still rampant in Japan,'' said Dr.
Masumi Minowa, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of
Public Health, whose recent random study of 4,000 people found that
35 percent had experienced chronic fatigue for at least six months.
</P>
<P>
   Among the social factors that therapists and researchers are
pointing to as potential contributing factors are family
relationships, which are under great strain.
</P>
<P>
   Grown children, with few job prospects are slower to leave the
home. With a fast-aging population, more aged parents, too, must be
cared for. And rather than committing themselves to the rat race
their parents have known, many younger children are opting for
unconventional lifestyles that involve far more attention to
enjoymentr less emphasis on hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Satoe Yamada, 24, a rail-thin worker at a photo lab, described
her condition, which led to rapid weight loss, and left her with
pronounced bags under her eyes, as an onslaught of stress. Bit by
bit, feeling exhausted by her contacts with others, she said she
began to withdraw. Then, when she switched to a new job, where she
was asked to work long hours, her bout began with chronic fatigue
syndrome _ a condition she had never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were various problems at home,'' she said, not wishing
to explain further. ``I was feeling stress from my family and
friends. And I had a new job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sleep even when I wanted to sleep. And the food I
ate didn't seem to nourish me. I lost 10 pounds in two weeks.''

BRAZIL COLLIDES WITH IMF OVER A PLAN TO AID THE POOR 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By LARRY ROHTER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   RIO DE JANEIRO, Brazil _ A new Brazilian government plan to
spend more than $22 billion on social programs in the next decade
has led to a squabble with the International Monetary Fund, which
argues the money should be used to reduce Brazil's indebtedness
rather than to fight poverty.
</P>
<P>
   The unusually public dispute has added to the unpopularity here
of the IMF, which in the past has been accused of provoking
recession in Brazil and trampling on the country's sovereignty. It
has also given President Fernando Henrique Cardoso badly needed
political help, forcing opposition parties to line up behind him
and potentially strengthening his hand in continuing talks with an
IMF now more leery than ever of being seen as heartless.
</P>
<P>
   Brazil and the IMF reached agreement in November 1998 on an
emergency three-year $41.5 billion rescue package, the terms of
which were modified early last year after Cardoso was forced to
allow the national currency, the real, to be devalued by 40
percent. The accord calls for the Brazilian government to cut
spending and raise taxes, and sets targets and timetables for
actions like reducing public sector debt and selling state-owned
companies.
</P>
<P>
   But nationwide municipal elections are scheduled for October,
with the presidential and legislative races to follow in 2002, and
the government coalition is eager to offer voters something more
than continued austerity. In addition, Cardoso promised in his 1998
campaign that if elected to a second term, he would take steps to
lessen the country's chronically skewed income distribution and
other social inequalities.
</P>
<P>
   Though living conditions for the poor improved in the 1990s,
economists calculate that at least half the work force in this
nation of 165 million still earns the minimum wage of $77 a month
or, in the case of millions working off the books, even less.
According to government statistics, the poorest 10 percent of the
population accounts for only 1 percent of national income, while
the richest 10 percent receives nearly half.
</P>
<P>
   As presented to Congress, the government's plan calls for at
least $2.25 billion a year over the next 10 years to be funneled
into a Fund to Combat and Eradicate Poverty for additional spending
on things like education, health and infrastructure. Minister of
Finance Pedro Malan maintains that money gained from privatization
and new luxury taxes will enable Brazil to finance the program
without deviating from the IMF agreement.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview with the Brazilian news magazine Veja last
month, before the dispute erupted, the United States secretary of
the treasury, Lawrence Summers, said that the government here ``in
the long term, needs to invest massively in the Brazilian people,''
citing education as a top priority. But in an interview last week
with the Dow Jones news service, the IMF representative in
Brasilia, Lorenzo Perez, said the government plan ``established a
precedent that could become dangerous.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Brazil already spends a significant amount of money on social
programs,'' he said. ``This money has to be used more
effectively.''
</P>
<P>
   The Brazilian reaction was sharp and immediate, with the
government and the opposition demonstrating a rare unity. Leaders
of the leftist Workers Party called for Perez's expulsion, while
Malan said ``the allocation of budgetary resources has never been a
theme of discussion with the IMF and is not within its area of
competence.''
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Perez reversed course, saying that after further
study of the plan, ``I don't think its implementation would involve
macroeconomic risks.''
</P>
<P>
   That appeared to be the end of the matter. But on Feb. 13, the
departing managing director of the IMF, Michel Camdessus, left
Brazilian officials seething anew over remarks he made at a United
Nations trade conference in Bangkok, apparently unaware that Perez
had retracted his original criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   ``We in the IMF believe that what is important in the strategy
of a country is not to get rid of the problems of the poor by doing
some charity from time to time,'' he said. ``What we see as more
important is to make room in the budget of the government and of
the states for increased social spending on a permanent basis.''

 PRAGUE: hold it.  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Belgrade helps to organize the Serbian resistance in
Mitrovica. And as soon as Serb leaders in Kosovo began to talk
seriously about joining the U.N. administrator Bernard Kouchner and
Albanian politicians on an executive council for Kosovo, Mitrovica
exploded. At least 11 people died, most of them Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   However manipulated, it is also true that this round of violence
began with an attack on a U.N. bus ferrying Serbs and guarded front
and back by KFOR, followed by a bombing in a Serbian cafe in
Mitrovica. The attacks set off the exact results desired by
extremists on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's successor, Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, has given KFOR more
police duties and has used the violence to add German, Italian and
British forces to the French. More attention is being paid to the
fomenting of violence by Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But military fatigue is becoming obvious. Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, complained to Congress last
week that KFOR is ``marking time'' waiting for the civilians to
catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner has found words to describe the Kosovo dilemma: ``Give
security a chance, then we'll give peace a chance. Eventually,
we'll give reconciliation a chance.'' That's a far cry from the
lofty goals of the West when it entered Kosovo eight months ago.
And it means Western troops will be there for a very long time to
come.

 PRAGUE: hold it.

   Meanwhile, Belgrade helps to organize the Serbian resistance in
Mitrovica. And as soon as Serb leaders in Kosovo began to talk
seriously about joining the U.N. administrator Bernard Kouchner and
Albanian politicians on an executive council for Kosovo, Mitrovica
exploded. At least 11 people died, most of them Albanian.
</P>
<P>
   However manipulated, it is also true that this round of violence
began with an attack on a U.N. bus ferrying Serbs and guarded front
and back by KFOR, followed by a bombing in a Serbian cafe in
Mitrovica. The attacks set off the exact results desired by
extremists on both sides.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson's successor, Gen. Klaus Reinhardt, has given KFOR more
police duties and has used the violence to add German, Italian and
British forces to the French. More attention is being paid to the
fomenting of violence by Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   But military fatigue is becoming obvious. Gen. Henry Shelton,
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, complained to Congress last
week that KFOR is ``marking time'' waiting for the civilians to
catch up.
</P>
<P>
   Kouchner has found words to describe the Kosovo dilemma: ``Give
security a chance, then we'll give peace a chance. Eventually,
we'll give reconciliation a chance.'' That's a far cry from the
lofty goals of the West when it entered Kosovo eight months ago.
And it means Western troops will be there for a very long time to
come.

<P>
   WASHINGTON - The Rev. Jesse Jackson on Sunday said that if
Africans and African Americans work together they can help each
other to prosper.
</P>
<P>
   Jackson, who was addressing the National Summit on Africa here
on the final day of a five-day conference said ``Both sets of
Africans on both sides of the Atlantic need each other.'' The goal
of the conference is to educate Americans about Africa and boost
commercial ties between the United States and the continent,
</P>
<P>
   Citing the end of colonialism, Jackson reminded his audience,
``We are winners. Without dropping a bomb, we beat France, we beat
Britain and we beat Portugal.''
</P>
<P>
   Jackson also echoed the words of many of the summit's speakers,
saying that America needs to do more to slow the AIDS epidemic in
Africa, which has killed nearly 13 million people on the vast
continent.
</P>
<P>
   America must also strengthen economic ties with African nations,
Jackson added.
</P>
<P>
   Just before Jackson spoke, the 2,300 delegates at the conference
unanimously passed a 254 point ``plan of action'' that among other
things asks for an increase funding for AIDS research, education
and prevention in Africa and the United States support of a ban on
land mines and the sale of small arms.
</P>
<P>
   It also calls for passage of the Africa Growth and Opportunity
act which was introduced in the U.S. Congress two years ago and
would among other things cut tariffs on African clothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time in history we have inherited something we
can call a plan,'' said Dr. Mildred McClain, co-chair of the
state-wide Georgia delegation to the summit. ``It will be an
important template for the next decade as we look at U.S.-Africa
relations.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a strong plan, it's a good plan, it's not a perfect plan,
but it's an excellent start,'' added the Savannah resident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever you want to do is in that document. That's the beauty
of the plan,'' said Earl Shinhoster, chairman of the Georgia
delegation and an Atlanta resident.
</P>
<P>
   Although the participants were impressed with the outcome of the
summit, several said they were concerned the event attracted few
young people.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was so disappointed that we did not have enough student
delegates,'' especially since Howard University is right in the
Summit's back yard, said McClain, who brought three students along
with her delegation.
</P>
<P>
   She said young African Americans' involvement in the planning
and attendance of the summit would have served as a bridge to
improving relations with Africa.

ISRAEL SEEN AS PARADISE FOR MONEY LAUNDERING
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By WILLIAM A. ORME Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Summoned to a downtown bank last month, the police
arrested a woman who they suspected was laundering profits for
foreign racketeers. A native of Chechnya, she had reportedly tried
to open an Israeli account with $50 million in Venezuelan checks in
the name of an apparently fictitious Gibraltar investment firm.
</P>
<P>
   If so, it would not have been the first time Israel had
attracted professional money scrubbers.
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, the authorities have been asked to investigate
cash transfers linked to a $340-million insider-trading deal
involving a Russian telecommunications company and to the huge
money laundering scandal involving the Bank of New York. Last
summer, the conviction of an Israeli crime boss in Miami for
running a money laundering business for the cartel in Cali,
Colombia, prompted renewed concern about the recycling of cocaine
money here.
</P>
<P>
   But the police and prosecutors here face an almost
insurmountable problem: Money laundering is not a crime in Israel.
</P>
<P>
   Although that may be about to change, right now Israel does not
make it illegal to bank or spend the proceeds of illicit offshore
enterprises. As a nation founded as a safe haven for Jews, there is
a longstanding tradition of welcoming immigrants and their assets.
Banks and brokerages are not obligated to verify the provenance of
a customer's investment funds. Reporting requirements for new
accounts are minimal, as are the penalties for a failure to comply
with those rules.
</P>
<P>
   ``Israel is a paradise for money laundering, because it is not
against the law,'' said Cmdr. Yossi Sedbon, head of the
investigative division of Israel's national police. ``I don't know
if it is really that big a business here. But millions come in and
go out, and you can't do anything about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Many families here fled nations that prohibited them from
expatriating their money; those who managed to circumvent such
restrictions were applauded, not interrogated. Immigrants from the
former Soviet Union brought an estimated $2.5 billion to Israel in
the 1990s, much of it from foreign accounts their home countries
had restricted. Israel was not about to enforce Soviet-era capital
controls or question the legality of those transfers.
</P>
<P>
   But those policies have been systematically exploited by
sophisticated international criminal networks, the authorities here
say.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want to get an Israeli passport and then go all over
the world, it is very easy,'' Sedbon said. ``You need a Jewish
mother, but if you don't have one, you can create one.''
</P>
<P>
   Informed estimates of money laundering by organized crime groups
here in the last decade range from the hundreds of millions of
dollars to the billions, with income from foreign tax evasion and
business kickbacks increasing the figures.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the authorities could prove that funds transferred here
were the fruit of fraud or theft or narcotics sales, they could not
_ as is often done in the United States and Europe _ seize the
money or property bought with it. To prosecute, they must
demonstrate that crimes were also committed in Israel. Even then,
the money is usually off limits except for the payment of
penalties.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding law enforcement difficulties are Israel's strict
secrecy laws on local bank accounts. Restrictions on accounts
abroad, meanwhile, have been largely abolished. Israelis are no
longer required to report offshore deposits of less than $5
million, and new immigrants need not report any foreign holdings.
Millions can be wired from a citizen's foreign account to a local
bank without facing any special reporting requirements.
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, Israel signed an international convention in Vienna
banning drug money laundering, but it could not be ratified in
parliament because Israeli law was not in compliance with the
treaty.
</P>
<P>
   Since then, a few legislators and Justice Ministry professionals
have pushed unsuccessfully to make money laundering a crime.
</P>
<P>
   Russian immigrant leaders have complained that their people felt
unfairly targeted. The politically powerful banks fought
regulation, and advocates of continuing Jewish immigration worried
that stringent financial reporting might discourage others.
</P>
<P>
   Now, however, legislators say chances are good that a bill will
pass this year.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are trying to resolve the conflicts of interest involved _
the right of the police to investigate, and the right of the
citizen to privacy,'' said Tsipi Livni, a member of the opposition
Likud Party who heads the committee writing the anti-laundering
bill. ``But I am very concerned. When the chief of police speaks
about billions, I think it is a problem.''
</P>
<P>
   As drafted, the legislation would adopt American-style reporting
requirements for most banking and stock market transactions, as
well as procedures for confiscating assets and prosecuting bankers.
</P>
<P>
   But foreign tax evasion would not be considered a crime, Livni
said.
</P>
<P>
   Nor would the legislation impose the reporting requirements on
Israel's $5 billion-a-year diamond trade, conducted traditionally
on the basis of cash and handshakes.
</P>
<P>
   Those omissions worry some. ``Israel is facing a problem of
organized crime and probably, though I don't have evidence of it,
of links between organized crime and the diamond industry,'' said
Patrick Moulette, who heads an anti-laundering task force for the
29-nation Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development,
based in Paris.
</P>
<P>
   Officials at Israel's Diamond Exchange vigorously deny that
their business has been exploited by money laundering gangs, even
though some local organized crime figures _ including Eli Tisona,
the convicted Florida investment counselor for Colombia's drug
lords _ have also been prominent gem dealers.
</P>
<P>
   But the decision not to penalize foreign tax infractions may
prove more significant. Most of the dirty money washed clean by
Israeli banks stems not from narcotics or protection rackets, but
from off-the-books business deals, said Menachem Amir, a
criminologist at Hebrew University. ``It is black money, but is
mostly income tax evasion, not drug money,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   In recent months, several figures implicated in the Bank of New
York money laundering scandal and in a web of obscure financial
institutions abroad have been found to hold Israeli passports and
to maintain homes here, although they reside and operate in Russia
or Europe.
</P>
<P>
   Sedbon says he believes that some fraction of the money siphoned
out of Moscow ended up in Israel. But he says it is difficult to
quantify.
</P>
<P>
   After the collapse of the Soviet Union and the emigration of
most Jews from the Islamic Middle East and North Africa, Israel can
now afford to tighten financial rules for immigrants, Amir says.
</P>
<P>
   But there is still resistance. Two years ago, Gregory Lerner, an
immigrant businessman, acknowledged in court that he had defrauded
Russian banks of $48 million and used the money to try to start a
bank here. He was fined $5 million and sentenced to six years in
prison _ not for bringing in stolen money, but for resorting to
bribery, blackmail and fraud in local dealings. Though he admitted
guilt, his conviction was criticized by some Russian immigrant
leaders, who contended he was unjustly punished for offenses
committed elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   With expected good-behavior sentence reductions, Lerner is
likely to be released next year. He will then be allowed to enjoy
his fortune, which the Israeli authorities cannot touch.
Extradition back to Russia, even if Moscow so requested, would be
difficult legally, and unthinkable politically.

<P>
   People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals held a San Francisco
press conference last week, starring  &UR; Chrissie Hynde &LR;  and featuring
a graphic video, decrying the cruel treatment of Indian cows whose
hides are turned into leather. San Francisco was the site of the
anti-leather campaign launch because the Gap, which is

</P>
<P>
   After the conference, PETA was invited by Gap executive  &UR; Alan &LR; 
 &UR; Marks  &LR; to discuss itsconcerns. Marks said the company buys its
leather products from apparel factories; clothing labeled ``Made in
India'' may not be made of cows slaughtered there. The Gap issued a
statement saying, ``We expect apparel factories to source leather
from vendors that follow applicable laws and industry best
practices, including the humane treatment of animals.''

 &HT;    Whoopi promises she won't `be boring'
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Ask Whoopi Goldberg the key to a life-fulfilling
career and one word keeps cropping up: consistency.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm a kid from the projects,'' she says. ``I look the same as
when I started. I guess I'm consistent. I say the same things. I
try to be a fairly good person and try to put something back into
the world. I think people are happy I try to make the effort. One
doesn't always succeed, but they do have to make the effort.''
</P>
<P>
   Goldberg has all the trappings: the Oscar she won for 1990's
``Ghost,'' money (her ``Hollywood Squares'' game show deal alone
brought her $6 million) and worldwide notoriety from her lead role
in 1985's ``The Color Purple'' to ``Girl, Interrupted,'' now
playing in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   The comedian and actress will be in Atlanta as the first in a
series of notable women appearing in ``Unique Lives &AMP;
Experiences,'' a lecture series.
</P>
<P>
   She's talking by phone on this early morning while riding from
her New York home to an appearance on ABC's ``The View.'' ``I was
up before the chickens,'' she says. ``I was whispering to them what
kind of eggs to lay.''
</P>
<P>
   And she talked openly on a variety of subjects: from criticism
lobbed at Atlanta Braves relief pitcher John Rocker to her opinions
about the recent Oscar nominations.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You've only been to metro Atlanta a couple of times. What's
your impression?
</P>
<P>
   A: I like Atlanta. It's sort of becoming a company town. CNN and
all. I like it because it's got a lot of history. America is really
a younger country. But a lot of what went on and shaped the state
of the union happened in Atlanta. It's also very diverse. ``I'm
looking forward to having some fun,'' Goldberg says from New York.
``I don't know yet what I'm going to say in Atlanta, but it ought
to be interesting. I'll never be boring,'' she says optimistically.
Q: How did the words of John Rocker strike you?
</P>
<P>
   A: I can't believe that's how he feels. I think he got caught up
in something that we know because we've been around journalists.
And you say things not realizing what they're going to look like
(in print). We'll never know the tone of what he said. When you
read it, it reads really ugly. He didn't realize _ as some people
don't when you're doing interviews _ what it's going to look like.
Sometimes you go to interviews with (a member of your staff) so
they can kick you when you do dumb stuff. I doubt he really feels
that way. At least I hope not.
</P>
<P>
   Q: You're an Oscar insider. What does the Academy have against
Jim Carrey?
</P>
<P>
   A: I don't think they have anything against him. Who would you
eliminate (from the best actor nominees)? It's a tough year.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Anything surprise you about the nominations?
</P>
<P>
   A: Nobody had said a word about Toni Collette (a supporting
actress nominee for ``The Sixth Sense''). Also, I think
``Magnolia'' is by far the best film of the year, and it didn't get
a best picture nomination. Tom Cruise is brilliant in it. He's
earned this. Without him in ``Rain Man,'' Dustin Hoffman's
performance that year would not have gotten the Oscar. I think in
many years past, Tom has been overlooked.
</P>
<P>
   One more thing: There's Denzel Washington and Michael Clarke
Duncan. Isn't it funny that the two black men who are nominated are
behind bars in their movies. Very strange. Very Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What was it like making ``Girl, Interrupted''?
</P>
<P>
   A: It was a hard movie. I love Winona Ryder because she's a good
woman. I love the fact she fought to get it done. But, basically, I
think I look a bit like a broccoli spear in it. And for the first
time I was one of the oldest people on the set. The girls were
really great. They asked me a lot of questions about lots of
movies. It was kind of good to have a body of work to look back on
and talk to people about.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What can you tell me about Angelina Jolie that I don't
already know?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably nothing. Let's leave it at that.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Part of ``Unique Lives'' is a question and answer segment. So
let's say you're in the audience for Margaret Thatcher. What would
you ask her?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably if she felt as strongly about her kinship to
American politics as she publicly demonstrated. I have a funny
feeling that she went farther to the right than she wanted to. I
don't know why I feel that, but I do.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What would you ask Candice Bergen?
</P>
<P>
   A: Whether she felt that after all the years of waiting to find
just the right thing, whether she found it in ``Murphy Brown.''
</P>
<P>
   Q: And what would you ask Barbara Bush?
</P>
<P>
   A: Probably nothing.

OKLAHOMA'S WATTS, A RISING REPUBLICAN STAR, DOES THINGS HIS WAY

 By ERIC SCHMITT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rep. J.C. Watts Jr. is the only black Republican in Congress. He
is also the communicator in chief for his party in the House, and a
rising national conservative star.
</P>
<P>
   But three weeks ago, Watts nearly called it quits, frustrated
with his job and its strains on his family back in Oklahoma. He
changed his mind only after constituents in his district, which is
83 percent white, urged him to run again. Speaker Dennis Hastert
begged him to stay in a 40-minute conversation, and his wife and
five children went along with his decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deciding factor was that my family said, `We are willing
to stand with you for re-election,''' said Watts, dressed in a dark
pinstriped suit and black cowboy boots in his airy private office
in the Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   Had the 42-year-old former University of Oklahoma football hero
stepped down, it would have been a stinging setback for House
Republicans, who elected Watts two years ago to be conference
chairman, the fourth-ranking leadership job, in an effort to reach
out to African-Americans and shed the image they had under Newt
Gingrich as a party of older white men.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Watts' threatened retirement seems to have swelled his
bully pulpit and his status among House leaders, although he
insists there was no quid pro quo. Last week, for example, Hastert
appointed Watts to lead a group of House Republicans investigating
cybersecurity issues in the wake of recent attacks on high-profile
Internet sites.
</P>
<P>
   The blizzard of daily faxes and e-mail messages from Watts to
official Washington and beyond seems to have intensified in the
past month. ``The photo-op presidency continues,'' Watts declared
in one typical press release, after President Clinton's news
conference last week.
</P>
<P>
   But honing a common message for all 222 House Republicans has
been an elusive goal. ``Republicans like to talk analytically, they
like to talk legislatively and they like to talk about process,''
Watts said. ``We lose most Americans when we talk in terms of the
process.''
</P>
<P>
   To retain or expand their narrow six-seat margin in November,
House Republicans must connect with voters on a gut level or, as
Watts puts it, ``talk to people in ways they want to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   For instance, Watts noted, Republicans have long championed
``family values,'' but their handling of that theme has left the
party looking hardhearted at times. ``I don't think you can talk
about `family values' in a way that makes a single mom feel like
she doesn't love her kids as much as my wife and I love our kids,''
he said. ``That's one simple thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Watts is trying to sand the sharp edges off the public's
perceptions of conservatives, a word he concedes is just as likely
to conjure former Gov. George Wallace of Alabama as, say, Ronald
Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can call it compassionate conservatism; I call it
common-sense conservatism,'' said Watts, an early and ardent
supporter of Gov. George W. Bush of Texas for president. Watts
would probably land a top job in a Bush administration.
</P>
<P>
   Watts' signature issue, community renewal, fits both of those
descriptions. He disagrees with the liberal premise that government
spending programs help black people, and instead would rely on tax
breaks to help improve education, job training and housing in poor
urban and rural settings. He would use religious institutions,
rather than secular agencies, to carry out the work.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are underserved communities that you have to focus
attention on in order to get them to the point where they can
compete,'' Watts said.
</P>
<P>
   Being the lone black Republican officeholder on Capitol Hill
carries its own burdens. When Donna Brazile, Vice President Al
Gore's campaign manager, who is black, suggested that Republicans
show off prominent African-Americans like Watts and Gen. Colin L.
Powell ``because they have no program, no policy,'' Watts called
her remarks ``racist'' and ``appalling.''
</P>
<P>
   ``There are crosses people would love me to bear,'' Watts said.
``Some would love for me to play the role of the black
conservative. I feel no burden to play that role.''
</P>
<P>
   So he resists attempts to make him toe the conservative line on
some issues that are important to blacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whenever you talk about affirmative action, it's a pretty good
guess that old Watts will get a call,'' Watts said. (For the
record, Watts has advised Republicans to go slowly on opposing
racial quotas and preferences.)
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a pretty good guess I'm one of the first members called
whenever something about the Confederate flag comes up,'' he said,
sitting across from a portrait of the abolitionist Frederick
Douglass. (Watts says that South Carolina should remove the
Confederate flag that flies above its state Capitol.)
</P>
<P>
   Julius Caesar Watts Jr. was born and reared in Eufaula, Okla., a
small farming community, where his father was a Baptist minister
who made ends meet by also working as a police officer and a cattle
trader. He was one of two black children who integrated his
elementary school and was the first black quarterback on his high
school football team.
</P>
<P>
   Watts voted for Democrats as late as the 1988 presidential
election. But he switched parties in 1989 after he became
disillusioned with the Democratic Party's leadership. In 1990, he
ran for a seat on the state Corporation Commission, a utility
regulatory board, and won.
</P>
<P>
   Elected to the House in 1994 after a hard-fought primary
campaign, he captured national attention by delivering a passionate
speech at the 1996 Republican National Convention. A year later,
Watts gave the official Republican response to President Clinton's
State of the Union address.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, Watts has battled other top House Republicans,
notably Rep. Tom DeLay of Texas, the majority whip, for control of
the party's message. He insists those feuds are over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our styles are different,'' Watts said of himself and DeLay.
``Tom is smack in the face, 100 miles an hour. I'm a lot more laid
back, wanting to build coalitions and bring in new people. He uses
a hammer. I use a carrot.''

MILOSEVIC MOUNTS AN ELECTION-YEAR CRACKDOWN ON HIS CRITICS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PRAGUE, Czech Republic _ The Yugoslav government of President
Slobodan Milosevic _ its support sliding in an election year _ has
sharply intensified attacks on the democratic opposition and the
news media, calling them traitors and using a draconian press law
to intimidate and impoverish independent publications.
</P>
<P>
   Besides lawsuits, government officials have used open threats of
possible violence.
</P>
<P>
   In a bellicose speech last week to his party congress, Milosevic
called the opposition ``a group of bribed weaklings and blackmailed
profiteers and thieves,'' bought ``with substantial financial
resources funneled from abroad.'' Deputy Prime Minister Vojislav
Seselj of Serbia threatened ``to liquidate'' the independent media,
which he called ``treacherous.''
</P>
<P>
   Traditionally, Milosevic left Serbia's disunited democratic
opposition and his urban intellectual opponents a small space in
which to air their opinions, knowing that he could use the cover of
the law to further marginalize or repress them.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath of the lost war over Kosovo and new efforts by
the opposition _ and Washington _ to oust Milosevic, his
authorities are showing that harsher face.
</P>
<P>
   After a new year's interview in which Milosevic advertised the
crackdown, they are using the press law to damage newspapers and
particularly an independent printing house, ABC Grafika, which
publishes the newspaper Glas Javnosti and prints many other
independent papers and magazines.
</P>
<P>
   The public information law was enacted on Oct. 20, 1998. Since
then, more than 60 cases have been brought, with fines totaling
more than $1 million _ extremely large in a country where the
average monthly income is now less than $50 _ and the pace has
accelerated.
</P>
<P>
   In 1999, independent media were fined more than $600,000, more
than half of that in suits against ABC Grafika, either for material
in Glas Javnosti or for printing the daily bulletin of last year's
failed political rallies against Milosevic.
</P>
<P>
   With some presses already seized and the financial police
investigating possible irregularities, the company is battling
bankruptcy, and Glas Javnosti's editor quit because of the
pressure.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you look at what the regime is doing, it seems they want to
shut us down,'' said Slavoljub Kacarevic, general manager of the
publishing house and now editor in chief of Glas Javnosti. ``The
regime is definitely showing a crueler face, and the way this law
is being implemented is far worse than a year ago. Now they just
fine you every month; it's endless. We look back fondly to the
times when they just banned you for a while.''
</P>
<P>
   After the fifth consecutive trial resulting in a fine for the
daily Danas, its deputy editor, Bozidar Andrejic, said, ``The
bottom line of the punishments is the preplanned wearing down of
the targeted media.''
</P>
<P>
   Even Tanjug, the official press agency, has sued Danas under the
law. On Friday, Danas was fined another $8,000 for quoting
druggists who deplored low-quality imported pharmaceuticals. Danas'
lawyer, Gradimir Nalic, said, ``I expect they'll be in court now
once a week.''
</P>
<P>
   Also on Friday, the police went to Glas Javnosti to confiscate
some of its electronic equipment.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is now legalized chaos, with no protected normative
standards of journalism,'' said Snjezana Milivojevic, a media
analyst who was fired last year from her teaching position at
Belgrade University in a political purge.
</P>
<P>
   Gordana Susa, president of the Independent Journalists
Association of Serbia, says that while editors deny that they are
censoring themselves, ``they are engaging in comforting
self-delusion.''
</P>
<P>
   After the murder in Belgrade this month of the Yugoslav defense
minister, Pavle Bulatovic, Seselj called independent journalists
traitors and accomplices, charging that they took money and
direction from the same governments that bombed Yugoslavia over
Kosovo and, Seselj alleged, that ordered the killing.
</P>
<P>
   ``The gloves are off,'' Seselj said repeatedly. ``Don't think
that we're going to let you kill us off like rabbits, and that
we'll be coddling and caring for you like potted plants. Anyone who
works for the Americans must suffer the consequences.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What consequences?'' he went on. ``The worst possible.'' He
named newspapers and radio stations like B2-92, Danas, Glas
Javnosti and Blic _ only the first two of which get Western aid.
</P>
<P>
   In his new year's interview, Milosevic insisted that many
private broadcasters and publishers ``are under the full financial
and political control of some Western governments,'' with the
``task to destabilize the country.'' A key problem, he said, is
poor enforcement of the press law.
</P>
<P>
   The signal given, government ministers are using the law to sue,
bringing cases before government-appointed judges, and state-owned
media are suing independent media. Editors and publishers must pay
fines within 24 hours or face jail and the confiscation of their
property.
</P>
<P>
   The press law puts the burden on the media to prove the truth of
any assertion, even the cited opinion of a quoted person or
organization.
</P>
<P>
   So in December, a small newspaper and its editor in the town of
Vranje were fined $22,000 for printing part of a Western human
rights report that contained material, already published in the
newspaper, about Albanians fleeing town to escape the draft. The
editor suggested that the real cause was another article suggesting
corruption by local officials of Milosevic's party.
</P>
<P>
   Blic, Danas and Studio B were fined for printing a statement by
the Serbian Renewal Movement, the largest opposition party, which
accused two senior officials of organizing an attempt on the life
of the party's leader, Vuk Draskovic. Kacarevic, stung by previous
fines, left out the names, which he later admitted was
self-censorship.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have ordinarily left alone the small-circulation
weeklies of opinion Nin and Vreme, which sell fewer than 10,000
copies each, mostly to people who oppose Milosevic anyway. But this
month, Nin and its editor were fined about $13,000 for an interview
describing the dismissal of law professors.
</P>
<P>
   With local and federal elections due this year and elections in
Serbia _ Yugoslavia's larger part _ next year, one explanation for
the crackdown may lie in the new reach of some independent papers,
notably the daily tabloid Blic.
</P>
<P>
   Independent newspapers like Danas sell about 10,000 copies a
day. But Glas sells about 70,000, and Blic, owned by a Serb living
in Austria, is selling close to 200,000. Together, that is
significantly more copies than all official papers combined.
</P>
<P>
   Blic, a fundamentally serious newspaper with spoonfuls of
gossip, Hollywood and cheesecake, covers the opposition thoroughly,
if not too critically. Its soft-spoken editor, Veselin Simonovic,
said, ``The biggest danger of that law is self-censorship.'' He
tries to work as if it does not exist, he said, but notes that his
journalists and editors constantly press him to read their copy,
``to make me responsible.''
</P>
<P>
   Milosevic's government is in trouble, Simonovic said. ``They use
the law when they are losing support or feeling nervous,'' he said.
``The level of pressure rises as their polls drop.''
</P>
<P>
   The government continues to maintain tight control over the
national television and has increasingly jammed the signal of
Studio B in Belgrade, which is run by Draskovic's party.
</P>
<P>
   But the government is working on a new telecommunications law,
and ``we expect the electronic media will be pressured in the next
stage,'' Susa said. The opposition controls most major towns in
Serbia, with its own radio or television stations. Many are members
of the Association of Independent Electronic Media, which
distributes B2-92's respected news program throughout much of
Serbia.
</P>
<P>
   After Seselj's attack on B2-92, the association's president,
Veran Matic, said he feared that the government would shut down the
station, formed after the authorities seized his original station,
B-92, during the Kosovo war. ``It's clear that neither myself nor
the people who work at B2-92 feel safe,'' Matic said, ``and we
expect that the radio could be banned again.''

 &HT;     McCAIN PEPPERS BUSH WITH FRESH ATTACKS IN BID TO WIN MICHIGAN  
 &HT;     (Eds: Dateline stands for Lansing dateline in Hearst budget.)

<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. _ Sen. John McCain unleashed a fiery bid
Sunday to rebound from his defeat in South Carolina's Republican
presidential primary, peppering Gov. George W. Bush with fresh
attacks in the critical Michigan primary _ the first
industrial-state showdown of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain vowed to ``get up off the floor'' from his loss Saturday
and relentlessly attack the Texan over the next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sending the message that he is ``the reformer and Governor Bush
is not,'' McCain told several thousand students at Michigan State
University here that he is more determined than ever to carry on
with his uphill fight to wrest the nomination from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said popular support for his ``great crusade'' to reform
politics is ``what makes me get off the floor after taking a punch
and going right back at 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Navy pilot, who endured torture for more than five
years in a North Vietnamese prison, told the enthusiastic crowd,
``My friends, I lived in a hotel once where there were no mints on
the pillow. I know how take a punch and I know how to fight back.
I'm going to be fighting for you because you deserve a better
government than the one you have today.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain launched his most sustained ridicule of Bush's claims to
be a reformer. He accused the governor of tolerating a
no-holds-barred campaign-finance system in Texas and suggested that
Bush would permit special interests to seize control the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, McCain accused Bush of boosting state
spending in Texas by more than 36 percent during his tenure _
exceeding the 20 percent increase in federal spending recorded by
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now who do you want _ a big-spender non-reformer or do you
want the guy who has a record?'' McCain asked the university
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George Bush is reformer, I am an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he told reporters on his campaign bus that ``anyone who
believes that George Bush is a reformer believes in the tooth
fairy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush flew to Michigan early Sunday morning and headed for GOP
strongholds around Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, last night lifted my spirits, and my spirits are
</P>
<P>
   still high,'' he said after attending Sunday morning church
</P>
<P>
   services. He added, ``I'm going to continue to talk about how to
bring our country together. I'm going to talk about a better
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also underscored a familiar theme _ that Democrats
shouldn't choose the Republican nominee. He referred to a Michigan
lawyer, Geoffrey
</P>
<P>
   Fieger, who represented suicide advocate Jack Kervorkian.
Fieger, Bush said, has been ``making noises'' about voting in
Tuesday's Republican primary. But Republicans should tell him,
``You're not going to pick the
</P>
<P>
   Republican nominee,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed relaxed after his 53 percent to 42 percent victory
over McCain in South Carolina, a victory that was crucial to the
governor since McCain beat him by 19 percentage points in the Feb.
1 New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan Bush and McCain are in a statistical tie in the
polls. The Detroit News, which showed McCain ahead of Bush 49
percent to 42 percent last week, released a new poll Sunday showing
that McCain's lead had narrowed to 40 percent to Bush's 38 percent.
Michigan, a swing state in presidential elections, has voted
Republican in 8 of the 13 presidential elections since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is hoping his ``reformer with results'' theme will connect
with voters here, as it did in South Carolina and that voters here
will see McCain, not Bush, as the purveyor of negative attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Some Michigan voters said they were watching the contest closely
before making their final decision. Bob Anderson, 42, attending a
McCain rally in Livonia, a Detroit suburb, said he wanted to see
how the two candidates ``stand the heat'' and added, ``What they're
doing to each other is nothing compared to what Al Gore will do to
them in the fall campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Noga, 60, a franchise development specialist living in
Sterling Heights, Mich., said, ``I'd hate see Michigan sit back and
act like a big sister to little South Carolina.'' Noga added, ``I'd
rather see us do something to help the McCain _ a candidate who can
inspire us to have that feeling about America that we've lost.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would win Tuesday's primary in his home state of
Arizona but needed a victory in Michigan to sustain his
hard-pressed challenge. Asked if Michigan was a ``must-win state,''
McCain replied: ``It's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Livonia rally, McCain touted his his willingness to
overhaul the campaign finance system and to take on the ``iron
triangle of lobbyists, money and legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If you want your government back, a government
that's been stolen by the special interests and the big money
people _ a system that George Bush wants to perpetuate _ then
you're going to vote for me and you're going to get our vote out,''
McCain declared.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in contrast to Bush, he would make sure that the
GOP was ``not a party of exclusion, not a party of the special
interests, not a party of these pork barrelers in Washington,
D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We've lost our way since Ronald Reagan was elected
in 1980, and I'm going to bring us back.''
</P>
<P>
   The contest in Michigan marks a turn in the primary road from
small states toward more populous, industrial states.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, with a population of 9.8 million and 18 electoral
votes, is the most politically powerful state to host a
presidential primary so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The four states that have already held primaries or caucuses _
Iowa, New Hampshire, Delaware and South Carolina _have a combined
population of 8.6 million and just 22 of the 270 electoral votes
needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, working to pick up the support of Michigan's influential
Roman Catholic community, picked up the endorsement of Rep. Peter
King, R-N.Y., a Catholic who had formerly pledged his support to
Bush. King said that he was switching to McCain because Bush had
demonstrated a ``willingness to take any road the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   King told the Associated Press that he decided to support McCain
after Bush spoke at Bob Jones University during the South Carolina
primary. The southern Baptist school prohibits inter-racial dating
and critics say its officials have expressed anti-Catholic
positions. About 30 percent of Michigan voters identify themselves
as Catholic, according to exit surveys in past elections.
</P>
<P>
   King said America needs ``a Reagan conservative who will not
yield to the temptation of pandering in ways that support
bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Texas governor regrets
King's decision but ``respects Congressman King's right to be
wrong.''

   Hines bails out of sled, loses race
</P>
<P>
   By Karen Rosen
</P>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ Garrett Hines bailed out of the Winter
Goodwill Games a little early Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   When his two-man bobsled flipped over at turn 12, the brakeman
from Atlanta calmly ``kicked out of the sled'' as it barrelled down
the track, runners up, at just under 70 mph.
</P>
<P>
   Was that like jumping out of a moving car?
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never jumped out of one, so I don't know,'' said Hines, a
1998 Olympian who was 10th in the two-man and fifth in the four-man
competition in Nagano. ``As soon as my body hit the ground, I got
out.''
</P>
<P>
   He claimed he didn't have any bumps and bruises, while driver
Todd Hays, who stayed with the sled to the finish line at Mt. Van
Hoevenberg, had abrasions on his shoulder and hurt his calf.
</P>
<P>
   This was only Hines' second crash as a bobsledder, and he gave
it a 3 on a scale of 10, with 10 being the worst.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't do it again, you gave me a heart attack,'' his wife
Ileana said later as they shared a meal at the Olympic Training
Center.
</P>
<P>
   She had been watching the run on a monitor at the top of track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was in shock because one second he was in the sled,'' she
said, ``and the next second he was laying on the ice sliding
down.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines and Hays, who form the USA 2 team, were in fourth place
when they crashed. Teammates Brian Shimer, who re-injured the
cartilage in his ribs due to the G-forces at Turn 10, and Pavel
Jovanovic took the bronze behind Latvia and Germany.
</P>
<P>
   A Canadian team had crashed just before Hines and Hays pushed
onto the track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had a really bad feeling in my stomach, it felt like a
really bad omen,'' said Ileana Hines.
</P>
<P>
   But her husband wasn't intimidated.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you get to the top of the hill, it's a part of the
sport,'' he said, ``but you try not to think about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Because drivers got only six training runs on the brand-new
$24-million track, the inexperience cost some of them. After two
runs Saturday, Hays had warned, ``If you get late in (Turns) 18, 8
and 12, you're in real trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   He never made it to 18. He was trying a new line at 12 and
entered it a little too late.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pressure took us up and we couldn't come down,'' Hines
said.
</P>
<P>
   At least not right-side up.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is one race I probably didn't get upset at by losing,''
he said. ``It's the Goodwill Games, not a World Cup.''
</P>
<P>
   Hines, who took last year off, was disappointed that he won only
one World Cup medal this year, a silver in a four-man bobsled
driven by Shimer at Igls, Austria.
</P>
<P>
   He said he and Hays work well together and were sixth at the
recent World Championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``Garrett Hines is the best push athlete in the world and I'm
lucky enough to have him,'' Hays said of the former football
player.
</P>
<P>
   Hines doesn't accept the compliment.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we're able to beat our competitors on a consistent basis,
then we can say we have some of the best pushers and drivers,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. coach Steve Maiorca said that Hays and Hines have some of
the fastest starts in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``If they stay together the next couple of years,'' he said,
``they're going to be a team to deal with come Olympic time.''

TURKEY CHARGES 3 KURDISH MAYORS WITH SUPPORTING TERRORISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By STEPHEN KINZER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ISTANBUL, Turkey _ Last Thursday night, Mayor Feridun Celik of
the mainly Kurdish city of Diyarbakir dined with government
officials and foreign ambassadors at a glittering banquet in Ankara
honoring the visiting Swedish foreign minister.
</P>
<P>
   Two nights later, he was eating prison food after being taken
into custody on charges that he was secretly supporting Kurdish
terrorists.
</P>
<P>
   Celik is one of three Kurdish mayors who were arrested over the
weekend on similar charges as the Turkish authorities seemed caught
up in a sudden internal debate over how to deal with Kurdish
politicians.
</P>
<P>
   After December, when the European Union accepted Turkey as an
official candidate for membership, European leaders said they hoped
some formula would soon be found to end the long and violent
confrontation between Turkish and Kurdish nationalism. With the
leader of Kurdish guerrillas, Abdullah Ocalan, under arrest and
calling on his followers to lay down their arms, the moment seemed
propitious.
</P>
<P>
   In the last few days, however, much of that hope has collapsed.
European diplomats said that Prime Minister Bulent Ecevit's
ambitious goal of bringing Turkey into the European Union by 2004
now seems completely unrealistic.
</P>
<P>
   Relations between Turkey and the union chilled unexpectedly last
week after government officials refused to allow members of the
European Parliament to visit an imprisoned Kurdish political
leader, Leyla Zana. In an angry protest, the Europeans canceled
their visit.
</P>
<P>
   The arrests of Celik and the mayors of Bingol and Siirt may
prove even more damaging to Turkey's European ambitions. They are
leaders of the more than 35 Kurdish mayors who have won
considerable international support since their election last year.
Many European leaders view them as ideal figures around which to
build a nonviolent Kurdish political movement.
</P>
<P>
   Turkish prosecutors, however, see them quite differently. They
charged that the three had maintained secret contacts with Ocalan's
rebels, giving them money and ``taking instructions'' from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is disturbing,'' said the Swedish foreign minister, Anna
Lindh, who learned of the arrests shortly after her return to
Stockholm. ``It is rather spectacular that they have been arrested
this way.''
</P>
<P>
   The three arrested mayors were among a group of Kurdish
politicians who met with President Suleyman Demirel a few months
ago. Prime Minister Ecevit, however, has refused to receive them.
So have army commanders in the Kurdish region, many of whom
evidently consider them apologists for terrorism.
</P>
<P>
   ``Turkey is shooting itself in the foot again by not ever
thinking about how to have a creative policy toward Kurds and how
to use this window of opportunity, this period of calm, and the
willingness of these political Kurds to try to establish a new
approach,'' lamented one European ambassador.
</P>
<P>
   ``In these last couple of months the Europeans have really taken
a very positive attitude toward Turkey, but inside Turkey things
seem to be getting worse instead of better,'' the ambassador said.
``There are so many signs lately of a countervailing force, of
circles that want to undermine the really good dialogue that Turkey
and the European Union have had. It is difficult to pinpoint who
these forces are, but they seem to be everywhere.''
</P>
<P>
   On the eve of the mayors' arrests, the government body that
regulates broadcasting ordered the television news channel CNN-Turk
off the air for one day as punishment for transmitting what it said
was separatist propaganda.
</P>
<P>
   During the offending program, an interviewer asked his guest if
it might be possible for Ocalan to become a Turkish version of
Nelson Mandela, who led a guerrilla uprising in South Africa, was
imprisoned and then went on to lead his country toward
reconciliation. Simply posing that question was judged to be
advocacy of separatism.
</P>
<P>
   The station is appealing the order for a one-day shutdown. Prime
Minister Ecevit said he had ``a lot of difficulty'' understanding
the sanction, and many newspapers bitterly condemned it. Referring
to the Iraqi president, one carried news of it under the headline:
``Even Saddam Did Not Do This!''

 &HT;    Victory cut short by protest
 &HT;    By Karen Rosen

<TEXT>
<P>
   LAKE PLACID, N.Y. _ The U.S. men's snowboard team was at cross
purposes in the boardercross at the Winter Goodwill Games Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Seth Wescott of Farmington, Maine, who broke his skateboard in
an earlier round and had to switch to a backup, was celebrating his
victory until he heard over the public address system, ``There is a
protest on the course.''
</P>
<P>
   The protester was teammate Ryan Neptune of Boise, Idaho, the
1999 U.S. champion. Neptune caught the nose of his board under the
start gate in the finals, sending him flying into the fresh snow.
</P>
<P>
   Officials decided to rerun the race. In boardercross, a pack of
riders negotiate an obstacle course, and Wescott and Neptune
crashed into each other during the second race. Wescott was fourth
and Neptune fifth behind Canadian Scott Gaffney.
</P>
<P>
   Although Neptune could complain about the set of the gates, he
couldn't say anything bad about the gates themselves. His company
produces them.
</P>
<P>
   Canadian snowboarder Kim Dunn fell during training and suffered
a concussion.
</P>
<P>
   MEDAL COUNT
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. won 34 of the 113 available medals (11 gold, 10 silver
and 13 bronze) at the inaugural Winter Goodwill Games, more than
twice as many as Canada (15 total, 8 gold). Germany was third with
10 medals, followed by Austria and Norway with eight apiece.
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL HERO, PART 1
</P>
<P>
   Hometown favorite Jimmy Shea won men's skeleton by an astounding
2.83 seconds over four runs. He became the first skeleton driver to
break a minute on the track with a 59.91-second third run. Shea
defeated Chris Soule, who had unseated him as U.S. champion this
season. Shea's grandfather Jack, who won two Olympic speedskating
gold medals in 1932 in Lake Placid, and his father Jim, a 1964
Olympian, presented his medal.
</P>
<P>
   LOCAL HERO, PART 2
</P>
<P>
   Dorothy Hamill spent her summers training in Lake Placid when
she was growing up. ``This is home for me,'' said the 1976 Olympic
champion, who finished fifth among seven skaters in the women's
competition and was just .4 out of third.
</P>
<P>
   ``The fact that I didn't come in last for me was a milestone,''
Hamill said. ``I hope I didn't embarrass my daughter. She has to go
back to school on Tuesday.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd loved Hamill, but the self-deprecating skater shrugged
it off.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's pretty much sympathy applause,'' she said. ``The
people were my age (when she won the Olympics) and are my age now,
so they can understand how painful it can be.''
</P>
<P>
   MONEY TALKS
</P>
<P>
   Founder Ted Turner said the Winter Goodwill Games have been
budgeted for a ``small loss,'' but ``we get a lot of bang for our
buck.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the total budget is about $30 million, compared to $38
million for an NFL regular-season game on cable ``that lasts less
than three hours. What would you rather have?''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``This is expensive, but I've never been a small
thinker. I don't like to think small. I like to thnk big, and this
is big. Nobody else ever put on something that approximates the
Olympics every four years.''
</P>
<P>
   The next Goodwill Games will take place in Brisbane, Australia,
in the summer of 2001.

 McCAIN PEPPERS BUSH WITH FRESH ATTACKS IN BID TO WIN MICHIGAN  
 (Eds: Dateline stands for Lansing dateline in Hearst budget.)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEWART M. POWELL  
 c.2000 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. _ Sen. John McCain unleashed a fiery bid
Sunday to rebound from his defeat in South Carolina's Republican
presidential primary, peppering Gov. George W. Bush with fresh
attacks in the critical Michigan primary _ the first
industrial-state showdown of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain vowed to ``get up off the floor'' from his loss Saturday
and relentlessly attack the Texan over the next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sending the message that he is ``the reformer and Governor Bush
is not,'' McCain told several thousand students at Michigan State
University here that he is more determined than ever to carry on
with his uphill fight to wrest the nomination from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said popular support for his ``great crusade'' to reform
politics is ``what makes me get off the floor after taking a punch
and going right back at 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Navy pilot, who endured torture for more than five
years in a North Vietnamese prison, told the enthusiastic crowd,
``My friends, I lived in a hotel once where there were no mints on
the pillow. I know how take a punch and I know how to fight back.
I'm going to be fighting for you because you deserve a better
government than the one you have today.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain launched his most sustained ridicule of Bush's claims to
be a reformer. He accused the governor of tolerating a
no-holds-barred campaign-finance system in Texas and suggested that
Bush would permit special interests to seize control the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, McCain accused Bush of boosting state
spending in Texas by more than 36 percent during his tenure _
exceeding the 20 percent increase in federal spending recorded by
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now who do you want _ a big-spender non-reformer or do you
want the guy who has a record?'' McCain asked the university
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George Bush is reformer, I am an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he told reporters on his campaign bus that ``anyone who
believes that George Bush is a reformer believes in the tooth
fairy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush flew to Michigan early Sunday morning and headed for GOP
strongholds around Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, last night lifted my spirits, and my spirits are
</P>
<P>
   still high,'' he said after attending Sunday morning church
</P>
<P>
   services. He added, ``I'm going to continue to talk about how to
bring our country together. I'm going to talk about a better
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also underscored a familiar theme _ that Democrats
shouldn't choose the Republican nominee. He referred to a Michigan
lawyer, Geoffrey
</P>
<P>
   Fieger, who represented suicide advocate Jack Kervorkian.
Fieger, Bush said, has been ``making noises'' about voting in
Tuesday's Republican primary. But Republicans should tell him,
``You're not going to pick the
</P>
<P>
   Republican nominee,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed relaxed after his 53 percent to 42 percent victory
over McCain in South Carolina, a victory that was crucial to the
governor since McCain beat him by 19 percentage points in the Feb.
1 New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan Bush and McCain are in a statistical tie in the
polls. The Detroit News, which showed McCain ahead of Bush 49
percent to 42 percent last week, released a new poll Sunday showing
that McCain's lead had narrowed to 40 percent to Bush's 38 percent.
Michigan, a swing state in presidential elections, has voted
Republican in 8 of the 13 presidential elections since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is hoping his ``reformer with results'' theme will connect
with voters here, as it did in South Carolina and that voters here
will see McCain, not Bush, as the purveyor of negative attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Some Michigan voters said they were watching the contest closely
before making their final decision. Bob Anderson, 42, attending a
McCain rally in Livonia, a Detroit suburb, said he wanted to see
how the two candidates ``stand the heat'' and added, ``What they're
doing to each other is nothing compared to what Al Gore will do to
them in the fall campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Noga, 60, a franchise development specialist living in
Sterling Heights, Mich., said, ``I'd hate see Michigan sit back and
act like a big sister to little South Carolina.'' Noga added, ``I'd
rather see us do something to help the McCain _ a candidate who can
inspire us to have that feeling about America that we've lost.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would win Tuesday's primary in his home state of
Arizona but needed a victory in Michigan to sustain his
hard-pressed challenge. Asked if Michigan was a ``must-win state,''
McCain replied: ``It's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Livonia rally, McCain touted his his willingness to
overhaul the campaign finance system and to take on the ``iron
triangle of lobbyists, money and legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If you want your government back, a government
that's been stolen by the special interests and the big money
people _ a system that George Bush wants to perpetuate _ then
you're going to vote for me and you're going to get our vote out,''
McCain declared.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in contrast to Bush, he would make sure that the
GOP was ``not a party of exclusion, not a party of the special
interests, not a party of these pork barrelers in Washington,
D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We've lost our way since Ronald Reagan was elected
in 1980, and I'm going to bring us back.''
</P>
<P>
   The contest in Michigan marks a turn in the primary road from
small states toward more populous, industrial states.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, with a population of 9.8 million and 18 electoral
votes, is the most politically powerful state to host a
presidential primary so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The four states that have already held primaries or caucuses _
Iowa, New Hampshire, Delaware and South Carolina _have a combined
population of 8.6 million and just 22 of the 270 electoral votes
needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, working to pick up the support of Michigan's influential
Roman Catholic community, picked up the endorsement of Rep. Peter
King, R-N.Y., a Catholic who had formerly pledged his support to
Bush. King said that he was switching to McCain because Bush had
demonstrated a ``willingness to take any road the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   King told the Associated Press that he decided to support McCain
after Bush spoke at Bob Jones University during the South Carolina
primary. The southern Baptist school prohibits inter-racial dating
and critics say its officials have expressed anti-Catholic
positions. About 30 percent of Michigan voters identify themselves
as Catholic, according to exit surveys in past elections.
</P>
<P>
   King said America needs ``a Reagan conservative who will not
yield to the temptation of pandering in ways that support
bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Texas governor regrets
King's decision but ``respects Congressman King's right to be
wrong.''

AS FIGHT NEARS, DE LA HOYA'S BIGGER CHALLENGE MAY BE HIMSELF 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms)

 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BIG BEAR, Calif. _ A crisis of confidence had struck the
resident of the big cedar log cabin at the corner of De La Hoya
Street and Golden Boy Avenue in this mountain resort town three
hours east of Los Angeles. It clung to him like a sweat-soaked
T-shirt before, during and immediately after his loss to Felix
Trinidad last September, the first loss of his professional career.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past six weeks it has dissolved into the pools of
sweat in the makeshift boxing gym that he set up in the four-car
garage that is 50 feet from the main house. It drifted away slowly,
like the puffs of his frosty breath as he tortured his mind and
body running the steep trails in the San Bernardino Mountains above
his house.
</P>
<P>
   Now, whenever doubt tries to creep back in, Oscar De La Hoya
chases it away with a mantra, ``No more Nice Guy!''
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya (31-1), the former World Boxing Council welterweight
champion, will carry that mantra into the ring with him against
Derrell Coley (34-1-2) in a 12-round bout on Saturday night at
Madison Square Garden _ his first fight in New York since he
leveled Jesse James Leija five years ago. If he is as good as he
looked in a recent training session, and as fit as he says he is,
Coley is in trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm going to reach way down in my pockets and do some things
they have never seen from me,'' De La Hoya said. ``That's the way
I'm thinking now. It's there. I just haven't brought it out.''
</P>
<P>
   Coley sneered at that and predicted he would knock out De La
Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``He says the same thing before every fight,'' Coley said. ``But
then he does the same thing every fight. I don't see him changing
anything from his last fight.''
</P>
<P>
   If Coley is right, then De La Hoya's problem goes deeper than
the crisis of confidence, deeper than previously undisclosed
physical ailments _ injuries to his left hand and left ankle and
the aftereffects of the flu _ that he said kept him from going full
throttle in the Trinidad fight. If Coley is right, it seems that
there could be something in De La Hoya's makeup that prevents him
from breaking through to a level of superiority _ a character flaw
or mental barrier that he can not overcome even with his immense
talent.
</P>
<P>
   An eight-foot-tall poster, advertising the De La Hoya-Trinidad
match as ``The Fight of the Millennium'' still hung in the gym
here, on a wall adjacent to the ring. Was it there for motivation
or as some kind of twisted reminder of what not to do the next time
around?
</P>
<P>
   ``I never even noticed it,'' De La Hoya said as he sat on the
ring apron talking about his bout with Coley. ``I guess I just
haven't gotten around to taking it down.''
</P>
<P>
   After a few minutes, De La Hoya walked over and carefully took
the poster off the wall. He laid it in the ring face down and
returned to his spot on the ring apron. Later, a smaller poster,
advertising his bout with Coley on Home Box Office, went up.
</P>
<P>
   This has been a quiet training camp for De La Hoya. He has
isolated himself as much as he can in a residential community. He
recently installed black sheet metal over the black wrought iron
fence around his house. He has not had any public workouts. He has
limited his access to the news media since he arrived here shortly
after New Year's Day.
</P>
<P>
   ``No distractions,'' he said. ``I haven't even played golf. I
have seen my daughter only once. Nobody has been around except me
and the people in my camp. I've been able to concentrate 100
percent on boxing. I'm feeling good. I'm pain free for the first
time in a long time.''
</P>
<P>
   The sting of the loss to Trinidad is gone, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It left quickly, because I know I won the fight,'' De La Hoya
said. ``People that I meet on the street have a lot of respect for
me because they know I won the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   From now on, De La Hoya said, he would not leave anything up to
the judges.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been thinking knockout a lot lately,'' De La Hoya said.
``I don't want to dance and let the other guy move me back. I lost
a lot of respect because of this boxing stuff. I'm not a boxer.
That's not me. That's not my style. I feel more comfortable
standing in front and banging with a guy.''
</P>
<P>
   At a recent workout, Joel De La Hoya Sr. watched closely as his
son grunted and furiously threw punches into mitts worn by the
trainer Robert Alcazar. De La Hoya was taking a day off from
sparring after going more than 100 rounds before this session. Each
crisp punch hit a mitt with a solid thud. A hard jab followed by a
lightning fast four-punch combination.
</P>
<P>
   Pop! Rat-a-tat-tat! Alcazar would wince, shake his hands and
raise them again. Over and over for eight rounds.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya's father seemed pleased with what he saw.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is happy, and healthy for the first time in a long time,''
Joel De La Hoya said. ``He is ready to go. Like a racehorse, ready
for the race.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   His relationship with his son had been more Svengali than Ward
Cleaver. But lately that has thawed. Before the Trinidad fight, De
La Hoya said he could hardly stand for his father to be at his
training camp for a day. Now, Joel is a daily fixture, being sent
away from the mountain home to Los Angeles only when he begins to
sniffle and it looks as if he may be coming down with a cold or flu
that his son could contract.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya broke the ice with his father late last year at a
charity fund-raiser. The boxer gave an emotional speech praising
his father and then presented him with a gold Rolex watch. The
elder De La Hoya, called to the stage by his son, looked at the
watch and then embraced his son, saying he loved him. It was the
first time Joel had ever made such a public display of affection to
his son.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have always loved him,'' Joel said. ``He knew that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the past, De La Hoya has said that his father has never
praised him after one of his professional fights. Joel is asked
which of his son's bouts was the best in his opinion.
</P>
<P>
   ``When he was in the Olympics and he won the gold medal,'' Joel
said.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, that was the fight that De La Hoya dedicated to his
mother, Cecilia, who died before De La Hoya went to the 1992
Olympic Games in Barcelona, Spain. What does De La Hoya need to do
to become the very best as a pro?
</P>
<P>
   ``He needs to be 100 percent healthy and train very hard for a
fight,'' Joel said. ``He will probably be 85 to 90 percent for this
fight. This will be the best one yet.''
</P>
<P>
   Joel, like a lot of his son's boxing fans, is still waiting for
that ultimate performance _ the one that forces De La Hoya to
summon all of his will and drives him to dig into his vast untapped
talent and put on a display of boxing that leaves everyone gasping.
It could be against Coley or it may never happen.
</P>
<P>
   Against Trinidad, De La Hoya put on a masterful display of
boxing for the first eight rounds, fluidly floating around the ring
and tagging the stiff Trinidad at will. If De La Hoya had chosen to
press forward in an all-out attack in those early rounds, he would
probably have won by a knockout. But De La Hoya held back, and then
in the final four rounds he retreated. It looked as if he were
taking the cautious approach and coasting to victory.
</P>
<P>
   De La Hoya, however, said he was physically unable to do what
his instincts were telling him to do: attack Trinidad. Two weeks
earlier, De La Hoya spent two days in bed with the flu. Then, he
twisted his ankle and could not run. A sore left hand became
aggravated and he could not throw a jab in training.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was bad,'' he said. ``But I didn't want to make any
excuses, and I didn't want to pull out of the fight.''
</P>
<P>
   After the fight, De La Hoya did not bring up the injuries,
explaining later that it would sound as if he was making excuses.
Instead, he said, the keep-away approach was all a part of his
strategy.
</P>
<P>
   In reality, the fight plan for Trinidad was the same as it had
been against Ike Quartey _ box and then pick spots to slug it out
and look for the knockout. Though he did not knock out Quartey, De
La Hoya put on one of his finest performances, getting up from a
knockdown and knocking down Quartey twice before capping the fight
with a vicious flurry in the first few minutes of the 12th round.
</P>
<P>
   Gil Clancy, the veteran New York trainer, took the hit for the
loss to Trinidad. Clancy was fired. De La Hoya said there was too
much confusion in his corner during that fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``At one point they couldn't even find my mouthpiece,'' he said.
``That's how bad it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, it is only Alcazar, De La Hoya's brother, Joel Jr., and the
cut man Chuck Bodack in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``No more tactics,'' Alcazar said. ``We go in and knock them out
as soon as possible. Everybody can keep their own ideas. We're back
to where we used to be.''

   OILPRICES-ECON (Washington) _ For the past year, even as the
price of oil tripled to $30 a barrel from a record low of $10,
policy makers, economists and many in the oil industry itself hewed
closely to the same line: Oil doesn't matter much anymore.
Technology, which depends much less on energy than manufacturing
does, now drives economic growth. Such thinking was, and to a
certain extent remains, conventional wisdom. But it has taken only
a few weeks of $2 a gallon home heating oil, $20 airline ticket
surcharges, and $75 to gas up Ford Expeditions to make people
wonder if oil is really so irrelevant. By Joseph Kahn.

   SAKU, Japan _ The air is remarkably crisp in this town at the
edge of Japan's ski country. The streets are uncluttered with
traffic. And unlike in high-decibel Tokyo, the prevailing sound
here is that of silence.
</P>
<P>
   But for all of its appearance as a haven of tranquillity, only
heightened on this day by a fresh dusting of snow, this city of
60,000 stands on the front lines of a stress-related condition that
is quietly ravaging Japan.
</P>
<P>
   When the Japanese government announced last week that one-third
of the working-age population was suffering from chronic fatigue,
few stress-haunted denizens of Tokyo, with its heavy overcrowding,
unrelenting pace and impersonal nature, could have been taken
aback.
</P>
<P>
   What is far more surprising is that quiet little towns like
these are being hit every bit as hard by a poorly understood
condition that leaves many of its victims incapacitated for months
or years on end.
</P>
<P>
   In the hulking, modern general hospital at town's edge, 32
percent of the patients hospitalized in the internal
medicine/psychology ward are being treated for chronic fatigue
syndrome, a diagnosis that is made only after six months of severe,
continuous fatigue in the absence of any known organic illness.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them, indeed, are immediately recognizable by the heavy
air of weariness that surrounds them as they slump in their seats,
waiting to see their doctors in the ward.
</P>
<P>
   ``I could not even get up from my chair before my treatment,''
said Hiroaki Sugihara, 36, who was hospitalized here for three
months recently. ``I was too tired to walk, and it was very
difficult for me to get around, even in the house.''
</P>
<P>
   With treatments of anti-depressants, biofeedback and counseling,
Sugihara has found his life slowly edging toward normality since,
although he says he still lacks stamina. ``Of course I would like
to become energetic again, but I don't think I will ever be able to
work as hard,'' he said. ``I just want to be healthy.''
</P>
<P>
   Sugihara's condition may have been related to the overwork that
he said he once commonly engaged in as a free-lance computer
programmer. Indeed, during Japan's boom years, in the 1970s and
1980s, as many as 10,000 people were believed to die annually from
``karoshi,'' or overwork.
</P>
<P>
   But doctors here say that the explosion of chronic tiredness and
of chronic fatigue syndrome in particular is a distinctly post-boom
phenomenon. More complex than simple overwork, they say, it is
increasingly associated with the stresses placed on this society
since it began its dramatic economic slide more than 10 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention says the syndrome affects perhaps 4 percent to 8 percent
of the population over 18. Its symptoms, which include weakness,
profound lassitude, difficulty concentrating, insomnia and often
low-grade fever, remain equally unexplained.
</P>
<P>
   But in Japan, where the condition appears to be far more
prevalent, experts are leaning toward explanations that emphasize
societal mutations far more than their American counterparts.
</P>
<P>
   ``The number of patients like these is on the increase,'' said
Dr. Toshiho Iida, a specialist in treating chronic fatigue syndrome
patients at the hospital. ``As for the causes, they are many, but
we think they have to do with the changes in Japanese society which
have been accelerating in the last five or 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``The changes range from eating habits, environmental problems,
housing, and in many other things too. In the urban areas, for
example, people no longer know who lives next door to them anymore,
and that produces stress.''
</P>
<P>
   During Japan's economic downturn, many businessmen and workers
have taken their change of fortune personally. Struggling against
huge debts, many have found themselves working harder and harder to
meet their commitments and maintain their living standards.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of it is stress, part of it is depression-related, part
of it may be caused by infection, and part of it is certainly
overwork, because overwork is still rampant in Japan,'' said Dr.
Masumi Minowa, an epidemiologist at the National Institute of
Public Health, whose recent random study of 4,000 people found that
35 percent had experienced chronic fatigue for at least six months.
</P>
<P>
   Among the social factors that therapists and researchers are
pointing to as potential contributing factors are family
relationships, which are under great strain.
</P>
<P>
   Grown children, with few job prospects are slower to leave the
home. With a fast-aging population, more aged parents, too, must be
cared for. And rather than committing themselves to the rat race
their parents have known, many younger children are opting for
unconventional lifestyles that involve far more attention to
enjoyment and far less emphasis on hard work.
</P>
<P>
   Satoe Yamada, 24, a rail-thin worker at a photo lab, described
her condition, which led to rapid weight loss, and left her with
pronounced bags under her eyes, as an onslaught of stress. Bit by
bit, feeling exhausted by her contacts with others, she said she
began to withdraw. Then, when she switched to a new job, where she
was asked to work long hours, her bout began with chronic fatigue
syndrome _ a condition she had never heard of.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were various problems at home,'' she said, not wishing
to explain further. ``I was feeling stress from my family and
friends. And I had a new job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't sleep even when I wanted to sleep. And the food I
ate didn't seem to nourish me. I lost 10 pounds in two weeks.''

   EAST LANSING, Mich. _ Sen. John McCain unleashed a fiery bid
Sunday to rebound from his defeat in South Carolina's Republican
presidential primary, peppering Gov. George W. Bush with fresh
attacks in the critical Michigan primary _ the first
industrial-state showdown of the campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain vowed to ``get up off the floor'' from his loss Saturday
and relentlessly attack the Texan over the next 48 hours.
</P>
<P>
   Sending the message that he is ``the reformer and Governor Bush
is not,'' McCain told several thousand students at Michigan State
University here that he is more determined than ever to carry on
with his uphill fight to wrest the nomination from Bush.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said popular support for his ``great crusade'' to reform
politics is ``what makes me get off the floor after taking a punch
and going right back at 'em.''
</P>
<P>
   The former Navy pilot, who endured torture for more than five
years in a North Vietnamese prison, told the enthusiastic crowd,
``My friends, I lived in a hotel once where there were no mints on
the pillow. I know how take a punch and I know how to fight back.
I'm going to be fighting for you because you deserve a better
government than the one you have today.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain launched his most sustained ridicule of Bush's claims to
be a reformer. He accused the governor of tolerating a
no-holds-barred campaign-finance system in Texas and suggested that
Bush would permit special interests to seize control the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   For the first time, McCain accused Bush of boosting state
spending in Texas by more than 36 percent during his tenure _
exceeding the 20 percent increase in federal spending recorded by
the Clinton administration.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now who do you want _ a big-spender non-reformer or do you
want the guy who has a record?'' McCain asked the university
audience.
</P>
<P>
   ``If George Bush is reformer, I am an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   Later he told reporters on his campaign bus that ``anyone who
believes that George Bush is a reformer believes in the tooth
fairy.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush flew to Michigan early Sunday morning and headed for GOP
strongholds around Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, last night lifted my spirits, and my spirits are
</P>
<P>
   still high,'' he said after attending Sunday morning church
</P>
<P>
   services. He added, ``I'm going to continue to talk about how to
bring our country together. I'm going to talk about a better
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also underscored a familiar theme _ that Democrats
shouldn't choose the Republican nominee. He referred to a Michigan
lawyer, Geoffrey
</P>
<P>
   Fieger, who represented suicide advocate Jack Kervorkian.
Fieger, Bush said, has been ``making noises'' about voting in
Tuesday's Republican primary. But Republicans should tell him,
``You're not going to pick the
</P>
<P>
   Republican nominee,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed relaxed after his 53 percent to 42 percent victory
over McCain in South Carolina, a victory that was crucial to the
governor since McCain beat him by 19 percentage points in the Feb.
1 New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   In Michigan Bush and McCain are in a statistical tie in the
polls. The Detroit News, which showed McCain ahead of Bush 49
percent to 42 percent last week, released a new poll Sunday showing
that McCain's lead had narrowed to 40 percent to Bush's 38 percent.
Michigan, a swing state in presidential elections, has voted
Republican in 8 of the 13 presidential elections since 1948.
</P>
<P>
   Bush is hoping his ``reformer with results'' theme will connect
with voters here, as it did in South Carolina and that voters here
will see McCain, not Bush, as the purveyor of negative attacks.
</P>
<P>
   Some Michigan voters said they were watching the contest closely
before making their final decision. Bob Anderson, 42, attending a
McCain rally in Livonia, a Detroit suburb, said he wanted to see
how the two candidates ``stand the heat'' and added, ``What they're
doing to each other is nothing compared to what Al Gore will do to
them in the fall campaign.''
</P>
<P>
   Tony Noga, 60, a franchise development specialist living in
Sterling Heights, Mich., said, ``I'd hate see Michigan sit back and
act like a big sister to little South Carolina.'' Noga added, ``I'd
rather see us do something to help the McCain _ a candidate who can
inspire us to have that feeling about America that we've lost.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would win Tuesday's primary in his home state of
Arizona but needed a victory in Michigan to sustain his
hard-pressed challenge. Asked if Michigan was a ``must-win state,''
McCain replied: ``It's very important.''
</P>
<P>
   At the Livonia rally, McCain touted his his willingness to
overhaul the campaign finance system and to take on the ``iron
triangle of lobbyists, money and legislation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``If you want your government back, a government
that's been stolen by the special interests and the big money
people _ a system that George Bush wants to perpetuate _ then
you're going to vote for me and you're going to get our vote out,''
McCain declared.
</P>
<P>
   He said that in contrast to Bush, he would make sure that the
GOP was ``not a party of exclusion, not a party of the special
interests, not a party of these pork barrelers in Washington,
D.C.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``We've lost our way since Ronald Reagan was elected
in 1980, and I'm going to bring us back.''
</P>
<P>
   The contest in Michigan marks a turn in the primary road from
small states toward more populous, industrial states.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan, with a population of 9.8 million and 18 electoral
votes, is the most politically powerful state to host a
presidential primary so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   The four states that have already held primaries or caucuses _
Iowa, New Hampshire, Delaware and South Carolina _have a combined
population of 8.6 million and just 22 of the 270 electoral votes
needed to win the presidency.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, working to pick up the support of Michigan's influential
Roman Catholic community, picked up the endorsement of Rep. Peter
King, R-N.Y., a Catholic who had formerly pledged his support to
Bush. King said that he was switching to McCain because Bush had
demonstrated a ``willingness to take any road the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   King told the Associated Press that he decided to support McCain
after Bush spoke at Bob Jones University during the South Carolina
primary. The southern Baptist school prohibits inter-racial dating
and critics say its officials have expressed anti-Catholic
positions. About 30 percent of Michigan voters identify themselves
as Catholic, according to exit surveys in past elections.
</P>
<P>
   King said America needs ``a Reagan conservative who will not
yield to the temptation of pandering in ways that support
bigotry.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush spokesman Ari Fleischer said the Texas governor regrets
King's decision but ``respects Congressman King's right to be
wrong.''

   HALLANDALE, Fla. _ He may be a Western horse who became an
Eastern winner, and he may simply be a horse who made the most of
the ``track bias'' at Gulfstream Park that favors leaders on the
rail. But whatever he is, after his victory in the Fountain of
Youth Stakes on Saturday at Gulfstream Park, High Yield stood
Sunday at the head of the class of 3-year-olds aiming for the
Kentucky Derby on May 6.
</P>
<P>
   He still had to face several showdowns with the West Coast stars
he abandoned last week: Anees, last year's juvenile champion, who
recently returned to training after suffering a stretched tendon;
Surfside, the talented and tough filly; Captain Steve; War Chant
and The Deputy. And on the East Coast, he still had unfinished
business with Greenwood Lake, Red Bullet and More Than Ready.
</P>
<P>
   But High Yield, the leader pro tem, had a team of all-stars
surrounding him: Michael Tabor, John Magnier and Bob and Beverly
Lewis, the owners; D. Wayne Lukas, the trainer, who has won three
of the last five runnings of the Kentucky Derby; and Pat Day, the
voice of experience, as his jockey.
</P>
<P>
   As Lukas put it, ``We'll have no trouble finding our way around
Churchill Downs,''
</P>
<P>
   High Yield, who has won only three times in 10 starts,
nonetheless reminds people of Cat Thief and other stars of the
Lukas barn. He is a warrior with breeding, a son of Storm Cat with
an aggressive crew calling the shots. And Lukas left no doubt
Sunday that, East or West, he had mapped the itinerary for High
Yield en route to the Kentucky Derby.
</P>
<P>
   ``I map out plans for all our horses,'' he said, ``and we'll
keep High Yield in the East now. We know where we want to go. We're
going to follow the same route that we did with Thunder Gulch five
years ago. He won the Fountain of Youth, the Florida Derby and the
Kentucky Derby, And following the Florida Derby, I'll run him in
the Blue Grass Stakes. That's what our plans are for High Yield.''
</P>
<P>
   Other trainers tended to excuse their losses in the Fountain of
Youth by pointing out that the track favored speed all day; in
fact, all season. Seven horses got the lead in seven races Saturday
and held it, including High Yield. And any horse leading on the
inside was almost unbeatable.
</P>
<P>
   ``We can only run over the strip you give us,'' Lukas said. ``We
make our adjustments. The knock on him has been that he lets other
horses run by him. This time, he didn't let anybody run by him.''
</P>
<P>
   For that matter, neither did Hal's Hope, who ran second all the
way and finished 3\ lengths behind High Yield, nor Elite Mercedes,
who ran third all the way and finished 2{ lengths behind Hal's
Hope.
</P>
<P>
   Hal's Hope, the upset winner of the Holy Bull Stakes at
Gulfstream Park three weeks ago, had one other distinction: an
88-year-old trainer, owner and breeder, Harold Rose, who complained
that because of his age, he was getting more attention than his
horse.
</P>
<P>
   Rose said Hal's Hope would go for a rematch in the Florida
Derby. And his jockey, Roger Velez, added: ``He's going to improve.
I think he'll give High Yield a run for his money next time.''
</P>
<P>
   But several of their rivals decided not to test High Yield or
the Gulfstream ``track bias,'' which gave late-running horses
little chance to overtake the leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Ken McPeek, the trainer of Deputy Warlock, who finished seventh,
said: ``I'll just be spinning my wheels if I run him here again.
There wasn't any way that a horse was going to close on that kind
of track. He needs a track where he can come from behind, so I'll
run him next in the Spiral Stakes at Turfway Park.''
</P>
<P>
   High Yield, though, could not shake off the long-range threat
from Greenwood Lake, who made up 20 lengths in the Fountain of
Youth to finish fourth. He was still six lengths behind the winner,
but Nick Zito wasn't dissuaded.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tremendous performance, considering everything,'' the
trainer said. ``It's very hard for a closer to win here; that's the
way the surface has been for 61 years. I can't do anything to make
him stay closer. But it's amazing what he does. The Florida Derby
might be the same scenario, but racing here puts you in a better
position for things later in the year.''

TOWN DESTROYED BY '92 HURRICANE RE-EMERGES, WITH DIFFERENCES 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOMESTEAD, Fla. _ An interminably flat, hot and often windy
farming town, Homestead became lodged in the annals of natural
disasters in August 1992 when Hurricane Andrew dealt it the most
destruction experienced by any American community ever hit by a
storm.
</P>
<P>
   Homestead has still not reclaimed its old self. Andrew chased
out much of the middle class, obliterated an Air Force base that
poured more than $400 million a year into the area's economy, and
reduced houses, trailer parks and 3,000 acres of lime groves to a
horizon of sticks.
</P>
<P>
   Still, in the rubble of Hurricane Andrew, an entirely different
Homestead has begun to bloom, a transformed community that says
much about the changes that are sweeping small towns across this
state and much of the South.
</P>
<P>
   In accidental defiance of government planners and developers who
have been repeatedly rebuffed in courting investment and big
employers, the poorest of Homestead's old work force, its migrant
workers, mostly from Mexico and Central America, is rebuilding this
town, store by store, job by job, and creating a new economy. The
town has not reclaimed its former vigor, and the rising Latin
population is mainly working poor. But Homestead is hardly dying.
</P>
<P>
   Among the farm-worker families who are taking hold here are the
Berroneses. Thirty-seven years ago, Julio Berrones, now 81, his
wife, Ignacia, 77, and their 12 children moved from Mexico to a
barracks in Homestead's South Dade labor camp. Following the
harvest in a flatbed truck for several years, members of the family
picked fruits and vegetables from Florida to Michigan. With the
wages of so many, the family was eventually able to buy a
four-bedroom house in Florida City, adjacent to Homestead, for
$50,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``My mother said, `We have to mainstream the kids,''' says Eddie
Berrones, who was 3 months old when the family moved here.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Eddie Berrones, a graduate of the University of Texas, is
the executive director of a community service program for 500
children and Homestead's first Hispanic city councilman.
</P>
<P>
   A brother, Julio, is a housing contractor; Lupe, a sister, owns
a bridal boutique and a banquet business; Rosie teaches nursing;
Anita is a nursing administrator; Cesar owns Casita Tejas
restaurant on Krome Avenue, Homestead's main street; Olga has
bought the beauty salon nearby; and Juan, the oldest at 54, lives
on the mortgages he collects on homes he built as a contractor.
From the 14 Berroneses who settled here in the 1960s, Eddie said,
``we are now 108, total,'' including spouses.
</P>
<P>
   Homestead is an example of a change occurring in many small
communities, particularly in Florida and Texas, where farm workers
and other immigrants have begun to settle.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Homestead's economy is not what it was before the storm.
``People said, `Three, four years, we'll be back,''' said Jack
Levy, a commercial photographer, former president of the Chamber of
Commerce and a Homestead ``pioneer,'' as settlers of the first half
of the 1900s are known.
</P>
<P>
   ``It wasn't true,'' said Levy, who moved from Homestead, 30
miles south of Miami, to north-central Florida the year after the
storm. ``My wife said, `Enough is enough.' We lost a tremendous
number of the middle class _ those with enough income to spend on
something more than survival.''
</P>
<P>
   Many of those who left were retired residents who lost small
houses and mobile houses. Others were the 6,000 workers, civilian
and military, who lost their jobs or were transferred when the air
base was closed.
</P>
<P>
   Homestead's other big loss was the Cleveland Indians, for whom
the city had built an $18 million baseball park. The town had
leased it to the team for 20 years for spring training. But fearing
the loss of their middle-class fans, the team moved to Winter
Haven, in central Florida. Homestead spent $9 million repairing the
damage to the park but has not found another major tenant.
</P>
<P>
   The pioneers' institutions _ the churches and service clubs,
like Rotary and Kiwanis _ have shrunk. Curt Ivey, the city manager,
said membership in the high school's honors program had shriveled
with the flight of middle-class families, because many of the new
students have not had the academic preparation.
</P>
<P>
   The year before the storm, Homestead's hospital had a profit of
about $850,000, said its chief executive, Bo Boulenger. Retirees
with federal Medicare coverage have been replaced by residents who
cannot afford to pay for treatment, Boulenger said, and the
hospital has struggled financially, losing $6 million last year.
Twenty percent of the patients, he said, have no insurance.
</P>
<P>
   New ventures have moved in: A stock car race track opened, and a
Wal-Mart department store. But they did not require the trained
work force needed by companies like Lucent Technologies, which
decided to build a factory elsewhere. The population has returned
to the pre-hurricane level of about 27,000, but it is poorer and
less educated than previous residents. The Hispanic population has
climbed to about 45 percent from 30 percent in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have replaced a person making 2X with one making 1X,'' said
Bob Epling, president of Homestead's Community Bank. ``The entire
community, like ships, has gone down with the outgoing tide.''
</P>
<P>
   Less perceptibly, however, a new tide is rolling in. On Krome
Avenue, the two busiest businesses are Mexican-American restaurants
_ Cesar Berrones' and, on another corner, El Toro Taco. Many
Hispanic doctors, lawyers and real estate agents have offices on
Krome Avenue. Stores owned by non-Hispanics have also opened, but
most are antique shops, commemorating the past.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Nearby, along a one-block stretch of Washington Avenue, which is
Homestead's second-busiest street, 21 of 26 shops are now owned by
Hispanic immigrants, catering to fellow immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   Patricia Carballo, daughter of immigrants from Ecuador, owns
Agencia Azteca. She provides tax preparation services, bus tickets,
photographs for identification documents, a mail drop, translation
and help in transmitting money to Mexico and Central American
countries. While Homestead's economic planners contemplate big
schemes, like redeveloping the air base as an airport and luring
factories, Mrs. Carballo said: ``We're looking at the small
picture. We're doing one-on-one.''
</P>
<P>
   Her 29-year-old Cuban-born husband, Ernesto, manages the Mexico
Supermarket across the street. While other supermarkets have
struggled, Carballo and his brother, Sergio, the owner, have kept
expanding and adding more goods.
</P>
<P>
   The butcher shop stretches the width of the store's back wall.
None of the meat is prepackaged. Butchers prepare the meat on
order, including flat meat, for fajitas, Mexican sausage and beef
tongue. The store offers hot peppers, plantains and edible
cactuses.
</P>
<P>
   There is a road these entrepreneurs travel from the farm fields
to main street. They set up stalls in the immense Bargain Town Flea
Market on the Dixie Highway _ U.S. 1 _ that slices through town and
expand from there.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband and sons have sold in the flea market for 12
years,'' said Maria E. Rodriguez, who immigrated from Cuba and
works in the men's apparel shop on Washington Avenue that a son,
Guillermo, opened a year ago. ``Homestead changes every day, a
little bit.''
</P>
<P>
   Walter Gillis Peacock, a sociologist at Florida International
University, who studied the hurricane's effects on Homestead's
minorities, said of the immigrants: ``They're drawing on past
experience. Many are from rural communities, and rural communities
have marketplaces. The shops you see in Bargain Town are the same
shops you see in Central America and Mexico.''
</P>
<P>
   Some people here seem to resent the changing face of Homestead.
``It's the first world and the Third World, and the Third World is
winning out,'' a white saleswoman at a retail store said.
</P>
<P>
   Serious conflicts among Homestead's ethnic groups _ the
Hispanics, Haitians, African-Americans and whites _ are rare, city
officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up really never feeling any different from anyone in
this town,'' Eddie Berrones says.
</P>
<P>
   It was only after he was first elected to the City Council, in
1997, that Berrones detected some resentment. ``I realized
something different about the perceptions, the mentality of people
of other ethnic groups,'' he said. ``I'm putting it
diplomatically.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Homestead's former farm workers are moving into positions
of power.
</P>
<P>
   ``Four years ago, before I ran for the City Council,'' Berrones
said, ``we had 200 registered Hispanic voters. When I ran in
November 1997, there were 1,400.''
</P>
<P>
   Last November, when he won again, he said, ``There were 2,000.''

U.S. TO LIFT RESTRICTIONS ON ISRAELI SCIENTISTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By JUDITH MILLER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEL AVIV, Israel _ The Department of Energy has decided to lift
some cumbersome security restrictions on visits by Israeli
scientists to U.S. national laboratories, Energy Department and
other administration officials said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The decision is included in an agreement scheduled to be signed
later this week by Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson, who arrived
Sunday in Israel on a 10-day tour of energy-producing states,
mostly in the Middle East. The agreement expands scientific and
technical cooperation between Israel and the United States in the
energy area.
</P>
<P>
   Israel is on the agency's list of sensitive countries _ along
with India, Pakistan, Iraq, Iran, North Korea and other states that
have refused to forswear nuclear weapons or are suspected of
secretly pursuing unconventional arms. And so Israeli scientists
face long delays and intensive screening before they can visit the
United States' 17 laboratories run by the Energy Department, seven
of which do at least some secret research.
</P>
<P>
   The Energy Department officials stressed that the relaxation
would not apply to any secret work done at the three weapons labs
or other facilities. ``Security will never be jeopardized,'' an
energy official said.
</P>
<P>
   Security measures in general were tightened at the national labs
in the fall of 1998 at Richardson's instructions, following
allegations that Wen Ho Lee, a scientist at Los Alamos National
Laboratory, had shared secret information with China. Moreover,
some kinds of U.S.-Israeli cooperation had already suffered as a
result of Jonathan Pollard's spying against the United States for
Israel in the 1980s.
</P>
<P>
   Senior Energy Department officials said Sunday that relaxing
screening requirements for Israeli scientists engaged in joint
research projects covered by the new agreement would enhance
scientific cooperation in energy, which they said was in both
countries' national security interests. About 150 Israeli
scientists visit U.S. labs each year, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, administration officials said, easing requirements
would reward Israel for recent efforts under Prime Minister Ehud
Barak to make peace with its Arab neighbors. Finally, it would
separate Israel, a key Middle Eastern ally of the United States,
from the nations on the Energy Department's sensitive-countries
list.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson, interviewed Sunday en route to Israel from Mexico,
where he discussed with senior officials the need for lower stable
oil prices, said the new agreements would ``expand American-Israeli
ties in energy, technology, nonproliferation and scientific
exchanges.''
</P>
<P>
   Richardson's trip was part of his effort to persuade members of
the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel to lower
oil prices and adhere to schedules that will help maintain stable
prices. In this political season, the administration is feeling
increasing pressure over soaring oil prices, which reached $30 a
barrel last week.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson has acknowledged that the administration was ill
prepared for the price increases and that it should have responded
sooner. Richardson, a former Democratic congressman of Hispanic
origin from New Mexico, is said to be on a short list of people
whom Vice President Al Gore is considering as a prospective No. 2
on the Democratic ticket.
</P>
<P>
   In Israel, Richardson is to sign several documents intended to
strengthen bilateral and regional energy cooperation and
integration and to slow the spread of certain types of weapons and
the scientific expertise that produces them.
</P>
<P>
   Specifically, the energy agency and its Israeli counterpart are
to schedule a meeting for this year to review their respective
efforts to help former Soviet weapons scientists find new
nonmilitary jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has spent tens of millions of dollars to keep
Russian scientists gainfully employed, and to keep their deadly
expertise away from terrorists.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   One new agreement, known as a nonbinding letter of intent,
provides for joint cooperation to enhance detection of underground
nuclear tests, which are banned by the Comprehensive Test Ban
Treaty. The Senate refused to approve that treaty last year, but
the administration has vowed to continue abiding by its provisions
while searching for better ways to detect undeclared nuclear tests.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has long refused to sign the 1968 Nuclear
Nonproliferation Treaty, whose non-nuclear member states forswear
programs to acquire such weapons, in exchange for assistance with
their civilian nuclear-power programs. Israel is believed to have a
varied, sophisticated nuclear arsenal, but it has consistently
refused to discuss its nuclear-weapons programs publicly.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, Richardson is scheduled to visit Egypt, a
leader of Arab efforts to persuade Israel to give up nuclear
weapons and sign the nonproliferation treaty. Despite their
differences over nuclear issues, Egypt has agreed to help Israel,
which has few indigenous energy sources, meet its growing power
requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Partly to reward Barak's efforts to renew the peace negotiations
that were badly damaged by his predecessor, Egypt announced in
December that it would restore a ``peace pipeline'' project to
carry natural gas across the Sinai Desert to Israel and to the
Palestine Authority. The project had been stalled since 1996 after
strains developed between Israel and its Arab peace partners.
</P>

   MITROVICA, Yugoslavia _ Angry Serbs stoned, punched and kicked
U.S. troops in the northern, Serb-dominated district of this town
Sunday, forcing them to beat a hasty retreat and cut short their
part in a citywide search for weapons. German troops also came
under a hail of stones in the same area.
</P>
<P>
   More than 2,000 troops from 12 countries were deployed at dawn
to search apartments and buildings for weapons and explosives in
both the Serbian and Albanian parts of this bitterly divided mining
town of some 90,000 people. It was one of the biggest operations
mounted by NATO-led peacekeepers in Kosovo and an attempt to curb
the violence that has seen 11 people killed and dozens wounded
since Feb. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Part of a U.S. company of 350 men sent up to the north of Kosovo
on Saturday for the operation headed into northern Mitrovica just
after 6 a.m., working with French troops and the U.N. police to
search buildings.
</P>
<P>
   Mitrovica is Kosovo's most volatile spot. Just a few miles south
of the border with Serbia proper, it in effect is where the
Albanian-dominated province ends and Serbia begins.
</P>
<P>
   Serbian news media regularly denounce U.S. policy in the
Balkans, and hold the Americans most responsible for NATO's bombing
war over Kosovo last spring.
</P>
<P>
   And Sunday, it was the Americans who immediately encountered
Serb hostility. First, the Serbs objected to an Albanian
translator, who was withdrawn for her safety, said Capt. Russell
Berg, a public affairs officer who was at the scene.
</P>
<P>
   An hour later, as the troops finished searching one building, a
noisy crowd at a crossroad began to throw snowballs, stones and
bottles at the troops, Berg said. The U.S. commander, Col. Michael
Ellerby, waded into the crowd alone to talk to the Serbs' leader,
Oliver Ivanovic, and appeal for calm.
</P>
<P>
   For a moment, his tactic seemed to work. Then something sparked
the violence, and Serbs began jostling and jeering. Ellerby had to
be plucked out by the Italian riot police, and French troops moved
to contain the crowd. Suddenly, the Serbs broke through the French
cordon, and U.S. troops made a quick dash for their vehicles,
according to Harald Doornbos, a reporter for National Dutch Radio
who was with the U.S. troops.
</P>
<P>
   ``Serbs were punching these GIs, and they were guarding
themselves with their rifle butts,'' he said. ``The Serbs just went
berserk, and then the Americans suddenly left us and ran for their
vehicles.''
</P>
<P>
   Spc. William Putnam, who was in the search unit attacked by the
Serbs, said later: ``They were very belligerent. They wanted to
make a scene. They wanted to push us to a point where we took
action.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans did not react, however, and pulled out under a
hail of heavy stones and kicks from the crowd, crossing the river
into the southern, Albanian half of town, which remained calm.
Several of the Americans' Humvee vehicles showed cracked windows
from the blows of heavy stones. One soldier suffered a broken nose,
and another a chipped tooth, Berg said.
</P>
<P>
   German troops who moved their troop carriers through the crowd
after the Americans were also pelted with stones. By contrast, the
French, whom Albanians have accused of showing a pro-Serb bias
here, arrived to cheers from the Serbs.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was commanded by the French, who control the
northern sector of Kosovo, but was personally supervised by the
overall commander of the peacekeepers, Gen. Klaus Reinhardt of
Germany. He has made a point of involving different nations to try
to avoid antagonism and accusations of bias.
</P>
<P>
   French troops have come under frequent stoning attacks from the
Albanians who dominate the southern half of Mitrovica. Last
weekend, two French soldiers were wounded in a firefight with
Albanians.
</P>
<P>
   Serbs have meanwhile threatened violence against the British
troops who are deployed on a bridge dividing the city. It was not
clear who decided that U.S. troops should move into the Serbian
area for the search operation, but Ivanovic said it was asking for
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   ``People are not so happy because they are Americans, and
because the Americans are more aggressive in the way they search,''
Ivanovic said. ``Their attitude is: `We are here; we have power; we
are in charge.' People were not afraid, but they were angry.''
</P>
<P>
   Four Serbs were slightly wounded, Ivanovic said, two from Mace
sprayed in their faces, and two from slight head cuts, apparently
from rifle butts. Together with the U.N. police, U.S. troops had
smashed open doors in a students' hostel, wrecking the place
unnecessarily, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Public affairs officials said the U.S. troops had finished their
search and were redeployed to another area of the city, so the
fracas did not stop the overall operation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We decided to redeploy the troops because we wanted the
operation to go on,'' said Lt. Col. Patrick Chanliau, a French
spokesman, stressing that the aim was to search for weapons, not
move against people.
</P>
<P>
   Yet the haul of weapons was small: 10 Kalashnikov assault guns,
four bolt-action rifles, a machine gun, a pistol, seven blocks of
plastic explosives and one grenade.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   French troops and gendarmes continued where the Americans had
left off, moving quietly and without disturbance into apartment
buildings and an old school inhabited by Serbian refugees from
Croatia. They were heavily armed, and wearing body armor.
</P>
<P>
   They were searching specific apartments that had fallen under
suspicion, a French policeman said, asking that his name not be
used. ``We find a lot of arms hidden in the cellars, and hidden in
the furniture,'' he said, showing how he had just discovered two
Kalashnikovs in one apartment, the magazines tucked under a sofa
and the two weapons inside a folding bed. Several women and
children were tidying up after the search, apparently unfazed. But
several Serbian men outside were still angry. ``This is
occupation,'' said Milan Ivanovic, the deputy director of the local
hospital. ``French or Germans or Americans, they are all occupiers.
They want to throw Serbs out of Serbian land. They want us to have
no protection against the Albanians, they want us out of here.''

NOW VALENTINE KNOWS HIS CONTRACT TALKS MUST WAIT UNTIL SEASON'S
END 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By TYLER KEPNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   PORT ST. LUCIE, Fla. _ It was news to Manager Bobby Valentine
Sunday when reporters told him that the Mets' co-owner, Fred
Wilpon, planned to wait until after the season to address
Valentine's contract extension.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now I know _ good,'' said Valentine, adding that he planned to
talk to Wilpon himself. ``Now that I heard it, I understand it. I
don't particularly like hearing it, but it is what it is.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what it is: a distraction, and already a prominent one
for a team that is only beginning full-squad spring-training
workouts on Monday. Valentine and Steve Phillips, the Mets' general
manager, are in the last year of three-year contracts, and the
issue is likely to linger until it is addressed by Wilpon and his
partner, Nelson Doubleday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will explore that at the end of the year when the contracts
are up,'' said Wilpon, who was at the Mets' training camp Sunday.
``That does not take anything away from the job they've done to
date. I think both of them have done excellent jobs. Nelson and I
are both very pleased with what they've done, but we're going to
wait until the end of the year to address it. It is highly likely
that we will ask them, and hopefully they will want to remain part
of the organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Valentine, who signed his three-year, $2 million contract during
the 1997 season, said he had not been told why the Mets will not
consider another in-season negotiation. Wilpon said he was trying
to minimize distractions by waiting, in hopes that people would
focus on games instead of contract talks. But if there was pressure
on a person in the last year of a contract, Wilpon acknowledged
that that might be a good thing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I haven't found that to be a bad thing in life, having to meet
the expectations,'' said Wilpon, who said his expectations were to
reach the World Series. ``I've found that to be a motivator _ and
both of those guys are internally motivated, self-starters.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that, Valentine paused and reflected on the
characterization of him as self-motivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that's very proper,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Valentine said last week that if asked the wrong question at the
wrong time, he could say something that would make for ``one heck
of a story.'' Wilpon said that comment did not concern him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Bobby, like all of us _ myself, anybody in the organization _
has to be accountable for their actions and/or their words,''
Wilpon said. ``Bobby's a professional and Steve's a professional,
and they'll handle this and get on with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips said he already knew his contract would not be
discussed until after the season. If Valentine did not, Phillips
said, there must have been a miscommunication.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the assumption I've been functioning under since the
issue was addressed last fall,'' Phillips said. ``I guess I'm not
bothered by it. My view is I understand what the situation is, and
I'll wait until it's addressed and do the best job I can so that
when it is addressed, hopefully I'll get an extension.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was named general manager during the 1997 season,
Valentine's first full season as manager, and the Mets won 88 games
that year. They won 88 again in 1998, then reached the playoffs
last year by winning 97 games. Phillips said there was ``no way''
he would make his own issue a public one, and had no comment on
reports of his uneasy relationship with Valentine. But he offered a
positive evaluation of his and Valentine's performances.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Bobby's done a good job,'' Phillips said. ``We've come
a long way as an organization and I think he's an important and
major contributor to the success of the organization the last few
years. I think I've done a good job, too.''
</P>
<P>
   Wilpon said the potential sale of the Mets _ a topic on which he
would not comment _ was not a factor in the decision to wait on
contracts for Valentine and Phillips. He said the organization was
regularly approached by ``major corporations, Internet companies,
all kinds of people'' wanting to buy into the team, but added he
had no intention of turning over day-to-day operations of the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not going to happen, period,'' Wilpon said. ``I am never
going to not be involved, by my choice, with the New York Mets.''
</P>
<P>
   But, Wilpon was asked, could the team still be sold?
</P>
<P>
   ``We could do a strategic alliance, whatever,'' said the
63-year-old Wilpon, ``but I want to be involved with this team, and
I want to continue to be involved, as long as my health is good,
which it is, and as long as I enjoy it, and the trials and
tribulations.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those ongoing trials is the stadium issue, on which the
Mets have done a year's worth of preparation, Wilpon said. A new
ballpark, to be built in the Shea Stadium parking lot, could be
ready two and a half years after financing is worked out with the
city, he said. City officials have approached the Mets about
scaling down the $500 million project, which includes a retractable
roof and a playing surface that rolls out of the stadium when
baseball is not being played. The Mets, Wilpon said, are not
changing their plan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think that does for us or the city what we're all
trying to do,'' Wilpon said. &QL;

DRUG MAKERS AND INSURERS LOCK HORNS OVER MEDICARE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By ROBERT PEAR   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A fight between the pharmaceutical and insurance
industries over how to expand Medicare to cover prescription drugs
is imperiling bipartisan efforts in Congress to offer drug benefits
to the elderly this year.
</P>
<P>
   The dispute is being played out behind the scenes on Capitol
Hill, as insurance lobbyists conduct briefings for congressional
aides to shoot down the ideas being floated by drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   The disagreement creates political difficulties for Republican
members of Congress, who have historically been close to both
industries. It also complicates the work of Democrats, who have put
prescription drugs high on their agenda for the year.
</P>
<P>
   Drug companies, eager to avoid a big new government program,
want insurance companies to offer drug coverage to Medicare
beneficiaries, with federal subsidies to help low-income people pay
the premiums.
</P>
<P>
   But insurance companies say they want nothing to do with such a
venture, because they fear drug costs for the elderly will grow
much faster than either premiums or the proposed federal subsidies.
Insurers say the government will strictly control the premiums for
such coverage, and they fear they will be blamed if a private
drug-insurance plan fails to meet expectations.
</P>
<P>
   The top lobbyist for the drug industry, Alan F. Holmer,
president of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of
America, said: ``You can get insurance for almost anything _
earthquakes in California, tornadoes in Kansas, hurricanes in
Florida. You can get insurance for long-term care, cancer,
infertility, sports accidents. Why not pharmaceutical insurance
coverage?''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Charles N. Kahn III, president of the Health
Insurance Association of America, said: ``Private drug-insurance
policies are doomed from the start. The idea sounds good, but it
cannot succeed in the real world.''
</P>
<P>
   For Congress to pass legislation over the objections of either
industry would be difficult. Both have extensive networks of
political contacts.
</P>
<P>
   Political action committees formed by drug and insurance
companies gave $18 million to political parties and candidates for
federal office last year, favoring Republicans over Democrats by
nearly 2-1, according to data reported to the Federal Election
Commission and tabulated by the Center for Responsive Politics, a
nonpartisan research group.
</P>
<P>
   In the last year, the two industries have also spent tens of
millions of dollars on lobbying and advertising intended to
influence the debate in Congress.
</P>
<P>
   For about eight months, pharmaceutical companies have been
promoting the idea that Medicare should be ``modernized'' to
provide drug benefits through competing private health plans and
insurance companies. This approach has emerged as a favorite option
for many Republicans and some Democrats, who want to use the
private sector to deliver drug benefits to the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   The pharmaceutical industry says that it would like to see drug
benefits provided as part of a comprehensive plan to redesign
Medicare, but that it would support federal legislation to provide
elderly people with so-called pharmaceutical insurance coverage as
an interim step this year.
</P>
<P>
   Kahn said insurers did not want to take on the risk of
underwriting drug insurance because the costs were unpredictable
and the people most likely to buy it would have high drug expenses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those who expect to receive the most in benefits will purchase
such insurance immediately, while those who expect to have few
claims will forgo purchasing it,'' Kahn said.
</P>
<P>
   Drug company executives said they were puzzled and frustrated by
insurers' insistence that they could not sell insurance to meet a
serious national need.
</P>
<P>
   ``Almost everybody else agrees that private health plans should
be used in some way to deliver Medicare drug benefits, but the
insurance industry is lobbying against the idea,'' said Lisa J.
Raines, senior vice president of the biotechnology company Genzyme.
``That's unfathomable.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin A. Corry, director of federal affairs at AARP (formerly
known as the American Association of Retired Persons), said the
``spitting match'' between the two industries showed that ``the
private sector is not going to be able to provide prescription drug
benefits'' on the scale required by the elderly.
</P>
<P>
   ``Drug companies don't want the federal government to set
prices,'' Corry said. ``Health insurance companies don't want to
insure against the risk. Unless the federal government steps in and
bears the risk, this problem won't be solved.''
</P>
<P>
   Medicare finances health care for 39 million elderly or disabled
people. It generally does not pay for drugs outside the hospital,
even though drug therapy accounts for a rapidly growing share of
all medical care.
</P>
<P>
   One-third of Medicare beneficiaries have no insurance to cover
drug costs. Many of them pay full retail prices because they do not
get the large discounts offered to health maintenance
organizations, hospitals and other bulk purchasers of prescription
drugs.
</P>
<P>
   Even with such discounts, employer-sponsored health plans report
that their annual drug spending increased between 15 percent and 18
percent in each of the past two years.
</P>
<P>
   Insurance companies already sell insurance to fill gaps in
Medicare. Such policies pay deductibles, the patient's share of
doctors' bills and certain other expenses not covered by Medicare.
Drug company executives say they suspect that the insurers'
opposition to drug insurance is motivated in part by a desire to
protect the profits they earn from this Medigap insurance.
</P>
<P>
   Insurers acknowledge that this is a factor, but they have other
concerns as well. They say they fear that if they offer
free-standing drug-insurance policies, the premiums will be
strictly regulated by federal and state government agencies and
they will be required to sell such insurance at similar rates to
all Medicare beneficiaries, including those with disabilities and
chronic illnesses.
</P>

</P>
<P>
   Cecil D. Bykerk, executive vice president and chief actuary of
Mutual of Omaha Cos., said, ``I'm convinced that stand-alone drug
policies won't work.''
</P>
<P>
   Mutual of Omaha sells Medigap insurance to more than 200,000
people, but no longer offers policies with drug benefits. ``It was
not a good business for us, and we didn't think it was a good value
for beneficiaries either,'' Bykerk said of the Medigap policies
with drug benefits.
</P>
<P>
   In most states, Medigap insurers can charge higher premiums to
older customers. But sometimes the extra premium for drug coverage
equals or exceeds the maximum benefit payment for drug expenses.
Two of the 10 standard Medigap policies pay up to $1,250 a year in
drug benefits. But people over 75 often pay more than $1,200 a year
in additional premiums to get such coverage.
</P>
<P>
   Blue Cross and Blue Shield provide Medigap insurance to more
than 5 million Medicare beneficiaries.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Nell Lehnhard, senior vice president of the Blue Cross and
Blue Shield Association, said: ``It's not feasible, from a business
perspective in a voluntary market, to offer stand-alone drug
benefits. Even with a generous subsidy, the premiums will be so
high that healthy people will drop out, and the only people buying
insurance will be those with high drug expenditures.''
</P>
<P>
   Drug company lobbyists insist that Congress could solve this
problem _ for example, by giving beneficiaries an opportunity to
buy drug insurance for a modest price when they first become
eligible for Medicare.

YANKEES LOOK TO YARNALL FOR COMPETITIVE CONSISTENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TAMPA, Fla. _ If Ed Yarnall's professional self-esteem was built
on what others thought of his raw ability, he would be in serious
trouble. He knows hitters watch him warm up and see him in the same
open-mouthed way lions view a zebra. He knows because he has heard
their taunts.
</P>
<P>
   He bores scouts, and he understands this: When Yarnall was a
high school senior, the Yankees called to tell him they had drafted
him, and they never called again, never making an offer. But now,
at 24, Yarnall is projected by the Yankees as their No. 5 starter _
with confidence, because the more they have seen from Yarnall, the
more they like him.
</P>
<P>
   Hideki Irabu, whom Yarnall is expected to replace in the
rotation, threw much harder than Yarnall, by as much as 10 miles an
hour. Irabu's split-finger fastball has more movement than anything
Yarnall throws, and on any given day, Irabu is capable of throwing
a two-hitter. But the Yankees believe that Yarnall will give them
uniform effort and competitiveness, something Irabu never did.
</P>
<P>
   With Irabu, said Mel Stottlemyre, the Yankees' pitching coach,
``you were always guessing which guy was going to show up.''
</P>
<P>
   ``What you hope for is consistency,'' Stottlemyre said.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre was unimpressed by Yarnall last spring, but his
feelings have changed since then, after watching Yarnall at the end
of last season. ``He definitely has the ability, and his makeup is
good _ he seems to be very solid there,'' Stottlemyre said. ``He's
a good listener, a good watcher.''
</P>
<P>
   And, above all else, he is deceptive. He does not throw hard,
but he overpowers hitters. He has an understated mound presence,
but those who know him best say he is a determined competitor who
embraces a challenge. He has been traded twice, first by the Mets
to the Florida Marlins in the deal for Mike Piazza and then by the
Marlins to the Yankees in a swap for third baseman Mike Lowell. But
now the Yankees consider him close to untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll always figure out a way to win,'' said Skip Bertman,
Yarnall's coach at Louisiana State. ``If he runs into trouble, he
will make the adjustment and he will always figure out a way to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall throws a fastball in the range of 88 to 92 mph, average
in the major leagues. The nature and the deception of Yarnall's
delivery is often compared to that of Sid Fernandez, the former
left-hander for the Mets. Like Fernandez, Yarnall's most prominent
feature in his left arm action, from the vantage point of the
hitter, is his elbow.
</P>
<P>
   As most pitchers begin to drive homeward in their delivery, the
ball is held at the end of the outstretched hand, as Lady Liberty
holds her torch. But what a hitter sees, as he faces Yarnall, is
the bend in his elbow. Behind the bend is Yarnall's hand and the
ball, obscured, until Yarnall's elbow rotates quickly and the ball
is suddenly en route to the plate. There is little visual warning
for the hitter; in effect, Yarnall's delivery knocks out the
hitter's long-range radar. There is no arm extension for the hitter
to track.
</P>
<P>
   Ray Ripplemeyer, a pitching coach in the Mets' system, watched
Yarnall pitch several times and noticed that even when he was not
throwing hard, right-handed hitters constantly fouled the ball into
the stands along the right-field line _ late swings, because the
hitters just did not see the ball coming out of Yarnall's hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you first see him, he's one of those guys you want to
jump on, as a hitter,'' said Jorge Posada, the Yankees' catcher.
``You're like, `OK, this is a cookie.' Then six or seven innings go
by and he's still out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Posada and Tim Lanier, who was Yarnall's catcher at Louisiana
State, both say the left-hander throws what is known as a heavy
fastball. It hits the catcher's glove with extra life, generating a
dull thud, and Lanier and now Posada have felt that heaviness in
their hand.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's smart in the way he used his fastball, too,'' said
Bertman, who saw Yarnall transform from a freshman disappointment
to a sophomore star, with the same steady progression. ``He'd move
it around, go upstairs, sink it. He wasn't always throwing hard,
but he knew how to use it.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall's potential revealed itself to Stottlemyre and Manager
Joe Torre at Anaheim last Sept. 5. Recalled from Class AAA Columbus
_ where he went 13-4 with a 3.47 earned run average and generally
dominated the International League _ Yarnall started a game against
the Angels and got a 7-2 lead. But Chuck Knoblauch made an error in
the sixth, Yarnall walked two hitters, and the bases were loaded
with nobody out. Rather than panic and try to overpower hitters,
Yarnall conceded a run, tried to generate ground balls and pitched
to preserve the lead. ``That made a great impression on
everybody,'' Stottlemyre said. ``It wasn't so much that he got out
of it, but how he got out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   They saw a part of him that they had never seen before, a
competitiveness that had always been apparent to his mother and
stepfather. Pitching in Little League, Yarnall hit some batters
unintentionally.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not my problem,'' the 10-year-old told John DiMartino,
who married Yarnall's mother when the boy was 4 and has always been
close to his stepson. ``It's my plate, and they need to get off of
it. They need to get out of the way.''
</P>
<P>
   He thrived on that, the competition. There were times when other
children stopped by the house and asked if Ed wanted to play, his
mother, Fran DiMartino, recalled, and Ed declined, preferring to
throw a baseball against a fence in the backyard or hit off a tee.
``If he lost, he was pretty good-natured about it,'' she said.
``But he would want to go back and play even harder the next
time.''
</P>
<P>
   Yarnall pitched against Austin Peay in the National Collegiate
Athletic Association tournament one year, and one hitter had taken
too much time before an at-bat, delaying the game. Yarnall walked
halfway to home plate and snarled, ``Just get in the box.'' He
completely intimidated the guy, Lanier thought, and the batter
struck out on three pitches.
</P>
<P>
   ``The way I look at it, the hitter is definitely your enemy,''
Yarnall said. ``He's up there trying to get a hit off of you;
you're trying to get him out. If you are a pitcher _ especially
with the way the hitters are today, the size of them _ you've got
to get a little mean.''
</P>
<P>
   Some hitters have tried to intimidate him as well, mocking his
stuff. ``The guy has nothing out there,'' they have yelled, loud
enough for Yarnall to hear. He really doesn't care what they think.
</P>
<P>
   ``I understand I'm not a guy who throws 94, 95,'' Yarnall said.
``I'm not a guy with a conventional windup. You wouldn't teach the
way I pitch to anybody. I'm definitely not one of those guys where
people in the stands are going to be like, `Wow, this guy is going
to win the Cy Young award, he's going to be the next Clemens.' I
don't have that kind of stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I do have the stuff that surprises you, whether it be in a
game or over time, and I don't have a problem with that, as long as
I get hitters out.'' &QL;

CLINTON IS JUDGED AVERAGE, BUT LOWEST IN MORALS 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ When it comes to American presidencies, Bill
Clinton's two terms have been fair to middling, a survey of U.S.
historians has found.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton finished 21st overall in the presidential ranking, but
when it came to ``moral authority'' the historians put him at the
very bottom among the nation's 41 chief executives, one rung below
former President Richard Nixon, who resigned in disgrace.
</P>
<P>
   The 58 historians, who came from across the political spectrum,
responded to a survey by C-Span, the cable television network that
has broadcast presidential portraits over the last year. The survey
is to be released on Monday, Presidents' Day.
</P>
<P>
   The historians ranked Abraham Lincoln first for his crisis
leadership, administrative skills, vision, pursuit of justice and
``performance within the context of the times.'' He was followed by
Franklin Delano Roosevelt, George Washington, Theodore Roosevelt
and Harry S. Truman.
</P>
<P>
   Ronald Reagan was ranked 11th, while other recent presidents,
George Bush (No. 20), Clinton (No. 21), Jimmy Carter (No. 22),
Gerald Ford (No. 23) and Nixon (No. 25) were grouped toward the
middle.
</P>
<P>
   But the White House spokesman, Joe Lockhart, said it will be the
historians of the future, not those of today, who will best judge
the Clinton presidency.
</P>
<P>
   ``It often takes the passing of time to understand the full
meaning of one's leadership ability,'' Lockhart said.
</P>
<P>
   As for his boss' dismal rating on moral authority, Lockhart
said, ``I suspect that that's more a reaction to reading the
tabloids than a fair reading of history.''
</P>
<P>
   The lowest-ranked presidents were William Henry Harrison, Warren
G. Harding, Franklin Pierce, Andrew Johnson and, last, James
Buchanan.
</P>
<P>
   Among those surveyed were the presidential historians Stephen D.
Ambrose, Douglas Brinkley and David Kennedy.

OIL PRICE SURGE RAISES FEARS OF INFLATION SPIKE 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By JOSEPH KAHN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For the past year, even as the price of oil tripled
to $30 a barrel from a record low of $10, policy makers, economists
and many in the oil industry itself hewed closely to the same line:
oil does not matter much anymore.
</P>
<P>
   Technology, which depends much less on energy than
manufacturing, now drives economic growth. OPEC, the once fearsome
cartel of oil producing countries, had become impotent. And oil,
the old king of commodities, seemed to have no more power to sway
the American economy in the Internet age than cotton or copper.
</P>
<P>
   Such thinking was, and to a certain extent remains, conventional
wisdom. But it has taken only a few weeks of $2-a-gallon heating
oil, $20 airline ticket surcharges and $60 bills to gas up the
sport utility vehicle to make people wonder if oil is really so
irrelevant after all.
</P>
<P>
   The surge in oil prices has ignited a debate about whether the
economy is as immune to an old-fashioned commodity as many had come
to believe and, if not, whether oil could pose a threat to the
record American economic expansion. The surge has also made
Washington nervous about the intentions of oil-producing countries
for the first time since the Persian Gulf war, when oil last
crested at $30 a barrel.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration, under pressure from Congress and
angry consumers in New England, has sent the energy secretary to
petition Middle East ministers, who are about to hold important
strategy talks, to release more oil. The administration also is
debating whether and how to intervene in the market and push prices
down, perhaps by allowing oil companies to borrow from the
Strategic Petroleum Reserve, a supply generally reserved for war.
</P>
<P>
   The oil price spike has also registered at the Federal Reserve.
Alan Greenspan worried last week about low oil stocks and the
``substantial negative consequences'' of high oil prices. Core
inflation remains remarkably subdued, running last month at just
1.9 percent. When energy costs are factored in, however, inflation
expanded at a 2.7 percent rate, meaning that oil costs alone pushed
inflation 0.8 percent higher than it would otherwise have been.
</P>
<P>
   With the Fed already nervous about the bubbly stock market and a
shortage of workers, higher oil prices seem likely to reinforce the
tendency toward raising interest rates to cool the economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the macro sense, oil prices do not endanger the economy the
way they once did,'' said Energy Secretary Bill Richardson, who is
currently touring six oil-producing nations. ``But we cannot ignore
the potential for oil to have an impact on inflation. What OPEC
does matters.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil suddenly re-emerged as an economic and political threat
mainly because of things happening abroad. Some of the factors that
brought oil down to record lows in late 1998 have had the reverse
impact in recent months. The main one is oil-hungry Asia. The sharp
recession in Asian economies beginning in 1997 foreshadowed a
collapse of oil prices. Their speedy recovery recently has created
hefty demand and contributed a great deal to the price surge.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, oil producing nations, their solidarity in
tatters as recently as 1997, have engineered a period of strategic
harmony unseen since the Arab oil embargo of 1973. Saudi Arabia,
Kuwait, Iran, Mexico and Venezuela have so far stuck to production
cutbacks agreed to when prices were in the cellar. Not unlike in
the 1970s, experts these days deconstruct every public statement by
world oil ministers for hints that more oil will start flowing
soon.
</P>
<P>
   Economists and OPEC watchers are split on whether the oil
problem will persist. Many believe prices have peaked, with oil
ministers already sending signals that they intend at least some
increase in output. If that proves true, then today's high oil
prices will probably be seen as nothing more than a temporary
disturbance. The conventional wisdom about oil will seem truer than
ever.
</P>
<P>
   But there is also a much less rosy outlook that sees oil
supplies remaining tight for a couple of years, until non-OPEC
producers respond by drilling for new oil. Prices would hold at
current levels or even jump higher. That would fuel inflation and
repeated interest rate increases by the Fed. In the worst case,
higher interest rates would push the economy into recession.
</P>
<P>
   In that event, oil, having helped prompt downturns in the early
1970s, the early 1980's and the early 1990s, would once again
become the bete noire of the American economy.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have just started to wake up,'' says Philip K.
Verleger, who monitors the oil industry for the Cambridge,
Mass.-based Brattle Group. He sees oil prices rising to at least
$33 a barrel by year-end if oil exporters increase production,
closer to $40 a barrel if they do not. ``We have a serious problem
now and it could get worse.''
</P>
<P>
   The outcome will depend in part on a series of meetings among
oil producing countries beginning late this month and ending with
OPEC's semiannual strategy session in Vienna on March 27. By that
time, Clinton administration officials said, it should be clear
whether oil producers are willing to sacrifice windfall oil profits
to help keep economic growth on track in the United States, Europe
and East Asia, powerful economies that import most of their oil.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Oil ministers in Saudi Arabia and Mexico, balancing their own
profits against a desire to keep Western economies strong and
defend oil's share of energy production worldwide, have both said
that they consider a price range of $20 to $25 a barrel more
appropriate than $30 a barrel. But administration officials are
pressing for details of how they intend to get there. ``We are
trying to pin them down on real commitments to increase output,''
an official said.
</P>
<P>
   Richardson visited Mexico on Saturday, where he met with Luis
Tellez, the energy minister. He will also see Saudi, Kuwaiti and
Norwegian ministers in coming days.
</P>
<P>
   Though U.S. officials seem optimistic that the March meetings
will lead to at least some increased output, the question is how
much. With oil inventories at record lows relative to demand, the
International Energy Agency estimates that OPEC would need to
increase output by nearly 10 percent just to keep pace with world
demand.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say oil producers are debating
increases of 1.2 million to 3.1 million barrels a day, or 4.5
percent to 12 percent from production last month. Only increases at
the high end of that range would alleviate the squeeze, they say.
</P>
<P>
   Even then, relief may not arrive in time for the summer driving
season. It takes at least six weeks for fresh production in the
Middle East to pass through refineries and reach neighborhood gas
stations. Some analysts believe that gas could hit an all-time high
of $2 a gallon this summer, though forecasting oil prices is as
much soothsaying as science.
</P>
<P>
   The broader question is how long oil-producing nations will hang
together. For years, OPEC looked more like a bazaar than a cartel,
with nonstop haggling and rampant cheating undercutting public
pledges of cooperation. But Saudi Arabia, the heavyweight of the
oil-producing world, brokered a reconciliation during the Asian
economic slump in 1998, after oil prices had collapsed.
</P>
<P>
   Crown Prince Abdullah and Ali Naimi, the country's oil minister,
have restored Saudi leadership of world oil producers, analysts
say. They improved relations with Iran. They lured Mexico and
Venezuela into a partnership. Most significantly, the once-defiant
Saudis agreed to reduce their own oil output. OPEC-wide production
cuts of about 7 percent stuck.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the strongest agreement oil producers have had for
many years,'' said Luis E. Gusti, the former president of Petroleos
de Venezuela, the national oil company, and now a senior fellow at
the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.
``I think it has an opportunity to hold together, though you can
never rule out leaks.''
</P>
<P>
   Though oil producers do not seem to agree on how much to
increase production, they are not fighting the way they once did,
an administration official said. ``They intend to keep their
unity,'' the official said.
</P>
<P>
   None of that makes oil the threat to the United States that it
was 25 years ago. The American economy has gone through a
revolution since then. Manufacturing accounted for almost
one-fourth of economic output in the mid-1970s, compared with
one-sixth now. Factories and utilities use less oil for each dollar
of production than they did then.
</P>
<P>
   The decline in oil's importance is more dramatic than that. It
takes less oil to send an e-mail message across the country than to
send a letter the same distance, and electronic communication is a
better gauge of economic activity in this country than the postal
service. Over all, the United States spent about 3 percent of its
gross domestic product on oil in 1998, compared with nearly 9
percent in 1980.
</P>
<P>
   Still, some analysts say the lesson of the latest price spike is
that oil is not yet just another commodity. Every American depends
on oil products every day, to keep warm, move around, wrap food and
ship packages.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, some of the most prized luxuries during this country's
period of prosperity are energy hungry. Homes of 6,000 square feet
with cathedral ceilings and large windows and sport utility
vehicles with 44-gallon fuel tanks and 5.4-liter engines can make
for alarming energy bills when oil is expensive.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are three things that can get people worried about
inflation and spook the stock market,'' said Daniel Yergin, an
expert on oil at Cambridge Energy Resource Associates. ``They are
the price of labor, the price of money and the price of oil.''
</P>
<P>
   Oil can also be a powerful drag on rich economies. The
Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development, the club of
the world's wealthiest countries, estimates that every $10 rise in
the barrel price of oil lifts inflation by half a percentage point
and reduces economic growth by a quarter-point. The OECD also
estimates that inflation in developed countries has nearly doubled
to 2 percent from 1.1 percent a year ago, with the price of oil
accounting for the difference.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been through too many oil shocks to take them
unseriously,'' Greenspan told Congress last week. ``If the price
changes, it has a major impact on the economy.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ When Sen. John McCain of Arizona describes the people
who shaped his life, he invariably dwells on the influence of his
father and grandfather, both distinguished Navy admirals and
larger-than-life figures. Less widely known are the roles played by
two other powerful men in launching his political career.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's father-in-law, a wealthy beer baron named James W.
Hensley, gave McCain his first job out of the Navy and helped
bankroll his crucial first race for Congress in 1982, enabling
McCain, a political newcomer, to outspend and defeat better-known
opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, McCain's position as one of the wealthiest members
of Congress is derived from his wife's share of her family's
Anheuser-Busch beer distributorship here and extensive real estate
investments through the company, holdings worth more than $10
million.
</P>
<P>
   In his rise to political influence, McCain, who had no ties to
Arizona until he married Cindy Hensley and moved here in 1981, also
won the critical blessing of the city's business establishment
through his close friendship with another of the state's power
brokers, Darrow Tully, the publisher then of the state's dominant
newspaper, The Arizona Republic. ``Duke'' Tully led an ad hoc group
of business executives and self-appointed political kingmakers
known as the Phoenix 40, whose backing helped McCain in that first
congressional race and assured his Senate victory four years later.
</P>
<P>
   ``In 1982,'' said Bruce Merrill, a professor at Arizona State
University, who conducted polls for McCain's congressional race
that year, ``a lot of party leaders felt John was an outsider and
he won a narrow victory largely because he had access to family
resources and the support of The Arizona Republic.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, McCain is running for the Republican presidential
nomination as a champion of campaign finance reform and an opponent
of special interests. Yet a look at his rapid ascension shows that
his early career was founded on special-interest money, and that he
might never have emerged from the competitive world of Arizona
politics without the steadfast backing of this city's political and
business establishment.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those people have remained important benefactors.
Hensley family members and employees have contributed more than
$80,000 to McCain's campaigns since 1982, according to federal
election records, and he has collected tens of thousands more from
businesses based in Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   Despite his family's financial ties to the beer business, McCain
has not supported the liquor industry in Congress and has publicly
excused himself from voting on measures affecting the business,
according to anti-liquor groups.
</P>
<P>
   McCain had thought of going into politics before moving to
Arizona. In 1976, three years after his release from a North
Vietnamese prison, he briefly considered running for Congress from
Florida, where he was stationed with the Navy.
</P>
<P>
   He was then transferred to Washington as the Navy's liaison to
the Senate, and his appetite for politics grew. He was a charming
war hero, and a skilled public speaker, and he also built up strong
political connections in Washington. Still, as a third-generation
Navy man, he had not lived in any one place for long, and he lacked
a political base.
</P>
<P>
   That changed after he met Cindy Hensley, his second wife. McCain
went to work in public relations for Hensley &AMP; Co., his
father-in-law's beer distributorship. It was his first job outside
the Navy. People who knew McCain then said the job was merely a
means for him to meet people in the state, and lay the groundwork
for his political career.
</P>
<P>
   ``Hensley had the Budweiser distributorship for the entire state
and he didn't need any PR,'' said William Shover, a retired
executive at The Arizona Republic, who met McCain in those early
days. ``They created a job for him.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Acquaintances describe Hensley as an astute businessman who
never sought the limelight even after he became one of Arizona's
richest men. Still, while he could give his only child's husband a
job, he could not give him entree into the political and business
elite. The liquor industry was never part of the civic hierarchy,
and Hensley's own past was not a ticket to the establishment.
</P>
<P>
   In World War II, Hensley was a bombardier on a B-17 shot down
over the English Channel. After the war, he went to work for Kemper
Marley Sr., a rancher who had grown rich and powerful selling
liquor after Prohibition.
</P>
<P>
   In 1948, while working for the Marley operation in Tucson,
Hensley and his brother, Eugene, were convicted of filing false
liquor records and conspiracy in the illegal distribution of
several hundred cases of whiskey. James Hensley received a
suspended sentence and Eugene was sentenced to a year in a federal
prison camp. Five years later, James Hensley and Marley were
charged with violating federal liquor laws again, but they were
acquitted.
</P>
<P>
   In 1955, James Hensley acquired the Anheuser-Busch
distributorship for Arizona, and fueled by the state's rapid growth
and booming economy, he built it into Arizona's 12th-largest
privately held business and one of the nation's largest Budweiser
distributorships. The company sold nearly 20 million cases of beer
last year and has 500 employees. It also has diversified into real
estate holdings throughout Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   The business remains in family hands, but Hensley, now 80 and in
poor health, has gradually withdrawn from the day-to-day
operations. He declined to be interviewed for this article. Cindy
McCain draws an undisclosed salary as the company's vice chairman
and a major shareholder, but she is not involved in the daily
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Along with contributions to McCain's campaigns, Hensley &AMP; Co.
employees have been generous donors to state legislators. In 1992,
a former lobbyist accused the company of making contributions to
state legislators in the names of its employees, an illegal tactic
known as bundling. Company officials denied the accusation, the
former lobbyist withdrew it, and no one from the company was
charged with any wrongdoing.
</P>
<P>
   After his arrival in Phoenix, McCain did not have to wait long
for his chance at politics. Rep. John Rhodes, a veteran Republican
from the Phoenix suburb of Mesa, decided not to seek re-election in
1982.
</P>
<P>
   McCan defeated two longtime Mesa Republicans in the primary,
including a state senator, and he went on to win the general
election. He defused accusations that he was a carpetbagger by
saying the place he had lived longest was Hanoi.
</P>
<P>
   Records show that he outspent his opponents in part through
access to his wife's family wealth. He received $11,000 in
contributions from Hensley and company employees. More
significantly, though he had little money of his own because he had
been a career naval officer, his wife's fortune allowed him to loan
$167,000 to the campaign, which was permissible under campaign laws
then.
</P>
<P>
   Additional money was raised by another powerful Phoenix
businessman who served as a big benefactor, Charles Keating Jr.,
the corrupt savings and loan operator whose ties to McCain continue
to haunt the senator. Years later, McCain intervened with federal
regulators on behalf of Keating's savings and loan, an episode that
has tarnished the senator's reputation as a reformer.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's wife and father-in-law retained an 8 percent interest
in a shopping center project put together by Keating in 1986 until
the project was sold in 1998.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's financial disclosure filing with the Senate
indicated that the investment was sold for a profit of between
$100,000 and $1 million. But Robert Delgado, president and chief
executive of Hensley &AMP; Co., said Cindy McCain and her father lost
half of the $360,000 they invested and that the transaction was
reported as a gain because of complexities in congressional
disclosure requirements.
</P>
<P>
   Delgado also challenged published reports suggesting that
Keating had set up the investment as a favor to the senator.
Delgado said he himself had proposed the investment after a
discussion with one of Keating's lawyers in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   Still, thanks to her father's business, Cindy McCain, 45,
remains wealthy. She has a 37 percent share of the family business
and holds a stake in its profit-sharing and pension plans worth
$250,000 to $500,000, a share in the corporate jet valued at more
than $1 million and Anheuser-Busch stock worth at least $1 million,
according to McCain's financial disclosure forms. The couple's four
children own 23 percent of the company through trusts.
</P>
<P>
   The McCains live behind gates and security cameras in a
sprawling house on Central Avenue in Phoenix that once belonged to
her parents, who live nearby.
</P>
<P>
   The Hensley money was not the only key to McCain's first
victory. He gained much-needed credibility from the editorial pages
of The Arizona Republic and The Gazette and their publisher, Duke
Tully.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM BEGINS)
</P>
<P>
   Tully was a far different patron from Hensley. A swaggering,
fun-loving 6-foot-4, he was comfortable with business executives
and politicians alike. Tully, an accomplished pilot, loved to
regale people with tales of his exploits flying jet fighters in the
Korean and Vietnam wars. His house and office were filled with
photographs of him alongside all manner of military aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'd point to his teeth and say, `See these? They're steel. I
lost the others when I crashed,''' recalled Pat Murphy, a former
columnist and editor at The Republic.
</P>
<P>
   Like McCain, Tully was a recent transplant, having been hired
away from the San Francisco newspapers in 1979 to modernize and
improve the two Phoenix newspapers, The Republic and the
now-defunct Gazette, both owned by Central Newspapers. So it was
natural that Tully hit it off with McCain, the former Navy pilot
and prisoner of war.
</P>
<P>
   (OPTIONAL TRIM ENDS)
</P>
<P>
   ``I was introduced to John at a private club in Phoenix shortly
before he married Cindy,'' Tully said in a telephone interview from
his home in Florida. ``He is an extremely likable guy and I had a
lot of hero worship for him.''
</P>
<P>
   After McCain's marriage, the McCains and the Tullys spent a lot
of time together socializing and vacationing. Tully is the
godfather of Megan, McCain's first child with Cindy.
</P>
<P>
   More important for McCain's career, Tully's position as
publisher meant he was already a fixture among the city's movers
and shakers and he eagerly championed McCain with the Phoenix 40 as
well as on the editorial pages of the newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was a very, very strong John McCain advocate,'' Tully said.
``He was basically picked by the power structure as the guy who
could get it done, and I helped with that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Phoenix 40 was an unofficial group made up of the city's
leading businessmen _ bankers, partners from the largest law firms,
chief executives and, of course, executives of newspapers. The
group was created in the early 1970s by Eugene C. Pulliam, the
conservative founder of Central Newspapers and grandfather of
former Vice President Dan Quayle.
</P>
<P>
   The goal was to promote policies that its members felt were good
for the city and state as Arizona expanded from a quiet rural state
to a Sun Belt powerhouse.
</P>
<P>
   It was also the closest thing to a political machine in Phoenix,
and anointment by the Phoenix 40 almost invariably translated into
victory at the polls.
</P>
<P>
   Merrill, the Arizona State professor and political observer,
said the power was exercised quietly and effectively.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you control the major newspaper, the TV stations and the
people who make most of the political contributions,'' Merrill
said, ``you have enormous influence''
</P>
<P>
   Tully harnessed that influence to McCain's political career from
the outset, leapfrogging him over Republicans who had waited
patiently for a shot at Rhodes' seat in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   ``There was a lot of resentment among Mesa Republicans, none of
whom had ever heard of John McCain until he was suddenly the
designated hitter,'' said Terry Goddard, a Democrat and former
mayor of Phoenix.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won a close race for the vacant seat and retained it
easily in 1984. When the opportunity arose for his next big step,
Tully was ready again.
</P>
<P>
   In late 1985, Sen. Barry Goldwater, the state's revered
Republican leader, indicated he was planning to retire, and a huge
battle was anticipated for his seat. The leading candidate was
expected to be the popular Democratic governor, Bruce Babbitt, who
is now secretary of the interior. Babbitt, however, already had his
eye on a run for the presidency, and Tully and his colleagues threw
their weight behind McCain.
</P>
<P>
   As Tully explained it last week, the city's elite thought it
would be better to have McCain in the Senate and Babbitt in the
White House.
</P>
<P>
   Shover, a member of the Phoenix 40, and Merrill both said the
organization's backing of McCain was instrumental in his Senate
victory in 1986.
</P>
<P>
   But the newspaper publisher who had helped so much was not there
to savor the victory. The day after Christmas 1985, after rumors
began to circulate that Tully was not all he claimed, he
acknowledged that he had never served in the military and he
resigned from the newspaper and left Arizona. But the war hero for
whom he had done so much was well launched on his political career.

 &HT;    Jarrett wins the Daytona 500
 &HT;    By Michael Carvell
 &HT;    c. 2000 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Who wants to be a millionaire? Dale
Jarrett, who crossed up long-time friend Mark Martin and jilted
Johnny Benson to win the Daytona 500 on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, the 1999 Winston Cup champion, applied a nifty maneuver
with four laps remaining in the season-opener and had the victory
clinched two laps later when the caution flag was raised.
</P>
<P>
   The Ford No. 88 driver's win was his third in circuit's biggest
race. By the winning the Winston No Bull million, he pushed his
paycheck to $2.5 million. As part of the No Bull promotion, fan
Melissa Brown of Pittsburgh also received a $1 million bonus.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tell you what, that's the money car,'' Jarrett said. ``It
won a million dollars at Talladega in `98, won another million
here, won a another million for (Brown). Man, this is fantastic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett left the garage area Saturday night with his car
battered and bruised. But his crew put in overtime and rolled out
what looked like a brand new car to the starting line 50 minutes
before the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredible job,'' Jarrett said. ``That's where the
credit goes, to those guys for getting it back. The car drove just
like it had been ... just as good as it was before.''
</P>
<P>
   Just like he has every time a green flag has been dropped on a
Winston Cup race for the past two weeks, Jarrett left his
competitors to decide the also-ran positions. Some of them weren't
too happy.
</P>
<P>
   Martin said Jarrett reneged on a radioed deal between the two
crews and hung him out on the high side of the race track.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got lied to,'' said Martin, who dropped from second to fifth
when Jarrett went to the front without him.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I was in Mark's position, I'd feel the same way,'' Jarrett
said. ``But when I looked up and saw Jeff Burton, knowing he had
Bill Elliott right behind him, I was getting ready to lose my spot
for sure and didn't know how far back I would go. All I wanted to
do was to protect my position.''
</P>
<P>
   At Daytona and Talladega, where NASCAR mandates restrictor
plates, two cars together run faster than one alone. The problem is
getting drivers to work together. But in the Bud Shootout
exhibition last Sunday, Jarrett went one way _ to victory _ and his
teammate Ricky Rudd went the other _ on his roof.
</P>
<P>
   Dale Earnhardt and his son Dale Earnhardt Jr. both exited their
cars Sunday complaining about a lack of assistance from the other.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett was part of five-car fleet of Ford Tauruses that
overtook Pontiac No. 10 driver Johnny Benson, a surprise front
runner, in the closing laps. After the green flag was displayed on
lap 197, Jarrett faked high on the second turn. Benson set up for
the block, but helplessly watched Jarrett sweep by low with a boost
from Jeff Burton.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, minus a drafting partner, was sucked all the way to the
back of the pack and finished 12th. It was a bitter ending for the
good-natured driver who was only two laps from the first win of his
career.
</P>
<P>
   After holding the lead for nearly two laps, Jarrett clinched the
victory when Jimmy Spencer wrecked in turn four and brought out the
caution flag for the final pair of laps. Jarrett was followed by
Burton and Dawsonville's Bill Elliott.
</P>
<P>
   On the way to the pits after the race, Martin motored up to the
side of Jarrett's car for several seconds. Jarrett said he didn't
seem too happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``(Martin) didn't shake his fist, and he didn't give me the
finger,'' Jarrett said. ``He threw his hands up like `what
happened?' And I totally understand that. I would've been the same
way.''

`A CONSPIRACY OF PAPER': MONEY AND MURDER ON THEIR MINDS 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: Changes ``his father's and William Balfour's pasts'' to ``his
father's and William Balfour's father's pasts'' in 2nd sentence of
7th graf.)

(lb) 
 By CHRISTOPHER LEHMANN-HAUPT   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Near the beginning of David Liss' strikingly authentic-sounding
first novel, ``A Conspiracy of Paper,'' which is set in London in
1719, there is mention of a character ``profiting in his
speculation, taking advantage of the fluctuations in the markets
caused by the rivalries between the Bank of England and the South
Sea Company.''
</P>
<P>
   Immediately you assume the conspiracy of paper mentioned in the
novel's title must somehow refer to the famous South Sea Bubble or
Scheme, which involved a plan to buy up England's national debt in
return for a trading monopoly in the South Seas and in South
America, and which led to a speculative frenzy and England's first
stock-market crash, in 1720.
</P>
<P>
   Well, this turns out to be not literally the case. The events
surrounding the Bubble are not mentioned until the novel's final
page. But in a figurative sense the novel's subject is the South
Sea scheme. For in Liss' rich historical imagination, a London
ripening for investment hysteria comes vividly to life.
</P>
<P>
   The narrator of the story is Benjamin Weaver, born Lienzo, a
former boxer known as the Lion of Judah because he is Jewish, who
has given up the ring for work as ``protector, guardian, bailiff,
constable-for-hire and thief-taker,'' this last duty being most
lucrative, Weaver explains, ``for by bringing felons to justice I
received not only the reward of my hirer but also the considerable
forty-pound reward of the state as well.''
</P>
<P>
   His memoir begins with a visit to his lodgings by one William
Balfour, who is convinced not only that his own father, an apparent
suicide, was actually murdered but also that Weaver's father,
Samuel Lienzo, a stock-jobber from whom Weaver had long been
alienated, shared the same fate. Balfour wants Weaver to
investigate. Weaver, though put off by Balfour's anti-Semitism,
agrees for the sake of the fat fee.
</P>
<P>
   He is upset by the subject of murder, because of his own
responsibility for a man's death while he was handling another
unsavory assignment: the retrieval of a purse from a prostitute for
Sir Owen Nettleton, a baronet with a weakness for night life who
wants his purse back for a packet of compromising letters it
contains.
</P>
<P>
   At first the reader is puzzled over what the connection, if any,
may be between Sir Owen's letters and the possible murders. But as
Weaver reconciles with the survivors of his family and begins to
explore his father's and William Balfour's father's pasts, the
mysteries pile up so thickly that it's hard to keep any connections
straight.
</P>
<P>
   Happily, the plot draws you in from page to page, just as Weaver
is enticed by his beautiful in-law Miriam, the widow of his cousin
Aaron, who died when a trading vessel sank. And the author has the
leisure to explore every aspect of early 18th-century London life
from the precarious relations of Jews with English society to the
way the underworld was organized to the behavior of people high and
low.
</P>
<P>
   In a concluding historical note, Liss writes that in the
language of his novel he has tried to suggest the rhythms of
18th-century prose, which seems evident in amusing passages like
the following, in which Weaver comments on his life after the ring.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a shame that I did not anticipate the pugilists of today
who, like the famous Jack Broughton, in their retirement open
fighting academies to train the young bucks that would take their
place. Broughton has indeed been ingenious enough to construct a
piece of apparel he calls mufflers _ a kind of voluptuous padding
for the fist. I have seen these things, and I suspect to be hit by
a man wearing these gloves is quite like not being hit at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Liss further writes in his afterword that his novel grew out of
his work as a doctoral candidate at Columbia University, ``where my
research focused on the ways in which 18th-century Britons imagined
themselves through their money.''
</P>
<P>
   He continues: ``After years in the archives, reading pamphlets,
poems, plays, periodical essays and long-forgotten novels, I failed
to find the source that told me precisely what I wanted to know
about the new finance. So I wrote one. My goal in this novel has
been to capture both the unbridled enthusiasm and the pervasive
anxiety of the period leading up to the South Sea Bubble.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps the anxiety overwhelms the enthusiasm as Benjamin Weaver
battles the mysterious forces that try to keep him from the truth.
But ``A Conspiracy of Paper'' is an evocation of English history
that you can happily get lost in for days.
</P>

DODGERS STILL SEARCHING FOR THEIR ANGEL
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BRIAN DOHN  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VERO BEACH, Fla. - Angel Pena is considered the Dodgers catcher
of the future, which translates into the Dodgers catcher next
season. But before that can happen, the discipline must improve.
</P>
<P>
   Serious questions about the talented young catcher's future are
being raised after he reported to spring training weighing 262
pounds, well above his listed weight of 228.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll learn one way or another,'' Dodgers manager Davey
Johnson said. ``If you're really blessed with a lot of talent, that
overrides whatever condition you're in. But at a certain level, and
he hit that level last year, the big leagues, it takes a large
commitment to get to that extra level.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have that ability, you may never get there because
people pass you by because you have to be able to do certain things
at that level or you're not going to get there. You learn, or you
don't make it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers bought out Todd Hundley's option for the 2001 season
after he was acquired from the Mets during the 1998 offseason to
ensure he wouldn't ask for a trade, but with the understanding
Pena, 25, could be ready to catch next season.
</P>
<P>
   That's still the plan, but the current development brings
uncertainty. It was evident during conditioning drills the first
few days of camp. Pena lagged behind the rest of the catchers. He
also had trouble finishing some drills.
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands what's at stake,'' general manager Kevin Malone
said. ``He shows signs of being committed. We're going to work with
him to help him be consistent in his dedication and commitment
level. I think he wants it, but I don't think he's ever been taught
what it really takes to be the best he can be.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan was for Pena to catch all season at Triple-A
Albuquerque, but Johnson hasn't ruled out using Pena as Hundley's
backup.
</P>
<P>
   However, the current situation isn't great considering the way
Pena's 1999 season concluded. He was sent to the minors because of
poor work ethic, then was suspended for seven games after missing
team meetings and refusing to catch in the bullpen. His season
ended with a stint on the disabled list with a right elbow sprain.
</P>
<P>
   Pena said his weight gain came after he finished playing winter
ball in the Dominican Republic. He already has dropped five pounds
in three days thanks to extensive conditioning work that begins
before the team workouts.
</P>
<P>
   ``I come in every morning and work because I know maybe next
year I could have that job,'' said Pena, who hit .208 with four
homers for the Dodgers in 1999. ``I want it. I have to try and lose
weight. That's my job. I have to. I know Hundley's going to be a
free agent, and I don't know if he's going to sign, so I have to be
ready.''
</P>
<P>
   Business-like Brown: For just the second time since leaving
Texas in 1994, Kevin Brown is returning to a team for consecutive
seasons. And after a season in which expectations were astronomical
because of that huge contract, Brown's arrival at Dodgertown this
spring was very quiet.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good in that it's not starting from scratch again with a
new team, new faces and have that get-acquainted phase,'' Brown
said. ``It's not like everything's different where you have new
coaches, new players.''
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Brown's first spring with the Dodgers, there is much less
talk of winning titles. Instead, there's a much more calm and
workmanlike atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
   ``Looking at it, I think we're trying to move in the right
direction,'' said Brown, who went 18-9 with a 3.00 ERA last season.
``I think it's the situation now where it's time to keep your mouth
shut and let's do it all on the field instead of talking about it
and giving it mouth and lip service. Let's see how things pan out
on the field.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. _ As the bitter fight for the Republican
presidential nomination shifted to Michigan, Sen. John McCain on
Sunday leveled scorching and sustained attacks on Gov. George W.
Bush's reform credentials, while his rival stayed upbeat and
campaigned as if he were already in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Just one day after Bush's double-digit victory in South Carolina
decisively restored the Texas governor to front-runner status, it
was as if the two candidates had exchanged the roles they had
played in the nearly three-week-long campaign in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was Bush who was sunny, once more talking about where he
wanted to lead the nation and his vision of ``a positive,
optimistic, hopeful tomorrow.'' And it was McCain who was
ferociously trying to tar his opponent as a fraud, much as he did
in his caustic concession speech the night before.
</P>
<P>
   At rallies, on his bus and in several television appearances,
McCain sought to reclaim his image as the reform candidate in the
race, and he went after Bush as aggressively as the Texas governor
had targeted him after the senator won the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain assailed Bush on a variety of fronts, from campaign
finance overhaul to regulation of health maintenance organizations,
from his tax cut proposal to state spending in Texas. Several times
during the day the senator said derisively, ``If he's a reformer,
I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   On his campaign bus, he heaped even more scorn on Bush. ``We're
not letting you get away with that, pal,'' he said. ``You're not a
reformer. Anybody who believes you're a reformer believes in the
tooth fairy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked later about such comments, Bush said, ``It sounds like
Senator McCain spent a lot of time talking about me.''
</P>
<P>
   With Michigan and Arizona holding their primaries Tuesday, and
Bush and McCain having spent virtually all of the past two weeks in
South Carolina, they have precious little time to make an impact on
voters here. McCain is expected to win his home state. But the big
unknown here in the critical industrial state of Michigan is
whether its voters will ratify Bush's decisive win in South
Carolina or show an independent streak of their own.
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken on the eve of the South Carolina primary showed the
two men running neck and neck in Michigan, but there was no time to
calculate whether Bush's 11-point victory Saturday would alter the
landscape for Tuesday's primary. The state is now critical for
McCain, who must prove he is something more than a one-state wonder
who benefited from New Hampshire's maverick streak.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, Bush's aides believe that the victory and its
margin allowed him to adopt a new campaign posture. Throughout the
day, he mentioned President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore more
than he mentioned McCain, and his references to the senator came
mainly in response to reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought of McCain's concession speech Saturday, in
which McCain used words like ``pretense'' and ``an empty slogan of
reform'' to describe Bush, the governor said, ``All of us have to
react to our victories and defeats in our own ways.'' He added, ``I
think the American voters, the people of Michigan, are going to
have to judge how each of us handles adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp was confident that the governor's South Carolina
success would go a long way toward propelling him to victory in the
approaching round of big state primaries. They were also looking to
benefit from the fact that Michigan is the first contest where Bush
has a sitting governor _ John Engler _ working strenuously for him.
</P>
<P>
   But Michigan is less dominated by religious conservatives than
South Carolina, and McCain's aides argued that its blend of
working-class ethnic voters and regular Republicans would prove
more fertile ground for their candidate. They also said that
because of the short time period they would be able to run about
even with Bush in spending on television commercials, even though
outside groups have already weighed in here against McCain as well.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' McCain reached out to Catholic
voters when he was asked about Bush's appearance at Bob Jones
University, a center of the Christian right in South Carolina. He
said his rival should have spoken out against ``the things you've
said in the past about the pope and other religious leaders that
are disgraceful. Let's get into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On his bus, he also placed a thank-you phone call to Rep. Peter
King, a Long Island, N.Y., Republican who announced Sunday that he
was switching his allegiance from Bush to McCain. King, who is
Catholic and from a heavily Catholic district, has complained about
Bush's appearance at Bob Jones.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's new posture, it was clear Sunday that not all of
his and his supporters' aggressive tactics had been left in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   A harsh negative ad by the National Smokers Alliance that
assailed McCain for advocating a huge tax increase (without
mentioning the fact that it was a tax on tobacco) was being
broadcast here as it was in South Carolina. And Bush himself has at
least one ad running in Michigan that mentions McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also used the phrase ``Kervorkian's lawyer'' Sunday to
refer to Geoffrey Fieger, a Democrat who ran against Engler, the
governor, in 1988, and who has been running radio ads criticizing
Bush and Engler as ``dumb and dumber.'' Bush described Fieger, who
has in fact represented the assisted-suicide advocate Dr. Jack
Kervorkian in his murder trials, as ``the most liberal of liberal
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As he did in South Carolina, Bush used a surrogate to help him
attack McCain, in this case Engler. ``McCain has absolutely courted
some of our _ he's fraternized with some of the worst people,
politically speaking, they're our sworn foes,'' Engler said in one
appearance. ``He has tried to bring some of them in to influence
the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also reached out _ briefly _ to Christian conservatives,
who helped provide his margin of victory in South Carolina, as he
worshiped in a church in Grand Rapids. That part of western
Michigan has perhaps the densest concentration of religious
conservatives in a state that is otherwise largely Catholic and not
particularly fundamentalist.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an appearance in Southfield, at Lawrence Technological
University, Bush made one of his most energetic speeches in weeks.
``Listen to me now,'' he told the crowd. ``There are 260 days more
to no more Clinton-Gore!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides said that their candidate had made several
mistakes in South Carolina, straying from his winning themes of New
Hampshire to run a campaign that focused too heavily on political
technique as he talked about abandoning negative ads or complained
about ``push-polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, appearing at rallies to the theme song of ``Star Wars,''
the senator let his enthusiastic audiences know that he would not
let his loss in South Carolina stop him. He made references
throughout the day to his years as a prisoner of war in North
Vietnam, locked away in the infamous ``Hanoi Hilton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends,'' he said to several hundred cheering suppoorters
at Michigan State University, ``I lived in a hotel once where there
were no mints on the pillow. I know how to take a punch and I know
how to fight back.''
</P>
<P>
   He highlighted his congressional record of battling against
pork-barrel spending. Then, borrowing a line from onetime candidate
Steve Forbes, McCain repeatedly charged that state spending in
Texas had gone up under Bush, though he used two figures _ 34
percent and 36 percent. Under Clinton, he said, federal spending
had gone up 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now who do you want? A big-spender nonreformer or a guy with a
record?'' he asked the Michigan State audience.
</P>
<P>
   He also skewered Bush on the isssue of money in politics. ``In
five and a half years, as the governor of the state of Texas, he
did not propose a single campaign finance reform proposal in a
state where anything goes,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator showed no remorse for an attack ad, which he
had removed from television in South Carolina, that challenged
Bush's truthfulness and compared him to Clinton. The senator has
now pledged to run no negative advertising throughout the primary
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McCain insisted that Bush had distorted the truth ``when he says
that I'm not a reformer, when he says that I'm a hypocrite, when he
says that I'm in the pocket of lobbyists.''

SPORTS COLUMN: A PROPOSAL TO ALLOW A PRO TO PLAY AGAIN IN COLLEGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By WILLIAM C. RHODEN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A basketball player leaves high school and immediately turns
pro. Maybe he or she is enticed by money, maybe by bright lights.
The year turns out to be a nightmare: the player does not play, is
maladjusted and miserable, and begins to long for college.
</P>
<P>
   Under existing National Collegiate Athletic Association
regulations, the player is out of luck, having forfeited youth,
innocence and, most of all, college eligibility. The player has
become a ``lost professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Now the NCAA is promoting a body of legislation that it claims
will save ``lost professionals'' by allowing those ``who make a
mistake in judgment to rectify it and be eligible to participate in
the NCAA for at least some period of time.''
</P>
<P>
   After studying the situation for two years, the NCAA's
Amateurism and Agents Subcommittee is proposing to change the
amateur rule. Under the proposed deregulation, an athlete can
compete in organized professional sports after high school
graduation and still maintain intercollegiate eligibility. For each
subsequent year in ``organized sport,'' one year of eligibility is
lost. The player who leaves the pro ranks to return to college must
sit out one season before competing.
</P>
<P>
   This is a radical about-face by an organization that has
steadfastly wrestled with, legislated and policed amateurism for
decades. Now, in one dramatic proposal, the NCAA is seeking to
smash an amateur model it helped create.
</P>
<P>
   Christine Grant, chairwoman of the Amateurism and Agents
Subcommittee, said, ``This is an examination of what we've been
practicing as amateurism and a rejection of the concept that money
changes one automatically from an amateur to a professional.''
</P>
<P>
   This proposal is certain to lead to a battle, the likes of which
have not been heard since the debate over initial-eligibility
standards _ propositions 48 and 42. These debates will be even more
rancorous because the proposal affects the lifeblood of the college
sports industry: recruiting.
</P>
<P>
   The proposed rule expands the recruiting territory, putting
greater emphasis on agents and advisers to guide athletes through
an ocean of options that will be available as a result of
deregulation: Do I go to the National Basketball Association? Do I
go Europe? The Continental Basketball Association? The
International Basketball League?
</P>
<P>
   ``Our coaches are thinking: `We're already recruiting high
school and junior colleges,''' said Jim Haney, executive director
of the National Association of Basketball Coaches. ``Now they've
got to scout high school games, IBL games, CBA games. They have to
go to Europe to scout professional leagues.''
</P>
<P>
   The rule already exists in tennis. In fact tennis became the
driving force for change because college coaches complained about
foreign athletes who played overseas, came to the United States and
enrolled in college as freshmen, even though they were 23 and 24
years old and had competed for several years as professionals, as
defined by the United States amateur code.
</P>
<P>
   The tennis governing bodies felt that these European players had
a decided advantage over ``true freshmen'' who did not interrupt
their education in order to play sport. To make it fair, the
amateurism subcommittee proposed legislation allowing high school
seniors to go on tour for a year, giving them a grace period to
compete in professional sport and still maintain four years of
eligibility. The current proposal removes the one-year limit on the
grace period.
</P>
<P>
   There is a tremendous difference between tennis and basketball.
``Among coaches there's a concern with what we call the
professional gunslinger,'' Haney said. ``You've got this guy who's
been a pro, coming back for a year or two to help a team win the
conference or go to the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``The second concern is that you create a difference. All of a
sudden these guys come back, they've got automobiles; they've got
money in their pocket. You have two different kinds of
student-athletes in your program: one guy who's sitting there with
a bunch of money in the bank, the other guy who's limited to
tuition room, board and books.''
</P>
<P>
   The basketball coaches will meet with an NCAA representative
next month in Indianapolis during the Final Four. The NCAA
subcommittee will hold an informational tour with member
conferences during the spring and summer. The proposal will go to
the NCAA Management Council in October. The proposal will go out
for comment for 60 days. Then the subcommittee will make a
presentation during the January convention. There will be a final
review in April 2001 by the Management Council, then back to the
NCAA board of directors that spring for final passage.
</P>
<P>
   By the spring of 2002 we might have our first Pro-Am Final Four.
</P>
<P>
   Grant says that is an exaggeration and underscored the need for
education.
</P>
<P>
   ``The more chance we have to educate the people, the more chance
it has of passage,'' Grant said.
</P>
<P>
   Grant said the feedback from revenue-producing sports has been
harsh. ``We hear that we are out to destroy sports,'' she said.
``We've been accused of that. But we're out to make sports better
for the student-athletes.''
</P>
<P>
   The more the NCAA says it is trying to help, the faster coaches
back away. They follow a dictum as old as the association itself:
Beware of NCAA committees bearing gifts. &QL;

MOISO STRUGGLES, AND SO DO BRUINS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JON WILNER  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ A month ago, UCLA sophomore forward Jerome Moiso
had one eye on the All-Pac-10 team and the other on the NBA draft.
In a three-game stretch against North Carolina and the Arizona
schools, Moiso averaged 21 points and 10.7 rebounds and was
unstoppable in the low post.
</P>
<P>
   The second time, Moiso's slumping, and so are the Bruins.
</P>
<P>
   In his last three games (Syracuse and the Arizona schools),
Moiso is averaging 6.7 points and five rebounds. The Bruins lost
all three.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to be more aggressive,'' Moiso said. ``I have to get
back to what was working for me earlier in the season, and that's
creating shots for myself.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt. I'm struggling.''
</P>
<P>
   Moiso's natural state is passive. Only when he forces himself to
be aggressive, to carve position in the low post, demand the ball
and take it strong to the basket - only then does he produce
consistently.
</P>
<P>
   In recent games, he hasn't established position, hasn't called
for the ball and hasn't taken it strong. He had several shots
blocked or altered at Syracuse. He took two shots at Arizona State
and four at Arizona, and he was not a presence in the paint in
either game.
</P>
<P>
   A source close to Moiso said he's reconsidering his NBA plans
and might return for his junior year.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jerome and Dan (Gadzuric) are the biggest keys to the team,''
guard Earl Watson said. ``But Jerome is Jerome. He's not going to
play great every game.''
</P>
<P>
   Moiso, 6-10, is not solely to blame. The Arizona schools
double-teamed him the second time around, and the Bruins don't
always give him the ball when he's open.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe I need to gain weight to be more visible,'' he joked.
</P>
<P>
   The bottom line: If Moiso's not aggressive, he won't score
consistently, and if he doesn't score consistently, UCLA won't win
five of its final six gams and make the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Lonely at the top: The gap between star freshman Jason Kapono
and his floundering teammates widens each game. In the desert,
Kapono scored 51 of UCLA's 159 points and took 36 of its 120 shots.
Without him, the Bruns would have lost each game by 40 points.
</P>
<P>
   Kapono is worried teammates and fans consider him selfish.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm the consummate team player, but I just want to win,''
Kapono said. ``I'd be happy to have no points and 10 assists if it
meant we'd win.''
</P>
<P>
   Young update: Reserve guard Ray Young bruised his tailbone early
in the second half Saturday and did not return. He dressed gingerly
and was dreading the flight home, but he expects to play Thursday
against Oregon.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was trying to block Michael Wright's shot when someone took
out my legs and I went down parallel,'' Young said. ``My tailbone
was the first thing to hit the floor.''
</P>
<P>
   By the numbers: Kapono has lost as many games this season (11)
as he did in four years at Artesia High. ``It's frustrating,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA's Sagarin rating dropped from 39th to 42nd after its
disaster in the desert. That's not good enough for an at-large bid.

MONEY
</HEADLINE>
  
 AS TOP FUND-RAISER, BUSH BUILDS `FIREWALL' AGAINST McCAIN MADE OF (rk) 
 By DON VAN NATTA Jr. and JOHN M. BRODER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In the South Carolina primary, Gov. George W. Bush
reaped the enormous benefits of his overstuffed campaign treasury,
which allowed him to refuse federal matching funds and spend as
much as he needed to win.
</P>
<P>
   And while his heavy spending in South Carolina and elsewhere has
depleted much of the money he collected earlier, he is still in a
position to significantly outspend the McCain campaign for the next
few weeks, even as he launches a new round of fund raising.
</P>
<P>
   According to the estimates of several senior Republican
fund-raisers, Bush's campaign spent roughly $5 million in South
Carolina on an aggressive campaign that flooded the airwaves with
attacks against Sen. John McCain and the winning message that the
Texas governor is ``a reformer with results.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The stakes were high, and the campaign made an all-or-nothing
bet that turned out to be a very smart bet,'' said one long-time
Republican fund-raiser who is a Bush supporter.
</P>
<P>
   Because McCain has no choice but to accept federal matching
funds, his campaign was forced to abide by the state's spending
cap. Sunday, McCain blamed his defeat on being outspent. ``Governor
Bush has raised more money than any campaign in history and they've
spent more money,'' McCain said on NBC's ``Meet the Press.'' ``One
of the reasons why we had a little trouble getting our message out
in South Carolina _ because we were outspent 5-, 6-, 10-to-1.''
</P>
<P>
   The margin might not have been that great, and it may be months
before each campaign's spending totals in South Carolina are
revealed. Bush's campaign said Sunday that it spent $3.1 million on
advertising, compared with the $2.8 million the McCain campaign
said it spent. But those figures do not include the costs of phone
banks, direct mail pitches, staff, travel and other campaign costs,
or the expenditures by independent interest groups who joined the
fray.
</P>
<P>
   Most of all, the emphatic Bush victory in South Carolina
illustrates the overarching importance of money in this year's
presidential campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``If there is a Bush firewall in this presidential election, it
turns out to be money, not South Carolina or any other individual
state,'' said Fred Wertheimer, a campaign finance expert and the
president of Democracy 21, a nonpartisan public policy group here.
``Bush's financial flooding of South Carolina is the first
on-the-ground, concrete example of just what his huge money
advantage really means in this election.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the pace of his spending, Bush still holds a strong
financial edge over McCain. In Michigan, the Bush campaign intends
to outspend McCain by more than 25 percent; the Bush campaign
expects to spend $2.6 million on advertisements compared with the
$2 million that the McCain campaign said it planned to spend.
</P>
<P>
   And that spending difference could widen in some of the 13
states that have Republican contests on March 7, such as New York,
California, Massachusetts and Missouri.
</P>
<P>
   Scott McClellan, a Bush spokesman, declined Sunday to disclose
how much money the Bush campaign had in the bank.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has about $8 million remaining. That figure includes more
than $6 million in matching funds the campaign says it has
qualified for but has not yet received. Since the New Hampshire
primary on Feb. 1, the McCain campaign has raised $3.5 million on
the Internet. The campaign has also received $70,000 since the
polls closed in South Carolina, McCain advisers said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain is scheduled to appear at two fund-raising events in
California later this week. Aides say those events should raise
several hundred thousand dollars, but they concede that they will
probably be dramatically outspent in Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've definitely come down off my high,'' said Dan Schnur, the
communications director for the McCain campaign.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the Bush campaign is scrambling to organize at least
a half-dozen fund-raisers between now and mid-March. One Republican
fund-raiser said there were plans for events in New York, Florida
and Richmond, Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Bush defended the rate of spending, saying the cash was used for
television commercials that have not yet gone on the air in crucial
primary states such as California, Michigan, Virginia and
Washington.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been in every state, and when you talk about spending
money, what we're talking about is spending pre-advance
expenditures,'' Bush explained on ABC's ``Good Morning America''
program last Friday. ``We're running ads and an organization in
California, for example, where the race begins March 7th. I like
where we are, and that's part of our strategy.''

ANALYSIS: CONSERVATIVES PLAYED BIG PART IN BUSH'S SOUTH CAROLINA
VICTORY 
</HEADLINE>
  (sw) 
 By R.W. APPLE Jr.   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLESTON, S. C. _ On the morning after a sobering defeat in
South Carolina, Sen. John McCain of Arizona complained bitterly
that his rival, Gov. George W. Bush of Texas, had been swept to
victory on a tide of misleading commercials.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, the senator said, sent ``a negative message of fear.''
</P>
<P>
   But a detailed analysis of voter surveys carried out by a
consortium of television networks and The Associated Press showed
that there was more to it than that. Bush did indeed succeed in
drawing a new, unfavorable picture of McCain in the minds of voters
here; he also convinced many of them that McCain bore more
responsibility than he for any mudslinging.
</P>
<P>
   But McCain got the worst of things in any number of ways in the
primary voting on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   In a stunning demonstration of the power of a sustained
television barrage and an energetic, sharply targeted personal
campaign against an opponent whose focus seemed shaky at crucial
moments, Bush raised doubts about McCain's sincerity, his
conservatism, his credentials as a reformer and his capacity to
beat the Democratic nominee in November.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, Bush took a machete to the very quality
that had enabled McCain to transform himself from an obscure
insurgent into a serious contender for the presidency _ his ability
to convince voters that he was profoundly different from most
politicians, including Bush, because he was committed to
truth-telling and hewing to principle.
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether they thought McCain said what he believed, 52
percent of the voters said yes. Asked the same question about Bush,
50 percent said yes. Two peas in a pod, the voters clearly thought,
despite all McCain's efforts to set himself apart from the
political norm.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing changed more radically or more significantly from
New Hampshire to South Carolina, over just 18 frenetic days, than
the willingness of self-avowedly conservative voters to support
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, McCain did every bit as well as Bush among
conservatives, polling 37 percent to Bush's 36 percent. But in
South Carolina, Bush took twice as many conservatives as his main
rival, winning the backing of 65 percent of them compared with
McCain's mere 29 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Compounding McCain's problem, there were more conservatives
here. For all the suggestions that the South Carolina electorate
had grown more moderate with the creation of high-tech jobs and the
influx of retirees, that portion of the electorate that turned out
for the primary remained profoundly conservative. Just over half of
the voters in New Hampshire's Republican primary called themselves
conservatives; here, 61 percent did so.
</P>
<P>
   One element in the change was the Bush campaign's suggestion,
directly and indirectly, that McCain was a closet liberal or at
least unreliably conservative. Another may have been the withdrawal
of Steve Forbes and Gary L. Bauer, two other conservative
candidates, whose absence here helped Bush draw a clearer
distinction between himself and McCain.
</P>
<P>
   But most important, South Carolina's conservatives are different
from those in New England.
</P>
<P>
   Christian conservatives are thin on the ground in New Hampshire;
they accounted for only 16 percent of the Republican primary vote
there. But in South Carolina, they were more than twice as
numerous, accounting for 34 percent of the primary vote, and they
gave Bush a huge lift.
</P>
<P>
   Final voter survey figures here showed the governor winning by a
lopsided margin among members of the religious right, taking 67
percent of their votes compared with 24 percent for McCain and 9
percent for the third contender, Alan Keyes, a former State
Department official. Among those who professed no interest in
Christian conservatism, McCain eked out a victory, 52 percent to 46
percent.
</P>
<P>
   That same sharp split showed up within the electorate when
viewed through other lenses useful in discerning conservative
tendencies. For example, among those who think abortion should be
mostly or always illegal, Bush took about 6 of every 10 votes;
among those who said abortion should be legal in most or all cases,
McCain took close to the same proportion.
</P>
<P>
   The Christian conservatives were younger and less educated than
the electorate as a whole. Poll analysis indicated that 41 percent
of those under 30 identified with the religious right, compared
with 28 percent of those over 60, and 42 percent of those with no
college education identified with the religious right, compared
with 29 percent of those with a degree.
</P>
<P>
   McCain won only one age category, those over 75, and only one
education category, those with graduate degrees. His other strong
showings came among veterans, though Bush very nearly held his own
among that group, on whom the senator had counted strongly; the 31
percent of Saturday's voters who said that they had never before
voted in a Republican primary in this state; the 10 percent who
identified themselves as Democrats crossing over to cast Republican
ballots and the 30 percent who described themselves as
independents. People born outside South Carolina were divided.
</P>
<P>
   Many of those newly arrived in the state have settled in
Beaufort County, which includes Hilton Head Island; Horry County,
which includes Myrtle Beach, and Charleston County. McCain carried
all three.
</P>
<P>
   In the biggest primaries in the days immediately ahead, which
take place in California, New York, Michigan and Ohio, Bush will be
able to rely much less on Christian conservatives, who are much
less numerous in those states, as are conservatives of any stripe.
Furthermore, he faces potential difficulties with Roman Catholic
voters, many of whom deeply resent what they have long considered
the intolerance of the Southern evangelicals with whom Bush has now
very thoroughly linked his cause.
</P>
<P>
   Ralph Reed, Pat Robertson and other Christian activists, who
proved a major asset for the Texan here, could prove a liability as
the action shifts north. Bush must find a way, both for the
big-state primaries and, if nominated, for the general election, to
reclaim his inclusive, centrist image. McCain served notice that he
would resist another makeover.
</P>
<P>
   The Michigan electorate, which votes on Tuesday, is a great deal
more like that in New Hampshire than the one that voted here on
Saturday. That gave the McCain backers a certain tincture of hope
after a rotten day.

CONFEDERATE FLAG ISSUE RAISES CONCERN WITH KNICKS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By SELENA ROBERTS    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After regularly training at the College of Charleston
twice a year for eight seasons, New York Knicks players are
considering whether they want the organization to continue its
affiliation with South Carolina, where the Confederate battle flag
flies above its Capitol, even though the banner is considered a
symbol of slavery and segregation.
</P>
<P>
   The issue became a source of heated political debate during the
prelude to the Republican primary there last Saturday. Last
Thursday, after it was reported that USA Track and Field had issued
a statement in support of the removal of the flag from the
statehouse in Columbia, S.C., site of the United States women's
marathon trials this month, the issue was raised with the Knicks,
whose roster is predominantly black.
</P>
<P>
   Team officials declined to be interviewed on the subject, but
last Friday, Steve Mills, the executive vice president of franchise
operations, said in a statement: ``The Knicks aren't prepared to
make any decision right now regarding changing locales for training
camp. But this is obviously an issue that concerns us.''
</P>
<P>
   Coach Jeff Van Gundy addressed the issue with his players at a
team meeting last Friday. The players said they were asked to think
about their position regarding the team's association with the
state and provide the organization with some feedback. If the
players are against operating their preseason camp _ and often
their workouts before the playoffs _ at the College of Charleston,
the team may decide to look for an alternate site.
</P>
<P>
   Over the weekend, several players were asked if they would
prefer the team look elsewhere for a training camp.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you've got a state that wants to fly that flag knowing what
it means to people, and me being black, I don't need to be in that
state,'' Larry Johnson said. ``As an individual, no, I wouldn't
want to practice there. But if management says it's going to be
such and such dollars or another place won't be as sufficient, then
I don't know if we have much of a choice. But if we have another
choice, let's get out of there.''
</P>
<P>
   The team has a multiyear contract with the College of Charleston
but the financial toll of breaking it is said to be minimal,
according to one team official. The logistics of finding another
suitable site might be more complicated. As it is, the Knicks have
access to a state-of-the-art training center and gym and have
luxury hotel accommodations within walking distance of the college.
</P>
<P>
   For eight seasons, since Pat Riley arrived to coach the Knicks
for the 1991-1992 season, the Knicks have packed up in October and
headed to camp at the College of Charleston, where they patronize a
hotel, shopping areas and restaurants, and bring publicity to the
school. Last July, the National Association for the Advancement of
Colored People began to call for an economic boycott of the state.
</P>
<P>
   The controversy surrounding the flag has left some wondering
what responsibility athletes have in using their celebrity to bring
attention to political and social issues. Some college sports
programs have canceled trips to South Carolina in support of the
NAACP boycott, and track and field athletes have contemplated a
protest during the women's marathon trials on Feb. 26.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the issue is something that should be brought up,''
Charlie Ward said. ``The flag is symbolic of slavery, power, and I
think we should think about it and make a statement on it. At least
we can send some type of message. There are a lot of people who
walk around with that flag and use it for power and racism. When
the flag flies, it's more than just about slavery. There are a lot
of negative images tied to that one flag.''
</P>
<P>
   There is a chance for a compromise to be reached in South
Carolina. Gov. Jim Hodges has reportedly won support from some
black legislators for moving the Confederate flag from the
Statehouse to a monument of a Confederate general on the Capitol
grounds. It is unclear when the Knicks will make a decision on
whether to continue training in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   ``Personally, I'd rather not go back,'' Chris Childs said.
``Unfortunately, the flag is a part of life that hasn't changed in
some places. It's not an issue as far as the way we've been treated
down there _ because the people have treated us nice _ but just
knowing the flag is flying there is offensive. The flag stands for
slavery and the Ku Klux Klan, and my idea would be for us not to
practice there.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've got a week to think about it. The guys will talk about
it and discuss it, and let the organization know what our feelings
are about it. It's good that we get a chance to give some input.'' &QL;

U.S. WELCOMES IRANIAN ELECTION RESULTS 
</HEADLINE>
  (With IRAN-ELECTION) 
(lb) 
 By JANE PERLEZ   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In unusually bold language, the Clinton
administration welcomed the election results in Iran on Sunday and
said it interpreted them as an unequivocal demand for greater
freedom within the country and for improved relations abroad.
</P>
<P>
   ``By all indications this is an event of historic proportions,''
the State Department spokesman, James Rubin, said Sunday evening,
referring to the partial results available by then.
</P>
<P>
   The vote showed, he said in a statement, that the Iranian people
want ``engagement with the rest of the world'' and ``made clear
their preference for greater freedoms within Iran.''
</P>
<P>
   The parliamentary election, the most open since the fall of the
shah, has been long awaited by the Clinton administration as a test
of whether it could turn around the hostile relations of the last
20 years before President Clinton leaves office.
</P>
<P>
   A series of U.S. inducements for opening a dialogue over the
last several years, including a secret message from Clinton last
August, have all been spurned by the Iranian leadership.
</P>
<P>
   With the strengthening of President Mohammad Khatami's moderate
forces in Iran, the Clinton administration clearly hopes that the
stonewalling will at least be reduced and that Khatami will be able
to make inroads into the power preserves of the supreme leader,
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who controls the military, intelligence
services and the judiciary.
</P>
<P>
   In Sunday night's statement, the State Department cautioned that
it remained to be seen whether the ``clear hopes of the Iranian
people can be translated to reality.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously we hope that the trends of the elections will be
reflected by a different approach to the outside world,'' Rubin
said.
</P>
<P>
   In that regard, he said, the United States was most concerned to
see whether Iran would change its opposition to the Middle East
peace negotiations and whether it would cease its support of
terrorist groups seeking to derail the current rounds of
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinians and between Israel
and Syria.
</P>
<P>
   The United States has recently stepped up its accusations
against Iran for supporting such terrorist groups.
</P>
<P>
   The administration would also be watching closely to see whether
the new Parliament would force ``a re-examination of the utility of
developing weapons of mass destruction,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   The efforts of the Iranian government to acquire nuclear weapons
have been one of the most pressing concerns of the Clinton
administration, and talks at the White House last week with a
senior Russian official, Sergei B. Ivanov, focused on trying to
persuade Moscow to stop the export of nuclear materials to Iran.
</P>
<P>
   As the parliamentary election approached, Clinton administration
officials were watching very closely for trend lines. But most
seemed to believe that while the reformers would gain, and probably
gain considerably, this would by no means signal the end of Iran's
Islamic revolution.
</P>
<P>
   For the United States to take real advantage of the election
results, it must first find someone authoritative to talk to.
</P>
<P>
   The first move by the administration will most likely be to
search for a way to open substantive talks, a senior administration
official said Sunday. The official pointed out that even North
Korea _ which has hostile relations with the United States and
which, like Iran, is on the State Department's list of countries
that sponsor state terrorism _ has official talks with the United
States.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ever since Secretary of State Madeleine Albright offered in June
1998 to draw up a ``road map'' to re-establish relations with Iran,
the Iranian government has rebuffed the administration.
</P>
<P>
   Last year the administration was rebuffed again when Clinton
sent a message that the United States had information concerning
the involvement of ``Iranian government officials and others'' in
the bombing of a U.S. military building in Saudi Arabia, which
killed 19 American servicemen. In the letter, Clinton attempted to
gain Iranian cooperation in the case and at the same time to test
the willingness of the moderates in Tehran to engage the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   The United States, in addition to trying to start a dialogue
with Iran, has some leverage with the wide range of sanctions that
have been imposed on its government. Many of these were imposed by
executive order and can be lifted without the approval of Congress,
where there has been criticism of Clinton's efforts to reach out to
Iran.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Clinton cited Iranian support for terrorist groups as
the reason for banning all U.S. trade with the country.
</P>
<P>
   Some of these sanctions were relaxed to allow the sale of grain
and medicine. And last December the administration allowed Boeing
to sell parts to Iran's national airline so as to ensure the safety
of its Boeing 747 passenger aircraft.
</P>
<P>
   But major changes in the sanctions are unlikely, given the high
national security concerns that the United States has with Iran,
officials said. What is more likely is that there will be stronger
encouragement for the forces of reform now that the parliamentary
elections have shown that the pre-election low-key encouragement of
the reformers from Washington did not lead to a backlash.

SPORTS COLUMN: WHEN RULES TAKE THE FUN OUT OF THE GAME 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By JOE DRAPE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Connecticut Coach Jim Calhoun heard the leather slam against the
hardwood and an anguished bellow as the basketball ricocheted high
above the Huskies' home court. He was not sure who angrily slammed
the ball, but he knew when and why. It was about three weeks ago,
when the police were investigating whether two of his freshmen had
improperly received merchandise from a clothing store in Hartford.
</P>
<P>
   No criminal charges were filed against the players, Tony
Robertson and Doug Wrenn, though both were suspended from the team.
Robertson has returned; Wrenn has not. The coach was recounting the
incident to show how hard it has been for his team to have fun this
season.
</P>
<P>
   It is difficult enough that the Huskies are the defending
national champions, he said, and each opponent is taking its best
shot at beating them. It is vexing enough, he said, for his
players, who are ranked 18th, to grow into the roles necessary to
win another title without last season's scoring star, Richard
Hamilton.
</P>
<P>
   Then, there have been the offcourt stumbles _ the police
investigation and subsequent suspensions of his freshmen; an early
season incident in which Connecticut asked the National Collegiate
Athletic Association to decide whether center Jake Voskuhl had
violated association bylaws by using a friend's car. The
organization ruled he had not.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's been really heavy, heavier than I expected,'' Calhoun
conceded last week. ``The offcourt things are distracting, really
distracting _ don't let anyone tell you they are not.''
</P>
<P>
   UConn's opponent Monday night, St. John's, knows all about
distractions. The team is doing its best to eke out some fun as it
heads toward the NCAA tournament.
</P>
<P>
   For nearly three weeks, the NCAA's investigators have
investigated everything from a car swap between Erick Barkley and a
family friend to whether the player had improper dealings with
``street agents'' to who paid his tuition at a prep school in
Maine.
</P>
<P>
   Barkley was declared ineligible for two games when the NCAA
decided switching sport utility vehicles with a Rucker League coach
violated its extra-benefit regulation. An appeals committee sliced
a third game off the suspension.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators returned to New York last week and wanted to talk
with a New York City basketball enthusiast who was implicated in a
recruiting scandal at Syracuse a decade ago, which resulted in a
two-year probation for the men's basketball team. Two people
associated with St. John's and the current investigation have
identified Rob Johnson as a ``street agent'' or ``runner'' for
sports agents. They say Johnson alerted the NCAA to alleged
improprieties after Barkley turned down money from him on behalf of
an agent.
</P>
<P>
   The agent, Mitch Frankel, represents Ron Artest, a former St.
John's star and a close friend of Barkley's. Johnson has declined
to be interviewed by the NCAA and denies the allegations. Frankel
has not commented on the matter.
</P>
<P>
   An NCAA investigator also spoke with officials at Maine Central
Institute about whether people from the Riverside Church basketball
program, or any other benefactors, paid part of Barkley's tuition
when the St. John's guard attended the school in 1997 and 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Ernie Lorch, a Manhattan lawyer who helped build Riverside's
basketball program, has acknowledged he has provided financial
assistance to hundreds of kids in his 40 years with the basketball
program. Lorch declined to say whether he paid part of Barkley's
$23,500 tuition at Maine Central Institute. He said he had not been
contacted by the NCAA about Barkley, who played for Riverside.
</P>
<P>
   Lorch and Riverside have close and visible ties with St. John's.
Former Red Storm stars like Walter Berry, Chris Mullin and Artest
have played for Riverside. Dermon Player, a St. John's assistant
coach, and Alex Evans, the university's director for basketball
operations, are former Riverside coaches. Lorch is frequently seen
at Red Storm games and sits behind the bench, as he did in
Saturday's 76-75 victory over ninth-ranked Syracuse.
</P>
<P>
   By obtaining financial information from Maine Central,
investigators are following a path similar to that in other
inquiries that have resulted in suspensions of college basketball
players in recent months.
</P>
<P>
   Another former Maine Central Institute player _ Andre Williams
of Oklahoma State _ was declared ineligible for five games and
ordered to pay $5,000 to charity when the NCAA discovered his
tuition in Maine had been paid by a Kansas City, Mo., businessman,
Tom Grant. Like Lorch, Grant is deeply involved with a high-profile
traveling summer team.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the tumult, St. John's (18-6 over all and 10-3 in the Big
East) has won five games in a row and appears bound for the NCAA
tournament. Beginning Monday night with UConn (18-7, 7-5), the Red
Storm has one final, and treacherous, stretch _ at No. 3 Duke
(21-3) and at Miami (16-9, 9-3), which upset UConn on Saturday, and
a home game with No. 23 Seton Hall (18-6, 10-4). Basketball-wise,
Coach Mike Jarvis has declared this stretch ``fun time.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The toughest games _ the ones we can't lose _ are behind us,''
Jarvis said. ``From here on, we either play a tournament-caliber
team or a tournament game,'' Jarvis said before beating Syracuse on
Saturday night. ``Now all we need to do is go out and play the best
we can.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis and his players will not talk about the NCAA
investigation. They will not say whether they are slamming
basketballs at practice out of frustration.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyer, Rick Evrard of Bond, Schoeneck &AMP; King, is in New
York working with St. John's officials on the NCAA investigation.
The law firm, based in Overland Park, Kan., specializes in these
matters. It has represented Connecticut and, Evrard said, consults
quarterly with the school in an attempt to head off any violations.
</P>
<P>
   In a case like St. John's, the firm conducts a thorough
investigation and issues an independent report, according to
Evrard. The NCAA investigator also has more questions for players,
St. John's officials and associates that could be asked as early as
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   When Calhoun spoke about how heavy the season had been, he was
looking back. His team had weathered the distractions; he liked its
chances in the NCAA tournament. He did not believe there was a
superior team in the nation _ like his Huskies or Duke last season
_ that could not be upset. Calhoun smiled when he said his Huskies
finally were having fun, finally getting in touch with their
talent, and finally finding focus.
</P>
<P>
   Jarvis smiled, too, and urged his team to have fun. But the Red
Storm is learning what heavy means, as Barkley's summation of his
teammates' character after the Syracuse game illustrated: ``Only
the strong survive,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no good time for NCAA investigators, lawyers and
reporters to be asking about potential improprieties in a school's
program. There also is no worse time than now, when the games _ and
that's all they are _ matter the most. &QL;

A MEXICAN VILLAGE, IN CLASH, BRINGS THE POLICE TO THEIR KNEES
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By JULIA PRESTON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ It was not a sight Mexicans see every day, the 60
riot policemen, stripped of their clubs, shields and a good part of
their clothes, bound together with the ropes they normally use to
bind criminals, down on their knees and shivering in the chill air
of a public square.
</P>
<P>
   That panorama of humiliation of the forces of order was on view
Saturday in a Mexican village. Enraged townspeople there rose up
against police who conducted an early morning raid to end a student
strike at a local teachers' college.
</P>
<P>
   Tensions from far away fed the confrontation at the college,
which trains teachers in the rural state of Hidalgo. Shock is still
reverberating across Mexico from the police takeover of the
national university on Feb. 6 to end a student strike there. Like
the university, the teachers' college near the village of Tepatepec
is a public school that charges no tuition, has dwindling state
financing, and is struggling with a decline in academic standards
and a rowdy student movement.
</P>
<P>
   The village revolt against the state troopers, some of whom were
left with nothing but their undershorts, was mainly an explosion of
the resentment people around the country feel toward police
officers, who are regarded as venal, violent and overbearing.
</P>
<P>
   In the day's battles in Tepatepec, one policeman was shot, seven
people _ including police officers and protesters _ were injured
and possibly a dozen police patrol cars were burned, said the state
government spokesman, Luis Kaim. Although 350 students were
arrested in the initial raid on the college, all but 15 were
released during the day, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In January, students demanding financing for 200 new places to
increase enrollment occupied the college and ousted the director
and half the faculty. At dawn Saturday, some student strikers
traveled to the state capital, Pachuca, and threw rocks at the
governor's mansion, breaking some windows. The police dispersed
them.
</P>
<P>
   State authorities then decided to move immediately to carry out
an order issued by a judge last week to evict the strikers from the
college. The police were carrying only nightsticks and shields, and
state officials contended that no strikers were injured in the
police raid.
</P>
<P>
   But townspeople reached a different conclusion. Incensed by a
rumor that one young woman had been raped, several hundred
villagers carrying clubs, machetes and more that a few pistols
surrounded the school and subdued 60 policemen still inside,
forcing them to remove their shirts, shoes and in some cases their
pants.
</P>
<P>
   The villagers tied ropes around the police officers and paraded
them, with their hands on their heads, through the streets to the
central square, where they forced the officers to drop to their
knees and then lie face down on the pavement.
</P>
<P>
   After a nippy evening in which the half-naked officers were
quivering with cold, the villagers finally released them when the
majority of the strikers were freed by state authorities.
</P>
<P>
   Like the nine-month strike that devastated the national
university in Mexico City, the conflict at the rural college
erupted when the state authorities began a campaign to raise the
academic level without increasing funds. Gov. Manuel Angel Nunez
Soto sought to require students to show they had attended class on
at least 85 percent of school days in order to graduate, Kaim said.
</P>
<P>
   In a student body made up of the offspring of hard-pressed
country farmers, who often cannot attend school unless they also
work full time, fewer than one-third could meet this requirement,
the government spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month striking students at the college hijacked a
state-owned gasoline truck with a full tank. They returned the
truck but the gasoline vanished, officials at the state attorney's
office said.
</P>
<P>
   As a measure of the paucity of money for education in Hidalgo,
the cost of enrolling one student for a year is only $300, state
officials said.

   WASHINGTON _ Former Sen. Bill Bradley publicly endorsed the
appointment of a special prosecutor Sunday to investigate campaign
finance abuses by the Clinton-Gore campaign in 1996, saying he
thought there was clear evidence that laws had been broken.
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance on ABC's ``This Week,'' Bradley, who is running
against Vice President Al Gore for the Democratic presidential
nomination, asserted that the decision by the Democratic National
Committee to return money that may have been collected improperly
in 1996 and the criminal prosecutions of several low-level
Clinton-Gore fund-raisers indicated that a broader investigation
was needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's interesting to note that Al Gore had said in New
Hampshire that there were no legal violations,'' Bradley said in
response to a question from Sam Donaldson. ``Well, if that's so, I
would ask him where are the hundreds of thousands of dollars that
were returned by the DNC? What about the 12 people who were
convicted, the 70 people that essentially took the Fifth Amendment
and the 16 or 17, the exact number I'm not exactly sure of, who
actually fled the country?''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley acknowledged that it was highly unlikely that a special
prosecutor would be appointed to investigate the 1996 abuses, since
the decision was in the hands of the Clinton administration. In
1998, Attorney General Janet Reno determined there was insufficient
evidence to appoint an independent counsel to investigate Gore's
fund-raising role in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Gore had been sharply criticized for making fund-raising phone
calls from the White House as well as for attending a fund-raiser
at a Buddhist temple in Los Angeles in 1996. Many nuns and monks
who contributed money then were reimbursed by the temple in
violation of federal law, and the Democratic National Committee
later returned the money. Gore has said he did not know the event
was a fund-raiser.
</P>
<P>
   Chris Lehane, a spokesman for Gore, said, ``As Democrats
continue to reject Senator Bradley's candidacy, he's beginning to
sound more and more like the scandal-crazed Republicans such as
Newt Gingrich, Dan Burton and Trent Lott.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley, who has been gradually ratcheting up his attacks on
Gore in preparation for a wave of major primaries on March 7, has
said he thinks the vice president will be ``a risk'' to the party
because the Republicans will attack him ferociously about the
fund-raising problems in the general-election race.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think that I will not have the problems that he will have in
a general election against a Republican,'' Bradley said Sunday.
``We know what's coming with regard to the fund-raising scandals of
1996. We know that we're going to see the Buddhist temple and the
Buddhist monks. We know that we're going to see his finger saying
`no controlling legal authority' on fund-raising in the White
House.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley used his appearance Sunday to preview the sharp
contrasts with Gore his aides said he would try to draw in a debate
Monday night in Harlem. But he dodged a question about whether he
thought Gore was morally fit to be president, saying: ``I think
there is a record there of not telling the truth. It's a record
over a long time. And I think the American people want a president
to tell the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley faces political risks in attacking Gore for the 1996
fund-raising problems, since many Democrats seem to view the
party's aggressive fund-raising as necessary to defeat Republicans.
Gore has tried to exploit such sentiments by accusing Bradley of
being divisive and of aiding the Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Both campaigns also announced Sunday that as of Feb. 1 they had
nearly $16 million available for the final push to March 7, when
the campaign will be waged heavily through television commercials.

 c. 2000, Houston Chronicle  
DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Pontiac driver Johnny Benson was only four
laps away from pulling off an upset of David-and-Goliath
proportions until the mighty Fords ganged up on him.
<TEXT>
<P>
   And the Ford Taurus that was the best of the best all along came
to the front at the end when Dale Jarrett passed Benson and held on
to win the Daytona 500 on Sunday for the third time in his career.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just incredible,'' Jarrett said. ``I never would have
dreamed coming into the sport that I could win three Daytona 500s,
but it shows what can happen when you have a great team.''
</P>
<P>
   Jeff Burton finished second, Bill Elliott was third, Rusty
Wallace came in fourth and Mark Martin crossed the finish line in
fifth place as the Fords swept the top five spots.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, the defending Winston Cup champion, earned $2,277,975
for his victory in the Quality Care Ford, the largest winning purse
in NASCAR history. The total included a $1 million bonus for
Jarrett as one of the five drivers eligible for the Winston No-Bull
5 bonus.
</P>
<P>
   He also made a happy woman of Melissa Brown of Pittsburgh, who
won a $1 million bonus. It was the second consecutive year a fan
won the $1 million bonus at the Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, who started on the pole, led a train of Fords past
Benson on turn 2 after a restart on lap 197 of the 200-lap event at
the Daytona International Speedway.
</P>
<P>
   Benson, who drives for Tyler resident Tim Beverley and the Tyler
Jet Motorsports team, didn't even have a sponsor until the night
before the race when the team signed a deal with Lycos Inc. But
Benson, who started 27th, was in position to earn the biggest
victory of his career until Jarrett made his move.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett started to go high, and Benson moved up to block him,
but Jarrett veered back inside and got past Benson, along with a
train of Fords.
</P>
<P>
   ``Johnny made just enough of a move when I faked outside for me
to get under him down low,'' Jarrett said. ``As soon as I saw him
head up the racetrack, I cut my car dead left. But I wouldn't have
felt bad to lose to Johnny, because he's a good guy and that team
needs a break.''
</P>
<P>
   By the time Benson got back in the draft line, he had been
shuffled back to 12th, but he wasn't complaining.
</P>
<P>
   ``All those Fords against one Pontiac isn't going to work,''
Benson said. ``I knew it was going to happen either on the restart
or the last lap. We finish 12th, but I'm happy because we had a
chance to win the Daytona 500 until they ganged up on us.''
</P>
<P>
   The crowd of more than 200,000 didn't get a chance to see
whether Jarrett would have been able to hold off his fellow Ford
drivers, because Jimmy Spencer hit the wall coming out of turn 4
with two laps to go.
</P>
<P>
   It was the second consecutive time Jarrett has won a Winston Cup
points event at Daytona under a yellow flag. He won the Pepsi 400
night race last July under caution.
</P>
<P>
   But this victory was a little surprising to Jarrett, who damaged
his car in an accident during Happy Hour Saturday. Three
fabricators from the Robert Yates team were flown from Charlotte to
Daytona on Saturday evening and worked throughout the night to help
rebuild the dented body of the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The range of emotions in a 24-hour period are pretty
incredible,'' Jarrett said. ``We felt the things it takes to make a
car fast here were taken out of our hands, but this shows the kind
of people we have in this organization.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's why we were able to win the championship last year. The
fabricators did a fantastic job, and what an engine. That's what
did it for me, with a little push from Jeff Burton.''
</P>
<P>
   Crew chief Todd Parrott said the team worked on the car until it
was rolled to pit road Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   ``Every corner of the car was damaged,'' Parrott said. ``The
rocker panels were bent, and so was the back bumper. But the big
thing was the nose. We had to fix everything and get it lined up
right. The paint was still wet when we left the line. I was hoping
the decals wouldn't fly off.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett's car had been the best since the Winston Cup teams
unloaded the haulers at Daytona 12 days ago. He had the top
qualifying lap and won the Bud Shootout all-star race Feb. 13.
</P>
<P>
   But it took a pass of veteran driver Martin with 14 laps left
for Jarrett to get in position to win. Jarrett was third behind
Martin when their teams made an agreement to go together to try to
get by Benson, but Martin went high in turn 2 and Jarrett stayed
low.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the one thing I hate about the whole day,'' Jarrett
said. ``I told Mark I would work with him high. He went high, but
Jeff started to go past me down low and I had to protect my
position.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hate it happened to Mark, but I know that doesn't make him
feel any better. I wasn't trying to set him up, even though I know
he will never believe that. When Mark got beside me (after the
race) he threw his hands up like to say, `What happened?' I totally
understand that, and I would have felt the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   Martin would not criticize Jarrett, but he was upset about how
things transpired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought we had a good thing going there, and I was trying to
win the race,'' Martin said. ``I would rather have tried and lost
than not tried. That's all I have to say about it. I had a chance,
and that's all I ever really ask for.''
</P>
<P>
   Is he angry with Jarrett?
</P>
<P>
   ``Today is over with,'' Martin said. ``We just have to go to
Rockingham now.''
</P>
<P>
   With three victories in NASCAR's biggest show, Jarrett is tied
with Bobby Allison for third on the all-time list of Daytona 500
victories behind Richard Petty (seven) and Cale Yarborough (four).
</P>
<P>
   ``Today when it was over, Richard Petty came into Victory
Lane,'' Jarrett said. ``He shook my hand and told me, `Great job.'
It sent chills up my spine for `the King' to come over and say that
to me. I think that explains how special this win is to me.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   John W. Hannon Jr., a former president of Bankers Trust, died
last Feb. 14 at Carolina House, an assisted living facility in
Pinehurst, N.C. Hannon, a resident of West End, N.C., was 77.
</P>
<P>
   The cause of death was cardiac arrest, said his son, Bruce.
</P>
<P>
   Hannon worked for Bankers Trust, which was acquired by
DeutscheBank in 1999, for 32 years. He was appointed executive vice
president in charge of operations in 1971 before being named
president in 1975. He also served as chairman of the executive
committee, part of the board of directors, starting in 1973.
</P>
<P>
   Hannon was part of the management team at Bankers Trust in 1978
when it underwent a major reorganization, selling branch offices
and switching its focus from consumer to investment banking.
</P>
<P>
   Hannon's career in banking started in 1946 at Commercial
National Bank and Trust, which followed service with the Army Air
Corps during World War II and a short pitching career on a New York
Yankees farm team in Pittsburgh. He graduated from St. Lawrence
University with a bachelor of arts degree in 1946. Bankers Trust
bought Commercial National in 1951, and Hannon became an assistant
treasurer before being named an executive vice president.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son, who lives in London, Hannon is survived
by his wife, Vivien; two daughters, Elizabeth Reichard, of North
Andover, Mass., and Christine Hannon, of Northampton, Mass.; and
five grandchildren.

PAULSON GETS BIG CHANCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By LARRY MORGAN  
 San Gabriel Valley Tribune  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PACIFIC PALISADES -- Dennis Paulson has been saying all along he
deserves to be included among the best players on the PGA Tour. Now
he gets a chance to prove it to the world.
</P>
<P>
   The San Gabriel native plays Colin Montgomerie in Wednesday's
first round of this week's $5 million World Golf Championships at
La Costa Resort and Spa. Montgomerie, who has won the European
Tour's Order of Merit the past seven years, is the world's
third-ranked player (behind Tiger Woods and David Duval) and is
regarded as one of the toughest match-play performers around.
</P>
<P>
   But he is not impregnable. He lost in the WGC's first round last
year to Craig Stadler and Paulson, No. 62 in the world, wouldn't
mind a repeat.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't plan on being out in the first round,'' he said Sunday
after finishing in a tie for 18th at the Nissan Open at Riviera
Country Club. Paulson closed with a one-over-par 72 in cold, rainy
conditions. I'm playing real solid golf.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulson, who now lives in Vista, had his best year ever on tour
in 1999. He was 27th on the money list with $1,313,814 and had nine
top-ten finishes, including seconds in the Buick Classic and
Canadian Open.
</P>
<P>
   He has more than $102,560 in earnings this year (including
$37,731 at the Nissan) and heads into La Costa feeling good about
his game. He said he played with Montgomerie three times in college
(Paulson went to San Diego State; Montgomerie attended Houston
Baptist) and twice last year on tour, at Bay Hill and the BellSouth
Classic.
</P>
<P>
   But Paulson doesn't have a lot of match-play experience. He said
his last real exposure to that format was the finals of the
California State Amateur in 1985, when he lost to Sam Randolph 3 &AMP;
2.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think I was two- or three-under and still lost,'' Paulson
recalled, ``but that's the nature of the deal. I can shoot 75 and
win. I can shoot 63 or 64 and be down the road.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just want to play solid golf, keep the pressure on him and
hopefully he makes some mistakes.''
</P>
<P>
   Paulson said he enjoys match play because he feels it's the game
in its truest form.
</P>
<P>
   ``There aren't any complaints about getting a bad tee time or
stuff like that,'' he said. ``It's just you and him playing the
golf course at the exact same time, and that's all that matters.''
</P>
<P>
   A victory over Montgomerie would send Paulson into a
second-round match against the winner of Glen Day-Thomas Bjorn.
Other players in Paulson's half of the bracket include Vijay Singh,
Mark O'Meara and Greg Norman (who also meet in the first round) and
European Ryder Cupper Darren Clarke.
</P>
<P>
   Paulson said he expects to have plenty of fans in attendance at
La Costa. He already has been inundated with ticket requests --
``People are coming out of the woodwork,'' he joked -- but is
unsure if he will employ Stadler's winning strategy of a year ago,
when he did not concede a single putt.
</P>
<P>
   One thing that could work in Paulson's favor is Montgomerie's
inactivity. The Scot has played little, if any, competitive golf in
2000 and could be rusty.
</P>
<P>
   ``But he also might be ready to go and the juices could be
flowing,'' he said. ``If he plays bad, you could say, Well, he
probably should have played a little golf.' If he plays great, then
you could say, He prepared perfectly for it.'
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think Monty is going to have an easy day of it, the
way I'm striking the ball. He's going to have to work. I like the
golf course, I'm at home and I'm going to have a lot of people
supporting me.''

 IN MICHIGAN, McCAIN TARGETS WIDE MIX OF VOTERS  
(lb) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEVILLE, Mich. _ With time, money, momentum and the Republican
machine in Michigan working against him, Sen. John McCain is trying
to corral an unlikely coalition of moderate suburban Republicans,
poor urban Democrats and feisty blue-collar independents.
</P>
<P>
   But showing the confidence of a front-runner who feels his core
support is secure, Gov. George W. Bush signaled on Sunday that he
would compete for some of the same voters.
</P>
<P>
   That unpredictable electorate is concentrated in southeastern
Michigan, where three counties supply 40 percent of the primary
voters, and where Bush is campaigning Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Macomb County, McCain is bidding for people like Robert
Kraft, who voted twice for Ronald Reagan, before voting twice for
Bill Clinton. A retired tool and die machinist, Kraft plans to
support the senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain seems to be honest,'' Kraft said at a supermarket here.
``Bush _ he seems to be honest, but he's got all that money behind
him. He's going to have to pay that back somehow, and he's going to
forget about us people. I have to pay prescription prices, and my
wife does. Do you know how much that costs?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not need Kraft nearly as badly as McCain does. While
polls have shown McCain running strongly among Democrats and
independents in Michigan, his support appeared to be slipping among
Republicans even before his loss in South Carolina on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, the candidates had spent one day here since the
New Hampshire primary. Voters do not seem very familiar with them,
which is likely to be a bigger problem for McCain _ since he lacks
a strong organization in the state to turn voters out for him _
than for Bush. At both the western and the eastern ends of
Michigan, voters were heard in recent days to refer to the senator
as ``McLaine.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of aisles away from Kraft, Ann D'Amato, a clerical
worker, was grocery-shopping for her family. D'Amato also voted
twice for Ronald Reagan and twice for Bill Clinton. But though she
is most concerned about drugs and violence in the streets and in
the media, D'Amato has not even considered voting for anyone but
Vice President Al Gore. She just has not seen much of McCain, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only times I've seen him talk _ just a few times on the
news _ he doesn't come across as forceful enough,'' D'Amato said,
making an unusual criticism of the blunt-spoken senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's allies here have complained about Democrats making
mischief by voting in the Republican primary, which is open to all
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bush appeared on Sunday to be reaching out to some
of these same voters, or at least discouraging them from seeking to
punish him at the polls, by appearing in heavily Democratic Wayne
County and releasing a new commercial that presents him as a gentle
man concerned with the well-being of children.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain made a play for the core of Bush's support,
campaigning in conservative western Michigan, and he is advertising
himself on radio as a ``proud, pro-life Reagan conservative.'' On
Monday he planned to campaign in Saginaw to the north and Ypsilanti
to the west, in a swing planned before his loss in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hudome, McCain's top adviser in Michigan, said that the
senator wanted the support of Democrats and independents. ``We're
reaching out to all voters like President Reagan did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been reaching out to Democrats here through the mail.
Leo and Joyce Lalonde, Democrats who live in Macomb County,
received a mailing from McCain on Friday at their home in
Eastpointe, which adjoins Roseville. The Democrats are not holding
a primary, it noted (they are holding closed caucuses next month).
</P>
<P>
   ``Make your voice heard by voting for the one candidate
committed to reform,'' it continued. For those Democrats concerned
about the consequences of a crossover vote, it continued, ``Even if
you vote in Tuesday's Republican primary, you can still participate
in future Democratic Party political activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign has not bought any mailing lists of
Democrats, Hudome said. But the campaign has been appealing to some
Democrats by sending fliers and placing pre-recorded telephone
calls to all residents of some towns with a mixture of Democrats
and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Lalonde, who is the chairman of the Democratic committee
for the 10th Congressional District, said she was amused by the
letter but had no intention of complying. ``You've got to
understand,'' she said. ``Their primary is Tuesday and ours is
March 11. If we mess around in theirs, they're going to mess around
in ours. That would be politically not a smart move on our part.''
She said she doubted that many Democrats would cross over for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lalonde disavowed any Democratic effort on McCain's
behalf, other Democrats have been trying to help him, for their own
purposes. On Saturday, Geoffrey Feiger, a former Democratic
candidate for governor and the lawyer who represented Dr. Jack
Kevorkian, began running a radio advertisement excoriating Bush and
Gov. John Engler, who has thrown his party organization behind
Bush, as ``dumb and dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When John Engler and George W. Bush talk about lawsuit abuse,
they really mean they helped their friends in the insurance
industry and denied all of us access to the courts,'' Feiger says
in the commercial. In an interview, Feiger said he was seeking to
help McCain and had had no contact with his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has his own radio advertisements on the air here, warning
that unnamed forces were ``coming after him here in Michigan,'' and
stating that he would never run a negative commercial: ``They
insult your intelligence, and hurt our chances against Gore in
November.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In another Democratic boost to the senator, the Michigan
Democratic Party and College Democrats of Michigan plan to hold a
protest against Bush on Monday at 11:45 a.m. at Michigan State
University in Lansing, where the Texas governor is scheduled to
appear at noon. Dennis Denno, the state party's spokesman, insisted
that the protest did not signal that Democrats were siding with
McCain, although he said that no protests were planned against the
Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   LaMar Lemmons III, a state representative from Detroit, visited
churches Sunday to urge predominantly black congregations to
support McCain, in what he called an effort to embarrass Engler,
Bush's leading supporter here. Lemmons said that he was upset that
Engler had pushed through state legislation eliminating Detroit's
elected school board and separate criminal courts. ``We're out to
send the Republican establishment a message: They have meddled in
our affairs,'' Lemmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons said that other Democrats were quietly helping McCain in
10 of Michigan's 16 Congressional Districts, but were doing so
secretly to avoid offending the party's leaders. Mark Brewer, the
chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said that he did not
know of any other Democratic politicians who were supporting
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in what LaMar is doing, but he's one state
representative out of 52'' Democrats in the Michigan House, Brewer
said. ``Any thought this will have a significant impact next
Tuesday is silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons said that he wanted to persuade 100,000 Democrats to
vote in the Michigan primary, through a a 12-line phone bank and
pamphlets and faxes sent to 200 churches. But Ed Sarpolus, a
pollster at EPIC/MRA, a polling firm in Lansing, said that based on
previous primaries, about 100,000 Democrats could be expected to
vote anyway in the Republican primary, which could draw anywhere
from 600,000 to 1 million voters altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters interviewed Sunday insisted that the campaign in
South Carolina would not influence them. McCain on Sunday attacked
Bush for appearing at Bob Jones University, a conservative
Christian college in South Carolina whose president has made
critical comments about Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   But Ned McGrath, the spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese of
Detroit, said that he had not even heard about any controversy
involving Bush's appearance at the college. The local media have
made no mention of the issue, nor has the archdiocese's weekly
newspaper, the Michigan Catholic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Sterling Heights, a middle-class industrial suburb north of
Detroit, several voters interviewed as they headed for services at
St. Malachy Catholic Church said they would support Bush because
they believe he is a staunch opponent of abortion. But Mike Kovacs,
31, who considers himself an independent voter and who voted for
Clinton in the last election, plans to support McCain this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his stand on the issues is a little more solid than
George Bush's,'' said Kovacs. ``I kind of like the idea of someone
who has honesty and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   As bells pealed through an overcast sky Sunday morning at the
Most Holy Trinity Church in Detroit's Corktown neighborhood, Alanna
Reyes-Ali, 49, said she would vote for McCain to send a message to
the state's Republicans, particularly Engler whom many city
residents blame for legislative moves that they say will hurt
Detroit's tax base and schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the problems we've had with Engler with their attack
on Detroit, it gives the Democrats a chance to wreak havoc back on
them,'' she said.

ON HIS 23RD BIRTHDAY, MARBURY HAS A GAME TO CELEBRATE 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CHRIS BROUSSARD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ Stephon Marbury strolled into the Target Center on
Sunday knowing that an entire state was eagerly awaiting his
failure, that almost everyone in the crowd of 19,449 wanted to see
him broken and humiliated. He knew there would be boos, taunts and
disparaging signs and that the fans who once cheered him would do
everything in their vocal power to make his 23rd birthday a
horrible one.
</P>
<P>
   But in a performance that proved he is as mentally strong as he
is athletically gifted, Marbury emerged from the emotional gauntlet
as a champion. In a nationally televised game that many thought
would confirm him a fool for forcing last season's trade from
Minnesota to the Nets, Marbury almost single-handedly defeated an
arena full of opponents.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring 39 points, including 12 of the Nets' 15 in the fourth
quarter, Marbury made his first trip back to Minnesota a victorious
one, leading the Nets (21-30) to an improbable 91-89 victory over
the Timberwolves (28-23). By game's end, the earsplitting chorus of
boos Marbury heard every time he touched the ball had fizzled into
a whisper, and dozens of Timberwolves fans huddled near the exit to
pat him as he jogged off the court, some of them yelling, ``You're
the man, Steph!''
</P>
<P>
   ``This was the best birthday by far,'' said Marbury, who fell
just 3 points shy of matching his career high. ``There was so much
hype built up around it. It wasn't unnecessary, but I knew and
everyone else knew that a lot of people were going to boo. By just
playing through that and knowing that I can do that, I learned
something about myself.''
</P>
<P>
   From the moment he entered the arena to the time he left,
Marbury handled the potentially distressing situation like a
professional. Since he and his agent, David Falk, pressured the
Timberwolves into trading him last March 11, he had been vilified
in Minnesota as selfish and ungrateful for spurning the team he
played with for his first two and a half seasons in the National
Basketball Association.
</P>
<P>
   The Minnesota fans, many of whom believe Marbury left because of
jealousy over Kevin Garnett's six-year contract worth $126 million,
showed up with signs that labeled him a ``crybaby,'' perhaps
referring to his complaints about the state's cold weather and his
insistence that he left the Timberwolves to be closer to his family
in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Aware of the derision, Marbury entered with giddiness and a
smile, greeting everyone from security guards to former teammates
with a hug. He seemed to be relishing the situation, and when the
crowd drenched him in boos as he walked out for the opening
tip-off, he smiled widely, as if knowing he would reduce them to
silence and grudging admiration soon.
</P>
<P>
   Garnett, the Timberwolves' outstanding forward, with whom
Marbury shared a close friendship and a glistening future, was not
as strong. The hype, much of which revolved around these two, got
to Garnett, and he uncharacteristically lost his composure. Playing
as if rushed, he attempted a career-high and franchise-record 33
field goals, making just 9.
</P>
<P>
   ``I came out too hyped at the start,'' said Garnett, who shared
a pregame hug with Marbury and says their friendship is strong as
ever. ``My shots were either too long or too hard. I just have to
learn to control my emotion and energy.''
</P>
<P>
   While Garnett clanged shots off the rim, going 3 for 9 in the
first quarter and 4 for 13 in the first half, Marbury stayed within
the flow of the offense and shot the ball tremendously. As if
motivated by the boos, he scored 9 first-quarter points to lead the
Nets, then 5 more in the second to send them into the locker room
ahead by 46-42.
</P>
<P>
   Marbury scored 13 more points in the third, including 6 on
3-pointers, to give the Nets a 76-65 lead heading into the final
period, and in a delicious conclusion, the fourth came down to the
two stars and pals. With the other Nets shooting 0 for 7, Marbury
took over the offense, hitting all three of their field goals in
the fourth quarter. And Garnett, still without his touch, began
dominating the backboards to score on putbacks or free throws. He
grabbed 8 of his 18 rebounds and scored 11 of his 27 points in the
fourth.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like a one-on-one battle,'' Nets forward Kendall
Gill said. ``I started to go get some popcorn and watch.''
</P>
<P>
   With 1 minute 31 seconds left, Marbury scored what would be the
game's final point by hitting 1 of 2 free throws to put the Nets
up, 91-89. Garnett, who all but nullified Keith Van Horn (12
points) by getting him in early foul trouble, fouled out Jim
McIlvaine with 1:15 remaining but missed both ensuing foul shots.
</P>
<P>
   With the rookie Evan Eschmeyer, playing admirable defense on
Garnett, the Nets forced Minnesota into a 24-second violation with
just 32 seconds to play. But they failed to seal the outcome when
Marbury's &QC; 3-point attempt missed with 8.9 seconds left.
</P>
<P>
   As the teams set up for the final play after a timeout, Marbury
smiled at Garnett and gave him something to think about. ``I was
telling him that I knew he was going to get the ball, and he just
kind of looked at me like, `You know I am.'''
</P>
<P>
   Garnett did, of course, and when he wheeled into the lane for a
six-footer, Eschmeyer was right there to contest it. Malik Sealy
tipped the rebound toward the basket but missed, and Kerry Kittles
grabbed the ball just before time ran out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going through this situation has definitely made me build
character,'' Marbury said. ``I know that I can't say certain
things, and I know that I was wrong for a lot of things that went
on. But coming in tonight and playing the best basketball that you
can possibly play was the main thing. This is the best.''

REFORMERS EBULLIENT FOLLOWING ELECTION GAINS IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SUSAN SACHS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TEHRAN, Iran _ Iran's reformers, increasingly convinced that
they have wrested control of the Parliament from religious
conservatives, put their confidence on full display Sunday by
paying homage to the most outspoken clerical advocate of change and
democracy, Abdullah Nouri.
</P>
<P>
   As if to symbolize the buoyancy of the reformers, Nouri, who has
been in prison for three months after being convicted of apostasy
by a clerical court, was allowed to go home late Saturday for a few
days. As he received his guests, early tallies and various
prognoses indicated that reformers and moderates who have pledged
to back President Mohammad Khatami will have a significant,
probably dominant, place in the new 290-seat parliament.
</P>
<P>
   With about two-thirds of the 31 million votes cast in Friday's
elections already counted, analysts for the main reform parties
said their candidates had already trounced more hard-line
candidates in key provincial towns and cities.
</P>
<P>
   Results from the capital of Tehran, as well as the large cities
of Qum and Mershhad, have not yet been announced. But the reform
strategists, who have observers in the Ministry of Information
offices where the ballots are being counted, said preliminary
figures showed that pro-Khatami forces would hold a firm majority.
</P>
<P>
   The reformers speculated that the large turnout _ a record 80
percent _ worked in their favor. Khatami, who has invigorated
Iran's political life with his talk of creating a civil society and
the rule of law, was swept into office in 1997 on the strength of a
massive turnout by Iran's young people and women.
</P>
<P>
   ``With this vote, they have shown that the most important thing
is political development and the guarantee of legal freedoms,''
Nouri said of the reformist voters. ``It was not a personal fight
against anyone. It was an election about programs and issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The government has not provided a breakdown of the winners so
far, leaving the task of analyzing their political orientations to
journalists and political parties. Many candidates are unknown or
ran as independents. Even those who presented themselves as
supporters of Khatami's liberal agenda are unlikely to be united on
every issue and so may be hard to classify, analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's election opened the way for some liberalization of
Iranian life, but he has been unable to achieve fundamental changes
in part because of conservative opposition in the Parliament.
</P>
<P>
   His supporters in the elections pinned their hopes on the young,
who make up more than half the population, and on people fed up
with the conservatives who have dominated the Parliament since the
Islamic revolution in 1979.
</P>
<P>
   In November, Nouri was sentenced to prison after he enraged the
religious hierarchy by questioning their near-absolute power over
how Iranians conduct their private lives.
</P>
<P>
   By Sunday afternoon, his north Tehran home had become a place of
pilgrimage for government ministers, provincial officials,
presidential aides and many of the pro-Khatami reform candidates
who seem assured of becoming Iran's new power brokers.
</P>
<P>
   Last fall's trial of Nouri, 51, mesmerized the public and became
a metaphor for the struggle between the reactionary clergy and the
impatient young reformers.
</P>
<P>
   As a sign of Nouri's standing among those in power who have been
chafing under the restraints imposed by the hard-liners, his
visitors included Khatami's chief of staff, Sayed Mohammad Ali
Abtahi, several ministers, the head of Iran's Central Bank, and a
few provincial governors.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Also among the guests was Khatami's brother, Mohammad Reza
Khatami, who was a candidate on a reform ticket and appears to be
the top vote-getter in Tehran, according to analysts who have
studied the preliminary results from more than half of the
capital's polling places.
</P>
<P>
   As the results trickled in from outlying sections of the
country, Nouri gently chided his guests for not having more
definite results.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't know anything about computers,'' he said. ``That's
why you don't know the numbers.''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Iranian state television reported Sunday night that nearly 23
million votes had been counted, covering 203 parliamentary
districts. In 52 of the races, it said, a runoff would be held
sometime in late April because no candidate received the minimum 25
percent of the vote.
</P>
<P>
   Tehran accounts for 30 seats in the 290-seat Parliament.
Analysts for Iranian newspapers and political groups said the
leftist Islamic Iranian Participation Front, the most unabashed of
the reformist parties, appeared set to win at least a third of the
votes.
</P>
<P>
   Candidates from a more moderate party, Executives of
Construction, also were doing well, although their titular leader,
former president Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani, was believed to be
fighting hard just to make the cut on the first round.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   In the provinces, Mohammad Reza Tabesh, a nephew of Khatami, won
as a reformer in Ardakan, Khatami's hometown. In traditional
conservative strongholds like Isfahan and Shiraz, candidates
running under the pro-Khatami banner captured seven of nine seats.
</P>
<P>
   One of those defeated in Ifsahan, the second-largest city and
traditionally a religiously conservative one, was the former
intelligence minister Ali Fallahian. An incumbent, Fallahian has
been accused of knowing about the assassinations of prominent
liberals two years ago, a plot that Khatami has said was carried
out by ``rogue'' intelligence officers.
</P>
<P>
   Another losing conservative was Ahmed Rasouli-Nejad, a
parliamentarian from northern Iran who was among a group of
hard-liners who impeached the liberal culture minister last year.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   If they win a majority of seats, the pro-Khatami forces could
enable the president to make good on his pledge to create a society
of laws, to depoliticize the judiciary and to guarantee a free
press.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts for the moderate and reform parties said the election
results so far show that the hard-liners may end up with a mere 25
to 30 percent of the Parliament seats, although conservative
newspapers in Tehran predicted a better showing for their
candidates. The outgoing Parliament had a slight majority of
conservative members.
</P>
<P>
   Ahmad Bourghani, a key strategist for the reform movement, said
that his analysis of the returns reported by Sunday afternoon show
that the winners of 104 out of the 167 seats already announced are
either members of the leftist Islamic Iran Participation Front or
its more moderate ally, the Executives of Construction.
</P>
<P>
   The moderates' party has pledged support for Khatami on
reforming the judiciary and freeing the press, but differs from the
reformers on economic policy.
</P>
<P>
   The high stakes involved in the parliamentary elections have led
to clashes in some cities. Although the elections were
trouble-free, there were reports Sunday of violence in two towns
after the results were announced.
</P>
<P>
   The Iranian news agency IRNA reported that 15 people were
injured in riots in the southwestern town of Shush when police
tried to disperse demonstrators who threw stones at the governor's
office and accused the incumbent parliamentarian of winning
re-election by fraud. But a Tehran newspaper, Kahan, reported that
eight people were killed in the riots.
</P>
<P>
   Clashes also occurred in the town of Shadegan, in the same
province, when crowds protested the election results.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Sitting cross-legged on the carpeted floor of his basement and
leaning against pillows covered in the rich patterns of classic
Persian carpets, Nouri received a steady flow of visitors who bowed
in deference before him, kissed his cheeks, answered an unrelenting
stream of calls on their cellular phones and sat spellbound as he
spoke cryptically of his imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty-four hours in prison seem longer than a week,'' he
said, as his little grandson played near his feet. Asked if he
thought he might be spared the ordeal of returning to his cell to
serve out the remainder of his five-year sentence, Nouri smiled.
``That would be rational,'' he said, ``but it's not the reality.''
</P>
<P>
   When he was free and running the newspaper Khordad, Nouri called
for a public debate on the role of the clergy in general and the
supreme leader in particular. The leader has wide powers over the
judiciary, the military, the security forces and, effectively, over
the legions of volunteer militias that have been the main enforcers
of the clergy's puritanical rules of dress and behavior.
</P>
<P>
   The leader's role is defined in the Iranian constitution that
was written after the revolution 21 years ago. Nouri said Sunday
that he believed the first priority for a new Parliament would be
to pass laws allowing the creation of real political parties and
freedom.
</P>
<P>
   A change in the constitution, he added, is ``possible'' but
needs to be evaluated as part of an entire package of fundamental
systemic changes.
</P>
<P>
   He also said the preliminary election results reinforce the
popularity of Khatami and demonstrate again, as in the presidential
election two and a half years ago, that Iranians want fundamental
changes.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities did not give an explanation for Nouri's sudden,
although temporary, release from Evin Prison. But it is not unusual
for some prisoners, particularly those convicted of political
crimes, to get home visits every three months or so during their
jail terms.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri said he expected to be taken back to prison on Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Nouri's own brother, Ali Reza Nouri, acted as a second host to
the constant flow of visitors. One of the country's newest
political celebrities, he announced his candidacy for the
Parliament on the reform ticket soon after Nouri's conviction.
</P>
<P>
   As young men passed around glasses of juice and trays of sweets,
he told his older brother about his experience speaking to
university students.
</P>
<P>
   One student, he recalled, told him he looked like an
opportunist, jumping into politics on the basis of his relationship
to his popular brother. ``I told him it's like in football: If the
ball drops in front of you, shouldn't you kick it to make the
goal?'' the younger Nouri said. His older brother laughed.

PAC-10 LOOKING INTO USC-ASU FIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Pacific-10 Conference has launched an investigation into the
postgame altercation following Saturday's USC-Arizona State
contest, but unless clear videotape evidence emerges, it is
unlikely any players will be suspended.
</P>
<P>
   Pacific-10 Conference commissioner Tom Hansen said Sunday that
he had already viewed some films of the game, but was awaiting a
copy of the Arizona State game film today before any decision could
be made.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we don't have some very clear understanding of what
occurred it would be very hard,'' Hansen said. ``We could (suspend
players) if we had a clear agreement on what happened, but I don't
anticipate it.''
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona State game film is expected to be a ``very high
shot,'' according to Hansen. So far, none of the film Hansen viewed
offered a clear angle of the incident.
</P>
<P>
   USC guard Jeff Trepagnier and Arizona State forward Awvee Storey
were involved in an altercation after the Trojans' 93-81 loss to
the Sun Devils at Wells Fargo Arena. Both players blamed each other
for the start of the brawl.
</P>
<P>
   ``He came up and there was a squabble,'' Trepagnier said. ``I
was just trying to protect myself. He got in my face.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Storey: ``I got cheap-shotted. I didn't see it coming.''
</P>
<P>
   Hansen said he had already interviewed officials from USC and
Arizona State on Saturday night, and there was no single
explanation of who started the fight.
</P>
<P>
   ``In this case, there are many different versions,'' Hansen
said. ``It's very, very predictable. Everyone sees things
differently. We almost never get a clear indication.''
</P>
<P>
   USC coach Henry Bibby was not sure how the conference would
react to the situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who knows what will happen in the Pac-10?'' Bibby said.
``Nothing hashappened before when guys throw elbows.''
</P>
<P>
   The game officials will not be involved in the matter, because
they had already left the court before the altercation took place.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what the solution is,'' said Booker Turner, the
Pac-10's coordinator of men's basketball officials.
</P>
<P>
   What's next? USC's players realize their predicament the rest of
the season, as they still hold out hope for an NCAA berth. The
Trojans (13-11, 6-6) probably have to win five of their final six
games for any chance at a bid.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no margin for error and we all know that from now on
out,'' guard Nate Hair said.
</P>
<P>
   Career games: USC had major problems with Arizona State forward
Tanner Shell. The 6-foot-6 freshman had 24 points at the Sports
Arena and 17 in Tempe, his two highest totals this season.
</P>
<P>
   Shell, who yelled at USC's players as they came onto the court
in the second half Saturday, also took a shot at the Trojans'
postseason hopes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, they're not headed for the tournament, they're
headed for the NIT,'' hesaid.
</P>
<P>
   Long-range shooter: Point guard Brandon Granville made 9 of 14
of his 3-point shots last weekend in Arizona, but was only 4 for 15
on his two-point attempts.
</P>
<P>
   Scoring drought: USC point guard Rashad Jones scored one point
against Arizona State, his first point since the Loyola Marymount
game on Dec. 11.

DEAN DAVENPORT, 81, AVIATOR IN DOOLITTLE RAID 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RICHARD GOLDSTEIN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Col. Dean Davenport, the co-pilot of the World War II bomber
crew whose role in the Doolittle raid over Japan was recounted in
the book and movie ``Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo,'' died on Feb. 14
at a hospital in Panama City, Fla. He was 81.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was congestive heart failure and pneumonia, his family
said.
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of April 18, 1942, a group of 16 Army Air Forces
B-25 bombers, under the command of Lt. Col. James H. Doolittle,
took off from the aircraft carrier Hornet for a low-level, daylight
bombing attack that brought the war to the Japanese homeland for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
   The raid resulted in minimal damage to military and industrial
sites, but lifted the spirits of an American home front reeling
from the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. It forced the Japanese to
take costly defensive measures and brought Doolittle the Medal of
Honor.
</P>
<P>
   The seventh plane to depart from the Hornet was the Ruptured
Duck, flown by 1st Lt. Ted W. Lawson and his co-pilot, 2nd Lt. Dean
Davenport. They flew the twin-engine bomber 700 miles to Tokyo,
bombed a steel plant, then headed for an airstrip in China.
</P>
<P>
   The 16 bombers, without enough fuel to return to the Hornet,
were supposed to land at airfields in parts of China that had not
fallen to the Japanese. But they ran into a storm, and most of the
80 crewmen bailed out or crash-landed. Three died and eight were
captured by Japanese troops. Three of the captives were executed
and one died of dysentery.
</P>
<P>
   The Ruptured Duck crashed at night in the East China Sea, a
quarter-mile from a beach where its pilots had tried to land.
Lawson and Davenport, strapped into their seats, were catapulted
through the plane's windshield as it sank in shallow water. Lawson
suffered a gashed leg and facial injuries and Davenport had a
fractured leg and a concussion, but the pilots and the other three
crewmen managed to swim to the beach.
</P>
<P>
   They were found by Chinese guerrillas, and over the next seven
weeks were carried in chairs, rickshaws and trucks until being
rescued by an Army Air Forces plane that took them to India. The
crewmen flew on to the United States and, together with other
returning Doolittle fliers, received the Distinguished Flying Cross
from Gen. Henry Arnold, commander of the Army Air Forces.
</P>
<P>
   The ordeal of the Ruptured Duck's crew was recounted in 1943 by
the newly promoted Lawson in ``Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo'' (Random
House), written while he was convalescing from the amputation of
his left leg. The book described the moment when the battered
lieutenants found each other on the Chinese beach: ``Speaking, and
the sight of each other, seemed to bring us further along toward
complete consciousness and both of us began to moan, standing there
next to each other in the black rain.''
</P>
<P>
   Davenport was a technical adviser for the 1944 movie ``Thirty
Seconds Over Tokyo,'' in which he was portrayed by Tim Murdock, and
he flew a B-25 bomber off a pier in Santa Monica, Calif., in a
scene depicting the departure from the Hornet. The Army Air Forces
also allowed him to fly in the wartime movie ``A Guy Named Joe,''
an aviation fantasy. He was a stand-in, in a long-distance action
shot, for the actress Irene Dunne.
</P>
<P>
   Dean Davenport, born in Spokane, Wash., grew up in Oregon and
was a pre-law student when he joined the armed forces. He remained
in the service after World War II and returned to combat in the
Korean War, flying 86 missions as a fighter pilot. He retired as a
colonel in 1967. In addition to the Distinguished Flying Cross, he
was awarded the Silver Star and the Legion of Merit.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his wife, Mary, of Panama City; two sons, Dean
Jr. of Birmingham, Ala., and Stephen of Atlanta; two daughters,
Mimi Davenport of Atlanta and Julie Fierman of Birmingham; and one
grandchild.

COMMENTARY: LESSONS IN REALITY 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb)

<TEXT>
<P>
   John McCain and the media ran into a reality check in South
Carolina, where Republican voters decisively rejected the Straight
Talk Express and voted instead for the man who once told struggling
workers, ``I know how hard it is to put food on your family.''
</P>
<P>
   Somewhere Al Gore is smiling.
</P>
<P>
   At least for the moment, Gore is enjoying the best of all
worlds. Bill Bradley's campaign is fading. McCain and George W.
Bush are locked in a blood feud that is diminishing the stature of
both men and devouring Republican campaign cash at a record clip.
</P>
<P>
   Bush rescued his campaign by heading South, where he threw off
even the pretense of compassionate conservatism and spent most of
his time slow dancing with the religious right. It was an ugly
embrace that offended blacks, Catholics, gays and, most of all,
McCain, who made no effort to hide his fury at the way he was
trashed by Bush and his allies.
</P>
<P>
   The senator's supporters spoke bitterly about the cheap tactics
of the Christian conservatives and other elements of the extreme
right.
</P>
<P>
   So what's new? This is what the Republican Party has been for
years _ the party of the religious right and Willie Horton, of the
Contract With America, of gun rights as opposed to gay rights. It
is the party of the big guy against the little guy, and it is far
more often a haven for bigotry than a champion of inclusion.
</P>
<P>
   McCain may have mesmerized the press over the past several
weeks, but he's not so different himself. Which is why he got
knocked around by Tim Russert on ``Meet the Press'' on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   The senator acknowledged that he had voted against an increase
in the minimum wage and is opposed to even the minimal gun control
efforts that most Americans favor, including the Brady law.
</P>
<P>
   This period of unprecedented prosperity has not been enough to
convince John McCain to support a tiny pay raise for those at the
bottom of the income heap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the small-business person who's hurt when you raise the
minimum wage,'' he said, ``because they can't afford to pay their
employees.''
</P>
<P>
   This is the fellow who is too liberal for the supporters of
George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   As for inclusion, which is something McCain says he is for _
well, he took a hit on that on Sunday, too.
</P>
<P>
   Russert asked him about Richard Quinn, who was McCain's chief
strategist in South Carolina. Quinn is editor in chief of the rabid
Southern Partisan Quarterly Review, a neo-Confederate magazine that
ritually denounces the likes of Abraham Lincoln and Martin Luther
King Jr..
</P>
<P>
   Russert asked McCain about an article written by Quinn that
said: ``What better way to reject politics as usual than to elect a
maverick like David Duke? What better way to tweak the nose of the
establishment?''
</P>
<P>
   ``First of all, I haven't seen the whole article and I wouldn't
see the whole article,'' said McCain, suddenly sounding as if the
Straight Talk Express had veered off the road.
</P>
<P>
   Quinn, he said, was a man of integrity who didn't agree with the
more repulsive views in his own magazine.
</P>
<P>
   You believe that, don't you?
</P>
<P>
   The blood feud has already shifted to Michigan, which votes
Tuesday (along with McCain's home state of Arizona). The momentum
now supposedly is with Bush. If he hangs around until November (and
perhaps beyond), we can at least count on more of his malapropisms
and other forms of language mangling, a talent he inherited from
his dad.
</P>
<P>
   (The elder Bush gave us such gems as ``I'm not going to
hypothecate that it may.'' And ``It's no exaggeration to say the
undecideds could go one way or another.'' And ``Please just don't
look at part of the glass _ the part that is only less than half
full.'')
</P>
<P>
   George W. tells us we are ``in the beginnings of a long
marathon.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a moment when it was widely believed that he would
inevitably win the marathon and become president, just as his
father, riding high in the aftermath of the Gulf war, was a sure
thing to win re-election.
</P>
<P>
   We know better now. Bush the son is no more of a lock than his
pop. The one thing we've learned from this campaign is that the
Bushes are never inevitable.

ANATOLY A. SOBCHAK, MENTOR TO PUTIN, IS DEAD AT 62 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By CELESTINE BOHLEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MOSCOW _ Anatoly A. Sobchak, the former mayor of St. Petersburg
and democratic reformer who gave Acting President Vladimir V. Putin
his start in public life, died of a heart attack Sunday morning,
officials said. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak, who underwent treatment for heart problems for several
years, died while in Kaliningrad, Russia's Baltic Sea enclave,
where he had been sent as a personal representative of Putin.
</P>
<P>
   A television report Sunday evening said Putin, who had been
Sobchak's student in law school and his deputy mayor in St.
Petersburg, had sent a special plane to Kaliningrad to bring the
former mayor's body back to St. Petersburg for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak emerged as a leading member of Russia's democratic
movement in the late 1980s, together with Boris N. Yeltsin, who
became Russia's first elected president in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In that same year Sobchak became the first elected mayor of
Leningrad, Russia's second-largest city. After the collapse of a
Communist-backed coup that summer, Sobchak renamed his native city
St. Petersburg, the name it bore when it was Russia's imperial
capital.
</P>
<P>
   With his legal knowledge and lucid, eloquent speeches, Sobchak
was one of the best-known spokesmen for the democratic movement, at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   After Yeltsin's violent showdown with his opponents in
Parliament in October 1993, Sobchak was called on to help draft a
new constitution, which provided Yeltsin with the system of strong
presidential power that Putin has now inherited.
</P>
<P>
   In a condolence message to Sobchak's wife, Lyudmila Narusova,
and their daughter, Ksenya, Yeltsin praised the former mayor as
`'an extraordinary personality, a highly educated person who firmly
upheld his positions.''
</P>
<P>
   `'His special service was his participation in the work on the
constitution that laid the foundation of Russia's new statehood,''
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor of St. Petersburg, Sobchak traveled abroad extensively,
promoting his city as a future financial capital of Russia and
drumming up sponsors to save its graceful palaces and cultural
legacy from further decay and collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But while Moscow, St. Petersburg's historic rival, thrived
during the early years of Russia's economic transformation, with
new high-rises clogging its skyline and luxury shops and
restaurants opening in its downtown streets, St. Petersburg lagged
behind, looking ever more bedraggled and forlorn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the city's voters turned in their verdict on Sobchak's
term as mayor and voted him out of office, electing his archrival
and former deputy, Vladimir Yakovlev, in his place.
</P>
<P>
   In that period Sobchak came under heavy attack in the press and
by investigators, mainly on charges that he arranged for friends
and relatives to acquired city-owned apartments on preferential
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Although the charges were relatively minor compared with the
compromising material that has since surfaced against other Russian
public figures, they tarnished not only Sobchak's reputation, but
also that of the democratic movement generally.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Sobcak left Russia for Paris after falling ill
while being questioned by federal prosecutors. His wife, then a
member of Parliament, said he had left the country to seek adequate
medical treatment. He spent a year and a half in voluntary exile in
France, returning to Russia only last summer, a month before Putin
was appointed prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Greeted by more than 100 journalists at the St. Petersburg
airport, the former mayor, as exuberant as ever, said he would
never go away again. `'You don't need to rush,'' he said, ``because
I have returned forever. I have arrived in my city, and I am happy
to be home.''
</P>
<P>
   By late last year the criminal charges against him were dropped,
and Sobchak appeared ready for a return to national politics,
helped by his former protege and law student, Putin. But the former
mayor and his wife lost separate bids for parliament in elections
last December, and he instead accepted a position as legal adviser
to the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   In eulogies broadcast Sunday night on Russian television,
several leading Russian political figures, including former Prime
Minister Sergei V. Stepashin and Anatoly B. Chubais, author of
Russia's privatization program, both natives of St. Petersburg,
said the corruption charges had taken their toll on Sobchak and
weakened his health.
</P>
<P>
   Both pointedly mentioned his accusers by name, including a
former national prosecutor general, Yuri I. Skuratov.
</P>
<P>
   `'Sobchak was unlike most politicians,'' Stepashin said. `'Most
politicians sometimes choose to remain quiet, or to pretend.
Sobchak said what he thought. `'
</P>
<P>
   His supporters said Sobchak had keenly felt the betrayal of many
of his old allies, which made him all the more grateful for the
loyalty of others _ like Putin, who stood by the former mayor after
his defeat in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The two men had first met at Leningrad State University in the
1970s, where Sobchak, a law professor, taught Putin in a course on
economic law as the younger man prepared himself for a career in
the KGB, the Soviet state security agency.
</P>
<P>
   They became better acquainted in the late 1980s, when Putin,
returning from a KGB tour in East Germany, took a top
administrative job at the university. He was later recommended to
the city's new mayor, who chose him to run his international
affairs office.

<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST LANSING, Mich. _ As the bitter fight for the Republican
presidential nomination shifted to Michigan, Sen. John McCain on
Sunday leveled scorching and sustained attacks on Gov. George W.
Bush's reform credentials, while his rival stayed upbeat and
campaigned as if he were already in the general election.
</P>
<P>
   Just one day after Bush's double-digit victory in South Carolina
decisively restored the Texas governor to front-runner status, it
was as if the two candidates had exchanged the roles they had
played in the nearly three-week-long campaign in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Now it was Bush who was sunny, once more talking about where he
wanted to lead the nation and his vision of ``a positive,
optimistic, hopeful tomorrow.'' And it was McCain who was
ferociously trying to tar his opponent as a fraud, much as he did
in his caustic concession speech the night before.
</P>
<P>
   At rallies, on his bus and in several television appearances,
McCain sought to reclaim his image as the reform candidate in the
race, and he went after Bush as aggressively as the Texas governor
had targeted him after the senator won the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   McCain assailed Bush on a variety of fronts, from campaign
finance overhaul to regulation of health maintenance organizations,
from his tax cut proposal to state spending in Texas. Several times
during the day the senator said derisively, ``If he's a reformer,
I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   On his campaign bus, he heaped even more scorn on Bush. ``We're
not letting you get away with that, pal,'' he said. ``You're not a
reformer. Anybody who believes you're a reformer believes in the
tooth fairy.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked later about such comments, Bush said, ``It sounds like
Senator McCain spent a lot of time talking about me.''
</P>
<P>
   With Michigan and Arizona holding their primaries Tuesday, and
Bush and McCain having spent virtually all of the past two weeks in
South Carolina, they have precious little time to make an impact on
voters here. McCain is expected to win his home state. But the big
unknown here in the critical industrial state of Michigan is
whether its voters will ratify Bush's decisive win in South
Carolina or show an independent streak of their own.
</P>
<P>
   A poll taken on the eve of the South Carolina primary showed the
two men running neck and neck in Michigan, but there was no time to
calculate whether Bush's 11-point victory Saturday would alter the
landscape for Tuesday's primary. The state is now critical for
McCain, who must prove he is something more than a one-state wonder
who benefited from New Hampshire's maverick streak.
</P>
<P>
   But clearly, Bush's aides believe that the victory and its
margin allowed him to adopt a new campaign posture. Throughout the
day, he mentioned President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore more
than he mentioned McCain, and his references to the senator came
mainly in response to reporters' questions.
</P>
<P>
   Asked what he thought of McCain's concession speech Saturday, in
which McCain used words like ``pretense'' and ``an empty slogan of
reform'' to describe Bush, the governor said, ``All of us have to
react to our victories and defeats in our own ways.'' He added, ``I
think the American voters, the people of Michigan, are going to
have to judge how each of us handles adversity.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bush camp was confident that the governor's South Carolina
success would go a long way toward propelling him to victory in the
approaching round of big state primaries. They were also looking to
benefit from the fact that Michigan is the first contest where Bush
has a sitting governor _ John Engler _ working strenuously for him.
</P>
<P>
   But Michigan is less dominated by religious conservatives than
South Carolina, and McCain's aides argued that its blend of
working-class ethnic voters and regular Republicans would prove
more fertile ground for their candidate. They also said that
because of the short time period they would be able to run about
even with Bush in spending on television commercials, even though
outside groups have already weighed in here against McCain as well.
</P>
<P>
   On NBC's ``Meet the Press,'' McCain reached out to Catholic
voters when he was asked about Bush's appearance at Bob Jones
University, a center of the Christian right in South Carolina. He
said his rival should have spoken out against ``the things you've
said in the past about the pope and other religious leaders that
are disgraceful. Let's get into the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   On his bus, he also placed a thank-you phone call to Rep. Peter
King, a Long Island, N.Y., Republican who announced Sunday that he
was switching his allegiance from Bush to McCain. King, who is
Catholic and from a heavily Catholic district, has complained about
Bush's appearance at Bob Jones.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Despite Bush's new posture, it was clear Sunday that not all of
his and his supporters' aggressive tactics had been left in South
Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   A harsh negative ad by the National Smokers Alliance that
assailed McCain for advocating a huge tax increase (without
mentioning the fact that it was a tax on tobacco) was being
broadcast here as it was in South Carolina. And Bush himself has at
least one ad running in Michigan that mentions McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also used the phrase ``Kevorkian's lawyer'' Sunday to refer
to Geoffrey Fieger, a Democrat who ran against Engler, the
governor, in 1988, and who has been running radio ads criticizing
Bush and Engler as ``dumb and dumber.'' Bush described Fieger, who
has in fact represented the assisted-suicide advocate Dr. Jack
Kevorkian in his murder trials, as ``the most liberal of liberal
Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   As he did in South Carolina, Bush used a surrogate to help him
attack McCain, in this case Engler. ``McCain has absolutely courted
some of our _ he's fraternized with some of the worst people,
politically speaking, they're our sworn foes,'' Engler said in one
appearance. ``He has tried to bring some of them in to influence
the result.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also reached out _ briefly _ to Christian conservatives,
who helped provide his margin of victory in South Carolina, as he
worshiped in a church in Grand Rapids. That part of western
Michigan has perhaps the densest concentration of religious
conservatives in a state that is otherwise largely Catholic and not
particularly fundamentalist.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an appearance in Southfield, at Lawrence Technological
University, Bush made one of his most energetic speeches in weeks.
``Listen to me now,'' he told the crowd. ``There are 260 days more
to no more Clinton-Gore!''
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McCain's aides said that their candidate had made several
mistakes in South Carolina, straying from his winning themes of New
Hampshire to run a campaign that focused too heavily on political
technique as he talked about abandoning negative ads or complained
about ``push-polls.''
</P>
<P>
   Sunday, appearing at rallies to the theme song of ``Star Wars,''
the senator let his enthusiastic audiences know that he would not
let his loss in South Carolina stop him. He made references
throughout the day to his years as a prisoner of war in North
Vietnam, locked away in the infamous ``Hanoi Hilton.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My friends,'' he said to several hundred cheering suppoorters
at Michigan State University, ``I lived in a hotel once where there
were no mints on the pillow. I know how to take a punch and I know
how to fight back.''
</P>
<P>
   He highlighted his congressional record of battling against
pork-barrel spending. Then, borrowing a line from onetime candidate
Steve Forbes, McCain repeatedly charged that state spending in
Texas had gone up under Bush, though he used two figures _ 34
percent and 36 percent. Under Clinton, he said, federal spending
had gone up 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now who do you want? A big-spender nonreformer or a guy with a
record?'' he asked the Michigan State audience.
</P>
<P>
   He also skewered Bush on the isssue of money in politics. ``In
five and a half years, as the governor of the state of Texas, he
did not propose a single campaign finance reform proposal in a
state where anything goes,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   (BEGIN OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   The Arizona senator showed no remorse for an attack ad, which he
had removed from television in South Carolina, that challenged
Bush's truthfulness and compared him to Clinton. The senator has
now pledged to run no negative advertising throughout the primary
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   (END OPTIONAL TRIM)
</P>
<P>
   McCain insisted that Bush had distorted the truth ``when he says
that I'm not a reformer, when he says that I'm a hypocrite, when he
says that I'm in the pocket of lobbyists.''

<P>
   FORT HOOD, Texas _ Soldiers on this sprawling post in central
Texas snap to salute when Maj. Gen. Rick J. Hillier strides by. He
is, after all, deputy commander of the Army's 3rd Corps and its
57,000 troops. But there is something unusual about this lanky
officer that gives soldiers pause.
</P>
<P>
   First there is his clipped accent, which sounds even stranger
down here in Texas. And then there is his uniform, his forest-green
beret and the two maple leaves he wears instead of a general's
stars.
</P>
<P>
   Hillier, second in charge of one of the Army's four corps, a
senior officer overseeing the operations of three Army divisions,
is a Canadian.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some found it a little strange at first,'' he said as he
oversaw a group of National Guard soldiers preparing to leave Fort
Hood for Bosnia. ``Now it doesn't seem to matter that I'm in a
Canadian uniform. They just view me as part of the team.''
</P>
<P>
   The presence of foreign officers on American bases is nothing
new. American troops work closely with NATO forces in Europe,
thousands of foreign officers come to the nation's war colleges
each year, and the armed services regularly exchange officers with
other nations.
</P>
<P>
   But Hillier's position is unique.
</P>
<P>
   He is by far the highest-ranking foreign officer to serve in the
United States. And unlike foreigners who serve as advisers or
liaisons, he holds a high position in the chain of command _ the
only foreign officer who does, Army officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``He gets all the privileges of someone accorded his rank,''
said James M. Pahris, the director of the Army's exchange programs.
``And he is doing very viable work for us.''
</P>
<P>
   In this country, where sovereignty over national security
matters is paramount, Hillier's position has been a sensitive one.
Even though he has served at Fort Hood for more than a year and a
half, the Army has done little to publicize his appointment.
</P>
<P>
   There are also, by law, explicit limits on the authority he has
over American troops, as there are for all 107 foreign officers and
noncommissioned officers from 13 countries serving in the Army
today.
</P>
<P>
   While his American aides follow his orders as crisply as they
would any other general's, he cannot formally assume command from
the corps commander, Lt. Gen. Leon J. LaPorte. If he needs to issue
a written order, LaPorte signs it.
</P>
<P>
   He also cannot promote a soldier, nor can he punish one under
the Uniform Code of Military Justice. And the law prohibits him
from officially representing the Canadian government or serving as
a conduit for information, classified or unclassified, between the
two armies.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no secret lurking around in the dark for things,''
explained Lt. Gen. William C. Leach, Canada's army chief.
</P>
<P>
   Hillier owes his position to the transformation the Canadian
army has undergone since the end of the Cold War.
</P>
<P>
   Canada's decision in 1993 to withdraw its ground forces from
Europe left its commanders without the close interaction with NATO
and, especially, American military operations they felt they needed
at a time when doctrine, tactics and technology were radically
evolving. With Canada's entire military being only slightly larger
than the Army's 3rd Corps, the Canadians had few opportunities to
experience military operations at the level of an American Army
corps, Leach said.
</P>
<P>
   So Leach approached his American counterparts three years ago
and proposed creating a ranking position for a Canadian officer _
not as an observer, but as an integral part of the Army's
structure.
</P>
<P>
   ``I needed something more than captains and majors in
exchanges,'' Leach said. ``We simply didn't have the same
day-to-day contact we had. That started to bother me.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillier, who is 44 and a rising star in the Canadian military,
arrived at Fort Hood in July 1998. At the time, he was a brigadier
general and served as the 3rd Corps' assistant deputy commander.
When Canada promoted him to major general last year, the Army made
him deputy.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the limits on Hillier's authority, Canadian and Americanials say the arrangement has been fruitful _ for both armies.
</P>
<P>
   Leach said it had exposed the Canadian army to concepts and
experiments the Americans are exploring, citing as an example the
Army's work to improve communications for tactical units. At the
same time, it has exposed the Americans to Canada's way of doing
things, particularly its extensive experience in peacekeeping
operations.
</P>
<P>
   Hillier arrived just as the 3rd Corps was taking over the
mission of training American soldiers for NATO's peacekeeping
mission in Bosnia, including troops from the 1st Calvary Division,
based here, and, most recently, the 49th Armored Division of the
Texas National Guard. Hillier has himself served in Bosnia, with
the U.N. force during that country's war and with NATO's operation
after the conflict ended in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``His vast knowledge has been just invaluable,'' the 49th's
commander, Maj. Gen. Robert L. Halverson, said at a recent ceremony
marking the division's deployment to Bosnia. ``He was involved
right from the beginning to help build the training program and
then to see to it it was executed properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Hillier is due to leave his post in June, but Leach has begun
discussions about assigning a new Canadian general to continue his
work.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, Hillier, who was born in Newfoundland, has settled
well into Texas life. He lives on post in the deputy commander's
house. His wife, Joyce, like other commanders' spouses, is active
in Fort Hood's social life and family programs. His son, Steven, is
a junior at Killeen High School and a cadet captain in the ROTC
program.

<P>
   The U.S. Army, Hillier said, has taught him things large and
small. He cited its way of honoring troops with simple things like
retirement ceremonies and the coin mementos officers routinely hand
out. He has also learned something else, which suggests Canadian
generals are not that different from American ones: in Texas,
unlike in his homeland, golf is a winter sport.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wouldn't mind retiring here,'' he said.

<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ The smiles came last on a day of emotional
extremes for Dale Jarrett. By Sunday's end, the defending Winston
Cup Series champion had won his third Daytona 500, considered the
Super Bowl of Nascar, before a crowd of 190,000 at Daytona
International Speedway. And there, to top it off, was the legendary
stock car driver Richard Petty, extending his hand in
congratulations.
</P>
<P>
   ``That sent chills up my spine,'' Jarrett said.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-four hours before the race, he certainly did not feel
like the race favorite. His Ford Taurus sat in a garage with damage
to the both front fenders, hood and rear bumper, the result of a
collision with Jeff Gordon and Bill Elliott late in practice on
Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Hopeless? Not with Robert Yates Racing, the megabucks team
owner. Three fabricators were flown in from North Carolina and,
working from 4:45 a.m. on, they virtually rebuilt the car's body.
</P>
<P>
   Concerned, Jarrett nursed the car early. But by the fourth lap,
``I knew the car was every bit as good as before.'' He led for 89
of the 200 laps and averaged 155.669 miles an hour in winning the
race under a yellow caution flag after Jimmy Spencer crashed his
Ford into a wall with little more than two laps to go.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett, who started from the pole, won $2,277,975, the biggest
payday in Nascar history. It includes $1 million from R.J. Reynolds
as one of five Winston Cup races rewarding the winner with that
amount.
</P>
<P>
   The Newton, N.C., native also won the Daytona 500 in 1993 and
'96.
</P>
<P>
   The next four finishers were also in Fords, including Jeff
Burton in second place and Bill Elliott in third. The highest
Pontiac finish was sixth, and Chevrolet had only one car among the
top 12.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett made a dramatic pass of the Pontiac-driving Johnny
Benson coming out of Turn 2 on the 197th lap to win the race. If he
had deserted his drafting help and not passed Benson, he probably
would have faded out of contention.
</P>
<P>
   ``I faked high and he went up there, and as soon as I saw him
move up the racetrack, I cut my car dead left,'' Jarrett said. ``I
was committed. If I would have had to go to the apron, which I
almost had to, that's where I was going. But I had a run and then
the 99 helped push me by.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton, No. 99, had a simple explanation.
</P>
<P>
   ``With my car, I couldn't run the middle,'' he said. ``I had to
run at the bottom.''
</P>
<P>
   Benson, still looking for a big-bucks sponsor to compete with
the big teams, flirted with an upset. Starting from the 27th post
position, he worked his way to the lead on Lap 158 and held on
through Lap 196, despite having five Fords breathing down his
bumper. On Lap 186, Mark Martin, running second, went high to pass,
and he apparently thought Jarrett was going to go with him,
providing drafting support. Instead Jarrett swooped low and took
second, while Martin quickly dropped to sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about that later, Martin said tersely, ``I got lied to.''
He chose not to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett acknowledged that he had agreed via radio to work with
Martin, but not indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``We tried it for a lap and didn't really get a very good run,''
Jarrett said. ``Next time around, I had every intention of
following him again, but in my rearview mirror I saw the 99 car
dive to the bottom of the race track. I realized that if I didn't
go low, too, I would lose my spot for sure.''
</P>
<P>
   After the race, Martin threw up his arms and yelled, ``What
happened?'' as Jarrett wheeled by him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I totally understand that,'' Jarrett said. ``I would have been
the same way.''
</P>
<P>
   There were six cautions in the race, and there were no crashes
until the 194th lap. And then Spencer's wreck took the suspense out
of the last two laps.
</P>
<P>
   Burton sounded far from bitter. ``The 88 car probably still
would have won,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Benson knew he had gambled by changing just two tires at his
last pit stop, but he said Jarrett earned the victory.
</P>
<P>
   ``I did everything I could to block him on that pass,'' he said.
``Put it this way: I couldn't get him any lower.''
</P>
<P>
   There were many other dramas during the race, one that saw the
Fords take a decided early lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what I saw, the Chevys need to work a little better
together,'' said Todd Parrott, Jarrett's crew chief. ``I think the
Fords just more or less teamed up with each other and didn't work
with them very well. We were at a disadvantage two years and we had
to work at it. Now they have to.''
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in the race:
</P>
<P>
   Bobby Labonte's crew crippled his chance of a victory at the pit
stop on Lap 134. As he was returning to the track in third
position, one of his tires rolled into pit lane, prompting a
penalty from Nascar. He had to go to the back of the lead lap,
putting him 27th.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, he finished sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Ward Burton benefited the most from the stop, going from ninth
place to fifth. He wound up eighth.
</P>
<P>
   On the third yellow caution of the race, precipitated by Tony
Stewart's brush against a wall, which left metal fragments on the
track, Stewart injured a member of his pit crew. Mike Lingerfelt,
the front tire changer, went to move a tire out of Stewart's path
as the car was leaving the pit area and Stewart hit him. The tire
went flying into the infield as Lingerfelt fell in a heap.
</P>
<P>
   Lingerfelt, 23, from Marietta, S.C., suffered a fractured left
leg and was transported to Halifax Medical Center for surgery.
Stewart, who said it was difficult to concentrate on racing
thereafter, finished 17th.
</P>
<P>
   Gordon, the three-time Winston Cup Series champion, was
eliminated from contention after his Chevrolet developed an oil
leak on the 30th lap. He fell four laps behind before he could
return and finished 37th.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't run with those Fords, but I was making some
gains,'' Gordon said. ``I think we would have been able to get up
to about fifth or sixth, but that's about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, the day belonged to the Fords, particularly Jarrett's.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a day full of emotions,'' he said, ``but in the end it
couldn't have worked out any better.'' &QL;

 COMMENTARY: THE McCAIN COMEBACK  
(lb) 
 By WILLIAM SAFIRE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The bipartisan Comeback Adviser is again reporting
for duty. In light of the rallying round George W. Bush by South
Carolina's religious right, John McCain must arouse the Republican
center in California and New York. Here's how:
</P>
<P>
   1. Identify the adversary. You were clobbered in a barrage of
ads and in low-blow phone banks as a liberal, unstable,
baby-killing hypocrite. You should now tie the victorious radical
right firmly around Bush's neck, portraying him as its captive.
Therefore _
</P>
<P>
   2. Do battle for the soul of the party. Your opponent, after New
Hampshire, made a Faustian bargain with the far right. Drop all
ambivalence about negative campaigning; let your assailants beware
the fury of Mr. Nice Guy maligned. Specifically _
</P>
<P>
   3. Make Bob Jones U. the scene of ``the Bush surrender.'' While
there, he failed to dissociate himself from its anti-black and
anti-Catholic reputation. Let Bush keep the hard right; remind
Republicans on both coasts that Bush wanted Buchanan in the GOP
when you invited him out. In the same way, Pat Robertson threatened
a mass exodus of his followers if McCain won; what party needs
disloyalists like that?
</P>
<P>
   4. Seize on the triumph of the abortion extremists. Bush made a
deal with them to keep the rigid party plank prohibiting all
abortion; you would modify that in cases of rape, incest and danger
to the life of the mother. Many Republican women are 100 percent
with you on this. Show how Bush's sellout to the cottage industry
of anti-abortion extremists would enable Al Gore to enlarge the
gender gap and bury the GOP.
</P>
<P>
   5. Concede no groups other than the hard right, which Bush will
now pretend he doesn't know. Hispanics count heavily in California;
get your strongest Latino and Latina supporters to cut spots for
you there on Spanish-language radio.
</P>
<P>
   6. Put your opponent on the defensive on his record. Challenge
him to one-on-one foreign policy debates. Hammer his tax cut as
selfishly forcing our children to pay back the money this
generation borrowed.
</P>
<P>
   7. Use his most effective ad against him. ``He likened me to
Clinton,'' wails Bush, a message that did you in, according to much
of the shocked punditariat. But your ``he twists the truth like
Clinton'' _ especially now that he's spending heavily to make the
line famous _ is your best shot at his most vulnerable spot. Press
it, concentrating on Bush's big mistake: At every stop, ridicule
his excessive claim of bringing a patient's bill of rights to Texas
_ when in fact he did all he could to stop it. That's Clintonian
truth-twisting. And in that regard _
</P>
<P>
   8. Blast as ludicrous the Establishment candidate's attempt to
snatch your message of political reform. Because Bush saw your
reform appeal reaching voters, he suddenly adopted its rhetoric.
What will he grab next, your war record? Stealing the slogan of
reform for saturation advertising _ financed by anti-reform money _
does not magically transform the Old Guard's favorite into a
reformer. Bush's campaign has been slamming you as a phony and a
hypocrite; return fire by slamming his ``pretense'' and fakery.
</P>
<P>
   9. Remain the Happy Warrior, but focus on the warrior. You may
have the most likable grin since Ike, but the time has come to set
aside the goo-goo, high-road, ain't-this-fun attitude. Saving the
party for individualists and saving the country from a third term
of Clinton-Gore requires a vigorous counterattack. Present yourself
plainly as the only Republican who can win now that Bush has
abandoned the vital center to Gore.
</P>
<P>
   10. Make your mantras ``captive candidate,'' ``pandering to
extremists,'' ``surrender at Bob Jones U.,''
``reformer-come-lately,'' ``the real McCain,'' ``pretense,''
``grown-up'' and ``the only Republican who can win in November.''
</P>
<P>
   Adlai Stevenson said, ``He who slings mud loses ground.'' But he
who lets mud be slung on him without exposing the mudslingers loses
elections.
</P>
<P>
   The downside to this comeback strategy is not that it would
split the party (Bush's Carolina surrender already did that) but
that it might be portrayed as intemperate. A great dare, perhaps,
but McCain's place should not be among those cold and timid souls
who know neither victory nor defeat.

FBI GOES TO HUNGARY TO HUNT RUSSIAN MOB 
</HEADLINE>
  (EXCLUSIVE; 10:45 p.m. ET EMBARGO for print media; 12:01 a.m. ET
EMBARGO for electronic media.) 
(lb) 
 By RAYMOND BONNER   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ In a move that underlines the growing concern about
Russian organized crime, the FBI is opening its first office abroad
in which its agents will serve as full-time investigators.
</P>
<P>
   The office is set to open next month in Budapest, which is home
to many Russian mob leaders, who see the Hungarian capital as a
well-situated portal to Western Europe and the United States.
</P>
<P>
   ``This will be truly a working squad,'' said Thomas V. Fuentes,
chief of the FBI's organized-crime division. ``They will develop
and operate criminal informants. They will gather intelligence.
There is no precedent for that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarian government has requested help from the United
States in breaking up the Russian gangs that operate from Budapest.
But by allowing the bureau to open a full-fledged office, Hungary
has ceded more sovereignty than many other nations _ including the
United States _ would ever consider, U.S. officials say.
</P>
<P>
   FBI agents will have the right to carry weapons and, in
conjunction with their Hungarian counterparts, to make arrests. The
FBI will also have the final say over the hiring and firing of the
10 Hungarian agents who will work in the office, alongside five
U.S. agents.
</P>
<P>
   The bureau has long had agents posted in U.S. embassies as legal
attaches, which means they are semi-diplomats, acting as liaison
officers with the local police or as trainers. The bureau has also
sent agents abroad temporarily to help foreign governments with
major criminal investigations, as it did after the 1998 embassy
bombings in Africa.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of deepening contacts with law-enforcement officials
in Hungary, the push to set up an FBI office in Budapest has come
from the organized-crime section of the bureau and the U.S. Embassy
in Hungary.
</P>
<P>
   Along the way, officials have had to overcome the concerns of
some at the State Department that an armed clash between FBI agents
and criminals would create an international incident. And many at
the FBI are uncomfortable at the thought of armed agents thousands
of miles from headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Hungarians, too, remain wary about some of the details. It
was only last week that the Hungarians and Americans reached
agreement on sharing criminal intelligence. The Hungarians had
balked, and remain nervous, because they fear that highly sensitive
evidence gathered by criminal investigators about the Russian mobs
could be made public in U.S. courts.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. officials say that if the FBI office in Budapest succeeds,
it could be a model for similar offices in other regions struggling
against the penetration of Russian organized crime, including the
Baltic states, Nigeria and South Africa.
</P>
<P>
   One early target of the FBI's Budapest office is expected to be
Semyon Y. Mogilevich, a Russian citizen who has operated out of
Budapest for a decade. Recently he has been linked to the growing
money-laundering investigation in the United States involving the
Bank of New York.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. investigators said that Mogilevich's associates met with
Peter Berlin, a central figure in the investigation, who recently
surrendered to the FBI and pleaded guilty to money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Mogilevich is also the target of a separate money-laundering and
financial-fraud investigation by the FBI in Philadelphia, according
to federal officials and Mogilevich's lawyer, who denied that his
client had done anything illegal.
</P>
<P>
   FBI reports say Mogilevich has engaged in trafficking of drugs,
refugees and weapons, has run prostitution rings and has tortured
and murdered his opponents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our objective is to strangle the Russian mafia that operates
here,'' said the U.S. ambassador in Hungary, Peter Tufo, who has
been an important and enthusiastic backer of the FBI's war on the
Russian mafia.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not a mom-and-pop operation,'' he said about the
Russian mob, which has a global operation reaching from Moscow to
Budapest to New York, Los Angeles and South Miami. ``It's a
multibillion-dollar global enterprise.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE _ OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Another major Russian crime group, the Solntsevskaya
organization, has stepped up its operations out of Budapest, Tufo
said. The organization is headed by Sergei Mikhailov, according to
European and U.S. law-enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Mikhailov, who lives in Moscow most of the time, was acquitted
by a Swiss court last year of money-laundering charges, but that
has not altered the view of U.S. law-enforcement officials that he
is a person who needs to be stopped.
</P>
<P>
   An FBI report in 1995 described the Solntsevskaya organization
as the most powerful Eurasian organized-crime organization ``in the
world in terms of wealth, influence and financial control.''
</P>
<P>
   Fuentes said the bureau is prepared for criticism from some
quarters that the FBI should not be expanding abroad, that it
should concentrate on combating crime at home.
</P>
<P>
   His response is that the activities of the Russian mob are ``a
direct threat to us,'' he said. ``This is a measured response to a
documented problem. It is not a knee-jerk response, not a response
to Bank of New York.''

SONICS FOUND RIGHT PERSON TO SWAY PAYTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If you are among the relatively few eyewitnesses to
the Sonics this season _ there is so much empty space in KeyArena
these days that it has drawn the attention of the Hubble telescope
_ your curiosity might have been piqued by the presence of Chuck
Person.
</P>
<P>
   As in: What is he doing out there?
</P>
<P>
   In his 14th NBA season, Person at 35 is the oldest Sonic, and
his game doesn't appear a day older than 50. He's played in barely
half the games, averaging three points in 10 minutes per contest.
The one-time ``Rifleman'' shoots 30 percent from the field,
including just 25 percent from behind the stripe, his one-time
specialty.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 8, he is neither a help on the boards nor in handling
the ball. And defense is something he figures goes around deyard.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reputation is as a shooter,'' he said. ``But I think I can
do more things to help this team.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he is pulling off what has been one of the more
difficult tasks with this franchise over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   He talks with Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Not at him. Not behind his back. Not against him _ hey, nobody
can do that. It's more productive to shake a finger at a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   But Person can talk with him, a job almost as hard as trying to
one-up Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary is a unique, sometimes puzzling guy,'' Person said. ``He
doesn't let a lot of people close to him. You have to earn his
trust and respect. You have to walk, and talk, where he's been.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 10 years in Seattle, Payton has gone from arrogant rookie
with minimal game to an MVP-caliber star. But the arc has never
been as smooth as it has been for Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson,
Larry Bird, Karl Malone or John Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   Payton can be uncommonly prickly to friends as well as
opponents. His ultra-competitiveness combined with his
self-proclaimed street attitude has often alienated coaches and
teammates. And without a championship as a shield, Payton will
always hear the claim that his approach ultimately will cost him
and his team.
</P>
<P>
   But the circumstances this time around for the Sonics are
different, even unique, in his tenure. The roster was remade in his
image _ younger, faster, shorter, more mercurial. It was remade
with the expectation that he would lead it _ something he had not
done here.
</P>
<P>
   For a lone wolf, it is an awkward fit. Payton would much rather
be the gunslinger than the marshal.
</P>
<P>
   He can say that leading the NBA in minutes played over the last
half-decade should be enough. He can also say that topping the club
in points, assists and steals should also be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Good arguments. But the fact is, unless he leads by word and
deed, the Sonics have no shot.
</P>
<P>
   Person is the guy with the brass to tell Payton that the old
Gary won't get it done in some situations, and he can no longer
embarrass himself or the franchise with his tantrums. Person is the
one to remind that the only one left among Shawn Kemp, George Karl,
Tim Grgurich, Nate McMillan, Detlef Schrempf, Sam Perkins or Hersey
Hawkins is Payton.
</P>
<P>
   It's him or close to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Making the point, however, requires a little shrewdness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, he's willing to listen,'' Person said. ``He's
still going to be Gary; he's going to rant and rave. But I always
make sure never to tell him something in front of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will pull him aside, maybe during a timeout, maybe before
practice, maybe 11 o'clock at night. But he's willing to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those moments happened during a game in Milwaukee last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary was coasting,'' Person said. ``I told one of the coaches,
`Gary's struggling. You better get him out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``What? You know he'll go off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know. I got him.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton was pulled before halftime, and predictably erupted. But
Person pulled him aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `G, if you don't get it together, we can't win.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Payton came out big in the second half, and the Sonics beat Karl
and the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely are things so straightforward or productive, because
Payton is still so volatile. Last week, Payton followed up his
career-best 41-point night against Washington with a 4-for-19
stinker against Sacramento. That's what happens when one deals in
humans rather than binary code.
</P>
<P>
   Payton was back in form Saturday night, scoring 14 of his 27
points in the third quarter as the Sonics beat the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Payton's leadership has to come away from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to him about practicing,'' Person said. ``He has to
practice. Sometimes he can start practice, and then sit down. But
this team is so new to each other, Gary has to practice with them
every day in order for things to jell.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadership also includes the small stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to him about bringing up his teammates' names in
the quotes in the papers,'' he said. ``Gary needs to trust and
respect his teammates, and once he mentions them, it gives them a
lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Person has slipped into a role once filled by McMillan, and more
recently by David Wingate, players senior to Payton who worked as
easily with him as anyone can. Some will contend that the Sonics'
biggest personnel mistake last year was cutting Wingate.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Person who horses around with Payton, or spots a flaw
or suggests a better shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always remember something one of my old coaches, Bob Hill,
told me,'' Person said. ``He said you have to make a bad night into
a good night, because the good nights take care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Sonics are so dependent on Payton, if Person can
influence him to turn three bad games into good ones, it can make
the difference between a fourth-place seed in the Western playoffs
and a seventh seed.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the same as hitting the game-winning 3-pointer. But
sometimes its important for the Rifleman to ride shotgun.

 GENDER, GENES ARE LINKED TO PAIN RESPONSE
 &HT;    (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Genes and gender explain part of the difference in
how people feel pain, and also why some get more relief from
painkillers than others do, scientists said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   These insights are emerging from research that is probing pain
at its most basic levels, genes and proteins, and from computerized
imaging of the brain in action. These studies might yield highly
specific new pain drugs with few side effects, scientists said.
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, they said, the research is revealing some of
the reasons why methods such as hypnosis and distraction can be
effective pain-reducers.
</P>
<P>
   When scientists at McGill University in Montreal monitored
volunteers' brain activity using a functional MRI device, they saw
that areas that are highly active when someone was focusing on a
painful stimulus were significantly dampened when the person was
distracted by a task, said Catherine Bushnell, a McGill
psychologist.
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw pain signals decreased before they ever got to'' a part
of the brain where pain is perceived, Bushnell said. ``You really
can teach people to reduce their pain'' through distraction or
hypnotic suggestion, she said at the annual meeting of the American
Association for the Advancement of Science.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, some people apparently are genetically programmed to be
more or less sensitive to pain, said other scientists, commenting
on both animal and human research.
</P>
<P>
   ``Females are more sensitive to pain and respond less to
analgesics,'' said Jeffrey Mogil, a psychologist at the University
of Illinois in Champaign-Urbana. The differences are not large, he
said, but have been demonstrated quite clearly in animals. The
scientists said they could only guess at evolutionary reasons for
this, but they said that because of these gender differences,
females might need stronger doses of painkillers. It also has been
found that even within gender, there are individual differences in
feeling pain that are linked to still undiscovered genes.
</P>
<P>
   These genes explain ``why we don't all respond to pain in the
same way, and why, for example, the same dose of morphine works
better on some people than others,'' Mogil said.
</P>
<P>
   He described breeds of mice, some of which are exquisitely
sensitive to pain while others are stoic in the face of painful
stimuli. In humans, he said, ``whiners may actually be in more pain
while macho types aren't.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, said Mogil, it appears that males and females
employ slightly different brain mechanisms in their response to
pain. If true, he said, one implication might be developing
gender-specific painkilling drugs.
</P>
<P>
   The most daunting area of pain research, the scientists said, is
in understanding and controlling chronic pain. While acute pain is
a symptom that goes away when the cause is resolved, chronic pain
is really a disease unto itself, said Allan Basbaum, chairman of
anatomy at the University of California in San Francisco.
``Persistent pain produces changes in the nervous system'' so that
the sensation continues long after it has been useful to the
person.
</P>
<P>
   Basbaum said that research has shown that, in cases of people
who suffer from chronic pain, the brain makes proteins that it
normally does not manufacture. That suggests that these proteins
could be new targets for drugs that could selectively obliterate
chronic pain without causing side effects. These findings have
drawn molecular scientists to the field of chronic pain research.
</P>
<P>
   If specific genes are misbehaving in some kinds of chronic pain,
then gene therapy is a potential route of treatment, the scientists
said. One strategy would be to replace or counteract the effect of
the genetic pain culprit, they said. Another might be to give
patients genes that cause brain and nerve cells to make larger
amounts of endorphins, a natural painkiller in the body.

THIS DEFEAT WAS MORE LIKE A WIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MICHAEL ROSENTHAL  
 c.2000 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Marco Antonio Barrera is an example of a fighter
who was victorious in defeat.
</P>
<P>
   Only three years ago, it seemed his on-the-rise career was
shattered after consecutive knockout losses to Junior Jones. At 23,
he was dismissed by some as a has-been and admitted that he
suffered significant psychological damage.
</P>
<P>
   His response?
</P>
<P>
   He accomplished something profoundly rare in boxing: He
resurrected himself upon the rubble of two taxing, disheartening
losses that might've destroyed a lesser man.
</P>
<P>
   Now, he has combined more discipline and enough defensive skills
to avoid unnecessary punishment with the same raw aggression he
used to climb to the top of his division as a young fighter who was
promoted by the Forum.
</P>
<P>
   We saw the result on Saturday, when he turned in one of the most
remarkable performances in recent memory.
</P>
<P>
   Seven fights into what had been an unconvincing comeback,
Barrera beat up one of boxing's most-feared champions _ Erik
Morales _ in Las Vegas.
</P>
<P>
   No, he didn't win in the eyes of the judges. He lost a close
decision in what certainly was a very close fight.
</P>
<P>
   However, he stunned the boxing world by making Morales look
beatable. Barrera, hurt so badly by Jones, stood up to Morales'
best punches and never ceased moving forward in what will be
remembered as a classic, give-and-take brawl.
</P>
<P>
   Morales might have connected on a few more punches but Barrera
landed the more meaningful, more pain-inducing blows. He hurt
Morales several times and the champion's face was badly bruised and
battered after the fight, much worse than Barrera's.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll tell you the truth, he had me reeling and hurt several
times during the fight,'' Morales admitted.
</P>
<P>
   When it was over, Morales was a bit less great and Barrera had
re-emerged as one of the elite _ as well as exciting _ fighters in
the world.
</P>
<P>
   Barrera, who had poured his soul into the fight, was bitter
afterward.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can tell HBO that their fighter isn't that good,'' he said
in the ring minutes after the decision was announced.
</P>
<P>
   Distraught, he missed the point: It's not that Morales (begin
ital)isn't(end ital) that good; it's that Barrera (begin
ital)is(end ital) _ again.
</P>
<P>
   Rematch? HBO executive Lou DiBella called immediately for a
rematch. However, it might not happen soon.
</P>
<P>
   The winner of the Morales-Barrera fight was expected to face
Naseem Hamed in a lucrative featherweight bout, assuming Hamed
beats Vuyani Bungu on March 11. Morales, who said he will no longer
fight at the junior featherweight limit of 122, probably will take
the Hamed fight if the big-talking Briton has the guts to sign.
</P>
<P>
   That means Morales wouldn't fight Barrera again until late this
year or beyond.
</P>
<P>
   However, don't pity Barrera. If he can maintain focus after such
a disappointing loss, he will remain in line for many meaningful,
good-money matchups in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   He earned that on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Decisions, decisions: The scoring of Saturday's bout by judges
Duane Ford (114-113 Barrera) and Carol Castellano (114-113 Morales)
was no disgrace. The fight was that close.
</P>
<P>
   However, judge Dalby Shirley's card _ 115-112 for Morales _
bordered on ridiculous.
</P>
<P>
   Barrera was awarded a knockdown in the 12th round, which means
Shirley's score would've been 116-112. That gives Morales an 8-4
edge in rounds, which is a clear victory.
</P>
<P>
   No way that fight was so one-sided.
</P>
<P>
   Shirley's score was the only thing that marred an otherwise
wonderful evening, one that boxing sorely needed.
</P>
<P>
   Referee Mitch Halpern made a mistake on the knockdown _ which
appeared to be a slip _ but it had no bearing on the result.
Morales would've won a majority decision without the point
deduction.
</P>
<P>
   Anonymity: Derrell Coley, who faces Oscar De La Hoya in the
biggest fight of his life on Saturday in New York, has been one of
the most frustrated fighters of the past several years.
</P>
<P>
   Why?
</P>
<P>
   The 29-year-old from the Washington D.C. area had been ranked
the No.1 welterweight contender by the WBC for roughly two years _
until De La Hoya displaced him after (begin ital)losing(end ital)
to Felix Trinidad _ but has yet to receive a championship bout.
</P>
<P>
   He said he was promised a bout with Trinidad after he beat De La
Hoya only to hear second-hand the announcement that Trinidad would
fight David Reid instead.
</P>
<P>
   Even today, the most-asked question leading up to Saturday's
fight is: Who's Derrell Coley?
</P>
<P>
   ``It got to the point where I didn't like boxing,'' he said. ``I
didn't want to box. I'm not a quitter, though. I love a challenge.
I've survived this and now I have my title shot.''
</P>
<P>
   In effect, De La Hoya-Coley (begin ital)is(end ital) a
championship fight. The winner is expected to be elevated to
champion assuming Trinidad remains at 154 after his fight with Reid
and gives up his 147-pound title, which is likely.
</P>
<P>
   Still, few know who he is.
</P>
<P>
   Coley (34-1-2, with 24 knockouts) is similar to Oba Carr. He's
well-schooled, quick and only a moderately hard puncher. He had a
fine amateur career: 96 victories, four losses before turning pro
in 1990.
</P>
<P>
   Many believe he won the only fight he officially lost, to Carr
in 1995. Carr was promoted by Don King.
</P>
<P>
   Three of his biggest victories were over Terrence Alli (TKO in
11 rounds) in 1994, Ray Lovato (decision) the following year and
Romallis Ellis (decision) in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Still, no respect.
</P>
<P>
   Coley blames his promoters _ he's jumped from one to another _
but acknowledges that he has nothing special on which to hang a
marketing campaign. He's a good fighter without compelling
background.
</P>
<P>
   Thus, he's in the the difficult position of being a significant
risk: too much talent, not enough payoff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Not everyone is fortunate enough to get an Olympic gold
medal,'' he said, referring to De La Hoya. ``The professional level
is different. You could be a great amateur and a bad pro.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think everyone deserves a chance. Why would they have
ratings if they didn't plan to abide by them?''
</P>
<P>
   Coley will make $1 million-plus against De La Hoya, which dwarfs
his previous high of $175,000 against Carr.
</P>
<P>
   However, he insists this isn't about money. Again, he's had to
scrape and claw for everything he's accomplished in boxing while De
La Hoya took the high road from the Olympics to superstardom.
</P>
<P>
   For Coley, this is about acknowledgment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think he's earned anything he has,'' Coley said of De
La Hoya. ``... He's way overrated. They made De La Hoya into a
superstar. He didn't earn superstardom.
</P>
<P>
   ``They pick who they want to be successful in boxing and I had
my frustrating days. Now, I'm the happiest fighter in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm getting my opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Bad night? Coley might've been exposed as vulnerable against
journeyman Pat Coleman when the two met in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   Coley was dominating the fight when Coleman threw a punch that
Coley said landed on his shoulder in the 10th round. It apparently
hit a nerve and Coley was knocked out.
</P>
<P>
   The bout was later ruled no contest when Coleman tested positive
for drugs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was gone,'' Coley admitted. ``Regardless of the drugs, it
was a good shot.''
</P>
<P>
   If Coleman can render Coley helpless with one punch, imagine
what might happen against De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   Say what? Reid, who like Coley is promoted by America Presents,
predicted Coley will beat De La Hoya.
</P>
<P>
   ``All his talk about the `new Oscar,' or `the original Oscar,'
or the `new and improved Oscar,' only shows me that he's the (begin
ital)same(end ital) Oscar,'' said Reid, who fights Trinidad on
March 3. ``And that's the Oscar who was shown up by Pernell
Whitaker, lost to Felix Trinidad and given a close shave by Ike
Quartey. He hates to be hit, so he won't take any chances in this
fight. I think Derrell Coley will give a clinic for as long as it
lasts.
</P>
<P>
   ``After Feb.26, you won't be hearing any more talk about Oscar
moving up to 154 pounds. It wouldn't surprise me if he moved back
down to 140.''
</P>
<P>
   While some of what Reid says is true, he's off-base on his
prediction. Most believe De La Hoya will win easily.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbit punches: Boxing lost a memorable voice in Chuck Hull, the
ring announcer who died last week.
</P>
<P>
   Hull, 75, announced most of the big Las Vegas fights of the
1980s.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1980s, he personified the sport of boxing in Las
Vegas,'' said Marc Ratner, the executive director of the Nevada
State Athletic Commission. ...
</P>
<P>
   The decision to deny former champion Terry Norris a boxing
license in Nevada was sound.
</P>
<P>
   Those close to the 32-year-old have expressed concern about
damage to his brain. He already is difficult to understand because
of what has been called ``lazy speech syndrome'' and doctors fear
he could further deteriorate. ...
</P>
<P>
   Two Los Angeles amateurs are scheduled to compete in the U.S.
Olympic box-offs, Thursday through Saturday in Tampa, Fla.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Mosley faces Dante Craig at 147 pounds while Jose Navarro
takes on Roberto Benitez at 112 pounds. The winners advance to the
Americas Olympic qualifier. &QL;

GORE AND BRADLEY TO DEBATE AT HARLEM'S APOLLO THEATER
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRED KAPLAN  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ When Al Gore and Bill Bradley debate at Harlem's
Apollo Theater Monday night, it will be a historic event _ the
first time in recent memory, and perhaps the first time ever, that
a presidential debate has been held in the city's black community.
</P>
<P>
   African-Americans play a potentially vital role in elections
here. They constitute nearly a quarter of registered Democratic
voters statewide, almost half the party's vote in New York City.
</P>
<P>
   Yet they have rarely been courted so assiduously as in this
primary contest. The idea of a debate at the Apollo _ a renowned
site in Harlem _ is to make the courtship formal and permanent.
</P>
<P>
   ``This debate is so important because it breaks the
marginalization of the African-American community,'' the Rev. Al
Sharpton said in a phone interview Friday. ``It means politicians
can no longer act as if this community is not presidential
material. It means that four years from now, and four years after
that, everybody will have to debate in the black community and will
have to address our issues.''
</P>
<P>
   The plan for an Apollo event was hatched two weeks ago, when
Bradley attended services at the Rev. Floyd Flake's Allen AME
Baptist Church in Queens. Sharpton was also there. He and Flake
jointly proposed a candidates' debate at the Apollo sometime before
the March 7 New York primary. Bradley agreed. The challenge went
out to Gore, and he could hardly say no.
</P>
<P>
   It is an interesting, even an eyebrow-raising, alliance.
Sharpton, of course, is the flamboyant, street-marching,
protest-rallying activist. Flake, a former congressman who gave up
his House seat to spend more time with his congregation, is a
conservative who writes a column for the New York Post. Although a
Democrat, he has often supported the policies of the Republican
mayor, Rudolph Giuliani.
</P>
<P>
   Both men have their followings. Flake is especially influential
among church leaders. Sharpton has his detractors, as well, for
championing some disreputable causes _ most notably, Tawana Brawley
_ and for associating with anti-Semites.
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton admits that, for this primary election, the debate will
probably have less impact _ and will give the black community less
leverage _ than it might have had a couple of months ago, when the
Demcratic contest was more even. The polls show Gore has since
zoomed ahead of Bradley in New York _ and is favored by a 2-1
margin among black voters here.
</P>
<P>
   Still, Sharpton said, ``It's the precedent that counts.''
</P>
<P>
   Sharpton has not yet endorsed either candidate. He said he will
do so a few days after the debate.
</P>
<P>
   But in the past two weeks, Gore has picked up the endorsement of
nearly every other prominent black political leader, including
Representative Charles Rangel, state comptroller H. Carl McCall,
former mayor David Dinkins, Manhattan borough president Virginia
Fields, and Flake, who gave his blessing a week ago from his
pulpit, with Gore standing by his side.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley has picked up endorsements from several black
celebrities _ basketball star Michael Jordan, film director Spike
Lee, actor Laurence Fishburne. But in New York he has no major
black politicians and only a few black ministers with him.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley's strength here lies mainly in the fact that, as a
former New York Knicks star, he is one of the few white politicians
anywhere who has worked, on a professional and collegial level,
with black people. One of his campaign films shows him, as a young
Knicks player, visiting Harlem youth centers. He has also promised,
in several speeches, to encourage the hiring of blacks in all
federal agencies and Cabinet departments.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's strength is his association with President Clinton _ an
ambiguous factor elsewhere perhaps, but a clear boost here.
Nationwide, 88 percent of blacks give Clinton positive ratings
(compared with 55 percent of whites), and he is at least that
popular among New York blacks.
</P>
<P>
   There is some residual suspicion of Gore from his 1988 run for
the Democratic presidential nomination, when one of his opponents
was Jesse Jackson, and Gore's top local supporter, then-Mayor
Edward Koch, proclaimed that Jews would have to be ``crazy'' to
vote for Jackson.
</P>
<P>
   Still, that was a long time ago, and in this campaign, Koch, who
no longer enjoys much pull, supports Bradley anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Gore's favor among church leaders is crucial because churches
are the centers of African-American life in this city _ partly
because, through centuries of poverty and powerlessness, there were
few other institutions, or forums of any kind, for organized
activity, leadership, and expression.
</P>
<P>
   Their influence extends well past Sunday. Flake's church
operates a thriving private school; Flake is a key supporter of the
charter-school movement and _ unusual for Democrats here and
anathema to Gore _ school vouchers. The Rev. Calvin Butts, head of
the Abyssinian Baptist Church _ the former church, and political
rallying point, of former US Representative Adam Clayton Powell _
controls dozens of housing and economic-development projects in
Harlem.
</P>
<P>
   Though Sharpton has no church of his own, he speaks at several
churches with a preacher's passion and cadence, a talent that
helped create and still bolsters his legitimacy in the community.
</P>
<P>
   For several years, Democratic politicians here did not actively
pursue the black vote, partly because they figured they had it
wrapped up, partly because doing so might alienate white
conservatives, whose vote they also needed.
</P>
<P>
   Two things have changed recently. First, Republicans are nearly
a majority statewide, which means, to win, a Democrat must get as
many of his constituents as possible to go to the polls _
especially blacks, who tend to vote in smaller numbers but who,
when they do turn out, vote almost uniformly Democratic.
</P>
<P>
   Second, in this year's primary, there are no conservative
Democratic candidates. On racial and urban issues, Gore and Bradley
hold similar views.
</P>
<P>
   The two factors, together, compel both to make a big push for
black voters, including the direct appeal at the Apollo.

GORE, MRS. CLINTON MAKE JOINT APPEARANCE
</HEADLINE>
  (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANN SCALES  
 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ While Bill Bradley pondered the ramifications of
Senator John McCain's loss in Saturday's South Carolina primary, Al
Gore and Hillary Clinton made their first joint appearance of the
campaign season Sunday, attending a worship service and making
back-to-back speeches before a constituency that had not grown
tired of President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   After months of putting as much daylight between themselves as
possible for fear of stoking Clinton fatigue, the vice president
and the first lady sat side by side in a black church, swaying and
clapping throughout a three-hour service in which each gave the
other high praise from the pulpit, to the satisfaction of about
1,000 congregants.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in America is more qualified to lead us than our vice
president,'' Clinton said during the service at the Wilborn Temple
First Church of God in Christ. ``He knows what to do and how to do
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Gore said of Clinton: ``I know that she will stand up for all of
you, and I will stand up for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Their joint appearance followed months of worry among advisers
to both candidates about the sight of them together, especially in
New York, where Clinton is running for a US Senate seat, and
whether voters would be Clinton-fatigued after the president's two
terms.
</P>
<P>
   But given the site, a black church, and the setting, the
conclusion of the legislative weekend of the Black, Puerto Rican
and Hispanic Caucus in New York, and neither campaign had much to
worry about and neither candidate shied away from associating with
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Gore aides say the first lady can help him in New York, where
voters go to the polls in the March 7 presidential primary.
Clinton, like her husband, remains a popular figure among
Democratic base voters, especially minorities. ``There's no risk
with this constituency,'' one Gore aide said.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton had already accepted the invite and some local
politicians had suggested Gore, who gone in years past, also
attend.
</P>
<P>
   Elected leaders heaped praised on them both, while urging
minority voters not to ``give away elections'' by staying home.
``She knows what trials and tribulations are,'' New York
Assemblywoman Gloria Davis said of Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton touted the vice president's accomplishments, including
his tie-breaking vote on a 1993 budget bill she credited with
creating the good economy. ``It is critically important that we
have a friend in the White House in 2001,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Gore said he was ``proud'' to be appearing with Clinton, whom he
called ``a good friend, a principled leader, a fighter for working
families . . . a person who has made a difference and will make an
even larger difference in the years ahead.''
</P>
<P>
   But, mostly, Gore used the occasion to appeal to minority voters
with fiery rhetoric on his perception of the leading Republican
presidential contenders' views on race.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who would have us ease up and back off . . .
as they try to fool us, by saying, `Well, we've come so far, we're
there already.' They say, and I have heard them say with a straight
face, `We've created a colorblind society.' Where is that?'' he
asked, looking around the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some of these individuals just left the state of South
Carolina,'' Gore said to drowning applause. He then proceeded to
rip into Governor George W. Bush and Senator John McCain for
refusing to call for the removal of the Confederate flag flying
over the South Carolina Capitol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know there is something wrong with their ability to see,
because they look up at that state Capitol building in South
Carolina, and they saw the dome and they saw the flag pole, and
they looked and they looked and they looked some more, but they
didn't see a symbol of oppression and injustice,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Racism is deeper than a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   The Republican primary in South Carolina was also on Bill
Bradley's mind Sunday. Asked on ABC's ``This Week'' about the
opportunity created by McCain's loss, Bradley said, ``I think I'm
making a strong case to all Americans, independents and Democrats
and even some Republicans, to bring them over to our side, and
we're having some success,'' the Associated Press reported.
</P>
<P>
   As the spotlight focused on McCain in recent weeks, Bradley made
the case that McCain's ``presence in the race actually helps me,
because what it does is it focuses on reform.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley acknowledges the need to win some of the March 7
contests. He campaigned in northeastern states last week and will
debate Gore Monday night at the Apollo Theater in Harlem.

 NEWS ANALYSIS: BUSH BARKED, BUT VOTERS FELT ONLY McCAIN'S BITE  
(rk) 
 By PETER MARKS   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It was the attack ad that bit back.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Feb. 7, Sen. John McCain put a commercial on South
Carolina television unlike any he had run before. It was stark,
harsh and ominous. In it, an announcer posed a question intended to
evoke memories of past presidential transgressions and raise doubts
about Gov. George W. Bush's fitness for the nation's highest
office.
</P>
<P>
   To stunned members of the Bush team, the spot's parting shot _
``Do we really want another politician in the White House America
can't trust?'' _ seemed to come out of the blue. Although Bush had
run a tough new advertisement three days earlier, taking issue with
a tax-cut claim in a previous McCain commercial, the Bush staff was
taken aback by the blunt force and personal sting of McCain's
latest.
</P>
<P>
   But once the shock wore off, they realized the McCain camp may
have blundered by taking the gloves off.
</P>
<P>
   ``They responded that Monday, and they went nuclear,'' said an
aide to Bush who spoke on the condition of anonymity. ``That's when
they hit themselves with their own pitch.''
</P>
<P>
   In a sense, McCain's campaign never again found its footing in
South Carolina. Bush committed his share of what were considered by
some to be examples of questionable political judgment, like
delivering a major speech at Bob Jones University. But McCain's
decision to go on the attack on television _ reinforced by a
companion commercial in which he said that Bush's advertising
``twists the truth, like Clinton'' _ haunted him for days.
</P>
<P>
   Even after he renounced his own attack ads and vowed to run a
``positive campaign,'' the candidate seemed unable to let the issue
go, referring constantly in television interviews and appearances
to what he described as his opponent's incessant attacks on him.
And Bush did not let him forget it, either. He ran a series of
spots in response, in which he stared into the camera and talked
about how McCain's accusations had gone over the line.
</P>
<P>
   By primary day, the issue was sticking more to McCain than to
Bush. In surveys conducted on Saturday at South Carolina polling
places, more voters said McCain, not Bush, was the author of unfair
attacks, and nearly half said they thought McCain was capable of
political duplicity.
</P>
<P>
   One of the stranger aspects of how the advertising contest
played out was that McCain was far more often the subject of the
attacks than the attacker, especially on the radio and in other
arenas of political marketing. Special interest groups opposing
abortion and aligned with the tobacco industry kept a steady
drumbeat of anti-McCain noise on talk radio stations around the
state, and the senator and his surrogates complained bitterly of
other negative campaign tactics, like direct mailings and so-called
push-polling.
</P>
<P>
   In voters' minds, however, it was the image of McCain's
political trash-talking that remained vivid.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once you have gone negative,'' said Darrell West, a political
scientist at Brown University who studies political advertising,
``voters will remember that, and it colors their impressions of
your candidacy, particularly for someone like McCain, who had such
a reformer image, and how he said he wasn't just another
politician. The hypocrisy killed him.''
</P>
<P>
   Interviews with McCain's supporters last week in South Carolina
bore out West's observations. Many said they held a lower opinion
of the senator after he decided to run the advertisements.
</P>
<P>
   How personally McCain took the tenor of the advertising _ and
the voter backlash against him _ was apparent in his concession
speech, which that was something short of conciliatory. He called
the race a choice between ``my optimistic, welcoming conservatism
and the negative message of fear,'' between ``experience and
pretense.''
</P>
<P>
   In an appearance Sunday on ``Meet the Press,'' McCain refused to
entertain the suggestion of Tim Russert that likening Bush to
Clinton in a commercial had been a ``monumental mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's obvious that negative ads were the entire campaign in
South Carolina,'' McCain said. After withdrawing his attack ads, he
added, ``I asked Governor Bush to take his down. Well, he started
running negative ads in five states including this one. So much for
that plan.''
</P>
<P>
   Howard Opinsky, a McCain campaign spokesman, said Sunday from
Grand Rapids, Mich., that he was ``completely surprised'' by the
exit polls showing that South Carolina voters more often viewed
McCain as the aggressor on television. ``Essentially what you saw
in South Carolina was Bush using his financial advantage to totally
distort the picture of the race,'' Opinsky said. ``The exit polls
reflect that, that they were able to convince people that Bush was
more of a reformer.''
</P>
<P>
   But Ari Fleischer, a spokesman for Bush, said that McCain's
protestations after the primary were ``picture-perfect proof'' of
his nature. ``He's negative and dismisses anyone who engages in
normal, routine politics,'' Fleischer said. ``And yet he holds
himself above it all.''
</P>
<P>
   Opinsky, for his part, said the McCain campaign was determined
not to allow Bush to define McCain on television in Michigan as he
did in South Carolina. He also questioned the Bush campaign's
decision to repeat a spot in Michigan from South Carolina, in which
the governor refers to McCain's nasty remarks about him. Fleischer
replied, ``It's not like you can put a cone of silence around South
Carolina. People in other states saw and heard Senator McCain's
attacks.''
</P>
<P>
   Who gets the blame for the next skirmish may be moot. ``It
really doesn't matter who starts the fight, because the voters
aren't paying that close attention,'' West said. ``Like in
basketball, it's not the person who starts up who gets called for
the foul; it's the one the ref sees.''

MCCAIN LOOKS TO MICHIGAN AS PLACE TO GET BACK ON TRACK
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   LIVONIA, Mich. _ The fighter pilot is fighting back.
</P>
<P>
   After taking a shellacking in South Carolina, John McCain
arrived here Sunday, defiant and feisty, determined to take back
his mantle as the reformer in the Republican race for president.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you want the government back that's been stolen from you by
the special interests and the big-money people and a system that
George Bush wants to perpetuate, then you're going to vote for me
and you're going to get our vote out,'' he told a raucous crowd in
this Detroit suburb.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, subtly suggested that McCain might be suffering
from a bad case of the sour grapes. ``I guess you can judge a
leader by how they react to adversity,'' Bush said of the tougher
tone coming from his opponent. Later, at a news conference, Bush
said, ``All of us are going to have to react to our victories and
our defeats in our own way.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain disputed the inference, saying his hard words were
required to show Michigan voters the difference between the two
men.
</P>
<P>
   With polls suggesting a dead heat here, McCain was cognizant
that time is running out as he scrambled to make his points before
Tuesday's primary. Bush, on the other hand, seemed to revert to his
laid-back pre-New Hampshire ways. He did not hold his first event
of the day until 4 p.m. at Lawrence Technical University in
Detroit. Earlier, he attended church in Grand Rapids.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel great. I had a good night's sleep,'' Bush said. ``Last
night lifted my spirits, and my spirits are still high. We'll carry
Michigan. I feel confident about it. I know I have got a lot of
work to do.''
</P>
<P>
   On McCain's bus, and throughout a day of campaigning in East
Lansing, Grand Rapids, and Traverse City, the senator insisted that
he is the only reform candidate in the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Governor Bush is a reformer, I'm an astronaut,'' said
McCain, whose themes were appropriated by Bush in South Carolina
after McCain beat him badly in New Hampshire. He also said that
anyone who believes Bush is a reformer ``believes in the tooth
fairy.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain, a former Navy pilot and prisoner of war in Vietnam, in
the so-called Hanoi Hilton, acknowledged that Bush had knocked the
wind out of him Saturday, but he showed no signs of surrender.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took a punch Sunday, but we get up off the floor,'' McCain
said. ``I've gotten up off the floor. I've taken a few punches,
I've crashed a few airplanes. I've spent a couple years in a hotel
where there was no mint on the pillow.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bush has been borrowing lines from McCain, McCain echoed
Steve Forbes and Bob Dole Sunday as he took after the Texas
governor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Spending in the state of Texas went up 34 percent, while
spending by the Clinton administration went up 20 percent,'' he
said, a refrain often used by Forbes. ``That's not conservative and
that's not a reformer.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain's efforts to break the link between the special
interests, their big-money contributions, and the actions of
lawmakers also represent what the GOP should be, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in this fight for the heart and soul of the Republican
party and America,'' said McCain, whose friend, Dole, beat back
Patrick J. Buchanan in 1996 with those very words.
</P>
<P>
   McCain's appearances in Michigan were marked by the theme song
from ``Star Wars,'' appropriate for a man who often compares
himself to Luke Skywalker battling his way out of the Death Star.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to presenting his reform credentials, McCain went
after Bush repeatedly. He cited a bill to reform HMOs in Texas that
Bush vetoed but has been taking credit for on the campaign trail.
</P>
<P>
   McCain pointed out that Bush never proposed a plan to overhaul
the campaign-finance system in his 5 years as governor. He called
Bush's recent campaign finance proposal ``a joke and a fraud.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless Governor Bush can identify one spending cut, one
corporate welfare loophole he would close, he cannot call himself a
reformer,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   He also assailed Bush for spending the federal budget surplus
entirely on tax cuts and to the benefit of the wealthiest 1 percent
of all Americans. ``There's no new money for Social Security,
Medicare, or paying down the debt,'' McCain said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain said he would take 62 percent of the surplus and put it
in the Social Security trust fund, which is $5 trillion to $7
trillion underfunded.
</P>
<P>
   Also Sunday, McCain received the endorsement of US
Representative Peter T. King, a New York Republican who had been
backing Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Bush, however, appeared untroubled by King's decision. ``He
must've gotten his newspaper late this morning,'' Bush joked.
</P>
<P>
   But he grew defensive when asked about King's claim that Bush
had offended Catholics by speaking at Bob Jones University in South
Carolina, a conservative Christian school that critics say promotes
segregation and holds anti-Catholic views.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's got a right to do what they think they need to
do,'' Bush said of King. ``I don't think Peter King's endorsement
is going to give it much of a boost in Michigan.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush also took issue with a radio ad released by Geoffrey
Feiger, the attorney best known for representing assisted-suicide
advocate Dr. Jack Kevorkian. In the ad, Feiger says: ``Supporting
Republican tort reform is dumb. Now Engler wants you to support
George W. Bush. That's dumber.'' Feiger was referring to Michigan
Governor John Engler, a Republican.
</P>
<P>
   Bush seemed delighted by the opportunity the ad provided. He
told a crowd at Lawrence Technological University about Feiger's
ad, as well as about reports that Feiger would vote for McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing we can do about that except this: We can rally
our friends and neighbors, rally our kind of folk, to go to the
polls and say to Dr. Kevorkian's lawyer, `You're not going to pick
who the nominee of the Republican party is.' ''

<P>
   MOSCOW _ Anatoly A. Sobchak, the former mayor of St. Petersburg
and democratic reformer who gave Acting President Vladimir V. Putin
his start in public life, died of a heart attack Sunday morning,
officials said. He was 62.
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak, who underwent treatment for heart problems for several
years, died while in Kaliningrad, Russia's Baltic Sea enclave,
where he had been sent as a personal representative of Putin.
</P>
<P>
   A television report Sunday evening said Putin, who had been
Sobchak's student in law school and his deputy mayor in St.
Petersburg, had sent a special plane to Kaliningrad to bring the
former mayor's body back to St. Petersburg for burial.
</P>
<P>
   Sobchak emerged as a leading member of Russia's democratic
movement in the late 1980s, together with Boris N. Yeltsin, who
became Russia's first elected president in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   In that same year Sobchak became the first elected mayor of
Leningrad, Russia's second-largest city. After the collapse of a
Communist-backed coup that summer, Sobchak renamed his native city
St. Petersburg, the name it bore when it was Russia's imperial
capital.
</P>
<P>
   With his legal knowledge and lucid, eloquent speeches, Sobchak
was one of the best-known spokesmen for the democratic movement, at
home and abroad.
</P>
<P>
   After Yeltsin's violent showdown with his opponents in
Parliament in October 1993, Sobchak was called on to help draft a
new constitution, which provided Yeltsin with the system of strong
presidential power that Putin has now inherited.
</P>
<P>
   In a condolence message to Sobchak's wife, Lyudmila Narusova,
and their daughter, Ksenya, Yeltsin praised the former mayor as
`'an extraordinary personality, a highly educated person who firmly
upheld his positions.''
</P>
<P>
   `'His special service was his participation in the work on the
constitution that laid the foundation of Russia's new statehood,''
Yeltsin said.
</P>
<P>
   As mayor of St. Petersburg, Sobchak traveled abroad extensively,
promoting his city as a future financial capital of Russia and
drumming up sponsors to save its graceful palaces and cultural
legacy from further decay and collapse.
</P>
<P>
   But while Moscow, St. Petersburg's historic rival, thrived
during the early years of Russia's economic transformation, with
new high-rises clogging its skyline and luxury shops and
restaurants opening in its downtown streets, St. Petersburg lagged
behind, looking ever more bedraggled and forlorn.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996 the city's voters turned in their verdict on Sobchak's
term as mayor and voted him out of office, electing his archrival
and former deputy, Vladimir Yakovlev, in his place.
</P>
<P>
   In that period Sobchak came under heavy attack in the press and
by investigators, mainly on charges that he arranged for friends
and relatives to acquired city-owned apartments on preferential
terms.
</P>
<P>
   Although the charges were relatively minor compared with the
compromising material that has since surfaced against other Russian
public figures, they tarnished not only Sobchak's reputation, but
also that of the democratic movement generally.
</P>
<P>
   In November 1997, Sobcak left Russia for Paris after falling ill
while being questioned by federal prosecutors. His wife, then a
member of Parliament, said he had left the country to seek adequate
medical treatment. He spent a year and a half in voluntary exile in
France, returning to Russia only last summer, a month before Putin
was appointed prime minister.
</P>
<P>
   Greeted by more than 100 journalists at the St. Petersburg
airport, the former mayor, as exuberant as ever, said he would
never go away again. `'You don't need to rush,'' he said, ``because
I have returned forever. I have arrived in my city, and I am happy
to be home.''
</P>
<P>
   By late last year the criminal charges against him were dropped,
and Sobchak appeared ready for a return to national politics,
helped by his former protege and law student, Putin. But the former
mayor and his wife lost separate bids for parliament in elections
last December, and he instead accepted a position as legal adviser
to the Kremlin.
</P>
<P>
   In eulogies broadcast Sunday night on Russian television,
several leading Russian political figures, including former Prime
Minister Sergei V. Stepashin and Anatoly B. Chubais, author of
Russia's privatization program, both natives of St. Petersburg,
said the corruption charges had taken their toll on Sobchak and
weakened his health.
</P>
<P>
   Both pointedly mentioned his accusers by name, including a
former national prosecutor general, Yuri I. Skuratov.
</P>
<P>
   `'Sobchak was unlike most politicians,'' Stepashin said. `'Most
politicians sometimes choose to remain quiet, or to pretend.
Sobchak said what he thought. `'
</P>
<P>
   His supporters said Sobchak had keenly felt the betrayal of many
of his old allies, which made him all the more grateful for the
loyalty of others _ like Putin, who stood by the former mayor after
his defeat in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The two men had first met at Leningrad State University in the
1970s, where Sobchak, a law professor, taught Putin in a course on
economic law as the younger man prepared himself for a career in
the KGB, the Soviet state security agency.
</P>
<P>
   They became better acquainted in the late 1980s, when Putin,
returning from a KGB tour in East Germany, took a top
administrative job at the university. He was later recommended to
the city's new mayor, who chose him to run his international
affairs office.

ONCE AGAIN, CONSERVATIVES CARRIED DAY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)

 c.2000 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ While South Carolina voters were busy
repudiating Senator John McCain's summons to a new direction for
the Republican Party, they also knocked down the notion that
politics have changed in this growing state.
</P>
<P>
   Although the Arizona senator thought he saw an opening among the
half million new residents who arrived in the state during the past
decade, he was overrun Saturday by a surge of Christian
conservatives and old-line Republicans who threw their support to
Texas Governor George W. Bush.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a conservative state,'' said Henry McMaster, chairman
of the Republican Party of South Carolina. ``We are conservative
fiscally, we are conservative socially, we are conservative
whatever else there is.''
</P>
<P>
   South Carolinians turned out in record numbers, lured by Bush's
siren song of ``limited government and lowered taxes'' and a
God-and-country approach highlighted by Bush's appearance at
fundamentalist Bob Jones University in Greenville.
</P>
<P>
   The Texan was also aided enormously by a veteran Republican
organization led by Carroll Campbell, a former South Carolina
governor. It is the same GOP network that gave Bush's father a
critical victory in the 1988 South Carolina primary and helped Bob
Dole turn back a threat from Patrick Buchanan in 1996, shortly
after Buchanan won the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   During McCain's successful campaign in New Hampshire, his
strategists looked ahead to South Carolina and saw a chance to
break the old regime. They believed Campbell's organization had
atrophied after a candidate it was supporting, Governor David
Beasley, lost a bid for reelection 15 months ago, and they felt
McCain would be a natural favorite among new, independent-minded
voters in the Myrtle Beach and Greenville-Spartanburg regions.
</P>
<P>
   As the crowds seemed to grow with each successive rally in South
Carolina last week, one of McCain's chief advisers predicted that
as many as 400,000 voters might turn out in the primary. If that
threshold were crossed, he said, McCain would win.
</P>
<P>
   Never had more than 276,000 voted in a South Carolina
presidential primary. On Saturday, however, more than 560,000 South
Carolinians cast votes. McCain took 238,000, a number his aides
thought would easily be enough to win. But regular Republicans,
apparently concerned that their primary would be violated by an
influx of nonparty voters, rushed to the polls for Bush.
</P>
<P>
   Exit polls conducted by a consortium of news organizations found
that Christian conservatives accounted for one-third of the total
vote, and they supported Bush by a 2-1 margin.
</P>
<P>
   The religious right has long been an important element in
Republican politics in this state, which is top-heavy with Southern
Baptists and other evangelical faiths.
</P>
<P>
   After Bush used a nationally televised debate last Tuesday to
point to a feud between the Christian Coalition and Warren Rudman,
a former New Hampshire senator who supports McCain, the
conservative grapevine buzzed the rest of the week with word that
Rudman had called the organization ``bigoted'' because the group
criticized General Colin Powell.
</P>
<P>
   An 11th-hour endorsement of McCain by Gary Bauer, a leading
Christian conservative who dropped out of the presidential race,
proved to have little impact.
</P>
<P>
   ``George W. Bush's message resonated among the religious
conservatives,'' said Randy Tate, director of Republican affairs
for Voter.com and a former Christian Coalition official.
</P>
<P>
   ``They approved of the moral tenor of his campaign. They are
concerned about issues of integrity, particularly as we move out of
the Clinton area,'' he said. ``And they know the next president may
pick three Supreme Court judges, which could lead to the overthrow
of Roe v. Wade.''
</P>
<P>
   Tate said Bush also succeeded, in large measure, in ``winning
over the old Reagan Democrats who were the only hope for McCain.''
</P>
<P>
   During the past two weeks, McCain talked repeatedly of
attracting thousands of independents and ``Reagan Democrats'' in
South Carolina, forces that would become part of a new Republican
coalition he would lead. But in a state with no party registration,
most of the Reagan Democrats have considered themselves Republicans
since Ronald Reagan converted them in the 1980 primary, and they
appeared to march lock-step with traditional Republicans in support
of Bush.
</P>
<P>
   When the results were complete late Saturday, it was apparent
that McCain succeeded in attracting unprecedented numbers of
independent and Democratic voters for a Republican presidential
candidate. But it was not nearly enough. Bush won 70 percent of the
votes among those who identified themselves as Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a 40-point deficit among Republicans'' for McCain, said
Whit Ayres, a Republican pollster who specializes in Southern
campaigns. ``You can't win a Republican nomination with those
numbers.
</P>
<P>
   ``If John McCain is going to succeed elsewhere, he's got to
energize independents and do far better among registered
Republicans,'' he said.

SMILE _ ATM KNOWS YOUR FACE  &HT;     BY BENNY EVANGELISTA
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
Throughout the history of civilization, the human face has remained
the easiest method for people to identify one another.
<P>
   Now, a San Francisco company believes it is poised to cash in on
new technology that allows computers to recognize faces and,
eventually, store gigabytes worth of information about that person.
</P>
<P>
   InnoVentry Corp., a joint venture between Wells Fargo Bank and
U.S. pawnshop king Cash America International Inc., is marketing an
ATM that uses face-recognition technology to identify its
customers.
</P>
<P>
   About 180 of the ATMs, called RPM, are already in convenience
and grocery stores in Texas and Arizona. An additional 300 machines
in a version called ATREVA are in gambling casinos in Nevada.
</P>
<P>
   The company expects to have an additional 1,500 installed by the
end of 2000. It signed a deal last week to put the ATMs in
billionaire Donald Trump's casinos in Atlantic City, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   InnoVentry is one of the biggest examples of how cutting-edge
biometric technology is entering the consumer world. As companies
scramble for ways to tighten their security measures against
hackers, what better, more secure form of identification is there
than the human face, asks InnoVentry CEO Frank A. Petro.
</P>
<P>
   InnoVentry uses a program called FaceIt, developed by Joseph
Atick, CEO of Visionics Corp. of New Jersey. While he was head of
Princeton University's Neural Cybernetics Group and later the
Computational Neuroscience Laboratory at Rockefeller University in
New York, Atick began studying how mathematical algorithms could be
used to tell one person's face from another.
</P>
<P>
   The program determines a face print by quickly computing the
measurements between 60 possible facial landmarks, such as the
center of the eyes, the bridge of the nose or the protrusions of
the jaw or cheekbones. The distances between only 14 of those
``nodal points'' can determine a face print that won't change even
if you grow a beard or wear glasses, Atick said.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to do a lot more than a nose job to get your relative
distances altered,'' Atick said.
</P>
<P>
   The same technology is now used by the Israeli government to
monitor 50,000 Palestinian day laborers who cross from Gaza to
Israel each day. It was also used with a closed-circuit TV system
to identify wanted criminals in the London borough of Newham and
credited with helping reduce crime by about 70 percent.
</P>
<P>
   InnoVentry markets an ATM primarily aimed at the estimated 65
million Americans who want to cash checks but either don't have a
bank account or maintain low balances in their checking account.
Customers sign up by registering their faces and Social Security
number with InnoVentry, but need only show their face for
subsequent visits.
</P>
<P>
   The company, founded in 1998, has enrolled more than 350,000
customers and cashed 1.3 million checks with a loss rate that is
``well below 1 percent,'' Petro said.
</P>
<P>
   The ATMs will soon dispense money orders and online bill-paying
services, and Petro believes the machines will help Internet-based
banks lure future customers. InnoVentry expects to roll out about
25,000 machines in the United States in the next four years, and
unlike most biometric companies, it expects to start making a
profit in 2001.
</P>
<P>
   InnoVentry also plans to use face recognition for a broader
range of services, such as allowing credit card advances. For
example, the company is testing a system that will recognize a
customer pumping gas, know what products that customer has bought
in the past and display targeted ads on a nearby monitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``Biometrics has the ability to create a more intimate
relationship with your customers,'' Petro said.
</P>
<P>
   Later this year in Phoenix, the company plans to test a system
in which customers can order and pay for groceries online at work
and pick them up on the way home, using only their face to identify
themselves.
</P>
<P>
   While the technology seems to reflect some of the themes in
George Orwell's classic novel ``1984,'' about a totalitarian
society filled with all-seeing view screens, Petro said his ATMs
still give the customer control.
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't have to use this, this is not Big Brother forcing
you to do this,'' Petro said. ``We're trying to engineer something
here to create better value for the consumer.''

`SMART GUN' MAY BE A MUCH SAFER ONE  &HT;     BY DAVID LAZARUS
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
John Stiver was given a handgun for his services about 10 years ago
after doing some computer consulting for a firearms publication. He
had never owned a gun before. He had three children at home.
<P>
   ``We ended up locking it up,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   But gradually, he got to wondering if there wasn't a better
solution, some way that the gun could be made secure to prevent
accidents in the home while still being accessible in case of
trouble.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Stiver is president of Advanced Biometrics, a Puyallup,
Wash., company that is among a number of outfits working to come up
with technology for a ``smart gun'' _ a weapon that can recognize
and function only for authorized users.
</P>
<P>
   Such weapons are for the most part still on the drawing board,
although prototypes are being developed by leading firearms
manufacturers. A new generation of smart guns, advocates say, will
significantly reduce firearms-related accidents in the home and
prevent stolen weapons from being used in other crimes.
</P>
<P>
   President Clinton is among the more enthusiastic supporters of
smart-gun technology. He has called for providing some $10 million
in federal funds to firearms manufacturers so they can push ahead
with development of authorized-user-only weapons.
</P>
<P>
   In Advanced Biometrics' case, the solution lies in employing a
beam of light to scan the user's entire hand, both above and below
the skin.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is much better than using fingerprints,'' insisted
Stiver. ``It's easy to duplicate a fingerprint. I can make one that
identifies me as you with 35 cents' worth of latex.''
</P>
<P>
   However, Advanced Biometrics is nowhere close to making its
technology compact enough to fit into the handle of a pistol _ the
ultimate goal of all smart-gun endeavors. And while Stiver said his
company could have a rifle-size version operational in about six
weeks, he estimated this would take about $80,000 in new
research-and-development funding.
</P>
<P>
   In New Hampshire, a company called Applied Biometrics says it
has scored a breakthrough in smart-gun research by shrinking its
fingerprint-identification technology to the point where it and a
pair of AAA batteries can be inserted into a pistol handle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's real,'' said John Catalano, the firm's chief executive.
``Ready for prime time today.''
</P>
<P>
   Sort of. While Applied's technology was incorporated in a
high-security version of the PalmPilot last month, it has yet to be
tested in a prototype weapon.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Foley, vice president of product engineering at Smith &AMP;
Wesson, the country's largest handgun manufacturer, said Applied's
technology is still too costly and too fragile for use in actual
guns.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he said his company is leaning toward a rival
fingerprint-ID system created by Mytec Technologies in Toronto.
This one is contained in a separate module that attaches to the
handle of a newly developed pistol with an electronic firing
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
   Upon pressing a finger to the module, an authorized user would
detach the gun and be ready to fire. ``It can be done relatively
quickly,'' said Dennis Hollingshead, Mytec's CEO. If the gun is
released, it instantly locks back up again.
</P>
<P>
   Smith &AMP; Wesson's Foley said he expects the first smart guns to
reach the market in about two years. Smarter guns with handle-based
security systems would follow several years later.
</P>
<P>
   But first, Foley said uniform standards should be set for
user-ID I.D.  &LR; technology and procedures, and legislators will have
to address the question of exempting the technology's developer
from product-liability issues in the event of shooting accidents.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's an awful lot of testing and an awful lot of proving
that still has to occur,'' he said. ``But if people want to make
this happen, we can make it happen.''
</P>
<P>
   For its part, the National Rifle Association is wary of any
firearm-related measure backed by the government.
</P>
<P>
   ``We welcome the development of new technology,'' said Jim
Marown, a spokesman for the organization. ``We welcome its
introduction to the market, but only as long as it's not government
mandated.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the NRA believes that gun owners should be free to
choose the security they use for firearms in the home and that
``the key to preventing accidents is education and training.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You cannot make a smart gun,'' Marown said. ``You can only
make smart gun use.''

LET YOUR FINGERS DO THE DRIVING  &HT;     BY TODD WALLACK AND CARRIE KIRBY
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
The trouble with car keys is it's easy to lose them. Or leave them
in the ignition, letting a thief simply drive away.
<P>
   But several automakers are building prototypes that don't use
keys to start a car at all, instead scanning drivers' fingers or
thumbs. DaimlerChrysler showed off a thumb-reader, for instance, in
a ``concept car,'' introduced last month at the Detroit Auto Show.
And General Motors plans to incorporate the technology in a
Cadillac prototype during the first half of this year.
</P>
<P>
   Because fingerprints are considered unique (and hard to lose),
proponents say the technology could be enormously popular as a
replacement for car keys.
</P>
<P>
   It could also let cars recognize the driver, and adjust
everything from the car seat pitch to the radio station. ``It's
very convenient,'' said Won Lee of Secugen, a San Jose biometrics
company that makes fingerprint readers. Secugen is working with
several automakers, though it says the technology won't appear on
car lots for at least two years.
</P>
<P>
   And DaimlerChrysler spokesman Sjoerd Dijkstra said the
technology still has plenty of kinks. For one, he said, fingerprint
readers are too delicate to expose to sun, sleet and other harsh
conditions on the outside of the car, so drivers probably would
still need to carry a key or remote control to open the door.
</P>
<P>
   And Dijkstra said it's still too cumbersome to turn the car over
to a valet or mechanic. Though drivers can program the car to
recognize additional fingerprints, the current driver must be
sitting in the car with the new one and go through several steps.
That's fine for a spouse or kids, Dijkstra said, but too slow when
simply dropping the car off at a parking lot. And the problem is
even worse when turning the car over to an auto shop for repairs if
the mechanic who will be working on the car isn't available when
the car is dropped off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of questions that are still unanswered,'' said
Dijkstra. ``It's more of a gizmo right now than a real feature.''
</P>
<P>
   One of the main arguments for using fingerprint or handprint
readers in cars is to prevent auto theft, experts say. Thousands of
cars are stolen each year because someone left the keys in the
ignition. And BMW engineers say some thieves have even broken into
homes to steal keys, because some cars are difficult to break into.
</P>
<P>
   But if your finger becomes your password, might thieves also be
willing to cut one off to steal a car?
</P>
<P>
   ``That's definitely one of the issues that has to be taken into
account,'' said BMW engineer Byron Shaw. He said some researchers
claim the technology can ``distinguish a live finger from a dead
one,'' but said there is no definitive proof. And even if a car
could tell the difference, Shaw added, it wouldn't do the driver
much good if the thief didn't know that.
</P>
<P>
   Thieves also have a track record of hot wiring cars and finding
other ways around security devices. Many thieves, for instance,
have learned to foil the popular Club _ a bar that locks the
steering wheel in place _ by pouring a few drops of liquid nitrogen
on the device and cracking it, or simply sawing the steering wheel
off and using a screwdriver to steer the car.
</P>
<P>
   ``It doesn't take rocket science'' to defeat these devices, said
Jean O'Neil, research director for the National Crime Prevention
Council.
</P>
<P>
   But O'Neil said scanners could be a strong deterrent if combined
with other technologies _ like a ``kill switch'' that wouldn't
supply any gasoline to an engine unless the scanner gives the green
light. Though thieves often try to find ways around the devices,
eventually, she said, ``they run out of time.''
</P>
<P>
   Biometrics technology has other possible car-related uses, such
as sensing the driver's condition to find out if the person appears
drunk.

BRADLEY GOING ALL OUT IN WASHINGTON STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Washington's Feb. 29 Democratic presidential primary, a beauty
contest in which no national convention delegates are chosen, has
nonetheless assumed a do-or-die importance to the insurgent
campaign of former New Jersey Sen. Bill Bradley.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to be here practically every day until the
primary,'' Bradley said in an interview before leaving Seattle for
New York. He will debate Vice President Al Gore Monday night at
Harlem's historic Apollo Theatre.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican contest between Texas Gov. George Bush and
Arizona Sen. John McCain has dominated news since the New Hampshire
primary. It has choked off media coverage of the Democratic contest
in which Bradley needs to gain traction against Gore.
</P>
<P>
   Washington represents the first Gore-Bradley face-off since New
Hampshire, aside from a meaningless primary in Delaware that drew
few voters. It is also the Democrats' only showdown before critical
primaries in New York, California and other states.
</P>
<P>
   ``Washington is very important,'' Bradley said Saturday. ``It
comes a week before March 7. It is an opportunity for us to
demonstrate movement ... Washington state is also a place where I
am extremely comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   The danger for a momentum-building Bradley showing has not been
lost to the Gore campaign. It has staffed the Washington effort
with veterans of the vice president's successful campaign in the
Jan. 24 Iowa caucuses. Tipper Gore will campaign in the state
Monday, speaking to a Democratic crab feed in Olympia Monday night,
and the vice president will appear at a dinner party Saturday night
in Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   Gore backers have also counterpunched at every Bradley
appearance. Sen. Patty Murray, D-Wash., countered one Bradley visit
with a hastily called news conference at which she defended the
vice president's record on womens issues and reproductive rights.
Last week, Reps. Norm Dicks and Jay Inslee, D-Wash., along with
Sierra Club Northwest representative Bill Arthur praised Gore's
environmental achievements.
</P>
<P>
   But hopes have not dimmed in the Bradley camp. Seattle Mayor
Paul Schell, who backs Bradley, said a win in the state could
``bring about another shift in momentum in a year already full of
surprises.'' Schell and Oregon Gov. John Kitzhaber campaigned with
Bradley on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley trailed Gore by a margin of 64-26 in a CNN-USA Today
poll taken last week by Gallup. After Tuesday's GOP contests in
Michigan and Arizona, however, ``the attention will focus back on
this (Democratic) race,'' Bradley argued.
</P>
<P>
   ``People say they know the vice president better than me,'' he
added. ``I'm pretty easy to know. I've always been pro-choice. I
look at Al Gore when he was in the House and he voted 84 percent
pro-life. He was viewed as a poster boy for the National Rifle
Association, now he supports limited gun control ... You have to be
an archeologist digging to know where he has been on issues.''
</P>
<P>
   Although citizens will go to the polls a week earlier, Democrats
will use the March 7 precinct caucuses as a basis for picking their
delegation to this summer's national convention in Los Angeles. The
Democratic National Committee refused to recognize any presidential
delegate selection prior to March 1, except for the Iowa caucuses
and the New Hampshire primary.
</P>
<P>
   But Washington has a tradition of being rough on front-runners,
and giving its heart to at least one reformer in every presidential
election cycle.
</P>
<P>
   Thousands of independents and Democrats invaded the 1980 GOP
caucuses to give a strong showing to liberal Republican Rep. John
Anderson. Colorado Sen. Gary Hart upset eventual Democratic nominee
Walter Mondale in the 1984 caucuses. In 1992, former Sen. Paul
Tsongas easily outdistanced Bill Clinton, who also ran behind
former California Gov. Jerry Brown.
</P>
<P>
   Numerous surveys have shown that, among Washington voters,
self-described independents now outnumber both Republicans and
Democrats. Next week, voters will be free to choose which party's
primary in which to cast ballots.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley is facing stiff competition for independent and
reform-minded voters. McCain needs a victory in the Republican
primary to recover momentum from Saturday's loss in South Carolina.
An Elway Poll, taken earlier this month, showed the Arizona senator
heavily supported by independents. Republicans will use their
party's primary to determine one-third of the delegation to the GOP
National Convention in Philadelphia.
</P>
<P>
   Both Bradley and McCain have made campaign finance reform a
centerpiece of their campaigns for the presidency. But, in
Bradley's view, the Democratic and Republican insurgents have
``significant differences'' on numerous other issues.
</P>
<P>
   ``I am pro-choice (on abortion), he is not,'' Bradley said. ``I
am for common sense gun control, he is opposed. I have proposed a
comprehensive health care program aimed at gaining coverage for
every American, he has not.''
</P>
<P>
   McCain has argued that he opposes abortion except in cases of
rape, incest and threat to the life of the mother. He has spoken of
the need for background checks on gun buyers, but opposes Bradley's
call for registration of all handguns.
</P>
<P>
   McCain plans a barnstorming tour across Washington on Wednesday.
He will speak at a morning rally at Gonzaga University, deliver a
noon speech in Seattle and later travel by boat to Bremerton for a
rally.
</P>
<P>
   In their calls for political reform, both Bradley and McCain
will likely find fertile ground in Washington. The state's voters
enacted a pioneering public disclosure law in 1972. Two decades
later, they voted to limit individual contributions to candidates
for state office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think, for a lot of people nationally, our political life is
like a broken thermostat: You turn it and it doesn't work,''
Bradley said. ``Money determines the outcome on issues. Big things
can't be done ... Politics is being seen by the public as an
exercise in the mechanics of winning _ fund raising, media and
polling _ rather than something that can improve their lives.''
</P>
<P>
   Bradley faulted President Clinton and Vice President Gore for
failing to act on political reform in 1993 and 1994, when Democrats
held the White House and both houses of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Bradley said he went to Clinton in 1993. ``I told him, `You
ought to do campaign finance reform first because it is the key to
doing everything else,''' said the former New York Knicks forward.
But he said the White House preferred to play an inside game.

DIGITAL PASSWORD IS FOR YOUR EYES ONLY  &HT;     BY KELLY ZITO
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
If the eyes are a window to the soul, the iris could be the window
to a keyless, cardless, password-less world.
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from DNA, the iris _ or colored ring that surrounds the
pupil _ is considered among the most distinctive human
characteristics, and therefore, among the best ways to definitively
identify a person _ better even than fingerprints, voice or face
(even though developers of each technology say theirs is best).
</P>
<P>
   The problem is iris scanning, as it's called, is also among the
most expensive _ about $800 for a hair dryer-size consumer
identification device for a PC (not to mention the special cards it
requires) versus about $100 for a much smaller fingerprint system.
</P>
<P>
   As with most technologies, the price of iris scanning will
decline as the hardware and software becomes &LR;  cheaper and more
companies jump into the development ring _ but that will happen for
other biometrics as well. And iris technology, which analyzes about
266 data points in the iris, will always remain more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   For those and other reasons, consumers probably won't find iris
technology popping up in everyday devices anytime soon.
</P>
<P>
   Raj Nanavati, a partner at International Biometric Group, a New
York biometric consulting firm, says iris recognition works well in
ATMs and facilities where management is trying to control access to
a building.
</P>
<P>
   On the consumer side it's fuzzier.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the consumer market, fingerprint (recognition) is more
appropriate because it's much smaller and cheaper to use,'' he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Iris technology works like this: Instead of sliding a card
through a reader in the foyer of an office to gain access, a user
stands about two feet in front of a special camera.
</P>
<P>
   The camera zooms in on the eye, records an image of the iris and
converts it to a digital file similar to a bar code. If the code
matches the existing one on file, the worker proceeds inside. If
they don't match, it's time to call upstairs. Though there's some
debate as to the necessity of an exact match, IriScan, the leading
iris technology company, says the probability that two irises will
create the same digital code are 1 in 10 followed by 78 zeros.
</P>
<P>
   So far, banks, prisons, public assistance programs and even
e-commerce companies have invested in the technology.
</P>
<P>
   One of the highest-profile users is Bank United in Houston, &LR; 
Texas &LR; .
</P>
<P>
   Last year, the 12-year-old bank installed iris scanning
components in three prototype automated teller machines.
</P>
<P>
   In the nine months the iris-ATMs have been in place, the bank
has gotten mostly positive feedback, it says, with a few complaints
that the technology doesn't work with certain mirrored sunglasses.
Most consumers like the fact that they can ditch one of the cards
in their bursting wallets and commit one less PIN number to memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``The preliminary results have been favorable on all accounts _
customer acceptance, usage and an image of the institution being
forward-thinking,'' said Bank United spokesman Vern Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the results after a year, the bank will decide this
summer whether to spend about $5,000 a pop to retrofit more of its
ATMs with the technology.
</P>
<P>
   Banks have a vested interest in driving customers to ATMs _
they're more accurate and cheaper to maintain than humans. But
industries outside the financial realm also are testing the
usefulness of iris recognition.
</P>
<P>
   The Sarasota County Sheriff's Office in Florida says it thwarted
two inmate escape attempts in the first year it used iris scanning
at its detention center. There, the system verifies the identity of
all inmates who leave the facility _ for court appearances, work
assignments and at the end of the term.
</P>
<P>
   A company in Virginia is hoping to help cities speed up commutes
by developing an automated fare collection system that uses iris
technology. The system would allow commuters onto train or subway
platforms after they've been identified by their transit accounts.
</P>
<P>
   Biometrics experts say iris recognition _ not to be confused
with retinal scanning, which requires an examination of the inner
part of the eye _ is accurate because of the complex nature of the
connective tissue of the iris.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you compare it to face, where you can grow a beard, or
voice, which is a hybrid between physical and behavioral
characteristics, iris scanning is a more robust technology,'' said
Nanavati.
</P>
<P>
   And unlike fingerprints, irises generally don't don't &LR;  generally
 &LR; change over time, unless the person develops cataracts or suffers
some trauma. Fingerprints, on the other hand, can be marred by
scars or abrasions over time. There's also a certain criminal
stigma attached to fingerprints, as well as concern about the
cleanliness of pressing a pad used by hundreds or thousands of
others.
</P>
<P>
   A 1998 study by Gartner Group, a Massachusetts research firm,
said iris recognition will overtake fingerprints by 2002 as the
preferred biometric for installations serving many users.
</P>
<P>
   But iris scanning, like all biometrics, faces a major roadblock
in gaining acceptance _ worries about privacy. Because these
technologies are so accurate, many believe consumer rights will be
sacrificed in the name of preventing fraud and increasing
productivity.
</P>
<P>
   Not surprisingly IriScan thinks the technology will overcome
those hurdles and eventually become as ubiquitous as cell phones.
</P>
<P>
   John Siedlarz, the Marlton, N.J., company's president and chief
executive, believes a couple of in-development technologies will
change the way we interact with our cars, homes, banks and
employers.
</P>
<P>
   IriScan is currently working on the Iris Key, a handheld device
equipped with a camera that authenticates a customer's ID and is
then pointed at the front door of a house, car or boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``The paradigm shift is so rapid today,'' he said. ``A few years
ago people saw the Palm Pilot and said, `This is a toy.' Now it's
indispensable.''

<P>
   &UR; BY KELLY ZITO &LR;
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle &QC;  &LR; 
If the eyes are a window to the soul, the iris could be the window
to a keyless, cardless, password-less world.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from DNA, the iris _ or colored ring that surrounds the
pupil _ is considered among the most distinctive human
characteristics, and therefore, among the best ways to definitively
identify a person _ better even than fingerprints, voice or face
(even though developers of each technology say theirs is best).
</P>
<P>
   The problem is iris scanning, as it's called, is also among the
most expensive _ about $800 for a hair dryer-size consumer
identification device for a PC (not to mention the special cards it
requires) versus about $100 for a much smaller fingerprint system.
</P>
<P>
   As with most technologies, the price of iris scanning will
decline as the hardware and software becomes &LR;  cheaper and more
companies jump into the development ring _ but that will happen for
other biometrics as well. And iris technology, which analyzes about
266 data points in the iris, will always remain more complicated.
</P>
<P>
   For those and other reasons, consumers probably won't find iris
technology popping up in everyday devices anytime soon.

 By GUSTAV NIEBUHR    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   COLUMBIA, S.C. _ The Rev. Allen Phillips said Sunday that when
members of his evangelical church in North Spartanburg voted for
Gov. George W. Bush in the South Carolina primary, it was a matter
of spiritual affinity rather than an organized effort by the
Christian right.
</P>
<P>
   ``Conservative evangelical Christians identified with Gov.
Bush,'' said Phillips, an associate pastor at First Baptist Church
of North Spartanburg and a member of the Ethics and Religious
Liberties Commission of the Southern Baptist Convention. ``He has
the experience of knowing Jesus Christ as his savior.''
</P>
<P>
   For years, the demise of organized religious conservatives has
been declared. And while the effort by groups like the Christian
Coalition seemed decidedly tame here compared with previous years,
conservative Christians probably played a decisive role in Bush's
victory over Sen. John McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the reason for their support seemed to be the way Bush
connected with them.
</P>
<P>
   He appears to have benefited from his familiarity with the
religious vocabulary that resonates with evangelical Protestants, a
large group in this state. Bush, a United Methodist, has spoken
publicly about having undergone a conversion experience.
</P>
<P>
   Allen said the leadership of his church asked people to vote but
made no endorsements and mounted no effort to get people to the
polls.
</P>
<P>
   At Shandon Baptist Church, a congregation in Columbia, Mike
McGee, a member, said that what Bush had said about Christ changing
his life was ``a defining moment and a clarifying moment'' in the
campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McGee, an administrator at the University of South Carolina,
said he did not believe that evangelicals voted for Bush only on
that basis.
</P>
<P>
   Still, McGee and the church's pastor, the Rev. Dick Lincoln,
said Bush's religious statements helped evangelicals feel more
comfortable with him.
</P>
<P>
   Bush also tried to get that message across in writing. Among his
mass mailings was a brochure that described him as a ``proven
conservative leader to defend family and life,'' and included a
letter in which Bush spoke of having long known the Rev. Billy
Graham. Bush wrote that he felt freed by his beliefs ``to do the
right thing, no matter what the polls or public opinion say.''
</P>
<P>
   In an interview shortly before the primary, James L. Guth, a
professor of political science at Furman University, said Southern
Baptists (and other conservative Christians, like members of the
small but growing Presbyterian Church in America), liked Bush
because he was willing to speak of his religious experience.
</P>
<P>
   Some in South Carolina say the Bush campaign tried not only to
appeal to religious conservatives but to sow them with doubts about
McCain, particularly over his stand on abortion.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain was so defined in negative terms by the Christian
right,'' said Cyndi Mosteller, vice chairman of the Charleston
County Republican Party and a McCain supporter. ``I had dear
Christian people calling me, saying, `Cyndi, is it OK to vote for
McCain? Is it OK?'''
</P>
<P>
   Among evangelicals in South Carolina, Southern Baptists number
nearly 750,000, the state's single largest religious group.
Scattered among more than 1,900 autonomous churches, they are far
from monolithic and do not vote as a bloc. But they tend to be
conservative, theologically and politically.
</P>
<P>
   Furthermore, they have a history of backing members of the Bush
family.
</P>
<P>
   According to an analysis of election results by Guth, Southern
Baptist ministers supported for Bush's father, George Bush, by 2 to
1 over all other Republican candidates in the 1988 presidential
primaries in the South.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's religious appeal may help him among religious
conservatives in other Southern states and in parts of the Midwest,
where evangelicals are numerous, during primaries next month. But
what it will mean in Arizona and Michigan, two states with
Republican primaries on Tuesday, is less certain.
</P>
<P>
   Phoenix is home to several large, conservative-leaning
congregations. And Arizona has a substantial Mormon population. But
it is also John McCain's home state and has a libertarian streak to
its politics.
</P>
<P>
   Michigan has a large Roman Catholic population, especially
around Detroit, while its southwest is home to many conservative
Calvinists. Polls of voters during the Republican primary in
Michigan in 1992 showed then that 21 percent of those voters
identified with the religious right, a smaller proportion than
turned out in South Carolina on Saturday.

<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; Michael Sherwood turned to biometrics because he and his staff
were drowning in a sea of forgotten passwords.
<P>
   ``It was a pain,'' said Sherwood, computer systems director for
the San Diego County city of Oceanside. ``We were getting called
out at 1 in the morning to reset a password.''
</P>
<P>
   But since last year, the 1,200 city employees have been logging
on to the computer network using something they can't forget _
their fingers.
</P>
<P>
   In the process, those employees have become a living
demonstration of how a new generation of biometric devices _
computer-powered gizmos that recognize a person's unique physical
characteristics like fingerprints, face, eyes, hand or voice
patterns _ are slowly creeping into the business and consumer
worlds.
</P>
<P>
   The growing use of computers to store personal information and
for electronic commerce isincreasing the need for tighter security
measures. Recent hacker attacks have highlighted how computer codes
and personal identification numbers are easily hijacked.
</P>
<P>
   That's ignited a race among companies to keep data safe, and
makers of biometrics products believe they have the perfect
solution.
</P>
<P>
   Computer-makers like Compaq plan to ship laptops equipped with
the same type of thumb-size fingerprint reading device that has cut
75 percent of forgotten-password calls to Sherwood's department,
which would get as many as 100 such calls a day.
</P>
<P>
   Similar fingerprint-recognition devices are also available for
Palm Pilot organizers, and even Walt Disney World is using them to
identify season pass holders.
</P>
<P>
   Banks, casinos and grocery stores are installing special ATMs
that recognize customers by scanning their faces or the iris of
their eyes. Government border agents in several countries are
employing face- or hand-scanning technology, while Alaska Airlines
is testing whether automated face recognition will speed passenger
boarding.
</P>
<P>
   There are even new high-tech pens that recognize a person's
signature, and software that clocks people in to work using the
employee's unique hand dimensions. The new Microsoft Windows 2000
operating system released last week was designed to support
biometric devices.
</P>
<P>
   Currently, the commercial use of biometric technology is still
limited. The overall market for biometrics was about $325 million
in 1999, according to the research firm International Data Corp.
But $300 million of that was by government agencies, usually for
criminal identification, and the rest came from the private sector.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the corporate space, (biometrics) is relatively immature,''
said IDC analyst Chris Christiansen. But, he added, ``We could see
that market easily doubling in the next few years.''
</P>
<P>
   Biometric proponents say it's virtually impossible to
counterfeit an eye, face, voice or handprint.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm starting to see biometrics coming in with high-end laptops
and keyboards,'' Christiansen said. ``In two or three years, it
will be in handheld computers, mobile devices and cellular devices
simply because there's so much personal information stored and
corporate intellectual property to protect.''
</P>
<P>
   Christiansen believes fingerprint recognition may have an early
leg up because major companies like Motorola, Nokia, Sony and NEC
are moving quickly to grab a piece of the market.
</P>
<P>
   ``The buzz on fingerprint is better, not because fingerprint is
a better technology than face, but fingerprint has got a greater
degree of momentum,'' Christiansen said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherwood said the fingerprint readers that Oceanside installed
for city workers cut down on the number of passwords they had to
remember. The employees had as many as nine passwords or codes to
access different levels of the city's computer system, in addition
to their own personal banking account PINs and Internet service
passwords.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the workers log in by placing their finger on a $99 print
reader that plugs into each computer, although some still have to
enter codes to access top-secret data, such as financial records or
criminal information.
</P>
<P>
   The inch-long, 3/4-inch wide reader uses a silicon chip made by
Motorola Corp. and software made by Identix Corp. of Sunnyvale.
Both companies believe the biometric market can expand to $1
billion a year by the end of 2001, especially as more transactions
are done over the Internet and with wireless devices like cell
phones and personal data assistants.
</P>
<P>
   But Jim Wayman, director of the National Biometric Test Center
at San Jose State University, said he's not quite ready to believe
the hype, since he's heard proclamations that ``This is the year of
biometrics'' every year since 1994.
</P>
<P>
   He noted that so far there has been little profit for about two
dozen companies worldwide working on various biometric products,
including devices that detect the vein patterns on the back of a
hand, the way a person walks or someone's body odor. Many of the
companies ``come and go so quickly it's hard to keep track of
them,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yet he does believe the commercial biometrics market will take
off as companies find more uses for the products. Although
proponents of each technology tout theirs as superior to the
others, Wayman said the question of which is best depends on how
they are used.
</P>
<P>
   Fingerprint technology, for example, is cheaper, but isn't
practical for high-traffic areas where the devices tend to get
smudged, he said. Iris scanning would work for those areas, but the
$4,000 to $20,000 cost per scanner will scare off potential buyers,
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Biometrics makes Alabama resident Scott McDonald nervous for
another reason _ all the personal information computers can glean
and store from faces, fingers and voices.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald has started a Web site called ``Fight the Fingerprint''
to muster opposition to ``all government sanctioned biometrics and
Social Security identification schemes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The whole Big Brother aspect comes into play whenever so much
information is available about you someplace,'' McDonald said. ``In
a free society, we should be able to engage in commerce unless and
until we do something wrong.''

A LESS COMPLEX LINUX: FIRM WANTS TO MAKE OS AS EASY AS
MAC,  WINDOWS 
 &HT;     BY HENRY NORR
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
For the average computer user, Linux isn't nearly as friendly as
its smiling penguin mascot suggests. But now, proponents of the
freely distributed operating system are stepping up efforts to make
it more inviting to non-geeks.
<P>
   Eazel, a Palo Alto startup, is working with volunteer
programmers around the world to give Linux a new ``graphical
shell'' _ a point-and-click interface for managing files and
folders.
</P>
<P>
   Their goal: to make the upstart OS at least as easy to use as
the Mac or Windows _ and eventually even easier.
</P>
<P>
   It's an ambitious objective, but the people leading Eazel have
done it before. Most of them played key roles in creating Apple's
Macintosh almost two decades ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to raise the bar in the same way the Finder and
MacPaint and MacWrite did,'' said company co-founder Andy
Hertzfeld, referring to the Mac's first software _ some of which he
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   The Eazel initiative isn't the first effort to humanize Linux.
Its users already have a choice among two fairly extensive
graphical user interfaces, called KDE and Gnome, as well as a
variety of more limited ``window managers.'' Eazel originally
intended to offer its own alternative, but recently decided to join
the international team working on the second version of Gnome.
</P>
<P>
   The combined product, called Gnome 2.0, is slated for release
this summer. Like Linux itself, it will be distributed under an
``open-source'' license. It will be free to users, and its source
code, or underlying programming instructions, will be available to
programmers who want to improve or customize it.
</P>
<P>
   The details of Eazel's file-management software, code-named
Nautilus, are still in flux, but to judge by current prototypes,
Windows and Mac users will find it easy to master. Along with
familiar GUI basics _ icons, menus and multiple windows _ it will
offer a number of innovations, including the ability to view the
contents of many kinds of files right in the folder windows that
contain them. Icons will be variable in size, and users will be
able to zoom in and out to see more or less detail. Icons for text
documents will include the first few words or lines; for graphics
files, the image itself will be the icon.
</P>
<P>
   Eazel's executives know they won't be able to transform Linux
overnight. ``Linux for your mom is where we want to end up,'' said
Bart Decrem, one of the company's co-founders, ``but for the next
year or two, The software will be ``componentized,'' according to
Hertzfeld, so other developers will have an easy way to add new
capabilities.
</P>
<P>
   Hertzfeld, who co-founded Eazel last August and now holds the
title ``software wizard,'' designed much of the original Mac OS,
including its user-interface code, while working at Apple in the
early 1980s. The new company's chief executive, Mike Boich, served
as Apple's first ``software evangelist'' for the Mac, before going
on to found two graphics-hardware companies, Radius and Rendition.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, another Apple veteran _ Bud Tribble, manager of the
original Macintosh software team _ signed on with Eazel as vice
president of software engineering. After leaving Apple in the
mid-1980s, Tribble, a former neurosurgeon, became vice president of
software engineering at Steve Jobs' NeXT Computer, then moved to
Sun Microsystems, where he helped create the Java programming
language. Most recently he has served as chief technology officer
for the Sun-Netscape Alliance, which produces e-commerce software.
</P>
<P>
   Eazel's board includes Mike Homer, a former marketing executive
at Apple who went on to become an executive vice president at
Netscape and now holds the title of senior vice president at
America Online.
</P>
<P>
   Eazel's other co-founder, Decrem, is a native of Belgium. He
graduated from Stanford Law School and then founded Plugged In, a
nonprofit ``community technology access center'' in East Palo Alto.
</P>
<P>
   The startup's original funding came from its founders and
employees, but it has subsequently received ``angel'' investments
from several high-profile Silicon Valley sources, including Ron
Conway's Angel Investors, Sippl cq  &LR; Macdonald Ventures and former
Macromedia chairman John ``Bud'' Colligan, now a partner at
venture-capital firm Accel Partners. The amounts have not been
disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The company also has yet to disclose details of its business
plan, but it reportedly intends to generate revenues by offering
tech support, automated updates and configuration assistance over
the Internet to users of its software.
</P>
<P>
   Linux, a derivative of the Unix operating system, originally
sported a ``command-line interface,'' requiring users to type in
cryptic instructions for even basic functions such as launching
programs and copying files. The initial versions of KDE and Gnome,
along with a variety of more limited ``window managers,'' made the
system easier to manage, but they remain more complex than Windows
or the Mac, and at times users may still confront a command line.
</P>
<P>
   Linux's popularity has skyrocketed over the last few years, but
mainly on computers used as Internet servers. In addition,
International Data Corp. recently estimated that some 4 million
people now use it on desktop machines, but most of these are
programmers, engineers and other technical users.
</P>
<P>
   While the addition of Eazel and its software heavy hitters are a
major boost to the Gnome team, the rival KDE interface is likely to
remain a strong alternative. The two Linux distributors who have
put the most emphasis on reaching out to mainstream desktop users _
Caldera Systems of Orem, Utah, and Corel of Ottawa, Canada _
currently ship KDE with their versions of the OS. And like the
Gnome group, the team behind KDE is hard at work on an ambitious
second version.
</P>
<P>
   A variety of other companies are also at work on new software
that could attract a broader audience to Linux. Corel, which
already offers a Linux version of its WordPerfect word processing
program, is now bringing the complete WordPerfect Office suite,
which also includes a spreadsheet, database, and graphics tools, to
the new platform.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a Cambridge, Mass., startup named HelixCode is
reportedly developing a Linux equivalent to Microsoft Outlook, a
program widely used for e-mail, scheduling and other basic needs on
Windows systems. HelixCode's staff includes Miguel de Icaza, the
former Mexican university network administrator who initiated the
Gnome project.

   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
 &LR;   &LR; I'm always on the lookout for good stock ideas. Anyone who
spends much time online knows there is an abundance of tips out
there, but quality is another matter. Over time, I've accumulated a
list of sites I can count on for good ideas. Here are some of my
favorites.
<P>
   CBS MarketWatch
</P>
<P>
   I rely on CBS MarketWatch ( &LR; cbs.marketwatch.com &LR; ) for timely
ideas from what I call ``superstar pundits.''
</P>
<P>
   These are the well-known money managers and analysts you
frequently see on TV and quoted in the financial press.
</P>
<P>
   The only problem is finding them. CBS MarketWatch is difficult
to navigate. The best way to find the columns is to select Regular
Features just below the main headlines on the home page. Then click
on Commentary for a list of current columns.
</P>
<P>
   CBS MarketWatch carries at least a dozen different columns. Here
are the ones I try not to miss.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Frank Cappiello &LR; . The longtime Wall Street Week panelist is a
mutual fund and money manager who favors blue-chip growth stocks.
His columns mix overall market comments with specific stock
recommendations.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Courtney Smith &LR; . Orbitex Funds' chief investment strategist
uses fundamental analysis to select stocks but also looks at the
charts before he buys a company. Smith's columns generally feature
a single company, usually midcap growth, describing its business
and prospects in detail.
</P>
<P>
   &UR; Joe Battipaglia &LR; . The chairman of investment policy at Gruntel
&AMP; Company focuses on the technology portion of the market. He
sometimes recommends individual stocks, but his emphasis is on the
outlook for the tech market in general. Run for cover when he gets
bearish.
</P>
<P>
   CBS MarketWatch archives three or four recent columns by each
pundit. You can find them by clicking Commentary Library on the
Commentary page.

   Jubak's Future Fantastic 50 is an aggressive, mostly high-tech
version of his conservative ``50 Best Stocks in the World''
portfolio. Jubak started the Future Fantastic 50 on July 30, 1999,
and hasn't made any changes since. As of Jan. 28, 2000, the
portfolio was up 62.9 percent since inception compared to 2.4
percent for the S&AMP;P 500 index.
</P>
<P>
   ValueStocks.net
</P>
<P>
   &LR;  &QL; 
 &LR;  ValueStocks.net ( &LR; www.valuestocks.net &LR; ) is run by Dr. Michael J.
Burry, CEO and chief investment strategist at hedge fund Scion
Capital Inc.
</P>
<P>
   Burry, inspired by Benjamin Graham, looks for beaten down stocks
trading far below their real or intrinsic value.
</P>
<P>
   Burry tracks his stock picks in a hypothetical mutual fund he
calls the VSN Fund. You can see his portfolio of 20 or so stocks by
selecting VSN Portfolio on ValueStocks.net's home page.
</P>
<P>
   When I looked, he had shorted Amazon.com. Burry does a lot of
trading for a disciple of Benjamin Graham. As of February 8, most
of the stocks had been in the portfolio less than three months. You
can see his trades for each month by clicking on VSN Fund Activity
below the portfolio and fund results.
</P>
<P>
   The VSN Fund returned 68.1 percent in 1999 according to Burry.
</P>
<P>
   America-iNvest.com
</P>
<P>
   The site MicroCap1000.com was renamed America-iNvest.com
( &LR; www.america-invest.com &LR; ) in November when it expanded its focus
beyond micro-cap stocks to encompass all size companies. The site
provides two good sources of ideas: the Model Portfolio and
Editor's Choice.
</P>
<P>
   The Model Portfolio is a basket of 15 or so stocks taken from
the site's MicroCap 1000 index. The index consists of 1,000
companies with a maximum market cap of $500 million. They're all
listed on the Nasdaq or the New York or American stock exchanges.
According to the site, the Model Portfolio returned 143 percent in
1999.
</P>
<P>
   You'll find the Model Portfolio by clicking Portfolios on the
home page and then selecting MicroCap Model Portfolio. Click on the
link at the bottom to see deleted listings.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Heftner, America-iNvest.com's editor, highlights
individual stocks in his Editor's Choice column. The updates appear
on an irregular schedule, but at least once a week. Heftner gives a
detailed rundown on each company, its business and competitors.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned investors treat all tips, whether from Warren Buffett
or a Yahoo chat room, as ideas to be researched, not ``buy''
signals.

HOW TO GET DRUGMAKERS TO DO THE RIGHT THING 
 &HT;     BY TOM ABATE
</HEADLINE>
   &HT;     c.1999 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Miraculous advances in medicine are widening the gap between the
healthy nations of the West and the rest of the planet, where poor
people die by the millions from illnesses that aren't lucrative
enough to interest drug companies.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the moment, the fruits of biotechnology are available only
to the fortunate few and not to the many,'' says Richard Feachem,
director of the Institute for Global Health in San Francisco.
</P>
<P>
   Feachem gathered more than three dozen world health leaders in
Carmel this past weekend to discuss the embarrassing fact that,
while medicine has increased life spans in the developed world to
77, average life expectancy in the poorest nations is closer to 52.
</P>
<P>
   Feachem enlisted the support of people such as Sean Lance, chief
executive of Chiron Corp. in Emeryville; Adel Mahmoud, president of
the vaccines division for New Jersey's Merck; Dr. Sally Stansfield,
medical director for the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation; and
World Bank economist Joseph Stiglitz.
</P>
<P>
   The get-together was called to suggest tax and other incentives
to encourage the development of vaccines for illnesses such as
diarrhea and pneumonia, which kill millions of poor kids but are
not considered drug research targets because there's no money in
curing them.
</P>
<P>
   It can take 10 to 15 years and hundreds of millions of dollars
to develop a new vaccine or a drug. Companies have a tough time
justifying that sort of expense for malaria research, when a drug
to fight fat, impotence or cholesterol would be a much bigger
moneymaker.
</P>
<P>
   ``Senior execs regret this, but they have commercial pressures
on their decisions they cannot ignore,'' Feachem said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, some companies have bucked the profit motive and
done the right thing.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1970s, for instance, scientists at Merck realized that
Ivermectin, a drug they were developing to treat heartworms in
dogs, also seemed to kill the parasite that causes river blindness
in West Africa.
</P>
<P>
   River blindness is spread by parasites that breed alongside
fast-moving water. The parasites multiply and migrate through the
body, causing a debilitating itch and, in many cases, blindness.
</P>
<P>
   Merck executives gave the scientists permission spend years
modifying the dog drug to be safe for humans. By 1987, Merck had
created Mectizan, a $1.50 pill that prevented infection by the
parasites that caused river blindness.
</P>
<P>
   There was just one hitch. There was no market for Mectizan.
National governments in West Africa pleaded poverty. People in the
bush were too poor to pay. International health agencies had other
priorities than mass-purchasing river blindness pills and then
giving them away.
</P>
<P>
   So Merck decided to make Mectizan freely available,
indefinitely. So far the company has dispensed 400 million pills
though a network of public health officials. The program has been
so successful that last year the World Health Organization declared
river blindness ``on the verge of elimination,'' and credited
Merck's pill with sparing 12 million African children from
blindness.
</P>
<P>
   A Merck spokesperson said the company was able to justify the
giveaway because Ivermectin, the dog pill, was so profitable.
Imagine that. Dogs in the developed world have greater access to
pharmaceuticals than West Africans.
</P>
<P>
   And that is really what the medical divide boils down to, a
problem in purchasing power. Japan topped the world in per capita
drug consumption in 1990, according to Feachem's figures, spending
$412 per person. Germany and the United States followed at $222 and
$191, respectively. Mexico managed $28 per head, far less than its
northern neighbor but still far more than the $4 spent by Kenyans
or the $3 spent by Indians.
</P>
<P>
   Given that drug development will always follow the money,
Feachem's group can only hope to propose modest measures to
redirect some research toward unprofitable Third World killers like
malaria or tuberculosis.
</P>
<P>
   But at least policymakers are receptive. Legislation now in
Congress, including Rep. Nancy Pelosi's HR 1274, would create tax
incentives for vaccine research. President Clinton, who addressed
the medical divide in his State of the Union speech, has asked
industry leaders to join him in March to find ways to bridge the
gap.
</P>
<P>
   Feachem hopes to come away from Carmel with proposals, vetted by
industrial, governmental and philanthropic leaders, to put into
Clinton's hands. I'll revisit the issue from time to time.
</P>
<P>
   CASE IN POINT: ``The Coming Age of Biotech,'' by Richard Oliver,
business professor at Vanderbilt University, captures the
excitement engendered by biotechnology. &UR;  &LR; Oliver isn't troubled by
the inequities in the distribution of medical advances. His point
is that science is poised to deliver fascinating therapies for
people with money.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Coming Age'' heralds potential breakthroughs _ such as
stem cell research to grow new organs and drugs to preserve memory
_ in breathless, hyper-optimistic prose. Biotechnology, Oliver
writes, ``promises to add more years to human life expectancy in
the next half century than were added throughout all prior human
history!''
</P>
<P>
   Though hyperbolic, Oliver provides a good overview of the
currents in biotech research and development. He explains how
biotech will affect not just drugs and agriculture, but every form
of manufacturing. Biotech has taught scientists how to create
molecules that perform specific tasks.
</P>
<P>
   So far, we've used these molecule-building skills to fashion new
drugs. But biotech techniques can be just as readily applied to
creating inorganic molecules to filter pollution from the air,
perhaps, or build microscopic machines. Science is on the verge,
says Oliver, of ``making every atom and every cell a factory.''
</P>
<P>
   Heady stuff, and some of it no doubt true. I thank Scott
Morrison, biotech consultant with Ernst &AMP; Young in Palo Alto, for
bringing it to my attention.
</P>
<P>
   People interested in learning more about biotech would benefit
from a skeptical reading of ``The Coming Biotech Age.'' Just figure
that everything will take longer and be more difficult than he
assumes, and that the most profound changes are probably things
Oliver hasn't imagined. It is an exciting time in bioscience, and
the book sizzles with that sentiment.

RARE ADIRONDACK AVALANCHE KILLS SKIER AND INJURES FIVE OTHERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By ROBERT D. McFADDEN    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Six back-country skiers who ventured into a dangerous snowslide
area were caught in a roaring avalanche and swept hundreds of yards
down a mountainside in the Adirondack High Peaks of northern New
York State on Saturday. Rescuers found one dead under the snow and
his companions all injured, one critically.
</P>
<P>
   While avalanches are not uncommon in Alaska and the Alps, they
are unusual in New York, and state officials and forest rangers
said they could not recall a similar death in Adirondack Park, the
vast preserve of mountains, lakes and forests stretching from the
Mohawk River to the Canadian border.
</P>
<P>
   The weather was not stormy, although three to four inches of
snow fell in the area Friday night, and the cause of the slide was
unclear. But state officials said that Hurricane Floyd last
September may have been a factor. Its rains caused a landslide that
swept away vegetation and soil from the slope where the snow
collapsed. It had been posted for months with warnings to hikers
and skiers.
</P>
<P>
   The avalanche _ a shelf of snow 100 yards wide that broke loose
and rumbled down 500 yards _ struck shortly before 1 p.m. on the
northeast slope of Wright Peak, a 4,580-foot mountain nine miles
south of Lake Placid. In its path was a party of skiers who had
been warned orally twice that the slope was unstable.
</P>
<P>
   The skiers, far off the marked trails and more than halfway up
the mountain, were carried away. ``They rode it down,'' said Lt.
Gary Roberts, the state forest ranger who coordinated the search
and rescue operation. ``It must have been a couple of hundred
yards, and it must have been terrifying.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said that Toma Jacob Vracarich, 27, of Lake Placid,
was buried in the snow and killed. Lauren Konowitz, of Keene, N.Y.,
suffered head and internal injuries, multiple fractures and
hypothermia. She also was buried, although she was soon uncovered
by two companions who were less seriously hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Roberts said that a witness had heard the avalanche and used a
cell phone to call forest rangers of the State Department of
Environmental Protection, which manages the state parks. Two
rangers on skis, Jim Giglento and Gary Hodgson, were on patrol in
the area, checking avalanche conditions, and within 40 minutes had
found the five survivors, Roberts said.
</P>
<P>
   A state police helicopter ferried them to the Adirondack Medical
Center in nearby Saranac Lake, where Konowitz underwent surgery and
was admitted to the intensive care unit in guarded condition. Her
husband, Ron Konowitz, and the others, Dean Cook, of Saranac Lake,
Christina Ford, of Lake Placid, and Rohan Roy, of Chateaugay, were
treated for various injuries and released.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, a search for Vracarich was organized. The effort was
joined through the afternoon by 50 people _ forest rangers, state
police officers, Lake Placid firefighters, officials of the State
Emergency Management Office and the State Office of Fire Prevention
and Control and local volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   Snowmobiles were used to bring in long probes to search the
snow, portable lights and other equipment. Rangers said the search
was difficult because the area had been hazardous since the runoff
of Hurricane Floyd five months ago, and had been made more
dangerous by snowstorms and thawing that created shelves of
unstable snow. Some skiers had reported wandering into armpit-deep
snow.
</P>
<P>
   It was after dark, about 6 p.m. Saturday, when a dog belonging
to a volunteer led the searchers to Vracarich's body. It was buried
in about three and a half feet of snow, Roberts said. The victim
was taken to Lake Saranac, pending an autopsy.
</P>
<P>
   Jennifer Post, a spokeswoman for the State Department of
Environmental Conservation, said the avalanche occurred on a slope
where a major landslide had taken place last September, part of the
widespread damage caused by the torrential rains of Hurricane
Floyd.
</P>
<P>
   The landslide _ one of several at the time in the 46 Adirondack
High Peaks ranging up to more than 5,000 feet _ left a swath of
Wright Peak's northeast slope denuded of vegetation, a barren area
that could not hold soil or snow. The slope had been posted with
warnings for months, and the skiers, said to be very experienced,
had been warned, Post said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They knew they were taking a risk,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were signs in the area and they apparently had been
warned on Friday and Saturday, by a forest ranger and by someone
from the Adirondack Mountain Club,'' she said, referring to a
private group. ``They were cautioned about the possibility of
slides.''
</P>
<P>
   But Post and Roberts noted that the skiers, while taking a
chance, had done nothing illegal in going into the dangerous area.
And despite the accident and a continuing investigation, he said,
the slope where the avalanche occurred will remain open to the
public.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of freedom out there in the park,'' the
lieutenant said. ``That's the way it has to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Although avalanches are relatively uncommon in New York, at
least 33 major snowslides have struck south-central Alaska in
recent weeks. They have killed two people, flattened homes and
warehouses, snapped trees, cut off electricity to thousands,
blocked highways and caused an estimated $16 billion in damage.
</P>
<P>
   In Alaska, where 11 people were killed in avalanches last year,
experts say this year's slides, two of them mile-wide monsters,
have been caused by unusual cycles of thawing and freezing,
creating unstable glacial shelves on mountain sides and conditions
for what one official called ``hundred-year avalanches.''

EDITORIAL: BUSH SWINGS BACK 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Feb. 21:
</P>
<P>
   The unpredictable Republican presidential campaign entered a new
phase with Gov. George W. Bush's numerically impressive but
tactically brutal victory in the South Carolina primary. Having
established his resilience as a campaigner, Bush now has a chance
to all but knock out Sen. John McCain in Michigan. But the South
Carolina spectacle was an expensive contest for both the candidates
and their party. It exposed cleavages and identity issues within
Republicanism that have been brewing for 20 years. And both the
winner and the loser leave their highly personal conflict in South
Carolina with big unanswered questions about who they really are.
</P>
<P>
   To be sure, Bush showed that he could sharpen his message and
fire up his organization to turn out traditional conservatives. But
it was hardly a reassuring performance to swing voters troubled
about whether Bush has presidential-scale experience and intellect.
Having stepped onto the national stage as a healing centrist, he
ran hard to the right in one of the GOP's most reactionary
redoubts. There is still a rote quality to his message and his
content-free sloganeering. He started out as a ``compassionate
conservative'' and now claims to be a ``reformer with results.''
But a talent for alliteration does not add up to a sound grasp of
policy. Even in victory, Bush seemed fearful of voyaging into
expansive discussions of education, health care, budget policy and
foreign affairs.
</P>
<P>
   McCain may have done himself as much damage with a scornful
concession speech as Bush had inflicted at the polls. The Arizona
senator has been assuring everyone that he is a Reaganite optimist
who really does not possess the explosive temper attributed to him
in Beltway lore. But the testiness of McCain's comments about
Bush's ``negative message of fear'' _ and his coyness with
interviewers about his real meaning _ gave voters an unsettling
glimpse of a heretofore veiled aspect of McCain's personality.
</P>
<P>
   The contest between these two men could be resolved in a matter
of days, depending on whether McCain can match Bush's ability to
get off the canvas. But the underlying dispute about their party's
direction is likely to play out more slowly. Not since Ronald
Reagan's challenge to President Ford in 1976 has there been such a
frank contest over the fundamentals of the party. McCain has
denounced what he calls the ``iron triangle'' of lobbyists,
campaign donations and legislation in Washington. But in South
Carolina he was done in by the party's ``iron triangle'' of
religious conservatism, tobacco money and anti-abortion groups that
has been the basis for GOP dominance in the Sun Belt for two
decades.
</P>
<P>
   South Carolinians took McCain for someone who was trying to
transform the party and send it in an entirely new direction. In a
calculated sacrifice of his moderate credentials, Bush made himself
an instrument of a core-Republican backlash in South Carolina. Yet
Bush has been around politics long enough to know that there is
much that is appealing about McCain's message for a
general-election candidate. Republicans, Democrats and independents
alike have been moved by McCain's denunciation of special interests
in Washington, of pork-barrel spending and tax breaks for the
privileged.
</P>
<P>
   But this message was engulfed by a tide of resentment in South
Carolina among the anti-government religious conservatives who have
been a key element in the party's modern renaissance. Ronald Reagan
managed to come across as someone who shared those voters' negative
feelings about Washington but was still full of an optimism and
hope for the future. It is unclear whether Bush can draw on this
politics of resentment without becoming its captive. It is equally
unclear whether McCain can stow his personal resentment toward Bush
and get the positive side of his personality back out in front.
Michigan's rambunctious electorate _ with its blue-collar
Republicans and Reagan Democrats _ will provide a testing ground
more favorable to McCain. But the advantage is all with Bush right
now, and after South Carolina, no one can deny that he has the will
and the money to press that advantage.

TOGETHER ON THE STUMP: MRS. CLINTON AND GORE 
</HEADLINE>
   (rk) 
 By KATHARINE Q. SEELYE   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y _ They sat with their heads together, whispering
into each other's ears and at one point holding hands. They bobbed
and swayed and clapped in syncopation as the crimson-robed choir
rocked behind them. They invoked their college days and Bob Dylan
and their 1992 bus adventure across America.
</P>
<P>
   And at the end of a three-hour church service here, nothing
seemed more natural than the fact that Vice President Al Gore and
Hillary Rodham Clinton would be campaigning together, reinforcing
each other with their shared political heritage and their shared
political desire to run on Bill Clinton's successful economic
record but away from his impeachment-stained legacy.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Clinton have left the White House nest and are learning
to fly on their own. Sunday at the Wilborn Temple, a historic black
church in downtown Albany packed with more than 1,000 worshipers,
the two came together for the first time as candidates, he for
president, she for senator from New York. They praised each other
to the rafters and their spokesmen said the two were eager to
appear together again.
</P>
<P>
   Gore has been on his own a little longer and his wings seem a
little stronger. He dominated the service with a rousing 25-minute
sermon that prompted some in the audience to call out ``Preach!''
and ``Amen!'' as he proclaimed the nation to be at a ``mountaintop
moment.'' He exulted in the first lady's work for education and
families. ``I have seen her rare mix of idealism and effective
leadership, of inspiration and stamina,'' he declared from the
pulpit.
</P>
<P>
   For her part, Clinton lavished similar praise on Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``No one in America is more qualified to lead us than our vice
president,'' she said. ``He knows what to do and how to do it, in
ways visible and perhaps invisible to the general public. He has
been the partner in progress that has been made with our president
and has helped to lead this country to this extraordinary moment of
opportunity and obligation.''
</P>
<P>
   The moment they were referring to was the one where the country
is now, leading the longest economic expansion in American history.
But the moment that drew such attention was the intersection of
these two candidates _ one a vice president who is campaigning with
a new sure-footedness as he marches through the primary season, the
other a first lady who is making a historic leap for political
office, both of them linked to a president both hailed and scorned.
</P>
<P>
   Gore and Clinton had been circling each other for some time, but
aides to both determined that the moment for their joint appearance
was at last ripe. In other words, they would probably help each
other more than they would hurt.
</P>
<P>
   Long gone are the days of rumors of their rivalry for the
president's attention and their competition to make major
announcements. When Clinton met Gore's limousine Sunday morning
outside the red-brick church, they hugged each other with what
seemed like genuine affection.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just to see him was a pleasure,'' Clinton said later. ``I'm
very fond of him personally.''
</P>
<P>
   They made their joint debut to an overwhelmingly sympathetic
crowd, at a service for the annual meeting of the Legislature's
black and Hispanic members. Black and Hispanic Americans are among
President Clinton's most loyal supporters, and they make up about
15 percent of the state's Democratic voters. (Gore even dropped a
little Spanish into his sermon Sunday; Clinton said that as a girl,
she had heard the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. speak and ``it
changed my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is enormously popular among these core Democratic
voters, as is Gore. The thinking in both campaigns is that Clinton
could help boost the turnout in New York's March 7 presidential
primary for Gore over former Sen. Bill Bradley. Of course, Gore is
already well on his way to claiming his party's nomination, so
there was no real risk for him Sunday in appearing with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, advisers in both camps expect that by the
fall, Gore, as a Democrat, will be stronger in New York than the
Republican presidential nominee, whoever that is, and that he can
then help Clinton. He may face more of a problem in aligning
himself with her at that time if she has not won over at least two
groups _ white women and Orthodox Jews _ who are not now
enthusiastic about her candidacy.
</P>
<P>
   The problem for Gore and Clinton is that together, they are a
double-dose extension of the Clinton era. They both played that
association down Sunday, with Clinton brushing past a reference to
``our president'' and Gore paying hasty respect to the Clinton-Gore
ticket.
</P>
<P>
   But most striking was how very similar their speeches were, both
in style and in content. Great chunks of their speeches were
interchangeable with each other's and with President Clinton's.
</P>
<P>
   They both highlighted the economic boom, the low unemployment
rate for African-Americans and the strides in helping families pay
for college. They both said that while much had been achieved in
the last several years, much remained to be done. And they offered
the same centrist-Democratic course for the future, calling for the
expansion of health care and advocating hooking up all classrooms
to the Internet, making prescription drugs cheaper for the elderly
and closing the digital divide, in which those with computers (who
tend to be white) have economic advantages over those without
computers (who tend to be members of minorities).
</P>
<P>
   In reference to high rates of poverty in New York, Clinton said,
``It doesn't have to be this way.'' This has been a longtime
campaign theme for Gore, who tells audiences, ``It's not supposed
to be this way.'' After they spoke, the Rev. A.R. Bernard Sr., the
guest minister, took the pulpit and highlighted something else they
have in common _ bad press. He said he was grateful for the chance
to meet them and touch their hands. ``I've learned not to let the
newspapers tell me who people are,'' he said to great applause.
</P>
<P>
   For some, President Clinton's scandals only forged a new respect
for the first lady. As Gloria Davis, an assemblywoman from the
Bronx, said in introducing her, ``She knows what trials and
tribulations are.'' She later added: ``We understand Hillary. She
may be young. But she has what it takes, because in this world you
got to be strong. You got to be able to say, `Back off.' You got to
be able to say, `Move over.'''
</P>
<P>
   Many of the churchgoers seemed charmed by the event. Rodney
Goulding, 66, a retired police officer from the Bronx, said he
would vote for Clinton and Gore after hearing them Sunday. ``This
country is in the best shape that it's ever been,'' he said, ``and
you don't want to stop the ball from rolling.''

NEW ZEALAND IS SMART AND SHARP IN RACE 1 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Subs for complete writethru.)

<P>
   AUCKLAND, New Zealand _ From the transom of Team New Zealand's
latest weapon of engagement, NZL 60, Brad Butterworth, the Kiwi
tactician, basked in the cheers of thousands of dockside
well-wishers moments before pulling into his syndicate's compound
Sunday after a businesslike 1-minute-17-second victory over Italy's
Prada Challenge in Race 1 of the five-of-nine-race America's Cup
finals. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   With a broad grin plastered across his mug, Butterworth caught
the eye of someone ashore. Then he wagged his index finger skyward,
toward the glorious blue heavens, and said, ``That's one.''
</P>
<P>
   Going back to their performance in San Diego in 1995, when they
mercilessly dismantled Dennis Conner's American defender in a 5-0
drubbing, the Kiwis have won six straight races in America's Cup
finals. Considering that it has been five years since the New
Zealanders faced outside competition in a truly meaningful contest,
as opposed to in-house training and sparring, the sailing clinic
they displayed for the Italians was nothing less than masterful.
</P>
<P>
   In the aftermath, Francesco de Angelis, the low-key Prada
helmsman, was philosophical. ``It's just the beginning,'' he said.
``Someone had to win and someone had to lose. But it's just the
first day. Our team has come back before.''
</P>
<P>
   True, the Italians showed in the long lead-up to these cup
finals that they could fight back. But they had to be disheartened
by one glaring certainty. In the day's 12- to 14-knot breezes and
flat seas, the conditions in which they purportedly might enjoy a
marked speed advantage over the Kiwis, they clearly did not.
</P>
<P>
   Speaking about the boat-speed differences between NZL 60 and
Prada's Luna Rossa, one interested and knowledgeable observer, the
Australian yacht designer Iain Murray, said: ``The Kiwis have an
upwind edge, though Prada may be marginally faster downwind. But
the New Zealanders sailed a terrific race.''
</P>
<P>
   Murray's first point is open to debate. As de Angelis rightfully
said about the quickness issue: ``I think it's too early to
comment, after a shifty day like today. I think the boats are very
close.''
</P>
<P>
   But there was no disputing the fact that the Kiwis showed no
trace of the rust many felt would be inescapable after forgoing the
traditional defender trials leading up to a cup match. In their
nation of under four million citizens, Team New Zealand felt that
multiple defense syndicates would unnecessarily drain the country's
available resources in terms of both corporate backing and
manpower.
</P>
<P>
   So they decided to go it alone, and many believed that the lack
of a competitive work-up would be a fatal flaw. But the Kiwis
seemingly picked up right where they left off in 1995 and
Butterworth, particularly, was on top of his game.
</P>
<P>
   Butterworth decided, early on, that the first significant wind
shift of the day would fill in from the right, and he protected
that side of the course as if the day's outcome depended on it,
which, as events proved, it did.
</P>
<P>
   The Italian tactician Torben Grael, to his credit, also
understood that the right side would pay handsomely. And he did his
level best to get Luna Rossa past the Kiwis and over to the spot
that both crews coveted. But the Kiwis, with flawless boathandling,
would not let him by.
</P>
<P>
   Grael had one shot, as both boats converged on opposite tacks
about halfway up the first windward leg. But Luna Rossa was on port
tack and NZL 60, on starboard, held right-of-way under the racing
rules.
</P>
<P>
   The Italians would need to cross clear ahead; if the Kiwi
helmsman Russell Coutts altered course in even the slightest
manner, Luna Rossa would draw a potentially race-losing foul.
</P>
<P>
   ``That cross was the best one for us, but still it would have
been very scary to cross them, especially against those very
experienced guys,'' Grael said. ``It was early in the race and we
shouldn't risk a cross like that. We tacked to leeward and we lost
after that. But I think we wouldn't have been able to cross
anyway.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps Grael was right, and Luna Rossa would not have made it
cleanly across. And not risking everything on an early maneuver in
the opening race of the America's Cup finals was definitely the
conservative, reasoned thing to do.
</P>
<P>
   But Grael may need to rethink his strategy next time and roll
the dice, for spotting the Kiwis an early, substantial lead in this
regatta could be suicidal.
</P>
<P>
   Race 2 is Tuesday. If, at the end of the day, Brad Butterworth
is waving two fingers at the crowds, the Italians will be in deep
trouble. &QL;

NEW JERSEY CITIES ARE LOSING THEIR NAMES 
</HEADLINE>
  (lb) 
 By IVER PETERSON   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   TRENTON, N.J. _ The city is still here. It is just the name,
``Trenton,'' that is slipping fast.
</P>
<P>
   The Trenton Times dropped the name years ago as suburban
circulation grew. Trenton State College became abstracted into the
College of New Jersey three years ago, when the campus
administration became concerned with the college's image among
suburban applicants. Mayor Douglas Palmer even had to fight the
state Department of Transportation to have ``Trenton'' added to the
signs pointing to the railroad station.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a constant battle, just to keep the name up there,'' said
Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   What is happening around Trenton is also going on in other
cities that have suffered economic woes. As population and
political and financial power have swelled in the suburbs, the
identities of many old cities have fallen out of fashion and,
increasingly, out of the names of public and private institutions.
</P>
<P>
   Partly as a marketing decision aimed at suburban consumers,
partly from new suburban pride, the people who decide these things
sometimes favor names that mask the urban identity of a place or an
institution. In the shuffle, the geography of place becomes
geographically indeterminate, as with Trenton's new downtown
showplace, a $60 million sports arena, developed and underwritten
by Mercer County and named ``Sovereign Bank Arena at Mercer
County.''
</P>
<P>
   Where, Palmer wonders sardonically, is that?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to admit that I was quite shocked and taken aback to
see that sign outside and on the court inside,'' he said. ``I was
frankly a little surprised that Mercer County would feel so
insecure about their image that they would have to put that
there.''
</P>
<P>
   But image clearly counts for a lot these days, and the Postal
Service's nine-digit ZIP codes, which permit mail carriers to
ignore place names entirely, make it easier for anyone to migrate
to a more fashionable mailing address without moving a single stick
of furniture.
</P>
<P>
   Trenton has a population of 88,000, yet the local phone book
contains barely a page's worth of businesses beginning with that
name. But businesses named for Princeton, one of the most
fashionable addresses in the state, with a population of 26,000,
fill three and a half pages. How could that be? Most of the listed
businesses are in surrounding suburbs, giving ``Princeton area'' as
their address. Princeton lies about five miles from Trenton.
</P>
<P>
   Ted Hershberg, a professor of public policy at the University of
Pennsylvania and an advocate of tying cities and suburbs closer
together, complained that the tendency to deny the identity of a
region's core city amounts to a way of placating nervous
suburbanites.
</P>
<P>
   ``It provides a very subtle and insidious way to sanitize the
identity of an entire region,'' said Hershberg, a champion of
regional cooperation in Philadelphia. ``In a place where people
pride themselves on never visiting the downtown, this gets them off
scot-free _ they don't even have to recognize that they are part of
a region that owes its identity to a city.''
</P>
<P>
   Hershberg offered Temple University's conference center as an
example.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's the Sugarloaf Conference Center and it's in Philadelphia,
only its stationery says `Chestnut Hill,' which is not even a
place,'' he said. ``Here's an urban university in the heart of the
Philadelphia ghetto and these guys mask the fact that this
beautiful conference center is even in the city.''
</P>
<P>
   Harriet K. Goodheart, the university spokeswoman, said that the
university wanted only to signal to visitors looking for the center
that it was not at the university's main central city campus, but
in the neighborhood known as Chestnut Hill. ``It is a very distinct
location, very much on the far northwestern periphery of the city
and only a block or two from being in Montgomery County,'' she
said. ``It is certainly not for a more sinister reason than that.''
</P>
<P>
   The delicate nature of the name game means that it is often hard
to pin down who is making the choices.
</P>
<P>
   Robert D. Prunetti, the Mercer County executive who is
responsible for directing tens of millions of dollars in new
investment into downtown Trenton, said Sovereign Bank Corp., which
paid for the naming rights of the arena, was responsible for having
its new arena placed ``at Mercer County.''
</P>
<P>
   But the bank denied that.
</P>
<P>
   ``We did not want to appear to decrease the value of the naming
rights by adding that,'' said Melissa Gettler, vice president of
marketing at Sovereign. ``It was the county's decision.''
</P>
<P>
   The name game has been going on for some time. Newspapers were
among the first businesses to shed their urban identities in New
Jersey as their readers filled the suburbs in the 1970s, said James
R. Hughes, dean of the school of planning and urban studies at
Rutgers University.
</P>
<P>
   Today only one major daily in the state, The Asbury Park Press,
retains its old city name. The Newark Star-Ledger is just The
Star-Ledger, the former Trenton Times is just The Times, The Camden
Courier-Post moved to Cherry Hill and became The Courier-Post, and
the old Hackensack Record is now just The Record.
</P>
<P>
   Some public colleges also became suburbanized. Newark State
College moved to Union in 1958 and then became Kean College, now
Kean University. Trenton State College abruptly announced its name
change to the College of New Jersey in 1996, arguing that it wanted
a more cosmopolitan name to attract a wider range of students.
Daryl Fair, a professor of political science there, led an
unavailing fight to block the change.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not that I'm necessarily sentimental about Trenton,''
said Fair recently. ``It was just an example of the snobbery that
some people feel, who think it's better to have a more suburban
image.''
</P>
<P>
   There was a time when those roles were reversed, Hughes said.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were at the height of their industrial power, the
names of our cities were so potent you had suburbs actually taking
their names, so you have West Trenton, which is part of Ewing
Township, and East Newark, and East, North and South Brunswick and
so on,'' Hughes said.
</P>

</ANNOTATION>
<P>

</P>
<P>
   Palmer said he was loath to bite the hand that had done so much
for the city, for Mercer County not only built the new minor-league
ballpark (naming it Mercer County Waterfront Park) and the new
arena, but it is also pushing for new housing and commercial
development. Yet Trenton's mayor also remembers the little slights.
</P>
<P>
   When the county helped attract a new minor-league ball team to
the city in 1992, some team officials wanted a generic name, ``like
`The New Jersey Somethings,''' Prunetti, the Mercer County
executive, remembered, while members of the Board of Freeholders
wanted Mercer County in the name.
</P>
<P>
   Palmer was not happy. ``I went to the freeholders meeting in a
Trenton Central High School baseball uniform, with Trenton across
the front,'' he recalled. ``I said: `See? The name Trenton doesn't
look so bad.'''
</P>
<P>
   The team was named the Trenton Thunder.
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Gaughan, a lawyer and an activist for regionwide
cooperation in Buffalo, has taken on a harder task. He wants Erie
County to change its name to Buffalo County, after the city at its
core, as a way of affirming the link between city and suburb. ``I
would characterize it as a struggle,'' Gaughan said a little dryly,
``but in this dot-com age it doesn't make sense to speak of just
Erie County by itself.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, Palmer has had to be satisfied with the new minor-league
sports teams that have adopted the city's name _ the Trenton Titans
minor-league hockey team moved into the new arena this season _ but
he hopes that Trenton's name will evoke new music.
</P>
<P>
   ``The cities are coming back, people are finding that they are
great places, and I think people should be proud of the name and
help build it, and not take it away,'' he said. ``For a long time
Trenton had a negative connotation, but now I hear people saying it
in an upbeat way _ `Trenton!' _ instead of with a sneer. And just
how you say the name has a positive psychological effect.''

MRS. CLINTON JOINS CALL FOR OIL RESERVE

<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Hillary Rodham Clinton joined a growing chorus of
Northeastern lawmakers Sunday in calling for a regional oil reserve
to help states cope with future shortages of home heating oil and
tamp down soaring consumer prices.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, a candidate for United States Senate in New York, said
Northeastern states rely most heavily on home heating oil and
therefore pay the highest prices during cold spells. In recent
weeks, a coalition of Democratic and Republican lawmakers from
hard-hit Northeastern states have been calling for a regional
reserve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I take this issue very personally, as does the president,''
Clinton, who recently bought a house in Chappaqua, N.Y., said in an
interview with a local television station. ``Now that we are
homeowners here in New York, our house is heated by heating oil,
and it is extremely expensive.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's Republican opponent, Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani, has
repeatedly criticized President Clinton for refusing to release oil
from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve to drive down the cost of home
heating oil. As oil-producing countries have limited production,
the cost of heating oil soared to a peak of $2.02 earlier this
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to keep making this an issue until the president
releases the reserve,'' Giuliani said Sunday.

 IN MICHIGAN, McCAIN TARGETS WIDE MIX OF VOTERS  
 (Eds: Changes ``Feiger'' to ``Fieger'' once in graf that begins
``Though Lalonde ...'' and twice in the following graf.) 
 (lb) 
 By JAMES BENNET   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROSEVILLE, Mich. _ With time, money, momentum and the Republican
machine in Michigan working against him, Sen. John McCain is trying
to corral an unlikely coalition of moderate suburban Republicans,
poor urban Democrats and feisty blue-collar independents.
</P>
<P>
   But showing the confidence of a front-runner who feels his core
support is secure, Gov. George W. Bush signaled on Sunday that he
would compete for some of the same voters.
</P>
<P>
   That unpredictable electorate is concentrated in southeastern
Michigan, where three counties supply 40 percent of the primary
voters, and where Bush is campaigning Sunday and Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Macomb County, McCain is bidding for people like Robert
Kraft, who voted twice for Ronald Reagan, before voting twice for
Bill Clinton. A retired tool and die machinist, Kraft plans to
support the senator.
</P>
<P>
   ``McCain seems to be honest,'' Kraft said at a supermarket here.
``Bush _ he seems to be honest, but he's got all that money behind
him. He's going to have to pay that back somehow, and he's going to
forget about us people. I have to pay prescription prices, and my
wife does. Do you know how much that costs?''
</P>
<P>
   Bush does not need Kraft nearly as badly as McCain does. While
polls have shown McCain running strongly among Democrats and
independents in Michigan, his support appeared to be slipping among
Republicans even before his loss in South Carolina on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Before Sunday, the candidates had spent one day here since the
New Hampshire primary. Voters do not seem very familiar with them,
which is likely to be a bigger problem for McCain _ since he lacks
a strong organization in the state to turn voters out for him _
than for Bush. At both the western and the eastern ends of
Michigan, voters were heard in recent days to refer to the senator
as ``McLaine.''
</P>
<P>
   A couple of aisles away from Kraft, Ann D'Amato, a clerical
worker, was grocery-shopping for her family. D'Amato also voted
twice for Ronald Reagan and twice for Bill Clinton. But though she
is most concerned about drugs and violence in the streets and in
the media, D'Amato has not even considered voting for anyone but
Vice President Al Gore. She just has not seen much of McCain, she
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only times I've seen him talk _ just a few times on the
news _ he doesn't come across as forceful enough,'' D'Amato said,
making an unusual criticism of the blunt-spoken senator.
</P>
<P>
   Bush's allies here have complained about Democrats making
mischief by voting in the Republican primary, which is open to all
voters.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, Bush appeared on Sunday to be reaching out to some
of these same voters, or at least discouraging them from seeking to
punish him at the polls, by appearing in heavily Democratic Wayne
County and releasing a new commercial that presents him as a gentle
man concerned with the well-being of children.
</P>
<P>
   For his part, McCain made a play for the core of Bush's support,
campaigning in conservative western Michigan, and he is advertising
himself on radio as a ``proud, pro-life Reagan conservative.'' On
Monday he planned to campaign in Saginaw to the north and Ypsilanti
to the west, in a swing planned before his loss in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Hudome, McCain's top adviser in Michigan, said that the
senator wanted the support of Democrats and independents. ``We're
reaching out to all voters like President Reagan did,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has been reaching out to Democrats here through the mail.
Leo and Joyce Lalonde, Democrats who live in Macomb County,
received a mailing from McCain on Friday at their home in
Eastpointe, which adjoins Roseville. The Democrats are not holding
a primary, it noted (they are holding closed caucuses next month).
</P>
<P>
   ``Make your voice heard by voting for the one candidate
committed to reform,'' it continued. For those Democrats concerned
about the consequences of a crossover vote, it continued, ``Even if
you vote in Tuesday's Republican primary, you can still participate
in future Democratic Party political activity.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign has not bought any mailing lists of
Democrats, Hudome said. But the campaign has been appealing to some
Democrats by sending fliers and placing pre-recorded telephone
calls to all residents of some towns with a mixture of Democrats
and Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Joyce Lalonde, who is the chairman of the Democratic committee
for the 10th Congressional District, said she was amused by the
letter but had no intention of complying. ``You've got to
understand,'' she said. ``Their primary is Tuesday and ours is
March 11. If we mess around in theirs, they're going to mess around
in ours. That would be politically not a smart move on our part.''
She said she doubted that many Democrats would cross over for
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   Though Lalonde disavowed any Democratic effort on McCain's
behalf, other Democrats have been trying to help him, for their own
purposes. On Saturday, Geoffrey Fieger, a former Democratic
candidate for governor and the lawyer who represented Dr. Jack
Kevorkian, began running a radio advertisement excoriating Bush and
Gov. John Engler, who has thrown his party organization behind
Bush, as ``dumb and dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When John Engler and George W. Bush talk about lawsuit abuse,
they really mean they helped their friends in the insurance
industry and denied all of us access to the courts,'' Fieger says
in the commercial. In an interview, Fieger said he was seeking to
help McCain and had had no contact with his campaign.
</P>
<P>
   McCain has his own radio advertisements on the air here, warning
that unnamed forces were ``coming after him here in Michigan,'' and
stating that he would never run a negative commercial: ``They
insult your intelligence, and hurt our chances against Gore in
November.''
</P>

</P>
<P>
   In another Democratic boost to the senator, the Michigan
Democratic Party and College Democrats of Michigan plan to hold a
protest against Bush on Monday at 11:45 a.m. at Michigan State
University in Lansing, where the Texas governor is scheduled to
appear at noon. Dennis Denno, the state party's spokesman, insisted
that the protest did not signal that Democrats were siding with
McCain, although he said that no protests were planned against the
Arizona senator.
</P>
<P>
   LaMar Lemmons III, a state representative from Detroit, visited
churches Sunday to urge predominantly black congregations to
support McCain, in what he called an effort to embarrass Engler,
Bush's leading supporter here. Lemmons said that he was upset that
Engler had pushed through state legislation eliminating Detroit's
elected school board and separate criminal courts. ``We're out to
send the Republican establishment a message: They have meddled in
our affairs,'' Lemmons said.
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons said that other Democrats were quietly helping McCain in
10 of Michigan's 16 Congressional Districts, but were doing so
secretly to avoid offending the party's leaders. Mark Brewer, the
chairman of the Michigan Democratic Party, said that he did not
know of any other Democratic politicians who were supporting
McCain.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm disappointed in what LaMar is doing, but he's one state
representative out of 52'' Democrats in the Michigan House, Brewer
said. ``Any thought this will have a significant impact next
Tuesday is silly.''
</P>
<P>
   Lemmons said that he wanted to persuade 100,000 Democrats to
vote in the Michigan primary, through a a 12-line phone bank and
pamphlets and faxes sent to 200 churches. But Ed Sarpolus, a
pollster at EPIC/MRA, a polling firm in Lansing, said that based on
previous primaries, about 100,000 Democrats could be expected to
vote anyway in the Republican primary, which could draw anywhere
from 600,000 to 1 million voters altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Many voters interviewed Sunday insisted that the campaign in
South Carolina would not influence them. McCain on Sunday attacked
Bush for appearing at Bob Jones University, a conservative
Christian college in South Carolina whose president has made
critical comments about Catholics.
</P>
<P>
   But Ned McGrath, the spokesman for the Catholic Archdiocese of
Detroit, said that he had not even heard about any controversy
involving Bush's appearance at the college. The local media have
made no mention of the issue, nor has the archdiocese's weekly
newspaper, the Michigan Catholic, he said.
</P>
<P>
   In Sterling Heights, a middle-class industrial suburb north of
Detroit, several voters interviewed as they headed for services at
St. Malachy Catholic Church said they would support Bush because
they believe he is a staunch opponent of abortion. But Mike Kovacs,
31, who considers himself an independent voter and who voted for
Clinton in the last election, plans to support McCain this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think his stand on the issues is a little more solid than
George Bush's,'' said Kovacs. ``I kind of like the idea of someone
who has honesty and integrity.''
</P>
<P>
   As bells pealed through an overcast sky Sunday morning at the
Most Holy Trinity Church in Detroit's Corktown neighborhood, Alanna
Reyes-Ali, 49, said she would vote for McCain to send a message to
the state's Republicans, particularly Engler whom many city
residents blame for legislative moves that they say will hurt
Detroit's tax base and schools.
</P>
<P>
   ``With all the problems we've had with Engler with their attack
on Detroit, it gives the Democrats a chance to wreak havoc back on
them,'' she said.

NPR STARTS A MUSIC PROGRAM STRICTLY FOR INTERNET USERS 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By MATTHEW MIRAPAUL   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   National Public Radio has quietly inaugurated its first
Internet-only radio program.
</P>
<P>
   ``All Songs Considered,'' available in a streaming audio format
from the show's Web site (www.npr.org/programs/asc), features
full-length versions of the brief musical excerpts heard between
segments on NPR's ``All Things Considered'' news magazine.
</P>
<P>
   Although NPR makes some of its on-air shows available through
its Web site, the leap by a major radio organization into
Internet-only programming helps validate the concept of using the
Web to ``narrowcast'' to a smaller listener base.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Boilen serves as the disc jockey for ``All Songs
Considered.'' The first hourlong program made its debut in January,
and a second show is due to arrive online later this month. As one
of the directors of ``All Things Considered,'' Boilen selects the
dozen or so musical snippets _ known in the radio industry as
``buttons'' _ that can be heard on the daily two-hour news program.
</P>
<P>
   Boilen, who is 46 and has worked at ``All Things Considered''
for 10 years, said listeners' enthusiastic reactions to the buttons
inspired him to start the Web-based show. ``People are
music-starved,'' he said in a telephone interview. ``They like this
music because it's not like music you can hear anywhere else on the
radio. We play music from all over the world, and from all
different eras.''
</P>
<P>
   The first show includes an ethereal song by a Scandinavian
vocalist and a lush orchestral version of a Paul McCartney tune.
Boilen, who serves as the online show's host, and his producer,
Bill Deputy, also picked tracks by performers who have been
interviewed or reviewed on ``All Things Considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Joe Pezzillo, founder of GoGaGa.com, one of the first
Internet-only radio stations, said NPR's online show confirmed
``that Internet radio is a force to be reckoned with.''
</P>
<P>
   ``At first,'' Pezzillo said, ``the major radio groups regarded
the Internet as a novelty, but this is clearly yet another sign
that they need to take it seriously.''
</P>
<P>
   Because Boilen and Deputy are still experimenting with the
length of each ``All Songs Considered'' program and debating how
often to put up a new show, the service has yet to be mentioned on
``All Things Considered.''
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, they have plenty of music from which to choose.
Boilen and Marika Partridge, the other director of ``All Things
Considered,'' select 60 to 80 buttons each week. The buttons serve
as transitions between news stories, help end segments at precise
times and sometimes add an emotional or reflective element to a
piece. ``It's the glue that holds the show together,'' Boilen said.
</P>
<P>
   Boilen said his office at the show's studios in Washington had
been taken over by 4,000 to 5,000 compact disks. He picks the day's
buttons about 30 minutes before the radio show goes on the air.
``Sometimes a piece of vocal music is too overt'' in its meaning,
he said. ``An instrumental lets you fill in the blanks.''
</P>
<P>
   But the short excerpts can be hard to identify, prompting a
daily flood of letters, e-mail messages and phone calls to NPR and
its 600 affiliate stations seeking the identity of a song or
artist. Some hum the tunes, others send in chord structures.
</P>
<P>
   Since December 1995, button titles have been listed on NPR's Web
site. But because of music-licensing restrictions, the buttons are
not played on the Web version of ``All Things Considered.'' For the
new online program, however, the necessary licensing arrangements
have been made.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to the ``All Songs Considered'' site will find
information on each recording and, where possible, a link to the
label that issued it. But to avoid the appearance of journalistic
impropriety, Boilen said, the site does not send people to online
music vendors.
</P>
<P>
   Boilen is considering adding multimedia elements to the site,
perhaps a montage of photographs submitted by visitors that would
appear while a song plays. But for now, the music remains the most
important element.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm passionate about this,'' Boilen said. ``Each one of these
songs is a piece of art. But the way radio is today, this music
will never get heard. It's just out there in the wind. I just want
to give people a chance to taste it.''

EDITORIAL: THE REFORM TIDE IN IRAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Monday, Feb. 21:
</P>
<P>
   The peaceful revolt against clerical repression in Iran that
began three years ago with the election of Mohammad Khatami as
president is gaining strength. Partial returns from Friday's
parliamentary elections suggest that the reform coalition that
brought Khatami his landslide upset in 1997 and then won a broad
victory in last year's municipal elections is likely to gain
control of the legislature. Reform candidates attracted support not
just among women and young people, but among more traditional
voters in provincial towns and religious centers as well.
</P>
<P>
   The message of these elections is that an overwhelming majority
of Iranians are weary of fundamentalist rule, an ailing economy and
an abrasive foreign policy that has left Iran lagging behind at a
time of expanding prosperity and freedom around the world. Despite
rising oil prices, unemployment and poverty are pressing problems
in Iran. Many foreign investors remain skittish, while much
domestic industry is controlled by profligate and sometimes corrupt
religious foundations. Under these circumstances, job growth has
not been able to keep up with Iran's rapidly expanding population.
</P>
<P>
   The supreme religious leader, Ayatollah Ali Khameini, outranks
the elected president and parliament. He and the conservative
clerics allied with him retain considerable power to thwart the
reform agenda through their control of the security forces, the
courts and special panels that review legislation. But an alliance
between a reform majority in parliament and Khatami could loosen
the clergy's tight grip over Iran's political institutions and
allow the president to fulfill his promises to build a society
based on tolerance and the rule of law.
</P>
<P>
   Khatami's parliamentary slate has promised to enact a new and
more liberal press law, let multiple political parties compete and
challenge the clergy's power over the courts, security police and
election rules. The new Parliament will also need to come up with
an effective economic program that privatizes clerical and
government-run companies and attracts increased foreign investment
and trade. Some bolder reformers also talk of promoting changes in
foreign policy, including improved relations with the United
States. Sunday, Washington welcomed the Iranian election results.
</P>
<P>
   Iran's clerical leaders have shown themselves to be
sophisticated politicians. In recent years they have permitted
relatively free elections and have acknowledged their political
defeats. Undoubtedly, they will try to use the institutions still
under their control to slow the pace of change. But they should
have the wisdom to recognize that the Iranian people now expect to
see their country governed in a more enlightened way that respects
their personal and civil liberties, promotes economic growth and
moderates Iran's militant hostility toward the West.

NEW YORK LAWMAKER SWITCHES TO MCCAIN 
</HEADLINE>
  (ms) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD    
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Less than 24 hours after Sen. John McCain was beaten in the
South Carolina Republican presidential primary, he got a boost in
New York, where Rep. Peter T. King of Long Island announced Sunday
that he would drop his allegiance from Gov. George W. Bush and
support McCain.
</P>
<P>
   In recent days some Republican leaders in the state have
expressed ambivalence about Bush, but King, a Republican from
Seaford in Nassau County, is the first to publicly switch sides in
defiance of Gov. George Pataki, Bush's campaign chairman for New
York.
</P>
<P>
   ``John McCain needs it now more than ever,'' King said in an
interview, explaining the timing of his announcement.
</P>
<P>
   Asked Sunday in Michigan about King's defection, Bush joked,
``He must have gotten his newspaper late this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   King said he grew increasingly disappointed with Bush's
campaigning, particularly his appearance at Bob Jones University, a
conservative Christian school in Greenville, S.C., that prohibits
interracial dating. King also said that, as a Catholic, he was
offended by the school's likening Catholicism to a cult and Bush's
defending his visit to the school.
</P>
<P>
   Bush said he denounced the dating ban after his visit to the
college and pointed out that his brother was Catholic.

 By WILLIAM H. HONAN   
 c.2000 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Rudolph W. Patzert, the captain of a rusty 1904 gunboat that
carried more than 1,380 Jewish refugees from Europe to Palestine as
part of a secret rescue operation after World War II, died on Jan.
21 in a nursing home in Encinitas, Calif. He was 88.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was cancer, said his son Bill.
</P>
<P>
   During World War II, Patzert served in the Merchant Marine,
commanding a succession of the supply ships that helped form a
steel bridge across the Atlantic. When the war ended, he was
approached by representatives of the Haganah, the militia of the
Jews of Palestine, to serve as captain of the Paducah, a 900-ton
gunboat.
</P>
<P>
   During both world wars, the Paducah had cruised the Atlantic
coast on submarine watch, and was eventually decommissioned and
surreptitiously bought by the Haganah. It was to sail under the
flag of Panama.
</P>
<P>
   Officially, Patzert's assignment would be to take the ship to
Europe, but he acknowledged in a memoir that he knew the ship would
be used to transport European survivors of the Holocaust past a
British blockade into Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   He signed on for an adventure that could have inspired Leon
Uris' best-selling 1958 novel ``Exodus,'' a fictional story based
on the ordeal of Jewish settlers in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   Since World War I, the British government had overseen
Palestine. In 1917 it issued the Balfour Declaration, committing
Britain to the establishment of a Jewish homeland in Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   But as Jewish immigration into Palestine increased, and
Palestinian Arabs began to press their opposition to it, Britain
sharply limited the number of Jews entering the region.
</P>
<P>
   After the war, British authorities refused a 1947 recommendation
by an Anglo-American Committee of Inquiry to permit 100,000
European Jews to enter Palestine. Zionist groups waged covert war
against the British and tried to slip as many Jews as they could
into Palestine.
</P>
<P>
   The Paducah, staffed by American and Canadian volunteers, was
one of 10 American vessels bought by the Haganah.
</P>
<P>
   In all, the ships were to deliver about 30,000 refugees to
Palestine. As related in his memoir, ``Running the Palestine
Blockade: The Last Voyage of the Paducah'' (Naval Institute Press,
1994), Patzert's voyage proved more hazardous than most. He had
safely moved his ship, carrying 1,380 refugees, from Bulgaria to
within seven miles of the port city of Haifa when it was
intercepted by a British destroyer.
</P>
<P>
   The British ordered him to surrender. ``If you resist, the blood
will be on your head,'' the British captain said through a
megaphone. ``You are now entering territorial waters, and you are
liable to arrest if you continue.''
</P>
<P>
   Patzert instructed the helmsman to swing the Paducah's bow until
its course lay parallel to the shore. But another destroyer bore
down on the Paducah. Patzert and his passengers could see a
boarding party forming on the deck of the destroyer. The sailors
were wearing helmets and gas masks and carrying rifles and clubs.
</P>
<P>
   Patzert stopped his engine. The second British destroyer rammed
the Paducah, and sailors leaped to its deck.
</P>
<P>
   ``Using their clubs as flails, they knocked down several of the
men and boys standing there,'' Patzert wrote. ``From the deck of
the destroyer, a young sailor turned a hose on us. I was ready to
brace myself against a stream of high-pressure water, but something
else hit me _ tear gas.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I grabbed my throat and eyes,'' he continued. ``A woman
alongside me threw her shawl over her child's head, hugging him to
her, the tears flowing down her contorted face. A soldier with a
Sten gun, his face hidden in a grotesque gas mask, strode down the
deck.''
</P>
<P>
   After the British captured the Paducah, the ship was rerouted to
Cyprus, and Patzert, his crew and all the passengers were interned
in tents and Quonset huts. They were to remain there for two years.
</P>
<P>
   The British also had held captured German soldiers there. ``The
German POWs had better accommodations,'' Patzert told his wife. He
said his time in British captivity was the ``hardest two years of
my life.''
</P>
<P>
   Eventually, the Paducah's passengers made their way to Israel,
and Patzert returned to his home in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Rabbi Marvin Hier, the dean and founder of the Simon Wiesenthal
Center in Los Angeles, an institution that commemorates the
Holocaust, said: ``Captain Patzert is among the rare breed of men
not of the Jewish faith who risked their lives in an attempt to
bring Holocaust survivors to the Jewish homeland. He then shared
their plight when interned.'' In 1997, Patzert was honored by the
Museum of Tolerance, which is part of the Wiesenthal Center.
</P>
<P>
   Patzert had written in his memoir: ``It seemed to me that I was
discovering what it meant to be a Jew. Now, I, too, was a Jew and,
by God, we would pound and pound on the closed doors until we
crashed them open.''
</P>
<P>
   Rudolph Ward Patzert was born in New York City, but his family
soon moved to Florida. In 1928, at age 17, he read that Adm.
Richard E. Byrd was planning to take several Eagle Scouts with him
on an expedition to Antarctica. Patzert mailed his Eagle Scout
badge to the admiral.
</P>
<P>
   Byrd returned the badge and explained that he had all the cabin
boys he could use. But the young Rudolph began a romance with the
sea that would last the rest of his life. After his return from
Cyprus he commanded oil-drilling ships for Global Marine, retiring
in 1983.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to his son Bill, of Sierra Madre, Calif., he is
survived by his wife, Theresa, of Encinitas; another son, Andrew,
of Mount Clemens, Mich.; four grandchildren; and five
great-grandchildren.

   DEAR DIARY:
</P>
<P>
   Ever wonder if anyone pays close attention to the announcements
we've heard hundreds of times on flights? If my experience on a
Continental Airlines flight from Gatwick to Newark this month is
any indication, the answer is ``probably not,'' because I think I
was the only one who laughed at the following:
</P>
<P>
   ``Ladies and gentleman, we are now in our final approach. Please
put your seats back in the upright position and stow your tray
tables. The flight attendants will shortly be passing through the
cabin one last time, so please pass any unwanted trash, cash or
jewelry to the end of your row to be collected.''

   I was walking by those great giant legs of the World Trade
Center this morning and it dawned on me what I'm actually going to
remember most about New York City when I'm living out in the burbs
five years from now doing the wife and mommy thing.
</P>
<P>
   It's not going to be those monstrous Darth Vader-looking Twin
Towers that I walk under every day or the Empire State Building or
Statue of Liberty. Not even Central Park. It's going to be the
millions and millions of dried-up, flattened globs of gum that
people have hurled all over the sidewalk. No matter where you go _
Upper East Side, West Side, you name it _ just look down and you'll
see these black spots glued to the sidewalk, like flattened
quarters left on a railroad track.

   Connie Layman, who lives in Malvern, Pa., was crossing Seventh
Avenue en route to lunch and a Broadway matinee with friends when a
gust of wind blew her new felt hat directly into the path of an
ambulance. The hat landed about a foot from the vehicle's front
wheels and Layman knew that if the ambulance didn't hit it, another
vehicle coming along would, and the hat would become a pancake. She
was already mourning the hat, a gift from her husband, when she
noticed the ambulance was at a standstill and the driver was
motioning her to come over and rescue her headgear. Traffic behind
the ambulance came to a stop and Layman ran out onto the road to
retrieve her treasure. She's already planning a return trip to what
she now terms ``your great city.''

   It was a warm, humid winter day and Steven Metzger had a choice
of seats on a muggy but not-too-crowded M104 bus. The window next
to his first seat choice wouldn't open so he moved to the next seat
and that window also wouldn't budge. After a third try, he realized
none of the windows would open and asked the driver why that bus
had only inoperable windows. He was told that the windows were
sometimes ``pinned'' closed by the powers that be. Annoyed but
challenged, Metzger examined the window handles and realized there
was a small screw in the center. Unscrew it slightly and the window
would open. He's now added an appropriate small tool to his
briefcase to control his ventilation destiny. As he left the bus,
the driver was smiling and motioned to his own wide open window.

   DEAR DIARY:

   I named the squirrel Fifi. She had to be French the way she
scooped the discarded baguette from the snowbank, then scurried up
the tree. Her winter coat made her blend in with the bark, and
because of this, the bread looked as if it were climbing the trunk
by itself. Fifi hauled the baguette to a cross branch and began
eating. The loaf was much larger than she, and crumbs fell as she
nibbled. Soon dozens of sparrows arrived as well as a few pigeons.
They enjoyed a pique-nique right on Fifth Avenue, on a wind-chilled
February morning.

   DEAR DIARY:
</P>
<P>
   As a child in New York in the early part of the century, I
learned to read by spelling out the headlines of amusing ads.
</P>
<P>
   I was intrigued with subway cards featuring among other things:
a bald man with the lament ``Too Late for Herpicide,'' a little red
devil with a pitchfork called Peter Pain who was foiled by
Unguentine, a parrot speaking for a handkerchief product saying
``You Can Teach a Parrot to Say `Just As Good' But He Won't Know
What He's Talking About.''
</P>
<P>
   Billboards, too, clutter my memory. They included such gems as
Fisk Tires showing a yawning little boy proclaiming ``Time to
Retire'' and Morton Salt and a girl with an umbrella advising
``When It Rains, It Pours.'' Then there was a smiling chef for
Armour Ham calling it ``The Ham What Am'' and Heckers Flour asking
``Eventually ... Why Not Now?''
</P>
<P>
   I remember, too, the jingles _ ``Our furniture is always the
best, you furnish the girl, we'll do the rest'' and the billboards
such as ``Watch the Fords Go By.''
</P>
<P>
   All this seemed so much fun to me that I resolved when I grew up
that I'd become an advertising copywriter. So I did.

BRITISH COLUMBIA`S PREMIER-ELECT WEDDED TO SOCIAL JUSTICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOEL CONNELLY  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER _ Ujjal Dosanjh was born in a village of India's
Punjab, spoke not a word of English until he was a teenager and
worked as a night watchman cleaning conveyor belts at a sawmill
after emigrating to Canada in 1968.
</P>
<P>
   Later this week, the noncharismatic, soft-spoken yet iron-willed
51-year-old attorney general will be sworn in as premier of British
Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   Just as Washington made history in 1996 by electing the first
Asian American governor in the mainland United States, British
Columbia will become the first Canadian province to have a premier
of Asian descent.
</P>
<P>
   ``I intend to run a government where people enjoy working with
each other. ... It will definitely not be Clark style,'' said
Dosanjh, referring to the headstrong Premier Glen Clark, whose
resignation Dosanjh helped bring about in August.
</P>
<P>
   During the past 30 years, British Columbia has voted three
premiers out of office. Four others have resigned under ethical
clouds or facing defeat at the polls. In British Columbia, as
former Premier Mike Harcourt is fond of saying, politics is a blood
sport.
</P>
<P>
   Dosanjh appears serene at taking a post that has devoured his
predecessors. He is a man who experienced political beatings in his
first two races for the B.C. Legislature, as well as a brutal
physical beating. In 1985, Dosanjh was repeatedly struck on the
head with an iron rod in the parking lot outside his law office.
The beating came after he had spoken out against Sikh extremism in
the Indo Canadian community.
</P>
<P>
   Dosanjh, who has served as provincial attorney general since
1995, was elected leader of British Columbia's governing New
Democratic Party Sunday at the conclusion of a raucous three-day
convention. Under a parliamentary system, the governing party's
leader becomes premier.
</P>
<P>
   Dosanjh won the leadership of British Columbia's governing party
Sunday 769-549 over B.C. Agriculture Minister Corky Evans on the
first ballot at the party's leadership convention. He will likely
be sworn in Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   The premier-elect confronted head-on the New Democrats' loss of
popularity in the wake of confrontational predecessor Clark. He
promised ``less confrontation and more cooperation'' in the
often-raucous B.C. Legislature and ``a government you can
respect.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I have listened to you and learned from you of our
government's shortcomings,'' Dosanjh said in a speech directed over
the heads of convention delegates to the province's voters.
</P>
<P>
   Healing old wounds
</P>
<P>
   Dosanjh and his advisers promise early initiatives to heal
cross-border wounds caused by Clark, who feuded with the governors
of Washington and Alaska, and tried to throw the U.S. Navy out of a
torpedo testing range in the Strait of Georgia.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would hope we would get him down to meet with Governor Locke
soon: We need to repair the damage done by Clark,'' said Harcourt,
a top adviser to Dosanjh.
</P>
<P>
   But the New Democrats must heal wounds of their own that first
opened last summer as the party split over Clark's leadership and
efforts to oust him. ``There is bad blood: There are different
camps,'' said Dave Haggard, president of the International
Woodworkers of America and a convention delegate.
</P>
<P>
   Dosanjh will take on a formidable job in repairing party
fortunes, and relations with other governments.
</P>
<P>
   ``My style is different; when the style is different, it leads
to a different substance,'' Dosanjh said in an interview. On the
eve of his election, the premier-to-be washed the breakfast dishes
before settling into a bicultural living room full of books and
momentos of India and British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   During the prolonged U.S.-Canada Pacific salmon dispute, Clark
feuded with Canada's federal government as well as the governors of
Washington and Alaska. British Columbia was excluded from
negotiations that produced a final settlement.
</P>
<P>
   According to one Washington state official who has worked with
him, Dosanjh is the antithesis of the strident, in-your-face Clark.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a guy who believes in partnership. He's a gentleman
who's very understanding of how something they do up there impacts
Washington state,'' Attorney General Christine Gregoire said.
</P>
<P>
   Gregoire has worked with Dosanjh on issues ranging from drug
smuggling along the Interstate 5 corridor to trans-boundary
telemarketing scams. She predicts ``a real good relationship''
between the state and province after the tumult of the Clark era.
</P>
<P>
   Locke similarities
</P>
<P>
   Dosanjh will find some similarities with the son of immigrants
from China who serves as governor of Washington. Like Gary Locke,
Dosanjh has risen in a political culture that a century ago sought
to exclude Asian immigrants from full rights of citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is not perceived as Indo Canadian; he is perceived as a
Canadian success story,'' said Harcourt, who appointed Dosanjh
attorney general.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is a Sikh, active in his religion and community (but) he is
Canadianized,'' Harcourt said. ``He stood up against bringing
conflicts from the Indian subcontinent to Canada and was assaulted
for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dosanjh's success is not an isolated case. Immigrants from China
and India sit in both the British Columbia and Canadian cabinets.
Canada's governour-general, Adrienne Clarkson _ its ceremonial
chief of state _ came to Toronto as a little girl as her parents
fled the World War II Japanese occupation of China.
</P>
<P>
   ``Canada has been a magnet for people from poorer countries who
have the drive and ambition to want to improve their lives. This is
how leaders emerge,'' Raymond Chretien, Canada's ambassador to the
United States, reflected during a Seattle visit last week.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas Berger, a former British Columbia Supreme Court justice
and longtime friend, describes Dosanjh as ``a remarkable man'' of
quiet demeanor but unshakable resolve.
</P>
<P>
   ``I remember him being interviewed on TV in the hospital after
his beating,'' Berger said. ``He said straight out, `I don't care
what they do. I'm going to go right back out there and take the
same stand.'''
</P>
<P>
   Charges were brought, but nobody was convicted in the attack.
</P>
<P>
   Wedded to social justice
</P>
<P>
   Dosanjh has been a somewhat controversial presence even in the
no-holds-barred field of British Columbia politics.
</P>
<P>
   He is wedded to what he calls ``the goals of social and economic
justice which this movement (the New Democratic Party) is all
about.''
</P>
<P>
   Dosanjh had his start in politics organizing farm workers. He
still proudly carries a union card as a member of the International
Woodworkers of America. His wife, Raminder, is an outspoken
feminist. He strongly backs his party's commitment to gay and
lesbian rights, and active prosecution of hate crimes and hate
speech.
</P>
<P>
   Aside from his advocacy of lengthy prison terms for violent
crimes, Dosanjh does not bother with conservative soundings. He
defends the New Democrats' record of generous funding for health
and post-secondary education. In power for eight years, the party
has yet to produce a balanced budget.
</P>
<P>
   ``He is further to the left than Glen Clark. ... He is a very
left wing social reformer and very redistributive, a believer in
taxing the rich,'' said John Twigg, a onetime New Democrat turned
conservative Victoria-based columnist.
</P>
<P>
   He also has engendered bad blood among some New Democrats, for
it was Dosanjh who effectively brought down Glen Clark.
</P>
<P>
   In August, Dosanjh revealed to the New Democrats' legislative
caucus, and then to the public, that Clark was under criminal
investigation for his alleged involvement in a friend's casino
license application. The disclosure forced Clark to resign.
</P>
<P>
   Inter-party battle
</P>
<P>
   Former B.C. Premier Dave Barrett, a revered elder among many New
Democrats, has bitterly denounced Dosanjh in party circles. Barrett
has argued that the disclosure shrouded Clark in the presumption of
guilt, unfairly and unjustly forcing him from office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I beg to disagree,'' Dosanjh said. ``The criminal justice
system must not only function correctly but be seen to function
correctly. It was important, in the public interest, that
information be shared with the public.''
</P>
<P>
   Clark worked behind the scenes to derail Dosanjh's campaign for
the premier's office. The result, leading up to the weekend
convention, was an intra-party feud that may have jeopardized what
small chance the New Democrats have of holding onto power. A
provincial election must be called within the next 16 months.
</P>
<P>
   Dosanjh's disclosure of the investigation has been fiercely
defended by reformers in the New Democratic Party.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had a public duty. As a citizen, I had as much right to
this knowledge as Dosanjh did, and he gave it to me,'' said Tom
Perry, a Vancouver physician and former provincial cabinet
minister.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt is acid in describing Clark, the party colleague who
succeeded him as premier. ``Glen Clark was the author of his
misfortune,'' he said. ``Ujjal Dosanjh acted entirely properly.''
</P>
<P>
   Dosanjh's campaign for the premiership also generated
controversy by signing up thousands of Indo Canadians as newly
minted New Democrats. An internal party audit found that more than
1,000 of the new members have been improperly signed up, in some
cases without their knowledge.
</P>
<P>
   The membership controversy provided ammunition for the
opposition Liberal Party and for the Vancouver Sun. The province's
largest newspaper campaigns relentlessly against the New Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   Dosanjh will get no honeymoon in the premier's office. ``After a
flurry of self-congratulation, the media will go on the attack and
so will the opposition parties,'' Berger predicted.
</P>
<P>
   Harcourt, an ally, forecasts no more than a 10 to 20 percent
chance that the New Democrats will win a third-straight term in
power. About the only asset the party has going for it is the
unpopularity of the Liberals' stuffy leader Gordon Campbell.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a huge challenge,'' Harcourt said. ``The realistic goal
is to avoid political oblivion and live to fight another day as an
opposition party. But if Ujjal Dosanjh shows a clear break with the
Clark regime _ and brings back people we alienated _ there's a bare
chance.''
</P>
<P>
   In a county thousands of miles from the land of his birth,
Dosanjh has succeeded beyond the wildest dreams of most immigrants.
</P>
<P>
   ``It bodes well for an increasingly multicultural, caring and
compassionate society,'' he said. ``It fills me with hope for the
future.''

CANDIDATES SLING MUD IN MICHIGAN 
</HEADLINE>

 c.2000 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ The bitterness that seeped into the Republican
presidential battle in South Carolina threatened to envelop its
Michigan counterpart as John McCain accused front-runner George W.
Bush of being more impostor than reformer.
</P>
<P>
   McCain, who finds his campaign on the ropes after losing to Bush
in South Carolina on Saturday, accused Bush of trying to co-opt the
reform mantle he has so carefully cultivated.
</P>
<P>
   ``If he's a reformer,'' McCain said while campaigning in
Michigan, ``I'm an astronaut.''
</P>
<P>
   Bush did his best to avoid mentioning McCain during the day, but
fired back when told that the Arizona senator had challenged his
reform credentials.
</P>
<P>
   ``It sounds like Senator McCain spent a lot of time talking
about me, and what I want to do is talk about where I want to lead
the country,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Bush again accused McCain of trying to tar him with comparisons
to Bill Clinton, which he called an unpardonable sin in GOP
politics.
</P>
<P>
   ``That may be okay in a Democratic primary, but that's as low as
it gets in a Republican primary,'' Bush said.
</P>
<P>
   Each candidate spent the day criss-crossing the state in a
furious attempt to get out the vote before Michigan's primary on
Tuesday. McCain is once again banking on a heavy turnout among
independents and Democrats who are permitted to vote in the
Michigan GOP electon.
</P>
<P>
   For Bush, the key will be to bring out conservative Republicans,
something he did in South Carolina.
</P>
<P>
   `Anytime you lose one, you need to win one, and I think we need
to win one now,'' said state Sen. Joe Schwarz, R-Battle Creek, one
of McCain's state chairmen. ``I expect the stops to be pulled out
here on both sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Most recent polls show that Michigan is up for grabs. A
``Detroit Free Press'' survey conducted just before the South
Carolina primary had McCain clinging to a two-point lead over Bush.
</P>
<P>
   But Bush arrived here from the Palmetto State riding a wave of
momentum, and benefits from the presence of a large paid staff and
healthy advertising campaign. McCain has mostly had to rely on free
media and an army of 2,000 volunteers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're going to carry Michigan,'' Bush told reporters before
ducking into services at the Central Wesleyan Church in Holland,
Mich. ``I feel confident of that.''
</P>
<P>
   If Bush has anything to overcome, it could be the trail of
personal ties he left behind in South Carolina, where he was
criticized for visiting the Bob Jones University, a school that has
a reputation for its anti-Catholic bias and race-based policies.
</P>
<P>
   On Sunday, Rep. Peter King, a New York Republican, defected from
Bush's campaign and threw his support to McCain, in part because of
Bush's decision to deliver a speech at the South Carolina
university.
</P>
<P>
   Bush grew testy in response to questions about the reasons for
King's defection, noting to reporters at one point, ``My little
brother Jeb is Catholic.'' &UR; Roman
 &UR; Catholics are the largest denomination in
 &UR; Michigan.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain expected to win his home state of Arizona, most eyes
are on Michigan and its rich payoff of 57 delegates. If McCain
loses again, even his supporters concede it will be difficult to
recover.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is no doubt it's critical, but I think he's going to
win,'' Schwarz said. ``Demographically, this is a good state for
McCain. It's the first state that's a real slice of life. It's the
first state that has a lot of caucasian ethnics and it's the home
of the Reagan Democrats.''
</P>
<P>
   Those Reagan Democrats have been the target of an advertisement
paid for by Jeffrey Fieger, the lawyer for assisted suicide
advocate Dr. Jack Kevorkian. Fieger also was the 1998 Democratic
candidate for governor.
</P>
<P>
   In the ad, Fieger urges Democrats to come out and vote against
Michigan Gov. John Engler, a Bush supporter, and Bush himself,
calling them ``dumb and dumber.''
</P>
<P>
   The McCain campaign has disavowed the ad, but Bush nevertheless
sought to use it as evidence that Democrats are trying to
infiltrate the GOP election.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is nothing I can do about that except this,'' Bush told
about 300 supporters at Detroit's Lawrence Technical School. ``We
can rally our friends and neighbors. We can rally our kinds of
folks to go to the polls to say to Kevorkian's lawyer, `You're not
going to get to pick who the nominee of the Republican Party
is'.'' &QL;

<P>
   ``ACTUAL INNOCENCE'' &QL; 
By Barry Scheck, Peter Neufeld and Jim Dwyer (Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In our rush to convict violent criminals and offer justice to
their victims, it's easy to overlook the plight of the innocent
man. Today, DNA tests are used before trial. Of the first 18,000
test results at the FBI and other crime laboratories, at least
5,000 absolved suspects of guilt before their cases were tried. But
what about men who were convicted before DNA testing was common
practice? Lawyers Scheck and Neufeld are founders of the
``Innocence Project,'' which fights for DNA tests for men who are
in prison. The authors present case after case in which bad
lawyering, police misconduct or false testimony by witnesses
resulted in the conviction of innocent men on rape or murder
charges. Although the book is at times overly dramatic (Dwyer, who
writes for the ``New York Daily News,'' refers to ``Barry and
Peter'' as if they are superheroes, swooping in to save the day

   ``MIRTH OF A NATION'' &QL; 
Edited by Michael J. Rosen (HarperPerennial, $15) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Far be it from us to make jokes at Yanni's expense, but we're
willing to laugh if someone else steps up to the plate. In this
case, it's ``New Yorker'' writer Kurt Andersen, who presents
himself as the man who invented Yanni _ the hair, the name
(``Zazu'' and ``Yahweh'' were contenders), the waterbed smile.
Andersen is one of 54 humorists who contribute to this anthology of
funny writing. Among the others: Roy Blount Jr., on the game of
golf (the first time he saw himself hitting a golf ball on video,
he looked exactly like a man killing a snake); Christopher Buckley
on the art of name-dropping; Garry Trudeau, who admits, copiously,
that he has smoked marijuana; Ian Frazier, who visits upon his
children the laws of the home (``Bite not, lest you be cast into
quiet time . . . '') and Dave Barry on his visit to Paris, where
there was only one empty parking space and it was under heavy
police guard at the Louvre museum. This volume is the first in a
series. Rosen invites you to submit work for future installments. &QL;

   ``WILD MINDS: WHAT ANIMALS REALLY THINK'' &QL; 
By Marc D. Hauser (Holt, $25) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Anyone want to guess what that fine gentleman on the cover was
thinking when someone snapped his picture? Hauser, psychology
professor and head of an animal-research program at Harvard
University, delves into questions that have already spawned many
books and much speculation: Are animals capable of experiencing th
same emotions that we feel? Do animals simply follow rules, or do
they understand those rules and their purpose? Hauser calls
accounts of weeping elephants and altruistic dolphins ``wildly
speculative,'' as faulty as the scientific belief that animals are
``mindless and irrational, driven by instinct and overwhelmed by
their passions.'' He explores such ``animal'' behavior as making
tools, counting, calculating distance, communicating and
cooperating with others, showing compassion, and making and abiding
by rules. In the process, he discusses what sets humans apart from
other animals _ their mysterious awareness of self. We will never
understand animals, he says, until we stop trying to see ourselves
in them. &QL;

   ``LOSING YOUR PARENTS, FINDING YOUR SELF'' &QL; 
By Victoria Secunda (Hyperion, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Secunda interviewed 94 men and women who during their adulthoods
experienced the deaths of one or both parents. In the process, she
discovered that ``parental death is a defining event for adult
offspring that, with regard to its impact on one's sense of self,
often eclipses the variables of marital status, career achievement,
being a parent oneself, or the cause and manner of parental
death.'' In other words, it matters, and in many different ways.
Some people feel a sense of euphoric relief when their parents die.
Others feel lost, with no one to talk to or impress. Some find that
their marriages or their relationships with their siblings are
enhanced after a parent dies. For others, those ties deteriorate.
Secunda's book is not perfect (it begins with a bit of baggage, an
overlong description of her terrible relationship with her mother),
but it is interesting in the shared experiences she discovered
among the subjects of her survey _ experiences not of grief, but of
the long-term consequences of an inevitable and life-altering
event. &QL;

   ``ACTUAL INNOCENCE'' &QL; 
By Barry Scheck, Peter Neufeld and Jim Dwyer (Doubleday, $24.95) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In our rush to convict violent criminals and offer justice to
their victims, it's easy to overlook the plight of the innocent
man. Today, DNA tests are used before trial. Of the first 18,000
test results at the FBI and other crime laboratories, at least
5,000 absolved suspects of guilt before their cases were tried. But
what about men who were convicted before DNA testing was common
practice? Lawyers Scheck and Neufeld are founders of the
``Innocence Project,'' which fights for DNA tests for men who are
in prison. The authors present case after case in which bad
lawyering, police misconduct or false testimony by witnesses
resulted in the conviction of innocent men on rape or murder
charges. Although the book is at times overly dramatic (Dwyer, who
writes for the ``New York Daily News,'' refers to ``Barry and
Peter'' as if they are superheroes, swooping in to save the day
with their test tubes), it is a sobering reminder of the forgotten
victims of violent crime. &QL;

 &UR; RETRANSMITTING IN CASE YOU MISSED THIS. ALSO MOVING IN ``A''
CATEGORY) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   PHOENIX _ Arizona's early Republican primary has thrust the
Grand Canyon State into the national limelight, but it almost
didn't happen.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, the primary's fate dangled by a single thread in the
Legislature. The deciding vote was held by Sen. Jim Buster, a Yuma
Republican who was playing brinksmanship to save an environmental
bill from a veto.
</P>
<P>
   But the primary had friends, and Buster soon found out how
powerful they were. Near the end of the session, he was summoned
from a meeting and told that Sen. John McCain was calling _ from
North Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think it was THAT important,'' Buster recalled. ``But
apparently he thought it was.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years before McCain himself would seek the nation's highest
office, he and then-Gov. Fife Symington wanted an early primary.
Both men supported Sen. Phil Gramm of Texas and wanted to give him
an easy win.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, the best-laid plans of senators and governors often
go astray, and the primary was no exception. Gramm's presidential
bid fell apart before he reached Arizona.
</P>
<P>
   McCain quickly switched his support to the eventual nominee,
Sen. Bob Dole, but millionaire publisher Steve Forbes won the
primary. In the end, most of Arizona's delegates went to Dole after
Forbes dropped out.
</P>
<P>
   All in all, the primary still accomplished its goal, said former
state Sen. Stan Barnes, who sponsored the legislation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted to be the New Hampshire of the West,'' Barnes said,
``the first Western state to come off and make a difference. And
you know what? We are.
</P>
<P>
   ``Arizona is a big factor in the selection of the next president
of the United States, and as an Arizonan, I like that.''
</P>
<P>
   This time around, the Arizona primary, which is Tuesday, has
lost some luster, because South Carolina comes just three days
before, and Michigan is on the same day. On the positive side, the
state hosted two GOP debates this cycle, which never would have
happened without a primary.
</P>
<P>
   With the GOP field narrowing to three candidates _ McCain, Texas
Gov. George W. Bush and conservative pundit Alan Keyes _ the
dynamics have changed. Bush can simply write off a McCain win to
Arizona being that it's McCain's home state and keep gearing up for
Super Tuesday (March 7).
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Mike Hellon, Republican national committeeman for
Arizona, said other states have tried to steal Arizona's thunder.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the whole impetus behind the aborted effort to have a
Western regional primary among the Rocky Mountain states,'' Hellon
said. ``They're all very jealous of the attention that Arizona is
getting and they want to jump in on top of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Much of the credit for the primary goes to Barnes, now a
lobbyist for energy and mining interests.
</P>
<P>
   Barnes shepherded the primary bill through the Legislature,
watching it die not once but twice. Democrats, forbidden by party
rules to participate in an early primary, attacked the bill with a
vengeance, and a few moderate Republicans joined them.
</P>
<P>
   They argued that the primary was too expensive _ it ultimately
cost the state $2 million _ to be limited to one party.
</P>
<P>
   With that kind of rhetoric, the primary bill would have gone
down a third time without some serious lobbying _ such as McCain's
phone call from Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Under serious pressure, Buster decided to dicker with Symington,
who vetoed Buster's environmental bill anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Later, in an internal memo obtained by ``The Arizona Republic,''
a Symington aide poked fun at Buster, now a lobbyist for the state
Department of Environmental Quality.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buster should get the tough-guy award for his suicidal
negotiating style,'' Symington aide Chuck Coughlin wrote. ``You
need to be aware in the future that his style is to take you to the
edge and then jump off, hoping to catch a branch on the way down.''
Buster's leap notwithstanding, Barnes said there was little doubt
that McCain and Symington made the difference, although others had
agitated for a primary for years. An Arizona primary law was passed
in 1992, but it was vague on the date and had other technical
problems.
</P>
<P>
   With McCain and Symington behind an early primary, Barnes said,
``you had the political will to finally get it done.''
</P>
<P>
   ``That is not to say that it was done for Phil Gramm,'' he
added. ``That has never been true. However, the folks who wanted
Gramm to succeed also wanted an early Arizona primary.''
</P>
<P>
   Arizona is a wonderful environment for coincidence.
</P>
<P>
   McCain wasn't through tinkering with the primary. Last year, his
operatives lurked in the background as a bill popped up late in the
legislative session, seeking to move the primary back into March,
after Super Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   To McCain's opponents, the strategy was obvious: save McCain
from expending critical resources to defend his home state from a
George W. Bush incursion. A number of state Republicans rejected
the move, saying it would forfeit the spotlight that Arizona had
gained.
</P>
<P>
   Sen. Marc Spitzer, R-north-central Phoenix, supported moving the
primary to the same day as city elections _ March 14 _ to
consolidate the process and save money. But it was not to be.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the primary replaced an old-fashioned caucus system, in
which delegates were elected by party activists. That process
marginalized Arizona, because the state convention was held in May,
long after the heart of primary season.
</P>
<P>
   ``The old way was more insular,'' Hellon said. ``You had to be
more of an insider to participate. I think on balance we're
probably better off the more we open up the system.''
</P>
<P>
   In the old system, more than 1,000 delegates went to the state
convention, where they voted for about three dozen delegates, who
would attend the national GOP convention. The delegates campaigned
based on which presidential candidate they supported.
</P>
<P>
   The internecine warring made for some tense standoffs.
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, House Minority Leader John Rhodes, an Arizonan who
supported Gerald Ford, was slated to be chairman of the national
convention. But he had no support from state Republicans, who were
lined up behind Ronald Reagan.
</P>
<P>
   As a result, Rhodes almost received the ultimate snub for a
powerful congressman _ not being elected a delegate from his own
state.
</P>
<P>
   ``We weren't going to (elect him),'' Hellon said. ``But the
national Reagan campaign said he's going to control the gavel at
the convention, so we can't have him (ticked) off. You have to
elect him a delegate.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1988, the state party made headlines by electing as a
delegate former Gov. Evan Mecham, who had been impeached and
removed from office just a month before. The move came over the
objections of Sen. Barry Goldwater.
</P>
<P>
   Hellon said there were advantages to the old system.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who are making the decisions, they typically know
more about the candidates,'' Hellon said, ``and from a political
standpoint, they make more informed decisions and are not as easily
influenced by short-term passions or media.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, all of Arizona's delegates are committed to the candidate
who wins Tuesday's (CQ: FEB. 22) primary. The delegates are back in
play if the winning candidate drops out before the convention.
</P>
<P>
   Despite all the attention, there's a more pragmatic reason for
state Republicans to want a presidential primary. It makes money
for the party _ about $100,000 in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the candidates come in and all the news people come in, so
now we have a good reason for them wanting to come in,'' said Dodie
Londen, former chairman of the state GOP. ``Every party needs money
in order to operate for the rest of the year.'' &QL;

<P>
   DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. _ Honestly, Dale Jarrett said, he did not
know what to expect from his hastily repaired Ford stock car in the
season-opening Daytona 500.
</P>
<P>
   No, Jarrett said, he did not lie to trusted friend Mark Martin
about their deal in the draft.
</P>
<P>
   And truth be told, Jarrett said, he could have handled watching
journeyman Johnny Benson Jr. win the so-called Super Bowl of the
2000 NASCAR Winston Cup season Sunday afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``The range of emotions in about a 24-hour period has been
pretty incredible,'' said Jarrett, summing up the storyline of a
Daytona 500 victory that read like pulp fiction. ``This is like, if
you're going to write a script, this is the way to do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Assured by crew chief Todd Parrott that the pole-winning car
dinged up during Saturday's final Happy Hour practice had been made
aerodynamically and mechanically snug Sunday morning, Jarrett began
defense of his Cup championship with two late-race passes worthy of
Daytona 500 legend Richard Petty.
</P>
<P>
   Running third to upstart-leader Benson and Martin on Lap 186 of
the scheduled 200, Jarrett shot under the latter and into second
place in Turn 2 of the high-banked, 2.5-mile trioval. With Benson
bearing down on an improbable victory, Jarrett caught a break when
Michael Waltrip triggered an accident on the frontstretch that
swept up seven cars and brought out the day's fifth yellow flag.
</P>
<P>
   When the race restarted on Lap 197, Jarrett faked a pass high on
Benson through Turn 2 and then cut back down the track and into the
lead with a push in the draft from Jeff Burton. Their battle for
the checkered flag became moot when Jimmy Spencer hit the outside
wall exiting Turn 4 on Lap 198, setting up a white flag/yellow flag
finish and Jarrett's third Daytona 500 victory since 1993.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was an incredible victory because it was a total team
effort,'' said Jarrett, referring to the overtime logged by
approximately 20 crewmen from Robert Yates Racing late Saturday
night and early Sunday. Jarrett was in the final minutes of
practice Saturday afternoon when he got tapped from behind by 1999
Daytona 500 champion Jeff Gordon in a chain-reaction accident.
Jarrett made a great save at speed, but the car suffered
considerable damage to its front and rear aerodynamics.
</P>
<P>
   Parrott had three fabricators flown from Charlotte, N.C., to the
racetrack Saturday night to begin NASCAR-approved repairs. The crew
put on a new left front fender, repaired the nose and right front
fender, hood and tailpipes. Parrott estimated that 35 to 40 percent
of the aero panels on the No. 88 Quality Care Service/Ford Credit
Taurus had been repaired.
</P>
<P>
   ``Robert Yates Racing, there's something about it when you say
Daytona 500,'' said Parrott, who debuted as Jarrett's crew chief
with a victory in the 1996 Daytona 500. ``It's just how bad we want
to win here.''
</P>
<P>
   Jarrett proved to the 43-car field, and the 190,000 spectators,
that the car that had dominated Speed Weeks was still a rocket by
leading 29 laps early and another 56 circuits before halfway.
Martin, the star of Roush Racing's five-car stable, later led 65
laps before Benson, making his debut for carowner Tim Beverley of
Tyler, used a two-tire pit stop to grab the lead on Lap 158.
Benson, driver of the No. 10 Lycos Pontiac Grand Prix, was leading
a breakaway pack of six cars when runner-up Martin and third-place
Jarrett conspired to push their Fords to the front. Only Martin
said Jarrett reneged on the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got lied to. I just asked to have a chance, and today we had
a chance,'' said Martin, who finished fifth in the No. 6 Valvoline
Ford. ``I did get lied to, but it was a good run.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Jarrett: ``Mark had radioed and asked if he went high would
I go with him, and I said yes. We tried it the lap before that and
didn't get a very good run on Benson. Nothing else was said then.
We came down through the trioval the next time, went into (Turn) 1,
Mark went high, I went into the corner high ... with every
intention of going with Mark. I look in my mirror, and the 99 car
(of Martin teammate Burton) dove to the bottom of the racetrack.
I've gotta protect my position at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't lie to Mark Martin.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition to Jarrett and Burton, Bill Elliott and Rusty
Wallace also freight-trained past Martin and set their sights on
Benson. Waltrip's second wreck in as many days at Daytona then
brought out the yellow that group needed to reel Benson in.
</P>
<P>
   ``On the restart, I knew that was going to be my best
opportunity,'' Jarrett said. ``I faked high and he went up there,
and as soon as I saw him move up the racetrack, I cut dead left.''
</P>
<P>
   Spencer's crash assured the outcome, and allowed Jarrett to
become only the fourth driver to win three or more Daytona 500s. A
second generation champion, Jarrett joined Petty (seven), Cale
Yarborough (four) and Bobby Allison (three) among Daytona 500
elite.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing today was Richard Petty came out, made his way
across pit road, and shook my hand,'' said Jarrett, who scored his
23rd career Cup victory. ``That sent chills up my spine. That says
how special it is to get those three.''

 &HT;     SONICS FOUND RIGHT PERSON TO SWAY PAYTON 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ART THIEL  
 c.2000 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ If you are among the relatively few eyewitnesses to
the Sonics this season _ there is so much empty space in KeyArena
these days that it has drawn the attention of the Hubble telescope
_ your curiosity might have been piqued by the presence of Chuck
Person.
</P>
<P>
   As in: What is he doing out there?
</P>
<P>
   In his 14th NBA season, Person at 35 is the oldest Sonic, and
his game doesn't appear a day older than 50. He's played in barely
half the games, averaging three points in 10 minutes per contest.
The one-time ``Rifleman'' shoots 30 percent from the field,
including just 25 percent from behind the stripe, his one-time
specialty.
</P>
<P>
   At 6 feet 8, he is neither a help on the boards nor in handling
the ball. And defense is for somebody else.
</P>
<P>
   ``My reputation is as a shooter,'' he said. ``But I think I can
do more things to help this team.''
</P>
<P>
   In fact, he is pulling off what has been one of the more
difficult tasks with this franchise over the last decade.
</P>
<P>
   He talks with Gary Payton.
</P>
<P>
   Not at him. Not behind his back. Not against him _ hey, nobody
can do that. It's more productive to shake a finger at a hurricane.
</P>
<P>
   But Person can talk with him, a job almost as hard as trying to
one-up Payton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary is a unique, sometimes puzzling guy,'' Person said. ``He
doesn't let a lot of people close to him. You have to earn his
trust and respect. You have to walk, and talk, where he's been.''
</P>
<P>
   In his 10 years in Seattle, Payton has gone from arrogant rookie
with minimal game to an MVP-caliber star. But the arc has never
been as smooth as it has been for Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson,
Larry Bird, Karl Malone or John Stockton.
</P>
<P>
   Payton can be uncommonly prickly to friends as well as
opponents. His ultra-competitiveness combined with his
self-proclaimed street attitude has often alienated coaches and
teammates. And without a championship as a shield, Payton will
always hear the claim that his approach ultimately will cost him
and his team.
</P>
<P>
   But the circumstances this time around for the Sonics are
different, even unique, in his tenure. The roster was remade in his
image _ younger, faster, shorter, more mercurial. It was remade
with the expectation that he would lead it _ something he had not
done here.
</P>
<P>
   For a lone wolf, it is an awkward fit. Payton would much rather
be the gunslinger than the marshal.
</P>
<P>
   He can say that leading the NBA in minutes played over the last
half-decade should be enough. He can also say that topping the club
in points, assists and steals should also be sufficient.
</P>
<P>
   Good arguments. But the fact is, unless he leads by word and
deed, the Sonics have no shot.
</P>
<P>
   Person is the guy with the brass to tell Payton that the old
Gary won't get it done in some situations, and he can no longer
embarrass himself or the franchise with his tantrums. Person is the
one to remind that the only one left among Shawn Kemp, George Karl,
Tim Grgurich, Nate McMillan, Detlef Schrempf, Sam Perkins or Hersey
Hawkins is Payton.
</P>
<P>
   It's him or close to nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Making the point, however, requires a little shrewdness.
</P>
<P>
   ``The thing is, he's willing to listen,'' Person said. ``He's
still going to be Gary; he's going to rant and rave. But I always
make sure never to tell him something in front of the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``I will pull him aside, maybe during a timeout, maybe before
practice, maybe 11 o'clock at night. But he's willing to listen.''
</P>
<P>
   One of those moments happened during a game in Milwaukee last
month.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gary was coasting,'' Person said. ``I told one of the coaches,
`Gary's struggling. You better get him out.' ''
</P>
<P>
   ``What? You know he'll go off.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I know. I got him.''
</P>
<P>
   Payton was pulled before halftime, and predictably erupted. But
Person pulled him aside.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, `G, if you don't get it together, we can't win.'
''
</P>
<P>
   Payton came out big in the second half, and the Sonics beat Karl
and the Bucks.
</P>
<P>
   Rarely are things so straightforward or productive, because
Payton is still so volatile. Last week, Payton followed up his
career-best 41-point night against Washington with a 4-for-19
stinker against Sacramento. That's what happens when one deals in
humans rather than binary code.
</P>
<P>
   Payton was back in form Saturday night, scoring 14 of his 27
points in the third quarter as the Sonics beat the Celtics.
</P>
<P>
   Much of Payton's leadership has to come away from the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I talk to him about practicing,'' Person said. ``He has to
practice. Sometimes he can start practice, and then sit down. But
this team is so new to each other, Gary has to practice with them
every day in order for things to jell.''
</P>
<P>
   Leadership also includes the small stuff.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've talked to him about bringing up his teammates' names in
the quotes in the papers,'' he said. ``Gary needs to trust and
respect his teammates, and once he mentions them, it gives them a
lift.''
</P>
<P>
   Person has slipped into a role once filled by McMillan, and more
recently by David Wingate, players senior to Payton who worked as
easily with him as anyone can. Some will contend that the Sonics'
biggest personnel mistake last year was cutting Wingate.
</P>
<P>
   Now it's Person who horses around with Payton, or spots a flaw
or suggests a better shot.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always remember something one of my old coaches, Bob Hill,
told me,'' Person said. ``He said you have to make a bad night into
a good night, because the good nights take care of themselves.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the Sonics are so dependent on Payton, if Person can
influence him to turn three bad games into good ones, it can make
the difference between a fourth-place seed in the Western playoffs
and a seventh seed.
</P>
<P>
   It's not the same as hitting the game-winning 3-pointer. But
sometimes its important for the Rifleman to ride shotgun.
