<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen on Hong Kong NPC Deputies' Role (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Qian Qichen today
expressed the hope that deputies from the Hong Kong Special
Administrative Region (SAR) to the Ninth National People's
Congress (NPC), China's top legislature, will contribute more to
the country's reform and development.
</P>
<P>
Qian, also a member of the Political Bureau of the Communist
Party of China's Central Committee, made these remarks during a
panel discussion with the delegation of Hong Kong SAR deputies to
the ongoing NPC session here.
</P>
<P>
Qian said it is of great significance that he was able to sit
together with legislators from the Hong Kong SAR to discuss state
affairs.
</P>
<P>
He noted that under the leadership of the central government
and through joint efforts of the relevant departments and people
from various sectors in Hong Kong, the important historic task of
Hong Kong's return to China has been accomplished successfully.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's smooth return and its continuous prosperity and
stability should be attributed to the firm implementation of the
principle of 'one country, two systems', and will have a
significant impact on the eventual realization of China's
reunification," he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that it is the first time for Hong Kong to send its
own delegation to an NPC annual session.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong is a part of China, and also a special
administrative region that practices a different social system
from other parts of the country. Deputies from Hong Kong and the
interior areas can discuss the country's development strategy from
different perspectives," said Qian.

<HEADLINE> Qian Qichen on Hong Kong NPC Deputies' Role (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Owing to the increased exchanges and closer links between Hong
Kong and the interior areas after Hong Kong's return, Qian said,
deputies from Hong Kong should play a more significant role during
the current NPC session.
</P>
<P>
"Though the development tasks listed in the government work
report don't need to be carried out in Hong Kong, deputies from
Hong Kong can still contribute to the country's development all
the same," he noted.
</P>
<P>
Normal operation of the SAR government, smooth economic growth
and social stability in Hong Kong will all serve as vivid examples
for the success of the "one country, two systems" principle, and
will add impetus to the accomplishment of the great cause of
reunification, he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, the industrial and commercial circles in Hong Kong
can also take an active part in the reform of state-owned
enterprises in the interior areas, he added.
</P>
<P>
He also urged the Hong Kong deputies to play a bigger role in
poverty alleviation and development of education and science and
technology in the interior areas.
</P>
<P>
Qian went on to say that China's development is a powerful
guarantee for Hong Kong's long-term prosperity and stability, and
that the central government has always attached great importance
to the development of the Hong Kong SAR.
</P>
<P>
He pointed out that at present, China has greatly improved its
national strength with a sustained, rapid and sound growth of the
national economy, and that the direct impact of the Asian
financial turmoil on China is very limited.
</P>
<P>
"Therefore, we fully confide in the future development of our
country, as well as in the lasting prosperity and stability in
Hong Kong," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong's prospects are closely related to the future of its
motherland. We hope that you can contribute still more to the
country's reform and development," he concluded.

<HEADLINE> OAPEC Expects Drop in Oil Supply, Demand </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The international demand of
oil will drop by 2.2 million barrels per day in the second quarter
of this year compared with the first quarter to stand at 73.8
million barrels per day.
</P>
<P>
The international oil supply will also be reduced at the same
amount to a total of 73.9 million barrels per day, the Kuwaiti
News Agency quoted a monthly report issued by the Organization of
Arab Petroleum Exporting Countries (OAPEC) as saying Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The report anticipated a demand increase by 1.2 million barrels
per day in the third quarter, and that both demand and supply are
expected to reach 77.8 million barrels per day in the fourth
quarter.
</P>
<P>
The world oil price has declined to a four-year low of 14 U.S.
dollars per barrel in recent months.
</P>
<P>
Oil analysts have attributed the slump to a rise of oil supply,
a warm winter in the northern hemisphere and economic turmoil in
east Asia.
</P>
<P>
The Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries decided last
year to increase the production ceiling by 10 percent, or 2.5
million barrels a day, to a total of 27.5 million barrels per day
starting from January 1.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe to Review Sick Economy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A high level round-table
conference is being planned for late March here to mobilize
efforts to put Zimbabwe's battered economy back on track,
organizer of the conference said Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Center for Economic Research, Analysis and Forecasting
said in a statement that private sector executives, business
development managers, banking executives, leading economists,
consultants, academics, industrialists, senior policy-makers, and
potential and foreign investors would gather to discuss and
recommend immediate solutions to Zimbabwe's current economic
issues.
</P>
<P>
It said, ''to restore sound economic management policies,
there is need for an all-encompassing multi-disciplinary forum
integrating key experts from both the public and private sectors
into an action-oriented partnership with the sole aim of bringing
out solutions which can be implemented immediately.''
</P>
<P>
Stressing that all was not well in the Zimbabwean economy, it
said the country was currently undergoing unprecedented
challenges brought about by serious macro-economic problems.
</P>
<P>
The private sector's entrepreneurial initiatives continued to
be stretched to the limit as companies struggle to keep afloat
faced by low demand, a soaring budget deficit, high inflationary
pressures, high lending rates and an unpredictable currency, the
center said.
</P>
<P>
It said, ''the current economic crisis and the structural
problems in the economy cannot be allowed to continue. A solution
has to be found and it has to be found now. The cost of delayed
decision-making is staggering.'' The conference was scheduled to
open on March 25.

<HEADLINE> Work stay-aways Bad for Zimbabwe: Commerce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Zimbabwe National Chamber of
Commerce (ZNCC) Sunday urged social partners, labor, government
business and civil society to exercise caution on current
national problems to avoid falling into the ''blame-game'' trap.
</P>
<P>
ZNCC President Danny Meyer said national problems required
national solutions or a team with Zimbabwe approach, the Zimbabwe
News Agency Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
Meyer said, ''industrial unrests and stay-aways will undermine
economic activity and cost the country millions of Dollars, and
investor confidence will be undermined.''
</P>
<P>
''Let us lock-in the social gains made since the attainment of
independence in 1980 and build economic growth on the firm
foundation laid,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
The Zimbabwe Congress of Trade Unions organized the March 3
and 4 national stay-away aimed at pressing the government to scrap
the 2.5 percent increase on sales tax and the five percent
development levy.
</P>
<P>
The strike was estimated to have resulted in the country
losing over 700 million Zimbabwean Dollars (40 million U.S.
Dollars).
</P>
<P>
Meyer said a powerful message had been sent to the government
that people were finding it difficult to survive in a high
inflationary environment.
</P>
<P>
Macro-economic stability was being undermined and social
unrest would increase unless the fundamental issues were urgently
resolved, Meyer said.
</P>
<P>
Meyer noted that Zimbabwe had faced many crises, but a
concerted nationalistic and determined collective approach would
once again place the nation back on the path to prosperity.

<HEADLINE> Call for Mugabe to Retire Denounced </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's Harare provincial
leadership of the ruling ZANU (PF) Sunday called an emergency
meeting to reaffirm their loyalty to President Robert Mugabe,
saying they would not support any call for his retirement.
</P>
<P>
The meeting held at the party headquarters in Harare was
attended by about 1,000 people including the top six officials
from each of the districts in the province and local ZANU (PF)
members of parliament.
</P>
<P>
The participants hit out at divisionists within the party's
ranks who were advocating that Mugabe should now step down as
leader of this southern African nation, the Zimbabwe News Agency
Ziana reported.
</P>
<P>
Provincial Chairman of the party Rodrick Nyandoro said the
meeting had specifically been called to discuss "stories
circulating in the press" that Mugabe should retire.
</P>
<P>
"We want to state that we do not accept that the president
should retire before his time is up," he said.
</P>
<P>
Nyandoro added, "Harare Province will support the president
despite the fact that there are certain people who are saying
that he should retire. I want to say that we will support the
president at whatever cost."
</P>
<P>
He also appealed for a change of attitude among party members
in the province, saying it was disheartening to note that
in-fighting and senseless bickering were becoming more rampant.
</P>
<P>
Mugabe has been leader of the country since its independence
in 1980.

<HEADLINE> Southern African Women Miners Association Urged </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Southern Africa's women miners are
considering forming a regional women miners association to
protect the interests of women involved in mining.
</P>
<P>
This followed the successful launching of the Women Miners
Association (WMA) in Zambia and Zimbabwe, and plans were underway
to form similar bodies in Mozambique and Tanzania, the Zimbabwe
News Agency Ziana reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
"The next step will be the formation of a regional women
miners association to which the national associations will be
affiliated," said the Zimbabwe Chamber of Mines in its latest
monthly journal released here Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The development resulted from a study carried out in Zambia,
Zimbabwe and Tanzania which recommended that there should be an
organization which should look after the interest of women
involved in mining.
</P>
<P>
The need for such an organization had arisen because of the
growing number of women miners especially in the small-scale
mining of gold and gemstones and also those engaged in
stone-crushing in urban areas.
</P>
<P>
The Women Miners Association of Zimbabwe had identified a lack
of finance, technical support and skills, as well as a lack of
representation, gender sensitization and donor support as major
constraints to the increased participation of women in mining.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Women Miners Association of Zimbabwe has
succeeded in procuring significant financial support from the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP).

<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- International fraud investigators
are watching for a tidal wave of "dirty" money to flood through
European countries ahead of the single currency.
</P>
<P>
Experts predict that exchange markets will see a surge of
activity as criminals try to offload piles of deutschmarks and
francs before July 2002, when the euro becomes the sole currency
in member countries.
</P>
<P>
The United Nations estimates that there is between 300 billion
pounds and 600 billion pounds of unlaundered criminal money in the
international system, much of it in Europe.
</P>
<P>
Financial Mail on Sunday quoted Chris Duggan, head of the
Financial Investigation Unit at City of London Police, as saying
"Criminals are likely to be pulling their money out of banks and
converting it into property, art and jewellery."
</P>
<P>
It is commonly known that leading sources of dirty cash are the
former Soviet Union, West Africa, the American Mafia and organized
crime rings from certain countries.
</P>
<P>
The National Criminal Intelligence Service in London receives
more than 16000 disclosures of suspicious transactions a year,
four times the number six year ago.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Ethiopian Prime Minister
Meles Zenawi Sunday called on foreign investors to enhance their
investment activities in the African continent.
</P>
<P>
Opening an international conference on trade and investment in
Africa here, Meles said, "more and more African countries are
creating favorable environment for foreign investment. Yet the
response of foreign investors is far from adequate."
</P>
<P>
Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for only 1.5 percent of the flows
to the developing countries between 1990 and 1995, according to
Meles.
</P>
<P>
He told participants that the rate of return on foreign
investment in Africa is among the highest world-wide and the
African continent has embarked on a process of political and
economic reforms which are yielding results.
</P>
<P>
Addressing the two-day forum, Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni also stressed that investment is the shortest route to
development and said Africa is open for foreign investments.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said more and more African countries are
demonstrating commitment to speedy economic development and
liberation of the private sector.
</P>
<P>
He criticized the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the
World Bank for "bad manners", saying they sought to force African
countries to implement structural reforms without trying to
understand the varying African economies.
</P>
<P>
"Aid is a life-support system for something that is already
dead. Aid causes dependency and dependency is slavery," Museveni
lashed out against the west for encouraging dependency in Africa
by continuing to provide aid to "dead economies".
</P>
<P>
A message from United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan was
read at the conference and it expressed the United Nations'
commitment to peace and economic upswing in Africa and called for
increasing flows of investment to the continent.
</P>
<P>
About 400 investors from around the world are attending the
Addis forum and include Government representatives and business
executives from Africa, Europe, the Middle East, Asia and North
America.

<HEADLINE> Greens Say "No" to German Part in International </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Germany's opposition Greens ended a
party congress Sunday after confirming its policy against the
participation of Germany in international peacekeeping operations.
</P>
<P>
The rejection to Germany's role in military missions is
included in Greens' program for the September general elections.
The Greens is seeking to form a leftist coalition with the main
opposition Social Democrats (SPD) to force Chancellor Helmut Kohl
out of power.
</P>
<P>
Moderates among the some 750 delegates attending the party's
three-day meeting in the eastern German city of Magdeburg, feared
that the decision could affect the vote for the party in the
upcoming elections.
</P>
<P>
The decision was made late Saturday night with a majority of
one single vote, showing a severe split in the party on its
foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
The Greens decided to adhere to its principle of objecting to
international military missions to secure peace in crisis zones,
and thus German participation in them.
</P>
<P>
Though Joscher Fischer, the party's parliamentary group leader,
called on all the party members to support the decision, he
himself said the decision has made it unnecessarily difficult for
the party in foreign policy.
</P>
<P>
He meanwhile stressed that this had nothing to do with the
party's governing capability.
</P>
<P>
Fischer, regarded as a realist, is the possible nominee for the
post of foreign minister in a leftist coalition.
</P>
<P>
The Greens' election platform also appeals for reducing to half
the 340,000-strong German armed forces within four years and
abolishing conscription.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, as a long-term goal, the party calls for the
replacement of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) by a
European security system that incorporates Russia.
</P>
<P>
The SPD parliamentary faction leader Rudolf Scharping described
the Greens foreign policy as "absurd". German Foreign Minister
Klaus Kinkel termed it as "highly dangerous", adding that Fischer
has failed to bring his party onto a realistic course.
</P>
<P>
The Greens is the first among Germany's political parties to
come up with an election platform. Analysts believe that the
Greens and the SPD still have much to do to reconcile their
policies in order to form a viable alliance.

<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- France and the United States Sunday
agreed to "act quickly" about the crisis in the Yugoslav province
of Kosovo, but failed to reach a specific common stand on how to
react to the crisis.
</P>
<P>
U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, who arrived in
Paris Sunday from Bonn, discussed with her French counterpart
Hubert Vedrine the situation in Kosovo, on the eve of the meeting
of the six-nation Contact Group on former Yugoslavia to be held in
London on Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We agreed that in Yugoslavia we should act with speed and
severity," said Albright after she met with Vedrine.
</P>
<P>
Vedrine said that the present situation in Kosovo is "grave"
and called for emergency measures to "lock the gears" of violence
and "to find the adequate and lasting solutions."
</P>
<P>
The United States has indicated several times that it would
react resolutely against violent suppression of ethnic Albanians
in Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
During her stop in Rome, the second of her five nation European
tour, Albright said that the United States will not tolerate the
policy of "divide and rule in any part of former Yugoslavia."
</P>
<P>
For its part, France has called for the respect of territorial
integrity of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which is composed
by Serbia and Montenegro.
</P>
<P>
France also has proposed the reintegration of Yugoslavia into
the international community if Belgrade restores the autonomy
statute for Kosovo and if European Union and the Organization for
Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) can re-open their
offices in Pristina, the capital of Kosovo.

<HEADLINE> Museveni Against Division of COMESA </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Ugandan President Yoweri
Museveni said he opposes the division of the Common Market for
Eastern and Southern Africa (COMESA) into north and south.
</P>
<P>
Museveni made the remarks at a banquet given in his honor by
Ethiopian President Negasso Gidada at noon Sunday, the Ethiopian
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president said he does not accept the suggestion
by some people that there should be COMESA North and COMESA
South.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the division of COMESA into north and south
is not the way to consolidate the sub-region's resources and
markets.
</P>
<P>
Museveni said if African states are really concerned about the
creation of an African economic union by the year 2025, then they
should primarily give due attention to the consolidation and
expansion of regional common markets.
</P>
<P>
He said since Ethiopia and Uganda are members of COMESA, they
are entrusted with the task of streamlining COMESA in particular
and other regional organizations in general.
</P>
<P>
Unlike this century which Africans largely spent in struggling
against colonialism and neo-colonialism, the coming new century
should be a period of economic prosperity and political stability
for the people of Africa, he added.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the banquet, Ethiopian President Negasso said in
the past both Ethiopia and Uganda were cited as examples of
hopelessness, frustration, economic decline and instability in
Africa, but currently things have dramatically changed for the
better in both countries.
</P>
<P>
He said apart from striving to enhance their bilateral
relations, Ethiopia and Uganda have also done their best to
promote peace and economic cooperation in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
The Ugandan president is here to pay an official state visit
to Ethiopia upon the invitation of the government of Ethiopia.

<P>
Frankfurt, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive
of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR), arrived
here Sunday for his first official visit to Germany after Hong
Kong's return to China last July.
</P>
<P>
Tung is due to meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl Monday in
Bonn, followed by talks with Finance Minister Theo Waigel,
parliament speaker Rita Suessmuth, as well as Oskar Lafontaine,
leader of Germany's main opposition Social Democrats (SPD).
</P>
<P>
He is also due to meet with German business leaders at the
German Council of Trade and Industry DIHT Monday evening.
</P>
<P>
In Frankfurt on Tuesday, Tung will hold talks with Willem
Duisenberg, head of the European Monetary Institute -- the
forerunner of the planned European Central Bank, as well as
leaders of the Frankfurt bourse and Germany's largest commercial
bank, the Deutsche Bank.
</P>
<P>
The implementation of China's policy of "one country, two
systems" in Hong Kong, bilateral economic relations, the Asian
financial crisis and the planned single European currency, the
euro, are expected to be among the issues to be discussed during
Tung's visit.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong Economic and Trade Office in
Brussels, Germany is Hong Kong's sixth-largest trading partner
last year with a total trade volume of 95.2 billion Hong Kong

<HEADLINE> Arabs Urged to Capitalizing by Ruling on Lockerbie </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Arab League (AL) Secretary General
Ahmed Esmat Abdel-Meguid Sunday called on Arab countries to take
advantage of a ruling of the International Court of Justice on the
Lockerbie issue concerning Libya.
</P>
<P>
"One must capitalize on this decision and add to successes to
the just Libyan case," Abdel-Meguid told the press after a meeting
with the representatives of AL members on an upcoming meeting of
Arab foreign ministers.
</P>
<P>
The world court ruled on February 27 that it has the authority
to decide who should try two Libyans suspected of carrying out the
1988 bombing of a Pan Am jumbo jet over Lockerbie, Scotland, which
killed 270 people.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain insist that the two Libyans should be
tried by either of them. But Libya, fearing that they will not
receive a fair trial, turned down the demand, and asked that the
suspects should be tried by the world court, or in a neutral
country.
</P>
<P>
Hailing the decision of the court as the "first step toward
the settlement of the case," Abdel-Meguid said it should be
followed by "more rounds" to finally get United Nations sanctions
on Libya lifted.
</P>
<P>
Arab countries will coordinate their stances on the issue on
March 15 in Qatari capital Doha on the sidelines of a meeting of
the Organization of Islamic Conference before the U.N. Security
Council meets for the case on March 20.
</P>
<P>
The council will for the first time carry out a comprehensive,
objective, political and legal discussion of the Lockerbie crisis,
Secretary General of the Libyan People's Unity Secretariat Hassuna
Al-Shawesh said.
</P>
<P>
"The council is now aware of the mistake it has made, following
the court decision," Al-Shawesh told reporters after a meeting
with Abdel-Meguid during the day.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. and Britain succeeded in pressing the U.N. Security
Council to approve an air and arms embargo against Libya in April,
1992, for refusing to extradite the two suspects.

PARIS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- French President Jacques Chirac
Sunday called for "an urgent and determined reaction of the
international community" to the crisis in the Yugoslav province of
Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
"Faced with the dramatic degradation of the situation in
Kosovo, the president of the republic and the government call for
an urgent and determined reaction of the international community,"
said a communique issued by the Elysee presidential palace.
</P>
<P>
Chirac said that France can no longer tolerate "a new outburst
of ethnic hatred on our continent" and cannot "accept the gearing
of a civil war which will threaten the stability of the whole
southeast European region."
</P>
<P>
"Apart from the necessary appeals for restraint by the two
sides (Serbs and ethnic Albanians in Kosovo), only a message of
very great firmness, addressed to the Yugoslav authorities and
supported by a project for political solution, can crush this
gears of war and lead to a lasting and fair peace for all in
Kosovo," said Chirac.

<HEADLINE> Russian PM Calls for Lifting Barriers for Russian Goods </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOSCOW, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Russian Prime Minister Viktor
Chernomyrdin Sunday called for lifting all barriers for Russian
goods to the U.S. markets, according to the Itar-Tass news agency.
</P>
<P>
On the eve of departure for a four-day visit to the United
States Chernomyrdin said that "It is difficult for Russian goods
to break through" into the American market sometimes due to
tactless and artificial trade barriers.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Russia and the U.S. should cooperate on equal
terms so that this should be profitable for both sides.
</P>
<P>
According to Chernomyrdin, from the every beginning when the
intergovernment Russian-American commission on economic and
technological cooperation was set up in 1993, the volume of trade
between Russia and the U.S. rose by 50 percent, topping the sum of
seven billion U.S.dollars.
</P>
<P>
The two sides have developed an efficient mechanism of
coordinating work in trade, economic, scientific and technical
spheres, the prime minister said.
</P>
<P>
However, he continued, "the potentials of Russia and the U.S.
do not meet the present level of our trade and economic
relations." "We wait for more active participation of American
investors in the Russian economy," Chernomyrdin said.
</P>
<P>
The Russian Prime Minister will participate in the tenth
session of the intergovernment meetings on Tuesday and Wednesday
in Washington and will hold bilateral meetings with U.S. President
Bill Clinton and Vice-President Albert Gore.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a program of partnership between Russia
and the U.S. in the 21st century is to be hammered out by the
results of the session.

<HEADLINE> Bahrain Sees US Presence for Gulf Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Bahrain said on Sunday that the
deployment of U.S. warplanes in the country is part of their
security arrangements for Gulf security, the official Bahraini
News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
"The (U.S. military) presence is in the framework of security
measures related to the region," Bahraini Minister of State for
Cabinet Affairs Mohammed al-Muttawa said.
</P>
<P>
"The mission and nature of such presence is in the framework of
the arrangements agreed by the two countries under their accord,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The minister denied reports by western media earlier this month
that the deployment of U.S. warplanes is aimed at Iraq, which has
tense relations with Washington due to disputes over U.N. arms
inspections.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. accuses Iraq of not complying with U.N. resolutions
and hiding weapons of mass destruction. Iraq denounces U.S.
manipulation of the arms inspections in an attempt to delay
lifting U.N. economic sanctions against it.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. threatened last month to take military actions
to force Iraq to grant free and unconditional access to
presidential sites suspected of concealing the banned weapons to
U.N. arms inspectors.
</P>
<P>
The Bahraini minister stressed that "the arrangements are based
on mutual understanding and special interests of the two
countries, as well as the interests of the region."
</P>
<P>
"There is no change in this prospect and the two sides will (be
committed) to what they have agreed," he added.
</P>
<P>
Under a defense agreement signed with Bahrain after the 1991
Gulf War which drove Iraq out of Kuwait, the U.S. is stationing 36
warplanes on the Gulf island.

<HEADLINE> Netanyahu Urged to Stop Settlement Activities </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Some 1,500 retired Israeli army
and police officers have petitioned Prime Minister Benjamin
Netanyahu to stop settlement activities for the sake of peace,
Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The officers in the petition urged Netanyahu to "choose peace
with Arabs over the settlements," referring to the government
policies of supporting the expansion of Jewish settlements in the
Palestinian territories.
</P>
<P>
The letter was almost identical to the petition sent 20 years
ago by a group of retired army generals to then Israeli Prime
Minister Menahem Begin when the Israeli-Egyptian peace talks were
stalled.
</P>
<P>
Israel's continued expansion of Jewish settlements is one of
the major obstacles that are blocking the progress in the
Israeli-Palestinian talks.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with Israeli state television Channel I,
Israeli leading peace movement Peace Now's co-founder Amiram
Goldbloom welcomed the retired officers' peace move. He said this
showed that tremendous changes have taken place in the thinking of
Israeli society since the Peace Now movement was created 20 years
ago.
</P>
<P>
But Goldbloom said the current state of peace process was no
reason for the peace camp to celebrate. "The reason that we
can not celebrate now is that we are at a critical moment in the
peace process. We feel that an explosion could erupt at any
moment. We are at a very dangerous point in the peace process,"
he commented on the Israeli-Palestinian peace deadlock.
</P>
<P>
While expressing optimism for achieving future peace in the
region, Goldbloom warned that there could be some bloodshed
unless the Israeli government moves faster to achieve peace with
Arabs.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS to Beef Up Customs Administration </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Heads of customs administrations
of the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) have
called on the 16 member states to post customs valuation officers
as government attaches.
</P>
<P>
In a communique issued at the end of the three-day meeting at
the weekend in Abuja, capital of Nigeria, the customs chiefs said
the deployment would enable the valuation officers to gather data
on the prices of goods for the eventual establishment of a
sub-regional trade data bank.
</P>
<P>
"It will also serve as a way of preventing connivance between
importers and exporters of goods within the sub-region and check
customs fraud," the News Agency of Nigeria quoted the communique
as reporting Sunday.
</P>
<P>
It noted that the modernization of customs administration in
member states has been progressing at a snail speed because of
paucity of funds.
</P>
<P>
The delegates emphasized the crucial role of regional
intelligence liaison officers in the success of custom
administration in the sub-region.
</P>
<P>
They therefore called for regular supply of information and
data by member customs organization to combat money laundering,
currency and drug trafficking and other forms of organized
transnational crime.
</P>
<P>
"The delegates are encouraged to canalized trade routes as a
means of combating fraudulent practices within the ECOWAS
sub-region," the resolved.
</P>
<P>
The communique sought legal backing for the conference and
advised the various customs administrations to find a way of
briefing their governments on the need for legal cover for their
activities.

<HEADLINE> Kuwait Puts Top Condition for Improving Ties With </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Kuwait said Sunday that the
return of the Kuwaiti prisoners of war is the top condition for
improving its ties with Iraq, the former occupier of the tiny Gulf
country.
</P>
<P>
The condition was placed by Kuwaiti First Deputy Prime Minister
and Foreign Minister Sheikh Sabah Al-Ahmed Al-Jaber Al-Sabah at a
press conference in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, at the end of a two-day
meeting of foreign ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC), Kuwait News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
He cited the return of the Kuwaiti prisoners of war (POWs) as
the main condition for dealing with Iraq, saying this "is the most
important issue for every individual in Kuwait."
</P>
<P>
Kuwait has claimed that Baghdad still detains 625 Kuwaiti POWs
and has frequently urged Iraq to release them. But Iraq has said
those POWs were missing during turmoils in southern Iraq following
the 1991 Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
Iraq must acknowledge its responsibility for tragedies,
executions and rapes that occurred during its 1990-91 occupation
of Kuwait, he said, adding that these are also conditions for
improving relations between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"This is the policy of my country, and we have put conditions
for dealing with Iraq..." the minister said.
</P>
<P>
Elaborating further on the conditions for pondering the
possibility of re-establishing ties with Iraq, Sheikh Sabah said
that Iraq must implement all U.N. Security Council resolutions
related to the Gulf War.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope again that the regime in Baghdad would
abide by the Memorandum of Understanding it signed with
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan on February 23 on peacefully
ending the crisis over arms inspections.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers from the six GCC states ended a two-day
meeting Sunday in Riyadh at which they discussed the situation
in Iraq, ties with Iran and the Middle East peace process.
</P>
<P>
The Riyadh-based GCC is a political and economic alliance
which groups Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates,
Qatar, Bahrain and Oman.

<HEADLINE> ECOMOG Reopen Roads to Northern S. Leone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The west African peace-keeping
force (ECOMOG), which overthrew the military junta in Sierra
Leone's capital Freetown last month, has reopened the main roads
from Freetown to the north of the country to civilian traffic.
</P>
<P>
Public buses and other civilian vehicles were seen traveling
along the roads Sunday morning several days after ECOMOG captured
the major towns in the north, the British Broadcasting
Corporation reported.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led sub-regional force now controls most of the
strategic points of the country, apart from some diamond
producing areas in the east.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the force is continuing its mopping up exercise
with the civil militia Kamajors, pursuing the remnants of the
junta forces and their allied Revolutionary United Front (RUF)
rebels, many of whom have reportedly fled to neighboring Guniea.
</P>
<P>
Just Sunday morning a number of the junta members were picked
up by Guinean security operatives in the capital Conakry, while a
senior junta officer has surrendered to the ECOMOG high command
in the Liberian capital Monrovia, the report said.
</P>
<P>
However, the whereabouts of junta leader Johnny Paul Koroma
still remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
While making headway against the retreating junta forces and
RUF rebels, ECOMOG is continuing its efforts to beef up security
in the capital for the return of the ousted civilian government
next Tuesday from exile in Guinea.

<HEADLINE> ECOWAS Urges Deployment of UN Observers in S. </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Economic Community of West
African States (ECOWAS) has urged the U.N. to immediately deploy
an observer mission to work with ECOWAS in preparing for the
return of Sierra Leone's ousted President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah.
</P>
<P>
Chief Tom Ikimi, Nigeria's foreign minister and chairman of
the ECOWAS Committee of Five on Sierra Leone, made the appeal at
the weekend at the end of a visit to the U.N.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi told the News Agency of Nigeria that a U.N. observer
mission would need to work with the ECOWAS peace-keeping force
ECOMOG in the task of military demobilization and re-integration
as well as rebuilding of a new army and security services for
Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The mission is also needed to participate in deciding on what
to do with arms and ammunition seized by ECOMOG as well as
soldiers of the toppled military junta now in the custody of
ECOMOG, he said.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi said his delegation has come to explain to the U.N. the
circumstances that led to the forceful dislodgement of the
military junta of Major Johnny Paul Koroma by ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
"Our visit here was very helpful in getting all members of the
Security Council to understand that it was not ECOMOG that
initiated the use of force, but ECOMOG acted in self defense when
the attack was initiated by the junta soldiers," he said.
</P>
<P>
The visit is also to make the international community aware of
the huge humanitarian problem in Sierra Leone in the aftermath of
its liberation from the junta stronghold, said Ikimi.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi explained that there is now a trust fund for Sierra
Leone, to which the British government has pledged a contribution
of two million Pounds. He said he hopes there will be more
contributions.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi also said the amnesty promised to the toppled junta in
the Conakry agreement could not apply now because the junta has
reneged and violated the accord.
</P>
<P>
Besides, he said the junta now has no leadership with which
amnesty could be discussed.
</P>
<P>
"In my view, they have played high stakes and they have lost
everything," he said.
</P>
<P>
Ikimi, however, said that it is now left to the government of
Kabbah to decide on what to do with the junta members now in
ECOMOG custody.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Reaffirms It Has no Banned Weapons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq does not possess whatever
sort of weapons of mass destruction, a spokesman for Iraqi
Ministry of Culture and Information reaffirmed Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman was responding to the remarks made by the
U.S. ambassador to Kuwait to the effect that Iraqi chemical
weapons and chemical and biological warheads are ineffectual that
he and his embassy staff see no need for acquiring gas masks, the
Iraqi News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
Since they have already known that Iraq's alleged weapons are
ineffectual, then why the Americans sparked the latest crisis over
arms inspections and provoked the horror among the Kuwaitis and
even Americans, the spokesman asked.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. diplomat would not have aired this statement, had he
not been self-assured that Kuwaitis have purchased enough
quantities of masks, paying considerable amounts of money to
brokers, as has been the case with every single arms deal sealed
by Kuwaiti officials," he said.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman said the U.S. administration is accustomed to
making statements about imaginary dangers so as to not only launch
an anti-Iraq propaganda, but also to drain Kuwaitis' money.
</P>
<P>
"The U.S. ambassador's statement is one episode in a
comprehensive U.S. scenario which is being carried out in Kuwait,"
said the spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Before February 23 when Iraq and U.N. Secretary General Kofi
Annan signed an agreement on peacefully ending the crisis over
arms inspection, the U.S. and Britain had threatened to launch
military attack against Iraq if it did not grant full access to
U.N. arms inspectors to the sites suspected of hiding weapons of
mass destruction.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait had bought large quantities of gas masks for its people
as a precaution against a possible Iraqi retaliative attack
on Kuwait.

<HEADLINE> Republicans Differ on Strategy on Clinton </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Republican Senator Arlen
Specter Sunday rebuffed U.S. Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott, by
rejecting his proposal that the Congress censure President Bill
Clinton if he concealed an alleged affair with a former White
House intern.
</P>
<P>
Specter, appearing on "Fox News Sunday," said Lott's plan which
was reported Saturday, would be "a highly political, untoward
move."
</P>
<P>
The senator said, "Congress is not in the business of censuring
the president."
</P>
<P>
He also disagreed with Lott, who called on special prosecutor
Kenneth Starr to wind up his four-year, 40-million-dollar
investigation into the Clintons' Whitewater land deal, which has
been now expanded to cover the Monica Lewinsky matter.
</P>
<P>
Although agreeing that obstruction of justice would be
sufficient reason for impeachment, Specter said the United States
"could not stand the trauma of impeachment," adding he has seen no
clear cut case against the president.
</P>
<P>
Senator Robert Torricelli, a Democrat, said on "Fox News
Sunday" that the three principal players in the alleged Lewinsky
relationship -- the president, Lewinsky and Clinton's close friend
Vernon Jordan -- had presented consistent testimony: no sexual
relationship, no attempt to have Lewinsky deny it under oath and
no effort by Jordan to buy her silence with a job in New York.
</P>
<P>
But Clinton's former White House chief of staff, Leon Panetta,
told NBC's "Meet The Press" the president needed, ultimately, to
explain his relationship with Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
Panetta said, "I think there is going to be a time, sooner
rather than later, when the president has to say to the country
what the situation is."

<HEADLINE> Iraq Slams US Blocking Appointment for a Russian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BAGHDAD, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraq on Sunday attacked United
States "untiring efforts" to hamper the completion of U.N. arms
inspections in Iraq by blocking the appointment of a Russian
deputy to the U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM).
</P>
<P>
Referring to a statement made by U.S. Ambassador to the U.N.
Bill Richardson, an Iraq Radio commentator accused the U.S. of
persisting in maintaining the imbalance of UNSCOM's composition
and giving the preponderance to its own elements.
</P>
<P>
Richardson has said the U.S. will veto a motion to appoint a
Russian deputy chairman of the UNSCOM, should it be referred to
the U.N Security Council.
</P>
<P>
Russia is reportedly seeking the position, which is customarily
decided by the U.N. Secretary General and unnecessary to be
submitted to the Security Council for approval.
</P>
<P>
"Through engaging in activities in a whirl of inspections,
investigations, suspicions and pretext, the U.S. wants to harass
UNSCOM mission to meet its political and espionage ends against
Iraq," said the commentator.
</P>
<P>
He expressed hope that the U.N. secretary general and the
Security Council will obstruct such unbalanced situation from
continuing.

<HEADLINE> Annan: U.S. should Consult with U.N. before Strike on Iraq </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi
Annan said on Sunday that the United States should consult other
members of the Security Council before it could consider to use
force against Iraq if Baghdad fails to comply with U.N.
resolutions on weapons inspections.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. had to strike, I think some sort of
consultations with the other members would be required," Annan
told ABC TV "this Week" program in an interview.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were in contrast with U.S. President Bill Clinton's
assertion that the United States has the authority to strike for
any breach of a deal on weapons inspections, reached by Annan with
Baghdad early this month to avert a looming U.S. air strike.
</P>
<P>
Clinton said on Tuesday that the Security Council's reference
to "severest consequences" in a resolution, which warned Iraq
that it must abide by the Annan deal, sent a clear message to
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"The meaning of 'severest consequences' is clear. It provides
authority to act if Iraq does not turn the committee it has now
made into compliance," he said.
</P>
<P>
But most members of the Security Council, including three
permanent -- China, Russia and France, were opposed to
automatical use of force.
</P>
<P>
Annan said he expected the United States, despite its current
hard line, to consult again with fellow council members before
resorting to force against Iraq.
</P>
<P>
"Even if the U.S. says they can go it unilaterally, you would
recall even on this occasion, they did consult both here and in
capitals," he said.
</P>
<P>
"And I suspect whatever happens in the future, that kind of
consultation will take place," he said.
</P>
<P>
Annan is due to pay a one-day visit to Washington on
Wednesday for talks with Clinton. He had been scheduled to visit
last Monday but postponed the meeting to follow council debate
on the inspections deal he struck in Baghdad.

<HEADLINE> US Envoy Calls for Flexibility in Resolving </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NICOSIA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. Special Coordinator for
Cyprus Thomas Miller has called for flexibility and creativity in
solving the protracted Cyprus problem.
</P>
<P>
Speaking upon his arrival Sunday for talks with two Cypriot
communities' leaders on Cyprus issue, Miller described the Cyprus
problem as one of the world's most difficult problems.
</P>
<P>
The U.S. official reaffirmed U.S. commitment to efforts for a
Cyprus settlement. He said that Richard Holbrooke,
U.S. presidential emissary for Cyprus, "will come here when he
thinks he can make a difference."
</P>
<P>
The U.S. envoy told reporters that the U.S. continues to
support a bi-zonal bi-communal federal solution in Cyprus. "That
is the proposal which is on the table and we are all looking
into," Miller said, stressing that "we do not recognize the north
as a state."
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot-dominated south
and the Turkish Cypriot-controlled north since 1974 when Turkey
landed its troops and took over the northern third of the island
following a failed pro-Athens coup in Nicosia.
</P>
<P>
The Turkish Cypriots declared in 1983 a breakaway "Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus", which was only recognized by Turkey.
</P>
<P>
Miller will meet with Cypriot President Glafcos Clerides
Monday, while on Tuesday he is expected to meet with Turkish
Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash.
</P>
<P>
Denktash refused to meet with European Union External
Relations Commissioner Hans Van den Broek and British Special
Representative for Cyprus David Hannay, who visited Cyprus last
week.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the Cypriot government's decision for the
deployment of S-300 anti-aircraft missiles in Cyprus, Miller said
it is an issue that causes concern to the U.S..
</P>
<P>
He disagreed, however, with the use of pressure against this
decision, but hoped that the Cypriot government "will see that it
is in their interest to review their policies" concerning the
deployment of the missiles.
</P>
<P>
The Cypriot government decided to purchase the Russian-made
missiles early last year, and the missiles are due to arrive on
the island later this year.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has threatened to strike the missiles if they are
deployed on the island.

<HEADLINE> South Korea's Foreign Debts Reduce </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Crisis-engulfed South Korea saw its
foreign debts reduced by 3.2 billion U.S. dollars by the end of
January.
</P>
<P>
The total external debts fell to 151.2 billion from the
previous month's 154.4 billion, said the Ministry of Finance and
Economy, Monday.
</P>
<P>
Last November when the financial crisis erupted, the country's
foreign debts stood at 161.7 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
January's foreign debts included 71.7 billion dollars owed by
domestic financial institutions, 17.8 billion dollars owed by
foreign-bank branches in South Korea, 40.6 billion dollars by
private enterprises and 21 billion by the public sector, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The long-term debts with maturity of more than one year grew
from January's 85.8 billion dollars to 87.2 billion because of
additional funding from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and
the Asia Development Bank, said the ministry.
</P>
<P>
But the short-term debts slid to 64 billion dollars, from 68.4
billion dollars as local financial institutions used relief funds
from the international lenders to repay their most urgent debts.
</P>
<P>
The ministry attributed the drop of the short-term debts to the
successful talks over debt rescheduling with international
financial institutions in New York.

<HEADLINE> Animal ID System in Use By 2000 </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Animal farmers and veterinarians
in six European Union countries will soon be equipped with an
electronic identification system to help monitor the location and
movements of herds of cattle, sheep and goats.
</P>
<P>
The system, to be known as the electronic identification of
animals (IDEA), will first trial in Germany, Spain, France, Italy,
the Netherlands and Portugal by December 31, 2000.
</P>
<P>
The European Commission, the executive agency of the 15-nation
European Union (EU), announced Monday a grant of 10 million ECUs
(10.7 million dollars) toward the 17 million ECUs (18.2 million
dollars) development program that includes nine pilot projects.
</P>
<P>
The IDEA system is based on the use of a transponder implanted
in the animal so as to allow effective monitoring of its location
and movements by a radio frequency.
</P>
<P>
The commission is expected to decide on the possibility of
introducing more electronic identification arrangements following
pilot projects in the six EU countries.
</P>
<P>
The commission has already implemented an experimental project
involving one million animals, according to EU sources.
</P>
<P>
EU scientists are currently researching the transplanting of
transponders, reading systems, transponder breakdown rates,
transponder recovery methods and transmission of information.

<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Tung Chee Hwa, Chief Executive of the
Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) of China, met here
Monday with German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, both of them expressing
full confidence about the future of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Tung, who arrived on Sunday evening, is on his first official
visit to Germany after Hong Kong's return to China on July 1,
1997.
</P>
<P>
He told reporters after the talks with Kohl that they agreed
that strong relations between China and Germany, and that between
HKSAR and Germany, were very important.
</P>
<P>
The two leaders also discussed ways to further strengthen the
commercial ties between Hong Kong and Germany.
</P>
<P>
"Both of us were particularly pleased to note a very high
degree of confidence of German business in Hong Kong after July 1
last year," Tung said.
</P>
<P>
According to German government spokesman Peter Hausmann, Kohl
also voiced his satisfaction about Hong Kong's smooth return to
China, adding that as part of China, Hong Kong would remain an
important partner for Germany.
</P>
<P>
Kohl also expressed his support to further expansion of the
successful bilateral cooperations, especially in the economic
area.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, they talked about the currency turmoil in Asia and
how Hong Kong has managed to cope with it.
</P>
<P>
With its sound economic structure and well-regulated financial
markets, Hong Kong would continue to successsfully overcome the
impact of the Asian financial storm, Tung noted.
</P>
<P>
Before meeting Kohl, Tung discussed the Asian financial turmoil
with leaders of Germany's two leading political think tanks, the
Konrad Adenauer Foundation and the Friedrich Ebert Foundation.
</P>
<P>
Tung expressed his strong belief that the linked exchange rate
of the Hong Kong dollar would stay and that China's Renminbi would
not be devalued.
</P>
<P>
He also called on Germany to take the opportunity and invest
more in Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Moi Blames Clashes in W. Kenya as Politically </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenyan President Daniel arap Moi
said Monday that the clashes taking place recently in Rift Valley
Province were "not tribal but the beginning of a wider scheme to
attain political objectives in favour of certain quarters."
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued in Nakuru, about 165 kilometers
northwest of the capital Nairobi, the president said various
communities in the clash-torn areas of Njoro and Laikipia had no
bone of contention.
</P>
<P>
He noted that victims of the clashes were caught up in mayhem
not preceded by any quarrel or tension, according to a Kenya News
Agency report on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Moi pointed out that 39 Kalenjins and 34 Kikuyus (two tribes
in Kenya) were murdered including three well-known activists of
the ruling Kenya African National Union (KANU) and an Egerton
University lecturer sympathetic to the ruling party.
</P>
<P>
In the case of Laikipia, Moi said, some young people had been
forced to board lorries to go and fight a battle without knowing
its objective.
</P>
<P>
He recalled that the Molo Member of Parliament, Kihika Kimani,
was on record making inflamatory remarks and creating animosity
among different communities in the Rift Valley Province.
</P>
<P>
Moi, who is from the Kalenjin tribe, called on all communities
in the province to understand these evil motives and refuse to be
incited against each other.
</P>
<P>
Following clashes in Njoro, Laikipia and other areas of the
province, which reportedly killed about 80 people, the Kenyan
government imposed a curfew in the clash areas on February 5.
</P>
<P>
The curfew was lifted on March 4 as "the security situation in
the clash-affected areas of Nakuru, Laikipia and Molo has
improved tremendously", said Nicholas Mberia from the Rift Valley
Provincial Commission.

<HEADLINE> Japan, New Zealand Fail to Fix Fishing Dispute </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan and New Zealand on Monday
failed to resolve a dispute over southern bluefin tuna fishing
quotas.
</P>
<P>
But Japanese Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto and his visiting
New Zealand counterpart, Jenny Shipley, agreed to develop "mature
and good bilateral relations."
</P>
<P>
The two leaders said this at a 35-minute meeting Monday, Kyodo
News quoted Japanese Foreign Ministry officials as saying.
</P>
<P>
Negotiations between Japan, New Zealand and Australia on tuna
quotas for 1998 collapsed late last month after Wellington and
Canberra rejected Tokyo's proposal for raising its quota of tuna,
which is popular in Japanese dishes.
</P>
<P>
Shipley, who became New Zealand's first woman prime minister
last December, arrived here Sunday on a four-day visit to Japan.
</P>
<P>
During the meeting, Hashimoto briefed Shipley on Japan's
economic measures taken in response to the Asian economic crisis,
including aid through the International Monetary Fund (IMF).
</P>
<P>
Shipley also expressed concern over the crisis, and agreed with
Hashimoto to promote cooperation through the IMF to resolve the
problem.
</P>
<P>
Earlier in the day, Shipley had an audience with Japanese
Emperor Akihito and Empress Michiko at the Imperial Palace.

<HEADLINE> Agreement on Dangerous Chemicals Trade Expected </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 countries gathered
here Monday for an inter-government meeting which is expected to
conclude a legally-binding convention on international trade in
hazardous chemicals and pesticides.
</P>
<P>
The new treaty will limit the trade in such hazardous chemicals
and pesticides as PCBs, Lindane, Aldrin, Dieldrin and harmful
pesticide formulations including substances like Monocrotophos and
Parathion, according to the United Nations Environment Program
(UNEP) and the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO).
</P>
<P>
The trade in extremely dangerous chemicals and pesticides is at
presenty subject to the voluntary Prior Informed Consent procedure
(PIC) in which 154 countries participate. The PIC is jointly
administered by the UNEP and FAO.
</P>
<P>
Countries agreed during previous negotiations that the
substances subject to the voluntary PIC procedure would be
included in the convention which would require exporters to notify
recipient countries of exports of hazardous substances subject to
national bans or severe restrictions.
</P>
<P>
It is expected that additional chemicals and pesticides will be
added to the PIC procedure. The PIC procedure is already
mandatory in the 15-nation European Union and violators can be
fined.
</P>
<P>
Many chemicals and pesticides are proved to be harmful to
humans, domestic animals and the ecosystem. They may cause cancer
or birth defects, or enter the food chain and accumulate in the
tissues of people and animals.
</P>
<P>
Chemicals such as SG which is still exported around the world
are now known to be carcinogenic.

<HEADLINE> Saudi King Fahd Hospitalized for Health Check </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Saudi King Fahd Ibn Abdul-Aziz
was admitted to hospital in Riyadh Monday for a medical check-up
following a gall bladder infection, a statement released by Saudi
Royal Court said.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Press Agency quoted the statement as saying that he is
undertaking a test for cholecystitis.
</P>
<P>
King Fahd, now 76, suffered a stroke in November 1995 which
resulted in a temporary hand-over of power to his younger
half-brother Crown Prince and First Deputy Prime Minister Abdullah
Ibn Abdul-Aziz.
</P>
<P>
In February 1996, King Fahd resumed activities and received
several visiting foreign leaders. He has been governing the
kingdom, the world top oil producer and exporter since June 13,
1982.
</P>
<P>
So far no detailed reports on the king's health is available.
</P>
<P>
Saudi Arabia is pumping 8.9 million barrels of oil per
day. Any instability or major changes in the kingdom have
traditionally had swift effects on oil prices and energy import
bills of oil-consuming countries.
</P>
<P>
Kuwait News Agency said Kuwaiti Emir Sheikh Jaber Al-Ahmed
Al-Sabah telephoned the Saudi crown prince Monday inquiring about
the health condition of King Fahd.
</P>
<P>
The crown prince assured Sheikh Jaber that the king was in
good condition, according to the news agency.

<HEADLINE> China Stronger in Warding off Economic Ups and Downs </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China has become stronger in
warding off economic ups and downs thanks to five years of
macroeconomic controls, according to a well-known economist.
</P>
<P>
Liu Hong, a deputy attending an ongoing National People's
Conference (NPC) session and director of the State Statistical
Bureau, said today that, economically, China has undergone four
major changes for the better over the past five years, making it
better able to ward off economic ups and downs.
</P>
<P>
The first change, he said, is to have achieved an economic
soft-landing, resulting in high economic growth and low inflation.
</P>
<P>
The second change is an end to shortages of goods on the market
and the emergence of a buyers' market, he said.
</P>
<P>
The third change is a breakthrough in economic restructuring
and the establishment of a new macro-control framework, he said.
He cited the following as evidence: the smooth functioning of new
taxation and fiscal systems, a shift to indirect controls in the
financial sector, the unification of Chinese yuan's dual exchange
rates, and a new pricing system.
</P>
<P>
The fourth change is that China has maintained a rational
foreign debt scale and structure and realized an international
balance of payments, he said.

<HEADLINE> Premier Li Peng Stresses Economic Restructuring </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Premier Li Peng said here today
that economic restructuring will, in a long run, help boost
economic growth, but he reminded officials of preparing themselves
for any difficulties as a result of the reform.
</P>
<P>
The resolution of these difficulties in turn hinges on in-depth
reform and further economic growth, Li said while joining a panel
discussion of deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress
(NPC) from east China's Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
"The tasks in the next five years are arduous as we press ahead
with restructuring state-owned enterprises, administrative
institutions and financial system," Li said. "We should make
concerted efforts to overcome difficulties and score new
achievements."
</P>
<P>
The target of this year is to gain eight percent for economic
growth rate and, more importantly, the quality and efficiency of
the economy must be raised, he said.
</P>
<P>
The readjustment of industrial pattern and product mix should
be beefed up, and investment be channeled into infrastructure
projects. New areas to boost economic growth, such as housing
reform and selling commercial flats, should be expanded, he
said.
</P>
<P>
The rural market has a rather great potential, and production
of commodities to farmers' needs should be developed and expanded,
the premier said.
</P>
<P>
The service trade must be boosted along with the growth of
agriculture and industry, he added, for it can provide more job
opportunities and help improve the quality of people's life.
</P>
<P>
"We should open our country still wider to the outside world
and further promote foreign trade. Although the southeast Asian
financial crisis have created some difficulties for our trade, we
should strive to make it succeed through manufacture and
exporting quality products," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Premier Li encouraged and called on the Anhui people
to work harder still to bring the Huaihe River under permanent
control.

<HEADLINE> Hezbollah Leader Wants Unconditional Withdrawal of Israel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The chief of Lebanon's Shi'ite
Muslim Hezbollah guerrillas, Sheikh Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, said
on Monday that if Israel unconditionally withdraws from southern
Lebanon, Hezbollah will hand over the security of that area to the
Lebanese army.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah made the statement in an interview with the French
daily Le Figaro and in response to an Israeli proposal that Israel
withdraw from southern Lebanon in exchange for resumption of
peace talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
The Israeli proposal has received a cold reaction from France,
which Israel wishes to use as a mediator with Syria and Lebanon
because of Paris's close relationship with these two Arab
countries.
</P>
<P>
Nasrallah said that Israel's proposal itself represents a
victory for the struggle of the Hezbollah guerrillas, because
Israel had abandoned its former stand that it made peace with
Lebanon first and then resumed talks with Syria.
</P>
<P>
"The simple fact that Israel no longer talks about a peace
agreement with Lebanon is in itself a victory for our struggle,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Asked what would happen if Israel unconditionally withdrew from
southern Lebanon's security zone, Nasrallah said: "When that
arrives, it will be normal that the Lebanese army will be
responsible for the security and we will not interfere."
</P>
<P>
He was asked whether Syria -- which wants to link Israeli
withdrawal from southern Lebanon with its withdrawal from the
Golan Heights -- was deliberately using Hezbollah to block Israel
from withdrawing from southern Lebanon first. The Hezbollah
leader said his guerillas were no one's instrument.

<HEADLINE> Fast Economic Development in Ethnic Minority Areas: Deputies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government's strategy
of shifting economic development emphasis to the central and
western parts of the country has accelerated the pace of
development in its five autonomous regions.
</P>
<P>
The import and export volume of the five autonomous regions
reached 6.2 billion U.S. dollars in 1997 and the amount of foreign
funds used in these areas came to 2.57 billion U.S. dollars,
setting a historical record, according to deputies to the Ninth
National People's Congress from these regions.
</P>
<P>
Yun Bu Long, chairman of the people's government of north
China's Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, said his region has
absorbed 240 million U.S. dollars from abroad last year, up 90
percent over the previous year. Its foreign trade volume totaled
1.3 billion U.S. dollars in the same year.
</P>
<P>
Abul'ahat Abdurisit, chairman of the people's government of
Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, said the region has opened 20
ports of entry, attracted a great number of overseas enterprises
and accelerated development of agriculture, oil and
infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, in northwest China, set a record
in foreign investment last year, at 60 million U.S. dollars, up by
41 percent over the previous year, said regional government
chairman Ma Qizhi.
</P>
<P>
The number of foreign-funded enterprises has increased to
500, he added.
</P>
<P>
Gyaincain Norbu, chairman of the people's government of the
Tibet Autonomous Region, said the region sent trade missions to a
dozen countries and regions last year. Its import and export
volume increased by 37 percent to 140 million U.S. dollars.
</P>
<P>
South China's Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region has made rapid
progress in the development of transport, telecom and energy, said
regional government chairman Li Zhaozhou.
</P>
<P>
In the past five years, the region has approved 5,498
foreign-funded projects which absorbed 5.1 billion U.S. dollars
from over 50 countries and regions. Its trade volume totaled 13.68
billion U.S. dollars in the last five years.
</P>
<P>
The five autonomous regions are endowed with rich mineral,
energy and other resources and share 10,000-km-long borders with a
dozen or so countries.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Gives Thumb up for Hong Kong SAR Government (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today
praised the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (SAR)
government headed by Tung Chee-hwa for its wisdom and experience
in dealing with complex situations.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong compatriots are fully capable of governing Hong Kong
well by themselves," said Jiang Zemin, also general secretary of
the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Joining in a panel discussion with Hong Kong deputies to the
Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), in session here since last
Thursday, Jiang said the principles of "one country, two systems,"
and "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" with a high degree of
autonomy are the basic guarantee for Hong Kong's long-term
prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The principles, which conform to the immediate and long-term
interests of Hong Kong as well as the interests of China as a
whole, are a fundamental guarantee for Hong Kong's long-term
prosperity and stability, and also a grand political strategy for
an early reunification of the motherland and a great
reinvigoration of the Chinese nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
The international community was following Hong Kong closely to
see whether it can smoothly return to China before Hong Kong's
return and, Jiang acknowledged, after its return, it has also been
following Hong Kong to see whether it can maintain stability and
prosperity.
</P>
<P>
Since Hong Kong's return to China last July, people in Hong
Kong have lived and worked in peace and contentment and social
order is good. The Hong Kong SAR Region has maintained financial
and economic stability despite the onslaught of the rapidly
sweeping international financial turmoils.

<P>
"Facts since the return of Hong Kong have proved that Hong Kong
SAR government is capable of dealing with complex situation 'one
country, two systems' set forth by Deng Xiaoping, 'Hong Kong
people governing Hong Kong,' and a high degree of autonomy for
Hong Kong are entirely correct," he said.
</P>
<P>
"The Hong Kong SAR government headed by Tung Chee-hwa has
wisdom and is experienced in dealing with complicated situations,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
The great socialist motherland provides a powerful backing for
Hong Kong to maintain its prosperity and stability and overcome
any difficulties and risks, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This should become a basis on which people look at the
situation in Hong Kong, evaluate Hong Kong's strength, and view
Hong Kong's prospects," he said.
</P>
<P>
"Facts after Hong Kong's return also prove that the central
government is not paying lip service to implementing the 'one
country, two systems' principles, and we mean what we say," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"This is not an expedient principle, but a policy that will be
maintained in a long period of time," Jiang added.
</P>
<P>
After expressing the central government's full trust and
support to the Hong Kong SAR, the Chinese president urged central
government departments and provinces, autonomous regions and
municipalities to strictly abide by the Basic Law and render a
full support to the SAR government in performing its duties
according to the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
He congratulated the NPC deputies from Hong Kong for being
elected deputies at the National People's Congress (NPC) with Hong
Kong SAR as an independent constituency after the return of Hong
Kong.
</P>
<P>
The social and political status of the people in Hong Kong has
undergone fundamental changes since its return eight months ago,
he said. Now, they enjoy the democratic rights bestowed by the
constitution and other relevant laws to participate in the
administration of the country, together with people from the rest
of the country, Jiang said.

However, such system does not apply in Hong Kong in accordance

<P>
The Chinese president expressed his satisfaction with the work
of Hong Kong over the past eight months, as a result of a thorough
implementation of the principles of "one country, two systems",
"Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree of
autonomy and the Basic Law.
</P>
<P>
The Hong Kong SAR with Tung Chee-hwa as chief executive has
exercised its effective and fruitful administration over Hong
Kong, he said. The existing social system, lifestyle and laws
remain unchanged. Hong Kong has been operating well and its
prosperity and stability have been maintained, he said.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin lauded the success of the Hong Kong SAR government
for its effective and appropriate measures to resist the impact
of financial crisis in some Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The central government has provided a full support for Hong
Kong SAR in an effort to stabilize Hong Kong's financial market,
he said.
</P>
<P>
By now, Hong Kong has enjoyed currency stability, strict
financial supervision, solid hard currency and ample financial
reserves and smooth market operations.
</P>
<P>
"I hope that Hong Kong is fully capable of overcoming the
temporary difficulty and it will have a better tomorrow,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Turning to economic development in the interior area, he said,
the motherland has achieved rapid economic growth rate and low
inflation with further advances recored in the social productive
force, comprehensive strength and people's improved living
conditions.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Gives Thumb up for HKSAR Government (4) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
President Jiang confides in China's accomplishment of the three
goals in 1998, namely, eight-percent economic growth rate, export
expansion and stable Renminbi exchange rate.
</P>
<P>
To achieve these goals, he said, China must strengthen and
consolidate agriculture as the foundation, explore rural markets,
expand infrastructure investment and accelerate the development of
technological upgrading. Efforts must also be made to boost import
while expanding exports and continuing to seek more foreign
investment, he added.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin also underlined the importance of deepening reform
of the state-owned enterprises and financial structure. These
measures will, beyond any doubt, bring in new opportunities and
favorable conditions for Hong Kong's economic growth and the
economic and social advances in the interior area will provide
a powerful backing to the prosperity and stability of Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Jiang Zemin also called for increasing the awareness of
economic "globalization" after the financial crisis occurred in
some Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
"'Globalization' is the objective trend for global economic
development and nobody can shun it," he said. It is essential to
treat this trend dialectically, and to see both the advantages and
disadvantages of such globalization," he said.
</P>
<P>
"A developing nation like China should be both daring and good
at involving in the international economic cooperation and
competitions under such economic 'globalization'," he said.
</P>
<P>
"We must strive to accelerate China's pace of growth by making
maximum use of both opportunities and advantages to develop ourselves
and become distinctly aware of possible disadvantages and risks and
promptly guard against hazards," Jiang said.

<HEADLINE> Iran Expects 5 Billion Dollars from Non-oil Exports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran has planned to earn 5 billion
U.S. dollars from non-oil exports during the coming Iranian fiscal
year starting on March 21, the Iranian official news agency IRNA
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
This was announced by Iranian Deputy Commerce Minister Ziaeddin
Shojaie Borhan on Sunday in Shahr Kord, southwestern province of
Chahar Mahal and Bakhtiari.
</P>
<P>
But he did not elaborate on how to achieve the goal.
</P>
<P>
However, head of Iran's Customs Mehdi Karbasian said on Sunday
that Iran's non-oil exports showed a 3.1 percent drop in terms of
value during the first 11 months of the current Iranian year
ending on March 20 compared to the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
Karbasian said that Iran exported 7.78 million tonnes of
non-oil products, earning 2.8 billion dollars, during the 11
months, registering a 23 percent increase in terms of weight,
compared to the same period of last year.
</P>
<P>
He said that hand-woven carpets, chemicals, ferrous products,
pistachio, garments, plastics, shoes, leather and related products
and pickled hides were among the key exports in the period.
</P>
<P>
Iran has been making efforts to promote non-oil exports during
the past eight years. However, strict regulations and complicated
procedures have retarded the growth.
</P>
<P>
To encourage non-oil exports, Iran decided last December to
allow exporters to keep 100 percent of their foreign exchanges
earned from non-oil exports. They were originally permitted to
maintain 50 percent of their revenues.
</P>
<P>
It is believed that the decision will help push exporters to
promote their business.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Premier On Work in Sichuan and Chongqing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng suggested
ideas for economic development in Sichuan and Chongqing at
separate group meetings with deputies to the National People's
Congress, in session here since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan, a big agricultural province, should continue to
develop grain production to ensure a steady increase in its grain
output, he said at a group discussion with NPC deputies from
Sichuan.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, he said, the province should diversify its
rural economy by developing animal husbandry, side-line production
and fisheries.
</P>
<P>
Sichuan should pay attention to the deep-processing of farm
products to increase their added value and increase farmers'
incomes, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This should also be the direction in which township
enterprises should develop," he said.
</P>
<P>
The premier urged governments at all levels to alleviate the
burden of farmers and protect their enthusiasm for farming.
</P>
<P>
Talking about the industrial sector, Li said Sichuan should pay
more attention to efficiency and product quality, launch fewer or
no capital projects but more technical upgrading ones, and
readjust the product mix.
</P>
<P>
At a separate group discussion attended by NPC deputies from
Chongqing Municipality, Li called on people there to arm
themselves with Deng Xiaoping Theory and carry forward the spirit
of hard struggle in achieving cross-century development
objectives.
</P>
<P>
The premier said Chongqing has done fine since it became a
centrally-administered municipality a year ago. "It has had a good
beginning," he said.
</P>
<P>
He said the coming five years will a tough period for Chongqing
since it has to resettle a big number of people affected by the
Three Gorges Project on the Yangtze now under construction.
</P>
<P>
"The success or failure of the Three Gorges Project rests on
the resettlement of affected people, and Chongqing is the key to
making a success of the resettlement program," the premier said.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that Chongqing would do a good job in
this regard to ensure a smooth going for the Three Gorges
Project.

<HEADLINE> Landmine Explosion Kills Eight in Somali Capital </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MOGADISHU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Eight people were killed and
six others were wounded Monday when a landmine exploded near
Halimo Hito area of Karan district here in the Somali capital.
</P>
<P>
According to chief inspector Abdullahi Abdi Baran, the Karan
police station officer in charge, the incident took place when
people attending a large memorial service set on fire a trash
collection site just outside the building so as to kill the nasty
smell of the junk.
</P>
<P>
Just few moments after the garbage started smoking, a large
explosion was heard and suddenly, the victims of the blast were
immediately found lying on the ground, some of them groaning with
pain and a pool of blood near and around them.
</P>
<P>
The victims including four children were immediately rushed to
the Keysaney Hospital run collectively by the International
Committee of Red Cross and the Somali Red Crescent Society for
treatment.
</P>
<P>
Among the wounded, two children are in critical condition as
the explosion mutilated parts of their body.
</P>
<P>
Quite a large number of people including those attending the
memorial service had rushed to help the victims, but very little
they could do, while others who were scared escaped the scene for
safety. A number of militiamen from the Islamic Court of Karan
district rushed to the scene to secure the area.
</P>
<P>
Innumerable land mines and other explosives are believed to be
hidden and scattered in Mogadishu's dozens of heaps of illegal
garbage collection sites created by the civil war.
</P>
<P>
Only three weeks ago, an eight-year-old was seriously wounded
after a device he was playing with exploded, cutting off his arms
and a leg.
</P>
<P>
Elsewhere in the country, outcries of land mine explosions are
heard in the southwestern region of Gedo where the Islamic
fundamentalist group of Al-Itihad militiamen fought with the
Ethiopian national army which invaded the region twice last year.
</P>
<P>
Eight people were killed and more than nine others were
wounded when their vehicles ran over land mines on two separate
occasions in Gedo region late last month.
</P>
<P>
According to statistics released by the U.N. forces operating
in Somalia, more than half a million land mines are believed to
be buried in Somalia by the political factions and the rival
clans in their attempt to consolidate their front lines.

<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Asia Development Forum, a
week-long conference on the on-going East Asian financial crisis
and Asia's development strategies, opened here Monday night.
</P>
<P>
The conference has brought together over 350 government
officials, economists and journalists to discuss East Asia's
development priorities, needed policy reforms and solutions to the
current crisis.
</P>
<P>
In his opening speech, Philippine President Fidel Ramos said
that "just as seismologists learn more lessons from one big
earthquake than from several mild seismic disturbance," the Asian
financial crisis is "a rich resource of lesson" for government
leaders, policy-makers, bankers, and economists.
</P>
<P>
He said that the recent crisis "will not be the last one we
will be facing, but what is important is that we survive and learn
from each new adversity, as well as from each new opportunity that
comes our way."
</P>
<P>
"We can keep the miracle going, even if temporarily impeded.
But if there is anything we should have learned from the East
Asian economic miracle, it is that miracles don't just happen:
they are made -- and not by magic, not by fortune-seeking, but by
decisive measures and visionary but prudent management," he said.
</P>
<P>
The meeting, with the theme of "East Asia: The Unfinished
Agenda--responding to the crisis," is jointly sponsored by the
World Bank's Economic Development Institute (EDI) and the Asian
Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
According to the sponsors, the forum consists of seven
workshops, three plenaries and five special sessions on issues of
emerging social and economic importance for East Asia.

<HEADLINE> Japanese Take Three Golds and Sets World Records </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Japanese Miki Matsue and Wakako
Tsuchida claimed two golds with world records in the ice sledge
racing at the Winter Paralympic Games in Nagano, Japan, on Monday.
</P>
<P>
Japan took the day's best of three golds at the M-Wave, while
the United States, Germany, Austria, Spain and New Zealand
collected two golds in the Alpine skiing at Shiga Kogen.
</P>
<P>
Matsue won her category of the women's 1, 500 meter in four
minutes 23.86 seconds, beating compatriot Yoshie Kanai
convincingly 4:34.43 and Tone Edvardsen of Norway in 4:39.79.
</P>
<P>
Only the three took part in the race but all of them bettered
the old mark of 4:46.16 set by Kanai here in March last year.
</P>
<P>
"I was surprised by the record, because I'd targeted to win
sprint races," The 24-year-old Matsue was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
Tsuchida clocked 3:59.35 for Japan a 1-2-3 finish in her class
of the 1,500m, improving her own record of 4:08.67 set last year.
</P>
<P>
Toshiki Watanabe took the third gold for the host Japan in the
men's 1500m.
</P>
<P>
Germany stayed atop in the medal standings with nine golds, ten
silvers and seven bronzes, ahead of Norway's 9-5-8 and Japan's
8-13-8.
</P>
<P>
The United States were fourth with 7-5-3 thanks to world number
one mono-skier Sarah Will's victory in the women's Super-G and
Greg Mannino's second gold in Nagano in the men's Super-G.
</P>
<P>
Will, who surprisingly failed to defend the downhill title
Friday losing to Kuniko Obinata, beat the Japanese into second for
her third straight Paralympic Super-G gold medal.
</P>
<P>
The 31-year-old American, who hurt her back in a skiing
accident in 1988 and has been paralysed in the legs since then,
clinched two golds in her first Paralympics in 1992 and added the
downhill, super-G and slalom gold medals at Lillehammer, reports
said.

<HEADLINE> Bangladesh to Produce 290 Billion Cubic Feet of Gas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DHAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Bangladesh is expected to produce
more than 290 billion cubic feet of gas in the current fiscal
year, Minister for Power, Energy and Mineral Resources Mohammad
Noor Uddin Khan said here Monday.
</P>
<P>
The majority of gas would be extracted from the seven gas
fields under the Bangladesh Gas Fields Limited, which would supply
more than 220 billion cubic feet of gas this year, the minister
told the Jatiya Sangsad (parliament), the national news agency BSS
reported.
</P>
<P>
The off-shore Shangu gas field, which was to be inaugurated in
April this year, would generate 6.524 billion cubic feet of gas,
while the three gas fields under the Sylhet Gas Fields Limited
would produce 62.694 billion cubic feet of gas, he said.
</P>
<P>
In the 1996-97 fiscal year, some 261 billion cubic feet of gas
was produced in the country.
</P>
<P>
A seismic survey conducted in 1996 said that Bangladesh
abounded in gas, with over 30 trillion cubic feet of reserves, and
the latest seismic survey put the figure at 75 trillion cubic
feet, reports said.

ATHENS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Albanian President Rexhep Mejdani
arrived here Monday and will discuss with Greek leaders the rights
of 300,000 ethnic Greeks living in southern Albania.
</P>
<P>
The three-day official visit to Greece is the first yet by an
Albanian head of state. Mejdani will hold the talks with his
Greek counterpart, Costis Stephanopoulos, and Prime Minister
Costas Simitis.
</P>
<P>
They will also discuss the growing tension in Yugoslavia's
province of Kosovo, where ethnic Albanians comprise 90 percent of
the nearly two million population.
</P>
<P>
Mejdani is expected to be awarded the Medal of the City of
Athens.
</P>
<P>
The two neighboring countries will also sign an educational
cooperation agreement.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Greek-Albanian relations have developed
smoothly with the signing of a number of cooperation pacts and the
assistance offered by Athens in reorganizing Albania's army and
police force.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Athens allowed 300,000 illegal Albanian immigrants
in Greece to register and work there, while Tirana promised to
start Greek language courses in schools for ethnic Greeks in
southern Albania.

<HEADLINE> Proofs Found on Climatic, Geographical Changes In Old Days </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese scientists have discovered
a number of kettle holes in the northern part of the country that
provide evidence of climatic and geographical changes in the past.
</P>
<P>
A group of researchers at the China Academy of Geological
Science discussed the discovery at a seminar here today, where
they said that the nearly 500 kettle holes were found in a
120,000-sq.-km. area in Hebei Province and Inner Mongolia in north
China.
</P>
<P>
They noted the holes can provide a lot of information about
climatic and geographical changes in the distant past, present-day
global changes, and the origin of man, and astronomy.
</P>
<P>
Han Tonglin and Lao Xiong, research fellows with the China
Academy of Geological Science, agreed that the kettle holes were
actually potholes, which serve as a convincing proof of the
existence of glaciers in north China.
</P>
<P>
However, the participants differ about the origin of the caves,
with some saying they were formed by the movement of glaciers one
to two million years ago, while others say they were the result of
strong winds that occurred some 10,000 to 18,000 years ago.
</P>
<P>
They all are saying that further study is needed to find out
how these mysterious holes were formed.

<HEADLINE> Oman Ready to Trim Oil Output </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ABU DHABI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Sultanate of Oman announced
Monday that it was ready to cut oil output to rescue sagging
prices if other world oil producers agree to do so.
</P>
<P>
Oman's Petroleum and Natural Gas Minister Mohammed al-Ramhi
said in a press conference in Muscat, the capital of Oman, that
"Oman is ready to cut its (oil) output if OPEC (Organization of
Petroleum Exporting Countries) and non-OPEC states prepare to
reduce the production by the same percentage," the official Omani
news agency monitored here reported.
</P>
<P>
Al-Ramhi did not disclose how much percentage the non-OPEC
sultanate intends to cut, but he hinted his country will discuss
the issue with other Gulf oil producers at a possible meeting of
the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC).
</P>
<P>
Oman proposed earlier this month the GCC states, which control
more than 45 percent of the world's oil proven reserves, to hold
such a meeting to discuss ways of tackling the slump in oil
prices.
</P>
<P>
The GCC states, namely, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman,
the United Arab Emirates (UAE) and Qatar, have agreed to hold the
meeting, which are expected to take place after all of them review
the achievements of the upcoming OPEC four-man monitoring
committee meeting, the minister said.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's Secretary-General Rilwanu Lukman has invited the group's
11 members to attend the meeting to discuss the current oil
crisis, turning it into a full emergency OPEC conference.
</P>
<P>
Experts doubt that the OPEC meeting, scheduled in Vienna,
Austria, on March 16, would fail to reach any substantial
breakthrough to save the falling prices due to the popular
reluctance of the bloc's members to cut off their output quotas.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's core Gulf states such as Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Kuwait
and Qatar have refused to lead the group in rein in production
and Venezuela, OPEC's biggest quota buster, said publicly it would
not cut output by even one barrel.
</P>
<P>
In the past four months, world oil prices have lost by more
than 30 percent and crashed down to 14 dollars a barrel under
pressure from abundant supplies and declining demand caused by a
mild winter in the northern hemisphere and Asia's economic
turmoil.
</P>
<P>
OPEC's November decision to raise its combined output ceiling
by 10 percent to 27.5 million barrels per day and the
overproduction by some members were widely considered as the two
major culprits leading to the ample supplies.

<HEADLINE> Chinese Urbanites Willing To Pay More For Favorite Brands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A recent survey has found that 46
percent of the residents of the Chinese cities of Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, Wuhan, Chengdu, and Shenyang are willing to
pay more to get their favorite brands.
</P>
<P>
It shows that 51 percent of males from the age of 20 to 29 like
to buy a particular brand of goods even if it costs more, while 38
percent of women from 45 to 54 are willing to buy name brands
that they really like.
</P>
<P>
The Asia Pacific Branch of Ogilvy Mather, which conducted the
survey, did similar studies in Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore,
Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand, the Philippines, and India. They
found that the fondness for name brands among various age groups
in the Chinese mainland ranked fourth or fifth among the nine
countries and regions.
</P>
<P>
The people of Taiwan, India and Hong Kong seem to be the most
interested in name-brand goods and those of Malaysia and Thailand
less so.
</P>
<P>
Miles Young, the president of the Asia Pacific Branch of Ogilvy
Mather, says that an internationally-known brand means a lot but
needs to satisfy consumers as much as possible and set up good
relations with them.
</P>
<P>
For Chinese consumers, a good brand usually means high quality,
good taste, and reliability, according to an official of the
State Technical Supervision Bureau.
</P>
<P>
The official said these qualities can always make for higher
prices, and most Chinese enterprises still have a long way to go
before they can really have reliable products.

<HEADLINE> Asian Crisis Affects World Financial Markets: BIS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GENEVA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The financial crisis in Asia had
important repercussions in international financial markets in the
fourth quarter of 1997, the Basle-based Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) said on Monday.
</P>
<P>
In its regular commentary and statistics on recent developments
in international banking and financial markets, the BIS cited the
following consequences brought about by the crisis:
</P>
<P>
-- The sharp rise in risk premiums and the general flight to
quality affected financing conditions for all but the most highly
rated borrowers, with the result of an abrupt drop in announced
issues of international long-term debt securities -- by almost 30
percent.
</P>
<P>
A sharp increase in repayments led to an even more pronounced
decline in net issuance, including money market paper, by 60
percent, to 66.8 billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
-- The less receptive attitude of international investors which
encouraged lower-rated borrowers to seek alternative sources of
financing in the syndicated loan market.
</P>
<P>
Of note in this respect was the previously accelerating pace of
aggregate international bank lending to Latin American and Eastern
European countries in the third quarter of 1997, as compared with
substantial declines in this business with certain Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
This, together with the limited movements in risk premiums in
the third quarter, suggests that the abundance of liquidity
worldwide and the associated competitive pressures delayed a
reconsideration of exposures until the crisis had become more
widespread.
</P>
<P>
-- Renewed volatility in world currency and equity markets
which revealed highly exposed positions and boosted end-user
interest in hedging products.
</P>
<P>
This contributed to the further recovery of trading on
derivatives exchanges, bringing the turnover of financial
contracts to a near record of 94.2 trillion U.S. dollars in the
fourth quarter of 1997.
</P>
<P>
The heavy losses faced by some intermediaries in Asia also
prompted a broader reassessment of risk management strategies.

restructuring.
</P>
<P>
Joining deputies to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC)

work with official titles unchanged; they will be provided with
vocational training tailored for their particular needs; and
downsizing is for the purposes of strengthening management in
enterprises and optimizing government structure, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that government functionaries, who have good
political quality and professional expertise, are treasures of the
state.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam on Alert for HIV/AIDS </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnamese Deputy Prime Minister
Pham Gia Khiem has called for increased awareness among the people
over the threat of HIV/AIDS.
</P>
<P>
The Vietnam News Agency (VNA) reported Monday that at a national
anti-HIV/AIDS conference in the coastal city of Da Nang last
weekend, Khiem warned of a great threat by widespread HIV/AIDS
infections.
</P>
<P>
Relevant agencies of all levels should promote education
programs to help people realize that nobody was exempted from the
possibility of being infected by Human Immunodeficiency Virus
(HIV), which caused the deadly disease of AIDS, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from raising people's awareness about the disease,
drastic measures should be taken to do away with drug traffickers
and sex workers," Khiem was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam's National AIDS Committee, 3,054 people
nationwide were found to be HIV positive in 1997 alone, almost
two-thirds of the total HIV infection cases discovered in the
previous seven years.
</P>
<P>
The committee also announced that 641 people have died from
AIDS since the first case was identified in Vietnam in December
1990.
</P>
<P>
By the end of February, 8,217 people were discovered to be HIV
carriers and 1,202 of them had developed AIDS.
</P>
<P>
With 2,636 cases, Ho Chi Minh city has the highest number of
HIV/AIDS carriers in the country.
</P>
<P>
Only four northern highlands provinces, Bac Can, Son La, Lai
Chau and Ha Giang are reported to be free from the disease.
</P>
<P>
However, the disease had a sharp rise in Vietnam's northern
provinces in recent months with a majority of new HIV positive
cases being intravenous drug users under the age of 30.

<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Premier Li Peng, in a
meeting with Austrian Vice-Chancellor and Foreign Minister
Wolfgang Schuessel in Beijing this afternoon, said that the visit
will further promote the development of Sino-Austrian ties.
</P>
<P>
He spoke about Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's visit to China in
1993, which was the first by an Austrian Chancellor, and his own
visit to Austria and that by Qiao Shi, chairman of China's
National People's Congress Standing Committee, in 1994.
</P>
<P>
He said he believes that frequent contacts between leaders play
an important role in increasing mutual understanding and bilateral
cooperative ties.
</P>
<P>
He said that China's relation with the EU is good at present
and the two sides have common interest in safeguarding world peace
and stability and economic growth, and that China is ready to
enhance communications and cooperation with the EU.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel expressed his admiration for China's success in its
opening-up and reform policies. He said that Austria, which will
serve as the EU president in the second half of this year, will
support a strategic partnership with China, and that he hopes
bilateral friendship and ties of cooperation will continue.
</P>
<P>
Schuessel arrived in Beijing on March 5 at the invitation of
Vice-Premier and Foreign Minister Qian Qichen. He and his party
visited the Tibet Autonomous Region, Norbulingka, the Potala,
Jokhang Temple, Barkhor Street and Drepung Monastery. While there,

<HEADLINE> Chinese Economist Favors Appropriate Tight Financial Polity </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- An appropriately tight financial
policy is the policy China must keep to for a long period of time.
Thanks to implementing this policy for years, the country has
embarked on the road of healthy economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Jin Xin, a noted economist and a deputy to the on-going Ninth
National People's Congress, made this statement today.
</P>
<P>
In carrying out this policy, emphasis should be placed first on
"being tight" and then "being appropriate" and, otherwise, it is
impossible to solve problems in the economic field, he said.
</P>
<P>
If the policy is too tight and not appropriate, the work in all
economic sectors will be suffocated and this is undesirable, he
noted. the control should be appropriately tight and, by following
this policy, China has achieved a "soft landing" in its economy.
</P>
<P>
The appropriate, tight financial and monetary policy is aimed
to increase revenue and reduce expenditure so as to keep a balance
between the total demand and total supply.
</P>
<P>
A major manifestation of the policy is to control money supply
and investment scale in fixed assets appropriately. In recent
years, many areas in China went in for "big and all inclusive" and
"small and all inclusive" repetitive construction. As a result,
construction if some projects suspended half way, while other
projects had a low efficiency, and this bitter lesson in economic
work should be borne in mind, he said.
</P>
<P>
After years of efforts, China has scored a fairly coordinated
growth rate, maintained its investment at a proper scale and
gradually cut its deficits, and achieving a "soft landing," which
was featured by an annual growth rate of 11 percent over the past
five years and an inflation of 0.8 percent last year, he said.
</P>
<P>
"The state planned to increase the growth rate of investment in
fixed assets by some 10 percent this year. I think this growth
rate could be a little higher," he said.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, Jin called for guarding against the reoccurrence of
repetitive construction, and underlined that investment should be
used to create more wealth and bring about more benefits.

<HEADLINE> New Bougainville Peace Talks Begins in Canberra </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The latest round of Papua New
Guinea's (PNG's) Bougainville peace talks began here Monday with
delegates being urged to quickly build on their historic truce so
the people of Bougainville can immediately see the benefits of
peace.
</P>
<P>
The delegates from all sides of the conflict gathered here to
further develop the historic Lincoln agreement, which ended nine
years of fighting between the PNG government and rebel forces on
the island.
</P>
<P>
The talks were opened by Foreign Minister Alexander Downer, who
told delegates that it was important that they did not let the
momentum for peace lapse.
</P>
<P>
"Unless the people of Bougainville see a peace dividend fairly
soon, it's going to make the whole process of peace a great deal
more difficult to achieve," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"We've committed, over the next few years, 132.4 million
Australian dollar (88.7 million US dollar) assistance for
Bougainville, but it was not for Australia to impose a solution to
the conflict on the people of Papua New Guinea or Bougainville."
</P>
<P>
"It's not for us, as Australians, to tell you what sort of
peace process you should have," Downer said, adding that "it's for
the people of Bougainville to work these things out for themselves
and the less they are hectored and lectured by outside
governments, the more you work things out amongst yourselves, the
better."
</P>
<P>
But Downer pledged Australia's support for the Peace Monitoring
Group, the expected successor to the Truce Monitoring Group, which
has successfully monitored the ceasefire since late last year.
</P>
<P>
"The Australian government has of course played a significant
role in the Truce Monitoring Group, and we're proud to have done
so," Downer said.
</P>
<P>
"We will of course, if asked, be happy to play a significant
role in its successor body, the Peace Monitoring Group," the
minister added.

<HEADLINE> Turkey: Russia Not Excluded From Caspian Project </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Turkey denied Monday that it
intends to exclude Russia from the large-scale Caspian oil
exploitation project.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at the weekly news briefing here, Turkish Foreign
Ministry spokesman Necati Utkan said that the media reports to
that effect were groundless.
</P>
<P>
"We attach great importance to the Russian Federation in the
cooperation concerning the transportation of the Caspian oil to
the Western markets," Utkan said.
</P>
<P>
Foreign ministers and energy officials from Azerbaijan,
Georgia, Kazakhstan, Turkey and Turkmenistan had a meeting on
March 1-2 in Istanbul, the largest city of Turkey, to discuss the
Caspian project.
</P>
<P>
Russia had said that it was astonished by the meeting which
kept Moscow outside the Caspian oil exploitation.
</P>
<P>
Explaining why Russia was not invited to the Istanbul meeting,
Utkan said that the participant countries are those which are
directly involved in the planned transportation route of the
Caspian oil.
</P>
<P>
He said that no concrete results were achieved at the meeting,
apparently trying to appease the angry Russians.
</P>
<P>
"What is import is to closely follow the developments
concerning this project and to see what decisions could be made by
the end of this year," the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
A senior Foreign Ministry official said earlier that Russia
would be invited to a more comprehensive meeting discussing the
oil project, without elaborating.
</P>
<P>
Turkey supports a pipeline that starts from the Azerbaijani
capital of Baku and ends in the southern Turkish city of Ceyhan,
which is fully supported by Azerbaijan and Georgia.
</P>
<P>
The Caspian oil project is of great significance to Turkey, an
energy-starving country which has to import oil and natural gas
from neighboring countries to meet its domestic demands every
year.

BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China's Import and Export Bank
will provide the China Great Wall Industry Corp. with billions of
yuan of export credits over the next several years, according to
an agreement the two just signed.
</P>
<P>
The loans will significantly boost Great Wall's move to put a

<HEADLINE> Mandela Could Not Appear in Court: Lawyer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JOHANNESBURG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Lawyers for South African
President Nelson Mandela Monday told the Pretoria High Court that
Mandela could not testify in court Monday as ordered by the court
and applied for the withdrawal of the order.
</P>
<P>
It would not be in the public interest for the president to be
subjected to cross-examination in court on an executive decision,
Win Trengove, lawyer for Mandela, was quoted by South African
Press Association as saying.
</P>
<P>
Mandela said last Friday that he would respect the court order
last month and appear in court Monday to answer questions about
how and why he had appointed a commission to investigate the
running of Rugby by South African Rugby Football Union (Sarfu).
</P>
<P>
Sarfu is seeking a court order to set aside Mandela's
appointment of the Browde Commission, saying that Mandela did not
apply his own judgement when appointing it.
</P>
<P>
Trengove told the court that Mandela could not testify because
of circumstances beyond his control, and then brought an
application for the revocation of the order.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had already denied under oath charges that he had not
exercised his own judgement in appointing the commission, he
said.
</P>
<P>
"It would not be in the public interest to submit him to
interrogation on unsubstantiated allegations that he is a liar,"
Trengove said.
</P>
<P>
Mandela had certain powers and responsibilities which he had
to carry out in the national interest, and would be stultified
and frustrated in exercising his duties if he had to appear in
person and submit to cross-examination on flimsy evidence on
every executive decision, the lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
Compelling Mandela to testify would also fly in the face of
the doctrine on the separation of the powers of the judicial and
executive branches, he said. A head of state should not be
impaired in conducting his constitutional duties.
</P>
<P>
The order by the Pretoria High Court judge Justice W. de
Villiers last month for Mandela to testify in court had sparked
much controversy in the country.
</P>
<P>
Mandela's lawyers said earlier that Mandela decided to appear
in court because he wanted to honor the court order, although he
was concerned that his appearance would set a precedent through
which executive decisions of the government could become subjects
of lengthy litigation.

He expressed the hope that more cooperation in this field
would be promoted in the future.

<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian stock market
finished in positive territory Monday as resource giant BHP Co Ltd
and most of the major banks made ground and held it in thin trade.
</P>
<P>
The morning started with an early flurry of excitement after
the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 125 points to 8569.39 points
on Friday night.
</P>
<P>
At the close of trade, the all ordinaries index was 13.1 points
stronger at 2680.7 points, off its high of 2689.5 points.
</P>
<P>
"It opened with a bit of a rush on the back of a strong US
market on Friday night, but there wasn't buying to follow that
over and it came back from its highs," broker Philip Toop said.
</P>
<P>
National turnover was 178.44 million shares worth 536.27
million Australian dollars (359.30 million US dollars) with rises
outnumbering falls 487 to 477.
</P>
<P>
The all industrials index was 17.2 points higher at 4589.4
points while the all resources index was 10.7 points firmer at
1159.1.
</P>
<P>
BHP shares, 33 cents stronger at 15.76 Australian dollars,
topped a turnover of 8.12 million shares.
</P>

The resources stocks benefited from stronger metal prices on
the London Metal Exchange with copper surpassing the 1800 US

with National Australian Bank rising 13 cents to 20.18 Australian

<HEADLINE> Australian Dollar Dragged Lower by Asian Currencies </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Australian dollar on Monday
was dragged lower by weaker Asian currencies and concerns about
Indonesia, while the domestic bond market strengthened.
</P>
<P>
The local currency closed at 66.61 US cents, from 66.76 late on
Friday.
</P>
<P>
A foreign exchange trader with Westpac Banking Corporation said
weakness in the Japanese yen and Asian currencies gave the market
an excuse to sell the Australian dollar.
</P>
<P>
The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has delayed payment of 3
billion US dollars in aid to Indonesia until April.
</P>
<P>
The payment, due on March 15, was delayed because of
Indonesia's pre-occupation with politics as it forms a new
government, the IMF said.
</P>
<P>
Market participants are now keenly awaiting the release of
February labor force figures on Thursday by the Australian Bureau
of Statistics.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the Australian dollar ended at 85.31 yen, from 85.03
locally on Friday, and at 1.2190 marks, from 1.2240.

<P>
PARIS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The powerful Communist unionists in
the French automaker Renault are disputing a plan by the group's
management to lay off 2,700 employees this year.
</P>
<P>
The unionists asked the local government of Hauts-de-Seine
prefecture west of Paris, where the headquarters of Renault are
located, to take immediate measures to prevent the group from
implementing the lay-off plan.
</P>
<P>
"Public opinion cannot understand why they continue to
implement the disastrous industrial choices for jobs... and to
waste public money to inflate unemployment while Renault announced
a profit as high as 4.6 billion francs (770 Million U.S. dollars)
in 1997," said the unionists in an open letter to the prefect of
Hauts-de-Seine, Jean-Pierre Richer.
</P>
<P>
A large-scale demonstration was held in Paris on Saturday in
protest of unemployment in France, which stands at 12.1 percent by
the end of 1997.

<HEADLINE> Fate of S. Leonean Coupists in Hand of Civilian </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The amnesty promised by the coup
makers in Sierra Leone under the Conakry peace accord could not
apply because the junta failed to implement it.
</P>
<P>
The fate of them therefore is to be decided by the civilian
government of President Ahmed Tejan Kabbah billed to return from
exile in neighboring Guinea Tuesday, according to Tom Ikimi,
chairman of a sub-regional committee on Sierra Leone.
</P>
<P>
The Committee of Five on Sierra Leone under the Economic
Community of West African States (ECOWAS) signed the agreement
with the junta last October.
</P>
<P>
The agreement provides for immediate ceasefire, disarmament of
combatants in Sierra Leone, the junta's voluntary handover of
power to the Kabbah regime on April 22 and an amnesty for junta
members, among other things.
</P>
<P>
However, according to Ikimi, who is also Nigerian foreign
minister, the ceasefire was later repeatedly violated by the
junta, which was alleged to sign the accord to buy time.
</P>
<P>
Other provisions of the agreement such as disarmament could
not be implemented due to the junta's violation.
</P>
<P>
The ECOWAS peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG then launched
military operations to dislodge the junta in the capital Freetown
last month and later captured other major towns of the country.
</P>
<P>
ECOMOG now also controls most of the country's strategic
points, including some diamond producing areas in the east.
</P>
<P>
Many members of the junta leadership have been held by the
sub-regional force, though the whereabouts of the No. 1 person
Johnny Paul Koroma still remains unknown.
</P>
<P>
As for the fate of the junta members, Ikimi said, "in my view,
they have played high stakes and they have lost everything," the
Daily Times reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
However, the Nigerian foreign minister said, it was now up to
the government of Kabbah to decide on what to do with the junta
now in ECOMOG custody.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Benin Defense Ministers Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Chinese government values
friendship and cooperation with the armed forces of Benin and is
ready to push forward cooperation between armed forces of the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chinese Defense Minister Chi Haotian made the remarks here
today while talking with Severin Adjovi, Benin's state minister in
charge of national defense.
</P>
<P>
Extending a welcome to Adjovi, who is on his third visit to
China, Chi expressed the belief that Adjovi's current visit will
help enhance mutual understanding and promote the further
development of relations between the two countries and their armed
forces.
</P>
<P>
Adjovi expressed his thanks to Chi for sparing time to talk
with him, saying that this symbolizes friendship between the two
countries.
</P>
<P>
Chi told Adjovi that China pays close attention to Africa, and
that developing long-term and all-round relations with the
continent constitutes an important component of China's
independent foreign policy of peace.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government is ready to work with African nations to
advance state-to-state ties oriented with the 21st century, added
Chi, who is also vice-chairman of the Central Military Commission
and state councillor.
</P>
<P>
He also noted that the two countries have engaged in fruitful
cooperation in politics, the economy, trade, and military areas
since the restoration of diplomatic relations 25 years ago.
</P>
<P>
Adjovi told Chi that China has offered all kinds of assistance
to Benin, and that the Benin people are grateful to China for its
assistance in undertaking a host of projects in Benin.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the conviction that the traditional friendship
between the two countries and their armed forces will certainly
continue to grow.
</P>
<P>
Chi and Adjovi also exchanged views on other issues of common
concern.
</P>
<P>
Xiong Guangkai, deputy chief of the General Staff of the
Chinese People's Liberation Army, was present on the occasion.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the talks, Chi presided over a welcoming ceremony in
honor of Adjovi.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria May Respond to U.S. African Peace Force </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria, the regional power in west
Africa, is expected to respond soon to the United States-backed
African peace initiative which was launched in Mali last week,
the Guardian reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria has been seriously opposed to the initiative because
the country had warned earlier that it might trigger another
scramble for the partition of Africa, observers noted.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, Nigeria may pursue its opposition through the
Organization of African Unity (OAU), the leading national
newspaper quoted a source as saying.
</P>
<P>
The effective take-off of foreign military aid for Africa's
conflict resolution may torpedo efforts of countries like Nigeria
which favor the strengthening of OAU's conflict resolution
mechanism.
</P>
<P>
At last month's meeting of OAU Council of Ministers, Nigerian
Foreign Minister Tom Ikimi said his country was not opposed to
foreign initiatives aimed at boosting Africa's conflict
resolution capacities.
</P>
<P>
According to him, Nigeria is only wary of the fact that such
assistance may weaken OAU's efforts by dragging it into
initiatives designed to divide the continent into Anglophone and
Francophone peacekeepers.
</P>
<P>
The minister maintained that in Nigeria's view, all Africa
needs to do is to examine its sub-regional structures for
preventive diplomacy, conflict management and resolution, like
the west African peacekeeping force known as ECOMOG.
</P>
<P>
The Nigerian-led ECOMOG has conducted successful peacekeeping
operations in both Liberia and Sierra Leone, putting an end to
the civil wars which have lasted since 1990 in the two countries.
</P>
<P>
It therefore "has demonstrated beyond any reasonable doubt,
its capacity to maintain peace, security and stability" while
"most of this was achieved without assistance or training from
external sources," Ikimi said.
</P>
<P>
Nigeria's head of state General Sani Abacha earlier suggested
OAU form a regional peacekeeping force with ECOMOG as nucleus.
</P>
<P>
Currently, about 70 American military personnel are in Mali to
carry out a two-month training session of the militaries in that
country.
</P>
<P>
It is seen as part of the U.S.-sponsored African Crisis
Response Initiative, in which three other African countries --
Senegal, Uganda and Mauritania are said to be participating.
</P>
<P>
The training, according to the U.S., is to build an initial
capacity, with the goal being for the battalions to be ready to
be called upon within 30 days "if their countries' leaders
decided that they are going to participate in some peacekeeping
operation".

<HEADLINE> German Consul-General on German-HK Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- German Consul-General Wolfgang
Gerz in Hong Kong has described the visit to Germany by Chief
Executive Tung Chee Hwa of the Hong Kong Special Administrative
Region (SAR) as a proof of the healthy development of relations
between Germany and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local Chinese newspaper Wen Wei Po
before Tung's two-day visit to Germany starting from Monday, Gerz
said good relations between Germany and Hong Kong have been scored
in many aspects.
</P>
<P>
As an important member of the European Union, Gerz said Germany
is Hong Kong's largest trading partner in Europe. "At the same
time, Germany's economic and trade existence in Hong Kong ranks
first among European nations."
</P>
<P>
Gerz said Tung's wide range of meetings with German political
and economic dignitaries in Bonn and Frankfurt will be a proof of
the sound relationship between Germany and Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
Such a good relationship is not merely demonstrated in the
field of economy and trade, but also in the areas of culture,
science and technology, Gerz said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that activities held by the Goethe Institute in Hong
Kong are very enthusiastic, and spectacular German dramas are
performed in Hong Kong's Art Festival this year with simultaneous
dubbing in the German language.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, he said that the vice-president of the German
Academic Exchange Center visited Hong Kong not long ago and signed
a series of agreements for cooperation with several universities
in Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
All these prove that Germany-Hong Kong relations lie on a
healthy and sound basis, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gerz said while Germany-Hong Kong ties are developing smoothly,
Germany has always been strongly confident about Hong Kong's
future.
</P>
<P>
Last October, the German Consulate-General in Hong Kong granted
five-year visa treatment to Hong Kong's frequent business
travelers to Germany, allowing them to stay 90 days at maximum per
half year, he said.
</P>
<P>
Gerz said the German public is following Hong Kong's progress
with great interest after it returned to China last July.
</P>
<P>
He said that Tung Chee Hwa is the most suitable person to give
first hand information to the German public. Not only is he
capable of interpreting the principle of "one country, two
systems", but also of personally briefing on the implementation of
this principle in Hong Kong over the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
"'One country, two systems' is an implementation unparalleled
in the world, whose uniqueness will definitely be interesting to
the European public," he said.
</P>
<P>
Gerz expressed the belief that exchanges between Germany and
Hong Kong cover a wide range of areas.

<P>
LAGOS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The African Development Bank (ADB)
has suspended loan financing for a multi-million-dollar rural
infrastructure project it signed with the Nigerian government in
1989, "This Day" newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The report said the ADB has suspended the project in Enugu and
Anambra states because of the bad financial management and
non-performance of the two state governments and local
contractors.
</P>
<P>
The decision of suspension was conveyed to the Federal
Ministry of Finance recently, said the report.
</P>
<P>
The project was meant to construct 46 water schemes and
provide electricity for 120 towns in the said two states in
southern Nigeria.
</P>
<P>
However, the report noted, the ADB has now found that after
spending 32.62 million U.S. Dollars and an additional 0.94
Deutschmarks, "only one town was electrified" and "none of the 46
water schemes is operational."

<HEADLINE> First HKSAR Budget to Restore Confidence: Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A high-ranking Hong Kong
official said Monday that the Special Administrative Region
(SAR) government, in working out its first financial budget, had
to damp down excessive expectations and at the same time ease
excessive gloom brought about by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
Financial Secretary Donald Tsang delivered a speech Monday on
how he produced the 1998-99 Financial Budget, which he presented
to the Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) on February 18.
</P>
<P>
At a luncheon jointly organized by the American, Indian and
French Chambers of Commerce in Hong Kong, Tsang said that the
conditions in which the Budget was framed were the most complex
for many years because of the Asian financial difficulties, and
enormous expectations built up after the successful transition of
Hong Kong on July 1, 1997.
</P>
<P>
"I had to damp down excessive expectations," said the official,
who believed that the Budget, by itself, would not lift Hong Kong
overnight out of economic worries.
</P>
<P>
He went on: "I also had to deal with another mood, excessive
gloom. ...It is going to be a hard slog this year, but if we keep
our nerve, if we work hard individually, and work hard together as
a community, we will pull through."
</P>
<P>
The financial secretary reiterated Hong Kong's enduring
strength, a free market economy, which he said gives Hong Kong "a
springboard to renewed achievement."
</P>
<P>
The new Budget, entitled "Riding out the storm, renewing Hong
Kong's strengths", has proposed substantial budgetary measures and
 revenue concessions to give more freedom and flexibility to both
individuals and businesses in Hong Kong, to help them adjust to
the change.
</P>
<P>
Tsang stressed the government's role in such areas as education
and environment, but he warned that there was a danger in
encouraging and expecting the government to do too much in other
areas. More government means more taxes and less enterprising
capacity in the economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
Legislators will begin a debate on the Budget
Wednesday.

JOHANNESBURG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Eleven children were drowned
Saturday while trying to cross a swollen river on the east coast
of South Africa, police said Monday.
</P>

The children, aged between 13 and 18, crossed the Umfolozi
River near Ceza and Dlebe villages in north Kwazulu-Natal

</P>
<P>
Nine bodies were recovered and police were still searching for
the remaining two, South African Press Association (SAPA)

</P>
<P>
The ruling African National Congress (ANC) attributed the

MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- President Fidel Ramos Monday hailed
the swift and successful rescue of four hostages on Sunday at a
prison in Davao del Norte province, the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the president condoled with the family of Paulina
Corda, the lone hostage killed in the operation by the kidnappers.
</P>
<P>
Ramos said the rescue operation, which resulted in the killing
of eight abductors, should be a "deterrent lesson" to
hostage-takers.
</P>
<P>
He also ordered Interior and Local Government Secretary Epimaco
Velasco and Justice Secretary Silvestre Bello to conduct a
thorough investigation of the incident to pinpoint responsibility
and prevent similar occurrences in the future.
</P>
<P>
The incident started last Thursday after the eight prisoners
bolted their cells at the prison to take hostage the five women
employees of the jail.
</P>
<P>
The kidnappers were armed with kitchen knives and a grenade
they claimed they bought from a prison guard. They were raided and
killed by anti-terrorist policemen Sunday afternoon.

<HEADLINE> HK Airport Returns to Normal After Weekend Fog </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's Kai Tak
International Airport has returned to normal after clearing a
backlog of flights caused by thick fog over the weekend, a Civil
Aviation Department spokesman said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Airline schedules were back to normal by 3:00 p.m. local time
(07:00 GMT) with the last batch of flights held up over weekend
being cleared, Vincent Kan Pak-kei said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy fog blanketed Hong Kong on Saturday and Sunday, throwing
the airport into chaos and disrupting travel plans of thousands of
passengers.
</P>
<P>
Around 600 flights were canceled, diverted or delayed during
the two days due to poor visibility, with nearly 20,000 passengers
affected, Kan said.
</P>
<P>
"It was even worse than the signal nine typhoon that hit Hong
Kong last year," Kan said.
</P>
<P>
Among those affected was Chief Executive Tung Chee Hwa, whose
flight to Frankfurt was delayed 15 minutes Sunday. He was on a
week-long visit to Germany and France.
</P>
<P>
According to the Hong Kong Observatory, a humid southerly air
stream was wrapping an impenetrable shroud around Hong Kong for
most of the weekend.

<HEADLINE> Nigeria Risks Nation-Wide Blackout </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LAGOS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A nation-wide blackout is imminent
in Nigeria, a leading national newspaper, This Day, repeated the
warning Monday.
</P>
<P>
This is not the first time Nigerian media and industrialists
gave such warnings.
</P>
<P>
According to the latest report, Nigeria's nine power plants
could now generate only 1,925 megawatts of electricity, which is
about 32 percent of their installed capacity.
</P>
<P>
The country's daily peak demand is put at 2,446 megawatts.
</P>
<P>
In managing its thinning resources, the National Electric
Power Authority (NEPA) has been forced to sporadic load shedding,
causing wide and periodical blackout.
</P>
<P>
Equipment damages and non-maintenance have put all the power
stations in a deplorable situation, the report said.
</P>
<P>
In September last year, the Afam thermal power station
exploded due to old age and lack of maintenance. The explosion
damaged the control room and other major equipment, and killed
four engineers.
</P>
<P>
All the other stations are in no better forms. They have
major equipment damages and maintenance has been overdue for
years.
</P>
<P>
Among NEPA's numerous problems, the lack of funds has been
identified as the major difficulty in revamping the power sector.
</P>
<P>
In a report to the Vision 2010 Committee last year, NEPA
estimated that it needs about 63 million U.S. Dollars to overhaul
the system.
</P>
<P>
To solve NEPA's problems and save the power sector, the
Nigerian government has ordered the re-organization of NEPA this
year in preparation for privatization.
</P>
<P>
The assessment of NEPA's assets is already underway as part of
the preparations, a recent report said.

<HEADLINE> China to Complete Iodized Salt Project within Year </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China will complete its iodized
salt project to form an annual production capacity of 8.18 million
tons and abandon manual iodizing and hand-packaging of edible salt.
</P>
<P>
The salt project was approved by China's State Planning
Commission in November of 1996. Fixed-asset investment is
estimated at 693 million yuan, including a loan of 27 million
U.S. dollars from the World Bank and another of 190 million yuan
by China's State Development Bank.
</P>
<P>
Local salt administrations also provided funding valued at 190
million yuan.
</P>
<P>
Salt administrations at all levels will continue to focus on
exercising the salt monopoly this year, and see to it that 95
percent of iodized salt meets quality standards.
</P>
<P>
China has a high incidence of iodine deficiency
disorders. Statistics from the Ministry of Health show 450 million
people are living in areas considered iodine-deficient, accounting
for 40 percent of the world's total.
</P>
<P>
Eighty percent of the 10.17 million mentally retarded people in
China suffer from iodine-deficiency.
</P>
<P>
According to the China Salt Corp., the country is expected to
produce 22 million tons of salt this year, of which 67.8 tons will
be edible salt.

</P>
<P>
ABU DHABI -- The Gulf Organization for Industrial Investments
said the trade volume in 1996 between Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) states and Japan reached 37.5 billion U.S. dollars with
Japan's exports standing at 7.5 billion dollars and imports at 30
billion dollars.
</P>
<P>
Japan's imports from the Gulf Arab states are mainly oil, which
accounts for two-thirds of its total amount of oil import.
</P>
<P>
But a report of the organization shows that Japan's investments
in GCC states for the past half a century do not exceed 0.007
percent of its total investments the world over.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- During a two-day visit to the Palestinian self-rule
Gaza by an Egyptian delegation, the two sides will arrange a list
of goods to be traded between them and determine the amount to be
cut in customs duties according to an agreement signed last month.
</P>
<P>
CAIRO -- In a report submitted to the parliament, Egyptian Oil
Minister Hamdi Al-Banbi said local oil product meets 92 percent of
Egypt's energy needs, accounts for 55 percent of goods export and
10 percent of the gross domestic product of the state sectors.
</P>
<P>
AMMAN -- Jordan has welcomed a decision of the United States to
grant duty-free status to the commodities produced in the Al
Hassan Industrial City in Irbid, northern Jordan.
</P>

The U.S. offer will enhance investment and transfer of technology,
create job opportunities and help achieve growth by increasing the
number of industrial corporations, a senior official of Jordan's
Ministry of Industry and Trade said on Saturday.
</P>
<P>
The move would lead to the immediate opening of new projects

<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Deputy Prime Minister Pham Gia Khiem
has called for increasing awareness among the Vietnamese people
about the threat of HIV/AIDS, the Vietnam News Agency (VNA)
reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Khiem made the call at a national conference to review
anti-HIV/AIDS activities in Vietnam's central coastal city of Da
Nang last weekend.
</P>
<P>
He said awareness should be raised among the Vietnamese people
that there is a great threat of a HIV/AIDS infection in this
country.
</P>
<P>
Education programs should be promoted to help people realize
that nobody is exempted from the possibility of being infected by
HIV (human immune deficiency virus), which causes the deadly
AIDS (acquired immune deficiency syndrome), he warned, adding that
there is not yet an effective medicine to cure the disease.
</P>
<P>
"Apart from raising people's awareness about the disease,
drastic measures should be taken to do away with drug traffickers
and sex workers," Khiem was quoted as saying.
</P>
<P>
According to Vietnam's National AIDS committee, 3,054 people
nationwide were detected to be HIV positive in 1997 alone, making
up almost two-thirds of the total HIV infection cases discovered
in the previous seven years.
</P>
<P>
The committee has also announced that a total of 641 people are
known to have died of the disease since the first AIDS virus
infection was identified in Vietnam in December 1990.
</P>
<P>
By the end of February this year, a total of 8,217 people were
discovered to be HIV carriers with 1,202 of them having developed
into AIDS patients.
</P>
<P>
Ho Chi Minh City has the highest number of HIV carriers and
AIDS patients with 2,636 cases.
</P>
<P>
In recent months, the disease saw a sharp rise in Vietnam's
northern provinces with a majority of newly tested HIV positive
cases coming from intravenous drug users under the age of 30.

<HEADLINE> Vice Premier Stresses Importance of Science and Education </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Vice-Premier Li Lanqing today
urged China's central and western regions to seek economic growth
through developing education and quickly commercializing
scientific research results and newly-developed technologies.
</P>
<P>
Li, also a Standing Committee member of the Political Bureau of
the Communist Party of China's Central Committee, made this
suggestion during a group discussion with deputies from northwest
China's Shaanxi Province to the Ninth National People's Congress,
in session here since last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"The central government has decided to speed up the development
of the central and western regions," Li told the lawmakers, adding
that Shaanxi should make full use of its advantages in science and
technology and its big contingent of skilled personnel to promote
local economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Describing Shaanxi as one of China's leading provinces in terms
of science, technology and education, he suggested the province
further improve its educational level through intensified reforms
of its higher education institutions.
</P>
<P>
"By means of adjustment, cooperation and merger, a number of
universities and colleges with high academic competence should be
established to serve economic development, and a favorable
environment should be created for training a contingent of skilled
personnel with creativity," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say that Shaanxi also has many advantages for
developing agriculture, and that northwestern regions will play a
significant role in China's long-term agricultural development.
</P>
<P>
"We must center on the study of an agricultural mode suited to
northwest China's reality of water shortage, and spare no effort
in developing an ecologically-friendly agriculture that stresses
the preservation of water and soil," he noted.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested Shaanxi make greater efforts to develop
infrastructure and improve its investment environment, to attract
more foreign capital to the province.

BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Following is a brief introduction
to the Beijing-Kowloon Railway, a national key project mentioned
in Chinese Premier Li Peng's government work report delivered at
the First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Beijing-Kowloon Railway, which passed state technical
assessment on November 3, 1997, is China's third north-south trunk
link, the other two being the Beijing-Guangzhou and
Beijing-Shanghai railways.

Track-laying was completed in November 1995.
</P>
<P>
It is playing an important role in accelerating the pace of
economic development in China's coastal, central and eastern

<HEADLINE> Security in Phnom Penh Gets Worse, Says Newspaper </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PHNOM PENH, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Security in the capital city of
Phnom Penh is getting worse with armed robberies, political
murders and terrorism on the rise, the Cambodia Daily reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
A security official in Phnom Penh was quoted as saying criminal
cases were much more than what was reported.
</P>
<P>
Criminal acts took place day and night and everywhere in the
city, the paper said.
</P>
<P>
In a span of seven days, three were killed in a drug bust, two
Funcinpec generals were murdered and a bomb armed was planted in a
sugar-cane cart near the city's central post office.
</P>
<P>
A gunfire in downtown Phnom Penh between Military Police and
anti-drug police, perhaps over recent drug crackdowns, touched off
a week of violence in the capital.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Chan Satum, a Phnom Penh vendor, as saying
that as a result he had to close his small family restaurant at
night, and rely instead on selling fruit during the day.
</P>
<P>
A number of Cambodians interviewed Saturday by the daily said
increased violence in Phnom Penh has raised fears among the city
residents and disrupted their businesses.
</P>
<P>
The violence has made many people doubtful about a free and
fair election scheduled for July.
</P>
<P>
Ung Meng Chou, a teacher from Kompong Cham who is visiting
Phnom Penh, said she is worried that violence will disrupt the
election and ultimately result in a Cambodia losing foreign aid.

</P>
<P>
The 898.7-km Nanning-Kunming Railway runs from Nanning in

southwest China.
</P>
<P>
The electrified railway has designed speeds of 80-120 km per

</P>
<P>
One third of the line runs through tunnels and 90 percent of it
is built on geologically complicated structures.
</P>
<P>

alleviation efforts in southwest China by turning the region into
an important production base for power, coal, steel, gold and
chemicals.

<HEADLINE> Backgrounder: Policy on Protecting Grain Purchasing Prices </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Following is a brief introduction
to Policy on Protecting Grain Purchasing Prices mentioned in
Chinese Premier Li Peng's government work report delivered at the
First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
The Policy on Protecting Grain Purchasing Prices was laid down
by the Chinese Government to protect the interests of farmers in
bumper years. Under the policy, state grain departments are to buy
all the grain that farmers sell to the state at fixed prices.
</P>
<P>
China set a record in grain output in 1984 and 1990
respectively. However, grain growers earned less as grain prices
dropped. Their enthusiasm in growing grain crops was seriously
dampened, resulting in reduced production and production
stagnation in the following few years.
</P>
<P>
The state Council announced the implementment of the Policy on
Protecting Grain Purchasing Prices at a national grain order
placement meeting in February 1993 to prevent the recurrence of a
drop in grain purchasing prices after good harvests and ensure a
steady grain production.

<HEADLINE> GE Confident in Further Investments in Asia Market </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The U.S.-based General Electric
Information Service expressed confidence in the Asia-Pacific
region's electronic commerce market, despite the continuing impact
of the recent financial turmoil.
</P>
<P>
Harvey Seegers, company chairman, recently addressed a
teleconference in Hong Kong, its Asia headquarters, saying that
GE's latest strategy in the region is to further localize
electronic commerce services.
</P>
<P>
Through the six Asian branches, GE is capable of providing
online services of electronic documents such as cargo orders,
invoices and freight certificates with the technology of
electronic data interchange (EDI) in accordance with regional
characteristics, Seegers said.
</P>
<P>
He said GE has worked with the Chinese Ministry of Post and
Telecommunications to set up China EDI and electronic commerce
centers in 13 provinces and cities. Recently, it has teamed up
with Hong Kong-based Skylink to strengthen its presence in China's
market.
</P>
<P>
Electronic commerce is a major Internet service item. EDI
services are catering to an increasing number of enterprises since
they are time-saving and cost-effective. Some insiders predicted
that by 2000, more than 250 billion U.S. dollars worth of business
transactions will be done on the Internet.
</P>
<P>
GE Information Service now has more than 40,000 business
partners worldwide to provide EDI, electronic telecommunications
and Internet services.

<HEADLINE> Local Governments Urged to Stabilize Agriculture Policy </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China must stabilize and implement
the Party's basic policies in rural areas in an effort to go on
reaping consecutive good harvests, said Vice-Premier Jiang Chunyun
today.
</P>
<P>
In a group discussion with deputies from east China's Anhui
Province to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), in session
since last Thursday, Jiang, also a member of the Political Bureau
of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, said good
farm yields depends on the enthusiasm of Chinese farmers.
</P>
<P>
Such enthusiasm hinges on the Party's correct policies in
agriculture and rural work, he said, noting that "farmers are
enthusiastic in farm production when the policies are correct and,
if the related policies are deviated, their morale will be
dampened and their enthusiasm hurt."
</P>
<P>
China has achieved remarkable advances in agriculture
because the Party's basic policies in rural work are correct and
such policies have remained unchanged, Jiang said.
</P>
<P>
He urged local governments to stabilize the current land
contracting policy, alleviate the farmers' burdens and purchase
all the excessive grain that remains unsold and is still stocked
at the farmers' homes at protection prices.
</P>
<P>
He went on to say the central government has announced the
extension of land contracting system for another 30 years, and
added that Anhui, a pioneer province n introducing the land
contract responsibility system, again plays an exemplary role in
the country's second round of land contracting.

<P>
To implement the Party's basic policies in rural work, he said,
rural cadres should be pragmatic, work hard and honestly, solicit
the opinions of farmers and genuinely serve them as their public
servants.
</P>
<P>
"Meanwhile, the masses of farmers do not like these grassroots
officials, who fail to perform their duties in an honest, fair
and down-to-earth manner," he said while urging local officials to
share weal and woe of the farmers and work for their interests
wholeheartedly.

<HEADLINE> NATO Launches Second Trial of Combined Task Forces </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The North Atlantic Treaty
Organization Monday started a two-week exercise to try out its
Combined Joint Task Forces (CJTF).
</P>
<P>
The sea-based trial, codenamed Strong Resolve '98, took place
in Norway, Portugal and Spain including surrounding sea and
airspace.
</P>
<P>
The exercise, according to NATO sources, is a joint and
multinational live-exercise, involving more than 50,000 service
men and women from 15 of the NATO member states and 10 Partnership
for Peace (PfP) countries.
</P>
<P>
Two simultaneous crises are to be tackled in two separate
geographical regions to test the crisis-management capability of
the Western military alliance.
</P>
<P>
The exercise on Crisis South, to be conducted in the
southeastern Atlantic, western Mediterranean and Iberian
Peninsula, is to simulate a peace support operation beyond NATO's
area of responsibility while the exercise on Crisis North, to be
conducted in the northwest of Europe, is to simulate a NATO
territorial defense operation.
</P>
<P>
NATO conducted a concentrated trial on CJTF late last year.
Codenamed Allied Action '97, the land-based, computer-generated
exercise simulated a peace support mission to a make-out peninsula
on the southeastern tip of Africa.
</P>
<P>
CJTF is a multinational, multi-service task force formed by
NATO in order to tackle crises that are beyond the self-defense
responsibility of Article V of the NATO charter.
</P>
<P>
Taking part in the Strong Resolve '98 exercise are the United
States, Canada, Britain, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Belgium,
Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Denmark, Norway, Portugal, Spain and

<HEADLINE> Lawmaker Calls for Protection of the Yangtze </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A legislator from central China's
Hubei Province today called for timely efforts to protect, and
promote a sustainable use of, water resources of the Yangtze
River, China's longest and the world's third longest.
</P>
<P>
"We must bring a clean Yangtze into the 21st century," said Liu
Benren, a deputy to the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC),
China's top lawmaking body, that has been in session here since
last Thursday.
</P>
<P>
According to Liu, who is general manager of the Wuhan Steel
Corporation, the current situation for water quality preservation
along the Yangtze is quite grim, and water areas by cities along
the Yangtze all suffer from varying degrees of pollution.
</P>
<P>
"The serious water pollution along the Huaihe River has already
sounded alarm for us, and we should by no means follow the same
old disastrous road," said Liu.
</P>
<P>
He said that his corporation, along with the Baoshan Steel
Corporation in Shanghai and more than 30 other large enterprises,
put forward about a month ago a proposal on Yangtze water
protection, and has invested a large amount of money in upgrading
its own waste-water treatment equipment.
</P>
<P>
He urged all industrial enterprises along the Yangtze to spare
no effort in promoting clean production and reducing pollutant
discharges, and take effective measures to save water in
production.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that relevant laws and regulations be enacted
as soon as possible to improve the Yangtze's protection.

<HEADLINE> First China-Born Telecom Equipment Producer Set Up in Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China has set up its first mobile
telecommunications equipment company with 100 percent domestic
investment and technology in the municipality of Shanghai, China's
largest industrial and commercial center.
</P>
<P>
The Da Tang Mobile Communications Equipment Co. Ltd. involved a
total investment of 4.8 million yuan with the First Research
Institute of Post and Telecommunications taking 42 percent of the
stake, the Shanghai Post and Telecommunications Equipment
Co. Ltd. having 40 percent and the remaining 18 percent by the
Academy of Telecom Technologies of Post and Telecommunications.
</P>
<P>
The three groups began cooperating in 1996 and has been
committed to transferring research results into productivity. The
new company will be engaged in scaled production of telecom
equipment, including the GSM digital switchboards and equipment
used in wireless telecommunications stations.
</P>
<P>
Dang Ru'an, chief executive of Da Tang, expressed confidence in
the market of home-made mobile telecom equipment, saying the
company will have an edge in pricing and after-sales
service. Projected sales for this year are 50 million yuan.
</P>
<P>
The two research institutes were appointed during the Eighth
Five-Year Plan Period by the state to tackle the technical
problems of producing domestic telecommunications equipment used

<HEADLINE> China's Top Advisors on State-Owned Enterprise Reform </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Three members of the National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC), China's top advisory body, today called for
state-owned enterprise reforms to be accelerated.
</P>
<P>
Gu Shengzu, a standing committee member of the China Democratic
National Construction Association (CDNCA), referred merger of
enterprises to an effective way to revitalize state-owned
enterprises.
</P>
<P>
It can resolve the issue on unbalanced industrial layout, and
help the enterprises raise efficiency by introducing a fairly
large-scale operation, optimizing allocation of resources for
enterprises, increasing their market competitiveness and reducing
production and operation cost, he said at the second plenum of the
CPPCC Ninth National Committee held here today.
</P>
<P>
Concerning enterprise merger, "we should prevent purchase under
administerial interference, mere pursuit of multi-lateral
operation, and blind low-cost expansion and loss of state assets,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Liang Zhongtang, vice chairman of the Shanxi Provincial Academy
of Social Sciences, proposed setting up special funds to
compensate of-job workers and for debts clearance and
standardizing reforms of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
Jing Shuping, chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry
and Commerce, said the state should encourage and guide non-public
sectors to participate in the reform of state-owned enterprises.
</P>
<P>
This is a matter of great urgency not only in making a
breakthrough in enterprise reforms but in effecting a boost for the
development non-public sector economy, he said.
</P>
<P>
"We should neither allow the losses of state assets to occur
nor infringe upon the lawful rights and interests of non-public
sectors," he said.
</P>
<P>
In China, businesses other than those of public ownership have
employed a total of 85 million people, and contributed its share
in absorbing and relocating a large numbers of workers who have
have been dismissed or left their jobs temporarily.

<HEADLINE> East China Province to Become Biggest Bamboo Producer </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province has
planned to expand its bamboo growing area to 870,000 hectares
by 2000 and one million hectares by 2010 to make it the country's
biggest bamboo producer and bamboo products exporter.
</P>
<P>
With mild climate and adequate rainfall, the coastal province
has nice conditions for bamboo growing. It currently has
733,300 hectares of bamboo growing area, accounting for one fifth
of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
China, called the "kingdom of bamboo," ranks first in the world
in types, growing areas and supply of bamboo.
</P>
<P>
The Fujian provincial government saw the potential of bamboo
cultivation as a promising pillar industry and encouraged local
people to be engaged in the trade.
</P>
<P>
Over the past four years, the province added 107,950 hectares
of bamboo growing area and transformed another 200,000
hectares of low-yielding farmland into bamboo production
bases.
</P>
<P>
Along with the fast development of bamboo cultivation, bamboo
processing firms have mushroomed in Fujian. They make bamboo
chopsticks, mats, furniture, floor and handicrafts.
</P>
<P>
The province earned some four billion yuan (482 million US
dollars) last year by exporting 1,000 varieties of bamboo products
to Japan and some Southeast Asian countries.
</P>
<P>
The market potential helped fire the local farmers' enthusiasm
in running bamboo groves and processing bamboo products. In
Jian'ou City, per-capita income for farmers from bamboo growing
reached 1,345 yuan last year, or 44.8 percent of their total
annual income.

</P>
<P>
The spokesman said 30 survivors have been recovered from the
debris so far.
</P>
<P>
However, the number of casualties may rise because a number of
villagers are till missing, he said.
</P>
<P>
He further said it is impossible to provide relief assistance
to the victims from the north because a highway reaching the area
has been cut off due to heavy snow.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Urged to Improve Governance in Bid to Avoid </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- World Bank's Nairobi chief Harold
Wackman has spelled out a tough agenda for the Kenyan government
if it is to avoid instability.
</P>
<P>
Top on the list is that it must improve governance and the
lives of its heavily-taxed people, the Daily Nation newspaper
Monday quoted Wackman as saying.
</P>
<P>
He proposed that the civil service in the east African country
be drastically slashed, the role and size of the government be
reduced, public investment be increased and managed efficiently
and public assets be privatized.
</P>
<P>
"None of this is easy, and it cannot be done overnight. But it
simply must be done," he said on Saturday night.
</P>
<P>
"In part, there are too many people working for government,
there is too little investment, too many projects that don't get
done, and too costly interest rates," he noted.
</P>
<P>
"The most serious problem facing Kenya today is the
deteriorating well-being of the majority of its people, the
increasing disatisfaction with this state of affairs, and the
threat that this poses to social, political, economic and even
moral stability," he warned.
</P>
<P>
"The biggest worry I have is that government, and much of
Kenyan society will continue to expend more time, energy and
money on narrow political objectives and ethnic calculus than on
improving the quality of life and economic well-being of the
people," he said.
</P>
<P>
The World Bank would like to see broader participation of key
stakeholders in determining the nation's priorities and processes#,
whether in reforming the legal system, or making economic
policies or revising the constitution, he added.
</P>
<P>
Kenya needed five billion Shillings to meet its
infrastructural needs over the next five years, according to him.
</P>
<P>
Wackman also advised that the war on corruption could not be
won without greater public exposure of the workings of the
government and political commitment to establishing respect for
any enforcement of the law.
</P>
<P>
"That means public reporting and auditing systems that are
fast, clear and with teeth," he said.

<HEADLINE> Futian Bonded Zone Turned into Comprehensive Free-Trade Zone </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Futian Bonded Zone in
Shenzhen is being turned into a comprehensive free-trade zone, an
official has said.
</P>
<P>
Qiu Shuming, director of the bonded zone's management bureau,
said that with a favorable investment environment the Futian
Bonded Zone has already attracted investments from 478 enterprises
in 22 countries and regions, with funding worth 3.407 billion Hong
Kong dollars in place.
</P>
<P>
In 1997 the bonded zone handled imports and exports and
re-exports totaling 12.46 billion Hong Kong dollars, more than
quadruple the figure of 1996.
</P>
<P>
The zone has attracted a large number of overseas high-tech
enterprises. Talks are still under way on dozens of other projects.
</P>
<P>
The Futian Bonded Zone, covering an area of 1.35 square kilometers,
has accomplished infrastructure investments of 5.5 billion yuan
(665 million U.S. dollars). A special road has been built to Hong
Kong, which is capable of handling 4,000 vehicles daily.
</P>
<P>
Under preferential policies, the imports of machinery,
infrastructure materials and office equipment are exempted from
tariffs.
</P>
<P>
Investors who have bought more than 10,000 square meters of
land for warehousing, processing and transportation
operation are entitled to 10 licenses for container vehicles
running between the zone and Hong Kong.

<HEADLINE> Official Confident About China's Foreign Trade Prospects </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua)-- China has worked out some remedal
measures to offset the negative impact of the Asian financial
crisis on its exports and strive to draw foreign investment,
according to a senior Chinese trade official.
</P>
<P>
The remedy package includes reducing export cost, optimizing
the structure of export items, striving to develop new markets and
increase financial funding, said Shi Guangsheng, vice-minister of
Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (Mofert), at a news
conference hosted by the on-going session of the National People's
Congress (NPC) here today.
</P>
<P>
Cutting export cost will be achieveed through improved
management of trade firms and under the preconditions of
maintaining a stable RMB value.
</P>
<P>
As the bulk of China's industrial and machinery exports are
roughly manufactured goods, there is a need or possibility for
the country to make full use of its cutting-edge technologies to
concentrate more on high value-added products to enhance export
competitiveness, the Mofert official said.
</P>
<P>
This year China will earmark more bank loans to exporters and
further improve export tax rebate system, Shi noted.
</P>
<P>
China ranked 10th in world trade by achieving a total trade
volume of 325.1 billion US dollars in 1997, up 12.1 percent over
the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Its export grew by 20.9 percent to reach 182.7 billion dollars
while import stood at 142.4 billion dollars, representing a meager
2.5 percent increase.
</P>
<P>
According to Shi, China will work to increase import this year
to reduce trade surplus which amounted to 46.3 billion US dollars
in 1997. "Increasing import will also help improve the quality of
our exports," he said.
</P>
<P>
The vice-minister of foreign trade and economic cooperation
acknowledged that the amount of contractual foreign investment
declined by one third last year, but that was attributed mainly to
China's policy adjustments, which diverted investment from
overseas to the central and western regions and priority
infrastructure projects.
</P>
<P>
To put Chinese and foreign-funded firms on an equal footing for
market competition, China abrogated last year the preferential
policies, which had been previously applied to imports by
Sino-foreign ventures like import duty reduction and value-added
exemption.
</P>
<P>
These preferencies will be resumed and also granted to Chinese
firms this year as a way to draw foreign capital.
</P>
<P>
China will keep to policies as regard to attracting foreign
investment, Shi said, adding that he is confident that the country
would achieve a steady growth in foreign trade and foreign
investment.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai Maps Out Re-Employment Plan </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Shanghai will take measures to
control the number of laid-off workers from state-run and
collective enterprises to less than 200,000 this year.
</P>
<P>
The measures will also ensure that the registered
unemployment will not exceed 160,000 people and the unemployment
rate will stand at about 3 percent -- the level recorded at the
end of last year.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts say Shanghai, the largest metropolis of China,
faces grave employment problems this year as restructuring
requires more jobs to be cut.
</P>
<P>
To east the situation, Shanghai will rely on the existing
seven re-employment centers to find new job opportunities. A
municipal plan requires that the two textile and electronical
re-employment centers should find jobs for all of the registered
unemployed workers within the year.
</P>
<P>
The plan also calls for setting up job service offices in 80
percent of the neighborhood committees.
</P>
<P>
Training will also be strengthened. The municipal government
has decided to invest 100 million yuan (12 million U.S. dollars)
for training and it will be responsible for finding jobs for the
qualified trainees.

<HEADLINE> Zambia Urged to Strengthen Trade Ties with Kenya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Zambian manufacturers and traders
have been urged to strengthen the trade relations with Kenya,
Times of Zambia reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
At the Kenyan Products Promotional Exhibition held here at the
weekend, Joseph Sefu, Kenyan High Commissioner to Zambia, said
Zambian manufacturers should increase their exports to his
country to double Zambia's foreign exchange earnings.
</P>
<P>
Zambia and Kenya enjoyed sound economic links for the past
three decades, but there is greater need for the manufacturers in
the two countries to increase trade and enhance economic
development, he said.
</P>
<P>
Although Zambia has penetrated the Kenyan market, much needs
to be done to increase Zambian finished products on that market,
Sefu said, adding that Zambian manufacturers ought to embark on
aggressive trade missions to Kenya to increase trade between the
two countries.
</P>
<P>
The high commissioner also called on Zambian traders to help
reduce the prices of Kenya's exports in the local market by
importing directly from Kenya, the world's top exporter of
quality tea, coffee, beer and dairy products.
</P>
<P>
Currently, Zambia imports blended tea, coffee and dairy
products from Kenya through third parties which increases the
prices of the items, according to Sefu.
</P>
<P>
He said it is time that Zambian companies help reduce the high
prices of the commodities by trading directly with his country.
</P>
<P>
On the same occasion, Mwansa Musonda, director of the export
board of Zambia, disclosed that Zambian manufacturers will hold a
trade mission in Nairobi, capital of Kenya, this year to promote
their products on the Kenyan market.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Expects Guangdong's Faster, Better Development </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- President Jiang Zemin today urged
local officials in south China's Guangdong Province to press
ahead with the world's economic and technological advancement,
deepen reform and boost export-oriented economy.
</P>
<P>
While joining in a panel discussion of deputies to the ongoing
First Session of the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC) from
Guangdong Province, Jiang said that Guangdong, one of China's
first regions to carry out reform and opening-up in the early
1980s, occupies a vital position in the general setup of country's
overall development.
</P>
<P>
During the panel discussion, the deputies talked about
Guangdong's scientific and technological development, the reform
of state-owned enterprises and in-depth restructuring of government
departments.
</P>
<P>
Jiang noted that the province, under the guidance of Deng
Xiaoping Theory and the Party policies, has scored remarkable
achievements in its reform, opening-up and modernization drive.
And the achievements have laid a sound basis for its future
development.
</P>
<P>
The readjustment of industrial structure should rely on
scientific and technological advancement, he said. It is a correct
strategy for Guangdong to take new and high technology as new
areas of economic growth.
</P>
<P>
Some competitive and promising high-tech industries should act
as the locomotive to drive the relevant industries. Enterprises
should engage themselves in technological innovations so as to
develop new, high-quality products, enhance competitiveness and
raise their capability to resist any possible risks, he said.
</P>
<P>
Being at the forefront of China's opening-up, Guangdong should
spare no effort to further expand export and attract more foreign
investment. In the meanwhile, some well-performing enterprises
should be encouraged to go abroad to start businesses, the
president said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign investment should be channeled into
agriculture, high-tech industries, infrastructure and
export-oriented projects, he said.
</P>
<P>
In addition to the emphases placed on economic growth, local
officials should also further improve the Party style of work,
build clean and honest government, give still fuller scope to
democracy and legal system, and encourage the people to adopt
correct approaches toward the people's life, world outlook and
concept of values, Jiang said.

<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 1.5 million passengers
take a taxi in Beijing every day, accounting for 15 percent of the
capital's total public transportation, according to the Beijing
Taxi Bureau.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that Beijing has more than 1,200 taxi
companies, with 65,000 cabs, accounting for one-eighth of the
total in Chinese cities. More than 70,000 drivers are employed in
the taxi business.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, the annual transportation capacity of the sector
reached 600 million, making taxis another major transport means
along with buses and the subway. Statistics indicated that during
holidays the daily transport capacity of taxis may surpass two
million.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, Beijing tightened its administration of the
sector. Since 1994, the Beijing Taxi Bureau has investigated
nearly 40,000 reported violations of rules and about 70 taxi
companies were temporarily closed for a good shake-up.
</P>
<P>
According to the bureau, the sector has fixed capital of eight
billion yuan (about 960 million U.S. dollars), contributing more
than one billion yuan in taxes every year.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Faces Severe Maize Shortage: Minister </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya will have to import seven
million bags of maize this year so as to avoid a severe maize
shortage, The East African Standard Monday quoted Agricultural
Minister Musalia Mudavadi as saying.
</P>
<P>
The east African country has exhausted its strategic reserve
of three million bags of maize because high demand for maize had
out-stripped production, he said in Mt Elgon District,
northwestern Kenya, on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
Consumption of maize in Kenya was between 30 to 32 million
bags per year. But only 23 million bags of maize will be
available during this year's harvesting period due to "unreliable
weather", he noted.
</P>
<P>
The minister urged the farmers to plant drought-resistant and
early maturing crops to make the country self-sufficient in food
production.

<HEADLINE> U.S. Veteran Holds Police Off Over Benefits Complaint </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A military veteran armed with a
rifle and what he claimed were explosives crashed his car through
a gate at a government agency for veterans in Waco, Texas Sunday
and held police off for 14 hours before giving up, reports from
Waco said.
</P>
<P>
Jason Leigh, 48, who police said was upset over problems with
his veterans benefits, walked out of the office with his hands up,
at about 9 p.m. (0400 GMT Monday), ending a day-long standoff with
police that forced hundreds of residents to evacuate the area
around the Veterans Affairs Regional Center.
</P>
<P>
Leigh, a Vietnam veteran, broke into the center around 6:45
a.m. (1345 GMT). He did not take anyone hostage and was believed
to have been armed with explosives, but later denied it, police
said.
</P>
<P>
"He was very concerned about everybody's welfare. He didn't
want to hurt anybody," a neighbor of the armed man was quoted as
saying by the reports. "He was just concerned about a problem he
was having with some veterans benefits."
</P>
<P>
"I, Jason Leigh, do hereby defend this, my vested interest in
the form of this building, to the death or until such time as
Congress and or the U.S. Senate pass a law protecting our fallen,
disabled and homeless veterans by depositing 1 million U.S.
dollars in the stated name of 'SOS,' Save Our Soldiers," he said
in a demanding statement.
</P>
<P>
Police evacuated residents in a six-block area around the
building before starting negotiations with the suspect in the
morning.
</P>
<P>
Federal and local law officers had surrounded the building and
command posts were established at a nearby church and convention
center. An Army bomb disposal team also arrived.
</P>
<P>
Waco is the town in which Branch Davidian cult leader David
Koresh and about 80 of his followers died in flames after a
botched FBI raid on their compound at the end of a long siege five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
It was on April 19, 1995, the two-year anniversary of the fire,
that Timothy McVeigh, a disillusioned Army veteran, used a huge
truck bomb to explode the Alfred P. Murrah federal government
building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people.

<HEADLINE> Zimbabwe's Horticultural Export Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HARARE, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Zimbabwe's lucrative horticultural
industry will earn over 1.1 billion Zimbabwean Dollars (about 70
million U.S. Dollars) from the export of 13,000 tons of flowers
to Europe when the flower season ends in June.
</P>
<P>
According to the Herald daily paper on Monday, the amount to
be earned this season is 160 million Zimbabwean Dollars (nine
million U.S. Dollars) more than that of last season.
</P>
<P>
The industry continues to make headway into the export market,
despite stringent rules on new packaging and environmental
requirements, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Some 7,570 tons of premium quality flowers have so far been
exported to the Netherlands and other European countries, where
demand is high.
</P>
<P>
With business now at its peak, another 5,500 tons of flowers
are expected to be exported before the end of the season,
bringing the total to 13,070 tons.
</P>
<P>
Export Flower Growers' Association, Zimbabwe Trade and the
Horticultural Promotion Council are confident that Zimbabwe will
maintain its market in the European Union, the report noted.
</P>
<P>
"We are the second largest exporter to Europe, and we will
keep studying the market situation so as to meet the requirements
of those countries," said Stanley Heri, chief executive officer
of the Horticultural Promotion Council, quoted by the paper on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
He added that the exports are increasing each year.
</P>
<P>
Zimbabwean flowers and other goods packaged here and in other
developing countries could soon be affected by a European Union
ban on packaging that fails to meet the community's environmental
regulations.
</P>
<P>
However, Heri said exports from this country would not be
affected as Zimbabwe had the resources and materials to meet all
packaging requirements.

<HEADLINE> Hunan Ensures Tea Supply to Ethnic Minority Areas </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CHANGSHA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- As the ethnic minority areas in
China consume more tea than other parts of the country, the state
has designated special tea growers and suppliers to fulfil their
needs.
</P>
<P>
One of them is central China's Hunan Province, which supplies
20,000 tons of brick tea every year, or half of the consumption of
the ethnic minority areas. Brick tea is an indispensable item for
making milk tea by minority people in Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia,
Qinghai, Gansu and Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
The province has designated six tea-processing factories for
the production of tea for ethnic minorities. These factories are
asked to operate under a unified planning and pricing system,
employ the same quality controls and account settlement methods,
and use the same trademark. To ensure an adequate supply, they
must rely on trains to transport products.
</P>
<P>
Stringent measures have been taken against unauthorized
production and counterfeiting of the tea supply for ethnic minority
areas.

<HEADLINE> Albino Wildlife in Shennongjia Puzzles Zoologists </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WUHAN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A growing number of albino animals
have been observed in Shennongjia nature reserve in central China,
puzzling zoologists about the cause.
</P>
<P>
In the dense forest, people have reported seeing bears, snakes
and river deer with white skin or fur. Witnesses said they have
even seen white crows.
</P>
<P>
Zoologists confirmed that wildlife workers have seen and
captured a white snake, a white turtle and white river deer during
two major field surveys in the region between the late 1970s and
mid 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Explorer Zhang Jinxing also said he encountered albino animals
when he stayed in Shennongjia forest areas conducting field
research for three years in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
Tang Mingliang, professor of the school of biology at Wuhan
University, said no significant differences have been observed in
the habits and characteristics between these albino animals and
their peers.
</P>
<P>
The white snakes, for example, are often seen in the company of
green ones at brookside in the deep mountains. The white bear is
an omnivorous animal like the brown bear and has similar habits
such as licking its paws, according to Tang, who has visited
Shennongjia a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
He said so far Chinese zoologists have no convincing
explanations for the phenomenon. He said it might be due to
special geographic position of Shennongjia Mountain where some
wildlife have survived since the fourth glacier period.
</P>
<P>
Another possibility is that it is a sort of atavism, or
throwback to an earlier time, Tang said.

<HEADLINE> Temporary Layoff Is Not "Unemployment": Local Official </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- "Xia gang", which might best be
translated as temporary layoff, is not unemployment, nor is it the
same as dismissal, according to a local official from east China's
Anhui Province.
</P>
<P>
Li Xun, mayor of Bengbu, said "xia gang" is a phenomenon that
has accompanied the ongoing state enterprise reform and "xia gang"
workers refer to those who can work but fail to find a new job
temporarily.
</P>
<P>
Li, who is here attending the ongoing annual session of the
National People's Congress as a deputy, said "xia gang" is
different from layoffs in the West, where to lay off is to
terminate a labor contract with an employee, which means
unemployment for the discharged.
</P>
<P>
In China, some workers are laid off when enterprises suspend or
partially suspend their operations. Such laid-off workers,
however, continue to maintain their employment relations with
their enterprises, which have to pay for their basic living
expenses before they find new jobs.
</P>
<P>
According to the mayor, a total of 51 state-owned enterprises
in Bengbu, the largest industrial city in Anhui, have gone
bankrupt since 1994; and eight were taken over last year alone.
</P>
<P>
Since 1994, he said, the number of laid-off workers in the city
has been in a constant state of change since there have always
been laid-off workers who find new jobs as well as newly laid-off
workers.
</P>
<P>
Last year, 14,000 laid-off workers were reemployed but, by now,
there are still 12,000 laid-off workers in the city, he said.
</P>
<P>
Li said the municipal government spent 30 million yuan last
year on reemployment programs for laid-off workers.

<HEADLINE> Four European Shipping Lines Agree on Vessel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Four main independent European
shipping lines serving the leading east African port of Mombasa
have entered a vessel sharing agreement as the battle for
regional trade hots up.
</P>
<P>
The agreement, which takes effect this month, is signed by the
two leading French carriers Campagnie General Maritime (CGM) and
Delmas, Germany's Deustche Afrika-Linien's SEAL service, and the
Belgian line CMBT, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
The accord leaves Maersk Line as perhaps the only major
European line serving the east African/Indian Ocean trade
operating solo.
</P>
<P>
CGM's east African representative Jack Martineau said that
under the new agreement, the lines will operate six bigger (1,250
TEU capacity) and faster vessels introduced in the European-East
Africa trade.
</P>
<P>
"This means the four 800-TEU-capacity vessels which have been
serving this region will be withdrawn," said Martineau.
</P>
<P>
The pact, he said, will commence with the voyage of Mv
Catherine Delmas scheduled to arrive in Mombasa from Europe in
the first week of April.
</P>
<P>
The agreement brings together the two French lines which last
operated joint services in June 1996 as partners in the Capricone
Service when both lines were handled by the Kenya Shipping
Agency.
</P>
<P>
Delmas later appointed Notco as its local agent. In response,
CGM revived its Europe, Indian Ocean and East African service
without any partners, dedicating four 800-TEU-container ships to
a bi-weekly service.

<HEADLINE> Beijing to Encourage Privately Operated Businesses </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Beijing will offer a good
environment for the development of privately operated businesses
so that they will contribute more to the economy and development
of the Chinese capital.
</P>
<P>
Effective measures will be used to create favorable conditions
for private businesses, said Jia Qinglin, secretary of the Beijing
Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China.
</P>
<P>
Jia, who is also the mayor of the capital, stressed that
leaders of different levels should emancipate their minds and be
concerned with, and support the development of, the private sector
in the local economy.
</P>
<P>
Jia said more efforts should be extended to the adjustment and
creation of related policies. Irrational burdens on the private
sector should be reduced, he said.
</P>
<P>
According to Jia, high-tech industries, the service sector and
those attracting more laborers are the major areas where the
advantages of private businesses are most apparent.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of 1997 Beijing had 247,000
individual employees with registered capital of 2.18 billion yuan
(262.65 million U.S. dollars) and 42,000 private businesses with a
combined registered capital of 24.9 billion yuan (3 billion
U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
According to related statistics, these private businesses
produce 11 percent of the capital's total gross domestic product,
and turn over 100 million yuan in taxes to the state.
</P>
<P>
At present, there are 800,000 people working in the private
sector.

<HEADLINE> Kenya Becomes Second Largest Investor in Uganda </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Kenya ranks second in the list of
Uganda's foreign direct investment countries with 294 investors,
the East African weekly newspaper reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
Kenya is second to Britain, which has 503 registered investors
in Uganda, according to a Uganda Investment Authority report
released last week in Kampala.
</P>
<P>
Uganda has become increasingly popular with foreign investors
because of incentives offered and the ease with which investor
profits can be repatriated, said the report.
</P>
<P>
Coupled with these is its central location in the Great Lakes
Region.
</P>
<P>
While projections for this year indicate that South Africa may
emerge as a major source of foreign direct investment, Kenya is
still expected to remain among the top 10, given the growing
interest shown by Kenyan companies in Uganda.
</P>
<P>
The main areas of investment for Kenyan firms include consumer
goods, financial services, construction, agriculture and hotels
and tourism.
</P>
<P>
Kenya has traditionally been Uganda's leading trading partner,
with most of its consumer goods bought from Kenya.
</P>
<P>
Although Uganda has recently revamped most of its consumer
goods industries, Kenyan goods are still widely available on the
Ugandan market.
</P>
<P>
The other top investors in Uganda come from India, Canada, the
United States, Pakistan, Germany, Italy, China, Tanzania and
Switzerland.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Uganda signed bilateral investment treaties and
double taxation agreements with Kenya, Tanzania, South Africa and
Italy.

<TEXT>
<P>
NAIROBI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A team from the Lake Victoria
Fisheries Organization will visit Canada and the United States
from March 22 to gather information which will help them manage
Lake Victoria resources.
</P>
<P>
A senior official of the Uganda Commission for Fisheries, the
director of the Kenya Marine and Fisheries Research Institute and
the Director of Fisheries in Tanzania, will head the team on its
10-day education tour, the East African weekly reported Monday.
</P>
<P>
"We want to know how these people have been managing the
American Great Lakes, how they carry out research and see if it
can be a model for us," said Micheni Ntiba, executive secretary
of the Lake Victoria Fisheries Organization.
</P>
<P>
Lake Victoria, shared by Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania, has been
the focus of regional efforts to control water hyacinth that has
adversely affected vessel movements at ports.
</P>
<P>
Moreover, a recent ban by the European Union on importation of
fish from the region due to a cholera outbreak has spurred joint
action to save the industry.
</P>
<P>
Peter Christiansen, head of the EU delegation, advised two
weeks ago that Kenya, Uganda and Tanzania establish a joint
fishing authority to manage activities on Lake Victoria, the
second-largest fresh water lake in the world.
</P>
<P>
More than 150 million Dollars is earned from fish exports by
the three countries annually. Uganda's fish export averages up
to 60 million Dollars annually with Tanzania more than 50 million
Dollars and Kenya about 42 million Dollars.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Austrian Trade Ties Hailed </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua ) -- China is satisfied with the
smooth development of its economic cooperation and trade with
Austria in recent years, a senior Chinese official said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Sino-Austrian economic and technological cooperation
advanced rapidly in the 1990s, said Wu Yi, Chinese minister of
foreign trade and economic cooperation, during her meeting with
visiting Austrian Vice Chancellor and Foreign Minister Wolfgang
Schussel.
</P>
<P>
She added that the frequent exchanges of high-level visits
between the two countries had spurred the increased two-way trade.
</P>
<P>
Since Austria is a developed country and China is the largest
developing one with a huge market, the two economies are
complementary, Wu said. Austria's advanced technology in the
fields of railway and highway construction, metallurgy,
hydro-electric power, machine building and environmental
protection has resulted in a good reputation and large demand in
China, she added.
</P>
<P>
Wu expressed her hope that the Austrian businessmen would
sharpen their competitiveness in China to expand bilateral
technological cooperation of mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
By the end of last year, China had cumulatively approved 350
projects with direct Austrian investment. The contractual and
paid-in funds in these projects reached 424 million and 156
million U.S. dollars, respectively.
</P>
<P>
By the end of 1995, China had used Austrian government loans
amounting to 890 million U.S. dollars in 109 projects.
</P>
<P>
From 1996 to 1997, China also approved 153 contracts valued at
640 million U.S. dollars for the introduction of technology from
Austria, making it one of China's major high-tech sources in
Europe.
</P>
<P>
Schussel praised China as the country that has made significant
contributions to the prosperity and stability in Asia.
</P>
<P>
He said that Austria supports China's efforts for its entry
into the World Trade Organization, and hopes that China would play
an important role in the organization.
</P>
<P>
After Austria takes over chairmanship of the European Union in
July, it will promote European Union-Chinese ties, Schussel
added.

<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A senior official has pledged to
help the redundant staff members in such industries as coal,
textiles and sugar get out of difficulty by providing more job
opportunities this year.
</P>
<P>
Gan Zhaojiong, director of the provincial Labor Department of
south China's Guangdong Province, made the remarks at a recent
conference.
</P>
<P>
"The relief work will be combined together with the
re-employment project, and priority will be given to the staff
members of enterprises with poor performances," he said.
</P>
<P>
Early last year, the provincial government made a decision to
allocate 50 million yuan annually to help workers living below the
state-set poverty line during the 1996-2000 period.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that by the end of last year, the province had
accumulated a special fund of 163 million yuan, which then helped
284,000 cash-starved workers and 180,000 retired ones.
</P>
<P>
Gan revealed that, in addition to financial allocations, the
province also will broaden the fund-raising channels.
</P>
<P>
The province has launched an new drive to register the staff
members of poorly performing companies and establish an aid system

<HEADLINE> ADB Operations in 1997 Total 9.5 Billion Dollars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Asian Development Bank (ADB)
said Monday that it increased the volume of its loans and equity
investments by 68 percent to 9.5 billion dollars in 1997.
</P>
<P>
"Most of the increase was attributed to a 4 billion U.S. dollar
financial sector program loan to the Republic of Korea," the
Manila-based bank said in a press statement issued here.
</P>
<P>
It said an outstanding trend in ADB operations was a near
quadrupling in the number of sector development program (SDP)
loans from four to 15.
</P>
<P>
"Such loans amounted to 4.43 billion U.S. dollars in 1997,
compared to just 53.5 million dollars the year earlier," said the
bank.
</P>
<P>
The SDP combines an investment project or sector, and a
policy-based program loan as well as, where appropriate, attached
technical assistance, to meet sector needs in a comprehensive and
integrated fashion.
</P>
<P>
Against the background of a currency turmoil which started in
Asia last July, the bank said, the financial sector received the
highest share of loans with half of the total lending in 1997.
</P>
<P>
It said that aside from the loan to the Republic of Korea, the
ADB approved a 300 million dollar loan to Thailand for a financial
market reform program last year.
</P>
<P>
In the medium term, the bank said, it will place more emphasis
on helping its developing members undertake financial sector
reforms and improve their institutional capacity in policy and
financial management.
</P>
<P>
As of the end of 1997, cumulative ADB operations (lending and
equity), totaled 72.1 billion dollars in 35 developing member
economies, it said.

<HEADLINE> Guangdong Increases Chicken Export to Hong Kong </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUANGZHOU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's neighboring
Guangdong province has increased its chicken export to
Hong Kong from an average of 38,000 to 80,000 each day, since it
resumed chicken supply on February 7.
</P>
<P>
The living chicken supply, however, is unable to cope with Hong
Kong's market demand, which reached 100,000 chickens a day before
the spread of the "bird flu", according to an official of the
Guangdong Administration of Animal and Plant Quarantine.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong is expected to increase its supply to the
former level, said the official.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the export of geese, ducks and pigeons will be
resumed, and thesre animals will accept the same strict inspection
as chickens.
</P>
<P>
Guangdong has currently established a complete inspection
system against domestic animal and bird diseases, involving over
100 supervision organizations and 7,000 inspectors.

<HEADLINE> Shandong Provides Unified Policies for Foreign Firms </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JINAN, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Foreign-funded firms in east China's
Shandong Province will gradually receive equal treatment with
their local counterparts.
</P>
<P>
The province has worked out a plan aimed to provide a fair
competitive environment for foreign investors and to woo more
foreign investors, said a local government official.
</P>
<P>
According to the provincial plan, the limit on
product-domestic-selling proportion will be eased gradually.
</P>
<P>
Newly set foreign-funded firms engaged in high-tech industries
or high-yield, high-efficiency agricultural ventures will be
allowed to sell more of their products on the domestic
market. Previously, most of their products were for export only.
</P>
<P>
These firms will also enjoy the same fees and standards as
their Shandong counterparts when receiving services such as
electricity and water.
</P>
<P>
Foreigners employed by these firms will also benefit under the
new policy, no longer having to pay higher rates than local
residents for such things as medical treatment and housing.
</P>
<P>
Other areas of the country, such as Shenzhen in south China's
Guangdong Province and Fuzhou in east China's Fujian Province,
have adopted similar policies.

<HEADLINE> Australia to Guarantee Wheat Sales to Indonesia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CANBERRA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Australian wheat sales to
Indonesia would be underwritten by up to 250 million U.S. dollars
by the Australian government to protect exporters and help head
off a food shortage in the Southeast Asian nation, Prime Minister
John Howard said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister told the parliament on Monday that the
export guarantee would be provided through the government's Export
Finance Insurance Corporation (EFIC).
</P>
<P>
"The government has approved EFIC providing up to 380 million
Australian dollar (250 million U.S. dollar) insurance for the
balance of Australia's wheat sales to Indonesia on the national
interest account," Howard said.
</P>
<P>
Howard also expressed support to Indonesia in its standoff with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF) over its economic bailout.
</P>
<P>
The IMF announced on Friday that it was postponing a 3 billion
U.S. dollar disbursement of funds because of Indonesia's refusal
to abide by its conditions for the aid.
</P>
<P>
Howard said Australia sympathizes with Indonesia's claim that
the IMF's conditions are too harsh.
</P>
<P>
"We believe the International Monetary Fund's package must be
implemented with care and sensitivity toward the impact of that
package on social stability and social cohesion within Indonesia,"
he said.
</P>
<P>
Australian Foreign Minister Alexander Downer Monday warned of
severe consequences if the IMF abandons its bailout of Indonesia.
</P>
<P>
"If Indonesia were to walk away altogether from the IMF, I
think the economic consequences would be very serious," Downer
told journalists.
</P>
<P>
"On the other hand I don't think it would be appropriate for
the IMF just to walk away completely from Indonesia."

<HEADLINE> China Keen to Develop Large Enterprise Groups </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China will not change its strategy
of developing large enterprise groups despite the fact that some
large enterprises of the Republic of Korea went bust in the
ongoing Asian financial crisis, according to a government official.
</P>
<P>
To create and develop a number of large, highly-competitive
cross-regional, cross-sector and cross-ownership enterprise groups
is a strategic plan of the 15th national congress of the Communist
Party of China, which was held last year, said Li Baomin, deputy
director of the Enterprise Department of the State Commission for
Restructuring the Economy.
</P>
<P>
The persisting Asian financial crisis -- which has swept
Thailand, the Philippines, Indonesia, Hong Kong, Japan and the
Republic of Korea -- and the bankruptcy of some large enterprises
have prompted some people to urge the Chinese authorities to
reconsider its state-enterprise reform plan, which includes the
development of large enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
"We are aware of the problems in developing large enterprise
groups, but we won't change our plan," Li told Xinhua in an
interview.
</P>
<P>
As China shifts from a planned to a market economy and market
competition increases as a result of opening-up, it is an
inevitable choice to create and develop large enterprise groups,
he said.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, China needs to develop a number of large
enterprises and enterprise groups to ensure that the state
controls the economic lifelines and to improve the economic
quality of the state-owned sector, Li said.
</P>
<P>
China started creating large enterprise groups on a trial basis
in 1991. By the end of last year more than 100 state-owned or
township enterprises -- which covered agriculture, machinery,
electronics and metallurgy -- had been selected to pioneer the
pilot program.
</P>
<P>
In the recent past, asset restructuring has been in full
swing. More than 1,000 large- and medium-size state-owned
enterprises have been merged or gone bankrupt since 1997.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a number of large enterprise groups have cropped up
that demonstrated great vigor. For instance, Henan Wuyang Iron and
Steel Co., which had lost 600 million yuan in aggregate,
successfully turned around losses and became profitable five
months after it merged with Handan Iron and Steel Group.
</P>
<P>
However, problems such as pursuing size and speed only,
excessive administrative intervention and inadequate attention to
economic efficiency, have surfaced in some places in the process
of developing large-enterprise groups.
</P>
<P>
Economists warn that such problems must be resolved to ensure
the healthy development of large-enterprise groups and avoid a
crisis similar to that of some large enterprises in the Republic
of Korea.

<HEADLINE> Currency Stability Conducive to China's Accession to WTO </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- China's decision not to devaluate
its currency despite the impact of the Asian financial crisis will
contribute to the country's accession to the World Trade
Organization (WTO), a senior foreign trade official said here
today.
</P>
<P>
"We hope that this decision will help the international
community to increase their awareness of China's attitude and
image in international trade and economic affairs. In this sense,
it will contribute to the process of negotiations on China's
accession to the WTO," said Long Yongtu, vice-minister of Foreign
Trade and Economic Cooperation, at a press conference hosted by
the ongoing session of the Ninth National People's Congress.
</P>
<P>
According to Long, who is also China's chief representative for
negotiations on WTO accession, the decision indicates that China
is a highly responsible member in the world economic and trade
community and is not, as some countries have alleged, pursuing the
increase of exports at any cost.
</P>
<P>
"In the financial crisis that has hit some Southeast and East
Asian nations, the most direct, effective and fast way for
China to enhance its export competitiveness is to devaluate the
currency, but we didn't do that," he noted. "We're prepared to pay
a cost in exports for this decision."
</P>
<P>
However, he acknowledged that whether this decision will help
change the mind of some WTO members depends on those members
themselves.
</P>
<P>
"In the negotiation process, the attitudes of the WTO members
are mainly determined by their own interests and policy concerns,"
he said. "It's not up to China to fix the time of its WTO
accession."
</P>
<P>
He went on to note that in bilateral negotiations on market
access with 35 WTO members, China has signed agreements with 10 of
them and negotiations with the 25 others are also approaching
an end.
</P>
<P>
"We're also pleased to see that the Sino-US relations,
including trade and economic ties, have entered a new development
period, which we hope will open new opportunities for the
negotiations," he said.
</P>
<P>
In response to a question on Taiwan's accession to the WTO,
Long reiterated China's stance that only under the "one China"
principle and after China's accession to the WTO could Taiwan be
accepted by the WTO as a separate customs territory of China.

<HEADLINE> Myanmar to Cultivate More Crops in Southern Division </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Yangon, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Myanmar is planning to cultivate
more paddy, oil palm and rubber in Tanintharyi Division in the
southern part of the country for regional sufficiency.
</P>
<P>
A regional development leading committee has been formed with
Second Secretary of the Myanmar State Peace and Development
Council (SPDC) Tin Oo as chairman for the implementation of the
plan, the official newspaper The New Light of Myanmar reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
During an inspection tour of the division last weekend, SPDC
Vice-Chairman Maung Aye emphasized the importance of the three
crops, saying their cultivation in the division should be
increased because there is plenty of farmland there.
</P>
<P>
He encouraged the private sector there to play its role and
cooperate with the government to carry out the plan.
</P>
<P>
Myanmar is striving to extend the sown area and boost the
production of rice for domestic sufficiency and cotton, sugarcane,
beans and pulses for export.
</P>
<P>
A total of 6.48 million hectares are being targeted to be under
paddy in the country, including 4.86 million hectares of monsoon
paddy and 1.62 million hectares of summer paddy.
</P>
<P>
According to official statistics, Myanmar's rice production in
the 1996-97 fiscal year was 17.08 million tons.
</P>

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members Address on Key Economic Issues (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Ten members of the top advisory
body set forth suggestions this morning on key issues concerning
China's economic growth at the Great Hall of the People in
Beijing.
</P>
<P>
They offered ideas on related topics at the the second plenary
meeting of the ongoing First Session of the Ninth National
Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative
Conference (CPPCC).
</P>
<P>
Li Ruihuan, executive chairman of the presidium of the First
Session of the Ninth National Committee of the Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), presided over the
plenary meeting.
</P>
<P>
Senior officials Wu Bangguo and Wen Jiabao, and officials of
some ministries and commissions under the State Council were
present at the meeting.
</P>
<P>
Banking business is the core of modern economy, and the reform
on banking sector must be underlined and its pace accelerated, and
financial risk must be guarded against, said Feng Tiyun,
vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic
National Construction Association (CDNCA).
</P>
<P>
"That is what the Asian financial crisis has left the Chinese
developing banking business to ponder over," he said.
</P>
<P>
Feng suggested that the decision-making power of banks as
enterprises should be respected, their bad debts be dealt with,
and big efforts be made to develop capital market and recreate
social credit.
</P>
<P>
Li Wuwei, a research fellow with the Shanghai Academy of Social
Sciences, said the source of financial risk does not lie within
banking sector alone, and problems are also inborn within the
state firms' difficulties and social credit.
</P>
<P>
He suggested faster establishment of the capital, property
right and real estate markets, differentiate the relationships
among the government, banks and enterprises, and invest more in
infrastructure, public undertakings and new and high technology.
</P>
<P>
The reform of state-owned enterprises remains a heated topic at
today's meeting.
</P>
<P>
Liang Zhongtang, vice-president of the Shanxi Provincial
Academy of Social Sciences, cited the laid-off workers' social
security and enterprises' debt problems as a thorning issue in
China's economic restructuring.

<P>
He advocated establishing two special funds to subsidize
off-job workers as social security allowances and clear
bad debts of the enterprise.
</P>
<P>
Gu Shengzu, president of the Strategic Management Institute
under the Wuhan University, offered his ideas on the merger of
Chinese enterprises, which include merging state-owned
enterprises, excelling the superior firms and eradicating the
inferior ones, straightening out the relations between government
and enterprises, and developing investment banks.
</P>
<P>
Jing Shuping, chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry
and Commerce, said the non-public-owned economic sector should be
guided to strengthen agriculture as the foundation of the economy,
participate in the reform of state-owned enterprises, boost
economic growth in new areas and help relocate the laid-off
workers.
</P>
<P>
Another major topic popular among the speakers is to exploit
resources rationally and work out a sustainable development
strategy.
</P>
<P>
Wang Wenyuan, a CPPCC member with the Central Committee of the
Jiusan Society which comprise mainly intellectuals, said scarce
water resources has become a key factor restraining China's
economic and social growth.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that 300 out of China's 640 cities suffer
water shortage. "If effective measures are not taken, China's
sustainable development in the 21st century will be hindered by
the dearth of water," he said.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qia, deputy secretary-general of the CPPCC National
Committee, said the State Mineral Resources Commission should work
to examine and approve of the exploitation of mineral resources
across China so as to help reduce waste of the resources, and
prospect new resources.
</P>
<P>
At today's meeting, CPPCC members Lu Qiang, Xiao Wanjun and Guo
Yuhuai also spoke on urban and rural development along the
Beijing-Kowloon railway, increasing farmers' income and improving
the management of key infrastructure projects.

<HEADLINE> Jiang Zemin Gives Thumb up for HKSAR Government </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) --President Jiang Zemin today
commended the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR)
government headed by Tung Chee-hwa for its wisdom and experience
in dealing with complex situations.
</P>
<P>
"Hong Kong compatriots are fully capable of governing Hong Kong
well," said Jiang Zemin, who is also general secretary of the
Communist Party of China Central Committee.
</P>
<P>
Taking part in a group discussion with Hong Kong deputies to
the Ninth National People's Congress (NPC), in session here since
last Thursday, Jiang said the principles of "one country, two
systems," "Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong" and a high degree
of autonomy for Hong Kong are the basic guarantee for Hong Kong's
long-term prosperity and stability.
</P>
<P>
The principles conform with the immediate and long-term
interests of Hong Kong as well as the interests of the Chinese
nation as a whole, he said.
</P>
<P>
The principles are a fundamental guarantee for Hong Kong's
long-term prosperity and stability, and it is also a grand
political strategy for an early reunification of the motherland
and a great reinvigoration of the Chinese nation, he said.
</P>
<P>
"Facts since the return of Hong Kong have proved that 'one
country, two systems,' 'Hong Kong people governing Hong Kong,' and
a high degree of autonomy for Hong Kong are entirely correct," he
said.
</P>
<P>
"The HKSAR government headed by Mr Tung Chee-hwa has wisdom and
experience in dealing with complicated situations," he said.
</P>
<P>
The great socialist motherland provides a powerful backing for
Hong Kong to maintain its prosperity and stability and overcome
any difficulties and risks, he said.
</P>
<P>
"This should become a basis on which people look at the
situation in Hong Kong, evaluate Hong Kong's strength, and view
Hong Kong's prospects," he said.

<HEADLINE> Thailand Imposes New Rules to Protect Rice Quality </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai Commerce Ministry has imposed
additional rules for exporters of fragrant rice in a bid to
protect the quality of the product, the Bangkok Post reported
Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under the new rules, exporters must register their trademarks
with the Foreign Trade Department in order to get export
certificates.
</P>
<P>
The rice given certificates must be planted in Thailand with
strains developed or proved by the Ministry of Agriculture and
agricultural cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
The foreign Trade Department stipulated that certificate
fragrant rice must contain 12 percent to 19 percent amylose, with
moisture level not exceeding 14 percent.
</P>
<P>
The new rules aim to prevent adulteration of fragrant rice,
also known as the Hom Mali rice, which is the most popular and
expensive Thai rice on international markets.
</P>
<P>
Thailand, the biggest rice exporter in the world, recorded 5.28
million tons of rice export last year. The country is expected to
export at most 5.6 million tons of rice this year.

BANGKOK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Thai stocks looking for future
investment opportunities are likely to achieve their goals because
they are still cheap and are expected to overcome their troubles,
according to a researcher here.
</P>
<P>
The currency crisis has caused huge foreign exchange losses for
Thai stocks, giving rise to speculation that the future of the
Thai stock market was gloomy.
</P>
<P>
But Vikit Kachornnarongvanich of Amsteel Securities (Thailand)
took exception to such a view, saying the business fundamentals
for Thai stocks "are still looking good" despite the sharp baht
depreciation against the U.S. dollar.
</P>
<P>
Companies such as Capetronic International (Thailand) plc or
Malee Sampran Factory plc are good examples because although they
are burdened with foreign loans, they have shrugged off the most
daunting difficulties, Vikit was quoted Monday by the Nation
newspaper as saying.
</P>
<P>
He said that while many stocks are overvalued if considering
1997 net losses, the current operations of most listed firms are
still providing good investment returns if their massive foreign
borrowing is left out of the equation.
</P>
<P>
A research institute picked 49 listed companies representing
the banking, finance, energy and communications sectors for
analysis and found that the companies' net earnings would be 890
million baht (20.6 million dollars) excluding forex losses.
However, inclusive of the losses, they recorded a combined net
loss of 177 billion baht (411 million dollars).
</P>
<P>
It is expected that a bankruptcy law, to be officially passed
on March 31, will spark significant financial restructuring of the
companies, because the law will pave the way for creditors to take
over their businesses and the liquidation of the debtors' assets.

<HEADLINE> Proposals on Preventing Financial Risks Raised at CPPCC Session </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Two members of China's top
advisory body today called on the government to draw lessons from
the Asian financial crisis, accelerate China's financial reform
and guard against financial risks.
</P>
<P>
Feng Tiyun, chairman of the Central Committee of the China
Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA), said the
financial situation in China is not calm though the country has
not been affected much by the Asian financial crisis.
</P>
<P>
There is a lack of financial laws and regulations, and
supervision over the financial and banking sectors is not strict,
he said, addressing a full session of the Ninth Chinese People's
Political Consultative Conference National Committee here today.
</P>
<P>
On behalf of the CDNCA Central Committee, he proposed speeding
up banking reform, which covers a separation of government
administration from the management of banks and the establishment
of a new type of government-bank relationship that is suited for a
socialist market economy.
</P>
<P>
He said the government should push ahead with the
commercialization of banks in accordance with the principles of "a
clarification of property rights, a clarification of rights and
responsibilities, a separation of government and the business, and
scientific management."
</P>
<P>
To solve the problem of bad loans, he said, financial
departments, banks, enterprises and other social sectors should
work together.
</P>
<P>
He called for developing a capital market in a big way to
absorb a huge idle capital as well as expand the securities
market.
</P>
<P>
Another CPPCC member, Li Wuwei, said the root cause for
possible financial risks at the present stage is not financial
circles. Struggling state-owned enterprises and credit-related
problems constitute potential risks, he said.
</P>
<P>
He urged the standardization and development of capital,
property rights and real estate markets to ward off any possible
financial risks.
</P>
<P>
He called for stimulating domestic spending since China's
exports are not likely to grow by significant margins this year as
a result of the Asian financial crisis.

<HEADLINE> Roundup: Thai Finance Shake-out to Continue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The on-going financial reform in
Thailand will lead to the reduction in the number of finance
companies and the merge of small finance firms, market analysts
said.
</P>
<P>
There could be just four large finance companies left by the
end of this year plus a few others focusing on niche market
segments, while the remaining will be merged, the analysts
predicted.
</P>
<P>
The prediction is based on the fact that many finance companies
would be unable to meet the demand of the central bank to raise
capital, as they have witnessed deposit runs and have had to
replace the disappearing deposits by borrowing at high cost.
</P>
<P>
Under the commitment Thailand submitted in its second letter of
intent to the International Monetary Fund (IMF), all financial
companies must be able to meet the 8.5-percent ratio by the third
quarter of this year.
</P>
<P>
So far, up to nine finance companies have raised a total
capital of 22.4 billion baht (about 520 million U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
The central bank also ordered other banks to write down huge
non-performing loans, estimated at 20 billion dollars last year.
</P>
<P>
Central bank governor Chaiyawat Wilbulswasdi said last week
that finance companies would need around 40 billion baht (about
930 million dollars) in recapitalization, against 170 billion baht
(about 395 million dollars) by banks.
</P>
<P>
In the finance sector, there is talk that finance companies
will need a combined 100 billion to 200 billion baht (232 million
to 465 million dollars) to write off bad loans and meet the 8.5
percent capital-adequacy ratio.
</P>
<P>
Market analysts said finance companies would survive only with
new licenses allowing them to operate additional businesses.
</P>
<P>
Finance companies, they said, cannot compete with banks because
they have to shoulder higher interest costs due to their lower
ratings. Currently the interbank lending rate is around 20-21
percent per annum, while the companies' deposit rate is around
15-16 percent.
</P>
<P>
Finance companies are net borrowers, and many of them are
believed to have negative balance sheets and non-performing loans.
Moreover, the lower land-evaluation prices will also worsen the
companies' non-performing loans.
</P>
<P>
Therefore, finance companies which cannot raise capital to
offset the non-performing loans will definitely come under the
central bank's control. Earlier, the central bank took over four
banks daunted by bad loans.
</P>
<P>
There is also possibility that many finance companies which
have much less value will be merged into one, so that it will be
easier to control assets, manpower and problems as they arise.
</P>
<P>
The analysts said that only those popular foreign partners and
those with a large capital base would survive the economic crisis.

<HEADLINE> Aquatic Production Booming in East China Province </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FUZHOU, March 9 (Xinhua) -- East China's Fujian Province
yielded a total of 4.29 million tons of aquatic products in 1997,
up 19.8 percent over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
The aquatic production per capita reached 131 kilograms last
year in this coastal province, 20 kilograms more than that in
1996. The province ranks first in the country in per-cipita
aquatic output.
</P>
<P>
Local officials attributed the output increase to the fast
growth of aquatic breeding in shallow sea and fresh water. The
province's total breeding area amounted to 188,000 hectares last
year, increasing nearly 10 percent from the year before.
</P>
<P>
As a result, output from breeding increased 24.14 percent to
reach 2.28 million tons, the highest in the past few years.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, processing for aquatic products also developed
rapidly, with output value reaching 6.46 billion yuan (7.78
million US dollars) last year, an increase of 45.45 percent over
1996.
</P>
<P>
The province developed over 20 kinds of new frozen products
last year, including roast fish, oyster, liquor-saturated
razor clam and algae.
</P>
<P>
It exported aquatic products valued at 600 million US dollars
last year to Japan, the United States, the Republic of Korea and
some Southeast Asian countries.

<HEADLINE> CPPCC Members on Water and Mineral Resources </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Members of China's top advisory
body called for greater attention to be paid to economical use of
water and a rational exploitation of mineral resources.
</P>
<P>
At a full session of the Ninth Chinese People's Political
Consultative Conference (CPPCC) National Committee this morning,
Wang Wenyuan, vice-chairman of the Central Committee of Jiusan
Society, one of the country's eight non-Communist parties, spoke
on the protection of water resources.
</P>
<P>
More than 300 Chinese cities and 60 million Chinese people are
plagued by serious water shortages, and the country suffers a loss
of 20 billion kg of grain each year owing to water shortages, he
said.
</P>
<P>
Wang suggested enhancing popular awareness about the importance
of water resources and their economical use, launching more water
conservancy projects and tightening controls over water pollution.
</P>
<P>
He suggested that the State Council change an existing
locally-collected "water resources fee" into a "water resources
tax" to be collected by the central government. The resulting
money, he said, should be used for water resources development and
protection.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Qia, deputy secretary-general of the CPPCC National
Committee, spoke on mineral resources development.
</P>
<P>
Zhang said China has rich mineral resources of a great number
of varieties, for many of which reserves are the biggest in the
world. Divided by the country's huge population, however, the
country's mineral resources are not rich -- in per capita terms,
the value of mineral resources in the country comes to only half
of the world average, he said.
</P>
<P>
He noted scarcity of mineral resources in China will loom as an
increasingly serious problem to impede its economic development
along with a continued growth of its population.
</P>
<P>
Zhang called for the establishment of central controls on
approving the exploitation of mineral resources, exploring the
possibilities of developing substitutes for some mineral
resources, and formulating policies that encourage, permit
restrict or prohibit mineral resources exploitation depending on
specific cases.
</P>
<P>
He also suggested that China take an active part in the
development of mineral resources development overseas and import
appropriate amounts of minerals to make up for shortages at home.

<HEADLINE> Thailand to Set up Deposit Insurance Agency </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, March 9 (Xinhua) -- A Deposit Insurance Agency is
likely to be set up by the end of the year in Thailand after the
Financial Restructuring Authority auctions assets and settles
foreign claims on the 56 closed financial institutions, the
Bangkok Post said Monday.
</P>
<P>
Under an insurance scheme, priority would be given to
protecting retail depositors. Insurance would be limited up to a
set amount due to the fiscal constraints and the necessity to
encourage market mechanisms and discipline.
</P>
<P>
By putting some fund at risk, more depositors would be
encouraged to take an active role in scrutinizing the financial
health of local institutions.
</P>
<P>
A senior Finance Ministry officer who declined to be named said
that settling the grievances of foreign creditors is considered
essential before a comprehensive insurance scheme can be
established.
</P>
<P>
By the end of this year, Thailand is expected to finish the
recapitalization of existing financial institutions and provision
tightening and complete loan classification standards.
</P>
<P>
A limited deposit protection scheme could then replace the
current blanket guarantee without alarming investors or setting
off capital flight.
</P>
<P>
Thailand has made a commitment to the International Monetary
Fund (IMF) to introduce a Deposit Insurance Plan by the end of the
year, along with new regulations on related party lending and
foreign exchange exposure by finance institutions.

<HEADLINE> Growth of Industrial Stockpiles Slowing Down </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Growth of China's industrial
stockpiles has decelerated, indicating the sector's improvement in
following market demand and adjusting product structure, noted
today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
Statistics from the State Statistics Bureau show that China's
industrial inventories grew 11.7 percent to 592 billion yuan in
1997. The growth pace decreased by 4.61 percentage points from the
previous year.
</P>
<P>
The sales of industrial firms totaled 6,835.4 billion yuan, up
10.7 percent and the ratio of sales to production stood at 96.24
percent, a rise of 0.3 percentage points over the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Despite cut-throat competition, consumer goods manufacturers
registered good sales records, noted the Beijing-based newspaper,
adding that performances of the chemical, metal industries and
agricultural production materials were satisfactory.
</P>
<P>
"But the industrial sector as a whole has no reason for
complacency," said the paper, adding that the authorities and
enterprises should take further measures to promote sales and to
limit production of sectors with excess capacity.
</P>
<P>
Diesel refineries are facing the most severe problem and
conditions for tool-maker manufacturers and power-generating
equipment-makers deteriorated.
</P>
<P>
In the energy sector, where supply exceeds demand, industry
authorities should set production limits, especially for the coal
mines, to prevent inventories from swelling.

<HEADLINE> Gold Consumption to Increase </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The recent steep drop in gold
prices will generate brisk sales for gold jewellery producers and
retailers in China, predicted today's China Daily.
</P>
<P>
The People's Bank of China, the central bank, issued a circular
late last month that pushes down its gold purchasing and selling
prices after reducing them twice last year.
</P>
<P>
The gold purchasing price would drop 8.5 percent to 80.5 yuan
per gram, and the selling price would fall 12 percent to 82.1 yuan
per gram.
</P>
<P>
The disparities between the selling price and the purchasing
price would not exceed two percentage points if there were any
adjustments in the future, said the circular.
</P>
<P>
The price cuts would certainly spur gold jewellery consumption
in China this year, which has yet to be seriously hurt by the
financial turmoil in Southeast Asia, said the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
For years, old-fashioned designs and backward processing
methods have weakened the competitiveness of gold jewellery
producers, who had long been insulated from the global gold
manufacturing circle.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the demand for gold in China reached 213.8 tons, up
three percent compared with 1996.

NANJING, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Homes for the elderly in
Xishan city in east China's Jiangsu Province have become more
attractive because of government efforts to improve their
environment, equipment and services while lowering the cost.

<P>
Currently, 31 local homes for the elderly have received 280
self-paying dwellers, which account for 30 percent of the total.
</P>
<P>
In the past, local homes for the elderly catered only to those

In recent years, local governments have invested more than 40
million yuan to improve these facilities.
</P>
<P>
Many local people now believe that these houses are a good

</P>
<P>
Agreements were signed between the institutions and the

<HEADLINE> hke030905 -Philippine Balance of Payment Deficit Hits Record High </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The Philippines' balance of
payments (BOP) posted an all-time high deficit of 3.363 billion
U.S. dollars in 1997, a reversal from the 4.107 billion dollars
surplus recorded in 1996, due to the massive outflow of capital
following the currency crisis.
</P>
<P>
The latest data from the Central Bank showed that net
investments last year dropped to only 5 million dollars from 1.168
billion dollars the previous year.
</P>
<P>
Prior to the currency crisis, the central bank had projected a
3-billion-dollar surplus in BOP for 1997, the Manila Times
reported on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The BOP deficit last year was even bigger than the 2.118
billion dollars incurred during the debt crisis the country
experienced in 1983, the report said.
</P>
<P>
Despite the deficit, the country is far from a BOP crisis or a
situation similar to that in 1983, when the BOP problem was caused
by a weak economy, the report quoted a central bank official as
saying.
</P>
<P>
This time, the official said, the economy is strong but the
regional currency crisis prompted investors to pull out.
</P>
<P>
The BOP is the record of the inflow and outflow of foreign
exchange in the country arising from trade, investments and
foreign borrowings of residents. It has two categories: the
current account and the capital account.

<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, March 9 (Xinhua) -- Overseas-funded companies will
continue to be the largest employer in Shanghai, according to an
official survey.
</P>
<P>
In 1998, these firms are expected to account for 37.3 percent
of the total employees, and state-owned enterprises 24.2 percent.
</P>
<P>
On the local labor market, the survey says the greatest needs
are for lathe operators, salespeople and restaurant attendants,
who make up one-third of the required labor force this year.
</P>
<P>
People with higher education are more likely find jobs as 14.9
percent of vacancies are open to well-educated laborers,
while 39.4 percent of the vacancies require people who have
professional and technical degrees such as engineers and assistant
engineers.
</P>
<P>
There is a relatively balanced market need for men and women,
since 43.5 percent of positions are left for men and 40.4 percent
for women. Meanwhile, 16.1 percent of the jobs have no specific
gender requirements.
</P>
<P>
Furthermore, 65.5 percent of the jobs go to those 36 years old
and younger.

<HEADLINE> Yugoslavia Opposes Attempt to Internationalize Kosovo Issue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BELGRADE, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Yugoslavia firmly opposes any
attempt to internationalize the Kosovo problem, Yugoslav President
Slobodan Milosevic said on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
At a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Ismail Dzzem,
Milosevic said that non-interference into other country's internal
affairs is an indispensable condition to develop bilateral or
multilateral relations among countries.
</P>
<P>
Milosevic stressed that the conflict between Kosovo separatists
and the central authorities could only be solved within the
framework of Serbia in accordance with the Yugoslav constitution
and laws.
</P>
<P>
Belgrade has the right to launch military attacks against
Kosovo's ethnic Albanian terrorists, he added.
</P>
<P>
As reported by the local News Evening, Dzzem, who is paying a
one-day visit to the country, has conveyed Milosevic a letter from
Turkish President Suleyman Demirer. The report said the letter has
expressed Turkey's stance on Kosovo, but no details have been
revealed.
</P>
<P>
Kosovo, granted autonomy in 1974, is a southern province in
Serbia. Ethnic Albanians who form 90 percent of the Kosovo
population have intensified uprisings against Belgrade when
Milosevic removed the rights of autonomy from Kosovo in 1989.
</P>
<P>
Fearing further spread of the conflicts in Kosovo, Western
countries have urged Belgrade to settle the conflict peacefully,
saying it is a precondition to partially lift economic sanctions
imposed on the Balkan nation.

<P>
On display were garments, food, clocks and watches, toys,
herbal medicines, electronic appliances and other daily items in
150 booths installed by 117 Hong Kong firms, with a total
exhibition area of 3,000 square meters. A fashion show entitled
"Pearl of Asia and Pacific" was launched during the fair.
</P>
<P>
The fair was jointly organized by the Chongqing Municipal
government and the Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC). It
was the largest of its kind organized by HKTDC in China's
central-west regions.
</P>
<P>
A HKTDC official said that Chongqing, a sales center for
central and southwest China, has huge market potential for traders
from Hong Kong.
</P>
<P>
He said it is encouraging that Chongqing has worked out a
series of preferential terms to lure overseas investment.
</P>
<P>
Hong Kong is the largest investor in Chongqing, according to
statistics. Chongqing and Hong Kong have signed more than 1,100
investment projects worth 1.28 billion U.S. dollars in direct

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, March 9 (Xinhua) -- More poor farmers in north
China's Hebei Province have shaken off poverty by improving
infrastructure in poverty-stricken areas.
</P>
<P>
In 1997, about 1.43 million farmers got above the poverty line
in Hebei, where the government provided funds and helped farmers
drill 7,830 wells, build 115 pumping stations, and transform
480,000 hectares of low-yield land into productive fields.
</P>
<P>
The provincial government also organized farmers to develop
regional resources to build series of production bases. It
improved a social service system and markets in poverty-stricken
areas, which have helped the areas form a better system of
production, processing and sales.
</P>
<P>
A provincial official in charge of poverty elimination says
that Hebei has put 2.1 billion yuan into building 223 production
bases, which helped 2,600 poverty-stricken villages set up their
own industries and develop their major products.
</P>
<P>
And, by developing animal breeding and crop growing, some
319,000 poor families in the province have become capable of
shaking off poverty.

AMMAN -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed Saeed Al-Sahhaf
Sunday expressed welcome to a Jordanian idea to hold dialog
between Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Such an idea is corresponding with the Iraqi position on
holding political dialog without any preconditions, said Sahhaf
before leaving here for New York to meet with United Nations chief
Kofi Annan on carrying out oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
During his recent visit to the United Arab Emirates and Oman,
Hussein proposed that Iraq and the U.S. may hold direct talks to
patch up their differences.

But the U.S. has said it has "no plans and no interest" in
doing so. (Jordan-Iraq-Idea)

WASHINGTON -- U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan said on Sunday
that the United States should consult other members of the
Security Council before it could consider to use force against
Iraq if Baghdad fails to comply with U.N. resolutions on weapons
inspection.
</P>
<P>
"If the U.S. had to strike, I think some sort of consultations
with the other members would be required," Annan told ABC TV "this
Week" program in an interview.
</P>
<P>
His remarks were in contrast with U.S. President Bill Clinton's
assertion that the United States has the authority to strike for
any breach of a deal on weapons inspections, reached by Annan with
Baghdad early this month to avert a looming U.S. air strike.

<HEADLINE> Bank Lendings Decline in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, March 9 (Xinhua) -- The currency crisis has slowed down
the growth of the loan portfolio of commercial banks in the
Philippines last year, the latest figures from the Central Bank
showed.
</P>
<P>
For the whole of 1997, the total growth of both peso and dollar
denominated loans slowed to 26.5 percent, down from 51.9 percent
in 1996, data obtained by Business World showed on Monday.
</P>
<P>
The downtrend continued last January, as loan growth further
contracted to 26.3 percent, the newspaper said.
</P>
<P>
Central Bank Governor Gabriel Singson said the trend is an
"indication of stabilizing loan demand in the light of the
regional currency crisis".
</P>
<P>
Despite the slowdown in loan growth, Singson said he remained
confident that "there would hardly be a credit squeeze," according
to the newspaper.
</P>
<P>
Of the three key sectors which comprised the bulk of the
outstanding loans of commercial banks, the financial institutions,
real estate and business services recorded the biggest plunge in
loan growth to 42.6 percent in 1997 from 97.2 percent in 1996.
</P>
<P>
Bank officials attributed the nose dive to the souring of
investor sentiment after lending rates skyrocketed last year, and
to the central bank's policies to tighten bank lending to the
property sector.

<P>
BRUSSELS, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Dutchman Jan Siemerink on Sunday
proved his giant-killing performance to be no fluke at all as he
won the Rotterdam Tennis Open Indoor Tournament in straight sets.
</P>
<P>
It took the world's 48th-ranked player 85 minutes before he
disposed of another unseeded finalist Thomas Johansson of Sweden
7-6 (7-2) and 6-2.
</P>
<P>
This was the third career win of Siemerink who earlier
surprised Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia, top seed Patrick Rafter of
Australia and fifth seed Richard Krajicek also of the Netherlands
in previous rounds.
</P>
<P>
The left-handed Dutchman had some difficulty in the opening set
in which he had to save five break points before getting the
better of the Swede who entered the finals by beating still
another unfancied Brett Steven of New Zealand 6-3, 7-5 in the
semi-finals.
</P>
<P>
After Siemerink took the tie-breaker 7-2, he never looked back
en route to taking the finals. He wound up the match with a love
game in which he served two successive thundering aces.

<P>
WASHINGTON, March 8 (Xinhua) -- A military veteran armed with
explosives and a rifle crashed through the gates of a government
agency for veterans in Waco, Texas on Sunday and held off police
in a siege, reports from the town said.
</P>
<P>
Police have cleared parts of downtown Waco of residents,
workers and churchgoers after the incident began at 6:45 a.m. in
the morning when the man stormed the Veteran Administration Center
with his vehicle.
</P>
<P>
Negotiators were going on with the suspect who has a list of
demands while heavily-armed federal agents and police were
surrounding the building.
</P>
<P>
The man was a military veteran and aged about 60 years but he
declined to detail his demands.
</P>
<P>
Waco is the town in which Branch Davidian cult leader David
Koresh and about 80 of his followers died in flames after a
botched FBI raid on their compound at the end of a long siege five
years ago.
</P>
<P>
It was on April 19, 1994, the two-year anniversary of the fire,
that Timothy McVeigh, a disillusioned Army veteran, used a huge
truck bomb to explode the Alfred P. Murrah federal government
building in Oklahoma City, killing 168 people.

<P>
After meeting Netanyahu in London, Blair was quoted by a
Downing Street spokesman as telling the Israeli leader that
Britain saw an "urgent need" for progress in the stalled Middle
East peace process, especially on the issue of redeployment of
Israeli troops.
</P>
<P>
Blair, whose country is the current European Union (EU)
president, will visit Israel and some other Middle East countries
next month in a fresh effort to enhance a more active European
role, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Netanyahu "looked forward to welcoming the prime
minister (Blair) when he visits the Middle East shortly after
Easter," the spokesman said, adding "Prime Minister Netanyahu
welcomed a more active European role, complementing that of the
United States."
</P>
<P>
British Foreign Office announced last week that British Foreign
Secretary Robin Cook will also visit the Middle East later this
month to pave the way for Blair's Middle East tour.

<HEADLINE> Rifle Workshop Uncovered in Gaza </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Palestinian Security forces
have informed Israel that they have uncovered an underground
workshop for making rifles in Gaza, Israel Radio reported Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The Palestinians said that hundreds of rifles have already
been manufactured at the factory.
</P>
<P>
But Israeli security forces said they believed the number of
rifles made there was not as large as that was reported by the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
There was no report about who operated the factory and if some
suspects have been arrested.
</P>
<P>
On last Thursday, Palestinian security forces arrested some
members of a Hamas (Islamic Resistance Movement) terrorist cell in
the West Bank city of Nablus, who reportedly had been planning a
terrorist attack somewhere in central Israel.
</P>
<P>
Israel has been insisting that its next troop pullback from
the West Bank is contingent upon the implementation of the
Palestinian commitments to fight against terrorists.

<HEADLINE> Gulf Arabs Welcome Iran's Positive Signals on Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUWAIT CITY, March 8 (Xinhua) -- The Gulf Cooperation Council
(GCC) expressed welcome Sunday to Iran's move for neighborliness,
and called on Iraq, another neighbor, to comply with U.N.
resolutions, the Kuwaiti News Agency reported.
</P>
<P>
In a statement issued after a two-day meeting of the foreign
Ministers in Saudi capital Riyadh, GCC states greeted with
satisfaction Iran's positive signals to build mutual confidence
and solve disputes by peaceful means.
</P>
<P>
Some of the signals are "the positive statements made by
Iranian President Mohammad Khatami and the visit of former
President Ali Rafsanjani to Saudi Arabia and Bahrain" in the
recent weeks, the statement said.
</P>
<P>
Ties between Gulf Arab states and Iran, which were strained
after the 1979 Islamic Revolution in Iran, started warming up
after Khatami, a moderate, took office last August.
</P>
<P>
He has said that improving ties with Gulf Arab countries is one
of the top priorities of Iran, to which Gulf Arabs have given a
positive response.
</P>
<P>
But the GCC reaffirmed its steadfast position on the disputed
islands of Abu Mussa, Greater Tunb and Lesser Tunb in the Gulf,
which are controlled by Iran and also claimed by the United Arab
Emirates (UAE).
</P>
<P>
The GCC urged Iran to "stop imposing the de-facto policy by
halting the building of Iranian facilities in the isles in view of
changing its demographic structure."
</P>
<P>
It expressed full support for all measures and peaceful means
the UAE takes to restore sovereignty over the islands.
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, the foreign ministers of the GCC, which
comprises Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the UAE, Qatar, Oman and Bahrain,
also discussed issues related to Iraq and the Middle East peace
process.
</P>
<P>
In the statement, they urged Iraq to implement the U.N.
Security Council resolutions and destroy all weapons of mass
destruction.
</P>
<P>
The statement also said the GCC will remain committed to
helping safeguard Iraq's territorial integrity and sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
Referring to the Middle East peace process, the GCC insisted
that Israel must stop hampering the process and abide by its
basis, the land-for-peace principle.

<HEADLINE> AL, UN Chiefs to Meet on Promoting Ties </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Arab League Secretary General Esmat
Abdul-Meguid will confer with U.N. Secretary-General Kofi Annan on
March 19 during his visit to Cairo on means of promoting AL-U.N.
cooperation and coordination.
</P>
<P>
AL Spokesman Talat Hamad Sunday told the Middle East News
Agency that the talks will focus on the latest agreement between
Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and the U.N. chief on giving free
access to U.N. Special Commission (UNSCOM) on scrapping Iraqi
weapons of mass destruction to all presidential sites.
</P>
<P>
Talks may tackle setting a time frame to end UNSCOM's mission
in Baghdad so as to ease the Iraqi people's sufferings under
U.N. sanctions imposed after the 1990 Iraqi invasion of Kuwait,
Hamad added.
</P>
<P>
The deal signed by Annan and the Iraqi government in Baghdad
last month has managed to avert imminent U.S. military strikes
against Iraq and made way for unrestricted U.N. arms
monitoring. The U.N. sanctions can only be lifted until the
U.N. arms inspectors verifies that Baghdad has eliminated all its
banned weapons.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Abdul-Meguid and Annan will discuss the
Libyan-West crisis over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing following a
favorable International Court of Justice (ICJ) decision for Libya.
</P>
<P>
The Arab leader has stepped up his campaign for lifting the
U.N.-imposed air, arms and diplomatic embargoes against Libya
since the ICJ decided last month that it has the jurisdiction to
try the two Libyans suspected of bombing a Pan Am flight over
Lockerbie, Scotland, in 1988. A total of 270 people were killed in
the bombing.
</P>
<P>
"The Arab stance supports the Libyans on the possibility of
beginning the trial in a neutral country," Hamad added.
</P>
<P>
The Security Council will take on this issue on March 20 in its
special session under Annan at the request of the Arab countries,
he added.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the two leaders will further explore ways to boost
Annan's role in breathing life into the deteriorating Mideast
peace process due to Israeli rejection to implementing
U.N. resolutions, according to the AL spokesman.
</P>
<P>
Annan is due here on March 18 for his first visit to Egypt
since taking the job at the world organization. This visit will be
part of a multi-leg Mideast tour, which will also take him to
Syria, Lebanon, Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas.

<HEADLINE> Iraq Hails Jordanian Idea of Iraq-US Dialogue </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
AMMAN, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Iraqi Foreign Minister Mohammed
Saeed Al-Sahhaf Sunday expressed welcome to a Jordanian
idea to hold dialog between Iraq and the United States.
</P>
<P>
Such an idea is corresponding with the Iraqi position on
holding political dialog without any preconditions, said Sahhaf
before leaving here for New York to meet with United Nations chief
Kofi Annan on carrying out oil-for-food deal.
</P>
<P>
"The call of his Majesty King Hussein comes in this direction,
because dialog is the sound way to tackle any problem between any
two or several given countries," Al-Sahhaf said.
</P>
<P>
During his recently visit to the United Arab Emirates and Oman,
Hussein proposed that Iraq and the U.S. may hold direct talks to
patch up their differences.
</P>
<P>
But the U.S. has said it has "no plans and no interest" in
doing so.
</P>
<P>
Al-Sahhaf arrived here in the day en route to New York. Before
his departure, he also met with Jordanian Deputy Prime Minister
for Development Affairs and Minister of Foreign Affairs Jawad
Anani.
</P>
<P>
Anani told him that during a meeting scheduled for next
Saturday, Hussein would try to persuade U.S. President Bill
Clinton to open dialog with Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Iraq has once proposed to hold direct dialog with the U.S. and
invited U.S. congressmen to visit Baghdad for better understanding
of the situation there.
</P>
<P>
But the invitation was rejected and the U.S. government showed
no interest in opening a dialog with it.
</P>
<P>
The relations between Iraq and the U.S. are tense due to
disputes over United Nations arms inspections. The U.S. came to
the brink of a military attack on Iraq last month, which was
averted by U.N. chief Kofi Annan's success in mediating a peaceful
solutions.

<HEADLINE> Turkey Warns Neighboring Countries Not to Support </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ANKARA, March 8 (Xinhua) -- Turkey on Sunday warned
neighboring countries against backing terrorist organizations,
saying they themselves might be victims of terrorism someday.
</P>
<P>
Addressing a security meeting held in the northern city of
Tokat, Turkish Interior Minister Murat Baseskioglu said that some
countries are trying to achieve its own goals through supporting
terrorists, the Anatolia News Agency said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that these countries should be aware that the
harmfulness of terrorism, which has become the main danger to
the whole world, is by no means limited to certain countries.
</P>
<P>
Turkey would like to solve these problems through dialogue
and talks with its neighboring countries, Baseskioglu said,
without naming these countries.
</P>
<P>
He added that more and more terrorists, especially those of
the outlawed Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), turned themselves in to
the security authorities as they realize that they could get
nowhere through terrorism.
</P>
<P>
Turkey has long been accusing some neighboring countries, such
as Iran, Syria and Greece, of supporting the PKK militants. These
countries, however, categorically denied the charges.
</P>
<P>
Baseskioglu said that Turkish security troops will continue
their efforts to crack down on all those groups which conducted
terrorists activities against Turkey.
</P>
<P>
The PKK has been fighting a 14-year-old war against the
Turkish government for autonomy in eastern and southeastern
Turkey.
