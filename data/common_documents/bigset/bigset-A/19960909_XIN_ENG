<HEADLINE> Malaysia's GDP Grows at 8.4 Pct in 2nd Quarter </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Malaysia's gross domestic
product (GDP) growth in the second quarter this year was recorded
at an annual rate of 8.4 percent compared with 8.3 percent in the
previous quarter, according to the country's National Bank today.
</P>
<P>
The bank said a statement that the growth momentum was
supported by continued expansion in all major sectors --
manufacturing, construction, services, agriculture and mining.
</P>
<P>
Output of the manufacturing sector expanded at a slower pace of
12.3 percent compared with 14 percent in the previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
Domestic-oriented industries, such as those producing transport
equipment, and construction-related, rubber, non-metallic mineral
and petroleum products, expanded at 15.6 percent as against 18.2
percent in the first quarter.
</P>
<P>
Output of export-oriented industries registered a moderate
growth of 9.6 percent from 10.5 percent in the first quarter,
largely affected by the slower growth of the electronics and
electrical industry due to excess supply of semiconductors in the
world market and by competition from overseas manufacturers of
electrical products like air-conditioners and audio-related
products.
</P>
<P>
The agriculture sector rebounded strongly to record an annual
growth of 5.8 percent following a decline of 3.1 percent in the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The construction sector expanded by 11.5 percent while the
service sector grew by 8.6 percent. Finance, insurance, real
estate and business services, transport, storage and
communications and utilities sub-sectors all expanded at
double-digit rates.
</P>
<P>
On the investment front, private investor sentiment remained
favorable with the value of manufacturing investments approved by
the government amounting to 7.2 billion ringgit (about 2.88
billion U.S. dollars) compared with 9.7 billion ringgit (about
3.88 billion U.S. dollars).
</P>
<P>
Inflation edged upward in the second quarter, rising at an
annual rate of 3.7 percent compared with 3.4 percent in the
previous quarter.
</P>
<P>
The country's total debt increased marginally by 0.5 percent to
90.8 billion ringgit (about 36.32 billion U.S. dollars) at the end
of June.
</P>
<P>
At the end of June, the outstanding domestic debt amounted to
78.5 billion ringgit (about 31.9 billion U.S. dollars),
representing 87 percent of the total debt.

<HEADLINE> Lebanon Holds Fourth Round of Elections </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIRUT, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Lebanon held today the fourth
of the five-round parliamentary elections in the constituency of
south Lebanon, where Israel occupies a 850-square-kilometer border
strip since 1975.
</P>
<P>
In an addition to more than 700 polling stations in the
government-controlled areas in the south, 30 polling stations
were also set up in the Lebanese capital of Beirut to facilitate
those coming from the occupied zone.
</P>
<P>
Dozens of buses were sent to various crossing points to
transfer the voters from the border strip to Beirut.
</P>
<P>
When Xinhua correspondents arrived at the Bir Hassan polling
station in Beirut's south suburb at noon, more than 1,000 voters
already gathered there, some of them had already cast the votes
but did not want to leave immediately.
</P>
<P>
The Bir Hassan station was installed specially for the voters
from Khiam, a major town in the middle of the occupied enclave in
south Lebanon which Israel claimed as a "security zone" in 1985.
</P>
<P>
However, most of the voters outside and inside the station
were refugees who had been living in Beirut and its suburbs for
years.
</P>
<P>
Sheikh Fuad Daher Khouri, 31, a Moslem cleric, confirmed that
there were not many voters coming today from the Israeli occupied
lands due to the obstacles of the Israeli occupation forces.
</P>
<P>
Khouri, wearing typical black robes of Shiite cleric, said
that his family had been living in Beirut for 12 years.
</P>
<P>
He said that his vote was for "the Liberation and
Development," a parliamentary bloc incorporating the Amal movement
led by House Speaker Nabih Berri and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, or
Party of God, since "it represents the Lebanese resistance
movement against the (Israeli) occupation."
</P>
<P>
There are some 120 candidates, including 21 in the
Amal-Hezbollah alliance, competing for 23 seats allocated for
south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Eighty-two seats in the half-Christian, half-Moslem have found
their owners in the previous three rounds of elections held
respectively in Mount Lebanon, northern Lebanon and Beirut.
</P>
<P>
Faiz Zalal, a 31-year-old teacher in a secondary school in
Khiam, said he arrived in Beirut earlier this morning with a dozen
of fellow townsmen by three cars.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that the general elections gave him an "opportunity
to express his political opinions."
</P>
<P>
"For the first time I feel I'm a real Lebanese citizen," he
said, referring to the civil right he wield today in casting
vote.
</P>
<P>
He declined to make comments when asked about the activities of
anti-Israeli guerrillas, most of whom were members of Hezbollah or
Amal, in south Lebanon.
</P>
<P>
Mansour, some 100 kilometers south of Beirut, is only two
kilometers away from the Israeli border. Israeli snippers in a
hilltop position just outside the village were watching down
through the front sights of their rifles at the villagers.
</P>
<P>
At a polling station in the village, an election official said
that about 10 percent of 1,500 voters in the village cast their
votes in two and half hours since the station was open at 7:00
a.m. (04:00).
</P>
<P>
Abdu Latif al-Zein, the village head, said all the votes of his
villagers were for the "Liberation and Development" bloc.
</P>
<P>
"Is there any other choice for us when the occupation is
standing?" he asked.

<TEXT>
<P>
DAMASCUS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The Damascus-based
Secretariat of the International Confederation of Arab Trade
Unions (ICATU) has denounced the Turkish government's declared
intention to establish a so-called security buffer zone in
northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
In a statement released here today, the ICATU Secretariat
called upon the U.N. Security Council to condemn the Turkish
practices and to support the Iraqi territorial integrity and
national sovereignty.
</P>
<P>
It also called upon the Arab states to exert efforts to prevent
Turkey from establishing such a security zone in order to maintain
Arab-Turkish relations and to safeguard regional security.
</P>
<P>
The secretariat underlined that the Turkish declaration was
tantamount to interference in the internal affairs of Iraq and a
threat to Iraq's territorial integrity and national sovereignty,
adding that it was diametrically in contradiction with
international law.

<HEADLINE> Israeli Parliamentarians Visit PLO Headquarters </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Several members of the
Knesset (MKs), Israel's parliament, visited this afternoon the
Orient House, the PLO's headquarters in eastern Jerusalem and held
a meeting with senior Palestinian official Faisal Husseini, Israel
Radio reported.
</P>
<P>
All of the 15 members of the Interior Committee of the Knesset
had been invited to come along to the Orient House, but only four
of them actually went to the meeting, the radio reported.
</P>
<P>
Coalition MKs of the committee boycotted the visit, and some of
them called for the resignation of Labor MK Salah Tarif, who
chairs the committee and led the delegation today to the Orient
House, according to the report.
</P>
<P>
Tarif dismissed the call, saying that the delegation came to
the Orient House only to deal with the issues of the Israeli
Arabs in eastern Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Tarif said that they held talks on wide range of issues in
Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Husseini, top PLO official in Jerusalem, described
his meeting with the Israeli MKs which lasted about an hour, as
"positive" and "a recognition of reality."
</P>
<P>
Husseini said that although the issue of Jerusalem is supposed
to be dealt with during final status talks between Israel and
Palestinians, but some problems concerning lives of the residents
should be solved now.
</P>
<P>
In a related development, Ireland, which holds the rotating
presidency of the European Union (EU), has expressed its
determination to have its representatives visit the Orient House.
</P>
<P>
Irish Foreign Minister Dick Spring told reporters Saturday
during an informal EU foreign ministers' session in Tralee,
Ireland, that an EU "troika" of Ireland, the Netherlands and
Italy stood by an earlier decision to see the PLO in the Orient
House.
</P>
<P>
"We want to make a contribution to the Mideast peace process
and it is important that we keep a balance in our relations with
the Israeli government and the Palestinian National Authority
(PNA)," said Spring.
</P>
<P>
Last Thursday, Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy, who is
currently visiting Europe in an attempt to persuade EU officials
not to visit the Orient House, told Spring in Dublin, capital of
Ireland, that PNA President Yasser Arafat had agreed that the
Palestinians would not hold political meetings in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
Irish officials said they would be seeking clarification from
the Palestinians about whether or not they had reached such an
agreement with the Israeli government.
</P>
<P>
The EU had agreed to go to the Orient House at a meeting in
July and had not been informed of any change in the location of
PLO's office, the officials said.
</P>
<P>
No date for the troika visit has been planned but EU
ministers had hoped it might take place before the end of this
year, despite the rejection of the Israeli government.

<HEADLINE> Sino-Dutch Relations Have Bright Future: CPPCC Chairman </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
THE HAGUE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chairman of the Chinese
People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC), Li Ruihuan,
said here today that relations between China and the Netherlands
have a bright future as the two countries have no fundamental
conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
Li made the statement during talks with Wim Deetman, president
of the Second Chamber of the Dutch parliament.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese official said that with joint efforts from both
countries, bilateral relations have developed rapidly over the
past few years.
</P>
<P>
He said China is pleased to see more and improved cooperation
between China and the Netherlands in various fields.
</P>
<P>
Li noted that both China and the Netherlands hold identical or
similar views on many important issues, and their economies are
highly complementary to each other.
</P>
<P>
The CPPCC chairman said that there is every reason for
Sino-Dutch relations to develop further and the CPPCC is ready to
work toward this goal.
</P>
<P>
Deetman said that Sino-Dutch trade and economic relations have
made great progress in recent years and that he hopes to see more
positive results from the technological and cultural exchanges and
cooperation between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
The Netherlands is also ready to promote cooperation with China
in the agricultural sector, he added.
</P>
<P>
During the first half of next year when the Netherlands will
hold the rotating presidency of the European Union (EU), the
Netherlands will try to lift the EU's trade restrictions on China
and to promote EU-China trade and economic relations on the basis
of equality and mutual benefit, he said.
</P>
<P>
He agreed with Li's view that countries should seek the common
ground while reserving differences and promoting cooperation.
</P>
<P>
The chamber president noted that so long as the Netherlands and
China treat each other on the basis of equality, they will be able
to find more in common and therefore cooperate better.

BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China is to raise the curtain
on its grandest ever film festival next month to highlight a
bright future for the movie industry, officials said here today.
</P>
<P>
The Fifth Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Festival, to be
held in southeast city of Kunming from October 9 to 13, will
feature award-giving ceremonies, film exhibitions, as well as
business exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Experts and officials will discuss strategies to woo audiences
back to cinemas, organizers said.
</P>
<P>
Some 30 overseas and Chinese films will be shown at the
festival, including many award-winners, according to the China
Film Association.
</P>
<P>
China's film industry was born in 1905, but is now experiencing
a recession as a result of an outdated management system, as well
as the introduction of more modern entertainment.
</P>
<P>
With many of the country's film studios in the red, the
government began to reform the film management system in 1993,
bringing more autonomy to filmmakers, and importing more top-rated
foreign movies.
</P>
<P>
The annual Golden Rooster and Hundred Flowers Film Festival was
first held in 1992. It was a merger between the 34-year-old
Hundred Flowers Award and the 15-year-old Golden Rooster Award,
the most influential film events in the country.

<HEADLINE> Ieng Sary Expects Amnesty, End to Civil War </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MALAI, Cambodia, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Breakaway Khmer Rouge
commander Ieng Sary predicted today that once his faction joined
the government, Cambodia's long-running civil war would end.
</P>
<P>
But he told a press conference of foreign and domestic
journalists that his new movement, the Democratic National Union
Movement (DNUM), would only join the government if he was granted
an amnesty.
</P>
<P>
Sary has been holding talks with the government about a
permanent peace and national reconciliation. The talks were
positive and the two sides have reached agreement on the terms of
a ceasefire, Sary said from his base in Malai, western Cambodia.
</P>
<P>
He agreed with the royal government to set up a military
committee on the front line to improve communication, solve all
the problems relating to the ceasefire and preserve the territory
they currently control.
</P>
<P>
He said talks with the government would continue once his
status was resolved. He said a pardon from the government was
justified because of his leading role in breaking away from the
hardline leadership of the Khmer Rouge which continues to fight
the government.
</P>
<P>
The guerrilla movement signed a peace treaty in 1991 to end the
war in Cambodia, but rejected the U.N.-brokered general elections
in 1993 and continued their campaign against the government.

<HEADLINE> Chinese, Malian Presidents Hold Talks in Beijing </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese President Jiang Zemin
was told by an African president today that China should play a
more important role in world affairs.
</P>
<P>
The President of Mali, Alpha Oumar Konare, said in Beijing that
such a step would help global peace and stability.
</P>
<P>
President Konare arrived in China today at the start of a five
day state visit.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese President said that the Malian president's current
visit will turn a new page in China-Mali friendship.
</P>
<P>
Jiang made the statement this afternoon in Beijing during his
talks with President Konare.
</P>
<P>
Addressing Jiang, the Malian president said, "We hope China
will take up a more important position in the world, playing a
more important role in international affairs."
</P>
<P>
He added, "It would be conducive to world peace and stability."
</P>
<P>
During friendly talks Jiang said Konare's present China visit -
his second in four years - indicated the importance Konare and the
Malian government attached to the traditional friendship between
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Jiang recalled the warm reception he had been given by Konare
and the Malian people during his visit last May, saying the
touching atmosphere was still present.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said frequent exchanges of visits by high-ranking
officials of the two countries resulted from the deep friendship
between the two sides, which is aimed at furthering bilateral
relations.
</P>
<P>
According to the Chinese President great changes have taken
place in the world, as well as in the two countries, during the 36
years of Sino-Malian relations. However, he noted, the friendship
has developed healthily and in a stable way, which demonstrates
that state-to-state relationship based on the principle of
peaceful co-existence has great vigor.
</P>
<P>
Konare said, relations between Mali and China enjoy a solid
historical foundation with deep and sincere friendship between the
the two sides, adding that the Mali visit, during his Africa tour
by President Jiang, indicated China's support to Mali and other
African countries.
</P>
<P>
Konare said, China's support and help to Mali proves that the
Chinese people are the true friends of the Malian people. He
stressed the consistent stand of the Malian government on the
issue of Taiwan, saying that there is only one China.
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, taking a review on the development of Sino-Malian
ties, China is happy to see that the two countries have effective
cooperation in areas of politics, economy, culture and education.
</P>
<P>
"We share the same, or similiar views, on many key
international issues so that the two sides sympathize with, and
support each other, in world affairs, safeguarding the interest of
developing countries through joint efforts. "
</P>
<P>
Jiang said, the Chinese government appreciates the importance
President Konare and the Malian government attaches to its
relationship with China. He also expressed thanks to the Malian
government for its precious support to China in world affairs,
adding that China wishes to work together with Mali in
establishing stable and completely cooperative Sino-Malian
relations facing the 21st century, on the principle of sincerity,
friendliness, equality, cooperation and common development.
</P>
<P>
The two also briefed each other on domestic situations, with
Jiang praising Mali's achievements in maintaining political and
social stability, and in developing its economy.
</P>
<P>
After the talks, the two heads of state attended a signing
ceremony for an agreement on economic and technological
cooperation between the two governments.
</P>
<P>
Later, Jiang hosted a banquet in Konare's honor.

<HEADLINE> Thai Stock Exchange Index Plunges Below 1,000-Mark </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The stock exchange of Thailand
(SET) index today fell well below the psychological 1,000-point
mark, the first time in six years.
</P>
<P>
The SET closed at 986.32 points, down 21.19 points from 1007.51
points on Friday, or a drop of 2.10 percent from the last trading
day.
</P>
<P>
The historical plunge came amidst bad market news: bank stocks
were falling, blue chip stocks were unable to provide support, and
the political scene was gloomy.
</P>
<P>
On Friday Finance Minister Bodi Chunnanon called an emergency
meeting to authorize an immediate intervention in the stock market
after the SET plunged to the lowest level in three years during
the morning session and ordered a 16-billion baht (640 million US
dollars) fund to start buying in the afternoon.
</P>
<P>
However, the fund failed to restore investors' confidence.
</P>
<P>
Analysts say that the plummet was a reflection of the
fundamental economic problems the country was facing.
</P>
<P>
Investor confidence has been eroded because of doubts both in
Thailand and abroad about the stability of the Banharn Silpa-Archa
government and its ability to put the economy back on track.
</P>
<P>
With a censure debate set for September 18-19 against the prime
minister, analysts say Banharn has three options -- resignation,
dissolution of parliament and stay on but with a major cabinet
reshuffle.

<HEADLINE> China to Send Two Giant Pandas to San Diego Zoo </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Two giant pandas leave China
for the US tomorrow - after being insured for 1.5 million US
dollars.
</P>
<P>
The pair of giant pandas will travel by air to the United
States, where scientists are to launch a 12-year panda
reproduction research program.
</P>
<P>
A special handing-over ceremony was held by the China Wildlife
Conservation Association (CWCA) and the US Zoological Society of
San Diego at the Shanghai Zoo today.
</P>
<P>
Chinese and American scientists hope to find out effective ways
of increasing number of the species in the wild by making further
research into the animal's reproduction mechanism.
</P>
<P>
The research will also be vital to research for the protection
of giant pandas when their habitat is changed, the scientists
believe.
</P>
<P>
Two years ago, CWCA and the US side signed an agreement on
co-operation of reproduction research of the giant panda, one of
the most endangered species in the world.
</P>
<P>
The two pandas were both chosen from the China Giant Panda
Conservation and Research Center, located in southwest China's
Sichuan Province, the traditional home of the animal.
</P>
<P>
The male, Shi Shi, is 15 years old, weighing 102 kg (204
pounds), and the female, Bai Yun, is five years old, weighing 90
kg.
</P>
<P>
They are very healthy and have a good appetite at present,
according to CWCA.
</P>
<P>
The US side has insured the pandas for 1.5 million US dollars
in advance.
</P>
<P>
The pandas are the third pair to be sent overseas by the
Chinese government for purposes of scientific research, following
the two pairs sent to Japan and the Republic of Korea, according
to CWCA.
</P>
<P>
Some 1,000 giant pandas remain in the wild in China. Chinese
specialists have bred dozens of pandas through artificial
insemination over the past few decades.
</P>
<P>
CWCA and the San Diego Zoo have undertaken co-operation in the
research of wild animal breeding since 1979, with fruitful
results.

<HEADLINE> Hong Kong's Exports Predicted To Pick Up </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's exports are
predicted to make a recovery in the latter half of 1996 thanks to
an expected rebound in the global economy, according to Hang Seng
Bank, the third largest in the territory.
</P>
<P>
The latest issue of the Hang Seng Economic Monthly predicts
that total exports in Hong Kong would grow by seven percent in
the second half.
</P>
<P>
In view of the sluggish rise of 4.9 percent in the first seven
months, exports would only gain six percent for the year as a
whole, much slower than the 14.9 percent increase recorded in 1995.
</P>
<P>
Economies in Europe and the United States are likely to pick up
 in the rest of this year, fueled by interest rate cuts, falling
unemployment rates and rising income. The Monthly publication says
 that positive outlook means the recovery in demand in these
countries which remain the largest buyers of the territory's
exports.
</P>
<P>
As one-third of Hong Kong's external trade is related to inland
area, tax and trade policies introduced by the Chinese government
would have a strong impact on Hong Kong's trade. Such measures as
tax rebate reimbursements to China's exporters and the partial
relaxation of credit conditions in the country would help to
improve Hong Kong's exports performance, according to the Hang
Seng report.
</P>
<P>
The report addresses several elements that would affect the
territory's export prospects in the long run. It says that the
formation of regional trade blocs would make those member
countries import less from their traditional trade partner -- Hong
Kong. Moreover, the growing volume of trans-shipments and direct
shipments of goods from newly-built ports in southern China might
weaken Hong Kong's role as an entrepot.

<HEADLINE> Nebiolo Criticises Absent Track Stars </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
BELGRADE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- IAAF president Primo Nebiolo
strongly criticised leading athletes who ignored his plea to
compete in Monday's symbolic Solidarity meeting when he arrived in
the war-ravaged Sarajevo on Sunday night.
</P>
<P>
According to press reports reaching here, Nebiolo, along with
200 athletes, officials and journalists, had endured an 11-hour
journey to fly the 750 kilometres from Milan to Sarajevo where
Monday's meeting in the partially rebuilt Kosevo stadium is
expected to attract a crowd of 50,000 people.
</P>
<P>
"There are people strong on the track without courage off
the track," Nebiolo said.
</P>
<P>
"There are young guys here from countries which are not so
famous but are countries which have more feeling with other
people who have problems like the people of Bosnia.
</P>
<P>
"We are here to express to the city our love and to explain
that we have been following what has been happening -- your
tragedy."
</P>
<P>
Nebiolo had made a personal plea to the sport's top stars to
compete in Bosnia on humanitarian grounds, forgoing their usual
appearance fees and prize money. But on Sunday only 52 athletes
had arrived, although a further 30 indicated they might come on
Monday morning.
</P>
<P>
Among those already in Sarajevo are five current Olympic
champions -- but only one from the United States, high jumper
Charles Austin.
</P>
<P>
The other Atlanta gold medallists were Joseph Keter of
Kenya, Balasz Kiss of Hungary, Ludmilla Engquist of Sweden and
Chioma Ajunwa of Nigeria. Inessa Kravets of Russia is expected
to arrive on Monday.
</P>
<P>
But athletes have been warned to take precautions during
their short stay in the city. A spokesman for the NATO troops
said: "Under no circumstances should any athlete out on a
training run go on any grass they see, as it is likely to be
heavily mined."

<HEADLINE> Feature: Lull Arouses Hope of Peace in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
FREETOWN, Sept 9 (Xinhua) -- Liberians are breathing sigh of
relief over what many people see as "a temporary lull" in the
castastrophe that has plagued the west African country in the
past six years.
</P>
<P>
Visiting Liberia over the weekend, a euphoria of yearning for
peace is evident from both the grassroot Liberian to big interest
groups with foreign connections.
</P>
<P>
"We foresee Liberia coming back to the financial prosperity of
the past," said the 35-year-old Lebanese merchant, Adnan Fakomi,
whose business has been vandalised six times by roving bands
from Liberia's five warring groups vying for political power.
</P>
<P>
Officials in the Bank of Liberia, which was heavily looted during
the factional rivalry in March and April, are beaming with
smiles, eyeing bright rays on the economic horizon.
</P>
<P>
The new government of Mrs Ruth Perry has pleaded it has the
solution to what Liberia needs.
</P>
<P>
Relief officials told me that starvation and malnutrition
remain a devastation plague, especially in the Cape Mount area
close to the Sierra Leone border.
</P>
<P>
One Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) official said in
an interview that some 60 percent of residents in Tubmanburg in
the north of Liberia, particularly children, are severely
malnourished.
</P>
<P>
The FAO and the World Food Programme (WFP), she said, had been
"pressing Liberia's warring factions for free clearance to
supply food to the area but no reply to our request was
acknowledged".
</P>
<P>
Between 30,000 to 40,000 people, majority of them children,
are "acutely malnourished". "Dozens are living in the bush trying
to find food", one villager told me.

<HEADLINE> France Deplores Latest Inter-Ethnic Violence in Cyprus </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- France today deplored the latest
violence between ethnic Greeks and Turks in Cyprus, in which a
Turkish Cypriot soldier was found shot dead and another wounded
Sunday morning at a guard on the Green Line.
</P>
<P>
"We deplore deeply the violent incident which happened in
Cyprus and which has caused the death of a Turkish Cypriot soldier
and the grave injury of another near the the buffer zone," said
Yves Doutriaux, vice-spokesman of the French Foreign Ministry.
</P>
<P>
France once again called on all sides in Cyprus to keep calm
and exercise restraint while stressing the need to realize a
"global and definitive political solution" to the problem of
Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
A shooting incident took place at a Turkish Cypriot guard near
the city of Famagusta in Cyprus, in which Turkish Cypriot soldiers
were shot at by gunfires from the Greek Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Two Greek Cypriot youths were shot dead by Turkish Cypriot
soldiers in August during demonstrations by Greek Cypriots to
protest the separation of the island.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkey sent its troops to
take control of the northern one third of the east Mediterranean
island following a military coup engineered by the then Greek
junta.

<HEADLINE> Anti-US Aggression Film Wins Award Nomination </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A documentary film depicting
the Chinese army fighting US aggressors in Korea more than 40
years ago has been nominated as the best film in a top Chinese
film award contest, it was announced here today.
</P>
<P>
The film, "Contest: A Record of The War To Resist US Aggression
And Aid Korea", provided for the first time a great deal of
first-hand materials about the Chinese people's volunteers
fighting the US aggression in 1950-53, with some shots recorded by
foreign cameras, according to the China Film Association.
</P>
<P>
A jury consisting of 24 of the most-renowned directors, actors,
actresses and commentators suggested that the film be named the
best documentary film of the 16th Golden Rooster Film Award,
China's academic award, in addition to three more nominees.
</P>
<P>
The association's spokesman said that the film recalls the war
from a modern point of view, exposes the aggressive nature of the
US imperialists, and sings praises of the Chinese people's love
for peace.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Hollywood film "Forrest Gump" was nominated as the
best foreign film of the award, the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
The Oscar winner was one of the top ten films China imported
last year. Chinese and American film traders shared a big profit
from distributing the movie in a market of 1.2 billion population.
</P>
<P>
Chinese experts said that the excellent translation and dubbing
were a main factor for the film to be nominated.
</P>
<P>
Both films were by the August First Film Studio, an important
film producer, affiliated to the People's Liberation Army.
</P>
<P>
Additionally, "Kong Fansen", which praises a model official, and
"Red Cherry", a film about the anti-Facist war, were nominated as
the best feature film.
</P>
<P>
A total of 23 awards, including the best director and the best
actor and actress, will be bestowed when the final decisions are
made next month.
</P>
<P>
China's two other major film awards are the Hundred Flowers
Award, which represents ordinary people's judgement, and the
Ornamental Column Award, which is bestowed every year by the
Ministry of Radio, Film and Television.

<HEADLINE> "Pragmatical Diplomacy" and Survival &AMP; Development of Taiwan (1) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
Beijing, September 9 (Xinhua) -- While continuously expressing
their wishes to ease tension between the two sides of the Taiwan
Straits, some leaders of the Taiwan authorities recently claimed
more than once that Taiwan should stick to its "pragmatical
diplomacy", which they said can enable Taiwan to "have necessary
space for its survival and development".
</P>
<P>
What is the intention of these people who associate
"pragmatical diplomacy" with the survival and development of
Taiwan?
</P>
<P>
It is out of question that Taiwan needs to establish and keep
some contacts with the outside world for its survival and
development.
</P>
<P>
Chinese President Jiang Zemin has made a clear statement in his
"Eight-Point Proposition for Solving the Taiwan Issue": "We hold
no opposition to the development of economic and cultural
relations with a folk nature between Taiwan and foreign
countries."
</P>
<P>
There is no blame if all that the Taiwan authorities are
seeking is just such kind of relations.
</P>
<P>
However, anyone who has made a general examination of the
"pragmatical diplomacy" of the Taiwan authorities in recent years
can find that despite the continuous shift of its focus and means,
the "pragmatical diplomacy" has intended to seek the status of "an
independent and sovereign country" for Taiwan, and to create "two
Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan", instead of earning only
economic and cultural relations.
</P>
<P>
The promoters of the "pragmatical diplomacy" claimed that their
activities were "for the benefit of the people of Taiwan", as well
as "for the survival and development of Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
However, they are actually trying to split Taiwan from the
Chinese territory. This has met resolute opposition from all
Chinese people, including every compatriot from Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Macao, and other overseas areas.
</P>
<P>
If the Taiwan authorities continue to promote a so-called
"pragmatical diplomacy", it will only do great harm to relations
between the two sides of the Taiwan Straits, and do no good for
the survival and development of Taiwan.

<HEADLINE> "Pragmatic Diplomacy" and Survival &AMP; Development of Taiwan (2) </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
In recent years the Taiwan authorities speeded up "pragmatic
diplomacy", advocating "two Chinas" and "one China, one Taiwan".
</P>
<P>
That has not only brought frustration and the withdrawal of
relations across the Taiwan Straits, which had not been the case
for many years, but also damaged the economic development of
Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
This year has witnessed an economic recession on the island.
</P>
<P>
Statistics have shown that Taiwan's economic growth rate in the
first quarter this year was lower than in the last quarter of 1995.
</P>
<P>
The total volume in Taiwan's external trade in the first
quarter fell below that of the same period in 1995.
</P>
<P>
The economic growth rate of 1996 is expected to be 5.76 per
cent, the lowest for the past 13 years.
</P>
<P>
The essence of "pragmatic diplomacy" is to create "two Chinas"
or "one China, one Taiwan", which China resolutely opposes, and
can never be realized.
</P>
<P>
China always adheres to the principle of peace and "one
country, two systems", in unifying the two sides across the Taiwan
Straits, and will never let Taiwan be separated from the
motherland.
</P>
<P>
The situation across the straits can be imagined if the Taiwan
authorities go on with "pragmatic diplomacy" which leads to
separation of the motherland and "independence" for Taiwan. How
can Taiwan say survival and development then?
</P>
<P>
The development of the economy is the fundamental base that
makes other aspects of development meaningful. As an island
economy, Taiwan is heavily depending upon the outside.
</P>
<P>
With the world-wide trend of economical regionalization, and
grouping, as well as the West countries introducing state trade
protectism, Taiwan is now facing many difficulties in further
developing its economy.
</P>
<P>
So enhancing its economic links with inland areas, and seeking
more opportunities in the big market there, has come to be a
certain choice for Taiwan.
</P>
<P>
During the past several years the economic cooperation has been
largely enhanced. According to statistics, last year - even when
there was a political tension - the indirect trade volume between
both sides reached 17.882 billion US dollars, 9.94 percent more
than in 1994, with the favourable balance of trade for Taiwan
nearing 12 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
Now the inland has become the main source of Taiwan's
favourable balance of trade, the economic linkage between both
sides has come to be an important dynamic force for the growth of
Taiwan's economy. All these indicate that only taking the inland
areas as its hinterland can Taiwan have a bright economic
prospect.

<TEXT>
<P>
Under the principle of one China, and in accordance with the
rules of concerned international organizations, Taiwan, using the
name of "China Taipei", has joined the Asian Development Bank,
Asian-Pacific Economic Cooperation and other international
economic organizations. Non-governmental economic and cultural
exchanges between Taiwan and other countries have also development
rapidly.
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has ample space to develop economic, cultural, trade,
scientific and sports exchanges, and non-governmental travel and
sight-seeing services with foreign countries.
</P>
<P>
Under such circumstances, Taiwan authorities still spend large
amounts of money to develop so-called "pragmatic diplomacy". It is
clear that Taiwan authorities have ulterior motives.
</P>
<P>
The space that Taiwan authorities want to expand is for its
"political" and "diplomatic activities", and to split the
motherland, but not the existing wide space for economic and
cultural activities.
</P>
<P>
Judging from this, "pragmatic diplomacy" is not only harmful to
the overall interest of the Chinese nation, in view of Taiwan
compatriots, it is also a waste of money and manpower, and
absolutely a foolish deed.
</P>
<P>
Wouldn't it be better if the Taiwan authorities used the money
for Taiwan's economic development and construction of pubic
facilities?
</P>
<P>
Taiwan has been part of China since ancient times. Though the
two sides across the Taiwan Straits have been separated from each
other since 1949, the position of Taiwan as an inalienable part of
China has never changed. It is futile that Taiwan authorities
attempt to deny and overturn this historic fact.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, though Taiwan authorities used so-called
"dollar diplomacy" to seduce a small number of countries in Latin
America, South America and Africa, to establish "diplomatic"
relations with Taiwan, an overwhelming number of countries in the
world do not recognize Taiwan as an "independent sovereign nation".
</P>
<P>
The attempt by Taiwan authorities to "return to the United
Nations" has also been turned down time and again.
</P>
<P>
It is doubtless that only if Taiwan authorities abandon its
"pragmatic diplomacy" and return to the stand of one China, will
it have a bright future for survival and development, and "Taiwan
people can, together with all other Chinese people, truly and
fully enjoy the international dignity and honor of the
motherland."

Nuclear Safety Administration held that the design, building and
the trial operation of the plant, all met the basic safety
requirements.
</P>
<P>
The official said the formal operation of the Daya Bay Nuclear
Power Plant will not only encourage the economic development of
Guangdong and Hong Kong, it will also produce great impact to
China's future nuclear industry.
</P>

The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Plant has been taking nuclear
safety, radioactive protection and industry safety, as a top
priority during its trial operation, and has successfully solved
some problems that may produced safety issues.

<TEXT>
<P>
TIANJIN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese Vice-Premier Wu
Bangguo today expressed hope that Japan's Toyota Motor Corporation
will completely transfer its technology to its Chinese cooperative
partners.
</P>
<P>
Wu held discussions in Tianjin today with Toyota's president,
Hiroshi Okuda on how to advance Toyota's cooperation with the
Tianjin Automobile Industry Corporation (TAIC).
</P>
<P>
During their meeting, Wu also briefed Okuda on the progress of
the reform of China's state-owned enterprises. He said that the
reform, which is in a critical period, has gained achievements.
</P>
<P>
With the reform, many enterprises have been revitalized, and
China will continue to push forward the reform by carrying out new
methods, Wu added.
</P>
<P>
Touching on the development of China's auto industry, Wu
pointed out that TAIC is one of the four auto manufacturing bases
of China, and also the largest pillar industry of Tianjin. It
plays a decisive role in the development of Tianjin's economy.
</P>
<P>
Wu said that the Chinese government attaches great importance
to cooperation between the two sides, and hopes that both sides
will speed up a current project on auto parts and vehicle engines,
on the principle of mutual benefit.
</P>
<P>
He said he expects that Toyota will transfer its technology to

successful cooperation. The transfer of technology and management
will hopefully promote the development of China's automobile
industry, he said.
</P>
<P>
Okuda promised that Toyota, taking Tianjin as the focal point
of its investment in China, will transfer its technology to
Tianjin completely in the cooperation project, and spare no effort
to advance cooperation.

<HEADLINE> Mubarak: Economic Reform Starts to Reap Fruit </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak
has said that Egypt's economic reform policy has started to reap
its fruit.
</P>
<P>
In an interview published today by the weekly newspaper Mayo,
the mouthpiece of the ruling National Democratic Party, Mubarak
said that 18 new cities have been set up thanks to the economic
reform.
</P>
<P>
Thousands of citizens are now working and living in these
cities, he told the paper.
</P>
<P>
Over the past 15 years, 2.2 million housing units have been
constructed compared to 750,000 units built from 1952 to 1981,
Mubarak said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that Egypt has built more than 39,000 kilometers
of roads connecting the farthest point in the western part of the
country to the south.
</P>
<P>
Great achievements have also been made in the sectors of
electricity, telecommunication and public transport, the president
said.
</P>
<P>
In 1991, Egypt signed an agreement with the World Bank and the
International Monetary Fund (IMF) on the country's economic reform
program. But Egypt actually began taking steps to reform its
faltering economy in early 1980s.
</P>
<P>
Mubarak said that Egypt and the IMF will soon sign a new
agreement on the new stage of Egypt's economic reform.
</P>
<P>
Under the agreement to be signed on October 11, Western

<HEADLINE> HK Unit Trust Industry Back to Net Inflows </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HONG KONG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Hong Kong's unit trust
industry registered gross sales of 491.62 million US dollars in
July, the highest since February 1994, according to the Hong Kong
Investment Funds Association (HKIFA).
</P>
<P>
Out of the total gross sales, 140.83 million US dollars was new
money, accounting for 28.7 percent. It represents the second
highest monthly net inflows recorded this year.
</P>
<P>
Compared with the corresponding month in 1995, gross sales in
July 1996 doubled while net sales surged ten times.
</P>
<P>
Commenting on the sales figures, Andrew Lo, chairman of the
HKIFA, said that after the substantial net outflows in June, the
industry has picked up rapidly, both in terms of gross and net
sales.
</P>
<P>
He said that due to the stronger-than-expected economic growth
data for the first half of the year, the US equities market
experienced a sharp fall in early and mid July, adding that this
had dampened sales for a while.
</P>
<P>
But, he said, inflows had surged substantially since
mid-July. That may be due to the fact that the address by
Greenspan allayed market's concern about immediate interest rates
hikes and resulted in both the US equities and bonds markets
recovering most of the lost grounds.

MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Philippine President Fidel

the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM), during which a
former Muslim rebel leader was elected regional governor.

assembly of the four-province autonomous region.
</P>
<P>
Nur Misuari, chairman of the Moro National Liberation Front
(MNLF), was elected governor of the region as the sole candidate
for the post.

<HEADLINE> Former Belgian Minister Arrested in Case of Murder </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BRUSSELS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Former Belgian Minister of
Pensions Alan Van Der Biest, accused of plotting the assassination
of late President of Belgian Socialist Party Andre Cools in 1991,
was arrested Sunday.
</P>
<P>
According to the local press, Van Der Biest, accused by his
former secretary Richard Taxquet of the assassination, is now
being detained in Lantin prison near Liege, a city in eastern
Belgium.
</P>
<P>
In 1988, Andre Cools found a place for Van Der Biest in the
Ministry of Pensions and in 1990 arranged for him to work as
executive of the Walloon region.
</P>
<P>
However, just before his death, Cools began to show distrust
for Van Der Biest and he sought to separate Biest with his
collaborators, in particular his secretary Taxquet.
</P>
<P>
In addition, Royal Procurator of Belgium announced that a
police officer, who was responsible for the investigation of the
murder of Andre Cools, Sunday resigned from his post.
</P>
<P>
Cools, a former deputy prime minister, was gunned down in a
suspected political assassination in Liege.
</P>
<P>
Reports said Taxquet had told police Van Der Biest ordered the
killing of his party leader. Taxquet was among four men charged
Friday for involvement in Cools' murder.
</P>
<P>
Cools was a leading figure in national politics throughout the
1960s and 1970s and an adviser to the king. He was killed in a
parking lot outside his girlfriend's apartment on July 18, 1991, a
few months after quitting politics.
</P>
<P>
Belgian media reported that police believe Cools was killed by
hired mafia hitmen after he threatened to reveal the underworld
activities of Taxquet and others.
</P>
<P>
Investigators had questioned Van Der Biest before about Cools'
murder, but he always denied involvement.

<P>
LUSAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- About 85 percent of Zambian
registered voters have collected their voter cards, the Zambia
Daily Mail newspaper reported today.
</P>
<P>
Local Government and Housing Minister Bennie Mwiinga was
quoted as denying reports from the opposition that many people
have not collected their cards.
</P>
<P>
He described the exercise as encouraging, saying people have
been educated on their right to vote.
</P>
<P>
Opposition parties are demanding the use of national
registration cards instead of the Isreal-made voter cards
being provided by the government.
</P>
<P>
The opposition parties said that using the national
registration cards will allow more people to vote because a lot
of qualified voters failed to register.
</P>
<P>
In response, Minister without Portfolio Michael Sata has said
that the use of the national registration cards will not be
tolerated in the forthcoming elections because they are not
foolproof.

<TEXT>
<P>
ADDIS ABABA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- African women leaders
were today urged to learn skills that are necessary for their
active and effective participation in all levels of social,
political and economic leadership.
</P>
<P>
The call was made by Francoise Wege, officer in charge of the
African Center of Women, in her statement on behalf of the
Economic Commission for Africa (ECA) at the opening ceremony of
a 5-day training seminar on leadership skills development for
women.
</P>
<P>

from both the Dakar and Beijing platforms for action is that
effort should be made to ensure that women have the skills that
are necessary for their active and effective participation in all
levels of social, political and economic leadership."
</P>
<P>
"The new focus of the ECA gender program is on the
implementation of the Dakar and Beijing platforms for action,
with emphasis on mainstreaming of gender issues into all sectors,
eradication of poverty, economic empowerment of women and
accessing women to the information technology", Wege said.
</P>
<P>
Tadelech Haile Mikael, minister in charge of women affairs in
Ethiopian prime minister's office, stressed in her speech that
African women leaders must have leadership skills in their
struggle for equality and empowerment.
</P>
<P>
She said, African women have many difficulties and challenges
in the implementation of the Dakar and Beijing platforms for
action, and hoped the participants can find, during the seminar,
some solutions for them and overcome the problems faced by them.
</P>
<P>
The 5-day seminar organized by the ECA has participants from
11 eastern and southern African countries including Burundi,
Rwanda, Tanzania, Uganda, Kenya, Zimbabwe, Ethiopia, Eritrea and
Seychelles.

<HEADLINE> S. Korea's Tourism Deficit Hikes Amid Overseas Travel Boom </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SEOUL, September 9 (Xinhua) -- South Korea's tourism deficit in
the first eight months of this year amounted to 1.81 billion
U.S. dollars, up 131.9 percent from the 780.6 million U.S. dollars
registered in the same period last year, the Bank of Korea said
today.
</P>
<P>
The country's incoming payments in the travel industry totaled
3.35 billion U.S. dollars in the January-August period, while
outgoing payments reached 5.16 billion U.S. dollars, according to
the central bank.
</P>
<P>
The bank attributed the huge tourism deficit to a sudden rise
in the number of vacationers going abroad and those pursuing
short-term overseas studies.
</P>
<P>
During the months of July and August, South Korean overseas
travelers spent 1.55 billion U.S. dollars, 19.2 percent more than
the 1.3 billion U.S. dollars recorded in the same period last year.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, foreign visitors to South Korea spent just 904.1
million U.S. dollars in the two-month period.
</P>
<P>
The overseas travel boom began after the 1988 Seoul Olympic
Games, with the number of South Korean tourists going overseas
jumping 54.8 percent in 1989. The growth rate declined after 1991
but rose again in 1994.
</P>
<P>
Last year, South Korea's tourism revenue totaled 5.6 billion
U.S. dollars, while its overseas travel spending rose to 5.92
billion U.S. dollars, posting a deficit of 320 million
U.S. dollars.

<HEADLINE> China's Offshore Oil Tops 10 Million Tons </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The China National Offshore
Oil Corp (CNOOC) announced here today that its offshore crude
output has topped 10 million tons since the beginning of this
year, a record high.
</P>
<P>
A senior CNOOC official puts the annual estimate at 14 million
tons, or an increase of 6 million tons over the 1995 figure.
</P>
<P>
According to CNOOC President Wang Yan, this represents a major
breakthrough in 14 years of China's offshore oil undertaking.
</P>
<P>
The senior official noted that in addition to crude output,
China will still pump 3 billion cu m of offshore natural gas this
year, which will be equivalent to 17 million tons of crude oil.
</P>
<P>
Wang stressed that this should be also attributable to
Sino-overseas cooperation in this regard.
</P>
<P>
To date, CNOOC has signed 119 oil and gas contracts with more
than 60 overseas oil companies worldwide, absorbing a total
overseas investment of 5.24 billion US dollars.
</P>
<P>
The CNOOC source added that through more than a dozen years of
its own efforts and Sino-overseas cooperation, China has so far
discovered over 90 oil and gas bearing structures and verified oil
and gas geological reserves of 1.3 billion tons and 300 billion cu
m respectively.
</P>
<P>
Of the 19 oil and gas fields operational offshore, the Yacheng
13-1 gas field and Liuhua 11-1 oil field in the South China Sea
are the largest, which produce annually 3.4 billion cu m of gas
and 2.5 million tons of crude, respectively. The latter has a
geological crude reserve of about 200 million tons.

<HEADLINE> Growth Rate of China's industry Continues to Slow down in August </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The growth rate of China's
industries continued its slowdown in August because of operational
difficulties and severe flooding in some areas, the State
Statistics Bureau said today.
</P>
<P>
In its monthly report, the Bureau said that China's industrial
production was worth 150.3 billion yuan last month, representing a
real growth of 10.6 percent on an annual basis, and a growth rate
that was 1.6 percentage points lower than in July and the lowest
of the past eight months.
</P>
<P>
From January to August, industrial production was worth 1.21
trillion yuan, up 12.9 percent on a year-to-year basis.
</P>
<P>
The state sector had added value of 85.4 billion yuan, up 3.1
percent from July and 1.5 percentage points lower than for July in
terms of growth rate. The collectively-owned industries grew 17.5
percent on a yearly basis.
</P>
<P>
The growth rates of both heavy and light industries were slowed
down on a year-to-year basis, the bureau said.
</P>
<P>
Heavy industry had an output value of 89.2 billion yuan in
August, 9.9 percent more than in the same month last year, down
one percentage point from July.
</P>
<P>
The report showed light industry produced 61.1 billion
yuan-worth of goods last month, up 11.6 percent from the same
month of the previous year, with a growth rate that was down 2.3
percentage points from July.
</P>
<P>
In August, the growth of household applicance, machinery, and
electrical goods production slowed down, while energy and raw
materials maintained their stable growth.
</P>
<P>
China's rate of sales vs. production was 96.08 percent in
August, the highest this year. The report attributes the
improvement to the product mix and the measures of limiting
production of some goods.

CAIRO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak

maintained.
</P>
<P>
"It is part of our principle to resist attempts that aim at

Egypt has said that Turkey's move is considered a flagrant
violation of Iraq's sovereignty and territorial integrity.

<HEADLINE> Guizhou Speeds Up Power Construction </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
GUIYANG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Guizhou Province is speeding
up power construction to build itself into a power-supplying
center in southwest China.
</P>
<P>
According to local officials, construction work on two large
hydropower stations on the Nanpan River, on the border of Guizhou
and the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, is going on
smoothly. Also underway is a study of power resources of the
Wujiang River, which runs through the whole province from west to
east.
</P>
<P>
Following the completion of a hydropower station with three
170,000-kw generating units last year, construction of another new
station with a generating capacity of 530,000 kw will soon start
on the Wujiang River.
</P>
<P>
The province has also sped up construction of thermal power
stations. Work on the Anshun Thermal Power Station, one of the
State key construction projects during the Ninth Five-Year-Plan
and the province's biggest, began in April this year. Two
300,000-kw generating units will be installed during the
first-stage, with investment estimated at 3.72 billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Currently, the province has a total installed generating
capacity of 4.34 million kw and produces 22.6 billion kwh of
electricity annually.
</P>
<P>
The country's energy development strategy of "sending
electricity from the western to the eastern region" has boosted
power construction in this inland province, said local officials.
</P>
<P>
The Ministry of Power Industry, the State Development Bank,
along with Guangdong, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces, and the
Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region have set up a company for jointly
funding exploration of power resources in the southwestern region.
</P>
<P>
According to provincial officials, Guizhou transmits more than
two billion kwh of electricity to Guangdong and Sichuan provinces
a year, and helps Yunnan and Guangxi transmit more than three
billion kwh to Guangdong via its Tianshengqiao Power Grid
annually.

PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The following are major news
items in leading French newspapers today:
</P>
<P>
Liberation:
</P>
<P>
-- Prime Minister Alain Juppe is under fire from the right-wing
camp itself, with the ruling majority parties divided over all his
policies including those on tax, election reform and economy.
</P>
<P>
Former Interior Minister Charles Pasqua said last weekend that
"the route followed by Juppe is no good." Francois Leotard,
president of the Union pour la Democratie Francaise, which is the
second largest right-wing party, said he refused to belong to "a
majority of barracks."
</P>
<P>
-- In Belgium, the arrest on Sunday of former Regional Minister
Alain Van Der Biest, accused of having ordered the assassination
of former Minister of State Andre Cools in 1991, provoked an
earthquake in the country. This event, plus the recent discovery
of the case of serial child kidnaper Marc Dutroux, led people to
question the capability of the country's justice departments.
</P>
<P>
Le Figaro:
</P>
<P>
-- Scientists have blamed false hormones existing in
environment for the lowering of fertility among the male
population and many animals. The nearly 50 percent lowering of
fertility among men could be linked with the female hormone of
estrogen.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, a book entitled "Our Stolen Future"
denounces the increasing presence of this kind of artificial
hormone in environment and has caused the beginning of a panic.
</P>
<P>
-- Turkey's plan to set up a buffer zone on its border with
Iraq has triggered an outcry from all countries in the region. The
six countries of the Council of Cooperation of the Gulf denounced
"foreign interference in Iraq by some neighboring states." Iran
said the buffer zone could cause problems between Turkey and its
neighbors. Syria said the action will have negative consequences
on Turkish-Arab relations.

PARIS, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Algeria today condemned Turkey
for creating a buffer zone in northern Iraq, calling it "a
flagrant and unacceptable violation of the territorial integrity
of this brother country."
</P>
<P>
"Whatever its motive, its duration and its extension in the
(Iraqi) territory, this project cannot take advantage of any
justification in the eyes of the rules and principles of the
established international law and the charter of the United
Nations," Agence France Presse quoted an Algerian foreign ministry
communique as saying.
</P>
<P>
The communique said that "Algeria expresses its opposition to
and its rejection of this project which represents a grave attack
on the sovereignty and territorial integrity of Iraq and
introduces new factors of instability in a region already roughly
tested."
</P>
<P>
It said that Algeria calls for an "immediate reconsideration of
this measure... in the superior interests of good neighborliness,
cooperation and indispensable understanding."
</P>
<P>
Turkish troops are setting up a buffer zone in northern Iraq to
prevent the penetration by Kurdish forces, according to reports
from Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Vietnam to Restrict Medical Equipment Imports </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam will introduce a
regulation to place the import of medical equipment under tighter
control as part of an effort to protect domestic products and
consumers, Vietnam News Agency reported today.
</P>
<P>
At present, Vietnam imports 40 million U.S. dollars worth of
medical equipment each year from other Asian countries, western
Europe and the United States. About 80 percent of the modern
medical equipment used in Vietnam is imported.
</P>
<P>
However, some of these imports are of low quality and imports
by individual hospitals have gone out of government control.
</P>
<P>
The new regulation will toughen government control on the
import of medical equipment by adjusting taxes and imposing import
license restrictions.

<HEADLINE> Shanghai, London to Have More Financial Cooperation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- London will increase
cooperation with Shanghai in the financial area, London's Mayor
John Chalstrey said, during a 5-day visit here, that ended on
Sunday.
</P>
<P>
The two cities are to share financial information, technical
how-how, management expertise and other business ideas, according
to an agreement signed here over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
A stable and rapidly-growing Chinese economy has made the
securities market here more attractive than those elsewhere,
Chalstrey pointed out, and said that he and his entourage were
impressed by the rapid development of the securities market here.
</P>
<P>
According to the agreement, to improve the securities business,
London and Shanghai will exchange inspection teams and financial
data, hold seminars and invite experts for lectures.
</P>
<P>
Official data show that Shanghai did nearly 5.52 trillion yuan
(about 664.5 billion US dollars) in securities transactions last
year, up from merely 30 million yuan in 1990. In the first eight
months of this year, turnover reached nearly 1.32 trillion yuan.
</P>
<P>
Another study shows that more than nine million investors from
all over China have opened trading accounts in Shanghai, and the
number is rising at an average of 20,000 people each trading day.

<HEADLINE> WFP Food Aid to Arrive in Liberia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
ROME, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The first truckload of emergency
food from the World Food Program (WFP) is scheduled to arrive
today in Tubmanburg, Liberia, where more than half of the city's
population is suffering from extreme hunger.
</P>
<P>
The food, consisting of a mixture of corn, soya, beans, oil and
sugar, is to feed the hungary and malnourished children in this
city in the dense West African jungle 70 kilometers northwest of
the capital Monrovia.
</P>
<P>
"The children have swollen bellies, their eyes are swollen,
their skin is cracked, and in some cases the flesh on the feet has
fallen off," the WFP Country Director in Liberia Tarek Elguindi
said.
</P>
<P>
Elguindi, who visited the city Saturday with a United Nations
inter-agency team, said the local people have been forced to
forage in the jungle and subsisted mainly on tree leave soup and
a wild red flower. The market is virtually empty with only small
amounts of palm nut oil, green peppers and dry cassava from the
jungle available.
</P>
<P>
" I've never seen such a massive number of hungry people,"
Elguindi said. "One person on the team said it was worse than
Somalia in terms of severity and the concentration of the hungry
people. When I saw the situation, I started to cry and I saw
tears in the eyes of the other team members."
</P>
<P>
WFP will begin a full-scale feeding on Tuesday when a fleet of
about six trucks expected to arrive with rations for about 7,500
people that will last about two weeks each.
</P>
<P>
The last WFP food deliveries to the area were at the end of
January. Since then, renewed factional fighting has left
Tubmanburg cut off from international relief.
</P>
<P>
WFP, other U.N. agencies and non-governmental organizations
were allowed to enter Tubmanburg following a series of
negotiations with field commanders of the rival factions last
week.

<HEADLINE> No More Yellow Cards for Green Sanya </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
SANYA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China's southernmost city of
Sanya, on Hainan Island, was given a "yellow card" ten years ago
by the provincial government for failing to meet its tree-planting
quota, and in fact it was bleak, barren, and suffered from
sandstorms sometimes.
</P>
<P>
Today, however, nearly half the city is covered with luxurious
vegetation, and the barren mountains are taking on a green look,
and a group sent by the central government gave it a clean bill of
health, saying that the city has a first-class natural environment
and atmosphere.
</P>
<P>
Sanya began the facelift in 1988, when the central government
approved Hainan's status as a Special Economic Zone to attract
foreign investment, and the provincial government urged the city
to become an international tourist city.
</P>
<P>
Since then, the city has gotten more people to plant trees
along the coast, in villages and barren mountains, and, in the
past eight years, has afforested 546,000 hectares of idle land,
with citizens voluntarily planting 3.59 million trees.
</P>
<P>
The city has also cracked down hard on the random cutting of
trees or the crime of arson, with 51 of such cases having been
solved and 380 people arrested or fined.
</P>
<P>
In 1994, an international airport was finished and this year a
holiday festival was held in the city. To meet the demands of the
airport and the festival, the city launched a large "green
campaign", planting trees along 18 new roads, and encouraging
hotels to invest in greening projects.

<HEADLINE> UNDP Official in Zambia Stresses Environmental </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LUSAKA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Poverty could not be tackled
without proper preservation of the environment which had been
degraded to a big extent through unorthodox farming methods.
</P>
<P>
This is the view of Gary Davis, resident representative of the
United Nations Development Program (UNDP) in Zambia.
</P>
<P>
In an interview with the local press at the weekend, Davis
said that UNDP would embark on educating Zambian farmers on
methods of preserving water particularly in catchment areas in
order to overcome effects of drought in times of poor rainfall.
</P>
<P>
Davis noted that Agro-forestry was the best method of farming
because re-planting of trees would retain soil fertility.
</P>
<P>
Zambia is suffering soil degradation from tree felling and
unreasonably planned farming, particularly in areas surrounding
the urban centers. The government has urged the whole nation to
protect the environment to avoid further degradation.

BONN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A reunited Germany will never
raise any territorial claim, President Roman Herzog said in Berlin
today.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to an annual gathering of the German nationals who
left the areas which are not part of Poland and Russia to resettle
in Germany after World War II, Herzog said that the German
government would not attempt to reclaim the ownership of these
areas because it has already been defined by international law.
</P>
<P>
These areas include Hinterpommer, Ostpreussen and Oberschiesien.
</P>
<P>
"These areas belong to our historical and cultural heritage,
but they do not belong to our nation," Herzog said.
</P>
<P>
He stressed that Germans should draw lessons from the last war,
admitting that Germany had committed terrible crimes though the
German people were victims too.
</P>
<P>
More than 15 million people left those areas at the end of the
war to resettle in Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg and some two
million of them lost their lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
The German president also called on Europeans to cooperate and
concentrate on building a united Europe, which he said would help
guarantee a lasting peace and co-existence on the continent.

<HEADLINE> China's Shipbuilding Business Up In First Half </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China's shipbuilding industry
saw steady growth in the first half of the year, with ship-repairs
showing the best performance, up about 30 percent over the same
period last year.
</P>
<P>
The China State Shipbuilding Corporation (CSSC) repaired a
total of 540 ships during the period, doing more than 900 million
yuan in business, up 31.5 percent, company figures show.
</P>
<P>
Foreign vessels accounted for 70 percent of the ships repaired
and 80 percent of output value, and represented a 66.7 percent
increase over the same 1995 period.
</P>
<P>
Special repair work on container ships, liquefied gas ships,
and oil tankers was off to a good start, said Shi Fengjun, an
engineer with CSSC's production bureau.
</P>
<P>
From January to July this year, CSSC built ships of
784,000-dwt, with output value going up by 20.5 percent, to 6.32
billion yuan.
</P>
<P>
The low price of shipbuilding and ship repairs in China has
proven attractive to foreign shipping companies, especially those
of Greece, Ukraine, and the Republic of Korea, he added.
</P>
<P>
So far this year, CSSC has had orders for building and
repairing ships of 1.6 million-dwt.

<HEADLINE> Israel's Credit Rating Reapproved </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Israel's credit rating has
been reapproved in the international markets A and A3 by
credit rating companies Moodys Investors Service and Standard and
Poors, the Jerusalem Post reported today.
</P>
<P>
The companies Sunday informed Treasury Accountant General Shai
Talmon of their rating decision. The announcement came two days
before the government issues on the Eurobonds are scheduled to be
underwritten at a ceremony in Jerusalem.
</P>
<P>
The ratings are crucial in Israel's attempt to raise funds
abroad. The decisions by Moodys and Standard and Poors were
welcomed as "a voice of confidence" by the Finance Ministry,
which hopes to sell up to 250 million dollars worth of bonds by
the end of this year, which is the first part of a three-year bid
to raise 750 million dollars.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, a delegation of the International Monetary Fund
(IMF) currently here will present its initial report on
Wednesday. Although the ratings reapproval is likely to be looked
on favorably, yet the IMF report is still expected to focus on
the economic slowdown, visibly since the new government came to
power.
</P>
<P>
Some economists and politicians are warning of the
early signs of a recession in the country.

<TEXT>
<P>
HAIKOU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- More than 30 species of rare
plants that were thought to have disappeared have been found in
south China's Hainan Province, thanks to ten years' work at
protecting rare plants.
</P>
<P>
Hainan has more than 1,400 different trees and bushes,
accounting for 28.6 percent of the country's total. Of these, 458
are designated rare plants by the state.
</P>
<P>
The province also has more than 2,500 types of medicinal
plants, accounting for 30 percent of the country's total.
</P>
<P>
It is estimated that more than 200 rare plants disappeared or
were in danger of becoming extinct over the past 40 years because
of excessive cutting of tropical trees.
</P>
<P>
The province began planting trees on mountains in the late
1980s and has set up 22 forest protection zones and three plant
cultivation zones on 120,000 hectares of land, and research
institutes and enterprises have built plant gardens to protect
rare plants.
</P>
<P>
Hainan issued its first regulation on forest protection in
1994, and this year has increased the number of forest rangers to
more than 1,000, up from 700, to protect its forest reserves.

<HEADLINE> Sanctions on Burundi to Be Partially Lifted </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Seven African countries
have agreed to ease sanctions imposed on Burundi after the July
25 coup to allow humanitarian aid to reach refugees.
</P>
<P>
The information reaching here today said the seven states
approved of partially lifting the trade ban on Burundi in the
northern Tanzanian town of Arusha last Saturday.
</P>
<P>
At the meeting, Tanzania, Rwanda, Ethiopia, Uganda, Kenya,
Zaire and Zambia also agreed that essential supplies, including
fuel, could be moved to diplomats and other foreign organizations
in Burundi, who would be allowed to travel in and out of the
country.
</P>
<P>
Fuel in the landlocked Burundi has been in severely short
supply following the sanctions, while other imported necessities
are fast running out.
</P>
<P>
The seven African states, of whom only Ethiopia and Uganda
have no direct passages to Burundi, imposed air, water and land
blockade on Burundi in early August for the restoration of
democracy in that tiny central African state.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, former Tanzanian president Julius Nyerere, who is
the mandated mediator of the Burundi crisis, has agreed to work
for a regional summit soon to reconsider the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
About 150,000 people have died in the conflicts between Hutus
and Tutsis in Burundi since 1993, when the country's first
democratically elected Hutu president was killed in an attempted
army coup.

<HEADLINE> 3rd Force Emerging in India's Congress Party </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Between the camp led by
President of the Congress party P.V. Narasimha Rao and that of
dissidents, a third force is emerging in India's major opposition
party with a demand for bringing younger and cleaner faces to the
fore, the Congress party sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The sources said that the third force's agenda was in response
to the widespread public disaffection to the country's political
system in general and the need to steer clear of politicians with
sullied images.
</P>
<P>
Former Indian Prime Minister Rao and some of his former cabinet
ministers have been accused of involvement in various corruption
cases and scandals.
</P>
<P>
An informal group of younger MPs of the Congress party demanded
a thorough debate in the party fora on corruption while former
chief minister of Kerala state, A.K. Antony, has started to sound
MPs both within and outside the party on adopting the new agenda.
</P>
<P>
The third force's revival plan for the Congress party comprises
three basic parts: reunification of the Congress party by bringing
back all those who have left since 1969, a sustained campaign
against corruption and reorientation of the party.

BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Vice-President Rong Yiren said
here today that frequent visits by Chinese and Fijian leaders and
parliaments have helped bilateral understanding and friendship.
</P>
<P>
Rong was meeting here today with Senator Ratu Iloilo, president
of Fiji's Senate, and his party.
</P>
<P>
Rong told the group that China believes that all countries, big

other's internal affairs, as well as the important role Fiji plays
in Asia-Pacific affairs.

had some achievements, and that a number of projects which China
helped build in Fiji have shown good results.
</P>
<P>
He expressed the hope that the two-way trade will improve
since it is in the interest of both countries.
</P>
<P>
Iloilo spoke highly of China's ancient culture and recent
economic development, and said that his country would like to
further its ties with China in various fields, especially in trade
and economic cooperation.

<HEADLINE> NZ Airlines Goes into Liquidation </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
WELLINGTON, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A fledging New Zealand
airlines, Kiwi International Airlines, announced today it is going
into liquidation after only two years in operation.
</P>
<P>
Kiwi chief executive and founder Ewan Wilson said the decision
came after a four-hour meeting yesterday attended by directors and
legal and financial advisers.
</P>
<P>
The announcement left 260 Kiwi staff jobless and stranded
hundreds of Kiwi passengers on both sides of the Tasman.
</P>
<P>
Wilson said the passengers on today's canceled flights would be
offered a special fare deal arranged through the Australian
carrier Qantas. But other passengers booked on future Kiwi flights
would now become unsecured creditors.
</P>
<P>
The airlines started a once-a-week trans-Tasman charter service
in 1994. It offered discounted fares, forcing its bigger
competitors Air New Zealand and Qantas to cut their own prices to
match those of Kiwi International.
</P>
<P>
Kiwi International expanded rapidly in the past two years on
the back of its popular "peanut and cola" cheap fares costing less
than 400 dollars (272 US dollars) for a trans-Tasman round trip.
</P>
<P>
A few days ago, Wilson admitted that Kiwi International
expanded too fast. He said today that the airlines was unable to
"continue to remain in business."

<P>
SHENYANG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Some imperial treasures from
the early Qing Dynasty (1644-1911) in Shenyang, in northeast
China's Liaoning Province, are put on display for the public for
the first time.
</P>
<P>
A group of 133 items that include garments, paintings,
calligraphy, lacquer work, sculptures, and porcelain are on
display in the newly-built Hall of Treasures as of today.
</P>
<P>
Also included are the ceremonial robe of a queen, a picture
painted by Gao Qipei, a famous artist of the Qing, and Nurhachi's
jade, with inscriptions in both the Han and Manchu languages.
</P>
<P>
Nurhachi was a tribal leader who unified the Nuzhen (ancestors
of Manchu) tribes and paved the way to the founding of the Qing
Dynasty. He also built the imperial palaces in Shenyang, the
Manchu-style palaces that still exist.
</P>
<P>
The palaces were started in 1625 and have more than 10,000
treasures which have been kept in storage vaults for nearly a
hundred years because of a lack of display areas.
</P>
<P>
On the occasion of the 70th anniversary of the founding of the
Imperial Palace Museum in Shenyang, a hall built with two million
yuan is now ready for use as a display area for the treasures.

financial institutions and therefore are prohibited from accepting
deposits or giving loans.
</P>
<P>
"However, many rural cooperative foundations have been accruing
savings deposits under the pretext of floating shares," the
official said.
</P>
<P>
The so-called shareholders do not participate in managing funds
and are not exposed to risks, but the foundations provide them
with higher interest rates than those offered by credit
cooperatives.
</P>
<P>
"These are considered financial violations," the official
pointed out.
</P>
<P>
Rural cooperative foundations are no longer allowed to handle
savings deposits and those that borrow or loan money on a fairly
large scale should be incorporated or turned into rural credit
cooperatives after they are re-worked, the State Council said.
</P>
<P>
Those foundations that do not want to be merged or turned into
rural credit cooperatives must immediately stop these activities,
the State Council said.

<HEADLINE> Satellite Education Channel Covers Ningxia </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
YINCHUAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Success and prosperity has
been beamed into the lives of one of China's least developed areas
-- thanks to the wonders of satellite TV.
</P>
<P>
Seventy-two percent of the population in northwest China's
Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region are able to receive education
courses via satellite television programs.
</P>
<P>
Ningxia, one of the least developed areas in China, still has
more than one million residents living below the poverty line.
</P>
<P>
Statistics showed that the whole region had 33 percent of
primary school teachers and 46 percent of middle school teachers
who were not qualified for their jobs in 1986.
</P>
<P>
Since then, governments at all levels have spent 14 million
yuan building the Ningxia Education Television Station, and a TV
relay station to cover the 13 counties and cities in the area
irrigated by the Yellow River, which flows through Ningxia.
</P>
<P>
In southern Ningxia's Guyuan, Longde, Yanchi, and five other
counties, where the education channel cannot be received, six
relay stations, and 158 ground satellite stations have been built.
</P>
<P>
Since 1986 the education channel has provided courses for
training 8,000 primary school teachers and 5,700 middle school
teachers. As a result, 82 percent of the middle school teachers
are now qualified for their jobs.
</P>
<P>
Traditionally, local farmers did not grow cotton. But now they
grow the crop on large areas, helped with information from the
education channel, and the guidance of technicians.
</P>
<P>
The education channel has also taught farmers how to build
vegetable greenhouses. By the end of last year, farmers in Guyuan
county, one of the poorest areas in China, had built over 800
greenhouses and doubled their incomes.
</P>
<P>
One farmer said, "To become prosperous, we must take the path
of boosting the farming sector by means of science and
technology. To enjoy a relatively comfortable living standard, we
must rely on the education channel."

<P>
SHIJIAZHUANG, September 9 (Xinhua) -- North China's Hebei
Province is the third most attractive location, after Shanghai and
Guangdong, in the eyes of investors from the United States, a new
survey has revealed.
</P>
<P>
Foreign investors have scored healthy profits by taking
advantage of Hebei's proximity to the Chinese capital of Beijing
and the coastal city of Tianjin, preferential investment policies,
and sound services, which also brought in more overseas investment
to the province.
</P>
<P>
The province has already signed 9,000 contracts with overseas
investors, involving pledged investments of 11.52 billion US
dollars since last year.
</P>
<P>
Hebei is located in the central part of the third key
development area of Bohai, following the Pearl River delta and the
Yangtze river delta, set by the State Council.
</P>
<P>
The province has set up special departments to handle any
queries or complaints from overseas investors and ensure their
interests, authorities say.
</P>
<P>
A large number of major foreign organizations have entered
Hebei, such as US car giant General Motors, Siemens of Germany,

<HEADLINE> Iran Condemns GCC Statement on Disputed Islands </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran today condemned a
Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) statement on three disputed
islands in the Persian Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said
that the Foreign Ministers Session of the GCC concluded in the
Saudi capital of Riyadh Sunday was supposed to review the latest
U.S. attacks on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
But, he noted, the results of the meeting turned out to deviate
the public attention of the Moslem nations in the region from the
looming danger of the United States and Israel in the area.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman underlined that such a stance adopted by the
foreign ministers of the six Gulf states was going to complicate
the issue further.
</P>
<P>
He stated that though not passing a pre-judgement in
association with Iran's sovereignty over the Iranian islands of
the Greater and Lesser Tonbs and Abu Musa in the Gulf, the GCC
meeting should have adopted a stance on advising the United Arab
Emirates (UAE) into a continuation of bilateral negotiations.
</P>
<P>
Iran and the UAE have both claimed legal rights of the three
strategically-important islands for a considerably long period of
time.
</P>
<P>
Mohammadi noted that by taking such a stand, the GCC cannot
revoke the legitimate sovereignty of Iran over the three islands.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman once again stated that Iran was ready to
continue negotiations with the UAE in order to clear up the
differences existing between the two nations.
</P>
<P>
Abu Musa, Greater Tonbs and Lesser Tonbs are strategically
located on the route of two thirds of the world's oil reserves
near the Strait of Hormuz in the Gulf.
</P>
<P>
Iran alleged early this year that it had completed defensive
projects on all of its strategically important islands in
the Gulf.

COLOMBO, September 9 (Xinhua)-- The Sixth International Gem and

</P>
<P>
The National Gem and Jewelry Authority and Sri Lanka Export

<HEADLINE> Iran Opposes Turkish Proposal of Creating Security </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TEHRAN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Iran today voiced its
opposition to the Turkish proposal of establishing a security
zone in northern Iraq.
</P>
<P>
Mahmoud Mohammadi, spokesman for the Foreign Ministry, said
that the creation of a security zone by Turkey was a
violation of Iraqi territorial integrity.
</P>
<P>
"The move made by Turkey was contrary to good intention
of a neighboring nation, in violation to international codes of
practice and a measure not acceptable to Iran," he was
quoted by the official news agency IRNA as saying.
</P>
<P>
The spokesman noted that such a measure would be a cause for
escalation of tension in the region.
</P>
<P>
Hassan Rowhani, First Vice-Speaker of the Parliament, expressed
concern over Turkey's plan for the security zone in northern
Iraq.
</P>
<P>
English daily "Iran News" today carried a statement by the
vice-speaker, who held that Turks' tactics in northern Iraq are
"incorrect" and will cause more tension and friction there.
</P>
<P>
He criticized Ankara, saying "it is meaningless for any
country to set up buffer zones under the pretext of security
consideration."
</P>
<P>
Turkey earlier said it plans to enforce a security zone
as wide as 20 kilometers along mountainous borders with Iraq to
guard against attacks by Kurdish rebels operating from northern
Iraq.

<HEADLINE> Elections Begin in Muslim Mindanao in Philippines </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Some 904,693 voters are
expected to go to the polls today to elect a regional governor, a
vice governor and 21 members of the assembly of the Autonomous
Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM) in the southern Philippines.
</P>
<P>
It is the first test of whether the peace pact signed a week
ago by President Fidel Ramos and Nur Misuari, chairman of the Moro
National Liberation Front (MNLF), is real, binding and holding.
</P>
<P>
About 10,000 MNLF members will participate in the elections,
the country's first computerized polls.
</P>
<P>
As the only candidate for governor, Misuari needs just one vote
to claim victory. He will cast his ballot at an elementary school
in Jolo, Sulu province.
</P>
<P>
Misuari has promised that he will "rehash the system of the
ARMM, make it corruption-free and tailored-fit to the expectations
of the constituency." He said that his priorities would also
include tackling the clan wars that have been pervasive in the
region.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, incumbent Speaker of the ARMM regional legislative
assembly Guimid Matalam is running unopposed for vice governor.
</P>
<P>
Although President Ramos and Misuari predicted that the
elections would be peaceful, the police and the military
heightened their alert status Sunday night in at least 15 hot
spots in the ARMM in case of any disorder and violence.
</P>
<P>
Under the peace agreement signed between the government and the
MNLF, the ARMM, which now comprises four provinces, will be
expanded three years later through a plebiscite in which residents
of 14 province and nine cities in Mindanao will decide whether
they join the new autonomous region.

<HEADLINE> More Chinese Riding Planes, Busses Instead Of Trains </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The decline in the number of
train passengers is perhaps the most outstanding phenomenon in
modern China and reflects a new competitive trend in the
transportation market, analysts point out.
</P>
<P>
Beginning late last year, passengers started noticing that they
no longer had to queue for half a day just to buy a train ticket,
only to be crammed into a packed train when they did get it.
</P>
<P>
Statistics show that railway traffic at this year's peak season
during the Lunar New Year, dropped by 4.7 percent, while that of
highways and airlines increased by 4.5 and 21 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
In the first six months of the year, train traffic continued
the downturn trend.
</P>
<P>
The trend is mainly attributed to the rapid growth in the air
and highway sectors, which have also taken advantage of a 50
percent increase in train fares last October, experts noted.
</P>
<P>
Between 1991 and 1995, China built a total of 92,000 kilometers
of highways and roads, bringing a 55 percent growth in the number
of bus passengers, while the number of air passengers had an
annual growth of 20 percent.
</P>
<P>
Confronted by fierce competition, the railways are making a
greater effort to sharpen their competitive edge. The rail line
linking Shanghai and Nanjing, which is China's busiest and which
faces a strong challenge from modern roads, has been upgraded, and
a new type of train is being used that can go 160 kilometers per
hour.
</P>
<P>
At the same time, more ticket booking offices are being
computerized, while the highway sector, not to be outdone, is busy
improving itself by providing more comfortable vehicles and
constantly improving service.

was one of the most wanted rebel operatives in Colombo.
</P>

Sri Maha Bodhi Shrine and ram through all security barriers on
their way to the target, the sources added.
</P>
<P>

61 million baht (2.4 million U.S. dollars) for the Interior
Ministry, and 15 million baht (0.6 million U.S. dollars) for the
Committee for Protection of Children.
</P>
<P>
The Education Ministry is given the bulk of the budget because
education is believed to be an effective way to give sex workers a
new value that helps them make a better choice in life, Chatchai
said.
</P>
<P>
He noted that the government's move to increase penalty for
those found visiting prostitutes will also contribute to reducing
the sex trade in the country.

<HEADLINE> Thailand, Laos Plan Border Talks </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Thailand and Laos Sunday
agreed to discuss technical questions pertaining to their border
demarcation in early December and to begin putting down border
markers in disputed areas in January, the Bangkok Post reported
today.
</P>
<P>
Thai Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Amnuay Virawan
and Lao Foreign Minister Somsavat Lengsavat signed the agreement
in Songkhla in southern Thailand and pledged to carry out the task
following talks to thrash out outstanding problems along the
1,810-kilometer common border between the two countries.
</P>
<P>
"The Thai government wants to resolve all problems, especially
the boundary problems, in order to build stability and trust
between the two countries," Amnuay was quoted as saying by the
report.
</P>
<P>
Somsavat said that the settlement of the boundary question
would bring peace and freedom to the region, according to the
report.
</P>
<P>
The two countries showed their commitment to settling boundary
problems by agreeing to Laos' initiative to upgrade the mechanism
set up to deal with the issue.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay and Somsavat Sunday chaired what was the first meeting
of the Thai-Lao Joint Boundary Commission, successor to the Joint
Boundary Committee that was chaired by deputy foreign ministers of
the two countries.
</P>
<P>
Amnuay stressed that a technical working group set up by the
Boundary Commission would hold the first meeting before December
6.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the sixth Joint Commission for Broad-Based Economic
Cooperation, also chaired by the two foreign ministers Sunday,
agreed to upgrade one checkpoint to international status, and to
open eight more checkpoints along the Thai-Lao border soon.
</P>
<P>
The checkpoint being upgraded to international status links
Sayaboury in Laos with Muang Ngun in Thailand's Nan province.
Somsavat also outlined Lao's plans to upgrade Savannakhet,
Champassak, Huaychay, and Khammouane as international checkpoints.
</P>
<P>
Landlocked Laos, preparing for its full membership of the
Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) next year, has
proposed that international checkpoints be authorized to issue
visas.
</P>
<P>
Laos also indicated its readiness to do so at the
Vientiane-Nong Khai crossing of the Mekong river and at Wattay
airport in Vientiane.

<HEADLINE> Japan's Current Account Surplus in July Falls 27.3 Percent </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
TOKYO, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Japan's current account surplus
in July dropped 27.3 percent from a year earlier to 568.2 billion
yen (5.2 billion U.S. dollars), the Japanese Finance Ministry said
today.
</P>
<P>
Japan's monthly current account surplus has continued to fall
since December 1994 and is expected to continue to show a downward
trend for the time being, the ministry said.
</P>
<P>
Japan posted a surplus of 730.1 billion yen (6.6 billion
dollars) in merchandise trade, down 26.4 percent, while services
trade left a deficit of 691.3 billion yen (6.3 billion dollars),
compared with the 457.8-billion-yen (4.2 billion dollars) deficit
a year before.
</P>
<P>
This represented the 20th consecutive monthly fall in the
surplus in goods and services trade.
</P>
<P>
Import growth has been far outpacing increases in exports, and
the deficit in services trade has been on an upward trend, the
ministry said.
</P>
<P>
The current account balance measures the flow of goods and
services as well as investment income and other monetary
transfers.

<HEADLINE> Nepali Opposition to Decide on Treaty with India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
KATHMANDU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Nepal's main opposition is
likely to finalize its stand over an important water development
treaty on a Nepal-India border river today after five days of
extensive discussions among the party leadership.
</P>
<P>
The Central Committee of the Communist Party of Nepal (united
Marxist Leninist, CPN-UML) began its meeting last Wednesday to
work out the party's decision on the Mahakali treaty, which was
signed last February at the prime minister level in New Delhi and
has been registered in the parliament for ratification.
</P>
<P>
The opposition party's stand on the treaty, which has been
hailed earlier by officials here as a watershed on Nepal-India
cooperation in water resources development, will be crucial to its
ratification.
</P>
<P>
CPN-UML, the single largest party in the parliament, holds 88
seats in the powerful 205-seat lower house while the treaty needs
at least a two-thirds majority support for ratification.
</P>
<P>
The CPN-UML party has called on all its MPs for a parliamentary
party meeting today to discuss the Mahakali issue and wait for the
leadership's decision, party sources said.
</P>
<P>
The ongoing central committee meeting of the party will make
its final decision today on whether to support the treaty in the
parliament, a senior CPN-UML leader said.
</P>
<P>
The Nepal-India treaty on the integrated development of the
Mahakali river, which lies on Nepal's western border, provides
framework arrangements of cost-benefit sharing on future hydro
projects on the river between the two countries, according to
Nepali water resources officials.
</P>
<P>
However, there is strong resistance to the treaty in Nepal
claiming that it provides fewer benefits for Nepal than that for
India.
</P>
<P>
It was reported that a majority of the CPN-UML leadership
favored a conditional ratification after some necessary revisions
to the treaty through exchange of letters between the two
governments.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, the coalition government here is planning to present
the treaty to a joint session of the parliament on coming Thursday
for ratification, a newspaper quoted a source of the parliamentary
secretariat as saying today.

<HEADLINE> Excessive Ozone Harmful to People: Thai Experts </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BANGKOK, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Excessive ozone in the air
close to the ground may be harmful to people's health, Thai
experts were quoted as saying by local newspapers today.
</P>
<P>
Ozone, believed by many to be good for health, could actually
be a toxic substance, according to experts from the Pollution
Control Department under the Ministry of Science, Technology and
Environment.
</P>
<P>
In the high atmosphere, ozone screens out ultraviolet rays from
sunlight and prevents it from reaching the earth and inflicting
skin diseases on humans, they say.
</P>
<P>
But close to the ground, ozone may occur from the reaction
between hydrocarbon substances evaporating from benzine petrol and
nitrogen oxide generated from the burning of fossil fuels, the
experts noted.
</P>
<P>
High-level ozone may damage human respiratory organs and eye
tissues, they said.
</P>
<P>
The newspapers reported that residents living in downwind
districts of Bangkok are being exposed to a high level of ozone,
especially in the northern suburbs of Bangkok like the Rangsit
area.
</P>
<P>
The chemical reaction among waste gases emitted from vehicles
generally takes place slowly to produce ozone and wind helps to
move the pollution from inner Bangkok, the experts said.
</P>
<P>
They warned that more high-rise buildings in Bangkok would
block air circulation and ventilation.

<HEADLINE> Indian Government Weighs Cap on Public Debt </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The Indian government is
proposing a statutory ceiling on the level of public debt as part
of its strategy to put in place a sound and efficient fiscal
management system, Finance Ministry sources said here today.
</P>
<P>
The strategy also requires that once the debt stocks have been
identified, efforts should be made to retire the more expensive
debt and thereby reduce the growing interest burden.
</P>
<P>
The proposal put together by the internal debt cell of the
Reserve Bank of India entails limits on both the annual increase
in public debt -- market loans, treasury bills and external debt
-- and the outstanding at the end of the year.
</P>
<P>
It has been suggested that a limit on the increase in the
public debt as a ratio of total expenditure be placed at 15
percent. To bring down the fiscal deficit to below 4 percent of
the gross domestic product (GDP), it has been suggested that this
limit be brought down further to 10 percent over a five-year
period.
</P>
<P>
to tackle the stock problem, a 35-percent limit has been mooted
on year-end outstanding public debt as a ratio of the GDP of the
preceding year.
</P>
<P>
In recent years, the increase in public debt as a ratio of
total expenditure has dropped from 36 percent in 1993-94 to 21
percent in 1994-95. Over the same period, the proportion of the
total public debt in the GDP declined from 42 percent to 38
percent.

<HEADLINE> Debt Market Takes Center Stage in India </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
NEW DELHI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- India's debt market appeared
to have come alive with more than 106.3 billion rupees (3.19
billion U.S. dollars) being mopped up through bonds and debentures
during January-August this year, said a survey here today.
</P>
<P>
During the same period last year, only about 8 billion rupees
(250 million dollars) were raised through debt issues.
</P>
<P>
This year the debt market appetite is even greater with 200
billion rupees (6.06 billion dollars) likely to be mobilized.
Moreover, permission to foreign institutional investors to have
100 percent investment in debt issues is expected to boost the
market further.
</P>
<P>
The extraordinary surge has come because investors have
switched from equities to debt, the survey said.
</P>
<P>
India's 20 top financial institutions and corporations raised
106.296 billion rupees (3.19 billion dollars) during
January-August this year. Market sources peg the total collection
through debt instruments in the period at over 120 billion rupees
(3.6 billion dollars).

<HEADLINE> Vietnam's Exports up in First Eight Months </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
HANOI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Vietnam's exports generated a
revenue of 4.35 billion U.S. dollars in the first eight months of
this year, an increase of 22.6 percent as against the same period
of last year.
</P>
<P>
The exports so far accounted for 65 percent of the government
projection for the year, according to official figures today, with
that of light industry and handicrafts accounting for 31.1 percent
while those of heavy industry and agro-forestry products for 24.4
percent and 21.1 percent respectively.
</P>
<P>
The country's imports for the first eight months rose 45
percent to reach 7.6 billion dollars, or 80.9 percent of the
government's yearly plan.
</P>
<P>
The sharp increase of imports has resulted in a trade deficit
of 3.25 billion dollars, a record figure seen in recent years.
</P>
<P>
Though government officials and major businessmen are
optimistic that exports will surpass the government target, the
trade deficit is not likely to be lower than 2.5 billion dollars
for the year.

<HEADLINE> Singaporean Leaders Puzzled on Mahathir's Reaction: Goh </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SINGAPORE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Singaporean Prime Minister
Goh Chok Tong has said that he was puzzled over Malaysian Prime
Minister Mahathir Mohammed's reaction on the re-merger issue.
</P>
<P>
Goh was quoted by today's Straits Times as saying that the
Malaysian leader had misinterpreted the statements made by the
Singaporean leaders.
</P>
<P>
"I am puzzled why they misinterpreted the statements made in
Singapore and I have to try and understand how it was possible for
such a misinterpretation to arise," Goh told reporters.
</P>
<P>
He was responding to criticism by the Malaysian prime minister
last Friday that the Singaporean leaders had used Malaysia as a
"bogeyman" to threaten Singaporeans with a forced re-merger should
Singapore lose its competitive edge or if they did not vote for
the ruling People's Action Party (PAP).
</P>
<P>
Goh said: "There was no reason whatsoever for Singaporean
leaders to use Malaysia as a 'bogeyman' to threaten Singaporeans
into voting for the PAP because it would have no effect."
</P>
<P>
He reiterated that the Singaporean leaders respect the
achievements of both Malaysia and Prime Minister Mahathir and that
the Singaporean leaders had never intended to provoke the
Malaysians or their government.
</P>
<P>
"When I read Dr. Mahathir's reactions, I was somewhat puzzled,"
Goh said. "I did not expect the Malaysians to react so harshly."
</P>
<P>
The possibility of a re-merger between Singapore and Malaysia
was first talked about by Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew in June
when he was answering questions at the Singapore Press Club.
</P>
<P>
Prime Minister Goh mentioned the re-merger again during his
National Day Rally speech last month. He said that Singapore
would have to rejoin Malaysia on its terms if Singapore's economy
faltered.
</P>
<P>
"When I made the statement, it was with good intentions, not to
scare anybody," he said. "My own view is that Singapore should be
carrying on as an independent country. As I've said time and
again, it's not on my political agenda", Goh said.
</P>
<P>
A poll conducted by the Straits Times newspaper in mid-June
found that six out of 10 Singaporeans were against the idea of
re-merger.
</P>
<P>
Nearly 30 percent of the respondents were in favor of the
merger which they believed would bring Singapore more benefits
such as more land and natural resources.

<HEADLINE> Licensing For Salt Producers </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- China will introduce new
measures to regulate the salt industry to root out cut-price
private production which is damaging public health, said an
official from the China National Salt Industry Corp (CNSIC), when
announcing plans to licence 109 edible salt producers next year.
</P>
<P>
According to today's China Daily, only state-licenced
transporters and wholesalers will be permitted to transport and
sell edible salt.
</P>
<P>
The paper quoted Shi Qi, a CNSIC departmental director as
saying that the domestic salt market has been tarnished by private
producers, who make big profits out of low quality salt.
</P>
<P>
Eating privately sold salt has endangered people's health
because it doesn't contain enough iodine, Shi said.
</P>
<P>
Nationwide statistics are not available, but it's known that at
least 400 million Chinese suffer from iodine deficiency, which can
cause goitre and dementia. Lack of iodine can also permanently
stunt children's growth.
</P>
<P>
Adding iodine to salt is an effective and economical way to
control these health problems.
</P>
<P>
China has promised to eliminate diseases caused by iodine
deficiency by 2000 in response to an international call.
</P>
<P>
The licensing system is the latest move in a national project
to achieve this goal, Shi said. So far China has spent nearly one
billion yuan to combat iodine deficiency, including 27 million US
dollars this year in loans from the World Bank.
</P>
<P>
Altogether the China National Salt Industry Corp, the
industry's watchdog, intends to issue licences to 109 salt
producers across the nation, according to Shi. The number may be
changed in line with the real situation, he added.
</P>
<P>
Licensed producers will be selected on their production
capacity, level of facilities, product quality and location. The
109 enterprises will supply iodine salt for household consumption,
while the other salt producers will be permitted to produce
industrial salt for use in refrigeration, agriculture, fishing and
construction.
</P>
<P>
The three kinds of licences -- for producers, transporters and
wholesales -- are expected to hit illegal salt producers hard, but
total elimination of bad practices depends on the assistance of
the whole society, said Shi.
</P>
<P>
He called on consumers, especially those in the countryside, to
protect themselves and not to but private salt, which is usually
cheaper than iodized salt.
</P>
<P>
According to some reports, China consumed over 8 million tons
of edible salt in 1995, but only over 6 million tons were sold by
China National Salt Industry Corp, which means private producers
took 20 percent of the market.

<HEADLINE> ROK Stock Dealers In Shanghai </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHANGHAI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Six securities dealers from
the Republic of Korea (ROK), including the country's four largest,
are taking part in the fledgling Shanghai securities market.
</P>
<P>
Of five foreign dealers who opened offices in Shanghai in the
first seven months of the year, four are from the ROK.
</P>
<P>
Last year, the ROK government removed its restrictions on stock
dealers opening overseas offices, and ROK securities traders have
flocked to Shanghai, the largest financial center in China and
home of one of China's two security exchanges.
</P>
<P>
Observers here noticed the advantages for ROK stock dealers
working in Shanghai since the two countries are both regarded by
outsiders as emerging markets that share the same oriental culture.
</P>
<P>
Currently, ROK dealers are studying the possibility of dealing
in B-Shares, which are specially designed for foreign investors in
the Chinese Stock Market, and more ROK securities dealers are
expected to open offices in Shanghai in the near future.

<HEADLINE> Vitamin C Makers Join up in Price Cartel </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Vitamin C producers in China
are planning to team up to prevent the price from crashing on the
global market.
</P>
<P>
"We are calling for unity among domestic vitamin C makers to
hone our competitive edge and in the meantime deal with the
worsening market prospect," said an official from a coordinating
body founded by a dozen manufacturers in 1993.
</P>
<P>
China accounts for 30 percent of the world's total supply of
vitamin C. Exports last year totalled 20,000 tons, or 70 percent
of the country's output for 1995, according to today's China
Daily.
</P>
<P>
Fast-growing Chinese exports have altered the framework of
international competition in the sector, smashing the global
monopoly held by a handful of foreign pharmaceutical giants. But
statistics indicate that the world's total demand for Vitamin C is
stable at 80,000 tons. At best, demand is growing at 5 percent a
year.
</P>
<P>
To secure their market position, some foreign vitamin C makers
resorted to big price cuts. The slack market has forced Chinese
vitamin C exporters to slash their export prices by almost 50
percent from a year ago.
</P>
<P>
Meager profits have forced half of China's domestic vitamin C
makers to cut production or close down.
</P>
<P>
It is normal for growing market competition to drive a
proportion of an industry's small and medium-sized companies out
of business, the cartel official said.
</P>
<P>
But the relevant departments are endeavoring to help troubled
vitamin C makers out of their difficulties, he added.
</P>
<P>
Industry administration departments have reportedly stepped in,
with promises to grant incentive policies to companies to help
them update technology. Firms will be encouraged to increase their
export quotas on merit, assessed by their scale of operation and
their ability to profit.
</P>
<P>
But, according to an official from the Chamber of Commerce for
Medicines and Health Care Products, steps to salvage the sector by
mergers and consolidation among manufacturers and exporters are
urgently needed.

<P>
He warned of a potential danger brought by an overall
penetration of the Western culture to the development of the
country's economy.

<TEXT>
<P>
URUMQI, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Officials from nine provinces
and regions close to the Yellow River gathered here recently to
discuss how to increase economic co-operation among them.
</P>
<P>
Officials attended a meeting of the Yellow River Economic
Cooperative Zone, where they agreed to open wider to the outside
world by jointly improving infrastructure in their areas, making
full use of border outlets in the Xinjiang Uygur and Inner
Mongolia autonomous regions and in the coastal ports of Shandong
Province, while doing a better job of sponsoring international
economic and trade activities.
</P>
<P>
They plan to jointly tap natural resources and to open a
tourist line from Qingdao and Jinan in coastal Shandong Province
to Xinjiang, via Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, and Gansu provinces.
</P>
<P>
The zone will include these provinces, along with Qinghai
Province and Xinjiang, Inner Mongolia, and Ningxia Hui autonomous
regions, which account for about a half of the country's territory
and a fourth of its population. It is an area that is rich in
mineral and land resources.
</P>
<P>
The zone has undertaken about 20,000 cooperative projects
involving materials valued at 23 billion yuan since the provinces
and regions forged cooperative ties eight years ago.

<P>
KUALA LUMPUR, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The ruling coalition of
Barisan Nasional (National Front) in Malaysia's Sarawak State has
won a landslide victory in the seventh state elections held on
last weekend, local press reports said today.
</P>
<P>
The four-party coalition, which won 19 seats unopposed on the
nomination day about two weeks ago, bagged 38 more contested
seats, giving it the command of 57 seats in the new 62-seat State
Assembly, the reports said.
</P>
<P>
The coalition groups Parti Pesaka Bumiputra Bersatu Sarawak,
which won 29 seats, the Sarawak United People's Party, 13 seats,
the Sarawak National Party, seven seats, and Parti Bangsa Dayak
Sarawak, eight seats.
</P>
<P>
However, the coalition suffered a major casualty with the
defeat of a prominent standard bearer, the state's Deputy Chief
Minister Wong Soon Kai, who is chairman of the Sarawak United
People's Party.
</P>
<P>
The opposition won only three seats while independents took two
in the elections.
</P>
<P>
An official announcement said that the overall voter turnout
was 65.5 percent, the lowest in the state's election history.
</P>
<P>
The State Legislative Assembly of Sarawak was dissolved on

<HEADLINE> Reunited Germany Has No Territorial Claim: President </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BONN, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A reunited Germany will never
raise any territorial claim, German President Roman Herzog said
today in Berlin, according to reports reaching here.
</P>
<P>
Speaking to an annual gathering of the German nationals who
left areas now part of Poland and Russia to resettle in Germany
after World War II, Herzog said that the ownership of these areas,
including Hinterpommer, Ostpreussen and Oberschlesien, have
already been defined by international law, and the German
government would not attempt to reclaim them.
</P>
<P>
"These areas belong to our historical and cultural heritage,
but they do not belong to our nation," Herzog said.
</P>
<P>
He elaborated on drawing lessons from the last war, admitting
that Germany had committed terrible crimes, though noting the
German people were victims too.
</P>
<P>
More than 15 million people left those areas at the end of the
war to resettle in Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg, and some 20,000
of them lost their lives, he said.
</P>
<P>
The German president also called on the Europeans to cooperate
and concentrate on building a united Europe, which, he said, would
help guarantee lasting peace and co-existence on the
continent.

SINGAPORE, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Zainal Abidin's goal gave
Malaysia a 1-1 draw against Thailand on Sunday and also ensure a
semifinal spot in the Tiger Cup soccer tournament.
</P>
<P>
Abidin's shot cancelled out Kiatisuk Semanuang's 28th-minute
goal for the favorite Thailand, which Thais must win or at least
draw against host Singapore in their last league match on Tuesday
to clinch the second semifinal berth from their group.
</P>
<P>
The game started with the Thais well in charge, creating three
goal-scoring chances in the first 13 minutes.
</P>
<P>
Thailand had a goal disallowed in the 9th minute when Worrawoot
Srimaka was ruled offside by a linesman after he stabbed home a
loose ball in the box.
</P>
<P>
Then goalkeeper Khairul Azman saved Malaysia by staving off two
potential goal shots by Phithaya Santawong and Dusit Chalermsan in
the next four minutes.
</P>
<P>
In an earlier group match, Brunei beat the Philippines 1-0 with
the only goal coming from Irwan Mohamed in the 28th minute.
</P>

The others in the 10-nation tournament are Indonesia, Vietnam,
Burma, Cambodia and Laos.

<HEADLINE> Central China County's Fast Urbanization </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>

<P>
ZHENGZHOU, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Just five years ago, the
outlook of small towns in Gongyi County in central China's Henan
Province was described by many people as being "rich", but "dirty
and disorderly, " because of the lack of infrastructure.
</P>
<P>
It was listed by the central government as one of the top 100
counties in the country in terms of comprehensive strength, and
the local government raised nearly two billion yuan (about 240
million US dollars) for small towns, fundamentally changing their
outlook, since 1991.
</P>
<P>
They have invested heavily in parks, farm produce markets and
other key projects, and have put experts in charge of the design
work, and 24 industrial zones have been set up in rural areas to
attract investment.
</P>
<P>
Half of Gongyi's 750,000 people are leading an urban life, and
the population in the countryside drops every year, local
officials say.
</P>
<P>
Last year, Zhang Ximing, a 32-year-old farmer who came to
Xiaoguan Town with his wife to look for a job, was able to buy a
120-sq.m. flat with 50,000 yuan and spent another 10,000 yuan on
decorations and household appliances. He then got urban residency
for his 3-year-old son so that he could attend school in the urban
area.
</P>
<P>
Like Zhang, 500 other farmers have bought flats in the town,
and even flats that are still under construction have been
purchased. Wang Zhenhai, a manager of a real estate company, says
that property development in small towns is very "profitable and
promising."
</P>
<P>
Local governments have developed preferential polices to
encourage farmers to settle in the towns, and if they pay a
certain amount, the government will give them permanent residency
there, and equal treatment with other residents in employment,
schooling and the purchase of flats.
</P>
<P>
And, if these farmers are willing to continue their
agricultural production, the government will preserve their land.

<HEADLINE> Philippine Rebels to Unite Against Government: MILF </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
MANILA, September 9 (Xinhua) -- A rebel group in the
Philippines is planning to unite with other rebels against the
government while the Moro National Liberation Front is taking part
in the historic elections in the Autonomous Region in Muslim
Mindanao (ARMM) today.
</P>
<P>
The local press reported today that the Moro Islamic Liberation
Front (MILF) foresaw an alliance with the Abu Sayyaf and other
rebels in fighting the government just a day before the elections.
</P>
<P>
The MILF, a potent rebel group second to the MNLF in the
country, vowed to continue seeking independence in the southern
Philippines after the MNLF and the government forged the peace
accord last week.
</P>
<P>
MILF Vice Chairman for political affairs Gazzali Jaafar said on
Sunday that it is inevitable for the insurgency groups to help
each other for a common cause.
</P>
<P>
"Although now, each group has its own party and organization,
the time will come when they will have to help each other, and I
think it is going to happen," he said.
</P>
<P>
MILF military affairs chief Muhammad Murad said the MILF and
the New People's Army have forged unofficial tactical cooperation
in encounters with government troops while the MILF and the Abu
Sayyaf are "almost like one family" as many of Abu Sayyaf members
live in MILF-controlled territories.
</P>
<P>
The MNLF has declared an end to its struggle against the
government by signing the peace agreement and participating the
elections in the ARMM.
</P>
<P>
The Philippine government has said that it is willing to hold
separate talks with the MILF and other rebel groups if they are
not satisfied with the peace agreement between the government and
the MNLF.

<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Beijing's groundwater tables
have risen thanks to abundant rainfall since mid July, but the
prospect of water resources in the city are still not optimistic,
according to a report.
</P>
<P>
The rise of groundwater levels in Beijing ranged from 1.5 to
6.0 meters, "China Geology and Mineral Resources News" reported.
</P>
<P>
In the plain areas, more groundwater was replenished than last
year, and the groundwater levels of the city will continue to rise
for a period of time.
</P>
<P>
But experts said that more than four billion cubic meters of
groundwater were overused over the past decades. They warned it's
still too early to be optimistic about the rise of water tables.

<HEADLINE> Human Still Enjoy Storytelling In Electronic Information Age </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
BEIJING, September 9 (Xinhua) -- Chinese engineer Liao Xianyuan
refuses to allow his son to play electronic computer games too
often, afraid that he will create a "new electronic illiterate".
</P>
<P>
But when it comes to old-fashioned storytelling that has
spanned the generations, Liao is enthusiastic.
</P>
<P>
"Storytelling will develop my son's language and intelligence,
teach him some moral lessons and let him know some basic knowledge
about history," he said.
</P>
<P>
The Chinese government has even included storytelling in its
primary education program, in addition to pouring a large
investment into developing electronic information networks.
</P>
<P>
Zhang Yiyun, from the Shijingshan Children's Library in
Beijing, said that many Chinese parents begin to tell stories to
their children when they are just one year old.
</P>
<P>
The stories include favorites, such as the simple "Wolf
Grandma", and the sophisticated "Journey to the West".
</P>
<P>
Storytelling was even a major subject for discussion at the
recent conference of the International Federation of Library
Associations and Institutes in Beijing.
</P>
<P>
What about the future of storytelling? Despite the arrival of
the Internet and E-mail, storytelling, the ancient way of
communication, is still popular in China, as well as around the
world.
</P>
<P>
In the United States, interest in storytelling has been greatly
revived over the past 20 years.
</P>
<P>
"Why do we still tell stories? Because we must." said Audrey
Daigneault, a media expert from the US.
</P>
<P>
She said that human beings change more slowly than their
technologies. People's brains organize information into a
narrative format, and find storytelling a convenient way to
remember facts, she explained.
</P>
<P>
Many experts believe that stories are the best way for people
to share and pass on their traditional cultures.
</P>
<P>
Storytelling began when human history began. Religion, history,
education and entertainment have been shared by generations and
generations through storytelling.
</P>
<P>
The invention of written characters, and even the introduction
of today's computers, have changed the way people record facts.
</P>
<P>
A round-clock storytelling activity is held every summer in
Guadalajara, a small town in Spain. The event has been called "A
Storytelling Marathon" and is featured in the Guinness Book of
World Records.
</P>
<P>
The town's head always tells the first story to start the
annual gala, one of the most important festivals in the area.
</P>
<P>
Greenlanders preserve their ethnic legends and myths by telling
stories, according to a study by Dorte Futtrup, a Denmark scholar.
</P>
<P>
But there have been changes in modern society. There is now no
need for story tellers to face their audience directly. Instead,
they can tell stories on radio and television, or even on the
Internet.
</P>
<P>
The arrival of new technology may have marked a new chapter for
the old tradition of storytelling. But whether it is world of
mouth or a voice from the TV screen, the art of storytelling will
survive well into the future.

<HEADLINE> Support For Shenzhen Securities Exchange From Mayor </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
SHENZHEN, September 9 (Xinhua) -- The mayor of Guangdong
Province's Shenzhen City, Li Zibin, recently emphasized the city
government's support for the Shenzhen Securities Exchange, one of
China's two bourses.
</P>
<P>
The remarks came at the exchange's fourth members' conference,
which was attended by over 600 members and government officials.
</P>
<P>
In the speech, Li noted that the exchange is a national bourse
whose task is to promote the development of a socialist market
economy, and that the city government must support its development.
</P>
<P>
The pending return of Hong Kong to the motherland provides
Shenzhen with opportunities, such as sound conditions and broad
prospects for developing the bourse, the mayor noted, urging the
securities market not to ignore the opportunities to attract more
enterprises from other parts of the country to be listed on the
bourse and for more investors to participate.
</P>
<P>
The mayor said that the possibility of linking up the Shenzhen
and Hong Kong exchanges should be studied as well as the
possibility of Sino-foreign cooperative funds.
</P>
<P>
The city government, he said, will in no way interfere in the
market and stock prices.

<TEXT>
<P>
NEW YORK, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Steffi Graf of Germany
outplayed arch-rival Monica Seles of the United States 7-5, 6-4
here on Sunday to win her fifth US Open singles title -- the 21st
Grand Slam triumph of her career.
</P>
<P>
"It was really, really difficult to play this tournament," said
Graf, whose father Peter went on trial on tax evasion charges in
Germany on Thursday.
</P>
<P>
"Last year was extremely difficult, and this year was not any
easier. It has been a struggle to stay focused."
</P>
<P>
Graf thumped down 10 aces through the 87-minute match and gave
Seles only one chance to break her -- which Seles took advantage
of in the first set.
</P>
<P>
Seles, who also lost to Graf in the final here last year, said
the German player's serve was the key to her vicory.
</P>
<P>
Graf broke Seles in the first game of the second set, and never
looked back.
</P>
<P>
Graf finished off the match with a forehand cross-court winner
on her second match point, as storm clouds closed in on the
National Tennis Center at Flushing Meadows.

<TEXT>
<P>
JERUSALEM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Israeli Prime minister
Benjamin Netanyahu said here today that contacts for renewal of
peace negotiations between Israel and Syria are continuing with
assistance of the United States, reported Israel Television.
</P>
<P>
Speaking with reporters at the Prime Minister's Office,
Netanyahu said that the talks could be reopened soon and Israel
had provided Syria with what he called several fresh logical and
fair proposals.
</P>
<P>
He said that he will discuss renewing the Syrian track of the
peace process with American officials during his visit to the
United States. Netanyahu is flying to Washington late tonight. He
is scheduled to meet U.S. President Bill Clinton Monday.
</P>
<P>
The issues surrounding the resumption of peace talks with
Syria are expected to dominate the summit between Netanyahu and
Clinton.

Early in August, Israel submitted a formal paper expressing
its willingness to have the talks resumed at the Wye Plantation
in eastern Maryland, where the last round was suspended in
February.
</P>
<P>
Last month Netanyahu abandoned his "Lebanon First" initiative
and made it clear that the rightwing Likud government is willing
to negotiate on the Golan, as well as on its preference for an
Israeli withdrawal from south Lebanon in return for
Syrian-backed security guarantees.
</P>
<P>
The Jewish state captured the Golan Heights, a strategic
plateau, from Syria in the 1967 Middle East war.
</P>
<P>
However, Damascus is adamant that talks should resume where
they stopped, meaning on the basis of a private assurance by the
late Labor prime minister Yitzhak Rabin that Israel would fully
withdraw from the Golan in return for satisfaction on
Golan-related security arrangements and normalization of
relations.
</P>
<P>
But the new Israeli government has repeatedly made it clear
that it opposes the previous government's position regarding the
future of the Golan Heights.

<HEADLINE> Tanzanian Govt Restarts Campaign Against </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
DAR ES SALAAM, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Tanzanian Prime
Minister Frederick Sumaye today renewed the government's
Commitment in the campaign against illiteracy, stressing the
need to improve the quality of primary schools and revival of
adult education classes.
</P>
<P>
In an address to mark the 25th anniversary of adult education,
the prime minister expressed concern over reports that about 8
million Tanzanians, or a quarter of the country's population,
were illiterates.
</P>
<P>
Sumaye said efforts should be made to eradicate illiteracy.
"The nation cannot make significant development in all other
areas of life if people remain ignorant," he said.
</P>
<P>
He explained, "it is difficult for an ignorant farmer to
understand modern farming methods. Likewise a family of
illiterates cannot understand easily the importance of boiling
drinking water."
</P>
<P>
The prime minister said there was poor performance among
pupils in primary schools and attributed the trend to poor
conditions in the schools, where most have shortages of teachers,
classrooms and desks.
</P>
<P>
He said there was significant fall of enrolment. In 1981 about
98 percent of school aged children were admitted to schools, but
now the figure was dropped to 64 percent.
</P>
<P>
"No pupil should be sitting on a stone or a brick in a
classroom. This is an order and those failing to achieve that
target will be taken to task," he said.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister also directed district commissioners and
local authorities leaders to ensure that adult education classes
were revived in their respective areas.
</P>
<P>
The prime minister commended leaders and residents of Ruvuma
Region for overcoming illiteracy by more than 95 percent. He also
lauded them for their target to wipe out illiteracy completely by
the year 2000.
</P>
<P>
According to a report, the illiteracy rate was 50 percent in
Ruvuma Region in 1970, but it has now dropped to 4.12 percent.
The region is the second in the country with such a good record
after the capital Dar es Salaam.

PARIS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- French Prime Minister Alain
Juppe today called on French youths who believe in the political
heritage of General Charles de Gaulle to vote for Jacques Chirac
in 2002 to let him "lead well his task without being bothered by
political blockings."
</P>
<P>
Speaking to a meeting of 1,000 Gaullist youths in Troyes,
central France, Juppe, who is president of the ruling
Rassemblement pour la Republique (RPR), also called on his young
supporters to make the RPR win in the legislative election in

"We should first give him the means today, tomorrow, after 1998
and... after 2002, to lead well his task without being bothered by
political blockings," said Juppe.
</P>
<P>
While praising the attendants of the meeting for helping let
Chirac win the presidential election in 1995, he said, "Now he is
in the Elysee (presidential palace), but the moment has not come
for you to rest. You have not ended your action for Jacques
Chirac."
</P>
<P>
"We should later on prepare for the future of Gaullism, to mark
your loyalty to the work accomplished by General de Gaulle,
Georges Pompidou, Jacques Chirac and the big horde of those who
surrounded them," said Juppe.

WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- U.S. President Bill
Clinton's re-election campaign might try to postpone this month's
scheduled start of the series of three presidential debates, the
St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported today.
</P>
<P>
Peter Knight, the president's campaign manager, told the
Post-Dispatch that he was concerned that Clinton is scheduled to
address the U.N. General Assembly the day before the tentatively
scheduled opening of the presidential debates, set for September
25 at Washington University in St. Louis, Missouri.
</P>
<P>
The non-partisan Commission on Presidential Debates has
proposed three presidential debates and a vice presidential debate
on four consecutive Wednesdays beginning September 25 in St.
Louis.
</P>
<P>
With negotiations on the plan scheduled to begin this coming
week, both sides have let it be known that many details are up for
discussion, ranging from the number of debates to the inclusion of
Reform Party candidate Ross Perot.
</P>
<P>
A spokeswoman at Clinton campaign headquarters in Washington
declined today to confirm her side would oppose the September 25
date, saying negotiations on all of the debates start next week,
and nothing has been settled.

<TEXT>
<P>
WASHINGTON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- A top U.S. uniformed
officer warned Saddam Hussein today that he would face further
attacks if he tried to repair military sites hit by U.S. missiles.
</P>
<P>
Gen. John Shalikashvili, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
said on the NBC News program "Meet the Press" that signs have been
detected that Saddam is trying to repair surface-to-air missile
sites targeted by 44 American cruise missiles last Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
"We have warned Saddam Hussein that any attempt to repair those
sites or reinforce them will be taken very seriously, and he must
understand the consequences of such an act," he said.
</P>
<P>
With regard to fighting between the two Kurdish factions which
reports say is continuing, Shalikashvili said, "The United States,
rather than siding with one Kurdish faction, against another,
which I believe would have been wrong, has always put its effort
on trying to get the two sides together to resolve their
differences so peace can once again return to the Kurdish area."
</P>
<P>
But Shalikashvili said the United States will not stand "idly
by" if Saddam threatens his people or the region, which is a
no-fly zone, imposed by U.S.-led allies to prevent Iraqi troops
from entering after the Gulf War in 1991.

LAGOS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Nigeria said today that it has

Service (USIS)'s aid to a fugitive radio station in the north.

<P>
A press release from the presidency said that USIS Director
James Callahan has recently denied the involvement of his agency
with an illegal pirate radio station -- Radio Democrat
International, known as Radio Freedom Frequency and Radio Kudirat
Nigeria.

The honorary minister said he has documents in hand ''strongly
implicating the USIS in a failed attempt to recruit a broadcaster
in Hausa language for the fugitive radio station.''

The broadcaster, Bruce Copehed, whose travel papers were
being prepared by a USIS official, was detected in the unfriendly
act of aiding and abetting the illegal operation of the fugitive
radio station, he said.

''The government is in the process of uncovering the

<HEADLINE> EU to Hold Special Summit in Dublin Next Month </HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
<P>
LONDON, September 8 (Xinhua) -- The European Union (EU) foreign
ministers have agreed to hold a special EU summit in Dublin,
capital of Ireland, early next month to discuss issues concerning
European integration, according to reports from Tralee, Ireland.
</P>
<P>
Speaking at a press conference at the end of an informal
meeting of EU foreign ministers, Irish Foreign Minister Dick
Spring, chairman of the two-day conference, announced that the
special summit would be held in Dublin on October 5, the only date
acceptable to all the 15 EU member states.
</P>
<P>
Ireland, the current EU presidency state, has been asked to
host such a special summit when EU leaders met in June in
Florence, Italy, and the target is to review the progress on
revising the EU's founding treaties.
</P>
<P>
Most participants agreed that the summit was necessary if the
Inter-Governmental Conference on the future of the EU was to agree
to a new treaty by the middle of next year.
</P>
<P>
EU Commission President Jacques Santer said that "this summit
in October is to give political impetus" to the European
integration process.
</P>
<P>
French Foreign Minister Herve de Charette said that he is to
meet his German counterpart, Klaus Kinkle, on October 2 to discuss
a joint Franco-German position ahead of the summit.
</P>
<P>
However, British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind has
questioned the need for such a summit, saying, "We have always
held slightly more of the view that we have too many summit
meetings."
</P>
<P>
"I am quite happy to be persuaded but I start off with just a
tinge of uncertainty as to whether his meeting will prove to have
been entirely necessary," Rifkind added.
</P>
<P>
The EU foreign ministers condemned the U.S. legislations which
would punish foreign firms with business links with Cuba, Iran and
Libya, but said that they were unlikely to take any retaliatory
steps until after the U.S. presidential elections in November.
</P>
<P>
On U.S. missile attacks upon Iraq, the EU ministers failed to
send Washington a statement of support as there are quite
different views among the 15 member states.

ATHENS, September 8 (Xinhua) -- Greek Prime Minister Costas
Simitis and Defense Minister Gerasimos Arsenis today denied the
involvement of Greek Cypriots in the shooting of Turkish Cypriot
soldiers.
</P>
<P>
A Turkish Cypriot soldier was found shot dead and another
wounded early this morning at a guard unit near Acheritou, in the
Turkish-controlled part of Cyprus.
</P>
<P>
Turkish Cypriot leader Rauf Denktash called the act an "act of
vengeance" for the deaths of two Greek Cypriots in Dherynia last
month in the island's buffer zone.
</P>
<P>
Simitis told a press conference at the Salonika international
trade fair that he contacted earlier in the day with the Greek
embassy in Cyprus and the Cypriot government and was told that
following a weapons check at the Cypriot National Guard, it was
found that no shots had been fired from the Greek Cypriot side.
</P>
<P>
Meanwhile, Defense Minister Arsenis categorically ruled out any
involvement by the Cypriot National Guard in the incident. He
emphasized that an investigation would be carried out by the U.N.
</P>
<P>
He noted that a distance of 700 meters separated the two guard
units, an area patrolled by British soldiers. Neither the latter
no the U.N. forces have confirmed the Turkish allegations, he
added.
</P>
<P>
Cyprus has been divided into the Greek Cypriot south and the
Turkish Cypriot north since 1974 when Turkey sent its troops to
take control of one third of its territory following a military
coup engineered by the then Greek junta.
</P>
<P>
Repeated U.N.-led efforts trying to reunify the island under a
bizonal and bicommunal federal state have so far failed to yield
any concrete results.
