Feelings of patriotism 
stirred in Tomjanovich
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By FRAN BLINEBURY &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ Rudy Tomjanovich was like most American kids. For
three out of four years, he paid little or no attention to Olympic
sports. Then in the fourth year, he would turn on the TV and be
entranced by the Games being beamed in from exotic places like Rome
or Innsbruck or Tokyo.
</P>
<P>
   The difference between Rudy T and most American kids is that by
the time 1968 rolled around, he had become a celebrated high school
basketball player, a star at the University of Michigan, an
All-American, and he would go on to be a first-round draft pick in
the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   In other words, he had the kind of talent that could have taken
him to the Olympics to play for the United States, to have the
chance to stand on the victory platform with a gold medal around
his neck, listening to The Star Spangled Banner.
</P>
<P>
   The year was 1968, and the Olympics were to be played in Mexico
City. And if an American team ever wanted a big man who could fill
up the hoop from long range, bust any kind of zone defenses thrown
out by the foreign teams, the tough-nosed kid from the hardscrabble
streets of Hamtramck, Mich., was that guy.
</P>
<P>
   But no call ever came. No invitation to try out. No thought,
really, to take it upon himself to inquire about the possibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just remember turning on the TV one day during the Olympics
that year and watching the basketball,'' Tomjanovich said. ``I
looked at the team, and I watched what the different guys could do,
and I said to myself, `Hell, I can play with any of those guys.
What's the deal?'''
</P>
<P>
   Rudy T never learned about the deal until several years later
when he met his new roommate with the Houston Rnd by the NBA. And for a lot of
years, that was regarded by people as the best draft in the history
of the NBA.''
</P>
<P>
   That draft class also included a big fella out of UCLA named Lew
Alcindor, who had been invited to the Olympic tryoutcamp but
declined as a protest against racism.
</P>
<P>
   They were different times, a turbulent political era. The 1968
Mexico City Games were where sprinters Tommie Smith and John Carlos
shocked the world with their gloved-fist ``Black Power'' salute on
the victory stand that got them tossed off the U.S. Olympic team
and sent home.
</P>
<P>
   It was a time when America was torn between the old, traditional
ways of doing things and newer, independent views. Hank Iba, the
venerable coach from Oklahoma State _ and the longtime U.S. Olympic
boss _ was, of course, a traditionalist. The only big-name
offensive player Iba kept on his roster was Spencer Haywood.
</P>
<P>
   ``He had his style, his opinions, I guess,'' said Tomjanovich.
``He wanted to play a very controlled game. He didn't want
one-on-one players. Not a lot of big scorers. It's hard to argue
with the results. They won the gold medal. I don't have complaints.
It's just that when I look back at all the things that I
accomplished _ getting drafted in the first round, making the NBA
All-Star team _ it's a void in my basketball career. I would have
really liked to have played for my country.''
</P>
<P>
   Instead, years later, he is coaching for his country in a
situation that is far different and far more difficult than in any
of those Olympic years when Iba and the U.S. were still dominating
the international game.
</P>
<P>
   Back then, America could afford to be cavalier, to take just
about any 12 college players and win the gold medal. Now, in a
vastly different era, with the NBA Dream Team sitting at home to
protest the lockout by the owners in a doubly arrogant labor war,
it is his task to take this makeshift team of European exiles and
CBA wannabes through the minefield of the World Championship of
Basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Handicapping the tournament at the start, you would have said
the U.S. would be doing well to get any kind of medal, and now,
just past the midway point, that projection might have improved
slightly.
</P>
<P>
   With a hard-fought come-from-behind 75-73 win over Spain on
Monday night, the Dreamers put themselves in a position to claim
the top seeding in their second-round group if they can beat
Australia tonight.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the Yugoslavians have established themselves as the class
of the field, with Russia and Lithuania close behind. And the
Greeks have to be feared playing in front of their hysterical home
crowds.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in the mix,'' said Tomjanovich. ``That's all you can ask
for at this point. You want to get through the second round, and
then it becomes a single-elimination tournament in the medal round.
You've got to be on top of your game every day at that point.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a real challenge, I'll tell you that. But it's
been fun. It's a completely different situation than I'm used to
with our team at home.''
</P>
<P>
   No Olajuwon. No Barkley. No Drexler. No go-to player who will
bail you out of any kind of difficult situation, make a play when
it's necessary.
</P>
<P>
   None of the American players is capable of taking over a game by
himself, but many of them don't believe that.
</P>
<P>
   You watch them play, and you see some of the principles of Rudy
T's Rocket offense _ the ball movement, the inside-out game, the
reliance on stepping up and making the outside shot. When the U.S.
has shot well from the perimeter _ against Brazil and Argentina,
late in the win over Spain _ it has looked like a medal threat.
When those shots aren't falling, the Americans can be dogged for
nearly a half by a lowly team like South Korea or beaten by almost
anybody.
</P>
<P>
   A lot of NBA coaches would have bailed out immediately on USA
Basketball when Grant Hill, Gary Payton, Tim Hardaway and the rest
said they weren't coming. It was tempting to Rudy T.
</P>
<P>
   ``But you look at what's at stake here,'' he said. ``This is
still the World Basketball Championship. I know most Americans are
only focused on the Olympics. But the rest of the world views this
as the more important tournament. It was an honor to be chosen in
the first place to coach the team, so I figured, `Why not stand by
the commitment?'''
</P>
<P>
   He has been pleasantly surprised by some of his players and
considerably disappointed by a few.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were told some things about some players by agents and by
people who recommended them that haven't turned out to be true,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   But his style remains the same as with the Rockets. He will not
publicly level individual criticism at any of them. Catch him from
day to day or even hour to hour, and he might believe he's got a
gold-medal team or an also-ran on his hands. If they don't take the
gold, it will be the first time in a major international
competition since the U.S. began using pros in 1992. These, of
course, are different pros than Magic, Bird, Jordan and Barkley.
</P>
<P>
   ``You deal with what you have,'' Tomjanovich said. ``We have
been in some situations before with the Rockets where people didn't
give us a chance.''
</P>
<P>
   Besides, this, finally, is his chance to represent his country
on the court.
</P>
<P>
   ``I love all that stuff,'' he said. ``I always loved watching
guys compete for the U.S. and to watch them stand up there and get
medals and hear the national anthem. That stuff always gave me
goose pimples, and it still does.
</P>
<P>
   ``I see this tournament, and it reminds me of all those old
feelings. You see the flags and the uniforms with the country names
on the front. You know it's special, especially for somebody with
my background, coming from where I did.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born and raised in Hamtramck and was looking at a life
as a factory worker or something like that. It's amazing to think
that just playing a sport could do all of this. It changed my whole
life. It gave me opportunities. It literally opened up the world to
me.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, 30 years after he was ignored, the world is there for Rudy
T's taking, as usual, the hard way.

Johnson at his best 
mighty hard to beat
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DALE ROBERTSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
EVERYWHERE we turn, there are conflicting data. It's almost worse
than Monica vs. the prez.
</P>
<P>
   But since he's going to be an important part of your lives for a
couple of months, assuming you're an Astros fan, it's probably
worth getting to the bottom of Randy Johnson. And that's where
we'll start, with his bottom.
</P>
<P>
   No, I'm serious. It makes him unique among major-league
pitchers. It's also why he needed surgery to repair the lowest
lumbar disk in his back Sept. 12, 1996, two days after he turned
33.
</P>
<P>
   ``Randy doesn't have a lot of thigh and buttocks mass,'' says
Stanley Herring, a physical therapist who was a member of Johnson's
medical team in Seattle. ``He has to use his spine and trunk more
than most pitchers to generate velocity on the ball. Fifty percent
of Randy's velocity, I'd guess, comes from his spine and trunk.''
</P>
<P>
   Spines and trunks aren't, of course, designed to throw baseballs
100 mph, a barrier the 6-10 Johnson flirts with routinely. And once
he had the delicate two-hour operation, although his recovery
proved spectacular beyond all reasonable hope, the Mariners' read
on him had changed drastically.
</P>
<P>
   No question, he was pitching like a $10 million-per-year
property last season, at least until a disappointing postseason. He
went 20-4 with a 2.28 ERA and 291 strikeouts, earning the right to
start the All-Star Game. But Seattle's management obviously didn't
trust its eyes, or his eye-popping statistics. The suits were
thinking like trust-fund investors, not sports fans.
</P>
<P>
   Bitterness subsiding
</P>
<P>
   And so the decision was made not to pick up the option year on
his contract, which led to his feeling betrayed. He pretty much
fell off the edge emotionally, sending his stats plunging as well.
His behavior, described by people close to him on a daily basis as
moody to the point of being brattish, had become as wildly erratic
as his performance.
</P>
<P>
   After beating the Pirates in his Astros debut Sunday, he's 10-10
this season with an ERA of 4.25. Yet over the previous three years,
he was 43-6 with a 2.57 ERA (coincidentally, his Astros ERA after
one start). In the century, Lefty Grove is the only lefthander to
post a better won-lost record over a similar number of decisions.
And of Grove's 46 victories in a 50-decision span in 1930-31, eight
came in relief.
</P>
<P>
   A mere 12 months ago, Johnson was unequivocally the best
lefthanded pitcher in baseball. Now, he's an Astro _ for the price
of three minor-leaguers.
</P>
<P>
   But in what must be the most favorably lopsided trade in
Houston's pro sports history, save for perhaps the Tampa Bay
pillaging that brought Earl Campbell to us as an Oiler, which Randy
Johnson did the Astros get?
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's warm greeting to a Seattle columnist in the Astros'
clubhouse before the game Sunday was an encouraging sign he is
moving on with his life. A couple nights earlier in the Kingdome,
after the trade came down, he had glowered at the local swarm of
reporters and warned it to stay away from him.
</P>
<P>
   Then later Sunday, when he spoke lovingly of his wife, Lisa, who
now has three young children to handle by her lonesome, you
realized his sense of perspective is fully intact.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's the one under the real pressure,'' he said. ``I call
home and hear the kids screaming and things breaking, and all I've
got to worry about is what to order from room service, or what to
watch on TV.''
</P>
<P>
   Astros like what they've seen
</P>
<P>
   You still sense a deep sadness in him over the way things turned
out _ he spoke wistfully of returning to Seattle to pitch in the
Mariners' new ballpark someday _ but he said nothing to make the
Astros concerned about having created an instant chemistry problem
for themselves. The amateur psychologists around Johnson say he has
a desperate need to be liked. Well, the Astros liked him, and he
seemed to like them.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros really liked the way he pitched. As a kid breaking
into organized ball, Brad Ausmus had opportunities to catch the
likes of Steve Carlton and Ron Guidry. He said the experience of
catching Johnson made him feel about as tingly.
</P>
<P>
   Manager Larry Dierker was asked to compare Johnson with the many
pitchers he has been around.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lefthanded J.R. Richard,'' Dierker said. ``J.R. might have
had a little more speed on his slider, but Randy has a better
fastball. The difference is J.R. got to face mostly righthanders,
whereas Randy only rarely sees a lefthanded hitter. Even so, look
at the kind of numbers he has put up.''
</P>
<P>
   We're looking, Dierk, believe me. But we're still having a hard
time grasping that he's ours.

ALBERTSON'S MAKES MOVE TO ACQUIRE LUCKY CHAIN
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DEBORAH ADAMSON  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Entrenching itself overnight in the Southern
California market after years of frustration, Albertson's Inc.
announced that it is acquiring the parent company of Lucky and
Sav-on for $11.7 billion in an exchange of stock and the assumption
of debt.
</P>
<P>
   The combined company, which will retain the Albertson's
corporate name but is expected to keep each chain's independent
identity, will become the largest grocery and drugstore chain in
the country. It will be headquartered in Boise, Idaho.
</P>
<P>
   The acquisition, announced Monday, comes at a time when
supermarket food revenues are under attack by large retailers such
as Wal-Mart and Kmart, and warehouse clubs like Costco. That
competition has spurred numerous supermarket mergers, the most
recent of which was the Ralphs Grocery Co. and Hughes Family
Markets combination that closed in February.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a strategic combination that will strengthen both
companies,'' said Victor Lund, chairman and chief executive officer
of American Stores Co., the Salt Lake City-based parent of Lucky
and Sav-on. ``I think it's a logical merger.''
</P>
<P>
   While executives don't expect to change store names, some
individual locations might be converted into one of the company's
other formats. In addition, analysts predict that as Albertson's
adds more services to its Lucky stores, prices will probably creep
upward.
</P>
<P>
   In the near future, prices and merchandise likely won't change
much, said Les Childress, a principal at Childress Investment
Research in Seattle. In the long run, however, it's rare to see
prices drop after a merger turns rivals into partners, he pointed
out.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's ``is not necessarily going to be the lowest'' priced
grocer because of the company's focus on providing more customer
services, said Patrick Schumann, a supermarket analyst at Edward
Jones in St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's spokeswoman Jenny Enochson said the company ``does
not have any immediate plans to make any drastic changes. Both
companies have traditionally been low-price leaders and it's a
position we plan to maintain.''
</P>
<P>
   It's not clear yet whether some stores will be closed in
Southern California, nor is it certain that the Lucky/Sav-on
Rewards Card will be kept since Albertson's does not have one. The
card provides customers with additional savings on selected items,
but requires them to register for the service and thus turn over
personal information that can be sold to marketers.
</P>
<P>
   However, Enochson said it's possible that the Lucky/Sav-on card
will remain available while Albertson's will remain card-free.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's has wanted to increase its presence in the Southern
California market but was never successful because the competition
was too heavy, said Walt Heller, vice president of research at
Progressive Grocer, a Darien, Conn., trade magazine.
</P>
<P>
   The competitive supermarket industry in the Southland also had
thwarted the efforts of Smith's Salt Lake City-based Food &AMP; Drug
Centers, which tried to enter the market twice. Smith's is now a
division of Fred Meyer.
</P>
<P>
   Schumann said it's cheaper and more effective for Albertson's to
acquire an established chain instead of building its own. By
picking American Stores, Albertson's executives get the store base
that they want and can run the expanded chain more efficiently than
its current management.
</P>
<P>
   Albertson's, with 916 stores in 23 Western, Midwestern and
Southern states, is known as one of the most profitable market
operators in the industry.
</P>
<P>
   American Stores, on the other hand, has struggled with declining
profitability at its 1,558 stores in 26 states. A restructuring
program more than a year ago to turn the company around didn't work
out, Schumann said.
</P>
<P>
   The merger also gives Albertson's the Sav-on drugstore chain,
which company officials and analysts believe will be an avenue of
growth for the new company. Albertson's has in-store pharmacies but
does not have stand-alone drugstores.
</P>
<P>
   The new company will operate more than 2,474 stores in 37 states
and employ more than 218,000 people. Combined 1998 revenues are
estimated at $36 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The deal, which was approved by both companies' directors, still
needs a green light from shareholders and regulators. It is
expected to close in early 1999.
</P>
<P>
   Gary Michael, chairman and chief executive officer of
Albertson's, will assume the same positions at the new company;
Lund will be vice chairman. The board of directors will expand to
20 from 15 members, to add Lund and four other American Stores
directors.

ANGELS NOTES: BROADCASTER STARR DIES
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JOE HAAKENSON  
 c.1998 San Gabriel Valley Tribune 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &LR; ANAHEIM, Calif. _ It's beginning to look more and more like
Todd Greene will be up with the Angels very soon, meaning there are
a couple of veteran players who have reason for concern.
</P>
<P>
   Greene has not played for the Angels this season because of
shoulder problems, but is now hitting .279 with seven homers and 18
RBIs in 28 games for triple-A Vancouver, playing mostly first base
and DH. The Angels say he's ready, but there has not been a place
on the big league roster for him.
</P>
<P>
   That will change soon. Manager Terry Collins promised Sunday
changes are in the works, and it could involve a trade or release
of either Dave Hollins or Cecil Fielder. Neither was in the
starting lineup Monday, and for Fielder, it was the second game in
a row he was on the bench.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want to say anything because I don't want to cause any
trouble, Fielder said when asked about sitting on the bench. ``It's
my job as a player to come to the ballpark every day and be ready
to play. So that's what I do.
</P>
<P>
   Hollins, however, is a more likely candidate to go. He's hitting
.244 with 10 homers and 36 RBIs (compared to Fielder's .241, 17
homers, 68 RBIs), and is not the most popular guy in the clubhouse.
</P>
<P>
   CONTRACT: The Angels extended Collins' contract through the 1999
season, picking up the option on the third year of his deal for
about $700,000.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just felt it was the right time, Angels general manager
Bill Bavasi said when asked about the timing of the announcement.
``We like the way he's gone about his business. He puts a lot of
effort and intensity into it. He has great dedication and he works
hard. Looking ahead, we felt it was obvious we were going to extend
the guarantee, so what better time? It sends a message to everybody
we do have faith in him.
</P>
<P>
   Said Collins: ``I'm real happy to be here, to stay here. It's a
great place, with great players. We think we're going to win for a
long time here. It's great to have them reward you, to have them
think you did a great job. That means a lot to a manager.
</P>
<P>
   Going into Monday's game, the Angels' record under Collins was
360-325.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you play the game the right way, he never has a problem
with you, shortstop Gary DiSarcina said. ``His way is the way my
dad taught -- always hustle, give everything you have that day and
do the little things it takes to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``Terry came here the last two years and turned the attitude of
the club around. After '96, it was so down in the dumps. He came in
and instilled confidence and aggressiveness.
</P>
<P>
   BOB STARR DIES: The Angels held a moment of silence before
Monday's game for announcer Bob Starr, who died Monday at his home
in Orange from pulmonary fibrosis.
</P>
<P>
   Starr, 65, had a 41-year career in broadcasting, including 15
with the Angels (1980-89, 93-97). He also broadcasted for the
Boston Red Sox and St. Louis Cardinals, as well as the NFL's Los
Angeles Rams and St. Louis Cardinals.
</P>
<P>
   Current Angels broadcaster Mario Impemba shared three years in
the booth with Starr.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a guy getting his first major-league job, it's an intense
experience, Impemba said of his rookie year in 1995. ``But Bob is
one guy who truly has no ego. If I had a problem, it was his
problem. He was more than just a broadcaster, he was a great man. I
know that sounds cliche, but believe me, when you spend 160-180
days with a person during a baseball season, you know what he's all
about. I enjoyed our personal relationship more than our
professional relationship.
</P>
<P>
   O'BRIEN: Catcher Charlie O'Brien, acquired in a trade from the
White Sox for two minor leaguers last week, was examined by Dr.
Lewis Yocum Monday and it was determined that his broken right
thumb has not adequately healed.
</P>
<P>
   O'Brien, whom the Angels had hoped would be ready this week,
will instead need another two to four weeks of rest and
rehabilitation. He'll go to Tulsa, Oklahoma for his rehab under the
care of Dr. Brett Boone, but the Angels are not happy with the
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it goes beyond what we anticipated, then we have a problem,
Bavasi said.
</P>
<P>
   Bavasi would not reveal what could be done about it, but it is
believed the Angels acquired O'Brien with a contingency clause: if
O'Brien's rehab takes more than a certain period of time, the
Angels might get another player (a minor leaguer) in the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's disappointing in the sense that I want a chance to play
for a team in the running, O'Brien said. ``But if you're not
healthy, it's obvious you're not going to be able to help. When )
come back, I'll be ready to play. I will be ready and I will help.
I promise that.

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ There are people in these environs who knew the
Brooklyn Dodgers, and these were no Brooklyn Dodgers. The team that
completed a four-game series against the Mets at Shea Stadium
Monday night wasn't even the Los Angeles Dodgers.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, their uniform shirts said Dodgers, and the scoreboard said
the team playing the Mets was the Dodgers. But the land of glitz
and glitter has lots of impostors and other phonies, so these
alleged Dodgers fit right in.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that these Dodgers were not populated with Jackie
Robinsons and Pee Wee Reeses or Sandy Koufaxes and Steve Garveys.
These Dodgers didn't even have Hideo Nomo and Mike Piazza. Come to
think of it, the Mets have Hideo Nomo and Mike Piazza, and they
were the Mets' starting battery Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   But enough digression. The Los Angeles Dodgers of Aug. 3, 1998,
had only 12 players who were on the opening-day roster, and they
had a different manager and general manager. The man in the dugout
running the team was not Bill Russell, the manager on opening day,
but Glenn Hoffman, and that man who walked into the visiting
clubhouse before the game with the title ``general manager
(interim)'' on his forehead was not Fred Claire, who served 11
years as the club's general manager, but Tommy Lasorda, who
preceded Russell as manager and held that job for 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   Fred Claire was in his new office somewhere in the Los Angeles
area; ``somewhere'' because his telephone number has one of those
anonymous new area codes. Why does Claire have a new office? Does
he have a new job? No, but as he explained the other day, he got up
every morning for 30 years and went to his office, so why should he
stop now?
</P>
<P>
   He didn't add, but could have, ``just because someone else
decided I shouldn't go to my office at Dodger Stadium anymore.''
The ``someone else'' would be one or more representatives of the
new owner of the Dodgers, Rupert Murdoch.
</P>
<P>
   It's not that he and they didn't have the right to fire Claire,
Russell, assorted coaches and more than half the players. It's just
that it was so un-Dodgerlike.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like they bought the house and they're going to change
the furniture,'' said Joey Amalfitano, a coach who survived the
midseason purge. ``That's exactly what they're doing. In Chicago, I
was there when the Wrigleys sold the Cubs to the Tribune Company.
Dallas Green came in there, and the staff was replaced except for
Billy Williams.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Dodgers never did things as other organizations do. They
retained managers until they were too old or feeble to take the
lineup card to home plate. They never fired people, which is why it
was humorous to hear Peter O'Malley say he would also have fired
Claire and Russell. Right. And he would have become a middle-aged
hippie, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's different here just because we haven't had turnover like
that,'' said Eric Karros, at 30 the elder statesman of these
Dodgers. ``But it's not much different from what goes on in other
organizations. Other organizations trade players, hire and fire
managers. Changes are made. It's no different here now.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott Radinsky, in his third season with the team, said he
hasn't been around long enough to expound on the previous
philosophy of the Dodgers, but he noted: ``This is 1998. That's the
way things are done now.''
</P>
<P>
   Karros, a member of the Dodgers since the last month of the 1991
season, said it was not for him to question the acts of ownership
or the front office.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe people outside identify the Dodgers with some ideal way
to run things and how baseball was, but it's not like that
anymore,'' he said. ``It's just the reality. Just like in every
walk of life, things change.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The purpose of the wholesale changes, like them or not, was to
improve the team. As Karros said, everyone will have to wait until
the end of the season to find out if the goal is met, if the
purpose justifies the purge.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers know they can't catch the San Diego Padres, not this
season. Their goal is the saving grace of the also-rans, the
wild-card spot in the playoffs. It's baseball's way of rewarding a
terrific season that falls just short of producing a division
championship, but it also rewards mediocrity in those instances
where there is no deserving nonchampion.
</P>
<P>
   If the Dodgers, who began the night five and a half games behind
the wild-card-leading Cubs, were to steal the spot, they would more
closely fit the mediocrity classification.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if the Dodgers were legitimately a wild-card contender,
Karros said: ``You look in the newspaper and see where they list
the NL wild card. We're in there. Four or five games in the loss
column isn't really a lot considering we have 50 games left.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``Obviously it's a reality, but it's a reality for
five or six teams.''

`BOZO' MARINERS BETTER NOT CLOWN AROUND WITH GRIFFEY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By LAURA VECSEY  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ The problem with the Mariners isn't necessarily that
they decided not to sign Randy Johnson to a new deal. It's that
they proclaimed last November there would be no new contract for
him.
</P>
<P>
   It stuck the Mariners with nine months of waffling and mood
swings _ both theirs and Johnson's.
</P>
<P>
   It created one heck of a public relations nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Worst of all, it sent a muddled, embarrassing message to fans
and Mariner players that there are serious flaws and gaps in
leadership within the organization.
</P>
<P>
   Who, exactly, is running the show? And what, exactly, are the
organization's objectives?
</P>
<P>
   The ramifications go beyond this slap-in-the-face deal the
Mariners were finally forced to make for Johnson, after their
shortsighted and confused tactics backfired. (No David Wells. No
Ismael Valdes. No 1998 contender.)
</P>
<P>
   We have learned one thing in the past few years: The Mariners
get themselves in trouble with proclamations.
</P>
<P>
   Chairman John Ellis made one about selling the team to induce
the state to come to the club's rescue. Chuck Armstrong made one,
saying Johnson would not be traded _ twice. Woody Woodward has made
them: Jose Cruz is untouchable.
</P>
<P>
   Why say never? Why make proclamations?
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners make proclamations so they look strong and
decisive. Then they go out and do the dumbest things. The net
effect is a string of body blows to Mariner credibility, which is
bad for business.
</P>
<P>
   Wonder why fans are getting suspicious of the club's motives and
intentions for fielding a competitive team?
</P>
<P>
   Some of us were foolish enough to think that, considering the
unusual talent on the club (Ken Griffey Jr., Edgar Martinez, Jay
Buhner, Alex Rodriguez and Johnson) that the Mariners would suck it
up and keep them all, at least until 2000 or 2001. Then, after the
new stadium opened, the M's could decide to get younger and
cheaper.
</P>
<P>
   Some of us thought that the positive public relations effect
alone _ not to mention that Johnson still could help the Mariners
win _ would be reason enough to keep That would entail bumping
payroll up through 2000 or 2001, just to see if this nucleus (with
better role players at third and left) could continue to contend.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners made another choice. Knowing that Johnson's
salary would have to be upwards of $9 to $10 million a year, they
declined to deal with him.
</P>
<P>
   The real problem with giving Johnson so much cash is that it
would have made even more glaring the problem with Griffey's
salary, namely that the reigning MVP is currently at $8 million _
well below market value.
</P>
<P>
   Signing Johnson to such a large contract also would have put
pressure on the Mariners in regard to Rodriguez, since he, too,
will command monstrous dollars when it's time to do a new deal.
</P>
<P>
   So the Mariners apparently decided that they would sit tight for
the next two seasons, until they were in the new ballpark, before
they started paying any player more than double-digit millions,
which is what it will take to re-sign Griffey and Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike the Yankees, Braves and Indians, the Mariners refused to
set a new salary level with Johnson. So he was cut loose _ only
without any shred of decency and fairness due to him and the fans.
</P>
<P>
   Now that the Mariners are free of this Johnson issue _ sort of _
they should start talking contract issues with the agents of
Griffey and Rodriguez.
</P>
<P>
   This organization also needs to realign its board of directors
and front office into a unified group.
</P>
<P>
   In this age of skyrocketing salaries, free agency and high fan
expectations, there is absolutely no way that a baseball
organization can operate effectively if its own house is not in
order.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariner owners appear to be anxiously treading water, trying
to hold on as the new $500 million stadium is completed and the
team moves into the new ballpark. Besides payroll on their minds,
they have stadium cost overruns to pay. Reports are that the state
is taking in more from sales taxes and lottery items than initially
anticipated (about $8 million above projections for this year) and
the Mariners may try to get some of that money.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, the intense emotion expended over the Johnson
boondoggle is more than justified. There were other ways the
Mariners should have handled that _ like trading him swiftly during
the off-season, getting value and never allowing mud and guck to
wreck Johnson's final days here.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone understands that the Mariner owners were gracious to
buy this team and keep baseball in Seattle. That was good. We still
appreciate it.
</P>
<P>
   Now comes the hard part. If the Mariners have learned anything
from this Randy Johnson meltdown, it's that you better know what
you are doing and act accordingly. Otherwise, to quote a friend,
you look like a bozo. Worse, you could end up with a bozo team.

ON 1ST DAY BACK, TEACHERS, PUPILS GET LESSON IN PROP. 227
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' California news file.) 
BY SHERRY JOE CROSBY AND DEBORAH SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ On the first day of school at Canoga Park
Elementary School, Jesus Hernandez counted from one to 99 in
English, while his mother, Gloria, watched with hope tempered by
skepticism.
</P>
<P>
   Hernandez, 40, wondered if the new English-immersion program
mandated by Proposition 227 would speed her son's mastery of the
language, or leave him stranded with neither the language nor the
academic skills he needs.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have many doubts,'' she said in Spanish. ``We're going to
see how it works out.''
</P>
<P>
   Feelings of doubt, confusion and hope were shared by many
parents and teachers Monday as California's new bilingual-education
law went into effect at 50 year-round schools in the Los Angeles
Unified School District.
</P>
<P>
   Throughout the district, about 10,000 students with limited
English proficiency in year-round schools started new semesters in
sheltered English-immersion programs _ the result of the state law
that effectively ended bilingual education for California's 1.4
million children who are not fluent in English.
</P>
<P>
   By the end of August, a total of 164 year-round schools will
have begun the immersion program, officials said. Other campuses
will begin offering the program in September, when most schools
start.
</P>
<P>
   Despite threats of civil disobedience by an organization of
teachers opposed to the law, district officials said classes seemed
to run smoothly Monday.
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had any reports of any major problems,'' LAUSD
spokesman Pat Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new law, passed by 61 percent of voters, schools are
required to teach non-native speakers in a one-year
English-immersion program. Students who already know English, are
10 years old or older, or those who have special needs can receive
a waiver.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said they didn't know how many waivers parents had
requested on the first day of the program. However, students must
remain in the English-immersion program for at least 30 days before
leaving.
</P>
<P>
   Although teachers are optimistic about the ultimate success of
the program, they must scramble to assemble teaching materials in
English, first-grade teacher Karen Berg and other faculty members
said.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, the Board of Education approved a request by
Superintendent Ruben Zacarias for $1 million in start-up costs and
teacher training for the English-immersion programs.
</P>
<P>
   But the first teacher-training seminars aren't scheduled until
Aug. 20 and 21 _ too late for teachers who headed back to class
Monday.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, state Superintendent of Public Instruction Delaine
Eastin announced the formation of a Proposition 227 task force to
help districts understand how to implement the law.
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Angeles Unified district, there are an estimated
312,000 students with limited English-proficiency. Of those, about
100,000 have been enrolled in bilingual education and will be
eligible for English-immersion programs, Spencer said.
</P>
<P>
   At Canoga Park Elementary on Monday, where 80 percent of
students have limited proficiency in English, Berg led her class in
reading aloud a list of English words such as ball, bed, bus, bike
and boat.
</P>
<P>
   But they counted numbers of objects from a work sheet with
instructions in Spanish.
</P>
<P>
   Maria Dolores Rojas, 30, whose 6-year-old daughter, Alejandra,
is in the same class as Jesus Hernandez, said young children will
benefit from the aggressive new approach.
</P>
<P>
   ``For them it's good,'' she said in Spanish. ``Because they're
little, they can learn quickly.''
</P>
<P>
   But Pedro Diaz, 33, whose 6-year-old daughter, Leslie, is also
in first grade at the school, said he worries she'll be left behind
by the accelerated program.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's traumatic,'' he said. ``At my house, we only speak
Spanish. To learn English is very difficult. They need more time
for training in English. They need probably two, three years.''
</P>
<P>
   In the Los Angeles district, parents have a range of four
options. Children can enroll in mainstream classes, one of two
English-immersion programs known as Model A and Model B, or opt out
of the program entirely by obtaining a waiver and enrolling in
traditional bilingual-education programs.
</P>
<P>
   In the Model A program, instructors teach entirely in English
and parent volunteers or teaching aides help children in their
native language.
</P>
<P>
   The Model B program requires instructors to teach lessons mainly
in English, but allows for the use of students' primary language to
clarify questions or give overviews of lessons.

TIME HAS COME FOR SEAHAWKS' BELLAMY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By CLARE FARNSWORTH  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHENEY, Wash. _ When Jay Bellamy signed with the Seahawks as a
college free agent in 1994, the last thing they needed was another
safety.
</P>
<P>
   Pro Bowl free safety Eugene Robinson and blossoming strong
safety Robert Blackmon were entrenched as the starters. The backups
were Rafael Robinson, an outstanding special-teams player; and Dave
McCloughan, son of Kent McCloughan, who was the roommate of
then-coach Tom Flores when both played for the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Bellamy not only beat some long odds, he flogged them in making
the roster as a fifth wheel at safety.
</P>
<P>
   Four seasons of maturing, developing and producing later,
Bellamy is the Seahawks' starting strong safety _ having outlasted
Blackmon, McCloughan, both Robinsons and even Flores. He also
survives Bennie Blades, last year's starter, who was forced to
retire in June because of three bulging discs in his lower back.
</P>
<P>
   In a lineup that includes four players who have been voted to
the Pro Bowl and twice that many who have been validated with
multimillion-dollar contracts, Bellamy's name jumps out because of
its obscurity.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't mind people not knowing who I am,'' Bellamy said
during a break at the team's Eastern Washington University training
camp. ``In fact, that's good. If people don't know who I am, they
don't know what to expect.''
</P>
<P>
   So who is Jay Bellamy?
</P>
<P>
   The buck-and-a-quarter explanation starts with Bellamy growing
up in New Jersey, where he played quarterback and free safety at
Matawan High School in Aberdeen. It continues with him deciding to
play for nearby Rutgers, where he lettered as a true freshman and
then was a three-year starter at cornerback and free safety,
finishing his career with 192 tackles and eight interceptions.
</P>
<P>
   But there is more to this priceless tale of Jay Bellamy, who has
shown he can be counted on although his salary will count only
$500,000 against the team's snug salary cap this season.
</P>
<P>
   Who is Jay Bellamy?
</P>
<P>
   Bellamy is not your typical NFL strong safety.
</P>
<P>
   He is 5-foot-11 and weighs 199 pounds. He gets by with quickness
and finesse, whereas the 230-pound Blades' game was bash and smash.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay's not Bennie, but then Bennie isn't Jay Bellamy,'' said
Darryl Williams, the team's Pro Bowl free safety, who is starting
opposite a different strong safety for the seventh straight season.
``Jay uses his speed. Bennie wanted to bang.''
</P>
<P>
   Or, as secondary coach Willy Robinson put it, ``Bennie was a
thumper. Jay is more of a make-you-miss guy and he still gets the
job done.''
</P>
<P>
   A perfect example of this occurred in Monday's morning practice,
when Bellamy skipped around a would-be blocker and slipped through
a gap to hit running back Ricky Watters before he could reach the
line of scrimmage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only question I have about Jay is: `Can he hold up for 16
games with the pounding you take at that position?' '' Williams
said. ``Other than that, I have no doubt Jay Bellamy is going to be
a player.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellamy is the kind of performer former Seahawks coach Chuck
Knox would have loved _ a football player who makes football plays
to help his team win football games.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, Bellamy set a club record by making 34 tackles covering
kickoffs and punts on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, he started the final seven games after Blades' back
would not allow him to play, and averaged five tackles. Only
linebackers Chad Brown (5.8 in six games) and Dean Wells (5.6)
averaged more in that stretch.
</P>
<P>
   The starts last year were the first for Bellamy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anybody knew what to expect from me last year,''
he said. ``But once they start watching film they'll see I'm a
solid, smart football player.''
</P>
<P>
   Bellamy has persevered, and is revered for making the jump from
college free agent to NFL starter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay Bellamy has come up through the system, and paid the price
it takes to do that,'' said Dave Brown, an NFL cornerback for 15
seasons who was a first-round draft choice by the Pittsburgh
Steelers in 1975 and now coaches the position for the Seahawks.
</P>
<P>
   ``He worked hard and played well on special teams to get into
this league and has continued to work hard to make the plays that
have allowed him to become a starter,'' Brown said. ``He has become
a leader by example, and as time goes on we're going to find out
just who Jay Bellamy is.''
</P>
<P>
   Those who already know Bellamy say the outcome will only be
positive.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Novak, an assistant sports information director at
Rutgers, points out that Bellamy choosing the Scarlet Knights over
larger schools was a key in the development of the school's sagging
football program.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jay came here as one of the most highly regarded players in
New Jersey,'' Novak said. ``He was one of the guys who made the
commitment to come to Rutgers and try and help build something.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need more Jay Bellamys.''
</P>
<P>
   So do the Seahawks.

OUTDOORS: FOR TWO THESPIANS, CLOSE-UP WITH BASS 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By NELSON BRYANT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GAY HEAD, Mass. _ As we got out of my pickup truck among the
dunes at Dogfish Bar, the sun was setting and a gentle southwest
breeze ruffled the waters of Vineyard Sound, moving the drooping
tips of beach grass to inscribe circles in the sand and bringing a
chorus of croaking frogs to us.
</P>
<P>
   The frog song was irritating, I told my companions, John Lehne
and Rip Torn, because it reminded me that the spot we were in _ one
of the East Coast's best sites for shore fishing for striped bass _
had been inaccessible by vehicle for all of June and part of July.
</P>
<P>
   The record rainfall had, in addition to boosting the ranks of
amphibians, overflowed the fresh water marsh that runs along the
south side of the Dogfish Bar road. This had been particularly
onerous, I added, because June is traditionally the best month for
stripers at that location. ``In general,'' I concluded, ``it's a
hit-or-miss proposition at Dogfish by late July.''
</P>
<P>
   My listeners, professional actors who met back in the '50s when
they joined the Actors Studio of New York, were aware, I believe,
that I was putting on a little performance to protect my reputation
as a reasonably skilled local angler should we fail to catch fish.
</P>
<P>
   Lehne, who summers in Edgartown on the opposite end of Martha's
Vineyard from Dogfish Bar, and I had fished together before. Torn,
who was visiting Lehne, was on the Vineyard for the first time.
</P>
<P>
   A few bass were surface feeding when we topped the dunes. But by
the time we reached the water's edge, all such activity ceased.
This gave me another opportunity for a pronouncement, this time to
the effect that there had been a distinct change in the stripers'
feeding habits this year. Their usual pattern was to move out of
deep water into the shallows only at dusk and thereafter; this
year, I noted, they had often herded baitfish, whether sand eels or
juvenile alewives or blueback herring, against the beach in early
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   Torn chose to use a fly rod. I gave him a blue-and-white
streamer of my own making and was pleased to see that he threw a
good line. Lehne stuck with his usual medium-weight spinning rod
and a jointed swimming plug with a dropper fly tied on ahead of the
plug.
</P>
<P>
   Using a duplicate of the fly I gave Torn, I hooked up on my
sixth cast and for a minute allowed myself to believe that I had a
keeper bass _ in Massachusetts, the minimum length is 28 inches _
because the fish took out all my fly line and got into the backing.
I quickly changed my mind when no more backing went through the
guides, and the fish did not fight like a bass.
</P>
<P>
   Beached, it proved to be a 7-pound bluefish. I kept it. Blues
have been scarce along the beaches since early in the season, and I
wanted to smoke a few more fillets. I was lucky. When I know
bluefish are about, I use a short length of fine wire leader at the
end of my regular leader to avoid having the fly cut off by their
sharp teeth, but the encounter was unexpected and I was fishing
without wire. My monofilament leader escaped being cut because the
fly was hooked in the side of the fish's mouth.
</P>
<P>
   Having taken the first fish, I had no more hits for the
remainder of the evening. Torn, however, caught his first fly-rod
striper and Lehne caught three or four bass as well as an American
shad, all on his dropper fly. What the shad was doing in Vineyard
waters eluded me. The nearest shad-spawning river was on the
mainland about 30 miles away. Late that night, Torn split and
broiled the shad at Lehne's house and both would pronounce it
excellent.
</P>
<P>
   Dedicated anglers, Lehne and Torn revisited Dogfish the
following evening and over a period of several hours on a dark,
gusty night with lightning flaring in the distance, caught summer
flounder and stripers. On our final night together, they and my
youngest son, Jeff, joined Ruth and me and her 98-year-old father,
Hein Kirchmeier, for supper.
</P>
<P>
   Our guests and Jeff brought some excellent red wine. I decided
to add zucchini squash fritters to the chicken, rice and salad.
That last-minute decision, plus the wine, a torrent of good talk
and Ruth's superb peach pie, disrupted our fishing schedule.
</P>
<P>
   We had planned to be at Dogfish by 5:30 the next morning to take
advantage of the stripers' altered feeding habits, but we didn't
arrive until 7:30. Even then I delayed the expedition by declaiming
Hamlet's lament _ which later stiffens into resolve _ when he
observes Fortinbras leading an army into battle for a worthless
little patch of ground.
</P>
<P>
   ``How all occasions do inform against me, and spur my dull
revenge ...'' I began, and plunged on, ignoring the croaking of the
frogs and Jeff's obvious desire to get to the water.
</P>
<P>
   My son led the way over the dunes and, when he reached the
highest point, turned and shouted that bass were breaking all along
the beach. Most of them had moved offshore by the time we began
casting, but from time to time over the next four hours small bands
of them made forays into the shallows and we all caught fish,
including one keeper that took John's dropper fly.
</P>
<P>
   I knew that Lehne had a keeper even before Torn walked up the
beach to tell me. Lehne shouts when he first hooks a bass, and when
it proves to be a keeper his hooting can be heard for half a mile
even when he is downwind in half a gale.
</P>
<P>
   We departed shortly before midnight and the happy mood of all
hands strongly suggested that good wine and good stories, zucchini
fritters, peach pie, blossoming friendships and Shakespeare can
enhance a mildly successful evening of fishing.

MILUTINOVIC AT THE TOP OF A SHORT LIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bora Milutinovic, the shrewd, colorful, multilingual Serb who
has coached four countries to the second round of the World Cup,
including the United States in 1994, appears to be the front-runner
to coach the U.S. team again.
</P>
<P>
   Alan Rothenberg, the outgoing president of the U.S. Soccer
Federation and the man who fired Milutinovic after the 1994 World
Cup, said there were four candidates to replace Steve Sampson, who
resigned last month after the American team finished last in the
World Cup. But Rothenberg seemed to clearly favor Milutinovic over
Carlos Alberto Parreira of Brazil, Carlos Queiroz of Portugal and
Bruce Arena of D.C. United.
</P>
<P>
   ``The public expects results, and Bora is a master strategist
and technician,'' Rothenberg said over the weekend. ``We need a
coach to do the best with what we have. We need to get maximum
results in qualifying for the World Cup in 2002, and Bora has a
proven record of accomplishing a lot with less talent.''
</P>
<P>
   Arena, the only American candidate, has had some support from
people around Rothenberg, but he is apparently last on Rothenberg's
list. Rothenberg did not even interview Arena over the weekend as
originally scheduled while in Orlando, Fla., for the Major League
Soccer All-Star Game.
</P>
<P>
   ``My assumption is that a decision has been made,'' said Arena,
who coached D.C. United to the title in the first two years of MLS
after leading Virginia to five national titles at the college
level.
</P>
<P>
   And apparently showing a preference for Milutinovic over
Parreira and Queiroz, both of whom he has interviewed, Rothenberg
said, ``We need someone who knows the country and the language,
someone who has been there.''
</P>
<P>
   Milutinovic has taken Mexico, Costa Rica, the United States and
Nigeria to the second round of the World Cup. He had signed to
coach this year's Nigerian team only through the World Cup.
</P>
<P>
   Rothenberg will make his decision on the coach in conjunction
with the man he has endorsed to replace him as president of the
federation later this month. He has endorsed Dr. Robert Contiguglia
of Colorado over Larry Monaco, a retired lawyer from Washington,
and the federation is expected to follow that choice in an election
on Aug. 22.
</P>
<P>
   Hank Steinbrecher, the general secretary of the federation, said
the new coach will be announced a few days before the election.

ONLY MENDOZA'S PITCHES ARE ON THE MOVE 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Ramiro Mendoza is the Calvin Coolidge of the
New York Yankees, virtually silent among louder teammates such as
Tim Raines and Derek Jeter. David Wells prepares for his starts by
absorbing heavy metal music loud enough to shake the lungs. Mendoza
flops on a couch and quietly watches television, with the hazy look
of a teen-ager on summer vacation.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza is just as nondescript as a pitcher. Sometimes he is in
the starting rotation, sometimes he relieves; he just takes the
ball when Manager Joe Torre asks. Mendoza does not strike out many
batters, and does not throw hard enough to intimidate them. But
twice in the last six months, the Yankees refused to include
Mendoza in a trade for a major star _ first Chuck Knoblauch, then
Randy Johnson _ ferociously clinging to the right-handed pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's versatile, he throws strikes, he's durable and he's never
had any arm problems,'' said Mark Newman, the Yankees' vice
president for player development.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees are convinced that Mendoza will get better, as he
learns to command his sinking fastball _ a pitch that can be as
effective as Mariano Rivera's fastball or David Cone's slider.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza's sinker typically breaks downward from left to right,
at the feet of right-handed hitters. And despite the terrific
movement of his pitches, Mendoza consistently throws strikes; this
year, he has allowed just 19 walks in 96 innings.
</P>
<P>
   Hitters have no choice but to swing at Mendoza's sinker, and
they usually beat the ball into the dirt. Through games of July 21,
Mendoza was averaging 2.38 ground balls for every fly ball. (The
Yankees' staff was averaging 1.41 ground balls for every fly ball.)
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza generates sinkers by cocking his wrist, with his index
finger and middle finger gripping the ball along the seams, and
then snapping his wrist and fingers at the instant of delivery,
like a buggy whip, and the ball spins with unusual alacrity. Cone
thinks Mendoza's relatively long fingers create the additional
torque; Newman theorizes that it could be the flexibility of
Mendoza's wrist _ ``He has absolutely no stiffness'' _ or any
number of factors.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever the source, Mendoza's sinker spins and darts and dives
through the strike zone. Torre and others in the Yankees
organization are convinced that Mendoza is gradually gaining
control of his pitches. He has shown consistent improvement
throughout his career. He went 4-5 with a 6.79 earned run average
for the Yankees in 1996, 8-6 with a 4.24 ERA last year. This
season, Mendoza is 6-2 with a 3.47 ERA.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees signed Mendoza in 1991, when he was 19 and living in
Los Santos, Panama, and at that time he did not even throw a
two-seam fastball. Yankees coaches showed him the grip and, after a
trial period, Mendoza told them he did not want to throw it
anymore. He could not control it, he said, because it moved too
much.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza was assured that too much movement was a good thing,
and, throwing his sinker, he progressed steadily through the minor
leagues, always quiet and reliable. Every coach or manager who
worked with him loved Mendoza, Newman said.
</P>
<P>
   Torre, too, quickly took a liking to Mendoza and appreciated him
for his versatility. Some pitchers cannot pitch on consecutive days
and do not have the mind-set required to work in short relief. Some
relievers do not have the repertory to start.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza can do either. When Orlando Hernandez was inserted into
the rotation in June, Mendoza moved back into the bullpen with
ease. The Yankees will play a doubleheader Tuesday, and Mendoza
will make his 13th start of the season.
</P>
<P>
   ``All we know is he is going to be used to win games, and help
the team win,'' Newman said. ``When you build clubs, roster
flexibility like that is absolutely critical.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Had the Yankees traded Hideki Irabu for Johnson last week, and
then seen Johnson leave as a free agent after the season, they
would have operated with the comforting knowledge that Mendoza
could step into the rotation next season. If Jeff Nelson does not
come back from a back problem, Mendoza will assume some of the
crucial innings Nelson would have pitched in the postseason.
</P>
<P>
   Mendoza wanted to stay in the rotation, and Torre could tell he
was hurt when the change was made, but he has continued to go about
his business as quietly and efficiently as ever. ``Even though they
took him out of the rotation, he has to have some feelings the
Yankees want him and they want to keep him,'' said Rivera,
Mendoza's closest friend on the team.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the trade rumors, Mendoza smiles and says he
does not worry about it, that he just wants to help the team win.
The Yankees, who could have traded him for Johnson, are convinced
he will do exactly that.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH:
</P>
<P>
   David Cone was named the American League pitcher of the month.
... Joe Girardi is recovering from back spasms and may not be able
to play in the next couple of days, which means that Jorge Posada
will catch both games of Tuesday's doubleheader.

NEWLY NAMED MARKETSPAN HEAD UNVEILS A SHARE BUYBACK PLAN 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BRUCE LAMBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   GARDEN CITY, N.Y. _ Moving to restore investor confidence and
boost its stock price, the Marketspan energy company announced
Monday that it would buy back as much as a tenth of its shares.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement came as Marketspan's new chairman, Robert B.
Catell, outlined his plans for the troubled two-month-old company
in conference calls with reporters, investors and industry
analysts.
</P>
<P>
   Calling Marketspan's stock price ``greatly undervalued,'' Catell
said the directors would begin buy-backs on Aug. 13, and would
consider further buy-backs if warranted. The company has 15.8
million shares, and buying a tenth of them at current prices would
cost about $450 million.
</P>
<P>
   The company has plenty of cash to do this _ it received about $2
billion for selling part of the old Long Island Lighting Co. to a
state agency.
</P>
<P>
   After Marketspan's creation on May 28, the company's stock hit a
high of $37.625 per share before sliding to $26.50 during the
dispute about the severance its chairman had received as Lilco's
chairman. Monday it closed at $28.625, up $1.0625 from its close on
Friday, when the chairmanship issue was resolved.
</P>
<P>
   Cattel also said that the company plans to grow through
expansion, mergers and acquisitions. But he did not rule out
selling the company. He outlined an effort that would convert Long
Island residents from using oil heat to using natural gas.
</P>
<P>
   Marketspan has had a rocky beginning since being created by the
merger of the Brooklyn Union Gas affiliates with what was left of
Lilco after its electricity service was sold to the Long Island
Power Authority.
</P>
<P>
   A furor erupted with the disclosure that Marketspan's chairman,
Dr. William J. Catacosinos, had received a $42 million severance as
Lilco's chairman. That dispute developed into a battle for control
of the company and its corporate strategy. Catacosinos was forced
out on Friday, and the company's board unanimously promoted Catell,
who was Marketspan's president and who had headed Brooklyn Union.
</P>
<P>
   Several major institutional investors had endorsed Catacosinos
and his explorations into selling the Marketspan company, believing
that it would quickly boost the value of their stock. But some
others opposed him, and at least 11 stockholder lawsuits over the
bonus were filed.
</P>
<P>
   Catell began Monday's telephone session with up to 150 investors
and analysts by citing Brooklyn Union's record.
</P>
<P>
   He emphasized his concept of expanding Marketspan, and declined
to answer whether there had been offers to buy Marketspan. Catell
also said he would not rule out selling Markestspan at a price that
would reflect its long-term value, but added that it is now
undervalued.
</P>
<P>
   Catell declined to comment Monday on the results of a review of
the severance payments made to former Lilco executives by a special
directors' committee and an outside law firm, saying that was
confidential board matter.
</P>
<P>
   A company spokesman, however, confirmed a report from state
Attorney General Dennis Vacco, that in return for Catacosinos'
resignation, the board allowed him use of an office and secretary
and security protection at his home for a year, plus the cost of
reasonable legal expenses for company-related litigation.
</P>
<P>
   To ease anxieties within Marketspan's staff, Catell said, ``I
have begun the process of reassuring employees affected by the
uncertainty of the last few months.'' He said he planned to meet
with Brooklyn Union workers Monday and with former Lilco workers on
Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Catell said he would stand by his commitment that there would be
no layoffs, but said he would consider reductions such as attrition
and early retirement incentives.

DEMOCRATS IN NEW YORK RACES SAY THEY STILL SUPPORT CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By ADAM NAGOURNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a strong show of partisan backing, New York
Democrats running for the U.S. Senate and for governor voiced
support for President Clinton Monday, saying they accepted his
denials of an affair with a White House intern and would be
delighted if he would campaign with them for this fall's general
election.
</P>
<P>
   Despite signs of a growing political crisis for Clinton in
Washington, the New York candidates _ running in a Democratic
primary in a state that has always been a strong source of support
for Clinton _ offered no criticism of Clinton's handling of the
investigation. Instead, in a series of interviews, they attacked
the independent counsel, Kenneth Starr, and said they did not
believe that Clinton's difficulties would disrupt their campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   The show of support by nearly all the candidates _ only Peter
Vallone, the New York City Council speaker who is running for
governor, declined to respond to telephone calls seeking his
opinion on the matter _ stood out amid signs of some nervousness
among other supporters of Clinton across the nation. The remarks
came as it became increasingly clear that, for better or worse, the
president's legal difficulties will be a constant and dominant
presence for the Democratic candidates for Senate and governor as
they enter into the heat of the primary races.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, Clinton's difficulties seem likely to
complicate efforts by the candidates to win attention for contests
that have had strikingly low profiles so far. Clinton is to
testify, by closed-circuit television, before the independent
counsel's grand jury on Aug. 17, not even a month before the Sept.
15 New York primary.
</P>
<P>
   One campaign aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he
was resigned to there being little if any news coverage of the
races for governor and the Senate for at least a week, if not
longer, after the president's grand jury testimony. And if the
story does not abate, this Democrat suggested that it was unlikely
that Clinton would want to come to New York and the spotlight of
its intense media coverage, to campaign on behalf of any candidate.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the candidates were supportive of the president and
confident that his difficulties would not disrupt their
candidacies.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president said nothing happened,'' said Geraldine Ferraro,
a Senate candidate. ``Until and unless he says anything otherwise,
there's no reason to believe otherwise.''
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of us have gotten hugs from President Clinton,'' she
said, referring to a videotape that shows Clinton embracing the
intern, Monica Lewinsky. ``I know him quite well, and I just say it
doesn't seem like anything more to me. His behavior is not anything
different from what I've seen with other people _ including myself.
He'll come over and give you a hug and a kiss.''
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Ferraro, a former congresswoman, said she did not think that
Clinton should be removed from office even if it turned out that he
lied about Ms. Lewinsky. ``Lying about a sexual affair is hardly a
high crime or misdemeanor,'' she said. ``As a lawyer, you have to
explain to me how that ends up being a problem for the nation.''
</P>
<P>
   Mark Green, the New York City public advocate and candidate for
Senate, said that given the apparently conflicting accounts from
Clinton and Ms. Lewinsky, ``I believe a man who is both my friend
and my president.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I do believe, and want to believe, the president,'' he said.
``But nothing he's been alleged to have done is as one-hundredth as
bad as Ken Starr's prosecutorial and ideological jihad.''
</P>
<P>
   The third Senate candidate, Rep. Charles Schumer of Brooklyn,
said he would not comment specifically on Clinton's statements.
Schumer is a member of the Judiciary Committee, and thus would sit
in on any impeachment proceedings, if it came to that. But, Schumer
said: ``I think he's doing a fine job on the things people care
about. I think it's a shame he has to spend all his time on this.''
</P>
<P>
   Lt. Gov. Betsy McCaughey Ross, a Democratic candidate for
governor, said she would gladly campaign with Clinton, and attacked
what she described as Starr's ``reign of legal terror.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He started off investigating Whitewater,'' she said. ``Now,
he's onto whether Clinton stole kisses _ or any other sexual favors
_ in the White House.''
</P>
<P>
   Another gubernatorial candidate, Charles J. Hynes, the Brooklyn
district attorney, said he did not have ``any reason to disbelieve
him.'' He called Clinton ``an extraordinary president for something
that has been of paramount concern to me, and has been for 25
years, and that is the end of bloodletting in Northern Ireland.''
</P>
<P>
   The candidates all said they had encountered no indications that
voters were concerned about the allegations against Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, in a year and half of campaigning, I have never once
been asked about the president,'' said James L. Larocca, a former
state transportation commissioner who is now a candidate for
governor.

SHEFFIELD ON HOLD
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The decision to suspend Los Angeles Dodgers
right-fielder Gary Sheffield won't be announced until today after
National League president Leonard Coleman met Monday with Sheffield
to discuss his involvement in the June 28 bench-clearing brawl
between the Dodgers and Pittsburgh Pirates.
</P>
<P>
   Umpires' reports have Pirates' catcher Jason Kendall throwing
the first punch at Sheffield after the two became tangled in a near
collision at home plate. Kendall lost his appeal last month and
served a three-game suspension.
</P>
<P>
   But Coleman could shorten the suspension based on the report and
his meeting with Sheffield. Suspensions rarely are overturned.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think the delay is a good sign,'' Sheffield said. ``I think
they now know that this wasn't my fight. He started yelling at me,
then came after me. I think I had a good case and presented it
well.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheffield was in a similar situation in 1992, when he played
with San Diego. He was suspended for three games after an
altercation with then Mets catcher Todd Hundley, who claimed he was
looking back at home plate to intercept signs. Sheffield went to
the league office and had his suspension reduced to two games.
</P>
<P>
   __ Losing steam: The Mets filed a protest over Friday's game,
claiming the the Dodgers had Eric Young lead off before activating
him off the disabled list.
</P>
<P>
   They traded Wilton Guerrero to Montreal eight minutes before
game time. The Mets claim Robert Schweppe, assistant to general
manager Tom Lasorda, was notified of the move in Los Angeles and
told the National League that infielder Tripp Cromer was going on
the 15-day disabled list and Young was coming off.
</P>
<P>
   The Mets have not acknowledged that they are protesting the
game, but New York sources said the team is close to dropping its
complaint.
</P>
<P>
   __ Mr. July: Chan Ho Park, who flew ahead of the team to
Montreal, was named National League Pitcher of the Month after
going 4-0 with a 1.05 ERA in July. In the past two seasons, Park
has gone 9-0 in July with a 1.50 ERA (14 earned runs in 832/3
innings.
</P>
<P>
   __ Quick hits: Bobby Bonilla, on the disabled list since July 15
with soreness to his surgically repaired left wrist, took 50 swings
in batting practice and said he could return to lineup by Thursday
in Montreal.... Antonio Osuna pitched 12/3 scoreless innings.
Before the trip he had allowed 10 earned runs in 81/3 innings.
Since then, Osuna has retired 12 of 15 batters and not given up a
run.... The biggest cheer of the night came in the ninth inning,
when a fan in a business suit ran onto the field and did a
head-first slide into home. He was taken away by police.

<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By CARLTON THOMPSON &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
MIAMI _ Give the Astros credit for getting acclimated to their
environment. On a sloppy night at Joe Robbie Stadium, their
performance was a perfect match.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to being pounded by rain over the final four
innings, the Astros took quite a beating from the Florida Marlins,
who tagged the visitors with a humbling 11-3 loss Monday night.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you're getting beat like that, and you have to stand
around in the rain, that's not very fun,'' Astros first baseman
Jeff Bagwell said.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the lopsided score, the Marlins weren't having much fun
in the game's aftermath. Their celebration was dampened when second
baseman Craig Counsell was hit in the face by a pitch from Astros
reliever C.J. Nitkowski, who tied a major-league record by hitting
three consecutive batters in the eighth inning.
</P>
<P>
   Counsell immediately left the game and was taken to the hospital
for X-rays. The Marlins fear he might have suffered a broken jaw,
which would end his season.
</P>
<P>
   The Astros had to think Monday night would never end,
considering the way they pitched. Four Astros pitchers surrendered
13 hits and faced 41 batters in just eight innings.
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins' 11 runs were the most scored against the Astros
this season, and it marked only the second time this season the
Astros allowed an opponent to score in double figures.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you don't pitch well, it can get ugly, and we certainly
didn't pitch well,'' Astros manager Larry Dierker said.
</P>
<P>
   The elements didn't exactly favor the pitchers, who had trouble
gripping the ball because of the rain and humidity. Their uniforms
were so wet, the pitchers didn't have a dry place to rub their
hands. Pitchers kept requesting towels from the dugout during the
3-hour, 25-minute affair.
</P>
<P>
   As the playing field absorbed water and lightning crackled in
the distance, one could only wonder when umpire crew chief Ed
Montague would delay the game. He never did.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a tough situation,'' Montague said. ``We got a report
that the rain probably wasn't going to stop. The Astros are in a
pennant race, and you have to give them every chance you can.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew that if I had stopped the game, we probably weren't
coming back out on the field. Our main objective was to get the
game in. Lightning is always a concern to me, but I was keeping my
eye on it.''
</P>
<P>
   Dierker, who wasn't at all pleased with the way his team played,
refused to use the weather as an excuse.
</P>
<P>
   ``The conditions were the same for both teams,'' he said. ``They
handled it better than we did.''
</P>
<P>
   The Marlins didn't have any problem handling Astros starter Sean
Bergman, who was working with one extra day of rest because of the
acquisition of Randy Johnson. If the extended rest did Bergman any
good, it didn't show Monday.
</P>
<P>
   It was clear from the outset Bergman (10-6) wasn't working with
his ``A'' material. He surrendered more than a few hard-hit balls
and didn't get much help from his fielders when the Marlins scored
their first two runs.
</P>
<P>
   Marlins center fielder Todd Dunwoody led off the first inning
with a triple and scored on a base hit by Edgar Renteria. Then, the
defense fell apart. Renteria stole second base, advanced to third
on a throwing error by catcher Brad Ausmus and scored the Marlins'
second run on Ricky Gutierrez's throwing error.
</P>
<P>
   And that was just one play.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just sloppy,'' Dierker said. ``We seemed a little
flat, but I don't think this is something that will linger.''
</P>
<P>
   The Astros tied the game in the fourth with a pair of solo
homers by Derek Bell and Carl Everett. Bell's homer was his 16th of
the season, and Everett homered for the 12th time.
</P>
<P>
   ``After the home runs, I thought we might be on our way,''
Dierker said. ``But I wasn't kidding myself into thinking that Sean
would turn it around, because he hadn't shown any signs that he
would.''
</P>
<P>
   The 2-2 tie was as close as the Astros could come to making this
a competitive game. The Marlins reclaimed their two-run lead in the
bottom of the fourth, which started with a single by Cliff Floyd
and a double by Derrek Lee. Floyd and Lee scored on a pair of
groundouts.
</P>
<P>
   Gregg Zaun, who had a career-high four RBIs, stretched the
Marlins' lead to 6-2 with a two-run single off lefthanded reliever
Trever Miller in the sixth inning.
</P>
<P>
   ``We just played a terrible game,'' Dierker said. ``It was a
letdown from (the three-game sweep at Pittsburgh). We seemed flat,
but you always look that way when your pitching is poor, and our
pitching was very poor.''
</P>
<P>
   Craig Biggio pulled the Astros within three runs with an RBI
single in the seventh. The Marlins' bittersweet eighth inning began
with Lee's single to right and was followed by Nitkowski's hitting
three straight batsmen. The last misguided pitch was the worst. It
struck Counsell on the side of his face.
</P>
<P>
   Dierker lifted Nitkowski in favor of Jay Powell after Counsell
left the game with blood dripping from his mouth. By the time the
inning was over, the Marlins had sent 11 batters to the plate and
scored five runs on four hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just thinking, `Please! Somebody make an out,''' Bagwell
said.
</P>
<P>
   Powell, whom the Astros acquired in a trade with the Marlins,
eventually recorded three outs to bring the brutal inning to an
end.
</P>
<P>
   ``That was just bad,'' Powell said. ``When it's going like that,
you think it will never end. Even when you made good pitches, they
hit them. That's just the way it goes sometimes.''

<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ So how will Dallas Cowboys free-agent
running back Beau Morgan celebrate his 23rd birthday on Tuesday?
</P>
<P>
   Eating some birthday cake, perhaps?
</P>
<P>
   No, he plans to go out and endure the usual bump-and-grind of
two-a-day practices in temperatures hovering around 100 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Other than that,'' he said, ``I won't do anything really
special.''
</P>
<P>
   Don't be surprised if the fans gathered Tuesday at Midwestern
State University to watch the Cowboys sing Morgan a rousing version
of ``Happy Birthday''. The 5-10, 192-pound former Air Force Academy
quarterback has become a fan favorite.
</P>
<P>
   With his extra effort in the preseason game Friday against
Seattle, Morgan ignited cheers every time he touched the ball. He
led the Cowboys in rushing with 53 yards on 16 carries and caught
two passes for 21 yards.
</P>
<P>
   If he wasn't leaving camp next week to return to Peterson Air
Force Base in Colorado Springs, Colo., to continue his military
commitment, he might have a role this season as the Cowboys' spark
plug.
</P>
<P>
   ``Really, that kind of rests on him more than it does us at this
point, because he's got to apply for the ability \Rto leave the Air
Force\S to get out and play,'' Gailey said. ``But he'd make a real
run at making this football team if he was going to be here.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time the Cowboys had a player committed to the Air
Force, owner Jerry Jones wrote a letter to the Department of
Defense. Defensive tackle Chad Hennings wound up leaving his Air
Force commitment a year early to join the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, as far as being able to get out \Rof his military
commitment\S, that's in the hands of the secretary of the Air
Force,'' Morgan said. ``Typically, you have a five-year commitment
when you graduate.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan signed a free-agent contract with the Cowboys on April
24, 1997. He was in training camp last season for about three weeks
before leaving to start his military commitment.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy being in the Air Force right now, and I'm thrilled
to be able to serve my country,'' Morgan said. ``But if within a
year they decide they want me to come down here and represent them
in another way with the Cowboys, I'll be happy to do that. It's a
win-win situation.''
</P>
<P>
   Hennings said he got out of his military commitment a year early
because of the Gulf War, and the fact the Air Force wanted to
reduce its forces at the time. If Morgan can't get an early leave
from his military commitment, Hennings believes that he is worth
the Cowboys waiting on _ even if it takes three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he's got a definite future here, and he showed that in
the last preseason game,'' Hennings said. ``He's a kid that works
really hard on and off the field, he has great character both on
and off the field, and he's a great competitor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him just to be patient, work out and prepare yourself
for when you get the opportunity.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan said he views Hennings as a role model whom he can turn
to in the tough times.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chad kind of took me under his wing last year, and this year
we've hung out a little bit together,'' he said. ``We relate really
well. There's a real close fraternity of players that graduate from
the Academy.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan played high school football for his father, Barry Morgan,
leading Trinity Christian-Addison to consecutive state titles in
1991 and '92. He grew up a Cowboys fan, so donning a Cowboys
uniform has special meaning for him.
</P>
<P>
   ``Being able to come back here and have the opportunity to play
in Dallas is like living out a dream,'' Morgan said. ``I'm a firm
believer in God's providence in everything, and I think this is a
sure case of that.''
</P>
<P>
   At this point, Morgan is pleased to have whatever opportunities
the Cowboys give him.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know the coaches have been very patient with me,'' he said.
``They understand the situation, so any reps that I get from here
on out are just icing on the cake.''
</P>
<P>
   Make that icing on Morgan's birthday cake.

VELARDE LIFTS ANGELS

<TEXT>
<P>
   ANAHEIM, Calif. _ The scene of the crime: Edison Field. The
crime: kidnapping.
</P>
<P>
   After the Anaheim Angels played soundly in all facets of the
game in an 11-4 victory over the Cleveland Indians Monday night,
the only question on the minds of many of the 25,339 in attendance
was: ``What happened to the !ital!real!off! Angels?''
</P>
<P>
   The Angels who played nearly flawless baseball against the AL
Central leaders Monday bore no resemblance to the Angels who had
lost four in a row, five of six on the homestand, and 20 of 29
since the end of June.
</P>
<P>
   And in fact, there was an addition to the team that seemed to
make all the difference in the world. Second baseman Randy Velarde,
who had played in only two games this season trying to come back
from reconstructive elbow surgery, sparked the team with three
hits, including a double, two runs scored and an RBI.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels had 10 hits in all, including a three-run home run by
Tim Salmon (No. 19) that capped a five-run second inning off losing
pitcher Jaret Wright (9-7).
</P>
<P>
   Angels starter Steve Sparks (5-2) gave up three runs and seven
hits in 51/3 innings to get the win, and got help from relievers
Pep Harris and Trevor Wilson. Harris replaced Sparks with one out
and the bases loaded in the sixth, and got out of the inning by
striking out Sandy Alomar and getting David Bell on a popup. Wilson
pitched the final two innings to close it out in his Angels debut.
</P>
<P>
   The Angels also got stellar play in the field. Right fielder
Garret Anderson played a drive off the wall and threw out Manny
Ramirez trying for a double in the second inning.
</P>
<P>
   Shortstop Gary DiSarcina dived to his right to make a catch on a
line drive hit by Bell in the third. And left fielder Orlando
Palmeiro made a diving catch of a liner hit by Omar Vizquel in the
third.
</P>
<P>
   There was cause for concern for the Angels, however, in this
one. Darin Erstad grabbed his left hamstring after beating out an
infield hit in the seventh inning. He had to leave the game but was
diagnosed with a slight strain and is listed as day-to-day.
</P>
<P>
   There may be other reasons for the sudden change of fortune, but
the addition of Velarde was the most obvious. He went 3 for 5 in
games May 13 and 14 in Chicago, where he suffered a stress fracture
in the elbow. He thought his season, and maybe his career, was
through.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wrote myself off, personally,'' Velarde said. ``It was
something I had never really done. That's how excruciating the pain
was. But I got a reprieve and now I'm taking advantage of it.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde said he plans to play every day and hold nothing back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's no walk in the roses out there,'' he said. ``It's (guts)
to the wall. If it's not good enough, I shouldn't be out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde said he believes he can spark the team simply by
presenting a new attitude.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want all the responsibility, or whatever, that's out
there,'' he said. ``Pressure. I want it all. These guys are tired.
I'm a fresh body. If I can give the kick these guys need, fine. I
want all fingers pointed at me.''
</P>
<P>
   Velarde got the Angels' first hit of the game, singling Orlando
Palmeiro (walk) to third base in the bottom of the first inning. It
was Velarde's first hit in Anaheim since Sept. 25, 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, he singled with two out to drive home Troy
Glaus. And in the fourth, he doubled to right-center.

YANKEES ENJOY THEMSELVES AND CHARGE IT TO OQUIST 
</HEADLINE>
  (lh) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Some baseball fans are loath to compare the
1998 Yankees to the '27 Yankees of Murderers' Row fame. The
firepower is not the same, they say. Paul O'Neill is no Babe Ruth,
they say. Chuck Knoblauch is no Tony Lazzeri.
</P>
<P>
   Don't tell that to Mike Oquist.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees embarrassed the Oakland pitcher Monday night for 14
runs in five innings, including 16 hits and four home runs,
battering the Athletics, 14-1.
</P>
<P>
   The 14 runs charged to Oquist were the most allowed by a
major-league pitcher since Aug. 14, 1977, when Milwaukee's Bill
Travers surrendered 14 to the Cleveland Indians. And the Yankees
(78-28) finished the game with 17 hits.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch had two homers, a double and five runs batted in _ the
most RBIs he has had in any game in his career _ and every Yankee
starter scored at least one run in the first three innings. Orlando
Hernandez (6-3) pitched a complete game.
</P>
<P>
   If the Yankees could order out for a pitcher, they would ask for
a right-handed pitcher with a fastball of average speed, an average
breaking ball and average command.
</P>
<P>
   By the time Oquist had thrown six pitches, Knoblauch and Derek
Jeter each had hit doubles. Oquist got through the rest of the
inning without allowing another run.
</P>
<P>
   Any semblance of competition ended in the second inning,
however. Chad Curtis singled. Jorge Posada walked. Scott Brosius
hit a single to the shortstop hole, and when Miguel Tejada threw
the ball away, Curtis scored and the other runners advanced to
second and third.
</P>
<P>
   Oquist appeared completely rattled, or else he was tiring, or
both. He threw three fastballs head-high to Knoblauch, far out of
the strike zone, fired a strike, came back with another fastball.
Knoblauch hit the ball, probably as far as he has ever hit a ball
in his life, high over the left-center-field wall. Three more runs.
</P>
<P>
   Even with the Yankees winning, 5-0, nobody moved in the Oakland
bullpen. The Yankees and Athletics are playing a doubleheader
Tuesday, and Oakland Manager Art Howe obviously saw no purpose in
burning up a couple of relievers in this game.
</P>
<P>
   The hit parade continued. Jeter singled. O'Neill reached out
and, with just his right foot on the ground, smashed a changeup
over the left-field wall, a two-run home run.
</P>
<P>
   Bernie Williams ripped a grounder inside the first-base bag, a
double. Tino Martinez laced a single to left, scoring Williams, the
eighth consecutive Yankees hitter to reach base at the start of the
inning. Oquist had thrown 60 pitches and had managed to get only
three outs.
</P>
<P>
   But Darryl Strawberry struck out and, to that point, he was
responsible for two of the Yankees' four outs in the game. Oquist
retired the next two hitters and was out of the inning.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland's white flag came up in the third inning, after Brosius
led off with a single.
</P>
<P>
   Jason Giambi, the Athletics' first baseman, stood far behind
Brosius, rather than holding him at the bag. Oakland just wanted to
get through this game with its pitching staff intact.
</P>
<P>
   But there was no mercy for Oquist. He threw a sharp-breaking
curveball to Knoblauch, and somehow the Yankees' second baseman
reached down and hooked a line drive over the left-field wall, for
his second home run, his third extra-base hit in three innings.
</P>
<P>
   O'Neill singled with one out and took second on a grounder. Then
Martinez lashed his second run-scoring single of the game (giving
him 81 RBIs for the year). Strawberry, the only Yankee starter
without a hit, changed that: He blasted a monstrous home run beyond
the left-center-field wall, his 18th of the year.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees led 13-1, but both teams observed a silent peace
thereafter, with hitters from both sides swinging early just to end
the game. Oquist's earned run average rose from 5.87 to 6.61.
</P>
<P>
   About two hours before the game, Don Zimmer, the Yankees' bench
coach, rested on the bench, watching the Athletics take batting
practice, under an unusually hot California sun, the temperature
nearing 90 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ball is jumping out of here today,'' Zimmer said,
grinning.
</P>
<P>
   He was right. Just ask Mike Oquist.

MONDESI SHOWS WHO'S BOSS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MATT McHALE  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ On a moonless night at Shea Stadium, Raul Mondesi
emerged from the shadows.
</P>
<P>
   For so long the Los Angeles Dodgers were Mike Piazza's team.
Even after Piazza left, the team struggled for an identity, not to
mention a winning streak. But Mondesi's two home runs in Monday's
8-5 comeback victory against Piazza's Mets were more evidence that
this is his team now.
</P>
<P>
   That means there will be warts, as on the day before when his
error in center field led to five runs. But when he followed
Piazza's fifth-inning home run with one in the sixth and a second
in the Dodgers' five-run seventh, Mondesi put his stamp on more
than the left-field parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   ``People tell me in the Dominican that this is mine now,''
Mondesi said. ``I like the sound of that. I want to be the one
people respect. I want to be the one the younger players ask for
advice. I'm not going to be good every night, but I want the other
team to think I'm the one.''
</P>
<P>
   Mondesi spoiled Hideo Nomo's first look at the Dodgers since the
bitter June 4 split. Nomo, who had won his previous three starts,
left the game after six innings and at one time had a four-run
lead. He allowed three hits and two runs, including Mondesi's
443-foot shot over the bleachers with one out in the sixth.
</P>
<P>
   Nomo turned the game over to Greg McMichael, who played briefly
with the Dodgers before returning to the Mets for Sunday's starter,
Brian Bohanon.
</P>
<P>
   The Dodgers scored five unearned runs against McMichael, but
that was deceiving. The key play in the inning was an error by
usually spectacular Mets shortstop Rey Ordonez, who threw wildly on
a force play at second. But there were some sharply hit balls that
led to the runs.
</P>
<P>
   New shortstop Mark Grudzielanek made it 5-3 with a sacrifice
fly, then Mondesi drove an 0-1 slider off the top of the wall in
center. The ball ricocheted off some speakers and dropped back on
the field for his 25th homer. Last season he hit 30 home runs.
</P>
<P>
   It was the seventh multihomer game of Mondesi's career and the
second this season. He hit two against Philadelphia on May 13.
</P>
<P>
   The home runs obscured the performance of starter Dave Mlicki,
who came to the Dodgers in the Nomo trade. He was hit hard in six
innings, including the home run by Piazza in the fifth that gave
the Mets a 5-1 lead.
</P>
<P>
   But Mlicki was lifted for a pinch hitter in the top of the
seventh when the Dodgers took the lead for good and raised his
record to 6-5.
</P>
<P>
   It took three relievers to finish off the Mets, including Jeff
Shaw, who earned his 10th save in 11 opportunities with the Dodgers
and 33rd overall. Shaw, who gave up a game-tying homer and
game-winning double Saturday, allowed two hits in the ninth.
</P>
<P>
   Piazza was the Mets' final batter, representing the tying run
with two outs in the ninth. He lined out to the warning track in
right and shook his fist as he walked off the field. Piazza entered
the final game of the series 1 for 11 but went 2 for 4 with three
RBI Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Afterward, he stood angrily by his locker, giving short answers
to long questions about playing his former team. When asked if he
sensed Mondesi had turned it up a notch since his May 15 trade to
Florida, Piazza said, ``No.''
</P>
<P>
   Others disagree.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mondy is the leader of this team, no question,'' Gary
Sheffield said. ``He may have more talent than any guy I've ever
played with. There are times when you have to remind him of how
good he can be, but there is no question that he has it all.''
</P>
<P>
   All season, there have been reminders. After signing a four-year
$36 million contract last winter that could balloon to $60 million
if the club picks up two option years, he said he wanted to play a
larger leadership role.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was Mike's team and I kind of held back,'' Mondesi said.
``Now I am very comfortable being a leader.''
</P>
<P>
   But he was arrested for drunk driving in June, with the charges
eventually dropped. On the field, he was on a tear after the
Al-Star break until missing two games with lower-back pain. He
returned Sunday and had one of the worst games of his career. He
battled the sun all day and buried the Dodgers when he misplayed
Edgardo Alfonzo's liner for an error in the third.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes you have a bad game sometimes you have a good
game,'' said Mondesi, whose 71 RBI are just 16 short of last year's
total. ``I made an error yesterday and five runs scored. Today, I
said to myself I will try to do the best I can.''

CLINTON AIDES TAKE DEFIANT STANCE ON LEWINSKY MATTER 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Eds: Grafs 9 and 10 are new, and graf 11 contains an additional
piece of information; some trims and refinements.)  (lb) 
 By JAMES BENNET and DON VAN NATTA Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Taking a defiant stance toward prosecutors and
political critics, White House officials said Monday that President
Clinton would continue to maintain that he had had no sexual
relationship with Monica Lewinsky and would pursue another Supreme
Court showdown, this time over an appeals court decision ordering a
top aide to testify in the case.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton is not scheduled to testify until Aug. 17, and his
advisers cautioned that only he and a small cadre of lawyers were
privy to his deliberations. But in what appeared to be a concerted
effort, several Clinton aides on Monday dismissed pleas from
Republican congressmen and some former officials that Clinton
acknowledge having had an affair with the former White House intern
to blunt and perhaps end the six-month investigation by Kenneth
Starr, the Whitewater independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president has told the truth about this, and he will
continue to do so,'' said Barry Toiv, a White House spokesman, in
response to questions. ``I have no reason to think that that has
changed in any way.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials expressed annoyance over what they called a
presumption that the president was lying when he denied in the
Paula Jones sexual misconduct suit that he had had a relationship
with Ms. Lewinsky. They said Clinton's agreement to testify,
despite White House suspicion of Starr's motives, proved that he
had nothing to fear.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is a little insulting to turn on the television and see
people come up with the brilliant idea that he should tell the
truth,'' one official said. ``Do you think anyone here is going in
and saying, `Sir, you should lie'?''
</P>
<P>
   Each weekday morning, the president's political advisers and
spokesmen, who are generally in the dark about his legal strategy,
meet with members of the White House Counsel's office for guidance
on how to respond to the day's developments in the investigation.
Aides who spoke about the president's position appeared to have
based their comments on such discussions.
</P>
<P>
   As the White House affirmed Clinton's denials, forensic
scientists at the Federal Bureau of Investigation crime laboratory
completed a first set of tests on a blue dress that Ms. Lewinsky
turned over to prosecutors. Prosecutors are trying to determine
whether the dress had been stained during a sexual encounter with
Clinton. The first test, performed under extremely tight security,
was intended to determine whether the stain had been caused by
semen, but the result was being very closely held.
</P>
<P>
   On a day of rapid-fire legal motions and court decisions, the
White House also served notice that it would ask the Supreme Court
to overturn a lower court's decision compelling Bruce Lindsey, a
White House lawyer who is the president's closest adviser, to
testify to the Lewinsky grand jury. After that decision, Lanny
Breuer, another member of the White House counsel's office, was
subpoenaed last week to testify on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer, who served in the Manhattan district attorney's office
and then in private practice here before joining the counsel's
office, has been central to the president's damage control effort
since the Lewinksy accusations surfaced in January. The decision to
subpoena him suggests that Starr is again training his sights on
the small group of White House lawyers with intimate knowledge of
how Clinton has planned his defense.
</P>
<P>
   Starr is investigating not only whether Clinton lied under oath
and sought to cover it up, but whether he tried to obstruct Starr's
investigation into both those questions. The appeals court's
decision could permit Starr to question the rest of the lawyers,
including the White House Counsel himself, Charles Ruff.
</P>
<P>
   The White House filed a motion Monday with the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia Circuit seeking to block testimony by
Breuer and other lawyers while it awaits action by the Supreme
Court. That motion was rejected, but the White House filed the same
request tonight with Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist. The chief
justice would have to act by 9:15 Tuesday morning to stop Breuer's
testimony.

</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, who has said he knows of no wrongdoing or criminal
conduct, cited lawyer-client privilege in declining to answer some
questions before a grand jury here.
</P>
<P>
   In its divided ruling last week, a three-judge panel of the
appeals court found that no such privilege could protect a
government lawyer from testifying in a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ruff said the appeals court decision would undercut any
president's ability to get honest advice.
</P>
<P>
   ``This privilege ultimately serves the public interest by
insuring fully informed decision making through open and candid
discussions between clients and attorneys,'' Ruff said in a
statement Monday. ``The confidential nature of the attorney-client
privilege relationship is no less important in government than in
every other context where it exists.''
</P>
<P>
   In another running legal contest between Starr and the White
House, the appeals court handed down a mixed ruling Monday,
deciding that an investigation may continue into whether Starr's
office had illegally disclosed grand jury material. The
investigation is being conducted by Judge Norma Holloway Johnson,
who presides over the grand jury hearing the Lewinsky case.
</P>
<P>
   But, overruling part of a decision by Judge Johnson, the appeals
court ruled that the president's lawyers might not on their own
depose Starr's prosecutors or demand documents from them, said a
lawyer familiar with the ruling, which was sealed. Instead, Judge
Johnson must review and approve any documents that are to be turned
over by Starr's office, to ensure that they do not reveal grand
jury secrets.
</P>
<P>
   David Kendall, the president's personal lawyer, has accused
Starr's office of illegally slipping information to reporters and
has sought sanctions against it. Starr has denied such leaks.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to the president said Monday that Clinton betrayed no sign
of nervousness about his prospective testimony. ``The most
comforting thing in the White House now is that the president seems
totally comfortable,'' said one Clinton aide who is not part of his
damage-control team.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton confined his public comments Monday to legislative
matters. In a speech to summer workers in Cheverly, Md., he warned
Republican leaders that he would not accept a ``bare-bones'' budget
from them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The House Republican plan puts politics ahead of people and
puts your future in the back seat,'' Clinton said. ``That is
wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   With veto threats hanging over seven appropriations bills, the
White House is on a collision course with Congress over the budget,
though that dispute has been obscured by the furor over Ms.
Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Starr also gave a speech Monday, appearing before a lawyers'
group in Toronto. He reviewed the Supreme Court's performance this
year, calling it ``quite impressive.''
</P>
<P>
   He said he had learned from a defeat he suffered this year
before the Supreme Court, which ruled that he could not have access
to notes taken by a lawyer for Vince Foster, the White House deputy
counsel who committed suicide in the president's first term. The
court ruled that a client's death did not weaken the
attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Starr said that ``the court reminded us that there are other
considerations, there are other values,'' besides the pursuit of
truth.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The law, embodying the wisdom of the ages, has seen fit to
protect relationships, even at the expense of truth,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Even some of the president's advisers have doubts about his
truthfulness regarding Ms. Lewinsky, and some think that by
changing his story he could bring an end to a drama that has
transfixed Washington and stunted progress on Capitol Hill. But
many Clinton allies also believe that an admission by Clinton would
be turned against him.
</P>
<P>
   One of Clinton's advisers said his team of political and legal
aides was nervously awaiting the test results on Ms. Lewinsky's
dress. If DNA testing links the dress to Clinton, this adviser
said, White House thinking on his testimony may change.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike laboratory findings in most prominent cases, which are
widely distributed in the upper echelons of the FBI and the Justice
Department, the Lewinsky laboratory tests are being provided to
only a handful of technicians and senior FBI officials. They in
turn reveal the findings directly to Starr.

   49ers Aren't Running Right Pattern for Rice  &LR; ,12p2  &LR; The night
Jerry Rice hurt his knee in the Monday night game last December 15
against Denver, I wrote that he shouldn't have been playing. It was
too soon to come back from the serious knee injury he had suffered
in the first game of the season. When he reinjured the knee against
Denver, he was lost for the rest of the season, including the
playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   Now I'm on the other side of the argument. The 49ers are babying
Rice, saying he will not play in any of the exhibition games this
year. That's the wrong approach. He's got to get out there.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers are unlikely to be staying up at night worrying about
what I think, but I believe both opinions make sense.
</P>
<P>
   That Rice should not have played in the Denver game was a
no-brainer. There was nothing about that hit that was out of the
ordinary. Rice caught a touchdown pass _ a key one, too _ and went
down. It was something that happens thousands of times on football
fields everywhere. He wasn't hit at a bad angle, or flipped in the
air.
</P>
<P>
   If Rice's knee would go out in such circumstances, he should not
have been out there. It was just that simple.
</P>
<P>
   So why not rest him through the rest of these silly, pointless
exhibition games?
</P>
<P>
   Well, why stop there? Maybe he could skip the first game of the
regular season against the rebuilding Jets, too. In fact, if he
didn't make the trip to Washington for the second game, and if you
throw in the bye the next week, Rice would not have to play for the
first three weeks of the season.
</P>
<P>
   Or, better yet, maybe he would not have to play at all, unless
the team needed him. Rice could stand in uniform on the sideline
all season, and if the 49ers were _ let's say _ down by a touchdown
in the fourth quarter, coach Steve Mariucci could put him in. If
not, hey, another game without any chance of an injury.
</P>
<P>
   C'mon, let's get serious. At some point Rice is going to have to
get out there see how that 35-year-old hinge is going to react.
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, it is going to be fine. No one, as we know, works
out more diligently than Rice, and rehabbing from this injury has
only increased his competitive zeal. One 49ers employee said Rice
was so focused before camp that the wide receiver barked at him for
saying hello while Rice was working out on the Stairmaster. Rice
wanted nothing to break his concentration.
</P>
<P>
   If there is a problem, it wouldn't be because Rice has not been
doing his workouts. But the first game of the regular season is not
the time to prove that.
</P>
<P>
   Do you really want the first pass Jerry Rice catches this season
to be on third-and-12 against a nickel defense, in a critical
moment of the first game of the year? Is that really the first time
you want him to make a hard cut on the repaired wheel to see if it
is going to hold?
</P>
<P>
   Nobody has to tell us that Rice is a tough cookie. In his first
13 years in the league, he had missed a single game because of
injury. There are two chances that he will be hearing footsteps out
on the field _ remote and nonexistent.
</P>
<P>
   But he has to have the chance to prove that, both to the team
and to himself. He left the field on December 15 as the greatest
receiver in the history of the game. Is he still that player?
Everyone needs to know.
</P>
<P>
   And then there is that old football saw about getting over the
first hit. This isn't just a fable. Too many players have said it,
in exactly the same words, to dismiss the idea as foolishness.
</P>
<P>
   ``I wanted to get that first hit on my knee,'' they've all said.
``And once I knew it was OK, I was fine.''
</P>
<P>
   For Rice, whose patella was fractured on a play that did not
look as if it was serious enough to crack an egg, the concern must
be even greater. As strong-minded as he is, don't tell me he isn't
going to wince when he gets that first whack on the knee. Don't
think he isn't going to take a moment right after it happens to
check to see if it is all right.
</P>
<P>
   Even if he is fine, that kind of concern is distracting. Get it
out of the way before every pass reception becomes important, when
this team needs Rice to make the monster plays, just as he always
has.
</P>
<P>
   By the way, his teammates might like to see that for themselves.
The roster, as is typical in the new age of the NFL, has undergone
huge turnover. Suppose _ knock on wood _ Steve Young should be
injured.
</P>
<P>
   Would you really want Ty Detmer to step into the game with the
knowledge that his only experience with Rice was tossing him a
towel in the locker room? The 49ers are putting together a unit,
and the veterans, who are going to lead this group through the
season and beyond, have to set the tone now.
</P>
<P>
   Rice should be in there with everyone else. If he can't play in
any of the five exhibition season games, the message is that he is
too fragile to trust in the regular season.
</P>
<P>
   Ask Rice. You know he wants to play in at least one game. That's
always his answer _ get me out there. I disagreed in December
because I thought it was foolhardy. Now I think Rice is right. Get
him out there.

COWBOYS ROOKIE ADAMS TRIES HIS HAND AT GUARD
</HEADLINE>
 NOTES-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN LYONS 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ With Everett McIver (neck wound) and Tony
Hutson (hamstring) out of the lineup, second-round draft choice
Flozell Adams will get a chance to impress Dallas Cowboys coaches
while working with the first team as a guard.
</P>
<P>
   Adams starred at Michigan State at tackle, but with Erik
Williams and All-Pro Larry Allen manning the tackle positions,
Adams figured to start his rookie season on the bench. He's still a
backup, but if he performs well the next few days at guard, Adams
could force the Cowboys to consider starting him in place of one of
the starting guards, McIver and Nate Newton.
</P>
<P>
   Adams got his first extensive look at guard in the night
practice Sunday. He worked the position again Monday.
</P>
<P>
   Said Cowboys coach Chan Gailey: ``He looked lost but he did some
good things physically. He really didn't even know he was going to
do it at all until right before practice \RSunday night\S. But if
we think he's the best and we think he can handle the load, then
we're going to have to put him in there.''
</P>
<P>
   Gailey said Adams' size (6-foot-7, 335 pounds) will not stop him
from being effective at the position.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our guards pull a lot more than most. And he's proven he could
do it. I didn't know he could do it that well until I saw him do
it.'' ANDERSON TO MISS TIME
</P>
<P>
   The team received good news on the health of reserve defensive
tackle Antonio Anderson. After Anderson injured a knee in the
Sunday night practice, a magnetic resonance imaging exam showed a
sprain. The club is expecting Anderson to miss two to three weeks.
</P>
<P>
   With Anderson out, Gailey said fourth-round pick Michael Myers
will get more time backing up starters Leon Lett and Chad Hennings.
Because Anderson played some end in the club's overshifted 3-4
defense, Gailey said there will be more pressure on starting ends
Kavika Pittman and Greg Ellis.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a good thing and a bad thing,'' Gailey said of the
pressure on Pittman and Ellis. ``We want to get a good look at
those guys, but we don't want to want to wear them out in training
camp.'' BROOKS MENDING
</P>
<P>
   Wide receiver Macey Brooks said Monday that there was a chance
that doctors would have to remove one of his testicles after he was
rushed to a hospital because of severe pain caused by testicular
torsion.
</P>
<P>
   Brooks said he does not remember anything that might have caused
the problem. He remembers being in a drive-through when he began
feeling severe pain in his groin.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was scary,'' Brooks said of the hourlong surgery. ``I
didn't know what was going on. When I was in the hospital, they
said the first six hours after I went in was the most important.
They could have removed a testicle. They didn't have to. I'm
thankful.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks was in discomfort as he talked Monday outside the
Cowboys' dining hall and added that the pain is worst when he is
standing and walking. He said doctors gave him a suggestion about
his sex life.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said I couldn't do that for about 10 days.''
</P>
<P>
   Brooks, who underwent surgery last week, is expected to miss
another three to four weeks of practice. GAILEY ON THE DEFENSE
</P>
<P>
   A day after criticizing himself for not paying attention to the
defense as much as he does offense, Gailey was asked to detail how
much he analyzes the defense during the week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I spend a lot of time talking about defensive personnel with
\Rdefensive coordinator\S Dave Campo,'' Gailey said. ``I don't
watch the practices every day as opposed to watching the offense,
and I don't watch tape as much, but I watch personnel.
</P>
<P>
   Then Gailey laughed and said, ``I feel like I have some input.''
HE SAID IT
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm standing close to Deion with all this lightning going
on.''
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owners Jerry Jones after lightning occurred in Wichita
Falls on Monday afternoon.

MARINERS DOWN RED SOX BEHIND MONAHAN, CLOUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For young Mariner players like Ken Cloude and Shane
Monahan, every pitch and at-bat becomes a proving ground.
</P>
<P>
   Both proved something Monday night at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude, who will get more starts now that Randy Johnson is gone,
pitched what manager Lou Piniella called his best game of the
season, and Monahan went into his first major league home run trot
as the Mariners defeated the Boston Red Sox, 3-1, before 27,887
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan, promoted by the M's on July 9 from Class AAA Tacoma,
where he hit four home runs in 69 games, needed just 20 big-league
games to get his first.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   The left fielder, who has more hockey in his blood than
baseball, lined a John Wasdin pitch through the metal railings
above the out-of-town scoreboard in right field with two outs and
Jay Buhner on first base in the seventh inning to snap a 1-1
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' said Monahan, whose grandfather is hockey Hall
of Famer Bernie ``Boom Boom'' Geofferin. ``I knew I hit it well and
thought it would be off the top of the wall, but it snuck through
the railings. I don't care if it went 30 rows deep or just over the
wall, it went out and we won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Monahan received the ball as a souvenir and will ship it home.
``The first one is for my dad (Hartland),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the series opener against the Red Sox, who have the
second-best record in the American League and lead the wild-card
race, the Mariners used Monahan's homer, Cloude's brilliant
pitching, Mike Timlin's seventh save, and superb defense from
center fielder Ken Griffey Jr., shortstop Alex Rodriguez and third
baseman Russ Davis to win their second straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play good defense,'' Piniella said, ``it helps the
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey made two excellent catches; the second one saved at
least one run. With a runner on first base and one out in the
second inning, Mike Stanley drove a Cloude fastball into
right-center. Griffey, shading Stanley toward left field, sped to
the warning track, reached up and backhanded the ball, banging into
the padded barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez made copycat plays in the hole, depriving John
Valentin of a single in the fifth inning and Nomar Garciaparra in
the sixth. Davis ended the sixth inning with a sliding catch near
the third-base seats.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive gems enabled Cloude to keep his pitch count down
and his velocity up. He needed some gusto in the top of the eighth
inning after walking Darren Lewis leading off, prompting a visit by
Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what Lou was going to say and I knew what I was going
to say,'' Cloude recalled. ``I wasn't coming out of this game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to make sure he wasn't tired and the little
blister that he's had wasn't bothering him,'' Piniella said. ``He
said he felt fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And he proved it.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin flied out, imposing Mo Vaughn struck out and
Garciaparra flied out. ``Those are three tough hitters,'' Piniella
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Cloude, ``It means a lot when the manager has enough
confidence in you to keep you in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight innings matched his career high.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rose to the occasion and started to throw the ball even
better,'' pitching coach Stan Williams said. ``I think the sign of
confidence really helped him. This is a stepping stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloude (6-7) moves up a notch in the rotation and will become
the fourth starter. As the No. 5 starter, he missed more starts
than the other Mariners in the rotation but now will work on an
every-fifth-day routine.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, he walked three and struck out three despite the
troublesome blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand that
has bothered him since May 23. The only run he allowed came in the
fourth inning, when Troy O'Leary homered to right field.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's career-best 20th homer started out several feet fair
and didn't change course until it bounced off a vacant seat in the
third deck, some five feet on the fair side of the foul screen.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners retaliated in the bottom of the inning to get
even when David Segui bounced a single to right field, Buhner hit a
ground-rule double to left-center and Davis flied out to deep
center.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had threatened in the first and second innings.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Cora extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a
first-inning single and moved to second on Griffey's one-out bloop
hit to left-center. The go-ahead opportunity collapsed when Edgar
Martinez grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Segui and Davis singled, but O'Leary made
a running catch in left-center to rob John Marzano of a run-scoring
hit, and Monahan flied out.

MELVIN SEIZES CHANCE TO WIN AL WEST TITLE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIM REEVES 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   If there's one thing Doug Melvin can do, it's prioritize.
</P>
<P>
   First things first is a phrase the Texas Rangers' general
manager lives by.
</P>
<P>
   Carpe diem _ seize the day _ is another.
</P>
<P>
   And that's why the Rangers find themselves back atop the
American League West today. Melvin decided he could not put off
until tomorrow what might never come 'round again.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I didn't get anything done, I could have been feeling lousy
today,'' Melvin said. ``I told my wife, I could have waked up
Saturday morning, a game behind and having not done anything. I'm
glad that's not how it worked out.''
</P>
<P>
   There's an AL West division flag just begging for someone to
take it home, and with it comes a ticket to the postseason dance.
Now, maybe the Rangers don't have a snow cone's chance in Texas of
getting past the Yankees, but I like that scenario better than the
alternative of not getting there at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to worry about winning the division first, then take
the next step,'' Melvin said. ``In a short series, anything can
happen.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the most intriguing facet of Melvin's wheeling and dealing
at the trade deadline Friday is that he not only addressed
immediate needs, he also put his team in position to be stronger in
the future, the loss of young third baseman Fernando Tatis
notwithstanding.
</P>
<P>
   ``The first thing we're trying to do is win a division,'' Melvin
said Monday as the Rangers took the day off, riding the euphoria
provided by the addition of three key players and a modest two-game
winning streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``We should win the division,'' Melvin said. ``With what we've
done, we're quite capable of winning it. You have to keep winning
before you can get to the ultimate goal. This deal allows us to win
and build on that.''
</P>
<P>
   In the meantime, the Rangers get a 50-plus game audition of two
possible key components for the future in pitcher Todd Stottlemyre
and shortstop Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now we get a chance to see Royce Clayton with our own eyes,
because I believe both he and Stottlemyre would have been knocking
on our door as free agents at the end of the season,'' Melvin said.
``We'll wait until the end of the year to discuss anything \Rwith
those players\S regarding the future.
</P>
<P>
   ``But this gives us a chance to see how our club looks with a
shortstop with athleticism and some energy and with Stottlemyre
plugged in at the top of our rotation.''
</P>
<P>
   The Rangers had soured on left-hander Darren Oliver's
inconsistency and placid approach, but as talks progressed and the
trading deadline neared, it became clear to Melvin that to land the
pitching help he felt the team had to have, Tatis would also have
to be included.
</P>
<P>
   Melvin had also concluded that adding a pitcher wouldn't be
enough.
</P>
<P>
   ``A pitcher is only going to start 12 games for us the rest of
the season,'' Melvin reasoned. ``Even if he goes 9-3, that doesn't
mean we're that much better a ballclub. We needed improvement in
those other 40 games when he wouldn't be pitching. Just adding a
pitcher didn't make sense.''
</P>
<P>
   What Melvin wanted was a shortstop to shore up the team's
sagging, up-the-middle defense, and if Tatis was included, that
meant he had to have a third baseman, too.
</P>
<P>
   Toronto was ready to pull the trigger on a Juan Guzman-Ed
Sprague deal for Oliver and Tatis, but that would not have brought
the shortstop Melvin felt he needed.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's what made the St. Louis deal more attractive,'' Melvin
said.
</P>
<P>
   In case that fell through and he had to make the Toronto deal,
Melvin was prepared to trade a reliever to San Francisco for
shortstop Rey Sanchez. In the meantime, he had also asked assistant
general manager Dan O'Brien to phone Florida general manager Dave
Dombrowski to check on third baseman Todd Zeile (two days earlier
Melvin had told Dombrowski he wasn't interested in Zeile).
</P>
<P>
   ``By trading Tatis I not only wouldn't have a third baseman this
year but I wouldn't have one for next year, either,'' Melvin said.
``Zeile made sense because he was signed for '99.
</P>
<P>
   ``Since he'd be joining a team in the pennant race, I thought he
might have some adrenaline and juices flowing, ready to go after
it. He just seemed like the right guy.''
</P>
<P>
   The hardest part of both deals was giving up Tatis and young
Port Charlotte pitcher Daniel DeYoung (to Florida).
</P>
<P>
   Tatis has the potential to be a solid major-league third baseman
for a long time, but Zeile gives the Rangers a steady veteran with
power in the middle of a pennant race, and because he's signed for
another year, he also buys time for young Rob Sasser to develop as
a long-term answer at third.
</P>
<P>
   Stottlemyre and Clayton could wind up signing free-agent
contracts to remain in Texas. If they elect to move, they'll both
be Type A free agents, meaning the Rangers will get two draft picks
for each. That gives Melvin the luxury of shopping the free-agent
market without worrying about losing draft picks if he signs
another shortstop or pitcher.
</P>
<P>
   But that's down the road. Melvin had the good sense to realize
that today, right now, this team has a shot at winning a
championship.
</P>
<P>
   Having waited 25 years for the first one, most of us realize how
treasured a moment this could be.

Brown Comfortable With Gruden Regime  c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
<TEXT>
<P>
   NAPA, Calif. &QL; 
 &LR;   &LR; The distinction smacks of perseverance and patience _ or maybe
craziness. Eddie Anderson and Terry McDaniel departed in the
offseason, leaving wide receiver Tim Brown as the player with the
longest tenure on the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   Now there's a badge of honor.
</P>
<P>
   Brown joined the Raiders in 1988. That means he is entering his
11th season with the team . . . and he's working for his fifth head
coach, Jon Gruden . . . and he's wondering what they call that
little tournament in January. The playoffs?
</P>
<P>
   Brown, 32, is the best player on a notoriously under-achieving
team. He nearly bolted in February, when he quietly exercised a
clause in his contract allowing him to become a free agent. Hours
later, he re-signed.
</P>
<P>
   At any rate, Brown sat down the other day to talk about Gruden,
the new offense and his expectations this season. One thing became
clear: Brown would have left if owner Al Davis had not made
changes.
</P>
<P>
   Brown refused to reveal his specific demands. But he implied
that he sought assurances Gruden would enjoy freedom not accorded
his predecessors.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not full bore at this point, but I think this guy (Gruden)
will be able to do what he wants to do,'' Brown said. ``He's a
young guy. I'm sure he feels he could get a job anywhere _ and I'm
sure he could.''
</P>
<P>
   Gruden brings with him an entirely new offense, a version of the
Bill Walsh system popularized by the 49ers in the 1980s. The
Raiders will send more receivers into the pattern than they did
last season _ usually five, not three.
</P>
<P>
   They also will lean on quick timing routes, a Brown specialty.
He compared Gruden's offense to the system the Raiders used in
1995, when Jim Fassel, now head coach of the New York Giants,
called the plays.
</P>
<P>
   The Raiders began the '95 season 8-2, then lost their last six
games.
</P>
<P>
   Brown does not expect his role in the offense to change
dramatically. He seldom ran deep routes, anyway; so he merely hopes
to extend the rapport he developed last season with quarterback
Jeff George.
</P>
<P>
   Brown caught a career-high 104 passes, matching Detroit's Herman
Moore for the NFL lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a year I could catch 70 balls and we can have a great
year _ or I could catch 130 balls and we can have a great year,''
Brown said. ``If other guys are playing well, they may not need to
come to me.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think they'll give me seven to 10 good looks a game, and
that's all I can ask.''
</P>
<P>
   The topic of Brown's personal numbers deserves scrutiny. Ask
some football people about him _ including at least one former
Raiders player _ and they say he typifies the team's me-first
attitude.
</P>
<P>
   Brown did not help his cause last Dec. 7, after a 30-0 loss to
Kansas City. He criticized the work of then-offensive coordinator
Ray Perkins, vowing to write plays on his wrist band and call them
himself.
</P>
<P>
   Not coincidentally, Brown caught only two passes against the
Chiefs.
</P>
<P>
   Then, in the season's final game, the Raiders repeatedly threw
to Brown, so he could reach 100 catches and break Fred
Biletnikoff's club record for career catches. Winning the game
seemed like an afterthought.
</P>
<P>
   Brown has heard the talk labeling him a selfish player.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know how anyone can say that,'' he said. ``It wasn't
like I wasn't getting the ball (when he criticized the
play-calling). My complaint was we weren't winning games.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have always said, `Tim is a selfish guy.' I don't
understand that, because if so I wouldn't have played here 10 years
_ and I've never been the center of the offense. I caught 104
passes last season. What did I have to complain about?''
</P>
<P>
   Brown insisted he was the second or third option on about 80 of
those passes. He senses the ratio might change this season, as
Gruden makes him the first option on more plays.
</P>
<P>
   It helps that Brown recognizes Gruden these days. The first time
they met, at the team's Alameda headquarters, Brown walked right
past his new boss in the hallway.
</P>
<P>
   ``He looked like he was 18,'' Brown said.
</P>
<P>
   Before long, Brown became a believer. He tells of Gruden
standing up in a meeting and rattling off plays he plans to call in
Kansas City in the season opener. Gruden was firm, bright,
confident.
</P>
<P>
   Those qualities convinced Brown he made the right decision. He
will stay and try to erase the memory of last year's 4-12 mess.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jon's just so smart, man,'' Brown said. ``It seems like he's
been in every possible situation, at least in his mind. Nothing
fazes this guy. He's ready for any situation the defense throws at
him.''

TEXAS TECH SANCTIONS COMING TUESDAY
</HEADLINE>
 TECH-TEX (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NCAA officials are scheduled to announce sanctions Tuesday
against the Texas Tech athletic department, which stands accused of
major rules violations such as using 76 academically ineligible
players in eight sports between 1991-97.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement, scheduled for 11 a.m., comes after a 20-month
investigation that led the NCAA committee on infractions to charge
Tech with 18 different rules violations. Among the charges were:
lax academic certification procedures that led to the widespread
use of ineligible players; special privileges given athletes by
local attorneys (including a former regent) and a local bail
bondsman; academic fraud and extra benefits provided by assistant
coaches in football and men's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Tech officials met April 25 with committee members in Cleveland,
and the list of allegations was trimmed from 18 to 17. Before that
meeting, Tech announced a self-imposed three-year probation that
included scholarship reductions in football, men's basketball,
women's basketball, baseball, men's golf and men's track and field.
</P>
<P>
   Tech also declared its 1997 football team, which finished 6-5,
ineligible to compete for the Big 12 championship or accept a bowl
bid. The 1996-97 men's basketball team, which finished 19-9, was
forced to forfeit 11 victories and to withdraw from consideration
for a berth to the 1997 NCAA basketball tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Tech chancellor John T. Montford said Monday he will be glad to
see the investigation end.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it's a bitter pill, we need to get it behind us,'' Montford
said. ``I think it's important to get this chapter closed. I don't
think any of this has been constructive for us other than to make
sure we have a program and personnel in place to make sure this
never happens again.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech has retooled its compliance staff, including the dismissal
of two employees and the reassignment of another, since launching
the internal audit that showed 76 athletes competed while
academically ineligible between 1991-97. The audit was announced in
October and represents one of the strongest charges against the
Tech athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   Montford said the audit showed ``a clear pattern of
unsatisfactory work, lack of attention to detail and a lack of
general understanding of NCAA satisfactory progress legislation''
by former school employees.

KING HOPES GOLD LEADS BACK TO PROS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   When USA Basketball dumped the NBA players selected to make up
Dream Team '98, Jimmy King suddenly had a chance to play out one of
his dreams. And that opportunity may enable King to re-live his
ultimate dream.
</P>
<P>
   King, who played at Plano (Texas) East High School, is one of
the 12 replacement players on the United States squad that advanced
to the quarterfinals of the World Basketball Championships on
Monday. And winning the world championship might be a way for King
to get back to the NBA, where he spent time with the Mavericks in
1996.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's something that I've been wanting to do since I was a kid
_ to be part of the Olympic Games or World Championship
competition,'' King said from his hotel room in Athens, Greece,
last week, talking about playing in the world championships.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a good chance to help my career now, to show my skills
on a world level. I'm going to get back in the NBA; it's just a
question of when.''
</P>
<P>
   So far, King's NBA experience has been nothing to boast about.
In 1995, he was a second-round pick (35th overall) of the Toronto
Raptors and averaged 4.5 points, 1.8 rebounds and 1.4 assists in 62
games.
</P>
<P>
   The Raptors traded King, a 6-foot-5 guard, to the Mavericks
during the summer of 1996, but he never made it out of rookie
training camp. King later signed with the Quad City Thunder of the
Continental Basketball Association, where he tossed in 18.8 points
per game during the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   Dick Motta, then the coach of the Denver Nuggets, signed King
for the final two weeks of the '96-97 season. But he played King in
only two games.
</P>
<P>
   Then it was back to Quad City, where King was named the league's
most valuable player this past season while averaging 16.4 points.
</P>
<P>
   It doesn't bother King that his World Championships opportunity
is a direct result of the NBA lockout. All he knows is a door has
flung open, and he wants to grab all the glory while he can.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you get to go out and represent your country and wear USA
across your chest, it's just a great honor,'' King said. ``We just
have to uphold the honor of being the best players in the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't feel like they're giving me chances. I feel like I've
earned it.''
</P>
<P>
   King's history is similar to that of his no-name teammates, but
that seems to be part of the success for this group that has won
three consecutive games and has the best record of any country in
the competition.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're a working-class team,'' said Jimmy Oliver, a former
Purdue standout who now plays in Spain. ``We're not high-class,
highly paid individuals. We need to go out and work for it. If we
do, this gold medal should be ours.''
</P>
<P>
   King will turn 25 on Sunday. By then, the United States could
have the gold medal. But he will reserve his biggest celebration
for a possible job back in the NBA.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is all going to be work here. We're not going to breeze
through any game,'' he said. ``That's how competitive this
tournament is.''

Mavericks CEO subject of sexual misconduct investigation 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By DARRIN SCHEID 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ Terdema Ussery, the president and chief executive
officer of the Dallas Mavericks, is the subject of an internal
investigation involving sexual misconduct, a team official
confirmed Monday.
</P>
<P>
   The Mavericks deferred questions about the investigation to
their attorney, Tom Luce, who would not talk specifically about the
accusations or the extent of the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Ussery is on vacation this week. Mavericks owner Ross Perot Jr.
is out of town and not available to comment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like most businesses, in the interest of fairness and privacy,
we do not comment on individual personnel matters,'' Luce said.
``Our company policy prohibits any unwelcome sexual advances, and
in the event of any allegations of conduct contrary to company
policy, the matter is thoroughly investigated and appropriate
action taken.''
</P>
<P>
   Luce said he and other members of the Mavericks front office
were in no position to answer questions about the investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``You could ask questions in 756 ingenious, creative ways, and I
would still refer you back to the statement,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ussery, 39, has been with the team since April 14, 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ussery has been heavily involved in community projects and was
instrumental in helping the Mavericks and the Dallas Stars secure
enough votes in January to win approval to build a downtown sports
arena.
</P>
<P>
   In 1991, Ussery became commissioner of the Continental
Basketball Association, becoming the first black commissioner in
the history of professional sports. He was a finalist in 1995 for
executive director of the U.S. Olympic Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Ussery, a native of the Watts section of Los Angeles, has an
undergraduate degree from Princeton, a master's degree from Harvard
and a law degree from University of California at Berkeley.

<P>
   It's hot, yet you want to get close to some serious NASCAR
racing without having to fight a massive traffic jam or make a
bathroom run with thousands of other sweating gear heads.
</P>
<P>
   The advice here: Stay home.
</P>
<P>
   Stay home and tune in to conversations between Winston Cup
Series teams and drivers via a multi-frequency scanner now
available on the Internet or on the telephone.
</P>
<P>
   NASCAR Online (www.nascar.com), NASCAR's official site, made
this happen last week when it reached a licensing agreement with
MotorTrax Interactive of Charlotte, N.C.

   MotorTrax has created a feature similar to the scanners
available at the speedway. For $12.95 per event, fans can
selectively tune to radio communications between 27 popular drivers
and teams by accessing NASCAR Online.
</P>
<P>
   During Winston Cup races, MotorTrax gathers and feeds radio
transmissions via satellite and packages them for NASCAR Online
users.
</P>
<P>
   Users will need a computer equipped with a standard sound card
and a 14.4-kilobytes-per-second modem. Real Audio 4.0 software will
be necessary to play the audio stream. Fans can also choose
transmissions from their phone key pad.
</P>
<P>
   Blake Davidson, NASCAR senior manager of marketing technology,
said MotorTrax's technology has allowed ``fans to feel as if they
are sitting in the grandstands listening ... on a scanner.''
</P>
<P>
   Todd Anderson, chief executive officer of MotorTrax's parent
company, Long Distance Technologies Inc., said in a news release he
recognizes NASCAR's success has been in getting fans close to the
drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``By enabling NASCAR fans anywhere in the world to go live into
the communication loop between the driver and his pit crew, we're
taking that concept to a much higher level,'' Anderson said.
</P>
<P>
   Like any multimedia feature on the 'Net, especially audio, the
technology isn't flawless.
</P>
<P>
   The transmission, which is scanner quality to begin with, can
sound a little ragged. Also, it is not live, so expect a 20- to
30-second delay. The number of simultaneous listeners is limited,
so it's first-come, first-serve for paying customers. BYTES Don't
forget: With two-a-day practices scheduled to start this week, John
``Buck'' Cargal of Fort Worth plans to keep fans updated with
reports on his JBC Pigskin Prep (www.pigskinprep.com). ... On
Wednesday, Dallas-based Beckett Auction Services (www.beckett.com)
is taking online bids for the 1909-11 Honus Wagner T206 tobacco
card. Opening bid is expected to be $50,000.

   Let's get official: Rangers catcher Ivan Rodriguez has an
official home on the 'Net at Athletic Direct on AOL (keyword:
athletedirect). Rodriguez is one of seven major-league players
affiliated with the site. His site includes a daily journal, images
and a chat area. Athlete Direct also has the official homes for
Cowboys quarterback Troy Aikman and Chicago Bulls forward Dennis
Rodman. ... Texas Tech's official athletic site should get
increased exposure thanks to a content agreement with the FANSonly
Network (www.fansonly.com) and CBS SportsLine. FANSonly, which
produces the Texas Tech site along with 39 college sites, will be
integrated into CBS SportsLine's college football and men's
basketball areas. The two-year agreement calls for SportsLine to
create areas on its college team pages for each school
participating in the FANSonly Network.

MARINERS DOWN RED SOX BEHIND MONAHAN, CLOUDE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JIM STREET  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SEATTLE _ For young Mariner players like Ken Cloude and Shane
Monahan, every pitch and at-bat becomes a proving ground.
</P>
<P>
   Both proved something Monday night at the Kingdome.
</P>
<P>
   Cloude, who will get more starts now that Randy Johnson is gone,
pitched what manager Lou Piniella called his best game of the
season, and Monahan went into his first major league home run trot
as the Mariners defeated the Boston Red Sox, 3-1, before 27,887
fans.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan, promoted by the M's on July 9 from Class AAA Tacoma,
where he hit four home runs in 69 games, needed just 20 big-league
games to get his first.
</P>
<P>
   It was a game-winner.
</P>
<P>
   The left fielder, who has more hockey in his blood than
baseball, lined a John Wasdin pitch through the metal railings
above the out-of-town scoreboard in right field with two outs and
Jay Buhner on first base in the seventh inning to snap a 1-1
deadlock.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unbelievable,'' said Monahan, whose grandfather is hockey Hall
of Famer Bernie ``Boom Boom'' Geofferin. ``I knew I hit it well and
thought it would be off the top of the wall, but it snuck through
the railings. I don't care if it went 30 rows deep or just over the
wall, it went out and we won the game.''
</P>
<P>
   Monahan received the ball as a souvenir and will ship it home.
``The first one is for my dad (Hartland),'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the series opener against the Red Sox, who have the
second-best record in the American League and lead the wild-card
race, the Mariners used Monahan's homer, Cloude's brilliant
pitching, Mike Timlin's seventh save, and superb defense from
center fielder Ken Griffey Jr., shortstop Alex Rodriguez and third
baseman Russ Davis to win their second straight.
</P>
<P>
   ``When you play good defense,'' Piniella said, ``it helps the
pitching.''
</P>
<P>
   Griffey made two excellent catches; the second one saved at
least one run. With a runner on first base and one out in the
second inning, Mike Stanley drove a Cloude fastball into
right-center. Griffey, shading Stanley toward left field, sped to
the warning track, reached up and backhanded the ball, banging into
the padded barrier.
</P>
<P>
   Rodriguez made copycat plays in the hole, depriving John
Valentin of a single in the fifth inning and Nomar Garciaparra in
the sixth. Davis ended the sixth inning with a sliding catch near
the third-base seats.
</P>
<P>
   The defensive gems enabled Cloude to keep his pitch count down
and his velocity up. He needed some gusto in the top of the eighth
inning after walking Darren Lewis leading off, prompting a visit by
Piniella.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew what Lou was going to say and I knew what I was going
to say,'' Cloude recalled. ``I wasn't coming out of this game.''
</P>
<P>
   It was a brief visit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I just wanted to make sure he wasn't tired and the little
blister that he's had wasn't bothering him,'' Piniella said. ``He
said he felt fine.''
</P>
<P>
   And he proved it.
</P>
<P>
   Valentin flied out, imposing Mo Vaughn struck out and
Garciaparra flied out. ``Those are three tough hitters,'' Piniella
said.
</P>
<P>
   Said Cloude, ``It means a lot when the manager has enough
confidence in you to keep you in the game.''
</P>
<P>
   The eight innings matched his career high.
</P>
<P>
   ``He rose to the occasion and started to throw the ball even
better,'' pitching coach Stan Williams said. ``I think the sign of
confidence really helped him. This is a stepping stone.''
</P>
<P>
   Cloude (6-7) moves up a notch in the rotation and will become
the fourth starter. As the No. 5 starter, he missed more starts
than the other Mariners in the rotation but now will work on an
every-fifth-day routine.
</P>
<P>
   Monday night, he walked three and struck out three despite the
troublesome blister on the middle finger of his pitching hand that
has bothered him since May 23. The only run he allowed came in the
fourth inning, when Troy O'Leary homered to right field.
</P>
<P>
   O'Leary's career-best 20th homer started out several feet fair
and didn't change course until it bounced off a vacant seat in the
third deck, some five feet on the fair side of the foul screen.
</P>
<P>
   But the Mariners retaliated in the bottom of the inning to get
even when David Segui bounced a single to right field, Buhner hit a
ground-rule double to left-center and Davis flied out to deep
center.
</P>
<P>
   The Mariners had threatened in the first and second innings.
</P>
<P>
   Joey Cora extended his hitting streak to 13 games with a
first-inning single and moved to second on Griffey's one-out bloop
hit to left-center. The go-ahead opportunity collapsed when Edgar
Martinez grounded into a double play.
</P>
<P>
   In the second inning, Segui and Davis singled, but O'Leary made
a running catch in left-center to rob John Marzano of a run-scoring
hit, and Monahan flied out.

``CRISTINA!: MY LIFE AS A BLONDE'' -- EXCERPTS FROM CRISTINA
SARALEGUI'S SIZZLING AUTOBIOGRAPHY
</HEADLINE>
  North American English-language print rights. 
 By CRISTINA SARALEGUI  
<TEXT>
<P>
   She is the host of the most-watched TV program in the
world--Cristina Saralegui, the Cuban refugee who worked her way to
the top of the publishing world, then switched to television to
create the ``El Show de Cristina,'' viewed daily by 100 million
worldwide.
</P>
<P>
   Bilingual, Cristina became well-known to English-speakers when
she began broadcasting her show for CBS in 1992.
</P>
<P>
   Her story, told in three 1200-word parts, will inspire anyone to
do more with what they have. Born into wealth and ease, Cristina
lost it all when her family fled to Miami during Castro's
revolution. She defeated racism and poverty with an undaunted will
to work and to believe in her own dreams.
</P>
<P>
   Her mission in this book is to show her readers how to do the
same.
</P>
<P>
   THE SERIES IS ALSO AVAILABLE IN SPANISH, slugged
BC-CRISTINA-SPANISH-BOOK-EXCERPT-NYTSF) &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In Part 1, Cristina tells of the family's flight to Miami and
how hardships in this country transformed her from a little rich
girl to a compassionate and supremely confidant businesswoman. She
lays down rules of disciplined goal-setting and shows her readers
how to follow them to success.
</P>
<P>
   In Part 2, Cristina recounts the romance of meeting Marcos Avila
of Miami Sound Machine, of how they overcame her family's
resistance to her marrying a rock star 11 years her junior, and
finally of how he led her to become more successful than even she
had dreamed.
</P>
<P>
   In Part 3, Cristina describes her new life in TV, the longs and
grueling pace, the seductions of fame and influence. She also
counters her critics who say the show is too sexy, and tells for
the first time why she chose not to renew her English-language deal
with CBS.

<P>
   It isn't easy to be rich.
</P>
<P>
   Everyone wants the people who make it to have started at the
bottom. I didn't start at the bottom, I must admit.
</P>
<P>
   My grandfather was a millionaire. In Cuba he was called the
Paper Czar because he was co-owner of the most important magazines
on the island and also held the monopoly for selling paper.
</P>
<P>
   I was born in Miramar, a wealthy suburb of Havana, where
everyone's main worry was to make sure that during hurricane season
his yacht was secured at the club. I lived in Miramar until we had
to emigrate to Miami in 196O, shortly after Fidel Castro's
revolution had overthrown the dictator Fulgencio Batista.
</P>
<P>
   In the United States, I faced something I had never known:
prejudice. In those early days there were not many Latinos in
Miami. And even though I was blond, with light eyes, my accent and
behavior were unmistakably foreign to the ``natives.''
</P>
<P>
   I didn't understand why I was called ``spic,'' until someone
explained that the word came from the way a Spanish speaker
pronounces the word ``speak,'' shortening the vowel to spic. But
then I couldn't understand why they said, ``Hey, spic, why don't
you go back where you came from?'' when none of the ancestors of
those ``natives'' were from the United States either.
</P>
<P>
   I enrolled in the University of Miami, where I studied
communications with a minor in creative writing. During the last
year of the course, the university required an internship with some
publication.
</P>
<P>
   I chose Vanidades because of my deep sentimental ties to that
magazine. My family had just sold it to a Venezuelan publisher and
his partner. I thought, All right, I'll work as an intern for a
year, and that's the last they'll see of me.
</P>
<P>
   I learned to write every kind of article, from pieces on beauty
and fashion to international news. Then when Frank Calderon, the
editor in chief of Buenhogar (the Spanish version of Good
Housekeeping) was appointed editor of Cosmopolitan en Espanol and
the first thing he did was to hire me from Vanidades as his first
staff writer.
</P>
<P>
   Like a good Cosmo girl, I was 26 and decided to move from our
home on Key Biscayne and rent a small apartment. My father was
going through one of his hard times and was trying to sell the
mansion on Key Biscayne to cut back on expenses. I moved, both to
be independent and not to be a burden on my parents.
</P>
<P>
   I must admit that I had a more difficult time than other girls
my age because I was totally spoiled and immature.
</P>
<P>
   My first excursion into cleaning consisted of buying two spray
cans of foaming cleanser: one for the bathroom, the other for the
oven. From time to time I mixed them up and cleaned the bathroom
with the oven cleaner and the oven with the one for the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   My mailbox was overflowing with bills. My money ran out because
I earned so little, and I began to lose my credit. My father was
now flat broke and couldn't help me either. I kept moving to
cheaper and cheaper apartments.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually I realized my life was a mess, and I knew I had to
calm down.
</P>
<P>
   One of the young men I was going out with was named Tony
Menendez. He was a firefighter and real estate salesman. I told
myself, ``I need to slow down and have a baby. This is a good man,
and I know he will be a good father.'' I was that cool in my
calculations.
</P>
<P>
   I married him and a year later, at 29, had my first daughter,
Cristina Amalia Menendez y Saralegui, whom we called Titi. When our
daughter was born, Tony and I moved into a small house on Key
Biscayne.
</P>
<P>
   As time went by, I realized that my husband, although he was
working every day (and getting dressed every day in jacket and
tie), simply wasn't selling anything. We had to move into my
father's three-room apartment, with my dachshund, which was covered
with fleas that immediately infested my mother's carpet.
</P>
<P>
   One day my husband said, ``You have to get a job and help out.''
</P>
<P>
   I looked him straight in the eye and said; ``I left my job to
start a family with you. If you ask me to go back to work, you'd
better be ready for whatever happens.''
</P>
<P>
   I wasn't capable of working in an office from 9 to 5 and
trudging home like an automaton to pick up my life. That was work,
not a career. And for me it had to be a career.
</P>
<P>
   I went to Cosmo and visited my former boss. ``I'm sorry,'' he
told me.
</P>
<P>
   On my way out of the building, in desperation I turned and went
to see Elvira Mendoza, whom I had left in the lurch at Vanidades to
go work for Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   ``Elvira, I have a baby girl now. Here's her picture,'' I began.
</P>
<P>
   She answered, ``What a beautiful child!''
</P>
<P>
   Then it all poured out. I told her the truth and confessed that
I needed a job.
</P>
<P>
   Her reply was instantaneous. ``Well, of course, I'll give you a
job.''
</P>
<P>
   So I came full circle back to where I'd begun, because she paid
me almost the same salary I'd started at, the lowest scale allowed.
</P>
<P>
   I worked at all hours. I did anything they told me. The owner
suggested that I take on the additional responsibility of being
editorial coordinator for Intimidades, a new small-format magazine
in Caracas, Venezuela, that focused primarily on information about
sexuality.
</P>
<P>
   I worked the whole day at Vanidades, writing and editing. Then,
at 5 o'clock, I would save my article on the computer, get into my
car, eat a sandwich as I drove, pick up my baby from the sitter,
put her in her car seat and take her to the home of my
mother-in-law, Marieta, a saint who worked at a factory that made
ballet and exercise clothing.
</P>
<P>
   I would run back to my office, sit back down at the computer,
and with that crazy schedule we got Intimidades under way.
</P>
<P>
   Then one day Frank Calderon, for reasons I don't know to this
day, banged his typewriter against his desk and walked out. The
management offered me his position as editor in chief of
Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   I was terrified. But I accepted for two reasons: hunger and
ambition. My daughter had turned me into a career woman. And
careers are like children: They grow! I had to dare to grow with
mine.
</P>
<P>
   That was MY CAUSE during the 10 years I directed Cosmopolitan.
Little by little I shaped the magazine to be a motivating force for
working women.
</P>
<P>
   Here are some of the things I've learned:
</P>
<P>
   _ List in a notebook the most important things in your life,
family, job, health, etc.
</P>
<P>
   _ On the basis of those principles, define the goals you want to
reach.
</P>
<P>
   _ Every goal must have a deadline, whether 20 years or two
months.
</P>
<P>
   My goals have been varied because I am convinced that happiness
leads to success but that we are happy only when we achieve a
balance in our lives.
</P>
<P>
   That's why I divide my goals into categories:
</P>
<P>
   _ Cultural goals: Take classes in a foreign language, read a
book every two weeks.
</P>
<P>
   _ Family goals: Have a lasting marriage and children who become
good men and women.
</P>
<P>
   _ Spiritual goals: Read everything that might open the eyes of
my spirit and help my soul evolve.
</P>
<P>
   Every morning review your goals for self-improvement and keep
the last day of the month to check, point by point, what you have
done to reach them.
</P>
<P>
   Begin right now.

<TEXT>
<P>
   One day a representative of CBS Records called to ask me a favor
with these fateful words:
</P>
<P>
   ``We just signed a local group called Miami Sound Machine. We're
going to book them into Regine's in New York and launch them as the
company's new artists and we need you to back us up in print.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time--one of life's little coincidences--another
friend, a newspaperman in Puerto Rico, had called to say that he
was organizing a festival of Caribbean music in Cancun, Mexico, and
he wanted me to recommend the hottest U.S. group playing Latin
music.
</P>
<P>
   I recommended Miami Sound Machine.
</P>
<P>
   On the plane carrying us to the festival in Cancun I met Emilio
and Gloria Estefan and (by chance!) Marcos Avila, the band's bass
player.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio and Gloria were very pleasant companions during that
trip, and we quickly became friends, so spontaneously and sincerely
that soon Tony and I began hanging out with them. Since we lived
only five minutes away, we went everywhere together.
</P>
<P>
   Seeing them, watching how happily they were married, I realized
how unhappy I was. I began to realize I had to change the
circumstances I found myself in.
</P>
<P>
   One day Emilio said, ``I'm going to Peru with Gloria and the
band. You've filed for divorce. Your problems are out of your
hands. Why don't you let me invite you to come with us?''
</P>
<P>
   It was my destiny to meet my destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio, who's always joking, began selling me on Marcos; I don't
know why. He said over and over, ``Marcos Avila is my right hand
and a very serious fellow. Why don't you two get together?''
</P>
<P>
   Now I believe that maybe Emilio sensed the chemistry between
Marcos and me before the things happened I'm going to tell you
about.
</P>
<P>
   But I listened and thought, ``Marcos is short, fat,
short-tempered, and close-mouthed. And he's married! I like tall,
handsome, elegant men. And I'm short-tempered too. We'd make a
terrible couple!''
</P>
<P>
   One night we all went to a discotheque. I was at Gloria and
Emilio's table but had gone to the ladies' room. There I saw a
black girl and a white girl get in a fight--with razor blades--over
a musician.
</P>
<P>
   The musician was Marcos! I froze. I did what you do on automatic
pilot and, eyes straight ahead, walked out the door.
</P>
<P>
   As I stepped outside, Marcos came up and said, ``Want to
dance?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not on your life!'' I answered, and went back to the table to
see how everything turned out.
</P>
<P>
   That night Marcos explained that he was going through the stage
of total upheaval that precedes a divorce. Sometimes he left home
and took refuge in his grandmother's house, where he hid out before
going back to his own house to see his baby girl.
</P>
<P>
   As for me, my husband and I were legally separated.
</P>
<P>
   We were two miserable souls that met like homeless people under
a bridge. Marcos says today that by then he had determined to
captivate me. It's true, we began to see each other differently.
</P>
<P>
   One night after a concert, we all got together in a suite and
had a tremendous party. Afterward Marcos offered to walk me back to
my room. He came in with me, sat on my bed, began to massage my
back, and said, ``If you and I make love ... ''
</P>
<P>
   He corrected himself. ``No. When you and I make love, you're
going to see what a real man is like.''
</P>
<P>
   I pretended I hadn't heard him. I quickly told him good night,
gave him a stupid kiss on the cheek, and he left. But I was left
with that promise in my heart. The next day I got up at 6 a.m. and
carefully painted my toenails red.
</P>
<P>
   That night he came back, and he was better than his promise. It
was like making love with someone for whom you had been created
with that one purpose in mind. The earth moved, bells rang and I
was left stupefied because that had never happened to me and I was
35 years old!
</P>
<P>
   It was well worth painting my toenails.
</P>
<P>
   From that moment Marcos began his campaign to move into my house
so I wouldn't go out with anyone else. He intended that after eight
years of marriage to one man I should pass directly to him, with no
romantic interlude in between.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos is 11 years younger than I am. At that time he had a
ponytail halfway down his back, but a buzz cut in front. And he had
an earring. After all, he was a musician.
</P>
<P>
   My parents were totally opposed to our relationship. My first
marriage had been plagued by economic problems. At one point my
father asked if I was proposing to support men all my life.
</P>
<P>
   To add to the complications, Titi, my daughter, was a holy
terror! I remember the first day Marcos came to the house. Titi had
some plastic handcuffs, and under the pretense of playing cops and
robbers, she cuffed him to the metal stairway and threw away the
key--so he couldn't be with me. We had to break the handcuffs to
get them off.
</P>
<P>
   Faced with that situation, I told Marcos, ``You'll have to win
Titi over, because I'm not going to marry you if she doesn't want
me to.''
</P>
<P>
   By the end of our first year together, Titi was so fond of
Marcos that she told me one day, ``Mami, he loves us. He's nice.
Why don't we marry him?''
</P>
<P>
   All I could do was laugh!
</P>
<P>
   For the wedding I wore a white cotton dress I'd bought in
Mexico, and Titi wore one just like it. I bought white flowers for
my hair and white flowers for hers. She stood by my side in her
identical white dress, and the two of us wed Marcos Avila.
</P>
<P>
   Later, despite his success and the money he was earning, and
after 12 unbroken years with Miami Sound Machine, he decided to
leave the group. ``I've had the fans, the limousines, the Johnny
Carson show,'' he said. ``Now I want a family.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcos opened a public relations agency to offer to
Spanish-language performers the things he had learned while
traveling with Miami Sound Machine.
</P>
<P>
   Once Marcos felt he was on solid ground, he began brainwashing
me to leave Cosmopolitan. My reaction was: Are you crazy?
</P>
<P>
   Marcos, though, convinced me that what I was doing in that
corporation was selling my time instead of my talent.
</P>
<P>
   Take note, all you reading this book, of that important
difference, whatever your situation at the moment.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Keeping my head above water in the world of television wasn't
easy. First of all I had to shed my old body, face, hair--my entire
appearance--along with everything I had grown used to during the
past 20 years of my life.
</P>
<P>
   I had been a writer and magazine editor; I worked at a desk like
a slave. When I took a break, I wolfed down anything I could find
in the vending machines.
</P>
<P>
   Today, when I look at the videos from the first year of ``El
Show de Cristina,'' I'm horrified. I see myself as ridiculous,
strident. I look like a prize pony at auction, draped in scarves,
chains, bracelets, three-tier earrings, everything dangling and
clanking against the microphone.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually we polished my image and paid attention to audience
reaction. I worked really hard to find my own personal style. Now I
keep my hair at shoulder length, and I like my makeup light and
wear simple clothes.
</P>
<P>
   I learned to eat low carbohydrates, low fat and low sugar, and
to eat small quantities of protein every three hours in order to
maintain a stable energy level to function better all day.
</P>
<P>
   The result was that for the first time, I looked great on
television, and again for the first time in my life, I understood
what it was to be an attractive woman, because when I arrived
somewhere, people turned to look at me even if they didn't know who
I was. That had never happened to me before, and I was 41 years
old!
</P>
<P>
   Another factor about my appearance was that I am fair-skinned,
blond and blue-eyed.
</P>
<P>
   When the show first aired, letters poured in from my Hispanic
brothers and sisters all across the United States, in which they
wrote that I was ``too white,'' too ``guera'' (the Mexican word for
blonde) to represent Hispanics.
</P>
<P>
   Those viewers had to understand that what they were doing to me
was as racist as what Anglos were doing to them. The acceptance
took six months of letters from the public telling me I should wear
more blush!
</P>
<P>
   Once an older woman came up to me and chided, ``Cristina, all
you talk about is sex.''
</P>
<P>
   My response: ``No, senora, I talk about everything! From flying
saucers to breast cancer. You only remember the programs about
sex.''
</P>
<P>
   I air themes on sex because apart from the enormous need for
information on that subject, every time I include a segment on a
sexual topic, the ratings go off the charts, and numbers outweigh
hypocrisy.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of calling a radio station to complain about a program
or writing incensed letters, why not just turn off the set when the
topic comes on? But no--ooo! Just the opposite. More and more sets
are turned on.
</P>
<P>
   It's obvious that many people don't have the least idea what
human sexuality is, and someone must offer them the truth. Their
parents certainly haven't assumed that responsibility, despite the
fact that the duty for the sexual and moral education of our
children rests squarely on us parents.
</P>
<P>
   In June 1992, with ``Cristina'' established as No. 1 in its
category in Spanish-language television, I took a shot at the
coveted crossover into English.
</P>
<P>
   It was simply titled the ``Cristina Show,'' and I was delighted
at the challenge, it goes without saying. But for CBS to hire a
communicator with a Latin accent was nothing short of
revolutionary.
</P>
<P>
   At first there were the usual comparisons, and reporters asked
if I was trying to knock off Oprah. ``Are you kidding?'' I'd ask
jokingly. ``Oprah is like a supersonic transport. I'm a fly
requesting permission to land.''
</P>
<P>
   The concept of the program was to feature topics that
demonstrated the pluralism of U.S. society, emphasizing the
immigrant roots shared by all of us, even the oldest North American
families, whose ancestors also emigrated from other countries.
</P>
<P>
   We chose themes that reflected that concept in all its
ramifications. For example, on one program we called ``White Like
Me,'' several plastic surgeons explained the operations people of
different races--Asian, African American or Hispanic--underwent to
alter their features to make them look ``white.''
</P>
<P>
   We discussed prejudice against black peoples. We presented black
Haitians, immigrants into the United States, who complained that
black Americans discriminated against them because of their
nationality and their accent.
</P>
<P>
   At the end of the 11 weeks, the average ratings augured a nearly
guaranteed success. Some years later, Jonathan Rodgers (president
of the group of CBS stations that gave me the chance to work in
English) explained to us that the program had obtained a higher
average rating than any other beginning program since that time.
</P>
<P>
   But when we began to negotiate, the CBS management offered us a
budget we didn't consider adequate. Just the opposite; the amount
was lower than the current budget of our program in Spanish, when
equivalent formats in English spend two or three times that sum and
more.
</P>
<P>
   So Marcos and I decided not to renew.
</P>
<P>
   What I never understood, though, and what I never will
understand, is how it was reported in the trade publications again
and again that our show had failed and that we were canceled
because of poor ratings.
</P>
<P>
   For anyone who may believe that, let me tell you: Ratings in the
United States are public property. If the reporters had verified
the facts, as was their responsibility, they would have realized
that what they were writing was not true.
</P>
<P>
   I had to pay for all that. I'm still paying, in the sense that
every time someone mentions our 1992 venture into the
English-language market, the invariable comment is that we
``failed'' and that we were ``canceled.'' That's still
inconceivable to me.
</P>
<P>
   No one ever told me that a woman looks young until suddenly,
when she approaches the decade between 45 and 55, she runs out of
estrogen and the years suddenly show. Her hands (and her vagina)
begin to dry up, and all you can think about is your little-girl
hands that are gone forever.
</P>
<P>
   Thank God, everything my mother didn't warn me about I found in
a book titled ``Silent Passage'' by Gail Sheehy, which become my
bible. Until I read it, I not only didn't recognize the stage I was
going through in my life but also didn't know what had to do to
survive it and to continue succeeding, without allowing that series
of hurdles to slow down my life.
</P>
<P>
   How do I feel as I approach 50? What am I like in this stage of
my Iife? Vigorous, curious, sensual, sexual, in good physical
condition, flexible and creative.
</P>
<P>
   I define myself as an adult woman who has struggled very hard to
be able to determine the destiny of her own life. I think that one
can achieve everything she sets out to, although not always all at
once. That is the secret.
</P>
<P>
   I completed a cycle of comfort, of working for 22 years for the
company that formed me professionally. I was I able to have my
children, to stay home, to marry twice, to cook for my parents....
</P>
<P>
   I did all these things! I completed those cycles.
</P>
<P>
   We're told we can't have everything in life. That's not true! We
can have it all (or enough), as long as we know how to choose. Life
is nothing more than an endless rosary of choices and lessons, one
after the other.

<P>
   Es dificil ser rico.
</P>
<P>
   Todo el mundo quiere que las personas que lleguen arriba hayan
empezado desde abajo. Yo no empece desde abajo, debo admitirlo.
</P>
<P>
   Mi abuelo era millonario. En Cuba le llamaban ``el zar del
papel'', porque era copropietario de las revistas Bohemia, Carteles
y Vanidades, que fueron las mas importantes de la isla, ademas de
tener el monopolio absoluto de la venta de todo el papel para
publicaciones en Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Naci en Miramar, un suburbio idilico y ricachon de
</P>
<P>
   La Habana. Alli creci hasta que nos vimos obligados a emigrar a
Miami (Estados Unidos), en 1960, poco despues de haber triunfado la
revolucion de Fidel Castro.
</P>
<P>
   Pero yo no provengo directamente de los tropicos ni de la islita
paradisiaca de las palmeras, del tabaco y del ron; mi familla es
solamente una segunda generacion de cubanos. En verdad somos vascos
por los cuatro costados, y aunque yo me aferro a mi cubania, no hay
duda que herede los genes y el caracter de mi casta.
</P>
<P>
   Ser vasco es, de por si, controvertido, complicado,
singular...Es una sociedad a la inversa, donde los hombres cocinan
platos gourmet en sociedades gastronomicas, las mujeres son tercas
y duras como las piedras, y donde todo el mundo--hasta las vacas y
las ovejas--sobrevive a base de obstinacion y pura tenacidad. Con
esa herencia vasca naci en el Caribe y vine a radicar en la
Florida.
</P>
<P>
   El impacto mas grande que experimente fue escuchar la palabra
``spic'' aplicada a los hispanos como termino peyorativo. No
entendia por que me llamaban spic, hasta que alguien me explico que
la pa- labra era derivada de la forma en que el hispano pronuncia
el verbo ``to speak,'' acortando el sonido de la vocal.
</P>
<P>
   Especificamente, no entendia por que me decian, ``Spic, por que
no regresas al pais de donde viniste?'', cuando ninguno de los
antepasados de aquellos ``nativos'' eran de aqui tampoco.
</P>
<P>
   Me matricule en la Universidad de Miami, estudiando
comunicaciones. Durante el ultimo ano de estudios, la universidad
requeria un internado en alguna publicacion: yo quise hacerlo en
Vanidades, porque mis lazos sentimentales eran muy pro- fundos con
la revista, naturalmente. Mi familia se la acababa de vender en
aquellos momentos a Miguel Angel Capriles y a su socio, Armando de
Armas, quienes habian sido sus distribudores en Venezuela durante
la epoca de mi abuelo, en Cuba.
</P>
<P>
   Aprendi a redactar todo tipo de articulos, desde temas de
belleza y modas, hasta noticias internacionales. Considero que mi
mayor logro durante esa etapa fue la adquisicion de un vocabulario
panamericano, que fue lo que mas me sirvio para conseguir el
trabajo que ahora desempeno en la television.
</P>
<P>
   (En 1973) Frank Calderon, quien era el director de Buenhogar,
obtuvo la posicion de director de Cosmopolitan en Espanol, y lo
primero que hizo fue llevarse a Mati Saralegui de Vanidades como su
primera redactora.
</P>
<P>
   Como buena Chica Cosmo, decidi mudarme de mi casa en Key
Biscayne a los veintiseis anos para instalarme en un pequeno
apartamento, con mi hermana menor, Maria Eugenia. El hecho de que
se le fueran dos de sus hijas de la casa--sin casarse, como
``aventureras''--le causo un gran trauma a mi padre.
</P>
<P>
   En aquellos momentos estaba arruinado, despues de una aventura
financiera en Arabia Saudita, y trataba de vender la mansion de Key
Biscayne para recortar el presupuesto. Pero antes de que eso
sucediera, para independizarme y no convertirme en una carga para
ellos, me mude.
</P>
<P>
   Empece a darme cuenta de que mi vida era muy vacia. Fue,
sencillaniente, que me tope con el vacio. Me di cuenta de que tenia
que controlar el aspecto personal de mi vida para dedicarle toda
esa energia que desbordaba a mi trabajo, y seguir adelante.
</P>
<P>
   Uno de los muchachos con quienes estaba saliendo se llamaba Tony
Menendez. ``Necesito tranquilizarme y tener un hijo. Este es un
buen hombre y se que sera un buen padre.'' Y, friamente, lo
calcule.
</P>
<P>
   Me case con el, y un ano despues tuve mi primera hija, Cristina
Amalia Menendez y Saralegui, a los veintintieve anos de edad.
</P>
<P>
   Estaba locamente enamorada de mi bebita, Titi, pero no de mi
esposo. Era un hombre bueno y yo lo queria, pero no estaba
enamorada de el. A medida que pasaba el tiempo, y mientras que
transcurria mi ano de domesticidad, me daba cuenta de que mi
marido, aunque trabaja todos los dias del ano (y que conste que
todos los dias encasquetaba su saco y su cuello y corbata y
trabajaba) sencillamente no vendia.
</P>
<P>
   Tuvinios que mudarnos para el apartamiento de tres cuartos de mi
padre. Un dia mi esposo me dijo, ``Tienes que trabajar y
ayudarme.'' Yo le mire a los ojos y le respondi: ``Yo deje mi
carrera para empezar una familia contigo. Si tu me pides que
regrese al trabajo, tienes que entender el lio en que te vas a
meter.''
</P>
<P>
   Me dirigi a Cosmopolitan y regrese a la oficin de mi ex jefe,
Frank Calderon. ``Lo siento'', me respodio.
</P>
<P>
   Saliendo del edificio, y tratando de pensar que iba a hacer en
mi desesperacion, di media vuelta y me dirigi hacia la oficina de
Elvira Mendoza, a quien habia dejado plantada en Vanidades para
irme a Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Fui sincera con ella y le confese que necesitaba trabajo. Su
respuesta fue inmediata: ``Si, como no, yo se lo doy''.
</P>
<P>
   Y asi regrese, circulo completo, al punto donde habia comenza-
do, porque me pagaba casi el mismo sueldo que ganaba al princi-
pio, el salario mas infimo que me podia asignar.
</P>
<P>
   Trabajaba a todas horas, en lo que me mandaran. Y hacia lo que
fuera necesarlo con tal de ganarme mi dinerito.
</P>
<P>
   Fue entonces que el dueno de la empresa me propuso, como trabajo
adicional, ser coordinadora editorial para una revista de formato:
Intimidades. Basicamente era una revista de educacion sexual, y
como en Vanidades ganaba tan poquito dinero, lo acepte.
</P>
<P>
   Pasaba el dia entero trabajando en Vanidades, redactando.
Entonces, a las cinco de la tarde, me montaba en mi carro, me comia
un sandwich por el camino, iba a recoger a mi bebita, la metia en
una canasta, y la llevaba a casa de mi suegra Marieta, una santa
que trabajaba en una fabrica de manufacturar ropa de baile.
</P>
<P>
   Yo corria nuevamente para mi oficina y abriamos Intimidades.
</P>
<P>
   Intimidades resulto un exito a nivel internacional, y la segui
dirigiendo. Hasta que un dia, Frank Calderon, por razones que aun
desconozco, que dio un tanganazo con su miquina de escribir contra
un buro, y se marcho repentinamente. La gerencia me ofrecio su
posicion como directora de Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Ahora permitanme hacer un aparte, como recapitulacion de toda
esta experiencia. Muchas veces las mujeres profesionales me piden
consejo sobre como coordinar el trabajo y los hijos. Pero tambien
me dicen: ``Ja! Para ti es facil, porque tu tienes sirvientas,
servicio en la casa, tu no tienes que cocinar.''
</P>
<P>
   Pero eso es ahora. Que poquito se acuerde nadie de los tiempos
dificiles. A nadie se le ocurre pensar que para llegar a la
posicion que hoy ocupo, he tenido que atravesar una serie de
etapas. Nadie se aparecio, en mi camino, con una varita magica para
decirme: ``Puff! De ahora en lo adelante tu seras Cristina, la de
la television''.
</P>
<P>
   El triunfo tiene muy poco que ver con la suerte.

<P>
   Como el mundo editorial en que me desenvolvia estaba tan rela-
cionado con las companias disqueras, en una ocasion me llamo un
representante de la CBS para pedirme un favor con estas palabras
profeticas:
</P>
<P>
   ``Acabamos de firmr a un conjunto local, que se llama el Miami
Sound Machine. Los vamos a llevar a la discoteca Regine's en Nueva
York para lanzarlos como nuevos artistas de la compania, y
necesitamos que tu nos apoyes editorialmente con ellos''.
</P>
<P>
   Al mismo tiempo--casualidades de la vida!--me habia llamado otro
amigo periodista de Puerto Rico, que estaba organizando un festival
de musica caribena en Cancun, Mexico, para pedirme que le
recomendara a un grupo que representara la musica latina que mas
estaba sonando en los Estados Unidos.
</P>
<P>
   Sin pensarlo dos veces, le recomende al Miami Sound Machine. Y
fue en el avion que nos llevo hacia el festival, donde por primera
vez conoci a Emilio y Gloria Estefan, y (casualmente!) a Marcos
Avila, el bajista de la banda.
</P>
<P>
   Durante ese viaje Emilio y Gloria fueron muy agradables, y
rapidamente entablamos amistad, tan espontanea y sincera que poco
despues Tony (mi esposo) y yo comenzamos a salir con ellos como
parejas.
</P>
<P>
   Viendolos a ellos, percibiendo la felicidad en su matrimonio, me
di cuenta de lo infeliz que yo era. Empece a darme cuenta que tenia
que cambiar las circunstancias en que me hallaba con el ejemplo de
ellos: trabajar juntos, echar para adelante.
</P>
<P>
   Un dia Emilio me dijo: ``Me voy a Peru con Gloria y con la
banda. Ya te estas divorciando. Ya tus problemas no tienen arreglo.
Por que no me dejas invitarte y te pasas diez dias alla, con
nosotros?''.
</P>
<P>
   Era mi destino encontrarme con mi destino.
</P>
<P>
   Emilio, que es muy bromista, empezo a venderme a Marcos, no se
ni por que. Me repetia: ``Marcos Avila es mi mano derecha. Es un
muchacho muy serio... por que no se empatan?''.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos hoy me cuenta que durante todas sus experiencias con
Emilio, este siempre ha tenido este tipo de vision, presentimientos
que han llegado a convertirse en realidad. Ahora pienso que tal vez
Emilio presintio la reaccion quimica entre Marcos y yo antes de que
transcurriera todo lo que voy a contarles.
</P>
<P>
   Pero en aquel momento yo escuchaba sus palabras, y pensaba:
``Marcos es bajito, es gordito, tiene malas pulgas, es callado. Y
es casado! A mi me encantan los hombres altos, los guapos, los
lindos. Tambien tengo malas pulgas. Seria una combi- nacion
espantosa!''.
</P>
<P>
   Una noche fuimos todos a una discoteca. Yo estaba en la mesa de
Gloria y Emilio, y fui al bano. De repente veo que una mujer negra
y una mujer blanca comienzan a fajarse, con una navaja, por un
musico.
</P>
<P>
   Y el musico era Marcos! Me paralice. Hice lo que tenia que hacer
en piloto automatico, sin siquiera echarle un vistazo a las
rivales. Sali despavorida de aquel bano. Y al salir, Marcos se me
acerco para decirme: ``Quieres bailar?''
</P>
<P>
   Le respondi: ``Ni loca!''. Y me regrese a la mesa para ver como
se desarrollaba el resto de aquella situacion.
</P>
<P>
   Esa noche Marcos me explico que estaba atravesando esa etapa
caotica de inestabilidad total que precede a un divorcio. A veces
dejaba su hogar para refugiarse en casa de su abuela, donde se
escondia por un par de semanas antes de regresar a su propia casa y
visitar a su bebita.
</P>
<P>
   Por mi parte, mi ex marido y yo estabamos separados, con pape-
les y todo.
</P>
<P>
   Con Marcos fue todo como el caso clasico de ``un clavo saca a
otro clavo''. Nos apoyamos el uno al otro, o la gordura se apoyo en
la hinchazon. Fuimos dos almas desgraciadas que se encontraron,
como dos desamparados bajo el puente.
</P>
<P>
   Despues de uno de los conciertos nos reunimos todos en una suite
y formamos tremenda fiesta. Al terminar la diversion, el se ofrecio
a acompanarme de regreso a mi habitacion. Entro conmi- go, se sento
en mi cama, me empezo a dar masajes en la espalda, y me dijo: ``Si
tu y yo hacemos el amor...''.
</P>
<P>
   De repente se corrigio:''No. Cuando tu y yo hagamos el amor, tu
vas a ver lo que es un hombre de verdad''.
</P>
<P>
   Yo me hice la que no lo habia oido; le dije good-bye bien
rapidito, le di un besito tonto, y se fue. Pero me quede pensando,
y con aquella promesa por dentro. Al dia siguiente me levante a las
seis de la manana, y me arregle hasta las unas de los pies!
</P>
<P>
   Esa noche volvio, y todas sus promesas se quedaron cortas.
</P>
<P>
   Despues de aquella experiencia, nunca mas nos separamos. Fue
como hacer el amor con alguien para quien te habian predisenado con
ese unico proposito y fin. Despues de tantos anos de infelicidad
conyugal, encontrarme con alguien hecho a la medida de mi cuerpo y
alma fue como un bofeton de proporciones karmicas.
</P>
<P>
   Marcos tiene once anos menos que yo. En aquel momento tenia una
cola de caballo como Miguel Bose, hasta la mitad de la espal- da;
en el frente, estaba rapado. Ademas, llevaba una argolla en una
oreja. En fin, el era un musico.
</P>
<P>
   Mis padres estaban completamente opuestos a la relacion. Aparte
de que Titi, mi nina, era tremenda! Recuerdo que el primer dia que
Marcos llego a casa, Titi tenia unas esposas de policia plasticas
de juguete, y lo amarro a la escalera de metal de la casa, lo dejo
ahi, y boto la llave... para que el no pudiera estar conmigo.
Tuvimos que romper las esposas.
</P>
<P>
   Ante aquella situacion, le adverti a el: ``Tienes que primera
mente conquistarla a ella, porque yo no me voy a casar si ella no
quiere que me case.
</P>
<P>
   Al cabo de nuestro primer ano juntos, la nina habia llegado a
tenerle tanto carino a Marcos que un dia me dijo: ``Mami, el nos
quiere. El es bueno. Por que no nos casamos con el?''.
</P>
<P>
   No pude menos que reirme!
</P>
<P>
   Para la boda me puse un vestido blanco de algodon que habia
comprado en Mexico, y Titi llevaba uno exacto; compre unas
florecitas blancas para el pelo, y otras a ella. Entonces ella se
paro a mi lado, con su vestidito exacto al mio, y las dos nos
casamos con Marcos Avila.
</P>
<P>
   Mas tarde, a pesar de su exito y del dinero que estaba ganando,
y despues de doce anos consecutivos con el Miami Sound machine,
decidio irse del grupo. ``Ya tuve las fans, y las limosinas y ``The
Johnny Carson Show,'' fueron sus palabars exactas. ``Ahora quiero
tener una familia.''
</P>
<P>
   Marcos abrio una compania de relaciones publicas: MagikCity
Media, la cual aun mantiene. Y una vez que el comprobo que a el le
estaba yendo bien, empezo a lavarme el cerebro para que yo me fuera
de Cosmopolitan.
</P>
<P>
   Mi reaction: ``Tu estas loco?''
</P>
<P>
   No obstante, Marcos me convencio de que lo que yo estaba
haciendo en aquella empresa era vender mi tiempo en vez de mi
talento.
</P>
<P>
   Y recuerden bien todos los que esten leyendo este libro ese
consejo tan importante, a cualquier nivel de vida en que se
encuentren en estos momentos.

<P>
   Para nadar en el mundo de la television, nada fue facil.
Empezando porque tuve que despojarme, como una serpiente, del
cuerpo, la cara, el pelo y mi apariencia completa... y de todo a lo
que estaba acostumbrada durante los ultimos 20 anos de mi vida.
</P>
<P>
   Habia sido escritora y directora de revistas, trabajaba en un
buro como una esclava, y cuando me tomaba un receso, me daba por
devorar todo lo que habia en las maquinas de alimentos, lo cual me
hacia engordar.
</P>
<P>
   Cuando hoy miro los videos del primer ano del ``Show de
Cristina,'' me horrorizo. Me veo fea, ridicula, gritona y como un
caballito en rifa, llena de gangarrias, cadenas, pulseras, aretes
de tres pisos, con todo colgando y haciendo ruido con el microfono.
</P>
<P>
   El cambio fue paulatino. Poco a poco fuimos puliendo mi imagen,
y prestando atencion a la reaccion del publico. Me costo mucho
trabajo encontrar mi estilo. Ahora conservo el cabello liso,
cortado en una sola capa, y me gusta el maquillaje tenue y la ropa
sencilla.
</P>
<P>
   Aprendi a comer sin grasa y sin azucar, y pequenas cantidades de
proteina cada tres horas, para mantener mi energia estable y poder
funcionar mejor durante todo el dia. El resultado fue que por
primera vez me veia regia en la television, y por primera vez en mi
vida entendi lo que era ser una mujer atrac- tiva porque cuando
llegaba a cualquier lugar, la gente se volteaba a mirarme aunque no
supieran quien era. Eso jamas me habia pasado... y tenia 41 anos!
</P>
<P>
   Otro factor en mi apariencia era ser tan blanca, tan rubia y con
los ojos claros. Cuando el show fue lanzado al aire, llovian las
cartas de mis hermanos hispanos en todos los Estados Unidos, en las
cuales mencionaban que yo era ``demaslado blanca'' y ``guera''
(rubia para los mexicanos) para representar a las hispanas, cuando
brown era beautiful ...y yo no era brown.
</P>
<P>
   Hasta que comprendieron que lo que me estaban haciendo a mi era
tan racista como lo que les estaban haciendo los anglos a ellos...
y las criticas cesaron. Pero el proceso torno seis meses de cartas
del publico en las que me decian que me pusiera mis ruborizador.
</P>
<P>
   Una vez se me acerco una senora de edad avanzada y me reprocho:
``Ay, usted nada mas que habla de sexo, Cristina''.
</P>
<P>
   Le respondi: ``No senora, yo hablo de todo! Desde platillos
voladores hasta el cancer del seno. Usted solamente recuerda los
programas de sexo.''
</P>
<P>
   Presento temas de sexo porque aparte de la enorme necesidad que
hay de informar sobre la materia, cada vez que incluyo algo de
sexo, en el programa los ratings se van por las nubes, y los
numeros desplazan la hipocresia.
</P>
<P>
   Por que en vez de criticar un programa llamado a una emisora de
radio o escribiendo cartas airadas no apagan los televisores cuando
hay algo de sexo? Pero...Noo! Al reves. Se prenden mas y mas
televisores.
</P>
<P>
   Es evidente que muchas personas no tienen la menor idea de lo
que es la sexualidad humana, y alguien les tiene que explicar la
verdad. Obviamiente sus padres no han asumido la responsabilidad de
hacerlo, porque la responsabilidad de educar sexualmente a nuestros
hijos, igual que moralmente, es de nosotros los padres.
</P>
<P>
   Mi primer viaje con ``El Show de Cristina'' a Mexico fue muy
importante en el desarrollo del programa. Tuvimos una fastuosa
conferencia de prensa, seguida de un almuerzo, durante el cual me
presentaron a la prensa mexicana para que les explicara el concepto
del programa. Fue una experiencia agradable y alentadora.
</P>
<P>
   La debacle que se avecinaba se comenzo a fraguar cuando
``Cristina'' comenzo a trasmitirse en el horario de las cuatro de
la tarde (igual que en los Estados Unidos) y reemplazando la pro-
gramacion infantil que existia previamente a esa hora.
</P>
<P>
   Es decir, que en un pais tan tradicional como Mexico, eligieron
para un programa polemico y controversial como el mio, un horario
en que quienes veian la television eran principalmente los ninos.
</P>
<P>
   A partir de ese momento comenzaron las quejas de algunas
asociaciones de padres de familia, y del publico en general, contra
el programa y, especialmente, contra el horario del programa.
</P>
<P>
   Un poco despues cambiron el programa al horario de las once de
la noche, y yo, inocentemente ajena a esta caceria de brujas que se
estaba produciendo, viaje a Mexico con mi equipo para grabar por
primera vez.
</P>
<P>
   Al llegar al estudio, todo fue de maravilla. El foro tenia
capacidad para 500 espectaclores y estaba siempre abarrotado de
personas que esperaban el dia entero para poder entrar.
</P>
<P>
   Pero una vez que todas estas asociaciones, que mientras tanto me
estaban atacando, se enteraron que yo estaba grabando en la Ciudad
de Mexico, enviaron un sequito de periodistas para entre- vistarme.
Excepto que no me hacian las preguntas normales, como los
periodistas en otras partes. Aquello era un ataque frontal, verbal
y luego escrito. Yo me preguntaba: Dios mio, pero por que este
rencor? No entendia lo que estaba sucediendo!
</P>
<P>
   ``Bodas Homosexuales,'' el programa el mas controversial hasta
la fecha, me hizo cuestionar hasta que punto se puede correr el
riesgo de poner en peligro la estabilidad de la familla, y de seres
quendos a un nivel personal, por cuestiones de principlos.
</P>
<P>
   El programa fue lanzado al aire el 4 de enero de 1996, y aunque
fue conducido con decoro y respeto, se suscito una campana de odio
muy intensa en Miami que desato una desagradable corriente de
intolerancia.
</P>
<P>
   Todo esto culmino en una manifestacion frente a los estudios de
Univision en Miami, donde aproximadamente 1,500 personas acudieron
con pancartas que decian: ``ABAJO CRISTINA!'', ``N0 A `EL SHOW DE
CRISTNA,' SI A CRISTO!''.
</P>
<P>
   Mi papa va a misa todos los dias. A raiz de este incidente,
estaba en la iglesia, y como hacia frio, llevaba puesto una
chaqueta del programal que dice ``Cristina'' en la parte de atras.
</P>
<P>
   El sacerdote estaba diciendo tantos horrores de nosotros en el
pulpito que mi papa, para no causar otro incidente, se quito la
chaqueta y la doblo, para que no se viera el nombre de su hija.
</P>
<P>
   Mi hijo que entonces tenia 10 anos aparentemente se entero de
los ataques en su colegio parroquial, ya que un dia llego a la casa
y me pregunto muy consternado: ``Mami, estamos teniendo
problemas?''.
</P>
<P>
   Estos incidentes desafortunados me hicieron suffir las criticas
en carne propia.
</P>
<P>
   Surgio la consabida pregunta: no me parecia mal que los ninos
vieran una boda de homosexuales en la television, a las cuatro de
la tarde? Si me hubiera parecido mal, no lo habria presentado.
</P>
<P>
   Me parecen aun mas alarmantes las cifras de ninas prostitutas,
de abuso sexual infantil, de drogadiccion y alcoholismo entre los
adolescentes.
</P>
<P>
   Pero aunque me alarme y me aterre--dada la profesion que escogi,
y la suerte que Dios me ha dado de tener un programa como
este--tengo el deber y el compromiso de informar, y el compromiso
de reflejar la realidad que existe en el mundo en que vivimos.
</P>
<P>
   Mis padres emigraron de Cuba para que yo creciera en una
sociedad donde no hubiera censura. Y si los ataques personales eran
el precio que yo tenia que pagar--no solo el precio personal, sino
el de mi familla--estaba mas que nunca dispuesta a pagarlo por el
resto de mi vida.
</P>
<P>
   Gracias a Dios, ellos piensan igual que yo, especialmente mis
tres hijos.

ONE MAN'S HATE SPEECH, ANOTHER'S POLITICAL SPEECH

   Sex and lurking sexual predators aren't the only worries people
have about the Internet. Web sites that blaze with hate and bigotry
have also come under fire recently. And unfortunately, there are
those who would hack a hunk out of the First Amendment in order to
ban such sites.
</P>
<P>
   Hate speech on the Internet has grown rapidly _ through Web
sites, e-mail, bulletin boards and chat rooms _ according to a
study published by the Anti-Defamation League last year. The ADL
monitors the Internet looking for anti-semitic speech propagated by
neo-Nazi, white supremacist groups. In the study, ``High-Tech Hate:
Extremist Use of the Internet,'' the ADL notes that hate Web sites
more than doubled in one year, from 1996 to 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Hate speech can be loosely defined as speech that reviles or
ridicules a person or group of people based upon their race, creed,
sexual orientation, religion, handicap, economic condition or
national origin.
</P>
<P>
   A number of universities, more sensitive to people's feelings
than the significance of the First Amendment, have written speech
regulations to punish students who post hate messages on the World
Wide Web. Some universities have put blocking technology on their
computers that have Internet access _ to filter out Web sites that
advocate racism, anti-semitism, white supremacy, homophobia,
Holocaust denial, sexual superiority, anti-government vigilante
justice, and other forms of prejudice and bigotry.
</P>
<P>
   There are those who push for a rating system for every Web page,
with stiff fines for those who didn't rate their sites or rated
them wrongly.
</P>
<P>
   Presumably an Aryan Nations or Ku Klux Klan site would have to
rate itself (or be rated by others) so that children could not gain
access when the appropriate filtering program is installed to read
the ratings and block some categories.
</P>
<P>
   The Southern Poverty Law Center in Montgomery, Ala., labelled
the Nation of Islam as a hate group in a recent report.
</P>
<P>
   The company that makes the software filter called Cyber Patrol
made a decision months ago to block out the American Family
Association's Web site because it contains prejudicial statements
against homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The right-wing American Family Association, ironically, has
pushed parents, schools and libraries to use Internet filters like
Cyber Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   A number of academics argue that hate speech should not be
protected by the First Amendment. Fortunately, their arguments have
not been persuasive against our long and honored tradition of free
speech.
</P>
<P>
   While we may despise the comments made on some of these
hate-filled Web sites, it is difficult to argue they are not
espousing a political position. Often one man's hate speech is
another man's political statement. And political commentary has _
and should have _ the highest First Amendment protection.
</P>
<P>
   As the U.S. Supreme Court noted in finding the Communications
Decency Act unconstitutional last year, anyone with access to the
Internet can be a pamphleteer sending e-mail messages to thousands
of recipients with one click of a button, or posting Web sites that
are eventually seen by hundreds of thousands. It is the most
democratic communication media yet devised.
</P>
<P>
   The leading edge of any social or political movement cuts a path
to recognition by using radical, sometimes outrageous rhetoric. The
rhetoric is there to define or redefine the landscape in terms that
suit that particular movement. It is there to shake up the
prevailing state of affairs. This has been true in this nation from
the time of our own revolution to gain independence from Great
Britain to the present.
</P>
<P>
   Certainly, the British Crown could have considered the
Declaration of Independence a form of hate speech.
</P>
<P>
   The Industrial Workers of the World, the labor movement, the
socialist movement, anti-war movements, the Black Power movement,
poverty marches, veteran's marches, the temperance crusade, women's
liberation movement, the anti-abortion movement _ all used
inflammatory rhetoric like a blowtorch to burn a hole in the status
quo. To demand that people take sides. And see the world
differently.
</P>
<P>
   If hate speech were prohibited, socio-political movements could
be crushed before they even started.
</P>
<P>
   The current cliche about ``civility'' in debate may be fine when
we all agree to basic premises and we're all well fed and treated
equally. We can afford to be polite to one another and chummy. But
civility does not serve the downtrodden, the forgotten, the
invisible, the persecuted, the hungry and homeless. Civility in
pursuit of justice plays to the power structure's selective
deafness. To be effective, the voice must be raised, the tone
sharpened, the language at a pitch that slices the air.
</P>
<P>
   Americans know this at heart _ we were born in a revolution.
</P>
<P>
   Hate speech is not the cause of bigotry, but arises out of it
and a sense of political and social powerlessness. Allowing those
who feel powerless to speak _ no matter how vehement the language _
salves the speaker. Venting frustration, anger and hurt is an
important use of language. It may actually short circuit an
inclination for physical violence.
</P>
<P>
   The black playwright Imamu Amiri Baraka (LeRoi Jones) had one of
his characters in ``Dutchman,'' his 1960s play about a black
rebellion, say that for every poem he wrote, there was one less
white man he killed.
</P>
<P>
   Suppressing speech, even hateful speech and perhaps especially
hateful speech, would inevitably lead to violence.
</P>
<P>
   We don't protect the civil rights of those who are targets of
hateful speech by suppressing the speech of hate mongers. For
eventually, inexorably, such suppression turns and bites those it
is supposed to protect.
</P>
<P>
   Speech laws that have been adopted to protect racial minorities
are actually used to persecute the very people they were created to
protect.
</P>
<P>
   This has been true in Great Britain and in Canada _ just as it
has been true at universities in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   When the University of Michigan put its speech code against
racist speech into effect and before the code was struck down in
1989 as unconstitutional, 20 students were charged with violations.
Ironically only one was punished, a black student for using the
term ``white trash.''
</P>
<P>
   The power structure interprets and enforces the law. Where white
males dominate, white males are less likely to be prosecuted under
such laws _ cynical but true.
</P>
<P>
   Suppressing hate speech is more dangerous than allowing it to
exist.
</P>
<P>
   Like it or not, hate speech has a role to play in a nation
dedicated to vigorous debate about public issues.

 &HT;    Are we not 'Rugrats'? Why yes we are!
 &HT;    By Charles Passy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ ``Are we not men?'' Mark Mothersbaugh
asked as the leader of Devo, the legendary '70s new wave rock
group.
</P>
<P>
   Today, Mothersbaugh has a different question: ``Are we not
rugrats?''
</P>
<P>
   Mothersbaugh, the creator of that bizarre rock classic ``Whip
It,'' is now the musical force behind the Nickelodeon animated kids
program ``Rugrats.'' And as the show evolves from TV phenomenon to
Broadway-style touring spectacular (coming to the Miami Arena on
Thursday) to a feature film (due in the fall), the 48-year-old
composer is riding each wave of success.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a natural progression of our cycle of de-evolution,''
he says drolly of his second (and decidedly more commercial) career
as kiddie writer.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, the gap between Devo and ``Rugrats'' may not be as large
as it seems. Even as it lampooned pop culture, the band embraced it
_ and nothing could be more popular than the Nickelodeon series.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were influenced not so much by pop music, but by everything
that was going on in the world around us: elevator music, TV
commercial music,'' Mothersbaugh explains. ``I quoted Burger King
(jingle) lyrics on our first album.''
</P>
<P>
   Now, Mothersbaugh is steeped in fashioning the ``Rugrats''
soundtrack. The show revolves around the hi-jinks of a host of
toddlers _ Chuckie, Tommy and the slightly older Angelica, who
confront such burning issues as toilet-training and who's their
favorite TV character.
</P>
<P>
   Mothersbaugh admits he was skeptical when he was first
approached by the series' creators, Gabor Csupo and Arlene Klasky.
He was hoping for something with ``Ren and Stimpy''-like subversive
undertones; they were pitching a far more family-friendly show. But
the idea that Rugrats presented a self-contained children's world _
kids talk to each other, even if their parents hear it as gibberish
_ gave him an interesting musical starting point.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was looking for something that would create their audio
universe,'' he says of his music, which sounds something like
nursery tunes played backwards.
</P>
<P>
   For the stage show, Mothersbaugh was free to think bigger _ and
add actual songs. ``There's a song that sounds like a James
Brown-style song. There's one that's like a gospel song. There's a
reggae song,'' he says. And don't forget Angelica's main number:
``If I Were Princess of the World,'' a fitting anthem for the
series' most self-absorbed character.
</P>
<P>
   As for the ``Rugrats'' film, Mothersbaugh promises more of the
same, including a song he's recorded with Beck, Jakob Dylan, Lou
Rawls and Iggy Pop, among others. It captures the scene in a
hospital nursery, packed with day-old infants. ``It's like a Busby
Berkeley routine,'' Mothersbaugh says.
</P>
<P>
   Not bad for a guy whose signature artistic contribution may have
been turning a flowerpot into a fashion statement about headgear.
And who could forget those yellow lab coats Devo sported?
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking for something to wear on stage and we found
these chemical clean-up outfits,'' Mothersbaugh recalls with a
laugh. ``It cost us five bucks apiece to buy these little plastic
suits.''
</P>
<P>
   But Devo was about more than plastic suits. The band, consisting
primarily of Mothersbaugh and his brother Bob (lead guitar) and
siblings Bob and Jerry Casale (guitar and bass, respectively),
formed in Ohio in the mid '70s. Since the members were art
students, their focus was on the visual _ and they saw the group as
a way to make a statement about an increasingly mechanized,
soulless world. A world in which man was essentially
``de-evolving''; hence, the group's name.
</P>
<P>
   Devo began by making movies, not records, but eventually a few
of their songs found their way to vinyl. They caught the attention
of everyone from label executives to art rockers Iggy Pop and David
Bowie. By 1978, Warner Brothers released their debut album, the
boldly titled, ``Q: Are We Not Men? A: We Are Devo!'' The new wave
had its first heroes.
</P>
<P>
   The band reached its commercial peak in 1980 with its third
album, ``Freedom of Choice,'' which featured the gold-selling
``Whip It.'' The song's video, a favorite of the young MTV network,
featured some of the most arresting images ever to air on music
television: cowboys whipping cowgirls in a bizarre spoof of
Reagan-era home-on-the-ranch politics. But some feminists saw it
otherwise _ as a statement encouraging violence against women.
</P>
<P>
   ``We dealt with a lot of irony, and that is always misunderstood
in this country,'' says Mothersbaugh.
</P>
<P>
   But the biggest misunderstanding may have been labeling Devo a
rock band when in fact it came much closer to the spirit of
performance art. ``It was record companies who pushed to minimalize
that,'' says Mothersbaugh of the group's creative leanings. ``They
wanted us to be a rock band. That was what they knew how to
market.''
</P>
<P>
   Devo's run lasted into the early '90s. And although technically
the band has never broken up (and even played Lollapalooza in
1996), Mothersbaugh was free to pursue other projects, from scoring
feature films (``Bottle Rocket,'' ``Happy Gilmore'') to writing the
theme to TV's ``Pee-Wee's Playhouse.''
</P>
<P>
   But ``Rugrats'' in all its guises _ TV, stage and film _ remains
his biggest undertaking. Bigger in some respects than Devo, he
says. If you don't believe him, just ask a group of kids.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's kind of like the ``Rugrats'' are their Beatles,'' he
concludes.

 &HT;    TechnoBuddy: Extra tools come in handy when exploring the Net
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I have a friend with a two-piece tool kit that
contains a screwdriver _ she holds the blade and whacks balky
devices with its handle _ and a hammer, used when a whack from the
screwdriver isn't quite enough.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, malfunctioning dishwashers or steam irons sometimes
start working after a good pounding. So I'm not here to criticize.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the Internet, many of my friends have just two
``tools'' for using it: a Web browser and an e-mail program. And,
like my friend's hammer and screwdriver, these tools suit them just
fine. If you fit into that category, there's no reason to change.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a whole lot of Internet out there and _ if you want
to explore off the beaten track _ you'll need a few extra tools.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most useful software tools for the Internet is an FTP
program. The initials stand for File Transfer Protocol, and in
earlier days on the Net, almost everyone had one. As you'd guess,
an FTP program is used to upload and download files.
</P>
<P>
   Most any Web browser can download files, but FTP programs work
faster and better. And if you have a Web page, the program is
danged near indispensable since you'll be uploading files to it
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there are some great FTP sites on the Net that contain
free and low-cost programs ready for downloading. Most FTP programs
come pre-programmed with a list of these sites.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite FTP program is WS-FTP. You can get versions for
Windows 3.1, Windows 95/98 or Windows NT. You can download it (just
use your Web browser) at http://www.ipswitch.com/
</P>
<P>
   Products/WS(underscore)FTP/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Macintosh user, you might try a program called
Fetch. I've used it for several years and like it a lot. Just point
at the file you want, drag it to your machine and you're done.
You'll be able to get a copy of Fetch at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .dartmouth.edu/pages/softdev/fetch
</P>
<P>
   .html.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop on our tour of the backwaters of the Net is the
newsgroups. Long before there was a World Wide Web, Internet users
shared information about hobbies and professions using the
newsgroups. (As time moved along, the newsgroups became infamous
for some really bizarre X-rated material so _ if you're a parent or
just don't like to be exposed to this type of stuff _ step
cautiously here.) The newsgroups still are the best choice for
finding answers (and experts) when it comes to special interests
from astronomy to the life cycle of zebras.
</P>
<P>
   Just as is true with file transfers, your browser will give you
access to the newsgroups. But anyone who has ever used a browser
for that purpose knows how clunky it is. Before long, you'll either
give up on the browser as a way to visit newsgroups or give up
newsgroups.
</P>
<P>
   Windows users should check out a program called News Xpress. You
can download it at http://tucows.c-plusnet.com
</P>
<P>
   /news95.html. When it comes to browsing the newsgroups with my
Mac, there's no contest at all. A program called Newswatcher is my
all-time favorite. You can get it at http://charlotte.at.nwu.edu
</P>
<P>
   /jln/progs.ssi.
</P>
<P>
   News readers and FTP programs are just the start. Once you start
traveling the backwaters of the Net, it's difficult to stop. Before
you're done, you'll want a Telnet program (you can use it to
control other computers on the Net), tools to play online games,
programs to analyze and fix Internet problems, programs to measure
the performance of your Internet connection and lots more.
</P>
<P>
   Since we can't cover them all today, let me point you toward an
excellent Web site that both explains how these programs work and
then offers you the chance to download them free. You'll find
versions for both Macintosh and Windows machines here. It's called
Tucows and is at http://www.tucows.com.

 &HT;    Tech Tools: Time passes swimmingly with virtual aquarium
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Life in the virtual world, apparently, is nothing if
not swift. Within 72 hours of setting up her virtual aquarium, one
of my granddaughter's virtual fish got sick, had to be transferred
to the virtual hospital tank and given virtual medicine that made
it virtually well.
</P>
<P>
   All this courtesy of Mindscape's Aquazone Deluxe, a program that
runs on both PC and Macintosh platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I must tell you I have not seen much of this program
myself. Most people consider me an animal lover, but that is not
entirely accurate. I am a mammal lover.
</P>
<P>
   So when this virtual aquarium floated in over the transom, I
decided it would be good to run it by my creature-loving
granddaughter, Allyson. Allyson is 7; her sister Lauren, a
dark-eyed beauty, is 9, and at the moment Lauren's attention is
directed to fashion and clothes and social pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Allyson was quite interested, as it turned out, and was very
restless until we got around to installing the program. Once
installed, I did little more than help her select one of the dozen
pre-organized aquariums. The program comes with no printed manual,
but there is extensive online help, so I left her reading the
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I had to go home soon, but we met the grandkids for
dinner that night and I got an earful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandpa Jack, Grandpa Jack,'' Allyson cried, even before we
were seated. ``I put five fish in the aquarium! I learned how to
condition the water! I fed 'em right away and they were really,
really hungry!''
</P>
<P>
   She had also removed a plant she found less than adequate to her
purposes, and replaced it with another from a menu. Using dialogue
boxes, she had selected each fish she wanted for the aquarium by
type and age. Getting fish of different ages helps her tell one
fish from another of the same species. This is useful, because
names are also chosen for each fish.
</P>
<P>
   That was on Friday. On Sunday morning, we met for brunch, and
she wasn't out of the car before it was ``Grandpa Jack! One of my
fish is sick!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Roger,'' she said breathlessly. ``He's my false
runny-nosed tetra!'' I determined later that Roger is actually a
false rummy-nosed tetra, but for all I know he had a runny nose
when he got sick. At any rate, she described how the computer told
her that Roger was sick, in the early stages of some disease I
didn't quite catch, and needed immediate attention. He was moved to
a properly sanitized hospital tank, free of plant life and,
presumably, any virtual bacteria. Then the computer told her which
medicine to put in the tank, and how much.
</P>
<P>
   She seemed confident of a full recovery, since the disease had
been caught in its early stages.
</P>
<P>
   Aquazone comes complete with various plants and colored gravel,
a pump and thermometer. You can make your own objets d'art _ you
know, little divers and sunken ships and the like _ to dress up the
tank. There's also an unlimited supply of food and medicine.
However, the folks who created this thing didn't fall off the fresh
snapper truck yesterday, and they have ways of hooking more money
out of your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   At $30, Aquazone comes with all the neon tetra and leopard
catfish you can use. However, there are only five each of red
phantom tetra, angelfish, false rummy-nose tetra and black mollies.
If you run out, or want more, there is a Web site where you can go
to buy $10 CDs that contain new kinds of fish and other goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the catch to all this is that your fish are swimming,
getting hungry, risking disease and even breeding whether the
computer is turned on or not. Thus, if you don't want any grisly
surprises and a computer that smells virtually like dead fish,
you'll want to check on things regularly. We are already committed
to caring for Jerry the cavy while the kids are on vacation. I
wonder if we'll have to drive 30 actual miles to their house every
day to feed the virtual fish.

 &HT;    TALL TALES &AMP; SHORT STORIES: Take in dogs? It's what we do.
 &HT;    By Joe Murray
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ My wife brought home a new puppy. That
brings us up to eight. Eight is enough.
</P>
<P>
   My wife thinks this little dog is here only temporarily. She
thinks if I write something charming about the little dog we will
be flooded with offers to adopt it.
</P>
<P>
   OK. Here goes.
</P>
<P>
   The little puppy is about six weeks old. It's a spotted,
chocolate color. There's definitely more than a passing of
rottweiler in his blood line. No telling what else. Possibly a dash
of doberman with a charming measure of chow.
</P>
<P>
   This little dog is so ugly my wife named her Beauty.
</P>
<P>
   Did I forget to mention it's a female?
</P>
<P>
   Let's see. What else?
</P>
<P>
   Oh, yeah. It's blind and deaf.
</P>
<P>
   So if you call wanting her, don't be surprised if the line's
busy. You don't find a dog like this one everyday.
</P>
<P>
   My wife found Beauty with some folks who couldn't properly care
for her. They were planning to turn her over to the humane society.
Doubtful she'd have much of future there.
</P>
<P>
   So my wife took her instead.
</P>
<P>
   It's what we do, take in dogs, but always on a temporary basis.
</P>
<P>
   John The Dog, a yellow short-hair, has been with us temporarily
for so long that he's turning gray. We named him for John The
Baptist, what with his propensity for going wandering in the
wilderness.
</P>
<P>
   That's how John came to us, just appeared one day out of the
woods. He picked us.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the others we picked up from the pound or the side of
the road.
</P>
<P>
   _ Peanut Patty, a black and white border collie mix, was the pet
therapy dog for the animal shelter, appearing in nursing homes and
schools. After she retired, she came to live with us.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lambchop is my personal, laptop poodle. We found her wandering
downtown, her fur matted with grassburrs and looking more like a
dustmop than a dog.
</P>
<P>
   _ Maggie, a Disney-style shaggy dog, was sitting forlornly and
alone in a sleet storm on Thanksgiving eve, huddled next to a for
sale sign at an empty house.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lily, a black-mouth cur, was heaven-sent. My wife found Lily
waiting for her on the steps of the church house. She is named for
the Lily of the Valley.
</P>
<P>
   _ Buster Black is part Jack Russell terrier and part Chihuahau.
As a result, his ears give him the appearance more of a Jack Rabbit
terrier. I found him wandering under the underpass.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jag Wire is our only pooch with papers, a registered
Schnauzer. For whatever reason, her family had given her over to
the animal shelter. Their loss, our gain.
</P>
<P>
   Let's see, now. Did I leave anyone out? I guess that's
everybody. But it's early yet.
</P>
<P>
   I predict we'll require at least one more dog eventually, not
for us but for Beauty. The only problem, you don't see that many
seeing eye dogs on the side of the road.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Late-night phone call solves the problem of millions
 &HT;    By Elizabeth Schuett
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GIBSONBURG, Ohio _ My friend Gail is an intelligent woman. A few
years back she gave up lawyering for a living and moved to the
Oregon coast where she buys little houses and rents them out. She's
having the time of her life just working here and there - in an art
gallery, occasionally in a gourmet cookware shop - and reading
every new book that hits the library's shelves. Once a week she
dons a seriously black robe and volunteers as a teen court judge in
a nearby town.
</P>
<P>
   Gail is educated, worldly wise, and intelligent. She is quite
capable of original thought and informed opinions. But she can't
tell time. ``What time is it?'' I grumble into the phone that has
jarred me out of a midsummer night's slumber.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know but I'm having supper so it can't be too late,''
a chirpy voice replies. ``You'll never guess what I bought today.''
``A house on the bay,'' I mumble back like a run-down tape recorder
operating at half-speed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Silly, that was yesterday. Today I bought a vacuum cleaner.''
That jolts me awake. Not that I want to make any snide comments
about my friend's housekeeping routine, but she's lived out there
for seven years and never owned a vacuum. Her motto has always
been: When you can't walk through it anymore, MOVE.
</P>
<P>
   So naturally, I'm a little concerned at this quick switch.
``Sounds to me like you're suffering from a delayed nesting
instinct. Take a quart of Breyer's butter pecan and go to bed. Call
me if the urge is not gone by morning.'' I pretend I'm not worried
but that isn't the case. My old friend has reached the age where
some folks tend to get a little squirrely and do weird stuff like
taking up nude hang-gliding, or in Gail's case, pushing around a
vacuum cleaner. What's next, I wonder, dusting? I ask her if she
wants me to catch an early morning flight out. She thinks I'm
joking and chatters on but I'm only half-listening running over
reservations and plans for a cat/house sitter (careful how
</P>
<P>
   you read that).
</P>
<P>
   ``Well?'' she asks, ``how many do you want?'' It's obvious I
haven't been paying attention because I don't know what it is I'm
supposed to want some of.
</P>
<P>
   ``Huh?''
</P>
<P>
   ``How many Powerball tickets do you want me to buy for you?''
I'm back in reality. I tell her as many as it takes to win and ask
how many she's going to buy for herself. She tells me none.
</P>
<P>
   ``NONE? What if I win all of the money and you don't?'' I think
it over and do the right thing. ``Okay, if I win, I'll share with
you.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't want it. My life is good right now and all of that money
would only complicate it. Imagine the decisions I'd have to make.
Pretty soon I'd be holding my breath every time the Dow dipped. Men
would be after me for my money, and my kids would hang around like
vultures waiting for me to kick off and make them rich. No,'' she
sighs, ``none for me.''
</P>
<P>
   I'm impressed but not convinced. I can't help wondering aloud
what I might do with a few million bucks. Gail says I probably
wouldn't like being rich because I don't want a big house or a
boat. ``You don't want to winter in the south of France, and you
couldn't care less about a new wardrobe. What are you going to do
with it?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't rush me,'' I tell her. ``I'm thinking maybe I'll do some
philanthropic stuff.'' She wants to know like what.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll start in Washington where the need is greatest. First,
I'll buy Ken Starr a train set, a big one, with snowy villages and
tunnels, and coal cars that really dump. He needs diversion.
</P>
<P>
   ``Next, I'll arrange it so that Monica Lewinsky can send her
clothes to the dry cleaners like normal folks. It's not sanitary
the stuff she keeps hanging around.
</P>
<P>
   ``And while we're talking true love and other District fiction,
I'll start a fund so that everyone who wants a nose job doesn't
have to hire a lawyer and sue the President.''
</P>
<P>
   Gail begins to cluck. She doesn't approve of my politics having
been frightened at an early age by a liberal in Birkenstocks. I
remind her I am the least political person I know and my attitudes
stem only from a low threshold for farce.
</P>
<P>
   ``How many?'' she repeats. I tell her five ought to do it.
</P>
<P>
   ``And after I've blown the lot,'' I confess, ``I'll sell my
vacuum cleaner and move to the Oregon coast, and spend the
remainder of my days with you - in genteel poverty - and dust.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Subpoenaing Gen. Eisenhower
 &HT;    By John Young
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Soldiers, I have an assignment you might not like, but is your
duty to carry out.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Anything but the Normandy coast, Captain. Try us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You are to go back to 1944 and deliver this subpoena to Gen.
Eisenhower.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Subpoena?''
</P>
<P>
   ``The Office of Indefensible Counsel, under direction of Mr.
Starr, has ordered the general to testify about his private life
and the evidence that he carried on a two-year affair with an aide
named Kay Summersby. Your duty, as a time-travel squad operative,
is to deliver the subpoena so we can begin the process of breaking
down Eisenhower's pattern of lies and deception to the American
people.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Pattern of deception?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That he had an alleged mistress, and took the secret to his
grave.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Shouldn't the grave be the end of matters when it comes to
stuff like this?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Not according to the Office of Indeterminate Counsel. As you
know, Mr. Starr has gone so far as to ask the courts to compell a
dead man to talk.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Eisenhower _ leading people in battle, making
life-and-death decisions about our nation's future. This probe
takes precedence?''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This is crazy. How can anyone set out to discredit a war hero
based on personal and private matters?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's probably what they're asking in the time-travel squad
assigned to subpoena President Kennedy. He'll be grilled before an
ex post facto grand jury about his sex life, facing retroactive
impeachment if he won't bare all, as will Franklin Roosevelt,
Grover Cleveland and Lyndon Johnson for covering up reported
trysts.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Captain, it's one thing to go after Bill Clinton if you
believe he lied to a grand jury about an affair. But we can't go
around constructing webs to snare every public figure who ever
fooled around.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes we can. And we will. That's what Starr's Office of
Interminable Counsel is for.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But Eisenhower? One alleged secret aside, his character was
unimpeachable. How could we use this secret to bring him down?''
</P>
<P>
   ``That's quite simple, assuming that you have an agency, like
Starr's Office of Incomprehensible Counsel, with unlimited
resources and no time constraints, probing every act, every
transaction. You have the power to question every friend, every
foe, every confidant, even the dead ones, and throw live ones in
jail if they don't talk.
</P>
<P>
   ``What you do is construct plausible culpability based on any
number of suspicions. Then haul the subject in for questioning
within an overarching and grandiosely framed investigation into
high crimes and misdemeanors, say shady loans, then you ask him the
lowest question you know: 'Did you do it? You know: 'it'? Either he
admits 'it' before the nation, or he commits perjury. Simple
choice.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm sorry, Captain. I'm not sure the American people have
empowered anyone, much less us, to crucify people who've had an
affair.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, yes they have.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Sir, I respectfully challenge the function of a military unit
such as ours, specially trained though we are for time travel, to
be serving this function.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Smell the java, soldier. The Cold War is over. We have no
great wars to fight. Now our national mission is to pry into the
lives of the high and powerful, living and dead, to dwell day and
night, 77 cable channels' worth, on what happened behind closed
doors. No detail spared, from chocolate coating to caramel to
peanuts to creamy nougat.
</P>
<P>
   ``And remember. When people object once we ensnare and indict
Eisenhower, Roosevelt, Cleveland, LBJ, JFK and who-knows-who-else,
we say:
</P>
<P>
   ``'It's not about sex. It's about perjury, high crimes and
misdemeanors and patterns of deception and coverups and
stonewalling. The American people must know the truth.'''

</P>
<P>
   SUPERMARKETS-COMPETITION (San Francisco) _ Lucky may call itself
the ``low price leader,'' but the merger announced between Lucky
Stores' parent company and Albertson's Inc. left shoppers wondering
whether the store would maintain this image after the buyout was
complete. By VICTORIA COLLIVER.
</P>
<P>
   OFFSHORE-JUSTICE (Houston) _ An offshore oil platform may appear
to be a refuge on the high seas, but it can also be a trap with no
escape for workers facing harassment. It's an offshore workplace
that is isolated and controlled by the large energy companies
bankrolling the operations. Law enforcement authorities say they
rarely if ever are called in to conduct criminal investigations of
incidents on offshore platforms. By MICHAEL DAVIS.
</P>
<P>
   WELLS-ONLINE (San Francisco) _ Leaping into the torrid on-line
brokerage field, Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. has rolled out an Internet
service designed to appeal to traditional bank customers and active
on-line investors. By EDWARD IWATA.
</P>
<P>
   NATIONAL NEWS (``a'' category)
</P>
<P>
   PATAKI-CONTRIBUTIONS (Albany, N.Y.) _ New York Gov. George
Pataki, touted by some as a potential candidate for national
office, is raking in contributions from out-of-state donors,
according to state records. By JOHN CAHER and JAMES M. ODATO
</P>
<P>
   LIFESTYLE/FEATURES (``l'' category)
</P>
<P>
   HOME-CHURCHES (San Antonio) _ Glyn Taylor Jr. drives 45 minutes
each Sunday to worship God, but it's not to a sparkling megachurch
that he travels. He's one of a small but growing number of
Americans who worship regularly in private homes, where they say
they like total participation and lack of formal ritual. By J.
MICHAEL PARKER.
</P>
<P>
   SPORTS (``s'' category)
</P>
<P>
   BBA-YANKEES (Albany, N.Y.) _ In the end, the New York Yankees
did nothing. And it must have been hard for owner George
Steinbrenner to let the major-league trading deadline come and go
without strong-arming his baseball people into doing something. By
STEVE CAMPBELL.
</P>
<P>
   MINOR-LEAGUES (San Jose, Calif.) _ It has become a cliche to wax
nostalgic about minor-league ball, to say the minors have all the
friendliness and heart and hunger big-league ball has lost. That
kind of sighing nostalgia is easy to understand, given a night at
the San Jose Municipal Stadium. By EDVINS BEITIKS.
</P>
<P>
   COMMENTARY (``k'' category)
</P>
<P>
   MORSE-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ The most important day in Bill
Clinton's presidency will be Aug. 17. That's the day he relays his
testimony to the Ken Starr grand jury, and probably to the rest of
the nation, given Washington's colander-like leaks. By ROB MORSE.
</P>
<P>
   LYNCH-COLUMN (Albany, N.Y.) _ These days, it's possible to leave
your electronic fingerprints just about everywhere. Now, motorists
who use the electronic E-ZPass to pay tolls on the New York Thruway
also can get speeding tickets _ thanks to E-ZPass. So no E-ZPass
for me. I figure that they already know enough about me as it is.
By DAN LYNCH.
</P>
<P>
   SALTER-COLUMN (San Francisco) _ To anti-abortion activists, he
is a mass murderer. But to a 12-year-old Michigan girl and her
parents, he is one of the few shafts of light in an unbelievably
dark nightmare. Dr. George Tiller, one of only a handful of
physicians in the nation who perform third trimester abortions,
apparently ended the pregnancy of the adolescent Detroit area girl
last week. By STEPHANIE SALTER.
</P>
<P>
   HISPANIC-ENTREPRENEURS (Washington) _ Quietly and almost without
notice, Hispanics have emerged as the nation's fastest-growing pool
of business owners. Hispanics already own 43 percent more U.S.
companies than Asians, widely known for their prolific business
formation, and 225,000 more businesses than blacks, who make up a
larger share of the population. By TYCE PALMAFFY.

   TEEPEN-COLUMN _ Since the cigarette companies' game has been to
distract us from the obvious, CDC has had to go to the bother of
proving the obvious. A CDC study finds that a sharp increase in
cigarette taxes would deeply slash sales, precisely the objective
of recently failed legislation that would have used a cigarette tax
increase to force up the price. No surprise there. (Teepen, Cox

   MURRAY-COLUMN _ ANGELINA COUNTY, Texas _ My wife brought home a

thinks this little dog is here only temporarily. She thinks if I

with offers to adopt it. It's what we do, take in dogs, but always

   KLEINBERG-COLUMN _ There are some things that just won't go

Castro. Last week was a wickedly interesting period on the Castro
front. Howard Kleinberg is a former editor of the Miami News.
(Kleinberg, Cox News Service) MOVED.

<P>
   ROSENFELD-SHORTTAKES _ Iran has joined the missile club. There
is not much to do but fret. I have stolen _ and, I hope,
respectfully advanced _ an idea from Joseph Heller's great war
novel ``Catch-22.'' Arnold Rosenfeld is editor-in-chief of the Cox
Newspapers. (Rosenfeld, Cox News Service) MOVED.
</P>
<P>

him. (Kabat, Waco Tribune-Herald) MOVED.

 &HT;    Commentary: The reason for the rain
 &HT;    By Vicki Marsh Kabat
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WACO, Texas _ The mind-numbing summer heat in our part of Texas
was interrupted awhile back by a bit of precipitation. No doubt it
has evaporated from most folks' memories much like the rain in the
afternoon thunderclouds does before it hits the earth.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, it's important to set the record straight and
inform the perspiring public of the person responsible for bringing
that much-cherished moisture to our arid part of the world. It was
my husband, and I think he should get the credit dew ... er, due
him.
</P>
<P>
   It began innocently enough on one of our days off. While I was
putting away dishes and cleaning up the kitchen after breakfast, I
looked out the front window and saw him washing one of our cars. I
nearly dropped the glass I was holding.
</P>
<P>
   Let me explain. My husband has not washed a vehicle since he was
a teen-ager and his father made him wash the car every Saturday. As
soon as he got away from home, he started going to the car wash.
</P>
<P>
   Our sons have been pressed into this service throughout the
years. As soon as they were toddling, my husband was outside
showing them how to scrub the hubcaps and rinse with the hose.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't you think they're a little young for that?'' I'd ask.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm bonding with them,'' he'd answer. Uh-huh.
</P>
<P>
   Now here he was, splattered with water from head to toe,
industriously attacking the top of our sedan.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're washing the car'' I asked idiotically as he stood
there, running hose in one hand and soapy sponge in the other.
``You never wash the car.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Well,'' he said, somewhat defensively, ``I just felt like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   I went over and put my hand on his brow, checking for fever. All
I found was sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're scaring me,'' I told him. Then I went into the garage
and looked up.
</P>
<P>
   ``What on earth are you doing?'' he asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Checking to see if you've hung a ping pong ball from the
ceiling to hit the windshield exactly where you want the car
parked,'' I answered, a trick his father had done in his garage
that I always found terribly amusing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Just go inside, smart-aleck,'' he muttered. Funny how that
same sparkling wit that attracted him 20 years ago so disturbs him
today.
</P>
<P>
   He washed all three of our cars that morning, using up all our
window cleaner and paper towels in the process. When he finished,
he sat on the porch and admired his work much like a farmer
surveying an expanse of ripening field corn.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud of you, dear,'' I said, patting his shoulder as we
admired the gleaming metallic beasts.
</P>
<P>
   Just then the sky rumbled. A gust of wind whipped up from
nowhere, rippling the thick curtain of humidity and heat that has
hung over our land for weeks. We looked at each other and laughed
nervously.
</P>
<P>
   Ten minutes later, huge drops pelted down, forming indentations
in the dirt in our yard and speckling the shiny finishes on the
cars. Stunned, we sat on the porch and watched the first rain in
ages stream down around us ... and onto the cars.
</P>
<P>
   It lasted about five minutes. It was more of a good spitting
than a real rain. Just enough to increase the humidity another 20
percent and ruin my husband's car washing job.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't believe it,'' he said, shaking his head.
</P>
<P>
   We looked up into the sky, already lightening.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think it was anything personal, honey,'' I offered.
</P>
<P>
   When that didn't seem to help, I tried again. ``Look at it this
way. You single-handedly caused that rainfall. Don't you feel
powerful?''
</P>
<P>
   I left him muttering to himself on the front porch. Poor dear.
All that work ... for nothing. I mean, we didn't even get a good
rain out of it, which we all would have welcomed.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, he came inside, dumped the armload of towels he had
used to wipe down the cars into the washing machine, and sprawled
out on the bed.
</P>
<P>
   ``Done for the day?'' I asked.
</P>
<P>
   ``Naw,'' he answered. ``I think I'll go out and paint the house.
That should bring a real downpour.''
</P>

 &HT;    A monkey tale: Life's a barrel full of lessons
 &HT;    By Ron Wiggins
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   LANTANA, Fla. _ Janice Ferraiolo has a monkey on her back. And
in her kitchen and bedroom, in her pantries, drawers, cupboard and
refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake,'' a 9-pound, 10-year-old capuchin monkey, native to
South America, has the run of the Ferraiolo household, whose census
also includes two adults, two teenagers, two cats and two dogs.
</P>
<P>
   But Jake is not a pet. He has a vocation, a mission in life,
even if no one has told him. A year from now, when he has completed
four years of socialization, he will be eligible for ``monkey
helper'' training at the Helping Hands Training Center in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   After completing a six-month program there, Jake will be given
to a quadriplegic to perform a remarkable array of tasks. Jake is
expected to replace a human attendant for up to 12 hours a time.
He'll turn pages, load computer discs, and fetch everything from
beverages to the mouthstick quadriplegics use for typing and other
tasks.
</P>
<P>
   And because capuchins seem to like humans, they come with a
lifetime supply of hugs and kisses. A capuchin lifetime, by the
way, is about 40 years.
</P>
<P>
   ``Meet Jake,'' Ferraiolo said, sliding open the glass door to
her screened patio as a four-legged ball of white fur with a black
mask streaked into the room.
</P>
<P>
   ``Funny, he looks a lot like a pug dog,'' the visitor remarked.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's Elmo,'' Ferraiolo said. ``He's Jake's dog.''
</P>
<P>
   A monkey has his own dog?
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake seems to think so,'' the primate's foster mom said dryly.
</P>
<P>
   Jake himself then bounded into the room, all fur and tail and
small, expressive white face. The monkey skirmished indecisively
with Elmo and then vaulted over Spike, the Doberman pinscher,
before scampering into the kitchen to open the refrigerator.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have locks on everything,'' sighed Ferraiolo, hurrying to
the kitchen to prevent the raid. She then secured the door with a
squeeze lock that, so far, has frustrated Jake.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's worse than having a 2-year-old,'' Ferraiolo said. ``He's
into everything.''
</P>
<P>
   Ferraiolo's decision to be foster parent to a monkey for the
Boston-based nonprofit group was not lightly taken. She underwent
rigorous screening, obtained permits, undertook 1,000 hours of
monkey care training and then waited years before acquiring Jake
from an elderly foster couple who could no longer keep him.
</P>
<P>
   Jake jumps on a kitchen counter and begins drinking from a
glass.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is that mommy's glass?'' Ferraiolo intoned with that voice
mommies get. ``You have your own sippy cup, Jake, put it down.''
</P>
<P>
   The visitor noted that Jake put the glass down carefully, almost
if he understood the consequences of glass dropped on tile.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's careful and very smart,'' Ferraiolo said. ``Tail, Jake.
Give me your tail.''
</P>
<P>
   This is what you say when you want to pick up a capuchin.
Ideally, the animal comes to you and presents his thick, prehensile
tail and you hoist him up by it. Only this time, Jake seems
distracted.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm afraid I will need your help,'' Ferraiolo said to the
visitor. ``Monkeys have a hierarchy. As a male, you are the top
monkey in the room. Say in a firm voice, `Tail, Jake.' ''
</P>
<P>
   The visitor does so, and like magic, Jake submits to Ferraiolo.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jake and I are usually equals,'' she explained. ``When my
husband Sal is here, he's the top monkey. Monkeys need to be above
somebody, and in our household, that's our daughter. If I yell at
Jake, he immediately runs over and smacks or pinches Tara, my
17-year-old. If we argue, Jake takes my side.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake, she said, spends 12 hours a day out of his cage. He sleeps
with three ``blankies'' and is not a morning person.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the household is up and around, he covers his head until
about 9:30 or so,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   He also eats at the table with the family, but on a leash. As a
service animal in training, he has the rights of guide dogs.
Ferraiolo takes Jake out in public, and although he has impeccable
table manners, she is careful to select restaurants with outdoor
seating and only after calling ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have to explain to people that Jake is not a pet and that
he does not like children. He will scratch if a child walks up and
tries to pet him.''
</P>
<P>
   What's in it for Ferraiolo, who, in the end, will have devoted
several years to Jake, only to have to give him away?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to keep reminding myself that Jake does not belong to
me,'' Ferraiolo said. ``The only way I will be able to stand it is
to think of what it will mean to a quadriplegic to have Jake as a
friend and helper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference these loving animals make in these people's
lives is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT HELPING HANDS
</P>
<P>
   Monkey foster parents aren't charged for the animal, but
expenses run about $600 a year for food (kibble, fruits and
poultry), diapers, wet-wipes and trips to the vet. All costs are
absorbed by the foster families and the Helping Hands Training
Center. Training and placing a monkey costs $25,000, according to
Jean Amaral, program administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Jake is one of 190 monkeys Helping Hands has currently placed
with foster families. Of these, about a half dozen a year are
accepted for six months of intensive training before being given
cost-free to a quadriplegic patient. `Ideally, we could place 18 if
we had the money,' Amaral says. More than 6,000 quadriplegics in
the U.S. would be eligible for monkey helpers, she says.
</P>
<P>
   If you were thinking of buying a capuchin for a pet, Janice
Ferraiolo asks that you reconsider. Buying a $3,000 to $5,000
monkey encourages poachers to capture baby monkeys in the wild by
killing the parents. Helping Hands monkeys are colony bred to be
disease-free and companions to humans.

Training Center, 1505 Commonwealth Ave., Boston, MA 02135.

Jake, he immediately runs over and smacks or pinches Tara, my
17-year-old. If we argue, Jake takes my side.''
</P>
<P>
   Jake, she said, spends 12 hours a day out of his cage. He sleeps
with three ``blankies'' and is not a morning person.
</P>
<P>
   ``While the household is up and around, he covers his head until
about 9:30 or so,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   He also eats at the table with the family, but on a leash. As a
service animal in training, he has the rights of guide dogs.
Ferraiolo takes Jake out in public, and although he has impeccable
table manners, she is careful to select restaurants with outdoor
seating and only after calling ahead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I do have to explain to people that Jake is not a pet and that
he does not like children. He will scratch if a child walks up and
tries to pet him.''
</P>
<P>
   What's in it for Ferraiolo, who, in the end, will have devoted
several years to Jake, only to have to give him away?
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to keep reminding myself that Jake does not belong to
me,'' Ferraiolo said. ``The only way I will be able to stand it is
to think of what it will mean to a quadriplegic to have Jake as a
friend and helper.
</P>
<P>
   ``The difference these loving animals make in these people's
lives is amazing.''
</P>
<P>
   ABOUT HELPING HANDS
</P>
<P>
   Monkey foster parents aren't charged for the animal, but
expenses run about $600 a year for food (kibble, fruits and
poultry), diapers, wet-wipes and trips to the vet. All costs are
absorbed by the foster families and the Helping Hands Training
Center. Training and placing a monkey costs $25,000, according to
Jean Amaral, program administrator.
</P>
<P>
   Jake is one of 190 monkeys Helping Hands has currently placed
with foster families. Of these, about a half dozen a year are
accepted for six months of intensive training before being given
cost-free to a quadriplegic patient. `Ideally, we could place 18 if
we had the money,' Amaral says. More than 6,000 quadriplegics in
the U.S. would be eligible for monkey helpers, she says.
</P>
<P>
   If you were thinking of buying a capuchin for a pet, Janice
Ferraiolo asks that you reconsider. Buying a $3,000 to $5,000
monkey encourages poachers to capture baby monkeys in the wild by
killing the parents. Helping Hands monkeys are colony bred to be
disease-free and companions to humans.

 &HT;    Austin seeks to avoid pipe ruptures
 &HT;    By Rebeca Rodriguez
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox New Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN _ The recent massive break in a 90-inch water pipeline
that serves Fort Worth has Austin experts looking at how to prevent
a similar rupture here.
</P>
<P>
   As dry, shifting soil and fatally hot temperatures continue to
plague the entire state, water mains large and small are literally
bursting at the seams. The Tarrant County break stands as a
reminder of how powerful the heat can be. Austin recorded more than
40 smaller breaks of its own during the second half of July, and
more could be on the way if the drought persists.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have the same type of potential here that could cause
ruptures,'' said Michael Raney, an Austin researcher with the
Natural Resources Conservation Service, an arm of the United States
Department of Agriculture that studies soil and water. ``Some of
the same type of soils (as those in Tarrant County) exist along the
I-35 corridor.''
</P>
<P>
   The high clay content of soil in the Blacklands region where
Fort Worth is situated makes it prone to tremendous heat-triggered
shifts in soil, said Virgil Helm, an Arlington researcher with the
same agency. There, the clay content is so high that swelling and
shrinking are commonplace and the heat can dry out the soil so much
it cracks.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't believe I've ever seen cracks as severe as those I've
seen this year,'' Helm said.
</P>
<P>
   Even when completely baked, clayretains 8 to 10 percent of its
moisture, but its volume decreases substantially, causing deep
fissures. Those fissures contributed to the massive water main
break in Fort Worth, which caused a half-billion gallon loss of
water, slashed the water supply to Tarrant County by a third and
prompted city officials to call for an immediate, complete ban on
outdoor watering.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were trying to keep up with demands, but you just can't run
equipment at full speed forever and expect it to keep working,''
said David Marshall, manager of engineering services with the
Tarrant Regional Water District.
</P>
<P>
   Central Texas soil is clay-rich or clay-poor, depending on where
you stand, Raney said. Interstate 35 runs roughly along a ridge
dividing clay-rich soil on the east from clay-poor soil on the
west, and the risk of water main breaks could depend on where water
lines are located.
</P>
<P>
   And rain might not solve the problem, Helm said. Water pouring
into cracks could initially cause even more breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We get rain and it begins to swell, those cracks will absorb a
tremendous amount of water and cause uneven pressure and possibly
more cracks,'' Helm said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's bad when it's dry, and when it rains it's not much
better.''
</P>
<P>
   In Austin, the lower Colorado River is the primary source of
water. Pipelines carry the water from the river to one of three
water treatment plants, and then to businesses and homes around the
city. Drought-like conditions have caused several water main breaks
around the city _ more than 40 from July 13 29. Although many of
those breaks wereheat-related, most involved pipes 6 inches in
diameter or less. Contractors who drilled into pipe by accident
caused two of the larger breaks.
</P>
<P>
   But large water mains, including a 66-inch one running through
town, are situated all over the city, and continued pressure from
heat and increased demand make pipe ruptures a constant risk.
</P>
<P>
   To help avoid that risk, city crews are constantly monitoring
pipe performance and renovating older lines, said Dan Arguijo, a
spokesman with the city's water department. He said a break in
Austin like the one in Tarrant County is not likely.

 &HT;    Florida Senior Smarts team gearing up for new title
 &HT;    By Douglas Belkin
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. _ What 1943 movie based on a Walter Von
Tillberg Clark ...
</P>
<P>
   Sorry, too slow. The answer is ``The Ox Bow Incident'' and
Martin Ryan, age 71, hit the buzzer halfway between Von and
Tillberg.
</P>
<P>
   He also knew that New Guinea is the world's second-largest
island, the tse-tse fly spreads African sleeping sickness and the
plague recorded in the book of Exodus that decimated Egypt in 1900
B.C. was likely caused by anthrax.
</P>
<P>
   Humbled yet? Ryan graciously urges you not to be. He was a
merchant marine for 10 years, he explains. He had an awful lot of
time to read.
</P>
<P>
   ``All these facts just sort of built up,'' he says. ``Plus, I do
have a good memory.''
</P>
<P>
   It's a common trait among Ryan's mates on the Senior Smarts
team, which every Friday morning at the Jewish Community Center in
suburban Delray Beach trades questions and answers with the
intensity of blue-chips during a bull run on the stock exchange
floor.
</P>
<P>
   Though competition is genial, there's a touch of ego at stake.
And then, of course, there's a tradition to protect: For four of
the last six years, the four-member Palm Beach County traveling
team has garnered first-place awards at the Florida State Seniors
Academic Competition. The team, which is culled from senior-center
teams from around the county, will be competing for a fifth state
title on Aug. 12 in Orlando against four other county teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``The beauty of it is that it keeps your mind sharp,'' Dorothy
Greenfield said. ``I was always the brightest kid in class.''
</P>
<P>
   More than knowledge is required. Speed is of the essence.
Contestants are asked questions in several different formats but,
just like ``Jeopardy!,'' the first one to the buzzer gets first
crack at many of the answers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're looking for a high school college bowl team to play,''
Greenfield says.
</P>
<P>
   With at least 300 years of accumulated wisdom among any quartet
they fielded, wouldn't the seniors overmatch any teen team?
</P>
<P>
   Greenfield's not so sure: ``We've had more time to learn, but
we've also had more time to forget.''

 &HT;    Blowing up a storm
 &HT;    By Kevin D. Thompson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ORLANDO, Fla. _ There you are. Face-to-face with a
five-story-tall, 12-foot-wide tornado. A swirling demon spirit that
can topple 25-foot telephone poles like toothpicks. Snap sturdy
power lines like pencil-thin twigs. Toss 2,000-pound jeeps like rag
dolls and cause gas pumps to explode in spectacular fireballs.
</P>
<P>
   And don't forget that flying cow.
</P>
<P>
   Sound dangerous? It's not. Intense? You bet.
</P>
<P>
   It's Twister. . . Ride It Out, Universal Studio's latest
gee-whiz, you-gotta-see-this attraction. Based on the 1996 movie
starring Bill Paxton and Helen Hunt, Twister boasts the largest
indoor tornado ever created and has quickly become Universal's
second most-popular attraction behind Terminator 2 3-D.
</P>
<P>
   Even though Twister is, as Universal boasts, a thrilling way to
``ride the movies,'' it was a not-so-thrilling ride to promote. The
18-minute attraction (with a 2 1/2-minute storm) was supposed to
open the first week in March, but was postponed a month after a
rash of real-life twisters devastated Central Florida.
</P>
<P>
   According to the National Weather Service, the national tornado
death toll is 122 _ the worst since 1984 and nearly double the toll
for all of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   So, it's no surprise that unlike the $60 million T2-3D, which
got A-list, red carpet treatment, Twister's unveiling was subdued.
For instance, a big, star-studded opening gala, which was to have
included Paxton, Hunt and Steven Spielberg (the movie's executive
producer), was scrapped at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   ``It just wasn't appropriate,'' says one Universal spokeswoman.
</P>
<P>
   Naturally, Universal says it has no regrets about building a
multimillion-dollar attraction (Universal's keeping mum on the
price tag) that's based on such a destructive, real-life phenomena.
</P>
<P>
   ``We never believed we did the wrong thing,'' says Mike
Hightower, Twister's project director. ``But we wanted to make sure
the public knew that we were sensitive to the situation and that we
were going to provide some sort of education for people.''
</P>
<P>
   That education comes in the form of Red Cross brochures that are
handed out to guests after leaving Twister and posters plastered
throughout the attraction that dispel long-held myths and informs
people how to survive a tornado.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Griffin, president of Attraction Services, a Valencia,
Calif., special effects company, says Universal is just feeding a
growing appetite for such blockbuster attractions.
</P>
<P>
   ``Does it bother me to build a disaster attraction? No,'' says
Griffin, whose 3-year-old company created several Twister effects,
including the massive fire sequences. ``Does it bother me that
people get killed by real tornadoes? Of course. But there are a lot
of attractions that have the same problem. There's Earthquake.
There's Jaws, and we know people get eaten by sharks. But that's
what the public wants.''
</P>
<P>
   The decision to make Twister was made two months after the movie
opened. Although roundly panned by most movie critics for its inept
plot, ``Twister'' did boast many impressive effects that made it a
natural theme park attraction.
</P>
<P>
   But several questions had to be answered before the project got
the green light. Could a realistic, 50-foot tornado be created? If
so, could it be contained so it wouldn't blow Universal Studios to
Kansas? What would the major effects be? Should Twister be a
traditional ride or walk-through attraction? How hot should the
fire be? Could a durable attraction that could accommodate 2,400
guests an hour, 365 days a year be created?
</P>
<P>
   ``The film really delivered some spectacular special effects and
really allowed you to see and feel what it was like to be in the
heart of a tornado,'' notes Eddie Newquist, Universal's vice
president of attraction development. ``Because we had never done
this before at a theme park, that was our biggest challenge.''
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Church, a physics professor at Miami University in
Oxford, Ohio, wasn't sure that Universal could meet that Herculean
task.
</P>
<P>
   ``They wanted a tornado of ridiculous size,'' recalls Church, a
Twister consultant who has studied man-made tornadoes in
laboratories for 20 years. ``My reaction was it wasn't possible.
Universal wasn't prepared for the amount of research and
development the whole team had to do. They thought (they) could get
a design and buy it.''
</P>
<P>
   After scaling down its ideas (Universal originally wanted to
create a 60-foot-tall twister that was 20 feet in diameter) and
consulting a battery of scientists and wind-flow experts, the theme
park operators were told that a huge _ and controllable _ indoor
tornado could indeed be created.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a number of museums that have small tornadoes that
are used to check air flows and currents,'' notes Newquist. ``So we
felt that if we could increase the size of these science projects,
and make this elaborate science project, we could do it.''
</P>
<P>
   Twister uses dozens of powerful, specially designed fans to
create its unique vortex. Among them are 18 fans with 7-foot-long
blades positioned on ground level, mid-level and high-level.
</P>
<P>
   Jan de Bont, who directed the movie, wasn't too involved in the
project. But Hightower says de Bont did sit through a presentation
and commented that he ``wanted a lot of flying debris, a lot of
wind and a lot of intensity.''
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg was at the same presentation. What did he think?
</P>
<P>
   ``At the end of the demonstration, he just turned around, looked
at me and said, `How did you do that?' '' says Hightower. ``We were
all kind of nervous, especially when you're presenting something to
a creative genius like Steven Spielberg.''
</P>
<P>
   The project took 18 months to complete. Many theme park
attractions, however, are built in four or five years. During peak
periods, 500 people were working on Twister.
</P>
<P>
   ``That schedule was tough,'' says Attraction Services' Griffin,
noting that during the installation phase some employees clocked 30
consecutive hours. ``And we couldn't slip. When Universal says
they're opening a theme park attraction on a given day, marketing
revolves around that so it has to open that day. Unlike a
government job, they'll just say, `Oh, we won't have that plane
ready this year.' ''
</P>
<P>
   One thing Universal wanted to do, but couldn't, was blow 50 mph
winds on guests. (The closest a visitor gets to the tornado is 25
feet.)
</P>
<P>
   ``We found out that the more wind we blew on the guests, the
more detrimental it was to the tornado,'' Hightower explains. So
they settled on 40 mph winds.
</P>
<P>
   Universal also settled on making Twister a walk-through
attraction, unlike Jaws or Back to the Future, which are
traditional theme park rides.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you're sitting down in a theater and watching this tornado,
you're not part of the show,'' says Hightower.
</P>
<P>
   Before you even experience the twister, you see a variety of set
pieces, including storm-chaser vehicles and high-tech weather
equipment. After getting a ominous introduction on twisters from
Hunt and Paxton (``Few have stared it in the face and lived to tell
the tale,'' Paxton dramatically says at one point), guests then
walk through the wreckage of what used to be Aunt Meg's home. You
hear creaking noises. Hissing sounds. Lights flicker off and on.
Then a guy with a hard-hat guides you to the soundstage where the
tornado awaits.
</P>
<P>
   If you're thinking about taking your small children on Twister,
think again. Like the movie, the attraction is rated PG-13 _ and
for good reason. With frighteningly real lightning (a tree is split
in half), explosions (diner windows are shattered), sound effects
(110 decibels _ as loud as a Smashing Pumpkins concert) and pelting
rain, you do feel like you're in the eye of a real storm.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is really too intense for kids who are 5 or 6,''
Hightower says.
</P>
<P>
   Believe it or not, Universal only needs one operator to control
all the special effects. Everything is computer controlled and
pre-programmed, so all an operator essentially has to do is monitor
the equipment and make sure everything runs smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is smooth, however, on the wind-swept, rain-soaked
Twister soundstage. But that's how it's supposed to be.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our intention was to never terrify people or show them the
horrors of a tornado,'' says Newquist. ``Our intention was to allow
guests to experience an exciting weather phenomena. It's not about
real-life tornadoes. It's about a movie.''
</P>
<P>
   One that looks frighteningly real.

 &HT;    TechnoBuddy: Extra tools come in handy when exploring the Net
 &HT;    By Bill Husted
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ I have a friend with a two-piece tool kit that
contains a screwdriver _ she holds the blade and whacks balky
devices with its handle _ and a hammer, used when a whack from the
screwdriver isn't quite enough.
</P>
<P>
   Strangely, malfunctioning dishwashers or steam irons sometimes
start working after a good pounding. So I'm not here to criticize.
</P>
<P>
   When it comes to the Internet, many of my friends have just two
``tools'' for using it: a Web browser and an e-mail program. And,
like my friend's hammer and screwdriver, these tools suit them just
fine. If you fit into that category, there's no reason to change.
</P>
<P>
   But there's a whole lot of Internet out there and _ if you want
to explore off the beaten track _ you'll need a few extra tools.
</P>
<P>
   One of the most useful software tools for the Internet is an FTP
program. The initials stand for File Transfer Protocol, and in
earlier days on the Net, almost everyone had one. As you'd guess,
an FTP program is used to upload and download files.
</P>
<P>
   Most any Web browser can download files, but FTP programs work
faster and better. And if you have a Web page, the program is
danged near indispensable since you'll be uploading files to it
regularly.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, there are some great FTP sites on the Net that contain
free and low-cost programs ready for downloading. Most FTP programs
come pre-programmed with a list of these sites.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite FTP program is WS-FTP. You can get versions for
Windows 3.1, Windows 95/98 or Windows NT. You can download it (just
use your Web browser) at http://www.ipswitch.com/
</P>
<P>
   Products/WS(underscore)FTP/index.html.
</P>
<P>
   If you're a Macintosh user, you might try a program called
Fetch. I've used it for several years and like it a lot. Just point
at the file you want, drag it to your machine and you're done.
You'll be able to get a copy of Fetch at http://www
</P>
<P>
   .dartmouth.edu/pages/softdev/fetch
</P>
<P>
   .html.
</P>
<P>
   The next stop on our tour of the backwaters of the Net is the
newsgroups. Long before there was a World Wide Web, Internet users
shared information about hobbies and professions using the
newsgroups. (As time moved along, the newsgroups became infamous
for some really bizarre X-rated material so _ if you're a parent or
just don't like to be exposed to this type of stuff _ step
cautiously here.) The newsgroups still are the best choice for
finding answers (and experts) when it comes to special interests
from astronomy to the life cycle of zebras.
</P>
<P>
   Just as is true with file transfers, your browser will give you
access to the newsgroups. But anyone who has ever used a browser
for that purpose knows how clunky it is. Before long, you'll either
give up on the browser as a way to visit newsgroups or give up
newsgroups.
</P>
<P>
   Windows users should check out a program called News Xpress. You
can download it at http://tucows.c-plusnet.com
</P>
<P>
   /news95.html. When it comes to browsing the newsgroups with my
Mac, there's no contest at all. A program called Newswatcher is my
all-time favorite. You can get it at http://charlotte.at.nwu.edu
</P>
<P>
   /jln/progs.ssi.
</P>
<P>
   News readers and FTP programs are just the start. Once you start
traveling the backwaters of the Net, it's difficult to stop. Before
you're done, you'll want a Telnet program (you can use it to
control other computers on the Net), tools to play online games,
programs to analyze and fix Internet problems, programs to measure
the performance of your Internet connection and lots more.
</P>
<P>
   Since we can't cover them all today, let me point you toward an
excellent Web site that both explains how these programs work and
then offers you the chance to download them free. You'll find
versions for both Macintosh and Windows machines here. It's called
Tucows and is at http://www.tucows.com.

 &HT;    Tech Tools: Time passes swimmingly with virtual aquarium
 &HT;    By Jack Warner
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Life in the virtual world, apparently, is nothing if
not swift. Within 72 hours of setting up her virtual aquarium, one
of my granddaughter's virtual fish got sick, had to be transferred
to the virtual hospital tank and given virtual medicine that made
it virtually well.
</P>
<P>
   All this courtesy of Mindscape's Aquazone Deluxe, a program that
runs on both PC and Macintosh platforms.
</P>
<P>
   Now, I must tell you I have not seen much of this program
myself. Most people consider me an animal lover, but that is not
entirely accurate. I am a mammal lover.
</P>
<P>
   So when this virtual aquarium floated in over the transom, I
decided it would be good to run it by my creature-loving
granddaughter, Allyson. Allyson is 7; her sister Lauren, a
dark-eyed beauty, is 9, and at the moment Lauren's attention is
directed to fashion and clothes and social pursuits.
</P>
<P>
   Allyson was quite interested, as it turned out, and was very
restless until we got around to installing the program. Once
installed, I did little more than help her select one of the dozen
pre-organized aquariums. The program comes with no printed manual,
but there is extensive online help, so I left her reading the
instructions.
</P>
<P>
   My wife and I had to go home soon, but we met the grandkids for
dinner that night and I got an earful.
</P>
<P>
   ``Grandpa Jack, Grandpa Jack,'' Allyson cried, even before we
were seated. ``I put five fish in the aquarium! I learned how to
condition the water! I fed 'em right away and they were really,
really hungry!''
</P>
<P>
   She had also removed a plant she found less than adequate to her
purposes, and replaced it with another from a menu. Using dialogue
boxes, she had selected each fish she wanted for the aquarium by
type and age. Getting fish of different ages helps her tell one
fish from another of the same species. This is useful, because
names are also chosen for each fish.
</P>
<P>
   That was on Friday. On Sunday morning, we met for brunch, and
she wasn't out of the car before it was ``Grandpa Jack! One of my
fish is sick!''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's Roger,'' she said breathlessly. ``He's my false
runny-nosed tetra!'' I determined later that Roger is actually a
false rummy-nosed tetra, but for all I know he had a runny nose
when he got sick. At any rate, she described how the computer told
her that Roger was sick, in the early stages of some disease I
didn't quite catch, and needed immediate attention. He was moved to
a properly sanitized hospital tank, free of plant life and,
presumably, any virtual bacteria. Then the computer told her which
medicine to put in the tank, and how much.
</P>
<P>
   She seemed confident of a full recovery, since the disease had
been caught in its early stages.
</P>
<P>
   Aquazone comes complete with various plants and colored gravel,
a pump and thermometer. You can make your own objets d'art _ you
know, little divers and sunken ships and the like _ to dress up the
tank. There's also an unlimited supply of food and medicine.
However, the folks who created this thing didn't fall off the fresh
snapper truck yesterday, and they have ways of hooking more money
out of your pocket.
</P>
<P>
   At $30, Aquazone comes with all the neon tetra and leopard
catfish you can use. However, there are only five each of red
phantom tetra, angelfish, false rummy-nose tetra and black mollies.
If you run out, or want more, there is a Web site where you can go
to buy $10 CDs that contain new kinds of fish and other goodies.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the catch to all this is that your fish are swimming,
getting hungry, risking disease and even breeding whether the
computer is turned on or not. Thus, if you don't want any grisly
surprises and a computer that smells virtually like dead fish,
you'll want to check on things regularly. We are already committed
to caring for Jerry the cavy while the kids are on vacation. I
wonder if we'll have to drive 30 actual miles to their house every
day to feed the virtual fish.

LEWINSKY, COUNTRY HAVE SAME GOAL: GET IT OVER WITH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- OK, so Linda Tripp turns out not to be you, much
less the ``average American'' of her scripted self-portrayal, a
proposition around which Americans appear prepared to unite. But
there is someone at the heart of this mess who can be said to speak
with, if not exactly for, the country.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If you think about it, what is best for this young woman is best
for everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   From the inevitable ``sources familiar with her personal and
legal situation,'' her personal goal is a real life, free of
momentary and thus false celebrity. And the view from her camp of
this mess is that it is entirely linked to a relationship with
President Clinton that she says was sexual. Period.
</P>
<P>
   From her camp's perspective, it is obvious that she has no
control of her time. However, it is just as obvious what outcome
would be in her best interests:an appearance before Kenneth Starr's
grand jury, and then nothing _ no melodramatic appearance before
the nation and a House committee holding impeachment hearings, no
testimony at the trials of anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   If you put together all (and it's admittedly not a great deal)
that the Lewinsky camp has offered since her pursuit of total
immunity succeeded, an interesting picture emerges that is
consistent with her goal and needs.
</P>
<P>
   She says directly that the relationship with the president was
sexual. To belabor the obvious, this is where her dress matters,
though why it matters is usually not made clear beyond the equally
obvious fact that what we are calling ``DNA evidence'' might be
dispositive.
</P>
<P>
   From her point of view, the dress matters so much because
without it she has left a bewildering trail of conflicting
statements to others and to Tripp's tape recorder about the
relationship. It is now apparent that what really stretched all
this out since last January was not court fights over privilege
issues; it was Starr, trying to make a circumstantial case by
methodically trying _ and failing _ to corroboborate virtually
every syllable on Tripp's tapes in the absence of Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Also from her corner, there is more than the dress; there are
also those gifts she sent back to the White House last winter. She
and Clinton's private secretary, Betty Currie, as well as the
president remain to be heard from about that.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond sex and the precise circumstances of the returned gifts,
however, Lewinsky's pre-testimony offerings are all squishy about
her version of conversations with the president; there is said to
be much about suggestions and nothing in her own words alleging
direct instructions or requests to lie or actual coaching in
advance of her sworn statement or her then-impending deposition in
the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a few high-profile matters, Lewinsky's pre-grand
jury tidbits are explicitly exculpatory. She really does say, for
example, that she typed the celebrated ``talking points'' herself,
based in part on chats with Tripp. In contrast to the Tripp camp's
non-denial denial, she doesn't attempt to tie Tripp to the
``talking points'' per se but instead to some of the information
and thoughts in them.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky not only says that the White House and Clinton
retainers had nothing to do with the talking points, she also said
that nothing about her search for a job was related to her
forthcoming testimony by anyone who helped her. More to the point,
she says that prominent lawyer and Clinton friend Vernon Jordan
helped her get both the job and her first lawyer (Frank Carter) for
no other, ulterior purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The deeper significance of all this is that from the briefings
of reporters by Starr's office last January as well as Newsweek,
Lewinsky said quite the opposite while she was being bugged. In
other words, in at least one instance (there are others), she is
prepared to say that things said on those tapes are not true.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is why you hear criticism of the immunity deal from
the most zealous of the Clinton-did-it crowd, that Starr settled
for essentially what he was offered in January and lost critical
leverage to press his subornation and obstruction case.
</P>
<P>
   And regarding the dress, some of them, including Linda Tripp's
circle, worry that it was a set-up.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind that point of view is a realization that leading
Republicans in the House _ symbolized by chairman Henry Hyde of the
Judiciary Committee _ are not willing to press a sex-based case to
impeachment. It's clearcut obstruction or subornation _ or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's a sex-based case that Lewinsky is offering. Her
hope is that she can get her life back after testifying to the
grand jury and after the president gives his own testimony and
accounting to the public.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what more than two-thirds of the country is saying
in polls that it wants. So to the extent that she wants to tell her
story once as prelude to Clinton, and to the extent that she hopes
that is the end of it, she is indeed representing the rest of us,
whether we believe her or not.

   ``You been to the casinos?''

   ``Three hundred at the Grand,'' Bud said. ``In an hour. I

   GULFPORT, Miss. _ In the years since Frederick Barthelme took
over the creative writing program at the University of Southern
Mississippi in 1977, he has developed a fictional genre depicting
life along the state's Gulf Coast, a stretch of fast-food joints,
honky-tonks, run-down resort hotels and styleless bungalows peopled
with drifters yearning to put down roots in a place throbbing to a
funky beat.
</P>
<P>
   The coast began to change in 1992 after Mississippi moved to
legalize gambling and a strand of glitzy casinos grew up on the
beach. Barthelme's milieu changed, too, and his characters began to
be subjected to new temptations in gambling parlors as full of the
damned as one of Dante's circles of hell.
</P>
<P>
   This fall, Barthelme's world is expected to take on a
stranger-than-fiction dimension when he and his brother, Steven
Barthelme, are scheduled to stand trial here on charges that they
conspired with a blackjack dealer to beat the house at the Grand
Casino-Gulfport.
</P>
<P>
   It is a case where life truly imitates art, and which lay
dormant and virtually unnoticed in the files of the Harrison County
district attorney's office for nearly two years until the first
news reports this spring created quite a buzz in literary circles.
</P>
<P>
   The Barthelmes are members of an extraordinary family of writers
that included their older brother, Donald, a leading figure in a
school of odd, fey fiction that included John Barth, Thomas
Pynchon, William Gass and Robert Coover. He died in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   According to Mary Robison, a faculty colleague and well-known
novelist who frequently gambled with them, the Barthelme brothers
were ``rousted'' by casino agents one night in November, 1996. The
dealer, Cynthia Wojciechowski, a mother in her 30s from nearby Long
Beach, was arrested. The Barthelme brothers were merely banned from
the two casinos Grand operates in Gulfport and Biloxi, and the case
lay in limbo until they were quietly indicted nearly a year later.
</P>
<P>
   They face a maximum sentence of two years imprisonment if
convicted. Under the state's gaming control act, the trio are
accused of ``acquiring knowledge, not available to all players, of
the outcome of blackjack games.'' The dealer has been charged with
signaling to the Barthelmes when she had a blackjack, prompting
them to place ``insurance'' bets.
</P>
<P>
   At the outset of every hand in the game, each player is dealt
two cards face-up; they must subsequently decide whether to draw
additional cards _ up to a collective count of 21 _ to try to
exceed the dealer's total. The dealer also takes two cards, one up
and one down. If the dealer has an ace showing, players are given
an opportunity to make a side bet that pays off if the dealer has a
face card or a 10-card in the hole, creating blackjack and
automatic victory.
</P>
<P>
   Seasoned gamblers say ``insurance'' is a chump bet where the
possibility of a payoff is poorer than a regular hand of blackjack.
</P>
<P>
   The Barthelmes' attorney, Tim Holleman, calls the charges
``ridiculous'' and adds, ``If this was a so-called scheme, it was
not a very good one.'' The brothers lost several thousand dollars
during the two nights at the Grand named in the indictment, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   Chuck Patton, executive director of the Mississippi Gaming
Commission, said the Barthelme case is one of 95 gambling
prosecutions undertaken by state during the past year. In response
to a question about the delay in prosecution, Patton said, ``Our
people don't know why the district attorney waited to indict
them.''
</P>
<P>
   The district attorney's office did not respond to several
inquiries by the Globe about the case.
</P>
<P>
   According to Robison, Frederick, who is known as Rick, and
Steven, who also teaches at the Center for Writing at the
university, have lost about $150,000 at the Gulf Coast gambling
tables since the death of their parents earlier in the decade.
Holleman confirmed the figure.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Barthelme's latest novel, ``Bob the Gambler,'' was a work
in progress when the incident took place at the Grand. It was
published late last year, and won favorable notices.
</P>
<P>
   There is no cheating scheme in the book's plot, but the
narrative of a gambling addict paints a vivid picture of the casino
culture, where bettors befriend dealers and dealers display
sympathy when players fall into losing streaks.
</P>
<P>
   In one passage of ``Bob the Gambler,'' the protagonist drops
$20,000 during a 40-minute period at a blackjack table where a
woman named Lisette is the dealer:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(itals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``My largest bet was an eight-inch stack of hundred-dollar
chips, four thousand, and I watched it walk. Lisette was doing
everything she could to help me. Several times she ditched the deck
because the cards were coming out bad. Once she went through a
special shuffle she said ought to turn the cards around. She almost
never let me take insurance, closing it fast so I wouldn't waver
and take it when it was a bad bet. Still, I lost everything I
looked at.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
(unitals) &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Although the casino is called the ``Paradise'' in the book, the
description fits the Grand, where shrimp boats are tied to an
adjacent pier and Gulf waters lap at the side of the gambling hall.
</P>
<P>
   Robison, who has had many short stories published in The New
Yorker and is also a member of the Center for Writers faculty,
often accompanied the Barthelmes on the 75-mile drive from
Hattiesburg, the home of the university, to the coast casinos. She
said it was not unusual for the brothers to strike up friendships
with several of the women dealers.
</P>
<P>
   On one occasion, she recalled, Rick Barthelme delivered
cheesecake from the casino buffet to Wojchiechowski as a friendly
gesture. ``It wasn't any kind of boyfriend-girlfriend flirtation,''
she said. ``It was just their style. They like to make women feel
pretty.''
</P>
<P>
   Steve is married; Rick has a steady woman companion, Robison
said.
</P>
<P>
   The Barthelmes were drawn to Mississippi from Texas, where their
father was a professor of architecture at the University of
Houston.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Barthelme, who also edits a literary magazine, the
Mississippi Review, was called upon to help build the academic
standing of a state school best known for its football teams.
Although he arrived as a published author, his reputation was
linked to his brother, Donald, whose daring novel, ``Snow White,''
took up nearly an entire issue of The New Yorker in 1967. Donald's
collection, ``Sixty Stories,'' won the PEN/Faulkner Award for
fiction in 1982.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Barthelme, 55, now has nine books in print himself. After
his novel, ``The Brothers,'' was published in 1993, The New York
Times literary critic Michiko Kakutani wrote that ``Barthelme has
managed to reinvest highly familiar material with new vigor and
insight.''
</P>
<P>
   Forty-six-year-old Steven Barthelme, who joined his brother at
the Mississippi school in 1986, is the author of a short-story
collection, ``And He Tells the Little Horse the Whole Story.''
</P>
<P>
   Holleman, the defense attorney, says ``the professors deny all
the charges.'' Wojchiechowski, he says, has been accused of
``peeking at her hole card to see if they should buy insurance,''
but he scoffs at the charge.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecution has produced videotapes of about 50 blackjack
hands involving the Barthelmes from the casino's surveillance
apparatus. A few show the dealer fingering the cards, Holleman
said. ``There's no question she's a sloppy dealer. But this girl
didn't deal blackjack normally. Her primary job was craps.''
</P>
<P>
   Like many Gulf Coast residents who sought employment at the
casinos after they were established a few years ago, Wojchiechowski
had no experience as a dealer before she was trained in Biloxi.
</P>
<P>
   Holleman complained that the district attorney's office relied
on only a few tapes from more than 3,000 hands dealt to the
Barthelmes under the eye of closed-circuit television. After the
defense subpoenaed all of the tapes this spring, the state
responded with a motion to quash the supoenas. An agreement has
been worked out, he said, which will enable the defense to review
other tapes. After the first indictments, handed up last September,
proved faulty the Barthelmes and Wojchiechowski were re-indicted in
June. The trial has tentatively been set for October.
</P>
<P>
   Noting the delays by the prosecution, Holleman said, ``I don't
believe they have a very good case.''

TOBACCO NEGOTIATIONS ARE A TIGHTROPE FOR HARSHBARGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK PHILLIPS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ By any calculation, the massive lawsuit brought by
Massachusetts against the giants of the tobacco industry could
provide Attorney General Scott Harshbarger an explosive issue in
the middle of his campaign for governor.
</P>
<P>
   Massachusetts' lawsuit, which could gain billions of dollars for
state taxpayers from an out-of-court settlement, is the next
crossroads in the national campaign against the cigarette
companies. For the country's antitobacco movement, the outcome is
critical. For Harshbarger and the state, the resolution of legal
action could have huge consequences.
</P>
<P>
   But with all the political advantages it could hold for
Harshbarger, a settlement _ which could emerge shortly from
negotiations scheduled to resume today _ also could pose serious
political pitfalls.
</P>
<P>
   The case to recover smoking-related health-care costs isn't
scheduled for trial until early next year. But Harshbarger's
efforts to win an out-of-court settlement could give him the
opportunity before the election to boast of a multibillion-dollar
windfall for taxpayers.
</P>
<P>
   Already, some tobacco-control advocates are privately concerned
that Harshbarger will be so eager to use the issue to advance his
candidacy that he will sacrifice concessions they hope to win from
the tobacco firms during pretrial negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's clearly a strong desire to bring home the bacon before
the elections,'' said an observer who is closely monitoring the
settlement talks.
</P>
<P>
   The national settlement that was struck last year but died later
in Congress would have earned the state at least $7.3 billion over
25 years.
</P>
<P>
   According to those following the talks between the industry and
attorneys general in New York last week, Harshbarger has emerged as
the most important player in the negotiations because the
Massachusetts case is the next major one scheduled for trial. It is
also the one the industry fears most, according to industry
analysts..
</P>
<P>
   The case is before Middlesex Superior Court Judge Martha B.
Sosman, who has made rulings favorable to the state in tobacco
issues. It is being heard in a county with a potential jury pool
made up largely of well-educated, upscale residents who have been
inundated with the state's most recent television ad blitz
attacking the cigarette makers.
</P>
<P>
   The potential amount of damages could create a major financial
disruption in the industry. Harshbarger's lawyers are asking for $2
billion in damages and, under consumer protection laws that apply
to the case, a successful plaintiff is entitled to triple damages,
or $6 billion. That doesn't include penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``Scott Harshbarger now represents the most serious threat to
the industry,'' said Matthew Myers, executive vice president and
general counsel for the National Center for Tobacco-Free Kids, who
is monitoring the latest round of talks in New York. Two
Harshbarger aides have been attending the sessions.
</P>
<P>
   But for Harshbarger the stakes are also high personally. He
faces a difficult balancing act. Settling out of court in a splash
would obviously advance his political ambitions at the most crucial
time and give him a huge boost in his gubernatorial bid. But he is
also facing anxious public-health activists who are looking to him
to bring home, not just the money, but also concessions that would
radically alter the tobacco industry's sales practices. Up for
discussion are more limits on billboard and magazine advertising,
merchandise tie-ins and other restrictions.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a candidate, he has the opportunity to bring about a result
that will put a lot of money into the state coffers and bring about
some fundamental change in marketing and advertising,'' Myers said.
``As the attorney general, with a strong case, he has the
opportunity to use the threat of his litigation to bring about the
most fundamental change in tobacco advertising and marketing that
this nation has ever seen.''
</P>
<P>
   Harshbarger's gubernatorial opponents have already put him on
the hot seat for his involvement in the tobacco cases, and Acting
Governor Paul Cellucci has criticized an agreement the attorney
general approved giving five law firms up to 25 percent of the
value of any future settlement won for the state. Cellucci called
those fees, which could total almost $2 billion, ``obscene'' and
said the figure should be about 1 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Former state Senator Patricia McGovern, who is also running for
governor, said earlier this year that Harshbarger conceded too much
when he signed off on the proposed national tobacco settlement.
</P>
<P>
   Aides this week said Harshbarger would not be interviewed on the
tobacco litigation issue. But press secretary Ed Cafasso strongly
denied that the attorney general's political agenda would play any
role in his negotiations.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are going to do what we have done in the past five years on
this issue: continue to act in the best interest of children, the
public health, and the taxpayers. Period,'' Cafasso said.
</P>
<P>
   Cafasso scoffed at the idea that Harshbarger would be tempted to
cut corners in a settlement in order to boost his immediate
political fortunes.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any settlement that is done for purely political reasons will
be seen for what it is: a hollow victory,'' he said. ``What (the
attorney general) is focused on is doing what is right.''
</P>
<P>
   Others who are closely following the settlement talks agree that
it is unlikely Harshbarger would put his political ambitions ahead
of the case.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think, however much he might be tempted, that as a
practical matter he would agree to anything that doesn't have the
wholehearted support of the tobacco-control community in
Massachusetts, '' said one source. ``He knows he has to stand
firm.''

NEW `HALLOWEEN' IS MEDIOCRE BUT RELATIVELY HARMLESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By WILLIAM ARNOLD  
 c.1998 Seattle Post-Intelligencer  
<TEXT>
<P>
   With young audiences once again lining up to see '80s-style
splatter-horror movies (``Scream''), it was inevitable Hollywood
would sooner or later get around to making a slightly
higher-profile installment of the series based on the film that
started it all 20 years ago _ 1978's ``Halloween.''
</P>
<P>
   The result, ``Halloween: H20'' (a subtitle which refers to the
series two-decades of service, not water), is a mediocre but
relatively harmless little shocker that should have a certain
nostalgic appeal to those who grew up with the films.
</P>
<P>
   It opens with an extended teaser in which the series'
unflappable serial murderer, Michael Myers, emerges from wherever
he hides between episodes to murder, for no obvious reason, the
nurse of his late psychiatrist, Dr. Sam Loomis, as well as
seemingly half her neighborhood.
</P>
<P>
   Cut to a posh, secluded private high school in Northern
California, where the killer's sister and prime target in the first
two installments of ``Halloween,'' Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee
Curtis), is now headmistress _ living under an assumed name, having
faked her own death in a car accident some years before.
</P>
<P>
   But she's never gotten over her trauma and, since this is
Halloween night 1998, she's a total wreck, absolutely sure her
homicidal brother, who supposedly burned up in a fire, is alive and
somehow is going to return from the grave to harm her. He doesn't
disappoint.
</P>
<P>
   With the rest of the students and staff on a field trip to
Yosemite, Laurie finds herself in the mostly deserted school with
her boyfriend (Adam Arkin), an incompetent security guard (LL Cool
J), her 17-year-old son (Josh Harnett) and three of his friends.
Then the phones go dead and ... well, you've been here before.
</P>
<P>
   In the context of the series, this seventh installment is
probably one of the least brutal and explicit _ not nearly as gory
and violent as, say, the series' nadir, the 1983 ``Halloween III:
Season of the Witch.'' The teen sex and drugs-and-alcohol-are-cool
references _ always an unpleasant feature of the ``Halloween''
films _ are also noticeably toned down.
</P>
<P>
   With the 1995 death of Donald Pleasence _ the link in the series
_ the film's nostalgic appeal definitely benefits from the presence
of Jamie Lee Curtis, whose appearances in I and II have made her
something of a splatter-movie icon. (And speaking of icons, her
mother, Janet Leigh, is also around for a brief cameo that reminds
us that 1960's ``Psycho'' was the real inspiration of the splatter
movie cycle.)
</P>
<P>
   Still, for its all its restraint and nostalgic appeal, this
``Halloween'' is underwhelming. And at least part of the reason is
a script (by Robert Zappia and Matt Greenberg) and direction (by
``Friday the 13th''-series veteran Steve Miner) that overdo the
teasing, false shocks to such an annoying extent that by the time
the film gets around to the real action, the audience has run out
of squeal.
</P>
<P>
   Halloween: H20. Directed by Steve Miner. Screenplay by Robert
Zappia and Matt Greenberg. Cast: Jamie Lee Curtis, Adam Arkin,
Janet Leigh, LL Cool J, Josh Harnett, Joseph Gordon-Levitt.
Miramax/Dimension. 82 minutes. Rated R for violence.

MAXIMUM NUTTY FROM `MAXIMUM BOB' 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MATTHEW GILBERT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
MAXIMUM BOB 
Starring: Beau Bridges, Kiersten Warren, Liz Vassey, Sam Robards,
Sam Trammell 
On: ABC, Ch.5 
Rated: TV14  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   It's not too much of a stretch to place ``Maximum Bob,'' a
promising seven-week summer series, in the same category as ``Twin
Peaks'' and ``Northern Exposure.'' The show, based on the novel by
Elmore Leonard, brings us some of the nuttiest backwoods characters
since Sheriff Harry S. Truman and Agent Dale Cooper looked into the
murder of Laura Palmer.
</P>
<P>
   An incest-ridden family wearing identical black-framed glasses,
the ghost of a slave girl, a channeling palm reader who sees auras,
and a bulletproof alligator are but a few of the strange presences
in Deep Water, Fla., where you might easily find yourself in a
traffic jam behind the funeral of a giant, or interrupting the
sheriff during his rehearsal for the state ballroom-dancing
championship. That exploding basketball? Don't ask.
</P>
<P>
   The premiere Tuesday was directed by Barry Sonnenfeld, who is
the series's executive producer. With ``Get Shorty'' in 1995,
Sonnenfeld distinguished himself as one of Leonard's best
big-screen adapters. With ``Maximum Bob'' he proves adept at
expanding Leonard's idiosyncratic people into characters faced with
new situations each week.
</P>
<P>
   He begins the series with a masterful sequence that's set
literally in deep water, as a group of awed onlookers watch a
troupe of underwater dancers in mermaid outfits at the bottom of a
huge aquarium. Through a series of dynamic camera angles, we see
one dancer drink a bottle of soda 16 feet under, and then another
prepare to eat a banana, and then the looming black shape of a
large alligator who has found his way into the wrong tank. It is
immediately clear that Sonnenfeld, whose began his career as a
cinematographer for the Coen Brothers, is having a good old time.
</P>
<P>
   The chief wacko on the show is Bob Gibbs, a judge who makes
extreme rulings according to whim and abuses his power whenever he
can _ particularly with women other than his wife. Dubbed Maximum
Bob by Newsweek, he's a brash performer on the bench who delivers
lines like ``Counselor, you've got a cute butt.'' In tonight's
episode, Bob examines the teeth of a kid who broke his parole,
noting ``Crime is in the chromosomes'' before sentencing him to the
electric chair. (``Ally McBeal,'' another hourlong comedy filled
with loonies, also has a teeth-watching judge.)
</P>
<P>
   As Bob, Beau Bridges relishes his character's bold
insensitivity, throwing his whole body into his performance but
restraining himself from making Bob's corrupt nature too grating.
His sheer badness is also compensated by two good-guy characters,
the town's new public defender, played by Liz Vassey, and the
dancing sheriff, played by Sam Robards (son of Jason Robards and
Lauren Bacall). Their attraction to each other is clear, and could
easily go somewhere as the series progresses.
</P>
<P>
   The plots on ``Maximum Bob'' are carefully developed, so that
seemingly incidental details often prove to be important. But the
show doesn't take its mysteries very seriously, going instead for a
playful tone that emphasizes the characters and a nicely stylized
atmosphere that's energized with vivid colors and imaginative
camera work. The dialogue is filled with tart language and amusing
one-liners, and there's an inside joke or two, as when, next week,
a pair of laconic agents wearing Ray Bans show up in a plot about
smuggled cigars, Bob's ex-wife, and a dancing instructor.
Sonnenfeld, you may recall, also directed last summer's
blockbuster, ``Men in Black.''

 AMHERST, N.H.: ... of substance.  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I really don't miss the nature of the press coverage of sports
in Boston,'' he said. ``It at times can get extremely personal and
I don't miss that at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if he wanted to expound on that, Sullivan said, ``That's
all I'm saying.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Point of no return
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   According to Sullivan, he had two chances to get back into
football, one with Barcelona in the World League and another with
the Raiders.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had some discussions with Al Davis _ of all people,'' said
Sullivan, chuckling at the idea of working for the Raiders owner.
``We talked about me going to work for them.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the humor in a potential Sullivan-Davis alliance would
be that the two sides, the Patriots and Raiders, were great rivals
since their AFL days. The rivalry hit a crescendo in January '86
when the Patriots rubbed out the Raiders on the way to their first
Super Bowl. Sullivan was on the field for the closing moments in LA
that day, Jan. 5, and got into a scuffle with the Raiders' Matt
Millen and Howie Long. The crowning blow was Millen using his
helmet to bop Sullivan on the head.
</P>
<P>
   It was a vague but good-natured Sullivan who appeared on WBZ-TV
(Channel 4) in Boston for a live interview after the game. However,
in a taped interview during Channel 4's 11 p.m. sports segment that
night, an angry Sullivan called the Globe's Will McDonough a
``stooge'' for Davis. ``They both can drop dead,'' said Sullivan. A
little more than five years later, Davis was talking to Sullivan
about a job.
</P>
<P>
   ``Al's notorious for picking peoples' brains,'' said Sullivan.
``Originally, that's all I thought it was, just a brain-picking
thing. But when I saw him at Joe Alioto's funeral, he said, `You
know, I wanted you to come work with me, but I didn't think you'd
move to the West Coast.' I was with my 15-year-old (Garrett), and
when he heard it, wow, he was ready to move on the spot.''
</P>
<P>
   More intriguing was the offer to be GM in Barcelona, where
Sullivan would have worked with former Boston College coach Jack
Bicknell. But Sullivan said he turned down the offer because it
would have meant living in Barcelona for a year and transplanting
his wife, Lynne, and their three boys, Garrett and 11-year-old
twins Terrance and Kyle.
</P>
<P>
   The only way he would get back in the game now, said Sullivan,
would be if he owned an NFL team. ``No partners,'' he said. But
with franchises being valued at about a half-billion dollars, there
may be only a dozen entrepreneurs in the world with enough cash to
buy into corporate smashmouth. Sullivan isn't one.
</P>
<P>
   ``No,'' he said. ``And I don't have a burning desire to do it,
either. Remember, I left in January of '91, so I've been out a long
time. I don't know what I'd add to the party.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Wheels are spinning
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   For now, his game is trucks, big 16-wheelers stocked
chock-a-block with enough monitors and wired gadgetry to make a
Circuit City salesman envious.
</P>
<P>
   Fully equipped trucks, said Sullivan, cost upwards of $7
million. The advent of digital TV easily will pop that figure over
$10 million. Game Creek is one of only eight production companies
in the country with more than two production trucks, said Sullivan,
and the demand only seems to be growing. Depending on a number of
variables, such as the event, the complexity of the broadcast, and
a client's return business _ or lack thereof _ a video production
company might charge as little as $4,500 a day for truck, or as
much as $25,000 a day.
</P>
<P>
   ``We set our own table here,'' said Sullivan, whose outfit
currently uses 7,000 square feet of office and warehouse space, and
stands ready to expand to 13,000 square feet. ``And I live with the
mistakes we make. I like that. I live with the judgments, and I
don't have to live with the judgments of other people.''
</P>
<P>
   Picking the company name was a family decision. All five
Sullivans sat down at the family home in Newton and tossed around
ideas. Someone suggested ``Sullivan Video.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Imagine, our name on big trucks,'' said Sullivan. ``Yuck.
Finally, I said, `Let's think of the nicest place we've been
together.' We thought about Cotuit, Mass. for a while, because we
have a summer house there. But finally we picked `Game Creek.' A
few years ago, we went to ski in Vail (Colo.), and there's a place
there, Game Creek Bowl, that's just this beautiful, isolated spot.
And that was it, Game Creek. We bought the trucks and began in
'93.''
</P>
<P>
   How long does he intend to stick with this venture?
</P>
<P>
   ``About every six months, one of the big companies offers to buy
us out,'' said Sullivan. ``And my answer's always the same _ when
we stop making money, or we stop having fun, I might be interested.
But that's not the case _ not now.''

VALDERAMMA DEAL NOW APPEARS DEAD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Carlos Valderrama used to play a great game and he still talks a
good game. But the trade discussions that heated up less than a
week after he walked out of a Miami Fusion practice appear to have
ended.
</P>
<P>
   Valderrama has been ordered to report to training with the
Fusion today, though he has little interest in making peace with
coach Ivo Wortmann. And the Revolution have given up pursuing
Valderrama.
</P>
<P>
   ``The deal is dead,'' Revolution general manager Brian O'Donovan
said Monday. ``Carlos just didn't want to come north and a lot of
it had to do with family considerations. But that was just one
direction we have been exploring. We feel we can still do something
and we have five or six teams we are involved with.''
</P>
<P>
   Valderrama seemed enthusiastic about rejoining Revolution coach
Thomas Rongen, who he had worked with successfully in Tampa Bay two
years ago. He even said he would enjoy the New England climate,
pointing out he had been skiing while playing for Montpellier in
France.
</P>
<P>
   But two factors weighed against Valderrama joining the
Revolution:
</P>
<P>
   _ the Revolution's last-place standing;
</P>
<P>
   _ his family's affection for Florida, and the state's proximity
to Colombia.
</P>
<P>
   Valderrama, 36, had been viewed as a high-profile solution to
the Revolution's problems. Rongen believed Valderrama not only
could vault the Revolution into the playoffs, but also could be a
strong factor for at least two more MLS seasons.
</P>
<P>
   But Valderrama began having second thoughts during the MLS'
All-Star weekend in Orlando. His wife, Claribeth, and three
children felt comfortable in a climate similar to what they were
accustomed to in Colombia. They had developed social relationships.
They planned to spend two extra days at the Disney World complex.
And when they want to return home, they simply board a 3-hour
flight to Barranquilla.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the trade _ Valderrama and a domestic player for Joe-Max
Moore and a Revolution foreigner _ had succeeded, the Revolution
would not have solved their defensive problems. The team is in a
crisis situation, winless at home since May 10 entering tomorrow's
game against San Jose. They will require a dramatic turnaround to
gain momentum for a playoff run.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
US has long way to go
</P>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Many critics within the US Soccer Federation system believe the
US will not win the World Cup with a foreign coach. The reality is
that the US might never win the World Cup, no matter who the coach
is.
</P>
<P>
   The US still has far to go in international soccer. A last-place
finish at France '98 should lend perspective to the national team's
self-assessment. The realistic goal should be to develop the
quality of the game at all levels. A foreign coach could help point
the program in the right direction. Certainly, Carlos Queiroz could
have done so.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently, Bruce Arena is not being seriously considered as
Steve Sampson's replacement. Outgoing USSF president Alan
Rothenberg could be leaning toward Bora Milutinovic _ some believe
the decision already has been made.
</P>
<P>
   The perception will be that re-hiring Milutinovic does not move
the program ahead. But it is debatable whether Milutinovic should
be considered a foreigner. He has lived in the US since 1991 and
seems to understand the mentality of the players. The time frame of
his US experience is not very different from that of most of the
players he will be developing for the 2002 and 2006 World Cups,
since most of them would not have become aware of soccer at any
level until the mid-1980s or later.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, a decision should be announced soon. The US hopes
to play Australia in an exhibition in Florida in September. And
International Management Group officials are considering a
day-before-the-Super Bowl match in Miami in January. Though most of
the top nations will be unavailable, they might consider bringing
in Jamaica, or a Caribbean All-Star team.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
Gaffe on Graff
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The MLS has made a considerable profit on Sean Bartlett, the
South African striker who has been loaned to Capetown Spurs and
sold to FC Zurich in Switzerland for $1.1 million. Curiously,
Bartlett's place at Spurs will be taken by Todd Graff, a speedy
striker from Pittsburgh. Graff has played for Sao Cristoval in
Brazil's second division and in Iceland and Poland. The MLS
probably erred in passing up Graff, though Tampa Bay coach John
Kowalski considered signing him for this season. Graff is 5 feet 9
inches, runs the 40-yard dash in 4.4 seconds, and apparently has
excellent goal-scoring instincts ... France will play its first
game under new coach, former assistant Roger Lemerre, against
Austria in Vienna Aug. 19. Then comes European Championship 2000
qualifying, starting Sept. 5. But Lemerre's most difficult early
test could come in the Confederation Cup, scheduled Jan. 7-22, 1999
in Mexico. France could face a rematch with World Cup finalist
Brazil, but under completely different circumstances than last
month in Saint-Denis. Bolivia, Egypt, Mexico, and the US are also
entered in the event. Brazil plans to name a coach, likely
Wanderley Luxemburgo, by next month. Bolivia had hoped to sign
Milutinovic. Michael Owen has retained his World Cup form for
Liverpool. Owen and Czech Republic midfielder Patrik Berger scored
early in the second half as the Reds took a 2-0 victory over Leeds
in a preseason Carlsburg Cup tournament in Dublin. Liverpool hopes
to take out a $100 million insurance policy on Owen.

DIFFICULT JOURNEY OF DANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEPHEN KIEHL  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ Opera music blasted from James Mills's dorm room at
Emerson College. And Rider Vierling was thrilled to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   Vierling, who is 17, doesn't have too many friends who enjoy
opera like he does. So when he heard what Mills had on his CD
player, he rushed in. The two talked tenors for an hour.
</P>
<P>
   Mills and Vierling share a common bond forged in the crucible of
youthful cruelty. It opened them to the worlds of opera and other
fine arts, and led them to Boston for a summer of ballet.
</P>
<P>
   The two teens committed themselves to dance at an age when doing
so meant social suicide. While their friends were on the baseball
field or hanging out at the mall, they were rehearsing in a studio.
While their friends snapped up Beastie Boys albums, they bought
Tchaikovsky.
</P>
<P>
   There are 37 boys and 250 girls in the Boston Ballet Summer
Program, an intensive six-week workshop for the top young dancers
in the nation. Both boys and girls have sacrificed so much _
football games, social events, travel, and, in some cases, &UR;  &LR; college
_ to pursue a cutthroat career that can be ended by a single
injury.
</P>
<P>
   But it is the boys who, most believe, made a more difficult
journey. They were not gently guided into ballet, as their female
counterparts were. They had to find it on their own, and then find
the courage to stick with it.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had no idea how tough it is,'' Vierling said of his
tormentors. ``Guys who got cut from the JV football team made fun
of me for being a dancer. They would say stuff like `Dance for me.'
And I'd do a pirouette with my tennis shoes on. And they'd try to
do it and fall on their ass.''
</P>
<P>
   Vierling, Mills, and other young men in the program say junior
high was the worst, when they were taunted mercilessly, usually
about their masculinity. They avoided fights, but they also felt
cut off from their peers. In high school, many of them went to
schools for the arts to focus more intensively on ballet. Getting
away from the taunts was a relief, too.
</P>
<P>
   Their journey has led them to 19 Clarendon St., where in the
Boston Ballet's seven modern studios with red marly floors (for
just the right amount of traction), floor-to-ceiling mirrors, and
huge windows with spectacular city views, they will find out if
they have the stuff to be a professional dancer.
</P>
<P>
   Most do not.
</P>
<P>
   For the few who do, the road ahead is a constant struggle to
keep jobs, stay fit, and avoid injury.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, Mills, 18, of Charlotte, N.C., discovered that he
has what it takes. After countless auditions for professional
companies last winter, and no bites, he suddenly found himself
juggling three offers _ from the Hartford Ballet, the Charleston
Ballet, and Boston Ballet II, the company's equivalent of a farm
team. He accepted the BBII contract for the chance to move up to
the full company in a year or two.
</P>
<P>
   Mills received his high school diploma this year from the North
Carolina School for the Arts, and is skipping college to pursue
dance.
</P>
<P>
   When he first told his parents he wanted to take ballet lessons
five years ago, after having pursued baseball, soccer, and
gymnastics, they had their doubts. They told him, ``We don't think
you're going to like ballet,'' Mills recalled. ``People look down
on ballet dancers. So if you really want to do it, you'll have to
pay for it.''
</P>
<P>
   Mills scraped together the money for the first few classes.
Once &UR;  &LR; his parents saw his commitment, they picked up the tab.
</P>
<P>
   ``I couldn't go out with my friends as much, and they got mad at
me at first,'' he said. ``Then, after my best friend saw me dance
in a performance, he said, `Thank you for not going out with us and
working.' And that was great.''
</P>
<P>
   Anecdotal evidence indicates that more people, like Mills's best
friend, are realizing that ballet is not just for girls. More
parents are enrolling their sons in ballet classes, and the number
of classes offered exclusively for boys has increased recently in
the Boston area, say Boston Ballet instructors.
</P>
<P>
   And last year, just five of the 21 Party Boys in the Boston
Ballet's production of ``The Nutcracker'' were played by girls, a
significant reduction from previous years when most of the Party
Boys were girls.
</P>
<P>
   Vierling, who is from Orlando, Fla., says attitudes about male
ballet dancers are slowly changing. He gives an example of his
cabdriver from Logan International Airport to Emerson, where all
the students in the program live for the summer. The cabbie thought
it was just great that Vierling was a dancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are people like that,'' he said, ``and then there are
people like `You're a dancer? Get out of here, don't even talk to
me.' And that's frustrating.''
</P>
<P>
   Though some of the young men in the Boston Ballet Summer Program
say they had moments of uncertainty, they have also had perfect
moments when they knew without question that dancing was their
future.
</P>
<P>
   For Vierling, that moment came when he was 9 or 10 years old in
a performance of ``The Nutcracker'' with the Southern Ballet
Theater.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was on stage and it just hit me that it was absolutely magic
what was going on, what I was a part of,'' he said. ``There was
some little kid out there in the audience who was in love with all
of it, and I just knew that this was what I wanted to do.''

<P>
   ROWE, Mass. _ We form a circle and one after another step into
the center, pick up a brightly colored ceremonial ``talking
stick,'' and try to articulate wisdom acquired over lifetimes of
from 47 to 77 years. When finished, each speaker solemnly intones,
``I have spoken,'' and the others, emulating the practice of Native
American tribal councils, rhythmically chant ``Ho!'' in response.
</P>
<P>
   An exercise in self-affirmation, this ``council of elders'' is
the culmination of a three-day ``Spiritual Eldering'' workshop held
recently at the Rowe Conference Center. It might appear a bit comic
to anyone outside the circle, but for those taking part, the
experience is energizing and strengthening. Also, in a
psychological sense, rejuvenating.
</P>
<P>
   The Spiritual Eldering movement, which sponsors lectures,
workshops, and seminars around the country, was founded a decade
ago in Philadelphia. Founder Rabbi Zalman Shachter-Shalomi, a
theology teacher and spiritual gadfly, based it on methods he used
to overcome his own age-related despair, brought on by his 60th
birthday. Now 73, Shachter-Shalomi is a professor of ``world
wisdom'' at the Naropa Institute, a New Age center in Boulder,
Colo.
</P>
<P>
   The nondenominational movement uses an eclectic mix of spiritual
and consciousness-raising techniques _ drawn from the psychology of
Erik Erikson and Carl Jung and belief systems as disparate as
shamanism, Buddhism, Hasidic Judaism, and medieval Christianity _
to get men and women from midlife on to rethink their lives and
cultivate a dynamic, positive, and socially responsible attitude
toward the aging process. That is, to reject the common image of an
older person as a passive, dependent, and unproductive member of
society and instead become what many cultures have called sages:
vital and engaged elders who are valued _ and enormously useful _
because of their accumulated wisdom, rich experience, and informed
compassion. The rabbi sums up his vision of the ideal way to grow
older as ``going from age-ing to sage-ing.''
</P>
<P>
   The 18 workshop participants assemble for the first time at
dinner on a midweek night. Dinner is served in an old farmhouse on
the grounds of the conference center, which is affiliated with the
Unitarian-Universalist Association. Before sitting down to eat,
diners join hands and sing ``Simple Gifts,'' the beautiful hymn
about getting rid of life's useless baggage.
</P>
<P>
   After the meal, we walk down a tree-lined country road and past
meadows speckled with wildflowers to the meeting hall where our
sessions will take place. The workshop codirectors are Steffi
Shapiro, 63, of Newton and Elizabeth David, 62, of Sudbury. Both
have been trained at the Spiritual Eldering Institute in
Philadelphia and Shapiro runs the Well Street Station, a yoga and
holistic center in Watertown that is the institute affiliate in the
Boston area. &QL; 
 &QL; 
`A time of harvesting'
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Shapiro and David introduce themselves and ask us to tell where
we are from and how many years of ``life experience'' we have
accumulated. Most of the group are from New England, but there is a
couple from Nova Scotia and a woman from California. Participants
include five men and two married couples as well as a mother and
daughter and father and daughter.
</P>
<P>
   ``Old age should be a time of harvesting,'' says David, after
introductions are over, ``and a time for tying up loose ends.'' One
of the ways to do this, explains Shapiro, is the Spiritual Eldering
technique called ``socialized meditation,'' which involves
identifying unresolved life situations and issues and discussing
them frankly with others. During the workshop, this usually turns
out to be whoever happens to be sitting beside you.
</P>
<P>
   As an introduction to socialized meditation, we are given an
``approaching elderhood'' questionnaire to fill out that, among
other things, asks us how we would ideally spend our time as an
elder. One woman who volunteers declares: ``I think you should have
as many laughs as you can and pack as much silliness into life as
you can.'' There are no dissenters.
</P>
<P>
   The wakeup call the next morning is the nicest I've ever had. At
7 a.m. conference center codirector Prudence Berry stands outside
my bedroom door and on a wood flute plays another lovely and
uplifting hymn: ``How Can I Keep From Singing?''
</P>
<P>
   After breakfast, we assemble in the meeting hall for what will
be a pretty full day, one that exposes us to a range of Spiritual
Eldering techniques from artsy (drawing mandalas, circular patterns
symbolizing aspects of life) to mystical (closing our eyes and
visualizing people we love and have learned from). But to start, we
have a lively discussion about death.
</P>
<P>
   Many older people let themselves get stuck in what Rabbi
Shachter-Shalomi calls ``the box of life,'' says Steffi Shapiro.
``Denial of death inhibits accessing increased awareness. You don't
want to look at painful memories in your past and you're afraid to
look the Angel of Death in the face, so all you're left with is a
shriveled present.'' Midlife, roughly from 50 to 65, should be a
time to review your goals and values; after that, as an elder, the
main concern should be with completing your life by creating a
spiritual legacy by counseling and serving others.

<P>
   Reaching out doesn't come easy to many people, however. ``I used
to do volunteer work at a senior citizens center but got
disillusioned,'' says 75-year-old Thelma Kandarian of New Haven
during a socialized meditation period. ``I get my satisfaction from
doing things for others, but some older people are very demanding
and think that the world owes them a living.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Life repair
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Among the recommended Spiritual Eldering techniques for
reviewing the past and reaching out to people around you is making
a ``life repair'' list of unresolved situations and then resolving
them, if possible. Also, composing an ``ethical will,'' a letter to
be read after your death, in which you candidly describe the
non-material legacy _ values, hopes, and family feelings _ you want
to leave behind. After trying to visualize our loved ones,
assembled around a table as if for a holiday meal, we each write
our own sample ethical wills.
</P>
<P>
   David, who says she has written an ethical will to her husband
and each of her five children, recommends rewriting them
periodically. ``I think it would be much better to say these things
to people while we're still alive,'' comments 47-year-old Gail
Shapiro of Wayland, who came to the workshop with her 75-year-old
father, Harold Shapiro of New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   After a short but energetic dance break (to vintage swing on a
Glenn Miller CD) that noticeably lightens the atmosphere, large
sheets of paper and boxes of crayons are handed out and we're asked
to draw a mandala, using different colors, designs, and symbols to
represent our physical, emotional, intellectual, and physical
lives. The results run the gamut from childlike to impressively
artistic. One woman produces an elaborate and beautiful design but
decides it's ``too revealing'' to tack up on a wall and neatly
folds the paper into a box shape, her own particular ``box of
life.''
</P>
<P>
   The day ends on a rollicking note. Shapiro and David distribute
musical instruments _ drums, rattles, tambourines, and flutes _ and
we make joyful noises and do a line dance around the meeting room
to celebrate our lives and the people we've become. Then everyone
describes something they particularly want to celebrate and leads
the group in an appropriate song.
</P>
<P>
   A woman about to move into a new house sings ``Home Sweet
Home,'' a man celebrating a wedding anniversary ``Amazing Grace.''
To celebrate the fact that she still sails regularly, Sally
Cartwright, a frail-looking 74-year-old from Tenants Harbor, Maine,
breaks into ``What Do You Do With a Drunken Sailor?''
</P>
<P>
   The final half-day session starts with a discussion of what we
think we've learned and can make use of from the workshop. Most
participants say they are trying to age positively and came to
Rowe, in northwestern Massachusetts, hoping to get support _ and
advice _ from peers with similar attitudes. ``I wish I could meet
every week with people like this who are going through the same
things I am,'' says Anne Dewees, a 68-year-old widow from
Portsmouth, N.H. ``I'm not afaid of death but I am afraid of the
unknown.'' Several people agree and say they hope to start similar
discussion groups where they live. &QL; 
 &QL; 
Working at sagedom
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Spiritual Eldering process is an ongoing one, Steffi Shapiro
notes, and the workshop is only an introduction to it. She
recommends repeating the exercises we've done in the workshop at
home, journaling, reading Shachter-Shalomi's book ``From Age-ing to
Sage-ing,'' and making a conscious effort to reach out to family
and community. Become a sage in training, in other words.
</P>
<P>
   Before the council of elders convenes, Shapiro and David ask us
to visualize for one last time, mentally conjuring a ``wisdom
figure,'' someone who has been a spiritual guide in our lives. The
image that comes to my mind is of an older brother, killed in the
last weeks of World War II but in memory still a grinning
22-year-old and a supporting and mentoring presence.
</P>
<P>
   Gail Shapiro and her father both visualize the same person, her
grandmother and his mother. Dave Pierson of Eliot, Maine, sees his
father, walking down a forest path on the family farm. ``Some of
his philosophy I've rejected, but a lot I've retained,'' Pierson
tells the council. ``We take what we can from our elders and move
on.''
</P>
<P>
   A number of people say the workshop, and the socialized
meditation discussions in particular, helped them form a much
clearer idea of how they want to live out their lives. One is Nancy
Dalrymple, 77, of Port Clyde, Maine. ``I'm going to become a
crotchety and opinionated old lady,'' she announces, cheerfully.

TRAVEL COMPANIES WOO SENIORS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JERRY MORRIS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Seniors are on the go. And tour operators are rushing to meet
their demands.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  Now before you turn the page, saying ``I'm no senior,'' think
again. The term ``senior,'' once reserved for those 65 and older,
now, whether you like it or not, includes those 50 and older. One
travel organization even suggests its tours are for those 49- plus,
but, like other companies, at least refers to those as ``mature''
travelers.
</P>
<P>
   And, whether we like it or not, every nine seconds someone turns
50. This is a trend that will continue for the next decade, and by
the year 2000, one out of every eight Americans will be 65 or over,
according to the folks at Del Webb Corp., builders of communities
for people 55 and older.
</P>
<P>
   Tour operators are redefining their programs to cater to this
growing market. According to the National Tour Association, the
next wave of senior citizens (already hitting the market) is quite
different from the present 64-and-over market. The new senior group
is seen as being more independent, leaning toward cruising, liking
the upscale, having special interests, and being fitness-conscious.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Everidge, former Tour Associationpresident, calls the 50 to
64 age group the ``tweeners'' _ those between today's seniors and
the baby-boom generation. Some of these are early retirees, and
they don't think of themselves as ready to join a group of seniors
on a bus tour.
</P>
<P>
   Grand Circle Travel, a company that's been in business 40 years
catering to senior travel, recently purchased Overseas Adventure
Travel, a 20-year veteran in adventure tours; and Vermont Bicycle
Touring, a 27-year-old pioneer in bike tours in New England and
elsewhere. These purchases reflect the changes in travel interests
of the ``mature'' market.
</P>
<P>
   Boston is the leading center for travel companies specializing
in tours for those 49 and older. Besides Grand Circle, Saga
Holidays, Vantage Travel, and Elderhostel are headquartered here.
Each of these companies offers tours that include more than just
sightseeing _ education and adventure are on many of the
itineraries. On the adventure side, most tours specify how
strenuous the tour is as a guide to potential participants.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the tours by these firms are all-inclusive, that is,
covering most of the expenses, from food to accommodations and
sightseeing, in one price. For those interested, the best bet is to
request catalogs from all the companies and compare prices,
offerings, and services. Elderhostel tends to cost less because it
uses college dorms for many of its tour accommodations. Saga
Holidays now has its own cruise ship and limits passage to those 50
and older.
</P>
<P>
   Travel has become a passion for many seniors. One traveler wrote
to Grand Circle, saying, ``Never mind that I have spent my
children's inheritance. I have seen the Great Wall, viewed the Taj
Mahal, and ridden a camel to the pyramids.''
</P>
<P>
   Another area seniors are heading into is volunteerism.
Elderhostel, through its service programs, engages teams of older
adults in short-term volunteer projects in the United States and
around the world. Elderhostel pairs socially-concerned elders with
nonprofit organizations in need of volunteers, for duties ranging
from tutoring children to ecological research to conservation work.
Global Volunteers is another organization that offers volunteer
programs for all ages. For information, call 800-487-1074 or write
to 375 East Little Canada Road, St. Paul, MN 55117.
</P>
<P>
   The Appalachian Mountain Club (5 Joy St., Boston, MA 02108) has
many programs in New England for elders, and many are offered
through Elderhostel. Programs range from trail work to explorations
of Mount Greylock (Sept. 28-30) in Western Massachusetts to a
Grandparent and Grandchild Nature Weekend (Sept. 19-20) in the
Catskills.
</P>
<P>
   For information on these programs, write to Elderhostel, Dept.
M1, PO Box 1959, Wakefield, MA 01880. Grand Circle Travel, 347
Congress St., Boston, MA 02210, telephone 800-248-3737; Saga
Holidays, 222 Berkeley St., Boston, MA 02116, telephone
800-343-0273. Vantage Travel, 111 Cypress St., Brookline, MA 02146,
telephone 800-322-6677. These companies also offer handy guides for
mature travelers. For example, Vantage offers a free ``99 Travel
Tips for Mature Travelers,'' as well as a health guide.
</P>
<P>
   Among other tour ideas:
</P>
<P>
   Interhostel, an international -study/travel program service
sponsored by the University of New Hampshire offers 75 programs
annual for those 50 and older. For a catalog, call 800-733-9753 or
write to University of New Hampshire, 6 Garrison Ave., Durham, NH
03824.
</P>
<P>
   Collette Tours, a travel company based in Pawtucket, R.I.,
that's been owned by the Sullivan family since 1962, has seen its
senior market changing . Dan Sullivan Jr., president of the
company, said, ``Some travelers are looking for longer hotel stays
in one place, so we introduced what we refer to as `hub &AMP; spoke'
programs. Whereas the typical escorted tour covers a lot of ground
by moving from hotel to hotel, this program focuses on a smaller
region, staying in one or two hotels throughout the entire trip.''
The 80-year-old company has programs from New England to throughout
the world. All are backed by a consumer protection plan. For
information, call 800-340-5158.
</P>
<P>
   Staying in one location has been a specialty of Untours, which
features two-week tours in private homes or apartments in Europe
and elsewhere. Travelers are provided furnished accommodations,
local support staff, and the freedom to plan their own daily
itineraries. For information, write to Idyll Ltd., PO Box 405,
Media, PA 19063 or call 610-565-5242.
</P>
<P>
   Many destinations also cater to mature travelers. Orlando, Fla.,
reports 3.3 million mature travelers visit the area each year, and
there are special discounts just for this market. For a free copy
of Orlando's ``Official Visitors Guide'' and other publications,
call 800-551-0181.
</P>
<P>
   For seniors looking for good deals and other travel ideas, The
Mature Traveler, a newsletter that offers ``travel bonanzas for
49ers-plus,'' is a good choice. Subscriptions are $29.95 a year;
write to GEM Publishing Group, 250 East Riverview Circle, Reno, NV
89509. Subscribers also receive $2 off the $7.95 price of an annual
guide, ``The Mature Traveler's Book of Deals.''

</P>
<P>
   Tomorrow is Emancipation Day in the Bahamas, commemorating the
freeing of slaves there in 1834. The residents of Fox Hill, Nassau,
heard the news a week later, so their celebration is observed on
the second Tuesday of August. Celebrations there include a Junkanoo
Rushout with dancing, music, and instruments, beginning at 4 a.m.
Activities continue through Aug. 11.

   Still looking for a vacation destination? Canada, always a good
choice, is an even better value than ever. Right now the Canadian
dollar is at an all-time low. The ``loonie'' (nicknamed for the
loon pictured on it), Canada's dollar coin, is now worth 66.51 US
cents. For US residents, it's good news, as one US dollar now buys
about $1.46 in Canada.

   Many times, a sentence loses something in the translation from
another language. At other times, a sentence gains something that
it wasn't intended to. Take these examples, verified by linguists,
which were plucked off the Internet by Mike Schuster of Foxborough,
Mass.:
</P>
<P>
   _The Dairy Association's brought its ``Got Milk?'' advertising
campaign to Mexico. Just one problem: The Spanish translation read,
``Are you lactating?''
</P>
<P>
   _Coors put its slogan, ``Turn it loose,'' into Spanish, where it
was read by some as ``Suffer from diarrhea.''
</P>
<P>
   _An American T-shirt maker in Miami printed shirts for the
Spanish market honoring the Pope's visit. Instead of ``I saw the
Pope'' (el Papa), the shirts read ``I saw the potato'' (la papa).

German only to find out that ``mist'' is slang for manure. Few
people wanted a ``manure stick.''

LEWINSKY, COUNTRY HAVE SAME GOAL: GET IT OVER WITH 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (k and w coding.)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By THOMAS OLIPHANT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON -- OK, so Linda Tripp turns out not to be you, much
less the ``average American'' of her scripted self-portrayal, a
proposition around which Americans appear prepared to unite. But
there is someone at the heart of this mess who can be said to speak
with, if not exactly for, the country.
</P>
<P>
   That would be Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   If you think about it, what is best for this young woman is best
for everybody else.
</P>
<P>
   From the inevitable ``sources familiar with her personal and
legal situation,'' her personal goal is a real life, free of
momentary and thus false celebrity. And the view from her camp of
this mess is that it is entirely linked to a relationship with
President Clinton that she says was sexual. Period.
</P>
<P>
   From her camp's perspective, it is obvious that she has no
control of her time. However, it is just as obvious what outcome
would be in her best interests:an appearance before Kenneth Starr's
grand jury, and then nothing _ no melodramatic appearance before
the nation and a House committee holding impeachment hearings, no
testimony at the trials of anyone else.
</P>
<P>
   If you put together all (and it's admittedly not a great deal)
that the Lewinsky camp has offered since her pursuit of total
immunity succeeded, an interesting picture emerges that is
consistent with her goal and needs.
</P>
<P>
   She says directly that the relationship with the president was
sexual. To belabor the obvious, this is where her dress matters,
though why it matters is usually not made clear beyond the equally
obvious fact that what we are calling ``DNA evidence'' might be
dispositive.
</P>
<P>
   From her point of view, the dress matters so much because
without it she has left a bewildering trail of conflicting
statements to others and to Tripp's tape recorder about the
relationship. It is now apparent that what really stretched all
this out since last January was not court fights over privilege
issues; it was Starr, trying to make a circumstantial case by
methodically trying _ and failing _ to corroboborate virtually
every syllable on Tripp's tapes in the absence of Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   Also from her corner, there is more than the dress; there are
also those gifts she sent back to the White House last winter. She
and Clinton's private secretary, Betty Currie, as well as the
president remain to be heard from about that.
</P>
<P>
   Beyond sex and the precise circumstances of the returned gifts,
however, Lewinsky's pre-testimony offerings are all squishy about
her version of conversations with the president; there is said to
be much about suggestions and nothing in her own words alleging
direct instructions or requests to lie or actual coaching in
advance of her sworn statement or her then-impending deposition in
the Paula Jones case.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a few high-profile matters, Lewinsky's pre-grand
jury tidbits are explicitly exculpatory. She really does say, for
example, that she typed the celebrated ``talking points'' herself,
based in part on chats with Tripp. In contrast to the Tripp camp's
non-denial denial, she doesn't attempt to tie Tripp to the
``talking points'' per se but instead to some of the information
and thoughts in them.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky not only says that the White House and Clinton
retainers had nothing to do with the talking points, she also said
that nothing about her search for a job was related to her
forthcoming testimony by anyone who helped her. More to the point,
she says that prominent lawyer and Clinton friend Vernon Jordan
helped her get both the job and her first lawyer (Frank Carter) for
no other, ulterior purpose.
</P>
<P>
   The deeper significance of all this is that from the briefings
of reporters by Starr's office last January as well as Newsweek,
Lewinsky said quite the opposite while she was being bugged. In
other words, in at least one instance (there are others), she is
prepared to say that things said on those tapes are not true.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps this is why you hear criticism of the immunity deal from
the most zealous of the Clinton-did-it crowd, that Starr settled
for essentially what he was offered in January and lost critical
leverage to press his subornation and obstruction case.
</P>
<P>
   And regarding the dress, some of them, including Linda Tripp's
circle, worry that it was a set-up.
</P>
<P>
   What's behind that point of view is a realization that leading
Republicans in the House _ symbolized by chairman Henry Hyde of the
Judiciary Committee _ are not willing to press a sex-based case to
impeachment. It's clearcut obstruction or subornation _ or nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it's a sex-based case that Lewinsky is offering. Her
hope is that she can get her life back after testifying to the
grand jury and after the president gives his own testimony and
accounting to the public.
</P>
<P>
   And that is what more than two-thirds of the country is saying
in polls that it wants. So to the extent that she wants to tell her
story once as prelude to Clinton, and to the extent that she hopes
that is the end of it, she is indeed representing the rest of us,
whether we believe her or not.

POETRY, AS RECITED BY BANJO BLUNT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BUD COLLINS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONGREACH, Queensland, Australia _ Stop-lights do not exist in
these parts, but Longreach is justly pleased with its traffic
roundabout (rotary). ``First one west of the Great Dividing Range,
maybe a couple of hundred miles,'' says Alan ``Banjo'' Blunt. ``And
don't miss the sign that tells where the Tropic of Capricorn runs
through town.''
</P>
<P>
   It's about the only thing that runs. Pace is slow in the Outback
heat. If there is a rat race in Queensland, it's 800 miles distant
in Brisbane, the gleaming, modern capital on the northeast coast.
But that doesn't mean folks aren't lively, and more welcoming than
a waterhole in the neighboring Simpson Desert.
</P>
<P>
   At the moment, Banjo Blunt, nicknamed thusly by locals for his
flair in reciting the bushland poetry of Australian favorite, A.B.
``Banjo'' Paterson, is entertaining at an indoor oasis, the barroom
of the Commercial Hotel. As the proprietors, Roly and Anne Gooding,
and customers rest their elbows and listen, Blunt, glass in hand,
declaims:
</P>
<P>
   ``'Twas the horse thief, Andy Regan, that was hunted like a
dog/By the troopers of the upper Murray -side/They had searched in
every gully _ they had looked in every -log/But never sight or
track of him they spied.''
</P>
<P>
   What brought that up? Well, thievery had been a conversational
topic on his tourist boat, the Yellow Belly, that Blunt pilots
through the wilds up and down the Thomson River every evening,
grasping the wheel in one hand, a microphone in the other. Alas,
not a hand free for a whiskey, but that comes later anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Outback outlaws _ bush rangers _ are legendary in northwestern
Queensland, as in its American counterpart, the Old West. Blunt, a
gregarious middle-ager, had been regaling us with tales of the
regional black hat hero called Captain Starlight as we passed
Cassidy's Knob in the indigo serenity of dusk, a height also known
as Starlight's Lookout.
</P>
<P>
   Starlight (born Henry Readford) was a brazen cattle duffer
(rustler), who used the hill to scout prospective income on the
hoof. In 1870, he pulled his biggest herd heist, stealing 1,000
head from a station (ranch) at Mount Cornish. With two accomplices,
he drove them about 1,500 dry and rugged miles over the state
border and into South Australia, where he peddled his loot. Three
years later, the captain was apprehended, tried _ and acquitted.
The jury was undoubtedly impressed by his improbable feat that
trailblazed what became a popular route.
</P>
<P>
   ``Far's I know,'' says Blunt, ``Banjo Paterson didn't write
anything about Starlight, so the horse thief Regan is the best I
can do tonight.'' He concludes the recital fittingly in bravura
basso with Regan's funeral:
</P>
<P>
   ``So they buried Andy Regan, and they buried him to rights/In
the graveyard at the back of Kiley's Hill/There were
five-and-twenty mourners who had five-and-twenty fights/Till the
very boldest fighters had their fill.
</P>
<P>
   ``There were fifty horses racing from the graveyard to the
pub/And their riders flogged each other all the while/And the
lashin's of the liquor! And the lavin's of the -grub!/Oh, poor Andy
went to rest in proper style.''
</P>
<P>
   Much applause, then a round on the house from publican ,Gooding,
whose wares include such canned curios as rum and coke, Jack
Daniel's and Coca-Cola, Jim Beam and Coca-Cola. My Boston pal, Dee
Wallace, wouldn't approve of her friend Jack commingling with
anything but water. But keeping him in the icebox in a flip-top can
might be handy.
</P>
<P>
   The Commercial's excellent $6 T-bone steak is more to my liking,
and Roly says friend Aurelio and I do meet the rigid qualifications
of his neatly printed barroom directive: ``Dress rules apply.''
</P>
<P>
   ``No bare feet or bodies, mate.''
</P>
<P>
   Longreach, a pleasant community of 3,200, gains welcome shade
from roofed sidewalks downtown and tall gum trees. The
architectural prize goes to the handsome 82-year-old wooden
railroad station, white with red roof and green trim. But the older
Welcome Home Hotel _ a tribute to Boer War veterans _ in
blue-trimmed white timber is a contender.
</P>
<P>
   ``You would have loved our old place,'' says Roly, noting a
photo of the original Commercial Hotel, built in the same
late-19th-century gingerbread style. ``We lost it in a fire. I
wasn't there at the time, but luckily Anne and the two kids escaped
by jumping from the second story.''
</P>
<P>
   ``My back hasn't been the same since,'' she winces.
</P>
<P>
   Their present establishment in this ornithologically-minded town
is on Eagle Street near the corner of Duck. ``Land bird streets,
Robin and Galah, for instance,'' she explains, ``run north and
south. Water birds like Swan and Snipe, east and west.''
</P>
<P>
   Out on Plover are the most compelling reasons to visit: the
Stockman's Hall of Fame &AMP; Outback Heritage Centre and, across the
street, the Qantas Founders Museum. All over Australia small towns,
regardless of seeming insignificance, are extremely conscious and
proud of their heritage. This shows in the construction and
maintenance of museums, often extraordinary and well out of
proportion to population and isolated location.
</P>
<P>
   Extraordinary, indeed, are the Stockman's and Qantas, done in
style and quality that would be appreciated in any city in the
world. However, I feel the Stockman's, alluding to ranchers, is a
misleadingly missnamed mouthful. It really is a monument to the
pioneering spirit of all those who settled very difficult country,
and the aborigines whose land they invaded.
</P>
<P>
   Small quibble. Once entering the portals in the brilliantly-hued
facade _ a horseshoe tinted in purples and rust dividing two
hemi-horseshoes _ you could spend hours wandering and gawking,
listening and absorbing on several levels. Paintings, photographic
displays, antiques, lifelike scenes, audio and visual presentations
vividly chronicle human ordeals and triumphs in demanding lives.
</P>
<P>
   A knockout is the Old Drover. A computerized cowboy, he sits
beside a bush camp fire while his mates sleep, telling tales with a
wink about his cattle-driving days. He probably knew Captain
Starlight. When O.D. finishes his spiel, you want to ask this very
human dummy for his autograph.
</P>
<P>
   Gripping and absolutely chilling is another tale, told through
earphones and priming your imagination. An actress reads the words
of a farm wife recounting the stalking of herself and two small
children in their kitchen by a huge, poisonous brown snake _ and
how they survive.
</P>
<P>
   Much less imposing in structure but nonetheless meaningful is
the Qantas museum. It is nothing more (or less) than a large iron
shed, the first hangar of a rural enterprise started in 1920 by
adventurous young Aussies that would become the excellent
globe-spanning airline with the odd-looking name. Yes, Qantas has a
meaning: Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services.
</P>
<P>
   Launched here to introduce airplanes in the form of scenic rides
for trusting and inquisitive inhabitants, Qantas would, in the
words of William Hughes, the Australian prime minister at the time,
``deliver us from the fetters imposed by our remoteness.''
</P>
<P>
   Soon the early open-cockpit planes, crafted of spruce and
plywood, fleshed out with Irish linen, were carrying mail and
passengers at a wondrous 70 m.p.h., and putting the country in
touch with itself, eventually the world. The hangar became a
factory where for a while Quantas built its own planes. ``We were
the first airline to do that,'' says a company man, Wally Mariani.
</P>
<P>
   Some of those daring ancient old planes have been preserved
here, along with tools of their construction and the gramophone
whose music cheered workmen in the sweltering
(pre-air--conditioning) building. Prominent among the souvenirs of
another time are important instructions to Outbackers on ``How to
receive an aeroplane'':
</P>
<P>
   ``Build a smoke fire (to aid the pilot with wind direction), and
make sure the landing ground is free of stock and other
obstructions.''
</P>
<P>
   Banjo Paterson preceded air travel, but his lines from ``In The
Droving Days'' might apply to the experience of low-flying pilots
and passengers in the formative years:
</P>
<P>
   ``We saw the fleet wild horses pass/And the kangaroos through
the Mitchell grass/The emu ran with her frightened brood/All
unmolested and unpursued.''

MEET JOHN MARTORANO 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MIKE BARNICLE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   His name is John Martorano, and while he may have murdered more
people over the course of his career as a huge gangster than get
killed in the first 27 minutes of ``Saving Private Ryan,'' he is
regarded today as a trophy by the FBI as well as the US Attorney's
office in Boston simply because he can't stop talking. It seems the
Justice Department is on the verge of forgiving the man for
multiple homicides he is believed to have committed over three
decades due to the dream that Martorano might help them find Jimmy
Bulger, who sure did embarrass and use federal law enforcement
agents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Okay, let's see,'' Eddie Walsh recalled in Boston Monday.
``There was the girl in the rug at Luigi's. That was a place
upstairs from the Intermission Lounge, an after-hours joint. He
killed this girl and wrapped her body up in a rug. I know he did
that one. Long time ago, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then there were the three black girls at Basin Street South;
that was down past Northampton Street on the left, right near where
the South End and Roxbury come together. He was going to kill one
girl, but she had two friends with her, so he killed all three.
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy, oh, boy, he has killed a lot of people,'' Walsh pointed
out. ``You've got to remember there were 65 gangland murders in two
years back in the mid-1960s and John did an awful lot of them, too.
We knew he did them _ like with the girls _ but we could just never
get anybody to come to court and testify because everybody knew
he'd kill them. John was basically a serial killer.''
</P>
<P>
   Eddie Walsh, 76 now and retired, was an honorable cop. And John
Martorano was a one-man crime wave until he became a fugitive in
1978 and fled to Florida until a bookie here gave him up, so he got
lugged back to become part of a ludicrous hearing in federal court
being held to decide whether a handful of gangsters ought to be
granted freedom because of FBI duplicity and incompetence.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is in front of Judge Mark Wolf. Every day for months
Martorano sat with a scowl alongside fellow defendants Frank
Salemme and Stevie Flemmi until suddenly three weeks ago he
disappeared, having decided it was better to cut a ``Lewinsky'' _
obtain immunity from the government and rat out everyone _ rather
than wait for a judge to send him back to prison to die.
</P>
<P>
   ``John will say anything to get out,'' Eddie Walsh declared,
``but you have to ask yourself, `Who's worse here? John, or the
people who want to give him immunity for all those murders because
they think he can help them get Whitey Bulger?' Do they believe the
lives of 50 or 60 victims are worth catching this one guy?''
</P>
<P>
   Martorano is allegedly claiming that Bulger and Flemmi provided
him with the weapons he used a decade ago to kill a businessman in
Oklahoma and another in Florida who worked for World Jai-Lai; which
is like saying Mark McGuire shows up at the ballpark every day
unable to locate a bat. He is also thought to be implicating a
former top FBI official, Paul Rico, for helping to orchestrate the
murders.
</P>
<P>
   Jimmy Bulger, currently quite a successful fugitive himself, was
dangerous because he could think. Martorano, however, was dangerous
because he didn't. He and his late partner, Joe McDonald from
Somerville, Mass. _ dead, incredibly due to by natural causes _ led
typically boring gangster lives: Get up. Have coffee. Drive to a
corner. Talk about Cadillacs or young girls. Collect money. Drive
to meat market for prosciutto. Kill someone. Have more coffee.
</P>
<P>
   To give an idea of their mindset, when McDonald was dying in a
hospice, law enforcement authorities went seeking his assistance in
solving a murder. McDonald motioned a cop closer to his bedside
where he whispered: ``Nothing personal, but I wouldn't cross the
street to piss in your ear if your brains were on fire.'' Now his
old partner comes up a complete motor-mouth.
</P>
<P>
   ``Know what ought to bother them?'' Eddie Walsh asked. ``John
Martorano killed an awful lot of black people. He practically used
black people for target practice in Roxbury. You think they'd be
offering him a deal if his victims were a bunch of bankers or big
business guys? I guess they figure John's victims don't count, that
he didn't kill anybody important enough to remember. If he gets
immunity, they ought to put the judge in jail.''

BEN COATES: TOO CLOSELY COVERED 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By RON BORGES  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In case you haven't guessed, the New England Patriots are not
going to fire Ben Coates. They are not even going to think about
firing Ben Coates.
</P>
<P>
   Nor should they.
</P>
<P>
   That being said, let's take a moment to explore what has gone on
here in recent days in the matter of Ben Coates.
</P>
<P>
   It has become popular in local sporting circles to postulate
that Patriots owner Robert Kraft is on the moral hot seat because
of recent revelations surrounding the All-Pro tight end and his
offspring, at least three of whom apparently were not a product of
marriage.
</P>
<P>
   Some have gone so far as to compare Coates's situation with that
of David Meggett, the disgraced former Patriot running back who was
arrested following a tag-team match with a woman and a teammate in
a Toronto hotel room last winter, and Christian Peter, the
twice-convicted and oft-accused former Nebraska lineman who was cut
two days after he was drafted when his record of physical abuse of
women became widely known.
</P>
<P>
   Frankly, those situations are like comparing apples and
cabbages. As for Coates's handling of his private life, that is the
business of nobody but Coates, his wife, the children he has
fathered, their mothers, and whatever God they believe in.
</P>
<P>
   However, it has become fashionable of late for the media to set
themselves up as the morality police, at least on those days when
it suits our agenda. On days when it does not, we ignore many of
the same acts we at other times condemn.
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is the seemingly endless parade of columns that
have been written insisting that no one should care if the guy
running our country had consensual sex with women other than his
wife and then lied about it under oath.
</P>
<P>
   We should not care, we write, that he is alleged to have taken
advantage of a starry-eyed intern.
</P>
<P>
   We should not care, we write, whether the man who runs the
country lies or tells the truth.
</P>
<P>
   We should not care, we write, how often he sleeps with whomever
he sleeps with, even if some of that time it is clearly not his
wife because that's her business not ours.
</P>
<P>
   We should not care, we write, because it's a personal matter not
a professional one.
</P>
<P>
   We should not care, we write, because the economy is booming,
the national deficit is down, and we are at peace with most
everyone in the world, so what Bill Clinton does on his own time is
his business.
</P>
<P>
   The allegations against the President and the effect they have
had on the office he holds and on parents across the country _ who
find themselves being asked, as I have been by a 9-year-old, what
oral sex is or if I have a girlfriend, like the president _ are no
big deal to many of the same people who find the revelations about
Ben Coates appalling and grounds for his dismissal.
</P>
<P>
   Well, as much as I like the work of Ben Coates, who is the
game's highest-paid tight end for a good reason, I do not equate it
with the work of the President of the United States in importance
or significance to society. So why is it a grave offense for a
football player or a basketball player or a baseball player to act
irresponsibly but when it could be the President of the United
States, it's declared no problem and life goes on?
</P>
<P>
   That Coates has done what more and more professional athletes
seem to be doing _ have children out of wedlock _ is distasteful
and, frankly, not the way I believe families should be created.
It's also none of my business because he at least is doing the bare
minimum, which is financially supporting those children.
</P>
<P>
   Ideally this situation should not exist but it seems ideals in
sports disappeared sometime around the advent of the Lexus/Nexus
computer search of court records. So now we must deal with reality,
and the reality is Coates broke no laws in his dealings with his
children.
</P>
<P>
   Apparently he challenged their paternity, which is his right,
and then began paying what the court said he owed once paternity
was established. That is indeed the minimum, but it is all that is
legally required when consensual sex leads to a birth.
</P>
<P>
   Last week, Coates was accused of taking part in a violent
confrontation with the mother of one of those children after she
came to his house at 10:30 at night and allegedly began pounding on
the door to investigate what he was doing with another young woman
not his wife. If this is becoming hard to follow that's
understandable, but bear with me.
</P>
<P>
   Coates called the police, then ended up getting arrested for
allegedly pushing her down and slamming her head into a car. The
evidence of this was a friend of the woman backing her claim and a
cut on the woman's arm.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Coates is 6 feet 5 inches and weighs 250 pounds. My guess is
that if he slammed my face into a car, I would have more than a cut
on my arm. A court will decide that question, and it will try to do
so with dueling eyewitnesses, including neighbors who back Coates's
claim that she attacked him and that he never threw her into any
car. He said, she said. Sounds like a presidential crisis, doesn't
it?
</P>
<P>
   Other than that, Coates has not been accused of breaking any
laws that we know of. He exercised his right to challenge paternity
of three children and when he lost, he paid the consequences.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously, this is not the way you'd like it to be. Casual sex
that leads to children who seldom see their father is by definition
an irresponsible act and one that is bad for society and worse for
the child. It doesn't say much good about the adults involved,
either, but that is an issue to be settled between the parties, not
by newspapers. So beyond saying, ``Ah ha,'' what was the point of
revealing that Coates is the latest in a long line of athletes who
have fathered children out of wedlock? Was it revealed that he had
committed any crimes? No. Was it revealed that any of the women
involved accused him of any crimes, with the exception of the
incident of a week ago? No.
</P>
<P>
   So what is the point of a Lexus/Nexus witch hunt into an
athlete's private life?
</P>
<P>
   Do we care if the president is involved in similarly tawdry
relationships while running the country? From what I read, I
conclude not.
</P>
<P>
   Yet many have suggested that Kraft should fire Coates or be
declared morally bankrupt and a fraud because of the positions he
took with Peter and Meggett _ even though those situations were not
remotely akin to Coates's.
</P>
<P>
   What we have here is not grounds for dismissal. What we have
here is the kind of mess newspapers should approach the way some of
them want the special prosecutor to approach the President of the
United States.
</P>
<P>
   We should stay out of it.

PAIN AND GAIN AGAINST SPAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB RYAN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATHENS _ Is the team with ``USA'' on its chest occasionally
cocky? Is the team with ``USA'' on its chest sometimes too, shall
we say, imperiously American in its attitude, as if it really were
some kind of Dream Team and not a gathering of second-tier players?
Is the team with ``USA'' on its chest eternally vulnerable?
</P>
<P>
   Answers: Perhaps; good Lord, let's hope not; and absolutely,
positively, yes.
</P>
<P>
   In defeat, and even in victory, this is an eminently human team.
Last night's 75-73 escape over Spain had coach Rudy Tomjanovich
reaching for the whip at the end of the first half.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a good character win for us,'' he said, ``but I can't
tell you how disappointed I was with this team in the first half.
After all the work we've put in, it was very tough to watch us play
like that. I told them I could find five guys off the street who
could do as well.''
</P>
<P>
   And please keep in mind he wasn't referring to Petersburg,
either. We're in Athens.
</P>
<P>
   If 'tis true that all's well that ends well, then this was a
successful evening at the World Basketball Championships. So what
if the US fell behind by surrendering a 3-pointer to Alberto
Herreros on the first possession and never got ahead until the
invaluable Jimmy Oliver swished a dramatic 3-pointer to make it
72-71 with with 1:18 to go? So what if they scored on just three of
their first 13 possessions and trailed by 12 four times in the
first half? So what if they were down by 11 at the half (42-31), a
score created when, following an Oliver 3-pointer, the slumbering
US squad allowed the unthinkable: a take-that sneakaway basket by
Ignacio De Miguel? So what if they couldn't solve the bewildering
assortment of zones concocted by wily Spain coach Manuel ``Lolo''
Sainz?
</P>
<P>
   They got the W, didn't they?
</P>
<P>
   Well, that's not exactly what Oliver is saying. The former
Purdue ace is distinguishing himself as the team's toughest marker.
While outspoken in his belief that the US is the team best
qualified to win the gold medal at these World Championships, he is
equally adamant that the US won't win squat if it isn't prepared to
get down and dirty for 40 minutes every time it takes the floor.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm happy we won, but I'm not happy with the way we did it,''
said Oliver, who led the Americans with a 17-point performance that
included 5-for-9 shooting on threes. ``I've been telling you guys
that we can't keep playing this way and expect to win. We let them
dictate everything on the court in the first half. We go out on the
court as if we're the best team in the world, and we're far from
that.''
</P>
<P>
   Spain was the aggressor at both ends. The Spaniards produced
offensive results with a classically European drive-and-dish scheme
that freed the likes of Herreros (game-high 27) and Jose Paraiso,
and they confounded the impatient Americans by mixing up 2-3 and
1-3-1 zones, out of which they created some tough situations with a
matchup philosophy.
</P>
<P>
   Rudy T had a lot to talk about at halftime, but the No. 1 topic
was defense and hustle. Any comeback would have to start with
improvement in those areas. The change in the American team was
immediately evident. They were an almost maniacal defensive team on
occasion in the second half, and the resultant energy carried over
to the offense, where Oliver, Wendell Alexis (three 3-pointers in
the second half), and backup point guard Kiwane Garris all made big
shots. And once again Rudy relied on young Brad Miller to anchor
the middle during crunch time. The 6-foot-11-inch kid from Purdue
continues to make a mockery out of the 1998 NBA draft, which
included 58 people not named Brad Miller.
</P>
<P>
   But what mattered most was defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``We extended the defense so that the people with the ball were
no longer looking for cutters,'' explained Alexis. ``They did not
get as many good looks at the basket.''
</P>
<P>
   The US created the game's first tie at 59-all on a Garris three,
but Spain fought back, twice getting extraordinary hustle plays by
the 6-7 DeMiguel, who created 5 second-chance points for his team
by beating Americans to the floor for mid-lane loose ball
retrieves.
</P>
<P>
   It was still minus-5 as late as 69-64 (3:00). An Alexis three
tied the game at 69 apiece with 2:17 remaining, but what turned out
to be the biggest hoop was a play by Oliver, a professional
shooter. With Spain ahead at 71-69, Oliver smoothly drifted from
right to left and swished a huge three at 1:18. Good defense (an
Alexis stop on a Rodrigo De La Fuente drive comes to mind) and the
requisite amount of free throws by, in order, Miller, Jimmy King
and then Miller again, put the game away.
</P>
<P>
   If the US goes on to win the gold, the Oliver shot will be a
keepsake memory.
</P>
<P>
   ``Going to my left is the way I'm most comfortable,'' he
acknowledged. ``If you notice, I don't square off very well. I sort
of shoot side-cocked.''
</P>
<P>
   Tomjanovich hoped the Lithuania loss would have taught the team
what it needed to know, but he now knows better. Again, he is a
hopeful man.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a coach, you're never satisfied,'' he said. ``But we
battled to the end, and I had to like that.''
</P>
<P>
   In such an even field, battling is essential.
</P>
<P>
   ``Defense will win it,'' cautioned Alexis. ``A lot of these
teams can score, but not all of them can play defense.''
</P>
<P>
   Oliver makes it even more basic.
</P>
<P>
   ``That (gold) medal should belong to us,'' he asserted, ``but
we've got to remember we are a working-class team. We have to take
what's ours.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Rudy should order up some uniforms that, instead of saying
``NBA,'' should say ``CBA.'' That might keep them sufficiently
humble.

FIDELITY APPEARS BACK ON TRACK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By LYNNLEY BROWNING  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ The headlines were harsh, the critics unforgiving.
Several years ago, Fidelity Investments had gotten off track,
making bets that depressed returns at some of its biggest mutual
funds, scrambling to contain an exodus of fund managers, and
charging fund shareholders more for delivering less.
</P>
<P>
   Those days finally seem gone _ and the evidence lies in
Fidelity's strong performance &UR;  &LR; so far this year.
</P>
<P>
   After years of trailing funds that track the Standard &AMP; Poor's
500 index _ the most common benchmark for US stock funds and a
measure whose component stocks have produced most of Wall Street's
recent gains _ many top Fidelity funds are now beating the index.
Such a feat is something of a holy grail for large funds whose
managers rigorously pick stocks, as Fidelity does, rather than
passively mirror the composition of the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, nine out of 23 Fidelity domestic equity funds
that concentrate on large companies with strong earnings potential
have outperformed the S&AMP;P 500's gain of 16.1 percent through last
month.
</P>
<P>
   That is an improvement on a year ago. For the 12-month period
that ended July 1997, only one Fidelity fund topped the S&AMP;P 500 and
the popular Vanguard fund that tracks the index. And the improved
returns are a far cry from the 12-month period that ended July
1996, when nearly one in three big US equity funds bested the index
but only one in six large Fidelity funds did so.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, so far this year, 43 percent of all mutual fund assets
that are beating the S&AMP;P 500 are in nine Fidelity funds, according
to Kanon Bloch Carre, an investment consulting firm in Boston.
Among Fidelity's strong performers are Magellan, Contrafund, and
Emerging Growth.
</P>
<P>
   Across the mutual fund industry, about 18 percent of domestic
equity growth funds of all kinds are beating the S&AMP;P 500.
</P>
<P>
   After its spate of turmoil, how did Fidelity turn things around?
</P>
<P>
   Robert C. Pozen, who heads Boston-based Fidelity's mutual fund
division, cites a host of factors ranging from Fidelity's belated
acceptance that the pricey stocks now generating most of the
returns are not a flash in the pan to better research.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've learned that if you have a high price but growing
earnings, the price can continue to grow,'' said Pozen, referring
to high price-earnings ratios of the costliest but best-returning
stocks &UR; . &LR;  The ratio is a key measure of stock value. ``We've been
pretty focused on that point,'' Pozen said.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past 12 to 18 months, more large-capitalization stocks,
such as Microsoft Corp. and Lucent Technologies Inc., have shown up
in the top-10 holdings of major Fidelity funds, according to
company fund guides.
</P>
<P>
   All that sounds innocuous enough. But it reflects subtle shifts
at the nation's largest fund firm, where Pozen has made changes
since assuming his position a little over a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   The man whose investment style set the tone for Fidelity was
Peter M. Lynch, who generated strong returns for Magellan during
the last decade by finding undervalued stocks deemed likely to
grow. Now, a narrow group of blue-chips in the S&AMP;P 500, not smaller
diamonds-in-the-rough, is generating most of the gains.
</P>
<P>
   ``We could have been a little faster to adjust to this new style
in the market,'' Pozen said. ``But it's not so easy to identify
when you'll be moving from one phase to the next.'' Still, he said,
Fidelity has not abandoned its search for stock bargains in favor
of investing willy-nilly in the large-company stocks that are
fueling the bull market.
</P>
<P>
   But Fidelity is devoting greater resources to detecting major
market trends. The shift comes after criticism that the privately
held firm missed some gains in recent years by avoiding
large-company stocks.
</P>
<P>
   Under a more rigorous review process involving more data and new
analytical tools, Pozen meets each quarter with investment
objective groups, such as those focused on growth stocks, to plot
strategy. In an effort to sharpen its expertise, Fidelity has
doubled to two years the amount of time analysts stay focused on a
particular industry. It has also improved its research, with the
core domestic unit now separate from quantitative, technical, and
foreign sections.
</P>
<P>
   And some large funds, such as Contrafund and Magellan, have
winnowed the number of stocks they hold but increased their
weightings in top-returning blue-chips _ a sign that Fidelity is
ferreting out stocks instead of simply buying any blue-chip.
</P>
<P>
   ``They have gone a little bit more into large-cap stocks,'' said
Eric M. Kobren of Kobren Insight Management Inc. ``But it's not
like they've given up on stock picking.''
</P>
<P>
   The changes have generally pleased investors, who have put $11.2
billion into all Fidelity equity funds so far this year, compared
with $9.4 billion a year ago, according to company data.
</P>
<P>
   Other stabilizing measures have calmed shareholders of Fidelity
funds and industry analysts alike. After a string of defections by
top portfolio managers in 1996, Fidelity has succeeded in keeping
people on board. Top funds are fully invested and no longer deal
investors shock surprises as Magellan did in 1995 under Jeffrey N.
Vinik, whose bet on bonds and technology stocks depressed the
fund's returns.

   ``Clearly, Fidelity has changed,'' said Russell J. Kinnel,
equity fund editor at Morningstar Inc, a Chicago fund tracker.
``The nasty surprises are by and large a thing of the past.''
</P>
<P>
   In May 1996 Fidelity ranked dead last among major fund families
when returns of its funds were compared with the S&AMP;P 500, according
to Kanon Bloch Carre. In June 1997, it was third. Last June,
Fidelity was first.

<P>
   ``They went back to what they were supposed to do,'' said Kanon
Bloch Carre's president, William Dougherty, ``and they delivered
the results.''

LIKE IT OR NOT, IT'S NEWS 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   For those who think the media acted irresponsibly by reporting
on Ben Coates and his off-field behavior, here are two words: Grow
up.
</P>
<P>
   Not to insult anyone's intelligence, but news is not the
gazillion planes that take off and land safely, it's the one that
crashes.
</P>
<P>
   Ben Coates crashed. He was the one in court answering criminal
chrges. He was the one posting bail money. And he is the one that
offers NFL officials a test case for their new violent crime
policy.
</P>
<P>
   Why is Ben Coates news?
</P>
<P>
   Whether he is found innocent or guilty of assault charges, the
fact that there was an altercation in his driveway between him and
the mother of one of his children, well, that's news. It's not on
the order of the Camp David peace accord, but in terms of celebrity
gossip, you can't beat it.
</P>
<P>
   The funny part is that most professional athletes know what the
media will do if one of them is led away in handcuffs. That's
especially true nowadays, when the NFL has put teeth into its
anti-violence policy. If a player is convicted of a violent crime,
the commissioner can impose a fine or suspension or both.
</P>
<P>
   ``Engaging in violent criminal activity is unacceptable and
constitutes conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public
confidence in the National Football League,'' the policy states.
``Such activity alienates the fans on whom the success of the
league depends and has potential tragic consequences for both the
victim of the crime and perpetrator ...''
</P>
<P>
   The NFL goes on to list examples of what is considered a
``violent'' crime: ``Any crime involving the use or threat of
physical violence to a person or persons, the use of a deadly
weapon in the commission of a crime, possession of or distribution
of weapons in violation of state or federal law, involvement in
so-called hate crimes or crimes of domestic violence or the
destruction of property.''
</P>
<P>
   Few radio talk show hosts or callers have mentioned the NFL's
new policy; perhaps most don't know about it. They do know about
Christian Peter and Dave Meggett.
</P>
<P>
   Integrity matters. And for all the stories, talk-show calls, and
late-night TV shows, the one person missing in the dialogue has
been Patriots owner Robert Kraft (or a representative).
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots had a lot to say when they rejected a $57 million
deal offered by Massachusetts House Speaker Thomas Finneran to help
build a new stadium with taxpayers' money.
</P>
<P>
   Kraft wanted the $72 million offered under a Senate plan backed
by Senate President Thomas F. Birmingham.
</P>
<P>
   The Kraft organization was quick to offer a public rejection of
the Finneran proposal but has remained virtually mum on the Coates
matter.
</P>
<P>
   No telling the reason; the Patriots aren't saying.
</P>
<P>
   According to Don Lowery, the Patriots' vice president of public
and community relations, the team backs Coates.
</P>
<P>
   ``Based on our knowledge of the incident, there is no reason for
the Patriots to take disciplinary action against Ben,'' Lowery
said.
</P>
<P>
   Their ``knowledge'' of the incident all but guarantees another
round of stories.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL; 
The CBS game plan
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   CBS Sports President Sean McManus recently told a group of
television reporters in Pasadena what to expect from the network's
return to covering professional football: ``Basically we don't want
to junk up the coverage of NFL football. The people at home want to
watch excellent NFL coverage like CBS used to do. We have all the
bells and whistles that we need with Silicon Graphics platforms,
brand new graphic machines and all sorts of new equipment. But I
want to make sure that our team realizes all that is nice, and it
makes the football telecast more enjoyable to watch, but the
fundamental coverage of football is the most important thing.''...
Howie Long signed a five-year deal with Fox Sports. The Emmy-award
winning studio analyst will join Terry Bradshaw, James Brown, and
Fox newcomer Cris Collinsworth on the set of ``Fox NFL Sunday.''
... ESPN Radio coverage of the NFL starts Sept. 6, with programming
from 11 a.m. to 7 p.m.

PATRIOTS STRUGGLED,   BUT THEY WEREN'T ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By NICK CAFARDO  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pittsburgh coach Bill Cowher was outraged by the performance of
the Steelers' defense in a 30-6 exhibition loss to the Tampa Bay
Buccaneers over the weekend. Green Bay's Mike Holmgren was
disgusted by his first offensive unit fumbling twice and digging
themselves in a 14-0 hole in their eventual 27-24 overtime win over
Kansas City in Tokyo. Marty Schottenheimer was going nutty on the
Chiefs' sidelines as he watched his team make numerous mistakes.
And San Francisco's Steve Mariucci wasn't thrilled with the number
of penalties and turnovers his team had in a 14-13 win over New
England Sunday at 3Com Park.
</P>
<P>
   Pete Carroll shouldn't feel alone, then. The same sense of
disappointment he felt following the Patriots' loss was shared in
other corners of the NFL among prominent teams who didn't play so
prominently.
</P>
<P>
   ``This clearly was a preseason game with many mistakes that you
might make under these conditions,'' said Patriots veteran
offensive tackle Zefross Moss, ``but the good thing is that they
are correctable.''
</P>
<P>
   Good thing there are four exhibition games left for the sake of
all of the teams who played over the weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately for the Packers and Chiefs, who had to return from
Tokyo, and the Patriots, who had to return from San Francisco,
practice time won't be aplenty this week. The Patriots don't return
to the field until this afternoon in preparation for Sunday night's
game vs. the Minnesota Vikings. And after that, they will spend
more time in the air heading to Mexico City in what already has
been a grueling preseason schedule.
</P>
<P>
   There are, however, some names and faces that Carroll had to be
particularly concerned about or pleased with Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   Here's a list:
</P>
<P>
   1. Drew Bledsoe.
</P>
<P>
   He participated in 21 plays and not many of them were very good.
He completed three of his nine passes and seemed completely out of
sync. Of course, whatever momentum he was building during the first
series (he had moved the Patriots from their 4 to the 36) was lost
when Sedrick Shaw fumbled the ball away. On the next possession,
Bledsoe misread a zone blitz and had a pass intended for Ben Coates
intercepted by defensive end Chris Doleman, who had that Kevan
Henry feeling of being totally shocked that the ball was heading
his way.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's still early, but we have to work on some things with our
passing game,'' said quarterback coach Jack Reilly.
</P>
<P>
   2. Terry Glenn.
</P>
<P>
   The 49ers played without Jerry Rice, and basically, the Patriots
played without Glenn. He never got open and Bledsoe never got the
ball to him.
</P>
<P>
   3. Tony Simmons.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Simmons was outstanding. Though he has taken
criticism for not running good routes, well, he ran good routes,
probably better than anyone else on the field. Simmons caught six
passes for 67 yards, and caught the ball in traffic and on slants
when he knew he was going to get crunched. One time he slipped on
the dirt infield and Scott Zolak had to throw the ball away.
</P>
<P>
   4. Lovett Purnell.
</P>
<P>
   The tight end was almost an afterthought last season because he
couldn't block well enough, but he caught five passes for 54 yards.
On second and 11 with 9:52 left in the game, he had the secondary
beaten but Zolak was under pressure and couldn't get him the ball.
It could have meant 6 points and a win.
</P>
<P>
   5. Tebucky Jones.
</P>
<P>
   He knocked down a couple of receivers and nobody got by him. He
was tough and covered well, and in the next four games he has a
great chance to win the starting job at right corner.
</P>
<P>
   ``He did some good things,'' said Carroll. ``For someone who
missed the first week of camp with an injury, he did some things we
thought he was capable of doing. We knew he was physical and he did
some physical things out there.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones's best work came on third and 10 on the 49ers' first
possession, when he covered Terrell Owens so well that Steve Young
had to throw the ball away.
</P>
<P>
   6. Chris Canty.
</P>
<P>
   On the flip side, Canty became a favorite target of the 49er
quarterbacks. He covered well at times but also got beat. His lack
of size became a factor late in the first quarter when, despite
pretty good coverage, a taller Mark Harris caught a 28-yard pass by
reaching higher for it, setting up the 49ers' first score.
</P>
<P>
   7. Sedrick Shaw.
</P>
<P>
   The Patriots tried to run the ball, and did so 32 times for a
2.8-yard average; their goal was 4 yards per carry. Shaw averaged 3
yards per carry and fumbled, which led to a 49er score. He did gain
9 yards on a pitchout and had a 1-yard touchdown run, but before he
makes people forget Curtis Martin, he must do something memorable.
</P>
<P>
   8. Robert Edwards.
</P>
<P>
   His groin is a problem again, and that's not good news. He
averaged 3.3 yards and had an 11-yarder among his six carries. He
also caught a pass but was really limited because of his injury.
</P>
<P>
   9. Greg Spires and Brandon Mitchell.
</P>
<P>
   The young defensive linemen showed some toughness. Spires sacked
Jim Druckenmiller for a 2-yard loss in the second quarter and on
the same series stuffed running back Corey Levy for a 3-yard loss.
In the fourth quarter, he stopped Reynard Rutherford for no gain,
and later in the quarter stopped him for only a 1-yard gain. Spires
is supposed to be a pass rusher, but he did a nice job stopping the
run.
</P>
<P>
   Mitchell looked quick inside, gave the Patriots good penetration
up the middle, and had an interception.
</P>
<P>
   10. Scott Zolak.
</P>
<P>
   He made one bad play _ fumbling in the end zone, which led to a
49er TD. Otherwise, he seemed to have grasped the offense better
than Bledsoe has at this stage. He missed Purnell wide open in the
fourth quarter, and on the final possession threw four straight
incompletions.
</P>
<P>
   11. Tom Tupa.
</P>
<P>
   He had two punts for a 62-yard average and landed one inside the
20. On the flip side, Mark Gagliano probably won't be around much
longer. He had two punts for a 31.5-yard average, one of which was
tipped after a high snap by Mike Bartrum. His kickoffs were poor
(the opening kickoff landed at the 20). Adam Vinatieri, trying to
battle through a groin pull, hit two of three field goal attempts,
missing a 47-yarder.
</P>
<P>
   12. Vernon Crawford.
</P>
<P>
   The second-year linebacker seemed to fly around on special teams
and also stopped Levy for a 1-yard loss in the second quarter. He
made a vicious hit on Iheanyi Uwaezuoke after an 18-yard punt
return right before the end of the first quarter. The Patriots
covered well on kicks and punts, while Derrick Cullors ran a
kickoff back 41 yards and may have broken it had he faked out the
kicker.
</P>
<P>
   13. Ted Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   He was his usual nasty self in limited playing time. He
pressured Druckenmiller into throwing an interception (to Chris
Slade).

 By KEVIN PAUL DUPONT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   AMHERST, N.H. _ There are a few game balls in Patrick Sullivan's
office here, and just a smattering of black-and-white photos of the
New England Patriots, all them taken before the local NFL team wore
the glittery, Vegas-like uniforms with the doo-wop Elvis look.
</P>
<P>
   The team Sullivan's father created, with its hunkered-down
minuteman logo, looks even more like a period piece in the fading
photographs. The Sullivans have been out of Foxborough, Mass. for
more than seven years now. William Sullivan, the patriarch and
founder of the original AFL franchise, died in February. What was
once a Sullivan family mom-and-pop shop is now part of the Robert
Kraft conglomerate, and all of Sullivan's six children have gone on
to other endeavors that don't bleed Patriot red, white, and blue.
</P>
<P>
   Kathleen (Alioto) is in San Francisco, where she is active in
educational issues. Her husband, Joseph Alioto, died in January at
age 81. Chuck practices law in Manhattan. Jeanie (McKeigue) is
director of community affairs at Boston College. Nancy
(Chamberlain), an interior designer, lives in Brookline, Mass.
Billy is a builder on Cape Cod. And Patrick, the youngest at age
45, makes the commute here from his home in Newton, Mass. most
every workday, for the most part following his father's
entrepreneurial footsteps.
</P>
<P>
   ``I grew up chasing footballs,'' said Patrick, president/owner
of Game Creek Video, a remote television production company. ``I
grew up in that business, so it's not like I got plunked in here
with my eyes opened wide by the excitement of TV. I didn't have a
need to get in the excitement business again _ it's not what makes
me tick.''
</P>
<P>
   Craving to own his own business, after a short run as a sports
business reporter at the Monitor Channel (``I was talent, and I put
big quote marks around the world `talent,''' said the self-effacing
Sullivan), he bought out Sure Shot Productions, a Youngstown, Ohio,
company that consisted of two TV production trucks and suffocating
debt. Sullivan's first task was to renegotiate the loan notes
attached to the truck. Now, nearly five years later, he plans to
add a fifth truck and he employs 15 workers full-time, including
Ray Cantwell, his vice president of operations, formerly the
Patriots' business manager.
</P>
<P>
   Game Creek's house specialty, as you might expect, is sports
broadcasting. Each of Sullivan's semis are booked upwards of 200
days per year, assisting in the TV broadcast of Major League
Baseball games, as well as the NFL, NBA, and NHL. There is also an
active market for soccer, horse racing, and golf, with the
occasional beauty pageant, QVC shopping event, or ballroom dancing
show. Most of the work comes in an expanded traingle that includes
Boston, Miami, and Chicago.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a good business, if it's run right,'' said Sullivan, who
spent some 15 years in the Patriots' front office, his latter years
spent as the club's general manager. ``And it's a business with
plenty or room to grow, because there's so much new sports business
invented every year, like, for example, the women's NBA: new
business. Then there's growing international business, too. NHK (a
Japanese TV network) always wants baseball games sent back when
there's a Japanese pitcher. Hideo Nomo getting traded to the Mets
was like another guy in the rotation for us.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
Foxborough memories
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   He isn't sure of the exact day he left Foxborough, where the
stadium once had the family name stapled on the side, but he
remembers it was January 1991. He wasn't certain of the future, but
he was sure the past was past. He was starting grade school when
his father brought pro football to Boston. He was nearing 40 and
slightly graying, an ex-NFL GM, when he pointed his car down Route
1 for the final drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I remember, really, is looking in the rear-view mirror and
thinking, `Well, this is the last time I'll do this,''' recalled
Sullivan. ``That's all ... and looking up at the stadium.''
</P>
<P>
   Sullivan's Game Creek trucks are now sometimes seen at what was
once Sullivan Stadium. He also still has six season tickets to each
game _ 12 rows up, midfield, the home team's side _ and takes in
three or four games each year. The rest go to clients. The only
emotional tug he has felt from the place since his working days, he
said, was when he recently took his three sons to a rock-and-roll
concert there.
</P>
<P>
   ``I walked in,'' he said, ``and I thought about my father.''
</P>
<P>
   William H. Sullivan Jr. was 82 when he succumbed to cancer.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been asked a lot over the years, do I miss the
Patriots,'' said Sullivan. ``And, sure, there's an element of the
business I really miss: It's very exciting, and it's a very
results-driven business. I liked all that. And I especially liked
some of the great, great people I worked with _ not just the
players, but front office and behind-the-scenes people. It was an
interesting group, and a lot of them started around '76 and we all
kind of grew up together on the job.''
</P>
<P>
   There was drudgery, too, for Sullivan, and many days it was
spelled out in hard print. His father was often a media target, for
a variety of reasons: the club's perennial failures, his
feistiness, his penchant for sometimes putting ego ahead of
substance.

KILLJOYS THROWING FAKE FAT ON THE FIRE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVEN LEVINGSTON  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Here I am again: sitting on my big buns in front of the TV for a
long, pleasant night of viewing. It's Tuesday and I think I'll
start off with ``Inside Edition,'' then indulge in ``Conan the
Barbarian,'' and round off the night with an episode of ``Cops''
and ``American Bandstand.'' It's pretty much like this every night
_ only the lineup of programs changes. The one thing that never
changes is my de rigueur snack food: fat-free potato chips made
with olestra.
</P>
<P>
   In case you didn't know, olestra chips are hot hot hot. Olestra
is a fake fat that tastes just like the real thing but, amazingly,
passes through the body without leaving a trace of fat or calories.
God bless Procter &AMP; Gamble, which concocted the stuff. I'm partial
to Frito-Lay's WOW chips, and I must say I'm right in fashion. In
the first eight weeks that WOW was on the shelves nationwide,
Frito-Lay pulled in nearly $60 million in sales, making the chips
among the best-selling new grocery products ever. All I can say is:
WOW.
</P>
<P>
   Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, I run off to the toilet all night long. I figure it keeps
me trim. And yeah, sometimes I double up on the sofa and shriek in
pain. But I knew what I was in for _ I saw the warning on the
package about abdominal cramping and loose stools. All's fair when
there's a warning. I got one on my Marlboros, too.
</P>
<P>
   Uh oh, excuse me, gotta go again.
</P>
<P>
   A few weeks ago I applauded when the Food and Drug
Administration finished its review of the fake fat and ruled that
the stuff isn't harmful. Maybe that'll shut up all the cry babies
out there.
</P>
<P>
   Since olestra hit the market in limited distribution two years
ago, some 5,000 sourpusses have whimpered that stuff made them
sick. That's the most complaints ever for a food additive.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the biggest bellyachers are the scientists, like Dr.
Walter Willet, head of the nutrition department at the Harvard
School of Public Health. He whines that olestra interferes with the
body's absorption of carotenoids, the stuff that makes fruits and
vegetables red, yellow, and orange and that helps reduce the risk
of cancer and other chronic diseases.
</P>
<P>
   You think Procter &AMP; Gamble is stupid? It knows all about that.
It's even said that a one-ounce bag of olestra chips reduces the
level of carotenoids in a person's blood by 50 percent. So what!
You still have the other 50 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Willet has the gall to suggest that long-term use of olestra
might cause thousands more cases of cancer and heart disease. What
a crank!
</P>
<P>
   I'll tell you the real reason I was applauding the FDA's vote of
confidence. When olestra was first rumored to exist I realized
Procter &AMP; Gamble was on to a good thing. I bought P&AMP;G stock, lots
of it. Now that the FDA has given its blessing, Frito-Lay's
olestra-packed snacks are on track for a straight shot to their
target of $800 million in sales within five years. Lots of people
buying WOW chips, lots of olestra pouring out of the P&AMP;G plants.
Why else would P&AMP;G stock have jumped more than 2 percent on the day
of the FDA ruling?
</P>
<P>
   So, please, just let me sit on my duff all night, enjoy ``Conan
the Barbarian,'' eat my potato chips, and never worry about getting
any tubbier. The only thing that's gonna get fat is my wallet.
</P>
<P>
   Now, excuse me. Gotta run.

ZOLL INVESTOR DRAWS FISCAL LINE IN THE SAND 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By STEVE BAILEY AND STEVEN SYRE  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Proxy statements make great summer reading.
</P>
<P>
   Here's just some of the interesting bits you could learn in a
few minutes spent with the report on Zoll Medical Corp., the small
money-losing Burlington,Mass. maker of heart defibrillators.
</P>
<P>
   _Rolf S. Stutz pulled down $250,000 as a part-time chairman and
chief executive last year. His night job: working as a venture
capitalist in a firm run by another Zoll director, Thomas M.
Claflin II.
</P>
<P>
   _Zoll made a $2 million investment in a start-up run by another
Zoll director, M. Stephen Heilman.
</P>
<P>
   _Willard M. Bright, an 83-year-old director and former chairman,
makes $50,000 a year as a consultant for the company.
</P>
<P>
   And the shareholders?
</P>
<P>
   The stock has fallen from more than 36 a share in 1994 to 7 3/16
Monday. Just last month Zoll paid an undisclosed sum to make some
unhappy shareholders and their class-action lawyers go away.
</P>
<P>
   Not all of them have gone away, however.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, one of Zoll's largest shareholders sued in US District
Court in Boston to invalidate the company's poison pill defense and
allow the investor to launch a proxy contest to elect two new
directors. The shareholder, an aggressive New York hedge fund
called Elliott Associates, says its directors may run on a platform
``to increase shareholder value.'' Read: Zoll management needs to
fix it or sell it.
</P>
<P>
   Zoll is one of a handful of players in the rapidly consolidating
business of defibrillators, devices that use electric shocks to
restart a stopped heart. A report published this year in the
medical journal Circulation estimated that greater use of
defibrillators by police and the public could save up to 24,000
lives annually in North America alone.
</P>
<P>
   But Zoll has struggled for several years now, the result of
strong competitors with newer technology, tough pricing pressures
in its core hospital market, and high overhead. Last year earnings
fell to 8 cents a share from 55 cents; just last month the company
said it lost 13 cents a share in the latest quarter compared with a
profit of 2 cents a year earlier.
</P>
<P>
   Zoll's problems look like opportunity to the publicity-shy Paul
Singer and his investment firm, Elliott Associates. Singer's hedge
fund started buying the stock in the middle of last year and now
holds more than 15 percent of the shares through two investment
vehicles.
</P>
<P>
   In a federal suit and in a filing with the Securities and
Exchange Commission Monday, Elliott Associates paints a picture of
itself as a shareholder frustrated by an entrenched management's
unwillingness to allow ``corporate democracy'' work. Singer might,
in fact, believe in democracy, but chances are he is at least as
interested in the triple he smells in Zoll's stock price.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Associates is a low-profile investor in
small-capitalization stocks that has shown it is willing to play
hardball. Last spring it threatened to launch a proxy fight to
oppose a reorganization by Avatex Corp., a Dallas company that
manages investments in several ventures, including Phar-Mor Inc.,
the drug-store chain. At about the same time, the chairman of the
Overseas Investment Trust &UR;  &LR; resigned after Elliott &UR;  &LR; Associates, its
largest shareholder, questioned how the London-based trust was
being restructured. Singer and Elliott led the unsecured creditors
committee in the messy bankruptcy at Trans World Airlines.
</P>
<P>
   In its suit, Elliott Associates says it called Zoll June 1cq to
ask the company to disclose details of its recent class-action
suit. Zoll executives refused to say when the information would be
disclosed, but Zoll did agree to meet with the Elliott investors in
about a week, the suit says.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Associates says that days after its call and before
their subsequent meeting in New York, the Zoll board passed an
antitakeover defense measure known as a poison pill, which the suit
says is ``specifically targeted'' at Elliott. The investment group
worries that its proxy attempt to elect two new directors could
trigger Zoll's poison pill, which would allow other shareholders to
buy Zoll stock at a 50 &UR;  &LR; percent discount and dilute Elliott's
holdings. Elliott wants the court to block Zoll's poison pill.
</P>
<P>
   Richard A. Packer, &UR;  &LR; Zoll's president, says the Elliott suit is
without merit and the poison pill is not aimed at any particular
shareholders. ``Our shareholders' rights plan is as common as most
shareholders' rights plans,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Associates and Packer seem to agree on one thing: There
is value in Zoll that has yet to be recognized by the market.
</P>
<P>
   Packer cites a new line of defibrillators and the restructuring
of the company's sales force into two divisions. Gene Gargiulo, an
analyst with G. Gargiulo &AMP; Co. in New York, agrees and estimates
Zoll should break even this year and earn 30 cents a share next
year. But he adds: ``It is going to be a real test of the sales
force after this reorganization to see if they can make it go.''
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Associates believes Zoll's operating expenses are way
out of line with its competitors and estimates as much as $5.5
million could be added to the bottom &UR;  &LR; line if costs were more in
line. Packer acknowledges costs have been pushed up to finance new
products and the remaking of the sales force.
</P>
<P>
   What is Zoll worth?
</P>
<P>
   Elliott Associates notes that two of the three publicly &UR;  &LR; traded
defibrillation companies have been or are in the process of being
acquired. Heartstream Inc. &UR;  &LR; was bought by Hewlett-Packard Co. for
about $140 million, &UR;  &LR; which would imply a Zoll share price of more
than $22 &UR;  &LR; a share, Elliott says. Physio-Control International
Corp. &UR;  &LR; is being acquired by Medtronic Inc. at more than $500
million, which would value Zoll at more than $21 a share.
</P>
<P>
   Packer won't comment on the potential for his company's stock
price. But he notes that a firm like Elliott Associates was
probably attracted to Zoll by just that kind of math.
</P>
<P>
   The rub comes in how you get there.

 By MIKHAIL GORBACHEV  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
 &HT;    As early as 1985, President Reagan and I, at our first summit,
said that nuclear war can never be won, and must never be fought.
Even then we knew something very important about the
inadmissibility of nuclear war.
 &HT;    Today, it is just as true that if nuclear war, on any scale,
were ever to be unleashed, or were ever to become a reality, it
would threaten the very existence of life on earth.
 &HT;    It is particularly important to keep this in mind, in the wake
of the nuclear tests by India and Pakistan. All must condemn those
tests and the dangerous era which they rekindle.
 &HT;    What is not being discussed by the established nuclear powers
today is that the process of nuclear disarmament has been stalled
for several years now; it is just marking time. I believe we have
not been properly using the opportunities that were open since the
end of the Cold War, the possibility to move toward a really new
world order based on stability, democratic cooperation and
equality, rather than on the hegemony of one country.
 &HT;    Instead, the geopolitical games are continuing; we are seeing
those old geopolitical games in places such as Bosnia, and we know
the dangerous potential of such conflicts. During the years of the
Cold War, many of those wars in small places festered for decades
and became worse because the two superpowers and the two military
alliances were self-interestedly fueling the hostilities.
 &HT;    During the years of the arms race, the United States and the
Soviet Union spent $10 trillion each on weapons production. It is
true that the danger of nuclear war has significantly diminished,
but it has not disappeared for good. The so-called conventional
wars and regional wars are still claiming thousands of human lives
and tremendous resources, as well as ravaging nature, the unique
source of life on our planet.
 &HT;    After the Cold War, instead of defense conversion, we are still
seeing the continuation of defense production, of the arms trade
and weapons-export policies. After the breakup of the Soviet Union,
while Russia was immersed in its domestic problems, the United
States captured 70 percent of the world weapons-trade market, while
not doing much for defense conversion.
 &HT;    The result is that Russia now too has decided to step up the
production and transfer of the most sophisticated weapons, and is
pushing in the same direction and trying to capture that market.
 &HT;    Behind this is the underlying assumption of defense and security
planning in most countries: that all the time we should consider
the possibility of war. Thus we see the arms race, weapons
production and also the increasing sophistication of arms,
including very exotic weapons.
 &HT;    And at the same time we see poverty, backwardness and disease in
territories that account for almost two-thirds of the population of
the world. So as we face the 21st century, let us think about what
is happening. It is a trap to perpetuate those systems that existed
during the Cold War _ relaunching the arms race and planning on the
supposition of a resumption of war.
 &HT;    We must say very firmly to the United States and Russia that in
dragging their feet on further nuclear disarmament, they are
setting a bad example for others.
 &HT;    We should also once again raise the issue of missiles,
intermediate- and shorter-range missiles, because those are weapons
of a particularly regional nature. We should do more not just to
limit the nuclear-arms race but even further to move toward the
elimination and abolition of nuclear arms.
 &HT;    Certainly we should bear in mind, in cooperating with
less-developed countries in the area of commercial nuclear power,
that we should always be vigilant that this is not taken further,
and does not stimulate the production of nuclear weapons.
 &HT;    Finally, we should put an end to the myth that nuclear weapons
guarantee peace. Everyone, for example, should understand that
security on the Indian subcontinent has not improved because of
recent developments; it has deteriorated very sharply.
 &HT;    We should do all we can to help Pakistan and India understand
that they're not gaining anything. They're actually losing a lot by
embarking on the nuclear path. In the context of the conflict that
has been festering in that region, this is really an ominous
development. We should work very hard to ensure that India and
Pakistan sign without delay the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty.
 &HT;    The 20th century has seen more bloodshed and cruelty than the
whole rest of human history and left us a complex and challenging
heritage. The tradition of resolving national and international
problems by force, violence and arms is a political disease of our
epoch. We must do away with it _ which is the great and noble
imperative of our time.

<TEXT>
 &UR; (Distributed by New York Times Special Features) &LR;  &QC;
<P>
   This year is the tenth anniversary of my book, ``A Brief History
of Time.'' Appropriately enough, it was first published on April
Fool's Day, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the book developed from lectures I gave at Harvard
in 1982. By 1984 I had a first draft and began to consider whom I
should get to publish it.
</P>
<P>
   My previous academic books had been published by Cambridge
University Press. They had done a very good job, but I didn't feel
they had the right approach for the mass market. I told my literary
agent that I wanted my book on airport bookstalls. The agent made
polite noises, but clearly didn't think this was possible.
Nevertheless, he got me several offers.
</P>
<P>
   I picked Bantam because of their strength in the mass market; I
have never regretted my choice. They assigned me a fine editor,
Peter Guzzardi, who made me rewrite my first draft in terms that he
could understand. He also had the bright idea of changing the
title. My original idea had been, ``From The Big Bang To Black
Holes, A Short History Of Time.'' But Peter changed it to ``A Brief
History Of Time.'' I am sure this title has helped.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after I met Guzzardi I caught pneumonia while at the
European Center for Nuclear Research in Geneva. For a time my life
was despaired of. In the end, they had to perform a tracheostomy
operation, which removed my power of speech altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, I had been able to dictate to a secretary who could
understand me, but for a time, I could communicate only by raising
my eyebrows when someone pointed to letters on a card. At that
rate, it would have taken until the next millennium to finish my
book.
</P>
<P>
   However, a software developer called Walt Waltosz heard of my
plight, and provided me with a computer and a program that allowed
me to scan the screen and select words, which are printed on the
bottom half of the screen. Over the years, the system has
developed. My present version was made for me by Intel. It has a
mobile telephone, with access to the internet.
</P>
<P>
   I can claim to be the most connected person in the world. I have
kept my original speech synthesizer, however, partly because I
haven't heard one with better phrasing, and partly because I now
identify with this voice, despite its American accent. But the
speech synthesizer uses chips which are now obsolete, so I will
have to change eventually. That will bring a real identity crisis,
especially for my wife, who won't recognize me.
</P>
<P>
   With the computer system, I was able to finish ``A Brief
History'' and it was duly published. Despite wanting it sold on
airport bookstalls, I had expected it to be only modestly
successful. So I was surprised by its reception. It was on the
Sunday London Times' bestseller list for 237 weeks, longer than any
other book in history. (Apparently, the Bible and Shakespeare don't
count).
</P>
<P>
   And it has been translated into more than 30 languages. This
means I am recognized wherever I go, though sometimes I try to
disguise myself by saying that I am often mistaken for Hawking.
</P>
<P>
   Why was ``A Brief History'' such a success? A contributing
element must be the fact that I am disabled, or should I say,
physically challenged, to be politically correct. But the main
reason was that the public was hungry for a book of this type.
There were already many books about the early universe and black
holes on the market, ranging from the very good to the very bad.
However, I felt that none of these really addressed the big
questions which had led me to do research in cosmology and quantum
theory.
</P>
<P>
   People have always wanted answers to the big questions. Where
did we come from? How did the world begin? What is the meaning and
design behind it all? The creation accounts of the past now seem
less credible. They have been replaced by a variety of
superstitions, ranging from New Age to ``Star Trek.'' But real
science can be far stranger than science fiction, and much more
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that most people believe that real science is too
difficult for them. But I don't think this is the case. Not
everyone can be or wants to be a theoretical physicist, but most
people can understand the basic ideas, if they are presented
clearly without equations.
</P>
<P>
   Humanity is making great advances in science and technology, and
the pace of change is quickening. I recently gave a lecture at the
White House to an audience that included the Clintons. I argued
that we will never reach a state of advanced, but essentially
static science and technology, like that shown in ``Star Trek.''
Instead, progress will continue at an ever increasing rate.
</P>
<P>
   In this situation, it is vital that we all take part in the
debate about where we are going. We don't want the knowledge and
the decisions to be left to a few experts.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that people buy my book to leave on their
coffee tables. I am sure this does happen, but it is not the reason
for most of my sales. Hundreds of people write to me or stop me in
the street, to tell me how they have enjoyed it. They ask detailed
questions, or point out what they think are errors, so they must
have read at least part of it.
</P>
<P>
   I can't answer all the letters, but I try to correct genuine
errors. By now, most of them have been fixed, although I recently
got a long letter from a lady in Toronto complaining about
something I said about Aristotle.
</P>
<P>
   I know the book is difficult. If you can understand everything
in it, you would be ready to start a Ph.D. in theoretical physics.
It does not matter too much if people can't follow all the
arguments. They can still get the flavor of the intellectual quest:
to understand the universe on the basis of rational laws.
</P>
<P>
   So what has happened in the 10 years since ``A Brief History''
was first published? Should I write a sequel, and if so, what would
I call it? ``A Brief History of Time, Part 2.'' Or maybe, ``A
Slightly Less Brief History.'' However, I decided against both
these possibilities. Everything I wrote in the original book is
still valid. It just required extending, to include the exciting
observational and theoretical developments over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the observational side, there has not been much progress in
conventional particle physics. The United States was building a new
particle accelerator, the SSC, which would have reached the
energies where crucial evidence for our theories was expected.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, the United States went through a fit of feeling
poor and cancelled the project. I told President Clinton that this
was a very short-sighted decision. His defense was that he had been
in favor of the SSC, but that it was cut by Congress. This is true,
but I think he could have fought harder. As it is, we will have to
wait until 2001 for a new particle accelerator in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   In cosmology, on the other hand, there has been spectacular
progress on the observational front. The Hubble space telescope,
and new large land-based telescopes such as the Keck telescope in
Hawaii, have enabled us to see galaxies and supernova near to the
limiting distance we can observe.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important, we have detected faint ripples in the
background of microwaves that fills the universe. These ripples are
tiny _ one part in 100,000 _ but are evidence that the early
universe was not homogeneous. These small variations in the makeup
of the early universe are big enough to have grown into the
structures we observe in the universe, such as galaxies, stars and
even ourselves. So we are seeing in these ripples the finger prints
of creation.
</P>
<P>
   The form of the ripples is consistent with the theory of
inflation _ the idea that the universe had a period of accelerating
expansion, in the very early stages. And it agrees with the
proposal that I made, that the universe has no boundaries, in space
and imaginary time.
</P>
<P>
   But it is inconsistent with most alternative theories of the
origins of the ripples. Observations of the microwave background by
new satellites should settle the issue and tell us if we indeed
live in a universe that has no boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The ripples in the microwave background had been predicted. It
was gratifying to have our theories confirmed, but it was not a
great surprise. The really exciting moments in science are when we
discover something unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not definite yet, there are suggestions in some
recent observations of supernova that there may be a repulsive
gravitational force called the cosmological constant. Einstein
originally introduced the constant into his equations, when he
still believed that the universe was static. If the galaxies
started off at rest relative to each other, the gravitational
attraction between them would cause them to fall towards each
other, unless it was balanced by a repulsive force.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hubble later discovered that the universe is expanding,
and so removed the need for a cosmological constant to hold the
universe in a static equilibrium. After that, Einstein called the
cosmological constant ``my greatest mistake.'' But we may have to
think again; Einstein may not have made a mistake after all. This
would mean that the universe would continue to expand forever, at
an ever-increasing rate. Inflation might be a law of nature, to the
discomfiture of monetarist economics. But the inflation of the
universe is less than a millionth of a percent per century.
</P>
<P>
   Today the progress we are making is helped by the fact that all
theoretical physics papers are now on the internet. It has made
physicists the world over into a global village. If someone has a
new idea, they send it to a computer in Los Alamos. Within a week,
there will be several developments to the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years ago, I said I thought there was a 50 percent chance
that we would find a complete unified theory in the next 20 years.
I would have lost that bet. Thanks to what's gone on recently in
time, I think it's more likely we'll find it in the next 20 years.

<P>
   This year is the tenth anniversary of my book, ``A Brief History
of Time.'' Appropriately enough, it was first published on April
Fool's Day, 1988.
</P>
<P>
   The idea of the book developed from lectures I gave at Harvard
in 1982. By 1984 I had a first draft and began to consider whom I
should get to publish it.
</P>
<P>
   My previous academic books had been published by Cambridge
University Press. They had done a very good job, but I didn't feel
they had the right approach for the mass market. I told my literary
agent that I wanted my book on airport bookstalls. The agent made
polite noises, but clearly didn't think this was possible.
Nevertheless, he got me several offers.
</P>
<P>
   I picked Bantam because of their strength in the mass market; I
have never regretted my choice. They assigned me a fine editor,
Peter Guzzardi, who made me rewrite my first draft in terms that he
could understand. He also had the bright idea of changing the
title. My original idea had been, ``From The Big Bang To Black
Holes, A Short History Of Time.'' But Peter changed it to ``A Brief
History Of Time.'' I am sure this title has helped.
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after I met Guzzardi I caught pneumonia while at the
European Center for Nuclear Research in Geneva. For a time my life
was despaired of. In the end, they had to perform a tracheostomy
operation, which removed my power of speech altogether.
</P>
<P>
   Before that, I had been able to dictate to a secretary who could
understand me, but for a time, I could communicate only by raising
my eyebrows when someone pointed to letters on a card. At that
rate, it would have taken until the next millennium to finish my
book.
</P>
<P>
   However, a software developer called Walt Waltosz heard of my
plight, and provided me with a computer and a program that allowed
me to scan the screen and select words, which are printed on the
bottom half of the screen. Over the years, the system has
developed. My present version was made for me by Intel. It has a
mobile telephone, with access to the internet.
</P>
<P>
   I can claim to be the most connected person in the world. I have
kept my original speech synthesizer, however, partly because I
haven't heard one with better phrasing, and partly because I now
identify with this voice, despite its American accent. But the
speech synthesizer uses chips which are now obsolete, so I will
have to change eventually. That will bring a real identity crisis,
especially for my wife, who won't recognize me.
</P>
<P>
   With the computer system, I was able to finish ``A Brief
History'' and it was duly published. Despite wanting it sold on
airport bookstalls, I had expected it to be only modestly
successful. So I was surprised by its reception. It was on the
Sunday London Times' bestseller list for 237 weeks, longer than any
other book in history. (Apparently, the Bible and Shakespeare don't
count).
</P>
<P>
   And it has been translated into more than 30 languages. This
means I am recognized wherever I go, though sometimes I try to
disguise myself by saying that I am often mistaken for Hawking.
</P>
<P>
   Why was ``A Brief History'' such a success? A contributing
element must be the fact that I am disabled, or should I say,
physically challenged, to be politically correct. But the main
reason was that the public was hungry for a book of this type.
There were already many books about the early universe and black
holes on the market, ranging from the very good to the very bad.
However, I felt that none of these really addressed the big
questions which had led me to do research in cosmology and quantum
theory.
</P>
<P>
   People have always wanted answers to the big questions. Where
did we come from? How did the world begin? What is the meaning and
design behind it all? The creation accounts of the past now seem
less credible. They have been replaced by a variety of
superstitions, ranging from New Age to ``Star Trek.'' But real
science can be far stranger than science fiction, and much more
satisfying.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is that most people believe that real science is too
difficult for them. But I don't think this is the case. Not
everyone can be or wants to be a theoretical physicist, but most
people can understand the basic ideas, if they are presented
clearly without equations.
</P>
<P>
   Humanity is making great advances in science and technology, and
the pace of change is quickening. I recently gave a lecture at the
White House to an audience that included the Clintons. I argued
that we will never reach a state of advanced, but essentially
static science and technology, like that shown in ``Star Trek.''
Instead, progress will continue at an ever increasing rate.
</P>
<P>
   In this situation, it is vital that we all take part in the
debate about where we are going. We don't want the knowledge and
the decisions to be left to a few experts.
</P>
<P>
   It has been said that people buy my book to leave on their
coffee tables. I am sure this does happen, but it is not the reason
for most of my sales. Hundreds of people write to me or stop me in
the street, to tell me how they have enjoyed it. They ask detailed
questions, or point out what they think are errors, so they must
have read at least part of it.
</P>
<P>
   I can't answer all the letters, but I try to correct genuine
errors. By now, most of them have been fixed, although I recently
got a long letter from a lady in Toronto complaining about
something I said about Aristotle.
</P>
<P>
   I know the book is difficult. If you can understand everything
in it, you would be ready to start a Ph.D. in theoretical physics.
It does not matter too much if people can't follow all the
arguments. They can still get the flavor of the intellectual quest:
to understand the universe on the basis of rational laws.
</P>
<P>
   So what has happened in the 10 years since ``A Brief History''
was first published? Should I write a sequel, and if so, what would
I call it? ``A Brief History of Time, Part 2.'' Or maybe, ``A
Slightly Less Brief History.'' However, I decided against both
these possibilities. Everything I wrote in the original book is
still valid. It just required extending, to include the exciting
observational and theoretical developments over the last 10 years.
</P>
<P>
   On the observational side, there has not been much progress in
conventional particle physics. The United States was building a new
particle accelerator, the SSC, which would have reached the
energies where crucial evidence for our theories was expected.
</P>
<P>
   But in 1994, the United States went through a fit of feeling
poor and cancelled the project. I told President Clinton that this
was a very short-sighted decision. His defense was that he had been
in favor of the SSC, but that it was cut by Congress. This is true,
but I think he could have fought harder. As it is, we will have to
wait until 2001 for a new particle accelerator in Geneva.
</P>
<P>
   In cosmology, on the other hand, there has been spectacular
progress on the observational front. The Hubble space telescope,
and new large land-based telescopes such as the Keck telescope in
Hawaii, have enabled us to see galaxies and supernova near to the
limiting distance we can observe.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important, we have detected faint ripples in the
background of microwaves that fills the universe. These ripples are
tiny _ one part in 100,000 _ but are evidence that the early
universe was not homogeneous. These small variations in the makeup
of the early universe are big enough to have grown into the
structures we observe in the universe, such as galaxies, stars and
even ourselves. So we are seeing in these ripples the finger prints
of creation.
</P>
<P>
   The form of the ripples is consistent with the theory of
inflation _ the idea that the universe had a period of accelerating
expansion, in the very early stages. And it agrees with the
proposal that I made, that the universe has no boundaries, in space
and imaginary time.
</P>
<P>
   But it is inconsistent with most alternative theories of the
origins of the ripples. Observations of the microwave background by
new satellites should settle the issue and tell us if we indeed
live in a universe that has no boundaries.
</P>
<P>
   The ripples in the microwave background had been predicted. It
was gratifying to have our theories confirmed, but it was not a
great surprise. The really exciting moments in science are when we
discover something unexpected.
</P>
<P>
   Although it is not definite yet, there are suggestions in some
recent observations of supernova that there may be a repulsive
gravitational force called the cosmological constant. Einstein
originally introduced the constant into his equations, when he
still believed that the universe was static. If the galaxies
started off at rest relative to each other, the gravitational
attraction between them would cause them to fall towards each
other, unless it was balanced by a repulsive force.
</P>
<P>
   However, Hubble later discovered that the universe is expanding,
and so removed the need for a cosmological constant to hold the
universe in a static equilibrium. After that, Einstein called the
cosmological constant ``my greatest mistake.'' But we may have to
think again; Einstein may not have made a mistake after all. This
would mean that the universe would continue to expand forever, at
an ever-increasing rate. Inflation might be a law of nature, to the
discomfiture of monetarist economics. But the inflation of the
universe is less than a millionth of a percent per century.
</P>
<P>
   Today the progress we are making is helped by the fact that all
theoretical physics papers are now on the internet. It has made
physicists the world over into a global village. If someone has a
new idea, they send it to a computer in Los Alamos. Within a week,
there will be several developments to the idea.

that we would find a complete unified theory in the next 20 years.
I would have lost that bet. Thanks to what's gone on recently in

 AT CZAR NICHOLAS' BURIAL: THE COFFIN TABLE COLLAPSES, AN AIRPORT
`WELCOME' SIGN COMES DOWN and `THE BOSS' SHOWS UP  
 By VIKTORIA VOLOSHINA  
 c.1998 Moscow News  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)

<P>
   ST. PETERSBURG, Russia _ The state earmarked 5 million rubles
for the farewell ceremony. In Russia nowadays, that's neither big
nor small money. But it wasn't placed in the account of the city
administration until word came that President Boris Yeltsin was
going to St. Petersburg after all.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the remains were to arrive, those making
arrangements for the ceremony saw to their consternation a
``Welcome'' sign on top of the Pulkovo airport building. They
hastily daubed the sign over with white paint, pinned black ribbons
on the Russian flags displayed along the route of the motorcade and
had traffic policemen don smart uniforms, gray at the bottom and
white at the top. That ended the dressing-up phase of preparations
for the ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   The special flight from Yekaterinburg carrying the Czar and his
family and servants arrived 90 minutes late on July 16. In the
meantime, the ceremony's organizers and journalists learned that
Yeltsin had decided to attend the burial. Too weary of waiting, or
maybe overcome by the stunning news, the table draped in black and
prepared for the coffins collapsed. While attendants were putting
the table back on its feet, the plane landed and the festivities
proceeded as planned.
</P>
<P>
   Russia's heraldry chief Georgi Vilinbakhov reported to the St.
Petersburg mayor that the coffins with the remains had been
delivered to St. Petersburg soil. Nine oak coffins were loaded onto
black hearses and the procession moved solemnly past the Bronze
Horseman and Winter Palace and on toward the SS Peter and Paul
Fortress.
</P>
<P>
   The coffins were finally set on a black podium in the main hall
of the cathedral inside the fortress. The journalists who had
already managed to take pictures of the emotional faces of members
of the Romanov House _ more than 60 of them, who now live around
the world, now on hand in St. Petersburg _ were briefly admittd.
Honor guards were posted around the coffins where they stayed in
the cathedral through the night, changing every hour.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, people of St. Petersburg turned out by the
thousands to station themselves on all sides of Zayachy Island, on
which the fortress stands. There was not much argument on whether
the remains were genuine, they were mainly discussing the
president's unpredictability.
</P>
<P>
   ``What if he is not coming at all?'' someone ventured a guess,
and the crowd before the bridge to the fortress sealed off by the
security service buzzed. ``What do you mean, he is not coming? Did
he come yet? He's on his way?''
</P>
<P>
   Under the impact of the crowd, a security officer, who must have
momentarily forgotten that he was a military man and should stay
cool, absolutely assured the agitated people: ``The boss will
appear at the last moment.''
</P>
<P>
   And he was right. Yeltsin appeared on the scene three minutes
before noon, July 17. He entered the cathedral through a side door
bypassing the TV cameras. As the clock struck 12, a cannon fired,
the bells started ringing again and the frightened birds shot from
the cathedral's chapel and began to wheel above the square in a
black swarm.
</P>
<P>
   The crowd included Boris Nemtsov, Natalia Dementeva, Mstislav
Rastropovich, Galina Vishnevskaya, Eduard Radzinsky, Nikita
Mikhalkov, Andrei Petrov, Dmitriy Likhachev, Galina Starovoitova,
Grigori Yavlinsky, Alexei Mitrofanov and Lyudmila Narusova. At the
last moment Alexander Lebed joined them, sailing over the police
barrier behind which journalists were languishing.
</P>
<P>
   Yeltsin never turned his head. He was already standing on the
pedestal preparing to deliver his address. ``It is our duty to
complete the century, which has proved for Russia a century of
blood and lawlessness, by repentance and reconciliation regardless
of (our) political views,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   It's a pity though that the president was reading the words of
repentance from a prepared text. More than that, pressing his hand
to his heart and bowing low to the coffins with royal remains,
Yeltsin never uttered the names of the Romanovs murdered by the
Bolsheviks, diplomatically substituting for them with the
patriarch's formula _ ``those slain without guilt.''
</P>
<P>
   In the service for the dead conducted by the dean of the SS
Peter and Paul Cathedral, Archpriest Boris Glebov, the names of the
dead were not mentioned either, making a reference to God _ ``Their
names are known to our Lord Himself.'' Thus the question ``Are they
the right bones?'' that hovered around the Yekaterinburg graveside
find throughout recent years remained unanswered even at the time
of the interment.
</P>
<P>
   The only person who mentioned the emperor, his consort, their
daughters and the servants who remained loyal to the end was St.
Petersburg's Gov. Vladimir Yakovlev. He kept his promise to do his
utmost to prevent the burial ceremony turning into a political
show, reacting with restraint to the daily wavering moods of the
well-known Russian politicians and colleagues in the Federation
Council _ ``let everyone make up their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The coffins were put in three tiers in the crypt of the St.
Catherine side chapel _ the servants' remains, at the bottom; those
of the daughters, in the second tier; and those of the emperor and
empress, at the top. The black and yellow royal standards that
covered the coffins during the two days of the burial ceremony were
removed and handed as a gift to the city history museum. A Russian
officer sword _ an exact replica of the 1909 weapon made by St.
Petersburg armorers _ was put into the crypt next to the coffin of
Nicholas II.
</P>
<P>
   The moment the emperor's coffin was being buried there was a
19-gun salute. Everyone present in the Cathedral threw a handful of
river sand from containers set nearby on tripods. The crypt was
covered with concrete slabs, a temporary timber pedestal was
erected with a canopy supported by four pillars which will be
replaced a year from now with marble ones. A long string of
mourners filed past the tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing for the last time before the tomb, Yeltsin went to the
head of the House of Romanov, Nikolai Romanovich Romanov. True, the
prince was so excited at that moment that he could not later answer
what precisely the president said to him without any official
protocol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember. I was holding his hand in my hands and I did
not even believe that this was really happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yeltsins walked past the tomb, followed by members of
official delegations. And there came an embarrassment the
organizers could not prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in an era in which etiquette was taught only at the
Foreign Relations Institute and all Christian customs were
discouraged, nearly all of Russia's VIPs were making the sign of
the cross, not always sure about the sequence, and stealing glances
at what their counterparts were doing. They were handing each other
funeral tapers over the heads of the people standing next to them
and lighting them as they would cigarettes from one another's
light.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the burial ceremony, Culture Minister
Natalia Dementeva wore a trouser-suit to the church, and on the day
of the burial forgot to wear a black suit, or at least wear a black
veil over her head. Thus, the culture minister's fair hair looked
especially conspicuous against the backdrop of the black hats of
the Romanovs.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Nemtsov, head of the state burial commission, was rather
pleased: ``It went off excellently, I feared it would be worse. So,
one more commission bit the dust.''
</P>
<P>
   The relations and officials boarded the violet-colored buses and
left for the Ethnographic Museum for the funeral repast.
</P>
<P>
   Red wine, Peter the Great vodka, with snacks whose names sounded
inappropriately amusing for the occasion, could not make the repast
mournful. Quite the opposite, as the head of the Romanovs admitted,
some joyful animation prevailed. The toasts to the dead were
followed by those to the successful completion of the event, the
dignified and conscientious organization of the burial, to the wise
decision of the president and political restraint of the St.
Petersburg governor.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, July 18, the SS Peter and Paul Cathedral was open
to the public. Despite the pouring rain, the line extended almost
around the entire Zayachy Island. Foreign tourists waited in their
buses for the rain to end and eagerly bought the freshly painted
nests of dolls made in the likeness of Boris Yeltsin and Nicholas
II.
</P>
<P>
   The important state event, solemn but without pomp and
circumstance, was a great success.

show, reacting with restraint to the daily wavering moods of the
well-known Russian politicians and colleagues in the Federation
Council _ ``let everyone make up their mind.''
</P>
<P>
   The coffins were put in three tiers in the crypt of the St.
Catherine side chapel _ the servants' remains, at the bottom; those
of the daughters, in the second tier; and those of the emperor and
empress, at the top. The black and yellow royal standards that
covered the coffins during the two days of the burial ceremony were
removed and handed as a gift to the city history museum. A Russian
officer sword _ an exact replica of the 1909 weapon made by St.
Petersburg armorers _ was put into the crypt next to the coffin of
Nicholas II.
</P>
<P>
   The moment the emperor's coffin was being buried there was a
19-gun salute. Everyone present in the Cathedral threw a handful of
river sand from containers set nearby on tripods. The crypt was
covered with concrete slabs, a temporary timber pedestal was
erected with a canopy supported by four pillars which will be
replaced a year from now with marble ones. A long string of
mourners filed past the tomb.
</P>
<P>
   Bowing for the last time before the tomb, Yeltsin went to the
head of the House of Romanov, Nikolai Romanovich Romanov. True, the
prince was so excited at that moment that he could not later answer
what precisely the president said to him without any official
protocol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't remember. I was holding his hand in my hands and I did
not even believe that this was really happening.''
</P>
<P>
   The Yeltsins walked past the tomb, followed by members of
official delegations. And there came an embarrassment the
organizers could not prevent.
</P>
<P>
   Raised in an era in which etiquette was taught only at the
Foreign Relations Institute and all Christian customs were
discouraged, nearly all of Russia's VIPs were making the sign of
the cross, not always sure about the sequence, and stealing glances
at what their counterparts were doing. They were handing each other
funeral tapers over the heads of the people standing next to them
and lighting them as they would cigarettes from one another's
light.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of the burial ceremony, Culture Minister
Natalia Dementeva wore a trouser-suit to the church, and on the day
of the burial forgot to wear a black suit, or at least wear a black
veil over her head. Thus, the culture minister's fair hair looked
especially conspicuous against the backdrop of the black hats of
the Romanovs.
</P>
<P>
   Boris Nemtsov, head of the state burial commission, was rather
pleased: ``It went off excellently, I feared it would be worse. So,
one more commission bit the dust.''
</P>
<P>
   The relations and officials boarded the violet-colored buses and
left for the Ethnographic Museum for the funeral repast.
</P>
<P>
   Red wine, Peter the Great vodka, with snacks whose names sounded
inappropriately amusing for the occasion, could not make the repast
mournful. Quite the opposite, as the head of the Romanovs admitted,
some joyful animation prevailed. The toasts to the dead were
followed by those to the successful completion of the event, the
dignified and conscientious organization of the burial, to the wise
decision of the president and political restraint of the St.
Petersburg governor.
</P>
<P>
   The next day, July 18, the SS Peter and Paul Cathedral was open
to the public. Despite the pouring rain, the line extended almost
around the entire Zayachy Island. Foreign tourists waited in their
buses for the rain to end and eagerly bought the freshly painted
nests of dolls made in the likeness of Boris Yeltsin and Nicholas
II.
</P>
<P>
   The important state event, solemn but without pomp and
circumstance, was a great success.

   WASHINGTON _ In 1970, at age 17, Bartolo Lopez crossed into the
United States with barely enough money to pay the ``coyote'' _
immigrant slang for the guide hired to take Mexicans across the
U.S. border.
</P>
<P>
   At first, like many Mexican immigrants, Lopez labored in the
strawberry fields of northern California, but soon found work with
a Japanese gardener who taught him landscape design: skills such as
reading blueprints, placing boulders and creating waterfalls.
</P>
<P>
   Today Lopez owns 3 Pinos Landscaping, a landscape design and
maintenance firm that takes in $2 million a year creating backyard
Xanadus for the San Fernando Valley's upper crust.
</P>
<P>
   Lopez is not unique. Quietly and almost without notice,
Hispanics have emerged as the nation's fastest-growing pool of
business owners. Indeed, Hispanics already own 43 percent more U.S.
companies than Asians, widely known for their prolific business
formation, and 225,000 more businesses than blacks, who make up a
larger share of the population.
</P>
<P>
   From 1987 to 1992, the last year for which Census Bureau
statistics are available, the number of U.S. businesses owned by
Hispanics increased by 76 percent, almost three times the 26
percent growth rate for all U.S. businesses. Total annual receipts
for Hispanic-owned companies more than doubled, from $33 billion in
1987 to $76 billion in 1992, while annual receipts for all U.S.
companies grew by only 67 percent.
</P>
<P>
   And in the space of a decade, from 1982 to 1992, the number of
Hispanic-owned businesses nearly quadrupled. The U.S. Hispanic
Chamber of Commerce estimates that Hispanics now own 1.3 million
businesses generating more than $200 billion in annual revenue.
</P>
<P>
   In California, newer immigrant start-ups _ many run by Mexicans
_ have helped the state rebound from its long economic slump.
</P>
<P>
   According to the Center for the Study of Latino Health at the
University of California at Los Angeles, the number of
Hispanic-owned businesses in Los Angeles has nearly doubled since
1992, from 109,000 to 210,000.
</P>
<P>
   Many of these new businesses are located in South Central L.A.,
where small Hispanic-owned retail shops and minimarts have replaced
many of the storefronts destroyed during the 1992 riots. They cater
to a Latino population that has ascended to the majority in the
once predominately black community. This, in turn, has created a
new class of entrepreneurs: Latino middlemen who leverage their
education and knowledge of the Latino community into lucrative
consulting work for major corporations that want insight into
Hispanic consumer behavior.
</P>
<P>
   One such entrepreneur is Jose Legaspi. A Mexican immigrant
himself, Legaspi started his real-estate development and consulting
firm in the late 1970s when he recognized the growing need for
goods, services and jobs within underserved Latino communities. Now
he develops new shopping centers in these communities and advises
national chains such as Blockbuster Video and McDonald's.
</P>
<P>
   The Latino entrepreneurial spirit is transforming other cities
as well. In Chicago, Hispanic jewelers, restaurateurs and clothing
retailers control commerce along 26th Street, generating sales-tax
revenue second only to Chicago's wealthiest retail strip, Michigan
Avenue. In the Back-of-the-Yards section of town, named for its
proximity to Chicago's stockyards, a flood of Hispanic businesses
has revived a neighborhood deserted by Eastern Europeans.
</P>
<P>
   Miami, of course, is home to the larger, more well-established
companies started by the Cubans who fled Fidel Castro's Communist
regime in the late 1960s. Unlike most Hispanic immigrants living in
the United States, they were well-educated professionals and
businessmen in their homeland who, upon settling in Miami, set
about establishing an infrastructure of Latino commerce and
culture. More than three decades later, Miami possesses the flavor
of a Latin-American city and the bustle of an international trading
hub.
</P>
<P>
   A common stereotype is that minority-owned businesses owe their
growth to government contracts and affirmative-action policies, and
some do. But the majority of Hispanic-owned businesses do not
depend on government assistance. And even though the Hispanic
business world is larger than that of blacks, Hispanics ask for and
receive fewer government contracts. Only 25 percent of the
businesses certified to participate in the Small Business
Administration's 8(a) program, which reserves a portion of federal
contracts to minority-owned companies, are owned by Hispanics; 45
percent are owned by blacks.
</P>
<P>
   Unfortunately, political leaders and advocacy groups still treat
Hispanics as a beleaguered minority in need of preferential
treatment, instead of as the upwardly mobile immigrant group they
have become. This attitude risks cultivating an entitlement culture
rather than one of can-do entrepreneurialism within the Hispanic
community.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, many Hispanics seem more intent on self-reliance
than on playing racial politics.

A QUIET PRACTITIONER AMID A STORM OF ANTI-ABORTION PROTESTS 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEPHANIE SALTER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ To anti-abortion activists, he is a mass
murderer. But to a 12-year-old Michigan girl and her parents, he is
one of the few shafts of light in an unbelievably dark nightmare.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. George Tiller, one of only a handful of physicians in the
nation who perform abortion in the third trimester, apparently
ended the pregnancy of the adolescent Detroit-area girl last week
at his women's health clinic in Wichita, Kan.
</P>
<P>
   Reportedly impregnated by her 17-year-old brother, the girl did
not learn she was pregnant until July 6, when her fetus already was
in its 26th week of gestation.
</P>
<P>
   A 1974 Michigan law prohibits abortion after the 24th week of
pregnancy unless the mother will die without the procedure. So the
girl's parents made plans to travel to Kansas where, thanks to a
new law that is still under interpretation, late-term abortions are
being performed under certain circumstances.
</P>
<P>
   A family member notified Michigan authorities, however, and the
state stepped in at prosecutors' request on July 17 and blocked the
trip pending psychological evaluation of the girl.
</P>
<P>
   A week later a judge cleared the way, and late last week an
attorney for the girl's family confirmed that she had received an
abortion at Tiller's clinic.
</P>
<P>
   If an Oregon woman named Rachelle Shannon were a better shot,
Tiller might not have been around to help the Michigan family. Five
years ago this month, Shannon ended a day of protest outside the
Women's Health Care Services in Wichita by shooting Tiller in both
arms.
</P>
<P>
   A veteran of vandalism at nine abortion clinics throughout the
country, Shannon was sentenced to 10 years. Tiller, his arms
bandaged, returned to work the day after the shooting.
</P>
<P>
   The son of a Wichita physician, Tiller, 57, received his medical
degree from the University of Kansas in 1967. He served as a U.S.
Navy flight surgeon in Oakland, Calif., from 1969 to 1970. That
year, his parents and a sister were killed in a plane crash and he
moved home to Wichita to care for his sister's baby and his elderly
grandmother. He founded his clinic in 1975.
</P>
<P>
   Called ``Tiller the Killer'' by anti-abortion groups, Tiller
regularly attends church, is married, has four children and lives
in a huge home in a wealthy area of Wichita.
</P>
<P>
   His children have grown up with protesters chanting outside
their home. When anti-abortion activists discovered that one of
Tiller's daughters played volleyball, they began protesting at her
games.
</P>
<P>
   Since 1986, when a pipe bomb exploded and caused $100,000 damage
to his clinic, Tiller has lived in a world of bullet-proof vests
and glass, bodyguards and circuitous routes. In 1993, after a
Pensacola, Fla., abortion doctor was murdered, Attorney General
Janet Reno placed Tiller under the protection of U.S. marshals.
</P>
<P>
   The clinic's cleaning woman reportedly carries a gun at work.
</P>
<P>
   During Operation Rescue's 1991 Summer of Mercy campaign against
abortion, Tiller's clinic was under siege for six straight weeks.
More than 2,000 people were arrested for trespassing and blocking
access to the facility.
</P>
<P>
   Three months before Shannon shot him, Tiller received the Faith
and Freedom Award from the national Religious Coalition for
Abortion Rights.
</P>
<P>
   Far from being in denial about the gravity of what he does,
Tiller offers a poignant option when he does perform a rare,
late-term abortion _ and he only does the procedure on a woman
whose life or body is endangered or whose fetus is severely
deformed: The woman and her family are allowed not only to see
their aborted baby, but to dress it, have it baptized and, if they
choose, photographed.
</P>
<P>
   In one of his few interviews, in 1991 with the Chicago Tribune,
Tiller said he was sustained in his work by prayer and meditation
and by knowing in his heart that he is doing the right thing for
the people who are his patients: women.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I'm OK on the inside, what people say on the outside does
not make much difference,'' he said.

SNOOPING THE ELECTRONIC WAY 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By DAN LYNCH  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ One of the few television programs I watch with
any regularity is ``Law and Order.'' It's a cops and prosecutors
drama on NBC. It's because of that program that I decided not to
apply for E-ZPass.
</P>
<P>
   In case you don't know, E-ZPass is a computerized system for
paying tolls on the New York Thruway. You apply for a transponder
for your car. Then, when you drive through an E-ZPass exit or
entrance on the Thruway, a computer reads the thing. Later, you
receive a bill for the toll.
</P>
<P>
   The advantage of the system is that you don't have to sit in
line at a toll booth to get a ticket as you get on the highway or
cough up cash as you leave the road. I drive the Thruway a lot, and
I never regarded toll booths as overly burdensome, but I suppose
E-ZPass is a convenience.
</P>
<P>
   You can pay a price for that convenience, though. ``Law and
Order'' explained what that price is. The two detectives in the
series were investigating a murder. They were curious if a suspect
could have been near the murder scene on the day of the killing.
</P>
<P>
   So, guess what the cops did _ they checked his E-ZPass records.
Sure enough, the suspect's car had been in the area that day. The
cops got the killer because he was too lazy to sit in a toll booth
line.
</P>
<P>
   I suppose there's no way, in the age in which we live, to avoid
leaving all sorts of electronic trails for the officially curious.
And I say this as somebody who routinely digs through driving,
legal and criminal records in the pursuit of journalistic truth.
</P>
<P>
   You should know by now that your medical records are available
at the tap of a key, and your credit card records neatly keep track
of your tobacco and liquor purchases. Your porno tape rentals are
in somebody's computer somewhere. If you use credit cards for
anything and believe that purchase to be private, stop kidding
yourself.
</P>
<P>
   Somebody knows how much vodka you slug down. Somebody knows all
about you and ``Trailer Park Cuties.'' Our microprocessed world is
a paranoid's nightmare. Trust me; they know pretty much everything
there is to know about you.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with E-ZPass, they really will know everything. It turns
out that there's an outfit in New Jersey called TRANSCOM. It's a
consortium of 15 metro New York transportation agencies. Very
quietly, they've installed a network of antennas along 20 miles of
the New York Thruway and the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Well, to track the speed and location of E-ZPass cars, of
course. They want to know where you're going and how fast. They're
merely tracking patterns, TRANSCOM says. Everybody's privacy is
perfectly protected.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, and everybody's privacy will remain protected when E-ZPass
antennas tower over every foot of the Thruway. And one of these
days O.J. will catch up with the real killer, too.
</P>
<P>
   Imagine this: You have E-ZPass and you drive the Thruway from
Albany to Utica. Later, you receive a ticket in the mail citing you
for speeding. No, you weren't caught by radar. You were caught by
E-ZPass. And the E-ZPass computers make it abundantly clear that
you were going like a bat out of hell. Now, explain that to some
judge.
</P>
<P>
   They say they won't use it for that. Well, we'll see. Meanwhile,
no E-ZPass for me. I figure that they already know enough me as it
is. Besides, the world can be an infuriating place, and you never
know when you might have to murder somebody.
</P>
<P>
   So, why make it easy for them?

ANOTHER `SEINFELD' FINALE, STARRING BILL CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>
   Commentary  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By ROB MORSE  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ The most important day in Bill Clinton's
presidency will be Aug. 17. That's the day he relays his testimony
to the Ken Starr grand jury, and probably to the rest of the
nation, given Washington's colander-like leaks.
</P>
<P>
   A party question: Will Americans throw parties for the final
episode of the Starr grand jury, the same way they did for the
final episode of ``Seinfeld''?
</P>
<P>
   Costume ideas: Berets and blue dresses; fright wigs and wires;
make-overs and spokeswomen. Please, no knee pads or pants worn
below the Beltway.
</P>
<P>
   Food and drink: Quarter pounders, Big Macs, anything
super-sized; lots of leeks.
</P>
<P>
   Music: ``Stand by Your Man;'' that song about ``Will you marry
me, Bill?'' ``Our Lips Are Sealed;'' the Oscar Mayer song.
</P>
<P>
   Contest: Best idea for the Clinton legacy; find Bill's semantic
trick; spin the spin doctors; the First Lady lamp toss.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Aug. 17: Be there, or be subpoenaed. Like ``Seinfeld,''
though, this thing could be in reruns for years. It won't be over
when either the fat lady or the fat boy sings.
</P>
<P>
   Question of replication and reputation: Do you suppose James
Watson and Francis Crick regret having discovered that DNA is the
blueprint for life?
</P>
<P>
   In 1953, DNA was a scientific revolution. Now it's something on
a dress, and Watson and Crick have been replaced as geniuses by
Barry Scheck.

   Recession question: What is the Wall Street Journal really
telling us about the economy?
</P>
<P>
   On Friday, a front-page story was headlined ``Fears of a
Recession Are Beginning to Nip at Economy's Heels.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, a front-page headline said: ``Amid Economic Boom,
Many of the `Haves' Envy the `Have-Mores.'''
</P>
<P>
   These can't be such good times. The rich envy the superrich. The
rest of us take Learning Annex panhandling courses.
</P>
<P>
   Recessions are hard to predict, as the Journal article said.
However, the Economist magazine has found one tentative predictor:
the number of times the word ``recession'' appears in economic
publications. Like on the front page of the Journal.

   Chapter 7 Question: Why did Harper's magazine run an article on
a man going broke on $100,000 a year, except to tick off the
majority of Americans who are going broke on a lot less?
</P>
<P>
   The author of the article, Vince Passaro, gripes that he lives
in a bad neighborhood of New York (but for $700 a month), doesn't
go out to eat much, and yet owes more than $60,000 _ simply because
he sends his kids to private schools.
</P>
<P>
   However, in a key paragraph, he complains that his car was towed
for nonpayment of more than $1,000 worth of traffic tickets, and he
was forced to hail a cab home with a bag of shirts he was taking to
the laundry.
</P>
<P>
   Why do you have a car in Manhattan, park illegally, take cabs
and send shirts out to the laundry, you pathetic whiner?
</P>
<P>
   If you're poor, live like it. Please explain further why your
wife went to grad school on a credit card. You're going into
bankruptcy and we not only have to pay for it, we have to read
about it.
</P>
<P>
   Please, Harper's, buy no more articles from this man. Let him
learn what real poverty is _ at, say, the $80,000 level.

   Orrin cajoled Bill to ``pour his heart out'' about Monica. Linda
cried she isn't evil, but wore a wire because she was a
truth-seeker. Meanwhile, Monica's wardrobe is in the hands of
scientists questing for presidential DNA. All the president's men
say he stands by his last story.
</P>

   This is the biggest soap opera ever produced, with everything
from sex to science, and it's so much easier to follow this way.

WITH HELP OF THE INTERNET, CHRISTIANS FIND A NEW HOME 
</HEADLINE>
   (EDs: Photos available on Wieck database)  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By J. MICHAEL PARKER  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ Glyn Taylor Jr. drives 45 minutes each Sunday to
worship God, but it's not to a sparkling megachurch that he
travels.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, of Pleasanton, Texas, is one of a small but growing
number of Christians who worship regularly in private homes rather
than conventional church buildings.
</P>
<P>
   They say intimacy, total participation and lack of formal ritual
make home churches much more like churches described in the New
Testament and help their faith seem more active.
</P>
<P>
   Several New Testament verses refer to believers meeting in
private houses, such as Romans 16:5 and Colossians 4:15, and home
churches have been around ever since.
</P>
<P>
   But today's generation of home church groups is doing something
new: communicating over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Several sites on the World Wide Web provide state-by-state
directories, bulletin boards, theological writings, chat rooms,
prayers, guest lists, access to instructional materials, ministry
opportunities, answers to frequently asked questions and links to
related sites.
</P>
<P>
   One, House Church Central (www.hccentral.com), reported about
250,000 hits in less than 18 months, said Herb Drake of San Rafael,
Calif., who created the site in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most house church people have no seminary training. I have two
theology degrees from Golden Gate Seminary, and I saw this as a way
to share my theological training. But it's taken off a lot more
than I expected,'' Drake said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Even pastors and elders from institutional churches contact us
asking how to start cell groups.''
</P>
<P>
   His directory lists 183 groups in 36 states. Another has a
similar number, but Drake said it's virtually impossible to know
how many home churches exist because many aren't part of any
network.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor, an airline pilot, and Neal Griffin, a member of the same
home church in San Antonio, said they share their theological
writings with others over the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Last month, their group used electronic mail to invite people
who worship in homes in various parts of Texas and Oklahoma to join
them for a Sunday celebration in Kerrville, Texas. About 50
attended.
</P>
<P>
   Rick Martindale, an ordained pastor who leads a home church with
about 15 people in Kerrville, said the gathering, which probably
wouldn't have happened without the Internet, provided something
home churches lack _ an opportunity to gather with a larger group
of Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Internet has been fun. Lots of e-mail is exchanged _
people sharing ideas and discussing their various interpretations
of things,'' Martindale said.
</P>
<P>
   But members insist the popularity of home churches has less to
do with the Internet than a need for close relationships and
participatory worship.
</P>
<P>
   ``In a conventional church, you listen to a preacher and a
choir, drop some money in a collection plate and leave. You might
never speak to the person next to you. There's no way for each
individual to participate spontaneously,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't believe the body of Christ is built up by the gifts
of only one person, no matter how good he is. It's built up by the
gifts of everyone, and in home churches, we all participate,'' he
said.

</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Groups vary in size, some with as few as eight people, others
with as many as 40. Some split up when they grow beyond 10-12
members.
</P>
<P>
   Most have no required order of worship, no ordained clergy or
formal leadership structure and no specific creed.
</P>
<P>
   Members pray, worship, sing, study and discuss the Bible as they
feel appropriate. Some groups use only the Bible while others
supplement it with teaching material from traditional Christian
publishers.
</P>
<P>
   The majority of groups listed in directories on the Internet are
Protestant, but Catholic groups are listed as well.
</P>
<P>
   Members come from diverse walks of life, but have one common
thread.
</P>
<P>
   ``We all see ourselves as ministers _ as servants to the
others,'' Taylor said.
</P>
<P>
   Home churches are certainly nothing new. Joseph Hough, dean of
Vanderbilt University Divinity School in Nashville, Tenn., said
most home churches of the 1960s were established by liberal
Christians.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the 1960s, when issues like civil rights were very divisive
in many main-line churches, some members organized house churches
where they could discuss and formulate positions on those issues
more easily,'' Hough said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Liberal home churches were more common then, but today,
there's not an active religious left of any consequence in this
country.
</P>
<P>
   ``And all the main-line churches are under attack from the
right,'' he said.

   ARMY-SECRETS _ WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Army ran its program for
visiting foreign military officers with such slipshod procedures
that foreign governments got access to American military secrets ,
newly released internal Defense Department documents reveal. ``This
situation poses a significant risk to the Army's current and future
combat capability,'' the Army's deputy chief of staff for
intelligence wrote last year to the Army's inspector general. The
terse memo from Maj. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy is among several
critical reports obtained by Cox Newspapers under the Freedom of

   SHOOTINGS _ WASHINGTON _ Despite schoolhouse shootings that have
shocked the nation in the past two years, a dispassionate analysis
of national data shows the homicide rate among teenagers and young
adults is declining. Analysts with the National Institute for
Health Statistics in Hyattsville, Md., report in the Journal of the
American Medical Association that while the decline in homicide
rates for adolescents and young adults declined in every
demographic category between 1993 and 1995, there was ``significant
decline'' for black males between 15 and 24. (Nesmith, Cox News

   GINGRICH _ WASHINGTON _ The House's approval of a campaign

and other GOP leaders has, not for the first time, raised the
question of who's in charge. Gingrich's promised tobacco bill aimed
at teenage smokers is on hold. There is little prospect for an
agreement on cutting taxes. Even the Gingrich-backed candidate in
southwest Georgia lost his primary. (Sherman, Cox News Service).

East Texas. Sandlin hopes farmers will tell the USDA what they do

   HURRICANE _ HOLDEN BEACH, N.C. _ With the hurricane season's
first tropical storm, Alex, plodding along far out in the Atlantic
Ocean, this coastal North Carolina town's new $1 million dune
appears invincible. But locals know that, if a big storm blows in,
the manmade dune guarding $400,000 beachfront homes would be as
vulnerable as a child's sand castle at high tide. During 1997 and
so far this summer, the East Coast has been spared from hurricanes,
but forecasters see potential for trouble in Alex, meandering west
of the Leeward Islands more than 2,000 miles from the Carolinas'
beaches. (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

WELLS FARGO LAUNCHES ON-LINE BROKERAGE SERVICE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By EDWARD IWATA  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Leaping into the torrid on-line brokerage field,
Wells Fargo &AMP; Co. executives have rolled out an Internet service
they hope will appeal to traditional bank customers and active
on-line investors.
</P>
<P>
   Using WellsTrade, customers can trade up to 1,000 shares of a
U.S. stock for a $29.95 fee, choose among 4,000 mutual funds and
check their account balances. They also will get business news,
company research and analysts' recommendations from Zacks
Investment Research and News Alert.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a growing market,'' said Jenny LaSalle, Wells Fargo's
vice president of on-line brokerage. ``We want to focus on
customers who want a whole host of services _ not just the cheapest
trade.''
</P>
<P>
   Wells Fargo quietly launched the on-line brokerage in December
to a small group of customers.
</P>
<P>
   Several banks have plunged into on-line investing to compete
with independent Web brokerage houses and more established
companies that have expanded into Internet services. Citibank
offers its own Internet trading service. Fleet Financial bought the
Quick &AMP; Reilly brokerage house; First Chicago offers cybertrading
through DLJ Direct; and BancOne of Ohio has teamed up with ETrade
of Palo Alto, Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts praised Wells Fargo and other banks for taking bigger
steps into the on-line world. But they warned that banks are
sluggish latecomers to a competitive market.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks are handicapped coming onto the Internet _ they have a
ways to go before they become real players,'' said David Weisman,
an on-line consultant at Forrester Research in Cambridge, Mass.
``It won't be easy for Wells, but it still makes sense for them to
start building their services on-line.''
</P>
<P>
   One analyst predicted the bank's on-line brokerage will flop,
unless it spends $30 million on a marketing campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Their entry will have no impact,'' said James Mark, an on-line
analyst formerly at CS First Boston. ``They won't be a factor
unless they're willing to put substantial monies behind their
efforts.''
</P>
<P>
   The on-line brokerage field has been pummelled by price wars,
costly marketing and fast-changing technology.
</P>
<P>
   About 90 financial firms _ most of them discount brokerage
companies _ already offer on-line services, according to Gomez
Advisors, an on-line consulting firm in Boston.
</P>
<P>
   And more than 90 percent of the market is dominated by nine
players, including Charles Schwab &AMP; Co., ETrade, Waterhouse
Securities, Datek and Fidelity. Banks have a shaky hold on less
than 1 percent of the market.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the strong rivals, banks find the potential on-line
market too lucrative to resist.
</P>
<P>
   Today, 3.5 million people use 5 million on-line brokerage
accounts, and those numbers are growing 25 percent yearly,
according to Gomez Advisors. By 2001, the on-line market will total
10 percent, or $2.2 billion, of all retail brokerage commissions,
predicted investment bank Piper Jaffray in Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.) &QL; 
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Banks must overcome many obstacles, though, including higher
prices. Wells Fargo and other large banks offer a flat fee of
$29.95 for each trade. Other on-line brokerages charge from $7.95 a
trade at Quick &AMP; Reilly, to $14.95 at ETrade, to $29.95 at Charles
Schwab.
</P>
<P>
   Another roadblock: a host of Depression-era banking laws and
regulations designed to protect people and their federally insured
bank deposits from riskier Wall Street investments.
</P>
<P>
   ``Banks are having a hard time integrating their banking and
brokerage services,'' said Steven Hall, a senior analyst at Gomez
Advisors. ``Even if I'm a bank customer, I need to start a separate
brokerage account for their on-line service.''
</P>
<P>
   But Wells Fargo and other big banks have powerful brand name
recognition, Hall said. Wells Fargo also has more than 10 million
customers who may slowly convert to on-line services.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's tremendous potential traffic flow,'' Hall said. ``Wells
has to get those customers to change their behavior.''

THE YANKEES DO NOTHING, AND DO IT WELL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By STEVE CAMPBELL  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ In the end, the New York Yankees took the most
prudent course of action available to them.
</P>
<P>
   They did nothing.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing is the best thing owner George Steinbrenner possibly
could have done to give the Yankees their best chance of winning
the World Series this year and in seasons to come. Do you know how
hard it must have been for Steinbrenner, letting the major-league
trading deadline come and go without strong-arming his baseball
people into doing something?
</P>
<P>
   Do you know what restraint it took to abstain from Friday's
Rotisserie League-on-caffeine frenzy? Randy Johnson was there for
the taking from the Seattle Mariners. The Toronto Blue Jays were
listening to offers for Roger Clemens. The St. Louis Cardinals were
ready, willing and able to deal free-agents-to-be Todd Stottlemyre
and Royce Clayton.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday came with the likes of Johnson, Stottlemyre, Clayton,
Carlos Perez, Ellis Burks, Todd Zeile, Juan Guzman, Tony Phillips,
Mark Grudzielanek, Willie Blair, Bernard Gilkey, Darryl Hamilton,
Greg Swindell and Wilton Guerrero having changed teams. Saturday
left with the Yankees owning a 77-27 record. Manager Joe Torre is
just going to have to make do with the deepest starting rotation in
baseball backed by an offense more relentless than Kenneth Starr,
the special prosecutor investing President Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   When you're dealt four aces, you don't break up the hand in
hopes of drawing a royal flush. The Yankees have the best team in
baseball this season _ maybe any season. Until the playoffs, the
Yankees' only competition is against themselves. And posterity.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees were interested in Johnson for all the wrong
reasons. Johnson, 34, is a former Cy Young Award winner who is 9-10
with a 4.33 earned run average this season. The Yankees have not
one, not two, not three, not four, not five, but six starters with
lower ERAs. Johnson has one fewer loss than David Cone (15-3), Andy
Pettitte (16-6) and David Wells (13-2) combined.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees, in other words, need Johnson like Mark McGwire
needs more muscle. Not when Johnson is seeking $10 million or more
per season. Not when that money would be better spent retaining
center fielder Bernie Williams, who will be a free agent after this
season. Not when the Mariners were trying to pry away some
combination of Hideki Irabu, Ramiro Mendoza and Ricky Ledee.
</P>
<P>
   If Johnson buckles under the pressure of performing in a small
market in the last year of his contract, then he isn't the sort of
person who is going to thrive taking the ball in New York with a
championship at stake. Remember Kenny Rogers? Johnson has a bad
back, a bad attitude, a bad personality and the worst haircut in
the major leagues. The only reason for the Yankees to have coveted
him was to keep him away from the Cleveland Indians, the Boston Red
Sox, the Texas Rangers or anybody else who might make the American
League playoffs.
</P>
<P>
   And 98 mph fastball notwithstanding, Johnson isn't worthy of the
sort of fear borne out of immense respect. His career postseason
record: 2-3, with three consecutive defeats, and a 3.99 ERA. He is
2-6 this season against teams with a record of .500 or better.
</P>
<P>
   Typical of the way things are working out for the Yankees this
season, they didn't have to give up a thing to keep Johnson away
from any of the AL contenders. The Houston Astros had the right
idea, trading a package of minor-leaguers who may not amount to
anything in return for the right to rent Johnson for two months.
They actually need a starting pitcher, and Johnson should benefit
from National League hitters' unfamiliarity with him.
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees didn't need to be bold, dramatic, Steinbrenneresque.
The elements already are in place to win a championship, so there
was no sense calling anybody's trade-deadline bluffs. Instead, they
did the right thing. They did nothing.

   ICE-CREAM (Undated) _ Americans may be weak on foreign
languages, but every child from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Ore,
loves one French phrase _ a la mode. Forget what it means in
France. Here in the United States it means a scoop of ice cream
added to a dessert, usually a slice of pie. No matter how
sophisticated the American palate becomes, the idea of ice cream
with dessert touches something deep in the national psyche, one of
the earliest memories, both pure and sensual, of food as a passport
to pleasure. A la mode lives on, but the ice cream has changed. It
used to be vanilla. Period. Now it's everything but. By William
Grimes.

OFFSHORE INJUSTICE? 
VICTIMS SAY OIL FIRMS' INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS LEAVE THEM NOWHERE
TO TURN 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  (Attn: Ala., La., N.C., Texas) 
 
By MICHAEL DAVIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOUSTON _ An offshore oil platform may appear to to be a refuge
on the high seas, but it also can be a trap with no escape for
workers facing harassment.
</P>
<P>
   Few cases have surfaced where workers have been the victims of
violence or intimidation offshore, but those that have come to
light depict a workplace that is isolated and largely controlled by
the large energy companies bankrolling the operations.
</P>
<P>
   Law enforcement authorities in Louisiana and Texas say they
rarely, if ever, are called in to conduct criminal investigations
of incidents on offshore platforms. Drillers' and oil companies'
policies call for in-house investigations of any potential crime
and disciplinary action, if necessary, before law enforcement is
notified.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been doing this for 13 years and I don't recall a
single case,'' said Mike Cox, spokesman for the Texas Department of
Public Safety, which has jurisdiction in Texas' offshore waters.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI, the agency most likely to look into a crime on an
offshore rig in federal waters, only has a record of one criminal
conviction from an incident on an offshore rig.
</P>
<P>
   Oil workers say incidences of physical violence among workers
are not common on offshore platforms, but when they occur, they
leave a victim few options.
</P>
<P>
   ``You can either jump over the side or deal with it,'' one
worker said.
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Kinney, executive director of the National Safe Workplace
Institute, a Charlotte, N.C.-based firm that advises businesses on
workplace safety, says he has heard numerous stories of harassment
from offshore workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is endemic; it is really kind of expected,'' he said. ``A
lot of nasty things happen on the high seas. It is not the kind of
place where you want to screw around with people.''
</P>
<P>
   Two recent court cases show how bad things can get.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Supreme Court in March allowed a male roustabout on an
offshore rig, Joseph Oncole, to sue his employer for same-sex
harassment. He said he quit because he feared he would be forced to
have sex by co-workers.
</P>
<P>
   That ruling came on the heels of a U.S. District Court case in
which the mother of a deceased female paramedic, Lonna Herronen,
alleged her daughter was raped on a Conoco offshore platform. A
jury agreed the young woman had been assaulted offshore, but did
not find Conoco negligent.
</P>
<P>
   Experts in workplace security and violence say offshore oil rigs
present a unique work environment, both for an assailant and
victim, where there is literally no place to run.
</P>
<P>
   Energy companies tend to take care of assaults and other
offenses offshore by handling these incidents in-house, usually
firing the individuals involved rather than bringing in law
enforcement officials to prosecute any guilty parties, said Alvin
Marks, a Slidell, La.-based offshore safety consultant who often
testifies as an expert witness in offshore safety-related trials.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have been doing this since the 1950s and I have not seen any
cases where someone assaulted someone else offshore go to trial,''
Marks said.
</P>
<P>
   Craig Colwart, chief public defender for the 16th judicial
district in Louisiana, which comprises three parishes in the Morgan
City area, does not recall representing any workers accused of
crimes offshore.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have represented plenty of workers who get into trouble
when they get back on shore in Morgan City, but none accused of
committing a crime on an offshore platform,'' Colwart said.
</P>
<P>
   In federal waters, the matter of jurisdiction over criminal
activity becomes murky. The FBI is charged with investigating
``crimes on the high seas,'' as such offenses are termed, be they
rape, theft, murder or assault. The U.S. Coast Guard and the U.S.
Customs Service also have jurisdiction in federal waters, but most
of their investigations are connected to drug-related smuggling.
</P>
<P>
   Overlapping federal jurisdictions can lead to a shell game of
sorts when it comes to taking responsibility for the investigation
of a crime on the high seas, said Ron Hayes, who heads up a
Fairhope, Ala.-based nonprofit support group for families of
industrial accident victims named Families in Grief Hold Together,
or FIGHT.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have a hand-off sequence,'' Hayes said. ``You call the
Coast Guard, which you think would have jurisdiction because it is
over water. They will say, `No, we don't handle it; you have to go
here.' Or, they will make it so difficult to get through the
channels that you will get frustrated and quit.''
</P>
<P>
   Sheila Thorne, agent/media representative for the New Orleans
office of the FBI, could find only one case of a crime that led to
a conviction of a worker on an offshore rig, that of Steven Timothy
LaFrance in 1987.
</P>
<P>
   LaFrance was working for a contractor on a Shell Oil Co.
offshore rig. He was indicted in February 1987 on charges of
assault with intent to commit murder. He pleaded guilty and was
sentenced to 30 months in jail and fined $1,000.
</P>
<P>
   Shell issued a brief statement for this story regarding its
policy for dealing with any crimes on its offshore facilities.
</P>
<P>
   ``Any unlawful acts against persons or property will be
aggressively investigated internally and where warranted with the
help of appropriate federal authorities,'' Shell's statement said.
``This policy's foundation is one for a safe work environment.''
</P>
<P>
   When workers have a disagreement, things typically don't
escalate to violence because the workers involved fear losing their
jobs, usually the harshest punishment meted out for offshore
offenses. But angering an offshore co-worker can lead to violence
back on land.
</P>
<P>
   ``They usually say, `We'll settle this on the dock'; and there
were several fights on the docks when we got back,'' said one
10-year offshore veteran _ who asked he not be named _ formerly
with Otis Engineering, an oil-field service company owned by
Halliburton Co.
</P>
<P>
   The International Association of Drilling Contractors does not
have a policy it recommends in dealing with crimes on the high
seas, said Alan Spackman, director of offshore technical and
regulatory affairs for the industry group.

HOUSTON: the industry group
<TEXT>
<P>
   Dan Hanson, vice president of employee relations at Global
Marine, a Houston-based offshore contract drilling company, said he
was not aware of any situations on any of its domestic rigs that
have been serious enough to call in law enforcement officials.
</P>
<P>
   Global, along with other contract drillers, such as Diamond
Offshore and R&AMP;B Falcon Corp., have similar policies: Incidents
such as fights are usually handled in-house. The company will
investigate, gather eyewitness accounts, and try to evaluate the
cause of the fight. Any employees deemed at fault will be fired.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cannot recall anything over the past 15 years, but I can
assure you that if a crime is committed on one of our rigs, we
would deal with it immediately and severely,'' said Gary Krenek,
chief financial officer at Diamond Offshore.
</P>
<P>
   But witnesses who had worked offshore for Conoco testified
during the trial of the Herronen lawsuit _ the case in which a
mother claimed her daughter was raped while working on a rig _ that
company efforts don't always do the job.
</P>
<P>
   They testified that they had seen female workers on offshore
rigs tied to a heliport and had fireworks shot at them. Other
workers bragged that they were working offshore because they were
running from the law.
</P>
<P>
   One former Conoco female employee testified under oath that she
had been sexually assaulted offshore but did not report it to
Conoco.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why not?'' one of Herronen's attorneys asked her.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because it would have fallen on deaf ears,'' she replied.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
WOMAN ALLEGEDLY RAPED &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In April 1994, after working two years on a Conoco offshore rig,
something happened to paramedic Lonna Herronen that changed the
young woman's life irreparably.
</P>
<P>
   Until that time, according to friends and co-workers, Herronen
said she loved her job, and she had even received a commendation
from Conoco for saving an offshore worker's life on a nearby Mobil
Oil platform. She was roundly praised by all of her superiors. ``As
good as they come,'' wrote one.
</P>
<P>
   But after the spring of 1994, Herronen began to change. She
began to dread going offshore. She drank heavily and eventually was
hospitalized for severe depression.
</P>
<P>
   Then on Sept. 20, 1995, she was thrown from her car and killed
in a one-car accident. She had been drinking and was on medication
for depression. She was 26.
</P>
<P>
   Following her death, her mother filed a lawsuit against Conoco,
alleging her daughter was raped on the job on one of the company's
offshore rigs and as a result suffered severe mental distress that
led to her death.
</P>
<P>
   Herronen never filed a complaint with her employer, Medic
Systems. What's known about the offshore incident is based on the
accounts of friends and doctors she'd spoken to.
</P>
<P>
   Friends testified she told them of the incident and out of
concern they had contacted Conoco officials. Doctors' records and
entries in Herronen's personal journal entered as evidence at the
trial revealed an extremely troubled person who had convinced her
psychiatrist she had been raped offshore.
</P>
<P>
   In January 1995, Herronen was hospitalized for severe
depression. At her initial psychiatric evaluation at Rivendell
Partial Hospital of Pensacola, Fla., she said she had been sexually
abused by ``several'' men while working offshore but had not
reported the incident because they threatened to harm her, her
friends and even her animals.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco argued during the trial of the lawsuit that Herronen was
not raped. Instead, the company asserted her depression and anxiety
stemmed from a variety of influences, including the death of her
grandfather, tensions in her relationship with her mother and an
unfaithful lover.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco conducted an internal investigation of the matter after
the initial allegations surfaced, said Carlton Adams, spokesman for
the company in Houston.
</P>
<P>
   A jury last August agreed that the young woman had suffered some
sort of assault on the job, possibly rape, but it did not find that
Conoco was negligent. The case is being appealed by the family to
the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New Orleans.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco's Adams said the jury's verdict did not prompt the
company to reinvestigate the matter, and it should not be
interpreted as proof that Herronen was a victim of a violent crime.
Jurors interviewed by Conoco lawyers after the verdict said the
broad instructions they were given in their jury charge left them
no choice but to find Herronen was assaulted, Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   ``They said it could have been anything from verbal harassment
to a touch; and they did not rule out rape,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   Conoco is not aware of any law enforcement investigation into
the matter, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``At the time of the trial we asked the FBI to look into this
and they declined,'' Adams said.
</P>
<P>
   New Orleans FBI agent Thorne said the bureau neither confirms
nor denies any pending investigations.
</P>
<P>
   ``The day that jury returned its verdict, a criminal
investigation of this matter should have begun,'' said Kinney with
the National Safe Workplace Institute.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
SAME-SEX HARASSMENT SUIT &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Joseph Oncole fought a seven-year battle all the way to the U.S.
Supreme Court before he won the right to sue his employer over
allegations of sexual harassment by another man on an offshore oil
rig.
</P>
<P>
   Oncole, a roustabout on a Sundowner Offshore Services rig
drilling a well in the Gulf of Mexico for Chevron, testified at a
deposition, ``I felt that if I didn't leave my job I would be raped
or forced to have sex.''
</P>
<P>
   He had already had encounters with hostile co-workers, according
to court records. In one instance, a co-worker grabbed him in the
shower and restrained him while another man forced a bar of soap
into his rectum.
</P>
<P>
   The case was sent back to U.S. District Court and a trial on
whether he was harassed is expected to go to trial in October, said
Andre LaPlace, one of Oncole's attorneys in Baton Rouge, La.
</P>
<P>
   The company isn't conceding that he was sexually harassed on the
rig. A spokesman for Nabors Industries, which bought Sundowner in
1994, three years after the alleged incident, concedes the
incidents involving Oncole should never have happened, but still
maintains it was mainly ``horseplay.'' &QL;

FINANCE BILL PUTS MEEHAN IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was clearly Representative Martin T. Meehan's
most important moment in Congress to date, and tension was building
Monday to make last-minute calls, race to strategy meetings, and
give television interviews. ``Time for a Q.S.,'' the Massachusetts
Democrat said cryptically.
</P>
<P>
   The calls and the reporters and the Democratic leadership had to
wait while Meehan took a ``quick shower.'' It was 3:45 p.m., and
what Meehan didn't realize was that the final vote on the
campaign-finance bill he has championed for four years and
carefully steered on the House floor for two months had been pushed
forward by several hours, making his late afternoon a last-minute
scramble.
</P>
<P>
   What looked like one more ploy by Republicans to throw off
Meehan and his GOP ally, Representative Christopher Shays of
Connecticut, turned out to be like all the others: It didn't
succeed. And by a 237-186 vote, the House last night passed the
Shays-Meehan bill, landmark legislation to overhaul major portions
of the campaign-finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the Germans in `Saving Private Ryan,' the Republican
leadership tried lobbing grenades, laying land mines, and erecting
barbed wire to kill campaign-finance reform,'' said Norman
Ornstein, a political scientist who has followed the issue for the
American Enterprise Institute. ``But Shays and Meehan held it
together and kept members of their coalition from defecting. It was
really quite remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't easy, even at the end. In midafternoon,
MondayMeehan's legislative aides had an anxiety attack because
members of the black and Hispanic caucuses seemed to be balking at
the Shays-Meehan bill because it had been amended last week to ban
campaign contributions from noncitizens who are legal residents of
the United States. The caucuses, made up mostly of Democrats,
viewed the amendment as a slap at minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unconscionable, after coming this far, for the
Democrats, in the minority and the reform party, to kill the
bill,'' said Meehan, who with Shays fought off about 60 amendments
to their measure. ``But the closer campaign-finance reform gets to
reality, the more personal and difficult the issue becomes for
members.''
</P>
<P>
   So Meehan sat behind his large desk and worked the phones. He
pleaded with Virginia Democrat Robert Scott and cajoled New York
Republican Peter King to drop their opposition. Then, in a meeting
that had nothing to do with campaign-finance legislation _ instead,
it was to plan a congressional trip to join President Clinton next
month in Ireland _ Meehan leaned on White House lobbyist Chuck
Brain to get Clinton to call lawmakers on behalf of the bill Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get him a list,'' Meehan directed an aide. ``The president can
make the political argument.''
</P>
<P>
   But many believe that it was primarily the unflagging
determination of Meehan and Shays to make the argument for banning
``soft money'' _ at late hours of the night, when they were nearly
alone on the House floor but with a relatively large C-Span
audience tuned in _ that turned what was a dead issue earlier this
year into one that is expected to go with considerable momentum to
a reluctant Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill was, in many ways, left as road kill,'' said
Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, the Brighton Democrat. ``That
it survived shows the kind of tenacity and instinct for success
that Marty clearly has. He's a determined guy. Once he makes his
mind up, he goes after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brain called Meehan's management of the bill ``masterful.''
King, who shares Meehan's love of Irish blarney but not his ardor
for a ban on soft money, said the Lowell Democrat, while misguided,
did ``a brilliant job. ... Most others would have given up.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably helps that Meehan, who is running for his fourth
term in Congress, is a detail guy. Monday he meticulously counted
votes; he portioned out precious minutes to those who wanted to
speak during the 40-minute floor debate _ ``No more than three for
(House minority leader Richard) Gephardt''; and he fretted over
whether a little nick on his chin, the result of a ``quick shave''
along with the ``quick shower,'' would show up on the television
screen.
</P>
<P>
   And even as he accepted congratulatory handshakes and hugs _
``We've made incredible progress, and I'm excited we've come this
far,'' Meehan said _ the congressman's mind was racing ahead,
plotting ways to fend off substitute bills in the House later this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, everything has gone according to plan,'' Meehan said,
as he headed off to find Shays and strategize for the uphill fight
in the Senate.

SHOPPERS PONDER LIFE AFTER MERGER 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By VICTORIA COLLIVER  
 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN FRANCISCO _ Lucky may call itself the ``low price leader,''
but the merger announced Monday between Lucky Stores' parent
company and Albertson's Inc. left shoppers wondering whether the
store would maintain this image after the buyout was complete.
</P>
<P>
   Lucky shopper Mary Smith, at the Rockridge store on Oakland's
College Avenue, worried that the merger would mean less competition
_ and with it, higher prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think there are too many mergers,'' said Smith. ``For the
consumer that almost always means less choice, higher prices.''
</P>
<P>
   While the chain insists consumers will save through efficiencies
of scale, shopper Lucille Bullis remains unconvinced. Saying she
too thinks prices will go higher, she added, ``The quality is sure
to go down.''
</P>
<P>
   Regardless of whether consumers see any of the savings, it's
clear the merger mania that has hit the banking, telecommunications
and other major industries has come to the local supermarket.
Independently owned markets insist they will maintain their ground,
but they will be doing so while grocery stores are becoming
increasingly high-tech and diverse, offering everything from
banking to in-store pharmacies.
</P>
<P>
   Boise, Idaho-based Albertson's $11.7 billion purchase of
American Stores Inc., the Salt Lake City company that owns Lucky,
is just the latest in a series of mergers that is creating fewer
supermarket owners and larger existing chains.
</P>
<P>
   In December 1996, Pleasanton, Calif.-based Safeway Inc. agreed
to buy Southern California's Vons and Pavilion chains, then
creating North America's second-largest grocery chain, behind only
Cincinnati-based Kroger Co. The Albertson's-American Stores deal
knocks Kroger off its perch, creating the nation's largest chain
with more than 2,470 stores in 37 states.
</P>
<P>
   On a smaller scale, the 88-store, West Sacramento, Calif.-based
Raley's grocery chain agreed last year to buy Nob Hill Foods, a
Gilroy, Calif.-based company with 27 stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``The size and scope of this acquisition is not something that
anyone could have conceived of five years ago,'' said Jim Wisner,
vice president of Willard Bishop Consulting, a Chicago-based
supermarket consulting firm.
</P>
<P>
   Wisner said the combination of an improved economy with changes
in how stores analyze their costs had made mergers in the grocery
business more desirable and feasible than even a few years ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of these mergers are done with the eye toward some
efficiencies that will be created,'' he said, explaining that
grocery companies could save money with improved technologies such
as computer-assisted ordering and satellite truck tracking.
</P>
<P>
   But consumer groups remain doubtful. Linda Sherry, editorial
director for Consumer Action in San Francisco, said fewer stores
meant fewer opportunities for customers to check coupons and flyers
and compare prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Maybe you're not going to be paying a lot more, but you will
have less choice,'' said Sherry, adding the only benefit might be
fewer flyers cluttering consumers' mailboxes.
</P>
<P>
   Grocery industry watchers say not all the benefits to the
companies will be strictly monetary. They say part of the
attraction of the deal for Albertson's, which has no drugstore
operations, was that it could use American Stores' experience to
get into the in-store pharmacy business.
</P>
<P>
   American Stores has 1,558 stores in 26 states operating under
the Lucky, Jewel and Acme names along with the Sav-on and Osco
drugstore chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``What's a supermarket? What's a drugstore? What's a mass
merchandiser? Those lines are continuing to blur,'' said Tim
Hammonds, president of Washington D.C.-based Food Marketing
Institute, an organization for about 1,500 large and small grocery
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Safeway spokeswoman Debra Lambert said the chain would continue
its operations unchanged by Monday's announced merger involving
rival Lucky.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are not troubled by this merger,'' she said. ``We know both
of these companies very well, and we have competed with them in the
past.''
</P>
<P>
   Business Week, meanwhile, reported in its latest edition that
there had been rumors of merger talks between Safeway and Kroger,
which has 1,400 supermarkets and 815 convenience stores, mainly in
the South and Midwest. Lambert would not comment on those rumors.

MINORS A MAJOR SOURCE OF REAL BASEBALL

 c.1998 San Francisco Examiner  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN JOSE, Calif. _ The sun was setting behind the big Heinz
Ketchup bottle above the right-field fence, turning the
short-sleeved shirts in the stands and the darkening sky and the
outfield grass into an aquarium of colors.
</P>
<P>
   An American flag rippled from a pole in left-center. The crowd
at Municipal Stadium was murmuring happily.
</P>
<P>
   The San Jose Giants, Single-A club for the San Francisco
franchise, was trying to come back late in the game against the
Rancho Cucamonga Quakes, Single-A club for the San Diego Padres.
The Giants had given up five runs in the first inning on three
singles, a fielder's choice and a passed ball, and were huffing and
puffing to catch up the Quakes.
</P>
<P>
   It has become a cliche to wax nostalgic about minor-league ball,
to say the minors have all the friendliness and heart and hunger
big-league ball has lost. That kind of sighing nostalgia is easy to
understand, given a night at San Jose Municipal.
</P>
<P>
   There's an honest tenderness to watching two minor-league clubs
move through an evening, to see that brotherhood of players, most
of them on their way up, some on their way down, run out every
infield grounder. It's cloud music to hear them call to each other
across the field, cracking wise from the dugout. There's a
shake-your-head symmetry to watching a player chug past first after
spanking a pitch toward center, his eyes on the night air, before
making that slow arc around the pitcher and back to his dugout when
the ball settles in for an out.
</P>
<P>
   Walking into the stadium, there's a shared anticipation of
nothing special happening. Oh, a win would be nice. A couple of
homers would get the juices flowing. But, really, it would be just
as good to see the beer batter strike out.
</P>
<P>
   If a Giants pitcher strikes out the designated beer batter _
this time around it's Rancho Cucamonga's Pete Paciorek _ beer is
half price at stadium windows, leading to a ripple of grins. Before
the game, a man standing by the chalkboard leading to the stands
looked down at Paciorek's name and said to anyone around him who'd
listen, ``He's struck out 110 times already this year. One hundred
and 10 times. Hah.''
</P>
<P>
   But in four at-bats Paciorek didn't strike out, earning boos
from a crowd that came close to 2,000. There were cheers enough to
go around, though _ for a home run from Giants catcher Giuseppe
Chiaramonte, for right-hander Bill Malley when he almost struck out
the side, for a breakneck catch in left by the Quakes' Scott Seal.
It was good, solid, Single-A ball.
</P>
<P>
   San Jose will be missing its star closer, Jim Stoops, who was
traded to Colorado in the deal that brought Ellis Burkes to San
Francisco, but there are other players who know how to win.
</P>
<P>
   Despite having only three pitchers with a winning record, only
one with an earned-run average under 3.00, and no hitters batting
.300, San Jose has won 30 more games than it has lost. The Giants
led the first-half standings and would be the No. 1 seed in the
Valley Division if the playoffs started this week.
</P>
<P>
   Since affiliating itself with the Giants in 1988, San Jose has
had nine winning seasons and boasts a .572 winning percentage _ the
best of any minor-league ballclub in the United States. Over the
past two years, more than a dozen former San Jose players made
their debuts in the big leagues.
</P>
<P>
   It's a team with a storied history. Rod Beck played at San Jose.
So did Dave Dravecky and Kelly Downs and Shawn Estes. Bill Mueller
was there, and Matt Williams, William VanLandingham and Russ Ortiz.
The team has had its characters, too _ from 1964-'66 San Jose's
manager was Rocky Bridges, who sported a NASA crewcut, offered his
own brand of Yogi-isms, and looked as if his mouth was stuffed with
billiard balls.
</P>
<P>
   Buy a souvenir program before the game and you get a free bingo
card and a mountain of information, including a mileage chart
between league cities, a short baseball dictionary (``Tools of
ignorance _ The catcher's equipment''), a comparison of prices for
tickets, parking, a hot dog and soda for a family of four ($225 for
a 49ers game, $80 for a San Francisco Giants game, $35 at San
Jose), scores for each player and fan who took part in the '97
Giants Bowl-a-Thon, and a half-page ad for Winchester Mystery House
that reads, ``No runs. No Hits. No Heirs.''
</P>
<P>
   There's also a scorecard, put together by league statistician
Bill Weiss, in his 50th year on the job. Scorecard items run along
the lines of ``In 1949, Ray Perry, manager-third baseman of the
Redding Browns in the Far West League, set what is believed to be a
record by walking 11 consecutive times, then being hit by a pitch
... Perry, known as `The Little Buffalo,' is one of only two
players to lead the league in which he was playing in homers for
seven consecutive seasons.''
</P>
<P>
   You can look up from the scorecard to scan the outfield
advertisements and cup your hands to hurl an insult at the
first-base ump, who badly misses a call on a swipe-tag.

<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Army ran its program for visiting foreign
military officers with such slipshod procedures that foreign
governments got access to American military secrets, newly released
Department of Defense documents reveal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation poses a significant risk to the Army's current
and future combat capability,'' the Army's deputy chief of staff
for intelligence wrote last year to the Army's inspector general.
The terse memo from Maj. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy is among several
critical reports obtained by Cox Newspapers under the Freedom of
Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   The memo _ three lines of which were blacked out by Pentagon
officials _ said there had not been ``full compliance'' with Army
regulations on disclosure of information and transfer of technology
to foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the program's lack of safeguards was cited by the
Army in an annual report to Congress on the military's most serious
``material weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo from Kennedy, who has since been promoted to lieutenant
general, came amid of a flurry of activity that began last spring.
Although the Army documents did not indicate that security was
actually compromised, the Army's intelligence command ordered a
top-to-bottom overhaul for Foreign Liaison Officers, as the program
is formally known. The reforms are not yet complete, seven months
after their target date.
</P>
<P>
   Army financial audits also revealed lax financial management of
the program, which was set up 34 years ago to forge closer ties
between the Army and the military in friendly nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's audit agency concluded that some of the cementing of
those ties went beyond the requirements of hospitality. An
investigation cited a $26,000 reception for 265 people at an
undisclosed Army base, a ski trip for foreign liaison officers and
their families, and a ``gift locker'' at the Pentagon that was
bulging with gifts for the foreigners, including items from Tiffany
and Co. and $19,342 worth of Parker pens.
</P>
<P>
   One audit reported that the Army spent $580,000 on gifts , tours
and entertainment for foreign liaison operations in the year that
ended November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors concluded that such expenditures ``may not pass the
media 'litmus test','' and added that ``negative media coverage may
be detrimental to Army funding requirements considering the current
fiscal environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army ordered tighter controls for the so-called contingency
funds for the program. However, Pentagon officials said they had no
estimate of the current cost of the Foreign Liaison Officer
program.
</P>
<P>
   In written responses to questions from Cox Newspapers, Kennedy's
office said there are 173 foreign visitors from 23 countries, which
include NATO allies, Israel, Egypt and India, among others. The
visitors spend two to three years with the Army on a variety of
missions, including overseeing the purchase of U.S. weapons for
their countries, working with computer technology to improve
compatibility with U.S. forces, and observing Army training.
</P>
<P>
   Other branches of the armed services have similar programs,
which the military highly prizes as a way to improve cooperation
among allied armies and make joint military operations easier.
Foreign naval officers are stationed at bases and on U.S. ships and
take courses at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I. A
spokeswoman for the Navy said that naval foreign liaison officers
come under a decentralized command, and she could offer no estimate
of the number of participants.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of foreign officers attached to the Air Force are
stationed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, where
78 foreign personnel from 20 countries work. Their chief mission is
to help facilitate the sales of military hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not had any security problems,'' said Col. Howard Creek,
vice-commander of the Air Force Security Assistance Center at
Wright-Patterson. Asked how the foreign visitors are overseen, he
said, ``We don't physically follow them around, but we do keep
track of what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Creek said that he had not been informed of problems in the Army
foreign liaison operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although such programs are designed for friendly countries, the
exchange of information carries an obvious risk that countries will
ask their liaisons to delve into U.S. secrets, said a veteran of
the U.S. intelligence field. ``I would be surprised and shocked if
they didn't do it,'' said James R. Lilley, a career Central
Intelligence Agency officer who also served as ambassador to China.
``You try to prevent these things from happening as best you can.
If you want absolute guarantees, you better cut out the program.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what triggered the apparent alarm over the Army's
foreign liaison program was not clear from the internal documents.
The Army Intelligence command repeatedly cited concerns that the
program had no centralized command and that oversight was falling
through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the deficiencies were that the visiting officers had no
written agreements with the United States defining the role of
liaison officers. Also, the Army reforms indicated that despite a
regulation requiring foreign governments to reimburse the U.S.
military for liaison expenses, the U.S. military had apparently
failed to seek the repayments.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after the target date for full compliance with
regulations, the Army has completed an agreement with only one of
the participating countries, Argentina. Army officials who are
working on the diplomatic project said they could offer no
prediction about when the rest of the agreements would be completed
and signed.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Army installation, Georgia's Fort McPherson, submitted
a completed review on the foreign visitors on base by the Jan. 1
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   An Army directive issued last year on reforming the program by
the first of this year included this stiff warning: ``All current
foreign LNO (liaison officer) positions not in compliance with
applicable DOD (Department of Defense) and Army guidance by 1
January 1998 will be subject to elimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Army has eliminated any liaison positions for
failing to comply, Kennedy's office said, ``No.''

`HALLOWEEN: H20' SCARES WITH FAMILY BRAND FRIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
 
Our rating: 3 Stars 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Boasting one good idea and a relatively restrained
approach to the requisite sadism, ``Halloween: H20'' is
surprisingly watchable for the sixth sequel in a slasher film
series.
</P>
<P>
   Even if it doesn't think that's what it is. Conceived by
returning series heroine Jamie Lee Curtis, ``H20'' (the title is
supposed to indicate that this is a 20th anniversary tribute to
John Carpenter's original fright fest, not some underwater version)
is more like ``Halloween'' and two-thirds. It ignores everything
from the other sequels except ``Halloween II's'' revelation that
Curtis' tormented baby sitter, Laurie Strode, is actually the
sister of mad masked murderer Michael Myers.
</P>
<P>
   Twenty years after that fateful October night, we find Strode,
who has changed her name to Teri Tate, running a tony co-ed
boarding school set in a conveniently isolated California canyon.
How she does her job is anybody's guess, since Laurie/Teri is a
total wreck: addicted to booze and tranquilizers, bitter about a
divorce (she's having a desultory affair with an expendable
guidance counselor played by Adam Arkin) and borderline
schizophrenic. Hallucinations of Myers visitations increase as the
20th anniversary of his attack nears.
</P>
<P>
   This characterization, if you haven't guessed, is the film's
good idea. About the only thing keeping the poor woman together is
her love for her son, John (newcomer Josh Hartnett), a senior at
the school who is chafing under his mother's increasingly
unreasonable overprotectiveness.
</P>
<P>
   While most of the student body is off on a Halloween camping
trip, John stays behind on the now creepy, semi-deserted campus
with his girlfriend Molly (``Dawson's Creek's'' Michelle Williams)
and another young couple. Mom doesn't know they're there, but
somehow Uncle Michael does, and he breaks out of the asylum just to
make their holiday a memorable one.
</P>
<P>
   Directed by Steve Miner, who was responsible for several entries
in the inferior ``Friday the 13th'' splatter series, ``H20''
incorporates most of the ideas films like this slashed to death
long ago. Curtains billow, the predator is impossibly, ridiculously
unstoppable, and he really doesn't like the idea of young people
having sex.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Miner is more interested in atmospherics than explicit gore,
which is both a blessing and a curse. Relentless, subjective
tracking shots, sudden inexplicable appearances and musical motifs
borrowed from Carpenter's original score are the main component
parts of the film's suspense-building strategy. Just like they have
been for dozens of horror movies made since 1978.
</P>
<P>
   The picture's humor is much more pleasing, partially due to its
restraint. ``H20'' is not nearly as jokey as the ``Scream'' movies
``Halloween'' so satisfyingly inspired, despite the participation
of those films' creator, Kevin Williamson, as an executive producer
and uncredited writer here. Indeed, ``H20's'' film-savvier gags are
clearly Williamson's doing; keep an eye out for all the ``Psycho''
references in the cameo appearance by Curtis' mother, Janet Leigh.
</P>
<P>
   And Curtis herself is ``H20's'' saving grace, literally and
figuratively. Both fierce and funny, she's so alive in every scene
she's like a one-woman riposte to the movie's _ and the genre's _
sick obsession with death. Beyond that, she projects Laurie
Strode's poignancy with a tough economy that never begs for
sympathy _ and when the time comes to face the demon that's haunted
Laurie for 20 years, well, Curtis leaves no doubt that blood is
thicker than many of us would like to think.

THE NIGHT SHE CAME HOME
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BOB STRAUSS 
c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ &UR;  &LR; Jamie Lee Curtis was on a crusade. And, much like
those fervent missions of the Middle Ages, it was a darn bloody
business.
</P>
<P>
   ``I truly believed, with all of my heart, that if I told the
story right, people would love it because they would understand
that I'm telling the truth.''
</P>
<P>
   The truth? The sixth sequel to John Carpenter's genre-defining,
20-year-old box-office monster once again has Curtis' Laurie Strode
_ erstwhile Illinois baby sitter, now divorced, alcoholic and
delusional headmistress of an isolated California boarding school _
menaced by her psychotic, demon-possessed brother Michael Myers,
the serial killer who can't be killed.
</P>
<P>
   Although the first ``Halloween'' movie, which was the
then-teen-age Curtis' film-starring debut and her coronation as
Scream Queen of a generation, stuck relatively close to the laws of
physics and biological stamina, future installments spun further
and further out into supernatural Cuckooland. Rival franchises like
the ``Friday the 13th'' and ``Nightmare on Elm Street'' splatter
series were even more fantastic and, as the '80s wore on, witlessly
formulaic and gruesome.
</P>
<P>
   But Curtis, who dropped out of the horror genre after the 1981
``Halloween II'' to pursue a solid career in dramatic and comedy
films (``Trading Places,'' ``Love Letters,'' ``A Fish Called
Wanda,'' ``True Lies''), felt that there was something real that
the degenerate genre never got around to depicting. That was the
kernel of her concept for a 20th-anniversary return to the old,
horrific haunts.
</P>
<P>
   ``This was a chance to be responsible about horror movies,''
says Curtis, remarkably sinewy and strong-willed at age 39. ``To
really show the horror of this kind of situation, when something
like this actually happens to somebody. My idea was let's not
sugarcoat this, let's tell the truth.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know, I used to pride myself that I always played the
survivor. Well, bull; she survived nothing. She has her life but
she has no soul, because Michael stole everything from her that
would help somebody have a happy life. She has nothing, and why not
take that as the center of this story? Then, give her an
opportunity to confront the monster who did this to her.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis tried to interest original ``Halloween'' director
Carpenter in her concept, but he was noncommital. She also
approached Bob Weinstein, the head of Miramax Films' genre division
Dimension, whose Kevin Williamson-scripted ``Scream'' movies have
recently revitalized the moribund splatter cycle with knowing humor
and pro-active female protagonists.
</P>
<P>
   But the project remained in the dream stage until Curtis went to
North Carolina to film the upcoming sci-fi thriller ``Virus.''
Williamson was supervising the first episodes of his hit TV series,
``Dawson's Creek,'' nearby, and Steve Miner, who was directing the
pilot episode, knew Curtis from ``Forever Young,'' a film they had
made together.
</P>
<P>
   A rabid fan of Curtis, Williamson insisted on an introduction,
at which she eagerly described her ``H20'' idea. Williamson
subsequently produced a 12-page treatment of Curtis' concept out
of, pretty much, the love in his heart. He has an executive
producer credit on the film now, but claims that he was otherwise
paid nothing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Who needs a contract or a writing credit?'' Williamson asks
rhetorically and, some would say, insanely. ``My agents were going,
`Why did you do this? You get no residuals. Are you out of your
mind?' Hey, I got my reward. I mean, I got to work with Jamie Lee
Curtis; that's what I got out of it.''
</P>
<P>
   And he came back for more. After Robert Zappia and Matt
Greenberg had turned in their script drafts, someone got the bright
idea of giving Janet Leigh a role in ``H20.'' Curtis refused to ask
her mother to participate, however, unless it was really something
special. Williamson ended up writing bits that made sly references
to Leigh's own classic scream queen performance in Alfred
Hitchcock's ``Psycho.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie called and said, `My mom will only be in the movie if
it's a really cool part. You've got to write it in, make it happen
and make it worthwhile for her.' I know I shouldn't talk to her
when she wants something, and she knows I'll always agree to it.
I'm under her spell.''
</P>
<P>
   Balancing intense commitment with a down-to-earth work ethic and
irrepressible sense of fun, Curtis elicits the same adoration from
her co-workers as she does from fans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Jamie Lee is extremely collaborative,'' says Miner, who'd made
films in the ``Friday the 13th'' series and wound up directing
``H20.'' ``And as an actress she's so honest. Of course, she's an
honest person, and it just comes through. And there's something
about her that people really like and they can relate to it. She's
got something special, as all movie stars do.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis says her no-nonsense demeanor is, paradoxically, the
result of having famous movie star parents (Leigh and Jamie Lee's
father, Tony Curtis, divorced when she was a toddler).
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not like a suit that I wear, like, `I'm going to be a
professional today','' Curtis says. ``But I think it's an example
that's ingrained in you from a very early age. Second-generation
actors just know that they have to be there for every other actor
in the piece, even if you're not on camera and you could have gone
home four hours earlier.''
</P>
<P>
   Curtis and her husband, comic actor (``This Is Spinal Tap'') and
writer-director (``Waiting for Guffman'') Christopher Guest, try to
keep their own children, 11-year-old Annie and 2-year-old Tom, as
far from the more advanced hype aspects of Hollywood as possible.
</P>
<P>
   ``My husband eschews all of this completely,'' she says of show
biz's glitzier excesses. They've been the same way about English
nobility; she has been Lady Haden Guest since 1996, when Chris
inherited a seat in Britain's House of Lords, though attending
Parliament is rarely on his schedule.
</P>
<P>
   As for herself, Curtis favors minimal makeup, short unruly hair
and baggy clothes, perhaps a reaction to having once been referred
to as the Body. And her big passion _ ``H20'' aside _ these days is
in the decidedly less-celebrated field of writing children's books.
</P>
<P>
   She's had two best sellers, ``When I Was Little: A
Four-Year-Old's Memoir of Her Youth'' and ``Tell Me Again About the
Night I Was Born.'' Her latest, ``Today I Feel Silly and Other
Moods That Make My Day,'' is scheduled for a fall release.
</P>
<P>
   ``I get everything out of writing these,'' she says. ``I know
that my children's books are great; I feel it. It isn't the same
feeling I get from being in a successful movie. That's a drizzle of
feeling good about myself, but it's hard for me to attach my
self-esteem to that and trace it to something I really did to make
a difference. The genesis of these books comes from me, and that's
the most satisfying creative experience I've ever had.''
</P>
<P>
   And a far cry from splatter films, which is an irony not lost on
Curtis. More ironic: she can't stand watching scary movies. But she
does defend the shocker genre against charges that it inspires
real-life violence.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't see where Michael Myers coming back encourages kids to
shoot other kids,'' she says. ``I understand that there will always
be an argument that violence in film causes violence, and I'm not
in a position to deny that. But I'm not sure horror movies come
into play there. I still believe that they're entertainment and the
audience of people who love this genre are not violent. In fact, I
think many of them use this as some sort of vent for their violent
nature; they like to see it on the screen so they don't have to act
it out in their real life.''
</P>
<P>
   At least in the case of ``H20,'' horror films have enabled Jamie
Lee Curtis to live out a feeling of creative control that, quite
honestly, she's never experienced before in her movie career.
</P>
<P>
   ``All of the molding that I did for this movie has paid off and
is the thing people are now responding to,'' she says. ``It's the
first time I've ever understood how it feels to be omnipotent _ so
forgive me, I'm flush with success. And this isn't about box
office; this is about reaction. When I hear test audiences cheering
and screaming, I feel great because I know I've made a good
movie.''

ICONIC PRINCESS DIANA STILL IN SPOTLIGHT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROB LOWMAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ In the new book ``Diana: Portrait of a Princess,''
Jayne Fincher quotes the princess as saying, ``Brain the size of a
pea, I've got.'' Such self-deprecating remarks we know were far
from the truth, but they contributed to widely varying and, at
times, contradictory images of a woman who captivated much of the
world, whether as a beautiful princess, a fashion icon, a mother, a
champion of humanitarian causes or some combination of all of them.
</P>
<P>
   With the first anniversary of her death coming up on Aug. 31,
you can expect to be inundated with books, TV specials and news
coverage, and tributes to Diana, who died as a result of injuries
in a Paris car crash. Expect these looks at her life to range from
the tasteful to the tasteless, from the maudlin to the supposedly
hard-hitting.
</P>
<P>
   On Aug. 12, William Morrow will publish ``The Day Diana Died''
by Christopher Andersen (``Jackie After Jack''), which promises
through ``confidential police documents'' to answer some of the
questions about events surrounding the princess's death, including
the queen's reaction and the ``real'' story behind her driver's
``drinking and pill popping.''
</P>
<P>
   In one extreme instance, Philip Nobile discusses in Prospect
magazine whether Diana's soul belongs in heaven, purgatory or hell.
Nobile, who describes himself as an American journalist who once
studied for the Catholic priesthood, seems to be leaning toward
purgatory or hell. ``Princess Diana's soul was in dire peril of
damnation on the evening of Aug. 30,'' he writes, ``assuming that
she and Emad `Dodi' Al Fayed had committed unrepented fornication
(`carnal union between an unmarried man and an unmarried woman')
during their romantic holiday in France.'' Do we really need this?
No.
</P>
<P>
   Fincher, who took her first picture of Diana in 1980 when she
was 19-year-old Lady Diana Spencer, aims for a balanced look at the
princess in her book, which comes out Aug. 31 (Simon &AMP; Schuster in
association with Callaway Editions; $35).
</P>
<P>
   A photographer for the royal family for 20 years, Fincher offers
this assessment of the late princess: ``Diana was not always as
angelic as most of her admirers seem to think and could, at times,
be extremely difficult to work with. She was human like the rest of
us. Of course, she was also compassionate and kind, eternally
elegant and enthusiastic. But I remember best that she was fun.''
</P>
<P>
   It will be hard to avoid the Diana frenzy of the next month, but
``Diana: Portrait of a Princess,'' which has more than 500 color
photographs (supposedly ``75 percent'' never published), clearly
shows why she held such fascination. She was perhaps the closest
thing to a real-life ``Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   We watched her grow from a shy, awkward-looking teen to a mother
and then to a worldly, sophisticated woman. We watched the fairy
tale turn sour and then watched her seek happiness. We watched her
grow from a royal ornament to an advocate for good causes. And we
watched ...
</P>
<P>
   Fincher was in position to capture much of this _ from the early
joy to her estrangement from Prince Charles to the outpouring of
grief at her death. With Diana's untimely death, it's no longer a
``show'' but a time capsule. We no longer wait for the next
installment but look back and wonder what might have been.

THE PEACH'S PROGRESS FROM SNACK TO CULINARY STAR 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By JOHN WILLOUGHBY and CHRIS SCHLESINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The peach, unlike many other common fruits, has rarely found its
full glory in culinary America. We love it raw, we bake it in pies
and freeze it in ice cream. But we almost never cook it as part of
a main course.
</P>
<P>
   And yet there is a long and honored tradition in which the peach
plays a leading role in savory courses _ and until you've grilled
one, we swear, you'll never know what you've been missing.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, there's a lot about the peach that has been lost
beneath the cover of familiarity: it is a fruit with a rich
history. It originated in China, where in ancient times it was
highly prized as an emblem of immortality and romantic love.
</P>
<P>
   Over the centuries, peaches made their way overland to Persia,
where they became so deeply imbedded in the cooking of the region
that Westerners labeled them ``Persian apples.''
</P>
<P>
   During the years of the Byzantine Empire, ultrasophisticated
cooks in the kitchens of the Topkapi Palace in what is now Istanbul
took a cue from the Persians they had conquered and created a range
of dishes in which peaches, along with other fruits like apricots
and pomegranates, were combined with meat. The sweetness and
underlying tang of the fruits, they found, sharpened as well as
enhanced the flavors of the meats.
</P>
<P>
   Following in this tradition, we like to combine meat and
peaches, but thread them together on skewers for quick, easy
cooking. We also find that relishes and chutneys made with peaches,
whether cooked or uncooked, provide a sweet-sour combination that
perfectly complements grilled meats, fish and poultry.
</P>
<P>
   As always with fruit, selection is important. Late summer, when
good-quality peaches are readily available, is the ideal time to
explore their culinary potential. For the next three to four weeks,
they are at their peak: sweet as honey, supremely juicy, with downy
skin and deep, rich flavors overlaid with a floral aroma that
proclaims the peach's membership in the rose family.
</P>
<P>
   Peaches come in more than 2,000 hybrid varieties. Many of these
are clingstone peaches, which have very firm flesh that clings
tenaciously to the pit. They are used primarily for canning and are
of little interest to the cook.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, cooks look to freestone or semi-freestone peaches,
which have soft-textured fruit that readily separates from the pit.
</P>
<P>
   Freestones are classified primarily by the color of their flesh.
Delicate white-fleshed varieties, somewhat sweeter than their
yellow counterparts, were the most widely grown peaches in earlier
centuries and are rapidly regaining popularity. Among them,
saucer-shape, white-flesh ``doughnut'' peaches have begun to appear
in produce markets.
</P>
<P>
   Yellow-fleshed peaches, though, are by far the most common
varieties in the United States today. They are almost all
descendants of a Chinese peach brought to the United States in
1850, which was crossbred to create the Belle, the J.H. Hale and,
most popular of all, the Elberta, a sturdy, sweet peach, which for
decades has been the most widespread variety in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Any of these peaches are fine for savory applications, and in
reality many shoppers will have little choice. Peaches found in
supermarkets, for example, are usually labeled simply ``peaches.''
The challenge then becomes to select the best specimens of the
variety offered.
</P>
<P>
   Since peaches, as opposed to fruits like apples and pears, do
not develop any more sugar after they are picked, the most
important quality of any peach is its ripeness. Color is only
marginally helpful in determining this.
</P>
<P>
   Despite the love of poets for the pink blush of a perfectly ripe
peach, the rosy color is a sign of the peach's variety, not its
ripeness.
</P>
<P>
   But peaches with a greenish background color should be avoided:
that is a sign that they were picked too early. Texture is another
clue to ripeness. A ripe peach will give slightly when pushed but
is not mushy. But as with mangoes, the best way to know a peach is
by its aroma. A sniff at the stem end should detect a sweet, light
floral aroma.
</P>
<P>
   Even those who are not skilled at assessing peach ripeness can
look forward to great success with many of the dishes here, since
cooking deepens and enriches the flavor of even second-rate
peaches. This is especially true of high-heat cooking methods like
grilling, which cause some of the sugar in the fruit to caramelize,
adding a complex layer of flavor.
</P>
<P>
   All peaches need to be handled gently, because they bruise
easily. In particular, care should be taken when pitting peaches.
There is nothing more irritating than making mush out of a
perfectly good peach by pushing too hard on it while trying to
remove the pit.
</P>
<P>
   To avoid this problem, place a knife point at the stem end of
the peach and halfway around from the seam line. Cut the fruit from
pole to pole, then twist the halves in opposite directions. The
halves should separate easily, and the pit should be whole and easy
to remove. &QL;

<P>
   Women in Latin America know they are alone when it comes to
protecting themselves against sexual crimes. But in few countries
are they as defenseless as in Mexico, where the police who are paid
to protect them often become the source of their terror.
</P>
<P>
   An entire battalion of the Mexican police _ 24 in all _ is being
accused of sexually abusing and raping three teen-age girls. Nine
of them have already been identified by the victims.
</P>
<P>
   The girls _ age 13, 15 and 18 _ were walking down the streets of
Xochimilco, a suburb of southern Mexico City, at 10 o'clock on July
19, a tranquil Sunday night. A police van stopped. The girls got
in. It is unclear whether the policemen stopped to ask the girls
for directions and then forced them in or if the girls needed
directions and got into the vehicle voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Either way, once in the van, the three girls were driven to a
place that can only be described as hell _ a horse stable, property
of the police force. There, for four nights, they were forced to do
as they were told. They were humiliated by the many men in uniform
who dropped by and demanded to be served _ to be waited on and
cooked for. The girls were tortured and sexually molested. The
youngest two were raped.
</P>
<P>
   Today they are free _ and fortunate to be alive _ because the
18-year-old was able to escape and luckily found the rare policeman
who would listen to her and take action rather than join the tragic
escapade.
</P>
<P>
   The story, as pitiful and horrific as it is, is not surprising.
It stands as an indictment of the state of the police force in
Mexico, as well as a reminder of the fear women in Latin America
must live with every day.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers estimate that an average of 82 rapes are committed
in Mexico City daily. Few are reported. Mexican women, like other
women in Latin America, know they are on their own when it comes to
sexual crimes. The justice systems see rape with the same eyes and
the same attitudes that characterize most Latin men: husbands who
believe that demanding sex is a conjugal right or judges who first
will decide if the victim of rape is an ``honest'' woman or an
``indecent'' one before reaching a verdict.
</P>
<P>
   A Peruvian judge is reported to have asked a victim: ``Are you a
virgin? And if you are not, why do you complain?'' With attitudes
like this, it is not surprising that women prefer to remain silent.
</P>
<P>
   In Mexico, those who file complaints face the sad fact that a
mere 15 percent of reported cases will be investigated. This is
hardly the first time Mexico City's police force has been accused
of rape. In 1990, five policemen were arrested for engaging in wild
rampages in which they raped 19 young women.
</P>
<P>
   In the summer of 1991, El Financiero, one of the city's main
newspapers, reported on a woman who had been raped by policemen _
on three separate occasions. When Cristina Rivera Vargas testified
in a rental dispute against her landlady in court, she was
threatened: If she didn't retract her testimony, she would ``regret
it.'' Two days later, as she walked outside, an unidentified group
of men suggested that she do what her landlady had told her or
else, plain and simple, they would kill her. Less than two weeks
later, Rivera was forced inside a car, raped and left on the side
of the road.
</P>
<P>
   Bravely she filed a complaint.
</P>
<P>
   During the investigation, she identified one of her rapists: a
police officer. She was confident that justice would be served when
prosecutors attending her case assured her ``everything was going
well.'' A month later, Rivera was again abducted, taken to a house
complete with electric-shock torture devices and beaten
unconscious. She woke up next to a trash can.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera went back to the police, this time to drop the charges.
But the policemen continued to harass her, demanding extortion
money. They set a deadline for her to deliver the amount of cash
they wanted. She didn't. Three months later she was snatched again
from home. A young man found her, at five in the morning _
staggering by the train tracks, her hands tied, her mouth taped _
and took her to a hospital.
</P>
<P>
   Rivera's case probably followed the same fate as most of
Mexico's rape complaints _ of those 15 percent that are
investigated, only 15 percent ever make it to a verdict. Rape is
not a serious felony _ not in Mexico and not in the rest of the
region. Until recently, most Latin American constitutions saw rape
as a crime against the state, not a crime committed against the
body and soul of one woman.
</P>
<P>
   A Latin woman does not only have to fear being raped by her
husband or by a policeman. She might very well find herself walking
down the aisle, marrying her own rapist. Fourteen Latin American
countries _ Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica,
Ecuador, Guatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru,
the Dominican Republic and Venezuela _ will acquit a rapist who
offers to marry the victim. In Costa Rica, the law is so extreme
that she doesn't even need to accept _ just the offer is enough.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Cuauhtemoc Cardenas, the first opposition-party leader of
Mexico City in 70 years _ who is widely regarded as a presidential
frontrunner in 2000 _ has an opportunity to change the system, to
end the immunity with which rape is treated by Latin America's
justice systems. Indeed the director of the investigation has
announced she will ask for the maximum sentence of 50 years.
</P>
<P>
   Let's hope that this case does not join the 85 percent of those
that never come to trial and that, if it is tried, it will not be
by men who put the onus on the victims. Or by men who think like
the Peruvian military general in ``Untold Terror: Violence Against
Women,'' a December '92 Human Rights Watch report, who said that
rape is an occasional regrettable ``excess'' committed by his
troops. ``Boys,'' he said, are far from their families and suffer a
great deal of tension because of the nature of combat. They get
their aggression out by raping women.''
</P>
<P>
   With protectors like this, where can a woman in Latin America
start feeling safe?

<TEXT>
<P>
   A wedding cake symbolizes the abundance of blessings to come in
a marriage and, as such, it should be spectacular. While no bride
is expected to design her own cake, you can certainly bring ideas
to the person who will create a cake for you. Here is some
information to get you started.
 &UR; SELECTING YOUR CAKE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   You can order a wedding cake from the hotel or caterer
responsible for the rest of your reception, hire a specialty cake
designer or enlist the help of a talented amateur baker. Whichever
you choose, it's important to plan ahead. Four to six months before
your wedding date is not too early to reserve the services of a
professional and to establish your basic cake design.
</P>
<P>
   Fortunately, it's easy to comparison shop for wedding cakes, as
prices are calculated per number of servings. The more elaborate
your cake, the more you can expect to pay: Prices range from a
couple of dollars per slice for a simple cake from a local bakery
to as much as $15 per slice for an exquisite cake from a celebrated
cake designer.
</P>
<P>
   One option for reducing costs is to order a smaller wedding cake
to be displayed, then feed the majority of your guests from sheet
cakes. This can be accomplished very discreetly; after the official
cake cutting, the cake is whisked away to be sliced into servings
out of sight of the guests.
</P>
<P>
   When choosing a cake designer, familiarize yourself with his or
her style by looking at photographs of cakes, but don't forget to
have a tasting, too _ a wedding cake should be as delicious as it
is beautiful.
</P>
<P>
   A snowy-white cake is traditional, but if that doesn't appeal to
you, feel perfectly free to choose your favorite cake. Chocolate,
lemon poppy-seed, even carrot cakes are appearing more and more
frequently at today's weddings.
</P>
<P>
   Butter cream is the most popular frosting for wedding cakes, and
for good reason: It is light and delicious. Unfortunately, butter
cream doesn't hold up well in heat, so if you are holding an
outdoor reception, your cake designer may suggest rolled fondant,
which has a lovely, matte finish, resembling porcelain. Fondant is
not as luscious as butter cream, but it holds up well and even
helps preserve a cake.
</P>
<P>
   Marzipan, made of almond paste, is another alternative which is
used similarly to rolled fondant.
</P>
<P>
   Butter cream, fondant and marzipan are all used to make cake
decorations, but here, the options widen. Royal icing dries very
hard, so it produces delicate and long-lasting decorations. Gum
paste is thick and malleable, ideal for realistic reproductions of
fruits, flowers and other forms. Meringue can be used for
beautiful, airy decorations, and white and dark chocolate make
delicious embellishments.
 &UR; DECORATING IDEAS &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Victorians introduced the white three-tiered cake balanced
on columns that is still the most common style seen today. You can
choose to build on that theme or to seek out a different effect
altogether. If you are having an informal country wedding, why not
choose a single-tiered cake bordered by fresh sunflowers instead?
</P>
<P>
   The following are some of my favorite ways to decorate cakes.
For more ideas, look for the new issue of Martha Stewart Living
Weddings on newsstands.
</P>
<P>
   _ A cake can be inspired by a detail of your gown. Lace, a
ribbon or bow, rosettes, coils of fabric, a row of buttons or
pearls _ any of these can be re-created in icing, gum paste,
meringue or marzipan and repeated all over the surface or used as a
starting point for the design.
</P>
<P>
   _ The beauty of real flowers is unsurpassed. Use flowers that
mirror the composition of your bouquet or table centerpieces. (Make
sure they have not been sprayed with chemicals; even so, treat
flowers as a garnish unless they were specifically grown to be
eaten.)
</P>
<P>
   _ Fruit can be used for a less formal effect. Berries, tiny
champagne grapes and miniature pears are among my favorites. Fresh
fruit can be coated with egg whites (reconstituted powdered whites
are safer than fresh ones) and dipped in superfine sugar for a
lovely, softened effect.
</P>
<P>
   _ Piped boldly across the top of the cake or scrolled at the
border of each tier, the first initial of a couple's newly shared
surname _ or your intertwined initials _ makes an elegant symbol of
your new union.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lastly, consider the way the cake will be presented. A canopy
of sheer netting can lend drama while keeping bugs away at an
outdoor reception, while a cake stand can echo a seasonal theme if
you surround it with fresh spring flowers, colorful autumn leaves
or winter evergreen boughs.
 &UR; THE GROOM'S CAKE &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The tradition of serving a groom's cake is well worth reviving.
Usually a dark cake such as chocolate or a fruitcake, the groom's
cake is sometimes served at the reception in addition to the
wedding cake, but more often, individual slices of the cake are
packed into small white boxes and given to guests as they leave.
</P>
<P>
   There is a legend that if a single woman goes to sleep with a
slice of groom's cake beneath her pillow, she will dream of her
future husband.

 askMartha: WHAT ARE YOUR IDEAS FOR MAKING SHADOW BOXES? 
 Includes color slide of a shadow box featuring a bottle, leaves and
photographs. CREDIT: PHOTO BY WILLIAM ABRANOWICZ  By MARTHA STEWART  
 (Distributed by New York Times Special Features)  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Shadow boxes, both functional and decorative, are to
three-dimensional objects what frames are to paintings. Though
often thought of as glass-enclosed display cases for untouchable
items, shadow boxes actually make excellent homes for casual
presentations of everyday objects.
</P>
<P>
   For displaying precious items, shadow boxes can be fitted with
non-reflective glass so that the pieces can be viewed but not
affected by air and dust. But for most arrangements, a simple open
box will do the job with style and elegance.
 &UR; MAKING A SHADOW BOX &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Chances are, you already have everything you need to make a
shadow box. You can create one from an old crate, a cabinet with
its door removed or a drawer. For children, sturdy cardboard boxes,
available at craft stores, make great shadow boxes.
</P>
<P>
   You can also construct simple square boxes from plywood; they
can be arranged in a series or used individually. To make a 12-inch
cube, you'll need five pieces of 3/4-inch-thick plywood. The side
pieces should be 12 inches long by 9 inches wide, the top and
bottom pieces 10 1/2 inches long by 9 inches wide, and the back
piece 12 inches square. (Of course, a shadow box can be made in any
other size by altering these dimensions.)
</P>
<P>
   Use wood glue to attach the ends of the bottom and top boards to
the inside edges of the side boards; secure with finishing nails.
Glue on the back and secure with more nails. Sand any rough spots
smooth.
</P>
<P>
   The finished boxes can be placed on a shelf, hung with
picture-hanging hardware or screwed right into the wall through
their back panels.
</P>
<P>
   Part of what transforms an ordinary box into a shadow box is
embellishment. The most basic way to enhance a shadow box is to
paint it. First apply a primer, then paint the entire box a uniform
color. As an alternative, with a sectioned box or cabinet, you
could paint each compartment a different, but compatible, color.
</P>
<P>
   Another option is to line a box with fabric. Silk is a luxurious
choice, though any fabric in a simple, unobtrusive pattern will do.
The easiest way to do this is to cut out pieces of card stock in
the sizes of the back, sides, top and bottom panels of your box,
minus 1/8-inch all around. Stretch a piece of fabric over each
piece of card stock, fold the edges over the back and tape into
place. Then glue each piece into the box using craft glue.
</P>
<P>
   For a ``themed'' shadow box, lining the sides and back with
paper may be the best choice. Old documents, letters, gift wrap,
maps _ originals or photocopies _ can complement the objects you
arrange inside the box. Simply crop the papers to size, brush with
craft glue and carefully apply. With smaller papers, overlap them
for a collage effect.
</P>
<P>
   The front edge of the shadow box shouldn't be neglected. Use
craft glue to apply ribbon (in a width equal to the thickness of
the edge), or small objects such as buttons, pebbles or tiny
shells. A picture frame, with its backing removed, can make a more
formal border. Look for one in the same height and width of the
box, and use small nails to hold it in place.
 &UR; WHAT TO DISPLAY? &LR;  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Here are some ideas to get you started:
</P>
<P>
   _ HEIRLOOM BOX: In a shadow box, family heirlooms and prized
collectibles are on display and accessible. A shadow box can house
a single exquisite teacup, a favorite vase, a collection of blown
glass, a framed picture or almost anything else you cherish.
</P>
<P>
   _ TOY BOX: Creating a shadow box is a wonderful rainy-day
project for children. Dime-store toys, photographs and clippings
from magazines can be glued into a cardboard box, or you can gather
natural decorations _ dried leaves and flowers, pinecones, seeds _
to work with.
</P>
<P>
   _ MEMORY BOX: A memory box is like a three-dimensional
scrapbook. Display memorabilia from trips and events, such as
postcards, snapshots, maps, shells found on the beach _ or whatever
souvenirs best capture the experience.
</P>
<P>
   _ CONVERSATION BOX: The most ordinary items take on special
significance, and become interesting conversation pieces, when
arranged in a shadow box. Buttons sewn on a card, beautiful old
spools of thread, a few bottles in interesting shapes, antique keys
_ the choices are limited only by your imagination.
</P>
<P>
   _ WEDDING BOX: This is a perfect, lasting display for those
little items that have special meaning. (Since you'll be far too
busy on your wedding day to concern yourself with collecting such
items, ask a friend or relative to set them aside for you.) Some
items to include: an invitation, a menu, dried flowers, guest
favors, a candid snapshot from the reception, a glass, the cork
from a champagne bottle, sheet music from your wedding song.

 By RUTH REICHL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ For me, one of this city's chief pleasures is the
opportunity to eat really authentic ethnic food. In other cities,
immigrants are usually forced to intermingle, but the geography of
Los Angeles encourages people to stick with their own kind.
</P>
<P>
   The city is dotted with dense communities where it would be easy
to live without ever having to speak English. This sheer
concentration encourages restaurants to specialize: for example,
while New York has Thai restaurants, Los Angeles has establishments
that specialize in the food of the Thai city of Chiang Mai or of
the island of Phuket.
</P>
<P>
   Lately, it seems, a group of people from the state of Oaxaca
(pronounced wa-HA-ka), on Mexico's southern coast, have moved out
of East Los Angeles, where there has long been a concentrated
Mexican community, to the Palms area to the west, near Culver City.
And where you find Oaxacans, you find Oaxacan restaurants.
</P>
<P>
   It is a fascinating cuisine, one known for its moles, which are
rich sauces made of chilies, nuts, seeds and sometimes unsweetened
chocolate. Oaxaca also has its own version of pizza, the clayuda, a
large, thin corn tortilla spread with pureed black beans, cheese,
salsa and lettuce and then topped with cecina, a chili-marinated
pork; with tasajo, which is grilled beef, or with tiny round
chorizo sausage.
</P>
<P>
   Oaxacans make wonderful tamales, too, the steamed corn mixture
slightly sweetened and filled with shredded chicken in a black mole
that is slightly bitter.
</P>
<P>
   In Palms, you find these dishes _ along with fabulous huevos
rancheros and the most seductive chili-marinated fried pork ribs _
at Guelaguetza (pronounced GAY-la-GET-za), a modest family-owned
restaurant in a shopping center parking lot.
</P>
<P>
   The air is rich with the aroma of ground chilies and herbs and
alive with plaintive Mexican music. Although it looks like a
fast-food place, Guelaguetza takes its time; the food is cooked
slowly and well.
</P>
<P>
   Oaxaca is famous for seven moles; Guelaguetza makes only four,
but each is utterly delicious. The herbal green one is made from
fresh chilies, the herb epazote and hierba santa, a plant with big
dark green leaves that have a haunting flavor. The yellow mole
features cloves and cumin. The red one, despite your expectations,
is actually quite mild, a less impressive version of the intensely
powerful black mole, made with chilies, nuts, seeds, spices and
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   My favorite time to visit the restaurant is on Sunday mornings,
when it is filled with young Mexican families. I love to watch the
parents ordering baskets of special Oaxacan breads and sweet rolls
for their children, who wash them down with chilacayota, a sweet
drink made from squash, cinnamon and dark brown sugar, or
champurrado, a drink made from corn flour and topped with
chocolate.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the parents feast on salsa de chicharron, which is
fried pork skin with salsa, or fresh Oaxacan cheese with salsa and
beans. For them, this is more than just a meal; they are sharing a
little taste of home. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   (italics)Guelaguetza is at 11127 Palms Boulevard, Los Angeles;
(310) 837-8600. A sister restaurant is near downtown Los Angeles,
at 3337{ West Eighth Street; (213) 427-0601. The food is
ridiculously inexpensive: nothing on the menu costs more than
$7.(end italics)

NO MORE SITCOMS, SEINFELD SAYS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL BLOWEN  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; NEW YORK _ Jerry Seinfeld, the star of one of the most
succesful shows in television history, says he'll never do another
situation comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't imagine doing another one. Only an idiot would think
they could do better,'' said Seinfeld, during a press conference
Tuesday, promoting his Sunday night live (9 p.m.) HBO special,
``I'm Telling You for the Last Time.''
</P>
<P>
   Wearing white slacks with a navy polo shirt under a gray jacket,
the 44-year-old comedian joked and jostled with the media over
subjects ranging from sex to money.
</P>
<P>
   While Seinfeld says he misses some of the things about the
ending of the phenomenal run of ``Seinfeld'' after 140 episodes,
he's relieved it's over. ``Did you ever take a dog to the park and
take his leash off,'' he asked asked rhetorically. ``The dog looks
up for a minute then bolts like a maniac.''
</P>
<P>
   Accompanied by by HBO's Marty Callner, who will be directing the
special live, Seinfeld explained that returning to stand-up was
liberating. For nine years he worked on a show with 100 crew
members, a dozen writers, and the cast. ``That was very much a
group thing,'' he said. ``Now I feel like the leash is off.''
</P>
<P>
   He has no plans to take a vacation. ``I've been on beaches,'' he
said. ``I've been on boats.'' Then he shrugged his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   While Seinfeld is not retiring from stand-up, he is retiring all
the material from Sunday night's program. ``You'll never hear these
jokes again,'' he promised.
</P>
<P>
   He's planning to work on another special, presumably for HBO,
during the next eight months, and put out a comedy album based on
Sunday's performance.
</P>
<P>
   Tickets for the concert at the Broadhurst Theater are hot. The
New York Attorney General's office is investigating ticket
scalping. The going street rate for a ticket is $1,500, nearly 20
times the face value. Seinfeld is donating all of the proceeds from
the concert to PENCIL (Public Education Needs Civic Involvement in
Learning).
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't invent scalping, '' he said, pausing just long enough
for everyone to realize the absurdity of the situation. ``I don't
really have any control over it.''
</P>
<P>
   While ``Seinfeld'' will never be considered controversial, the
show did run into trouble with an episode in which Kramer
accidentally set a Puerto Rican flag on fire.
</P>
<P>
   ``I liked that episode,'' said Seinfeld. ``People forget that in
that episode Kramer was really looking forward to the Puerto Rican
Day parade and that the whole thing was an accident.''
</P>
<P>
   When asked if the protest of the episode by some Puerto Ricans
was legitimate or a politically correct over-reaction, Seinfeld
raised his eyebrows and shrugged his shoulders.
</P>
<P>
   While Seinfeld said that he doesn't have a favorite episode, he
did recall with great affection the one in which he mugs an elderly
woman for her loaf of marble rye. ``They brought in snow and we had
snowball fights at five in the morning, and I was trying to throw a
loaf of rye bread up to the fourth floor,'' he said. ``It was just
fun.''
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld refused to confirm the rumors that cast members from
the show, particularly Jason Alexander, might appear for his HBO
special.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I named who might come, it wouldn't be a suprise,'' he
said. ``How can there be suprise guests if there are no suprises?''
</P>
<P>
   Other Seinfeld observations:
</P>
<P>
   On fame: ``I've been anonymous. Being famous is better.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monica Lewinsky and President Clinton: ``Everyone lies about
sex. Truth and sex don't go together. Everyone lies during sex, so
truth just isn't going to happen.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   Q: The early episodes of ``Family Matters'' include a younger
sister named Judy who wasn't in any of the newer episodes. Why and
how was she cut from the show?
</P>
<P>
   _B.N., Azle, Tesas
</P>
<P>
   A: Judy, portrayed by Jaimee Foxworth, suffered the same
mysterious fate as Chuck Cunningham, Richie's older brother on
``Happy Days.'' She disappeared after the 1993 season and everyone
forgot she ever existed.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess Judy went upstairs to her room and never came back,''
Foxworth says on her World Wide Web site. ``She's probably still up
there.''
</P>
<P>
   Today, Jaimee and sisters Tyren and Jania perform as S.H.E., a
new group with a World Wide Web site at
www.interscoperecords.com//she.html. S.H.E. is scheduled to make
its first public appearance Aug. 13 in Yokohama, Japan.
</P>
<P>
   You can write to S.H.E. in care of Interscope Records, 70R
Woodland Ave., San Rafael, CA 94901.
</P>
<P>
   Q: Where can I call or write to the Black Beauty Ranch for more
information about visiting it?
</P>
<P>
   _V.S., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: Call (903) 469-3482 or visit the World Wide Web site
www.blackbeautyranch.org.
</P>
<P>
   The Black Beauty Ranch, a refuge for abused and abandoned
animals, is in Murchison, a town about 80 miles east of Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   It's closed to visitors throughout August due to the heat but
will reopen in September. Public visiting hours are 9 a.m.-4 p.m.
Saturdays.
</P>
<P>
   The ranch was founded in 1979 by Cleveland Amory and houses more
than 600 animals ranging from cats to elephants. Its mailing
address is Box 367, Murchison 75778.
</P>
<P>
   Q: What are the lyrics that Archie and Edith Bunker sang on
``All in the Family''?
</P>
<P>
   _F.M., Fort Worth
</P>
<P>
   A: The Bunkers sang the following as the show's theme:
</P>
<P>
   ``Boy the way Glenn Miller played/Songs that made the `Hit
Parade'/Guys like us, we had it made/Those were the days/And you
knew where you were then/Girls were girls and men were men/Mister,
we could use a man like Herbert Hoover again/Didn't need no welfare
state/Everybody pulled his weight/Gee, our old LaSalle ran
great/Those were the days!''
</P>
<P>
   The theme song is included on an extensive ``All in the Family''
World Wide Web site at www.aitf.com//index//.
</P>

<TEXT>
<P>
   CALIFORNIA -- GAYS-HEFLEY. (Expected.) A week after the House
narrowly passed an anti-gay rights measure targeted at San
Francisco's domestic partner law, the House is expected to vote on
a measure by Joel Hefley, R-Colo., that would overturn President
Clinton's executive order that prohibits federal job discrimination
against homosexuals. Zaret
</P>
<P>
   COLORADO -- FEC-SENATE. Is the Dottie Lamm Senate campaign in
trouble? The final FEC filing before the Aug. 11 primary shows Lamm
in financial straits -- nearly broke and with poor fundraising --
while Sen. Ben Campbell, R-Colo., has nearly $1.3 million in his
warchest. Did she overspend on her primary challenge from Gil
Romero? Zaret
</P>
<P>
   -- HEFLEY-GAYS. (Expected.) The House is expected to vote on a
measure by Joel Hefley, R-Colorado Springs, that would overturn
President Clinton's executive order that prohibits federal job
discrimination against homosexuals. The vote comes a week after the
House narrowly passed an anti-gay rights measure targeted at San
Francisco. Zaret
</P>
<P>
   MICHIGAN -- TEAMSTERS. After months of negotiations, Washington
lawmakers reportedly worked out a deal late Monday night to make $4
million available to help pay for the Teamsters' upcoming rerun
election. Wolfberg
</P>
<P>
   MULTICHANNEL -- COMMENT. Cable and satellite industries comment
on an FCC report about the status of competition in the cable
market. Maggi
</P>
<P>
   -- ALLEGE. House panel grills real estate developer about
allegations that he used political clout to get sweetheart deal
involving the FCC's move to a new building in southeast D.C.
(Working.) Maggi
</P>
<P>
   OHIO -- CREDIT-LATOURETTE. Credit unions secured an important
victory in Congress Tuesday, with final approval of a measure
spearheaded by Rep. Steve LaTourette, R-Madison Village, that
preserves expanded membership in the nation's federal non-profit
financial institutions. Egbert
</P>
<P>
   -- OXLEY-NASDAQ. The Commerce Subcommitteee on Finance and
Hazardous Materials, chaired by Rep. Mike Oxley, R-Findlay, held a
hearing Monday to explore the fairness and effectiveness of the
Small Order Execution System (SOES). Enacted in 1985, SOES allows
investors and individual traders to send orders of 1,000 shares or
less directly to NASDAQ market makers and have them immediately
filled. Some feel SOES has been hijacked by big investors at the
expense of ``little guy'' investors. Hurt
</P>
<P>
   -- HOBSON-FEC. In an era of high-spending campaigns, when some
candidates routinely tout enormous campaign coffers, Ohio's Seventh
District is home to a different kind of campaign this year. Gorman
</P>
<P>
   SOUTH CAROLINA -- SRS. An environmental group is challenging the
U.S. Department of Energy's plan to close high-level nuclear waste
tanks stored at the Savannah River Site. Williams
</P>
<P>
   TEXAS -- TILT-ROTOR. Bell-Helicopter will locate its plant to
build the V-22 Osprey in Amarillo. What did it take to keep the
project alive and get it to Amarillo after years of opposition?
(For Sunday.) Brown
</P>
<P>
   VIRGIN ISLANDS -- JEWELRY. Struggling Virgin Islands jewelry
manufacturers would receive special tax credits under trade
legislation passed by the House Tuesday. Williams
</P>
<P>
   -- REFUGEES. Supporters of legislation to extend permanent
resident status to Caribbean and Central American immigrants
Tuesday urged congressional leaders to take up the bill this year.
Feldman
</P>
<P>
   WISCONSIN -- FINANCE. Sen. Russ Feingold and Rep. Mark Neumann
have agreed to one of the most stringent campaign finance
agreements in the country, but that's where agreement on the issue
ends. As the bill makes its way through Congress, they're hoping
for opposite outcomes. Marlin

   CONGO-ASSESS (Abidjan, Ivory Coast) _ When rebellious Congolese
troops, announcing their intention of overthrowing President
Laurent Kabila, seized two large cities in the eastern part of the
country on Monday, many people had the impression that they were
reliving a familiar drama. In fact, in almost every detail, this
Central African nation is witnessing a near-exact replay of the
events two years ago that brought about the downfall of the
dictator, Mobutu Sese, Seko and the rise from obscurity to power of
Kabila. By Howard W. French.

<P>
   CANADA-INDIANS (New Aiyansh, B.C.) _ For the first time in more
than a century, Canada's federal government signed a comprehensive
treaty with west coast Indians today, giving a native group control
of a majestic swathe of pine forest, crystal rivers and towering,
snowy peaks along with the legal rights to run their own nation.
The Canadian government had hoped the treaty _ seen as a model for
dozens of other Indian land claims _ would foster the process of
reconciliation between natives and non-natives. But its most
immediate result so far has been division, suspicion and great
uncertainty throughout British Columbia and across Canada. By

 By WILLIAM GRIMES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Americans may be weak on foreign languages, but every
child from Portland, Maine, to Portland, Ore., loves one French
phrase _ a la mode. Forget what it means in France. Here in the
United States it means a scoop of ice cream added to a dessert,
usually a slice of pie. No matter how sophisticated the American
palate becomes, the idea of ice cream with dessert touches
something deep in the national psyche, one of the earliest
memories, both pure and sensual, of food as a passport to pleasure.
</P>
<P>
   A la mode lives on, but the ice cream has changed. It used to be
vanilla. Period. Now it's everything but. Weird tropical fruits and
spices have found their way into the frozen scoop that sits on the
dessert plate. The most unlikely recruits, including wine, tea,
herbs and flowers, have been whipped into fighting shape and thrown
into the front lines. When a seasonal flavor, like lemon, comes on
the menu, it gets twisted into a new shape, like lemon-buttermilk
or lemon-verbena.
</P>
<P>
   In American kitchens, ice cream makers are cranking out anything
that will freeze, hardly surprising, since cookbooks have left the
old peach and strawberry recipes miles behind. In ``New Tastes from
Texas,'' Stephan Pyles gives a recipe for cinnamon-buttermilk ice
cream, and Stephen Raichlen's ``Miami Spice'' offers a zinger of an
ice cream that calls for clove, cinnamon, anise and orange zest.
Even traditionalists have learned the new steps. The Better Homes
and Gardens cookbook, not exactly a crucible of experimentation,
has a recipe for chocolate-cherry-yogurt ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   It's the chefs who are on the far edge, however, hacking away at
the underbrush, hunting down flavors that would probably get them
thrown out the front door of Ben and Jerry's. Corn, for example.
</P>
<P>
   ``Corn makes perfect sense,'' said Wayne Brachman, the pastry
chef at Mesa Grill and Bolo. ``It starts out sweet, unlike
chocolate, which tastes like aspirin in the natural state. You
really have to do a lot to chocolate.''
</P>
<P>
   Brachman spikes his corn ice cream with a little bourbon and a
pinch of brown sugar and serves it with buckwheat-blueberry johnny
cakes. The taste is hard to describe. The first mouthful, sweet and
rich, is a tease. The ice cream is sweet and rich, but the flavor
is elusive, a rumor rather than a fact. Could it be? Surely not.
But yes, that's corn in there, and it works.
</P>
<P>
   There's very little that doesn't work, since ice cream is a
blank canvas. It can accommodate virtually any flavor, which makes
it a splendid vehicle for chefs who want to express regional or
ethnic ideas. At Vong, Serge Decrauzat has used the restaurant's
French-Asian cuisine as license to infuse his ice creams with
exotic spices. White-pepper ice cream a cool-hot paradox, has
become a signature at Vong, but Decrauzat has come up with a cumin
ice cream and a four-spice ice cream involving cubeb, black pepper,
mace and coriander.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most intriguing of all is the ice cream made with
galangal, a root from Southeast Asia that has a ginger flavor, with
a hint of anise and a sneaky pepper rush. ``If you put this on the
market, nobody would buy it,'' said Decrauzat, who pairs the ice
cream with a roasted peach and apricot-caramel sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Jose Flores, the pastry chef at Patria, a pan-Latin restaurant,
reached all the way to Miami for mamey, a West Indian fruit that
looks like a brown orange with pointy ends and tastes like a cross
between mango, sweet potato and apricot. Incorporated in an ice
cream, it strikes the perfect tropical note. And corn fits right
into Mesa Grill's southwestern cuisine. In Mexico, corn ice cream
is a standard. At Bolo, where the accent is Spanish, the menu
offers a sherry ice cream rolled in toasted pine nuts and
rosewater-pistachio.
</P>

   In Freudian terms, ice cream is infantile. More specifically, it
belongs to the polymorphous perverse stage of culinary development,
animated by the drive for pleasure and unrestricted by rules.
Chefs, without embarrassment, admit that they like to play with it.
They have fun dreaming up improbable flavor combinations and making
them work, although no one in New York has come near the
no-holds-barred approach of Coromoto, a shop in Merida, Venezuela,
that serves more than 700 varieties of ice cream, including such
outstanding flavors as squid, fried pork rind and tuna.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody up in Maine did lobster, and I heard it was pretty
good,'' said Gail Damerow, the author of ``Ice Cream! The Whole
Scoop.''
</P>
<P>
   No one in New York has yet crossed the fish frontier, but
chilies and peppers have turned up all over the place. ``Black
pepper works because you have the creaminess plus a kind of frozen
heat,'' said Laura Saynay, the pastry chef at Clementine. ``It's
very sexy.'' Ms. Saynay makes a dense, velvety cardamom ice cream,
whose fresh, lightly peppery attack comes on a wave of fruit and
lemon accents. It is an unexpected success. She fared less well
with an attempt at gooseberry ice cream. ``I can't think of a
polite way to describe what it was like,'' she said. ``It was
stringy, viscous and disgusting.''
</P>
<P>
   Every pastry chef can tell of a good ice-cream idea that went
horribly wrong. Decrauzat decided that cilantro would be worth a
try. It does not appear on the menu at Vong. Brachman tried to make
avocado ice cream. The avocado jammed the ice-cream machine,
resulting in a $500 repair bill.
</P>
<P>
   But for every experiment that blows up in the lab, chefs can
point to an improbable idea that worked out. At the Park Avenue
Cafe, Richard Leach has made a signature out of his Earl Grey tea
and chocolate ice cream, an adaptation of the tea and chocolate
ganaches he encountered in French pastries. Keng Leong, the pastry
chef at the Cub Room, has created a port-bordeaux ice cream that
not only delivers layer upon layer of tart fruitiness _ wine does
come from grapes, after all _ but also manages to retain some of
the flavor notes beloved of pretentious wine writers. This is a
well-knit ice cream with hints of chocolate, plums, and
raspberries. It can be eaten now.
</P>
<P>
   Tofu-anise, anyone? Eric Hubert, the pastry chef at Jean
Georges, came up with the combination when he worked at Otabe, a
Japanese restaurant in midtown. The tofu lightens the ice cream,
clearing the way for the intense, perfumy anise to fill the mouth.
Hubert describes his invention as though it was something he simply
tossed off in an idle moment _ nothing to get excited about. ``It's
not even Japanese,'' he said. ``Some hippies invented tofu ice
cream.'' At the same time, he is quite mysterious about the
tofu-anise connection. ``No recipes,'' he said. ``I use a different
type of sugar, and it took a lot of experimentation. I don't want
to just give it away.''
</P>
<P>
   There are, even at the outer fringe, some limitations. Fruits
like watermelon, cantaloupe and honeydew melon do not make
satisfying ice cream because of their high water content. Some
ingredients are hard to get. Ms. Saynay would love to use
elderflower, which smells like a baked vanilla cake, but it's a
scarce commodity.
</P>
<P>
   And not every flavor pleases. ``I hate all these basil and sage
ice creams, the ones that taste like frozen cream of mushroom
soup,'' Brachman said. ``People always say they are interesting,
which to me is like the blind date with a good personality. Ice
cream should be so delicious, you want to get sick on it.''
</P>
<P>
   That sentiment has somehow translated into serrano-chili ice
cream at Mesa Grill.
</P>
<P>
   As chefs push toward the far horizon, something odd seems to be
looming just ahead, a thrilling new concept, barely visible through
the heat-haze of frantic experimentation. It reared up as Hubert,
in a rapid-fire recitation of fascinating ingredients, suddenly
stopped, struck by a novel idea. ``You know, vanilla ice cream with
a chocolate chip cookie _ that's something incredible,'' he said.

 &HT;    HOMOCIDE RATE FOR YOUNG AMERICANS STARTING TO DROP
 &HT;    By JEFF NESMITH
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Although the reasons are far from clear, homicide
rates among young Americans have started to drop.
</P>
<P>
   Researchers from the National Center for Health Statistics in
Hyattsville, Md., said Tuesday that data from death certificates
show that between 1993 and 1995, the death rate from homicide for
persons 15 to 24 years old declined significantly after a
decade-long rise.
</P>
<P>
   The government statisticians reported that despite the downward
trend in recent years, the overall homicide rate among teenagers
and young adults is still high _ 71 percent higher in 1995 than it
was 1985.
</P>
<P>
   The downturn between 1993 and 1995 appears to have continued in
1996 and 1997 and is evident for whites and blacks, males and
females, in metropolitan and non-metropolitan areas, and for deaths
associated with the use of firearms as well as non-firearm
homicides, said Lois Fingerhut, an epidemiologist at the government
center.
</P>
<P>
   If the trends hold up and show that homicide rates peaked in
1993, the reasons are not yet evident.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an issue that has puzzled and delighted criminologists
and public health officials all over the country,'' said Dr. Arthur
Kellerman, director of the Emory University Center for Injury
Control in Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   ``Is it the Brady Bill (to control handgun purchases)? Is it
more opportunities for young people? Is it the fact that a lot of
kids have become sickened by the violence they see? Is it the
economy? I suspect it is all of the above,'' Kellerman said.
</P>
<P>
   The most significant percentage decrease was among blacks, a 12
percent annual decline among black males in major metropolitan
counties and an 18.2 percent decline among black females.
</P>
<P>
   In medium-sized metropolitan areas, homicide rates among black
males fell at an average rate of 17.8 percent a year, while the
decline among white males was 16.2. The decline among black females
was 12.9 percent in these counties and the annual decline among
white females averaged 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier studies showed that between 1987 and 1991, the degree to
which homicides accounted for deaths of Americans between ages of
15 and 24 grew by an average of around 19 percent per year. Between
1991 and 1993, the rate of increase slowed, ranging from annual
increases of 3.3 percent in large metropolitan counties to 11.7
percent in small metropolitan areas.
</P>
<P>
   And between 1993 and 1995, the statistics turned down: annual
decreases of 8.4 percent in large metropolitan counties, 4.4
percent in suburban counties, 15.3 percent in medium-sized
metropolitan areas and 7.9 percent in small metropolitan areas. The
downturn in counties that are not part of a metropolitan area was
8.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Kellerman said a number of police departments have started
trying to ``move upstream'' from the 911 call that typically
signals that a shooting has occurred, in order to try to intervene
in factors such as handgun acquisition and possession.
</P>
<P>
   But he said many communities that have not instituted such
programs also are experiencing declining homicides, including those
that are gun-related.
</P>
<P>
   ``I personally don't know why, and I don't think anybody you
could ask could give you an answer,'' Fingerhut said in an
interview. ``There probably is not a single answer, and that is
fortunate because the trend is not dependent on a single factor.''
</P>
<P>
   In an article describing the statistical study, Fingerhut and
other researchers at the center observed that since downturns
appear in metropolitan as well as non-metropolitan counties, the
responsible factors apparently ``are not unique to a few
localities.''
</P>
<P>
   These unknown causes may have spread to other counties by now
and caused the downward trend to accelerate, they said. Statistics
reflecting 1998 rates will not be available for another two or
three years.
</P>
<P>
   They concluded: ``As we had been unaware that we reached a (low
point) in the mid-1980s or that we had reached a peak in 1993, the
next inflection point is sure to surprise us.''
</P>
<P>
   The studies were based on a government-maintained data base, the
Compressed Mortality File, that is drawn from death certificate
data from every county in the country. The National Center for
Health Statistics is part of the Centers for Disease Control.
</P>
<P>
   The article describing the new trends appears in the current
edition of the Journal of the American Medical Association.

AN EGGPLANT VARIATION THAT MAKES THE MOST OF SUMMER FRESHNESS 
</HEADLINE>
   (This is the seventh of eight columns by Deborah Madison, the
former chef at Greens in San Francisco and the author of
``Vegetarian Cooking for Everyone.'' Her collaborator is Mark
Bittman.)  
 (HLW)  
 By DEBORAH MADISON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ An eggplant gratin _ typically a dish with a layer of
toasted bread crumbs topping softened eggplant _ is a fine enough
thing. But a variation I've always preferred is one devised by
Richard Olney, which features a blanket of custard in place of the
bread crumbs. Now I've developed my own version: layers of roasted
eggplant that sandwich a rustic tomato and pepper confit, all
covered by a saffron-scented custard.
</P>
<P>
   At this time of year, when all of the ingredients are at their
peak, the combination of succulent eggplant, delicate custard and
flavorful confit is just irresistible.
</P>
<P>
   This is a dish that cannot be rushed. The tomatoes, onions and
peppers in the confit need gentle heat to reach their ideal state _
a thick, luscious jam, bound with the sweet juices of the
vegetables. The confit gains a bit of mystery with a touch of
anise, which is also a wonderful counterpoint to the cooked
peppers.
</P>
<P>
   The custard is distinguished by the saffron, which gives it a
deep yellow color and a hint of bitterness. (It's really not
replaceable, but you can omit it entirely if you have none.) You
can use the custard just as a topping, but I make extra so that it
drips down into the eggplant and the vegetables. The very top,
exposed directly to the oven's heat, puffs and browns; the portion
that which seeps into the vegetables remains creamy.
</P>
<P>
   Although off-season eggplant must be salted to reduce its
bitterness, the fresh local varieties available now are quite sweet
and can be cooked right after slicing. Just brush the slices with a
minimum of oil, then bake until they are browned and soft. The
eggplant may look a little dry when it comes out of the oven, but
its spongelike tendencies allow it to soak up plenty of the sauce
and become tender and juicy.
</P>
<P>
   This is a wonderful summer side dish, warm or at room
temperature _ it will remain in perfect condition for a couple of
hours after cooking. It is especially nice served with grilled lamb
chops or tuna steaks. But it looks and tastes so great on its own
that you could easily offer it as a main course. To make it a more
elegant entree, serve it in individual gratin dishes or ramekins,
and reduce the baking time to 20 minutes or so.
</P>
<P>
   EGGPLANT GRATIN WITH CUSTARD
</P>
<P>
   Time: 1{ to 2 hours
</P>
<P>
   About { cup olive oil
</P>
<P>
   3 cups diced onions
</P>
<P>
   Salt
</P>
<P>
   2 large bell peppers, preferably one yellow and one red,
stemmed, seeded and chopped
</P>
<P>
   1 tablespoon minced garlic
</P>
<P>
   { teaspoon anise seeds, crushed with a knife
</P>
<P>
   3 large tomatoes, peeled, seeded, and diced
</P>
<P>
   2 tablespoons tomato paste
</P>
<P>
   Freshly ground pepper, preferably white
</P>
<P>
   3 to 4 pounds eggplant, cut into slices just under {-inch thick
</P>
<P>
   [ to \ teaspoon saffron
</P>
<P>
   1{ cups ricotta
</P>
<P>
   3 eggs
</P>
<P>
   } cup freshly grated Parmesan
</P>
<P>
   1 cup plus 2 tablespoons milk or heavy cream
</P>
<P>
   { cup torn up basil leaves.
</P>
<P>
   1. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Place 3 tablespoons oil in a
large, deep skillet or saucepan and turn heat to medium. Add onions
and a healthy pinch of salt and cook, stirring, until translucent,
10 minutes or longer. Add peppers, garlic, and anise and cook,
stirring occasionally, until peppers are very tender, about 15
minutes. Add tomatoes and tomato paste. Adjust heat so mixture
simmers steadily. Stir occasionally and cook until the mixture is
thick and jammy, about 30 minutes. Taste and add salt and pepper as
needed.
</P>
<P>
   2. Lightly brush each slice of eggplant with olive oil and place
the slices, in one layer, on one or more baking sheets. Bake,
turning after about 20 minutes, until the eggplant is lightly brown
and slightly shriveled, a total of 30 to 40 minutes. Turn the heat
to 375 degrees.
</P>
<P>
   3. Dissolve the saffron in \ cup hot water. Mix together the
ricotta, eggs, Parmesan, milk or cream, and some salt and pepper.
Add saffron and its liquid. Stir basil into the tomato sauce.
</P>
<P>
   4. Brush the inside of a large gratin dish or baking pan with
oil. Make a layer of eggplant, then one of the tomato sauce;
repeat. Top with the custard and bake for about 45 minutes, or
until it is nicely browned. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 main-course or 8 side-dish servings.

PRESERVING AN ANCIENT CUISINE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By AMANDA HESSER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In ``The Food and Life of Oaxaca'' (Macmillan, 1997, $32.50),
Zarela Martinez, the owner of Zarela in New York City, describes in
graceful language the history of this rugged region in southern
Mexico. She tells of a culture that has been shaped and preserved
by an ancient people determined to resist the Spanish and anyone
else who tried to influence them.
</P>
<P>
   The Oaxacans have also protected their cuisine, which is worlds
away from Mexican food as most Americans know it. This is an
ancient style of cooking, with mortar and pestle at the ready.
</P>
<P>
   It is rich and earthy, layered with chilies but not dominated by
them. And though they have absorbed some Old World influences like
cinnamon, cooking fats and a heavy use of meat, the core flavors
remain indigenous ingredients like nuts, seeds, plantains and, of
course, chilies.
</P>
<P>
   The recipes vary from simple dishes like rice with tomatillos to
marathon-length ones like coloradito, a red mole, which requires
shopping at a specialty store and several hours of preparation. But
to make full use of a book like this, which is a thorough
exploration of a cuisine and a way of life, going the long way is
part of the experience.
</P>
<P>
   Besides, the coloradito, at least, was worth every minute. The
smooth red sauce thickened with a brioche-like bread (Ms. Martinez
suggests using hallah), unlike the dark chocolaty sauce often
associated with moles, had great depth: it was sweet upfront from
the tomatoes and buttery from the almonds and had just a touch of
heat, which seemed to blossom with each bite.
</P>
<P>
   And as you learn from Ms. Martinez, in Oaxacan cooking, when a
mole is prepared, the sauce, rather than the meat, is the focal
point of the dish. The meats are often boiled and shredded, or
cubed and stewed, and then covered with the mole.
</P>
<P>
   You also learn, after slaving through all of the steps, that
many Oaxacan cooks no longer make their moles from scratch but buy
ground spice mixes at the market. And that Oaxacans love burned
flavors _ hence dishes like burned ice milk and a dark mole with
dumplings, made with charred tortillas.
</P>
<P>
   The book is filled with such eye-openers, making it good reading
even if you don't have the energy to shop for banana leaves and
achiote seeds or to toast and grind spices.
</P>
<P>
   In this spirit, the recipes are not limited by the American
palate. A spaghetti-squash drink with pineapple and a maguey worm
sauce are there alongside everyday frijoles cocidos, or basic
cooked beans. This kind of authenticity is rare and refreshing in
the world of cookbooks. And yes, Ms. Martinez does provide a good
source list.
</P>
<P>
   Her recipes work beautifully. The ante de almendra, a light,
eggy cake with an almond filling, was moist and rich, the almond
flavor and sweetness perfectly harmonized. Though there was an
ingredient I couldn't find in the chocolateatcle, this delicate
porridge with a chocolate topping (an ancestor of hot chocolate)
was still interesting. And the good thing about getting something
like this from a cookbook rather than a restaurant is that you
don't have to pronounce it.

   4 dried guajillo chilies, tops and seeds removed (see note)
</P>
<P>
   1 2-inch piece canela, or 2 teaspoons ground Ceylon cinnamon
(see note)
</P>
<P>
   5 cloves, or [ teaspoon ground cloves
</P>
<P>
   \ cup lard or vegetable oil
</P>
<P>
   1 small onion, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   3 medium ripe tomatoes, coarsely chopped
</P>
<P>
   One-third medium yellow plantain, peeled and chopped (about 1
cup)
</P>
<P>
   12 sprigs fresh thyme
</P>
<P>
   6 sprigs fresh oregano
</P>
<P>
   3 tablespoons sesame seeds, toasted
</P>
<P>
   \ cup dark raisins
</P>
<P>
   } cup blanched almonds
</P>
<P>
   1{ ounces Mexican chocolate, coarsely grated (see note).
</P>
<P>
   1. Place pork butt, head of garlic, 1 teaspoon black
peppercorns, bay leaves and 1 teaspoon salt in 5-to-6-quart
saucepan. Add enough cold water to cover well (about 12 cups).
Bring to boil over high heat, and immediately reduce heat to low.
Remove any foam that collects on top. Simmer, partly covered, until
meat is tender, about 2 to 2{ hours. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   2. Lift out pork, letting it drain well, and let cool to room
temperature. Meanwhile, boil stock until reduced to about 6 to 8
cups. Strain stock through fine-mesh sieve, discarding solids; let
sit until fat can be skimmed off (or refrigerate for several hours,
and lift off solidified fat). Set aside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   3. Remove any visible fat from pork butt. Pull meat from bones,
carefully tear it into long shreds, and refrigerate if not using at
once. You should have about 3 to 4 cups. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   4. In food processor, crush bread to fine crumbs. You should
have about 1 cup. Set aside. Place ancho and guajillo chilies in a
bowl. Pour boiling water over them to cover, and let soak for 20
minutes. Meanwhile, in a spice or coffee grinder or with a mortar
and pestle, grind together the canela, cloves and remaining 5
peppercorns. Set aside. Drain soaked chilies, and set aside. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   5. In medium skillet, heat half the lard over medium heat until
rippling. Add ground spices, and cook, stirring, for 1 to 2
minutes, or just until fragrant. Add onion, minced garlic,
tomatoes, plantain, thyme, oregano, sesame seeds, raisins and
almonds. Cook on medium-low heat, uncovered, stirring frequently,
for 15 minutes. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   6. Let mixture cool for 10 minutes, and then place half the
mixture in a food processor with 1 cup reserved pork broth and half
of the drained chilies. Process to a smooth puree (for about 3
minutes on high). Repeat with remaining sauce mixture, another cup
of pork broth and remaining chilies. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   7. In large Dutch oven or deep skillet, heat remaining lard over
medium-high heat until rippling. Add pureed mixture, stirring well
to prevent splattering. Stir in remaining stock, a little at a
time. Reduce heat to medium, and cook, covered, stirring
frequently, for 15 to 20 minutes, until chilies lose the raw edge
of their flavor. Stir in bread crumbs, and cook, stirring
frequently, until mixture is lightly thickened, about 10 minutes.
Stir in chocolate, and cook, stirring constantly, until it is well
dissolved. Add remaining salt. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   8. Stir in reserved shredded pork. Partly cover; cook, stirring
occasionally, just until heated through, 7 to 10 minutes. Taste for
seasoning. Serve. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 to 6 servings. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Note: The ingredients that say ``see note'' are available at
Mexican markets.

LEMON ZESTER, FROM CRUEL TO COOL 
</HEADLINE>
   (ART ADV: Photo will be sent to NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers
can make individual purchase by calling 212-556-4204.)  
 (af)

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The lemon zester has a handy, if a bit esoteric, function. When
its head is pressed against the skin of a lemon or other citrus
fruit and dragged along the contours, it strips fine curly strands
of rind.
</P>
<P>
   Lemon zest is filled with essential flavoring oils that infuse
dishes with the fruit's evocative essence. It can be added either
whole or finely chopped to everything from marinades to cake
batter.
</P>
<P>
   A sharp, precise zester _ a straight-handled tool with a flat
metal head rimmed with five holes _ will produce strips about an
inch or two long and a millimeter or so wide. The strips should be
neither so deep that they cut into the pith, which is bitter, nor
so shallow that they merely skim off the top layer of skin.
</P>
<P>
   Most zesters work, but few shine. J.A. Henckels makes various
models, including one that sells for as much as $12 at Zabar's,
2245 Broadway (80th Street); (212) 787-2000. But a less expensive
model, in the company's International Gourmet series, works much
better. The head is angled so that the holes dig into the lemon
skin, producing uniform strands of zest. The zester is sold at
Lechters stores around New York for $5.99.
</P>
<P>
   Econome, a French brand, has a zester that is absolutely cruel
to the hand, with a hard plastic handle that was designed with no
regard for ergonomics. The zester is sharp and effective, but not
without a good amount of elbow grease. It is $8.50 at
Williams-Sonoma stores.
</P>
<P>
   Until Oxo came along, it seems little attention was paid to
comfort. The company, whose kitchen equipment is known for its
black rubber, ergonomically correct handles, has two zester models,
which outshone nine others I tested. They not only worked superbly
but were also comfortable enough that if you had to zest a bucket
of lemons, you could.
</P>
<P>
   Oxo's original model _ sold at the Vinegar Factory, 431 East
91st Street, (212) 987-0885, for $4.99 _ has a fat straight black
rubber handle, with a wide zester head. The stainless steel head is
a little long, giving you less control, but it zests almost
flawlessly.
</P>
<P>
   Oxo hired Smart Design, a Manhattan company, to come up with its
latest zester model, which will be available in September. Tim
Kennedy, the head of the design team, said that the designers
bought as many models as they could find and tested them to see
their faults.
</P>
<P>
   Most zester blades, he found, were too flexible, hampering their
ability to grip the fruit, and the handles were too small and thin
to fit comfortably in the hand for long-term use.
</P>
<P>
   For the new zester, the designers used a high-grade stainless
steel for the head and created a short, rounded handle that rests
snugly in the palm. They placed an indent where the handle meets
the head, so that the index finger can rest there when pressure is
applied to the lemon.
</P>
<P>
   The head is also short, so that the hand is close to the lemon,
giving the user more control. It will cost about $5.99. For orders
or information on retailers: (800) 545-4411.
</P>
<P>
   Many zesters, including the two Oxo zesters, are equipped with a
stripper, which removes a single, wider strip of peel. If you drink
martinis with a twist, you know the dimensions of this strip well.
(It is, in fact, the only good use I know of for the stripper.) It
is about 2 inches long and [ inch wide.
</P>
<P>
   A stripper is either a thin circle, like an eyelet, on the side
of the zester head, or a pointed wedge pressed into the center of
the zester head. Unfortunately, both designs are often positioned
so that only right-handed people can use them; eyelet strippers
generally work with more ease.
</P>
<P>
   There is an alternative to buying a zester: wide flat strips of
peel can be removed with a vegetable peeler and then cut into
thinner strips. But it takes longer and fails to open up as many of
the oily cells as a good-quality zester does.

NOTHING TO IT: ITALIAN SAUGAGE ON A BED OF COOKED GRAPES 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By MARK BITTMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When I saw salsiccia all'uva _ sausages and grapes _ on the menu
in a trattoria in the Tuscan region of Italy a few years ago, I
ordered it simply out of curiosity.
</P>
<P>
   My imagination could not prepare me for the utter simplicity of
the dish: beautifully browned sausages nestled on a bed of cooked
grapes that were in varying stages of doneness. Some of the grapes
were lightly browned, some were collapsed and some were whole and
nearly raw.
</P>
<P>
   Although I was told the dish is Umbrian in origin, it seems as
if many farm workers could have created this, even if by accident,
no matter where they lived.
</P>
<P>
   Now this dish is often overlooked (you might find a recipe in
older cookbooks, but the search would be long and hard), perhaps
because there is almost nothing to it. There is neither the
challenge nor the trendiness of sausages and polenta, for example.
</P>
<P>
   In any case, the wonderful marriage of these two humble
ingredients results in a dish that is incredibly easy to produce
and easily worked into anyone's repertory. With good crusty bread
and a salad, you've got a great weeknight meal in about half an
hour.
</P>
<P>
   There are some fine points to consider, though. You can brown
sausages over raging high heat or more moderately. I recommend
moderation, which significantly reduces spattering. To further
minimize mess, don't prick the sausages to release their fat until
they are mostly cooked; they will brown perfectly, even in a
completely dry skillet.
</P>
<P>
   Before cooking the grapes, you might drain off the excess fat.
These days, however, many sausages are quite lean, and even a pound
releases only a tablespoon of fat during cooking _ about the amount
you need for the grapes. As the grapes cook, they release some of
their liquid, which combines with the fat to form a lovely brown
sauce.
</P>
<P>
   Because standard seedless grapes are somewhat one-dimensional in
flavor and lacking in acidity, this sauce needs a minuscule amount
of balsamic vinegar or lemon juice to balance it.
</P>
<P>
   That's it; even salt and pepper are unnecessary.
</P>
<P>
   SAUSAGES WITH GRAPES &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Time: 30 minutes &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1 to 1{ pounds fresh Italian sausage
</P>
<P>
   4 cups seedless grapes
</P>
<P>
   2 teaspoons balsamic vinegar or lemon juice, or to taste. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   1. Place sausages in a 10- or 12-inch skillet, and turn heat to
medium. Cook sausages, turning from time to time, about 15 minutes.
When they are brown all over, prick each sausage in a few places
with a thin-bladed knife and cook for 5 minutes more.
</P>
<P>
   2. Remove sausages to a warm platter. If more than a tablespoon
or two of fat remains in the pan, remove excess. Add grapes, and
turn heat to medium-high. Cook, stirring occasionally, until some
of the grapes collapse. Add vinegar or lemon juice, stir, and turn
off the heat. Serve sausages nestled in grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Yield: 4 servings.

WIDE RANGE OF ICE CREAM MAKERS AVAILABLE 
</HEADLINE>
   (See also ICE-CREAM)  
 (JT)  
 By AMANDA HESSER    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Ice cream makers are one of the few categories of
kitchen equipment that come in a range as vast as cars do, from the
Hyundai to the Rolls. There's the Donvier Hand-crank Ice Cream
Maker ($50), a small device that will get you to ice cream bliss
eventually. The one-and-a-half quart container must be frozen
overnight and cranked by hand. A step up is the White Mountain Ice
Cream Maker ($199.95), which, though electric, makes ice cream the
old fashioned way with crushed ice and rock salt _ but you do get
more ice cream, about four quarts. And many swear by the
Williams-Sonoma Ice Cream Maker, a heavy machine with a
self-contained refrigeration unit that whips together a smooth
quart and a half in 25 minutes. It costs $429.
</P>
<P>
   And now, for anybody whose ice cream addiction is so severe it
probably requires therapy, there's the Emery Thompson Ice Cream
Maker (CB-2) on the way at $1,499. The Vinegar Factory, 431 East
91st St., New York, N.Y., will be stocking it by the end of August.
</P>
<P>
   Emery Thompson Machinery, a company in the Bronx, has been
making professional ice cream machines for 93 years, and offers
models that cost up to $17,400. This new scaled down model,
designed for obsessive home cooks and small restaurants, makes ice
cream lickety split. By applying the same technology used for
refrigerators, the machine compresses freon to cool the ice cream
container while a separate mechanism turns the blade. Though other
ice cream machines, like the Williams-Sonoma Ice Cream Maker, work
on a similar concept, the Emery Thompson is built with heavy duty
parts that make for an extremely efficient cooling system.
</P>
<P>
   It can whip up two-and-a-half quarts in 12 minutes. A single
quart took just six minutes. The machine, made of heavy duty
stainless steel, doesn't even need time to cool down. You simply
add the ice cream mixture, turn it on and the rotary steel blade
takes it from there, turning it into a light, silky ice cream.
</P>
<P>
   And when not in use, the 70-pound ice cream maker is big enough
to use as a side table.

`HALLOWEEN H20': MONSTER AND VICTIM: OLDER NOT WISER 
</HEADLINE>
   (production notes at end)  
 (JT)  
 By LAWRENCE VAN GELDER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Talk about visiting old haunts.
</P>
<P>
   Because there is nothing like a transfusion of dollars to
resurrect an old maniac, Michael Myers, the hockey-masked slasher
of the 1978 John Carpenter horror hit ``Halloween,'' has been
brought back from the supposed dead to knife his way through the
new ``Halloween: H20.''
</P>
<P>
   The ``H20'' part of the title is not to be mistaken for the
chemical symbol for water. The letter and numbers are just a
shorthand way of signifying that the events of this bloodbath take
place 20 years after those of the original.
</P>
<P>
   For horror film devotees eager to know how this unseasonable
visit from the darker spirits of autumn rates, frankly, it's more
marketing trick than moviegoer treat.
</P>
<P>
   Though most of the action is routine and heavily dependent for
suspenseful atmosphere on dim lights, billowing ghostly white
curtains, rustling leaves and under-illuminated hallways and rooms,
the big gimmick of ``H20'' is the return of Jamie Lee Curtis of
``Halloween'' and ``Halloween II'' (1981) as the prey of the
homicidal Michael Myers.
</P>
<P>
   In the latest outing, directed by Steve Miner, an alumnus of the
``Friday the 13th'' franchise, the former Laurie Strode is living
under a new name, Keri Tate, and employed as the headmistress of
Hillcrest Academy, a gated private high school in Northern
California. She is also the single mother of John (Josh Hartnett),
who, turning 17, is exactly the same age Laurie was when she was
plunged into traumatic horror in 1978.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie has never really recovered. She suffers from nightmares,
drinks heavily and has a bathroom cabinet filled with prescription
pills. John, a student at her school, chafes against her
possessiveness and uneasy fear that her ordeals have not ended.
</P>
<P>
   As events prove, she's right about that.
</P>
<P>
   With the advent of Halloween 1998, most of the school departs on
buses bound for an outing at Yosemite National Park. But unbenownst
to Laurie, John has contrived to stay behind at school. Like mom,
who has arranged to spend the evening with her lover, Will (Adam
Arkin), the school counselor, John has planned a romantic, candelit
evening with his girlfriend, Molly (Michelle Williams of ``Dawson's
Creek''), and their pals, Charlie (Adam Hann Byrd) and Sarah (Jodi
Lyn O'Keefe).
</P>
<P>
   And all the while, Michael Myers has been slashing his way
toward them.
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween H20'' has some fun by positioning Janet Leigh, Ms.
Curtis' mother and the star of the terror classic ``Psycho,'' as
one of the school staff, which gives her an opportunity to begin
one conversation by saying, ``If I could be maternal for a moment''
and going on to observe, ``We've both had bad things happen to
us.''
</P>
<P>
   ``H20,'' written by Robert Zappia and Matt Greenberg, also has
some fun with L.L. Cool J as Ronny, the school's security guard,
who is writing a steamy sex novel while supposedly making sure its
electronic gate keeps the youngsters in and the monsters out.
</P>
<P>
   But the throwaway jokes are few and far between, and after a
pre-title sequence reintroduces Michael and shows just how far up
suspense and thrills can be ratcheted, ``Halloween H20'' declines
into the routine. Nobody is going to be surprised by who lives and
who dies.
</P>
<P>
   The only question is whether the dead will stay that way.
</P>
<P>

NEW YORK GOVERNOR RAISES $3.5 MILLION FROM OUTSIDE STATE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By JOHN CAHER and JAMES M. ODATO  
 c.1998 Albany Times Union  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Gov. George Pataki, touted by some as a potential
candidate for president or vice president in 2000, is raking in
contributions from out-of-state donors, according to government
records.
</P>
<P>
   Since taking office in 1995, Pataki has accepted more than $3.5
million from out-of-state contributors, including major
corporations like Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. and Coca-Cola,
and political figures such as former Massachusetts Gov. William F.
Weld and former federal budget director David A. Stockman.
</P>
<P>
   Of the five candidates for governor _ the other four are
Democrats waging a primary battle _ the Republican incumbent has
garnered 90 percent of the out-of-state contributions, compared
with 60 percent of in-state contributions. Among Pataki's non-New
York benefactors are:
</P>
<P>
   _ Nunzio DeSantis, chairman and chief executive officer of an
Albuquerque, N.M.-based Dianostek Inc., which manages prescription
drug plans, $28,000. He and Joseph Corazzi, also of Albuquerque,
partners in casino holdings in Las Vegas, contributed $42,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki unsuccessfully pushed for legislation that could lead to
casinos in New York.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stuart Subotnick of East Rutherford, N.J., partner in
Metromedia Co., a New York telecommunications, medical technology
and restaurant business, $28,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Metropolitan Life Insurance Co. of Washington, D.C., $25,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ New York Life Insurance Co. of Washington, D.C., $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki pushed for legislation allowing mutually held life
insurers to form holding companies able to issue stock, a proposal
opposed by consumer and senior citizen groups.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jerome V. Ansel, president of St. Andrew's Realty in Boca
Raton, Fla., $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Orin Kramer, investment manager with Kramer, Spellman LP in
Fort Lee, N.J., $20,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Deloitte &AMP; Touche accounting firm of Parsippany, N.J.,
$10,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Weld, of Cambridge, Mass., $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   _ Stockman, of Greenwich, Conn., $10,000.
</P>
<P>
   Campaign finance records show Pataki has raised $3,566,580 in
out-of-state contributions since taking office in 1995, not
including whatever he collected on a campaign swing through
Colorado and California late last week. In comparison, his
potential Democratic opponents _ who have been raising money for a
gubernatorial run for at most several months _ have collected far
less from non-New Yorkers: James Larocca has collected $11,300 from
out-of-state contributors; Charles J. Hynes has raised $22,700;
Betsy McCaughey Ross has raised at least $106,771; and Peter
Vallone has raised $216,520.
</P>
<P>
   Pataki, who is running for his second term, has raised a total
of $16.1 million, nearly 76 percent of that from within New York.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's higher than usual for in-state,'' said Weld, now a
lawyer in Cambridge, Mass., and an occasional New York City
dweller. Weld said he likes a greater balance between in-state and
out-of-state money.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mine was 50-50. I raised as much from New York as I did from
Massachusetts,'' Weld said, suggesting that Pataki push harder in
such lucrative fund-raising venues as Houston; Dallas; West Palm
Beach, Fla.; Los Angeles; and Menlo Park, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   And why would out-of-staters donate significant sums to Pataki?
</P>
<P>
   ``Certainly, Governor Pataki has expressed national
aspirations,'' said Rachel Leon of Common Cause, a citizens'
lobbying group that advocates changes in the way campaigns are
financed.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are a lot of reasons why corporations and individuals
around the country would have an interest in New York state. They
may be contributing to the party, contributing to Pataki to show
support for him. New York is just the center of so many things that
a lot of national money tends to come in.''

   Leon said that as the top elected Republican in such a prominent
state, Pataki is a money magnet for out-of-state dollars.
Similarly, she said, Comptroller H. Carl McCall attracts national
Democratic interest since he is the only member of that party to
currently hold statewide office in New York. In fact, McCall, who
is seeking re-election this year against newcomer Bruce Blakeman of
Long Island, has collected almost $2 million from outside New York,
39 percent of his total of $5 million.
</P>
<P>
   The other statewide officeholder seeking re-election, Republican
Dennis Vacco, seeking another term as attorney general, collected
$346,000 from out of state, 9.2 percent of his total of $3.7
million. Evan Davis, a Democratic candidate for attorney general
who has made campaign finance reform the focal point of his
campaign, cringes at what is happening.
</P>
<P>
   ``If it is an out-of-state corporation or a union or a PAC
(political action committee), I have the same problem that I would
have with an in-state corporation, union or PAC _ namely that they
are using their powerful institutional base to try to dominate the
political process and overwhelm the interests of people who can't
compete financially,'' Davis said.
</P>
<P>
   However, Davis said he does not object to individual
out-of-state contributions as long as the amount given is
reasonably limited. ``If you do that, it seems to me that it
doesn't matter if the friend comes from New York or Idaho,'' he
said.

VANCOUVER: WHERE THE FAR EAST NOW BEGINS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MARIAN BURROS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   VANCOUVER, British Columbia _ The waiter leaned down, presenting
a basket in which several wiggling spotted prawns, just fetched
from the fish tank, were awaiting our pleasure. Did we want them
cooked quickly in wine and oil? In a good Chinese restaurant, it is
always best to take the waiter's hints.
</P>
<P>
   The preparation was tableside, and the prawns continued to flip
around until they were added to the pot. The air was perfumed with
the aroma of rosewater, the prawns unbelievably tender and sweet.
</P>
<P>
   The best Chinese restaurants in Vancouver, like Sun Sui Wah in
the up-and-coming Mount Pleasant neighborhood, know what their
patrons _ mostly wealthy Chinese emigres from Hong Kong _ expect.
</P>
<P>
   An enormous immigration from Hong Kong over the past decade has
made Vancouver one of the most Asian cities in North America _ and,
many would say, the best city in the world, outside of Hong Kong,
to eat Chinese food. An estimated 110,000 Hong Kong Chinese have
flowed into this city of 525,000 since the early 1980s in
anticipation of the Chinese takeover. And many arrived with the
wherewithal to indulge their connoisseurship of the fine points of
Chinese cuisine: the Canadian government made citizenship easy to
obtain for those who could show several hundred thousand dollars in
assets. Not for nothing has the city earned the nickname
Hongcouver.
</P>
<P>
   Chefs from Hong Kong's best restaurants soon followed these
emigres, bringing with them a level of sophistication that is
seldom seen outside that city. So, for example, when Marco Wong,
who heads a shipping company in Manhattan, wants the very best
Chinese food in North America, he knows to look for it in
Vancouver, where his brother, Stephen Wong, is a food consultant
and cookbook author.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's like the difference between going to a very good bistro
and going to Alain Ducasse,'' said Marco Wong, referring to
France's only six-star chef. ``Nowhere else comes close.'' If some
of the Chinese food I ate during my five-day stay were French, it
would be called haute cuisine.
</P>
<P>
   The Hong Kong connection is evident to the visitor the moment
Vancouver comes into view: a city on the water with new, tall, slim
towers sprouting like mushrooms, many of them built with Hong Kong
money. One hears grumbling from old-timers about the new ``monster
houses'' built by wealthy newcomers where modest bungalows once
stood. And about the new need for classes in English as a second
language in the schools. But there is no grumbling about the new
culinary influences on the Vancouver scene.
</P>
<P>
   Here is where I discovered that contrary to popular belief, the
Chinese can make pastries as fine and flaky as the most expert
French baker, that soy sauce comes in 60 varieties at least and
that the latest fad among young Chinese, bubble pearl tea, is one
that ought to sweep America.
</P>
<P>
   The chefs' demand for the ingredients so readily available to
them in Hong Kong has brought those ingredients not just to
Vancouver, but also to places like Richmond, a city south of
Vancouver proper whose population is now 40 percent Chinese.
</P>
<P>
   It was at the modern sprawling T &AMP; T Supermarket in Richmond
that I found those 60 kinds of soy sauce on the shelves. As well as
bean curd in at least two dozen different forms, ranging from one
labeled ``smelly'' to one shaped like a chicken and made for
vegetarians. There are black chickens, duck tongue, geese
intestines, taro root ice cream, too. Looking almost exotic in this
setting were North American staples like Sara Lee strawberry
cheesecake, maple syrup and Ritz crackers.
</P>
<P>
   In Richmond you find fish tanks in the supermarkets. One tank
after another is filled with live sea creatures that are the
foundation of much Hong Kong cooking. T &AMP; T has a sign in English
above the crabs:
</P>
<P>
   WARNING LIVE CRABS DO BITE
</P>
<P>
   Live is the operative word. The freshness of seafood is key for
Cantonese food because the recipes are quite simple, designed to
show off the quality of the ingredients.
</P>
<P>
   Even the fast food in the food courts of the Richmond shopping
malls (where it is possible to go an entire day without hearing a
word of English spoken) is intriguing. The stalls are similar to
those in Asian cities, and they offer an amazing display of quick,
cheap, mouthwatering dishes.
</P>
<P>
   In the Yaohan Center, Pak Tak Chiu Chow serves dishes like
savory duck cooked with five-spice powder and soy accompanied by a
dip of garlic and rice vinegar. The Curry House has a subtly hot
lamb curry served with a delicious rice cooked in chicken broth
with chicken fat, garlic and ginger.
</P>
<P>
   But one of the most intriguing concoctions is the bubble pearl
tea, imported from Taiwan, that is the latest fad among young
Chinese. It is a fad I would happily embrace: Sweetened iced tea
frothed with milk and ice, sometimes idiosyncratically flavored
with anything from lychees to Ovaltine. What makes it so appealing
are the gelatinous pearls made of potato flour placed in the bottom
of the glass that are sipped through an extra-wide straw. The
pearls sort of rumble as you slurp them up. (Sadly, these giant
Taiwanese pearls do not seem to have reached the East Coast yet.)
Vancouver has no less than 30 establishments that specialize in
these drinks.
</P>
<P>
   Given the inventiveness of Chinese chefs, it's not surprising to
find refreshing fusion dishes here as well. Chinese restaurant
menus turn up such surprises as pan-fired ostrich dumplings and
Japanese udon noodles and teriyaki sauce; such oddities as lobster
with cream and butter sauce, an import from Hong Kong via France;
pomfret with Miracle Whip and a favorite dim sum dessert, a crisp
spring roll filled with canned fruit salad and mayonnaise.
</P>
<P>
   Only in a place sure of its Chinese roots would a chef dare to
create these fusion dishes, even if they don't all work. The fusion
goes both ways. ``We use a lot of Chinese ingredients,'' said
Adrienne O'Callaghan, the chef at a downtown restaurant with the
resoundingly un-Chinese name of Irish Heather. ``We don't think of
them as Chinese. We think of them as mainstream: Chinese
vegetables, rice vinegar, sesame oil, all kinds of noodles, shrimp
paste. You don't bat an eyelash anymore.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Vancouver has had a Chinese presence since the 1850s, decades
before the city's incorporation. It's just that the Chinese profile
has risen so sharply, so fast.
</P>
<P>
   ``Chinese food and Chinese people were always around,'' said
Murray McMillen, the food editor of The Vancouver Sun, ``but I
didn't feel the culinary influence when I was growing up.'' The
culinary impact of the large Chinese population in the city has
become so pervasive people here treat Chinese ingredients the way
people in Houston treat salsa.
</P>
<P>
   Raazhan Rae, a schoolteacher, used to shop in Chinatown, but now
she can find what she needs in her own neighborhood, where most of
the residents are westerners. ``The vegetable department where I
shop probably has one-third Oriental vegetables,'' she said, ``and
it has fish tanks.''
</P>
<P>
   For Kasey Wilson, the author of several guidebooks and the
co-host of a radio food show, has noticed the difference among her
circle of friends. ``Westerners buy a lot of prepared dim sum,
steam them in little Chinese steamer baskets they have at home and
serve them as appetizers. The fact that you can just pick up a
Peking duck and serve it with lingonberry sauce, that barbecued
duck is used to top pizzas, that chefs are buying them for their
restaurants and cutting them in strips for appetizers ... .''
</P>
<P>
   Those in the know, Chinese or not, who are looking for the best
and cheapest fish, shop in Chinatown. Sylvia Molnar, a cooking
teacher, goes there at least once a week to buy live fish,
especially sturgeon and carp.
</P>
<P>
   Visitors to Vancouver are most likely to encounter its Chinese
specialties in the restaurants. Sun Sui Wah is renowned for its
squab and its live fish. The restaurant's weekend dim sum are just
as sophisticated as its dinner fare. For Westerners who want to dip
no more than a toe into shark's fin dishes, shark's fin dumplings
are the route. The glutinous sharks' fin makes a pleasing contrast
to the shrimp and ham in the filling, all encased in a very tender
dough. The savvy diner saves room for fresh-from-the-oven egg tarts
and the best sponge cake on the planet.
</P>
<P>
   The Shanghai Bistro in downtown Vancouver also puts on an
impressive dim sum banquet at lunch every day, and a standout is
the silky handmade noodles with spicy eggplant, all cooked to sweet
perfection. This is also the place for steamed buns filled with
pork and cilantro, perfectly cooked so that the buns do not taste,
as they often do, like uncooked dough. Shanghai scallion pancakes
are toasty brown on the outside and soft inside.
</P>
<P>
   The best winter melon soup I had in Vancouver was at the Grand
King Seafood Restaurant, improbably in a Holiday Inn. (Don't let
the locations of Chinese restaurants put you off.)
</P>
<P>
   In Richmond, the President Chinese Seafood Restaurant, in the
Radisson Hotel (which also houses a Buddhist temple), does a superb
suckling pig and a refined shark's fin soup with a rich, clear
broth. The deep-fried Alaskan king crab announced its arrival by
sending waves of fragrant garlic to the table, and what the Chinese
call hollow vegetable but others call water spinach, is superb with
ginger, garlic, hot pepper and preserved bean curd.
</P>
<P>
   If you want to try the ovaries of the snow frog, guaranteed to
make you beautiful, improve your complexion and clean your system,
says Melina Hung, communications director of the Radisson, have
them in the pudding. You'll never know they are there.
</P>
<P>
   Alas, some of the very best of these restaurants see few
westerners. ``I've had a hard time convincing Caucasians to come to
these restaurants,'' said Stephen Wong, the cookbook author. ``They
won't spend money on pea shoots,'' a reference to one of the
cuisine's most popular vegetables.
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, these top restaurateurs have not gone out of
their way to welcome Westerners. But now that some of those wealthy
Hong Kong Chinese are returning home, the restaurants may find they
have to step up their outreach programs.

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ROMANECHE-THORIN, France _ In Georges Duboeuf's Beaujolais
museum here there is a fading pre-World War I photo of mustachioed
workers posing at a local manganese mine with their picks and
shovels.
</P>
<P>
   The mine and those miners are long gone, but the manganese
remains in the soil, extracted these days almost exclusively by
grape vines. It is the mineral that gives long life to the most
important local wine, Moulin-a-Vent, the king of Beaujolais.
</P>
<P>
   I took the high-speed train from Paris down to Beaujolais to
take Duboeuf up on his claim that, despite what the books say, not
all Beaujolais is meant to be drunk young and that, in fact, some
Beaujolais wines can have long, distinguished lives. Especially
Moulin-a-Vent.
</P>
<P>
   Can there be any wine drinkers still unfamiliar with Beaujolais?
It's one of the world's most popular wines. Some 15 million cases
of it are produced every year, almost all it consumed by the time
the next vintage rolls around.
</P>
<P>
   Most of this river of wine is simple Beaujolais or the slightly
fuller Beaujolais Villages, fresh, fruity wines, definitely meant
to be drunk young. In some years, as much as half of all simple
Beaujolais may be sold as Beaujolais nouveau, bottled less than
three months after the grapes are picked.
</P>
<P>
   About 25 percent of each vintage consists of 10 ``cru'' wines,
which carry the names of the towns or areas from which they come.
These are the finest Beaujolais; richer in flavor, higher in
alcohol, and longer lasting. They are: Brouilly, Cotes de Brouilly,
Chenas, Chiroubles, Fleurie, Julienas, Morgon, Regnie, St. Amour
and Moulin-a-Vent.
</P>
<P>
   Duboeuf picked me up at the Macon-Loches TGV station, and we
zipped over back roads to the picture-book little village of
Chenas. There at a restaurant called Les Platanes de Chenas _ The
Plane Trees of Chenas _ he had arranged a tasting of some
Moulin-a-Vents going back more than half a century.
</P>
<P>
   It would seem reasonable to have had the tasting somewhere in
Moulin-a-Vent but there is no town of Moulin-a-Vent. The special
soils that produce Moulin-a-Vent are found in both Chenas and
Romaneche-Thorins. The wine takes its name from a 15th century
windmill that is still standing.
</P>
<P>
   At the turn of the century, the villagers of Romaneche-Thorins
and those of Chenas, fought constantly, each accusing the other of
mislabeling their wines. In 1924, the courts finally fixed the
limits of Moulin-a-Vent, spanning both towns.
</P>
<P>
   The wine of Moulin-a-Vent has little in common with the wines of
the more southerly Beaujolais communes, even though it is made from
the same grape, the gamay. This is because of the rich soil, to
different vinification techniques and, in some instances, to barrel
aging.
</P>
<P>
   Most Beaujolais is made by a technique called carbonic
maceration. The hand-picked grapes are not crushed, but are placed
in vats. Grapes at the bottom burst because of the weight. That
juice begins to ferment, warming the vat and causing fermentation
inside the unbroken grapes.
</P>
<P>
   Eventually all the grapes break open and the skins float to the
top. They are pumped over several times a day except in
Moulin-a-Vent where racks hold them under the surface of the new
wine. This slows down the fermentation, extracting even more
flavor, color and tannins. The result is a wine ready for barrel
aging and a long life thereafter.
</P>
<P>
   At Les Platanes, at a table set out under the great plane trees,
we began to work through a series of Moulin-a-Vents. Starting with
a 1997, hardly ready to drink, we tasted back through wines from
1995, 1990, 1985, 1975, 1973, 1947 and 1945.
</P>
<P>
   The wines were Duboeufs except for the two or three oldest. They
were from a Duboeuf competitor, the Chateau Des Jacques, a
Moulin-a-Vent producer in Romaneche-Thorins. It was recently
purchased by Maison Louis Jadot, a Burgundy firm seeking a foothold
in Beaujolais.
</P>
<P>
   I have warmly praised several of the first Des Jacques
Moulin-a-Vents released under the Jadot label.
</P>
<P>
   Accepted wisdom holds that as Beaujolais gets older it begins to
resemble Burgundy. Discussing Moulin-a-Vent a few years ago, the
English wine expert Clive Coates wrote: ``this is absolute
rubbish.'' Duboeuf disagrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tasted by itself, an old Beaujolais, especially one aged in
wood, could appear to be Burgundy,'' he said. But he added that if
an aged Beaujolais and a Burgundy were placed side by side and
tasted, an experienced wine aficionado would be able to discern the
difference.
</P>
<P>
   Duboeuf, 65, has been making Beaujolais for most of his life.
Drawing on some 400 growers and 13 cooperatives, he annually
produces about 10 percent of all Beaujolais, including about six
different Moulin-a-Vents, several of which are all or partially
aged in oak barrels. Just like Burgundy.
</P>
<P>
   As our tasting showed, good old Beaujolais can be very good
indeed. The 1985 was still young, and the wines from the 1970s were
at the peak of their maturity. The wines from the 1940s
(50-year-old Beaujolais!) were undoubtedly old but they had fruit,
good acid, richness and a lovely bouquet. They still displayed the
uncomplicated charm of fine Beaujolais, faded but unmistakable.
</P>
<P>
   I would have given the 1945 a few points over the 1947 had
anyone asked me. No one did. Who quibbles when such rare and
memorable wines are to be savored on a shady country terrace on a
summer day?

`LOLITA' DEFYING EXPECTATIONS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BERNARD WEINRAUB   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLLYWOOD _ Movie studios rejected the director Adrian Lyne's
adaptation of the 1954 Vladimir Nabokov classic, ``Lolita,''
because the film was too expensive, it had little star power and
its potentially offensive sex-with-a-child subject matter made the
two-hour-and-17-minute film commercially risky.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, executives and producers who had seen the film in
Hollywood found it flawed and heavy going.
</P>
<P>
   But in the last few days critics around the nation, with some
notable exceptions, have essentially told the studios that they
were wrong and that the movie is a serious, even first-class
effort. The film, about a man's obsession with a 12-year-old girl,
was shown on the premium cable network Showtime on Sunday, with
three additional broadcasts scheduled through August.
</P>
<P>
   It is to be released by the Samuel Goldwyn Co., an independent
distributor, on Sept. 25 in New York and Los Angeles, then released
around the nation. To qualify for Academy Award consideration, the
film, which cost about $58 million, recently played to large crowds
for one week at a small art house theater in Los Angeles before the
television showing.
</P>
<P>
   The critical response is the latest turn in one of the oddest
journeys yet by a high-profile film made by one of Hollywood's more
successful directors. The movie languished for more than a year.
Its distributors decided on a relatively limited release in Europe,
partly because of the pedophilia scandals in Belgium last year. At
the same time distributors in the United States, worried about the
subject matter, turned down ``Lolita'' until Showtime, seeking to
raise the profile of its programming, picked up the film. This
cable network then cut a deal with the Goldwyn company for the
film's release in theaters.
</P>
<P>
   ``On balance, we're absolutely delighted by the overall positive
critical consensus,'' Jeff Lipsky, Goldwyn's marketing and
distribution chief, said of the early critical response to the
film. ``There are, as in most cases, a couple of naysayers. And who
knows, maybe that will work in the film's favor too.'' He pointed
out that The Los Angeles Times was one of the few large newspapers
to give the film a poor review.
</P>
<P>
   Generally the newspaper and magazine reviews were far better
than studio executives expected. Adapted by Stephen Schiff, the
movie stars Jeremy Irons as Humbert Humbert, a middle-aged college
professor who falls in love with a young girl, Lolita, played by
Dominique Swain. Also in the cast are Melanie Griffith as Lolita's
mother and Humbert's landlady, and Frank Langella as Clare Quilty,
who also pursues Lolita.
</P>
<P>
   Most reviewers said the adaptation was far closer to the Nabokov
novel than Stanley Kubrick's 1962 ``Lolita,'' which starred James
Mason and Sue Lyon and was a commercial success. Ed Bark,
television critic of The Dallas Morning News, called it ``a
provocative, compelling `Lolita' that serves the book well without
explicitly depicting its sexual encounters.''
</P>
<P>
   Caryn James, television critic for The New York Times, called it
an ``entrancing, heartbreaking film'' that is both ``a tragic
morality tale and a poignant character study.'' Ms. James said: ``
Lyne's film echoes Nabokov's transforming vision: it turns
Humbert's madness into art.''
</P>
<P>
   And Robert Blanco of USA Today gave it three stars out of four
and wrote, ``Beautifully composed and performed, and far sadder
than it is sexy, Lyne's `Lolita' dampens desire with a sometimes
stifling sense of melancholy.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, a number of critics assailed the film. Tom
Shales, in The Washington Post, said bluntly: ``If you don't have
Showtime, don't eat your heart out. Don't even nibble. The film is
far inferior to the 1962 version and for the most part a sodden,
gloomy ordeal. All those studios that were allegedly too scared to
release it may just have been too smart.''
</P>
<P>
   Kenneth Turan, in The Los Angeles Times, called the movie
sincere, well-meaning but ineffectual. ``This is not the case of a
brilliant film sandbagged by the nattering nabobs of negativity,
but rather a rarefied, arty, distinctly noncommercial work,'' Turan
wrote.
</P>
<P>
   Lyne, the British-born director of such successes as
``Flashdance,'' ``Fatal Attraction'' and ``Indecent Proposal,'' has
said in recent weeks that Hollywood was simply too timid to deal
with the taboo subject of pedophilia. He said that studios were
hypocritical in rejecting ``Lolita'' because of its subject matter
while eagerly releasing excessively violent movies involving murder
and rape.
</P>
<P>
   Several studio executives said privately, however, that the high
cost of the movie and its subject matter made it too risky a
financial investment. Showtime, a subsidiary of Viacom, bought the
domestic rights to the film at essentially fire-sale prices.
</P>
<P>
   Several critics suggested that the affair was overblown. ``Guess
what?'' wrote Bob Graham in The San Francisco Chronicle. ``
`Lolita' is only a movie, and not a bad one at that.''

&HT;        LAMM CAMPAIGN COFFERS DWINDLING; CAMPBELL HAS MORE THAN $1
MILLION WARCHEST ADVANTAGE
</HEADLINE>
 &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 4 -- Dottie Lamm, who many expect will win next
week's Democratic primary, may have an uphill battle if she gets to
challenge Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell in November.
</P>
<P>
   Lamm's campaign coffers have dwindled -- perhaps dipping below
$100,000 -- compared to nearly $1.3 million in Campbell's warchest,
according to the latest campaign finance reports filed with the
Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming she wins (the primary), she starts out behind,'' said
Jennifer Duffy, who tracks Senate races for the Washington-based
Cook Political Report.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-primary reports, which cover the period from July 1 to
July 22, show that Lamm raised $52,572 over the three weeks and
spent $141,648, leaving her campaign with $234,117 to spend on the
election.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the former columnist and wife of former-Gov. Dick
Lamm spent about $150,000 purchasing advertising time on
television, according to Lamm spokesman Omar Jabara. That would put
her warchest under the $100,000 level with three months to go
before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, on the other hand, raised $128,469 -- more than $6,000
a day over the three-week period -- and spent $159,141. This leaves
the incumbent with $1.26 million in hand for the election.
</P>
<P>
   Their primary challengers didn't fare nearly as well. Democratic
State Rep. Gil Romero of Pueblo's campaign is $2,441 in the red
after raising $14,351 and spending $20,097. Republican Bill Eggert
raised $15,609 and spent $13,026, leaving him with $11,517 in the
bank -- more than offset by $53,950 in campaign debt the Denver
attorney has accrued.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lamm campaign is happy with their fundraising so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on track,'' said Jabara, who refers to Campbell as ``the
most vulnerable senator in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone expects anyone to have as much cash on
hand as a sitting incumbent who has had five-and-a-half years to
raise money,'' said Jabara.
</P>
<P>
   Jabara said the campaign expects to see a fundraising boom after
the primary. ``Because of the primary, a lot of groups and whatnot
are holding out, because they don't want to pick sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy called Lamm's strategy of early campaign spending ``a
gamble,'' but said it may be necessary. Lamm has spent $569,119 so
far this year, compared to $490,711 spent by Campbell, and
well-under $100,000 each for their two challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``She sort of has to play the risk,'' said Duffy. ``The risk is
you spend all that money and get nothing. The payoff is eating
Romero by a sizeable margin and gaining momentum for the general
(election).''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy said that the strategy has proven successful in ``a couple
other states,'' most notably in Ohio, where Democrat Mary Boyle
spent most of her money before the May 5 primary, but got such a
lift after her win, she raised about $450,000 in the following six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the expression 'You've got to spend it to get it?'
That might apply to Dottie Lamm,'' said Duffy.
</P>
<P>
   Lamm's latest spending has gone to a yet-to-be-aired TV
commercial that begins with a picture of a Harley Davidson
motorcycle -- Campbell's famous mode of transportation -- with a
``for sale'' sign on it, said Jabara. The commercial will announce
that ``Colorado needs a new set of wheels'' before showing Lamm
riding away on a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is indicative of Lamm's strategy since announcing
her campaign in October, which has been to look past the primary
and concentrate on Campbell. That strategy may have contributed to
her loss to Romero in the Democratic state assembly in May. But
Lamm supporters hope it will pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all working toward Campbell,'' said Jabara. ``Our
strategy from the beginning is to work towards the general
(election).'' Campbell spokesman Stuart Roy said Lamm's strategy
made her unnecessarily vulnerable to Romero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be a little worried if I were her,'' said Roy. ``Clearly
they gave Romero a chance to catch up, which they never should.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy, who said Campbell expects to exceed the $2.2 million Sen.
Wayne Allard spent in 1996, called Lamm's fundraising ``fairly
weak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume she'll pick up some money (after the primary) --
she's gotta do better than she did,'' said Roy. ``But there's two
sides to fund raising. One is raising it, the other is keeping
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has been airing a commercial of his own, which tells
his life history highlighting his path from an orphanage to the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Duffy expects the campaign spending to be relatively
low during the race -- something she attributes to the $2 million
spending cap on the gubernatorial race. Cambell's fundraising, she
said, is dwarfed by that of many incumbent senators.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell has nearly as much cash on hand now as he spent in
the entire 1992 race. In that race, Campbell -- then a Democrat --
spent $1.6 million to beat Republican Terry Considine.
</P>
<P>
   That may provide some solace to Campbell, but it may be good
news for Lamm as well, since in that election, Considine spent
$650,000 -- about 42 percent -- more than Campbell did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats almost never outraise Republicans, but still manage
to win elections,'' said Jabara. ``We don't need to match him
dollar-for-dollar to beat him.''

<P>
   Drew Carey does a belly dance and pretends to speak Farsi. Ryan
Stiles pretends to be a foal, acting out his birth by putting his
head between another comedian's legs. One comedian (it's hard to
tell which) puts on a crocodile head and announces, ``I'll be the
best date you ever had, and that's no croc.'' Crock. Whatever.
</P>
<P>
   It's amazing what Americans can do to a smart, funny British
television series. Take ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?,'' which has its
premiere on ABC on Wednesday night at 9:30. The British version,
seen in reruns on Comedy Central until recently, was clever, fast
and decidedly verbal.
</P>
<P>
   Now, in its American incarnation, ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?''
is about slapstick and funny hats. When the comedians do speak,
it's often in smirky adolescent remarks about sex. Ostensibly, the
comedians earn points for superior improvs, but the only prize
seems to be the honor of doing a sketch with Carey at the end of
the half-hour.
</P>
<P>
   Luckily, Carey, the host (and star of ABC's sitcom ``The Drew
Carey Show''), could charm the leaves off the trees. At the outset,
he cheerfully describes the new series as ``the show where
everything is made up and the points don't matter,'' and adds, ``I
just pick the guy I like the best and he wins.'' (That's another
thing. On the British show, there was at least one woman, which
really added to the number of improvisational situations a cast
could handle without cross-dressing.)
</P>
<P>
   Stiles, Colin Mochrie, Wayne Brady and Greg Proops make up the
cast of the premiere. They're all personable, but the show is so
physical _ from an ambulance-driver sketch with only sound effects
to a party sketch featuring a slow-motion fight and an
accident-prone circus performer _ that it is hard to tell what they
could do with words. On the rare occasions when someone does
improvise a funny line, it's a relief.
</P>
<P>
   The studio audience, apparently an undemanding group, applauds
enthusiastically, even for a sketch about a compilation of ``songs
of accounting,'' which falls flat. Others can hope only that in the
future the cast will talk more, sing less and leave the silly props
in the dressing room.

`THE WARREN COURT AND THE PURSUIT OF JUSTICE': A MIRACLE VERY MUCH
OF ITS TIME 
</HEADLINE>
   (editors: publication notes at end of review)  
 (bl)  
 By LINDA GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Supreme Court under Chief Justice Earl Warren left a legacy
that is still so visible, still such an ever renewable source of
debate and inspiration, that it is something of a shock to realize
that a generation has grown to adulthood since his retirement 29
years ago closed the door on the remarkable era that bears his
name.
</P>
<P>
   That generation is the principal intended audience for this
elegant extended essay, the outgrowth of an undergraduate history
course on the Warren Court the author teaches at Harvard. Morton J.
Horwitz, a well-known legal historian and Harvard law professor, is
an unapologetic liberal for whom the Warren Court era remains ``a
time when American idealism showed its most generous and hopeful
face.''
</P>
<P>
   Starting from that premise, his effort is not only to tell what
happened during an exceptionally fruitful 16-year period, but to
infuse those events with meaning for readers who come to them with
neither basic facts nor historical context readily at hand.
</P>
<P>
   The effort succeeds to a notable degree, especially given a text
that is barely over 100 pages and that, because it assumes little
prior knowledge of the civil rights movement or the McCarthy
period, must spend valuable pages on basic historical narrative.
</P>
<P>
   The book's small size required a number of editorial choices,
consistent both with the author's vision of the material and his
manifest desire to anchor it within the framework of political
theory. Asked to write a 100-page book about the Warren Court,
someone with a different ideological perspective or editorial goal
would no doubt make other choices.
</P>
<P>
   Any book on the Warren Court, of course, would be highly likely
to begin as this one does, with Brown vs. Board of Education
(1954), decided during Warren's first term. Horwitz calls Brown not
only ``the defining act of Warren Court constitutional
jurisprudence'' but also ``perhaps the most important judgment ever
handed down by an American Supreme Court.''
</P>
<P>
   He devotes little space to recounting Warren's successful
effort, extensively documented elsewhere, to achieve unanimity for
the conclusion that segregated schools violated the 14th
Amendment's guarantee of equal protection. Rather, Horwitz offers a
series of illuminating observations about the Brown decision, from
its roots in a postwar climate of political and social change to
the essential ambiguity of the court's constitutional analysis.
</P>
<P>
   Had Plessy vs. Ferguson, the court's 1896 endorsement of
``separate but equal'' that the Brown decision repudiated, simply
been wrong the minute it was decided, or did it become wrong over
time as conditions changed and constitutional understanding
evolved? Both readings of Brown are possible, and both views _ the
Constitution as fixed for all time, and a ``living Constitution''
that evolves to fit the times _ coexisted, often uneasily, within
the Warren Court majority.
</P>
<P>
   As between the leading exponents of these mutually exclusive
views _ Justice Hugo Black for the fixed meaning and Justice
William Brennan for the evolutionary _ Horwitz strongly prefers
Brennan, ``the most important intellectual influence on the Warren
Court'' as well as ``one of the greatest justices in the nation's
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Black's ``rigid originalism and textualism,'' by contrast,
``reduced every complex interpretative argument to a
one-dimensional test.'' By the end of the 1960s, Black, beset by
fears of growing civil unrest, could no longer be counted on as a
member of the liberal majority, while his brethren fully embraced
the ``living Constitution'' he deplored.
</P>
<P>
   Horwitz's account implicitly raises, but does not answer, the
question of whether the Warren Court was really the Brennan Court;
the chief JUstice is not a very vivid presence in these pages,
while Justice Brennan's important contributions to constitutional
doctrine, particularly the First Amendment, are documented in
detail and explained with clarity.
</P>
<P>
   Brief as the book is, it tackles a number of subtle and complex
issues. Particularly interesting, and relevant to today's debates,
is Horwitz's account of the struggle over the concept of judicial
review. Liberals brought deep suspicion to this exercise of
judicial power, which earlier courts had used as a tool to strike
down progressive legislation in the name of property rights.
</P>
<P>
   In Horwitz's account, the Warren Court's eventual embrace of
judicial intervention to protect the politically dispossessed was
central to its achievement in recognizing a ``democratic culture''
in which minority rights exist not in tension with democratic
theory but integral to it.
</P>
<P>
   Although Earl Warren's tenure spanned the years 1953 to 1969, he
had a working majority for less than half that time _ briefly after
1962, when Arthur Goldberg replaced Felix Frankfurter just as Black
began his retreat, and not solidly until 1967, when Thurgood
Marshall joined the court. The Brown decision's unanimity was the
exception, not the rule, and the shifting and fragile nature of the
liberal majority raises another question: did the Warren Court
embody some basic truth about the country, the culmination of a
historic democratizing impulse, or was it a fortuity, an
interesting aberration?
</P>
<P>
   Horwitz offers evidence for both conclusions, but his heart is
clearly with the former. When he writes in conclusion that ``the
Warren Court liberals understood that it was impossible not to
incorporate one's deepest values into constitutional
interpretation,'' the author is also speaking convincingly for
himself.

A BLACK FILM FESTIVAL FINDS ITS GROOVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By KATHRYN SHATTUCK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Three years ago, as a vice president for marketing at
Miramax and one of the few black executives working in the film
industry, Stacy Spikes fielded the same question repeatedly from
black filmmakers who were often unable to find distributors: ``What
do I do with my film?''
</P>
<P>
   Their prospects were not much better at film festivals than they
were in Hollywood. ``I went to places like Sundance,'' Spikes said,
``and I could see that there were very few black people there.''
</P>
<P>
   So he did something to ease his frustration, to help him sleep
better at night: he created the Urbanworld International Film
Festival, a competitive arena for filmmakers committed to
``expanding and redefining the role of black film in contemporary
world culture.''
</P>
<P>
   What was conceived as a few screenings in a rented space with
folding metal chairs for 150 people _ ``a little thing,'' as Spikes
put it _ suddenly became a very big thing indeed.
</P>
<P>
   As the festival's first opening approached last August, Spikes,
by then an executive at October Films, found himself with a lineup
of 33 films, including Bill Duke's ``Hoodlum'' and George Tillman
Jr.'s ``Soul Food,'' and a fourfold increase in registration.
</P>
<P>
   He hurriedly booked a theater that would hold 500 people and
took a leap of faith: ``I said `Here we go' and left my job. The
festival was growing too fast.''
</P>
<P>
   Now in its second year, Urbanworld is the largest competitive
black film festival in the United States. With more than 70 films
in 5 days _ more than double its presentation last year _ eight
panel discussions on the problems faced by minority filmmakers, a
screenwriters' competition and a selection of Latin films, the
event offers a forum for a segment of the film industry whose voice
remains largely unheard.
</P>
<P>
   The festival, which begins Wednesday night and runs through
Sunday at the New York Hilton and Towers and the Cineplex Odeon
Worldwide Plaza Cinemas in midtown Manhattan, presents the work of
established and emerging black filmmakers through screenings of
commercial films and a competition of independent features.
</P>
<P>
   ``Down in the Delta,'' the directorial debut of the poet Maya
Angelou, holds the coveted opening-night spot. Starring Alfre
Woodard, Loretta Devine, Al Freeman Jr., Esther Rolle and Wesley
Snipes, the movie follows a troubled woman's triumph over adversity
as she leaves urban Chicago and moves her family back to their
ancestral home in the Mississippi Delta. The film is scheduled to
open on Christmas.
</P>
<P>
   For Ms. Angelou, who initially directed the film for Showtime,
only to have it bought by Miramax after it received positive
ratings in previews, ``it was a blessing, a bit of luck,
serendipity'' to be included in the festival. ``I think it's
wonderful, the idea of a lot of people coming together to bring
their best to offer to the community,'' Ms. Angelou said.
</P>
<P>
   The festival closes with ``Why Do Fools Fall in Love,'' about
three women, each claiming to be the legal widow of the 1960s
singer and songwriter Frankie Lymon. Directed by Gregory Nava, the
force behind ``Selena'' and ``My Family: Mi Familia,'' the film
stars Halle Berry, Vivica A. Fox, Lela Rochan and Larenz Tate, and
is schedule for release by Warner Brothers on Sept. 11.
</P>
<P>
   Nava, who will also be on a panel discussion of Latino films,
said the festival ``celebrates something that needs to be
celebrated.'' There was a need, he added, for ``an event that
focuses exclusively on what we're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I believe very strongly in bringing down walls between
different groups,'' Nava said. ``But if you look at the analogy of
the Sundance Festival created as an alternative to the Cannes
Festival for independents, then you understand why Urbanworld
needed to be created.''
</P>
<P>
   Other commercial films on the roster include Kevin Sullivan's
``How Stella Got Her Groove Back,'' in its New York premiere, with
Angela Bassett and Whoopi Goldberg in the adaptation of Terry
McMillan's popular novel, and Leon Ichaso's ``Free of Eden,'' in
its world premiere, with Sidney Poitier and his daughter, Sydney.
</P>
<P>
   The festival's competition includes 26 independent feature
films, 6 documentaries and 32 short films. Sterling Macer has
entered his feature ``Park Day,'' a rite-of-passage story with
darkly spiritual undertones. Like everyone else, Macer is
competing, not for money but for a ``nice, beautiful award,'' said
Spikes.
</P>
<P>
   But prize money isn't what's important, Macer said. ``I think
the thing every filmmaker hopes for is distribution. That, of
course, is the ultimate goal that would please me, my investors and
everybody involved in the film.''
</P>
<P>
   For Spikes, whose dream is to proclaim August ``Black Film
Month,'' the magnitude of Urbanworld is just starting to sink in.
The Urbanworld Film and Television Producers Conference will
convene on the West Coast early next year; ``The Urbanworld
Industry Directory: A Minority Guide to the Entertainment
Industry,'' is about to go to press. The festival even has its own
weekly public-access television show in Manhattan on channel 56 on
Mondays at 10 p.m. that shows shorts by black filmmakers.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm spending it out of my pocket with the dream of building
things,'' Spikes said of his investment, emotional and financial,
in the festival. ``This year we had people making their films to
get into Urbanworld. It has become a spawning ground to make black
filmmakers move faster and fight.''
</P>
<P>
   ``When you look at the landscape, it is insane that we're this
big in two years,'' he said. ``But the demand was there, and we're
trying to keep up with it. The black community spent $1.5 billion
at the box office last year. That's nothing to sneeze at. That's a
lot of power.''

&HT;      LAMM CAMPAIGN COFFERS DWINDLING; CAMPBELL HAS MORE THAN $1
MILLION WARCHEST ADVANTAGE
</HEADLINE>

 &HT;      (CORRECTS QUOTE IN 13th GRAF TO ``BEATING ROMERO'') &HT;     By Elliot Zaret  
 &HT;    c. 1998 States News Service  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON, Aug. 4 -- Dottie Lamm, who many expect will win next
week's Democratic primary, may have an uphill battle if she gets to
challenge Sen. Ben Nighthorse Campbell in November.
</P>
<P>
   Lamm's campaign coffers have dwindled -- perhaps dipping below
$100,000 -- compared to nearly $1.3 million in Campbell's warchest,
according to the latest campaign finance reports filed with the
Federal Election Commission.
</P>
<P>
   ``Assuming she wins (the primary), she starts out behind,'' said
Jennifer Duffy, who tracks Senate races for the Washington-based
Cook Political Report.
</P>
<P>
   The pre-primary reports, which cover the period from July 1 to
July 22, show that Lamm raised $52,572 over the three weeks and
spent $141,648, leaving her campaign with $234,117 to spend on the
election.
</P>
<P>
   But last week, the former columnist and wife of former-Gov. Dick
Lamm spent about $150,000 purchasing advertising time on
television, according to Lamm spokesman Omar Jabara. That would put
her warchest under the $100,000 level with three months to go
before the election.
</P>
<P>
   Campbell, on the other hand, raised $128,469 -- more than $6,000
a day over the three-week period -- and spent $159,141. This leaves
the incumbent with $1.26 million in hand for the election.
</P>
<P>
   Their primary challengers didn't fare nearly as well. Democratic
State Rep. Gil Romero of Pueblo's campaign is $2,441 in the red
after raising $14,351 and spending $20,097. Republican Bill Eggert
raised $15,609 and spent $13,026, leaving him with $11,517 in the
bank -- more than offset by $53,950 in campaign debt the Denver
attorney has accrued.
</P>
<P>
   But the Lamm campaign is happy with their fundraising so far.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're on track,'' said Jabara, who refers to Campbell as ``the
most vulnerable senator in the country.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think anyone expects anyone to have as much cash on
hand as a sitting incumbent who has had five-and-a-half years to
raise money,'' said Jabara.
</P>
<P>
   Jabara said the campaign expects to see a fundraising boom after
the primary. ``Because of the primary, a lot of groups and whatnot
are holding out, because they don't want to pick sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy called Lamm's strategy of early campaign spending ``a
gamble,'' but said it may be necessary. Lamm has spent $569,119 so
far this year, compared to $490,711 spent by Campbell, and
well-under $100,000 each for their two challenges.
</P>
<P>
   ``She sort of has to play the risk,'' said Duffy. ``The risk is
you spend all that money and get nothing. The payoff is beating
Romero by a sizeable margin and gaining momentum for the general
(election).''
</P>
<P>
   Duffy said that the strategy has proven successful in ``a couple
other states,'' most notably in Ohio, where Democrat Mary Boyle
spent most of her money before the May 5 primary, but got such a
lift after her win, she raised about $450,000 in the following six
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   ``You know the expression 'You've got to spend it to get it?'
That might apply to Dottie Lamm,'' said Duffy.
</P>
<P>
   Lamm's latest spending has gone to a yet-to-be-aired TV
commercial that begins with a picture of a Harley Davidson
motorcycle -- Campbell's famous mode of transportation -- with a
``for sale'' sign on it, said Jabara. The commercial will announce
that ``Colorado needs a new set of wheels'' before showing Lamm
riding away on a bicycle.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial is indicative of Lamm's strategy since announcing
her campaign in October, which has been to look past the primary
and concentrate on Campbell. That strategy may have contributed to
her loss to Romero in the Democratic state assembly in May. But
Lamm supporters hope it will pay off.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all working toward Campbell,'' said Jabara. ``Our
strategy from the beginning is to work towards the general
(election).'' Campbell spokesman Stuart Roy said Lamm's strategy
made her unnecessarily vulnerable to Romero.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd be a little worried if I were her,'' said Roy. ``Clearly
they gave Romero a chance to catch up, which they never should.''
</P>
<P>
   Roy, who said Campbell expects to exceed the $2.2 million Sen.
Wayne Allard spent in 1996, called Lamm's fundraising ``fairly
weak.''
</P>
<P>
   ``I assume she'll pick up some money (after the primary) --
she's gotta do better than she did,'' said Roy. ``But there's two
sides to fund raising. One is raising it, the other is keeping
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Campbell has been airing a commercial of his own, which tells
his life history highlighting his path from an orphanage to the
U.S. Senate.
</P>
<P>
   Overall, Duffy expects the campaign spending to be relatively
low during the race -- something she attributes to the $2 million
spending cap on the gubernatorial race. Cambell's fundraising, she
said, is dwarfed by that of many incumbent senators.
</P>
<P>
   But Campbell has nearly as much cash on hand now as he spent in
the entire 1992 race. In that race, Campbell -- then a Democrat --
spent $1.6 million to beat Republican Terry Considine.
</P>
<P>
   That may provide some solace to Campbell, but it may be good
news for Lamm as well, since in that election, Considine spent
$650,000 -- about 42 percent -- more than Campbell did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Democrats almost never outraise Republicans, but still manage
to win elections,'' said Jabara. ``We don't need to match him
dollar-for-dollar to beat him.''

AFTER CAPE STANDOFF, MOTIVES IN QUESTION

<P>
   Lori Urs wanted John Nutter for his blood.
</P>
<P>
   The man who is charged with holding her and her daughter hostage
last weekend was the one she had sought so desperately last year in
her fight to exonerate Joseph Roger O'Dell, the Virginia man
convicted of rape and murder whom she married on death row.
</P>
<P>
   Nutter, she believed, was a potential witness who could help
clear O'Dell's name, bringing shame on the law enforcement system
that had sentenced him to death and, later, executed him.
</P>
<P>
   It was Nutter who, she believed, waged a bar fight 13 years ago
that left O'Dell splashed with blood _ blood that became a key
piece of evidence against O'Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Urs wanted to prove that Nutter's blood _ and not the victim's _
stained O'Dell's clothes on the night of the murder for which he
was sentenced to death.
</P>
<P>
   Their lives collided more than a year ago, but never quite so
dramatically as last weekend, when Nutter allegedly invaded her
Chatham, Mass. summer home, holding both Urs and her daughter
hostage.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the twists and turns of their relationship are under
scrutiny: Was theirs a simple tale of love gone wrong _ or was it a
story of a woman courting danger in a bizarre attempt to draw out
evidence that could clear the name of the man she married?
</P>
<P>
   Urs, through a lawyer, told the Globe that her only interest in
Nutter was as a witness in O'Dell's case. But Nutter told a Cape
Cod Times editor in a phone call during the hostage siege on
Saturday that the two had been in a romantic relationship and that
she had ``used'' him.
</P>
<P>
   And the owner of the Harwich, Mass. motel where Nutter lived
said the two often showed up together _ as recently as June 30.
</P>
<P>
   Those who knew Urs and her passionate, almost obsessive fight to
clear O'Dell's name said Monday that, at least initially, Urs
invited Nutter into her life in an effort to help O'Dell's cause.
What ensued, prosecutors say, was a nightmare for both her and her
daughter.
</P>
<P>
   Urs, 44, was separated from her first husband and living in
Princeton, N.J., when she gave up her job as an accountant in 1993
to pursue O'Dell's case full time.
</P>
<P>
   As a volunteer investigating his case for Centurion Ministries,
an advocacy group for inmates sentenced to life sentences or death,
she began writing love letters to O'Dell.
</P>
<P>
   Her unorthodox outreach, and her restlessness with the slow pace
of the agency's investigation, led her to part with the agency and
to launch her own ferocious effort to clear O'Dell's name.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's strong-willed. She's real smart. She had her own money.
So that was part of her impatience with us,'' said Kate Germond, an
investigator with Centurion Ministries.
</P>
<P>
   Urs had become convinced of O'Dell's innocence. He had been
convicted of raping and beating to death Helen Schartner, a
44-year-old Virginia Beach secretary whose body was found behind a
bar on March 6, 1985. O'Dell's conviction and sentence to die by
lethal injection became an international cause celebre shepherded
by Urs, with the support of Pope John Paul II, Mother Teresa, and
Sister Helen Prejean, the anti-death-penalty author of the book
``Dead Man Walking.''
</P>
<P>
   Just hours before O'Dell was executed on July 23, 1997, Urs
married him, leaving some people to wonder what would attract her
to such a union.
</P>
<P>
   She replied, in a Globe interview, ``I'm not one of those flaky
women who falls in love with death-row inmates. I'm a very stable
person. I was just so outraged every step of the way. My passion
kept growing.''
</P>
<P>
   Now her motives are being questioned in her dealings with
Nutter, an ex-convict who first came to her attention because he
allegedly was in the fight broken up by O'Dell. After her break
from Centurion Ministries, Urs hired a private investigator to find
him.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Reyna, a Texas private detective, said he got involved
after Urs had tracked down Nutter through the Navy, where he had
served.
</P>
<P>
   He located Nutter's parents in upstate New York, and, through
them, traced Nutter to Jacksonville, Fla., where he was working in
a oil-changing garage.
</P>
<P>
   Urs traveled to Florida to pursue the lead.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Lori was doing a job the best way she knew how and I
think he became infatuated and that led to this real unfortunate
thing,'' Reyna said.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Urs got what she wanted: a blood sample.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nutter's blood type was the same as the victim's type,'' said
Reyna, who obtained the sample. ``He was very helpful.''
</P>
<P>
   O'Dell had several excuses to explain away the blood found on
his clothing _ including his claim that he had broken up a bloody
bar fight, said Stephen Test, a former Virginia assistant attorney
general who handled the original prosecution. Nutter was never
called as a witness in the initial trial, in which O'Dell defended
himself, Test said.
</P>
<P>
   The blood on O'Dell's clothes became a source of dispute. While
blood on O'Dell's jacket was shown to be Schartner's, DNA testing
conducted five years after her murder could not link blood on his
shirt to either him or the victim, said Virginia Assistant Attorney
General Eugene Murphy.
</P>
<P>
   The defense team that handled O'Dell's appeals seized on that
point.
</P>
<P>
   ``The DNA evidence undermined the evidence at trial, and showed
(that) the jury did not have a true picture,'' said Bob Smith, the
lead defense attorney with the New York firm of Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton &AMP; Garrison.
</P>
<P>
   Whether Nutter was involved in the bar fight _ indeed, whether
there was a fight at all _ is still subject to speculation. While
prosecutors confirmed there had been a fight in the early-morning
hours, no one was seriously hurt, leading them to believe O'Dell
had seen police responding to a fight and concocted the story.
</P>
<P>
   Urs, however, believed that the fight was a key to proving
O'Dell's innocence by providing an alternative explanation for the
blood on his clothes.
</P>
<P>
   In June, with the help of Virginia Beach attorney Andrew
Shilling, Urs was awarded all of O'Dell's personal items _ except
for evidence including the blood-stained jacket and blood and semen
samples. Urs wanted the items so additional DNA tests could be
conducted, possibly comparing the samples to the one she had
obtained from Nutter.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews with The Cape Cod Times, during calls he made
while he held Urs's daughter hostage, Nutter called Urs a liar and
accused her of using him after O'Dell's execution.
</P>
<P>
   ``She just used me,'' he said. ``She uses people. ... Now, all
of a sudden, I'm not good enough for her because Joe's dead.''
</P>
<P>
   The weekend standoff at Urs's house was not Urs's first
explosive run-in with Nutter. On Sept. 3, 1997, Nutter allegedly
beat Urs and barricaded himself in her house, drawing police into a
six-hour standoff.
</P>
<P>
   A police report shows that Urs distanced herself from any
relationship with Nutter, saying she met him when she was
interviewing him as a witness to a major crime she was
investigating.
</P>
<P>
   ``Her attentions to him was interpreted as amour,'' an officer
wrote in the Chatham police report. ``Ms. Urs claims no amour, but
that Mr. Nutter apparently does not know what `no' means. And he
has been trying to convince Ms. Urs of the word `yes.'''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, Urs spoke on Nutter's behalf to prevent him from
being jailed for 14 months on charges of assault and battery and
malicious destruction. He ended up with a three-year suspended
sentence, probation, and counseling _ and returned for another
standoff last weekend.
</P>
<P>
   After allegedly breaking into Urs's home Friday night, Nutter
allegedly took her 14-year-old daughter hostage. When Urs returned
home a few hours later, she, too, was held by Nutter, who allegedly
was armed with a shotgun and a knife.
</P>
<P>
   Police say both women were raped and Urs was badly beaten before
she was able to escape, leaving her daughter inside. It was a
harrowing 36 hours for the 14-year-old, investigators say.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, negotiators coaxed Nutter out by getting Urs to pretend
to agree to his latest demand: that she marry him.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Urs issued a brief statement to the Globe. Through
Shilling, her Virginia Beach attorney, she again said she knew
Nutter only because of his connection to the O'Dell case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mr. Nutter is obviously a very disturbed individual and Ms.
Urs is very upset about the harm he has caused both her and her
daughter,'' said Shilling. ``She would like to thank everyone who
assisted her and her daughter during this crisis. She is very happy
that the incident was ended without further injury to anyone.''

   Hey, New York Is Funny, OK?
</P>
<P>
   For Jerry Seinfeld, 10 performances on Broadway starting
Wednesday night amount to a return not only to his hometown but
also to the very creative heart of comedy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Humor is really a New York invention, as far as I'm
concerned,'' Seinfeld said. ``All humor emanates from New York. All
people in New York are funny and get funnier as they get older, and
everyone outside New York gets less funny.''
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld will be appearing at the Broadhurst Theater through
Sunday night, performing the stand-up comedy act he has developed
throughout his career. The Broadway appearances will culminate in a
live HBO special Sunday night called ``I'm Telling You for the Last
Time.'' Seinfeld said after Sunday he would ``never do any of these
jokes again,'' and would start work on an all-new comedy act.
</P>
<P>
   The Broadway appearances thus represent the second act of
closure for the comedian this year, after he concluded his
long-running hit situation comedy on NBC in May, with one of the
most-watched episodes in recent television history.
</P>
<P>
   At a news conference Tuesday, Seinfeld said that he decided to
follow up the end of his series with a concert tour that took him
to locations like Australia, England and Des Moines before New
York. That was much more appealing than a standard vacation, he
said. ``To be in front of an audience is the most fun I can have,''
Seinfeld said. ``I've been on beaches. I've been on boats. It's
pleasant, but it's not really a lot of fun.''
</P>
<P>
   As for the letting go of what he called the ``complicated work''
involved in putting together a weekly series, Seinfeld compared it
to a familiar form of liberation: ``Did you ever take a dog into
the park and take his leash off? He kind of looks at you for a
second and then he bolts like a maniac. It's something like that.''
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld said he also ``wanted to thank New York'' and so
designated all the proceeds from the 10 shows at the Broadhurst to
two programs that benefit arts programs in city schools, Pencil and
Arts Connection.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite thing about being back in New York? ``I guess it
would be those recorded messages in the back of the cabs,'' he
said. ``I've never done one, but I'd like to, because I'm sure the
people love them. I only wear my seat belt because Judd Hirsch
tells me to.''
</P>
<P>
   After the HBO show Sunday, Seinfeld said, he has no specific
plans. It may take eight months to a year, he said, to create a new
comedy act, ``depending on how hard I work.'' He will release a
comedy album based on the Broadway performances. And he still may
do something unusual, like start up his own advertising agency,
which he said was just a notion he's been toying with.
</P>
<P>
   One thing he said he certainly would not do: another television
series. ``Only an idiot would think they would be that lucky
again,'' he said.

   Growing Popularity
</P>
<P>
   Ever since those quirky cartoon characters Chicken, Cow, Dexter
and Dee Dee began appearing every week night, instead of once a
week, the Cartoon Network's ratings have shot upward.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, Cartoon Network quietly moved to No. 2 (behind
Nickelodeon) among cable networks in total-day Nielsen ratings for
July. Some might chalk it up to subscriber growth _ the network
just passed the 50 million mark, meaning it appears in about
two-thirds of homes that have cable _ but in fact, its ratings
growth has outstripped its subscriber growth.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're in about 20 percent more homes than we were in July a
year ago,'' Betty Cohen, the network's president, said. ``But our
household ratings are up 40 percent, and our kids 6-to-11 ratings
are up 60 percent. That means that in the homes we're in, far more
people are watching us.''
</P>
<P>
   More are watching in prime time, too. In June, ``Dexter's
Laboratory'' (at 8 p.m.) and ``Cow and Chicken'' (8:30) began five
nights a week, and in July, Cartoon had 50 percent more homes tuned
in, and 69 percent more children aged 6 to 11, than in prime time
of July a year ago.
</P>
<P>
   Because it reaches fewer homes, Cartoon doesn't have as many
viewers, in absolute numbers, as the most popular cable networks _
USA, Nickelodeon, TNT, TBS and Lifetime. Still, Cartoon's growth
rate would be welcomed by any of them.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm proud that we've done it with quality programming,'' Ms.
Cohen added, ``not just any old schlock.''
</P>
<P>
   Both ``Cow and Chicken'' and ``Dexter's Laboratory'' got Emmy
Award nominations two weeks ago. They are competing against ``The
Simpsons,'' ``King of the Hill'' and ``South Park'' for the
statuette for best animated program, which will be awarded in
September.

   Stern on Saturday Night
</P>
<P>
   CBS has picked a name for the television version of Howard
Stern's radio show that will begin running on CBS stations later
this month.
</P>
<P>
   It's ``The Howard Stern Radio Show.'' But yes, it will be on
television. The show will assemble highlights from Stern's daily
radio shows, which are already on camera and presented on the E
cable channel.
</P>
<P>
   These highlights will be different, the CBS announcement said,
and will include some new material _ animated bits,
man-on-the-street interviews _ developed to complement whatever
theme has been running through the week.
</P>
<P>
   The Stern show, which is being syndicated by CBS and has been
devised as competition for NBC's ``Saturday Night Live,'' will
begin on Aug. 22. It will be broadcast at 11:30 p.m. in New York
and many other cities, but may run at 12:30 in some locations.
</P>
<P>
   The executive producer, named Tuesday, will be Jim Biederman,
who has previously worked on projects for the ``Saturday Night
Live'' producer, Lorne Michaels, like the ``Kids in the Hall''
series.
</P>

<P>
   TV Chief at Miramax
</P>
<P>
   Miramax Films on Tuesday named Billy Campbell, who resigned this
summer as the No. 2 programming executive at CBS, as president of
the newly announced Miramax Television division.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've got a very clear desk, since we're starting from the
ground up,'' Campbell said Tuesday from Los Angeles, where he will
continue to be based. He said he hoped to produce television shows
that would bear the Miramax ``passion for quality,'' adding that
what had always most impressed him about Miramax films was their
``incredible characters, exquisitely cast.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The line between television and filmmaking isn't even blurry
any more, it's gone,'' he said, adding that he hoped to mix the
contacts he has built in 11 years in television (at ABC, Warner
Brothers studios and CBS) with Miramax's film community contacts to
create innovative characters who, ``instead of being one shots in a
movie can evolve.''

JUSTICE THOMAS, POLITICIAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By MARIANNE MEANS  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers   WASHINGTON _ Supreme Court Justice
Clarence Thomas, one of the most intellectually limited jurists
ever to sit on the high bench, will never be a judicial giant.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite his position, he is inescapably a political figure
rather than a revered legal authority.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has demonstrated once again that he knows exactly how to
play racial politics to distract his opponents from the ideological
radicalism of his opinions. As a legal thinker he is
underqualified, but as a racial agitator hiding behind his color he
is very clever.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas spoke recently before the National Bar Association, a
black lawyers' organization that had invited him and then tried to
withdraw the invitation after influential members protested. His
opposition to affirmative action and other legal tools to advance
civil rights angers many members and blacks in general.
</P>
<P>
   They feel that conservatives today are systematically unraveling
decades of hard-won progress toward racial equality and that
Thomas, as the successor to civil rights crusader Thurgood
Marshall, is a traitor because he supports that effort.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas did not attempt to justify the logic of his disdain for
affirmative action programs that help minorities and from which he
himself had benefited. (He was admitted to Yale Law School under a
program in which a number of slots were set aside for minority
students.)
</P>
<P>
   Instead, he wallowed in self-pity because his views have been
criticized and suggested that his detractors are racist to imply
that he can't think for himself. Thomas defended his right to his
own views as an individual and insisted he is not duty-bound to
defend concepts traditionally accepted by black voters as in the
best interests of their race.
</P>
<P>
   Fine. So what's the issue? Like Voltaire, Americans generally
believe in an individual's right to his or her own views _ as well
as the right of others to disagree with those views. The issue is
the idiocy of Thomas' ideas and their politically polarizing
impact, not his right to hold them.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas declared that he refused ``to have my ideas assigned to
me as though I was an intellectual slave because I'm black.'' This
drags a colored herring across the simple fact that in his seven
years on the bench Thomas has voted nearly all the time with fellow
ultraconservative Antonin Scalia, an experienced jurist of
formidable intellect, linguistic power and ideological rigidity.
(They are usually, although not consistently, joined by Chief
Justice William Rehnquist.)
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Thomas insisted during his Senate confirmation hearings
that he had no agenda and thought judges should ``eliminate
ideologies.'' Yet on the high bench he has been dogmatically
ideological. Either he deliberately hoodwinked the senators by
posing as a moderate or he was suddenly influenced by something or
someone.
</P>
<P>
   On the bench, Thomas has been consistently ultraconservative,
voting to restrict abortion, abandoning the traditional separation
of church and state and narrowly interpreting the Voting Rights
Act. He also held that prisoners have no constitutional right not
to be beaten by guards unless the assault is unusually severe.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas is angry over the bitter criticism he has endured. Yet he
is not an innocent bystander here, someone who has done nothing
divisive. He has added his judicial voice to a conservative
political movement that seeks to uproot decades of public social
policy. Naturally people are upset.
</P>
<P>
   And the shaky nature of his Senate confirmation by a mere four
votes guaranteed forever that his judicial performance would be
scrutinized closely. When he was nominated, he was barely
qualified, having been a federal judge for only one year and a
political appointee in middle-level positions before that. His
appointment was a transparent political stunt. President George
Bush needed a conservative Republican black to replace Marshall and
there weren't many alternatives.
</P>
<P>
   Law professor Anita Hill's televised accusation that he had
humiliated her with lewd comments and unwanted advances when he was
her boss at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission left an
indelible smear on his reputation.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas denied any sexual harassment and played the race card,
calling her charges ``a high-tech lynching for an uppity black.''
It worked, barely, with confused Senate males. But it left many
women convinced that he was a lying lecher and galvanized
increasing numbers of women to run for public office.
</P>
<P>
   Only two years after that confirmation battle, he created new
doubts about his character by making several speeches to
ultraconservative organizations, some with ambitious legal agendas.
This willingness to identify himself with politically ideological
organizations raised questions of legal ethics. To avoid such
questions, most justices confine their appearances to legal groups
and universities.
</P>
<P>
   Thomas has since been more cautious about his public appearances
but has tended to stick to friendly audiences. If his venture into
the enemy camp last week was an effort to win over the black
liberal community, he can forget it. He needn't agree with them
because they are black, but they needn't agree with him because he
is black.

<P>
   NEW YORK _ Min has the same problems that many young wives have
dealt with. She wants a baby but can't get pregnant. She has caught
her husband flirting with other women and suspects the worst. (Her
best friends assure her that her husband must love her because
she's terrific but suggest she try a new perfume.) And the husband
won't stand up to his father, who is also his boss. Min is also
Empress of Chosun, her friends are her ladies-in-waiting, it is the
late 19th century, and her actions could have international
consequences.
</P>
<P>
   So goes ``The Last Empress,'' the impressive musical from Seoul
now paying a return visit to the New York State Theater. It tells
the story of Queen Min's marriage, of her Evita-like influence on
matters of state and of the battle over the ``modernization'' of
Chosun, isolationist Land of Morning Calm, which became Korea.
</P>
<P>
   The show is gorgeous to look at, from the evocative lighting to
the elegant stylized sets to an abundance of rich, colorful
costumes. And it is gorgeous to listen to. As Queen Min, Taewon Yi
Kim, who has an exquisite voice, makes her manipulative character
thoroughly sympathetic. (She alternates in the role with Wonjung
Kim, who, when heard last summer, also had a strong, beautiful
voice.) Hee Sung Yu, as King Kojung, Min's husband, and Sung Hoon
Lee, as Taewongun, the King's father and Regent of Chosun, are
powerful and touching. But it is often the chorus numbers that
thrill. ``The Last Empress'' seems to have a way with the
militaristic, like the opening number in which 11 soldiers,
introduced by pounding drums, declare their readiness to die. ``We
are the cherry blossom,'' they sing. ``We are willing to fall to
bring spring.''
</P>
<P>
   The English supertitles, high above the stage, aren't always so
poetic. Later, soldiers sing what is translated as ``We will fight
all our enemies. Isn't it great?'' and ``We have modern weapons.
Your rusty guns are for the birds.'' And the show is long, more
than two and a half hours, which can be a little too much for those
in the audience who don't understand Korean. But this lavish
production generally makes the effort worth it. The closing number,
``Rise, People of Chosun,'' is enough to stir people of any
nationality.

TAKING A LONG VIEW OF TEMPORAL DANCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BRUCE WEBER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   MINNEAPOLIS _ The performing arts program at the Walker Arts
Center here is probably the largest of any museum in the country,
but even so it has never tried anything like ``Life Performs Art,''
which opened June 28 and runs through Sept. 20.
</P>
<P>
   Using artifacts like stage props, painted backdrops, photographs
and films, music and other sound effects and, almost incidentally,
videotapes of actual performances, it is essentially a
retrospective of the work of three dance-based performance artists:
Bill T. Jones, Meredith Monk and Merce Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   But more than that, it is a show that melds the museum's twin
concerns _ visual arts and performing arts _ and directly addresses
a curatorial conundrum: How is it possible to represent both the
fleeting experience and lasting meaning of live performance within
a static gallery space?
</P>
<P>
   ``That was the struggle over four years,'' said Richard Flood,
the museum's chief curator. ``How to animate and not just document
this work. We wanted to see if it was possible to make a show about
performing art without making it seem like a fly in amber.''
</P>
<P>
   The idea was to examine the careers of the three artists, all of
whom have long histories of performing at the Walker, without
actually staging their work, and at the same time to distinguish
their artistic visions and suggest the infinite range of possible
expression inherent in dance.
</P>
<P>
   Thus Jones' galleries focus on social concerns _ racism,
diversity, the AIDS plague _ that his work has explored. Ms. Monk's
autobiographical pieces are represented by her idiosyncratic visual
and aural inventions. And Cunningham's galleries feature the
original artwork of his famous collaborators Robert Rauschenberg,
Jasper Johns and Andy Warhol and the music of John Cage and David
Tudor, emphasizing the collusive abstractions that have been his
careerlong concern.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a series of galleries that are both visually
striking and, because many are enlivened by sound and movement,
unusually full of stimuli. In one, the painted masks and dining
table used in ``Last Supper at Uncle Tom's Cabin/The Promised
Land,'' the 1990 dance piece by Jones, are presented as art objects
in and of themselves while a videotape of the performed piece plays
on a small screen in the corner.
</P>
<P>
   It's a reversal of a theater audience's perspective: the props
are front and center, the focus of attention. The work itself is a
prop. In another gallery, helium-filled Mylar pillows float in a
space that is empty but for photographs of Cunningham's troupe
dancing with similar pillows, designed by Warhol, in the 1968 piece
``Rain Forest.'' Visitors to the gallery can and do create their
own choreography to the original Tudor music, poking the pillows
out of their way, playfully or in annoyance, as the original
dancers did.
</P>
<P>
   In a third, a darkened room filled with the props from the 1976
opera ``Quarry,'' by Ms. Monk, includes a row of X-rays on the
wall, a blanket on the floor, a mobile of hats and papier-mache
airplanes hanging from the ceiling and a stack of open suitcases.
The space is saturated with barking incantations from a box radio
and animated by a film of tiny dancers crawling in the interstices
of a rock wall. It's a whole performance, missing only performers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The idea was to put the observer in the center of the
energy,'' Ms. Monk said in a phone interview from western
Massachusetts, where she was traveling. ``What I would hope is you
would feel like you were the performer.''
</P>
<P>
   Throughout there is a bombardment of the senses, so that viewing
the exhibition is an odd experience _ neither the contemplative
stroll through a traditional gallery of paintings and sculptures
nor the interactive connection fostered by some computer-enhanced
exhibits. Museumgoers walk the galleries looking visibly entranced
and unsettled. ``Wonderful, I'm alive!'' one person wrote in the
visitors' log. ``I didn't like this exhibit,'' commented another.
``It scared me.''
</P>
<P>
   There are documentary artifacts on display as well, the stuff of
more conventional museum fare: a long vitrine with decades' worth
of Ms. Monk's shoes; photographs by Arnie Zane, Jones' collaborator
and life partner, who died in 1988; and several letters from the
1940s and early 1950s from Cunningham to the Walker offering
performances by himself and John Cage, for fees ranging up to $350.
(They were turned down several times.)
</P>
<P>
   There is also a listening room with Ms. Monk's compact discs and
a computer work station where visitors can try out the
choreographic software that Cunningham has been using for five
years. But more overwhelming are the galleries full of
deconstructed dance-theater pieces, their individual elements
sifted out and juxtaposed.
</P>
<P>
   ``The object was not to show objects, but projects,'' said
Philippe Vergne, who was the curator for Cunningham's exhibit. ``So
even if the objects on display are not `art,' who cares? The idea
of art and the documentation of art is merging anyway.'' More than
ever, he said, museums are occupying territory ``somewhere between
fiction and documentary.''
</P>
<P>
   A case in point is the gallery featuring ``Still/Here,'' Jones'
1990 piece about AIDS, which became the focus of a debate on
``victim art'' after The New Yorker's dance critic, Arlene Croce,
dismissed it without even attending.
</P>
<P>
   In the gallery, the videotape of the piece is incidental.
Featured are projections of video art, notes from AIDS patients'
workshops conducted by Jones while researching the piece and a
perpetual video of a beating heart. Imagine a Swiss watch taken
apart, the innards displayed, piece by piece, in esthetically
pleasing fashion. It's not a functioning timepiece anymore, yet
does it, in the artistic sense, work?
</P>
<P>
   ``What was leveled at `Still/Here' was that it was bringing sick
people into a performance,'' Jones said from Athens, where his
troupe was performing. ``I think these artifacts leave an
interesting residue of what the piece was trying to say. Maybe
leaving out the live performance has helped its theoretical
underpinning. I'm aware there was something about being trapped in
a theater with all this heavy subject matter and the abstract
material of dance that was overwhelming. Now you can see that the
visual elements have their own resonance, and I'm very proud of
that.''
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
nn
</P>
<P>
   For the curators (each choreographer worked with a different
one) the task was complicated not only by artistic matters but also
by practical ones. None of the artists have well-catalogued
archives; years' worth of stage sets and costumes from Cunningham's
productions, for instance, have been haphazardly stored in a
basement in Manhattan's West Village.
</P>
<P>
   When Vergne went to meet with Bill Cook, the executive director
of the Merce Cunningham Dance Foundation, and asked about
Rauschenberg's painted backdrops for the 1958 piece
``Summerspace,'' it turned out that they were in the canvas bag he
was sitting on.
</P>
<P>
   ``The exhibit created an excuse for us to really go in and
evaluate the condition of all this stuff and to begin properly
caring for it,'' Cook said. ``It's been treated like a bunch of old
sets, as if we were putting on a show in the backyard, when in fact
they're original Johnses and Rauschenbergs.''
</P>
<P>
   The curators found that the project required more diplomacy than
normal. ``A curator essentially arranges something in space, which
is also what a performance artist does,'' said Flood, who
supervised the project. ``There was a whole lot of bridge building
to do before trust was in place.''
</P>
<P>
   The artists participated in the planning of the show to varying
degrees. Ms. Monk was largely in control of her exhibit, said Siri
Engberg, who was her curator, and ``she wanted it not to be
chronological, and to be experiential more than didactic.''
</P>
<P>
   Jones, who worked with the curator Kellie Jones (no relation),
was a bit less involved, though he did expressly want his exhibit
to read chronologically. ``The very first thing that happened was
that I asked, `Do you really know what you're doing?''' Bill T.
Jones said. `` `Have you seen the work? What story are you going to
tell? Are you going to play to the visual arts?' The artifacts,
after all, were created to support movement. But in the end, I
think the artifacts support the raison d'etre. There's a story
there I can live with. I have a new respect for curatorial acumen
and curatorial commitment.''
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, characteristically laissez-faire, has yet to see the
exhibition. (He and his company will perform at the Walker on Sept.
20 as part of the 10th-anniversary celebration of the museum's
sculpture garden.)
</P>
<P>
   ``I met Merce twice, for, like, seven minutes each time,''
Vergne said. ``He would say, `You want to show that? That's
marvelous.' It was a very strange way of working for me. I'm used
to making a checklist and having the artist destroy it and make his
own. But in a way, it's typical of his anarchist's way of working.
In their collaborations, he didn't tell Rauschenberg what to paint
or John Cage what kind of music to write. He let them do their
work.''
</P>
<P>
   The result is something clamorous and unfamiliar. ``I hope,''
said Philip Bither, the Walker's curator for performing arts,
``that we've produced a different kind of live experience for
people.''

WINE OF THE WEEK  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK J. PRIAL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; Kim Crawford Tietjen Gisborne Chardonnay 1997, New Zealand.
About $20. &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Kim Crawford is quite well-known in New Zealand; he was named
winemaker of the year there in 1995 and 1996. And no wonder: this
chardonnay is quite good.
</P>
<P>
   In taste, New Zealand white wines bear absolutely no resemblance
to French whites. But stylistically they are much closer than one
might think. They are lean, intense and almost never overoaked. And
like the best French chardonnays, they are worlds away, literally
and metaphorically, from fat, oaky California wines. Crawford also
has an unoaked version, which I haven't tasted.
</P>
<P>
   As for that name, Tietjen is the fellow who grows the grapes and
Gisborne is the place where he grows them. The grapes are hauled
overnight to Auckland, where Crawford takes over and makes this
delightful wine. It could use another year in the bottle.

TONI MORRISON PREACHES TO THE CHOIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Tusday Aug. 11)  
 By SUSAN SWARTZ   
 Santa Rosa (Calif.) Press Democrat   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Good literature can't save the world, said Toni Morrison,
pointing out that ``the worst people in the world also read the
best books.'' So, reading the best ``may not have an effect on
these tyrants.''
</P>
<P>
   But for others, said Morrison, ``Something is altered in a life
because of what he or she reads. A small shift in perception that
will not go back.''
</P>
<P>
   There could be some words missing in that quote, but that's what
I scribbled down in a notebook, in the dark at the Palace of Fine
Arts in San Francisco where the crowd's thrill at seeing Toni
Morrison was not unlike the standup rush that cheers the 49ers out
onto the field.
</P>
<P>
   Her meaning seemed clear. The more you read, the more you
understand. The more you understand, the more you accept, tolerate
and sympathize. This means fewer tyrants.
</P>
<P>
   Of course, Toni Morrison could have talked about the heat wave
and her fans would have applauded. It's a treat to see writers
given the star treatment, to have adoring fans of literature
yelping and clapping for the chance to watch and hear someone do
nothing more dazzling than stand still for an hour, read from a
book and take small sips of water.
</P>
<P>
   We are transfixed being read to by someone who knows best how to
accentuate her own words, when to bring the story round, how to
make us fear for the absent sister.
</P>
<P>
   Appearing with Toni Morrison this night was Dorothy Allison,
another literary diva, playing a backup role as host and on-stage
interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Before the show, a young woman bolted from the restroom,
straightened her ultra short skirt, shouted out, ``I'm mad for
Dorothy Allison,'' and hurried off as if Courtney Love was waiting
on stage.
</P>
<P>
   Oprah Winfrey, some say, has helped encourage this renewed
passion among book people. A shiny new hardback with Toni
Morrison's name on the front would seem tempting enough for most
fans, but her latest ``Paradise'' now lures readers with a stamp
saying it's part of Oprah's Book Club.
</P>
<P>
   Hurray for whatever it takes. The very fact that so many
loyalists grew huffy because their all-time favorite didn't make
the list of the top 100 English-language novels of the century was
another encouraging sign we haven't gone dull in the head.
Uninterested, we might have just said, ``Ulysses ... whatever.''
Instead we went properly ballistic because ``A Prayer for Owen
Meany'' was slighted.
</P>
<P>
   To hear the words spoken by a writer whose books you have hugged
to your chest is a privilege. She breathes. She laughs. It as if
Julia Child were to appear in your kitchen, create a souffle and
then spoon it into your mouth.
</P>
<P>
   They were two goddesses, zaftig and proud, Allison in a glittery
jacket, looking like a country western singer and Morrison in a
coat that resembled some kind of priestess robe, her gray coiled
hair wrapped around her head like a Pomo basket.
</P>
<P>
   Allison said, ``I have found the meaning of my life in books and
in the books of Toni Morrison.'' She went on to add she found
``inspiration, ammunition, belief, criticism.''
</P>
<P>
   With a nod to the best books list, she said she thought
Morrison's ``Beloved'' should be No. 1 on the top 100, siding with
critic John Leonard who once wrote that `` `Beloved' belongs on the
highest shelf of our literature even if half a dozen canonized
Wonderbread boys have to be elbowed off.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison dismissed the whole thing as gimmickry. ``Anytime they
say the 100 Best Anything you know it's marketing.''
</P>
<P>
   These are not modest women. They are as proud of their books as
they deserve to be. When the crowd tweeted and stomped for Allison,
she smiled and said, ``What a hoot.'' Then Allison confessed to
Morrison that she was so enamored of her that ``I actually
considered throwing myself at your feet.''
</P>
<P>
   Morrison said she'd accept adoration for her work, but not
personally for herself. ``I am not confused about my own
wonderfulness,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The two spoke about the risk of others tromping on their
creations. ``You have to husband your work, protect it, cultivate
it like you do the earth,'' said Morrison.
</P>
<P>
   ``Then, you have to trust the world with it,'' said Allison,
``like you do with a child.''
</P>
<P>
   They spoke about forgiveness and redemption _ themes that appear
in both their novels _ in order to heal what Allison calls ``a
destruction of the soul'' and Morrison refers to as ``betraying the
self.''
</P>
<P>
   My friend and I walked out into the night feeling privileged
like we might have, at another time, to be in the same room with
Jane Austen or Virginia Woolf. On the way home she told me she
didn't discover the joy of reading until she was a young adult and
moved to San Francisco and made friends with two men who had
shelves full of books. They urged ``The Grapes of Wrath'' and other
``unbelievable treasures'' on her and she was hooked her for life.
</P>
<P>
   Later when she became a mother she bribed her son, paying him
$20 for each book he read, so that he would not have to wait as
long to fall in love.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Anthony Holtvogt represents Ohio in soapbox races
 &HT;    By Tom Archdeacon
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAYTON, Ohio _ The more the boy and his dad talked the other
day, the more Mom's jaw dropped at what she heard.
</P>
<P>
   ``Back then, I only weighed about 40 pounds,'' 12-year-old
Anthony Holtvogt was recalling of that summer three years past. ``I
was too light for the car, so we had to put weights in it _ lots of
weights _ to the 200 pounds it was supposed to be.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal Holtvogt, Anthony's dad, nodded: ``And we were behind
schedule, so we were doing anything we could to get done.''
</P>
<P>
   He wasn't just talking about finishing in time to enter the
annual Greater Dayton Soap Box Derby competition on Burkhardt Hill.
He was detailing a more pressing deadline. He and his boy had to be
done with their dirty work before Anne Holtvogt got back to the
kitchen of their Paragon Road home.
</P>
<P>
   ``We got a lot of pieces of lead and steel and we were trying to
melt them down,'' Neal said. ``I used the propane tank from the
grill and . . .''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony smiled and looked at his mom: ``. . . And mom's pot
holders. Remember when she finally saw them? Steam could have come
out of her ears.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne shook her head: ``A friend had made them. They were my
favorites. And there they were all singed and burned. And I never
quite figured it out . . .''
</P>
<P>
   As Neal shifted uncomfortably, Anthony blurted everything out:
``That lead was hot and we used the pot holders and some pots and
pans, too.''
</P>
<P>
   ``From the kitchen?'' Anne said, shaking her head. ``Keep
talking.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony didn't hesitate: ``Remember when you said that special
lasagna pan of yours seemed kind of bumpy now? Well, that pan
worked the best for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal shrugged: ``The lasagna pan was perfect.''
</P>
<P>
   Anne drew a bead on the boy and his dad: ``That pan never has
been the same.''
</P>
<P>
   As Anthony sat there laughing _ surrounded by five trophies
topped by small golden cars _ you could tell that while Mom's pasta
might be a bit pockmarked these days, his Soap Box career is
running as smooth as ever.
</P>
<P>
   Saturday August 8, Anthony, a seventh grader at Magsig Junior
High, will represent Dayton in the All-American Soap Box Derby in
Akron. Three weeks ago he won the stock car division at the Greater
Dayton Derby. Fifteen-year-old Scott Ream of Springfield _ a Dayton
stock winner in 1996 and this year's super stock champ _ is making
a return trip to the All-American.
</P>
<P>
   For Anthony, this initial trip to Akron has come as a shock.
After laying siege to Mom's kitchen in 1995, he won one heat on
Burkhardt Hill, then lost the next two in Dayton's
double-elimination tournament. In 1996, he managed two wins before
his exit and last year he did a little better.
</P>
<P>
   Asked if his preparation was different this time, Anthony
grinned: ``I did all the work this year. I didn't want Dad to jinx
it.'' Although Anthony's needling was a joke, he is one of the
local racers who has been the most involved in his car, said Dayton
Derby Club member Mark Mihal, whose son Mark won the 1990
All-American when the family lived in Valparaiso, Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony's mechanical savvy comes from helping his father, whose
hobby is restoring cars. Add that to better driving skills and
simply growing up and you have much of the difference for Anthony
this year.
</P>
<P>
   Three weeks ago, the only added weight he had to deal with was
self imposed. After winning three heats, he lost once and went into
a funk: ``I figured, `Oh no, here we go again. I'll lose the next
one and it'll be all over again.' I got depressed and wouldn't let
anybody talk to me.''
</P>
<P>
   That's when Jennifer Crowe, a two-time Dayton winner who's
competed in Akron, pulled him aside for a pep talk. It worked.
Anthony won heat after heat and ended up winning his Akron trip by
a .002-of-a-second margin _ which, according to Mihal, was ``less
than an inch of race car.''
</P>
<P>
   Anthony's arrival in Akron on Sunday upheld a Dayton soap box
tradition that former Dayton Daily News photographer Myron Scott
began in 1933, when he saw kids with homemade coaster cars and took
a photo. He organized an event that drew 19 kids and later that
summer, a second event on Burkhardt Hill drew 363 kids and 40,000
spectators.
</P>
<P>
   The first All-American was held here in Dayton in 1934. Kids
from 34 cities showed up, as Bob Turner of Muncie, Ind., won in a
car made from barn siding. The following year the event was moved
to Akron.
</P>
<P>
   Today the sleek, gravity-powered cars can be made of fiberglass,
plastic and wood. While kids are encouraged to do much of the work,
there have been instances of adult tampering, most notably the
disqualification of 1973 winner Jimmy Gronen, whose wind-tunnel
tested car was equipped with an electro magnet, three cell battery
and hidden switches.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some people are Derby nuts,'' Neal said. ``For us, though,
it's a family activity.'' Still he said they want to adequately
represent Dayton, which had an All-American champ in David Schiller
in 1989.
</P>
<P>
   For a winning edge, racers have banked on myriad superstitions.
Many scream as they go down the hill, believing if they get the
right frequency of vibrations, it will help the wheels go faster.
Then there was Barney Townsend who in 1959 had his Teddy Bear kiss
all four wheels _ and then he won. For Anthony, there is the
sterling silver eagle necklace he wears for luck. He believes that
well could have made the difference against his girl rival in the
Dayton final.
</P>
<P>
   That's not to say girls aren't holding their own since they were
allowed to race beginning in 1971. They now win regularly at the
bottom of the hill _ and the top. In the 1980s, a teen-age girl in
Akron came up with the perfect prerace psych job when she leaned
over and kissed both of her boy rivals on the cheek. She rattled
them, then outran them.
</P>
<P>
   Anthony admitted girls have been his biggest helpers. Crowe
calmed him on Burkhardt Hill and since then, Megan Mihal, who has
competed twice at Akron, has told him what to expect this week.
</P>
<P>
   Monday, Anthony was part of a parade and red-carpet welcome to
Akron for the record 300 participants from 42 states, Canada and
Germany. A four-day sports camp precedes Saturday's race.
</P>
<P>
   ``This has been a wonderful experience,'' Anne said. ``It's been
good for Anthony's self-esteem and drawn us all closer as a family.
The thing I like best is seeing he and his dad working side by
side. The only thing, I wish they took as much interest in my car.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told him, if he doesn't win, I'm going to take over that
soap box. It's in such good shape, maybe I'll just put a motor on
it and drive it around myself.''
</P>
<P>
   This time, the jaws of both the boy and his dad dropped. Anne
Holtvogt just laughed. Call it potholder payback

months into its new leadership and direction _ which has produced a

   MONEY-TALK _ Focus funds are a growing presence in the mutual
fund world. A focus fund concentrates its investments to a limited
number of stocks, typically 20 or 30 issues. The theory: You get to

   Gramm joins call for speeding farm aid
</P>
<P>
   By Jerry Mahoney

<P>
   Cox News Service
</P>
<P>
   AUSTIN -- Texas Sen. Phil Gramm Monday joined the chorus of
national leaders calling for help for farmers and ranchers hurting
from the drought that is killing crops and parching pastures from
the Gulf Coast to the Panhandle.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm, a Republican member of the Senate Agriculture Committee,
urged the U.S. Department of Agriculture to speed up applications
for emergency loans from farmers and ranchers who face severe
losses because of the drought.
</P>
<P>
   The low-interest loans were triggered last month when
Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman declared that the entire state
is an agricultural disaster area.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, President Clinton issued a statement acknowledging
that while the nation's capital can't make it rain, it can help
farmers and ranchers who are hurting ``through no fault of their
own.''
</P>
<P>
   In separate trips to Texas last month, Glickman and Deputy
Secretary of Agriculture Richard Rominger visited farms and ranches
for a first-hand look at the effects of the severe dry spell.
</P>
<P>
   Gramm was scheduled late Monday to visit a drought-damaged
pasture in Brazos County after meeting with state agriculture
officials at Texas A&AMP;M University. He complained that it can take
up to 18 months for agricultural producers to receive money from
disaster loans.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems plain that requiring farmers and ranchers to wait a
year and a half to accommodate the processing of paperwork will
pile a policy disaster on top of a natural disaster,'' Gramm said.
</P>
<P>
   In urging the USDA to assign more employees to local Farm
Service Agency offices to handle the expected crush of disaster
applications, Gramm echoed a plea made in July by Texas Agriculture
Commissioner Rick Perry.
</P>
<P>
   Designed to help pay essential living expenses or to refinance
existing loans, the ``last-resort'' government loans carry an
interest rate of 3.75 percent. To be eligible, farmers and ranchers
must have suffered at least a 30 percent loss in normal revenues
and have been turned down by two private lenders.
</P>
<P>
   After the drought of 1996, 306 Texas producers received disaster
loans totaling $17.8 million, for an average of $58,000, according
to the Farm Service Agency, which administers the program.
</P>
<P>
   While that's a relatively small number, agriculture experts say
most farmers are able to get help from banks where they have
borrowed money for many years.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, about 110 of 254 counties were eligible for the
disaster loans.
</P>
<P>
   Separately from drought aid, Congress, responding to a severe
drop in farm income, sent President Clinton a bill Monday to
accelerate $5.5 billion in payments already due farmers in the year
ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Under current law, farmers who had been receiving subsidies
prior to the 1996 ``Freedom to Farm'' law would get transition
payments in two installments next year. The payments, which are
gradually declining and would end in 2002, are intended to wean
farmers off the old subsidies.
</P>
<P>
   The bill, given voice vote approval in the House on Monday and
the Senate last Thursday, would let those farmers receive all or
part of their transition payment Oct. 1, the first day of the new
federal fiscal year. President Clinton has indicated he will sign
it.

 &HT;    Rumors rife regarding Reds' Bowden
 &HT;    By Hal McCoy
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Rumors concerning the future of Cincinnati Reds
general manager Jim Bowden are emanating from both coasts:
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is at the front of the line to become general manager of
the Baltimore Orioles when owner Peter Angelos sweeps Pat Gillick
out the door.
</P>
<P>
   Bowden is standing outside the door at Fox waiting for interim
general manager Tommy Lasorda to move back upstairs so Bowden can
become GM.
</P>
<P>
   Truth or fiction, nobody would blame the energetic young Bowden
if he could squirm out of the last year of his contract in
small-market, cash-strapped Cincinnati and get an opportunity to
spend the millions of Angelos or the billions of Fox.
</P>
<P>
   Syd Thrift, Baltimore's director of player personnel, is a
longtime close friend to Bowden and is pushing hard for him.
</P>
<P>
   When the Reds were in Los Angeles in late-July, Bowden spent
considerable time with Lasorda and kept telling anybody who would
listen, ``Tom Lasorda really loves the game, is good for the game,
is a good baseball man. I really love that guy.''
</P>
<P>
   Leaving Cincinnati would get Bowden out from under the
cumbersome and difficult task of building from scratch with limited
resources. That he has done so well in the 1990s by mostly taking
other teams' table scraps and leftovers is a credit to his
abilities.
</P>
<P>
   By going to rich markets, Bowden no longer would have to round
up a dozen players every spring who are coming off injuries and
trying to make comebacks . . . baseball's version of Rent-a-Wreck.
</P>
<P>
   He has had great reclamation success with players like Ron Gant,
Benito Santiago, Tony Fernandez, Kent Mercker, Mike Morgan, Kevin
Mitchell, Jeff Brantley, Pete Schourek and Pete Harnisch to name a
few. And there have been many failures _ four or five every spring
_ but that was his plan. Bring in a dozen each spring, throw 'em
all against a wall and if one or two stick, he is ahead of the
game.
</P>
<P>
   This year was different. Management ordered him to slice the
payroll from $38 million to $20 million to start the rebuilding
process aimed toward the new stadium in 2002.
</P>
<P>
   It is an agonizingly painful process and Bowden was frustrated
when he couldn't make a trade last week before the deadline,
forcing him to keep high-priced players like Barry Larkin, Reggie
Sanders, Willie Greene and Mike Remlinger.
</P>
<P>
   So The Grand Plan to get younger hit a stall. And how is the
plan progressing?
</P>
<P>
   Bowden and manager Jack McKeon took some hits recently when
infielder/outfielder Paul Konerko was sent to Triple-A
Indianapolis. Some said Konerko wasn't given a proper chance.
</P>
<P>
   To that, McKeon says, ``Just because you are young is not a
guarantee. You have to show something. It isn't just hitting
(Konerko was hitting below .200 when he was demoted). And he had 60
at-bats, playing nearly every day. It isn't just offense. Part of
it was that he didn't give us anything on defense. We put him at
third base and he didn't give us anything. We put him in the
outfield and he didn't give us anything. He doesn't run well,
either. We told him to go down to Indianapolis and play left field
every day and get himself straightened out,'' McKeon said. ``Hey,
we did that with Sean Casey and look what happened.''
</P>
<P>
   Casey was hitting .130 when he received his ticket to
Indianapolis. Since coming back he has blossomed, hitting .318 with
eight doubles since the All-Star break.
</P>
<P>
   Even with success like that, Bowden has to look down the road
and see if he wants to build with dimes and quarters or if he wants
to play with the monopoly money of Angelos or Fox.
</P>
<P>
   The guess here is that if Angelos or Fox come calling, Bowden
will be gone before the telephone receiver is back in the cradle.

 &HT;    Bengals' Scott pleads not guilty to traffic warrents
 &HT;    By Chick Ludwig
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   GEORGETOWN, Ky. _ Bengals wide receiver Darnay Scott has so many
positive things going for him right now that he won't let a brush
with the law spoil the 1998 season.
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who led the team in catches (54) and receiving yards
(797) in 1997, was arrested early Sunday, August 2, in Cincinnati
on several outstanding traffic warrants, including driving with
expired license plates on his military-style Hummer vehicle.
</P>
<P>
   Cincinnati attorney Kenneth L. Lawson entered a plea of not
guilty for Scott in Hamilton County Municipal Court. Scott faces a
Sept. 18 trial date. ``They're all minor misdemeanors,'' Lawson
said. ``Hopefully, we'll work everything out, so he can focus more
on the field than on the traffic violations.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott, who became a free agent at the end of the 1997 season,
signed a five-year, $15 million contract on Feb. 10 that included a
$3.5 million signing bonus, a salary of $1.3 million in 1998 and an
offseason workout bonus of $150,000 each year. It was a handsome
reward for the 1994 second-round draft pick after he piled up 3,317
yards (866, 821, 833 and 797) and 20 touchdowns in four seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Will the money spoil him or fuel him?
</P>
<P>
   ``It motivates me,'' he said, ``that they put their trust in me
to give me all that. It shows that they want me here. Now I have to
step up to the plate. I'm no goal-setter or nothing like that. I
just want to get out there and play, compete with the best, take
care of business and just be happy.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel like I'm doing good. I added some strength in the
offseason. Now I've got my wind and I'm catching the ball pretty
good. I feel like I'm a step quicker than what I was.''
</P>
<P>
   Scott sustained a slight hamstring pull early in training camp,
but fought through it and is running well again. A classic
stretch-the-defense speed receiver, he's the perfect complement to
Carl Pickens, who is known for his toughness at the line of
scrimmage in bump-and-run coverage.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm here to play ball and get (legal problems) taken care
of,'' Scott said. ``The arrest . . . that's not in my mind. I've
got two weeks of camp to go and I just want to get ready to play.
I'm trying to go out there and hold onto my job. And that's that.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, everybody's motivated. Everybody's making the young
guys feel comfortable around the locker room and helping each other
out on the field. That's the way we've got to go for us to be
successful.
</P>
<P>
   DARNAY SCOTT --Age: 26. --Position: Wide Receiver. --College:
San Diego State. --Ht./Wt.: 6-1, 205. --Highlights: Led Bengals in
catches (54) and receiving yards (797) in '97. Averaged 105.8 yards
a game the final 4 games. His 77-yard TD from Boomer Esiason vs.
Baltimore on Dec. 21 was team's longest pass play of '97. Enters
5th season with 59 starts in 64 games. Darnay Scott was arrested
early Sunday on several outstanding traffic warrants. The
fifth-year receiver led the Bengals in catches and receiving yards
last season

MEXICAN CITY RESTRICTS WATER USE DUE TO DROUGHT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By PHILIP TRUE  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   MONTERREY, Mexico _ In what is being called the driest year this
century, the water provider in Mexico's third-largest metropolitan
area has imposed emergency conservation measures as city dwellers
compete with farmers for dwindling water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   Water will be shut off from 10 p.m. to 4 a.m. ``until it starts
raining again,'' said Elizabeth Cerda Andrade, a manager at the
water company in metropolitan Monterrey, an area of 3.5 million
people in northeastern Mexico. The water supplier _ Servicios de
Agua y Drenaje _ is a quasi-governmental agency that serves the
state of Nuevo Leon.
</P>
<P>
   ``On Friday the director made the decision to cut back ... so
that until it starts raining again, we will have water,'' Cerda
said.
</P>
<P>
   Meteorologists predict that more normal rainfall will begin this
month and in September, the height of the hurricane season in the
Gulf of Mexico.
</P>
<P>
   The water supply is a contentious issue between the neighboring
states of Nuevo Leon and Tamaulipas. Three dams provide drinking
water to Monterrey and a healthy chunk of irrigation water to farms
in Tamaulipas. But the dams are at no more than one-third capacity,
officials say, straining demands for rural irrigation and urban
water supplies.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, water company director Jesus Hinojosa Tijerina told a
Monterrey newspaper that unless significant rains fall within the
next couple of months, ``There is no possibility that we can send
them water.''
</P>
<P>
   Relatively wealthy Nuevo Leon residents resent sending their
drinking water to Tamaulipas cornfields, said Julian Jara Aguilar,
a Monterrey city councilman.
</P>
<P>
   ``We of course feel that the water should go to human
necessity,'' Jara said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Clearly, if you don't irrigate fields, your corn won't grow.
But this water comes from rivers that rise in Nuevo Leon,'' he
said. ``If they wanted it to drink, that would be OK, but while we
are thirsty, they shouldn't be irrigating.''
</P>
<P>
   There were questions raised about the fairness of the
conservation measures.
</P>
<P>
   Cerda said water supplying 99 percent of the consumers in the
Monterrey area is shut off at 10 p.m., without exception.
</P>
<P>
   But Jara said only poor neighborhoods were doing without water,
while the ``water flows all night'' in wealthy neighborhoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a saying in Spanish that it is the skinny dog that
gets the fleas,'' Jara said.
</P>
<P>
   Cerda responded that wealthy homes usually have cisterns that
can store large amounts of water. Poor residents usually only have
small tanks and so must go without water when their tanks run dry.

THE CURRENT RIVER: MAY IT EVER REMAIN A MASTERWORK 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By C.W. GUSEWELLE  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   ON THE CURRENT RIVER _ The 6 a.m. fog lies in every cleft of the
hills. Hanging low against the water, it flows like spun sugar
along the valley carved by this glorious stream.
</P>
<P>
   The Ozark highlands are laced with enough quick rivers to fill a
canoeist's dreams. There are the Elk, the Sac, the Gasconade, the
Meramec and the Bourbeuse.
</P>
<P>
   Not to mention the Eleven Point, the Jacks Fork, the White and
the Black, the North Fork and the Piney, the Caddo, the Strawberry,
the Little Red and the Petit Jean.
</P>
<P>
   Also, of course, the great Buffalo, the treacherous little
Mulberry, and too many others to name.
</P>
<P>
   Some are bigger, some more challenging. But there's none better
loved than this ribbon of bright water, transparent as air, bending
against sheer limestone bluffs that soar up 100 feet and more to
untrammeled forest of hardwood and pine.
</P>
<P>
   We are traveling this day by flat-bottomed johnboat, which,
because of its shallow draft, can skim over shoals that might stop
a canoe. Our companion is Alan Peters, a resort owner in the town
of Eminence. He shows us the likely spots for small-mouth bass, and
a deep pool where walleye school.
</P>
<P>
   The early morning sense of solitude is absolute. Kingfishers
dart and plunge. Herons rise at the margins and lift away on slow
wings. For the first hour, not another soul is seen.
</P>
<P>
   Finally we pass a man and a woman taking their breakfast coffee
on a gravel bar outside their tent, their canoe drawn up below them
on the bank.
</P>
<P>
   A bit later Alan slows the boat.
</P>
<P>
   ``Look!'' he says, pointing. ``There are the wild horses.''
</P>
<P>
   They're feral creatures, descendants of ones escaped from
woodland farms. Untamed and untouched, numbering two dozen or more
in several bands, they roam the area freely in all seasons.
</P>
<P>
   We watch until they move away out of the riverine meadow and
behind a screen of trees.
</P>
<P>
   After the creation of the Ozark National Scenic Riverways, the
Park Service announced a plan to remove the horses from the area,
claiming, among other things, that it was inhumane to let them fend
for themselves _ although they'd been doing exactly that quite
successfully, and the ones we saw appeared in fine condition.
</P>
<P>
   The locals were having none of it. They mounted a campaign that
forced the federals to back down and allowed the horses to continue
running free. The issue only typifies a more general resentment,
perhaps inevitable when the hand of Washington is felt in a region
of fiercely independent folk.
</P>
<P>
   The Scenic Riverways legislation cost people along these streams
a large measure of control over waters they'd historically
considered their own.
</P>
<P>
   And yet, considering mankind's capacity to spoil _ the
compulsion to subdivide, to light the world with winking neon, to
disfigure places of rare splendor with beer joints, rock shops and
corn dog stands _ the protected status has been providential.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, more people have been drawn to the area. But they would
have come in any event. And so would the worst sort of ungoverned
development.
</P>
<P>
   And sooner than might have been imagined, the wild beauty that
gives these rivers their priceless character would have been lost
not just to the Ozarkers but to everyone.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, passing down the Current at an early hour of a weekday
morning, with mist rising and the sun not yet quite up, you almost
can imagine that nature wrought this masterwork for your eyes
alone.
</P>
<P>
   That's how it has been since before the first native people
chipped their flint points in camps beside the water. That's how it
should be always.

 LIKE A `McDONALD'S GIRL' WITH THOSE FRIES?  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)   c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Looking for love in all the wrong places? Maybe you need to
spend more time under the Golden Arches.
</P>
<P>
   McDonald's is, after all, home not only to Big Macs and Happy
Meals, but also to that living, breathing American icon known as
the McDonald's Girl.
</P>
<P>
   Now she has her own song.
</P>
<P>
   ``(I Am in Love With the) McDonald's Girl'' is a sweet-as-Coke
tune with a happy ending, which means it wasn't recorded by, say,
Alanis Morissette. It's actually sung by the Blenders, four guys in
their late 20s who grew up in Fargo, N.D., and now live in
Minneapolis.
</P>
<P>
   Known primarily as an a cappella group, the Blenders have been
together eight years and undoubtedly deserve a break today.
``McDonald's Girl,'' released as a single and getting some radio
play, could be it.
</P>
<P>
   The song is cute and funny _ not unlike, we suspect, a whole lot
of McDonald's Girls. In it a fellow makes his way to Mickey D's
after softball practice, rehearsing the spiel he'll deliver at the
counter: ``I'd like an order of fries, a Quarter Pounder with
Cheese, I love the light in your eyes, will you go out with me
please?''
</P>
<P>
   How's that for a pickup line?
</P>
<P>
   The chorus:
</P>
<P>
   I am in love with a McDonald's girl
</P>
<P>
   She has a smile of innocence so tender and warm
</P>
<P>
   I am in love with a McDonald's girl
</P>
<P>
   She is an angel in a polyester uniform.
</P>
<P>
   That ``tender and warm'' smile? Just part of the deal at
McDonald's, says Alisha Fuller, 18, who works at a location in
Kansas City, Mo. She's not surprised someone wrote a song about
McDonald's Girls.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have to be friendly to all customers, so when you come in
you see all that joy and happiness,'' Fuller says.
</P>
<P>
   And as far as customers hitting on her? It's happened.
</P>
<P>
   One day a truck pulled up to her drive-through window, and the
fellow behind the wheel informed her, ``Today's your lucky day!''
</P>
<P>
   Next thing Alisha knew, out of a bunch of guys in the back _
they looked like construction workers _ one popped out, ``just
cheesin','' and asked for her number.
</P>
<P>
   She gave it to him. Well, actually she gave him a bogus number
``because I didn't want to be mean.''
</P>
<P>
   You gotta love those McDonald's Girls.
</P>
<P>
   The song itself is older than many Mickey D's employees. It was
penned by singer-songwriter Dean Friedman, who hit the U.S. Top 40
with ``Ariel'' in 1977. It, too, had a fast-food angle: Dairy Queen
is where the free-spirited vegetarian Ariel dines on onion rings
and a pickle.
</P>
<P>
   Friedman, now 43, says there's never been a McDonald's Girl in
his life.
</P>
<P>
   ``Actually I had a crush on the Burger King girl, but it wasn't
quite as euphonious,'' he said by e-mail from London, where he's
promoting his new album, ``Songs for Grownups.''
</P>
<P>
   Friedman's recording of ``McDonald's Girl'' was released in 1982
and promptly banned by BBC radio in Europe because of its
commercialism: ``Apparently (the BBC) believed that ... millions of
people were going to go rushing down and gorge themselves on
hamburgers,'' Friedman says.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the ban, his record label _ CBS at the time _
dumped him. He has just now, 16 years later, returned to recording.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years the quirky Canadian pop-folk band Barenaked
Ladies has performed the tune at shows, and a Toronto radio station
made it a regional hit.
</P>
<P>
   Then this year the Blenders met ``McDonald's Girl.''
</P>
<P>
   ``This song really turned our heads,'' says Blender Darren Rust,
29. When a Universal Records A&AMP;R guy suggested it, ``I could
totally hear us doing that. It's something that we could have
written almost.''
</P>
<P>
   The Blenders' version, however, is not quite the same as the
original. Friedman's line, ``She's not ashamed to be the only other
virgin I know,'' was replaced with, ``I wanna say how I feel if I
could just let go.'' And the McDonald's Girl's age was upped from
15 to 16.
</P>
<P>
   Rust says the group ``didn't want to talk about virgins'' in the
song. Friedman wasn't happy about the change but went along with
it. ``Her virginity notwithstanding,'' Friedman says, the Blenders
did a terrific job.
</P>
<P>
   The company that employs McDonald's Girls agrees.
</P>
<P>
   ``The song sounds cute to us, pretty catchy, and clearly it's
all in good fun,'' says Julie Cleary, a spokeswoman for McDonald's
Corp. in Oak Brook, Ill.
</P>
<P>
   And how's the song doing?
</P>
<P>
   Hey, it's No. 1 in Norway!
</P>
<P>
   Stateside, however, not so well. Universal says the tune has
gotten some play on big-city stations, but often only on morning
shows, because it's perceived as a novelty song.
</P>
<P>
   Neal Angel, music director and DJ at K-JO 105 in St. Joseph,
Mo., says the first request he got for the song was from an actual
McDonald's Girl who wanted her fiance to hear it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everybody's been to McDonald's, and everybody may have had a
crush on a McDonald's chick at one time,'' Angel says. Plus the
subject matter makes for ``some good fun on the radio.''
</P>
<P>
   Typical DJ line: ``I love the way she salts my fries!''

 &HT;    CAMPAIGN DEFEAT ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF SETBACKS FOR GINGRICH
 &HT;    By MARK SHERMAN
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The only Georgia Republican to vote for campaign
finance reform Monday night does not have the pressing concern of a
tight re-election campaign to excuse his defiance of Speaker Newt
Gingrich and other party leaders.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nathan Deal is unopposed in his bid for a fourth term in
the House.
</P>
<P>
   For Deal, supporting changes in the system of financing
political campaigns is more important than party unity.
</P>
<P>
   ``It goes back to a fundamental theme we have to deal with here,
credibility,'' he said. ``I know there was a partisan push not to
give it as many votes as it got, but I felt it was important to
take a step in the right direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Deal was one of 51 Republicans who joined with Democrats in
support of a bipartisan bill that would ban the large unregulated
donations to political parties known as soft money, and also
regulate television and radio ads that pop up in the closing days
and weeks of campaigns without any information identifying their
sponsors.
</P>
<P>
   After months of trying to bury campaign finance reform and then
trying to kill it through endless delay, Republican leaders
effectively conceded defeat. ``They put enough handwriting on the
wall that you ...pretty well have to see it,'' House Majority
Leader Dick Armey said in grudging praise of the bill's authors.
</P>
<P>
   While Gingrich continues to talk about a large tax cut that the
House will take up in September, House members are about to embark
on a month-long break having kept alive the campaign finance reform
issue he hoped would go away and without taking up an bill to fight
teenage smoking Gingrich had promised.
</P>
<P>
   On the political front, Gingrich suffered the embarrassment of
backing a candidate in a southwest Georgia congressional primary,
only to see him lose. And Gingrich and Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., who
heads up the GOP's House campaign committee, are meeting resistance
in their attempt to get colleagues with little or no opposition to
pony up large sums from their campaign accounts to help keep their
House majority.
</P>
<P>
   None of this may qualify as the stinging rebuke to Gingrich's
leadership that editorial writers saw in the campaign finance
reform vote. After all, that bill may yet die in the Senate,
fulfilling Gingrich's desire.
</P>
<P>
   But it was another misstep in a month in which the House passage
of a bill to regulate managed health care qualifies as the
Republicans' one big success. That bill, however, may not survive
the Senate either.
</P>
<P>
   ``He misjudged the market for reform in his own party,'' said
Thomas Mann, a congressional expert at the Brookings Institution.
``But it's not just the speaker. It's the whole Republican
leadership that has no interest in changing the rules at a time
when they have a majority in the Congress and a natural
fund-raising advantage.''
</P>
<P>
   As his party's former chief vote counter in the House, Gingrich
knew he was on the losing side of campaign finance reform long
before he ventured onto the House floor Monday night to cast his
vote against the bill.
</P>
<P>
   But even as Democratic leader Dick Gephardt railed against
Republican leaders ``who stood with the power of big money and
against bipartisan change'' and Republican supporters talked about
credibility, Gingrich said nothing about the issue.
</P>
<P>
   Christina Martin, his spokeswoman, said Gingrich had allowed the
House ``to work its will.''
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a matter of channeling all the creative energies,''
Martin said.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich has had precious little to say in public recently,
other than his comments following the killing of two Capitol police
officers July 24. He has given lengthy interviews only to the
newspapers and magazine that cover Congress, tamping down
expectations that he intends to leave the House next year to mount
a campaign for president. ``I keep reminding all my closest friends
I may be speaker in 2002,'' Gingrich told Congressional Quarterly.
</P>
<P>
   The calculus that will help determine Gingrich's presidential
plans begins with the November elections and the Republicans'
ability to retain their majority in the House. If the Democrats
take control, Gingrich's chances _ however remote they seem now _
likely would diminish.
</P>
<P>
   But he has been more involved with the affairs of the House and
more receptive to input from his rank and file.
</P>
<P>
   Deal was one of several former Democrats whom Gingrich called in
the spring for advice about whether to crush debate on campaign
finance and suffer the inevitable criticism or open up the process
and take the risk that a bill might pass.
</P>
<P>
   ``To his credit, he decided to go ahead,'' Deal said. ``If he
wanted to close it down, he could have.''

EXPRETS ADVISE AGAINST CONFESSING AN AFFAIR 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 LEE HILL KAVANAUGH  
 c. 1998 The Kansas City Star  
<TEXT>
<P>
   To tell or not to tell; that is the question regarding an
extramarital affair.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington the issue is playing out at the highest level:
Former White House intern Monica Lewinsky reportedly says that she
and President Clinton had an affair and discussed keeping it a
secret; the president insists no such thing happened.
</P>
<P>
   For psychologist Joyce Brothers, the answer is simple. Don't
tell. Anyone. Ever.
</P>
<P>
   ``Why tell your spouse about an affair except to unburden your
own selfish guilt?'' Brothers said in a telephone interview from
New York City. The only people to whom one might consider
confessing an affair, she added, are a member of the clergy, a
therapist or perhaps a lawyer friend. ``On second thought,''
Brothers said, ``talk only to an attorney if you are his client.''
</P>
<P>
   But even if your lips don't tell a soul, she cautioned, your
cheatin' heart may.
</P>
<P>
   ``An affair throws up a huge wall between you and your spouse,''
Brothers said. ``You won't ever be totally relaxed around your
spouse again. You might avoid intimacy, or worse, you might divulge
the other person's name during sex.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've even had clients who feared surgery because they were
afraid they'd murmur the name of someone they didn't mean to.''
</P>
<P>
   End the affair and swallow your guilt. If you must unburden
yourself, unload the secret on a safe source. But don't tell your
friends.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you tell a friend, it will get out, simple as that,'' she
said. ``And if you're the friend confessed to, you have no right to
do anything about it. If you do, it's what's right for you, not
your friend. ... Of course, most friends wouldn't go running to the
independent counsel, either.''
</P>
<P>
   Friends are usually the first ears to hear about an affair, said
Fred Mayfield, a marriage and family therapist in Overland Park.
</P>
<P>
   ``But I tell people to not tell their friends,'' he said. ``Why
take the chance that your spouse will hear about it from someone
else?''
</P>
<P>
   A friend who feels strongly that adultery is a moral or ethical
transgression might feel the need to tell your spouse, he said.
Even if they didn't, it probably would come back around to your
spouse through the grapevine someday. That would be hurtful on two
counts: not only for the affair but also for the secrecy that is
now entwined in the relationship.
</P>
<P>
   ``Secrets are the major barrier to intimacy,'' Mayfield said.
``There's a healing quality to asking for forgiveness. ... What
hurts so deeply is the betrayal, the broken commitment. Most
affairs have little to do with sex and everything to do with not
dealing with a marriage.
</P>
<P>
   ``The offending spouse probably isn't dealing with the anger,
the fears or the emptiness and aloneness that he or she feels,'' he
said. ``The sex in an affair is pretty superficial.''
</P>
<P>
   Mayfield's motto for clients?
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not who you lie with, but who you lie to.''
</P>
<P>
   Lying about an affair may be distasteful but it's not illegal,
said David Achtenberg, a law professor at the University of
Missouri-Kansas City. Although Kansas and Missouri have laws on the
books condemning adultery as illegal, ``few prosecutors go after
adulterers,'' he said. ``Prosecutors have too many other crimes to
deal with.''
</P>
<P>
   Even lying under oath about an affair could be harmless, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``For a testimony to be perjury it must be three things,'' he
said. ``It must be a lie under oath, it must be an intentional lie
and not just a misunderstanding, and it must be a lie on a matter
that is material to the case.''
</P>
<P>
   It could be argued that President Clinton's testimony in the
Paula Jones case was immaterial, regardless of whether he lied,
Achtenberg added.
</P>
<P>
   ``The court dismissed the Jones case, so was it really relevant
to that case if he slept with Lewinsky? I think Clinton's lawyers
have a strong case that it was not.''

   ARMY-SECRETS _ WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Army ran its program for
visiting foreign military officers with such slipshod procedures
that foreign governments got access to American military secrets ,
newly released internal Defense Department documents reveal. ``This
situation poses a significant risk to the Army's current and future
combat capability,'' the Army's deputy chief of staff for
intelligence wrote last year to the Army's inspector general. The

   SHOOTINGS _ WASHINGTON _ Despite schoolhouse shootings that have

American Medical Association that while the decline in homicide
rates for adolescents and young adults declined in every

decline'' for black males between 15 and 24. (Nesmith, Cox News

KEMPER JOINS TEAM BIDDING FOR ROYALS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY CHARLES R.T. CRUMPLEY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ R. Crosby Kemper Jr.,
the banker who often steps into troubled civic efforts, will join
Miles Prentice's group that is attempting to buy the Kansas City
Royals.
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I told him I'd support him in his efforts and be an
investor,'' Kemper said Monday. ``I don't know to what extent yet,
because I've just decided to do it this morning.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemper _ who is not a baseball fan _ said he and his bank
company likely would invest up to $3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Kemper's involvement is significant because Prentice needs to
enlist big local names to join his group, and Kemper's name is
about as big and as local as they get.
</P>
<P>
   ``From a credibility standpoint, the Kemper name certainly gives
the Prentice group some oomph locally, both with the media and the
fans,'' said Kevin Gray, president of the Greater Kansas City
Sports Commission and Foundation.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice, a New York lawyer and owner of a minor league team,
could not be reached for comment Monday. His spokesman said
Prentice continues to meet with locally prominent people. He has
promised he would not identify his probable investors, at least for
now.
</P>
<P>
   But some names have dribbled out, such as Kemper's. Another is
James B. Nutter Jr., the 39-year-old son of James B. Nutter Sr.,
the prominent mortgage banker and political donor.
</P>
<P>
   James B. Nutter Jr. said Monday he would probably decide this
week whether to join the Prentice group.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I do get involved, it would be for the civic reason of
trying to keep the team in Kansas City'' Nutter said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think Miles is an awfully good guy. He's a baseball guy. I
think he would really be good for Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Former Kansas City Chiefs player Deron Cherry, now a Kansas City
beer distributor, said last month that he was considering joining
the Prentice group. But he has not returned telephone calls in the
last couple weeks.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice's main rival to buy to the Royals is a duo of Chiefs
owner Lamar Hunt and the Topeka utility company Western Resources
Inc. Tim Connolly, who is heading up the Hunt group's bid, offered
no comment Monday on the news about Kemper.
</P>
<P>
   Royals directors, who are choosing a new owner for the baseball
team, also had no comment, said their spokesman Rob Merritt of the
Barkley Evergreen &AMP; Partners public relations firm. The directors
hope to make a decision soon.
</P>
<P>
   The amount of the bids to buy the Royals have not been released,
but the Hunt group's bid is known to be significantly lower than
Prentice's.
</P>
<P>
   The Hunt group believes the Royals' asking price of $75 million
is too high for a baseball team that chronically loses money.
Moreover, the Hunt group is vexed by a couple of complicated tax
problems that arise from the way the group is structured.
</P>
<P>
   A third group that includes former Royals player George Brett is
considered a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice submitted what was described as the highest bid to buy
the ownerless baseball team. The problem was that Prentice's
investors _ who were never publicly identified _ were
out-of-towners. Royals President Mike Herman said in late June that
if Prentice wanted to buy the Royals, he needed to scoop up local
investors.
</P>
<P>
   Prentice returned from a family vacation last week and arrived
in Kansas City on Wednesday. Since then, he has been prospecting
for investors, usually starting with a breakfast meeting and
sometimes ending the day with meetings that start at 9:30 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's been working around the clock, meeting with Kansas
Citians,'' said Prentice's spokesman, Michael Grimaldi of Corporate
Communications Group.
</P>
<P>
   One person he impressed was Kemper, who is chairman and chief
executive officer of UMB Financial Corp., which owns UMB banks.
Kemper said he particularly liked Prentice's vow to make Kansas
City his primary home and send his children to school here, if his
bid for the Royals is successful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it would be wonderful to have somebody like him live
in Kansas City and be part of our community, and his wife, too,''
said Kemper. ``They'd be wonderful citizens of Kansas City.''
</P>
<P>
   Although baseball is not the kind of thing Kemper would normally
support, he said his son, R. Crosby Kemper III, known as Cris,
``really pushed me to do something.''
</P>
<P>
   Kemper, 71, said his son ``just adores baseball.'' Cris Kemper,
who is president of UMB Bank of St. Louis, led a 1993 petition
drive to replace artificial turf at Kauffman Stadium with natural
grass. The Royals made that switch after the 1994 season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not a great fan of baseball, but it's good for the town,
and I want to support it,'' the elder Kemper said. ``And I like
this guy (Prentice)...It would be wonderful to have somebody live
in Kansas City for a change and own the team. That's why I like
it.''

NEW AND NOTABLE BOOKS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE STEPHENSON  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   (UNDATED) _ A survey of recently published books:
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
 &UR; THE PIED PIPER &QL; 
 &UR; Ridley Pearson (Hyperion, $23.95)
</P>
<P>
   A serial kidnapper is working his way up the West Coast, using a
stun gun to subdue baby-sitters while he disappears with the
children in their care. Each time the police get close, he moves on
to a new city, leaving baffled authorities and grieving parents in
his wake. Now he has arrived in Seattle, where he steals a
4-month-old girl from her crib and leaves in the house his calling
card _ a dime-store penny flute like the ones found at all of the
other crime scenes, the reason for his FBI nickname ``the Pied
Piper.'' Pearson brings in Seattle cop Lou Boldt and psychiatrist
Daphne Mathews to solve this one, and introduces a large cast of
supporting characters that includes ambitious police Capt. Sheila
Hill, swaggering cop John LaMoia and a smooth FBI agent who wants
to freeze the police out of the investigation. The case is
complicated by the competition among the authorities and the fact
that several of the officers _ including Boldt himself _ have a
personal interest in seeing that the kidnapper gets away. This is a
good summer read. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE MAN WHO LOVED ONLY NUMBERS &QL; 
 &UR; Paul Hoffman (Hyperion, $22.95)
</P>
<P>
   When Paul Erdos said someone had ``left,'' he meant the person
had died. When he said someone had ``died,'' he meant that person
had stopped doing mathematics. Erdos had no wife or children, no
job, no hobbies, no home. He traveled constantly, visiting one
colleague after another to discuss problems and complete proofs. He
lived out of a ratty suitcase and plastic bag from a department
store in Budapest. During the last 25 years of his life (he
``left'' in 1996), he did mathematics 19 hours each day, fortifying
himself with amphetamines, strong espresso and caffeine tablets. He
had been a prodigy _ at age 3, he could multiply three-digit
numbers in his head _ and grew into a charming and vastly eccentric
man, a genius who was devoted to the beauty and transcendence of
numbers. This book is not a conventional biography because Erdos
did not have a conventional life. Instead, it is a look at a man
and his passion for numbers, which he believed were a glorious
combination of science and art. ``In mathematics,'' Hoffman says,
``madness often comes with the territory.'' In Erdos, that madness
was beguiling, indeed. Hoffman is a science journalist and
publisher of Encyclopaedia Britannica. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; FINAL VINYL DAYS &QL; 
 &UR; Jill McCorkle (Algonquin, $18.95)
</P>
<P>
   As Southern fiction goes, Jill McCorkle is a practitioner of the
sassy variety, the kind that sounds like gossip offered over a back
fence in the afternoon or by someone who is cutting your hair. Of
the nine stories here, the chat is thickest in those written in the
first person _ ``Life Prerecorded,'' for instance, a funny tale of
a woman who is pregnant and yearning for a cigarette, or ``It's a
Funeral! RSVP,'' narrated by a woman who ``throws'' services for
people who haven't died yet. In ``Last Request,'' a woman squirms
over a promise demanded of her by her mother on her deathbed, and
in ``Your Husband Is Cheating on Us,'' a man's mistress confronts
his wife with the news that there is now a third, younger, woman to
contend with (``Here he has us, two perfectly good-hearted,
good-looking women, and he falls for (itals) that?''). It's all
great fun, from the author of ``Ferris Beach'' and ``Carolina
Moon.'' &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE DIVING BELL AND THE BUTTERFLY &QL; 
 &UR; Jean-Dominique Bauby (Vintage, $11)
</P>
<P>
   New in paperback is this memoir by a former editor of French
``Elle'' of his year with ``locked-in syndrome,'' a condition of
virtually total paralysis after a massive stroke Bauby suffered in
1995, when he was 43. With his undiminished intellect imprisoned in
a useless body, he managed to dictate this lovely, moving and
remarkably life-affirming book by blinking his left eye. Bauby was
also the subject of a documentary film by Jean-Jacques Beineix
(best known in this country for ``Diva'' and ``Betty Blue''). Bauby
died in March 1996, two days after the triumphant publication of
this book in France. &QL; 
 &QL; 
 &UR; THE BLACK BOX &QL; 
 &UR; Edited by Malcolm MacPherson (Quill, $15)
</P>
<P>
   Do not read this book if you travel by air often, because every
takeoff from this day forward will be white-knuckle time for you.
Here are transcripts from the cockpit voice recorders of planes
that have run into trouble in the air. It is not as ghoulish as it
sounds. Many of these transcripts will leave you with respect for
the resourcefulness of the pilots, especially Capt. Al Haynes, who
in 1989 landed a plane that had lost all hydraulic function _ an
almost impossible thing to do. Some incidents ended well, as when a
determined captain and co-pilot managed to land American Airlines
Flight 1572 in Connecticut in 1995 despite potentially catastrophic
mechanical problems. But many of the flights here ended in tragedy.
Among them: USAir Flight 427, which crashed on its approach to
Pittsburgh in 1994; ValuJet Flight 592, which went down in an
Everglades swamp in 1996 after a fire erupted in the cargo hold;
and Aeroperu Flight 603, doomed by masking tape left over the
plane's static ports by a ground crew that washed the plane before
takeoff (the crew forgot to remove it, a mistake that meant the
pilots were flying blind _ the plane crashed into the ocean,
killing nine crew members and 61 passengers). &QL;

JONES STORES TO BE RESOLD 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 BY STEVE EVERLY  
 c. 1998 Kansas City Star   KANSAS CITY, Mo. _ Dillard's Inc.
reshuffled the area's retail scene Monday by saying it planned to
resell the area Jones stores to May Department Stores Co., a St.
Louis-based retailer.
<TEXT>
<P>
   May, which operates Famous-Barr, Lord &AMP; Taylor, Filene's,
Foley's and other stores, will acquire all the Jones stores _ the
six in the Kansas City area and the one in Topeka, Kan. The
purchase price was not disclosed.
</P>
<P>
   The Jones stores will fold into May's Famous-Barr division. But
May said the Jones name, which has been a fixture in the Kansas
City area for more than a century, will be retained.
</P>
<P>
   ``This gives us a strong, first-time presence,'' said Gene Kahn,
May's president and chief executive officer.
</P>
<P>
   May hopes to complete the Jones stores purchase no later than
Sept. 4. It said that after the purchase was completed, it would
close the Jones stores for a short time before reopening them.
</P>
<P>
   Reaction among shoppers was enthusiastic Monday. The Jones Store
Co. had developed a following with numerous promotions, such as its
Moonlight Madness sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is just wonderful,'' said Pat Wheeler, who was
shopping at a Jones store. She said that she has shopped at
Famous-Barr, and that Jones and May had similar promotions and
merchandise.
</P>
<P>
   May said it would offer jobs to all executives and employees
working in the Jones stores themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Helen Weiss, a divisional vice president for public relations at
Famous-Barr, said some offices at shopping centers that handled
buying and administrative tasks were not purchased. In addition,
only some of the Jones warehouse and distribution system will be
absorbed.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement removes much of the uncertainty that has
hovered over Jones for three months since Dillard's said it would
purchase Mercantile Stores Co. Inc., the parent company of Jones
and other stores.
</P>
<P>
   Dillard's had said it would swap or sell about 25 percent of the
more than 100 Mercantile stores it was acquiring in markets where
the two retailers overlapped.
</P>
<P>
   However, the retailer didn't disclose which stores would be
involved.
</P>
<P>
   A Dillard's executive said Monday that the retailer originally
intended not to sell or swap any of the Jones stores. But other
retailers quickly indicated a strong interest in them, and
Dillard's changed its mind.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, potential bidders made it clear they were
interested in all the Jones stores, not just some of them.
Proffitt's Inc. made a bid, but May ``made us an offer we couldn't
refuse,'' said Paul Schroeder, vice president and general counsel
for Dillard's.
</P>
<P>
   In related announcements Monday, May said it would acquire four
other Mercantile stores in Colorado, Indiana and Kentucky. And
Proffitt's agreed to acquire 15 Mercantile stores, including
locations in Orlando, Fla., and Nashville, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Together with seven Mercantile stores that Dillard's previously
said it would swap with Belk Inc. in the southeast United States,
that brings to 33 the number of Mercantile stores it will sell or
swap.
</P>
<P>
   Little Rock, Ark.-based Dillard's has been waiting for word from
the Federal Trade Commission over any antitrust problems with the
Mercantile purchase. Most observers have said any such concerns
have likely been erased by Dillard's willingness to sell or swap
stores.
</P>
<P>
   Schroeder said Dillard's is now hoping to close on the
Mercantile purchase late this week or early next week.
</P>
<P>
   In joining May, the Jones stores will become part of a chain
that now has 370 stores in 30 states and Washington D.C. Sales in
1997 were $12.7 billion. It has 116,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   The company was founded by David May, who at the age of 15
arrived in New York from Germany. The year was 1863. After an
unsuccessful attempt at mining, he opened a clothing store in
Leadville, Colo., in 1877. In 1892, he purchased the Famous stores
and 13 years later moved his company's headquarters to St. Louis.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, the company picked up various acquisitions such
as Kaufmann's in Pittsburgh in 1946.
</P>
<P>
   In the late 1970s, May's company started the Venture discount
store chain, which it later spun off. Venture filed for bankruptcy
this year and went out of business. May Department Stores also
hatched what is now Payless ShoeSource of Topeka, which was also
spun off.
</P>
<P>
   An irony of Dillard's selling the stores to May is that the two
companies are tough competitors in other cities and that Dillard's
has brought that competition to the Kansas City area.
</P>
<P>
   ``This brings a new player and a very professional one to the
marketplace; it's going to be interesting to watch,'' said Jerry
White, a developer with Copaken White &AMP; Blitt, which operates
several area shopping centers.
</P>
<P>
   Stephen Latz, an analyst for A.G. Edwards in St. Louis, said
that even though the Jones stores are being put into the
Famous-Barr division, shoppers should expect only gradual change.
</P>
<P>
   He said May is retaining the Jones name because it sees value in
it and doesn't want to do anything to offend Jones shoppers.
</P>
<P>
   ``This (acquisition) is a positive for both the stores'
employees and shoppers,'' Latz said.
</P>
<P>
   Jones is known for being very promotional, and Famous-Barr is
promising to be active as well.
</P>
<P>
   ``We will be aggressive,'' said Weiss, the Famous-Barr vice
president.
</P>
<P>
   Shoppers can also expect that some product lines will be beefed
up. In particular, May is known for its private brands, Latz said.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculation arose Monday that the Jones store name would
eventually be dropped. May Department Stores purchased a small
chain in Ohio and did just that after several years. But in another
instance, the Ayers chain in Indianapolis, the stores still carry
that name.
</P>
<P>
   Weiss said that Famous-Barr also recognizes that shoppers are
used to the Jones stores, and that's one reason they're buying
them.

IRL, N.H. SPEEDWAY TAKE SEPARATE ROADS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MICHAEL VEGA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   After enduring sagging attendance and considerable revenue
losses, New Hampshire International Speedway owner Bob Bahre
confirmed Tuesday that he and the fledgling Indy Racing League had
agreed to part ways after their three-year contract expired June
28.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just pleased that it's over, because it wasn't going to go
anywhere,'' Bahre said. ``So we both felt it was the best thing to
end this thing.''
</P>
<P>
   After drawing fewer than 55,000 fans, combined, for four CART
races at NHIS from 1992-95, Bahre had hoped the fledgling IRL
series _ founded by Indianapolis Motor Speedway president Tony
George _ would bolster attendance at open-wheel events. But that
has not been the case. Attendance for IRL events steadily declined:
from 24,000 two years ago to 22,000 last year to 20,000 for this
year's New England 200, the final IRL race at NHIS.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's nobody's fault,'' Bahre said. ``We made a decision to go
with Tony and it was a mistake. I think Tony had the right idea _
to build the cars so he could control the costs. But I think the
only place that the IRL is ever going to work is Indianapolis.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked if open-wheel racing could ever succeed in New England,
Bahre said, ``I think it can go again, only if those two (CART and
IRL) get together again. But it's never going to be Winston Cup. I
think (NASCAR president) Bill France has spoiled all of us all over
the country, because Winston Cup racing is so magical right now.''
</P>
<P>
   Before the IRL's final visit to the track, Bahre estimated that
he'd lose as much as $700,000 by staging an unsponsored race.
</P>
<P>
   ``Originally, when we went with him we were going to get a
sponsorship for the three years of our contract,'' Bahre said. ``It
wasn't anything in black and white, but it was a handshake deal. It
was something that got us to go with him. We were either the first
or second (track) to go with him, too. But we were going to get a
sponsorship and we didn't get it.''
</P>
<P>
   And that, apparently, hastened Bahre's decision not to seek an
extension with the IRL.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tony said he was going to do something and didn't,'' Bahre
said. ``I'm not knocking him, because he's a good guy. But he
didn't do what he said he was going to do. Sponsorship was hard to
get with the IRL. I really think Tony should concentrate on running
his racetrack and leave the sanctioning to someone else.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's already talking about having a Formula One race at Indy,
so what would that make the Indy 500 _ the No. 3 race there? I just
feel he's making a mistake, but that's my own opinion.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked how he planned to fill the vacant date on his calendar,
Bahre said, ``I don't know. I haven't really thought about it yet.
I'm just relieved to get this behind us.''

BAILEY WHITE'S LATEST WORK TAKES NOVEL APPROACH 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 
QUITE A YEAR FOR PLUMS 
Bailey White (Alfred A. Knopf, $22) 
 
 By AMY CARLILE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Bailey White for years has been one of my favorite National
Public Radio commentators. She's famous for rich, detailed essays
told in her gravelly Southern tongue. As work days have lengthened,
it's been harder to catch her regular contributions to ``All Things
Considered'' during the drive home.
</P>
<P>
   But recently, I scored. There she was, talking about her newest
work _ ``Quite a Year for Plums.'' The news here was not that White
had penned a third collection of short stories about quirky people
and events in the South, but that this latest book is a novel. Her
first.
</P>
<P>
   Having just read the book, I had to disagree.
</P>
<P>
   And, ironically, White sounded unsure of the novelist label
herself as she was questioned on the show.
</P>
<P>
   Make no mistake, ``Quite a Year for Plums'' is classic Bailey
White, right down to the Betty Sheffield camellias. But this isn't
a novel. It's more a loosely linked collection of stories about a
year in the life of a community of sweet Southerners.
</P>
<P>
   What this book lacks in terms of a beginning, middle or end is
made up for in the way the reader is urged to peek through what
must be lace-covered windows to eavesdrop about life, death, flora
and fauna.
</P>
<P>
   In a soft, simple way, White eases readers into her tales by
introducing all of her characters in a list at the beginning of the
book.
</P>
<P>
   We learn of Roger, a plant pathologist who specializes in peanut
diseases; Della, a wildlife artist Roger falls in love with at the
dump because he likes the way she throws things away (neatly
arranged _ with a note about its condition attached); and Hilma and
Meade, best-friend retired schoolteachers who serve as the group's
hostesses.
</P>
<P>
   There are 14 characters in all, but Roger and Della and their
unrealized relationship seem to be what White tries to use to pull
the book together. That doesn't work. Each chapter stands as an
individual story about this small group of people, and although she
moves readers along, White's focus never reaches the level of a
novel.
</P>
<P>
   That's not bad, but White's fans should be aware that what this
book offers is a collection of her classic, rich stories involving
any number of the characters.
</P>
<P>
   These chapters could be read in any order and stand alone as
perfect vignettes.
</P>
<P>
   The author has outdone herself in researching the plants and
animals her characters encounter. Between discussions of tomato
spotted wilt virus, nematode-resistant okra, red-cockaded
woodpeckers, Dominique chickens and longleaf pines, you should be
able to smell the wet heat and heavy perfume of White's native
southern Georgia landscape. I only wish the view out my window was
of her moonvine. &QL;

FEE THAT FUNDS SCHOOL INTERNET ACCESS IS ILLEGAL, LAWMAKERS SAY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Key Republicans urged Congress Tuesday to repeal a
government fee levied on phone companies that currently funds a
program to lower Internet access costs for schools and libraries.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. W.J. ``Billy'' Tauzin, R-La., who heads the House
telecommunications subcommittee, said the fee, which the Federal
Communications Commission charges the companies, amounts to a tax
and that under the Constitution only Congress has the power to levy
taxes.
</P>
<P>
   ``The FCC has made a legal mess,'' Tauzin told the House
subcommittee on oversight.
</P>
<P>
   He said the FCC had misinterpreted a provision in the 1996
telecommunications law that gave schools and libraries access the
Internet at a reduced cost, the so-called ``e-rate.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the agency took it upon itself to levy a fee to cover
the e-rate and that many of the phone companies are passing the fee
along to their customers, many of whom are getting nothing in
return. That makes the fee a tax, Tauzin said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Nancy Johnson, R-Conn., who heads the oversight
subcommittee, said, ``It is disturbing that the FCC should try to
make this determination'' to levy the charge.
</P>
<P>
   A suit on the constitutionality of the charge is pending in the
U.S. 5th Circuit Court of Appeals, and a ruling is expected this
fall, according to Ken Johnson, a spokesman for Tauzin.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Jerry Weller, R-Ill., a member of the oversight panel, also
criticized the agency's move. ``The FCC is not created as an agency
to dole out block grants,'' Weller said. ``The FCC was put in place
to regulate telecommunications.''
</P>
<P>
   But FCC General Counsel Christopher Wright denied that the
agency had overstepped the law. Wright told the panel that the
commission believes its action ``is fully consistent with the terms
of the statute and does not constitute an unconstitutional

</P>
<P>
   By providing discounted services for schools and libraries and
wiring classrooms, the FCC is staying within the limits of the law,
he added.
</P>
<P>
   Tauzin said the e-rate program _ which has already received
requests from over 100,000 schools _ could be continued if Congess
passes a bill he introduced with Weller earlier this year. The
measure would abolish the FCC fee and fund the program with
telephone excise taxes already in place.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a plan that is win-win for all,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The current excise tax, which all telephone users pay, raises
about $5 billion a year for the government. The new bill would
collect about $1.7 billion of the tax for the e-rate program,
distributing the money to states as block grants.
</P>
<P>
   The measure would eliminate the rest of the tax, relying on the
expected budget surplus to make up the Treasury Department's lost
funds, Tauzin said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The legislation effectively kills two birds with one stone''
by preserving the Internet access program and cutting the telephone
tax, Weller said.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Ore., opposed the measure, saying it
would not provide the e-rate program with as much money as the fee
does.
</P>
<P>
   ``We must not hold our kids hostage to inter-governmental
disputes,'' he testified. ``They need this technology today.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tauzin-Weller measure is expected to go to the floor this
fall, according to Johnson.

   NATIONAL FORECAST &QL;
</P>
<P>
   On Tuesday, clouds and showers held the mercury in Dallas,
Texas, below 100 degrees, ending the string of consecutive days
with the mercury reaching 100 or above at 29. The catalyst for
thwarting the heat wave was a cold front pressing east across
Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, this front will make only slow progress across
northern Texas. Clusters of showers and thunderstorms will provide
much needed rain to places that received little or no precipitation
in July and the first few days of August. For the second day in a
row, the temperature will fail to reach 100 degrees in Dallas.
</P>
<P>
   Another disturbance will sponsor showers and storms across parts
of Colorado and New Mexico. Some downpours are likely. Meanwhile,
isolated thunder will erupt over the higher terrain of the Pacific
Northwest, as a cold front limps eastward. Most valleys will
receive no rain, given that air in the low-levels of the atmosphere
is very dry. The remainder of the West will be sunny and hot.
</P>
<P>
   Low pressure in the Midwest will spawn batches of showers and
thunderstorms near the Great Lakes. A conveyor belt of moist air
will draw clouds and patchy showers westward toward the upper
Plains. Meanwhile, scattered thunder will form ahead of a cold
front approaching the middle Mississippi valley.
</P>
<P>
   In the East, a weak low will prompt scattered thundershowers
near the Carolina coast, while other storms percolate in the sultry
air covering Florida. The rest of the East will be partly to mostly
sunny and mainly dry, though an isolated shower is possible in the
northern Appalachians. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Focus: Broken Streak
</P>
<P>
   After 29 consecutive days with temperatures reaching triple
digits, Dallas' streak ended Tuesday. From the standpoint of human
suffering and misery, the toll from the relentless heat was high.
From a strictly statistical perspective, the heat wave, though
extremely long, was unspectacular on a day-by-day basis. During
July, only one daytime record was broken at Dallas' 110 degrees on
the 12th. The high of 105 degrees on July 31 only tied the date's
record. Moreover, with the average daily high between 96 and 98
degrees, most triple-digit days were only 4 to 6 degrees above
normal. &QL;

 &HT;    Music concert not hoping to be the biggest, but a ``better
schmoozefest''
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Does the world really need another music conference?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every music conference I've actually had a band play in, I've
had a miserable experience,'' says Mark Willis, an Atlanta-based
promoter who hopes to learn from those experiences this week. As
one of three partners launching the Atlantis '98 Music Conference _
the inaugural event begins today _ Willis intends to improve on the
formula behind such annual rock-a-thons as South by Southwest in
Austin, Texas, and the CMJ New Music Showcase in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to build a better schmoozefest: one that bands, fans
and industry types can enjoy without complaint. ``We're not trying
to be the biggest, we're not trying to use more venues than other
conferences,'' he says. ``We want to do one thing really well, and
that's the music.''
</P>
<P>
   The event will stage performances by 170 bands _ including about
70 from Atlanta _ at 11 venues, mostly around Virginia-Highland and
Little Five Points. It also includes recording industry parties and
20-plus panel discussions. Topics range from the ironic (''Music
Conferences: Are We Ripping You Off?'') to the practical, such as a
how-to session with members of the popular college-rock band Sister
Hazel and its management team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a rolling four-day party,'' says Willis,
who is producing the conference with partners Rich Levy, a talent
buyer for concert promoters Cellar Door in Atlanta, and
entertainment lawyer Lee B. Reitchman. ``We wanted to be the
platform for discovery. Atlanta's venues, and the way Little Five
Points and Virginia-Highland are laid out, make it the perfect area
to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Confabs such as Atlantis '98 are designed as a way for music
acts, typically unsigned to a label or looking for a new deal, to
showcase their songs for producers, promoters and
artist-and-repertory representatives. Clubgoers can reap benefits,
because stages feature several bands in a night. Purchase of a $25
three-day pass means fans can hit as many participating venues _
such as the Dark Horse Tavern or Variety Playhouse _ as they can
fit into their evening. Willis hopes to attract 15,000 to 20,000
people over the course of the event, which kicks off today with a
golf tournament at Chateau Elan. (A schedule is listed at the
event's Web site: http://www.atlantismusic.com)
</P>
<P>
   ``Not every band can be accepted to South by Southwest.
(Atlantis) allows you to witness a lot of unsigned bands and a lot
of talent in that region of the country that you may not normally
have a chance to see,'' says Mike Faley, president of Metal Blade
Records in Simi Valley, Calif., whose acts have included the early
Goo Goo Dolls and Cannibal Corpse. ``You're coming down hoping to
find that diamond in the rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Even bands that have established a career can use the potential
boost the conference offers. ``We're fishing for bigger fish,''
says Joy Waters, bassist for the Atlanta band Seely, which performs
Thursday at the Purgatory room in Masquerade, a popular rock venue
on North Avenue. The group, which has released two CDs on the
British label Too Pure!, has freed itself from its contract and
would like to sign with a new label.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great things have come out of these for us,'' Waters said.
``But it's not fun. It's never fun. I never felt like people are
there to be into it. They're there to take notes. It's a
scratching-the-goatee kind of audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it all depends on which side of the stage you're on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare that you get (the industry) to focus on music of
city,'' says Harvey Schwartz, an A&AMP;R representative for Capricorn
Records. ``Atlanta has proven to be a vital musical city. It's a
good thing. There's a huge music community and they will come out
and do their thing.''

 &HT;    Ear implant helps girl hear and talk
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Sweat is pretty proud of herself. She can talk.
</P>
<P>
   Most children take speaking for granted. But 7-year-old
Elizabeth was diagnosed shortly after birth with a profound hearing
impairment.
</P>
<P>
   She can hear now because she has had surgery to install a
``cochlear implant.'' The operation, which can cost more than
$25,000, involves inserting electrodes into the cochlea, or inner
ear.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, talking has been a challenge. Sound produced by
cochlear implants is not the same as the kind people with normal
hearing perceive.
</P>
<P>
   That's where an Atlanta institution called the Auditory
Education Center came in. When Elizabeth was 13 months old, her
parents enrolled her at the center, a nonprofit facility that
specializes in teaching hearing and speaking skills. It is one of
only five centers of its kind in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth tried various hearing aids before specialists and her
parents settled on the implant, which she received when she was 2.
</P>
<P>
   Now, during weekly visits to the center, Elizabeth practices
listening without reading lips or using other visual cues. Her
mother attends the sessions with her, so she can help her at home.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Elizabeth can talk as well as any other child her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``AEC is just so wonderful,'' she said. ``It teaches me I can
listen and speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all deaf people would say Elizabeth's experience is
wonderful. Many argue that cochlear implants and speech therapy are
unnatural intrusions into the deaf community's world of silence.
Implanting the devices in children _ a practice approved by the
federal government in 1990 _ draws particularly strong fire,
because kids can't make the decision for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose you could make every deaf child into a hearing child.
You would destroy deaf culture,'' said Harlan Lane, a distinguished
professor at Northeastern University in Boston and an advocate for
the deaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the deaf world, with rare exception, people are proud to be
deaf and have no desire to change.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is not unanimous, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time a person has a chance to hear, that's just a
wonderful opportunity they shouldn't want to turn down,'' said
Winnie Hargis, coordinator of the Georgia chapter of Self-Help for
Hard of Hearing People.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth's parents have no regrets about their daughter's
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family is a hearing family. Our world is a hearing
world,'' said Catherine Sweat. ``She would not be able to talk to
her cousins or her grandparents. She would be isolated from all of
those who love her.''
</P>
<P>
   The center likes to work with young children, says CEO Margaret
Harms, because there is a short window of opportunity to teach them
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a child doesn't learn to speak by the time they are 6 to 8
years old, they will not learn to speak well. They can, but it's
difficult to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The auditory center requires parents to conduct daily
``listening sessions'' at home, uninterrupted by outside
distractions, where the parent and child simply talk. The sessions
help children acquire language as naturally as possible, by
listening.
</P>
<P>
   Another requirement is that enrollees interact with hearing
children in school or preschool.
</P>
<P>
   The center works with adults as well as children, providing a
variety of services. For example, it sells hearing aids, phone
amplifying systems and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth won't be buying any of them. She is ready to graduate
from the center because she has learned to communicate with the
hearing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's almost no language to describe the experience,'' said
her therapist, Mary Ann Costin. ``She has truly become her own
person.''

 &HT;    Ear implant helps girl hear and talk
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Sweat is pretty proud of herself. She can talk.
</P>
<P>
   Most children take speaking for granted. But 7-year-old
Elizabeth was diagnosed shortly after birth with a profound hearing
impairment.
</P>
<P>
   She can hear now because she has had surgery to install a
``cochlear implant.'' The operation, which can cost more than
$25,000, involves inserting electrodes into the cochlea, or inner
ear.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, talking has been a challenge. Sound produced by
cochlear implants is not the same as the kind people with normal
hearing perceive.
</P>
<P>
   That's where an Atlanta institution called the Auditory
Education Center came in. When Elizabeth was 13 months old, her
parents enrolled her at the center, a nonprofit facility that
specializes in teaching hearing and speaking skills. It is one of
only five centers of its kind in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth tried various hearing aids before specialists and her
parents settled on the implant, which she received when she was 2.
</P>
<P>
   Now, during weekly visits to the center, Elizabeth practices
listening without reading lips or using other visual cues. Her
mother attends the sessions with her, so she can help her at home.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Elizabeth can talk as well as any other child her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``AEC is just so wonderful,'' she said. ``It teaches me I can
listen and speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all deaf people would say Elizabeth's experience is
wonderful. Many argue that cochlear implants and speech therapy are
unnatural intrusions into the deaf community's world of silence.
Implanting the devices in children _ a practice approved by the
federal government in 1990 _ draws particularly strong fire,
because kids can't make the decision for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose you could make every deaf child into a hearing child.
You would destroy deaf culture,'' said Harlan Lane, a distinguished
professor at Northeastern University in Boston and an advocate for
the deaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the deaf world, with rare exception, people are proud to be
deaf and have no desire to change.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is not unanimous, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time a person has a chance to hear, that's just a
wonderful opportunity they shouldn't want to turn down,'' said
Winnie Hargis, coordinator of the Georgia chapter of Self-Help for
Hard of Hearing People.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth's parents have no regrets about their daughter's
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family is a hearing family. Our world is a hearing
world,'' said Catherine Sweat. ``She would not be able to talk to
her cousins or her grandparents. She would be isolated from all of
those who love her.''
</P>
<P>
   The center likes to work with young children, says CEO Margaret
Harms, because there is a short window of opportunity to teach them
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a child doesn't learn to speak by the time they are 6 to 8

difficult to do it,'' she said.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Miss Jo wasn't in Normandy, but helped out
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a few letters taking me to task for my piece on ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' I'm glad to return to the war effort on the home
front.
</P>
<P>
   (One letter said the Marines weren't in the Normandy invasion,
contrary to what I wrote, and one said of the movie, ``It was just
a flick. Please do not dishonor those who were doing the job by
confusing reality with films.'')
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry about putting the Marines where they weren't. I guess
I thought they were everywhere. As for confusing reality, I thought
the opening scenes at Omaha Beach were real shots taken at the time
and borrowed by Steven Spielberg to give reality to the film. I've
since learned that's not so, either.
</P>
<P>
   Now on to the home front. Margaret Pearce wrote of the efforts
of my friend Jo Severinghaus, mentioned here awhile back as the
donor of white violets for my yard.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pearce told of Mrs. Severinghaus' World War II effort, which
I should have known about but somehow missed. When the young men of
the community went to war, Mrs. Severinghaus, called ``Miss Jo'' by
her young friends, launched a little newsletter to send to the
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   Her Sunday school class from Rock Chapel Methodist Church(Ga.)
would gather at her home once a month, clipping newspaper stories,
jokes and cartoons from magazines and pasting them on sheets, which
Miss Jo would get typed and ready for mailing. She supplied
pictures that she had taken of people and places the boys would
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was called ``Chips,'' and there was a special note to
the young man who suggested the name _ ``busy now in the Pacific on
one of the new flat-tops.'' Margaret enclosed a couple of copies of
``Chips,'' and it's easy to see why returning servicemen were so
grateful to Miss Jo and the girls who kept them informed about the
home front.
</P>
<P>
   A general statement of home news is this: ``Rock Chapel is still
the same old place ... count on that. There's a big empty space
over on the mountain (Stone Mountain, that is) where the rock has
been blasted out. And there's a a big empty space in our lives
where you all used to be, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rock and you have both gone to win the war, and we are
proud of it. We buy bonds and work the gardens and save grease for
munitions, and chunk the home fires to keep them burning. Sometime
you'll be coming back and we'll be here, not much changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The second sheet tells of highway changes, the opening of school
and how some pond owners were helping to beat meat rationing by
draining the water out and inviting the neighbors to pick up the
fish. One bass was said to be so big the boys put a periscope in
him and ``played submarine till the water got too low to float
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Copies of ``Chips'' are on file at the DeKalb Historical Society
outside of Atlanta. Of Miss Jo herself, Margaret wrote: ``She was
certainly an inspiration and earned a warm spot in a lot of hearts,
both at home and in the services.''
</P>
<P>
   Now back to the Marines: Cliff J. Judkins, a former Marine
officer, wrote that he would like for the Leathernecks to be able
to take credit for the victory at Normandy, ``but the truth is,
they were 9,000 miles away, destroying the Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``The U.S. Army, the British, the Free French and the
Canadians were responsible for the Victory on June 6, 1944, at
Normandy.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Fear of food a hazard of modern age
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 6: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Detroit _ What a welcome. Flight-weary at about 2 p.m., I
staggered into the hotel lobby, confirmation number at the ready.
``Hmmm,'' said the desk woman, ``I'm sorry, but we don't seem to
have a reservation for you. Could it be in someone else's name?''
</P>
<P>
   I was about to assert that I'm not in the habit of reserving
rooms in someone else's name when I was interrupted in mid-smirk by
the sound of moans coming from behind me. Looking around, I saw,
sprawled in a plush leather chair, a thin young man, early 30s,
wearing an expensive white shirt, dark pants and a pained
expression, eyes walled back in his head.
</P>
<P>
   He looked and sounded awful. The clerk was a bit uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Still trying to find my reservation (eventually, we decided to
just pretend I'd never made one and book, anew, one of the many
available rooms), she apologized for the delay and sheepishly
answered my query about the young man, who now was doubled over in
the chair, attended by an employee with an ice bucket and towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the last person I should be telling this,'' said the
clerk, noting that I'm a journalist, ``but he says he has food
poisoning.''
</P>
<P>
   Where did he eat? In the hotel restaurant, she said. Chicken
salad sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   I'll remember not to have that, I said, heading to my room,
wondering how long it would take to get professional help for the
man.
</P>
<P>
   And thinking about how complex the simple act of eating has
become, how fraught with concern, even as modern conveniences such
as refrigerators and freezers ostensibly have diminished that
concern. How incongruous that in 1998 food poisoning seems scarier
than it did a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   This fear, centering on contamination by unsanitary produce
harvesters and handlers _ and on bacteria in everything from
egg-based mayonnaise to seafood _ makes you understand that, for
many, food is like sex: not enjoyed with abandon anymore.
</P>
<P>
   We're all acutely aware of the potential dangers of eating. Many
diners these days see one of my favorites, sushi, as a kind of
Japanese roulette, consumed at your own risk. Similarly, whenever I
eat raw clams or oysters, other eaters shoot me looks that seem to
express two sentiments: ``You're a brave man'' and ``I pity the
fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, these foods, like steak tartare, were not seen as
risky eating. And in the 1980s I thought nothing of eating goat
roasted in the streets of Cairo, Egypt, or raw green salad in San
Salvador. I'd think twice about either these days.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, like so many other problems, food-related illnesses get
magnified by myriad media that spread the bad news _ and therefore,
fear _ around the world in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all perception; there are problems to be magnified.
People do get sick.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps our science and technology, capable of treating or
preventing horrific illnesses, have dazzled us so much, we've
gotten sloppy with the basic stuff: washing knives that cut meat or
fish before using them on other foods, throwing away food that
stays unrefrigerated too long. Practicing simple bathroom hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   As Lyn puts it, ``All the technology in the world can't compete
with a bar of soap.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time I saw the young man in the hotel lobby, he was
sweating profusely, mumbling unintelligibly. I don't know if he
really was food-poisoned, but I tell you this: No chicken salad
passed my lips in this town.

 &HT;    Where history breathes
 &HT;    By Alan Patureau
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the phenomenal movie ``Saving Private Ryan'' thrusting the
horror of war anew into the public mind, a trip to the recently
opened National Prisoner of War Museum becomes an even more
poignant experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt this is a brutal story; it's not Disney
World,'' says Fred Boyles, superintendent of the Andersonville(Ga.)
National Historic Site. ``But a lot of kids and adults are coming
here, as well as former POWs. They want to see the sacrifices some
Americans have made for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously Andersonville was a low-key attraction, an infamous
Civil War prison site, cemetery and historic village. But since the
nation's only POW museum opened April 9, crammed with artifacts,
photos, interactive videos and multimedia exhibits on all U.S.
wars, area visitation has doubled to almost 20,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Even the exterior of the 10,000-square-foot memorial sets a
foreboding mood. It looks like a bleak prison, with bars on windows
and dark towers where armed guards might stand. A courtyard
contains a stark brick wall and a jagged stream symbolizing
wretched Sweetwater Creek in the nearby Civil War camp where 12,920
Union prisoners died. Water _ a precious commodity to POWs through
the ages _ trickles through the hands of a sculptured prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight rooms, hundreds of images tell the story of
America's 800,000 POWs since 1776. You see examples of things all
prisoners shared _ pain and torture, fear and hunger, loneliness
and boredom, ingenuity, defiance, the rare escape.
</P>
<P>
   In one grim exhibit, guns from several wars jut out of the wall.
Cocking sounds are heard when a sensor detects a visitor entering
the room. A spotlight flashes, sirens scream and a video shows
American POWs.
</P>
<P>
   The floors are gray granite to suggest the hardness of prison
life, Boyles says. There are giant pictures of prisoners being
marched to captivity _ on one side in wintry Korea, on the other in
the blazing heat of the Bataan Death March. There's a re-creation
of an infamous bamboo ``tiger cage'' holding an anguished GI
prisoner in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on benches with their families, kids seem fascinated
watching a half-dozen screens showing action and interviews.
High-profile prisoners such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona and
Admiral James Stockdale (Ross Perot's running mate in 1992) tell of
being stripped, tortured and left in chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man, this is quite a show,'' said one visitor, Ken
Gallager of Silver Spring, Md., comparing the emotional impact with
the National Holocaust Museum in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet heroics of POWs can bring goose bumps. On one video,
two men explain the tap code devised for communication between
prisoners in Vietnam, with each letter of the alphabet assigned a
number of taps. Once when a pig pen was installed next door, they
sent tap messages by oinking like a pig, and their captors never
caught on.
</P>
<P>
   A defiantly amusing 1967 photo shows the captured crew of the
USS Pueblo _ each man with the middle finger extended on one hand.
They had convinced their captors this was a ``Hawaiian good luck
gesture'' and would enhance a propaganda picture.
</P>
<P>
   The Andersonville prison is one of many important pieces in this
mosaic. You see an original pine log from the Andersonville
stockade wall; a ``shebang'' or tent the prisoners fashioned from
blankets; a POW's flour sack uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Information: The POW museum, on Ga. 49 a mile north of
Andersonville village, is open 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m. daily except
Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Free. 912-924-0343.
</P>
<P>
   Other Andersonville attractions:
</P>
<P>
   -- Village of Andersonville: Contains the Drummer Boy Museum
with a diorama of the Civil War prison camp, train depot/welcome
center, antique shops and pioneer farm. Call 912-924-2558. The
down-home Andersonville Restaurant serves lunch daily. The annual
Andersonville Historic Fair is scheduled Oct. 3-4 with a Civil War
parade and battle re-enactments.
</P>
<P>
   -- National Historic Site and Cemetery: Near the POW Museum is
the 26-acre site of the Andersonville Civil War prison where up to
33,000 men were jammed. There's a reconstructed section of the log
wall, sentry towers and the ``dead line,'' a
</P>
<P>
   four-foot railing inside the wall, beyond which prisoners would
be shot. Nearby, the quiet cemetery punctuated with magnolia trees
is especially touching, with its sea of 12,920 gravestones only
inches apart. Now, veterans of all wars can be interred here. Same
hours as the POW Museum.
</P>
<P>
   PLAINS, GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   It's been 17 years since Jimmy Carter left the White House, and
tourists still trickle in to this almost movie-set village that the
39th president calls home. The National Park Service logged 55,000
visitors last year, about 150 per day. That's peanuts compared to
the 5,000 a day who often jammed the town while Carter was
president.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today ``the visitor experience is more enjoyable, there's
more to see,'' says park ranger Pat Recker of the Jimmy Carter
National Historic Site.
</P>
<P>
   The main attraction is the restored redbrick Plains High School,
which reopened on Oct. 1, 1996, Carter's 72nd birthday, as a
visitor center/museum showcasing Carter memorabilia. But it's not
just a hall of fame for ``Jimmy Who?'' _ it also tells the tale of
the small town that spawned him.
</P>
<P>
   As you approach the old school with its gleaming white columns,
you wonder what values Carter, class of '41, learned here that led
him to the presidency. And the $4 million investment has made it
easy to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the main entrance you get the first hint. Principal
Julia Coleman's office has been restored with 1930s phones and
office equipment, plus her prize bust of Shakespeare. ``Miss
Julia'' introduced country boy Carter to great books, art and
music. Her favorite exhortation is framed on the wall: ``We have to
be prepared for the outside world. In a country as great as ours,
any schoolboy, even one of ours, can grow up to be president of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, where the aroma of well-oiled wooden floors stirs
old-timers' memories, a typical classroom boasts rows of school
desks _ with holes for inkwells. No doubt Carter and his future
wife Rosalynn, class of '44 valedictorian, used some of these
graffiti-carved benches. And no wonder the windows were so tall;
there were no electric lights.
</P>
<P>
   Three rooms are filled with hundreds of photos and artifacts
from Carter's boyhood, professional life and busy post-presidency.
You'll see a bamboo broom used to sweep grassless yards. A photo of
Jimmy at 9, riding his colt Lady Lee. A scrapbook display of
students ``learning how to introduce a friend.'' A paddle used to
discipline students.
</P>
<P>
   There's Carter on a 1977 Time cover as the magazine's Man of the
Year. The oak podium friends built for his campaign. A dazzling
gift from Yasser Arafat _ a pearl sculpture of the Last Supper,
with the Palestinian leader's business card below. Maps and photos
from Carter's globe-trotting diplomatic missions and Habitat for
Humanity projects. And one of his fly-fishing rods.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the nostalgia, the museum doesn't hide that the school was
segregated until 1966. In a video Carter recalls his childhood
puzzlement that his pal and neighbor Milton Raven had to go to a
different school.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the 300-seat auditorium, a Carter documentary is shown,
narrated by Charles Kuralt. This is also where Miss Julia presided
over morning chapel, and the community gathered for special
occasions _ and still does: During the annual Plains Peanut
Festival, Sept. 24-26, the original folk play ``If These Sidewalks
Could Talk,'' by Kim Carter Fuller, Billy Carter's daughter, will
be staged here.
</P>
<P>
   The high school is open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily, free admission,
call 912-824-3413.
</P>
<P>
   Other Plains sights include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Old railroad depot: It became Carter's 1976 campaign
headquarters because, ``Frankly, it was the only available building
in town with a bathroom,'' says tour guide Jody Monts, 31, who
attended grade school with Amy Carter. The 110-year-old station was
spiffed up and reopened last fall with an exhibit on the 1976
campaign. Photos and memorabilia include a ``Grits and Fritz''
button and a Columbus newspaper with the banner headline ``Carter
Wins.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The Carter compound: Behind a 12-foot metal fence (it once
surrounded Richard Nixon's Key Biscayne, Fla., estate) you can
barely glimpse the 3,000-square-foot brick ranch house off Church
Street (U.S. 280) where the Carters live about two-thirds of the
time. A Secret Service sentry post and gate block the access
street, Woodland Drive. You're better off going back to the high
school and watching Carter narrate a video tour of the home.
</P>
<P>
   -- Maranatha Baptist Church: On ``suburban'' Buena Vista Road (a
half-mile from the depot), this is where Carter teaches Sunday
school about twice a month. The Park Service posts his schedule a
month in advance. For his 10 a.m. appearances, up to 600 visitors
jam the main sanctuary and several classrooms where TV monitors
carry his lectures.
</P>
<P>
   -- Billy Carter's service station: Closed and moldering, this
symbol of small-town culture was presided over by the rambunctious
first brother from 1972 to 1981. A nearby BP station now
overshadows it on Church Street near the depot.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tours and peanuts: Plain Peanuts Inc., a few doors down on
Main Street, sells peanuts and gives the only sightseeing tours of
Plains. Vans driven by gossipy, down-home guides leave 9 a.m.-5
p.m. daily; $5. 912-824-3462. At the high school, the National Park
Service offers a 45-minute audio tape for your self-guided tour (to
rent $1, for sale $5).
</P>
<P>
   -- Where to eat: Flash! There are now two eateries in town.
Plains Family Restaurant just opened on Church Street (in front of
the high school campus), serving three meals and buffets 6 a.m.-9
p.m. daily. Scarlett's Cafe &AMP; Gift Shop, on the quaint downtown
block of Main Street, sells sandwiches and Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   -- Where to stay: Plains Bed &AMP; Breakfast Inn, a Victorian
mansion and the town's only lodgings, has four antique-filled
rooms; $65. ``Earl and Lillian Carter lived there in 1924 when they

   AMERICUS, GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   Andersonville and Plains are long on history but short on
amenities. To the rescue of visitors taking a couple of days to
tour the area is the wondrous Windsor Hotel, a 61-room Victorian
castle with a mix of towers, turrets, verandas, wicker rockers,
palms, chandeliers, a three-story atrium and rambling hardwood
hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, this showplace was built in the heart of Americus
in 1892, at Lamar and Forsyth streets, and it's still flourishing
after a loving restoration in 1991. Room rates are reasonable, too
_ from $70 for a double room with 12-foot ceilings to $159 for the
Carter Presidential Suite.
</P>
<P>
   The former president has missed a treat by never staying in the
spacious circular suite occupying one floor of the hotel's tallest
tower. It boasts soaring windows, king-size bed, antique chifforobe
and chest, a divan, easy chairs, two coffee tables, flowers,
billiard-green carpet and classic tile bath.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Dining Room, also cheerfully Victorian, serves a
succulent crab claw with filet mignon or chicken breast. Floyd's
Pub is a lively bar for a town of 18,000. Call the hotel at
912-924-1555.
</P>
<P>
   Americus is a college town, with 2,800 students at Georgia
Southwestern State University. Habitat for Humanity is
headquartered here, offering daily tours of its surprisingly large
``back lot'' of factories and model houses. And a 1920s movie
palace, the 630-seat Rylander Theater, is being restored and will
reopen next summer.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   -- Getting there: Andersonville is 140 miles south of Atlanta
via I-75 to the Henderson exit, then west on Ga. 26 to Oglethorpe
and south on Ga. 49. You'll see ``Andersonville Trail'' signs.
Americus is 10 miles farther south on Ga. 49. Plains is 10 miles
southwest of Americus on U.S. 280.

WILLIAM BOWMAN SR., WAS CADDIE AT FIRST MASTERS TOURNAMENT; 89

<P>
   William R. Bowman Sr. knew how to make the best of a bad
situation. When the swimming hole he frequented became infested
with alligators, he sold the creatures for display at a hospital.
When the moonshine still he operated was displaced by Augusta
National Golf Course, he became the first caddie at the home of the
annual Masters tournament.
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bowman, who savored his front-row seat to golfing history,
died of respiratory failure Saturday in Carney Hospital in
Dorchester Mass. He was 89.
</P>
<P>
   He was born in Clarks Hill, S.C., and raised on the outskirts of
Augusta.
</P>
<P>
   Every year when he watched the Masters on TV, he remembered
Augusta National when it was the 365-acre Fruitlands Nursery. When
the players approached Rae's Creek at the 12th green, he remembered
it as the local swimming hole. ``We used to go swimming in the
water,'' he said in a story published in the Globe on Aug. 26,
1990. ``There were alligators in there. We'd sell the baby
alligators to the hospital. They had an aquarium and they'd put
them in there and let the kids see them.''
</P>
<P>
   Spectators at the Masters can buy a beer at a stand near the
15th and 16th greens. In the days of Prohibition, Mr. Bowman would
sell you a half-pint of moonshine for 25 cents. He operated a still
on the property for three years.
</P>
<P>
   ``I made a good living at it, '' he said. ``This was before they
took the woods down and I couldn't hide anymore. They built the
golf course and ran me off the property and out of a job.''
</P>
<P>
   When Augusta National opened in January 1932, Mr. Bowman was the
first caddie in line. ``The first bag that came out of the
clubhouse was Tommy Armour's,'' he said. ``That's the first man I
caddied for at Augusta National.''
</P>
<P>
   He was Ben Hogan's caddie during an early Masters tournament.
``He got in trouble on the 15th hole,'' Mr. Bowman recalled. ``I
told him he couldn't reach that green with a 4-iron. He went into
the pond right in front of it. Hogan always said, `I didn't listen
to you. I could have won that Masters.'''
</P>
<P>
   Mr. Bowman later moved to Boston and played regularly at the
golf course in Franklin Park. He was a laborer for American Barrel
Co. and also did construction.
</P>
<P>
   But every year, when the Masters was on TV, he became a caddie
again. His advice for the players? ``Do your scoring on the first
nine. On the back side, you're getting into Disney World.''
</P>
<P>
   He leaves three sons, William R. Jr. of Beverly, Mass., Warren
S. of Pawtucket, R.I., and Jeffrey M. of Santa Monica, Calif.; five
daughters, Sherry A., Gail B. and Phyllis M. Fallon, all of Boston,
Delilah E. of Temecula, Calif., Virginia Bowman Earl of Placentia,
Calif.; two grandchildren and two great-grandchildren.

   Eighteen people went straight to their files to respond to
Barbara Chamberlain's request for a brownie recipe that calls for a
can of Hershey's chocolate syrup.
</P>
<P>
   But Amy G. Weber of Lilburn, Georgia may have been the most
immediately motivated to respond _ she was eating one of those
brownies as she read Recipe Swap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the weirdest thing,'' said Weber, who credits her
mother, Ann D. Gage , with introducing her to the brownie more than
30 years ago. ``I had to call her right away and say they needed
that recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber likes the brownies best with nuts, but often omits them
when making a batch for her small children.
</P>
<P>
   At Christmastime, her mother makes them with a creme de menthe
layer, a variation noted by others responding to the request.

 &HT;    Seinfeld Speaks: The comedian on standup, his TV show, and
everything else
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you thought the world was finally safe from Seinfeld
... more Seinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld makes his first TV appearance _ not counting
``Seinfeld'' reruns _ since his NBC sitcom shut down last May when
HBO airs a live stand-up concert Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   His ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time: Live on Broadway'' (9
p.m. EDT) will be the last of 10 shows he'll perform, starting
tonight, at the Broadhurst Theater in New York. Seinfeld is
retiring material performed during the years he's become the
country's most successful funnyman. The Broadway show ends a
worldwide tour begun after the final ``Seinfeld'' episode, this
year's most-watched (and most-hyped) TV show. Proceeds from ticket
sales go to children's charities.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld talked Tuesday at a news conference in New York about
his past, present and future. Here's a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   Why haven't you taken a vacation? Stand-up for me is not work.
It's liberating. Putting on a weekly TV show is complicated and
demanding. Stand-up is the best way for me to feel free and
relaxed. I've been to beaches. I've been on boats. It's pleasant,
but it's not really fun.
</P>
<P>
   Any surprises in the Broadway performance? I would like to list
all the surprises so there are no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have a new stand-up act ready after you retire your old
one? No. That'll take eight months to a year before I'm ready to do
another concert. (laughs) Depending on how hard I work.
</P>
<P>
   What's it been like not having to go to your TV show? Ever take
a dog into the park and take his leash off? He looks up at you for
a second, then just bolts like a maniac. It's been something like
that.
</P>
<P>
   Scalpers are getting $1,500 for a ticket to your show. Is it a
good deal at $1,500? If you have $1,500 to spend on a ticket,
you're beyond good deals.
</P>
<P>
   Does the scalping bother you? Isn't that money that could have
been spent on kids? There's crime, it does bother me, and as a
comedian I realize it's important for me to fight crime wherever I
see it. But I don't know if I'm the person best equipped to handle
this situation. Telling jokes from the stage, it's hard to change
the criminal mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   You've talked about getting into advertising. I started that
talk. It was just talk at the time. Maybe someday. I enjoy creative
commercials. What's always interested me is they're so short.
</P>
<P>
   Do you regret any ``Seinfeld'' episodes? Like the Puerto Rican
parade episode? No. The Puerto Rican parade episode is one of my
favorites. I found the flap around (it) amusing, it was so stupid.
People manipulating it into an issue was pretty weak.
</P>
<P>
   You hosted 400 public school kids at a Mets game (Monday). You
want to continue to work with New York City kids? We'll see how
those kids turn out. If they become scalpers or journalists, I'll
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Did it become more difficult to do ``Seinfeld'' in L.A.? Yes. I
felt the writers were deprived of stimulation. They were working
from a memory of living. If we wrote the show in New York, when you
walk to work, you would have seen something. That's where you get
ideas as a writer. In L.A., you're less involved with the general
public. The second I got back to New York, I felt like I woke up.
</P>
<P>
   How do you feel about the sex shops closing on Broadway? Just my
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Why'd you give people their money back in Des Moines (Iowa)?
(Seinfeld returned the $60 charge to ticket holders at his shows
there last month) It seemed like fun and I could afford it. It was
the last stop on the tour, we were in Des Moines and the idea
popped into my head. I had a little peephole in my dressing room
into the lobby, so I got to see each person hear this news. People
were like, ``What?'' Then they'd break into a big smile. It was
worth it. It was about making people feel a little better.
</P>
<P>
   You think criticism of your last show was fair? Criticism is
always fair. What people forget is it's unimportant. Everybody's
allowed to criticize, it's what an audience does. And every
audience member is of equal value, whether or not they have a
typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Would you do another series? I can't imagine I was as lucky as I
was the first time, and only an idiot could imagine I'd be that
lucky again.
</P>
<P>
   You have a favorite memory from ``Seinfeld''? Tough to say, but
I have this image that's hard to get out of my head when we filmed
the marble rye episode. We spent a lot of money on that episode, we
were filming it on the Parmount back lot, bringing in fake snow. We
were up all night filming Kramer with the horse, and there were
snowball fights with the crew, and I remember trying to throw the
bread up to Jason (Alexander) in the window at 5 in the morning.
Throwing snowballs, it's 5 in the morning, trying to throw a marble
rye up in a window _ I just thought, ``This is show business.

 &HT;    ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' invades America: summer replacement
show looks like a winner
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, America's staunchest couch potatoes have been
watching Britain's improv import ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' on
cable and laughing.
</P>
<P>
   So it was really only a matter of time until a network like ABC
launched its own version. And what better ham to host than the
network's funniest sitcom star Drew Carey?
</P>
<P>
   It almost works like a charm.
</P>
<P>
   The Americanized ``Whose Line,'' debuting tonight after ``The
Drew Carey Show,'' is almost as funny as the Brit original with a
trio of veteran ``Line'' guys _ Ryan Stiles, Colin Mochrie and Greg
Proops _ plus Wayne Brady doing improvisational bits to situations
sometimes dreamed up by the studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   It's all rapid-fire visual jokes and quit-witted quips. In one
segment, Proops has to pretend to be a party host and guess what
guest roles the other fellas have been instructed to act out. In
this case: one's acting like an accident-prone circus performer,
another plays a guy in a slow-motion fight scene and the third
(he's the lucky one) has the role of a foal being born.
</P>
<P>
   It works. What doesn't is the pumped-up volume added to the
audience's applause-and-roar track. And one does wonder why Drew
Carey's here. Thirteen cutaway shots to a chuckling Carey seems
like a waste of a good talent.
</P>
<P>
   But during the heat of summer reruns, we'll take fresh laughs
like this anyway we can get it.

MOSTLY MOZART: FLOW OF CHOPIN FROM 1840 PIANO
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After a weekend assault by Richard Strauss on
Mozart's ``Idomeneo,'' the early-music movement regained its
footing and its dignity at the Mostly Mozart Festival at Lincoln
Center on Monday night. No rewriting, reorchestrating and
translations here; the Orchestra of the Age of Enlightenment, a
splendid band of period-instrument players from Britain, gave us
two three-movement symphonies by Mozart and Chopin's F minor Piano
Concerto. Paul Daniel conducted. For the Chopin, Emanuel Ax used an
1840 Broadwood instrument.
</P>
<P>
   The choice of pieces had a value all its own. One tends to think
of Chopin as the property of late 19th- and 20th-century virtuosos,
while in fact he is closer to the Classical era than one
acknowledges. If there was an originality in Chopin's music that
rose above any consideration of period and style, it still operated
within earlier rather than later conventions. Indeed, the practice
of beginning Chopin's ornamentation and trills before the beat,
instead of on it, probably began after his death in 1849.
</P>
<P>
   If we discount the rudimentary orchestra part, the concerto
still sounds so fearlessly rhapsodic, and in its harmony so
different from anything else the year 1829 had to offer, that the
listener is astonished anew with every repetition. The fact that
Chopin was 19 at the time makes one wonder even more.
</P>
<P>
   Equally astonishing was Ax's performance. The outer movements
had an air of leisure: every detail in place, every gesture devoid
of stress regardless of virtuoso problems. The languid slow
movement discovered points of tension and release with such utter
naturalness that one simply stepped back in awe and gratitude. The
limited sonority of the instrument becomes a matter of small
importance when confronting playing like this. Indeed, Ax rose
above period and style, just as his subject matter had.
</P>
<P>
   Presented with a modern piano, Chopin, I think, would have
quickly dumped Ax's Broadwood. Early keyboard instruments can
provide invaluable road maps through the Classical era and onward
through Beethoven and Schubert. On Monday, however, the listener
experienced more loss than gain. There is a kind of economic
equilibrium behind all the arguments over which instrument is best.
In other words, one pays for what one gets.
</P>
<P>
   The Mozart-Haydn piano sacrifices power for clarity. The modern
piano achieves a homogenous beauty by sacrificing detail, by
smoothing over the bumps and anomalies that the Classical composers
wanted us to hear. Chopin's melodic style, with its sweeping
harmony-melody textures, can largely do without the bumps, but it
thrives on the kind of beautiful sound Ax's dry little piano could
not provide.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart's ``Paris'' and ``Prague'' Symphonies surrounded Chopin
on Monday's program. Beautifully in tune (and surviving a number of
mishaps in the brass and winds), the Orchestra of the Age of
Enlightenment enlightened us on period practices. Ensemble was
tight, dry and transparent. The big brass chords in the finale took
on a violence that the 20th century does not associate with Mozart.
More important, the slow movements danced more than they sang, and
dancing drove 18th-century style more than anything else.

`THE MOTHER OF US ALL': ENDEARINGLY WACKY 
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   COOPERSTOWN, N.Y. _ The tradition at Glimmerglass Opera is to
balance rarities against favorites, and conventional productions
against ones in which a directorial free hand can yield anything
from revelatory insight to outright loopiness.
</P>
<P>
   In fostering this practice, Paul Kellogg, the company's artistic
director, has proved a canny businessman: The range of current
operatic taste being what it is, something on Glimmerglass'
schedule is likely to seem irresistible to anyone who cares about
opera; and given that 51 percent of the audience for the festival
travels more than two and a half hours to attend, operagoers are
likely to take in more than one production, regardless of their
directorial sympathies.
</P>
<P>
   For novelty seekers, the big draw in this summer's
eight-and-a-half-week schedule is ``The Mother of Us All,'' Virgil
Thomson's collaboration with Gertrude Stein that memorializes, in
its peculiar way, Susan B. Anthony's struggle to win the vote for
women. Conventional operas of the 18th- and 19th-century variety
resist directorial freehandedness to varying degrees, but ``The
Mother of Us All'' demands an off-kilter production to match
Stein's free-associative text and Thomson's cheery sampler of
American folk styles, hymns, marches and reveries, underpinned with
his characteristically mischievous wit.
</P>
<P>
   Christopher Alden meets that demand with a production that is
endearingly wacky: with sets by Allen Moyer, costumes by Gabriel
Berry and lighting by Mark McCullough, he lets the cartoonish
interior of Anthony's study give way to a sweetly old-fashioned
schoolroom. Stein's historically fluid cast of characters _ John
Adams, Ulysses S. Grant, Daniel Webster and Anthony Comstock among
them _creates a weird alternate reality, sometimes interacting
manically, sometimes sitting in what seems like a vast group
therapy session. For all of Stein's non sequiturs, her portrait of
Anthony and her struggle proves oddly touching and compelling.
</P>
<P>
   The cast is vast, the roles are fragmentary, but on Saturday
evening the singing was nicely polished and caught both the quirky
humor and the sometimes desperate passion of the piece. Joanna
Johnston sang the role of Susan B. Anthony powerfully, and Dean
Elzinga's portrayal of Daniel Webster as a pompous blowhard was
what Stein and Thomson seem to have wanted.
</P>
<P>
   Ruthann Manley as Susan's companion, Anne; Jeffrey Lentz as Jo
the Loiterer, Tara Venditti as Indiana Elliot, Mark Tevis as John
Adams, Wendy Hill as Constance Fletcher and Lisa Angelina Griffith
as Jenny Reefer all contributed amply to the circusy atmosphere.
The orchestra, conducted by Stewart Robinson, gave Thomson's score
a warm, zesty, well-paced reading.
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Mother of Us All,'' a trendily updated staging of
Handel's ``Partenope'' and a weirdly disfigured ``Tosca'' getting
attention over the weekend, Leon Major's traditional ``Falstaff''
was almost lost in the shuffle. In some ways, though, it was the
most satisfying of the lot.
</P>
<P>
   John Conklin's sets and costumes made the production look like
an animated Vermeer painting, and Pat Collins' lighting created
some wonderful images, the most memorable being an immense, looming
shadow of Falstaff on the wall of his room at the Garter Inn just
after Mistress Quickly's visit.
</P>
<P>
   The real attraction of this production, though, is Mark Delavan
in the title role. His voice is big, sonorous and rich, and his
comic pacing was just about perfect. There was also much to admire
in Amy Burton's sparkling, sly portrayal of Alice, Tonna Miller's
fresh, sweet-toned performance as Nanetta and Mimi Lerner's vocally
dry but comically adept Quickly. The orchestra, conducted by George
Manahan, seemed slightly underpowered on Thursday but generally
played vibrantly.
</P>
<P>
   All four of the productions Glimmerglass is presenting this
summer will be seen at the New York City Opera: Puccini's ``Tosca''
and Handel's ``Partenope'' are due in the fall, ``The Mother of Us
All'' and ``Falstaff'' in future seasons. They are being presented
in repertory here through Aug. 24 and can be taken in as a group on
weekends. A fifth work, Deborah Drattell's ``Lilith,'' is to have a
concert reading on Aug. 16.

</P>
<P>
   An old lady is rocking away the last of her days on her front
porch, reflecting on her long life, when, all of a sudden, a fairy
godmother appears in front of her and informs her that she will be
granted three wishes.
</P>
<P>
   `Well, now,` says the old lady, `I guess I would like to be
really rich.`
</P>
<P>
   POOF! Her rocking chair turns to solid gold.
</P>
<P>
   `And, gee, I guess I wouldn't mind being a young, beautiful
princess.`
</P>
<P>
   POOF! She turns into a beautiful young woman.
</P>
<P>
   `Your third wish?` asks the fairy godmother.
</P>
<P>
   Just then the old woman's cat wanders across the porch in front
of them.
</P>
<P>
   `Ooh _ can you change him into a handsome prince?' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   POOF! There before her stands a young man more handsome than
anyone could possibly imagine.
</P>
<P>
   She stares at him, smitten. With a smile that makes her knees
weak, he saunters across the porch and whispers in her ear:
</P>
<P>
   `Bet you're sorry you had me neutered.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEY, ITS AUGUST .... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Over breakfast one morning, a woman said to her husband, `I bet
you don't know what day this is.`
</P>
<P>
   `Of course I do,` he indignantly answered, going out the door to
the office.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m., the doorbell rang and when the woman opened the
door, she was handed a box containing a dozen long stemmed red
roses. At 1 p.m., a foil- wrapped, two-pound box of her favorite
chocolates arrived. Later, a boutique delivered a designer dress.
</P>
<P>
   The woman couldn't wait for her husband to come home.
</P>
<P>
   `First the flowers, then the chocolates and then the dress!` she
exclaimed.
</P>
<P>
   `I've never had a more wonderful Groundhog Day in my life!`

</P>
<P>
   An old lady is rocking away the last of her days on her front
porch, reflecting on her long life, when, all of a sudden, a fairy
godmother appears in front of her and informs her that she will be
granted three wishes.
</P>
<P>
   `Well, now,` says the old lady, `I guess I would like to be
really rich.`
</P>
<P>
   POOF! Her rocking chair turns to solid gold.
</P>
<P>
   `And, gee, I guess I wouldn't mind being a young, beautiful
princess.`
</P>
<P>
   POOF! She turns into a beautiful young woman.
</P>
<P>
   `Your third wish?` asks the fairy godmother.
</P>
<P>
   Just then the old woman's cat wanders across the porch in front
of them.
</P>
<P>
   `Ooh _ can you change him into a handsome prince?' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   POOF! There before her stands a young man more handsome than
anyone could possibly imagine.
</P>
<P>
   She stares at him, smitten. With a smile that makes her knees
weak, he saunters across the porch and whispers in her ear:
</P>
<P>
   `Bet you're sorry you had me neutered.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEY, ITS AUGUST .... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Over breakfast one morning, a woman said to her husband, `I bet
you don't know what day this is.`
</P>
<P>
   `Of course I do,` he indignantly answered, going out the door to
the office.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m., the doorbell rang and when the woman opened the
door, she was handed a box containing a dozen long stemmed red
roses. At 1 p.m., a foil- wrapped, two-pound box of her favorite
chocolates arrived. Later, a boutique delivered a designer dress.
</P>
<P>
   The woman couldn't wait for her husband to come home.
</P>
<P>
   `First the flowers, then the chocolates and then the dress!` she
exclaimed.

FAWNING FANS ADORN MTV SHOW 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By BILL GOODYKOONTZ  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - When I was a cub reporter, an editor sent me to a
celebrity golf tournament to write a story about the famous folks
playing and the fans' reaction to them.
</P>
<P>
   At one point, I found myself standing off to the side of a crowd
of people with Julius Erving. Wow, Dr. J _ my hero, ever since I
could dribble a basketball. This was perfect, exactly what the
story needed. So I asked him . . .
</P>
<P>
   Nothing. I couldn't. He was Dr. J! I couldn't have asked him
anything resembling an intelligent question. All I could have done
was babble on about how much he meant to me.
</P>
<P>
   If I'd done exactly that, and a camera had been around to record
my idiocy, it could have been the first installment of MTV's
``FANatic.''
</P>
<P>
   Forget years of journalistic training and practice. The show
allows rabid fans of musicians, actors, athletes and other assorted
famous types to interview their heroes.
</P>
<P>
   Jeremiah Bosgang, MTV's vice president for original programming
and development, dreamed it up.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are so many opportunities to see celebrities being
interviewed,'' he said, ``but they're always being interviewed by
some kind of polished comedian or daytime talk-show host.''
</P>
<P>
   No such polish here. ``It's definitely not your average
interview,'' Bosgang said. True enough. Think of Ahmad Rashad
slobbering over Michael Jordan, and you'll have the idea.
</P>
<P>
   Fans _ fanatics _ send in videotapes of themselves explaining
why this or that person means so much to them. Sample: ``I think
about them all the time,'' a girl named Janice says of the group
Third Eye Blind. ``They're the greatest thing that ever happened to
me in my life.''
</P>
<P>
   If that sounds pathetic, it's because it is. Not all of the
testimonials are so maudlin, but you can count on almost everyone
who sends in a tape at some point uttering the words, ``I don't
know where I would be without'' so-and so.
</P>
<P>
   Depending on the star (see www.mtv.com for schedules and
information), the network will receive ``thousands'' of tapes from
fans, Bosgang said.
</P>
<P>
   Each show follows two such fanatics, who are surprised on camera
by their ``best friend.'' (My favorite reaction came from Amina, a
young woman tabbed to interview LA Lakers star Kobe Bryant. Her
friend broke the good news. Amina screamed and said, ``I have to go
to the bathroom.'')
</P>
<P>
   Then they're whisked away, best friend in tow, by limo to a
waiting jet and flown to wherever the celebrity happens to be, even
if it's somewhere as far away as Saudi Arabia. Without fail, the
celebrity is happy as a clam to meet the fan, and sits patiently
while being groveled over.
</P>
<P>
   What with the buildup and surprise and footage of the fan and
the friend riding around in the limo and plane and whatnot, the
actual interview takes up surprisingly little of the show. Much of
the time, that's not a bad thing.
</P>
<P>
   For instance, after Kory spent most of his brush with fame
talking about how much the rapper Busta Rhymes means to him (``He
takes life to the fullest''), he finally talked to him. This led to
a nearly incoherent rambling from Rhymes about how time waits for
no one. I think.
</P>
<P>
   Some interviewers are more polished. Suzanne, a big Led Zeppelin
fan who interviewed Robert Plant and Jimmy Page, actually managed
to ask some good questions of her heroes before breaking down and
asking Page if he received a bow she had sent him two years ago.
(Page looked stunned, for his part, before saying oh yeah, he did.
Hmm.)
</P>
<P>
   In truth, it's all quite entertaining, in a guilty-pleasure sort
of way. The guilt is especially strong when you're watching someone
like Janice, the Third Eye Blind fan, because you feel like you're
eavesdropping on a therapy session. Other interviews, like Amina's
of Bryant, are goofy good fun.
</P>
<P>
   Oddly, after Suzanne finished her interview, Plant said, ``Thank
you for being so professional.''
</P>
<P>
   Careful there. Can't have much of that on this show. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Charles Lindbergh's flight across the Atlantic in
1927, cotton wool in his ears, a mirror stuck to his plane with
gum, lasted only 33{ hours. But when he landed in Paris, he was
compared to Jesus and to the mythical hero Icarus, who flew too
close to the sun _ only Lindbergh had survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was the first modern media superstar,'' said A. Scott Berg,
author of ``Lindbergh,'' an exhaustive new biography, nine years in
the making, which will be published in September. Lindbergh lived
on as a blue-eyed symbol of American innocence, an image that was
later sullied by his troubling statements about Jews even as Nazi
persecution grew in Germany.
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh and his wife, the author Anne Morrow Lindbergh, seemed
to have an ideal marriage. Berg, the first writer to be given
unrestricted access to Lindbergh's papers by his family, discovered
a more complex picture. Mrs. Lindbergh is 92 and lives in
Connecticut.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of Lindbergh's behavior took my breath away,'' said
Berg, the author of ``Max Perkins: Editor of Genius'' and
``Goldwyn: a Biography.'' He was capable of astonishing coldness
toward his family, with moments of sadistic behavior. He could not
express his grief over his son's kidnapping and death and insisted
that his wife cry in private.
</P>
<P>
   But in the end, Berg said, he admired Lindbergh. ``He performed
a death-defying deed. He never cheapened himself by selling out. In
fact, he kept making his life one of purpose. For us living in a
tinny age of celebrity, here is a solid gold hero.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh is an immense subject for any biographer. ``It was
America's moment in the sun,'' Berg said of Lindbergh's triumph.
``He was brave, young, extremely handsome. There was not a bad
photograph to be taken of him. It was the moment when the media
exploded. They had talking pictures, the radio could spread news.''
He became, Berg writes, ``a blank screen onto which each person
projected his own best images of man.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh is a figure Americans can never quite let go of. Berg
lived Lindbergh's life, visiting his ancestral farm in Sweden,
lying in the bed he used in Paris, digging through his nearly 2,000
boxes of papers at Yale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lindbergh was full of surprises for me,'' Berg said, ``the
extent to which he did medical research,'' for instance.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was not aware of the full extent of his contributions to
rocketry and conservation,'' Berg said. ``He wrote six books and
won a Pulitzer and became a wonderful writer. I didn't realize the
breadth and depth of his interests.''
</P>
<P>
   The revelations began with Lindbergh's childhood. ``He made it
seem like Huck Finn on the Mississippi,'' Berg said. But Lindbergh
``had a very lonely, isolated childhood, much of it spent in
Washington,'' where his father, C.A. Lindbergh Sr., was a
congressman from Minnesota. ``His father was always trying to make
a man out of him. He teased him to tears.''
</P>
<P>
   Lindbergh's parents, Berg said, ``were locked in a bitter
marriage.'' His mother, Evangeline Lodge Land, had rages and was
probably mentally ill. Mother and child were close. When he went to
the University of Wisconsin, she lived with him. At age 25,
Lindbergh had still never dated.
</P>
<P>
   The emotionally stunted young man was drawn to aviation partly,
Berg writes, because ``aviation created a brotherhood of casual
acquaintances _ people constantly coming and going _ in which he
felt comfortable.''
</P>
<P>
   Berg provides some new details about the flight. Lindbergh fans
have long wondered who gave the aviator his St. Christopher medal,
for example: it was a schoolteacher from Glen Cove, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   After Lindbergh became the first man to fly solo across the
Atlantic nonstop, he grew wealthy. He was an adviser to the
precursor of TWA and to Pan American World Airways. Anne Morrow's
teacher Mina Curtiss said that had it not been for the flight,
Lindbergh would ``be in charge of a gasoline station on the
outskirts at St. Louis.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1929, Lindbergh married Anne Morrow, the daughter of Dwight
Morrow, a partner of J.P. Morgan and ambassador to Mexico. In 1930,
Charles Jr. was born.
</P>
<P>
   Berg interviewed the baby's nurse, Betty Gow, in Scotland, who
described ``that little bit of sadism'' in Lindbergh. Following
upper class-custom, the Lindberghs left the baby for long periods,
and on one return, Berg said, he did not recognize them. Berg gives
a chilling account of Lindbergh trying to stop the infant's thumb
sucking by tying metal guards to his fingers. To toughen him,
Lindbergh put him in his playpen outdoors and let him cry, in a
sense repeating his own father's behavior.
</P>
<P>
   From the birth, there had been kidnapping threats. As is well
known, on March 1, 1932, Miss Gow discovered his crib empty. A
kidnapper's note was found. Lindbergh tried frantically to
negotiate a release. But the baby was found dead, apparently
dropped by the kidnapper as he climbed down a ladder.
</P>
<P>
   Berg reveals intimate details of Lindbergh's behavior during
this time. ``Anne Lindbergh never once saw her husband cry,'' he
writes.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   ``That is the most devastating line in the book,'' Berg said.
Eventually a Bronx carpenter, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, was
convicted of ``the crime of the century,'' and executed.
</P>
<P>
   Some speculated that Hauptmann was innocent. Berg said he began
hoping to clear him: ``That would have been news.'' But he read
through police reports and interviewed Hauptmann's widow, Anna, and
believes Hauptmann was guilty. ``There was a mountain of
evidence,'' Berg said, including the ladder traced to Hauptmann,
experts' testimony on the ransom notes and serial numbers on money
Hauptmann spent.
</P>
<P>
   The Lindberghs fled to Europe and had five other children.
</P>
<P>
   The most controversial part of Lindbergh's life began when he
came under the influence of Dr. Alexis Carrel, a
Nobel-Prize-winning doctor and physiologist with whom he developed
a tissue perfusion pump to keep organs alive outside the body.
Carrel believed in voluntary sterilization and eugenics and that
``the mosthighly civilized races'' are white.
</P>
<P>
   During the 1930s, Lindbergh inspected the Luftwaffe, which he
believed would be a key element in a Germany victory in war. The
Lindberghs were entertained by Goering, and Lindbergh received the
Service Cross of the German Eagle. In a letter written in 1937,
Lindbergh said Hitler was ``undoubtedly a great man, and I believe
has done much for the German people.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1939, the Lindberghs returned to the United States. Lindbergh
joined the group America First, which opposed involvement in the
European war. In a famous speech in Des Moines in 1941, Lindbergh
said: ``It is not difficult to understand why Jewish people desire
the overthrow of Nazi Germany.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The persecution they suffered in Germany,'' he went on,
``would be sufficient to make bitter enemies of any race.''
</P>
<P>
   But he continued: ``Their greatest danger to this country lies
in their large ownership and influence in our motion pictures, our
press, our radio and our government.'' Some of his writings were
edited to soften his opinions.
</P>
<P>
   Berg, who is Jewish, said: ``The anti-Semitic material was less
than I expected. If the definition of an anti-Semite is someone who
hates Jews, then he was not anti-Semitic,'' he said. ``If
anti-Semitism means viewing Jews as different, as other than
American, as the Other, then yes, he was anti-Semitic.'' Berg
added: ``Lindbergh certainly bought into traditional anti-Semitic
stereotyping of Jews controlling the media and exerting undue
influence.''

   Mrs. Lindbergh, Berg said, shared some of her husband's beliefs.
In her book ``The Wave of the Future,'' Mrs. Lindbergh seemed to
many to praise Fascist leaders. In one letter, she said that she
was beginning to feel that Hitler was ``a very great man, like an
inspired religious leader _ and as such rather fanatical _ but not
scheming, not selfish, not greedy for power.'' Berg discovered that
some of her views were also softened in editing.
</P>
<P>
   ``I tried not to put my own feelings into the research, but to
let it speak for itself,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   As is known, after the United States entered the war, Lindbergh,
who was working in the Far East for United Aircraft, flew, as a
civilian, 50 missions against the Japanese. He became a consultant
to the secretary of the Air Force, helped reorganize the Strategic
Air Command, and worked on development of ballistic missiles. He
was commissioned a brigadier general in the Air Force Reserve.
</P>
<P>
   As time passed, the Lindberghs grew estranged, Berg writes. When
they married, ``they hardly knew each other,'' he said. Lindbergh
became ``comically self-absorbed.'' He seemed to do little but make
self-appointed trips on behalf of aviation and conservation. He
kept lists of clothes to be packed, revising them. He became
obsessed with the Cold War, instructing his wife to cancel
dentists' appointments in the event of war because of Soviet
threats to sabotage the water supply.
</P>
<P>
   Berg writes that Mrs. Lindbergh fell in love with the flyer
Antoine de Saint-Exupery and later with her doctor, Dana Atchley,
who had removed her gallbladder. Mrs. Lindbergh did not discuss the
affair with Berg, he said. Mrs. Lindbergh did make her
correspondence available, including letters to and from Atchley,
who helped care for Lindbergh in his final illness.
</P>
<P>
   Even as he lay dying at 72 from lymphatic cancer, Berg writes,
Lindbergh tried to control every detail, planning his burial in
Hawaii. Even then, his son Land was afraid to touch him. At one
point, Berg writes, Land ``instinctively wanted to hold his father,
but he knew how much he disliked being touched.''

your body doesn't sweat. It perspires. Perspiration has an odor.
They don't call deodorants ``anti-sweats,'' do they? No, they call
them ``antiperspirants.'' No, sweat belongs on celebrities' bodies.
Marlon Brando. Chris Isaak. Michael Jordan. Janet Jackson. To
paraphrase Will Smith, they make this sweat look good. In
entertainment and advertising, sweat is sexy for a reason: You
can't smell it. It gives you the sense that people are pumped or

</P>
<P>
   An old lady is rocking away the last of her days on her front
porch, reflecting on her long life, when, all of a sudden, a fairy
godmother appears in front of her and informs her that she will be
granted three wishes.
</P>
<P>
   `Well, now,` says the old lady, `I guess I would like to be
really rich.`
</P>
<P>
   POOF! Her rocking chair turns to solid gold.
</P>
<P>
   `And, gee, I guess I wouldn't mind being a young, beautiful
princess.`
</P>
<P>
   POOF! She turns into a beautiful young woman.
</P>
<P>
   `Your third wish?` asks the fairy godmother.
</P>
<P>
   Just then the old woman's cat wanders across the porch in front
of them.
</P>
<P>
   `Ooh _ can you change him into a handsome prince?' she asks.
</P>
<P>
   POOF! There before her stands a young man more handsome than
anyone could possibly imagine.
</P>
<P>
   She stares at him, smitten. With a smile that makes her knees
weak, he saunters across the porch and whispers in her ear:
</P>
<P>
   `Bet you're sorry you had me neutered.`
</P>
<P>
   &UR; HEY, ITS AUGUST .... &LR;
</P>
<P>
   Over breakfast one morning, a woman said to her husband, `I bet
you don't know what day this is.`
</P>
<P>
   `Of course I do,` he indignantly answered, going out the door to
the office.
</P>
<P>
   At 10 a.m., the doorbell rang and when the woman opened the
door, she was handed a box containing a dozen long stemmed red
roses. At 1 p.m., a foil- wrapped, two-pound box of her favorite
chocolates arrived. Later, a boutique delivered a designer dress.
</P>
<P>
   The woman couldn't wait for her husband to come home.
</P>
<P>
   `First the flowers, then the chocolates and then the dress!` she
exclaimed.

GAY RIGHTS SUPPORTERS IN HOUSE PREDICT DEFEAT OF HEFLEY AMENDMENT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service Clients.)  
 By JUDY HOLLAND  
 c.1998 Hearst Newspapers  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Democratic and Republican lawmakers predicted
Tuesday that the House will reject legislation that would nullify
President Clinton's executive order barring federal agencies from
discriminating against people based on sexual orientation.
</P>
<P>
   The House is scheduled to vote on the issue this week when Rep.
Joel Hefley, R-Colo., offers it as an amendment to a $28 billion
appropriations bill funding different government agencies.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we will defeat Hefley,'' said Rep. Jim Kolbe, R-Ariz.,
the only openly gay House Republican and a critic of the measure.
``But I never take these things for granted.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. John Linder, R-Ga., chairman of the National Republican
Congressional Committee, said he ``wouldn't be surprised'' if the
Hefley measure is defeated.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's some very hard work being done'' to defeat the
proposal, Linder said.
</P>
<P>
   Kolbe said he expects the 20-minute debate on the Hefley
amendment to stay focused on the topic of discrimination against
gays and lesbians. Republican leaders, concerned that their party
could be perceived as anti-gay, had hoped to focus the debate on
presidential powers. To that end, the GOP House leadership had
combined Hefley's proposal with legislation to nullify another
executive order expanding federal jurisdiction at the expense of
state and local governments.
</P>
<P>
   However, President Clinton last week rescinded the executive
order dealing with federalism, thus blunting the Republican move to
convert the gay-discrimination debate into a dry discourse on
constitutional powers.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Barney Frank, D-Mass., an acknowledged homosexual and a
leading congressional spokesman for gay rights, also predicted that
the Hefley amendment ``is likely to lose.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about discrimination,'' Frank said. ``I think
most people don't want to be associated with it.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Mark Foley, R-Fla., who was among a group of Republicans
counting votes on the Hefley amendment, also predicted it would
fail.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems a number of members have looked at it and come to the
conclusion that it was mean-spirited,'' Foley said. He opposes the
amendment.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Brian Bilbray, R-Calif., said Clinton's executive order
barring federal agencies from discriminating against gays ``is the
kind of thing we need to see more of.''
</P>
<P>
   Clinton's May executive order added ``sexual orientation'' to a
1969 executive order by President Richard Nixon, which bars federal
agencies from discriminating based on race, color, religion,
gender, national origin, disability or age.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not a Democrat or a Republican issue,'' Bilbray said.
``When it comes to the workplace, we shouldn't tolerate any
discrimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Kevin Ivers, a spokesman for Log Cabin Republicans, a gay
advocacy group, said he is ``cautiously optimistic'' that the
Hefley amendment will fail because of opposition among House
Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Members of Congress ``are being confronted with this issue
head-on without an escape hatch,'' Ivers said. ``This vote is
unlike any vote we've seen in years. It is a complete confrontation
between those who believe in discrimination and those who oppose
discrimination against gays. There is no middle ground.''
</P>
<P>
   Last week, the House approved a measure aimed at San Francisco's
``domestic partners'' law. That ordinance requires private
contractors who do business with the city to bestow the same
benefits _ mainly health insurance coverage _ on the unmarried
partners of their employees as they confer on the spouses of their
married employees.
</P>
<P>
   The San Francisco policy was enacted two years ago after intense
lobbying by gay rights advocates.
</P>
<P>
   By a 214-212 vote, the House approved a measure sponsored by
Rep. Frank Riggs, R-Calif., that would bar San Francisco from
spending federal money unless the city revokes the ordinance.
</P>
<P>
   The Riggs amendment is expected to fail in the Senate.

   FEATURE STORIES
</P>
<P>
   INSTALLATION-ART (Undated) _ I still recall Gary Hill's
installation at Documenta 9 in Kassel, Germany, with pleasure, even
if it was a little hokey: in the middle of the show, his work was a
sanctuary behind blackout curtains, a long room of videotaped
images of people who seemed to emerge from the darkness like
ghosts, looking out at us, smiling, frowning or whatever, then
retreating as if in a dream. That was six years ago. Since then,
what was no longer uncommon even at that time has become so
commonplace that very often it has passed beyond cliche to parody:
installation art is in the late 90s roughly what Abstract
Expressionism was by the late 50s. By Michael Kimmelman.

   THEATER
</P>
<P>
   ROBBINS-FANCY-FREE (Undated) _ Jerome Robbins was an everyday
presence in my dancegoing life from early on. I saw his three
sailors on the town in ``Fancy Free'' as a child shortly after he
created this ballet, his first, in 1944. It appealed to children
and grown-ups alike. Ballet had already seduced me with Act II of
``Swan Lake.'' But ``Fancy Free,'' like all Robbins works, opened a
door. It let me know at a very young age that ballet had a wide
horizon and was not limited to a single type of theatrical
experience. By Anna Kisselgoff.
</P>
<P>
   JEROME-ROBBINS-APPRAISAL (Undated) _ Celebrities from dance and

Robbins, dancer and choreographer extraordinaire of ballets and
Broadway shows, who died  &QL; 
12 days ago. By Jennifer Dunning.
</P>
<P>
   HENSLEY-OKLAHOMA-MUSICAL (London) _ In a New York theater
climate that regularly welcomes Britons, famous or otherwise _
whether Ralph Fiennes or Eddie Izzard _ there is something
particularly gratifying about an American unknown causing a stir in
London. And a Georgia-born baritone named Shuler Hensley most
definitely is doing just that as the menacing Jud Fry in the Royal
National Theater's current revival of ``Oklahoma!'' By Matt Wolf.
</P>
<P>
   OKLAHOMA-MUSICAL (London) _ Any theater historian will tell you
that the 1943 ``Oklahoma!'' was crucial to the evolution of the
Broadway musical and, doing so, leave you wondering if you honestly
wish to see it revived. Trevor Nunn, the Royal National Theater's
director, is doing just that by staging the Rodgers and
Hammerstein's musical in the Olivier auditorium this summer. By
Benedict Nightingale.

   BEVERLY-HILLS-FILM (Los Angeles) _``Slums of Beverly Hills,'' a
film that Ms. Tamara Jenkins wrote and directed, is a 70s-era tale
about the coming of age of 15-year-old Vivian Abramowitz (Natasha
Lyonne). In it, Vivian and her two brothers are being schlepped by
their 60-something father (Alan Arkin) from one thin-walled,
furniture-deprived domicile to the next, each barely within the
90210 ZIP code so as to afford them access to superior public
schools. By Margy Rochlin.
</P>
<P>
   DEAD-HEART-VIDEO (Undated) _ When ``Dead Heart'' played in
Australia in 1996, Nicholas Parsons's film, about a highly charged
confrontation between white and aboriginal cultures at Wala Wala, a
remote settlement in the desert 50 miles west of Alice Springs, was
about to fade away from art houses when discussion of it on a
Sydney talk show helped extend its run to 20 weeks. In this
country, ``Dead Heart'' received favorable reviews but disappeared
quickly, in the manner of many good little films. Now it is back on
a videotape from Fox Lorber. By Peter M. Nichols.

<P>
   MCKAYLE-DANCE (Undated) _ The choreographer Donald McKayle can
be as difficult to locate as he is to classify. Instead of staying
in one place, he shuttles between New York and California. Rather
than create dances for just one medium, he regularly invents them
for Broadway, television, film and the concert stage. By Valerie
Gladstone.

<P>
   PHRYGIAN-GATES-MUSIC (Undated) _ It may disturb the composer
John Adams that his operas have not been revived, as reported in
these pages, but there is a grain of consolation: ``Phrygian
Gates,'' a 20-year-old piano work by Adams, is apparently becoming
a favorite of new-music pianists. By Allan Kozinn.
</P>
<P>
   FUTURISM-MUSIC (Undated) _ ``Russian Futurism,'' five compact
disks in three packages from Arte Nova, appropriates a title to
which it may not be entitled. Futurism had a distinct time, place
and description, and none of the music offered here fits the last
two of these. The visual arts were futurism's focus; the musical
arm survives in accounts of it. Aside from an all but
undecipherable shellac record, this brief, brave movement came and
went, leaving only its ideas behind. By Bernard Holland.
</P>
<P>
   LATE-CENTURY-MUSIC (Undated) _ A short while ago I suggested
that an orchestra could operate for 10 years playing only music
written during the last three decades. That claim was meant to
indicate how much excellent music has been composed during this
time, not to put forward a real proposal for orchestral planning.
For one thing, homogeneous programs are generally less interesting
than mixed ones, which can put a new or recent piece into a useful
perspective. To hear Elliott Carter in the company of Bach, say, or
Steve Reich alongside Stravinsky, will shed light not only on the
newer music but also on the older. By Paul Griffith.

   ZAHA-HADID-ARCHITECT (Undated) _ Zaha Hadid's design for the
Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati won't be officially unveiled
until this October, but surely I'm not the only one impatient for a
preview. And in fact the design is already far enough along to
praise Cincinnati for giving this remarkable architect her first
commission in the United States. By Herbert Muschamp.
</P>
<P>
   HAMILTON-ART (Undated) _ Some contemporary art collectors are so
unfazed by installation-size works that they would very likely buy
Uranus if they could get God to come and properly install it. But
there is one artist still largely beyond their grasp: Ann Hamilton.
Ms. Hamilton, 42, an Ohioan whose work is perhaps the most
elaborate of all, sells her installations only to museums. By Nancy
Hass.

<P>
   TELEVISION
</P>
<P>
   MILLENNIAL-LIST-TV (Undated) _ Warning! This is (italics)not(end

alphanumerically indexed. There will be no color-coding. No scales
from 1 to 10. There might be an exploded 3-D pie chart or a Venn
diagram somewhere toward the bottom; I haven't decided yet. (As a
concession, however, to those of you suffering from late-millennial
list addiction, here: No. 17 _ Fred Mertz, No. 18 _ The Bay of
Fundy, No. 19 _ Pickled tongue.) The lazybones shorthand of list
making isn't a bad thing. Humankind has always hankered after an
orderly, manageable universe in which the accounting of our stars
and ourselves comes easy. By Jeff MacGregor.

MUSCLES YANKEE IS HAMBLETONIAN FAVORITE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ALEX YANNIS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ Muscles Yankee, who captured his last
three races in remarkable fashion, was installed Tuesday as the
even-money favorite in the post position draw for Saturday's 73rd
edition of the $1 million Hambletonian at the Meadowlands.
</P>
<P>
   Muscles Yankee will be driven by John Campbell, who is seeking a
record fifth Hambletonian title, and will leave from the No. 6 spot
in the field of 10. Muscles Yankee is one of four horses in the
race trained by Chuck Sylvester, who is seeking his third title in
the Hambletonian.
</P>
<P>
   Only two of the four horses Sylvester trains, Armbro Rotary and
Silver Pine, are coupled because Sylvester is also part owner of
the two horses. And the Meadowlands applied for and got an
exemption Tuesday morning from the New Jersey Racing Commission not
to have a four-horse entry, allowing for more wide-open betting in
the most prestigious event in harness racing.
</P>
<P>
   Armbro Rotary and Silver Pine will leave from the second and
third post, respectively, and were installed as the second favorite
at 7-2. Sylvester owns 10 percent of Armbro Rotary and a third of
Silver Pine.
</P>
<P>
   Silver Pine, who will be driven by George Brennan, captured his
Hambletonian elimination easily last Saturday, while Armbro Rotary
finished second to Muscles Yankee in his elimination.
</P>
<P>
   The fourth horse Sylvester trains is David Raymond, who was
installed at 4-1 even though he will leave from the inside post
with Cat Manzi driving. Sylvester will train David Raymond the rest
of the week before the race.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's the only one we will train,'' Sylvester said about David
Raymond, who has finished in the money in all nine of his starts
this season. ``The others we will just jog.''
</P>
<P>
   Sylvester said he liked the chances of three of his horses in
the race, which will be shown live by CBS television starting at 3
p.m. ``Any of the three,'' he said. ``I think it will take a lot
for Rotary,'' Sylvester said. Armbro Rotary has no victories in six
starts this season.
</P>
<P>
   Muscles Yankee is Sylvester's choice for the Hambletonian, the
first leg of the trotting triple crown. The Yonkers Trot on Aug. 29
is the second and the Kentucky Futurity on Oct. 9 is the third. The
last time there was a triple crown winner was in 1972, when Super
Bowl won it.
</P>
<P>
   ``In my mind, Muscles is the horse to beat,'' Sylvester said
after Tuesday's draw. ``There is nothing lacking in this horse.
He's stronger and has made no mistakes this year.''
</P>
<P>
   Muscles Yankee has four victories and a second in his five
starts this season. He won his elimination last Saturday in
wire-to-wire fashion in a career best time of 1:54.2. He also
captured his previous race, the $400,000 Beacon Course Final.
</P>
<P>
   The $500,000 Hambletonian Oaks for 3-year-old fillies will also
be staged on Saturday as the eighth race, while the Hambletonian
will be the 11th race on a card of 15.

DAY CARE'S DEFENDERS PROVIDE AN ENTIRELY NEW PERSPECTIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By MARK GENRICH  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - I had this theory about children raised in day-care
centers. My theory was quite unscientific, based as it was on mere
observation as well as some disturbing statistics released by the
White House:
</P>
<P>
   1. In 1995, of the approximately 21 million infants, toddlers,
and preschool children under the age of 6 in the United States,
more than 12.9 million children were in day care. Forty-five
percent of children under age 1 were in day care on a regular
basis.
</P>
<P>
   2. Many children are in settings that are not healthy or safe
and do not promote early learning and development. A four-state
study of the quality of day-care centers found that only one in
seven centers (14 percent) were rated good quality. According to
another study, 13 percent of regulated and 50 percent of
unregulated family child-care providers offer care that is
inadequate.
</P>
<P>
   3. Many children living in poverty receive child care that may
compromise their health and safety.
</P>
<P>
   My theory was that, given the harm day care does to some
children and given the greed and selfishness demonstrated by some
parents who do not have to send their children to these day-care
pits, it was likely that rude and unruly children probably have
some day-care experience in their background.
</P>
<P>
   I observed that in days gone by, obstinate children were kept at
home until they could behave. Not anymore. Parents, perhaps feeling
guilty from being away from their children during the day, drag
their kids to restaurants, sporting events, theaters and other
public places where the children subsequently display tantrums of
day-care vintage.
</P>
<P>
   That was the theory I wrote about a few weeks ago. But now that
I have heard from several defenders of day care, I have a whole new
perspective:
</P>
<P>
   Defender No. 1: ``My experience is that day-care children are
usually not the unruly ones. When children are in large groups they
have to learn quickly how to behave. Children who are cared for at
home have less opportunity to learn to stand in line, be patient,
sit quietly, etc.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, I hadn't thought of that before. The lack of individual
attention, the absence of a caring parent, teaches a child to be .
. . ``patient.''
</P>
<P>
   Defender No. 2: ``I could give you names and phone numbers of
many stay-at-home moms with horrible children. You seem to be fond
of stereotypes. Here is one: these kids are spoiled, clingy and
selfish. They watch too much TV and always get their way.''
</P>
<P>
   Ah, I hadn't thought of that either. Spoiled, selfish and
``clingy'' to careers might also aptly describe some parents who
deposit their children into day care for the sake of filling their
third car garage.
</P>
<P>
   Defender No. 3: ``My wife took our 2-year-old to see ``Mulan''
at a 2 p.m. weekday matinee and was told by a senior citizen to
shush as she asked questions about the movie. Several times I have
witnessed seniors commenting on the loudness of children at
McDonald's while sitting next to the jungle gym. Tolerance and
perspective for the AARP crowd would be a great future column.''
</P>
<P>
   Defender No. 3 went on to say children from the ``stay-at-home
mom camp'' display behavior that will not serve them well in the
future. I wondered whether that senior citizen at the 2 p.m.
matinee left the movie theater thinking the same thing about
day-care children.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, defenders of day care are actually trafficking in the
belief that strangers can raise their child better than the parent
can. So, now I marvel at the coincidence: Defenders of day care say
here is a phenomenon that actually helps children.
</P>
<P>
   And, the best part is that parental income can be enhanced by
using it. It's amazing how that worked out so well for both parent
and child. &QL;

WHAT IF CLASSICAL COMPOSERS SOUGHT ROYALTIES? 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNDATED - Representatives of DoItAgain Advertising said today
they were not prepared to pay Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart and Ludwig
van Beethoven the amounts demanded by the fabled composers'
lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart and Beethoven, cloned back to life in a controversial
procedure last year, claim DoItAgain owes them each ``between $1
million and $2 million'' for use of their music in recent
television commercials for cars, restaurants, investment firms and
other businesses.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is preposterous to ask us to pay for music that has been in
the public domain for nearly two centuries,'' said Mark N. Sellit,
DoItAgain's president.
</P>
<P>
   One of the composers in question called that ``unacceptable.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't want more than is coming to us,'' Mozart said through
a translator.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the year since I have come alive again, my income has been
little while the use of my music has been big. Everyone plays my
music, sings my music, and these people (DoItAgain) even use my
music to sell things and make money for themselves! After all, I
have Visa card bills.''
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for Mozart denied rumors that the composer _ who was
as notorious during his lifetime for his debt as he was famous for
his music _ had already maxed out 10 credit cards.
</P>
<P>
   Asked about DoItAgain's stance, Beethoven declined comment
through a spokesman, but was overheard storming his hotel room at
all hours of the night, swearing in German.
</P>
<P>
   Assuming that the men cloned as ``Mozart'' and ``Beethoven''
really are the same as the historical persons who wrote their
famous scores _ a point still under considerable debate _ the
question of how to pay them for the concert and commercial use of
their now-copyrighted music looms large.
</P>
<P>
   (Copyright extends 50 years past the death of the composer.
Since Beethoven and Mozart are alive again, their music falls under
international copyright laws that were not in existence when they
lived.)
</P>
<P>
   Shortly after they were cloned from DNA material last year,
Mozart (originally 1756-1791) and Beethoven (originally 1770-1827)
joined ASCAP and BMI respectively, enabling them to claim income
from performance royalties of their works.
</P>
<P>
   ASCAP and BMI are licensing organizations whose Classical
divisions survey performances by orchestras, chamber ensembles,
choirs and the like. Royalty income is then paid composers
according to the frequency of performance, and the size and length
of the work performed.
</P>
<P>
   The money comes from fees paid by everyone from symphony
orchestras to nightclubs. For example, the Phoenix Symphony pays an
average of $10,000 per annum to ASCAP and BMI; a nightclub with
live music might pay $1,200 or more; average fee for a bar or
restaurant with background music is $576 per year.
</P>
<P>
   Through performance royalties alone, Beethoven and Mozart have
already established annual incomes in ``the high five figures,''
according to the best guesses of licensing officials.
</P>
<P>
   But that's peanuts compared to the amounts possible for the use
of their instantly recognizable music in movies and television. The
use of copyrighted material for those purposes is directly
negotiated between the copyright holder and the company. For
instance, United Airlines recently made a deal with the estate of
composer George Gershwin for the use of Gershwin's ``Rhapsody in
Blue,'' one of the most recognizable pieces of music in existence,
and one still in copyright. Though nobody's telling how much was
paid, insider guesses put the price at around $500,000.
</P>
<P>
   Through their lawyers, Beethoven and Mozart released a list of
recent television commercials that have used their music. Among
them:
</P>
<P>
   _Beethoven's ``Fur Elise'' is used in a current commercial for
the Acura automobile.
</P>
<P>
   _A new commercial for Luby's Cafeteria sets new words (mostly
names of pastas to promote a new line of Italian entrees) to ``Non
piu andrai,'' an aria from Mozart's ``Marriage of Figaro.''
</P>
<P>
   _A widely aired commercial for Dean Witter of about a year ago
was drenched in the sounds of Beethoven's ``Choral Fantasy,'' the
piece Beethoven wrote as a kind of warm-up to his more popular
``Ode to Joy.``
</P>
<P>
   ``Ode to Joy'' is a whole other matter. It turns up in
everything from the Olympics to pop songs. If each use were to
require individual negotiation, the potential income for Beethoven
would be very substantial.
</P>
<P>
   The cloning of this pair, two of the greatest composers in
Western music history, has put the spotlight on just how tightly
their music is woven into our daily lives. Yet one observer
believes that being alive _ and under copyright protection _ may
actually work against the continued proliferation of their music.
</P>
<P>
   ``Welcome, Ludwig and Wolfgang, to composer hell,'' says Cecilia
Hildegard, a New York-based composer of contemporary Classical
music.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they were dead, Beethoven's and Mozart's recognizable
music was free, so it got used. And because it got used, it was
recognizable. It's a circle, like,'' said Hildegard between
rehearsals of her new String Quartet No. 198.
</P>
<P>
   ``Now that they want money for their music, they'll be used
less. If Handel came back and wanted money for his music, you
wouldn't hear the `Hallelujah Chorus' as often.''
</P>
<P>
   Curiously, the resurrection of these two great composers may
therefore lead to fewer uses of their music on stage and
television. Even the base income provided by standard performance
royalties is endangered on a legal front: The ``music licensing
amendment'' recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives
and now before the Senate, would greatly restrict the licensing of
music to restaurants and bars.
</P>
<P>
   The alternative for them? Both composers are said to be in high
entrepreneurial mode. In a press release, a Beethoven spokesman
detailed a massive marketing plan that will include the production
of ``Little Ludwig'' dolls. ``They'll bluster and yell when you
pick them up, while `Rage Over a Lost Penny' plays in the
background,'' the spokesman said.
</P>
<P>
   Mozart is rumored to be negotiating with Ty Inc. for a Mozart
look-alike Beanie Baby, to be called ``Wolfie.''
</P>
<P>
   (Reporter's note: In the above story, the cloning of Mozart and
Beethoven, DoItAgain Advertising, Mark N. Sellit and Cecilia
Hildegard are fictitious. Everything else is true _ or could be.) &QL;

CHRISTIAN GROUP SEEKS ROLE AT PRIVATE PRISON FACILITY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By MEDE NIX 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DALLAS _ A Texas evangelical coalition is bidding to turn a
privately run prison in Venus, Texas, into a faith-based operation
that would offer participating inmates job training, counseling and
education built around a Christian ministry.
</P>
<P>
   Restorative Justice Ministries Network and a state
representative supporting the plan say the program, if approved by
the board of the Texas Department of Criminal Justice, could be the
first of its kind in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're talking about work in prison, and jobs when they get out
of prison, in addition to faith-based instruction,'' said Ladd
Holton, executive director of the Fort Worth-based Restorative
Justice Ministries Network, a group of evangelical ministers,
educators, counselors and prison workers. ``These are programs that
the state can't provide, only the faith-based community can
provide.''
</P>
<P>
   State Rep. Ray Allen, R-Grand Prairie, sponsored legislation to
begin and expand the prison system's private industries program, in
which inmates are paid the prevailing wage for working for private
companies inside prisons. He said the program has promise.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been trying to get the state to test more faith-based
types of programs in the criminal justice system,'' Allen said.
``This is one that I think has some promise. I don't have any
complaints about how the prison is being operated now. But to
combine work and faith-based programs just happens to push all my
buttons.''
</P>
<P>
   But some church-state separatists say that turning a prison over
to a faith-based group has inherent problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seems to me the principal problem is government sponsorship
of religion,'' said Ronald Flowers, a religion professor at Texas
Christian University and president of the North Texas chapter of
Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's nothing wrong with having religion in prisons,''
Flowers said. ``Those prisoners have a constitutional right to be
ministered to by a chaplain or someone else. But here you have a
contractual arrangement with a faith-based organization, just like
a secular firm would have. There are some potential, if not real,
constitutional problems.''
</P>
<P>
   Although Holton said inmate participation in any faith-based
program would be voluntary, Flowers said the mere fact that
programs are faith-based might cause some inmates to feel pressure
to participate.
</P>
<P>
   The Criminal Justice Department is accepting bids to operate the
Venus facility and three other privately run sites until Aug. 31
and probably will make a decision in November, said department
spokesman Glen Castlebury. Venus is about 35 miles southeast of
Fort Worth in Johnson County.
</P>
<P>
   The facility is currently operated by the nation's largest
private prison operator, Corrections Corporation of America, based
in Nashville, Tenn. CCA has operated the pre-release, minimum- to
medium-security facility since 1989. Inmates sent to the facility
are within two years of their expected release date.
</P>
<P>
   CCA will bid to keep operating the prison and is closely
watching the effort to turn it into a faith-based facility, said
Laurie Shanblum, CCA's director of special projects.
</P>
<P>
   ``We established that facility as one of the original
pre-release facilities in Texas,'' Shanblum said. ``We've got a
good, solid facility and program and want to continue business
there.''
</P>
<P>
   CCA offers education, vocational programs and life skills
programs geared at rehabilitation. It also offers substance abuse
education, employment assistance, religious programs and a
full-time chaplain, she said.
</P>
<P>
   But Holton says what's lacking is an emphasis on faith, be it
Christian, Muslim or Jewish. Restorative Justice Ministries
Network, as subcontractor with the private security firm
Correctional Systems of San Diego would provide that emphasis and
offer the state a cheaper rate than the average $31 a day per
inmate charged by private companies to run prisons in Texas, he
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will be competitive, and considering that there will be
over $2 million of free services through the faith community, we
think we will be the most cost-effective of anybody,'' said Holton,
58, of Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   The major component is work, in and out of prison.
</P>
<P>
   More than 60 percent of the employees of Holton's BAC Group,
which services alcohol breath-test devices placed in the cars of
drunken driving offenders, are ex-felons. Bosses in the workplace
are often the best mentors, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I know that it can be done if it is done right,'' said Holton,
who got into the prison ministry after working on the construction
of several prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The faith-based prison movement has grown out of Gov. George W.
Bush's efforts and legislation designed to get private and
religious groups involved in programs that were previously
state-sponsored, such as welfare-to-work.
</P>
<P>
   The only faith-based prison effort in Texas is at the Jester II
unit near Houston, where about 100 inmates are enrolled in
InterChange, launched a year ago. The Christian program combines
community service, religious study and vocational training for
inmates who have 18 months to go before their release date.

BRITISH MEDIA BARRED FROM REPORTING ON SECURITY AGENCY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By SARAH LYALL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Did the British government try to assassinate Col.
Moammar Gadhafi, the Libyan leader, in February 1996 by planting a
bomb under his motorcade? And did the plan go awry because agents
from MI6, the foreign intelligence service, put the bomb under the
wrong car, killing several Libyan bystanders?
</P>
<P>
   Britons may never know the answers, or even the credibility of
the assertions, but for the last few days the nation has been
consumed by the questions. Or at least sort of consumed, because
news organizations are not really allowed to ask them.
</P>
<P>
   A sweeping injunction has barred newspapers and television news
programs from publishing the embarrassing allegations about the
inner workings of Britain's security services, brought up by a
disgruntled former officer. The media have been forced to discuss
the allegations without actually saying what the allegations are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've known these things for something like 16 months, and I am
not allowed to publish any of it,'' said Jonathan Holborow, editor
of The Mail on Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   It was The Mail on Sunday that, a year ago, published an initial
round of disclosures by the disgruntled agent, David Shayler, 32,
who left his job at MI5, the domestic security agency, where he
worked on the Libyan desk, in early 1997.
</P>
<P>
   At the time he said he was frustrated at the organization's
incompetence, mismanagement and lack of accountability. Among other
things, he said MI5 had kept files on several members of the
current government, including Peter Mandelson, the Trade and
Industry secretary, when they were active in student movements in
the 1970s. He also spoke of low morale and drunkenness in the
agency.
</P>
<P>
   Shocked at the airing of intimate details about MI5, an
ultra-secret agency, the government quickly obtained a far-reaching
civil injunction barring the British news media from airing any
more of Shayler's allegations.
</P>
<P>
   Sensing that he faced arrest under Britain's draconian Official
Secrets Act, Shayler fled the country and became a John le
Carre-style fugitive from justice.
</P>
<P>
   But last week the long arm of the government caught up with him.
The former agent, who was threatening to publish details of the
supposed Gadhafi plot on the Internet, was arrested in a hotel room
in Paris. He is now in a Parisian prison, fighting Britain's
efforts to extradite him.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's a whistleblower,'' said Shayler's lawyer, John Wadham,
the director of Liberty, a civil liberties group.
</P>
<P>
   ``In comparison with the states, we have no real system of
political accountability or legal accountability,'' he said, since
the spy services are not even accountable to Parliament. ``Under
the law here,'' he said, ``if David disclosed the color of the
carpets in the office where he worked, that would be a criminal
offense.''
</P>
<P>
   The case is threatening to turn into a repeat of the infamous
``Spycatcher'' case of 1986, in which Peter Wright, a retired
intelligence officer, published a book disclosing embarrassing
secrets. The government spent hundreds of thousands of pounds to
insure that the book would never be published _ nor its allegations
printed _ in Britain, but copies were smuggled in from the United
States and sold to the curious and the daring by the side of the
road.
</P>
<P>
   Now, with the advent of the Internet, it is probably only a
matter of time before Shayler's allegations are disseminated.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, the Labor government has taken the harshest possible
stand against the news media. ``The thinking behind the injunction
is that because of the nature of his work, it's possible that
national security can be damaged,'' said a spokeswoman for the Home
Office who spoke on condition that her name not be used.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Strangely enough, the government told the press earlier this
week that it could report the allegation about the Gadhafi
assassination plot in the vaguest possible terms because, the Home
Office spokeswoman said, ``it is untrue.''
</P>
<P>
   But it forbade reporting of related details, like the
allegations that the agent in charge had ties to a shady right-wing
fundamentalist group in Libya, and that he was paid $160,000.
</P>
<P>
   Reporters are hamstrung in two ways, editors said. Because of
the Official Secrets Act, it is virtually impossible to get anyone
to tell them anything about the inner workings of MI5 or MI6, so
they cannot check the veracity of Shayler's allegations. And
because of the injunction, they cannot even publish information
about his credibility, or lack of it, in any detail.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we do, we can be prosecuted,'' said John Witherow, editor
of The Sunday Times. ``Or they can go for an injunction, which
would force us to stop printing and scrap the newspapers which
we've printed already.''
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the injunction requires that anything the papers
print on the subject that comes directly from Shayler must be
vetted by the government, which then decides what the papers can
print.
</P>
<P>
   ``As a journalist in a free democracy,'' said Holborow, of The
Mail on Sunday, this censorship ``makes me feel pretty sick.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We haven't had this sort of thing since the war,'' he said.

 &HT;    COLUMN: Miss Jo wasn't in Normandy, but helped out
 &HT;    By Celestine Sibley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   After a few letters taking me to task for my piece on ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' I'm glad to return to the war effort on the home
front.
</P>
<P>
   (One letter said the Marines weren't in the Normandy invasion,
contrary to what I wrote, and one said of the movie, ``It was just
a flick. Please do not dishonor those who were doing the job by
confusing reality with films.'')
</P>
<P>
   I'm sorry about putting the Marines where they weren't. I guess
I thought they were everywhere. As for confusing reality, I thought
the opening scenes at Omaha Beach were real shots taken at the time
and borrowed by Steven Spielberg to give reality to the film. I've
since learned that's not so, either.
</P>
<P>
   Now on to the home front. Margaret Pearce wrote of the efforts
of my friend Jo Severinghaus, mentioned here awhile back as the
donor of white violets for my yard.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pearce told of Mrs. Severinghaus' World War II effort, which
I should have known about but somehow missed. When the young men of
the community went to war, Mrs. Severinghaus, called ``Miss Jo'' by
her young friends, launched a little newsletter to send to the
servicemen.
</P>
<P>
   Her Sunday school class from Rock Chapel Methodist Church(Ga.)
would gather at her home once a month, clipping newspaper stories,
jokes and cartoons from magazines and pasting them on sheets, which
Miss Jo would get typed and ready for mailing. She supplied
pictures that she had taken of people and places the boys would
recognize.
</P>
<P>
   The letter was called ``Chips,'' and there was a special note to
the young man who suggested the name _ ``busy now in the Pacific on
one of the new flat-tops.'' Margaret enclosed a couple of copies of
``Chips,'' and it's easy to see why returning servicemen were so
grateful to Miss Jo and the girls who kept them informed about the
home front.
</P>
<P>
   A general statement of home news is this: ``Rock Chapel is still
the same old place ... count on that. There's a big empty space
over on the mountain (Stone Mountain, that is) where the rock has
been blasted out. And there's a a big empty space in our lives
where you all used to be, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``The rock and you have both gone to win the war, and we are
proud of it. We buy bonds and work the gardens and save grease for
munitions, and chunk the home fires to keep them burning. Sometime
you'll be coming back and we'll be here, not much changed.''
</P>
<P>
   The second sheet tells of highway changes, the opening of school
and how some pond owners were helping to beat meat rationing by
draining the water out and inviting the neighbors to pick up the
fish. One bass was said to be so big the boys put a periscope in
him and ``played submarine till the water got too low to float
him.''
</P>
<P>
   Copies of ``Chips'' are on file at the DeKalb Historical Society
outside of Atlanta. Of Miss Jo herself, Margaret wrote: ``She was
certainly an inspiration and earned a warm spot in a lot of hearts,
both at home and in the services.''
</P>
<P>
   Now back to the Marines: Cliff J. Judkins, a former Marine
officer, wrote that he would like for the Leathernecks to be able
to take credit for the victory at Normandy, ``but the truth is,
they were 9,000 miles away, destroying the Japanese.''
</P>
<P>
   He adds: ``The U.S. Army, the British, the Free French and the
Canadians were responsible for the Victory on June 6, 1944, at
Normandy.''

 &HT;    Brownie fans on same wavelength
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 6: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Marcia Langhenry
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Eighteen people went straight to their files to respond to
Barbara Chamberlain's request for a brownie recipe that calls for a
can of Hershey's chocolate syrup.
</P>
<P>
   But Amy G. Weber of Lilburn, Georgia may have been the most
immediately motivated to respond _ she was eating one of those
brownies as she read Recipe Swap.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was the weirdest thing,'' said Weber, who credits her
mother, Ann D. Gage , with introducing her to the brownie more than
30 years ago. ``I had to call her right away and say they needed
that recipe.''
</P>
<P>
   Weber likes the brownies best with nuts, but often omits them
when making a batch for her small children.
</P>
<P>
   At Christmastime, her mother makes them with a creme de menthe
layer, a variation noted by others responding to the request.

 &HT;    Ear implant helps girl hear and talk
 &HT;    By Alma E. Hill
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Elizabeth Sweat is pretty proud of herself. She can talk.
</P>
<P>
   Most children take speaking for granted. But 7-year-old
Elizabeth was diagnosed shortly after birth with a profound hearing
impairment.
</P>
<P>
   She can hear now because she has had surgery to install a
``cochlear implant.'' The operation, which can cost more than
$25,000, involves inserting electrodes into the cochlea, or inner
ear.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, talking has been a challenge. Sound produced by
cochlear implants is not the same as the kind people with normal
hearing perceive.
</P>
<P>
   That's where an Atlanta institution called the Auditory
Education Center came in. When Elizabeth was 13 months old, her
parents enrolled her at the center, a nonprofit facility that
specializes in teaching hearing and speaking skills. It is one of
only five centers of its kind in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth tried various hearing aids before specialists and her
parents settled on the implant, which she received when she was 2.
</P>
<P>
   Now, during weekly visits to the center, Elizabeth practices
listening without reading lips or using other visual cues. Her
mother attends the sessions with her, so she can help her at home.
</P>
<P>
   And now, Elizabeth can talk as well as any other child her age.
</P>
<P>
   ``AEC is just so wonderful,'' she said. ``It teaches me I can
listen and speak.''
</P>
<P>
   Not all deaf people would say Elizabeth's experience is
wonderful. Many argue that cochlear implants and speech therapy are
unnatural intrusions into the deaf community's world of silence.
Implanting the devices in children _ a practice approved by the
federal government in 1990 _ draws particularly strong fire,
because kids can't make the decision for themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``Suppose you could make every deaf child into a hearing child.
You would destroy deaf culture,'' said Harlan Lane, a distinguished
professor at Northeastern University in Boston and an advocate for
the deaf.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the deaf world, with rare exception, people are proud to be
deaf and have no desire to change.''
</P>
<P>
   That feeling is not unanimous, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think any time a person has a chance to hear, that's just a
wonderful opportunity they shouldn't want to turn down,'' said
Winnie Hargis, coordinator of the Georgia chapter of Self-Help for
Hard of Hearing People.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth's parents have no regrets about their daughter's
therapy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our family is a hearing family. Our world is a hearing
world,'' said Catherine Sweat. ``She would not be able to talk to
her cousins or her grandparents. She would be isolated from all of
those who love her.''
</P>
<P>
   The center likes to work with young children, says CEO Margaret
Harms, because there is a short window of opportunity to teach them
language.
</P>
<P>
   ``If a child doesn't learn to speak by the time they are 6 to 8
years old, they will not learn to speak well. They can, but it's
difficult to do it,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The auditory center requires parents to conduct daily
``listening sessions'' at home, uninterrupted by outside
distractions, where the parent and child simply talk. The sessions
help children acquire language as naturally as possible, by
listening.
</P>
<P>
   Another requirement is that enrollees interact with hearing
children in school or preschool.
</P>
<P>
   The center works with adults as well as children, providing a
variety of services. For example, it sells hearing aids, phone
amplifying systems and other devices.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth won't be buying any of them. She is ready to graduate
from the center because she has learned to communicate with the
hearing world.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's almost no language to describe the experience,'' said
her therapist, Mary Ann Costin. ``She has truly become her own
person.''

 &HT;    COLUMN: Fear of food a hazard of modern age
 &HT;    (EMBARGOED UNTIL AUGUST 6: DO NOT USE BEFORE THEN)
 &HT;    By Lee May
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Detroit _ What a welcome. Flight-weary at about 2 p.m., I
staggered into the hotel lobby, confirmation number at the ready.
``Hmmm,'' said the desk woman, ``I'm sorry, but we don't seem to
have a reservation for you. Could it be in someone else's name?''
</P>
<P>
   I was about to assert that I'm not in the habit of reserving
rooms in someone else's name when I was interrupted in mid-smirk by
the sound of moans coming from behind me. Looking around, I saw,
sprawled in a plush leather chair, a thin young man, early 30s,
wearing an expensive white shirt, dark pants and a pained
expression, eyes walled back in his head.
</P>
<P>
   He looked and sounded awful. The clerk was a bit uncomfortable.
</P>
<P>
   Still trying to find my reservation (eventually, we decided to
just pretend I'd never made one and book, anew, one of the many
available rooms), she apologized for the delay and sheepishly
answered my query about the young man, who now was doubled over in
the chair, attended by an employee with an ice bucket and towel.
</P>
<P>
   ``You're the last person I should be telling this,'' said the
clerk, noting that I'm a journalist, ``but he says he has food
poisoning.''
</P>
<P>
   Where did he eat? In the hotel restaurant, she said. Chicken
salad sandwich.
</P>
<P>
   I'll remember not to have that, I said, heading to my room,
wondering how long it would take to get professional help for the
man.
</P>
<P>
   And thinking about how complex the simple act of eating has
become, how fraught with concern, even as modern conveniences such
as refrigerators and freezers ostensibly have diminished that
concern. How incongruous that in 1998 food poisoning seems scarier
than it did a quarter-century ago.
</P>
<P>
   This fear, centering on contamination by unsanitary produce
harvesters and handlers _ and on bacteria in everything from
egg-based mayonnaise to seafood _ makes you understand that, for
many, food is like sex: not enjoyed with abandon anymore.
</P>
<P>
   We're all acutely aware of the potential dangers of eating. Many
diners these days see one of my favorites, sushi, as a kind of
Japanese roulette, consumed at your own risk. Similarly, whenever I
eat raw clams or oysters, other eaters shoot me looks that seem to
express two sentiments: ``You're a brave man'' and ``I pity the
fool.''
</P>
<P>
   Not long ago, these foods, like steak tartare, were not seen as
risky eating. And in the 1980s I thought nothing of eating goat
roasted in the streets of Cairo, Egypt, or raw green salad in San
Salvador. I'd think twice about either these days.
</P>
<P>
   What happened?
</P>
<P>
   Maybe, like so many other problems, food-related illnesses get
magnified by myriad media that spread the bad news _ and therefore,
fear _ around the world in seconds.
</P>
<P>
   It's not all perception; there are problems to be magnified.
People do get sick.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps our science and technology, capable of treating or
preventing horrific illnesses, have dazzled us so much, we've
gotten sloppy with the basic stuff: washing knives that cut meat or
fish before using them on other foods, throwing away food that
stays unrefrigerated too long. Practicing simple bathroom hygiene.
</P>
<P>
   As Lyn puts it, ``All the technology in the world can't compete
with a bar of soap.''
</P>
<P>
   The last time I saw the young man in the hotel lobby, he was
sweating profusely, mumbling unintelligibly. I don't know if he
really was food-poisoned, but I tell you this: No chicken salad
passed my lips in this town.

 &HT;    Where history breathes
 &HT;    By Alan Patureau
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   With the phenomenal movie ``Saving Private Ryan'' thrusting the
horror of war anew into the public mind, a trip to the recently
opened National Prisoner of War Museum becomes an even more
poignant experience.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no doubt this is a brutal story; it's not Disney
World,'' says Fred Boyles, superintendent of the Andersonville(Ga.)
National Historic Site. ``But a lot of kids and adults are coming
here, as well as former POWs. They want to see the sacrifices some
Americans have made for this country.''
</P>
<P>
   Previously Andersonville was a low-key attraction, an infamous
Civil War prison site, cemetery and historic village. But since the
nation's only POW museum opened April 9, crammed with artifacts,
photos, interactive videos and multimedia exhibits on all U.S.
wars, area visitation has doubled to almost 20,000 a month.
</P>
<P>
   Even the exterior of the 10,000-square-foot memorial sets a
foreboding mood. It looks like a bleak prison, with bars on windows
and dark towers where armed guards might stand. A courtyard
contains a stark brick wall and a jagged stream symbolizing
wretched Sweetwater Creek in the nearby Civil War camp where 12,920
Union prisoners died. Water _ a precious commodity to POWs through
the ages _ trickles through the hands of a sculptured prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   In the eight rooms, hundreds of images tell the story of
America's 800,000 POWs since 1776. You see examples of things all
prisoners shared _ pain and torture, fear and hunger, loneliness
and boredom, ingenuity, defiance, the rare escape.
</P>
<P>
   In one grim exhibit, guns from several wars jut out of the wall.
Cocking sounds are heard when a sensor detects a visitor entering
the room. A spotlight flashes, sirens scream and a video shows
American POWs.
</P>
<P>
   The floors are gray granite to suggest the hardness of prison
life, Boyles says. There are giant pictures of prisoners being
marched to captivity _ on one side in wintry Korea, on the other in
the blazing heat of the Bataan Death March. There's a re-creation
of an infamous bamboo ``tiger cage'' holding an anguished GI
prisoner in Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting on benches with their families, kids seem fascinated
watching a half-dozen screens showing action and interviews.
High-profile prisoners such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona and
Admiral James Stockdale (Ross Perot's running mate in 1992) tell of
being stripped, tortured and left in chains.
</P>
<P>
   ``Oh, man, this is quite a show,'' said one visitor, Ken
Gallager of Silver Spring, Md., comparing the emotional impact with
the National Holocaust Museum in Washington.
</P>
<P>
   The quiet heroics of POWs can bring goose bumps. On one video,
two men explain the tap code devised for communication between
prisoners in Vietnam, with each letter of the alphabet assigned a
number of taps. Once when a pig pen was installed next door, they
sent tap messages by oinking like a pig, and their captors never
caught on.
</P>
<P>
   A defiantly amusing 1967 photo shows the captured crew of the
USS Pueblo _ each man with the middle finger extended on one hand.
They had convinced their captors this was a ``Hawaiian good luck
gesture'' and would enhance a propaganda picture.
</P>
<P>
   The Andersonville prison is one of many important pieces in this
mosaic. You see an original pine log from the Andersonville
stockade wall; a ``shebang'' or tent the prisoners fashioned from
blankets; a POW's flour sack uniform.
</P>
<P>
   Information: The POW museum, on Ga. 49 a mile north of
Andersonville village, is open 8:30 a.m.-5 p.m. daily except
Thanksgiving, Christmas and New Year's Day. Free. 912-924-0343.
</P>
<P>
   Other Andersonville attractions:
</P>
<P>
   -- Village of Andersonville: Contains the Drummer Boy Museum
with a diorama of the Civil War prison camp, train depot/welcome
center, antique shops and pioneer farm. Call 912-924-2558. The
down-home Andersonville Restaurant serves lunch daily. The annual
Andersonville Historic Fair is scheduled Oct. 3-4 with a Civil War
parade and battle re-enactments.
</P>
<P>
   -- National Historic Site and Cemetery: Near the POW Museum is
the 26-acre site of the Andersonville Civil War prison where up to
33,000 men were jammed. There's a reconstructed section of the log
wall, sentry towers and the ``dead line,'' a
</P>
<P>
   four-foot railing inside the wall, beyond which prisoners would
be shot. Nearby, the quiet cemetery punctuated with magnolia trees
is especially touching, with its sea of 12,920 gravestones only
inches apart. Now, veterans of all wars can be interred here. Same
hours as the POW Museum.
</P>
<P>
   PLAINS, GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   It's been 17 years since Jimmy Carter left the White House, and
tourists still trickle in to this almost movie-set village that the
39th president calls home. The National Park Service logged 55,000
visitors last year, about 150 per day. That's peanuts compared to
the 5,000 a day who often jammed the town while Carter was
president.
</P>
<P>
   Yet today ``the visitor experience is more enjoyable, there's
more to see,'' says park ranger Pat Recker of the Jimmy Carter
National Historic Site.
</P>
<P>
   The main attraction is the restored redbrick Plains High School,
which reopened on Oct. 1, 1996, Carter's 72nd birthday, as a
visitor center/museum showcasing Carter memorabilia. But it's not
just a hall of fame for ``Jimmy Who?'' _ it also tells the tale of
the small town that spawned him.
</P>
<P>
   As you approach the old school with its gleaming white columns,
you wonder what values Carter, class of '41, learned here that led
him to the presidency. And the $4 million investment has made it
easy to find out.
</P>
<P>
   Just inside the main entrance you get the first hint. Principal
Julia Coleman's office has been restored with 1930s phones and
office equipment, plus her prize bust of Shakespeare. ``Miss
Julia'' introduced country boy Carter to great books, art and
music. Her favorite exhortation is framed on the wall: ``We have to
be prepared for the outside world. In a country as great as ours,
any schoolboy, even one of ours, can grow up to be president of the
United States.''
</P>
<P>
   Down the hall, where the aroma of well-oiled wooden floors stirs
old-timers' memories, a typical classroom boasts rows of school
desks _ with holes for inkwells. No doubt Carter and his future
wife Rosalynn, class of '44 valedictorian, used some of these
graffiti-carved benches. And no wonder the windows were so tall;
there were no electric lights.
</P>
<P>
   Three rooms are filled with hundreds of photos and artifacts
from Carter's boyhood, professional life and busy post-presidency.
You'll see a bamboo broom used to sweep grassless yards. A photo of
Jimmy at 9, riding his colt Lady Lee. A scrapbook display of
students ``learning how to introduce a friend.'' A paddle used to
discipline students.
</P>
<P>
   There's Carter on a 1977 Time cover as the magazine's Man of the
Year. The oak podium friends built for his campaign. A dazzling
gift from Yasser Arafat _ a pearl sculpture of the Last Supper,
with the Palestinian leader's business card below. Maps and photos
from Carter's globe-trotting diplomatic missions and Habitat for
Humanity projects. And one of his fly-fishing rods.
</P>
<P>
   Amid the nostalgia, the museum doesn't hide that the school was
segregated until 1966. In a video Carter recalls his childhood
puzzlement that his pal and neighbor Milton Raven had to go to a
different school.
</P>
<P>
   Inside the 300-seat auditorium, a Carter documentary is shown,
narrated by Charles Kuralt. This is also where Miss Julia presided
over morning chapel, and the community gathered for special
occasions _ and still does: During the annual Plains Peanut
Festival, Sept. 24-26, the original folk play ``If These Sidewalks
Could Talk,'' by Kim Carter Fuller, Billy Carter's daughter, will
be staged here.
</P>
<P>
   The high school is open 9 a.m.-5 p.m. daily, free admission,
call 912-824-3413.
</P>
<P>
   Other Plains sights include:
</P>
<P>
   -- Old railroad depot: It became Carter's 1976 campaign
headquarters because, ``Frankly, it was the only available building
in town with a bathroom,'' says tour guide Jody Monts, 31, who
attended grade school with Amy Carter. The 110-year-old station was
spiffed up and reopened last fall with an exhibit on the 1976
campaign. Photos and memorabilia include a ``Grits and Fritz''
button and a Columbus newspaper with the banner headline ``Carter
Wins.''
</P>
<P>
   -- The Carter compound: Behind a 12-foot metal fence (it once
surrounded Richard Nixon's Key Biscayne, Fla., estate) you can
barely glimpse the 3,000-square-foot brick ranch house off Church
Street (U.S. 280) where the Carters live about two-thirds of the
time. A Secret Service sentry post and gate block the access
street, Woodland Drive. You're better off going back to the high
school and watching Carter narrate a video tour of the home.
</P>
<P>
   -- Maranatha Baptist Church: On ``suburban'' Buena Vista Road (a
half-mile from the depot), this is where Carter teaches Sunday
school about twice a month. The Park Service posts his schedule a
month in advance. For his 10 a.m. appearances, up to 600 visitors
jam the main sanctuary and several classrooms where TV monitors
carry his lectures.
</P>
<P>
   -- Billy Carter's service station: Closed and moldering, this
symbol of small-town culture was presided over by the rambunctious
first brother from 1972 to 1981. A nearby BP station now
overshadows it on Church Street near the depot.
</P>
<P>
   -- Tours and peanuts: Plain Peanuts Inc., a few doors down on
Main Street, sells peanuts and gives the only sightseeing tours of
Plains. Vans driven by gossipy, down-home guides leave 9 a.m.-5
p.m. daily; $5. 912-824-3462. At the high school, the National Park
Service offers a 45-minute audio tape for your self-guided tour (to
rent $1, for sale $5).
</P>
<P>
   -- Where to eat: Flash! There are now two eateries in town.
Plains Family Restaurant just opened on Church Street (in front of
the high school campus), serving three meals and buffets 6 a.m.-9
p.m. daily. Scarlett's Cafe &AMP; Gift Shop, on the quaint downtown
block of Main Street, sells sandwiches and Beanie Babies.
</P>
<P>
   -- Where to stay: Plains Bed &AMP; Breakfast Inn, a Victorian
mansion and the town's only lodgings, has four antique-filled
rooms; $65. ``Earl and Lillian Carter lived there in 1924 when they
sparked Jimmy,'' tour guide Monts declares. Or as a plaque by the
room puts it, ``... while Mrs. Carter was expecting the future
president.'' A public tearoom, the Magnolia and Ivy, opened last
week in the living room. Call proprietor Grace Jackson at
912-824-7252.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICUS, GEORGIA
</P>
<P>
   Andersonville and Plains are long on history but short on
amenities. To the rescue of visitors taking a couple of days to
tour the area is the wondrous Windsor Hotel, a 61-room Victorian
castle with a mix of towers, turrets, verandas, wicker rockers,
palms, chandeliers, a three-story atrium and rambling hardwood
hallways.
</P>
<P>
   Miraculously, this showplace was built in the heart of Americus
in 1892, at Lamar and Forsyth streets, and it's still flourishing
after a loving restoration in 1991. Room rates are reasonable, too
_ from $70 for a double room with 12-foot ceilings to $159 for the
Carter Presidential Suite.
</P>
<P>
   The former president has missed a treat by never staying in the
spacious circular suite occupying one floor of the hotel's tallest
tower. It boasts soaring windows, king-size bed, antique chifforobe
and chest, a divan, easy chairs, two coffee tables, flowers,
billiard-green carpet and classic tile bath.
</P>
<P>
   The Grand Dining Room, also cheerfully Victorian, serves a
succulent crab claw with filet mignon or chicken breast. Floyd's
Pub is a lively bar for a town of 18,000. Call the hotel at
912-924-1555.
</P>
<P>
   Americus is a college town, with 2,800 students at Georgia
Southwestern State University. Habitat for Humanity is
headquartered here, offering daily tours of its surprisingly large
``back lot'' of factories and model houses. And a 1920s movie
palace, the 630-seat Rylander Theater, is being restored and will
reopen next summer.
</P>
<P>
   IF YOU GO
</P>
<P>
   -- Getting there: Andersonville is 140 miles south of Atlanta
via I-75 to the Henderson exit, then west on Ga. 26 to Oglethorpe
and south on Ga. 49. You'll see ``Andersonville Trail'' signs.
Americus is 10 miles farther south on Ga. 49. Plains is 10 miles
southwest of Americus on U.S. 280.
</P>
<P>
   -- Information: For reservations and brochures about Americus,
Andersonville and Plains, call the Americus-Sumter County Tourism
Council, 1-888-278-6837.

 &HT;    Seinfeld Speaks: The comedian on standup, his TV show, and
everything else
 &HT;    By Drew Jubera
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Just when you thought the world was finally safe from Seinfeld
... more Seinfeld.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry Seinfeld makes his first TV appearance _ not counting
``Seinfeld'' reruns _ since his NBC sitcom shut down last May when
HBO airs a live stand-up concert Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   His ``I'm Telling You for the Last Time: Live on Broadway'' (9
p.m. EDT) will be the last of 10 shows he'll perform, starting
tonight, at the Broadhurst Theater in New York. Seinfeld is
retiring material performed during the years he's become the
country's most successful funnyman. The Broadway show ends a
worldwide tour begun after the final ``Seinfeld'' episode, this
year's most-watched (and most-hyped) TV show. Proceeds from ticket
sales go to children's charities.
</P>
<P>
   Seinfeld talked Tuesday at a news conference in New York about
his past, present and future. Here's a sampling:
</P>
<P>
   Why haven't you taken a vacation? Stand-up for me is not work.
It's liberating. Putting on a weekly TV show is complicated and
demanding. Stand-up is the best way for me to feel free and
relaxed. I've been to beaches. I've been on boats. It's pleasant,
but it's not really fun.
</P>
<P>
   Any surprises in the Broadway performance? I would like to list
all the surprises so there are no surprises.
</P>
<P>
   Do you have a new stand-up act ready after you retire your old
one? No. That'll take eight months to a year before I'm ready to do
another concert. (laughs) Depending on how hard I work.
</P>
<P>
   What's it been like not having to go to your TV show? Ever take
a dog into the park and take his leash off? He looks up at you for
a second, then just bolts like a maniac. It's been something like
that.
</P>
<P>
   Scalpers are getting $1,500 for a ticket to your show. Is it a
good deal at $1,500? If you have $1,500 to spend on a ticket,
you're beyond good deals.
</P>
<P>
   Does the scalping bother you? Isn't that money that could have
been spent on kids? There's crime, it does bother me, and as a
comedian I realize it's important for me to fight crime wherever I
see it. But I don't know if I'm the person best equipped to handle
this situation. Telling jokes from the stage, it's hard to change
the criminal mind-set.
</P>
<P>
   You've talked about getting into advertising. I started that
talk. It was just talk at the time. Maybe someday. I enjoy creative
commercials. What's always interested me is they're so short.
</P>
<P>
   Do you regret any ``Seinfeld'' episodes? Like the Puerto Rican
parade episode? No. The Puerto Rican parade episode is one of my
favorites. I found the flap around (it) amusing, it was so stupid.
People manipulating it into an issue was pretty weak.
</P>
<P>
   You hosted 400 public school kids at a Mets game (Monday). You
want to continue to work with New York City kids? We'll see how
those kids turn out. If they become scalpers or journalists, I'll
reconsider.
</P>
<P>
   Did it become more difficult to do ``Seinfeld'' in L.A.? Yes. I
felt the writers were deprived of stimulation. They were working
from a memory of living. If we wrote the show in New York, when you
walk to work, you would have seen something. That's where you get
ideas as a writer. In L.A., you're less involved with the general
public. The second I got back to New York, I felt like I woke up.
</P>
<P>
   How do you feel about the sex shops closing on Broadway? Just my
luck.
</P>
<P>
   Why'd you give people their money back in Des Moines (Iowa)?
(Seinfeld returned the $60 charge to ticket holders at his shows
there last month) It seemed like fun and I could afford it. It was
the last stop on the tour, we were in Des Moines and the idea
popped into my head. I had a little peephole in my dressing room
into the lobby, so I got to see each person hear this news. People
were like, ``What?'' Then they'd break into a big smile. It was
worth it. It was about making people feel a little better.
</P>
<P>
   You think criticism of your last show was fair? Criticism is
always fair. What people forget is it's unimportant. Everybody's
allowed to criticize, it's what an audience does. And every
audience member is of equal value, whether or not they have a
typewriter.
</P>
<P>
   Would you do another series? I can't imagine I was as lucky as I
was the first time, and only an idiot could imagine I'd be that
lucky again.
</P>
<P>
   You have a favorite memory from ``Seinfeld''? Tough to say, but
I have this image that's hard to get out of my head when we filmed
the marble rye episode. We spent a lot of money on that episode, we
were filming it on the Parmount back lot, bringing in fake snow. We
were up all night filming Kramer with the horse, and there were
snowball fights with the crew, and I remember trying to throw the
bread up to Jason (Alexander) in the window at 5 in the morning.
Throwing snowballs, it's 5 in the morning, trying to throw a marble
rye up in a window _ I just thought, ``This is show business.

CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM BACKERS JOCKEY TO KEEP BILL ALIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By BOB HOHLER  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Backers of a sweeping plan to overhaul the nation's
campaign finance system continued jockeying Tuesday to keep their
bill alive, even though majorities in the House and Senate have
endorsed the measure.
</P>
<P>
   The latest chapter in the struggle unfolded as House sponsors of
the overhaul plan _ Representatives Martin T. Meehan, a
Massachusetts Democrat, and Christopher Shays, a Connecticut
Republican _ tried to siphon support from a competing bill that
could sink their proposal as early as Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Under a rare procedure devised by House Republican leaders, the
Shays-Meehan bill will die if the alternative plan, sponsored by a
group of freshman lawmakers, receives more votes than Shays-Meehan,
which passed Monday, 237-186.
</P>
<P>
   Negotiations were under way last night to schedule votes on the
freshman bill and three other alternative plans before the House
recesses on Friday.
</P>
<P>
   If the Shays-Meehan plan survives, the victory would occur six
months after 52 members of the 100-member Senate endorsed a nearly
identical proposal. The Senate effort died when supporters could
not muster the 60 votes needed to defeat a Republican-led
filibuster.
</P>
<P>
   ``All along the process, opponents and the Republican leadership
have tried every possible shenanigan to try to defeat campaign
finance reform,'' said Ann McBride, president of Common Cause.
``But this is the bill that would not die.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet major obstacles still abound. In the House, Republican
leaders, who vigorously oppose Shays-Meehan, Tuesday were urging
the GOP rank-and-file to vote for the freshman bill as a way to
kill the overhaul plan.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Shays-Meehan supporters grew increasingly concerned
that Democratic leaders, including President Clinton, had yet to
actively rally opposition to the freshman bill.
</P>
<P>
   Meehan said he was trying to reach Clinton before he meets this
morning with House Democrats, when Clinton is expected to address
the issue. ``I'm going to urge the president to be very strong in
favor of our bill and to recommend that Democratic members vote no
or present on the freshman bill,'' Meehan said.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill would ban the unlimited, unregulated
``soft money'' donations that were at the center of fund-raising
scandals in the 1996 elections.
</P>
<P>
   The freshman bill would ban soft money contributions to national
parties but permit their continued flow to state parties. Critics
assert that state parties would divert soft money to federal
elections, effectively sustaining the status quo.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton, who has consistently supported the Shays-Meehan bill,
has not voiced a position on the freshman bill, whose chief
sponsors are Representatives Asa Hutchinson, an Arkansas
Republican, and Tom Allen, a Maine Democrat. Clinton and Allen have
been friends since they attended Oxford University as Rhodes
scholars nearly 30 years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Allen, who voted for the Shays-Meehan plan, said Tuesday he will
also vote for the freshman bill partly to keep allegiance with
colleagues who have helped push the bill for the last 18 months.
</P>
<P>
   Hutchinson urged House members to join them, arguing that the
freshman bill has a better chance of passing the Senate than
Shays-Meehan and less chance of the Supreme Court overturning parts
of it.
</P>
<P>
   Senate Republican leaders have vowed to continue to block the
Senate version of the Shays-Meehan bill, which is sponsored by
Senators John McCain, an Arizona Republican, and Russell Feingold,
a Wisconsin Democrat.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Feingold said Monday night's House vote would revive the
Senate push for passage. ``When we reconvene this September, I
intend to make sure we have that chance,'' Feingold said Tuesday.
``With a majority vote in both houses of Congress, this bill is on
a roll.''
</P>
<P>
   In a rare boost to the Shays-Meehan bill, sponsors of five
competing measures in the House agreed Tuesday to withdraw their
plans, including Representatives John F. Tierney, a Massachusetts
Democrat, and Charles F. Bass, a New Hampshire Republican. Both
said they did not want to hurt the Shays-Meehan plan's chances for
final passage.

 &HT;    Music concert not hoping to be the biggest, but a ``better
schmoozefest''
 &HT;    By Steve Dollar
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA -- Does the world really need another music conference?
</P>
<P>
   ``Every music conference I've actually had a band play in, I've
had a miserable experience,'' says Mark Willis, an Atlanta-based
promoter who hopes to learn from those experiences this week. As
one of three partners launching the Atlantis '98 Music Conference _
the inaugural event begins today _ Willis intends to improve on the
formula behind such annual rock-a-thons as South by Southwest in
Austin, Texas, and the CMJ New Music Showcase in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He wants to build a better schmoozefest: one that bands, fans
and industry types can enjoy without complaint. ``We're not trying
to be the biggest, we're not trying to use more venues than other
conferences,'' he says. ``We want to do one thing really well, and
that's the music.''
</P>
<P>
   The event will stage performances by 170 bands _ including about
70 from Atlanta _ at 11 venues, mostly around Virginia-Highland and
Little Five Points. It also includes recording industry parties and
20-plus panel discussions. Topics range from the ironic (''Music
Conferences: Are We Ripping You Off?'') to the practical, such as a
how-to session with members of the popular college-rock band Sister
Hazel and its management team.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is going to be a rolling four-day party,'' says Willis,
who is producing the conference with partners Rich Levy, a talent
buyer for concert promoters Cellar Door in Atlanta, and
entertainment lawyer Lee B. Reitchman. ``We wanted to be the
platform for discovery. Atlanta's venues, and the way Little Five
Points and Virginia-Highland are laid out, make it the perfect area
to do this.''
</P>
<P>
   Confabs such as Atlantis '98 are designed as a way for music
acts, typically unsigned to a label or looking for a new deal, to
showcase their songs for producers, promoters and
artist-and-repertory representatives. Clubgoers can reap benefits,
because stages feature several bands in a night. Purchase of a $25
three-day pass means fans can hit as many participating venues _
such as the Dark Horse Tavern or Variety Playhouse _ as they can
fit into their evening. Willis hopes to attract 15,000 to 20,000
people over the course of the event, which kicks off today with a
golf tournament at Chateau Elan. (A schedule is listed at the
event's Web site: http://www.atlantismusic.com)
</P>
<P>
   ``Not every band can be accepted to South by Southwest.
(Atlantis) allows you to witness a lot of unsigned bands and a lot
of talent in that region of the country that you may not normally
have a chance to see,'' says Mike Faley, president of Metal Blade
Records in Simi Valley, Calif., whose acts have included the early
Goo Goo Dolls and Cannibal Corpse. ``You're coming down hoping to
find that diamond in the rough.''
</P>
<P>
   Even bands that have established a career can use the potential
boost the conference offers. ``We're fishing for bigger fish,''
says Joy Waters, bassist for the Atlanta band Seely, which performs
Thursday at the Purgatory room in Masquerade, a popular rock venue
on North Avenue. The group, which has released two CDs on the
British label Too Pure!, has freed itself from its contract and
would like to sign with a new label.
</P>
<P>
   ``Great things have come out of these for us,'' Waters said.
``But it's not fun. It's never fun. I never felt like people are
there to be into it. They're there to take notes. It's a
scratching-the-goatee kind of audience.''
</P>
<P>
   Of course, it all depends on which side of the stage you're on.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's rare that you get (the industry) to focus on music of
city,'' says Harvey Schwartz, an A&AMP;R representative for Capricorn
Records. ``Atlanta has proven to be a vital musical city. It's a
good thing. There's a huge music community and they will come out
and do their thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Atlantis '98 Music Conference
</P>
<P>
   Today-Saturday. Atlanta, Ga.. $125 registration fee or $25 for
three-day ``wristband'' pass. 770-499-8600.

 &HT;    ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' invades America: summer replacement
show looks like a winner
 &HT;    By Bob Longino
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   For years, America's staunchest couch potatoes have been
watching Britain's improv import ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' on
cable and laughing.
</P>
<P>
   So it was really only a matter of time until a network like ABC
launched its own version. And what better ham to host than the
network's funniest sitcom star Drew Carey?
</P>
<P>
   It almost works like a charm.
</P>
<P>
   The Americanized ``Whose Line,'' debuting tonight after ``The
Drew Carey Show,'' is almost as funny as the Brit original with a
trio of veteran ``Line'' guys _ Ryan Stiles, Colin Mochrie and Greg
Proops _ plus Wayne Brady doing improvisational bits to situations
sometimes dreamed up by the studio audience.
</P>
<P>
   It's all rapid-fire visual jokes and quit-witted quips. In one
segment, Proops has to pretend to be a party host and guess what
guest roles the other fellas have been instructed to act out. In
this case: one's acting like an accident-prone circus performer,
another plays a guy in a slow-motion fight scene and the third
(he's the lucky one) has the role of a foal being born.
</P>
<P>
   It works. What doesn't is the pumped-up volume added to the
audience's applause-and-roar track. And one does wonder why Drew
Carey's here. Thirteen cutaway shots to a chuckling Carey seems
like a waste of a good talent.
</P>
<P>
   But during the heat of summer reruns, we'll take fresh laughs
like this anyway we can get it.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whose Line Is It Anyway?'' Grade: B
</P>
<P>
   9:30 p.m. EDT on ABC

COMMENTARY: GET THE HOOK  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By FRANK RICH    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Show business is a cruel business. When your act is toast, you
get the hook. On the same day that Linda Tripp was giving her ``I'm
just like you'' speech, bulldozers were razing O.J. Simpson's $4
million manse for its proud new owner in Brentwood. Remember when
every room, every window, every pebble of gravel on that estate was
diagrammed in magazine spreads, on Web sites and in the
wall-to-wall jurisprudence of Court TV? Now its final destiny as
just another L.A. teardown barely merited a media mention, let
alone a sentimental sigh. The O.J. soap opera had long since been
canceled, so the house was just another set being struck.
Unburdened by memory, America, once bored, is always on to the next
good show.
</P>
<P>
   If there's any happy news about the final chapter of the
Clinton-Lewinsky saga, it is that its resolution will bring the
demise of its own accompanying circus. We never thought we'd be rid
of Lance Ito, Kato Kaelin, Al Cowlings, Robert Shapiro, Faye
Resnick, Dennis Fung, Paula Barbieri, Chris Darden, Robert
Kardashian and Rosa Lopez _ but where are they now? Their books
have been remaindered, and even Court TV seems to have faded into
the sunset. In the coming weeks we can look forward to similar
fates for Lanny Davis and Bob Barr, Richard Ben-Veniste and Joseph
diGenova, for every talking head with a theory about the ``talking
points'' and for every blond ``former prosecutor'' who tries to
mimic Laura Ingraham.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, it's survival of the fittest out there as the
principals battle to see which few of them _ like O.J. ingenues
Greta Van Susteren and Jeffrey Toobin _ will still be standing in
the media marketplace when this frenzy is over and the next begins.
In a country where DNA evidence is king, only Barry Scheck is
guaranteed full employment.
</P>
<P>
   As with any show on its last legs, Monicagate is getting ugly.
On ``Politically Incorrect'' last week, Bill Maher and Matt Drudge
turned on each other, engaging in a testy squabble over who had
most accurately cited President Clinton's recent poll numbers;
another guest, the newly spawned political prognosticator Eartha
Kitt, almost had to step in as referee. Drudge's own weekly TV
show, with its recurrent guest Lucianne Goldberg joined last
weekend by Dick Morris, is now aspiring to be network news's answer
to the bar scene in ``Star Wars.'' Then there's Mrs. Tripp, who no
sooner complained about the threats to her own employment by the
Clinton White House than she struck at the jobs of those in the
``entertainment industry'' who have ridiculed her. John Goodman had
better hustle if he has any aspirations to co-star with Nathan Lane
(as Lucianne) in a timely parody of ``Some Like It Hot.''
</P>
<P>
   This story has been going on so long that there's already been
turnover in much of the cast. We never thought either Susan
Carpenter-McMillan or William Ginsburg could be pried away from TV
cameras, but their acts got stale and they were ruthlessly exiled
to sideshow status; it's only a matter of time before they suffer
the ultimate indignity of turning up as the cable TV equivalent of
landfill _ in reruns on MSNBC's ``Time and Again.'' No less nasty
has been the networks' treatment of Stuart Taylor Jr., a legal
sound-bite pro who has now been largely shunted aside on Sunday
mornings for a younger, glibber model, Jonathan Turley _ in an
``All About Eve'' scenario reminiscent of Deborah Norville's
usurping of Jane Pauley.
</P>
<P>
   For those who pray that a little more entertainment can be
squeezed out of what remains of the scandal, there's scant hope.
Should Bill Clinton actually deliver a Checkers-Swaggart mea culpa,
it had better be a whole lot more titillating than the one already
written for him by Leon Panetta, Orrin Hatch et al. (For
politicians and pundits, writing drafts of this speech seems to be
more popular than playing Powerball.) There's also the faint
possibility that Kenneth Starr could subpoena real show-business
stars in whom the president might have confided at the Hamptons
last weekend _ a sexier-than-Bruce-Lindsey cast that includes
Steven Spielberg, Chevy Chase, Alec Baldwin, Christie Brinkley and
Billy Joel.
</P>
<P>
   But a more likely scenario is the O.J. denouement: an abrupt
final curtain that leaves half the country angry at the other half,
tosses a bevy of TV rent-a-lawyers out of work, and sentences
either defendant or prosecutor (or both) to a lifetime of playing
golf.

SANTA FE OPERA HAS NEW LOOK 
</HEADLINE>
 FE-OPERA-AZR   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By KENNETH LAFAVE  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SANTA FE - ``Salome'' didn't sing to the real moon this year.
</P>
<P>
   But she was heard more clearly.
</P>
<P>
   The 1978 Santa Fe production of Richard Strauss' one-act
masterpiece produced a phenomenon unique to Santa Fe that will
never be forgotten by those of who were there. As the opera's
characters sang about the moon, it appeared to be the real moon
they sang about: The audience could see the lunar orb through the
gaping space between the covered stage and the roofed balcony.
</P>
<P>
   It was something that could only happen at Santa Fe Opera, which
was, and seemingly always would be, open-air.
</P>
<P>
   ``Always'' came to an end this year, with the completion of a
massive renovation of the legendary building. The entire audience
chamber is now roofed over, and other, more subtle changes have
been made.
</P>
<P>
   Alterations were necessary due to changing weather patterns.
Time was, brief showers refreshed Santa Fe regularly in the late
afternoon and dispersed in time for sunset. Exceptions were few,
and such rain as fell was light and short-lived. But by the early
1990s, the weather gods, having been taken for granted, sought
revenge. For this critic personally, a rain-swamped ``Rake's
Progress'' in 1996 was the end. The company's patrons had already
had their fill; that year, work began.
</P>
<P>
   The result is a marvel of imaginative design and acoustic
enrichment. I didn't miss the moon one whit as this year's
``Salome'' cast sang the bloodily sexy inflections of Strauss'
score, because I could hear everything so much more vividly _ and
this in spite of musical direction by John Crosby that gave the
orchestra too much dynamic leeway.
</P>
<P>
   This greater sonic clarity owes to acoustician Jack Purcell, who
was in on the design for the first, tiny Santa Fe Opera in 1958
(which sat 485 people on benches) and the second one, the
1,889-seater we all came to love and, occasionally, swim in. For
this third go-around, Purcell designed a new, curved roof to
connect to the old one (over the stage only) and the balcony to
serve as ``an acoustical mirror,'' producing ``as short an initial
time delay as possible.'' He also placed 45 acoustic deflectors
over the stage and audience chamber.
</P>
<P>
   The new roof is hung from a steel structure called ``rods and
mast.'' Maybe that's why, from Interstate 25, driving north out of
Santa Fe, the Opera no longer looks like a gigantic wing poised to
fly, but like a sailing ship in dock.
</P>
<P>
   Once arrived, you notice the old stairs that led to the
ticket-takers have been replaced by a smooth ramp. Inside, the
changes accelerate. The gift shop is bigger and located inside. The
audience chamber has been enlarged _ without apparent harm to
sightlines _ to seat 227 more operagoers. The house is still open
to the sides, preserving some of the old feeling of a festival in
the desert, but seven towering baffles to the west deflect wind,
reducing noise and keeping the chill off as the night progresses.
</P>
<P>
   These are positive, opera-enhancing changes. Too bad something
wasn't done about parking. Getting to the opera still involves
traversing a half-mile snake-trail from I-25 to a pair of parking
lots where you may end up walking 10 minutes to the entrance.
Getting out is a test of wills and tempers: Never let anybody tell
you opera-goers don't have fingers.
</P>
<P>
   None of this stops Santa Fe Opera from being intensely popular.
There were full houses all three nights I went to hear ``Salome,''
Berlioz's ``Beatrice and Benedict'' and a new staging of ``Magic
Flute'' by Jonathan Miller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Beatrice and Benedict'' is a rarity, known by most only for
its scintillating overture, popular on symphony programs. That
overture leads to one of Berlioz's most delightful scores, a take
on Shakespeare's ``Much Ado About Nothing,'' with a trimmed plot
that focuses almost solely on the opera's title characters.
</P>
<P>
   Here is Berlioz in his ``Les nuits d'Ete'' mode, lighthearted
and full of atmospheric harmonies. Curious that Berlioz, he of the
epic ``Les Troyens,'' would end his operatic career wit h an
old-fashioned number opera, but that's what ``Beatrice and
Benedict'' is _ and what numbers these are! There's a wittily
off-centered drinking song, a glowing trio for three women, and an
ineffable nocturne in the form of a bassless chorus with, of all
things, guitar accompaniment.
</P>
<P>
   It was sung in sparkling English, with huge chunks of dialogue
between numbers, and given a 19th-century context by director Tim
Albery and designer Antony McDonald. Edo de Waart conducted briskly
and with rhythmic snap.
</P>
<P>
   Mezzo-soprano Susan Graham, prepared by numerous trouser roles
(Cherubino, the Composer in ``Ariadne,'' etc.) for the part of the
George Sand-like Beatrice, was a smoldering onstage presence and a
voice of great warmth and expressivity. Her Benedict was tenor
Gordon Gietz, who displayed an open and easy sound and a dashing
manner. Lyric soprano Elizabeth Futral sang Hero with beauty and
character, and mezzo Nancy Maultsby brought strength to the role of
Ursula.
</P>
<P>
   Singing opera in English is dangerous, because the assumption
that it will be understood is easily subverted by acoustics, overly
modified vowels, or both. Yet the English of both ``Beatrice and
Benedict'' and Mozart's ``Magic Flute'' was crystalline and
hearable without any strain.
</P>
<P>
   The ``Flute'' translation was credited to one Jeremy Sams and
copyrighted 1987. It was so perfectly suited to modern ears and
temperaments that one could excuse rhymes like ``Pamina'' with
``misdemean-ah,'' given to Monostatos. But it had to have been
changed considerably for content by director Miller, who boldly,
honestly, and ultimately wrong-headedly set Mozart's fable of light
and dark in the lobby of a 1920s European resort hotel. The Art
Deco set by Roni Toren and matching costumes by Judy Levin looked
great as the visual context for a Gershwin musical.
</P>
<P>
   I think of Miller as the best, most consistent of directors who
favor updatings of this sort. But ``Magic Flute'' resists, not so
much updating, as any dating whatsoever. Its real time and place
are mythical, non-dimensional. Miller's placement of the action
meant that, as the opera opened, Tamino's dragon was not a literal
fire-breather but an unseen nightmare. It meant that Papageno _
anachronistically still tootling on pan-pipes _ was a butler, not a
birdcatcher, but with bird references sewn into the text, the Three
Ladies became ``the birds.'' There was a lot of stretching going
on, both of ``Flute'' and, one assumes, Sams' translation, but it
all sort of worked _ until the animals.
</P>
<P>
   In a non-updated _ or non-dated _ ``Flute,'' when Tamino plays
the title instrument, all the animals come out. But why should they
emerge from the doors of a resort hotel? Yet emerge they did,
looking ludicrously out of place. From that point on, Miller's
conceit seemed without point, as the plot's battle between the
sexes was reduced to a squabble between a group of mixed-genre
partiers (Sarastro's bunch) and the stuffy old Queen of the Night.
</P>
<P>
   Heidi Grant Murphy, an American soprano much touted of late,
sang Pamina to tenor Raymond Very's Tamino. Both were very
accomplished vocally, most adequate dramatically, but both were
also undistinctive. Jami Rogers' Queen of the Night had the high
notes, the dramatic audacity and the mastery of all those
astonishing florid passages. She was vocally edgy, though, and
whether that was intended, as per Miller's direction, as symbolic
of her character, or was just Rogers' vocal style may never be
known.
</P>
<P>
   Low male voices triumphed. Baritone Thomas Barrett's Papageno
was winning, and baritone Dale Travis' Speaker elevated a
relatively minor role into major status. In his American debut,
English bass Stephen Richardson sang Sarastro with a maturity that
belied his apparent youth. His low notes _ the ones that scrape the
very bottom of the human vocal compass _ had substance, and his
phrasing of Sarastro's long lines was intelligent and controlled.
Robert Spano conducted ``Flute'' with a neat combination of elan
and common sense.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salome,'' sung in German, was a success largely because of the
woman singing the title role. The Welsh soprano Helen Field made
what might have been just another ``Salome'' into one to remember.
Hers was not the lush approach, all vocal cushioning, but one of
high characterization. Field's Salome was girlish, distracted,
bored, jealous, and in the process of becoming sexually aware with
a deep and confused hunger. Ken Cazan's stage direction must surely
have assisted in this, though the rest of the dramatic conception
was unremarkable.
</P>
<P>
   As Narraboth, American tenor Thomas Studebaker cut a tragic
figure and sang with unforced strength. Austrian baritone Claudio
Otelli's Jokanaan conveyed an aptly weird spirituality via
expressive singing.
</P>
<P>
   ``Salome,'' ''Magic Flute'' and ``Beatrice and Benedict''
continue at Santa Fe Opera in repertory with two other productions:
Puccini's ``Madama Butterfly'' and the American premiere of Swedish
composer Ingvar Lidholm's `` A Dream Play''. &QL;

STUMP-CEMETERY (Washington) - Members of Arizona's congressional
delegation distance themselves from controversial remarks from the
dean of their group, Veterans Committee Chairman Bob Stump, to the
``Boston Globe'' over the weekend that one of the two capitol
security officers who died protecting Congress should not have been
buried in Arlington because he was ``not qualified.`` Stump later
qualified his remarks to reflect a concern that he was actually
upset by a procedural issue (that is, that House leadership went
over his head to get waivers for the burial), but the remaks
nonetheless struck some as inappropriate. By ADREIANNE FLYNN. Story

SPICE (Undated) - A Peoria, Ariz., woman wanted to buy three

Rausch said, she has been forced to choose which of her daughters -
both fans - will get to see the teenie-bopper music sensations.
Rausch said she is so outraged that she has filed a discrimination

The entire audience chamber is now roofed over. Alterations were

WOMAN MAKES A BARE STATEMENT AT L.L. BEAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By ANNE E. KORNBLUT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Katherine Tyrol just wanted to tell the naked truth.
</P>
<P>
   And so, after slipping into the women's bathroom at L.L. Bean
headquarters in Maine, she cast aside her tank top and capri pants
and sprinted through the showroom nude _ except for the backpack
slung across her back.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was just kind of sick of the establishment and all that
stuff,'' said Tyrol, 18. ``I think it's really oppressive that the
government decides what part of me has to be covered.''
</P>
<P>
   The fast dash through the 24-hour store in Freeport took place
at about 12:30 a.m. last Wednesday, a company spokeswoman said. The
arrest followed a few minutes later. She was charged with indecent
exposure and ordered to return to court Sept. 2.
</P>
<P>
   Officials dismissed the incident as a consequence of operating a
round-the-clock outlet, and counted it among several unusual
occurrences that have happened in the wee hours.
</P>
<P>
   Rock singer Rod Stewart, for example, once bought rain gear
during a midnight excursion in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   But this was apparently the first streaking incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some customers did happen to be in a position to catch an
eyeful,'' said company spokeswoman Catharine Hartnett. ``She never
told us what cause she was supporting.''
</P>
<P>
   Tyrol, who graduated from Morse High School in Bath in the
spring, admitted that boredom played a role.
</P>
<P>
   After all, she and three friends were in the store in the first
place only because ``nothing in Maine is open 24 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   But it was partly philosphical, too. Tyrol, a waitress in
Brunswick, said nudity appealed to her urges to fight the ``really
Puritan'' elements of her hometown. And she vowed not to be
deterred by the resistance she met last week.
</P>
<P>
   ``I would like to be naked all the time,'' she said. ``But not
at work. Because then I'd spill things on me, naked, instead of on
my clothes.''

   CHEESECAKE-FACTORY (Los Angeles) _ Shares of The Cheesecake
Factory lost 11 percent of their value Tuesday to hit their lowest

   ECONO-LUBE (Los Angeles) _ Franchise owner Randy Cressall hasn't
been faring too well since reports surfaced that state officials

the 110 independently owned franchises, like Cressall's. By Enrique

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Attorney General Janet Reno and a House
investigating committee approached a showdown Tuesday over whether
she should ask for an independent counsel to prosecute campaign
finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   Reno has adamantly declined to take such a step. The committee,
the House Committee on government Reform and Oversight, made plans
to vote Thursday to cite her for contempt of Congress for refusing
to turn over memorandums from her top investigators recommending
the appointment of an outside prosecutor.
</P>
<P>
   ``It looks to me like the attorney general is trying to protect
the president,'' declared the committee chairman, Rep. Dan Burton,
R-Ind.
</P>
<P>
   Denied an opportunity to appear Tuesday before the committee,
Reno called a news conference instead and accused the lawmakers of
tampering politically with a criminal investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But she left open the possibility that she might change her mind
about seeking a special prosecutor. She said: ``I may trigger the
Independent Counsel Act. I may not. I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The Justice Department investigators who did testify _ FBI
Director Louis Freeh and Charles La Bella, who resigned last month
as chief of the Justice Department task force investigating
campaign finance practices _ acknowledged that they had written
memorandums to the attorney general advocating the naming of an
independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   But they urged the committee to withdraw its subpoena for copies
of the memorandums. Release of the documents, La Bella said, would
be ``devastating to the investigations'' and would ``undercut what
any prosecutor would do, whether an independent counsel or a
Department of Justice prosecutor.''
</P>
<P>
   A few minutes before the hearing began, Reno called and asked to
testify herself. Burton turned her down. ``There are procedures for
what we're doing,'' he said at the hearing.
</P>
<P>
   At her news conference, Reno read aloud this passage from a
letter she sent to Burton on Tuesday: ``If future attorneys general
know that the innermost thinking behind their toughest
law-enforcement decisions will become fodder for partisan debate,
then we risk creating a Justice Department and an FBI that tack to
political winds instead of following the facts and the law wherever
they lead. If future law-enforcement professionals cannot provide
advice that is candid and confidential, we will have a government
of `yes' persons who advocate what is popular instead of what is
right. And if future Congresses can poll the attorney general's
advisers or line attorneys in order to ferret out and promote
opinions they approve of, then every controversial law-enforcement
decision will be tainted in the public's eyes.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Freeh wrote his memorandum recommending an independent counsel
last fall. La Bella gave his to Reno on July 16 as he prepared to
return to San Diego as the interim U.S. attorney. La Bella
described it Tuesday as a 94-page report on the progress of the
investigation, with a foot-thick stack of exhibits attached.
</P>
<P>
   La Bella had hoped that his interim position in San Diego would
be made permanent. But the word from the White House this week was
that someone else would get the job.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said Tuesday that she was still reviewing the La Bella
memorandum and needed three more weeks before deciding whether to
call for an independent counsel.
</P>
<P>
   The chairmen of the Senate and House Judiciary Committees, Sen.
Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and Rep. Henry Hyde, R-Ill., have agreed to
give Reno the time she seeks, but Burton has not.
</P>
<P>
   ``Because the August recess is approaching and because the
session will wind down very quickly when we return, I am not
willing to let this matter sit for that long,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said he did not seek confidential evidence. ``We don't
want grand jury information,'' he declared. ``All we want are the
reasons Director Freeh and Mr. La Bella told Attorney General Reno
she should appoint an independent counsel.''
</P>
<P>
   The law requires the attorney general to ask a panel of federal
judges to pick an independent counsel if the attorney general
believes there is enough specific evidence to justify an outside
investigation of high-level officials. Reno has the discretion to
seek an independent counsel if she believes a matter cannot be
objectively investigated by the Justice Department because of
conflicts of interest.
</P>
<P>
   In the past, Reno has maintained that the facts and the law did
not justify an independent counsel in this case. She has always
said that new information could lead her to change her mind.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh and La Bella suggested Tuesday that they believed the
mandatory and discretionary provisions of the law applied in this
case, but they declined to tell the committee their reasoning. The
top FBI agent on the case, James Desarno, testified Tuesday that he
agreed with Freeh and La Bella.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh testified that the investigation involved ``a core group
of individuals who in my view are indisputably covered.''
</P>
<P>
   Burton asked whether that included President Clinton and Vice
President Al Gore.
</P>
<P>
   ``Yes sir,'' Freeh responded. But he did not say whether any
evidence had been found suggesting that Clinton or Gore had
committed crimes.
</P>
<P>
   Staff members of Burton's committee said that the chairman was
sure of enough votes on his side to guarantee approval of a
contempt citation against Reno for refusing to respond to a
subpoena for the Freeh and La Bella memorandums. The committee has
24 Republican members and 19 Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   If the panel does vote for contempt, the issue will go to the
full House of Representatives after the four-week summer recess,
which begins at the end of this week. If a majority of the House
votes for contempt, the case would be turned over to the Justice
Department for indictment and trial in federal court.
</P>
<P>
   Cases rarely get that far, although lawmakers often threaten
contempt citations against people who are not cooperating. No one
in the Capitol on Tuesday was suggesting that Reno would actually
be prosecuted.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans who have been following the case but who are
not on the committee said they doubted that Burton would bring the
matter to a vote Thursday.
</P>
<P>
   A Republican staff assistant who spoke on the condition on
anonymity put the matter this way: ``The polls show that Janet Reno
is very popular. The last thing we want to do is to cite her for
contempt of Congress and have that on people's minds as the last
thing we did before we went home for a month.''
</P>
<P>
   The committee also released Tuesday new evidence of illegal
foreign contributions to the Democratic Party in 1996.
Congressional investigators found $200,000 in travelers checks from
a bank in Indonesia, most of which was cashed or deposited in the
United States by associates of Yah Lin Trie and Antonio Pan. The
signature on the checks is indecipherable.
</P>
<P>
   The investigators found that at least $50,000 of this laundered
money was contributed to the Democratic National Committee.
</P>
<P>
   Trie and Pan were indicted in January on charges of arranging
illegal contributions to the Democrats. Trie surrendered to the
authorities and pleaded not guilty. Pan has left the country.
</P>
<P>
   The Democrats have returned all donations that they know were
illegal. Rick Hess, a spokesman for the Democratic National
Committee, said that the new evidence would be reviewed and that
``appropriate action'' would be taken.

FINANCE BILL PUTS MEEHAN IN THE SPOTLIGHT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (w and a coding)   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARY LEONARD  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ It was clearly Representative Martin T. Meehan's
most important moment in Congress to date, and tension was building
Monday to make last-minute calls, race to strategy meetings, and
give television interviews. ``Time for a Q.S.,'' the Massachusetts
Democrat said cryptically.
</P>
<P>
   The calls and the reporters and the Democratic leadership had to
wait while Meehan took a ``quick shower.'' It was 3:45 p.m., and
what Meehan didn't realize was that the final vote on the
campaign-finance bill he has championed for four years and
carefully steered on the House floor for two months had been pushed
forward by several hours, making his late afternoon a last-minute
scramble.
</P>
<P>
   What looked like one more ploy by Republicans to throw off
Meehan and his GOP ally, Representative Christopher Shays of
Connecticut, turned out to be like all the others: It didn't
succeed. And by a 237-186 vote, the House last night passed the
Shays-Meehan bill, landmark legislation to overhaul major portions
of the campaign-finance system.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like the Germans in `Saving Private Ryan,' the Republican
leadership tried lobbing grenades, laying land mines, and erecting
barbed wire to kill campaign-finance reform,'' said Norman
Ornstein, a political scientist who has followed the issue for the
American Enterprise Institute. ``But Shays and Meehan held it
together and kept members of their coalition from defecting. It was
really quite remarkable.''
</P>
<P>
   And it wasn't easy, even at the end. In midafternoon,
MondayMeehan's legislative aides had an anxiety attack because
members of the black and Hispanic caucuses seemed to be balking at
the Shays-Meehan bill because it had been amended last week to ban
campaign contributions from noncitizens who are legal residents of
the United States. The caucuses, made up mostly of Democrats,
viewed the amendment as a slap at minorities.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be unconscionable, after coming this far, for the
Democrats, in the minority and the reform party, to kill the
bill,'' said Meehan, who with Shays fought off about 60 amendments
to their measure. ``But the closer campaign-finance reform gets to
reality, the more personal and difficult the issue becomes for
members.''
</P>
<P>
   So Meehan sat behind his large desk and worked the phones. He
pleaded with Virginia Democrat Robert Scott and cajoled New York
Republican Peter King to drop their opposition. Then, in a meeting
that had nothing to do with campaign-finance legislation _ instead,
it was to plan a congressional trip to join President Clinton next
month in Ireland _ Meehan leaned on White House lobbyist Chuck
Brain to get Clinton to call lawmakers on behalf of the bill Monday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   ``Get him a list,'' Meehan directed an aide. ``The president can
make the political argument.''
</P>
<P>
   But many believe that it was primarily the unflagging
determination of Meehan and Shays to make the argument for banning
``soft money'' _ at late hours of the night, when they were nearly
alone on the House floor but with a relatively large C-Span
audience tuned in _ that turned what was a dead issue earlier this
year into one that is expected to go with considerable momentum to
a reluctant Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``This bill was, in many ways, left as road kill,'' said
Representative Joseph P. Kennedy II, the Brighton Democrat. ``That
it survived shows the kind of tenacity and instinct for success
that Marty clearly has. He's a determined guy. Once he makes his
mind up, he goes after it.''
</P>
<P>
   Brain called Meehan's management of the bill ``masterful.''
King, who shares Meehan's love of Irish blarney but not his ardor
for a ban on soft money, said the Lowell Democrat, while misguided,
did ``a brilliant job. ... Most others would have given up.''
</P>
<P>
   It probably helps that Meehan, who is running for his fourth
term in Congress, is a detail guy. Monday he meticulously counted
votes; he portioned out precious minutes to those who wanted to
speak during the 40-minute floor debate _ ``No more than three for
(House minority leader Richard) Gephardt''; and he fretted over
whether a little nick on his chin, the result of a ``quick shave''
along with the ``quick shower,'' would show up on the television
screen.
</P>
<P>
   And even as he accepted congratulatory handshakes and hugs _
``We've made incredible progress, and I'm excited we've come this
far,'' Meehan said _ the congressman's mind was racing ahead,
plotting ways to fend off substitute bills in the House later this
week.
</P>
<P>
   ``So far, everything has gone according to plan,'' Meehan said,
as he headed off to find Shays and strategize for the uphill fight
in the Senate.

TEXAS OLD-TIMERS GET A CHUCKLE OVER TODAY'S INTOLERANCE OF HOT
WEATHER
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KAREN ROUSE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ Growing up on his daddy's West Texas farm
and ranch, Lanham Riley often cultivated cotton and herded cattle
in 100-degree temperatures under a scorching sun.
</P>
<P>
   A wide-brimmed hat shaded his head. He drank water. He didn't
use a fan to cool off because he'd never seen one. And, he says, he
never complained.
</P>
<P>
   ``I had to work,'' the 79-year-old rancher said. ``People didn't
complain in those days. They weren't like these people. They didn't
have the news media following you around taking pictures of you.
... Every day you pick up the paper or turn on the television, they
show some poor soul out there sweating.
</P>
<P>
   ``These people out here today, they've got air conditioning. Now
they can't get out in'' the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Visions of the modern-day Texan, moving like a slug across a
sidewalk, breathless, flushed, complaining about the heat and
humidity, seem to make older Texans _ those who grew up without air
conditioning _ shake their heads. Whether keeping windows open to
circulate the air, sleeping on the porch or soaking the bedsheets
with water, they coped with the heat.
</P>
<P>
   It seems, they say, that Willis Carrier's early 1900s invention
_ the air conditioner _ has turned the modern-day Texan into a bit
of a wimp when it comes to tolerating the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Today in the Metroplex, 95 percent of residential customers have
some form of air conditioner, TU Electric spokesman Rand LaVonn
said. Of those with air conditioning in the Metroplex, 70 percent
have central air, he said.
</P>
<P>
   So how did they cope before AC?
</P>
<P>
   ``We had some awful hot days,'' said 85-year-old Morris Bricker,
recalling his childhood.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the middle of the day you might get under some shade and
take a nap for 30 minutes. Never did bother me,'' he said last week
while awaiting his lunch in the air-conditioned White Settlement
Senior Citizens complex.
</P>
<P>
   Bricker said he wore a wide-brimmed Stetson, a long-sleeve shirt
and overalls while he worked on a farm. His clothing became
drenched in sweat that kept his body cool, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've gone half a day without water,'' Bricker said.
</P>
<P>
   Added his friend, U.E. Fisher, 86: ``(We) didn't know what it
was _ the heat. It was normal.''
</P>
<P>
   People today, he said, ``they're weaker.''
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Scott T. Stoll, a physical medicine and rehabilitation
specialist and assistant professor at the University of North Texas
Health Science Center at Fort Worth, said people do become
acclimated to heat.
</P>
<P>
   ``My belief is that people's physiology changes over time. Over
a period of time in hot weather, their bodies learn to retain
water. ... The body accommodates a variety of stress, whether it's
heat or exercise.
</P>
<P>
   ``Usually it adapts fairly regularly, within six weeks of a
challenge,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Yesterday's architecture helped, too. Many older homes were
better designed for the heat.
</P>
<P>
   Lewis T. May, director of the Center for Urban Ecology at the
Gerald Hines College of Architecture at the University of Houston,
said many homes were designed with a sleeping porch.
</P>
<P>
   ``When it got good and hot, you dragged your bedroll outside and
you slept outside. That's where you ate, you courted, you played
cards _ it was a community space,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He added that builders also kept in mind the location of the
sun. ``You wouldn't want to warm the sleeping side of your house.''
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Young, 48, the director of the White Settlement senior
complex who grew up west of Weatherford, said that as a child, ``we
snuck out and slept on the roof. We'd drag the bed outside and
sleep under the stars.''
</P>
<P>
   Young said she also remembers sleeping on top of her sheets
instead of under them and taking showers before bed. ``You'd leave
your skin damp. ... It would cool you down,'' she said. ``That's
the trick I remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Catherine Carlton, an osteopathic physician who grew up in Fort
Worth in the 1920s and 1930s, said she thinks people are losing
their ``power of accommodation.''

   Carlton said she kept cool as a girl by opening windows
throughout her home ``to get the breeze all the way through.''
</P>
<P>
   Later, her family got an attic fan. ``It would pull the air in
the windows and we thought we were in paradise,'' she said. ``In
our living room, we had a fan that sat on the floor and there was a
kind of moist cloth or material in front of it. It would blow and
have some air and a little moisture.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps, some say, the temperatures now are actually higher than
they used to be. Not so, according to Skip Ely, a meteorologist for
the Dallas/Fort Worth office of the National Weather Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is true that we are more humid more often because we've
generally had more wetter years,'' he said, but ``indications are
that we've had plenty of warm weather in the past, particularly in
the'' 1950s.
</P>
<P>
   The years leading up to the late 1950s, when air conditioning
became more popular, are among those with the highest number of
100-degree days.
</P>
<P>
   Ely said 1980 ranks No. 1 with 69 such days, but that 1954 had
52 100-degree days; 1956 had 48; 1952 had 44 and 1951 had 40. There
were 34 100-degree days in 1943 and 1934, too.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what it is is that people have gotten so used to the
air conditioning, so acclimated to it, that they feel the heat more
when they do have to go in it,'' he said.

THOUSANDS OF REFUGEES FLEE SERB MOUNTAIN ATTACK  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
   By MIKE O'CONNOR

<P>
   LIKOVAC, Yugoslavia _ Thousands of refugees, many of them
children, lumbered painfully down mountain trails in wagons and
tractors and on foot Tuesday, fleeing Serbian government forces but
finding almost no place to hide in the broiling heat.
</P>
<P>
   As foreign diplomats pondered how to curtail the offensive
without military action by NATO, refugee families trudged under an
intense sun, many carrying nothing but jugs of water and bags of
food. Those with wagons were packed together so tightly that there
was little room for supplies. Few seemed to know where they were
going or how they would find shelter.
</P>
<P>
   So many people are on the move, and they are scattered through
terrain so rough that international relief workers said there was
no way to estimate their number and no immediate prospect of
delivering enough food, water or medical supplies. The relief
workers said they were worried because many refugees were living in
the open without adequate water or food.
</P>
<P>
   Many of the ethnic Albanians on the move appear to have fled the
threat of attack from Serbian police units and Yugoslav army
soldiers who have embarked on an offensive apparently aimed at
cleaning out strongholds of the rebel Kosovo Liberation Army in
western and central Kosovo.
</P>
<P>
   The rebel force says it will liberate the ethnic Albanian
majority from Serbian rule. But government forces, which are far
better equipped, have gained the upper hand over the last week.
</P>
<P>
   Government attacks on towns and villages are continuing. In
areas that the government has recaptured, Serbian forces were seen
looting and burning homes, diplomats and relief workers said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Fadil Ramaj fled his village, Izbisa, at 2 a.m. Tuesday with as
many relatives as he could find. Ethnic Albanian soldiers around
the village had told his family that government forces seemed to
about to attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had 15 minutes,'' Ramaj said. ``We ran for the children and
for our relatives. We got 60 of us together and we have been coming
down the mountain for 10 hours.''
</P>
<P>
   Ten from the group and one of the two wagons hid part of the way
down. Ramaj and the rest were taking a shelter against a prickly
hedge and a thin line of trees. On the trail in front of them was a
caravan of tractors, wagons, the occasional farm animal and
countless other families.
</P>
<P>
   Of the 50 in Ramaj's group about 40 were children, some in
pajamas and many without shoes. The group had no food, and just a
little water.
</P>
<P>
   ``The army surrounded the village two, or was it three, days
ago,'' Ramaj said. ``There was shelling, and if we stayed, I knew
we would be killed. We are just sitting now trying to decide what
to do. People here think the army will attack here next.''
</P>
<P>
   ``We started out through the fields that our soldiers said were
safe,'' said Ramaj, who farms a small patch of corn and wheat in a
village with fewer than 10 extended families. ``Now we are
somewhere else and we don't know what to do.''
</P>
<P>
   Ramaj admitted his bewilderment and then stopped talking. Two
people rounded the hedge, carrying a bowl of deep red fresh
tomatoes, long green peppers covered in oil, three loaves of bread
and two soda bottles with milk for the toddlers.
</P>
<P>
   They were the owner of the field, Zenil Hajdini, and his
daughter. ``It is not much,'' Hajdini said. ``It is not enough for
them, I know. But people have been coming all day. We will share
what we have until it is gone, and then we will be hungry, too. We
are all Albanians.''
</P>
<P>
   The Ramaj family had hoped to go to Mitrovica, where aid workers
say up to 30,000 refugees have arrived in the last three days,
taking shelter with volunteer families.
</P>
<P>
   But at midday, ethnic Albanian soldiers near Mitrovica received
orders to turn back refugees, saying that there was no more room
for them in the city.
</P>
<P>
   More than 40 villages and hamlets in Kosovo, west of Mitrovica,
seemed nearly deserted Tuesday. The crops were still in the field,
and cows and horses were at pasture. But the people were in hiding
or on the road looking for somewhere safe. In a six-hour drive
4,000 to 5,000 people were sighted wandering in search of shelter.
</P>
<P>
   At 3 p.m. in Likovac, the rebel headquarters, the only visible
movements were a handful of soldiers, four dogs and three men on a
tractor crossing the dust-covered village square.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for the rebel command said that all the top officers
were safe and that their forces were preparing a counterattack.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were expecting this, and worse,'' the spokesman said. ``We
have our own plans.'' The spokesman would not give his name.
</P>
<P>
   With artillery fire close, and with tall columns of black smoke
rising from three villages nearby, the confidence of the spokesman
seemed somewhat misplaced.
</P>
<P>
   At a government position near Likovac a dark blue armored
personnel carrier was pointing a heavy machine gun toward the smoke
coming from the village of Lapusnik. A police officer, shirtless,
opened a hatch on the vehicle and was removing empty beer bottles
when he saw a convoy of troops heading toward him. Lethargically,
he waved them forward to Lapusnik.
</P>
<P>
   Foreign diplomats said again Tuesday they were doing all they
could to stop the offensive or stop government troops from
attacking civilians, but that Yugoslavia's president, Slobodan
Milosevic, would not respond to diplomatic pressure unless he knew
that failing to do so would bring a NATO military attack.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pressuring Milosevic without a military threat is like playing
baseball without a bat, it doesn't work,'' said a senior Western
diplomat.
</P>
<P>
   The debate now among NATO officers, said the diplomat, was to
choose targets that aircraft could hit without having to destroy
Yugoslavia's air defense system.
</P>
<P>
   NATO has been studying what sorts of attacks it could mount
against Yugoslavia for several months, and on June 11th announced
it had arrived at several acceptable options. Tuesday, a NATO
official said despite the earlier announcement, the options were
still being discussed within NATO, and final plans were still not
ready.

<P>
   MANCHESTER, Tenn. _ In the annals of generational politics, the
1996 presidential campaign between Bill Clinton and Bob Dole barely
merits mention when compared with Thursday's election for county
commissioner here in Coffee County, Tenn.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton and Dole, after all, were separated by a mere 23 years,
a relative blink in time. That is nothing, locals say, when you
look at this year's race between Fayna Walker, the Democratic
incumbent in District 7, and her Republican challenger, Nathan
Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Walker, who is known around the county simply as Miss
Fayna, is 81. Cunningham, who is known around Coffee County High
School simply as Nathan, is 18. Mrs. Walker cast the first vote of
her life in 1936, for Franklin D. Roosevelt. Cunningham cast the
first vote of his life in the primary this May, for himself.
</P>
<P>
   Local politics tend to be quirky and lighthearted here in Coffee
County, a farming community of about 40,000 people some 65 miles
southeast of Nashville. Following an age-old tradition, pranksters
skulk onto the courthouse square late each election night and bury
the losers in effigy, complete with barbed epitaphs on makeshift
tombstones.
</P>
<P>
   But rarely has an election for the 21-member commission
generated as much amusement as the contest between Mrs. Walker and
Cunningham. The 63-year gap between the candidates, said County
Executive James Wilhelm, will provide an interesting test of
``whether people want experience over youth and enthusiasm.''
</P>
<P>
   In the 1996 presidential race, the age issue played to Clinton's
advantage as voters questioned whether Dole, at 73, was too old to
lead. But among the 1,348 registered voters in Coffee County's 7th
District, there are concerns about the age of both candidates.
</P>
<P>
   That is to be expected in a race where one candidate has a bit
of a maturity problem and the other has a bit of a memory problem.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who approaches voters as meekly as a freshman at a
high school dance, grew a scruffy red beard this year to cover up
his baby fat and blemishes. When he knocks on the doors of
potential voters, he hands out a complimentary campaign matchbook,
explains speedily that he favors lower property taxes and a new
juvenile jail, and then looks for a route to escape the front
porch.
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Walker, meanwhile, had trouble in an interview Monday
recalling the name of her favorite book, a romance novel she said
she had read three or four times. And though she has served on the
county commission for 23 years, she had to call a county aide to
ask how often the body meets.
</P>
<P>
   ``Neither one of us has made an issue of age,'' Cunningham
explained, ``since we could both be attacked on that point. We've
pretty much left it alone.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, almost alone. Mrs. Walker has a penchant for referring to
Cunningham as ``the boy'' or ``that young man.'' And Cunningham
addresses the issue of experience by saying: ``Of course I don't
have as much experience as she does. She's been doing it since
before I was born.''
</P>
<P>
   Mrs. Walker, who was widowed in 1962 and has no children, said
she has been impressed by Cunningham's work ethic. But she
questions whether Cunningham, who lives at home, can find the time
to serve effectively. ``Since he's still in school, what time does
he have to work, other than weekends?'' she asked.
</P>
<P>
   Cunningham, who graduated from high school this year and plans
to study criminal justice at a nearby community college, said he
has experience from a term as chairman of the Tennessee Teenage
Republicans, from grassroots work in several campaigns, and from
manning the cash register at his family's Chevron station and
mini-market.
</P>
<P>
   He said he has been interested in politics since age 10, when he
began watching congressional debates on C-Span. When he attended a
regional Republican meeting in Biloxi, Miss., earlier this year, he
called friends back home each time he spied a party dignitary.
</P>
<P>
   ``He called me four times from there on his cell phone, every
time he saw someone famous,'' said Reba Shipp, a former chairwoman
of the county Republican Party who has adopted Cunningham as her
political godson. ``I'd hate to see his bill. But he'd call and
say, `Ms. Shipp, I just shook hands with Lamar, or whoever it
was.'''
</P>
<P>
   Just as Cunningham is mature beyond his years, Mrs. Walker is
youthful for hers. Her creamy skin remains as uncreased as pink
satin. She still drives herself down the county's blacktops in a
gray Ford pickup, at an unwavering 35 miles per hour. She hammers
her own yard signs into the dirt.
</P>
<P>
   Wilhelm, the county executive, described Mrs. Walker as ``a
crafty lady'' who will ``let people know where she stands in no
uncertain terms.''
</P>
<P>
   From time to time, Mrs. Walker said, she feels her age, like the
recent Sunday when she fell asleep in church, waking just in time
for the closing hymn. And she did sprain her arm while trying to
leap across a ditch to plant a sign in a supporter's yard.
</P>
<P>
   But other than that, she said she feels healthy and alert. And
without politics, she would be left to live out her years doing
little more than watching her ``mystery stories'' on TV, like the
Perry Mason reruns she adores. ``Without this job,'' she said,
``I'd probably have Alzheimer's right now.''

TEEN GETS DYING WISH, BECOMES U.S. CITIZEN

<P>
   HOUSTON _ A 16-year-old Nicaraguan boy diagnosed with bone
cancer got his wish from the Make-a-Wish Foundation on Tuesday. He
and his family became U.S. citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Gimel Aguinaga stood alongside his mother and 14-year-old sister
as they took oaths to become citizens.
</P>
<P>
   Aguinaga wore a new gray suit and a Nike cap to cover his bald
head, a result of chemotherapy treatments, and answered ``I do'' to
the oath pledging loyalty to the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Overwhelmed by the excitement and the 90-degree heat after the
crowded ceremony at Houston's INS office, he was whisked away in a
wheelchair and then a limousine.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm very emotional and nervous. I'm happy to become a citizen,
but I'm sad that my son is ill,'' said his mother, Blanca Sunsin.
</P>
<P>
   The pressure was on Sunsin, a school custodian who speaks verylittle English, to help make her son's wish come true. Sunsin had
to pass a citizenship test _ given in English _ of 10 questions or
more about U.S. history and government.
</P>
<P>
   A legal resident of 13 years, Sunsin applied for naturalization,
but faced a wait of up to two years because of the backlog at the
Immigration and Naturalization Service.
</P>
<P>
   Aguinaga, who suffers from a type of cancer called Ewing's
sarcoma that was diagnosed two years ago, did not have that long to
wait.
</P>
<P>
   That's where the wish started to develop.
</P>
<P>
   While a patient at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer
Center in Houston several months ago, Aguinaga was referred to the
Make-a-Wish Foundation, an organization that grants wishes to
children with life-threatening diseases.
</P>
<P>
   Ron May, a Make-a-Wish volunteer, visited Aguinaga in the
hospital and explained the many options he could wish for. May was
surprised at the boy's response.
</P>
<P>
   ``My dream was for us to become American citizens. That is the
greatest,'' Aguinaga said.
</P>
<P>
   As minors, he and his sister, also named Blanca, would become
citizens when their mother was naturalized.
</P>
<P>
   ``I thought he was going to say he wanted to go to Disney World
or wanted a computer. I've heard of a lot of wishes, but that one
is the best. It's so important and so unselfish,'' May said.
</P>
<P>
   Teri Andrepont, executive director of the Texas Gulf Coast
Make-a-Wish Foundation, said, ``So many of us take our citizenship
for granted. His wish should make us realize how precious it really
is.''
</P>
<P>
   Learning of the two-year backlog, the foundation sought help
from Sen. Phil Gramm, R-Texas. His office called the INS to point
out the humanitarian aspects of the case, and the INS then
expedited the application.
</P>
<P>
   To make the day even more special, Houston Astros spokeswoman
Phoenix Mak attended the ceremony and invited Aguinaga to the
Astros-Philadelphia Phillies baseball game Friday night at the
Astrodome. Aguinaga, a huge baseball fan, also received an Astros
cap and a baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't be a team without our fans. We want to invite you
to meet (new pitcher) Randy Johnson and the other players,'' Mak
said.
</P>
<P>
   Aguinaga smiled as brightly then as he did when he was referred
to as a ``fellow American.''

ARTS CENTER SUES OVER LOSS OF CITY SUPPORT 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients.)  
 By SUSANA HAYWARD  
 c.1998 San Antonio Express-News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   SAN ANTONIO _ In what is believed to be the first nationwide
test of a recent Supreme Court ruling on funding for arts
organizations, a grassroots cultural arts group filed a federal
lawsuit Tuesday against San Antonio, accusing the city of
discrimination by slashing all the organization's funding.
</P>
<P>
   The Esperanza Peace and Justice Center, which sponsors a gay and
lesbian film festival among its events, filed the lawsuit in U.S.
District Court here.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled in June that the National Endowment for
the Arts can, under federal legislation, deny cash grants to
artists, if their work is considered indecent. But in the same
decision, the court said that the Constitution does not allow
governments to discriminate against an organization because of its
viewpoint.
</P>
<P>
   ``The basic idea is that the government may not endorse one
viewpoint over another,'' said Amy Kastely, the lawyer for the
Esperanza center.
</P>
<P>
   The Supreme Court ruled that the NEA can consider decency in
deciding who gets public money for the arts. Congress set decency
standards in 1990 after an uproar over the NEA's role in funding
certain works, including homoerotic photographs.
</P>
<P>
   Joined in the lawsuit by the San Antonio Lesbian and Gay Media
Project and the small arts group VAN, Esperanza officials said the
City Council violated the free-speech rights when it cut a total of
$76,000 in funds last September.
</P>
<P>
   Esperanza said the City Council folded under pressure from
right-wing groups that decried Esperanza's work as pro-abortion and
pro-homosexual.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our vision, our mission has always been about giving voice to
those who have never had a voice, or had less access to one,'' said
Graciela Sanchez, executive director of the center. ``And that
includes Latinos, Latina women, African-American women, young
people, old people. And it includes lesbians and gays.''
</P>
<P>
   The City Council unanimously voted in September 1997 to reduce
arts funding as part of a ``back to basics'' budget. Grants to most
arts agencies were cut 15 percent, with the exception of Esperanza,
which lost all support.
</P>
<P>
   The city's argument was that Esperanza, established in 1987, was
not an arts organization, but a group with a social agenda.
</P>
<P>
   Esperanza, which means ``hope'' in Spanish, has annual budget of
$300,000, which it raises through special events and donations.
</P>
<P>
   Along with arts exhibits, the center hosts a festival showcasing
women artists, the Other America Film Festival and a video arts
program. It sponsors women artists in low-income housing. The
center said these events had to be canceled when it lost the city
money.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Howard Peak said he could not immediately comment on the
lawsuit until he had more details.
</P>
<P>
   ``When we, taxpaying citizens from diverse communities, learned
that the City Council had unjustly singled out and totally defunded
the Esperanza last year, we called upon the Esperanza to redress
this wrong,'' said Antonia Castaneda, a professor of history at St.
Mary's University and supporter of the center. ``Our future, and
that of our children, is at stake.''
</P>
<P>
   David Greene, program director for the National Campaign for
Freedom of Expression in Washington, said the lawsuit would watched
by similar organizations across the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``This lawsuit is not about a city's ability to control how tax
dollars are spent,'' Greene said. ``It is about whether an entity
that in every other way is highly qualified to receive a
governmental benefit may be denied that for the sole reason that
those in power disagree with its politics and cultural outlook.''

 &HT;    LAX SECURITY IN ARMY PROGRAM MAY HAVE COMPROMISED SECRETS
 &HT;    800&AMP;add.
 &HT;    EDS: Recasts lede.
 &HT;    By JULIA MALONE and RUSSELL CAROLLO
 &HT;    c.1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Army ran its program for visiting foreign
military officers with such slipshod procedures that the service
can't be sure whether foreign governments obtained sensitive
defense secrets, newly released Pentagon documents reveal.
</P>
<P>
   ``This situation poses a significant risk to the Army's current
and future combat capability,'' the Army's deputy chief of staff
for intelligence wrote last year to the Army's inspector general.
The terse memo from Maj. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy is among several
critical reports obtained by Cox Newspapers under the Freedom of
Information Act.
</P>
<P>
   The memo _ three lines of which were blacked out by Pentagon
officials _ said there had not been ``full compliance'' with Army
regulations on disclosure of information and transfer of technology
to foreign nationals.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the program's lack of safeguards was cited by the
Army in an annual report to Congress on the military's most serious
``material weaknesses.''
</P>
<P>
   The memo from Kennedy, who has since been promoted to lieutenant
general, came amid of a flurry of activity that began last spring.
Although the Army documents did not indicate that security was
actually compromised, the Army's intelligence command ordered a
top-to-bottom overhaul for Foreign Liaison Officers, as the program
is formally known. The reforms are not yet complete, seven months
after their target date.
</P>
<P>
   Army financial audits also revealed lax financial management of
the program, which was set up 34 years ago to forge closer ties
between the Army and the military in friendly nations.
</P>
<P>
   The Army's audit agency concluded that some of the cementing of
those ties went beyond the requirements of hospitality. An
investigation cited a $26,000 reception for 265 people at an
undisclosed Army base, a ski trip for foreign liaison officers and
their families, and a ``gift locker'' at the Pentagon that was
bulging with gifts for the foreigners, including items from Tiffany
and Co. and $19,342 worth of Parker pens.
</P>
<P>
   One audit reported that the Army spent $580,000 on gifts , tours
and entertainment for foreign liaison operations in the year that
ended November 1996.
</P>
<P>
   The auditors concluded that such expenditures ``may not pass the
media 'litmus test','' and added that ``negative media coverage may
be detrimental to Army funding requirements considering the current
fiscal environment.''
</P>
<P>
   The Army ordered tighter controls for the so-called contingency
funds for the program. However, Pentagon officials said they had no
estimate of the current cost of the Foreign Liaison Officer
program.
</P>
<P>
   In written responses to questions from Cox Newspapers, Kennedy's
office said there are 173 foreign visitors from 23 countries, which
include NATO allies, Israel, Egypt and India, among others. The
visitors spend two to three years with the Army on a variety of
missions, including overseeing the purchase of U.S. weapons for
their countries, working with computer technology to improve
compatibility with U.S. forces, and observing Army training.
</P>
<P>
   Other branches of the armed services have similar programs,
which the military highly prizes as a way to improve cooperation
among allied armies and make joint military operations easier.
Foreign naval officers are stationed at bases and on U.S. ships and
take courses at the Naval War College in Newport, R.I. A
spokeswoman for the Navy said that naval foreign liaison officers
come under a decentralized command, and she could offer no estimate
of the number of participants.
</P>
<P>
   The bulk of foreign officers attached to the Air Force are
stationed at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio, where
78 foreign personnel from 20 countries work. Their chief mission is
to help facilitate the sales of military hardware.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've not had any security problems,'' said Col. Howard Creek,
vice-commander of the Air Force Security Assistance Center at
Wright-Patterson. Asked how the foreign visitors are overseen, he
said, ``We don't physically follow them around, but we do keep
track of what they're doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Creek said that he had not been informed of problems in the Army
foreign liaison operations.
</P>
<P>
   Although such programs are designed for friendly countries, the
exchange of information carries an obvious risk that countries will
ask their liaisons to delve into U.S. secrets, said a veteran of
the U.S. intelligence field. ``I would be surprised and shocked if
they didn't do it,'' said James R. Lilley, a career Central
Intelligence Agency officer who also served as ambassador to China.
``You try to prevent these things from happening as best you can.
If you want absolute guarantees, you better cut out the program.''
</P>
<P>
   (Story can end here. Optional add follows.)
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what triggered the apparent alarm over the Army's
foreign liaison program was not clear from the internal documents.
The Army Intelligence command repeatedly cited concerns that the
program had no centralized command and that oversight was falling
through the cracks.
</P>
<P>
   Among the deficiencies were that the visiting officers had no
written agreements with the United States defining the role of
liaison officers. Also, the Army reforms indicated that despite a
regulation requiring foreign governments to reimburse the U.S.
military for liaison expenses, the U.S. military had apparently
failed to seek the repayments.
</P>
<P>
   Seven months after the target date for full compliance with
regulations, the Army has completed an agreement with only one of
the participating countries, Argentina. Army officials who are
working on the diplomatic project said they could offer no
prediction about when the rest of the agreements would be completed
and signed.
</P>
<P>
   Only one Army installation, Georgia's Fort McPherson, submitted
a completed review on the foreign visitors on base by the Jan. 1
deadline.
</P>
<P>
   An Army directive issued last year on reforming the program by
the first of this year included this stiff warning: ``All current
foreign LNO (liaison officer) positions not in compliance with
applicable DOD (Department of Defense) and Army guidance by 1
January 1998 will be subject to elimination.''
</P>
<P>
   Asked whether the Army has eliminated any liaison positions for
failing to comply, Kennedy's office said, ``No.''

MOVIES, ADS MAKE GLISTENING BODIES LOOK SOOOO GOOD
</HEADLINE>

<P>
   Sweat _ it's too sexy for your body.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, your body doesn't sweat. It perspires.
Perspiration has an odor. They don't call deodorants
``anti-sweats,'' do they? No, they call them ``antiperspirants.''
</P>
<P>
   No, sweat belongs on ``celebrities''' bodies. Marlon Brando.
Chris Isaak. Michael Jordan. Janet Jackson. To paraphrase Will
Smith, they make this sweat look ``good.''
</P>
<P>
   In entertainment and advertising, sweat is sexy for a reason:
You can't smell it. It gives you the sense that people are pumped
or primed, without giving you the sense that they stink. Sweat
looks good, it feels good.
</P>
<P>
   Our proof? These damp moments in movies, music, videos and
commercials.
</P>
<P>
   CINEMATIC SWEAT
</P>
<P>
   ``Cool Hand Luke'': No less than the first episode of ``Cheers''
called this the sweatiest movie ever made. The most memorably
sweaty scene finds Paul Newman, George Kennedy and a whole chain
gang of now-familiar faces leering at a scantily clad young woman
``innocently'' washing her car.
</P>
<P>
   ``The African Queen:'' Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn
star in this classic adventure about a boozy boat captain and a
missionary who become an unlikely couple. Bogart, especially,
sweats so much that his perspiration should get screen credit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Body Heat'': William Hurt and Kathleen Turner generated enough
heat in this Southern noir to make entire audiences sweat.
</P>
<P>
   ``A Streetcar Named Desire'': A sweaty Marlon Brando, when he
was still something to look at, and his torn T-shirt raise Vivien
Leigh's temperature in Tennessee Williams' N'Awlins story. Years
later, Brando would produce sweat of a much different kind in
``Apocalypse Now.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Cat on a Hot Tin Roof'': Sweat master Paul Newman (see ``Cool
Hand Luke'') works up some steam with Elizabeth Taylor (who's never
looked hotter) in another of Williams' feverish Southern tales.
</P>
<P>
   ``Flashdance'': Jennifer Beals works up a sweat as a hot-looking
young welder/nightclub dancer/wannabe ballerina/boss-dater.
``Anyone'' would sweat if they were this busy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Nine 1/2 Weeks'': ``Flashdance'' director Adrian Lyne (the man
behind the ``Lolita'' remake) is at it again, especially in a scene
in which Mickey Rourke takes a lucky ice cube for a walk on Kim
Basinger's body.
</P>
<P>
   Honorable mention: It's not sexy, but Albert Brooks' flop-sweat
scene in ``Broadcast News'' is probably the biggest case of
perspiration in movie history.
</P>
<P>
   SWEAT TO THE BEAT
</P>
<P>
   ``Cold Sweat,'' James Brown: The hardest-sweating man in show
business sings ``You got me _ `huh!' _ in a cold sweat!''
</P>
<P>
   ``When Doves Cry,'' Prince: Maybe the best song to ever come
from a bad movie (''Purple Rain''), it contains the lines: ``Dig if
u will the picture/Of u and I engaged in a kiss/The sweat of your
body covers me/Can u my darling/Can u picture this?'' Even though
Prince can be sexy, nobody ever said he was a great speller.
</P>
<P>
   ``Need You Tonight,'' INXS: Michael Hutchence sings ``I need you
tonight/'cause I'm not sleeping/There's something about you
girl/That makes me sweat.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Dancing With Myself,'' Billy Idol: Even sneering,
bleached-blond Mohawked rock stars get lonely sometimes, but Billy
seems to enjoy it: ``... Oh, world's all wet/ ... I'm gonna sweat''
(repeat 18 times). A little too much information, Billy.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gonna Make You Sweat (Everybody Dance Now),'' C\+C Music
Factory: The title says it all in this 1990 hit.
</P>
<P>
   Honorable mention: ``Sweatin' to the Oldies,'' Richard Simmons'
collection of aerobicized dinosaur rock.
</P>
<P>
   WATCH 'EM SWEAT
</P>
<P>
   Sweaty music videos:
</P>
<P>
   ``Wicked Game,'' Chris Isaak: We're not sure if Isaak and model
Helena Christensen are actually sweating when they romp on the
beach in this incredibly steamy video. But it sure ``feels'' like
they are. It usually fogs our glasses up too much for us to tell.
</P>
<P>
   ``Love Will Never Do Without You,'' Janet Jackson: Jackson,
Antonio Sabato Jr. and ``Amistad's'' Djimon Hounsou romp in Death
Valley. The guys look terrific, and Jackson _ clad in jeans and
midriff blouse _ has never looked better.
</P>
<P>
   ``Mama Said Knock You Out,'' L.L. Cool J: The rapper, face
mostly concealed by a hood, sweats up such a storm in a boxing ring
that he could be eligible for Rocky VI.
</P>
<P>
   ``Gangsta's Paradise,'' Coolio: It's not Coolio, but chorus
singer L.V., who works up a sweat as Coolio raps in Michelle
Pfeiffer's face.
</P>
<P>
   ``Express Yourself,'' Madonna: Factory workers (we're sure
they're from a ``real'' factory) work up a sweat in Madonna's
anthem of sexual empowerment.
</P>
<P>
   Honorable mentions: They're not known for music videos, but we
would be remiss if we didn't mention Tom Jones and Elvis Presley,
two of the sweatiest entertainers of all time.
</P>
<P>
   SPOTS OF SWEAT (Sweat in advertising)
</P>
<P>
   Diet Coke: The commercial was called ``11:30 Break,'' and it
gave Lucky Vanous his 15 seconds of fame as a construction worker
who doffs his shirt and downs Diet Coke, much to the delight of
some women in a nearby office looking out a window.
</P>
<P>
   Gatorade: The campaign's called ``Blood, Sweat and Tears'' and
features athletes sweating in Gatorade colors.
</P>
<P>
   Zima: A sweaty guy drinks Zima, and then, King Midas-style, he
freezes everything he touches. It must've been ``really'' hot for
him to drink this bland junk.
</P>
<P>
   Honorable mention: Country singer Sammy Kershaw once planned to
bottle his sweat and market it as cologne. OK, so this is a
product, not an ad.

U.S. WARNS IRAQ FOR HALTING COOPERATION ON ARMS INSPECTIONS  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By BARBARA CROSSETTE    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   UNITED NATIONS _ Iraq's decision to go for broke and refuse to
discuss any further cooperation with U.N. arms inspectors provoked
a warning from the White House on Tuesday that the action will only
insure that Baghdad remains under sanctions indefinitely.
</P>
<P>
   ``This once again leaves Iraq further from what Saddam Hussein
says his goal is, which is relief from the sanctions,'' said P.J.
Crowley, a White House spokesman. ``That can only come when Iraq
complies with the resolutions.''
</P>
<P>
   Russia and France, which have supported Iraq's demand for an
early end to sanctions, reacted with concern Tuesday to the
breakdown of the talks. The Russians, who have served as mediators
with Iraq in the past, called for the talks to resume. The French
foreign ministry expressed exasperation in a statement Tuesday that
said, ``We repeat that good cooperation between Unscom and Iraq is
necessary and unavoidable if sanctions imposed by the Security
Council are to be lifted.'' &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The next sanctions review is planned for October, and time is
running out for the Iraqis to answer the crucial remaining
questions.
</P>
<P>
   Secretary-General Kofi Annan, who took some political risk in
going to Iraq in February to defuse the last crisis, which drew the
United States close to war with Iraq, said Tuesday that the latest
confrontation ``may be a major hiccup, but a hiccup we can
overcome, I hope.'' The accord he reached promised full cooperation
from the Iraqis, who have been under a comprehensive embargo since
their 1990 invasion of Kuwait.
</P>
<P>
   The American and British position may be bolstered in the short
term if Iraq provokes a new crisis at a time when its supporters on
the Security Council thought they might be close to relaxing
sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   But some experts say that Iraq may be gambling that another
confrontation will leave Washington even more isolated in the long
run, as calls increase here and in the Middle East for an end to
eight years of crippling sanctions that have failed to bring down
President Saddam Hussein.
</P>
<P>
   Many diplomats here also seem to accept as a given that
President Clinton does not want a showdown with Iraq just before
elections in the United States in November.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Butler, the chief inspector, left Iraq early Tuesday to
return to New York to brief the Security Council on Thursday about
the early collapse of the talks. At a stop in Bahrain, he told
reporters in somewhat more detail what happened at his meeting on
Monday with Iraq's deputy prime minister, Tariq Aziz.
</P>
<P>
   ``I offered him a new accelerated schedule of work for the next
five weeks in order to try and resolve most of the outstanding
issues, mainly in the chemical and missile areas, before our
October report to the Security Council,'' Butler told Agence
France-Presse. Iraq must account for all nuclear, biological,
chemical and long-range missile systems before sanctions imposed in
1990 can be lifted.
</P>
<P>
   ``Aziz refused to accept the proposal, saying he wasn't ready to
continue working with Unscom on these issues,'' Butler said,
referring to the United Nations Special Commission, which he leads.
He said Aziz had told him that ``no more discussion would take
place for the present.''
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, Aziz told a news conference in Baghdad that he had
only one message for Butler, who refuses to accept the Iraqi
contention that it has no more prohibited weapons or the means to
make them. ``I asked Butler to go to the Security Council and tell
the truth and he refused to do that.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The Iraqis have been signaling for several months that they were
preparing a test of wills for Butler, an Australian arms control
expert who reports directly to the Security Council. He has been
under pressure there from Russia, France and China to hasten the
end of sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   Inspectors working for the Special Commission, where the
Russians and French have now installed political advisers among the
arms experts, have also felt they have been undermined by aides
around Annan, who would like to see a diplomatic finale to the
Iraqi problem. These aides have occasionally suggested that
Butler's inspectors are insensitive and too hard on Iraq.
</P>
<P>
   At the Middle East Institute in Washington, Andrew Parasiliti,
an Iraq expert, said Tuesday that it was now in Iraq's interest to
engage in ``diplomatic brinkmanship'' in dealing with the United
Nations.
</P>
<P>
   ``One lesson of the November-February situation is that crisis
diplomacy works,'' he said. ``There was some political gain from
the last crisis. The Iraqis exploited positions within the Security
Council, they showed a political sentiment in the Arab world that
was in their favor and they got the intervention of the U.N.
secretary-general. That's all in the plus political column.''
</P>
<P>
   ``But since then, it's been a series of negatives,'' Parasiliti
said, listing a ``damning'' report from Butler's commission at the
last sanctions review in April, a lack of progress in inspections,
a revelation that Iraq had loaded the nerve gas VX in shells and a
gloomier than expected report on nuclear programs from the
International Atomic Energy Agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a belief that because things aren't going their way,
they had to take this to the edge diplomatically,'' Parasiliti
said. ``Every time there is high engagement, they raise the
stakes.''

HEAT TAKES DEADLY TOLL ON ALIENS TRAVELING IN BORDER AREA 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By RICK LYMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   LAREDO, Texas _ Jesus Ortiz Garcia had been stumbling all day
through the sweltering mesquite scrublands north of the Mexican
border, his lone liter of water long since drained. But it was not
until his woozy head began to throb, his feet had blistered, his
stomach had soured and he had begun to get the distinct impression
that he was going blind that he decided it might be wise to turn
himself into the Border Patrol.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was losing my vision and my legs were growing weaker,''
Ortiz said. ``I was falling farther and farther behind my group.
Finally, they just left me behind.''
</P>
<P>
   So the 21-year-old mason from just across the border, in Nuevo
Laredo, who had dreamed of making his way the 150 miles up to San
Antonio to do yard work, stumbled into the highway checkpoint north
of Laredo on Interstate 35 and became the latest statistic in the
implacable heat wave that has scorched much of the south-central
United States, especially Texas, since the middle of May and shows
no signs of easing.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just came wandering out of the brush and he looked pretty
bad,'' said George Benavides, a border agent. ``He kept saying,
`Agua, agua,' over and over again. So we cooled him off, gave him
Gatorade and a sandwich, and he started to come around. He's lucky.
It's been a bad year for heat deaths on the border.''
</P>
<P>
   Temperatures have regularly been above 100 in the Rio Grande
Valley since spring, and a severe drought has dried or fouled most
of the remote ponds and livestock tanks where illegal aliens had
been finding water. For more than two and a half months, going
outside here has felt like opening the oven to check the cookies.
</P>
<P>
   Yet while most of the nation's attention has focused on the big
cities farther north, like Dallas, where the elderly and people
without air conditioning have been dying by the dozens, the
second-largest cluster of heat-related deaths has been occurring
along the 2,000-mile border with Mexico. Too many people are
carrying too little water, blindly following guides, who are called
coyotes, into the South Texas frying pan. U.S. border officials say
that, as of last weekend, at least 50 people have died of
hyperthermia, or heat-related dehydration, this year along the
border's fiery scrublands and deserts between the Gulf of Mexico
and the New Mexico state line.
</P>
<P>
   ``These numbers should be seen as a bare minimum,'' said Richard
Marroquin, deputy chief patrol agent for the Laredo Sector of about
175 miles between Eagle Pass and Falcon Lake. ``They're just the
ones we know about. We're often coming across skeletons and bodies
that have been out there for who knows how long, so there are
probably a lot more out there now.''
</P>
<P>
   Crossing the border has always been a perilous enterprise, but
in a normal year the great majority of deaths would come from
drowning or train accidents. In 1997, for example, there were 23
recorded deaths related to heat and 41 to drowning.
</P>
<P>
   ````This year has been really bad, and not just because of the
heat,'' Marroquin said. ``There's not much water out there. People
run through what little water they're carrying before the first day
out, so they drink bad water from stock tanks or other places. They
get sick and vomit and get diarrhea and that just dehydrates them
faster.''
</P>
<P>
   He recalled one fatality this summer in which a young woman got
sick and could not go on, so her relatives went to get help and
left her sitting in the shade with her Bible in her lap. That is
how the border agents found her, several hours later, covered by a
T-shirt that she had apparently placed over her head to shield her
from the sun.
</P>
<P>
   Brian McCormack, another border agent at Laredo, told of a
recent incident in which two young men left their ailing uncle
beside a filthy stock pond, made their way to the nearest road and
waited 12 hours for a car to pass, then took four more hours to
find the spot where they had left him. By the time border agents
got back to him, the uncle was long dead.
</P>
<P>
   Another heat-sickened man was left in the uncertain shade of a
mesquite tree with nothing but two bottles of tequila. It was not
until weeks later, when the others in his group were captured and
sent back to their village, and relatives of the man asked what had
happened to him, that his companions told their story. The man was
found under the tree next to two empty bottles of tequila _ tequila
that had probably, mercifully, hastened his death.
</P>
<P>
   The heat victims have been various ages, from teen-agers to the
elderly, and they have come alone and in groups. Just recently,
border agents in Laredo came across 19 illegal immigrants who had
been abandoned by their coyote and were very ill. All survived.
</P>
<P>
   ``Sometimes, they'll leave the sick person behind and come out
to the highway to find help,'' Marroquin said. ``Sometimes they'll
wait until they get to San Antonio or wherever they're going and
send word back, which is usually too late. Often, a rancher will
stumble across them, or they'll go to the ranch house for help. And
sometimes, they'll just leave them there and go on, without a
word.''

   Another factor in the rise in heat deaths this summer has been
the Border Patrol's increased vigilance along the normal, easier
crossing points. Benavides said there were 66 agents in the Laredo
North office when he joined it 10 years ago, but by the end of a
current hiring binge there will be 265. It is the same story at
popular crossings all along the border. This has had the effect, in
part, of forcing some smugglers to shift their activities farther
and farther from the towns, the highways and the water.
</P>
<P>
   In the best of times, those who cross the Rio Grande along the
brushlands northwest of Laredo have a two-day walk to the nearest
highway, where they are to be picked up at pre-arranged locations
and taken to safe houses or all the way to San Antonio.
</P>
<P>
   But the stronger the border vigilance, the farther upriver they
must cross and the longer the walk to the highway. Add to this the
normal zigzagging that many coyotes take to avoid the Border
Patrol's buried sensors, and it can take four or five hard days of
walking to get from the river to a pick-up point.
</P>
<P>
   ``They assume they can make it in a couple of days, so they only
carry a small supply of water, a few gallons at the most,'' said
Susan M. Macey, a geographer at Southwest Texas State University
who has studied heat-related deaths across the United States.
``Partly, they're getting misinformation. Everybody underestimates
how long it will take, and then they get out there without enough
water and five days hard walk to anywhere where they can get some
assistance. There's just nothing out there, you know.''
</P>
<P>
   Someone walking through the brush needs at least a gallon of
water a day to keep going, Ms. Macey said, so a four-or five-day
walk requires five gallons of water, which is too much to carry.
And the situation is made worse, Ms. Macey said, by the predatory
nature of the smugglers.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're telling these people, `You can make it, give us the
money and we'll get to you a truck,' and the next thing you know
they're dying of heat prostration,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Several sectors of the Border Patrol have brought in desert
survival specialists from the military this year to train officers
on how to help those they find still alive in the brush. All along
the border, the green-and-white Border Patrol vehicles have also
begun to carry extra rations of water, ice, Gatorade and
sandwiches, as well as an emergency medical kit that includes
intravenous tubes to get fluids into the bodies of those too weak
to swallow.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials on both sides of the border have also begun
a campaign of public service announcements in the Mexican media to
warn people not to try the crossing during the heat and the
drought.
</P>
<P>
   The Border Patrol's policy is to prosecute smugglers but simply
to transport immigrants back across the border after they have
recovered from their ordeal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Pretty much everything out here has a thorn on it,''
McCormack, the border agent, said as he steered his four-wheel
patrol vehicle along a remote path looking for tracks.
</P>
<P>
   He stopped at a stock pond next to a rusting windmill,
surrounded by prickly pears and partly shaded by cottonwoods.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most of the ones who don't make it are city people, you
know,'' McCormack said. ``They're not used to the heat and the hard
work that a lot of rural people do. They don't really know what
they're getting into.''
</P>
<P>
   Ortiz is one of those city people. He paid a smuggler $100 last
Thursday, and promised to pay $400 later, to take him across the
border along with 12 other people. They crossed outside Laredo that
night and were picked up almost immediately and sent back to
Mexico. The band just regrouped and crossed a second time, Friday
morning.
</P>
<P>
   The coyote led them into the brush about a mile from the
Interstate, and they followed the line of the highway north. But
Ortiz dropped out and had stumbled back to the checkpoint by early
Friday evening, having gotten less than 18 miles into the United
States. Before the sun had set, he was full of ham and Gatorade and
said he wanted to be taken home.
</P>
<P>
   Benavides and two other agents drove him to the main bridge in
Laredo, where he was walked to the mid-point and disappeared into
the crowd.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll try it again as soon as he rests up and feels better,''
Benavides said. ``I hope he brings more water next time.''

WHISTLEBLOWER TROOPER AWARDED $1.5 MILLION 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By JOHN ELLEMENT  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ An unlikely alliance between an embattled state trooper
and a civil rights advocacy group has led to a $1.15 million jury
verdict in favor of the trooper, who contended the State Police
bureaucracy wrongly punished him for uncovering alleged criminal
acts by a federal informant.
</P>
<P>
   After just two hours of deliberations Tuesday, the Suffolk
Superior Court jury awarded Robert J. &UR;  &LR; Monahan compensatory damages
and issued a judgment for the emotional distress he has suffered
since 1993, when he notified his superiors that the informant
allegedly engaged in illegal wiretaps and money laundering.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan, 40, was represented by the American Civil Liberties
Union of Massachusetts and private attorney, Eric Maxwell. His case
was viewed as a major test of the state's 1994 whistleblower law.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan, who has been on the job since 1985, said several
lawyers rejected him before Maxwell and the ACLU agreed to
represent him. The ACLU, which champions individual rights,
frequently challenges police officers in court.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a sad state of affairs when a state trooper has to go the
ACLU and then has to wait five years to have someone held
responsible for breaking the law,'' Monahan said after the verdict.
``They (the ACLU) were there when no one else was.''
</P>
<P>
   The jury also found that now-retired Lt. Col. Francis D. Riley
violated the whistleblower law and ordered him to pay a total of $4
in compensatory and punitive damages. Riley, however, had already
been discharged as a defendant by Superior Court Judge Mitchell J.
Sikora, Jr., who also decided to let the jury decide Riley's role
for technical legal reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Assistant Attorney General James A. Sweeney, who represented the
state police, said he was ``disappointed'' by the verdict and will
file motions soon, including one asking Sikora to throw out the
verdicts.
</P>
<P>
   Maxwell said the evidence was overwhelming that Monahan was the
victim of commanders intent on silencing him after he found
evidence indicating that the federal source, private detective
Michael J. Taylor, was involved in laundering drug money and
illegal wiretapping in the early 1990s.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Taylor, a former Green Beret, was working
undercover for federal officials investigating a Merrimack Valley
hashish and gun smuggling ring with ties to Lebanon. With the
government's help, Taylor was portrayed as a murderous mercenary,
which helped him infiltrate the ring and lead to one of the largest
seizures of hashish in state history.
</P>
<P>
   Taylor has since been indicted in Middlesex County and pleaded
not guilty to state wiretapping charges.
</P>
<P>
   But when federal agents learned Monahan was focusing on Taylor,
Monahan was blackballed by his superiors, according to testimony
during the three-week trial. He eventually became what is believed
to be the first trooper not facing a specific disciplinary action
to be barred from criminal investigations.
</P>
<P>
   Testimony also showed that Monahan had become depressed as a
result of his fight with his own department.
</P>
<P>
   Monahan is the same officer involved in a fatal North End
shooting in March 1990. He was working a drug investigation in the
neighborhood when he shot and killed Eric Parziale. A judicial
inquest found no grounds for criminal charges.
</P>
<P>
   Though satisfied with the verdict and the judgment, Monahan said
he realizes both will be appealed, and and it could take years to
collect the money. He has remained a trooper througout the case,
assigned to the Massachusetts Turnpike.
</P>
<P>
   He said, however, that he may soon call it a career.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR;  ``Honestly, I don't know if I could ever go back,'' he said.
``I never had any enemies before I became a state trooper and
unfortunately, all the enemies I have made are in law
enforcement.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, Monahan also noted that some troopers had
stood by him, including now-retired State Police Sgt. Robert Cerra,
Monahan's former supervisor. Cerra backed Monahan's demand that the
US Justice Department investigate Taylor and his cozy relationship
with federal agents.

(af) 
 By MICHAEL KIMMELMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   I still recall Gary Hill's installation at Documenta 9 in
Kassel, Germany, with pleasure, even if it was a little hokey: in
the middle of the show, his work was a sanctuary behind blackout
curtains, a long room of videotaped images of people who seemed to
emerge from the darkness like ghosts, looking out at us, smiling,
frowning or whatever, then retreating as if in a dream.
</P>
<P>
   That was six years ago. Since then, what was no longer uncommon
even at that time has become so commonplace that very often it has
passed beyond cliche to parody: installation art is in the late
'90s roughly what Abstract Expressionism was by the late '50s.
</P>
<P>
   I suspect the term itself will eventually come to seem too vague
to be of lasting value. Art lingo, like all jargon, is more about
convenience than accuracy.
</P>
<P>
   Pop, Action Painting and Minimalism caught on for various
reasons. The relevant artists inevitably protested, not wanting to
be pigeonholed, and fortunately the niggling over terms tended to
produce a truer understanding of the art.
</P>
<P>
   Having exhausted their value, catchwords or phrases may then be
abandoned. Who remembers Commonism, for instance, which was an
early alternative to Pop? But unlike Pop, installation art is not
even a style or movement; it is a strategy, a way of working.
Having said that, we are not far along in describing it. What, if
anything, does it mean to say that dissimilar artists like Ilya
Kabakov, Robert Wilson, Robert Gober, Ann Hamilton, Robert Irwin,
Hans Haacke and Jason Rhoades all make installations? One person's
installation turns out to be another's earthwork or performance
space or video display or just plain sculpture.
</P>
<P>
   I noticed that a recent book called ``Installation Art''
proposes this as a definition: ``a kind of art making which rejects
concentration on one object in favor of a consideration of the
relationships between a number of elements or of the interaction
between things and their contexts.'' You see the problem. Not even
the book's publisher can really have believed that this was a
felicitous explanation.
</P>
<P>
   So we have barely begun to discuss the topic and already we are
lost. Let me therefore suggest that for the moment, we not fret
about the precise meaning of installation art and, following
Proust's paradoxical advice, analyze the thing before we worry
about what it is.
</P>
<P>
   Nothing, of course, is altogether new in art, technological
inventions aside, and certainly installation art is no exception.
Would anyone care to call Lascaux an example? I can see it.
Fast-forward 15,000 years or so and you can find installations
concocted in the 19th century by Albert Bierstadt for his own
exotic landscape paintings.
</P>
<P>
   Brancusi's Paris studio was an installation, too, considering
that he kept rearranging the sculptures in it, then photographing
the varied configurations as if they were works of art.
</P>
<P>
   And from between the two world wars there is Kurt Schwitters's
original ``Merzbau.'' Occupying several rooms of Schwitters's home
and studio in Hanover, Germany, it was a massive installation of
plaster, wire and wood, containing compartments, nooks and hidden
panels for a bizarre autobiographical assortment of hair, scraps of
friends' clothing, even bottles of Schwitters's urine.
</P>
<P>
   Max Ernst called ``Merzbau'' a huge abstract grotto, which is
precisely how it looks in the photographs taken of it before Allied
bombs destroyed it.
</P>
<P>
   Those historical examples notwithstanding, the real leap to
installation art as we now know it, I would argue, was made during
the 1960s and '70s when artists generally became attuned to the
context, political and otherwise, in which their works were seen.
</P>
<P>
   The gallery or museum was no longer regarded as a neutral
receptacle, an ethically blank space _ a fact that during the last
30 years we have so completely absorbed into our way of thinking
about art that it seems almost absurd to mention. Brian O'Doherty
put it this way 22 years ago in ``The White Cube: The Ideology of
the Gallery Space'': ``Now a participant in, rather than a passive
support for, the art, the wall became the locus of contending
ideologies.'' And: ``In a peculiar reversal, the object introduced
into the gallery frames the gallery and its laws.''
</P>
<P>
   I belabor the past to stress current installation art's
essential link to the cultural politics of the '60s and early '70s.
Whatever its formal kinship is with even older art, it grows out of
what happened 30-odd years ago: that we came to be aware of the
gallery as an active container of meaning and of ourselves as
implicit participants in the art.
</P>
<P>
   It was only natural, that being the case, that artists would
seek to shape the environment for their works. ``Once you had the
idea of the white cube,'' Rhoades has said, ``you wanted to fill it
up and to control how people entered it.''
</P>
<P>
   This is pretty much the essential operating principle of
installation art. When, for example, Kabakov installed a mock
Soviet hospital clinic in the last Whitney Biennial, he compelled
us to see the work on his terms. I don't mean that we forgot we
were in a museum. I mean the reverse: that he made us acutely aware
of being both in the museum and in a fictitious clinic. The two
occupied the same place in a kind of conceptual tension that was
essential to the work's odd poetry.
</P>
<P>
   Modern theater has operated in a similar way. Brecht wanted his
actors to present themselves to their audiences as actors,
subverting the make-believe divide between the stage and the real
world.
</P>
<P>
   Robert Wilson and Peter Greenaway are examples of artists known
primarily for their work in theater and film who, not
coincidentally, have found a congenial medium in installation art;
they also prove how the barriers among art forms have radically
dissolved during the last few decades, among other things causing a
freer flow of ideas, materials and techniques.
</P>
<P>
   Art today often seems to aspire to the conditions of theater and
film, installation art above all, literally shaping the stage on
which the work appears. I'm thinking of video and film
installations by artists besides Hill, like Douglas Gordon, Bruce
Nauman, Diana Thater and Sam Taylor-Wood, whose works depend on a
kind of physical interaction with viewers, their installations
becoming (rest in peace Harold Rosenberg) contemporary arenas for
action.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   I recall Ms. Taylor-Wood's installation at the last Venice
Biennale, for example: several screens showed different views of a
man breaking up with a woman in a restaurant. On one wall was the
woman weeping, on another the man fidgeting, and the audience stood
in between, awkwardly struggling to eavesdrop on snippets of barely
audible conversation.
</P>
<P>
   In that case, installation _ the use of multiple screens,
causing viewers to move around the room from one spot to another _
was a liberating device, adding a kind of sculptural dimension to
video, broadening the parameters of both mediums.
</P>
<P>
   The downside of cross-pollination with theater, on the other
hand, has been a general tendency toward melodrama. When
installation art fails, and too frequently it does, it naturally
seems to incline that way. It has often been mistaken by artists
for a license to do almost anything, the more the better (see the
work of the Chapmans).
</P>
<P>
   I leave it to others to decide what we should make of the
confluence of huge special-effects movies, extravagant Broadway
musicals and installation art in the '90s, but it is obvious that
at the moment we believe that spectacle may be allowed to supersede
content. It's hard to imagine, for instance, that many people could
see beyond the circuslike onslaught of sound and light of Mike
Kelley and Tony Oursler's recent installation at Metro Pictures
Gallery in Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   I take for granted some basic reasons for installation art's
rise. The collapsed art market at the end of the 1980s combined
with what, in retrospect, seems to have been a kind of collective
guilt about how art was turned into a commodity. No longer catering
to a clientele of buyers, installation art was frequently
impermanent, made of ephemeral materials and hence nearly
unmarketable (read: virtuous).
</P>
<P>
   Rhoades's installations, resembling vast junk shops of suburban
adolescent paraphernalia and neurosis, coyly organized, exemplified
a certain what-the-hell anti-'80s mode at its most buoyant and
mischievous.
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, installations accommodated documentary information
that was not as easily configured to the form of a painting,
sculpture or photograph. The rise of 90's-style political art and
installation art wasn't coincidental.
</P>
<P>
   Installation art proved to be too adaptable, in fact. Art
schools began to churn out installationists the way they used to
churn out de Kooning imitators; no wonder savvy young artists now
seem to be returning to painting (of a new, unorthodox kind).
</P>
<P>
   Curators have benefited the most, perhaps, from the fact that
installations, even if they aren't strictly site-specific _ that
is, even if they haven't been made just for one exhibition or place
_ often must be reconfigured for each show, so that they never
quite look the same twice. For curators, exhibitions of
installations can be a way to sidestep the real problem of making
tough esthetic judgments.
</P>
<P>
   The artists are chosen, given space, and then they decide what
to do. A generation of them now jets from one show to another
concocting variations on the same installations _ the new plop art.
</P>
<P>
   I am being grumpy. Installations, big ones anyway, are at least
well suited to address one nagging modern predicament, which is
that we have too much art to see. Blockbusters overwhelm us.
Museums are enormous. We forget what it is to look at one work at a
time, which after all is how artists make art.
</P>
<P>
   Installations virtually force us to do so by demanding a room
(more or less) of their own. They make us slow down simply because
they take more time to see. For better and worse, they are
aggressive consumers of space and attention.
</P>
<P>
   It is significant, I think, that both Matthew Barney and
Rhoades, two of the biggest young stars, prefer to be called
sculptors. Barney says that there is inherent in lots of
installation art a basic failure to distill ideas. This sounds
right. ``It's harder to learn how to say what you want by just
doing this,'' Barney says, mimicking a painter making a single
brush stroke.

KIDNAPPING COMPLICATES TALKS ON TAIWAN  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By SETH FAISON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   SHANGHAI, China _ Talks between China and Taiwan are always
touchy, because the main topic is a potential reunification of two
sides whose political systems have been fiercely opposed to each
other for so much of this century.
</P>
<P>
   Now hopes for a new round of talks, originally expected to be
held later this year, have been set back by a fresh disaster. A
legislator from Taiwan was kidnapped and killed last week in
northeastern China.
</P>
<P>
   The legislator, Lin Ti-chuan, was a member of Taiwan's main
opposition party, the Democratic Progressive Party. Ms. Lin was
found dead on July 31 in a hospital, where her abductors had
apparently dumped her body in a panic, after having accidentally
given her an overdose of drugs intended to knock her unconscious.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Progressive Party is despised by the Chinese
authorities, because it advocates declaring formal independence for
Taiwan. China still sees the island as a renegade province, even
though Taiwan has for all practical purposes operated independently
since the end of China's civil war in 1949.
</P>
<P>
   But the killing does not appear to be politically motivated.
Instead it looks like a bad case of a kidnapping gone awry, a crime
that is becoming a frightfully common occurrence in China. The
kidnappers are believed to have abducted Ms. Lin and her boyfriend,
a Taiwanese businessman, because he is involved in a dispute with a
Chinese company that took matters into its own hands.
</P>
<P>
   Officials in Beijing urged calm and expressed regret that a
Chinese official cut short a visit to Taiwan last week when the
news was reported there.
</P>
<P>
   ``Lin Ti-chuan's murder was a tragedy that we did not want to
see,'' one of Beijing's top negotiators with Taiwan, Liu Gangqi,
said. ``This incident was an isolated criminal case and should not
have a negative effect on relations between the two sides.''
</P>
<P>
   Yet the killing has caused wide concern in Taiwan, where public
opinion is inherently skeptical of mainland authorities, and it is
particularly sensitive to abuses of executives who are trying to
invest in China.
</P>
<P>
   The Democratic Progressive Party declared on Sunday that it
would stop organizing extensive exchanges with China.
</P>
<P>
   A spokesman for China's foreign ministry said enemies of
reunification were taking advantage of Ms. Lin's slaying to further
their aims.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Ms. Lin, 33, was a member of the City Council in Kaohsiung,
Taiwan's second largest city. She and her friend, Wei Tien-kang,
were kidnapped in Dalian on July 27 by three people who demanded a
$200,000 ransom, family members said.
</P>
<P>
   Wei apparently escaped and reported the case to the police in
Haicheng. But before they could locate Ms. Lin, her body was found
on Friday in a hospital mortuary in Haicheng. Her abductors were
apparently trying to drug her and accidentally gave her an overdose
of an anesthetic.
</P>
<P>
   The authorities have said they are hunting for the kidnappers,
who apparently took Ms. Lin to the hospital after she had fallen
into a coma.
</P>
<P>
   Chinese officials have said Wei owed a local company, Huamei

   Kidnappings of executives in China are growing more frequent,
often carried out by executives at a Chinese company who convince
the police and courts that an outsider is cheating residents. In
some cases, though, kidnappings occur where criminals feel that
they can get away with demanding hefty ransoms.

   Members of Ms. Lin's family complained that they had been
stranded in Haicheng and were unable to take Ms. Lin's body to
Taiwan for a burial because the Chinese police were insisting on an
autopsy, which family opposes.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Lin's death is a special embarrassment for Beijing, which is
always trying to convince the Taiwanese that mainland authorities
could be trusted to govern the island with the same autonomy being
granted in Hong Kong.

MOBSTER CONTRADICTS MAFIA INDUCTION CEREMONY TESTIMONY 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PATRICIA NEALON AND SHELLEY MURPHY  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   BOSTON _ A retired FBI official testified Tuesday that the
bureau didn't know for sure where the Mafia's legendary Oct. 29,
1989 induction ceremony would be held until mobsters from
throughout New England began arriving.
</P>
<P>
   That's why, according to Dennis O'Callaghan, the FBI needed a
``roving bug'' to capture the ceremony on tape, just in case the
location of the induction ceremony was switched from Medford, just
outside Boston, to another site.
</P>
<P>
   But, in duelling testimony in an adjacent courtroom, mobster
Angelo ``Sonny'' Mercurio said Tuesday he toured the home in
Medford two days before the ceremony to prep for the big event _
even arranging to bring in folding chairs _ then told the FBI where
and when it would happen.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI recorded four mobsters taking blood oaths as Mafiosi
detailed the violent rules of the secret, worldwide organization.
The tapes proved for the first time the existence of La Cosa
Nostra, more commonly known as the Mafia, and underpinned waves of
Mob prosecutions here and elsewhere.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the vaunted recordings are under attack in two separate
court cases. And Mercurio, the mobster-turned-informant who
attended the ceremony and shuttled mobsters to the gathering, has
become a sought-after witness.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, six days after testifying in a hearing before Judge
Nathaniel M. Gorton, Mercurio appeared before &UR;  &LR; Judge Mark L. Wolf.
Both judges, in separate cases, are considering defense motions to
bar the induction ceremony tapes as evidence because the judge who
authorized the listening devices was not told that the FBI knew
where the ceremony would be held and that a bureau informant would
be inside.
</P>
<P>
   Gorton is hearing a pretrial motion in the racketeering case of
15 mobsters and associates charged with trying to topple reputed
New England Mafia boss Francis P. Salemme in a bloody five-year
power struggle.
</P>
<P>
   Wolf is considering defense motions to suppress wiretaps and
bugs used to indict Salemme, mobster Robert DeLuca, and the leaders
of the Winter Hill Gang, Stephen Flemmi and fugitive James
``Whitey'' Bulger in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   O'Callaghan, former assistant special-agent-in-charge of the
Boston office of the FBI, testified before Gorton that Mercurio
``was never specific about the location.'' He also said that the
bureau had information from other informants suggesting that the
ceremony might be held in Providence, R.I. or Springfield, Mass.,
but mentioned no location.
</P>
<P>
   In later testimony before Gorton, FBI agent George P. Hurley
said that he knew three or four days before the ceremony that
convicted murderer Vincent Federico _ who Mercurio had said would
become a ``made'' member _ had been given a prison furlough for
that Sunday. In the furlough application Federico said he would be
visiting his sister and brother-in-law's Medford home.
</P>
<P>
   Hurley, who had reviewed Federico's furlough history at the
request of FBI supervisor James Ring, recognized the address and
knew that Federico had visited the home on previous furloughs.
</P>
<P>
   Yet when Judge David S. Nelson was asked to approve roving
surveillance of three mobsters on the evening of Oct. 27, 1989, two
days before the ceremony, no one told him that an induction
ceremony was planned at the Medford home.
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio, who is serving a nine-year prison term for
racketeering, testified Tuesday that in late September or early
October 1989 he told FBI Agent John Connolly and Ring, his
supervisor, the names of the four men _ including Federico _ who
would be baptized into the Mafia.
</P>
<P>
   Then, a week before the ceremony, Mercurio said he told the
agents ``it was definitely on for the 29th'' and he would shuttle
mobsters to the gathering from Medford and the North End.
</P>
<P>
   Two days before the ceremony, according to Mercurio, he toured
the Medford home with a couple of local Mafiosi, who concluded they
needed a dozen folding chairs to accommodate the 21 mobsters who
would be on hand for the induction ceremony.
</P>
<P>
   That afternoon, Mercurio testified, he called Connolly and told
him the induction ceremony would take place at Federico's
brother-in-law's home in Medford, but ``I didn't know the address,
I just know how to get there.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio said Connolly told him the FBI knew the address because
agents had been surveilling Mercurio that day.
</P>
<P>
   Later that night, Mercurio said Connolly and Ring tried to
pressure him to wear a body microphone during the ceremony and
testify against his friends in court. But, he told them, ``I ain't
testifying and I ain't wearing no wires.''
</P>
<P>
   On the morning of the ceremony, at least one mobster was worried
about surveillance, according to Mercurio.
</P>
<P>
   Capo regime Matthew Guglielmetti complained that an airplane
buzzing the Medford neighborhood had followed him and his crew from
Rhode Island, Mercurio said.
</P>
<P>
   ``So I waved,'' said Mercurio. ``I said, `What are they going to
do _ jump out?' I made a joke.''
</P>
<P>
   Mercurio said he was surprised the next day when Connolly
confirmed that the FBI had, in fact, followed the Rhode Island crew
by airplane.

   MARKET-ASSESS (New York) _ When the opening bell sounds on
Wednesday, what will happen if investors return for a second act
much like Tuesday's huge selloff? The answer: trading will not be
halted, as it was last Oct. 27, and the financial exchanges will do
little to intervene in the buying and selling of shares unless the
selling reaches epic proportions for a single trading session, with
a drop of greater than 10 percent in the Dow Jones industrial
average, something that has happened just twice: in Oct. 1929 and
Oct. 1987. That's because regulators and the operators of the
nation's financial exchanges have decided that trading should be
disrupted only when the market suffers an extraordinarily large
decline. By David Barboza.

   ISRAEL-HOUSING (Jerusalem) _ Israel's mortgage system has
produced a nation of homeowners. About 73 percent of the country's
citizens live in their own homes, compared with 66 percent in the
United States. Indeed, in Israel, home ownership is a type of
pioneerism, the modern-day method of settling the Jewish homeland.
Accordingly, the mortgage system has been used as a tool to further
development and other social ends. Now, though, the creaky system
is at a crossroads as it tries to keep up with the country's
growing population and Israel's shift from heavy state control to a
free market economy. By Jessica Steinberg.

LATEST TESTS CAN POINT DRESS STAINS AT SPECIFIC INDIVIDUAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARIE C. SANCHEZ  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Pinpointing the source of the alleged two-year-old stain on
Monica Lewinsky's dress is possible, but will require the latest
DNA identification techniques.
</P>
<P>
   DNA analysis can now identify a specific individual, as
fingerprints do, rather than simply including or excluding a
subject from an inquiry, according to Donald Kerr, FBI lab
director. The procedure, however, doesn't work in each case of DNA
typing.
</P>
<P>
   Where stains are concerned, tests identify the fluids as semen,
saliva, blood or other based on their properties and how they react
with antibodies, antigens, and other substances.
</P>
<P>
   For older or very small stains, a procedure known as polymerase
chain reaction is used to provide a bigger sample: the enzyme
polymerase makes many copies of the DNA fragments in a nutrient
bath _ much like a copy machine in a test tube.
</P>
<P>
   When experts have enough material to work with, chemicals are
used to wash, color and fix the DNA, enabling it to be typed.
</P>
<P>
   The reliability of this method, however, depends on the
condition of the DNA. Fragments don't provide as much information
as full DNA strands. Degradation of the DNA can occur over time,
and with exposure to elements.
</P>
<P>
   But Lewinsky's dress may have intact DNA.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cloth preserves DNA well,'' FBI spokesman Paul Bresson said.
``And if a sample wasn't left out in the elements, then the chances
are better of getting a good sample.''
</P>
<P>
   Samples of good quality in enough quantity _ say a dime-sized
semen stain or quarter-sized blood stain _ can produce DNA profiles
with probabilities that one individual in 260 billion will carry
that type.
</P>
<P>
   Given the age of the stain on Lewinsky's dress, it is more
likely that the probabilities of the DNA belonging to anyone but
the person with matching DNA will be in the range of one in 800,000
or 1 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's still pretty compelling evidence,'' Bresson said.
``We're not trying to determine anything beyond the science. That's
for someone else to determine.''
</P>
<P>
   The most reliable method of DNA testing _ restriction fragment
length polymorphism _ requires good sized samples of fresh
material. A chemical process produces DNA profiles in a series of
band patterns, which specialists match against known samples.
</P>
<P>
   But even in these best case scenarios, Bresson said, ``we
definitely can't establish identity from even half the samples we
get.''
</P>
<P>
   Bresson's only comment regarding Lewinsky's dress was, ``Last
week we received the dress. When we complete a forensic analysis,
we'll submit a report to (independent counsel Kenneth) Starr's
office.''

ONCE SHUNNED, CITY SUMMER SCHOOL NOW AT RECORD ENROLLMENT 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SOMINI SENGUPTA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Every morning inside a muggy, blue classroom on the
Lower East Side, a cluster of teen-age girls fresh from China try
to wrap their tongues around the strange sounds of English. A floor
above, a 17-year-old former dropout scrambles to make up for the
two years she spent working in a Chinatown beauty salon, instead of
at school. Around the corner, ignoring a boom box blasting on the
street below, a pair of anxious young women cram for exams that
have kept them from graduating.
</P>
<P>
   Here at Seward Park High School, a six-story limestone fortress
where generations of immigrants have become American teenagers,
there are actually more students taking classes this summer than
during the regular school year.
</P>
<P>
   For roughly one of every three high school students in the city,
the regular school year has quietly stretched into July and August.
These days, even as Schools Chancellor Rudy Crew and the state
legislature remain deadlocked over establishing year-round
schooling, summer has become a crucial third academic semester in
New York's public high schools _ a time when students cram for
crucial exams, rush to learn English or make up classes they have
failed. A handful earn credits to get ahead.
</P>
<P>
   In the last 10 years, the number of high school students taking
summer classes _ which are voluntary _ has risen 70 percent, to a
record of more than 110,000 this year, while total high school
enrollment has risen just 16 percent. Nearly half of the city's 200
high schools are open this summer. About 200,000 elementary and
middle school students are in summer classes, also a record.
</P>
<P>
   The dramatic expansion of summer school reflects, in large part,
the changing nature of the student body, according to scholars of
the school system. Many more immigrant students are coming into the
system, some of them lacking English and other academic skills,
while large numbers of native-born students are entering high
school after years of shoddy academic training in their
neighborhood schools.
</P>
<P>
   Ultimately, students are taking longer to graduate, but many
more of them are choosing to stay in school. Drop-out rates have
been declining steadily over the last several years, according to
Board of Education statistics; among last year's senior class, more
than a third of the students returned to school for a fifth year.
</P>
<P>
   ``More kids are seeing there really is no alternative to a high
school diploma, and they are investing a fifth year and even a
sixth year,'' said Norman Fruchter, director of the Institute for
Education and Social Policy at New York University. ``If that is
true, and I think it is, they would invest in summer school as
well.''
</P>
<P>
   At Seward Park, more than 2,000 teenagers are taking summer
classes this year. Two-thirds are drawn from the school's regular
enrollment of 2,300, and a handful come from other city high
schools. Because an annex houses the school's ninth-graders in the
fall, the main building is actually more crowded in summer.
</P>
<P>
   English as a Second Language is the most popular offering,
followed by math, social studies and English. School officials have
also provided a range of other services: A dentist visits twice a
week, offering some of the school's new immigrants the first
check-ups of their lives. There are English classes for parents,
table tennis in the afternoon and field trips offering some of the
youngsters access to the world north of Houston Street for the
first time.
</P>
<P>
   ``As an educator, I think it's a terrific opportunity for many
students who need intensive English as a second language or
remediation,'' said Kenneth Harvey, an assistant principal in
charge of Seward Park's summer program. ``Students know what they
need.''
</P>
<P>
   Faced with steadily growing demand, the school system has
provided additional funds to accommodate the summer students. After
the fiscal crisis of 1975, by contrast, funds dried up and summer
school enrollment plummeted, and for the next several years summer
classes were restricted only to seniors who needed them to
graduate. Since then, funding has kept up with the demand, dipping
only in 1995, when the school system imposed funding cuts. This
year, the Board of Education is spending an estimated $26 million
on summer classes for high school students.
</P>
<P>
   The Board is also spending an unprecedented $69 million on
summer classes for elementary and middle school students. Children
who were at risk of not being promoted were strongly urged to take
summer classes this year, and Crew sent a letter to parents of all
public-school children, encouraging them to take advantage of
summer school options.
</P>
<P>
   School officials say summer school is particularly important for
younger students who are falling behind, because they will be most
affected by higher standards being phased in _ new high school
graduation requirements and an end to social promotion, the
practice of advancing children from one grade to the next even if
they are not keeping up academically.
</P>
<P>
   But right now, the stakes are undeniably higher for students in
high school. For youngsters like 17-year-old Monica Moncada, summer
school offers a last chance to realize a modest dream: To be the
first in her family to graduate from high school and attend
college.
</P>
<P>
   She was ready to do so earlier this summer. But on the day
before commencement ceremonies, Monica was told she had failed the
Regents Competency Test in Global Studies. The test is required for
graduation and this was the second time she had failed _ this time
by only five points.
</P>
<P>
   The humiliation and disappointment are still fresh in her mind.
For years, Monica, the youngest of her mother's three girls, had
been urged to not repeat their mistakes _ not to get pregnant, not
to drop out of school, not to forsake her hope of becoming a nurse.
</P>
<P>
   So the other day, braving the stifling heat and the boom box
blasting on the schoolhouse steps four floors below, Monica sat in
a 90-minute Global Studies test review class, copying notes from
the blackboard on Confucius and the Opium Wars. If she passes the
exam when it is offered again on Aug. 13, she will be able to start
classes in September at Borough of Manhattan Community College. It
would be, she said, sort of a gift to her mother.
</P>
<P>
   ``To her,'' Monica said, ``it means a great deal that I
graduate.''

 NEW YORK: I graduate.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   In recent years, summer school has also become increasingly
popular around the country. As state policy makers, in an attempt
to raise academic standards, require students to pass more exams,
there are simply many more children who have to catch up, said
Kathy Christie, an analyst with the Education Commission of the
States, a private research group based in Denver. Summer school is
cheaper than extending the school calendar for all students, Ms.
Christie said.
</P>
<P>
   What distinguishes New York City's from many other school
systems is its large number of immigrant students, many of whom
arrive as teen-agers, some with only modest levels of education and
with precious little time to catch up. For them, July and August
can be critical.
</P>
<P>
   Take, for instance, Jimmy Gu's intensive English as a Second
Language class at Seward Park High. Among the roughly 20 teen-agers
here in Room 424, nearly all are from China, and most of them,
according to Gu, have had little more than a primary school
education back home. Most have been in this country for less than
two months, and they have been placed immediately in high school
because of their age _ mostly 15 and 16, but some as old as 19. By
law, they can remain in school until age 21, but to graduate, under
new state laws, they must now pass a rigorous six-hour English
Regents exam.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a very obvious academic gap,'' the teacher confided.
``Personally, I don't think these kids can pass the English
Regents.''
</P>
<P>
   One recent morning Gu was cajoling his students to interview
each other in English.
</P>
<P>
   Two students, Yan Xin, 16, and Wan Cili, 15, struggled with a
question about birthdays. Yan, a girl with an infectious laugh and
an innocence that gave away her newness to New York City, arrived
here five months ago, from a village in the rural southern province
of Guangdong. Wan, rail-thin and barely audible, landed only three
months ago from the same province.
</P>
<P>
   Around them, students mumbled softly to one another in more
comfortable tongues. The girls along the east wall spoke Cantonese,
the boys by the window conversed in Fujianese.
</P>
<P>
   Concentrating, Yan mouthed a perfect sentence in English.
``What's your date of birth?'' she asked. She tapped her throat
lightly and made a face, as if she had swallowed something bitter.
Smiling, Gu nodded in approval.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1995-96 school year, the most recent year for which
figures are available from the Board of Education, about a third of
all ninth- and 10th-grade students in the city were older than the
norm _ age 14 for freshmen and 15 for sophomores.
</P>
<P>
   Jenny Chen, 17, is a freshman at Seward Park. She dropped out of
school two years ago, right after eighth grade, and began working
full-time at a nearby beauty salon. She passed on a portion of her
earnings to her father, with whom she lives in Chinatown, and
sometimes sent some to her mother, back home in Guangzhou. Only
recently did she begin to realize that without a high school
diploma, the world beyond the beauty salons of Chinatown would
always be beyond her grasp.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't realize before the importance of education,'' she
said. ``If I go to school and get an education, I'll earn more
money.''
</P>
<P>
   Last year, Jenny, a gregarious girl with dyed red hair and
eyebrows painted in a perfect arch, returned to school. This
summer, she is in class three hours a day. In the fall, she plans
to take classes after school. She hopes to become a social worker.
</P>
<P>
   For now, she has given up her salon job, since she is burning to
finish school. ``I'm dying to,'' she said breathlessly the other
day. ``I'm dying to get these credits. I give myself two and a half
years _ well, not more than three years.''

NEW LIFE FOR WORK BY ADAMS  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ALLAN KOZINN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It may disturb the composer John Adams that his operas have not
been revived, as reported in these pages, but there is a grain of
consolation: ``Phrygian Gates,'' a 20-year-old piano work by Adams,
is apparently becoming a favorite of new-music pianists.
</P>
<P>
   Available for years only on a single, small-label recording by
Mack McCray (and only on LP), it was given a second wind in 1989,
when Ursula Oppens included it in an inspired pairing with Elliott
Carter's ``Night Fantasies.'' Recordings by John McCabe and
Christopher O'Riley followed, and now Gloria Cheng-Cochran offers
the second recording of the work to be released this year (after
Hermann Kretzschmar's performance on an Adams disk from the
Ensemble Modern on RCA): a beautifully delineated, unusually vivid
account (Telarc CD-80513).
</P>
<P>
   At a glance, the work would seem to admit little variety in
performance: it grows from a trickle of repeated notes into a
torrent of slowly shifting figures in Phrygian and Lydian modes,
and once it attains its critical mass, it modulates around the
cycle of keys with an almost motorlike steadiness. Yet there is
ample flexibility in weight, coloration, dynamics and, to a lesser
degree, even tempo.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cheng-Cochran uses these opportunities to mold a
personalized performance that keeps the work more dramatic than
hypnotic. Her reading of the chordal central section is dark, gauzy
and more overtly Lisztian than any of the competitors.
</P>
<P>
   On the same disk, Ms. Cheng-Cochran makes nearly as strong a
case for Adams's ``China Gates,'' a shorter, simpler and more
delicate study from 1977, which proceeds along similar lines. And
for variety, she offers two recent works by Terry Riley, in which
links to the Minimalist past are subsidiary to reinvestigations of
earlier forms, both classical and popular.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Walrus in Memoriam'' is Riley's 1991 contribution to Aki
Takahashi's ``Hyper Beatles,'' a series in which several dozen
contemporary composers provided glosses on the Beatles' music.
Riley's subject was ``I Am the Walrus,'' but only its barest shadow
is recognizable: ragtime episodes are interspersed with more
intensely focused chromatic deconstructions of the song's chord
progression.
</P>
<P>
   The five movements of ``The Heaven Ladder,'' Book 7, of 1994,
range more widely. A hint of the finale of Prokofiev's Seventh
Piano Sonata drifts through the opening movement, ``Misha's Bear
Dance.'' ``Venus in '94'' is an impressionistic waltz, sometimes
alluringly chromatic, sometimes almost a salon piece. Ragtime
returns, combined with fugal techniques, in ``Ragtempus Fugatis,''
and harmonic quirkiness colors the final two movements, a vibrant
fandango and a gentle lullaby.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Cheng-Cochran is at home in the variety of styles Riley
demands. In fact, her ability to make the ragtime passages swing
and the ruminative sections sound comfortable beside the raucous
ones imposes a sense of coherence on movements that could easily
unravel into a loose stylistic melange.

PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES TURNING TO CORPORATE-STYLE ADS TO LURE
STUDENTS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ala., Ind., Minn., Pa.)  (nk) 
 By IAN ZACK   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   It was a slick 30-second television commercial that could easily
have been touting a brand of car, blue jeans or soft drink. Set to
a moody conga beat, the ad opened with a close-up of crystalline
tap water gushing from a shiny kitchen faucet. Then a throaty
announcer weighed in as the liquid slowed to a muddy brown trickle:
</P>
<P>
   ``Considering that Auburn University is responsible for the
design, construction and management of water supply systems that
supply clean drinking water to 85 percent of the people in our
state, it seems only fair to pose the question: Where would Alabama
be without Auburn?''
</P>
<P>
   For years college officials have called it the ``M-word,'' the
signpost to a slippery slope on which most public universities
feared to tread. Madison Avenue-style marketing, they worried,
might backfire on them by placing style over substance and damaging
their credibility.
</P>
<P>
   But corporate-style marketing has lately become hot in academia.
Universities like Auburn are buying commercials on prime-time
television and radio, inventing corporate-sounding slogans and
basing new academic programs on market surveys and research. They
are doing this, they say, to compete for students in an ever
tighter market and to counter attacks from politicians who say
their budgets are bloated.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn, for example, a leader in the marketing trend, began its
slick statewide television ad campaign last spring to influence
state legislators, university officials said. Partly paid for by
Alabama taxpayers, it included interstate billboards and radio
spots.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were looking at a very difficult situation here of three
years of no increased funding for higher education,'' said Auburn
president, William Muse. ``So we decided to take matters into our
own hands.''
</P>
<P>
   It is not as if universities have never sent out promotional
brochures to prospective students or guarded their media images
with care, but these newfangled marketing efforts have a decidedly
different flavor.
</P>
<P>
   Indiana University, for instance, recently closed its university
news office and opened an Office of Communications and Marketing,
headed by a marketing expert.
</P>
<P>
   The university conducted a marketing campaign last year to
increase its applicant pool, after applications were flat or
declining for four years straight. Focus groups made up of
potential students, business leaders and politicians discussed
Indiana's image and competitiveness, and then the university bought
television, radio and newspaper ads.
</P>
<P>
   The result: Last spring, applications were up 9 percent, while
the number of Indiana high school graduates rose only 2 percent.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too many people in higher education believe marketing is smoke
and mirrors, it's Madison Avenue advertising,'' said Christopher
Simpson, Indiana University's vice president for government
relations and community affairs. ``For years we've had to call it
the M-word. We've only been able in the last few years to come out
and say it.''
</P>
<P>
   Simpson said he believed that public universities had been
forced to act by political attacks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The money coming to higher education is on a pretty steady
decline,'' he said. At the same time, ``the calls for
accountability in the legislature have been great. We're asked,
`How many classes are your faculty teaching? What are students
paying and what are they getting for it?'''
</P>
<P>
   In the fall of 1996, market surveys and focus groups revealed to
University of Minnesota officials that taxpayers valued teaching of
undergraduates far more than research, which the school had long
emphasized.
</P>
<P>
   So the school changed not its programs but its message, making
sure that top officials always mentioned teaching ahead of research
in public speeches and that brochures reflected the same emphasis.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to address core expectations first,'' said Tom De
Ranitz, associate director of marketing for the university, ``and
the core expectation was that we are going to educate the sons and
daughters of Minnesota.'' De Ranitz, who talks of the school
``brand'' and students and their parents as customers, added, ``If
a McDonald's isn't clean, it doesn't matter how good the food is.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, to hedge its bets, the university's private foundation
used a statewide radio advertising campaign last fall to promote
the school's development of the retractable seat belt and the
``black box'' flight recorder. The campaign slogan, using the
university's single letter nickname, was uncannily similar to
Auburn's: ``It's hard to imagine Minnesota without the U.''
</P>
<P>
   The use of an aggressive marketing approach does not sit well
with some who fear a further seeping of the corporate ethos into
the Ivory Tower.
</P>
<P>
   Larry Arbeiter, director of communications for the University of
Chicago, said universities ``did not become what they are by
focusing very narrowly on what people want to hear about us, by
doing marketing research.''
</P>
<P>
   While Arbeiter acknowledged that many public universities did
not have the benefit of multibillion-dollar endowments to ensure
financial stability, like the University of Chicago, he questioned
whether the money spent on market research could better be used on
scholarships for needy students and faculty salaries, a sentiment
others share.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the long run if you don't deliver the goods,'' said
Margaret Miller, president of the American Association of Higher
Education, ``no amount of marketing is going to help you.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   ``The negative view you can have of marketing is it's puffery,
it's good news, it's manipulation,'' Ms. Miller added. ``I hope
that PR and marketing don't replace another effort which I think
needs to be emphasized and that is getting really serious
information out there about what they do.`
</P>
<P>
   But proponents say that is exactly what they are trying to do.
</P>
<P>
   ``Universities are not marketing ice to Eskimos,'' said Eustace
Theodore, president of the Council for Advancement and Support of
Education, the international professional association for college
public relations officers. The council this spring published its
first marketing primer for colleges and universities.
</P>
<P>
   But Theodore contends that universities are turning to marketing
simply to tell their stories better and to more people, not out of
any desire to put style ahead of substance.
</P>
<P>
   One example is Pennsylvania State University, whose market
surveys showed recently that state residents had overestimated
school tuition by an average of several thousand dollars. The
university initiated what officials said was a successful effort to
counter the false perception.
</P>
<P>
   Penn State's four-year-old marketing office, one of the
country's first at a public university, has as one of its primary
missions ``conducting institutional image studies,'' according to
the university Web site.
</P>
<P>
   Auburn, meanwhile, on the heels of its television advertising
campaign, received millions in new financing for next year,
overcoming resistance by Republican Gov. Fob James.
</P>
<P>
   ``The people who had boys and girls at Auburn started writing
and talking to their local legislators and even the governor's
office,'' said Pete Turnham, a Democratic state representative who
is retiring. ``Anytime you can draw in $29.5 million for new
buildings and $16 million in new operating money, you're not doing
too bad.''

A BOLD REMINDER BETTER THAN HINT ON SPECIAL DAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Tell him what you want.
</P>
<P>
   That is all my advice for women in relationships.
</P>
<P>
   Why invite unnecessary heartache into your home when you've
already got more problems than you need? Thankfully, you can't read
his mind and he can't read yours, either.
</P>
<P>
   Some things are better left unsaid, anyway.
</P>
<P>
   For example, my birthday is coming up in a couple of months, and
I am wasting no time or energy being subtle. I am not hinting or
hoping for a cake and a gift. I am coming right out with it,
indirectly.
</P>
<P>
   I have written the date in red ink on every calendar in our
home. I have even marked it in my husband's day planner and
highlighted it.
</P>
<P>
   Additionally, I went back one week on his planner and reminded
him to start looking for a present. I don't know what else I can
do. But if I don't get something awesome for my birthday, I think I
have every right to be upset.
</P>
<P>
   We've known each other for 18 wonderful years and he's never
forgotten a special occasion, but I'm not taking any chances. I
only get one birthday a year and, by golly, it should be fabulous.
</P>
<P>
   Now my friend, Marisha, doesn't agree with me. She thinks it's
evil to remind your beloved of upcoming special days. Maybe so, but
Marisha's the one who called me at seven o'clock one night last
year crying.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's my anniversary,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's great,'' I replied. ``Happy Anniversary. How did you
guys celebrate?''
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't,'' she wailed. ``He forgot again. He's in the den
watching the ballgame.''
</P>
<P>
   ``Who's playing, uh, I mean that's terrible. Just go in there
and give him what for, and make him take you out to dinner or
something.''
</P>
<P>
   She just boo-hooed.
</P>
<P>
   ``He just forgot,'' I said. ``You know he loves you. He's got a
lot on his mind, but I'm sure he cares.''
</P>
<P>
   ``You don't understand,'' she sobbed. ``If he loved me, he'd
remember.''
</P>
<P>
   Well, of course, I did understand.
</P>
<P>
   That's how I feel about toilet seats.
</P>
<P>
   Anyway, it took two days of the silent treatment before
Marisha's beloved remembered their anniversary.
</P>
<P>
   This year, though, she took my advice and told him to go to
Victoria's Secret and get her a Kelly green terry cloth robe and
matching slippers. She even wrote the sizes down. That way, she got
something she wanted, and Beloved was so proud that he even threw
in some perfume and a nice card that he'd selected all by himself.
</P>
<P>
   No, it's not romantic. He should've remembered.
</P>
<P>
   And maybe, just maybe, he would've found a lovely gift that she
adored without a single bit of help from her.
</P>
<P>
   But, yes, it sure beats spending the night crying and moping on
what's supposed to be a happy occasion.
</P>
<P>
   If he doesn't need any help, great.
</P>
<P>
   But if he does ...
</P>
<P>
   Just tell him.

   ARMY-SECRETS _ WASHINGTON _ The U.S. Army ran its program for
visiting foreign military officers with such slipshod procedures
that foreign governments got access to American military secrets ,
newly released internal Defense Department documents reveal. ``This
situation poses a significant risk to the Army's current and future
combat capability,'' the Army's deputy chief of staff for
intelligence wrote last year to the Army's inspector general. The
terse memo from Maj. Gen. Claudia J. Kennedy is among several
critical reports obtained by Cox Newspapers under the Freedom of
Information Act. (Malone and Carollo, Cox News Service 1150).

   SHOOTINGS _ WASHINGTON _ Despite schoolhouse shootings that have
shocked the nation in the past two years, a dispassionate analysis
of national data shows the homicide rate among teenagers and young
adults is declining. Analysts with the National Institute for
Health Statistics in Hyattsville, Md., report in the Journal of the
American Medical Association that while the decline in homicide
rates for adolescents and young adults declined in every
demographic category between 1993 and 1995, there was ``significant
decline'' for black males between 15 and 24. (Nesmith, Cox News
Service 500)

<P>
   GINGRICH _ WASHINGTON _ The House's approval of a campaign
finance reform measure adamantly opposed by Speaker Newt Gingrich
and other GOP leaders has, not for the first time, raised the
question of who's in charge. Gingrich's promised tobacco bill aimed
at teenage smokers is on hold. There is little prospect for an
agreement on cutting taxes. Even the Gingrich-backed candidate in
southwest Georgia lost his primary. (Sherman, Cox News Service).
</P>
<P>
   FARMERS _ WASHINGTON _ East Texas farmers and ranchers suffering
through a devastating heat wave will have a chance to talk to USDA
officials Wednesday about federal drought assistance programs. Rep.
Max Sandlin, D-Texas, has organized a videoconference which will
connect officials in Washington with farmers at several sites in
East Texas. Sandlin hopes farmers will tell the USDA what they do
and do not need to cope with the emergency situation. (Moscoso, Cox

   TX-PRISON-HEAT _ The prison system has ordered almost $700,000

13 convicts and staff so far -- two fatally. That adds up to 1,884
fans that will go to105 units. (Ward, Austin American-Statesman).

   HURRICANE _ HOLDEN BEACH, N.C. _ With the hurricane season's
first tropical storm, Alex, plodding along far out in the Atlantic
Ocean, this coastal North Carolina town's new $1 million dune
appears invincible. But locals know that, if a big storm blows in,
the manmade dune guarding $400,000 beachfront homes would be as
vulnerable as a child's sand castle at high tide. During 1997 and
so far this summer, the East Coast has been spared from hurricanes,
but forecasters see potential for trouble in Alex, meandering west
of the Leeward Islands more than 2,000 miles from the Carolinas'
beaches. (Burritt, Atlanta Journal-Constitution).

   MORELAND _ German radio, London tabs, the New York Daily News,

TOBACCO TALKS SAID TO BE AT IMPASSE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Wash., N.C., Fla., Minn., Miss., Texas)  (bl) 
 By BARRY MEIER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Negotiators involved in talks aimed at reaching a new national
tobacco settlement said those discussions had reached an impasse.
They said that meetings planned for this week between state
attorneys general and cigarette industry lawyers had been called
off.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are difficult, non-economic issues that have to be
worked through, and it will take time to do that,'' said Washington
state Attorney General Christine Gregoire, one of the principal
negotiators involved in the talks.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Gregoire did not elaborate. But lawyers familiar with the
talks said that tobacco producers are concerned that small
cigarette companies who do not participate in a settlement accord
will gain a competitive advantage.
</P>
<P>
   That is because those producers will not be bound by advertising
restrictions contained in an agreement and will also be able to
undercut larger cigarette makers on price because they will not
have to bear the price of a settlement, those lawyers said.
</P>
<P>
   Under last year's $368.5 billion tobacco proposal reached
between the industry and state attorneys general, companies that
were not part of that deal would have had to post large financial
bonds to cover potential court judgements against them.
</P>
<P>
   Congress declined to adopt legislation to enact that accord. And
lawyers involved in the latest talks said that without
Congressional authority they face both constitutional and legal
problems in fashioning a method that will require non-participating
producers to abide by an accord.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview, North Carolina Attorney General Mike Easley
said that while the major tobacco companies control about 98
percent of sales, that picture could change.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to design a settlement agreement that will cover them
as well,'' said Easley.
</P>
<P>
   Other state officials familiar with the talks said they were
less concerned about the issue of smaller tobacco manufacturers
because the major cigartte makers are the subject of their
lawsuits. Also, producers in settling lawsuits filed by Florida,
Minnesota, Mississippi and Texas did not insist that non-defendants
in those actions be forced to comply with settlement terms.
</P>
<P>
   Scott Williams, a spokesman for the tobacco industry, declined
comment on the status of the negotiations. The companies involved
are Philip Morris Cos., R.J. Reynolds Tobacco, Brown &AMP; Williamson
Tobacco, Lorillard Tobacco and UST.
</P>
<P>
   The latest round of settlement talks started last month and
continued last week in New York.

TEMPERATURE DIPS BELOW 100-DEGREE MARK IN NORTH TEXAS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By EVAN MOORE 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FORT WORTH, Texas _ The summer of 1998 lost its bid for the
worst on record Tuesday when temperatures dipped below the
100-degree mark for the first time in 29 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is going to have a good run for second place, however,''
said Tommy Kircher with the National Weather Service in Fort Worth.
</P>
<P>
   Scattered rain and overcast skies caused the record-setting heat
wave to break, albeit slightly, in the North Texas area. Tuesday's
high was recorded at 94 degrees at Dallas-Fort Worth International
Airport.
</P>
<P>
   That leaves the record with 1980, a year in which 69 consecutive
days of 100-plus temperatures were recorded.
</P>
<P>
   Other prolonged periods of scorching weather occurred in the
early 1950s. The second worst year to date occurred in 1954, when
52 days of 100-plus temperatures were logged. That was preceded by
44 days in 1952 and followed by 48 days in 1956.
</P>
<P>
   This summer is far from over, however, and Kircher said this
season may well surpass those years.
</P>
<P>
   The heat wave has caused 106 deaths this year in Texas.
</P>
<P>
   Public health agencies have been involved since residents began
dying and Dallas County sheriff's deputies have been delivering ice
water to elderly residents without air conditioning for several
weeks.
</P>
<P>
   The searing heat also has dried the North Texas soil to the
point that cracks as wide as 2 inches or more can be seen in some
areas. As a result, the subsoil has begun to shift, causing a
plethora of pipeline breaks in Fort Worth and prompting an outside
watering ban in the city.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not quite as bad as the winter of 1983,'' said Fort Worth
city spokesman Pat Svacina. ``The temperature dropped to zero then
and we had two to three weeks of constant pipeline breaks.
</P>
<P>
   ``But it's getting close.''
</P>
<P>
   The worst of the breaks occurred Sunday, when a 90-inch line
leading from Richland-Chambers Reservoir near Corsicana to Lake
Arlington ruptured. The line normally carries 138 million gallons
of water daily and the break disrupted that supply for more than 24
hours.
</P>
<P>
   Other breaks have virtually shut down the downtown area when
lack of water service caused air-conditioning systems to fail and
two performances of ``The Phantom of the Opera'' at Fort Worth's
new Bass Hall were canceled.
</P>
<P>
   And Kircher warned that the ``opera'' is far from over.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's doubtful we'll reach the 1980 record now,'' he said.
``But I'm still betting on second place.''

 ADVERTISING: FASHION CAMPAIGNS TAKE CUES FROM 1950s  
(duplication warning: also sent with `L' code) 
(bl) 
 By JENNIFER STEINHAUER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fashion advertisements are often incomprehensible _ a
pastiche of images of half-naked women, perhaps, barely interacting
with the product they are supposed to be selling.
</P>
<P>
   They have also been rather grim; remember the plethora of
so-called heroin chic ads, so popular in the last couple of years,
which made use of unwashed, sad-faced models slouching in the
corner of the page?
</P>
<P>
   But lately, things have become very happy. Models are madly
dancing to swing music in spots for the Gap's khakis, or literally
skipping down Isaac Mizrahi's runway.
</P>
<P>
   Ratcheting up all this good cheer are some campaigns that make
heavy use of images borrowed from television shows and retail
catalogs from the 1950s, perhaps the ultimate happy American
decade. Some '50s fashions are back, too: Pleated skirts, sweater
sets and flat shoes are again the rage.
</P>
<P>
   The most aggressive use of retro-joy comes from a new campaign
by the New York fashion company Kenar Enterprises Ltd. In recent
years, Kenar advertisements showed the company's signature model,
Linda Evangelista, in scenes from the Italian countryside.
</P>
<P>
   But in its new eight-page advertisement, which will make its
debut in the September issue of Vogue, Ms. Evangelista appears in
scenes lifted straight from ``Leave it to Beaver.'' In the opening
page, the model poses with her make-believe husband, son and
daughter, all smiling effusively in front of a fireplace, its
mantle covered with duck decoys. Dad holds a pipe.
</P>
<P>
   In the inside pages, all black and white, Ms. Evangelista wears
Kenar dresses as she bakes an apple pie or vacuums.
</P>
<P>
   The campaign ``was almost in direct response to the American
feeling today,'' said Charles DeCaro, creative director for
Laspata/DeCaro Studio, the New York agency responsible for the $3
million campaign.
</P>
<P>
   ``Consumer confidence is high, and happy days are here again,''
he added. ``This ad portrays Americana in its purest semblance.''
</P>
<P>
   Barneys New York, the chic retailer, which rarely finds itself
behind a trend, is taking similar cues from previous decades. Simon
Doonan, the creative director for Barney's Inc., got his
inspiration for the fall direct marketing campaign from vintage
Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. and Montgomery Ward catalogs that he picked up
at a flea market.
</P>
<P>
   The mailer, which goes to Barneys' 50,000 biggest spenders, is a
direct takeoff from those books, with models holding their hands in
pretty poses close to their face, high school yearbook style.
</P>
<P>
   There are also pages with a dozen shoes arranged in a daisy
pattern _ a big departure from fashion advertisements that often
barely show a single product. Doonan even sought out Vogue Wright,
the agency that shot the still-life photography for the old Sears
and Ward books, for the Barneys mailer.
</P>
<P>
   ``Designer customers are OD'd on art direction,'' Doonan said.
``There is something incredibly sweet about the hokeyness and
simplicity of this.'' On one page, models wearing cashmere and
angora coats by Battistoni are posed next to a fence, umbrellas in
hand, taking shelter from rain fashioned out of exclamation points.
``It doesn't say `Barneys is ultra hip,''' Doonan remarked. ``It's
an inclusive sight gag.''
</P>
<P>
   Current fashion trends work well with these campaigns. ``Luxury
is a big theme in fashion right now,'' said Marin Hopper, fashion
director of Elle magazine. ``In the 50s, there was the same
sensibility, like the camel hair coats and pleated skirts. They are
feel-good clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Kenar and Barneys campaigns may owe a debt to the noted
fashion photographer Steven Meisel, who last year created a 1950s
style layout for Italian Vogue. On the cover, a family smiled and
waved wildly from the back of a station wagon, the ``father''
eerily a ringer for the lead character in the 1998 film ``The
Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   This visual reference is more than a passing coincidence. There
is an almost-creepy underlying joke to all this fun. Just as Truman
found that underneath the surface of his cheery existence was a
terrible secret, the creators of these ad campaigns seem to be
conscious that the Cold War, sexual inequality and racial strife
tarnished the 1950s sheen.
</P>
<P>
   They are reviving the notion of endless glee, but they are slyly
aware of its chinks _ perhaps this time in the form of an
infectious Asian economic crisis, endless African tragedies or the
spread of AIDS, which gets its own reference through a charitable
promotion in the Barneys book. What is more, while most fashion
advertising seeks to create aspiration (you, too, will look like
Kate Moss if you buy this skirt), probably few women aspire to be
dolled up in cashmere for some baking or vacuuming.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed both campaigns are not just retreating to another era for
inspiration; they are inescapably campy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost an element of bad design about this piece,''
said Doonan about the Barneys' mailer he created. ``Just like the
catalogs we're aping.''

   Current fashion trends work well with these campaigns. ``Luxury
is a big theme in fashion right now,'' said Marin Hopper, fashion
director of Elle magazine. ``In the 50s, there was the same
sensibility, like the camel hair coats and pleated skirts. They are
feel-good clothes.''
</P>
<P>
   Both the Kenar and Barneys campaigns may owe a debt to the noted
fashion photographer Steven Meisel, who last year created a 1950s
style layout for Italian Vogue. On the cover, a family smiled and
waved wildly from the back of a station wagon, the ``father''
eerily a ringer for the lead character in the 1998 film ``The
Truman Show.''
</P>
<P>
   This visual reference is more than a passing coincidence. There
is an almost-creepy underlying joke to all this fun. Just as Truman
found that underneath the surface of his cheery existence was a
terrible secret, the creators of these ad campaigns seem to be
conscious that the Cold War, sexual inequality and racial strife
tarnished the 1950s sheen.
</P>
<P>
   They are reviving the notion of endless glee, but they are slyly
aware of its chinks _ perhaps this time in the form of an
infectious Asian economic crisis, endless African tragedies or the
spread of AIDS, which gets its own reference through a charitable
promotion in the Barneys book. What is more, while most fashion
advertising seeks to create aspiration (you, too, will look like
Kate Moss if you buy this skirt), probably few women aspire to be
dolled up in cashmere for some baking or vacuuming.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed both campaigns are not just retreating to another era for
inspiration; they are inescapably campy.
</P>
<P>
   ``There is almost an element of bad design about this piece,''
said Doonan about the Barneys' mailer he created. ``Just like the
catalogs we're aping.''

U.S. PRIVATIZATION MOVE THREATENS DEAL TO BUY ENRICHED RUSSIAN
URANIUM  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MATTHEW L. WALD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A $12 billion deal to turn surplus bomb uranium in
Russia into fuel for American nuclear power plants is threatened by
recent moves that will cut uranium prices and give Russia less
revenue.
</P>
<P>
   The governmental agreement, drawn up in 1992, was intended to
prevent Russia's highly enriched uranium, the fuel for the simplest
nuclear bomb, from falling into the wrong hands and to provide hard
currency to the cash-starved Russian government.
</P>
<P>
   It called for the United States to buy 500 tons of highly
enriched uranium from 1995 to 2005, enough to supply tens of
thousands of nuclear bombs. The United States was to have diluted
the uranium, sold it to civilian power plants and given the
Russians ordinary uranium in exchange.
</P>
<P>
   In addition the Russians assumed that they would receive $8
billion for the enriched uranium and $4 billion by selling the
ordinary uranium over 20 years.
</P>
<P>
   By Jan. 1, 1998 the United States had taken delivery of 36 tons
of uranium.
</P>
<P>
   But the agreement has hit a snag. Last month the United States
sold the federal uranium-processing operation that is supposed to
do much of the work for the deal with Russia.
</P>
<P>
   And that company, the United States Enrichment Corp., is
planning to sell off a great deal of its own uranium, more than 70
million pounds.
</P>
<P>
   That is certain to lower uranium prices, possibly to half of
what the Russians were expecting, market analysts said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russians are crying foul, and they are casting doubt on a
variety of aspects of Russian-American nuclear cooperation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The transfer of the 78 million pounds of uranium to the
enrichment corporation was a huge mistake,'' Pete Domenici, R-N.M.,
who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee, said. ``The ripple
effects of that decision will probably result in a national
security issue of high importance.''
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials concede that lower prices are quite
likely and that the uranium that Russia wants to sell will be worth
less. But the officials add that they do not believe that the
changes will scuttle the deal.
</P>
<P>
   ``Russia's fundamental economic interest is to continue to carry
out the agreement,'' said a White House official who insisted on
anonymity, because Russia would still earn money from the enriched
uranium and would be able to sell the natural uranium.
</P>
<P>
   Even if the Russians cannot sell all the natural uranium they
want at desirable prices, ``our judgment is they will follow that
fundamental economic interest,'' the official said. He predicted
that Russia would continue with the part of the deal that requires
it to blend down the bomb-grade material.
</P>
<P>
   But the official conceded that ``there may very well need to be
further negotiations.''
</P>
<P>
   In Moscow, Atomic Energy Minister Yevgeny Adamov, was less
sanguine. In a letter to Domenici he said the prospects for the
agreement were ``dramatically deteriorating.''
</P>
<P>
   The privatization, he wrote, ``constitutes deviation of the U.S.
party from the implementation of agreed provisions.''
</P>
<P>
   He said the move made it harder for him to win approval for
strategic-arms agreements and for American participation in
projects to secure nuclear materials in Russia.
</P>
<P>
   Another administration official in Washington suggested that the
complaints by the private uranium companies might simply be an
effort to obtain the material from the Russians more cheaply.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Maj. Gen. William Burns, the former director of the Arms Control
and Disarmament Agency who negotiated the original deal, said the
accord was threatened now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now,'' Burns said, ``it seems that we have our
priorities mixed up, and we've allowed a commercial good to
overcome a national security goal, and I think that's wrong.''
</P>
<P>
   The deal is a multistep arrangement in which the Russians are
selling a service, the enrichment, to the enrichment corporation
and are seeking to sell a commodity, the uranium itself, to a group
of international uranium companies.
</P>
<P>
   The federal government wants to pay to buy the enrichment, but
not the uranium itself, a little like paying for the value of
cleaning and pressing a shirt, but not the shirt.
</P>
<P>
   Uranium as found in nature is a mixture of two types, and
separating them to obtain the fissionable material most useful in
bombs and reactors is called enrichment. Less than 1 percent of the
natural mix is uranium 235, which is fissionable. Bomb-grade
uranium is more than 90 percent uranium 235.
</P>
<P>
   After having painstakingly concentrated the uranium 235 over the
years, the Russians have agreed to dilute it to 5 percent, the
mixture that power plants use.
</P>
<P>
   With U.S. help, the Russians lined up three Western companies to
buy the ordinary uranium. But when the companies saw the enrichment
corporation's plans to sell more uranium, they grew nervous.
</P>
<P>
   The chairman of one company, Bernard Michel, of the Cameco Corp.
of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, said his company would be agreeing to
buy the uranium at a time when the price was all but certain to
decline.
</P>
<P>
   Cameco and the other two companies, Nukem GmbH, part of the RWE
A.G. Group, the huge German utility in Essen, and the Cogema Group
of Velizy, France, which is 86 percent owned by the French
government, had agreed to pay $34 a kilogram, even as the market
price has already declined to $28, Michel said.
</P>
<P>
   The Russian Duma agreed to that deal on July 17. But Cameco
withdrew, and a Cogema official said that a decision by the
enrichment corporation to sell the uranium now could make the sale
of the Russian uranium ``extremely difficult, if not impossible.''
</P>
<P>
   Behind the problems are the woes of the nuclear industry. The
number of American reactors is declining, and the figure may drop
faster with utility deregulation. Worldwide, few reactors are being
built.
</P>
<P>
   The demand for uranium remains fairly constant. Companies do
not, for example, go out and build reactors because the price of
fuel has fallen, and most utilities use long-term supply contracts.
Market analysts say that means that the enrichment corporation's
decision to add uranium to the world supply would be certain to
depress prices.
</P>
<P>
   Another issue is how much the Enrichment Corp. will sell.
Administration officials argue that it will not flood the market.
The president and chief executive officer of the new company,
William H. Timbers Jr., wrote on July 21 that ``as a public company
with fiduciary obligations to its shareholders, USEC can ill afford
to unsettle this important market.''

ANALYSIS: CONGO REBELS HAVE BEEN THERE, DONE THAT 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Mass.)  (mk) 
 By HOWARD W. FRENCH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ABIDJAN, Ivory Coast _ When rebellious Congolese troops
announced their intention of overthrowing President Laurent Kabila
and seized two large cities in the eastern part of the country on
Monday, many people had the impression that they were reliving a
familiar drama.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, in almost every detail, this Central African nation is
witnessing a replay of the events two years ago that brought down
the dictator, Mobutu Sese Seko, and propelled Kabila to power.
</P>
<P>
   The same cities, Goma and Bukavu, are flashpoints; reports that
rebels are receiving reinforcement from across the Rwandan border
echo those of the last uprising, and, in turn, there are once again
accusations of a witch-hunt unleashed against Rwandans by the
government in Kinshasa. The immediate trigger for the conflict was
Kabila's expulsion last week of Rwandan military advisers from
Congo, but at that point Rwanda had already apparently concluded
that Kabila was unlikely to deliver what Rwanda wants most: Quiet
on their common border and protection for the Tutsi minority living
in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   The most striking difference between the 1996 uprising and the
present, perhaps, is that it took Kabila's rebel forces five months
to gather the impetus to seize Kisangani, the country's
third-largest city, thus becoming a real threat to the Mobutu
government's hold on power.
</P>
<P>
   This time around, Congo's rebels, many of whom are members of
the country's Tutsi minority and veterans of Kabila's own
insurrection, wasted no time in mounting a heavy attack against
Kisangani Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   And in an even bolder move that suggested careful planning well
in advance, the rebels flew a hijacked passenger jet across the
country to a military base in Kitona, in the far west, in an
attempt to rally former troops from Mobutu's army who were being
trained for the Congolese army by Rwandan instructors, Kabila's
Cabinet director, Abdoulaye Yerodia Ndombasi, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Those who backed the seven-month rebellion against Mobutu _
Rwanda, Uganda, the besieged Tutsi minorities of eastern Congo and
Kabila himself _ intended it to be a war to end all wars.
</P>
<P>
   At a minimum, Uganda and Rwanda intended to extend their
influence into Congo's vast eastern hinterlands to end the use of
the area as a staging ground for seemingly interminable rebellions
against their own governments.
</P>
<P>
   Congo's Tutsi minority, known collectively as the Banyamulenge,
expected an end to attacks against them by other eastern groups
that contested their right to land ownership or citizenship.
</P>
<P>
   And Kabila, emerging from almost three decades of life as an
ineffectual underground opponent of Mobutu, expected, in deposing
the old dictator, to usher in a new era in the nation's political
life as a reformer and national hero.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, none of these things have turned out as planned,
leaving nearly all the same embittered actors in a mood for
settling scores.
</P>
<P>
   ``What is so eerie about this is seeing the exact same
confluence of events in influences as in 1996,'' said Peter
Rosenblum, an expert in Congolese affairs who is projects director
at the Harvard University Human Rights Project. ``Again you have
the flare-ups with the Banyamulenge. Again there are disputes over
serious security issues in the far east. And again you have a clear
cross-border provocation with Rwanda denying that it is in any way
involved in the troubles.''
</P>
<P>
   If Kabila is overthrown, Congo will be seeking a new leader, one
who will be screened by Uganda and Rwanda. In recent weeks, there
have been unconfirmed but persistent reports of visits to the
Ugandan capital by leaders of shadowy armed anti-Kabila movements.
</P>
<P>
   If Kabila retains his hold on power, many foresee a period of
chaos, with opportunist commanders proclaiming control of whole
regions and ethnic groups seeking greater autonomy, or even
independence within a disintegrating whole.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Few experts on Congolese affairs give Kabila much chance in the
short term of restoring control over the eastern provinces against
a determined drive by Rwanda and Uganda. But generalized chaos in
the country could backfire even for any foreign sponsors of the
current violence, destabilizing the entire region.
</P>
<P>
   In 1996, the unstoppable seven-month cross-country march of
Kabila and his forces was applauded every step of the way by a
population desperate for a change from the deepening corruption and
poverty of the Mobutu years, but the rebel leader saw his honeymoon
end abruptly when he finally entered Kinshasa in May of 1997.
</P>
<P>
   Ordinary Congolese deplored the arbitrary style and high living
of the newcomers, whose energies were spent requisitioning the
largest villas and finest cars they could find. Most shocking,
though, was the discovery that instead of leading a true national
liberation force, Kabila had surrounded himself with and depended
almost entirely upon Rwandans and Congolese Tutsi soldiers and
advisers.
</P>
<P>
   Of markedly different appearance from typical western Congolese,
the Tutsi, who also speak a language little heard in Kinshasa,
suddenly filled the capital, where they quickly came to be seen as
an arrogant occupation force rather than liberators.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila, sensing that his own political fortunes lay in the
balance, eventually responded early this year by purging many Tutsi
elements from the senior army command and from his own political
movement, the Alliance of Democratic Forces for the Liberation of
Congo.
</P>
<P>
   That measure, combined with deep misgivings over Kabila's
inability to stop incursions into Rwanda and Uganda by rebels based
in eastern Congo, greatly increased the distrust already growing
between Kabila and his erstwhile sponsors in those countries.
</P>
<P>
   Beginning early this year, with Tutsi in Congo feeling
increasingly excluded from power in Kinshasa, Kabila began facing
one small revolt after another in the eastern part of the country.
What was missing until now was strong backing for the revolts from
a neighboring state.
</P>
<P>
   According to Western diplomats, international aid workers and
other experts in Congolese affairs, that outside push came last
week after Kabila, without warning, ordered the expulsion of
several hundred Rwandan military trainers remaining in the country.
</P>
<P>
   Publicly, Rwanda played down the spat, even insisting that the
sudden withdrawal of its advisers had been planned all along. What
this conciliatory stance sought to mask, however, according to
these experts, was Rwanda's almost immediate decision to strike
back against Kabila.
</P>
<P>
   ``There can be little doubt this time that Rwanda has been
ferrying arms and men across the border, supplying the rebels and
even backing them on the ground,'' said one European diplomat.
``The only question that remains is the one we were asking when
Kabila started out: Is this mainly a bid to overthrow the
government in Kinshasa, or is it also an attempt by the Rwandans to
establish a buffer zone in eastern Congo?''

A GEORGIA BARITONE CAPTURES THE BRITISH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9)

NYT photo clients. Non-subscribers can make individual purchase by

 By MATT WOLF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ In a New York theater climate that regularly welcomes
Britons, famous or otherwise _ whether Ralph Fiennes or Eddie
Izzard _ there is something particularly gratifying about an
American unknown causing a stir in London.
</P>
<P>
   And a Georgia-born baritone named Shuler Hensley most definitely
is doing just that as the menacing Jud Fry in the Royal National
Theater's current revival of ``Oklahoma!''
</P>
<P>
   How many Juds conjure up images of Benjamin Britten's Peter
Grimes, another thwarted romantic cast adrift from his community?
Hensley does, as he sweatily brings out the stash of pornography he
keeps hidden in the smokehouse, or ``lonely room,'' which he sings
of in the fierce and tearing number of the same name.
</P>
<P>
   Jud is the show's outsider, yes, but Hensley lifts him well
beyond the role of stock villain of the piece. It is easy to view
him as no less a fantasist than the romantic leads Curly and
Laurey. The difference: they get their wished-for surrey with the
fringe on top, whereas Jud ends up dead, doomed by a lethal anxiety
_ ``I can't help it; I can't never rest'' _ that has brought him no
peace.
</P>
<P>
   Hensley, said Charles Spencer in The Daily Telegraph, ``takes
the audience into a heart of lonely darkness,'' and added about the
entire cast, that he had never seen better acting in a musical.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't ever approach Jud as a bad character,'' Hensley, 30,
was saying one recent evening before a performance. He was in his
dressing room, which he calls ``my dormitory,'' a space barely big
enough to contain his expansive frame: he is 6 feet 3 inches tall
and weighs 255 pounds.
</P>
<P>
   ``I try to approach Jud as someone completely frustrated that
he's misunderstood,'' Hensley said. ``That no one gets him.''
</P>
<P>
   ``He wants things but just doesn't know how to express it. His
dreams are really those of everyone: he wants a woman who will take
care of him and love him and hold him.''
</P>
<P>
   Hensley brings to the character's yearnings a rich, deep singing
voice that is the result of his opera training at the Curtis
Institute of Music in Philadelphia. Roles there included Marcello
in ``La Boheme'' and Don Giovanni.
</P>
<P>
   That he can move on stage as well is due at least in part to a
dance background of sorts. His mother, Iris, has for 42 years run
the Georgia Ballet Ensemble in Marietta, the Atlanta suburb where
Hensley grew up, one of three children.
</P>
<P>
   Susan Stroman, the American choreographer of the revival
directed by Trevor Nunn, recalls being impressed by Hensley's
audition.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was there when Shuler walked into the room,'' she said. ``He
sang `Lonely Room' and we were frozen. His acting is so powerful.
He's very strong and, surprisingly, he's a good dancer, which I
can't actually use. For such a big, burly man to be able to leap
around and dance keeps the entire company intrigued.''
</P>
<P>
   As it happens, Hensley had played Jud Fry before, in a 1993
summer stock production at the North Shore Theater outside Boston.
``John Raitt came,'' Hensley said, smiling, ``and it was a big
thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Although he went on to play Andrew Lloyd Webber's Phantom 109
times in the German-language production in Hamburg, Hensley is well
aware that his current venture represents the big time, and that he
is unlikely to remain without an American agent much longer.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's all a matter of timing and a matter of patience,'' said
the performer, who does not yet know what he and his English wife,
Paula, a yoga instructor, will do when ``Oklahoma!'' ends its run
at the National's Olivier auditorium on Oct. 3.
</P>
<P>
   Whatever happens, he is heeding the advice of others that his
career prospects will improve with age.
</P>
<P>
   ``For years, I was told, `When you reach 40, you'll never stop
working,' and I was like, `OK, but I'm 25 now, so what do I do for
the next 15 years?' ''

AFTER 18 YEARS, DISNEY RE-RELEASES `THE BLACK CAULDRON'

<P>
   Believed by animation fans to be a ``lost film,'' Disney's 1985
feature ``The Black Cauldron'' is being released on video this
week. This is special for a number of reasons.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Eisner and company arrived at the studio as the
production was winding down. Many of Disney's animation veterans
retired, leaving much of the film in the hands of younger artists
(including Tim Burton and current Disney animation stars Andreas
Deja and Ruben Aquino). The new generation, eager to break the
Disney mold, made the studio's first and only PG-rated cartoon.
</P>
<P>
   Based on Lloyd Alexander's popular fantasy series ``The
Chronicles of Prydain,'' ``Cauldron'' centers on a young pig keeper
named Taran (the voice of Grant Beardsley) who dreams of being a
warrior. He's unaware of the precognitive powers of his porcine
pal, but they're well-known to The Horned King (John Hurt), who
wants to use them to find the infamous Black Cauldron. Why? To take
over the world, of course. This creepy cooking pot has the ability
to raise an army of the undead, which is exactly what the king has
in mind.
</P>
<P>
   But Taran doesn't give up easily. After encountering a cute fur
ball named Gurgi (John Byner, who sounds like he's talking through
a fan), Taran storms the king's castle and saves his pig, only to
be thrown in the dungeon himself. There he befriends a charming
princess (Susan Sheridan) and an imprisoned minstrel (Nigel
Hawthorne), and together they escape with the aid of a magic sword.
</P>
<P>
   Back in the forest, Taran and the gang are sent to the keepers
of the cauldron, a quartet of witches (including one voiced by
``H.R. Pufnstuf's'' Witchiepoo, Billie Hayes). Taran must give up
his sword in exchange for the cauldron, but you know the king's
gonna get his mitts on it before the heroes can deactivate its evil
powers. Confused yet?
</P>
<P>
   This often incomprehensible effort is as confounding to adults
as it will be to children. You'll find yourself far more attracted
to the cutesy Gurgi or the king's amusing sidekick Creeper than the
bland Taran or even the Horned King. And its 70mm format makes a
lot of the lavishly painted backgrounds look empty and static.
</P>
<P>
   Oh, and that PG rating mentioned earlier _ ``Cauldron'' earns
it. The skeletal, sharp-toothed king may not have much in the way
of character development, but he's creepy. The resurrection of his
army of skeleton warriors is more frightening than the similar
live-action version in 1993's ``Army of Darkness,'' and the king's
inevitable demise is enough to inspire nightmares.
</P>
<P>
   But for animation devotees and Disney completists, this film is
a certified must-have. Although live-action backgrounds come off as
cheap-looking in the film's earlier moments, the real smoke effects
from the cauldron work wonderfully. These effects were some of the
most stunning to come from the studio in years. It's reflected in
the film's $25 million price tag _ the most expensive ever at the
time. But ``The Black Cauldron'' was not a commercial success,
earning just $21 million at the box office.
</P>
<P>
   Because of ``Cauldron's'' poor performance, animation took a
back seat at Disney, with subsequent features like ``The Great
Mouse Detective'' and ``Oliver &AMP; Company'' given back-burner status
under the new regime. Still, ``Cauldron'' remains an important
precursor to Disney's animation revival, launched in 1989 with
``The Little Mermaid.''

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW AIYANSH, British Columbia _ Canada's federal government
signed a landmark treaty with west coast Indians on Tuesday, giving
a native group control for the first time of a majestic swath of
pine forest, crystal streams and towering, snowy peaks along with
the legal rights to run their own nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian government had hoped the treaty _ seen as a model
for dozens of other Indian land claims _ would foster the process
of reconciliation between indigenous people and other Canadians.
But its most immediate result so far has been division, suspicion
and great uncertainty throughout British Columbia and across
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Some Canadians argue that the treaty fundamentally alters the
constitution and endangers the country's delicate unity by allowing
the Indians a level of self-government that it has denied
French-speaking separatists in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   The rights granted under the treaty are comparable to those of
Indian tribes in the United States, which already have the power to
govern most of what happens on their reservations, although
conflicts occasionally arise there over the extent of Indian
jurisdiction and just who is covered by Indian laws.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty signed on Tuesday in Canada carries with it
tremendous potential for conflict because it was signed so much
later than the comparable treaties in the United States _ most of
which were completed more than a century ago. Some 50 other Indian
groups in British Columbia are pursuing similar claims for
territory covering practically every square mile of the huge
province, including cities like Vancouver. If the precedent set on
Tuesday is repeated, intense clashes over questions of rights are
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Canada's minister of Indian affairs and northern
development, Jane Stewart, arrived for the signing on Tuesday
morning in this remote corner of Canada, hard by Alaska, the
historic treaty with the Nisga'a (pronounced nis-GAH) people was
being attacked. Some residents of British Columbia fear the treaty
establishes a new level of government based on race, with its own
system of privileged justice and sanctioned inequality.
</P>
<P>
   Others criticized its price tag _ the equivalent of $320 million
in U.S. dollars spread out over several years _ as a giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial fishing industry and others condemned provisions
they feel give the Nisga'a unfair access to natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   But Indian claims were bolstered in December when Canada's
Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling involving the Gitxsan,
another British Columbia Indian group, that Indian claims extend to
the land's natural resources. The court also recognized Indian oral
history as having legal standing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, rival native groups within the province oppose the
treaty because it impinges on their own land claims. Even members
of one of the four bands that make up the Nisga'a nation has gone
to court to stop the treaty. Members like James H. Stevens say it
is poorly conceived and badly executed because it omits 90 percent
of the territory that the Nisga'a have traditionally claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was done by a bunch of young guys on the negotiation
committee who don't even know our resources or our culture,'' said
Stevens, a 72-year-old elder of the Kincolith band of the Nisga'a.
``Maybe they were just sitting there nodding their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the flood of criticism, federal negotiators and the
majority of Nisga'a leaders believe the treaty breaks new ground in
Canada's long and not always successful relationship with its
native people. ``It's time we did it,'' said Lorene Plante, a
Nisga'a woman who participated in the negotiations for the band's
first-ever treaty with the government.
</P>
<P>
   While also hopeful, Stephen Nyce was more guarded since he, like
many other Nisga'a, have not yet seen the details of the treaty.
``My grandfather told me not to celebrate until you know for sure
what you are celebrating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Molloy, the chief federal negotiator, said that, for the
first time, an Indian treaty will resolve a question of territory
while establishing the principles of self-government that can free
natives from dependency on the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we join Canada and British Columbia as free citizens,
full and equal participants in the social, economic and political
life of this country,'' said Joseph Gosnell Sr., president of the
Nisga'a Tribal Council. ``We intend to live here forever.''
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   While Indian self-government is a new concept in Canada, most of
the more than 500 Indian tribes and councils in the United States
already govern themselves to varying degrees, and with occasional
challenges from non-natives. Jerry J. Cordova, a negotiator with
the office of self governance in the Department of the Interior,
said that, in most cases, non-Indians are not allowed to run for
office or vote in tribal elections, but there are exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The American tribes consider themselves sovereign nations, a
view not always shared by individual states and the federal
government. The tribes often do not tax their own members or
non-natives. In some instances, their right to do so has been
challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of the American Indians suggests that a tribe's
ability to govern itself greatly increases the chances of it
reaching economic independence. ``Tribes that do have better
control over their assets _ whether cultural assets or trust funds
_ are more successful in economic development,'' said Lela M.
Shepard, development associate with the First Nations Development
Institute, a nonprofit group that provides financial assistance to
Indian tribes like the Pauma Tribe of Southern California, which
used a $300,000 grant to improve its orange and avocado orchards.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shepard said that the biggest problem for most tribes is
raising the money to begin projects, since many banks are reluctant
to lend them money.
</P>
<P>
   The Nisga'a treaty that was signed on Tuesday will allow the
indigenous people here to run most of the social and economic
activity in the vast area they will control _ roughly four-fifths
the size of Rhode Island. They will set and collect taxes and
determine how the revenue is spent, while agreeing to eventually
give up the exemption from some sales and income taxes they have
had.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stewart, the Indian affairs minister, praised the treaty,
calling it ``a just and honorable settlement,'' that reinforces the
supreme court of Canada's directive that negotiation, not
litigation, is the way to settle native land claims.
</P>
<P>
   Following Tuesday's signing, the treaty proposal will be put to
a referendum among the registered members of the Nisga'a. There are
about 5,500 Nisga'a, but fewer than 2,000 live in the area that is
considered their ancestral home.
</P>
<P>
   Some British Columbia residents want a province-wide referendum
on the treaty because they say that by preventing non-Indians from
running for government offices or voting in such elections, the
treaty fundamentally changes Canada's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Indian leaders have rejected the idea of a provincial
referendum, calling it ``the white man's veto.'' Clark said the
250-page treaty is too complicated to be put to such a broad test.
The people of British Columbia will be able to participate, Clark
said, when the treaty goes before the provincial legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Following that, it will also be voted on by the Parliament in
Ottawa. Negotiators believe that the whole process could be
completed by next spring, although substantial objections could
delay it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unlike the eastern provinces that signed land treaties with
Indian groups hundreds of years ago, British Columbia entered into
only a few such deals on Vancouver Island and in the northeastern
part of the province before abandoning the process. Small,
scattered reserves were created but the natives themselves never
surrendered claim to traditional lands.
</P>
<P>
   By all measures, Canada's more than 800,000 indigenous people
are the poorest, least educated and least healthy Canadians, which
deeply embarrasses many Canadians. The federal government has been
looking for a way to change the situation by embracing the idea of
self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials hope that by giving native groups clear
title they not only can compensate for past injustices but also
encourage forestry, mining and other activities to sustain
independence. Uncertainty over who controls the land has hampered
such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's treaty is considered full and final, and can only be
amended with the consent of the natives, the province and the
federal government. ``It's a done deal,'' said Jack Ebbels, the
chief negotiator for British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not like past deals in which Indian bands were
bullied into giving away most of their land.
</P>
<P>
   The Nisga'a will become major land holders in British Columbia,
owning the land outright, just like other property holders. They
will own the rights to all the timber, except for existing leases,
and subsurface minerals, and will be able to negotiate future
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Local government will be in the hands of the Nisga'a, who will
have the power to make laws concerning language and culture,
property, employment, traffic and most social services. The 100 or
so non-Indians living on Nisga'a land will not be allowed to run
for office or vote, although they will have the chance to do so in
elections involving education and health boards that directly
affect them.
</P>
<P>
   These restrictions have already stirred a huge controversy that
threatens to derail the ratification of the treaty. Despite the
small number of non-Indians on Nisga'a land, critics are worried
about the precedent of establishing governments on racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time I know of, they are entrenching inequality
in the constitution of Canada,'' said Gordon Campbell, leader of
the Liberal opposition in British Columbia. Campbell said that this
also endangers Canada's delicate national unity. ``We are giving to
the Nisga'a government something that the Quebec government asked
for a long time ago and were told: `No, you can't have it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Stewart, the Indian minister, said the constitution
actually guarantees natives special rights simply because they were
in Canada before Europeans arrived. She said the federal government
fully supports the restrictions that the treaty places on
participation in native government.
</P>
<P>
   But that has proved to be a far more uncomfortable position for
the province. ``It was a thorny, thorny issue,'' said Ebbels, the
provincial negotiator. He suggested that the province had been
worried about non-natives being taxed by the Nisga'a without any
representation in the local government. In the end, Indian taxing
powers were restricted to natives, while non-natives will continue
paying taxes to the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took some comfort in that,'' Ebbels said.

`HALLOWEEN' SEQUEL IS NOTHING TO SCREAM ABOUT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By ROBERT PHILPOT 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Reportedly, Jamie Lee Curtis once said she'd only star in
another ``Halloween'' movie if it had the right script. Not having
had a hit since 1994's ``True Lies,'' Curtis apparently has decided
to compromise. Don't count on ``Halloween H20'' breaking her losing
streak.
</P>
<P>
   ``H20's'' script isn't so much bad as it is dull, a cardinal sin
when it comes to this type of stuff. Think of it as ``The Slasher
Movie That Cried Wolf.'' It's so intent on false alarms that it
begins to look like a practical joke on genre fans, a horror movie
with no real horror. Once the bodies do start falling, you're too
bored to care.
</P>
<P>
   Curtis wastes no time getting back into the thick of things.
Even before she's on camera, she's screaming that scream that made
her famous. It's 20 years later (H-2-0, get it?), and Curtis'
Laurie Strode character is living under an assumed name in one of
those anonymous California small towns, where she's the alcoholic,
pill-popping headmistress of a prestigious private school. Just
what you want when you've faked your death, a high-profile
position.
</P>
<P>
   She's also a single mother, with a son named John (newcomer Josh
Hartnett _ first tip, Josh: fire your hairstylist). John is 17, the
very age Laurie was in the first film. Understandably, she's
overprotective and reluctant to let John join his classmates on a
camping trip. Maybe she's afraid that Jason Voorhees will walk over
from the set of a ``Friday the 13th'' sequel.
</P>
<P>
   Laurie still sees her brother Michael Meyers (remember, Laurie
was adopted), the ``Halloween'' series' demented killer, everywhere
she goes _ she's literally afraid of her shadow. We know, of
course, that he's really on the loose, and he's coming to get her _
and John. But Michael's older now, of course, and he moves a little
slowly, kind of like this movie.
</P>
<P>
   By now, we know all of ``Halloween's'' tricks. The ``Scream''
movies ratcheted (or hatcheted) up the slasher genre with their wit
and pop-culture savvy; the closest this movie can come to them is
showing a ``Scream 2'' video on a TV screen. (''Scream''
screenwriter Kevin Williamson reportedly did a script-polish; maybe
the video was his contribution.)
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween H20'' also follows the ``Scream'' series' lead by
casting TV-ready names _ ``3rd Rock From the Sun's'' Joseph
Gordon-Levitt, ``Chicago Hope's'' Adam Arkin, ``In the House''
actor/rapper LL Cool J. The ``Scream'' movies made their casts part
of the joke, but ``H20'' fails to take advantage of its familiar
faces. It does manage a funny bit with Curtis' real-life mom, Janet
Leigh, but because her presence is revealed in the opening credits,
we're robbed of the fun of a surprise cameo.
</P>
<P>
   Although he's no stranger to the genre, director Steve Miner
seems out of his element here. Miner directed the second and third
installments of ``Friday the 13th,'' a series that ripped off the
original ``Halloween's'' basic plot without appropriating any of
its style. He appears to be half apologizing, half paying tribute,
following the structure of the original ``Halloween'' by saving
much of the gore for last. When John Carpenter did this in 1978, it
caught us off guard; after 20 years of clones, sequels and satires,
we need something more, and ``H20'' doesn't offer it.
</P>
<P>
   ``H20'' does serve one purpose: It does its darnedest to close
the door on the series, so that we won't endure any more sequels.
Of course, in the world of slasher movies, the killer is never
truly dead. Maybe one of these days, we'll find out that Michael
Meyers is really Mike Myers, the inspired comedian of ``Austin
Powers'' fame. Imagine, just before someone puts an end to his
latest spree, Myers will rip off his Halloween mask and yell, ``I'm
not a monster _ I'm a MAN, bay-bee!''
</P>
<P>
   ``Halloween H20'' is rated R for violence, strong language and
sexual situations. As if you had to ask.

 By GRETCHEN MORGENSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After months of shrugging off bad economic news from
Asia and a slowdown in U.S. corporate profit growth, investors
stampeded out of stocks Tuesday. The Dow Jones industrial average
plunged almost 300 points, losing 3.41 percent of its value in the
third largest point decline in history.
</P>
<P>
   Though a bruising reminder that the stock market giveth and the
stock market taketh away, the drop in percentage terms didn't even
make the market's top twenty. And because of the forceful bull move
in stocks this year, many investors, even after Tuesday's decline,
still have considerable profits year-to-date. The Dow Jones
industrial average, for example, is up 7.32 percent since January.
</P>
<P>
   There was no single reason identified as the culprit behind the
market's plunge. Rather, investors seemed suddenly to give credence
to a series of red flags that had been waving for some time. For
example, the economic meltdown in Asia has translated to a sizable
drop in demand for U.S. products. Economic growth in the United
States slowed to a 1.4 percent gain in the second quarter, down
from the 5.5 percent reported in the first quarter. The strong
dollar has wreaked havoc on companies doing business overseas.
Uncertainty over President Clinton's future in the face of the
Lewinsky matter weighed on the market as well.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most significant was investors' sudden recognition
that earnings growth, the engine that powers stock prices, is
deteriorating at even the biggest and best-known American
companies. Combine this with an increasingly narrow stock market
advance _ more stocks going down than up _ and you have a recipe
for lower stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are finally, finally starting to realize that
earnings growth has slowed,'' said Liz Miller, portfolio manager at
Trevor, Stewart, Burton &AMP; Jacobsen in New York. ``If you have a
weakening underlying economy, profits cannot keep going up.''
</P>
<P>
   In recent days, managements at such stock-market stars as
Procter &AMP; Gamble and Kellogg Co., have disappointed investors with
either lower-than-expected earnings or warnings of bad news to
come. When the same blue chip companies that have led the market to
unprecendented valuations begin to lose steam, investors sooner or
later take notice.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sense of panic reported among brokerage firms
Tuesday. Several brokers said that the feeling among their clients
was one of being resigned to a drop in stock prices. Nice though
the heady profits were, investors seemed to think that the stock
market was overdue for a downfall.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did mutual fund investors appear to be crowding the
exits. Fidelity, the mutual fund giant, reported that fund flows
were positive across the company. ``There was some small movement
from equities to money market funds,'' said Anne Crowley, a
Fidelity spokeswoman, ``but nothing of consequence.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The question on everyone's minds Tuesday was where the market's
fall would end? Was this the beginning of an stock market
bloodletting or just a painful correction?
</P>
<P>
   By Wall Street's definition, a market correction takes place
when stocks decline between 10 percent and 15 percent. A bear
market is considered to have started once stock prices have fallen
by more than 20 percent from their peaks.
</P>
<P>
   Using these benchmarks, most investors are close to, but not yet
in, correction territory. Since the Dow Jones industrial average
peaked at 9337.97 on July 17, it has lost 9.1 percent of its value.
The broader market average, the Standard &AMP; Poor's 500, lost 3.62
percent of its value Tuesday, falling more than 40 points. That
index is down 9.6 percent from its July high of 1186.75.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq Composite, with its heavy weighting in technology and
financial stocks, is the only major index that can be said to be in
a correction. It has lost 11.3 percent of its value from its July
peak of 2014.25. Nasdaq lost more than 65 points Tuesday, or 3.54
percent of its value. Even so, the index is up almost 14 percent
year-to-date.
</P>
<P>
   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange topped 800 million shares,
the largest day of trading this year and the second biggest ever.
Investors fleeing stocks sought refuge in Treasuries, driving up
the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond to yield 5.62
percent. But this flight to quality was somewhat muted: bonds
traded higher, at yield of 5.56, approximately one month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell, of course, if the market will move into
bear market territory or contain its drop to a mere downdraft. In
recent years, investors have ploughed back into stocks whenever
they have declined, a phenomenon known as ``buying the dips.''
Whether or not these investors will once again consider Tuesday's
precipitous drop in equity prices a buying opportunity remains to
be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks began to slide in earnest around noon Tuesday when Ralph
Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential Securities
and a long-time bull on stocks, was quoted as saying that the Dow
Jones average could drop 15 percent to 20 percent from its 1998
highs.
</P>
<P>
   But warning signs that stock prices might have gotten ahead of
themselves had been evident for weeks, if not months. Last week,
investors were happy to pay 27 times trailing earnings for the S&AMP;P
500. When it began to sink in among investors that corporate
earnings this year may not be able to exceed 6 percent, paying more
than four times the average earnings growth rate for the S&AMP;P 500
looked more and more dicey. Given that labor costs are rising at
the same time that intense competition among companies prevents
them from raising their prices to consumers, corporate profit
margins look particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Another straw in the wind pointing to lower stock prices: growth
in money supply, the total stock of money in the economy nationwide
regulated by the Federal Reserve Board, peaked in April. For the
past eighteen months, the broadest category of money supply, known
as M3, had been going straight up; a 25-year peak of 8.9 percent
growth came last April. Allowing money supply to grow stimulates
the economy and in turn the stock market. A slowdown in money
supply growth, if its turns out to be a long-term trend, would have
the opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp-eyed investors may have noticed another sign that stock
prices had hit something of a ceiling. Premiums paid in corporate
takeovers had disappeared in recent months. Last week's acquisition
of GTE Corp. by Bell Atlantic at a below-market price was more
takeunder than takeover.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, positive earnings surprises in the second quarter were
no longer producing outsized gains in the stocks of companies
reporting them. Companies with good news saw their stock prices
underperform the S&AMP;P 500. This was an aboutface from the same
period in 1997 when companies posting unexpected earnings gains 10
percent or more above the Wall Street consensus outperformed the
S&AMP;P 500 by 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Painful though any fall in stock prices can be, some money
managers who had been quietly raising cash and taking stock market
profits were unsurprised by the move. To their view, such a drop
was not a matter of if, but when. And if it ratchets down the
exceedingly great expectations investors have come to look for in
stock market returns, these folks say, the market's fall will be
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were seeing valuations that were absurd relative to
corporate earnings,'' said Elaine Hahn, of Hahn Capital Management
in San Francisco. ``But nobody wanted to listen.''

BURTON SCHEDULES CONTEMPT VOTE AGAINST RENO 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By BENNETT ROTH 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ A showdown between House Republicans and Attorney
General Janet Reno drew closer Tuesday when the chairman of a
committee investigating campaign finance abuses announced he would
seek a contempt vote for her refusal to turn over certain documents
to Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Dan Burton, R-Ind., has demanded that Reno turn over
confidential memos from FBI director Louis Freeh and the head of
Justice Department campaign finance task force, Charles LaBella,
advising her to appoint an independent counsel to look into abuses
stemming from the 1996 presidential election.
</P>
<P>
   As chairman of the House Government Reform and Oversight
Committee, Burton has scheduled a vote of the panel Thursday to
cite Reno for her unwillingness to turn over the memos.
</P>
<P>
   At a committee hearing where both LaBella and Freeh testified,
Burton said that Congress has a right to the documents, whose
conclusions have already been leaked to the press.
</P>
<P>
   He further criticized Reno for not heeding the advice of her
subordinates to appoint an independent counsel, saying, ``It looks
to me like the attorney general is trying to protect the
president.''
</P>
<P>
   But Reno called a press conference to defend her actions, saying
that releasing the memos could jeopardize the Justice Department's
probe into campaign finance abuses.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have an obligation to protect the confidentiality of the
ongoing investigation,'' Reno said. ``Congress has historically
respected this position.''
</P>
<P>
   Reno also contended Burton was playing politics by threatening
her with contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``Politics does not belong in prosecutions,'' Reno said.
</P>
<P>
   A contempt vote by the committee would be a highly unusual step
and could re-ignite the campaign finance controversy that has been
overshadowed recently by independent counsel Kenneth Starr's probe
of the president's alleged affair with Monica Lewinsky.
</P>
<P>
   It is unlikely, however, that the full House would act on the
contempt charges until after members return from their summer
recess in September.
</P>
<P>
   Last year House and Senate committees spent months looking into
allegations that foreigners, particularly Chinese and Indonesians,
pumped hundreds of thousands of dollars into the Democratic
National Committee party coffers during the 1996 election. Although
the Justice Department has indicted 12 people linked to illegal
campaign finance practices, no solid evidence has yet surfaced to
back GOP allegations that the Chinese government influenced the
election.
</P>
<P>
   Last year Reno refused to appoint an independent counsel to look
into activities of Clinton and Vice President Al Gore, who had been
accused of illegally making fund-raising calls on government
property.
</P>
<P>
   But Reno said she will review the question of whether to appoint
a special prosecutor after she studies the LaBella memo, which was
handed to her last month. Although he refused to discuss the
details, LaBella confirmed that he had recommended an independent
counsel be appointed.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh reached the same conclusion last fall, when he wrote a
similar memo to Reno.
</P>
<P>
   The FBI director told the committee that there is enough
suspicion that the campaign finance abuses could be linked to key
executive branch officials, including the president and the vice
president, to legally trigger the appointment of an independent
counsel.
</P>
<P>
   Reno said that after she reviews the LaBella memo, she would
confer with the relevant committees and promised to summarize its
findings to them.
</P>
<P>
   That response has placated a number of powerful Republicans,
including Senate Judiciary Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and House
Judiciary Chairman Henry Hyde, R-Ill.
</P>
<P>
   But it has not been enough for Burton, the combative
conservative who has presided over contentious committee hearings
rife with partisan bickering. Earlier this year, Democrats on the
committee accused Burton of selectively releasing prison phone
tapes of Clinton friend Webster Hubbell, an incident that resulted
in the firing of a top committee aide, David Bosse.
</P>
<P>
   If the panel votes to hold Reno in contempt, the decision will
have to be backed by vote of the full House. The case would then be
turned over to Justice Department for prosecution, though such
cases are extremely rare.
</P>
<P>
   Rep. Henry Waxman, D-Calif. ranking Democrat on Burton's
committee, charged Tuesday that Burton was trying to ``strong-arm''
Reno into appointing an independent counsel by threatening her with
contempt.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is just the kind of behavior and abuse of power that
should not be permitted,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   LaBella and Freeh told the committee that it would be harmful to
their probe to turn over the documents because they contain
information that could be used by criminal targets to escape
prosecution.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would be devastating. I just couldn't imagine trying to
investigate the case effectively,'' said LaBella.
</P>
<P>
   Freeh said a contempt citation would send a ``chilling message
to prosecutors and special agents across the country.''
</P>
<P>
   The FBI director said that law enforcement officials would be
reluctant to put any of their findings in writing if they believed
the material would be subpoenaed by Congress.
</P>
<P>
   Burton said that the Justice Department could blot out any
material relating to the grand jury investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Freeh said that even without the grand jury information, the
memos provided a general road map about where the investigation was
heading.

ANALYSIS: TRADING WON'T BE HALTED UNLESS DROP IS HUGE 
</HEADLINE>
  (With MARKET-NYT) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What will happen when trading starts Wednesday if
investors return for a second act much like Tuesday's huge
selloff? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer: trading will not be halted, as it was last Oct. 27,
and the financial exchanges will do little to intervene in the
buying and selling of shares unless the selling reaches epic
proportions for a single session, with a drop of greater than 10
percent in the Dow Jones industrial average, something that has
occurred just twice: in October 1929 and October 1987. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's because regulators and the operators of the nation's
financial exchanges have decided that trading should be disrupted
only when the market suffers an extraordinarily large decline. That
view suggests that an earlier rule, adopted after the 1987 stock
market crash but revised earlier this year, was too restrictive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a huge decline, however, the suspension or halt
in trading is supposed to give investors a respite from panic
driven selling. So the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and
other American exchanges will remain open Wednesday unless a huge
selloff drops the Dow _ the most widely followed market barometer _
by about 10, 20 or 30 percent. Such a decline, if it were to come,
would erase more than a year's worth of gains in a single day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sharp selloffs of one, two or even nine percentage points over
consecutive days don't count. It's just the one big swoop that
regulators fear could be unnerving and possibly calamitous. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange, which suspended and then halted
trading last Oct. 27 after the Dow fell 350 points and then more
than 550 points, has with regulatory approval this year instituted
new, less restrictive rules that now call for a one hour trading
suspension if the Dow falls 900 points before 2 p.m. Steeper falls
at varying times of the day would result in an array of trading
suspensions. But a drop of 2,650 points would end trading for the
day. Each quarter, the Big Board recalibrates those point figures
to approximate a 10, 20 or 30 percent drop in the Dow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those are the rules, and the New York Stock Exchange says it
doesn't speculate about whether they'll be triggered or not. ``We
don't comment on the ups and downs in the market,'' said Richard
Adamonis, a spokesman for the Big Board. As for the circuit
breakers, Tuesday's drop of 299.43 points was not even ``in the
woods'' as far as triggering a trading halt, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, a 350-point drop would have been sufficient for a
trading halt; now, only market mayhem would do so. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The original circuit breaker rules went into effect a year after
the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow plunged 508
points, or 22.3 percent. But until recently, the Big Board had
clung to point scales, which meant less and less in percentage
terms as the Dow climbed from its low of 1,738.41 after the 1987
crash to a record 9,337.97 set July 17. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Dow fell 554 points last Oct. 27, it amounted to a
decline of about 7.2 percent. With the Dow now at 8,487.31, the
900-point trigger would push it as low as 7,587.31, a 10.6 percent
drop and a level not seen since January. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One worrisome sign, though, is that volume on the Big Board and
the Nasdaq has been extraordinarily high, particularly for the
summer months. More than 834 million shares traded hands Tuesday on
the Big Board, the most since a record 1.2 billion shares traded on
Oct. 28, as the market soared after the big 554-point plunge. On
the Nasdaq, volume Tuesday was 913 million shares, the tenth
largest daily volume figure in the market's history. The average
daily volume has been climbing for several weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy and bearish trading activity has caused most of the major
stock indexes to drop nearly 10 percent from their all-time highs,
some set just weeks ago. And Tuesday's decline for the Dow and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was the third consecutive day
prices on those indexes fell more than a percent, a rare occurrence
for a major market barometer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board does have trading restrictions on arbitrageurs,
which go into effect after the Dow rises or falls more than 50
points in a day, but those restrictions are put in place almost
daily, and have not prevented huge swings in prices this year,
making it one of the most volatile periods in years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund companies, though, seemed less concerned about
circuit breakers, which now seem even less of a factor, and more
about being prepared for a flood of telephone calls from jittery
investors.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not so much concerned about the circuit breakers as we
are the call volume,'' said Brian Mattes, a spokesman for the
Vanguard Group. ``There's no call out to our Swiss army,'' he said
of the extras who would help man the phone in an emergency, ``but
we'll see how things go and if we need them, we'll call them out.''

AMAZON.COM MOVES TO LIFT INTERNET PRESENCE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ In a move indicating that its aspirations extend to
selling far more than books over the Internet, Amazon.com said
Tuesday it had bought Junglee Corp., which operates a service that
lets people shop for everything from clothing to computers.
</P>
<P>
   Separately, Amazon.com also bought Planet All, which operates a
vast Internet address service that allows people to stay in touch
with their friends and associates. Amazon.com hopes to sell books
and its expanding variety of goods to Planet All's 1.5 million
members.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com will exchange stock worth $187 million _ at Monday's
closing price _ for Junglee and stock worth $93 million for Planet
All. Both companies are privately held.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com has grown to be the most successful merchant on the
Internet, with 3.1 million customers. It posted sales of $203
million in the first half, a nearly fivefold increase from the
comparable period a year earlier. Its losses, totaling $30 million
in the first half, have also accelerated, but not quite as fast.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the company's stock has surged, bringing the paper wealth
of Jeff Bezos, the former stock trader who founded the company, to
more than $2.5 billion.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Amazon.com's only expansion beyond books has been to add
music compact disks earlier this year. But Bezos said in an
interview Tuesday, ``We're at an inflection point where we are now
looking at a broader range of products.''
</P>
<P>
   In contrast to its handling of books and music, Amazon.com does
not necessarily plan to sell other products directly, Bezos said.
Rather, it will help customers find merchandise from other Internet
stores.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our focus has always been to help people find and discover
things they want to buy,'' Bezos said. ``We're not limited to
selling our own stuff.''
</P>
<P>
   While Bezos declined to discuss how the company expected to earn
money from this plan, analysts said the most likely way was to earn
a commission from stores to which it refers customers.
</P>
<P>
   That is one of the main business lines of Junglee, which makes
software to pull together disparate information from all over the
Internet for comparison. Junglee operates comparison shopping
services, offered on various Internet sites including Yahoo, that
let users see the prices and terms for all sorts of products. What
is not disclosed on these sites is that some companies that Junglee
lists in these comparisons pay Junglee for referrals.
</P>
<P>
   Junglee's site on Yahoo shows that Amazon.com does not offer the
lowest prices for many books. Bezos said that under Amazon.com's
wing, Junglee would cut back on this sort of price comparison.
</P>
<P>
   ``We don't think that customers find price comparisons very
useful,'' he said. ``We would rather help people discover exactly
what they're looking for online.''
</P>
<P>
   Bezos declined to say when Amazon.com would start offering new
services through Junglee, but he said that the company's expansion
would be relatively slow.
</P>
<P>
   In contrast, Amazon.com has already started exploiting the sales
opportunities on Planet All through e-mail messages that encourage
members to buy birthday gifts for their friends from Amazon.com.
</P>
<P>
   Planet All users enter their name, phone numbers, address,
birthday and other information into the system, and they specify
which other members can see that information. That way when they
move, for example, all of their contacts are notified of the
change. The company, founded by Warren Adams, a former banking
consultant, has added a range of features such as the ability to
network by searching lists of the friends of your friends.
</P>
<P>
   So far the company has not taken in much money, Adams said. But
it had hoped to sell advertising on its site and by linking up with
corporations that wanted to offer its service as a benefit for
their customers.
</P>
<P>
   Adams said that Amazon.com had hoped to make the Planet All
address directory available on its site so that people would be
able to look up easily where to send gifts. Originally, Planet All
planned to offer such capability to many on line stores. But Bezos
said that dealings with Amazon.com's competitors would be reduced,
but not eliminated.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wouldn't let Barnes &AMP; Noble advertise on the Planet All
site,'' he said.

TUBING BUSINESS COOLED CONSIDERABLY BY THE HEAT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By BILL HANNA 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   GLEN ROSE, Texas _ It's unusual for a business owner to advise
customers against sampling his product, but that's what Jack Cathey
has been doing.
</P>
<P>
   With Texas' Brazos River running at a trickle, Cathey has
discouraged customers who call his Low Water Bridge Canoe Rentals
office from making the drive.
</P>
<P>
   ``The water is low, the water is hot, it's just not an enjoyable
trip,'' Cathey said. ``Right now, we're discouraging groups from
coming. I don't want them to have a bad time, go back and tell
others. I would rather they come when the river's up and tell their
friends what a great time they had.''
</P>
<P>
   Since the rains stopped and triple-digit temperatures settled in
over North Texas, the amount of water released down the Brazos from
Lake Granbury and Possum Kingdom Lake has steadily declined. For
Glen Rose canoe and tube business, at a popular destination for
North Texas water lovers, the drought has killed the summer rush.
</P>
<P>
   One weekend last month, Cathey said, he rented a few tubes for
children to play in the water, but business is dramatically less
than on normal summer weekends, when he often rents out more than
200 tubes and 54 canoes.
</P>
<P>
   ``My business has doubled every year,'' said Cathey, who
attracts most of his customers from Arlington and Fort Worth.
``We're really becoming an alternative to the Guadalupe. This river
is closer to the Metroplex, and our ride is a real slow, laid-back
ride. We can put people in canoes that have never been in them
before and not worry about them.''
</P>
<P>
   In Central Texas, the New Braunfels area still has tubing
available on the Guadalupe, but flows are slower than normal.
Still, river outfitters expect business to continue throughout the
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Canoe rentals are still possible on the Brazos River near Palo
Pinto if they are timed with releases from the Possum Kingdom Lake
dam, said Buddy Rochelle, owner of Rochelle's Canoe Rentals.
</P>
<P>
   ``When they're generating power out of the dam, the water's cool
enough it can take your breath away,'' Rochelle said. But business
has declined about 75 percent because of the heat and low water.
</P>
<P>
   Elsewhere in Glen Rose, business is down for other water-related
businesses that rely on the Brazos.
</P>
<P>
   At Tres Rios campground, tube rentals have slowed to a crawl,
said Tina Wood, the company's marketing director. But because of
steady camper traffic, business has not been seriously damaged.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've still got customers staying on the grounds who are just
getting away or visiting people in Fort Worth,'' Wood said.
</P>
<P>
   The low water has made dinosaur tracks in the Paluxy River at
Dinosaur Valley State Park a little easier to see, said Carolyn
Eddy, the park's office manager. But swimming holes are shallower
and the water warmer.
</P>
<P>
   Cathey says he assumes that his business is over for the season
unless torrential rains arrive in late summer or early fall. He is
working a second job at a local golf course to help pay his bills.
</P>
<P>
   But he said the tubing business beats the pitfalls of his former
profession: raising cattle.
</P>
<P>
   ``It used to be with cattle, I had to go out and feed them in a
drought,'' Cathey said. ``At least with these tubes I don't have to
do that. I can just put them out back somewhere and not have to
worry about them. They aren't eating me out of house and home.''

COWBOYS WHO SING AND ANIMALS WHO TALK  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9.) 
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: Please note subslug for OKLAHOMA-MUSICAL)

 Benedict Nightingale is the chief drama critic of The Times of
London.  
 By BENEDICT NIGHTINGALE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   LONDON _ Any theater historian will tell you that ``Oklahoma!''
was crucial to the evolution of the Broadway musical and, doing so,
leave you wondering if you honestly wish to see it revived.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, the show rejects the customary invasion of spangled hoofers
for a quiet opening in which a cowboy sings a simple ode about the
joys of 6 a.m. to a middle-aged woman churning butter.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, it tells an unsplashy story about love in the West, using a
near-seamless blend of dialogue, song and even ballet to push
forward the narrative.
</P>
<P>
   Yes, back in 1943 the professional pundits thought the show too
unsophisticated to run more than a few weeks in New York or London
and were astonished when it became the decade's biggest hit in both
cities. Doesn't all that sound a bit academic in 1998?
</P>
<P>
   Certainly it does. And as if that weren't bad enough, some
British skeptics have suggested that Trevor Nunn, the Royal
National Theater's director, is staging Rodgers and Hammerstein's
musical in the Olivier auditorium this summer to cadge money from
tourists in search of quaint fun. But nothing could be further from
the case.
</P>
<P>
   As soon as mellow light rises on a snippet of timber farmhouse
backed by a vast arc of brown-green prairie, and Hugh Jackman's
genial Curly begins to sing ``Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin' '' to
Maureen Lipman's pensive Aunt Eller, you feel much the same sense
of peace and truthfulness that refreshed the Broadway crowd in the
war-riven world of 1943.
</P>
<P>
   But that instantly raises another doubt. Maybe the success the
show is now scoring with London critics and audiences is to be
explained by nostalgia for some turn-of-the-century Eden posing as
the Oklahoma Territory. After all, this is a world of box suppers
and schoolhouse-raising parties in which the principal issue is
whether pretty Laurey will confess her affection for Curly or allow
her hired man, Jud Fry, to continue squiring her.
</P>
<P>
   Well, all right, maybe there's a part of you, or at least of me,
that wouldn't mind being time-warped out of our world of traffic
jams, rave music and cognoscenti earnestly discussing
post-structuralism. But that doesn't prevent Nunn and an
accomplished cast from finding darkness and depth beneath the
sweet-seeming surfaces of ``Oklahoma!''
</P>
<P>
   When I last saw the musical, in a London revival of 1980, it
struck me as cruelly sentimental. We seemed expected to admire all
two dimensions of Curly and Laurey, while demonizing Jud, whose
main fault was to sit, ``crawlin' and festerin,''' in his room
instead of riding broncos and chanting trite tributes to the dawn.
</P>
<P>
   Who could blame him for collecting ``dirty'' pictures when the
local lasses looked as if they had scrubbed their faces as well as
their incisors with toothpaste? Yet when he makes the jump from
fantasy to reality, and admits his interest in Laurey, his reward
is to be snubbed, insulted and, in the most bizarrely manipulative
song ever written, told by Curly that he will get an awfully nice
funeral if he commits suicide.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, Jud runs a bit wild after his rejection by Laurey;
but I still wondered if Rodgers and Hammerstein hadn't got their
heroes and their happy endings wrong.
</P>
<P>
   Not in Nunn's superlative production. Shuler Hensley's Jud isn't
the misunderstood Heathcliff I vaguely recall from 1980, but a
weird blend of badger, mole, Norman Bates and the Caliban whom
Prospero found trying to rape his daughter. If his forlorn,
grizzled face and hapless, shambling walk excite just a little
pity, this fine actor always suggests there is something warped and
disturbing inside that grimy old vest.
</P>
<P>
   In this pioneering society he is the pioneer stalker: a serious
menace to two individuals who aren't sanitized, aren't smug, aren't
anything but two attractive yet callow young people precariously
discovering love.
</P>
<P>
   Considering that Oklahoma is a place where the men as well as
the corn are supposed to stand as tall as an elephant's eye,
Jackman's Curly and Josefina Gabrielle's Laurey are an oddly
dreamy, introverted pair. Both suffer from the most humanizing of
romantic afflictions, insecurity. He barely dares believe they will
ride together in any surrey, let alone one with a fringe on top,
and she isn't sure she wants to do so.
</P>
<P>
   Jackman, a major discovery, is particularly effective when it
comes to expressing suppressed yearning, but Ms. Gabrielle is
almost as good when she joins him in ``People Will Say We're in
Love.'' Whoever claimed that Stephen Sondheim introduced emotional
ambivalence to the musical theater? Here are two tentative souls
acknowledging the strength of their bond by their very refusal to
do so.
</P>
<P>
   The same insecurity extends into the public sphere and gives the
evening its unity. As Anthony Ward has designed the buildings,
they, too, have a precarious look. The school is still a skeleton;
the carpenters haven't finished the train station's roof; houses
are overgrown wood shacks marooned in an emptiness that stretches
to the sky. And though the Oklahoma Territory is on the brink of
joining the Union, the state-to-be remains unclear about its
identity.
</P>
<P>
   As the song says, ``the farmer and the cowman should be
friends,'' but there is no consensus about how much the land should
be used for grazing and how much for digging: which is why a jolly
barn dance quickly degenerates into a punch-up that here goes
beyond the balletic.
</P>
<P>
   When the cast pitches into the title song, it is expressing an
exuberant hope rather than celebrating an accomplished fact.
Oklahoma is neither yet Oklahoma nor yet O.K.
</P>
<P>
   But all this is suggested with a light, airy touch on a stage
that, aptly enough, is itself filled with air and shifting light.
Nunn's large-scale credits may include ``Les Miserables,'' which is
probably the most morally earnest West End musical ever staged: he
doesn't forget he is directing a show packed with beloved numbers
and ingenuous fun.
</P>
<P>
   The subplot _ will the flibbertigibbet Ado Annie run off with
the peddler Ali Hakim or accept the solider, stolider Will Parker?
_ comes off especially enjoyably. One of the production's great
strengths is that the singers are capable not merely of acting, but
of thinking, feeling, living their way through Hammerstein's lyrics
as well. And that freshness extends from Jackman's Curly to Vicki
Simon's Annie, who finds plenty of comically exasperated
self-disbelief in ``I Cain't Say No.''
</P>
<P>
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, the actors, Ms. Gabrielle's Laurey and Jimmy
Johnston's Will prime among them, are adroit with their feet. To
say that the dancing is better than any yet seen at the National is
maybe not to say much, since words not toes are the theater's
primary concern.
</P>
<P>
   But Susan Stroman's choreography would surely embellish any
stage, whether her hoofers are leaping through lassos, clattering
around picnic areas or giving us a version of Laurey's traumatic
life-changing dream that begins in a mood of Snow White innocence
and moves via the stealthily sexy to vividly embodied violence and
death. The episode lasts all of 15 minutes, yet, like everything
else in the evening, it doesn't seem a moment too long. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   After that, what is to be said for Leslie Bricusse's adaptation
of his screen musical of ``Doctor Dolittle,'' which has just opened
in a cavernous movie palace-turned-theater called Labatt's Apollo
in the Hammersmith district of London? Well, Mark Thompson and Jim
Henson's Creature Shop have come up with appealing enough designs.
</P>
<P>
   The title character floats off in a book-lined boat, with a tin
bath for its captain's bridge, to discover huge, silvery turtles, a
plodding mammoth, a couple of dodos, and the Great Pink Sea Snail,
a sweaty, blubbery monster that comes out of the darkness slurping,
burping and looking rather the way anybody might if his face had
been inflated with an air-pump, squeezed, and then decorated with a
couple of eyes on stalks.
</P>
<P>
   But this is a creative area where Disney's ``Lion King'' is
setting new standards for inventiveness and making fresh demands on
the imagination; and ``Dolittle'' cannot match that.
</P>
<P>
   Most of the imagination and inventiveness the show possesses
comes from Hugh Lofting, who 80 years ago began to write stories
about a country doctor who found it easier to speak to animal
patients in pig, fox or llama than to human ones in English.
</P>
<P>
   Bricusse has added little but rather ordinary music and lyrics,
choruses consisting of jaunty hicks in Victorian costume or of
angry, vengeful fox hunters, and some modish gestures to
contemporary ecologists and animal libbers.
</P>
<P>
   Not only must Phillip Schofield's Dolittle sing ``When we part,
there'll be no tears, no goodbyes/I'll just look into your eyes''
to the circus seal he disguises as a granny in a wheelchair and
tips into the Bristol Channel, the actor must intone indignant
rhymes about how we neglect, reject and do nothing to protect our
fellow creatures.
</P>
<P>
   Schofield brings a puckish charm to the role played by Rex
Harrison in the original movie. (The recently opened American film
starring Eddie Murphy as Dr. Dolittle is a different version.)
Julie Andrews, no less, owns the cut-glass voice that
intermittently emerges from Polynesia, the 200-year-old parrot.
</P>
<P>
   Undemanding under-10s will doubtless find it all fun; but
regrettably, the plot is also aimed at the over-10s, involving as
it does not only Dolittle's escape from the madhouse to the South
Seas but his burgeoning feelings for Sarah Jane Hassell's Emma, the
apostate member of the fox-hunting classes who becomes the ship's
cook.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe Steven Pimlott, who directs, hoped we would be charmed by
the moment when Ms. Hassell, stripped to period underwear, joins
Schofield in a confession of love. Myself, the sight of the
mega-snail chomping and grinning behind their cute conjunctions
reduced me to fits of unseemly, embarrassed giggles. &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   --- &QL; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The South Atlantic also provides part of the setting for
Timberlake Wertenbaker's ``After Darwin,'' the play that has just
opened at the Hampstead Theater in north London.
</P>
<P>
   But ``Doctor Dolittle'' groupies are likely to find a piece that
discusses the physical oddities of turtles and birds, not giant
pink sea snails, a mite challenging. Others may be glad to find
that, for the second time this summer, the British theater is
expanding its horizons to embrace science and scientific discovery.
Michael Frayn's admirable ``Copenhagen,'' still at the National,
asks us to ponder quantum physics and the A-bomb. Ms. Wertenbaker
brings no less curiosity and dramatic energy to the subject of
evolution.
</P>
<P>
   At first, her main characters seem to be Charles Darwin and
Robert FitzRoy, the cartographer, meteorologist and fanatic
creationist who commanded the HMS Beagle en route to
origin-of-species territory.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, they are appearing in a play within a play and turn
out also to be theater people with evolutionary interests of their
own. Jason Watkins' shrugging, laid-back Tom, who takes the role of
Darwin, decides to ditch the play for a movie that will renew him
professionally.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Feast's icily elegant Ian, the evening's FitzRoy, turns
to the law of the jungle to prevent this from happening. The
director, Ingeborga Dapkunaite's Millie, is a Bulgarian,
desperately trying to camouflage her identity and join the English
species.
</P>
<P>
   Even the play's author, Colin Salmon's Lawrence, turns out to be
a black man from the slums of Washington who has evolved and
adapted more than anybody else onstage.
</P>
<P>
   Unsurprisingly, some critics have felt that Ms. Wertenbaker,
herself an American-born dramatist who has built a successful
career in Britain, bangs away at her theme a bit relentlessly. With
everything from Tamagotchi pets to Balkan history pressed into what
becomes a running debate about Darwinism, you certainly get the
feeling that a program-seller might at any moment leap onstage to
announce her imminent sex change.
</P>
<P>
   But the dramatic brew is rich and mentally nourishing, embracing
as it does questions of God and godlessness, determinism and free
will, biology and ethics, and whether, as Ian puts it, personal
morality in contemporary Britain ``is an overspecialist refinement
that leads rapidly to extinction.''
</P>
<P>
   Myself, I found ``After Darwin'' even more absorbing than Ms.
Wertenbaker's tale of amateur dramatics among Australian convicts,
``Our Country's Good,'' and can but hope that it, too, is New
York-bound.

 &HT;    Braves on deck: Cincinnati Reds
 &HT;    By Thomas Stinson
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   _ When: 7:40 p.m.
</P>
<P>
   _ Where: Turner Field, Atlanta, Ga.
</P>
<P>
   _ TV: Fox Sports South.
</P>
<P>
   _ Probable starting pitchers: LHP Denny Neagle (11-9, 3.53; 8-3,
4.45 lifetime vs. Reds) vs. RHP Brett Tomko (10-7, 4.19; 0-1,
lifetime vs. Braves).
</P>
<P>
   _ Notes: In his first full major-league season, Tomko is giving
the Reds their most consistent work from the mound. Since losing to
Houston on June 15, Tomko has been defeated just once in nine
starts, going 5-1 with a superb 2.83 ERA. In his last 60 innings,
he has allowed 67 hits and struck out 37. The Reds' first selection
of the 1995 draft (second round, 54th overall), Tomko finished
seventh in the NL rookie of the year vote (behind No. 5 Andruw
Jones and No. 6 Vladimir Guerrero) after just 46 minor-league
games. He started 5-1 this season, went through a five-game losing
streak and is now pitching as well as he did in the early stages,
having allowed just 10 runs in his last six starts. He throws a
sinker that reaches the low 90s and might be harder on left-handers
than it is on righties. He has not pitched against Atlanta in 1998
but faced the Braves three times last season, the only start coming
in a 10-3 loss Aug. 23, whenhe gave up three runs in six innings.
His high career ERA against the Braves (4.19) was spoiled by his
debut, when he allowed back-to-back homers to Chipper Jones and and
Fred McGriff.

 &HT;    Industry in the rough
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ In a game in which blue-chip is the optimum, it has
gone shockingly chili-dip. The golf equipment industry suddenly has
become scarier than a downhill lie over water to a sloping green.
</P>
<P>
   While golf is enjoying record popularity in rounds played and TV
ratings, some major players in the equipment industry have either
sunk or are barely afloat.
</P>
<P>
   _ Jack Nicklaus' Golden Bear Golf Inc., has been sued by its
shareholders for allegedly hiding nearly $22 million in losses. The
company's stock _ JACK _ has been frozen temporarily on the NASDAQ
exchange, pending further investigation, and has dropped from $22
per share after its initial public offering in August 1996 to $4.
</P>
<P>
   _ Lynx Golf Inc., which includes Fred Couples and Jim Nantz as
partners, has filed for bankruptcy protection. The company, which
lost $15 million on sales of $8.9 million as of June, has not made
a profit in seven years.
</P>
<P>
   _ Callaway Golf Co., which originally projected 1998 sales of
nearly $1 billion, reported on July 22 a 55 percent decline in
profits for its second quarter _ $21.1 million compared with $46.8
million for the period a year ago. The company's stock has dropped
from $36 1/2 to $12-5/16 per share, and its entire temporary work
force of 300 has been released.
</P>
<P>
   _ Cobra Golf recently laid off more than 100 employees over a
two-week period.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Arnold Palmer Golf Co. has closed its Ooltewah, Tenn.,
plant, costing 89 jobs.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a bad time to be in (the industry),'' Adam Barr, former
business editor for The Golf Channel. Barr, now president of an
Atlanta firm, The Calliope Group, which lists Precept golf balls
and E-Z-GO golf carts among its clients, cites saturation as a
major contributor.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you sold somebody a $500 driver a year and a half ago and
now you want to sell them a $600 driver that doesn't do much
differently, it's a hard sell _ even for those golfers who whip out
a checkbook at a moment's notice,'' Barr said, referring to
companies such as Callaway and Taylor Made, which have slashed
prices on titanium drivers.
</P>
<P>
   ``As far as companies like Lynx and Nicklaus, which are doing
between $15 (million) and $30 million a year, it's hard to make
money at that double-digit level. Callaway did around $800 million
last year and you need that kind of marketing muscle to get shelf
space in pro shops.''
</P>
<P>
   The companies thriving lately are the specialty club
manufacturers such as Orlimar (TriMetal) and Adams (Tight Lies),
whose fairway woods in the $150-$200 range are being introduced to
consumers mainly through TV infomercials. Adams was able to pry
Nick Faldo from Mizuno, offering $16 million in stock. Conversely,
Lynx just lost Senior Tour star Gil Morgan, who apparently will
sign with Callaway.
</P>
<P>
   More and more companies, such as Callaway and Nike, are getting
into the golf-ball business as a way to offset losses elsewhere.
Unlike drivers and $1,500 sets of irons, golf balls are made to be
lost.

 &HT;    Golf notebook: Father knows best; Kuchar needs rest
 &HT;    By Glenn Sheeley
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Peter Kuchar was genuinely worried about the mental
burden on his son Matt as he decided whether to turn professional.
The father announced last week that Kuchar would remain at Georgia
Tech for at least his junior year. ``When you've got a 20-year-old
lying awake at night tossing and turning over a decision, that's no
fun,'' Peter Kuchar said. A week earlier, the father had reminded
how much Matt loves the college experience. ``I had a long talk the
other day with Payne Stewart,'' Peter said, ``and you know what
Tiger Woods misses? Stanford. He has nobody but Mark O'Meara to
talk to.''Inspiration for Price
</P>
<P>
   It's probably nothing more than a coincidence, but Nick Price's
last two PGA Tour victories, coming 16 months apart, came while he
was wearing a memorial ribbon on his cap. Price won at Hilton Head
in April 1996 with a green ribbon in honor of his since-deceased
caddie Squeeky Medlen. On Sunday, Price's cap was adorned with a
black ribbon in memory of Renay Appleby, 25, the wife of PGA Tour
colleague Stuart Appleby, who was killed in a London car accident
July 23.
</P>
<P>
   Chip shots
</P>
<P>
   Bob Green, 66, for 26 years the Associated Press golf writer,
died Thursday of cancer at Baylor University Medical Center. ...
Cartersville native John Maginnes chipped in from 80 feet _ a
semi-blind shot up a steep bank _ on the second hole of sudden
death to defeat Ryan Howison and Sean Murphy for the Nike Dakota
Dunes title Sunday. After securing the richest prize on the Nike
Tour ($58,500), Maginnes made Murphy feel like a robbed man. ``He
could not make it from there again with another 100 balls,'' Murphy
said. Maginnes borrowed Robert Floyd's caddie when his regular
caddie, Garland Dempsey, was hospitalized a couple of hours before
his tee time. ... The fifth-place finish by Gainesville's Tim
Conley at Memphis on Sunday was his best in PGA Tour competition.
... Atlanta resident Hiromi Kobayashi burned some serious cash at
the end of the du Maurier on Sunday. She double-bogeyed the 18th
hole and tied for ninth at 276, earning $26,871, seven strokes
behind winner Brandie Burton. A par at 18 and 274 would have earned
third-place money of $81,519. ... The LPGA's youth movement for
1998 has the look of the PGA Tour in 1997. All four LPGA majors
were won by players in their 20s _ Se Ri Pak (20), the LPGA
McDonald's Championship and U.S. Women's Open; Pat Hurst (28), the
Nabisco Dinah Shore; and Burton (26). ... A field of 16 players
will compete Nov. 12-15 in the $720,000 Senior Match Play Challenge
_ 12 off the money list and four invitees _ at the Bighorn Golf
Club in Palm Desert, Calif. ... Johnny Bench, the Hall of Fame
catcher, let a few passed balls get by him last week at the Utah
Showdown in his Senior Tour debut. Bench opened with a 78 and
finished at 15-over-par. ... Atlanta's Billy Andrade needed his
second top-10 of the year at Memphis on Sunday to secure a spot in
next week's PGA Championship at Sahalee Country Club near Seattle.
He finished 50th and will miss the tournament for the first time in
10 years.

 &HT;    Southern company bringing cable Net access to rural areas
 &HT;    By Charles Haddad
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Columbia, Tenn., may be a small city, but its interest
in the Internet looms large.
</P>
<P>
   Just ask David Ames and Terry Wright, two Atlanta entrepreneurs
who are building a business offering towns and small cities, such
as Columbia, high-speed access to the Internet through cable TV
lines.
</P>
<P>
   Their contrarian strategy focuses on the 40 percent of the cable
TV market not being wired for high-speed Internet access by big
operators such as Atlanta-based Cox Communications.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people think that there's less demand in small or
rural markets, but the opposite is true,'' says Terry Wright, chief
technology officer and co-founder of Convergence.com.
</P>
<P>
   The Internet has quickly become very popular in places like
Columbia, where there are so few other forms of entertainment, says
Wright.
</P>
<P>
   If he and Ames are correct and their company takes off, they
plan to eventually take Convergence.com public.
</P>
<P>
   Right now, Convergence.com. is a private company based in
Suwanee, Ga. It employs about 20 people in a new, state of the art
service center.
</P>
<P>
   Wright and Ames, co-founder and chairman respectively, have
entered a fast, emerging business. As cable operators rebuild their
lines to send and receive digital signals, they are adding many
services. One of them is cable modems, which use cable networks to
connect computers to the Internet. Cable modems offer speeds up to
100 times faster than conventional telephone lines.
</P>
<P>
   There are about 200,000 cable modem customers nationwide, most
concentrated in large cities in California and the Northeast.
</P>
<P>
   Metro Atlanta has a handful of cable modem customers served by
Comcast and MediaOne. Two of the largest cable operators, these
companies are focusing their efforts on the top 50 markets.
</P>
<P>
   It's a strategy that omits some 20 million to 35 million cable
subscribers scattered among markets in rural areas and small
cities. With typically 150,000 subscribers or fewer, these systems
lack the critical mass to afford such advanced offerings as cable
modems.
</P>
<P>
   And many of these smaller systems are wary of teaming up with
bigger operators.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're the alternative,'' Ames says.
</P>
<P>
   The company has signed up more than 30 operators serving some
800,000 cable TV subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're focusing on the second- and third-tier markets,'' Ames
says
</P>
<P>
   Ames and Wright won't disclose Convergence.com's revenue or
number of cable modem subscribers, but they say the number is
growing at a double-digit rate.
</P>
<P>
   Their business plan, they say, calls for the company to have
600,000 subscribers in 260 systems in five years.
</P>
<P>
   They also say, like all of their competitors, Convergence.com is
not yet profitable.
</P>
<P>
   But the company is expected to reach profitability within 20
months, if growth continues at its present rate. Wright says the
company is adding about 25-50 new subscribers a month.

 &HT;    Time to weigh investment goals and consider risks
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs with DOW-COX.)
 &HT;    By Robert Luke
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Wall Street's blue skies suddenly appear clouded.
</P>
<P>
   Time to bail out?
</P>
<P>
   Not so fast, the experts advise. Instead, now may be a good time
for many individual investors to step back and reassess their
investment goals and tolerance for risk.
</P>
<P>
   Many investors have come to believe they can't go wrong with
stocks in the long run.
</P>
<P>
   That may be so, given that common stocks have provided the
highest rates of return over the past seven decades.
</P>
<P>
   But history also shows stock are among the riskiest investments.
They lose money about a third of the time, so investors must be
financially and psychologically prepared for this eventuality.
</P>
<P>
   What to do?
</P>
<P>
   Stay the course if your investment time horizon is five years or
more, advises Phillip Larkins, market strategist at Legacy South,
an Atlanta-based money management firm.
</P>
<P>
   ``But if you think you're going to need the money in three years
or less, then we think that portion of your portfolio should pretty
much be out of the market,'' Larkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Other experts recommend:
</P>
<P>
   _ Where tax considerations allow, rebalance your portfolio if
the rise in stock prices has pushed the stock portion beyond the
amount originally allocated. For example, many risk-averse
investors in retirement might have 20 percent of their portfolios
in stocks, while aggressive investors nowhere near retirement might
have 80 percent or more in stocks.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're speculating on high-flying stocks or mutual funds,
it's time to peel off some profits.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you've been putting money steadily into retirement
accounts, keep doing so. Just make sure your eggs aren't in one
basket.
</P>
<P>
   _ If you're bargain-hunting, be patient. The impulse of most
investors is to buy a stock immediately after it falls. But what
usually happens is that it rebounds a bit, only to fall back again.
</P>
<P>
   ``Buying on dips is sort of like trying to catch a falling
knife,'' Larkins said.
</P>
<P>
   Many bargain-hunters already are stepping up to buy the market
leaders _ typically big blue chip stocks _ on any sign of weakness.
</P>
<P>
   But that's risky, argues money manager James F. Barksdale of
Atlanta-based Equity Investment Corp. He prefers to shop for
bargains among battered small-company stocks, which already have
suffered declines of 20 percent or more.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some very good companies in the small-cap arena that
are selling for very reasonable prices,'' said Barksdale, citing
packaging manufacturer Liqui-Box, specialty chemicals maker
Sigma-Aldrich and auto parts maker Superior Industries as examples.
</P>
<P>
   Larkins also finds bargains among downtrodden cyclical stocks,
such as those of steel maker Nucor and aircraft maker Boeing.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, Tuesday's market tumble shouldn't only be a wake up
call on the investment front. It should also be a reality check on
spending, Larkins said.
</P>
<P>
   The longest bull market in history has increased the net worths
of many individuals, prompting some to aggressively borrow.
</P>
<P>
   ``You've got to be careful with that, because your net worth
might not be as high as you think it is, once we get through a
correction or a bear market,'' Larkins said. ``I see this all the
time, people buying $800,000 homes when they really should be
looking at $400,000 homes. That's where I see real risk.''

 &HT;    Beach 'band-aid approach' to erosion won't work
 &HT;    By Chris Burritt
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   HOLDEN BEACH, N.C._With the hurricane season's first tropical
storm, Alex, already dissipated into a few puffs of wind off the
Leeward Islands, this coastal North Carolina town's new $1 million
sand dune still is untouched and seemingly invincible.
</P>
<P>
   But locals know that if a big storm blows in, the manmade dune
guarding $400,000 beachfront homes would be as vulnerable as a
child's sand castle at high tide.
</P>
<P>
   ``That dune looks nice, and it makes you feel like you've got a
little security,'' said Wayne Thompson, 42, a sun-beaten contractor
who stays busy rebuilding decks and walkways damaged by the
beachfront erosion. ``But you get a hurricane in here, it won't
last.''
</P>
<P>
   This summer's high tides are actually nibbling away at portions
of Holden Beach's 4 1/2 mile-long dune, a nail-biting reminder that
these barrier islands are even more fragile two years after
hurricanes Bertha and Fran plowed ashore 15 miles east of here at
the Cape Fear River.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are about as prepared as we can be,'' said Mike Morgan,
manager of Holden Beach, a popular family beach enjoying one of its
best summers in years. ``We have our fingers crossed.''
</P>
<P>
   Up and down the East Coast, the anticipation of hurricane season
is as enduring a summertime ritual as eating fried seafood at
Calabash, N.C., and shag-dancing at Myrtle Beach. Tourism worth
billions of dollars drives coastal economies from Key West to Nags
Head, N.C., and for the past two years beach towns have been riding
a lucky streak.
</P>
<P>
   During 1997 and so far this summer, the East Coast has been
spared from hurricanes, but even with Alex's breakup, forecasters
were predicting trouble for the east coast. Following the remnants
of Alex was a large tropical wave about midway between the Lesser
Antilles and the Cape Verde islands Sunday that could brew into a
storm. Weather watchers also have warned of the potential for
greater hurricane activity from the emerging La Nina, the weather
counter-balance to spring's troublesome El Nino.
</P>
<P>
   It is unusual for the African tropics to spawn storms such as
Alex this early in the hurricane season, forecasters say. But when
they do, they typically signal that the remainder of the season
will be active, as was the case two summers ago when North Carolina
suffered the one-two punch of hurricanes Bertha and Fran.
</P>
<P>
   Bertha hit on July 12, 1996, softening up the coastal defenses
for the Sept. 5 assault by Fran, North Carolina's most costly
natural disaster with damages of an estimated $6.5 billion and 22
deaths. The destruction reached as far inland as Raleigh, but was
most punishing on Topsail Island, a narrow spit northeast of
Wilmington.
</P>
<P>
   Federal aid to North Carolina in disaster-assistance grants,
loans and payments was an estimated $1 billion.
</P>
<P>
   The beaches southwest of Wilmington escaped with relatively
little damage. On Holden Beach, estimated damages of $200,000
included houses that lost shingles, siding and a small number of
decks. Even so, people who've watched nor'easterns and other
unnamed storms eat away at these beaches say southeastern North
Carolina's coastline is poorly prepared for a major assault.
</P>
<P>
   Back in 1954, Hurricane Hazel cut Holden Beach in two, and more
than four decades later, the newly constructed beachfront dune
wouldn't stand a chance against a similar storm, experts said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Before Fran and Bertha, the beaches were in bad shape,'' said
Bill Cleary, a geology professor at the University of North
Carolina at Wilmington. ``They are even more vulnerable to storms
because the beaches have not rebuilt as they were expected to
rebuild.''
</P>
<P>
   Cleary's studies at UNC-Wilmington's Center for Marine Science
Research have found that big storms push sand far off shore, rather
than deposit on the ocean floor just beyond the low-tide mark. The
result, he said, is narrow beaches that provide little resistance
to the punishing tidal surges that accompany big storms.
</P>
<P>
   Cleary called Holden Beach's dune a ``Band-aid approach that
would not last at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Morgan, Holden Beach's manager, doesn't disagree that the dune,
consisting of 220,000 cubic yards of sand trucked in from a nearby
construction site, is vulnerable. Still, he said, town officials
decided that the dune would be essential to protect the town's $330
million tax base.
</P>
<P>
   Long-range plans by Holden Beach call for replenishing the beach
with more sand, an expensive project that would require state and
federal funding, Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   Built over a year, the dune measures 25 feet at its base and
eight feet tall. It is plugged with North American beach grass. The
town paid half of the cost, while oceanfront property owners are
being assessed for the remainder, Morgan said.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are those who say Mother Nature will do what Mother
Nature wants to do,'' said Morgan, a retired U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers colonel. ``But we feel, as a lot of beach communities do,
that it is proper and prudent to do things to maintain your lines
of defense on your beaches.''

 &HT;    Scientific-Atlanta increasing its capacity to produce set-top
boxes
 &HT;    By Mark Clothier
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Scientific-Atlanta Inc. said it will double
manufacturing capacity at its Juarez, Mexico, factory by October to
meet expected demand for its digital, interactive television unit.
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, the Georgia company signed agreements with
nine cable companies which are in the early stages of rolling out a
digital cable network.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta is increasing its ability to build more
Explorer 2000 digital set-tops in hopes customers of those cable
companies will request the enhanced services, said spokesman Bob
Meyers.
</P>
<P>
   A second production line is being added to the
225,000-square-foot Juarez factory, across the Rio Grande from El
Paso, Texas. The two lines will be able to make 1 million digital
boxes per year by October. Adjacent land is available for plant
expansion.
</P>
<P>
   A descendant of Scientific-Atlanta's standard cable television
set-top tuners, the Explorer 2000 digital boxes are about the size
of a small videocassette recorder and allow such services as
video-on-demand, electronic commerce and Internet access through
your television.
</P>
<P>
   Scientific-Atlanta sells them to cable television companies for
about $400 a unit.
</P>
<P>
   The Juarez facility was built in 1995. It employs 2,000 people
at wages one-third those of the Scientific-Atlanta's local
manufacturing employees, Meyers said. Scientific-Atlanta employs
3,500 people in metro Atlanta.
</P>
<P>
   The Federal Communications Commission is expected to require the
retail sale of set-top boxes by July 2000. The new production line
would give Scientific-Atlanta the ability to meet potential demand
for new boxes brought about by the federal mandate.
</P>
<P>
   Now, cable customers who need boxes lease them from their local
cable companies on a monthly basis. Under the new rules, customers
would be able to buy the boxes in stores or from cable companies.

 &HT;    SEC requiring disclosure of Y2K readiness
 &HT;    By Rob Chambers
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   ATLANTA _ Y2K is related to Catch-22.
</P>
<P>
   Last week the Securities and Exchange Commission issued new
guidelines that require a public company to provide Y2K information
in certain documents it files with the SEC. Such disclosures are
supposed to include the company's Year 2000 costs, readiness, risks
and contingency plans.
</P>
<P>
   Catch-22 kicks in because corporations have feared putting out
that kind of information would invite lawsuits. By some estimates,
lawers will earn $1 trillion from Y2K litigation.
</P>
<P>
   Given such corporate fears, a less formal request by the SEC
earlier in the year did not produce much of a response.
</P>
<P>
   Now, ``the commission has made it clear that Year 2000
disclosure must be made,'' said spokesman John Heine.
</P>
<P>
   The guidelines do exempt a company that's completed its Y2K
assessment or a company that's determined it doesn't have a
problem. But owing to the breadth and complexity of potential
difficulties, ``such as embedded system and third party interface
issues,'' Robert O. Ball of Atlanta's Alston &AMP; Bird law firm, says
``the guidelines essentially mandate some sort of Year 2000
disclosure from just about all public companies.''
</P>
<P>
   The good news: The SEC has spelled out examples of what
information it's seeking and has indicated Y2K disclosures are the
sort of ````forward looking statements'' covered by the Private
Securities Reform Act of 1995.
</P>
<P>
   That legislation protects a public company against private
lawsuits when company estimates about the future turn out to be
inaccurate. But the company must have made those projections in
good faith.
</P>
<P>
   Ball said ``those protections should provide some comfort to
companies making Year 2000 disclosures.'' But, he said, ``a
company's disclosures are going to require some careful thought and
advice.''
</P>
<P>
   The flip side: If companies ``don't disclose Year 2000
information, they're opening themselves up to lawsuits under the
securities laws,'' said Heine.
</P>
<P>

commission's Web site at http://www.sec.gov.

TICKET POLICY FORCES MOM TO CHOOSE WHICH DAUGHTER WILL SEE SPICE
GIRLS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By LIDIA ROMERO  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   All Jaqueline Rausch wanted for her two daughters was a little
``girl power.''
</P>
<P>
   Spice Girl power, of course.
</P>
<P>
   The Peoria mother had promised to take both her daughters,
Kristin, 6, and Keira, 7, to the Aug. 22 Spice Girls concert at
Blockbuster Desert Sky Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   But because of the concert venue's ticket policy regarding the
handicapped, she said, she has been forced to choose which of her
daughters _ both fans _ will get to see the smash teeny-bopper
music sensations.
</P>
<P>
   As it is, only one daughter will get to see Posh, Sporty, Scary
and Baby; one will have to stay home.
</P>
<P>
   ``They're asking me to choose between my handicapped daughter or
my non-handicapped daughter,'' Rausch said. ``They can't do that.''
</P>
<P>
   Rausch said she is so outraged that she has filed a
discrimination complaint with the Arizona Attorney General's
Office, Civil Rights Division, against the west Phoenix pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just fed up,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   Two weeks ago, Rausch said, she called Ticketmaster to buy three
Spice tickets in the disabled section, which accommodates 140.
</P>
<P>
   But she was told she was not allowed to buy more than two
tickets for that section. Ticketmaster told her that is the policy
of Blockbuster Desert Sky Pavilion.
</P>
<P>
   ``We simply provide the tickets. The venue tell us what to do,''
Greg Corns, a Ticketmaster spokesman, said after refusing to
comment further on the case.
</P>
<P>
   Rausch then called Blockbuster Desert Sky Pavilion, where again
she was told she could purchase only two tickets. When she
explained her situation, she said, they told her if they bent the
rules for her, others would follow.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have a high school degree and I know that policy
doesn't make sense,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   The policy states that tickets reserved for people with
disabilities are available for only two weeks, at which time any
remaining are offered to the general public.
</P>
<P>
   It also states that for some events ``patrons with a disability
are allowed to purchase only two tickets.''
</P>
<P>
   ``For our most popular concerts, we may limit the number of
companion seats that a disabled person may purchase to accommodate
the greatest number of disabled persons,'' said the Pavilion's
executive director, Fran Macferran, in a statement. The Spice Girls
concert is almost sold out.
</P>
<P>
   Rausch says this policy is discriminatory.
</P>
<P>
   She said she was told by an investigator with the Arizona
Attorney General's Office that the pavilion must keep seats for the
disabled open to people with disabilities and their families until
the day of the concert.
</P>
<P>
   The Americans with Disabilities Act requires only one
``companion'' seat to be sold per disabled seat, but the actual
number of disabled seats varies with the venue and the event.
</P>
<P>
   Pavilion officials refused to comment on the specific complaint.
</P>
<P>
   Rausch's daughter Keira has been disabled since she was 2 months
old. She suffered a stroke and was in a coma for nine days. She now
suffers from cerebral palsy and epilepsy and is a spastic
quadriplegic.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm just thankful we have her,'' Rausch said. ``She's the one
that keeps me going. I have to be her advocate.''
</P>
<P>
   She said her daughters are limited in what they do together, but
they both love the Spice Girls, and the concert is something they
would both enjoy.
</P>
<P>
   She doesn't take them to the playground or fast food restaurants
together because she can't give the attention that both her
daughters need, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Kristin dances and sings when her mother plays the Spice Girls
movie or CD. And that makes Keira happy, Rausch said.
</P>
<P>
   Rausch said she didn't lodge her complaint for money but just to
have the opportunity to take both her daughters to the concert.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people to feel she's any different, because she's
not,'' she said. ``I just want my daughters to go to a concert
together.'' &QL;

ISRAEL, NATION OF HOMEOWNERS, LOOKS TO MODERNIZE MORTGAGE SYSTEM

 By JESSICA STEINBERG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   JERUSALEM _ Julie Zuckerman and Josh Kulp, an American couple
who moved to Israel three years ago, did not know what to expect
when they shopped for their first mortgage here. What they got was
a dizzying education in one of the more complicated home finance
systems in the developed world.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Zuckerman, a vice president of an investment bank, and Kulp,
a teacher of Judaic studies, now own a $212,000 five-bedroom duplex
in Modi'in, one of the new towns that has sprung up along the
40-mile highway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv. But it took three
loans, at three interest rates, to make that possible.
</P>
<P>
   A bank lent $74,000 at 4.8 percent. To encourage movement to a
new town, the government provided two more loans for another
$41,000, charging 4.5 percent for one and 4 percent for the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``We had to decide on our mortgage within 20 days because the
rates change on a daily basis,'' said Ms. Zuckerman, who used
savings and family loans to come up with the rest of the purchase
price. ``The whole process was certainly more frustrating than we
had expected.''
</P>
<P>
   And it may remain so. Ms. Zuckerman does not really know what
she and Kulp will be paying because mortgages here are adjusted
annually for inflation, as are salaries.
</P>
<P>
   As baffling and daunting as the mortgage system is, it has
nonetheless produced a nation of homeowners. About 73 percent of
the country's 5 million citizens live in privately owned homes,
compared with 66 percent in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in Israel, home ownership is a type of pioneerism, the
modern-day method of settling the Jewish homeland. Accordingly, the
mortgage system has been a tool to foster land development and
further other social ends. Children from big families receive
larger loans than those from smaller ones, for instance, because
their parents have less money to lend them. Ethiopian immigrants
receive more than Russian immigrants because most Ethiopians arrive
in Israel without any savings.
</P>
<P>
   But now, the creaky mortgage system is at a crossroads,
scrambling to find ways to keep pumping out all those new loans to
people like Ms. Zuckerman and Kulp.
</P>
<P>
   A holdover from the early days of statehood, when Israel's
socialist nature promised home and hearth for every citizen, the
system has had to expand to accommodate an ever more populous and
diverse country. It has also had to adjust as that nation has
lurched from heavy state control to a free market economy.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has nine mortgage banks, with the biggest now in the
process of being privatized. Even so, the system remains an amalgam
of private and public money. The banks administer all the loans,
including $2 billion a year in mortgages that the government's
Housing Ministry provides. The challenge is continuing the steady
flow of $4 billion a year in nongovernment loans, a huge amount of
financing for such a small country to generate.
</P>
<P>
   While Israel is now experiencing a mild recession, and it is not
uncommon to find new homes going begging for buyers, many in the
construction and lending industries fear tight credit. And that
means, those in the private sector say, that even as the government
tries to disengage from the mortgage business, there is an
important new role for it to play: providing guarantees for a
secondary mortgage market.
</P>
<P>
   Such a market would serve as a new lending source by pooling and
repackaging mortgage loans as bonds. The idea is for the banks to
sell their loans to a quasi-government company, similar to Fannie
Mae or Freddie Mac in the United States, which would bundle the
mortgages as securities and sell them to institutional investors
worldwide, funneling new cash back to the banks for use as new
loans.
</P>
<P>
   But despite the government's traditionally deep role in the
mortgage market, officials are balking at providing loan
guarantees, which would make the bundled mortgages more attractive
to investors.
</P>
<P>
   After a two-year study, a government committee made up of
representatives from the central bank and the Finance and Housing
ministries concluded that the capital markets should take
responsibility for a secondary mortgage market.
</P>
<P>
   The panel suggested easing regulations and lowering other
barriers to such a market, including removing certain taxes.
Finance Minister Yaakov Neeman is expected to seek approval for the
market, but without the government acting as insurer.
</P>
<P>
   However the battle over a secondary market turns out, the
mortgage system's central role in the country's social fabric is
not going to change, industry experts say.
</P>
<P>
   Many Israeli borrowers considered eligible for loans here would
never stand the test of an American mortgage application, says
Doron Nachmani, deputy manager of the Tefahot Israel Mortgage Bank,
the largest of the mortgage banks.
</P>
<P>
   Some are young couples who recently completed their army service
and are entering college, while others are new Russian immigrants
with little experience paying back long-term loans. Then there are
the settlers living in politically disputed development towns over
the so-called Green Line _ the local term for the border between
Israel proper and the territories claimed by both Israel and the
Palestinians.
</P>
<P>
   The banks here have instituted their own checklists to determine
who is credit worthy. Among other things, borrowers usually present
various family members to vouch for them, a system that insures a
high payback rate because the borrowers do not want to put their
families at risk.
</P>
<P>
   Construction was one of the fastest-growing sectors in the
country after the wave of emigration from Russian and
suburbanization of Israel in the early 1990s. Immigration has since
slowed down and so has the economy, resulting in an overflow of
available homes.
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, prices remain high. Nachmani, who is leading the
lobbying for a government-backed secondary mortgage market, says
the government's minimum mortgage loan of 70,000 shekels, or about
$19,000, an amount that was set back in 1992, will not buy much
more than a kitchen these days, much less a three-bedroom house.
</P>
<P>
   Given the lack of cash flow into the mortgage banks' coffers,
the idea of a secondary mortgage market, insured by the government,
has taken hold in the lending industry.
</P>
<P>
   But Shai Talmon, the Finance Ministry's accountant general and
head of the government committee weighing the issue, is not
interested in further involving the government. He says that
government-backing of the secondary market will not solve the
long-term funding problem. What is needed, he says, is simply a
commitment by the private sector to put up more money.
</P>
<P>
   That is a paradoxical decision, said Menachem Feder, a Tel Aviv
lawyer who is advising Bank Tefahot on mortgage security.
</P>
<P>
   ``Laissez-faire is a nice concept, but curious when the
government already slow dances with several mortgage programs,'' he
said, referring to the $2 billion in loans that it issues each
year. Feder, a former Wall Street lawyer, welcomes the committee's
recommendations to foster private initiative but is concerned about
the slowness of change.
</P>
<P>
   ``Until that possibly distant day when the private sector will
produce a secondary market all by itself,'' he said, ``we're forced
into half-baked methods of financing.''

FAMILIES IN SWITCHED BABIES CASE HOPE TO AVOID COURT 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By RICK BRAGG   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   BUENA VISTA, Va. _ For now, all the two families are swapping is
baby pictures.
</P>
<P>
   Families on both sides of the case of two 3-year-old girls
apparently switched shortly after birth in a Virginia hospital in
1995 said Tuesday that they only wanted what was best for the
toddlers, and wanted to decide the children's futures themselves,
not in a courtroom.
</P>
<P>
   But what that will mean for the two blond little girls _ whether
they would remain with the families that they have come to know as
their own or begin again with their biological relatives _ is still
too soon to tell, said family members.
</P>
<P>
   Paula Johnson, the young mother from Ruckerville, Va., who,
while trying to get a little extra money in child support from an
absent father, learned through blood tests in July that her little
girl, Callie, was not her biological daughter, said she just wanted
both girls to be safe and happy, and to live out a normal
childhood.
</P>
<P>
   The two families raising the other little girl, Rebecca Chittum
_ whose parents were killed in a Fourth of July automobile accident
_ say they also hope that custody will not become a struggle
between lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Johnson, her face red and streaked with tears as she spoke
at a crowded press conference in Charlottesville, Va., Tuesday
afternoon, said that no decision has been made by either side on
whether the two little girls will stay with the families that have
raised them, but that she hopes issues of custody and visitation,
issues that are seldom settled outside court, can be handled by the
two families.
</P>
<P>
   ``However it may be, as long as the children are taken care
of,'' said Ms. Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Sadness seems to circle around this story here in the deep green
of the Shenandoah Valley, a story that has has drawn reporters from
as far as England. And that sadness goes far beyond the possible
mix-up of the babies' identities.
</P>
<P>
   When asked what she thought of the photograph of the girl who
could be her daughter, Ms. Johnson said she was struck by the fact
that ``she was a beautiful child, and that she looked like me.''
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, she said, none of her love for Callie has evaporated
with the knowledge that she did not come from her body.
</P>
<P>
   ``This child is absolutely wonderful,'' said Ms. Johnson, who
has other children. ``My two oldest boys, they want to know how
Callie is going to understand any of this. They want to know how
I'm going to tell her.''
</P>
<P>
   If the babies were indeed switched at birth on June 30, 1995, it
would mean that it was Callie, not Rebecca, who was legally
orphaned by the crash that killed Tamara Whitney Rogers, 19, and
Kevin Chittum, 25, last Independence Day. They were engaged to be
married.
</P>
<P>
   Mary Watts, Rebecca's great aunt, wept when she saw pictures of
Ms. Johnson holding Callie.
</P>
<P>
   ``I cried,'' she said, ``because her little child looked just
like Kevin.''
</P>
<P>
   The automobile crash happened just one day after Ms. Johnson
learned through tests at the University of Virginia Hospital that
she was not Callie's birth mother.
</P>
<P>
   Since the accident, which also killed Chittum's 13-year-old
sister, Bridget Chittum, and 11-year-old niece, Sheena Miskovsky,
as well as two neighborhood children, Rebecca has been cared for by
the Chittum and Rogers families. They worked out a joint custody
agreement to raise the little girl and a 1-year-old sibling,
Lindsey.
</P>
<P>
   Much of that responsibility had fallen on Rosa Chittum,
Rebecca's grandmother.
</P>
<P>
   On Monday, she told reporters that the whole saga has been
``just awful.''
</P>
<P>
   Family members caring for Rebecca have so far refused a DNA test
that would prove whether Rebecca really is Ms. Johnson's child.
</P>
<P>
   ``They want to know, but they don't want to know,'' said the
family's lawyer, Pete Robey.
</P>
<P>
   He said that no matter what test results might show, the two
families want to continue sharing custody of Rebecca.
</P>
<P>
   The best solution, both sides say, is that the two little girls
wind up with two sets of people who love them, but both sides have
hired lawyers even though they say they do not want to use them.
For the time being, the babies will stay with the families who now
care for them, as visitation and custody is worked out, family
members said.
</P>
<P>
   Legal experts, however, say such cases are almost always settled
in protracted court battles that are often disastrous for the
children involved.
</P>
<P>
   Here in Buena Vista, a small town overshadowed by wooded peaks
and gently nudged by a slow-moving river, people applaud the two
families in Rebecca's case who stepped in to care for her after the
tragedy, and wonder how such a mistake _ if it was a mistake _
could happen in a hospital nursery.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'd tell everybody, `You'd better have your baby tested before
you leave the hospital, to make sure its yours,''' said Mrs. Watts,
the great aunt.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm angry,'' she said. ``The hospital made a mistake.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials at the University of Virginia hospital, however, have
said they do not know how such a mistake could have been made, and
are assisting with a criminal investigation of the case.
</P>
<P>
   The case, as sad as it is, did answer one question.
</P>
<P>
   Miss Rogers had once told Mrs. Watts that the baby ``didn't
really look like her,'' Mrs. Watts remembered. ``She said that she
didn't really look like anybody.''

REHNQUIST CLEARS WAY FOR STARR TEAM TO QUESTION WHITE HOUSE
LAWYERS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By JOHN C. HENRY 
and NANCY MATHIS 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Chief Justice William Rehnquist on Tuesday rejected
an urgent appeal from the Clinton administration, clearing the way
for independent counsel Kenneth Starr to begin questioning White
House lawyers who helped plan President Clinton's response to the
Monica Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   Two hours after Rehnquist verbally denied the administration's
request to block testimony by Clinton's government-paid lawyers,
Starr summoned Lanny Breuer, a White House special counsel, to
appear before a grand jury investigating the alleged presidential
affair and cover-up.
</P>
<P>
   Toward the end of the day, Breuer and his attorney, accompanied
by White House lawyers and Starr's deputies, met with U.S. District
Judge Norma Holloway Johnson in a closed-door session that raised
the specter of another effort by the White House to invoke
attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's ruling by Rehnquist grew out of Starr's six-month
effort to question Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White House counsel and
longtime Clinton confidant who has argued that requiring him to
testify before the grand jury would infringe on the president's
right to confidential communications with his lawyers.
</P>
<P>
   With Lindsey recovering from back surgery, Starr's team of
prosecutors agreed to question him later, then immediately summoned
Breuer. A New York attorney who joined the president's legal staff
in early 1997, Breuer has played a central role in the White House
damage control effort by debriefing grand jury witnesses, compiling
documents and processing subpoenas.
</P>
<P>
   Although Rehnquist refused to intervene, the Supreme Court could
decide later to review the ruling by the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the District of Columbia that a president's conversations with
White House lawyers are not shielded from grand jury questioning
because the lawyers are working for taxpayers, not the president.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decision was the second major loss Rehnquist has dealt
recently to the Clinton administration. On July 17, the chief
justice, who hears emergency appeals from the District of Columbia,
rejected a similar effort by the administration to keep Secret
Service employees from having to tell the grand jury what they
observed while protecting Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   White House spokesman Barry Toiv said there was ``some
disappointment here about that decision,'' but confirmed plans to
push for a full court review of the issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a critical issue. This is not merely about whether one
person is required to testify,'' Toiv said. ``This is an issue of
whether the president _ this president and future presidents _ are
able to have access to the attorney-client privilege, which is a
bedrock of our legal system.''
</P>
<P>
   The president spent time Tuesday with his private attorneys,
David Kendall and Nicole Seligman, preparing for his Aug. 17
testimony to the grand jury via closed-circuit television.
</P>
<P>
   Although Toiv confirmed the president's session with Kendall and
Seligman, the spokesman said the White House would no longer
respond to questions about Clinton's meetings with his private
lawyers. ``It's just not necessary,'' Toiv said.
</P>
<P>
   One White House official, who spoke on condition of anonymity,
said the president wants to be ``allowed to meet privately with his
lawyers without reporting it on a day-to-day basis.''
</P>
<P>
   Also Tuesday, Lewinsky met with her attorneys _ Plato Cacheris,
Jacob Stein and Nathaniel Speights _ preparing for her appearance
before the grand jury, which possibly could come later this week.
</P>
<P>
   After his session with Kendall and Seligman, Clinton spent more
than an hour with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus whose members
told reporters they continued to embrace the embattled president.
</P>
<P>
   ``To a man and a woman we told the president that we appreciate
his support, what he's done on behalf of our community and for the
American people, and because of that reason we stand as a group of
people committed to him, supporting him,''said Rep. Esteban Torres,
D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are his friends, and we're going to stand by him to the
end,'' Torres said. ``No matter what, we stand with the president
to the end.''
</P>
<P>
   The president later attended an East Room event marking the
second anniversary of his signing into law a welfare reform
measure. As Clinton wrapped up his remarks, the Marine Corps band
struck up a patriotic tune, drowning out reporters' questions until
the president left the room.
</P>
<P>
   As part of Paula Jones' sexual harassment lawsuit against
Clinton, both he and Lewinsky denied under oath engaging in sex.
Clinton later said publicly he never encouraged anyone to lie.
</P>
<P>
   Early last week, Lewinsky struck a deal with Starr to avoid
prosecution in return for testifying before the grand jury. As part
of the deal, Lewinsky said she would provide details of a sexual
relationship with Clinton and how they discussed ways to keep it
secret.
</P>
<P>
   To bolster her story, Lewinsky provided Starr's investigators
with a blue cocktail dress, which is undergoing DNA testing by the
FBI to determine whether it contains evidence of sexual contact
with Clinton.

`DEAD HEART': WORLDS COLLIDE UNDER A MERCILESS AUSTRALIAN SUN
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Aug. 9.)  
(jw) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In the opening scene of Nicholas Parsons' film ``Dead Heart,''
two aborigines emerge from the blazing Australian desert to join
Poppy, an elder, for a few hands of poker in the nonexistent shade
of a scraggly little tree. Cards are shuffled and the talk turns to
aboriginal ways of dealing with wrongdoers. In one tale a person's
ribs are pulled apart and his heart taken; in another an arm is
removed and sucked on. Then Poppy tells them the story of Wala Wala
station.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons' film explores a highly charged confrontation between
white and aboriginal cultures at Wala Wala, a remote settlement in
the desert 50 miles west of Alice Springs. Two years ago, the movie
was about to disappear from art houses in Australia when discussion
of it on a Sydney talk show helped extend its run to 20 weeks. In
this country, ``Dead Heart'' received favorable reviews but
disappeared quickly, in the manner of many good little films.
</P>
<P>
   Now it is back on a videotape from Fox Lorber. ``Filled with
murder, infidelity and racism ... fast and sultry,'' reads a blurb
from a review on the cassette box. That has the sound of a sleeper:
a movie that may have escaped people's attention but now is ready
to deliver in a way somewhat similar to, say, ``Red Rock West,''
John Dahl's twisty little thriller set in the American desert,
which caught fire on tape in 1994.
</P>
<P>
   But the real strength of ``Dead Heart'' lies in its tangling of
aboriginal ways with the strictures of Wala Wala's pressured white
contingent, dispatched to the settlement to observe, teach and, to
the extent it can in a world it little understands, to supervise.
By isolating whites and aborigines in the desert, the film has both
the space and time to establish a little laboratory of cultural
incompatibility.
</P>
<P>
   The Australian government has put Wala Wala in the hands of Ray,
the constable, a career territorial lawman depicted with rugged
honesty by Bryan Brown. But Ray is continually pressed by Poppy
(Gnarnay Yarrahe Waitaire), a shrewd and opportunistic tribal
leader who keenly feels the desire and obligation to rule his own
turf.
</P>
<P>
   Parsons explained that until only a few years ago, the white
Australian interpretation of land rights rested on the concept of
``terra nullius,'' which broadly contended that before white
settlers formed a national confederation in 1901, the great deserts
were occupied by nobody. Therefore they belonged to nobody,
including the aborigines, who according to terra nullius weren't
there to begin with.
</P>
<P>
   Obviously that's scant foundation for cultural comprehension,
especially in the desert. ``No one over 40 out there probably ever
met a white man until they were in their 20s,'' Parsons said of the
aborigines. Playing catch-up, the white civilization and its
functionaries in Wala Wala _ Ray, a schoolteacher named Les (Lewis
Fitzgerald), an anthropologist (John Jarret), an aboriginal
Protestant clergyman named David (Ernie Dingo) _ are trying hard,
too hard, to right many wrongs.
</P>
<P>
   The most idealistically insistent of these characters is the
teacher, Les, a tense, humorless man devoted to his mission. ``He
represents the so-called good in white people,'' said Brown, who
also was a co-producer. ``He believes we have to teach the
aborigines so they can enter our world.''
</P>
<P>
   Parsons' film doesn't advocate that approach at all. ``The movie
holds that people are real and caring, but there's no perfect rule
for bringing them together,'' Brown said. In this case, perhaps it
would be best to give the aborigines breathing room to exist on
their own terms. To people like Les, that's unthinkable. ``He feels
he has to give them the tools,'' Brown said, ``but to do that it
means he has to take everything away from them.''
</P>
<P>
   Poppy works the do-gooders. ``He understands the white world and
how he can play on the guilts,'' said Brown. Poppy is adept at
getting new Toyotas and the like out of authorities, but his stake
goes much deeper. ``He knows the bureaucracy is there to serve the
victim, and how you can manipulate it, but he also has a
responsibility as a tribal chief.''
</P>
<P>
   Ideally Poppy would like to get rid of Ray, who is much too
strong a figure to dismiss or subjugate. With a weaker constable,
Poppy might all but take over Wala Wala. As it stands, however,
there is not much to be done about the balance of power. Ray cuts
the aborigines as much slack as possible and works earnestly to
keep order. Poppy chafes.
</P>
<P>
   Then a mysterious death causes upheaval. ``Where they really get
into difficulty is when a crime in one culture isn't a crime in the
other,'' said Parsons. His film derives from a true story in the
1930s. Instructed by tribal elders to kill a transgressor according
to tradition, an aborigine was arrested by white authorities and
sent to prison, from which he quickly escaped. Loping 100 miles in
48 hours, he disappeared back into the desert.
</P>
<P>
   In ``Dead Heart,'' a worldly young aborigine named Tony (Ray
Pedersen) is ordered to be killed when Poppy discovers he has made
love to Les' wife, Kate (Angie Milliken), on a patch of sacred
ground, an offense that can only be punished by death. The
execution is carried out by pinching his neck in such a way that
his heart stops. No trace is left, but Ray suspects murder and an
aborigine named Tjulpu (Djunawong Stanley Mirindo) is arrested.
</P>
<P>
   David, the clergyman, points out that Tjulpu, coming from a
culture in which killing is prescribed in certain situations,
doesn't comprehend the white man's notion of murder. Ray is willing
to bend the law for the aborigines in most circumstances but can't
bring himself to in this instance.
</P>
<P>
   But before he can be tried, Tjulpu is sprung from Ray's jail by
Poppy's agents, who take him into the desert. Ray follows, leading
to a violent confrontation and a crisis at Wala Wala. Suffice it to
say that cross-cultural fertilization will need rethinking. Poppy
drives off in his new Toyota.

A JIGSAW PUZZLE INTERLOCKING LAYERS OF SPACE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9.)
</HEADLINE>
 
(Attn: Ohio)  (af) 
By HERBERT MUSCHAMP   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Zaha Hadid's design for the Contemporary Arts Center in
Cincinnati won't be officially unveiled until this October, but
surely I'm not the only one impatient for a preview. And in fact
the design is already far enough along to praise Cincinnati for
giving this remarkable architect her first commission in the United
States.
</P>
<P>
   It's a breakthrough design in the use of space to punch up
contemporary art. Jean Gardner, the environmentalist and historian
of New York City parks, believes that computers are transforming
contemporary conceptions of space as radically as the innovations
of Alberti and Brunelleschi changed space in the Renaissance.
Computer technology enables people to occupy several spaces at one
time.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hadid goes far toward imagining how such a shift in spatial
cognition might affect architecture. Overlapping, interpenetrating
space has been a major theme of modern architecture throughout this
century. It is evident in works as formally diverse as those by
Frank Lloyd Wright, Paul Rudolph and Peter Eisenman. But no design
has developed this theme with as much complexity as Ms. Hadid's new
project.
</P>
<P>
   The Cincinnati center is situated downtown (at Sixth and Walnut
Streets) and will function as a Kunsthalle: there will be no
permanent collection, only temporary shows.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hadid's best-known work, the fire station at the
headquarters of the furniture maker Vitra International in Germany,
is a strongly horizontal design, and her evocative drawings and
renderings tend to emphasize the horizontal plane. They often
depict fragmented, dartlike shapes swirling into a vortex, like a
new galaxy in formation, a mental Milky Way. It will be welcome to
see how she handles a vertical design.
</P>
<P>
   The center will be arranged on 10 levels (including basement
spaces containing an auditorium and cafe) that alternate between
full floors and mezzanines. Even the full floors, however, are
punctuated with jagged openings that will allow space (and light)
to flow vertically through the building _ shades of Gordon
Matta-Clark, the wild and crazy sculptor who altered existing
buildings by cutting them up with a buzz saw.
</P>
<P>
   The design's perpendicular ascent actually begins outside the
building with a feature Ms. Hadid calls the urban carpet. This is a
gently sloping floor-plane that begins on the sidewalk, continues
through the lobby, gradually rising to a level four feet above
ground level and then makes an abrupt curve upward that flows into
the wall opposite the entrance.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hadid describes this as a kind of urban park. A slope of
anticipation, it re-interprets the grand stairs of the traditional
museum.
</P>
<P>
   Offices and galleries on the upper floors are contained within a
sculptured, rectangular volume suspended from the building's
concrete structural framework. The hovering effect will recall the
ziggurat facade of Marcel Breuer's design for the Whitney, though
the translucency of Ms. Hadid's facades and the colors playing
through will make for a less weighty-looking mass.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hadid hasn't settled on a final design for the center's two
facades, though her preliminary versions suggest that it will be
composed of projecting and receding cubes and rectangular frames.
These geometric forms, loosely corresponding to spaces and levels
inside, can be seen as abstract shapes in themselves or as
representations of abstraction, like the street grid of Cincinnati,
or the luminous rectangles and squares of paintings by Rothko,
Hofmann or Klee.
</P>
<P>
   The most spectacular of the center's features is an immense
staircase, a shallow, ramplike incline that extends nearly the full
length of the building, zigzagging from the lobby floor up through
seven gallery levels. This vertical stack of pedestrian switchbacks
provides visual as well as physical access to all the galleries,
creating vistas even more startling than those seen across the New
York Guggenheim's rotunda as one proceeds up or down the ramp.
</P>
<P>
   (The concept may owe something to Ms. Hadid's stunning
transformation of the rotunda in 1992 for the Guggenheim's show on
the Russian avant-garde.)
</P>
<P>
   The effect could be as arresting as peering into a building in
construction. Or better, passing one that's being torn down, where
a demolished wall exposes little cells of private history to the
public eye. (Such sites in Paris were one of Mondrian's earliest
inspirations.)
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Hadid herself describes the interior spaces as pieces of a
jigsaw puzzle, but because the pieces are three-dimensional, the
result will be an ever-shifting, multiperspectival composition in
space.
</P>
<P>
   Actually, the center will be a construction and demolition site
on a continuing basis. Philosophically, it is rooted in Klee's idea
that an artwork is to be experienced as a process of creation, not
just a product. It's expected that artists will be asked to create
works specifically for the place, even to reshape its spaces.
</P>
<P>
   In this sense, Ms. Hadid's design invites comparison to Frank
Gehry's Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain. One of the remarkable
things about Bilbao was the positive reception it received from
artists. Their enthusiasm contrasted sharply with the protests many
artists lodged against Wright's design for the Guggenheim in New
York. Interactivity with environments is something to which many
artists now aspire.
</P>
<P>
   This commission was good news for architecture as well as for
Ms. Hadid. If an edict were to be passed prohibiting Don DeLillo,
Laurie Anderson and Spike Lee from writing, performing and making
movies, outrage would be heard. Unfairly deprived of several
previous projects, Ms. Hadid, who was born in 1950, is one of the
true talents of her generation. She needs buildings to test and
develop her ideas.
</P>
<P>
   Having commissioned recent projects by Eisenman, Harry Cobb and
Michael Graves, the University of Cincinnati has already made the
city a center for distinctive architecture. But the art center is
the most important new building downtown.
</P>
<P>
   In this historically rich context, Ms. Hadid's fiercely
contemporary design shows that in an urban setting you can be in
more than one time at one place.

JEWELRY MADE BY A TIFFANY WHO CHOSE A LIFE OF ART  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9.) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)

<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ For thousands of tourists who wander into Tiffany &AMP;
Co. on Fifth Avenue this summer to gape at jewelry designed by Elsa
Peretti, Paloma Picasso and Jean Schlumberger, there's a surprise
in store. Interspersed among the showcases on the second floor are
34 pieces of jewelry designed by the founder's son, Louis Comfort
Tiffany.
</P>
<P>
   Although he collaborated with his father, Charles Lewis Tiffany,
on several pieces for the 1900 Universal Exposition in Paris, the
younger Tiffany really began designing jewelry only after his
father's death in 1902, when he became vice president and artistic
director of the company.
</P>
<P>
   By then, the son had long been famous for creating lavish,
exotic interiors and for designing stained glass, Favrile glass in
fluid colors, mosaics, ecclesiastical furnishings and enamel work.
At the 1893 World's Columbian Exposition in Chicago, he had
received 54 medals for his exhibition. He made his debut as a
jewelry designer in St. Louis at the Louisiana Purchase Exposition
of 1904. Even today, many people are not aware of his
accomplishments as a jewelry designer.
</P>
<P>
   Louis Tiffany's jewelry reveals the richness and sense of
fantasy that characterized his earlier design work; each piece is a
microcosm of what he achieved on a grander scale in the decorative
arts.
</P>
<P>
   The pieces on view at Tiffany _ in an exhibition called ``The
Jewelry of Louis Comfort Tiffany: Explorations of Color, Nature and
the Exotic,'' which closes on Aug. 29 _ celebrate not only his
jewelry designs but also the 150th anniversary of his birth.
</P>
<P>
   So does a more comprehensive show called ``Louis Comfort Tiffany
at the Metropolitan Museum of Art.'' The jewelry on display at the
Met, through Jan. 31, is tucked away in a small pavilion of a
gallery. And being able to see these delicate and intricate pieces
isolated in such a way heightens one's appreciation of them.
</P>
<P>
   Like the designs of Rene Lalique, his contemporary in France,
Tiffany's jewelry reflected the natural world in the fluid forms of
Art Nouveau while retaining a distinctly American quality. Even in
the exotic pieces influenced by his travels to the Middle East and
North Africa, there was an unmistakably modern sensibility that
appealed to his American clients.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tiffany art jewelry was considered fashion forward in its day
and was worn by women artists, opera singers and the wives of
entrepreneurs,'' explained Annamarie Sandecki, Tiffany's archivist,
who organized its exhibition. ``It was designed at the height of
American dress reform, when women wore the colorful brooches to set
off shirtwaist dresses at the office or tea gowns in the late
afternoon.''
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany, working with his gemologist, George Frederick Kuntz,
discovered in natural stones, particularly those from American
sources, the same quality of color that had become a hallmark of
his stained glass. One glittering example is the ``Peasant''
necklace that Ms. Sandecki said was a style worn originally by
Roman slaves and eventually by peasants in 18th-century Normandy.
</P>
<P>
   While its central moonstone came from Ceylon, it is set with
Montana sapphires of the richest blue imaginable. A similar
necklace at the Met, made for Susan Dwight, adds to this same
combination intricate scrolls, both twisted into and engraved on
the platinum mountings.
</P>
<P>
   Tiffany's popular grape motif is beautifully represented by
another necklace at the Met. With opal grapes and enameled green
leaves clustered around a central, asymmetrical opal, it reveals
the same gradations of blues and greens that can be seen in his
Favrile glass.
</P>
<P>
   Always depicted in a naturalistic way, the leaves are tinged
with yellow and brown to signal an overripe vine at season's end. A
more stylized version is found at Tiffany in the ``Bib'' necklace
based on Mughal court jewelry. Its jade plaques and amethyst drops
and flowers linked by thin gold twisted wires suggest a ripening
grapevine.
</P>
<P>
   But the evolution of Tiffany's ideas can best be traced in the
brooches on display at the store. From the early period, the
berries in the ``Bittersweet'' brooch are made from mottled Mexican
fire opals, and an Australian black opal in the ``Mughal'' brooch
captures the iridescence of peacock feathers, a favorite theme.
</P>
<P>
   But nothing looks more New York chic than his ``Filigree''
brooch from 1933, the year he died. Its symmetrical setting of
diamonds and pearls is surrounded by a tangle of platinum vines.
</P>
<P>
   For American women who shunned the European custom of wearing
tiaras on formal occasions, a hair ornament by Tiffany offered
panache of the same sort. One such ornament at the Met is composed
of two dragonflies poised on two dandelion puffs, with one already
half blown away.
</P>
<P>
   The dragonflies are made of graduated opals with green demantoid
garnets for eyes and metal filigree for the fluttering wings. The
seed balls are spheres of platinum strands with dots of white
enamel.
</P>
<P>
   ``This ornament is the most sculptural of all his pieces,'' said
Alice Cooney Frelinghuysen, the curator of the Met's exhibit. ``And
it defies any usual interpretation of jewelry.''
</P>
<P>
   One can imagine how pleased Louisine Havemeyer, its owner, must
have felt as she wore this creation when entertaining in her Fifth
Avenue mansion _ in rooms designed by Tiffany.

 &HT;    Stock market slump turns ugly
 &HT;    (EDS: Runs with DOW-SIDE)
 &HT;    By Tom Walker
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   Stock market investors suffered their worst losses in more than
nine months Tuesday as a two-week-old decline turned more severe,
with no quick end in sight.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average fell 299.43 points to 8,487.31.
The drop was its third worst one-day point loss and the sharpest
one-day decline since Oct. 27, when it fell 554 points as Asia's
financial crisis surfaced. While the Dow tumbled 3.4 percent, the
Nasdaq composite, which includes many high-technology stocks, fared
worse, losing 3.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts blame the current decline on a barrage of factors,
including slower corporate profit growth, Asia's broad ongoing
crisis, Japan's failure to reform its economy and recent
uncertainty surrounding the White House.
</P>
<P>
   But to explain Tuesday's fall, some analysts point to a forecast
by Prudential Securities analyst Ralph Acampora, who ventured that
the Dow would fall a total of 15 percent to 20 percent in the next
few months from the record of 9,337.97 reached last month.
</P>
<P>
   Acampora has been one of the most optimistic analysts on Wall
Street. At one point he predicted the Dow would top 10,000 this
year.
</P>
<P>
   The 20 percent decline he cited would take the Dow to around
7,500, or about where it was in December. Most analysts think the
Dow will not fall as low as 8,000.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow is already down 9 percent from the record it set July
17, and other averages are down even more.
</P>
<P>
   But analysts were also quick to put the slide in perspective as
a normal event.
</P>
<P>
   ``Earnings are uncertain short-term, but the long-term
environment still looks healthy,'' said Gary E. Fullam, research
director for Globalt, Atlanta-based investment advisers.
</P>
<P>
   ``Interest rates are low, inflation is low and we believe the
Asian situation will turn,'' he said.

 &HT;    Marion has designs for free safety
 &HT;    By Mark Woods
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   DAVIE, Fla. _ For the past couple years, the Miami Dolphins have
walked into their version of a living room _ you know, that
120-by-53-yard space with lush green carpeting _ and seen this ugly
hole against the far wall.
</P>
<P>
   Free safety.
</P>
<P>
   They tried Gene Atkins and Sean Hill there. They tested Shawn
Wooden there, then moved him to strong safety. They brought in
George Teague and Corey Harris. In two years, they used six
different starters. And none looked right.
</P>
<P>
   So who did they turn to in the offseason?
</P>
<P>
   Brock Marion, interior design major.
</P>
<P>
   OK, the real reason the Dolphins gave Marion, 28, a three-year,
$8.1 million deal probably has more to do with what he did after he
left the University of Nevada and became a seventh-round draft pick
in 1993 for the Dallas Cowboys and their coach, Jimmy Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   ``We wanted him because we knew what kind of player he is,''
said Bob Ackles, Dolphins director of player personnel who was at
Dallas for Marion's rookie season. ``He's a leader. He knows how to
win.''
</P>
<P>
   He also knows how to decorate a room.
</P>
<P>
   Long before Marion became the kind of football player that the
Dolphins would consider counting on to make their secondary look
better, he was studying space and colors. And we're not talking
about the Red Zone.
</P>
<P>
   His favorite class at West High School in Bakersfield, Calif.,
was drafting. He liked working with the angles. Breaking down
space. Figuring out how things fit together.
</P>
<P>
   When he got to college and realized he didn't like his first
major, engineering, he went to his counselor and said, ``I like
drafting; what can I do?''
</P>
<P>
   The counselor suggested architecture. Or maybe interior design.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once I got into it, I enjoyed it,'' he said. ``It's space
planning and decorating with colors. I've developed an eye for
color. I try to match everything, coordinate everything in everyday
life.''
</P>
<P>
   He didn't finish his degree. He figures he has two years left.
And he plans to return to school once his football career is over.
</P>
<P>
   The motivation isn't money. It's about being able to give his
three children _ all under 5 years old _ a do-your-homework
lecture.
</P>
<P>
   ``I can't sit there and preach to my kids about education if I
don't have a college degree myself,'' he said. ``You want to set an
example and say, `Daddy did it. Mommy did it. Now you have to do
it.'''
</P>
<P>
   Yes, Marion and his wife, Keri, have battles over how to
decorate their house.
</P>
<P>
   ``All the time,'' he said with a laugh. ``She's more of a
traditional, old-fashioned type of woman who likes the rich colors,
the reds and cherries. I tend to let her do what she wants to do.
Then, I tell her, `No, that's not going to go.'''
</P>
<P>
   He doesn't walk into teammates' homes and start playing Frank
Lloyd Wright. Not unless asked.
</P>
<P>
   A few years ago Cowboys defensive back Darren Woodson took him
upstairs to a game room that Woodson was putting together and asked
what he thought.
</P>
<P>
   ``I said, `Do you want my honest opinion?''' he said.
</P>
<P>
   He told Woodson to move a couch ``that just didn't go at all.''
</P>
<P>
   Marion smiles when asked about the dichotomy of football and
interior design.
</P>
<P>
   ``I look at it as once you get away from football, you've got to
have a sense of peace,'' he said. ``Football is not going to be
there the rest of my life. I could end my career at this
afternoon's practice.''
</P>
<P>
   Not that he plans to stop playing anytime soon. In fact, one of
the reasons he came to Miami was because of what he would be
working on. No carpeting. Just real grass that, he figures, should
allow his knees to last longer.
</P>
<P>
   The other reasons were the money _ ``an offer that you couldn't
refuse,'' he says _ and the chance to play for Johnson again.
</P>
<P>
   Now that Marion has made it in the NFL, you almost expect the
coach he first found him to say he knew all along this would
happen. Johnson, however, does not. He explains that when he made
Marion the 196th overall pick of the 1993 draft, he was looking at
someone who could help out on special teams.
</P>
<P>
   ``In college, he blocked something like 11 or 12 kicks,''
Johnson said. ``That was our No. 1 thought.''
</P>
<P>
   Then Kenny Gant got hurt. Gant had been part of the Cowboys'
nickel defense. Johnson decided to replace him with Marion.
</P>
<P>
   ``He made plays all over the field and never left the lineup,''
Johnson said.
</P>
<P>
   Marion became a starter in his third season, 1995, and made six
interceptions and 114 tackles. Still, when he became a restricted
free agent, the Cowboys made no effort to tie him up in a long-term
deal. They merely offered the minimum tender.
</P>
<P>
   And even after last season, when he made a career-high 158
tackles, the Cowboys showed little interest in getting in on the
bidding.
</P>
<P>
   ``When the deal was cut with Miami, they were nowhere around,''
Marion said. ``I couldn't for the life of me understand why. ... I
know I produced time and time again for Dallas. I don't have any
bitter feelings, though.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, he seems happy to be in his new home, reuinited with his
old coach in a locker room painted in orange and aqua.
</P>
<P>
   When asked about the color scheme of his new home, Marion
smiles.
</P>
<P>
   ``It flows,'' he said with a grin. ``It flows nicely.''
</P>

 &HT;    Salmonella outbreak may have caused one death, scores of
hospital treatments
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the worst food poisoning outbreaks in Alabama history has
sent more than 125 people to Birmingham hospitals and may have
caused the death Tuesday of a 35-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   The salmonella outbreak has been tied to the Beverly's Barbeque
restaurant, which catered a couple of parties this weekend attended
by many of the people who got sick. People suffering from severe
vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, fever and chills started swamping the
emergency room at Shelby (Ala.) Baptist Medical Center on Saturday,
said Dr. Darrel Weaver, the hospital's medical director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We slowly went from a trickle to a veritable flood,'' Weaver
said Tuesday. ``Now, it's slowed back down.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelby Baptist Medical Center treated 127 patients, 16 of whom
were admitted, Weaver said. Six patients received treatment
Tuesday. An unknown number of additional patients were treated at
other hospitals or by private physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak appears to be over, Weaver said
</P>
<P>
   One patient, Mitzy King, died Tuesday at 5:30 a.m. of multiple
organ failure, Weaver said. The woman, who suffered from Addison's
disease, also exhibited the same symptoms as those who contracted
salmonella, the emergency room doctor said. She was transported to
the hospital in full cardiac arrest Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said the woman's Addison's disease, a hormonal problem
characterized by anemia, weakness and low blood pressure, made it
difficult for King to combat the apparent food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she hadn't gotten this (food poisoning), she probably would
have been OK,'' Weaver said. ``For the average person, other than
having pretty bad stomach problems, they'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Alabama Department of Public Health said King may not
have died from salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we do not believe that case is associated with the
current outbreak,'' said Olga Henao, an epidemiologist with the
state health department. ``There's no specific proof that that
person ate at the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   King's aunt, Tommie Ann Edwards, said her niece ate lunch at
Beverly's Barbeque on Friday and became ill Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said lab tests on King came back negative for salmonella,
but the results may have been affected by dosages of antibiotics
she was given in the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least from this side,'' Weaver said, ``there's no question
that she was one of (the people who contracted salmonella).
</P>
<P>
   King, twice divorced, is survived by a 15-year-old daughter from
her first marriage. An uncle is mayor of Wilsonville, the small
rural community where she lived about 40 miles southeast of
Birmingham. She sang in the Wilsonville Baptist Church choir and
worked for a county environmental agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a beautiful alto voice,'' Edwards said of her niece.
``She was very talented in a lot of different areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly McKenna, owner of Beverly's Barbeque, did not answer the
telephone at her home or restaurant Tuesday. She told The
Associated Press, however, that she voluntarily closed the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people getting sick off my food,'' she said.
``I've been here 27 1/2 years, and I've never made anybody sick.''

 &HT;    Sweltering prisons get fans installed
 &HT;    By Mike Ward
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   AUSTIN, Texas _ Faced with a rash of heat-related illnesses,
Texas prison officials are installing nearly $700,000 worth of fans
to cool down convicts and guards.
</P>
<P>
   Since late May, as Texas has baked in 100-degree temperatures,
two convicts have died from heat stroke. Eleven other convicts and
10 prison employees have suffered from heat exhaustion and other
heat-related illnesses _ a record in a system where air
conditioning is the exception.
</P>
<P>
   ``The heat in some of these units is really brutal,'' said Larry
Fitzgerald, a Huntsville-based spokesman for the Texas Department
of Criminal Justice. ``Heat rises, so you can imagine how hot it is
on the third level of some of those cell runs.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials said most of the 1,884 large box-style and
freestanding fans had arrived by last Friday at the 105 prisons and
state jails, the largest such purchase of fans ever for Texas
prisons.
</P>
<P>
   The fans are being paid for with prison commissary profits, not
taxpayers' money, they said.
</P>
<P>
   Texas' prison system houses more than 143,000 convicts and has
45,000 employees.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're putting fans on the cell runs, in the dorms, dining
halls, recreation areas _ any place we can keep the air moving and
bring the temperatures down,'' said Larry Todd, an Austin spokesman
for the agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've also modified our work schedules in the fields and are
allowing inmate to wear gym shorts and T-shirts instead of their
regular uniforms in dayrooms and rec areas to make things cooler.''
</P>
<P>
   Fitzgerald and Todd said the massive fan purchase is one of
several changes in prison operations ordered in recent weeks to
combat the continuing heat wave.
</P>
<P>
   Only a few Texas prisons are air conditioned _ medical units _
along with administrative offices, infirmaries and some program
rooms in regular units.
</P>
<P>
   At the Murray prison unit in Gatesville, home to about 1,000
convicts and 400 employees, soaker hoses installed on the metal
roofs of dorms have reduced the temperatures inside by three
degrees.
</P>
<P>
   At many other prisons, metal roofs are being sprayed with water
twice a day and water misters have been installed to cool
recreation and work areas, Todd said. Lights are being kept turned
off in dorms during the daylight to further reduce the heat,
officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Containers of ice water have been stationed in prison dorms,
convicts are being allowed to shower more frequently to cool off,
and cellblock windows are being kept open to increase airflow
through the units, according to Todd.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, the schedules of work crews have been changed so
convicts work outdoors on maintenance and field chores during the
cooler daylight hours, from dawn to noon.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're monitoring the temperature on an hourly basis to ensure
there is not a problem,'' Todd said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the heat-related illnesses, two convicts died
from apparent heat strokes _ compared with none last year.
</P>
<P>
   Archie White, 48, died June 29 at an Abilene hospital after
riding for about two hours on a prison bus without air conditioning
as he was moved between units. A month earlier, Alfred Wilder, 27,
died at a Crosbyton hospital after collapsing in a prison
recreation yard while playing basketball.
</P>
<P>
   White was serving a 28-year sentence for burglary and drug
possession. Wilder was serving 15 years for burglary and several
drug-related offenses.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, prison reports show, guards have collapsed from
heat exhaustion in kitchens and corridors and convicts have taken
ill in cellblocks at 16 prison units. Most have been treated and
released from prison infirmaries.
</P>
<P>
   On June 30, a convict at the Estelle Unit near Huntsville became
ill after a bus trip. A subsequent medical exam showed his
temperature was 109 degrees, a report shows.
</P>
<P>
   Despite growing tensions between convict gangs, which have
resulted in convicts being kept locked in their cells at several
prisons in recent weeks, Todd and other prison officials said the
heat is not a factor in those problems.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's too hot to fight,'' Todd said an inmate told him.

   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Chief Justice William Rehnquist rejected a
White House request Tuesday that he shield its lawyers from
testifying, permitting prosecutors investigating President
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky to question a member of
his inner circle of advisers.
</P>
<P>
   With the many threads of Starr's six-month-old investigation
abruptly intertwining, it was also disclosed Tuesday that Ms.
Lewinsky has turned over new physical evidence to prosecutors. She
has provided them with a photograph of Clinton that he had
inscribed to her, according to a lawyer knowledgeable about the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   She submitted the photograph last week along with a navy blue
dress and tape-recorded phone messages that she said were left by
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, who met again Tuesday for several hours with
prosecutors to discuss her prospective testimony, may appear before
the grand jury as soon as Thursday. Her testimony is not likely to
take more than a day or two, according to the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for her testimony, Ms. Lewinsky has received
immunity from prosecution for any wrongdoing she testifies about,
provided she does not commit perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Special White House counsel Lanny Breuer spent the day before
the grand jury. After his testimony late Tuesday afternoon, lawyers
from the White House and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office
met for more than an hour with the presiding judge, Norma Holloway
Johnson. Invoking attorney-client privilege, White House lawyers
have repeatedly argued that Starr cannot ask about certain
conversations they have had with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington ruled last week that
attorney-client privilege could not prevent a government lawyer
from testifying in a criminal investigation. But the White House
said Tuesday that it still intended to appeal that ruling to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer has been at the center of President Clinton's
damage-control operation, processing subpoenas, gathering documents
and contacting witnesses during Starr's six-month-old
investigation. He had no comment Tuesday beyond declaring ``I'm
honored'' when asked his reaction to the hubbub surrounding his
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who met at the White House on Tuesday with his
private lawyers, is planning to testify August 17. He has no plans
to address the public about his testimony or his relationship with
Ms. Lewinsky before then, aides said Tuesday, but he may do so
afterwards. ``It's not on the drawing board,'' one Clinton adviser
said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starr used a separate grand jury Tuesday to continue taking
testimony from Secret Service officers. Just three weeks ago,
Rehnquist rejected an urgent White House appeal that he block
testimony by the Secret Service. Tuesday, he did not publicly
explain his decision, issued at about 9 a.m., to permit Breuer's
testimony to go forward. The White House had wanted him to block
testimony by Breuer and other lawyers until the full Supreme Court
considered its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For the White House, it was one more judicial setback in its
effort to establish presidential prerogatives and deflect Starr's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over attorney-client privilege arose from prosecutors'
efforts to compel complete testimony from deputy White House
counsel Bruce Lindsey, the president's closest aide. Lindsey balked
at answering certain questions, invoking the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, who had back surgery last week, is still resting and
unable to testify, White House officials said. They said they
anticipate that Starr will seek to question other members of the
independent counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, White House advisers continued to question reporters
about what they had learned about forensic tests on the navy blue
dress that Ms. Lewinsky turned over to prosecutors. Scientists at
the FBI crime laboratory have performed tests to determine whether
a stain on the dress was caused by semen, but the results are being
held under tight security. Starr is trying to learn whether the
dress was stained in a sexual encounter with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president testified in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual
misconduct suit that he did not have a sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. He has also denied trying to cover up such a
relationship, another accusation that Starr is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The White House continued to receive reassuring news Tuesday on
public opinion of the investigation. After the extraordinary
developments recently _ including Ms. Lewinsky's deal with
prosecutors and Clinton's decision to testify _ only 29 percent of
Americans surveyed late last week and into the weekend said that
they were following news of the investigation ``very closely.'' The
result was statistically indistinguishable from responses to the
same question in June and April.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction is no reaction,'' said Andrew Kohut, the director
of the Pew Research Center for the People and The Press, which
conducted the survey. ``It's incredible to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of those surveyed said that they would be
satisfied to end the matter if Clinton were to acknowledge an
affair with Ms. Lewinsky and say he lied about it to protect his
family. The poll of 1,189 adults had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said that Clinton has no plan and no reason to
back away from his denials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been solicitous in recent days of his support within
the Democratic Party. Monday, he attacked congressional Republicans
over their budget proposal, and Tuesday he met at the White House
with about a dozen Hispanic lawmakers. Tuesday night, he was the
star attraction at $300,000 fund-raiser to benefit Rep. Maxine
Waters, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Clinton is scheduled to travel to Capitol Hill to sit
down with the House Democratic caucus. The White House
characterized the visit as a routine meeting to discuss the party's
agenda for the remainder of the congressional session. But some
Democrats may choose to bring up the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they will bring up with him,'' said Barry
Toiv, a White House spokesman. ``I mean, presumably, they'll have
some give-and-take and that will be up to them.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ As the stock market swooned Tuesday, Ron Reuss, chief
economist at Piper Jaffray, felt vindicated.
</P>
<P>
   Last November, he was an outsider among his fellow economists in
predicting that the domestic economy would slow drastically this
year. When most were forecasting double-digit growth in corporate
earnings for the second quarter, believing the impact of the Asian
crisis would be only a first-quarter blip, Reuss anticipated that
earnings growth would fall in a 4 percent to 6 percent range.
</P>
<P>
   Now companies are reporting second-quarter earnings in line with
his forecasts, and Wall Street is bracing for further weakness with
the negative effects of Asia expected to be felt at least into the
third quarter.
</P>
<P>
   ``My bearish forecast is finally coming to fruition,'' said
Reuss, who expects the U.S. economy to roll into a recession in the
fourth quarter, even though the gross domestic product has so far
outpaced his forecast this year.
</P>
<P>
   Investors dumped shares Tuesday, pushing major market indexes
down more than 3 percent and nearly 10 percent off their peaks,
which typically signals a correction.
</P>
<P>
   In its worst decline this year, the Dow Jones industrial average
plunged 299.43 points, or 3.4 percent, to at 8,487.31, its lowest
finish since early March. It was the third-largest point decline in
the history of the blue-chip average. Volume of more than 834
million shares on the New York Stock Exchange was the
second-largest ever, after the 1.2 billion shares traded on Oct.
28.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of the losses, led by declines in IBM, J.P. Morgan
and General Electric, the Dow is now 9.1 percent below its July 17
peak of 9,337.97 and is up just 7.3 percent this year; it had been
up more than 18 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index dived 40.32 points, or 3.6
percent. It is down 9.7 percent from its high set on July 17 of
1,196.75.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, laden with technology shares that
led Tuesday's slide _ just as they had often been at the forefront
of this year's bull market _ fell 65.46, or 3.54 percent, to
1,785.64, its lowest level since June 19.
</P>
<P>
   The losses in such bellwether issues as Microsoft, off 3 15/16
to 104{; Intel, down 2~ to 81 15/16, and Cisco Systems, down 3] to
93[, mean the Nasdaq has suffered a correction; it is down 11.3
percent from its year's high.In the telecommunications sector,
Worldcom fell 3 7/16 points to 48 7/16. MCI fell 4 1/2 points to
59, and Lucent fell 4 points to 97.
</P>
<P>
   Behind the heavy selloff, analysts said, was distress about the
outlook for corporate earnings and for Asian economies, especially
Japan's. Some even forecast that the Dow could fall further _ as
much as 20 percent _ before resuming its climb.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some folks have been calling for this correction for awhile,''
said Charles Johnson, head of equity trading at Blaylock &AMP; Partners
in Baltimore. ``This is good for the market. It's healthy because
it makes people become cautious again,'' he added. ``There's been
this idea that this market can only go up. Now people will be more
selective about what they buy.''
</P>
<P>
   Investors are unlikely to regain confidence in the market
immediately, said Thomas Galvin, chief investment officer at
Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette. ``We are in this information void
period,'' he said, until there is news from Japan or a new round of
corporate earnings reports in September.
</P>
<P>
   While Galvin and many strategists expect a rebound then, Reuss
remains pessimistic. ``I don't see a rebound in the third and
fourth quarter,'' he said. ``The critical issue is the consumer''
and many ``are spending beyond their means.'' Their buying has been
a vital engine for economic growth, he added. but many will soon be
forced to curb their spending and pay down debt, so the economy
will stall.
</P>
<P>
   Financial stocks were also hard hit in Tuesday's selloff. The
S&AMP;P financial index fell 4.9 percent, just trailing the Nasdaq
telecommunications index, which fell more than 5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Among leading financial shares, Citicorp fell 9 points to 154.
Chase Manhattan fell 5 3/16 to 69| and J.P. Morgan fell 5} points
to 116~. In addition, small company shares continued to take it on
the chin. The Russell index of 2,000 smaller company stocks was
down 11.7 points, of 2.8 percent, to 401.63. The index is down 8.1
percent this year.

HOSPITAL GROUP CITES OTHER BABY SWITCHES AND ABDUCTIONS 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ill., Mo., Va.)  (Sidebar with SWITCHED-BABIES, moved in `a' news file)

 By PETER T. KILBORN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Despite sophisticated systems to keep mothers and
their newborn babies together, the nation's leading hospital
accreditation organization said Tuesday that it had recorded three
instances of maternity ward baby switches and seven abductions in
the last four months.
</P>
<P>
   One of the switches was announced last week when Paula Johnson
of Ruckersville, Va., learned that she was not the biological
mother of the daughter she had assumed was hers, 3-year-old Callie
Marie. Ms. Johnson's daughter, Rebecca, was being raised by two
parents who died July 4 in a car accident.
</P>
<P>
   Hospitals routinely use triple and sometimes quadruple
identification bands to insure that a baby is not separated from
its mother. Some hospitals also have devised elaborate security
alarm systems to alert staff members when babies are moved from the
maternity section.
</P>
<P>
   Since April, the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations, based in Chicago, has been asking the 5,100
hospitals it monitors to voluntarily report incidents where babies
were switched. It also began tracking switches reported by other
means, typically in newspapers.
</P>
<P>
   Spokeswoman Cathy Barry said the commission was bound by
confidentiality agreements not to disclose the hospitals where the
recent switches were discovered, other than the University of
Virginia Medical Center in Charlottesville, which acknowledged
sending Rebecca and Callie home with the wrong parents.
</P>
<P>
   Another organization, the National Center for Missing and
Exploited Children, in Arlington, Va., said it had recorded 101
instances of abductions of infants from hospitals since 1983. In
the context of the 4 million babies born nationwide each year, said
Cathy Nahirny, senior analyst at the center, ``those numbers are
very low.''
</P>
<P>
   Elaborate banding systems similar to those at the University of
Virginia hospital are widely used to prevent baby switches and
abductions, hospital officials say.
</P>
<P>
   ``When a baby is born,'' said Marcia Patterson, director of
obstetric services at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke's Medical Center
in Chicago, ``the mother and baby are banded at delivery. The bands
come in three parts that you pull apart, all with a unique
number.'' In each part, a delivery room nurse inserts the mother's
name and medical record number, the baby's sex, the time of birth
and the name of the physician.
</P>
<P>
   Two of the three identical bands are attached to a wrist and an
ankle on the baby, and a third is attached to a wrist on the
mother. When the baby is discharged, the hospital attaches one of
the baby's bands to its footprint and medical record.
</P>
<P>
   St. Luke's-Shawnee Mission Health System, based in Kansas City,
Mo., which operates seven area hospitals where 7,000 babies are
born a year, often makes a fourth band for the father, so he can
take the baby from the nursery to the mother. St. Luke's also has
devised a security system for the nursery.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our unit is secured by an electronic perimeter,'' said Ann
Ropp, vice president of women's and children's services for the St.
Luke's system. ``The baby wears a small sensor device that sets off
an alarm and automatically locks all access to the unit.''

MARKET DROPS 299.43 AS ASIAN CRISIS HITS PROFITS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By PETER G. GOSSELIN   
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The stock market suffered its sharpest decline of the
year Tuesday, with the Dow Jones industrial average tumbling nearly
300 points as investors seemed to conclude that Corporate America
can't keep making ever-larger profits.
</P>
<P>
   The decline was the largest drop since last October's rout and
the third-largest one-day point drop ever. But in percentage terms,
it trailed the record by a substantial margin.
</P>
<P>
   The 30-stock Dow fell 299.43 points, or 3.4 percent, to close at
8487.31, extending two weeks of losses that have wiped out its
summer gains. Broader market indexes fell even more abruptly. Some
828 million shares changed hands on the New York Stock Exchange in
its second busiest day ever.
</P>
<P>
   Analysts cited the usual suspects _ the continuing Asian crisis,
for example _ to account for the drop, but said the best
explanation may be that investors are getting cold feet over the
wildly optimistic profit assumptions they made in buying stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``We still have the positives of low inflation, low interest
rates and reasonable growth,'' said Mickey Levy, chief economist
for Nationsbanc Montgomery Securities in New York. ``Investors just
got ahead of themselves with their profit expectations.''
</P>
<P>
   The Dow has lost nine percent of its value since peaking July
17, and is now up only seven percent since January _
</P>
<P>
   a modest increase compared to the 30-percent annual gains that
investors have grown accustomed to during the recent boom years.
 &UR;  &LR; Other market measures have followed suit. The Standard &AMP; Poor 500
fell 40.32 points, or 3.6 percent, Tuesday to close at 1072.12. It
is off almost 10 percent from its mid-July peak, and is up only
about 10.5 percent on the year. The technology-laden Nasdaq
Composite Index dropped 65.46 points, or 3.5 percent, Tuesday to
close at 1785.64. It is off almost 12 percent from its peak, and up
13.7 percent from the star of the year.
</P>
<P>
   Traders were shaken Tuesday when one of the market's sunniest
forcasters, Ralph Acampora of Prudential Securities, suddenly
switched from bull to bear. Acampora, who made news earlier this
year by predicting that the Dow would top 10,000, announced that he
had changed his mind.
</P>
<P>
   He said the Asian crisis and ongoing profit problems could cause
the Dow to fall &UR;  &LR; as much as much as 20 percent from its highs, a
decline that would send the average back below 7500.
</P>
<P>
   ``After being bullish for three and a half years, I'm in the
bear camp,'' Acampora told a television interviewer.
</P>
<P>
   Most of Tuesday's selloff seemed traceable to nagging doubts
about the durability of the long bull market. Analysts have noted
with growing frequency in recent days that major market measures
like the Dow may be masking the true state of the market because
their levels are being held up, or their declines minimized, by the
strong performance of only handful of large stocks.
</P>
<P>
   ``The average stock is down 30 percent off its 52-week high,
you're not seeing it in the indexes,'' said Anthony F. Dwyer, chief
markets strategist for Ladenburg Thalmann &AMP; Co. Inc. in New York.
</P>
<P>
   At least in part, analysts said the trend reflects growing
doubts among investors whether most companies will be able to
continue boositng profits, which have been a key ingredient to th
market's climb in recent years. Some of those doubts are the result
of the Asian crisis, which is hurting US firms that export to the
region. But analysts say that investors are selling the stocks of
many firms that have little or nothing to do with Asia, a sign of
more general fears about corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   So far this year, profits for the companies in the Standard &AMP;
Poor's 500 index have grown between three and four percent a
quarter, according to Charles L. Hill, research director of First
Call Corp. in Boston -- an increase to be sure, but nothing
compared to the 15.7 percent average that they have posted over the
last six years, he said.
</P>
<P>
   ``With stock prices at the levels they are at, there is not much
room for disappointment,'' said Hill. With profit growth weakening,
he added, ``some people are beginning to say: `Hey maybe I
shouldn't be paying these record valuations.'
</P>
<P>
   Twenty-nine of the 30 stocks in the Dow average declined during
Tuesday's selloff, with only Proctor &AMP; Gamble Co. rising. Among the
biggest losers were IBM, whose shares fell 5 15/16 to 126 13/16,
and Goodyear Tire &AMP; Rubber Co, whose stock price dropped 3 13/16 to
56 7/8.
</P>
<P>
   The market opened Tuesday to a rally, with the Dow average
jumping 70 points on news that Japanese Finance Minster Kiichi
Miyazawa promised tax cuts to spur that country's stalled economy.
But the gains quickly vanished after US Deputy Treasury Secretary
Lawrence Summers warned that Asia has ``a long way to go'' to work
out its economic problems.
</P>
<P>
   And with that, the market returned to its profit worries and was
soon in a steep tumble.

SURPRISE RULING ON GAY ISSUE MAY DIVIDE ANGLICAN BISHOPS 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By RICHARD VARA 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CANTERBURY, England _ The unity of the Anglican Communion may be
at stake Wednesday, when bishops take up the explosive issue of
church blessings of same-sex unions and the ordination of
practicing homosexuals.
</P>
<P>
   Confusion pervaded the Lambeth Conference, the worldwide
assembly of 750 bishops, on Tuesday after a decidedly conservative
revision of a sexual morality resolution was ruled out of order by
a steering committee headed by Archbishop of Canterbury George
Carey.
</P>
<P>
   The surprise ruling fueled tension between liberal and
conservative bishops. Insiders said their polarization could
fragment the communion, a confederation of 35 national churches
with 70 million members.
</P>
<P>
   The communion includes the Episcopal Church with 2.2 million
members in the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The ruling angered the 52-member bishop subcommittee that
hammered out the revision Monday after two weeks of meetings in an
attempt to blunt support for more strongly worded resolutions
condemning homosexuality.
</P>
<P>
   The original resolution did not address homosexuality. The
revision opposed ordaining gays as clergy or blessing same-sex
unions. It stated, however, that homosexuals ``are loved by God and
that all baptized, believing and faithful persons, regardless of
sexual orientation, are full members of the body of Christ.'' &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; The steering committee's decision, which was announced Tuesday,
in effect undid the work of the subcomittee.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was appalled that all of that work was so easily
dismissed,'' said Bishop Catherine Raskom of New York, a
subcommittee member.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop David Crawley of Canada, also a subcommittee member, said
the decision undid a mood of charity and understanding that the
bishops had worked to create. ``It's going to make matters worse,''
he said.
</P>
<P>
   Jim Rosenthal, director of conference communications, said the
steering committee did not support the more conservative
resolution, because the alteration was too sweeping. The steering
committee's meeting was private.
</P>
<P>
   Despite Tuesday's action, the subcommittee, which includes
liberal, moderate and conservative bishops from around the world,
intends to reintroduce its proposal Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   The panel hopes its statement will lead to the withdrawal of
more condemnatory resolutions, including one from Africa that calls
upon practicing homosexuals and the bishops who ordain them to
repent.
</P>
<P>
   Several statements were discussed Tuesday. The principal
difference among them was the degree to which they condemned
homosexual practices. One resolution, for example, described
homosexuality as one of many sins condemned by Scripture and warned
that support of gay rights in the church would lead to
``evangelical suicide.''
</P>
<P>
   Communion traditionalists have warned that a schism could result
unless a clear statement emerges from the conference.
</P>
<P>
   Gay-rights proponents have said, however, that liberal bishops
and priests in the United States and other countries will continue
to ordain gays and to bless same-sex couples. &UR;
</P>
<P>
   &LR; Kim Byham of Integrity, a gay-rights lobby group, said that
conference resolutions are merely advisory. About half of the 101
U.S. dioceses either openly or discreetly ordain gays and bless
homosexual couples, he said.
</P>
<P>
   Still, gay-rights groups oppose compromise measures. ``Anything
that suggests our churches are less than fully open to membership
of gay and lesbian people gives a very bad message,'' Byham said.
</P>
<P>
   Bishop Paul Barnett of Australia warned that continuing gay
ordinations and same-sex blessings could fracture the communion.
</P>
<P>
   ``It will lead to serious disruption, if not division, in the
communion,'' Barnett said. ``The unity and future of the Anglican
Communion depends on this advice being heeded.''
</P>
<P>
   The subcommittee's resolution has the support of Bishop Claude
Payne of the Diocese of Texas.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is an expression of my own personal views,'' Payne said.
``I like it, because it calls for pastoral sensitivity to all
people, which is our calling in the Gospel.''

   &UR; George Stephanopoulos &LR; , who had hired ghostwriter  &UR; William &LR; 
 &UR; Novak &LR;  to help him write a memoir about his years as White House
assistant to  &UR; Bill Clinton &LR; , has decided that his story is so
personal he needs to do the job by himself. The latest issue of The
New Yorker describes the former ``sociable political operative'' as
a ``lonelier'' man than he used to be, holed up with his computer
in his  &UR; Ralph Lauren &LR; -designed apartment in New York.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos, who received a $2.85 million advance from
Little, Brown for ``All Too Human,'' says he will reveal personal
details about Clinton as well as his own reflections on unknowingly
giving the public false information.
</P>
<P>
   Stephanopoulos told the magazine that the  &UR; Monica Lewinsky &LR; 
scandal is ``not just sex. ... It's what you sacrifice for the
privilege of being president. It's a breach of trust. ... It's the
presumption, the taking of advantage.''

NOTHING BUT NEWER WORKS: A FANTASY SEASON  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9.) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By PAUL GRIFFITHS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   A short while ago, I suggested that an orchestra could operate
for 10 years playing only music written during the last three
decades. That claim was meant to indicate how much excellent music
has been composed during this time, not to put forward a real
proposal for orchestral planning.
</P>
<P>
   For one thing, homogeneous programs are generally less
interesting than mixed ones, which can put a new or recent piece
into a useful perspective. To hear Elliott Carter in the company of
Bach, say, or Steve Reich alongside Stravinsky, will shed light not
only on the newer music but also on the older.
</P>
<P>
   Still, reasonably enough, my suggestion led to the counterclaim
that any orchestra playing only music of the last 30 years would
soon run out of decent repertory. This seemed to represent a
challenge, so here is the schedule for a first season.
</P>
<P>
   To make the point about variety as strongly as possible, no work
_ indeed, no composer _ appears twice, whereas in the real world
one might well want to play a piece twice in a season or put
together a whole concert of one composer's works. A further
limitation is that the composers have generally been chosen from
among the better known.
</P>
<P>
   (This is, after all, only the first season.) And to play fair,
there are no new commissions, and therefore no purely imaginary
works. The schedule takes little account of practical
considerations, like how rehearsals could be arranged or who would
conduct 61 works by 61 different late-20th-century composers in the
space of a few months. After all, this is not going to happen.
</P>
<P>
   Even the impossible has to start somewhere, though, so maybe
opening night could visit two countries that are linguistically
related but musically contrasted: Finland and Estonia. The program
starts with Kaija Saariaho's ``Verblendungen,'' for orchestra and
electronics, goes on to Arvo Part's Vivaldi dream ``Tabula Rasa''
and ends with Magnus Lindberg's monumental ``Kraft.''
</P>
<P>
   Program 2 offers another contrast, between two works of 1971:
Dmitri Shostakovich's last symphony (No. 15) and Karlheinz
Stockhausen's dramatic ``Trans,'' for which the strings are seen
bathed in violet light while the sounds of wind groups and a
recorded loom shuttle are projected by loudspeakers.
</P>
<P>
   The third program juxtaposes two divergent contemporaries,
composers born on consecutive days in December 1908: Elliott
Carter's Symphony of Three Orchestras is followed by Olivier
Messiaen's ``Eclairs sur l'Au-Dela.'' Program 4 puts a piece by
Gyorgy Ligeti written for America, ``San Francisco Polyphony,'' in
the company of American composers he admires: Steve Reich (``The
Four Sections'') and Conlon Nancarrow (Study for Chamber
Orchestra).
</P>
<P>
   And Program 5 assembles works by four Americans born in the
second decade of the century: Leonard Bernstein's ``Dybbuk'' Suite,
John Cage's ``58,'' Milton Babbitt's Piano Concerto No. 2 and Leon
Kirchner's Music for Cello and Orchestra.
</P>
<P>
   In Program 6 comes music from Poland, by Tadeusz Baird
(``Psychodrama''), Henryk Gorecki (Symphony No. 2) and Witold
Lutoslawski (Symphony No. 3). Program 7 presents works with novel
orchestral placements: Augusta Read Thomas' ``Orbital Beacons,''
Simon Bainbridge's Fantasia for Two Orchestras and Luigi Nono's
``No Hay Caminos, Hay Que Caminar,'' for seven groups. And Program
8 looks at Americans born in the 1920s: Jacob Druckman (``Prism,''
perhaps), Earl Kim, Lukas Foss and Ned Rorem.
</P>
<P>
   Program 9 presents three English composers who were students
together in the 1950s: Peter Maxwell Davies (``St. Thomas Wake''),
Alexander Goehr (Piano Concerto) and Harrison Birtwistle (``The
Triumph of Time''). Program 10 offers music from Switzerland: Klaus
Huber's ``Inwendig Voller Figur,'' with chorus and tape, Frank
Martin's ``Maria-Triptychon,'' with soprano and violin soloists,
and Heinz Holliger's ``(S)irato.''
</P>
<P>
   Program 11 turns to France for Henri Dutilleux's ``Timbres,
Espace, Mouvement'' and Jean Barraque's oratoriolike ``Le Temps
Restitue.''
</P>
<P>
   American multiple concertos make up the 12th program: Mel
Powell's Double Piano Concerto, Donald Martino's Triple Concerto,
for diverse clarinets, and Roger Sessions' Double Concerto, for
violin and cello.
</P>
<P>
   In Program 13 come works by two composers born in Argentina: one
who stayed (Alberto Ginastera, perhaps represented by his ``Popol
Vuh'') and one who left (Mauricio Kagel, whose
``Sankt-Bach-Passion'' is typically provocative and also serious
about Bach's place in our minds).
</P>
<P>
   Program 14 presents music from or about Japan: Claude Vivier's
``Zinpangu,'' David Lumsdaine's ``Hagoromo'' and Toru Takemitsu's
``From Me Flows What You Call Time.'' Program 15 consists entirely
of symphonies, by Hans Werner Henze (No. 7), Per Norgard (No. 4)
and Luciano Berio (``Sinfonia'').
</P>
<P>
   The 16th program has music composed in response to visual art:
Bernd Alois Zimmermann's ``Photoptosis,'' after a luminous yellow
panel by Josef Albers; Judith Weir's ``Isti Mirant Stella,'' after
an image in a medieval embroidery; Brian Ferneyhough's ``Carceri
d'Invenzione III,'' after Piranesi's etchings, and Tan Dun's
``Death and Fire,'' after Paul Klee.
</P>
<P>
   For Program 17 the subject is rituals. Iannis Xenakis' funereal
``Nekuia'' is followed by Gyorgy Kurtag's ``Grabstein fur
Stephan,'' Pierre Boulez's ``Rituel'' and Giacinto Scelsi's
``Pfhat,'' which, like the Xenakis, incorporates chorus.
</P>
<P>
   Program 18 is devoted to music from the last years of the Soviet
Union: Edison Denisov's ``Peinture,'' Alfred Schnittke's Symphony
No. 5 and Sofia Gubaidulina's violin concerto ``Offertorium.''
Program 19 is a night at the opera, beginning with John Adams
(``The Chairman Dances''), going on with selected numbers by
William Bolcom and ending with Morton Feldman's Beckett opera
``Neither,'' which could easily be staged.
</P>
<P>
   The season then closes with a selection of compositions from the
1990s that might include George Benjamin's ``Sudden Time,'' works
by Salvatore Sciarrino and Wolfgang Rihm, and Gerald Levinson's
Second Symphony. So the dream ends.

 &HT;    Salmonella outbreak may have caused one death, scores of
hospital treatments
 &HT;    (EDS: CORRECTS to Mitzi in sixth graph.)
 &HT;    By Arthur Brice
 &HT;    c. 1998 Cox News Service
<TEXT>
<P>
   One of the worst food poisoning outbreaks in Alabama history has
sent more than 125 people to Birmingham hospitals and may have
caused the death Tuesday of a 35-year-old woman.
</P>
<P>
   The salmonella outbreak has been tied to the Beverly's Barbeque
restaurant, which catered a couple of parties this weekend attended
by many of the people who got sick. People suffering from severe
vomiting, diarrhea, cramps, fever and chills started swamping the
emergency room at Shelby (Ala.) Baptist Medical Center on Saturday,
said Dr. Darrel Weaver, the hospital's medical director.
</P>
<P>
   ``We slowly went from a trickle to a veritable flood,'' Weaver
said Tuesday. ``Now, it's slowed back down.''
</P>
<P>
   Shelby Baptist Medical Center treated 127 patients, 16 of whom
were admitted, Weaver said. Six patients received treatment
Tuesday. An unknown number of additional patients were treated at
other hospitals or by private physicians.
</P>
<P>
   The outbreak appears to be over, Weaver said
</P>
<P>
   One patient, Mitzi King, died Tuesday at 5:30 a.m. of multiple
organ failure, Weaver said. The woman, who suffered from Addison's
disease, also exhibited the same symptoms as those who contracted
salmonella, the emergency room doctor said. She was transported to
the hospital in full cardiac arrest Sunday morning.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said the woman's Addison's disease, a hormonal problem
characterized by anemia, weakness and low blood pressure, made it
difficult for King to combat the apparent food poisoning.
</P>
<P>
   ``If she hadn't gotten this (food poisoning), she probably would
have been OK,'' Weaver said. ``For the average person, other than
having pretty bad stomach problems, they'll be OK.''
</P>
<P>
   But the Alabama Department of Public Health said King may not
have died from salmonella.
</P>
<P>
   ``Right now, we do not believe that case is associated with the
current outbreak,'' said Olga Henao, an epidemiologist with the
state health department. ``There's no specific proof that that
person ate at the restaurant.''
</P>
<P>
   King's aunt, Tommie Ann Edwards, said her niece ate lunch at
Beverly's Barbeque on Friday and became ill Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   Weaver said lab tests on King came back negative for salmonella,
but the results may have been affected by dosages of antibiotics
she was given in the emergency room.
</P>
<P>
   ``At least from this side,'' Weaver said, ``there's no question
that she was one of (the people who contracted salmonella).
</P>
<P>
   King, twice divorced, is survived by a 15-year-old daughter from
her first marriage. An uncle is mayor of Wilsonville, the small
rural community where she lived about 40 miles southeast of
Birmingham. She sang in the Wilsonville Baptist Church choir and
worked for a county environmental agency.
</P>
<P>
   ``She had a beautiful alto voice,'' Edwards said of her niece.
``She was very talented in a lot of different areas.''
</P>
<P>
   Beverly McKenna, owner of Beverly's Barbeque, did not answer the
telephone at her home or restaurant Tuesday. She told The
Associated Press, however, that she voluntarily closed the
restaurant.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't want people getting sick off my food,'' she said.
``I've been here 27 1/2 years, and I've never made anybody sick.

PARENTS SEEK STABILITY FOR SWITCHED BABIES 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By DAVID L. MARCUS  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va. _ The only ones who don't know are the two
little girls.
</P>
<P>
   The case of the two babies born at the University of Virginia
hospital and sent home with the wrong parents has devastated the
girls' families, jolted two small towns and confounded legal
scholars and ethicists.
</P>
<P>
   But relatives say they have managed, so far, to shield the
three-year-old girls from the questions of their older siblings,
curious neighbors and legions of reporters.
</P>
<P>
   The relatives' own feelings, though, are being broadcast to the
world _ along with the conundrum they are struggling to solve. What
does it mean to say a child is yours? Can children given to the
wrong parents be exchanged like suits that don't fit? How much does
a toddler suffer from a trauma such as this?
</P>
<P>
   ``I love her wholeheartedly, with all my heart,'' Paula Johnson
said at a packed press conference here Tuesday, describing Callie,
the spirited girl she has raised since birth. ``There isn't
anything I wouldn't do for her.''
</P>
<P>
   Or for Rebecca Chittum, raised by a family 80 miles away _ who
is, in all likelihood, her biological daughter. Asked about her
first thought when she saw a picture of Rebecca, Johnson said,
``That she was a beautiful child and that she looks like me.''
</P>
<P>
   As she spoke, her attorney, Cynthia Johnson, held up a large
photo of Rebecca. With her golden curls and blue eyes, she looked
like a miniature version of Paula Johnson.
</P>
<P>
   Both Cynthia Johnson and Paula Johnson, who are not related,
said they have no interest in fighting the family that has raised
Rebecca. They dismissed the comments of some relatives who have
suggested a ``swap'' in interviews.
</P>
<P>
   ``I got very angry with someone who was talking about
swapping,'' the attorney said. ``These are not items. These are
children. ... Don't let me hear that word again.''
</P>
<P>
   The families are close to working out an amicable agreement for
visitation so they can avoid a court fight, the lawyers said.
Cynthia Johnson said the two families will meet soon _ without
their children _ to discuss an agreement and console each other.
</P>
<P>
   The parents who raised Rebecca were killed in a car crash on
July 4, apparently with no idea that they had been sent home from
the hospital in June 1995 with the wrong child.
</P>
<P>
   `All of my children are ... very upset,'' Paula Johnson said.
``My two oldest boys, they want to know how Callie's ... going to
understand any of this.''
</P>
<P>
   Callie is not the only one. The renowned University of Virginia
hospital, which says all procedures were followed, is scrambling to
explain what happened. The police are investigating, too, but so
far there is no sign of criminal misconduct.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
---- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Paula Johnson was a single, 27-year-old when her daughter was
born shortly before midnight on June 29, 1995. The 9-pound, 6 ounce
baby, Callie Marie, was whisked away for the night because of
possible juvenile diabetes.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's boyfriend at the time, Carlton Conley, saw the baby
briefly. Johnson and Conley say their memories are foggy, but they
think the newborn was wearing the standard wrist ID band.
</P>
<P>
   When the baby was returned the next morning, she looked smaller.
</P>
<P>
   Also on the 29th, Whitney Rogers, a 16-year-old, delivered a 7
pound, 12 ounce baby girl, Rebecca Grace. She was given the last
name of Whitney's boyfriend, Kevin Chittum.
</P>
<P>
   After a few chats at the hospital, the two mothers never saw
each other again. Rebecca's family lived in Buena Vista, southwest
of Charlottesville, and Callie's lived northeast, in Ruckersville.
</P>
<P>
   Relatives often remarked that the girls didn't much resemble
their mothers in appearance or temperament. Still, they might never
have have found out that anything was amiss if not for Johnson's
decision to make Conley increase his $75 monthly child support.
Conley said that Callie was not his child.
</P>
<P>
   Blood tests in paternity cases are routinely given to the child
as well as the mother and presumptive father. The results, given to
Johnson on July 2, were shocking: not only was Conley not Callie's
father, but Johnson wasn't the girl's biological mother, either.
</P>
<P>
   On July 3, with hospital administrative offices closing for the
long weekend, she found Cynthia Johnson, who works in a legal
clinic for women. Paula Johnson didn't want to sue anyone, her
lawyer said Tuesday. She just wanted to make sure that her
biological daughter was safe and secure.
</P>
<P>
   A day later, Kevin Chittum, Whitney Rogers and all four of their
passengers were killed when their car hit a tractor-trailer head on
as they drove to a county fair on a rain-slicked highway.
</P>
<P>
   The couple's daughters, Rebecca and one-year-old Lindsey, had
stayed home. In Buena Vista, the families soon agreed on a rotating
custody for the two sisters: four months with Kevin's parents, then
four months with Whitney's mother; then four months with Whitney's
father and stepmother.
</P>
<P>
   A few days ago, the hospital asked for a blood sample from
Rebecca. Her blood was O-negative, which is rare. And records from
1995 showed that Rogers had given birth to a girl with A-positive
blood.
</P>
<P>
   If the case goes to court, the family might have to allow a DNA
test with blood collected from Whitney's body on July 4 along
Interstate 81.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   There is something lurid about this case, of course, and
residents of Buena Vista, the town where Rebecca lives, say
reporters have been circling like buzzards. But beyond the initial
shock, something about the matter of Baby Rebecca and Baby Callie
has touched parents far beyond Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, experts have examined the role of genes versus
environment, the issue of what makes a suitable family to raise a
child and who should take custody if a child's parents divorce or
die.
</P>
<P>
   What makes this exceptional is that everything is rolled into
one messy package.
</P>
<P>
   ``How much does it matter that one of the girls is orphaned?''
asked Boston University Law School professor Jane Cohen, a
specialist in family law. ``How much do we count the suitability of
the strangers who want a relationship with her? How close is the
extended family who is raising Rebecca? We don't have any good
answers, so we pour our own projections onto this case.''
</P>
<P>
   The law is vague, Cohen said, but it includes a ``biological
presumption'' _ that is, children should be with their biological
parents unless the parents are abusive, irresponsible or absent for
long stretches.
</P>
<P>
   Elizabeth Bartholet, a professor at Harvard Law School and
mother of two adopted children, says many people share that bias _
and it rankles her.
</P>
<P>
   ``One of the reasons people are drawn to these cases is that
there is a lot of sympathy for biological connections ... and a
belief in the innocent biological parent,'' said Bartholet, the
author of ``Family Bonds.'' In fact, she said, a good parent is
determined by the style of parenting, not the right DNA.
</P>
<P>
   The lawyers of the families might be able to make an agreement
soon, but the recriminations and doubts will likely last for a long
time. Kevin Chittum's aunt, Mary Watts, says she has nothing
against Paula Johnson, but several biological relatives want
extensive visitation rights with Callie, if not custody. ``I know
Kevin and Whitney would have wanted their own child,'' she said by
phone.
</P>
<P>
   &QL; 
----- &QC; 
 &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the four-block-long downtown Buena Vista, where Rebecca and
her mother were familiar visitors, these days people talk about DNA
and biology more than the hot weather.
</P>
<P>
   ``If you have a kid and you've loved the kid for three years and
you're the one called Mommy or Daddy, then it's your kid,'' said
Kristen Youngblood, 21, owner of a computer store. Youngblood hopes
for a quick, friendly solution between the families, but all the
upbeat chatter about visitation rights puzzles him. ``That will
just make the children confused, especially in these days where
parents get divorced and remarried. I mean, how many sets of
parents can you have?''

MOORE CHANGES ROLES INSTEAD OF TEAMS 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By FRANK DELL'APA  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   FOXBOROUGH, Mass. _ In recent weeks, Joe-Max Moore has assumed
several roles. He was cast as a defensive midfielder for the US
national soccer team and midfield playmaker for the Revolution.
Over the weekend, his desire to move to Miami became prominent as
he was mentioned as possible trade bait for the Fusion's Carlos
Valderrama.
</P>
<P>
   But when the Revolution meet the San Jose Clash Wednesday night,
Moore will be back where he started his Major League Soccer career
_ at striker.
</P>
<P>
   ``The trade had been talked about for a week,'' Moore said
Tuesday. ``So I've thought about it and about different situations.
But that doesn't affect me at all.
</P>
<P>
   ``I give everything I have to this team. I always give 100
percent to my club and the national team, no matter what. This
doesn't take me out of things mentally.''
</P>
<P>
   After scoring 11 goals in 14 games in his first Revolution
season (1996), Moore has struggled. He has scored in only two games
this year, including twice during a 3-1 victory at Dallas two weeks
ago, the Revolution's second since May 10.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've always thought we had the talent to win games with this
team,'' Moore said. ``It's just crazy that this team doesn't have a
lot of wins. I have no idea why we don't. It's like we've been
jinxed for three years; something is not allowing this team to win.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not the coach. The coaching staff has all done a good
job. But it is so hard to go year after year without winning.''
</P>
<P>
   As he was two years ago, Moore is being cast in the savior's
role.
</P>
<P>
   ``We need to turn it around right away,'' he said, ``or we are
in trouble.''
</P>
<P>
   The Revolution, with 16 points in 22 games, trail Miami (20
points, 21 games) and Tampa Bay (18 points, 23 games) for the final
playoff place in Major League Soccer's Eastern Conference.
</P>
<P>
   Coach Thomas Rongen had hoped to add Valderrama, whom he coached
in Tampa in 1996, but realized that would not have solved the
defensive problems. No MLS team has surrendered more than the
Revolution's 48 goals.
</P>
<P>
   Rongen has revamped the lineup again in an attempt to snap a
league-record eight-game home losing streak. Ian Feuer regains the
starting goalkeeper position. Dutchmen Edwin Gorter and Richard
Goulooze will start in central defense. Ivan McKinley will be on
the left side of defense. David Nakhid, returning from the Shell
Cup Caribbean championships, will be in defensive midfield.
Colombian Oscar Pareja takes the ``No. 10'' role, which has passed
from Gorter to Jair to Moore. And Paul Keegan will start on the
left side of midfield.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tactically, I feel these players can do the job, based on
their performance and what I've seen from San Jose,'' Rongen said.
``I want Joe-Max to play next to (Raul) Diaz Arce for the next few
games, to give them some continuity and security. Joe-Max needs to
be close to the goal.''
</P>
<P>
   As the trade talks progressed, Moore appeared to be moving to
South Florida; could he be adversely affected by the attempted
deal?
</P>
<P>
   ``He understands that's the nature of the beast,'' Rongen said.
``He also realizes the better he plays, the more his value goes up
and the easier it will be for him to move on.''
</P>
<P>
   Pareja, who joined the Revolution in June, has kept a low
profile. Now he will in a position to choreograph the team's
offense.
</P>
<P>
   ``With a foreign player, it takes a while to find out what kind
of player he is,'' Rongen said. ``You need to see someone play six
times, in differing conditions. Oscar has traits similar to Jair.
Unfortunately, he likes to float and he is used to interchanging
positions in Colombia. In the No. 10 position, it will allow him to
roam.''

U.S. CITES ABUSES IN MEXICO AT U.S.-OWNED FACTORY  
(JT)
</HEADLINE>
  
 (ATTN: Ohio)   By SAM DILLON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   MEXICO CITY _ The management of an American-owned auto-parts
factory here allowed scores of thugs from a government-controlled
union into the plant last September, where they shouted at workers
and warned against voting for an independent union in an election
the next day, according to the U.S. Labor Department.
</P>
<P>
   Later, after workers voted overwhelmingly for the existing
union, affiliated with the governing Institutional Revolutionary
Party, backers of the independent union were attacked and beaten at
another plant owned by the company, the report found. Police
officers who were called to the factory took no action, the
department said, and a government panel whose responsibility it is
to protect workers' rights sided with the union federation.
</P>
<P>
   Those are some of the details included in an eight-month
investigation by the Labor Department into the violence and threats
against workers at two plants near Mexico City owned by Echlin
Inc., based in Branford, Conn.
</P>
<P>
   In a report on the investigation, made public on Monday, the
department concluded that the Mexican government had failed to
enforce its own laws protecting worker rights.
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department conducted the study under the terms of the
North American Free Trade Agreement, which lets the three
participants, Canada, Mexico and the United States, review each
other's labor practices if complaints are filed.
</P>
<P>
   Paul Ryder, an Echlin spokesman, Tuesday referred a reporter to
a statement issued in April. ``Echlin acted responsibly and
ethically before, during and after the Sept. 9 election,'' it said.
``The company followed applicable Mexican laws regarding union
elections and maintained its neutral role as an observer.''
</P>
<P>
   The Labor Department's report says that Echlin also denied
accusations of abuses in a letter.
</P>
<P>
   ``But the accounts of the workers were well documented, we had
press accounts, and our embassy was following this,'' said Irasema
Garza, who heads the Labor Department's national administrative
office and who directed the review. ``The workers' allegations were
credible.''
</P>
<P>
   Fernando Irala Burgos, a spokesman at Mexico's labor ministry,
said officials there did not wish to comment on the findings.
</P>
<P>
   Labor Secretary Alexis Herman was drafting a letter Tuesday to
her Mexican counterpart, Jose Antonio Gonzalez Rodriguez,
requesting formal consultations to discuss the findings, Ms. Garza
said.
</P>
<P>
   Other reports by the Labor Department that have criticized labor
abuses in Mexico have aroused increasing irritation here. The
latest document could increase tensions since it describes Mexican
government inaction in the face of beatings and mass dismissals of
workers seeking to form the independent union and to improve
workplace safety conditions.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The report says, ``The review indicates that a group of workers
who attempted to exercise their right to freedom of association
were subjected to retaliation by their employer and the established
union in the workplace, including threats of physical harm and
dismissal.''
</P>
<P>
   It added: ``Workers engaged in lawful organizational and
informational activities outside a workplace were subjected to
physical attack by persons associated with the established union at
the plant and in the presence of company officials.
</P>
<P>
   ``While Mexico's Constitution and federal labor law protect
workers freedom of association, in the instant case it appears that
they were not afforded the protections to which they were
entitled.''
</P>
<P>
   The workers who voted on union representation are employed at
the Itapsa plant, with 350 employees, in the town of Ciudad de los
Reyes outside Mexico City. Itapsa is owned by Echlin, which was
bought in July for $3.9 billion by Dana Corp., based in Toledo,
Ohio.
</P>
<P>
   The Itapsa workers are legally represented by the Mexican
Workers' Federation, known by its Spanish initials CTM, the main
nationwide PRI-affiliated labor body. But the workers appear to
have played no role in selecting the CTM to represent them, and
have not been allowed to see the contract setting their wages,
about $5 daily.
</P>
<P>
   Starting in 1996, a politically independent metal workers'
union, known by its Spanish initials Stimahcs, began an organizing
drive.
</P>
<P>
   The company responded by dismissing about 50 workers involved in
the campaign. The Sept. 9 union election took place inside the
Itapsa plant, with workers required to state their union preference
publicly while thugs, many of them armed, paced the floors shouting
threats.
</P>
<P>
   The beating of eight Itapsa workers took place on Dec. 15,
outside American Brakeblock, another plant owned by Echlin in
northern Mexico City, the report said.
</P>
<P>
   A coalition of Mexican, Canadian and American trade unions
petitioned for the the department's review by filing a complaint in
December.

DEFENSE LAWYER DENIES REPRESENTING HARRELSON IN JUDGE'S MURDER
CASE 

</HEADLINE>
  
 (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  By THADDEUS HERRICK 
c.1998 Houston Chronicle 
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   DENVER _ A defense lawyer who was once a suspect in the 1979
shooting of a federal judge in San Antonio established an informal
attorney-client relationship with Charles Harrelson during the time
the legendary South Texas hustler stood trial for the crime.
</P>
<P>
   That possible conflict of interest, revealed during testimony at
a hearing in federal court Tuesday, is at the crux of an effort by
a high-profile team of lawyers to win a new trial for Harrelson.
The father of actor Woody Harrelson is serving two life sentences
for the murder of U.S. District Judge John Wood.
</P>
<P>
   But Alan Brown, the San Antonio lawyer at the center of the
controversy, denied that he ever represented Harrelson in the Wood
case. Nor, said Brown, did Harrelson believe that he was
represented by anyone other than Tom Sharpe, his attorney.
</P>
<P>
   ``I never discussed trial strategy with him,'' said Brown of his
relationship with Harrelson. ``He didn't ask my opinion on things
like that.''
</P>
<P>
   The testimony came during the second day of the hearing, which
is expected to end Wednesday when Charles Harrelson testifies. U.S.
District Judge Fred Biery of San Antonio, who moved the proceedings
to Denver in the interest of fairness and security, is not expected
to rule immediately.
</P>
<P>
   Lawyers for Harrelson _ which included Harvard law professor
Alan Dershowitz until he was recently named a witness in the case _
relied heavily on letters and notes recovered from a San Antonio
storage bin belonging to Brown's office. Brown also acknowledged
that before the Harrelson trial he had conversations with the
defendant that he considered ``privileged.''
</P>
<P>
   One letter from Brown, written after Harrelson's indictment,
seems to offer Brown's professional services. A letter from
Harrelson urges Brown to meet with him ``to discuss legal matters
pending against me.'' Another letter from Harrelson asks Brown to
visit him ``post haste.''
</P>
<P>
   But while lawyers for Harrelson sought to portray Brown as a key
lawyer in their client's defense, attorneys for the Justice
Department attempted to show that the San Antonio attorney simply
admired Harrelson's reputation as a high-stakes gambler and struck
up a friendship with him out of sympathy.
</P>
<P>
   What's more, lawyers for the government said, the relationship
developed well after Brown had passed a polygraph test and was
dropped by the FBI as a suspect in the Wood murder.
</P>
<P>
   Justice Department lawyers suggested that Brown's involvement
with Harrelson did not go beyond bringing him freeze-dried coffee
and delivering news updates from the often colorful San Antonio
criminal world. Brown himself testified that he felt sorry for
Harrelson after the indictment.
</P>
<P>
   ``He was in a lot of trouble,'' said Brown. ``I tried to be nice
to him.''
</P>
<P>
   The Denver hearing has brought back to life a turbulent time in
Texas history, when Wood became the first federal judge in modern
times to be assassinated. ``Maximum John,'' as he was known because
of his lengthy sentences, particularly in drug-related convictions,
was shot in the back May 29, 1979, as he was leaving his San
Antonio townhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Implicated in the murder was Jimmy Chagra, an El Paso drug lord
who the government said ordered the hit because he was facing a
lifetime sentence in Wood's courtroom. Lawyers for the government
pinned the crime on Harrelson, a once-convicted contract killer who
they said was paid $250,000 for the job.
</P>
<P>
   Though Harrelson appealed and lost, the jury verdict was seen by
many as unfair. The case was tried in a federal courthouse in San
Antonio named after Wood and the presiding judge was a pallbearer
at the fallen judge's funeral.
</P>
<P>
   Still, the lawyers representing Harrelson in his bid for a new
trial are focusing on ineffective council, arguing that his lawyer,
Sharpe, not only bungled evidence related to the case but enlisted
the help of Brown. The attorneys argue that it was in Brown's
interest to see that Harrelson was convicted.
</P>
<P>
   The legal dream team, which includes San Francisco attorney
David Michael, also argues that the FBI hid evidence that would
have shown that others, perhaps even Brown, conspired to kill Wood.
</P>
<P>
   Dershowitz, formerly on the legal team, is expected to be called
as a witness in the case, possibly to testify about a conversation
he had with Brown last year. The Harvard professor indicated that
Brown had told him in April 1997 that he had been heavily involved
in the Harrelson defense, a conclusion that Brown rejected.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing is in itself unusual, since most petitions for new
trials are handled in writing. Few are granted, and most believe
Harrelson's attempt at overturning his conviction to be a long
shot.
</P>
<P>
   But that has not stopped Harrelson, whose motion is being
underwritten by son Woody, star of such films as ``Natural Born
Killers'' and ``The People vs. Larry Flynt.''
</P>
<P>
   Charles Harrelson was first convicted of a contract killing in
South Texas when his son was 7 and was behind bars during most of
his son's youth.
</P>
<P>
   The hearing has produced an enormous amount of sympathy for
Harrelson, who once bragged that he could make more money playing
cards than killing a federal judge. Sharpe, Harrelson's lawyer for
many years, said testifying against Harrelson was painful.
</P>
<P>
   ``I feel a loyalty to him because we kind of grew up together,''
said Sharpe. ``We got along well.''
</P>
<P>
   In testimony, Sharpe sought to bolster his legal reputation,
which lawyers for Harrelson have called into question. He recalled
that prior to the Wood case he saved Harrelson's life twice in
death penalty trials, representing him in two cases of
murder-for-hire.

GOVERNORS DEMAND MORE CONTROL OVER CLEANING UP POLLUTED WATER 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOHN H. CUSHMAN, Jr.   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Brushing aside objections from the Clinton
administration, the nation's governors Tuesday endorsed a
resolution demanding more control over how and when states bring
polluted waters up to federal standards.
</P>
<P>
   Their proposal, adopted in Milwaukee at the annual meeting of
the National Governors' Association, has touched off a heated
debate between federal and state authorities.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, major environmental groups strongly criticized the
governors' recommendation, saying it would weaken the Federal Clean
Water Act, an accusation the governors denied.
</P>
<P>
   Although a resolution by the governors has no binding force,
they exert considerable influence in Congress. For years now,
federal lawmakers have been trying to revise the 25-year-old Clean
Water Act but have been unable to agree on how.
</P>
<P>
   In this vacuum, many state officials say it is they who should
wield increased power over environmental regulation, just as they
have taken the lead in welfare policy in recent years.
</P>
<P>
   Under the governors' proposal, each state would devise its own
program to bring polluted waters into compliance with federal
standards. State and local governments would then work out a
watershed plan for each river and lake.
</P>
<P>
   The broad state programs would be subject to approval by the
EPA, but, contrary to current law, the local watershed plans would
not. And the agency would be permitted to reject a state program
only by finding that there was ``not a reasonable likelihood'' that
it would clean up the water within 15 years.
</P>
<P>
   Also in the governors' proposal is a provision that would give a
state ``a reasonable time'' to make any required changes in its
program if the EPA rejected it or found that the state was failing
to meet its timetables.
</P>
<P>
   Federal officials said the governors' proposal would undermine
the administration's current initiatives to improve water quality.
The White House is trying to win Congressional approval for
hundreds of millions of dollars in new environmental spending, much
of which would go to the states, and to impose new policies on the
management of runoff pollution from factory farms and from sewer
systems that overflow during heavy rains.
</P>
<P>
   J. Charles Fox, the EPA's acting assistant administrator for
water programs, signaled the administration's objections to the
governors' proposal in a letter just before the group met.
</P>
<P>
   ``The combined effect of these policies,'' Fox's letter said,
``would be to weaken the national clean water program and to slow
our steady progress toward clean water.''
</P>
<P>
   But Nebraska Gov. Ben Nelson, who pushed the resolution through,
rejected Fox's assessment.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a philosophical difference as to the role of the EPA,
the federal government and the states,'' said Nelson, a Democrat
who is the departing chairman of the governors' Natural Resources
Committee. ``The governors have drawn a line in the sand and said
it is time to change the roles so there are national standards but
flexibility for the states to meet those standards.''
</P>
<P>
   On the other hand, Brett Hulsey, the Great Lakes and Midwest
representative for the Sierra Club, said: ``This is a great step
backward for clean water. The governors are saying that they can do
the job, although they have no demonstrated ability to provide
clean water.''

AFRICAN ENCYCLOPEDIA DUE ON CD-ROM 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by New York Times News Service clients)  
 By MARCELLA BOMBARDIERI  
 c.1998 The Boston Globe  
 
<TEXT>
<P>
   An African encyclopedia _ first conceived in the early 20th
century _ will finally come into being early next year in a
decidedly modern form, the CD-ROM.
</P>
<P>
   Harvard scholars Henry Louis Gates Jr. and K. Anthony Appiah
have collaborated with Microsoft Corp. to prepare the Encarta
Africana almost a century after W.E.B. Du Bois began work on his
never-completed Encyclopedia Africana.
</P>
<P>
   Black intellectual Du Bois spent the last years of his life
compiling what he envisioned as a ``Black Britannica,'' but his
death in 1963 cut short his effort.
</P>
<P>
   Gates has long been intrigued with Du Bois's project. ``Being a
Du Bois junkie like every other young black intellectual,'' Gates
said, he wanted to finish the encyclopedia himself.
</P>
<P>
   Gates and Appiah first discussed the idea as students in the
1970s. When both became established as professors at Harvard
University, they decided they had the clout to finish the project,
which will also be published in book form.
</P>
<P>
   They gathered 3,000 articles contributed by 400 scholars and a
20-person staff. The goal was to bring together every aspect of
knowledge about Africa and the African diaspora.
</P>
<P>
   ``A is for aardvark and Z is for Zimbabwe,'' Gates said. ``We
have flora and fauna between those, too. This is a real
encylopedia.''
</P>
<P>
   Gates expects the project to mark a turning point in
African-American studies throughout the world.
</P>
<P>
   ``We hope this will do for the black world what the Encyclopedia
Britannica did for the European world in the 18th century,'' he
said. ``Britannica consolidated a lot of fragmentary knowledge
about the world between two covers, and we have a similar
situation.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to show the unity of the black world and its
relatedness, as well as the continuities and discontinuities of
black culture,'' he added. ``Du Bois believed this would make it
impossible for others to make derogatory claims about the African
world,'' and its supposed lack of civilization. ``We think he was
right.''
</P>
<P>
   The CD-ROM will include virtual tours of such places as Harlem,
``black Paris'' and the slave station at Goree Island in Senegal.
It also features short lectures by notable Africans and
African-Americans such as United Nations Secretary General Kofi
Annan, scholar Cornel West and poet Maya Angelou.
</P>
<P>
   In addition to the CD-ROM, Encarta Africana will also be
released in September 1999 in one-volume book form by Perseus
Books.
</P>
<P>
   ``Afro-Americans still lag in the technological race,'' Gates
said. ``Since this is such a new reference work, it's important
that we reach people in as many media as we can, and we still do
live in a book culture.''

BUSINESS TRAVEL: ACT FAST FOR EUROPE; LESS PAPERWORK; MILES FOR

<P>
   It's still the peak summer travel season, but airlines are
looking ahead to fall with sale fares to Europe. Travelers will
have to act fast for this batch: The booking deadline for most is
Aug. 13.
</P>
<P>
   Late fall and winter travel offers the cheapest seats. For
example, $418 is the lowest round-trip fare from New York to Paris
being offered by Air France, AMR's American Airlines, Delta Air
Lines and most other carriers for travel in September and October.
That drops to $338 from Nov. 1 through Dec. 11 and Jan. 11 to March
24. Tax is extra, and travel must be on Monday through Thursday.
The major drawback for business travelers, in addition to the lead
time, is the Saturday-night stay required.
</P>
<P>
   The lowest New York-to-London fare for September and October is
$448 on most of the major airlines; later in the season, it goes as
low as $318 on Virgin Group's Virgin Atlantic and a few other
carriers. For late fall and winter, fares of less than $400 round
trip are also being offered on a number of other major European
routes: New York to Vienna, Milan, Brussels and Amsterdam, to name
a few.
</P>
<P>
   Airline spokesmen say the sales are just business as usual, but
Samuel Buttrick, airline analyst for Paine Webber, saw another
possible reason: Increased trans-Atlantic capacity exceeds expected
long-term traffic growth.
</P>
<P>
   Signing Once and for All
</P>
<P>
   Budget Rent A Car is joining the ranks of other rental companies
with ``paperless'' express service. The Budget service, called
Fastbreak, is being phased in over the next few weeks at major U.S.
airports.
</P>
<P>
   Other rental companies, including Hertz and Avis Rent a Car,
have similar programs.
</P>
<P>
   At Budget, enrollment is free; customers fill out a master
rental agreement detailing their preferences, from collision damage
waiver to type of vehicle. Then, at 25 airports (including Kennedy
International, La Guardia, O'Hare International, Los Angeles
International and Logan International in Boston) customers will be
able to bypass the rental counter, taking the bus from the terminal
to the Budget lot and picking up their cars there.
</P>
<P>
   At 80 additional airports, customers can stop at the counter to
check their reservation status on a printout, show their driver's
licenses and pick up the keys to their car.
</P>
<P>
   In both cases, a receipt will be printed out on the spot when
the car is returned.
</P>
<P>
   Card With a Dividend
</P>
<P>
   US Airways and Nationsbank have started a Dividend Miles Visa
Platinum card that allows members to earn 1.2 miles for each dollar
spent. Card members receive a 5,000-mile bonus the first time they
use the card and double miles on US Airways ticket purchases. They
also get a $99 companion ticket for a trip in the continental
United States each year after their anniversary date of joining,
$75 off a new membership to US Airways Clubs and a year-end account
summary. The annual membership fee is $125.
</P>
<P>
   Their Kind of Town
</P>
<P>
   Chicago is the city most often visited by business travelers
domestically and London is the most popular internationally,
according to a recent survey of 227 corporate travel managers by
Runzheimer International, the consultants in Rochester, Wis.
</P>
<P>
   Respondents were asked to name the 10 cities most often visited
by their companies' employees traveling on business. On the
domestic list, after Chicago, which was mentioned by 54 percent of
respondents, other major destinations were New York, named by 44
percent; Atlanta, 41 percent; Los Angeles, 40 percent, and Dallas,
39 percent. London was cited by 54 percent of respondents, with
Paris a distant second at 28 percent, followed by Toronto, Mexico
City and Tokyo. Both Chicago and London also topped their
respective categories the last time the survey was taken, two years
ago.

A SULLEN FUTURISM DEADENED BY FEAR OF THE FUTURE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9.) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By BERNARD HOLLAND   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``Russian Futurism,'' five compact disks in three packages from
Arte Nova, appropriates a title to which it may not be entitled.
Futurism had a distinct time, place and description, and none of
the music offered here fits the last two of these.
</P>
<P>
   The visual arts were Futurism's focus; the musical arm survives
in accounts of it. Aside from an all but undecipherable shellac
record, this brief, brave movement came and went, leaving only its
ideas behind.
</P>
<P>
   Futurism flourished in Italy, beginning with a series of
manifestoes around 1910. The roar of an automobile, it was
proclaimed, had more claim to beauty than the ``Victory of
Samothrace.'' Even Debussy added support (though not his
participation) when he said, ``The century of the airplane deserves
its music.''
</P>
<P>
   So this was to be the age of the machine, if it was not already.
Whereas the visual arts had taken the human form as a model and
distilled the symmetries of nature into architecture and design,
the Futurists would use the logic and physical power of industry
for its raw materials.
</P>
<P>
   In music, Futurism would exchange the sounds of violins for
those of the machine shop and the factory. Luigi Russolo, trained
more as a painter than a musician, discouraged traditional
instruments altogether and built a number of what he called
``intonarumori,'' mechanical sound-producing devices in service of
the ``art of noise.''
</P>
<P>
   We have only the vaguest evidence of how these intonarumori
sounded. There is a photograph of Russolo conducting one such
construction (manned by musicians) at a London concert in 1914.
Elsewhere, the scratchy record tells little. Russolo lost interest
around 1930; his abandoned noise-palettes languished and were
destroyed sometime during World War II.
</P>
<P>
   Surviving Futurists, meanwhile, had returned to standard
instruments, using them to imitate the desired sounds. If the
movement died at an early age, its traces lingered: in the vivid
brutalities of George Antheil and Edgard Varese; in the rigid
momentum of rock-and-roll and the Minimalists, and perhaps, too, in
composers like the Australian Peter Sculthorpe and the American
John Cage, who have tried to mirror the sounds of their
surroundings rather than couch their music solely in the orchestral
and instrumental tradition.
</P>
<P>
   With a lineup of Aleksandr Mosolov, Mikhail Gnesin, Aleksandr
Goedicke, Julian Krein, Georgi Kirkor, Nikolai Roslavets and Lev
Knipper, Arte Nova will have a hard time convincing anybody that
these five CDs are about anyone's future.
</P>
<P>
   The fascinations here are in the historical tensions between a
Russian past and a Soviet art that freighted Futurism with a
debilitating contradiction: namely, the need to cut old ties and
create something new, and a similar need to find the resources for
this art in a discredited past.
</P>
<P>
   Mosolov comes closest to the literal idea of Futurism. The
conflicting time schemes of the First String Quartet (in Volume 3,
Arte Nova 74321-48722-2; two CDs), its steely screeches and its
episodes of expressionless repetition ring familiarly.
</P>
<P>
   Yet this work, like the piano music that takes up all of Volume
1 (74321-27793-2), descends more often than not into darkly violent
chord sequences and mumblings of anguish. The program notes mention
Mosolov's ``Iron Foundry,'' widely known in the 1920s for its
orchestra-as-factory concept.
</P>
<P>
   Unhappily, it is not among these performances, so again we must
read about musical Futurism rather than hear what Russia really
thought about it.
</P>
<P>
   What a strange potpourri awaits the listener in the rest of Arte
Nova's offerings. Gnesin's early symphonic fragment ``D'Apres
Shelley'' drifts luxuriously in the manner of Franck, oblivious to
the harsher standards of art to come. His ``Requiem'' for piano
quintet is poised and post-Romantic, with a fugue at its end.
</P>
<P>
   What follows, by Gnesin, is not the future but the past
revisited, though now shorn of a little of its luxury. A piano
trio, a quintet called ``Songs of a Knight Errant'' and the sextet
``Adigeya'' are folk-song gestures clothed in dark Romantic
textures.
</P>
<P>
   ``The Jewish Orchestra at the Ball in Nothingtown'' recites
ethnic dances in near-literal form. The ``Three Characteristic
Melodies to `The Stone Guest' '' (in Volume 2, 64321-39048-2; two
CDs) regurgitates a familiar Spanish vernacular.
</P>
<P>
   Here, and in the pieces by Krein and Kirkor, modal gestures
shape harmonic movement, giving the music ``antiqued'' melodies and
parallel chords, all curiously French in the manner of Ravel and
Debussy. Goedicke's ``At War'' is descriptive, yet so is Berlioz or
even Beethoven's ``Wellington's Victory.''
</P>
<P>
   The opening fanfares are painfully close to Tchaikovsky's Fourth
Symphony, and the use of orchestral color and harmony not that far
away either.
</P>
<P>
   If the string quartets of Roslavets and Knipper (Volume 3)
represent tentative probes into atonality, they simply repeat what
the first quarter of the 20th century knew well already.
</P>
<P>
   Where, indeed, in these advertisements for Futurism, are to be
found the requisite bravado and eccentricity? There is a little
adventure in Mosolov's moroseness, but everywhere else one senses a
subliminal terror of exploring the future and, with it, a need to
seek refuge in folkloristic homilies and symphonic cliches.
</P>
<P>
   After listening, we are moved to appreciate even more
Shostakovich's extraordinary achievement in such an environment.
For if the Soviet Union despised all things reactionary,
reactionary is exactly what its new music became.
</P>
<P>
   Daniele Lombardi is the pianist in Mosolov's Fourth and Fifth
Piano Sonatas and the ``Turkmenian Nights'' (Volume 1). Performers
in the other two volumes are the Novosibirsk Filarmonica String
Quartet; Vladimir Goncharov, trumpeter; Gleb Karpushkin, hornist;
Andrei Pisarev and Aleksei Nesterenko, pianists; and the Russian
Philharmonic conducted by Konstantin Krimets.
</P>
<P>
   All are good performers but none nearly as persuasive as their
colleague Ky-rill Rodin, a first-rate cellist.

`ST. ELSEWHERE' TAUGHT VIEWERS TO BE CAREFUL WATCHERS
</HEADLINE>
  (For release Sunday, Aug. 9.)  
(jw) 
 By PETER M. NICHOLS

<TEXT>
<P>
   On Nov. 9, 1982, ``St. Elsewhere'' was in its second episode and
busily stirring the dramatic pot. In one room of St. Eligius, the
worn old hospital called Elsewhere, a beleaguered institution on
the bottom rung of Boston's famed medical establishment, lay a
wounded terrorist named Rhinehart (Tim Robbins in the early stages
of his career). In another room, a young woman was dying, a victim
of the terrorist's bomb, anguished over by her husband, McAllister
(Jack Bannon).
</P>
<P>
   On other floors in that early episode, one of eight hourlong
shows in a new boxed set of ``St. Elsewhere'' from New Video,
several story lines were taking shape in the layered, complex
manner of the ``workplace family'' series, a genre introduced a
season earlier by Steven Bochco in the cop series ``Hill Street
Blues'' and carried on today in shows like ``NYPD Blue'' and the
direct heir of ``St. Elsewhere,'' ``ER.''
</P>
<P>
   In one strand of the tale, a psychiatrist worked with a patient
who thought she was a bird (``I see we're Tweetie today''). In
another, the peppery, brusque Dr. Mark Craig (William Daniels),
Eligius' totally assured chief surgeon, delivered bad news and good
news to a pudgy patient suffering from chest pains. With his
arteries 94 percent clogged, the fellow was a walking dead man. On
the bright side, Craig breezily announced that he was about to save
him with a triple bypass. The man had less than an hour to notify
relatives and secure permissions.
</P>
<P>
   The operation was a success, but two episodes later the bombing
victim died. McAllister sought out the terrorist in the hospital
and shot him dead _ a shocking development in those pre-``ER''
days. On most shows that would have been that, more or less, but in
March 1986, more than three seasons later, a St. Eligius doctor
named Jack Morrison (David Morse) was doing volunteer work in a
prison when he encountered McAllister, who was serving time for
killing Rhinehart. During a riot, McAllister, no longer the genteel
mourner he was seasons earlier, helped hold Morrison down while he
was raped by another prisoner.
</P>
<P>
   The New Video series is drawn from all seven seasons of ``St.
Elsewhere'' (1982-88). The prison episode isn't included but it is
alluded to, and fans of the show are likely to remember the
McAllister business, from 1982 and later in 1986, very well. ``You
were asked to remember,'' said Robert Thompson, a professor of
television and film at Syracuse University and director of its
Center for Popular Television. ``Sometimes you'd get a tiny bit of
dialogue in season 1 that would have a reference to it in season 4.
You had to be a careful watcher.''
</P>
<P>
   In his book ``Television's Second Golden Age: From `Hill Street
Blues' to `ER' '', he writes extensively about ``St. Elsewhere.''
Television, he explained in an interview, is the one medium that
can keep a story going without end, and with its ensemble cast and
myriad interwoven plot lines developed by writers who remained with
the show year after year, ``St. Elsewhere'' specialized in
recurring elements.
</P>
<P>
   ``It taught people how to watch good complicated television,''
Thompson said. Primarily, the show is remembered for the
sophistication and irreverence of its storytelling and the breed of
viewer attracted by that kind of writing. During the first season
many mainstream viewers were put off by the less than idealized
view of medicine. Ratings were poor enough to encourage the show's
principals to look for other work in anticipation of cancellation.
</P>
<P>
   But then came a reprieve. Moving away from the brain candy on
the networks, cable television was venturing into stronger
material. In light of emerging competition, NBC decided that there
might be room after all for a category of headier show that
appealed to a smaller, smarter audience (and a prosperous one to
boot). ``St. Elsewhere'' got its second season and, with a solid
core of devoted viewers, five more.
</P>
<P>
   ``Once we took the ratings out of the mix, it freed us to be as
adventurous as we wanted to be,'' said Bruce Paltrow, who produced
the show with Mark Tinker. ``We weren't obligated to put on beauty
queens or have happy endings.'' Television's first AIDS story
appeared on ``St. Elsewhere.'' People died. And nearly died. In a
1986 episode that's included in the New Video series, Dr. Wayne
Fiscus (Howie Mandel) is accidentally shot in the emergency room by
an irate wife gunning for her philandering husband. Struck in the
heart, Fiscus both lies on the floor and, in a near-death
experience, views himself being frantically attended to through the
emergency room window.
</P>
<P>
   Later he goes to hell, where he meets former St. Eligius
patients (one of whom dropped dead during his stand-up comedy
routine and another of whom dived off the hospital's roof), and to
heaven, which is a lawnful of elegant people partying in front of a
mansion that looks like the White House. There he has a chat with
God, who is Fiscus' double and has a ``St. Elsewhere'' kind of
outlook. ``The world is so complex,'' says God, ``I'm lucky even to
get my mail.''

COMMENTARY: DNA IN THE USA  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By MAUREEN DOWD    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ You'd think a president in a heap of trouble about
sex would not bring his motorcade to a screeching halt for an
unscheduled stop-by with a blond model.
</P>
<P>
   But even when he is cornered and shaken, Bill Clinton is, as the
nuns at my grade school used to say, ``a bold, brazen piece.''
</P>
<P>
   Spying Christie Brinkley walking down the street in Sag Harbor
on Saturday, Clinton sprang out of his limousine to chat.
</P>
<P>
   We have entered a deeply surreal period in the nation's history.
</P>
<P>
   Time magazine this week features a poll entitled ``What Is
Sex?'' that consists of NC-17 questions. And in a survey conducted
before the president went to the fund-raiser at the Amagansett home
of Alec Baldwin and Kim Basinger, Fox News asked: ``Given the
opportunity, how likely do you think it is that Clinton will make a
pass at Kim Basinger?'' Only 7 percent answered very likely, while
50 percent responded ``not at all likely.''
</P>
<P>
   On the MSNBC morning news show Tuesday, in a feature entitled
``The true nature of Monica Lewinsky: vixen, victim or liar?'' John
Seigenthaler quizzed Sherrie Schneider, co-author of ``The Rules,''
about where Monica went wrong.
</P>
<P>
   ``Don't date a married man,'' Ms. Schneider instructed, even a
powerful one. ``It is really not allowed.''
</P>
<P>
   Even the post-Tina-Brown New Yorker is full of buzz about the
stain, posing this question: ``How would a crime laboratory test a
garment for traces of DNA?'' The answer, reminiscent of the raunchy
opening crime scene in ``Basic Instinct,'' reveals: ``First, the
dress in question is stretched out and secured to a sterile
surface, such as a stainless-steel table ... Then, technicians scan
the garment with ultraviolet light, which causes biological matter
on the fabric to glow an iridescent hue.''
</P>
<P>
   This is all so weird and sad. Swimming in this madness, it is
possible to miss one astonishing fact: Most of the American public
assume that the president of the United States is lying. They
assume that the young woman accusing him is telling the truth _
even though her voice has yet to be heard, even though she has said
``I have lied my entire life,'' even though she has told completely
different versions of her story about what happened in that little
study off the Oval Office.
</P>
<P>
   We are so accustomed to watching the Clinton White House swing
into blindly aggressive spin that it no longer seems odd that
advisers are having a big debate about whether or not the president
should tell the truth. They are checking their polling numbers,
taking the pulse of Democrats on the Hill, ferreting out inside
information from the FBI crime lab, testing alternative scenarios _
perhaps, they desperately suggest, the DNA resulted from the
president brushing up against Monica during one of their
``official'' interactions.
</P>
<P>
   Confronted with the DNA, Clintonites will have to adopt a
postmodernist spin, according to which the findings of science are
not really true anyway.
</P>
<P>
   The president's name is synonymous with ``wiggle room.'' The
Clinton team games the truth, scripts the truth, semantically
parses the truth, dribbles out the truth a coffee spoon at a time,
shifts the truth. Former White House counsel Jack Quinn now posits
that even if Clinton lied, ``This is a matter of sex between
consenting adults ... And, in that sense, it's trivial.''
</P>
<P>
   There is sympathy for the president because it seems that Linda
Tripp entrapped him and Kenneth Starr has unfairly hounded him into
perjury. Watching the prosecutor and the president bloody each
other, most of us just feel like screaming ``STOP THE FIGHT!''
</P>
<P>
   But Bill and Hillary Clinton cut their political teeth on the
Watergate scandal. Of all people, they should appreciate how
corrosive lying is, how disillusioning it is to twist the White
House into a machine that spews out alibis more urgently than
policies.
</P>
<P>
   The trouble with Bill Clinton's presidency is that its highest
cause has always been himself. But if it turns out that Clinton was
lying when he read the script prepared by the Hollywood producer
Harry Thomason, when he swore he had not had sexual relations with
That Woman, he will have hurt something much larger than himself.

PUBLISHER OF MIAMI HERALD RESIGNS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By FELICITY BARRINGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The publisher of The Miami Herald abruptly announced his
resignation Tuesday, jolting a newspaper that has spent the last
few months consumed with speculation about its future as its profit
margins and its commanding place in the region have declined.
</P>
<P>
   The publisher, David Lawrence Jr., who earlier this year flirted
with the idea of running for governor on the Democratic ticket,
will be replaced by Alberto Ibarguen, publisher of The Herald's
Spanish-language sister paper, El Nuevo Herald. Ibarguen, 54, is a
former executive vice president of Newsday in Long Island, N.Y.
</P>
<P>
   In a letter to the newspaper's staff, Lawrence said he had no
immediate plans but wanted to examine a variety of new job
possibilities. In an allusion to the stream of memos that have
sought staff reaction on how to change the institution, he wrote:
``The current re-examination at The Herald and El Nuevo Herald is
difficult, but in the long run healthy. If we do this right, then
we, and our readers and advertisers, will be the better for it. The
economic choices are painful, but good people will make the right
decisions.''
</P>
<P>
   In an emotional gathering in the newspaper's cafeteria Tuesday
afternoon, Lawrence, 56, told several hundred employees, from
reporters to pressmen to advertising salesmen, that he felt he
could better evaluate his options if he were not occupying the
publisher's chair.
</P>
<P>
   Lawrence's departure, combined with a memorandum last month that
asked the staff, ``If you were starting this place all over again,
what would be your `blank slate?''' have prompted widespread
speculation in the newsroom that there are plans for cutbacks,
similar to one the paper went through in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   ``That memo was troubling, very troubling, to a lot of people
who saw it,'' said Elinor Brecher, a feature writer at the paper.
``He seemed unusually anxious and it seemed like a rather odd
request.'' She added, ``We remember what it was like the last time
it happened. It's not a very elevating experience to watch your
colleagues run for the exits.''
</P>
<P>
   Earlier this year, Knight Ridder, The Herald's parent company,
announced it would move its headquarters from Miami to San Jose,
Calif., in the San Francisco Bay area. Executives are already
moving to the new headquarters.
</P>
<P>
   The Herald, which won a Pulitzer Prize for public service for
its coverage of Hurricane Andrew in 1992 and ranks in the top 25 in
newspaper circulation, has also been coping with a circulation
erosion. In March 1997, its daily circulation was about 362,000;
this March it dropped to about 353,000, according to the Audit
Bureau of Circulations.
</P>
<P>
   Its Sunday circulation declined during the same period to about
482,000 from about 492,000. The declines came at a time when much
of the rest of the industry had been able to halt circulation
erosion, at least for the moment.
</P>
<P>
   One executive, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the
paper's profit margin, which had been running at about 20 percent,
was expected to be about 18 percent this year. Executives at Knight
Ridder have told top Herald managers that they should produce a 25
percent margin within three years, the executive said.
</P>
<P>
   Without confirming the exact figures, Ibarguen, the new
publisher, said that ``it is certainly true that Knight Ridder
wants to see greater profitability from The Herald.'' But, he
added, ``Nobody is asking us to use a machete or a meat-ax. We will
engage in an exercise to streamline. And that it not a code word
for layoffs.''
</P>
<P>
   The newspaper has in recent years faced energetic competition
from the Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel, based in Broward County.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview in June about the overall newspaper business,
Knight Ridder's chief financial officer, Ross Jones, said, ``I
would say Miami is our most difficult market.''

MARKET BEARS SLICE CHEESECAKE FACTORY'S STOCK BY 11 PERCENT
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY DAVE MCNARY  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   CALABASAS, Calif. -- Shares of The Cheesecake Factory lost 11
percent of their value Tuesday to hit their lowest point in nearly
a year amid a massive Wall Street sell-off that punished many
issues.
</P>
<P>
   Cheesecake Factory fell $2.0625 to $16.9375 a share for its
worst close since Aug. 13, 1997. The stock has dropped 36 percent
since hitting an all-time high of $26.50 on April 13.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's decline came as the Dow Jones industrial average
plunged nearly 300 points in its third-biggest point drop due to
signs of a weakening economy and doubts about the outlook for
corporate profits.
</P>
<P>
   Jane Vallaire, a spokeswoman for the Southern California-based
casual-dining specialist, said Cheesecake Factory's decline stemmed
solely from market conditions. Analysts Michael Mueller of
NationsBanc Montgomery Securities and Michael Smith of Fahnestock &AMP;
Co. agreed but added that bearish investor sentiment toward smaller
companies in the restaurant sector also probably pulled down the
shares.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a very difficult market for small-cap companies,'' said
Mueller, who believes the stock should be trading as high as $30.
``Fundamentally, The Cheesecake Factory is doing great.''
</P>
<P>
   Smith noted that restaurant stocks tend to be volatile and are
out of favor on Wall Street at the moment.
</P>
<P>
   ``Cheesecake Factory has not made a mistake in the important
part of its business,'' he said. ``Until everyone decides to go on
a diet, they can compete with anyone in any market.''
</P>
<P>
   The company, which split its stock 3-for-2 earlier this year,
recently reported a 62.5 percent gain in second-quarter profits to
$3.9 million, or 19 cents a share, on a 26 percent rise in revenues
to $64.3 million. It operates 24 restaurants and plans to open five
more this year.

SLUMPING GALAXY THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT FRENCH  
 c.1998 Long Beach Press-Telegram  
<TEXT>
<P>
   PASADENA, Calif. -- Octavio Zambrano is still searching for
answers as the skidding Los Angeles Galaxy returns from Major
League Soccer's All-Star break, but he's hardly desperate: What
woes his club must endure now won't mean a whole lot, he says,
should everything go according to plan when it matters most.
</P>
<P>
   It's what the Galaxy coach expects, so he's not looking at
tonight's clash with the Colorado Rapids at Denver's Mile High
Stadium as a must-win encounter.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm looking at it from the standpoint that it's not what
happens (against the Rapids), it's not what happens Saturday (when
L.A. visits Chicago),'' Zambrano said. ``There are 15 games left
for us en route to, to ... glory, to accomplish something that we
have been talking about, thinking about for a long time. ... I'm
looking more at our final goal. The final stretch is there, and we
are in reach of attaining that goal.''
</P>
<P>
   In that context, L.A.'s recent skid -- three successive losses,
the last two by shutout, and four defeats in five games -- won't
matter as long as Zambrano and the Galaxy (16-6, 46 points) turn
things around in the final 10 regular-season matches.
</P>
<P>
   At issue is the role played by Carlos Hermosillo and how he
impacts the players who surround him. Hermosillo, a lumbering
center forward, hasn't scored in eight matches, and the Galaxy's
attack -- once worth 3{ goals per game -- has sagged during
transition from the fluid, no-striker system it employed before the
Mexican's arrival.
</P>
<P>
   ``We've been trying to figure out what's the best way to play
with him -- or for him, in some instances -- and I have to say that
we have not 100 percenmt found that out,'' Zambrano said. ``But I
think, certainly, that we will have that taken care of and by the
playoffs we will be in complete control of our destiny.
</P>
<P>
   ``Obviously, we need points to secure first place, and from that
standpoint winning is important. But getting the right chemistry so
we arrive at the end of the season feelingh good about ourselves
and what we can accomplish, that's the most important thing.''
</P>
<P>
   The Galaxy will try to step toward that against the Rapids
(11-10, 29), who have won eight of 10 games after shoring up a
defense that had surrendered 31 goals in its first 11 games. Since
switching from a 4-4-2 alignment to a 4-5-1 in late May, Colorado
has given up only 12 goals in 10 matches, half of them in the two
losses.
</P>
<P>
   GALAXY NOTES: Central defender Robin Fraser, red-carded against
Dallas, is serving a one-game suspension, but forward Welton and
midfielder Danny Pena return from one-game bans. ... Welton is
second in the MLS scoring race with 35 points (13 goals, 9
assists), one point behind D.C. United's Roy Lassiter. ... The
Galaxy has won all three meetings this season. ... Colorado has won
six in a row at home. ... Cerritos' Marcelo Balboa has scored in
the Rapids' past two games, both on 25-yard rockets.

WHAT'S WRONG WITH TV? JUST DO THE MATH  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9.) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 (Jeff MacGregor, a writer in Manhattan, worked in the television
industry for 20 years.)  
 By JEFF MACGREGOR   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Warning! This is  &UR; not &LR;  a list. Nothing will be ordered, ranked
or alphanumerically indexed. There will be no color-coding. No
scales from 1 to 10.
</P>
<P>
   There might be an exploded 3-D pie chart or a Venn diagram
somewhere toward the bottom; I haven't decided yet. (As a
concession, however, to those of you suffering from late-millennial
list addiction, here: No. 17 _ Fred Mertz, No. 18 _ The Bay of
Fundy, No. 19 _ Pickled tongue.)
</P>
<P>
   The lazybones shorthand of list making isn't a bad thing.
Humankind has always hankered after an orderly, manageable universe
in which the accounting of our stars and ourselves comes easy. What
to do (or read or eat or wear) is simple to catalogue. Why we do it
or how best to get it done remains mostly mysterious, an alchemy of
a kind, and is not so easily given to categoricals.
</P>
<P>
   Take Magic Johnson's late-night television talk show. Please.
Its stupefying badness makes it a lock for the list of Best Reasons
to Move to a Taliban-Ruled Fundamentalist Afghanistan or the
inventory of 100 Potent Arguments Toward a Moratorium on
Electricity.
</P>
<P>
   While certainly true, these lists teach us nothing. Most of us
understand that hiring Magic Johnson as host of a talk show is like
drafting Oprah to cover Shaq in the low post. Possible but
pointless, doomed really, and a breathtaking example of
wrongheadedness. Which brings us to today's topic: why television
stinks.
</P>
<P>
   I think most of would have to agree that television, day in and
day out, is a pretty abysmal enterprise. (We all have our personal
exceptions that prove the rule: i.e., ``The Simpsons,'' Bravo and
game 7 of the World Series.) Toggle that remote for a few minutes.
Bad comedy, bad drama, bad news; bad sports too, if you count
professional wrestling, as one must.
</P>
<P>
   Sure, there's plenty of bad art and entertainment in the world _
motel-lobby seascapes and operetta and the pink velveteen novels of
Barbara Cartland leap to mind _ but these don't pervade our lives
the way television does, don't create a kind of constant
alternative consciousness in which we are all forced to dwell; nor
are they as systematically and cynically devised and distributed.
Television is singular not just in its global reach, but in its
spectacular aptitude for mediocrity.
</P>
<P>
   Johnson's syndicated show is a good example of the flawed logic
and institutional unreason that drives television programming. In
this case it begins with the idea that since Johnson is famous,
charming, successful and a pleasantly well-spoken person, he ought
to be doing his own comedy talk show.
</P>
<P>
   This may have occurred to his management team or to a studio
executive or to Johnson himself. And why not? This is America,
after all, where the pursuit of happiness and a two-year
development deal for your own talk show is virtually guaranteed.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly, at some point, these folks all found themselves in a
sun-drenched corner office together, discussing how to make such a
thing happen. You can bet that they talked about how much it would
cost to produce and distribute, how much they were likely to earn
from it, whom they might bring in to write and produce and direct
it, when it might be taped and where, how they'd promote it, who
the guests would be and where to paint the logo on the customized
production golf carts.
</P>
<P>
   You can likewise make good odds that at no time did anybody pipe
up with the notion that Magic might not be any good at it.
</P>
<P>
   Why not? Because the quality of any given show is far less
important to the men and women who make these things happen than
the financial imperatives that attach to it. Johnson's greatest
selling point in those meetings was his marquee value and the
resulting assumption of a built-in audience.
</P>
<P>
   Whether or not he could tell a joke or sing a song or do an
interview didn't matter. What matters (and not just in this case,
but in all cases, everywhere, even ``Ally McBeal'') is whether or
not the sale of commercial minutes will eventually justify the
costs of producing the show and earn somebody a profit.
</P>
<P>
   That no show has any reason for being, beyond this, is as
immaterial as the Emperor's new duds. It is axiomatic that
television is an advertising medium, not an entertainment medium,
and Magic's recognizability, likability and potential marketability
across diverse demographic groups more than compensates in any
executive's mind for the fact that in a format driven by talent, in
a time slot driven by talent, Johnson has to proceed on foot.
</P>
<P>
   The fault is not Magic's, and we should bear him no grudge. At
this point it is an act of heroism just to keep showing up. But
watching a proud man struggle gamely through another lifeless
sketch or vacuous interview has incited no acts of charity or
heroism on the audience's part; they refuse to show up at all.
</P>
<P>
   The blame, as it mostly should and does, lies with the
inhabitants of those corner offices. The failure of such a show was
virtually assured by the profound cynicism that led to its
production. A bunch of uncomfortable assumptions were probably
made, to wit: The audience will watch anything.
</P>
<P>
   People aren't very bright. A talk show doesn't take much skill.
The research says people like him, so he's critic-proof. Et cetera.
</P>
<P>
   More disturbing is the unsubtle racist subtext behind more and
more programming decisions of this kind: African-Americans in
particular will watch anything. They watch more hours of
television. They don't have cable. Whether he's entertaining or
not, they'll watch because he's black. They watched Arsenio, so
they'll watch Magic. Et cetera.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Unspoken probably, but undeniable in fact, this kind of thinking
further corrupts one of the few media we all continue to have in
common, accelerates our atomization into a nation of fragmenting
self-interest groups and flies, paradoxically, in the face of all
the programming evidence that precedes it.
</P>
<P>
   Arsenio Hall's show was a hit for its first couple of seasons
because of its broad multiethnic appeal. The show lost its steam
and its ratings at precisely the moment it began to target only one
portion of its viewership.
</P>
<P>
   Keenen Ivory Wayans' late-night show and its clone, ``Vibe,''
are gone or going off the air for the same reason. They were
narrowly tailored to suit a race-defined programming theory, a
niche that exists nowhere so much as in the reams of unsupportable
and largely pointless research the network and studio executives
hide behind in order to preserve their jobs.
</P>
<P>
   There wasn't enough research in the whole wide world to justify
``The Chevy Chase Show,'' a costly and short-lived late-night
Titanic that took several Fox executives down with it in the wake
of its powerful aftersuck.
</P>
<P>
   Ballyhooed as the Late Night Hope in 1993, Chase was instead a
perfect vacuum of charm or wit or energy; in fact, it was widely
known among anyone with common sense that he wasn't even a good
talk show  &UR; guest &LR; . Only Fox seemed surprised when the show sank
without a trace. Vanilla Ice, dead ahead! Black or white, rich or
poor, people don't want to watch any more bad television than they
absolutely have to.
</P>
<P>
   That reliance on research, on focus groups and test audiences
and the sad calculus of demographics has led network television to
the point at which all it can hope to do is stop the bleeding. The
decline in ratings for all networks is well documented. Viewers
keep rejecting the prefabricated, predigested entertainment widgets
they're offered, and yet the programmers just keep cranking them
out.
</P>
<P>
   Why? Because the research tells them to. Like any statistical
process, this sort of audience testing will often parrot back to
you whatever you needed it to say in the first place. Numbers are
malleable little things and can be crunched to suit a specific
purpose. Most important, they provide a sort of Teflon shield of
plausible deniability for the roomful of junior vice presidents
charged with creating programs.
</P>
<P>
   Who'd have thought that Magic Johnson wouldn't work? The
research says everybody loves him! You can't quantify creativity,
but you sure can use the test results to deflect criticism. The
thing to remember about clawing your way to the top of the middle
in television is this: Power isn't about getting the job or doing
the job. It's about  &UR; keeping &LR;  the job.
</P>
<P>
   It wasn't that many years ago that there were still a few
showmen and women at the controls, people who had some sense of the
alchemy of making entertainment. There was less reliance then on
test results, more intuition, more gut.
</P>
<P>
   Brandon Tartikoff and Fred Silverman were wrong at least as
often as they were right, sometimes laughably so (``Supertrain''!),
but there was a human hand at the throttle, an individual willing
to take some measure of the heat for a show's failure. These days
you can't find an executive or a programmer with an MBA anywhere
willing to take the responsibility for a failed show.
</P>
<P>
   As more and more vertically integrated communications
conglomerates recombine and merge into ever greater
metacorporations you'll find even fewer people in the process of
devising programming who have any idea how creativity works or what
an audience might actually want to see.
</P>
<P>
   We'll be in thrall to the bean counters then. We'll be even more
imprisoned by the idea that entertainment can be manufactured in
the manner of a toaster oven or a car or a length of fiber-optic
cable.
</P>
<P>
   There's nothing shameful about bean counting per se. But bean
counting presumes a crop of beans, and we're breeding precious few
good growers these days. Television, whether news or entertainment,
is too complicated and mysterious a thing to build from an
inventory of theoretical component parts, or to be assembled from a
laundry list of abstract preconceptions.
</P>
<P>
   Which takes us back to where we started, standing around with a
list in our hands, slightly baffled and left trying to account for
our stars. And wondering what Magic Johnson is going to do with all
that free time he's bound to have any day now.

U.S. SEES RWANDAN ROLE IN CONGO REVOLT 
</HEADLINE>
  (Eds: See also CONGO-ASSESS) 
(mk) 
 By STEVEN ERLANGER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Intelligence reports indicate that the Rwandan
government is behind a growing rebellion in Congo, senior American
officials said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The government of President Laurent Kabila, installed just over
a year ago in Congo with Rwandan help, Tuesday accused the Rwandan
government of involvement in the insurgency, a charge Rwanda
denied.
</P>
<P>
   While American officials were careful not to directly accuse the
Rwandan government of backing the rebellion, they said that
Kabila's failure to control Hutu rebels in eastern Congo was an
obvious motive for Rwandan interference.
</P>
<P>
   ``Eastern Congo is clearly considered a zone of security by the
Rwandans,'' a senior American official said. ``They care about
eastern Congo and this wouldn't be the first time they've sent
their people in. A year and a half ago when they did it, it
resulted in the overthrow'' of President Mobutu Sese Seko.
``Whether the same dynamic is going on or not, we'll see.''
</P>
<P>
   At the same time, American officials did not offer Kabila any
support, a marked contrast to the spring of 1997, when they rallied
around him as the best alternative to the corrupt rule of Mobutu.
</P>
<P>
   In public, American officials said Tuesday that evidence is
sketchy. ``We don't believe that governments should be intervening
in the affairs of their neighbors,'' the State Department
spokesman, James Rubin, said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Clinton administration is consulting widely with countries
in the region and in Europe, officials said, but for now is simply
urging restraint on the parties and watching for further
developments.
</P>
<P>
   Officials said the American special envoy for the region, Howard
Wolpe, is in Kinshasa and is urging Kabila to reach out to all
Congolese, especially ethnic Tutsi, and guarantee their rights and
security in order to hold the country together. ``That is the best
answer for him,'' one official said.
</P>
<P>
   Rubin called Kabila's rule ``a mixed bag,'' with disappointments
in the areas of democratic development, human rights, justice and
the economy, noting in particular Kabila's refusal to cooperate
with a U.N. team investigating charges of genocide.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not prepared to comment on whether we would like to see a
change in the government there _ that's not something we normally
do,'' Rubin said.
</P>
<P>
   But the United States wants ``the government in Kinshasa to be
in a position to control its territory'' and ``believes strongly in
the territorial integrity of the Democratic Republic of the
Congo,'' Rubin said, noting its strategic location and the risk of
renewed violence between the Hutu and Tutsi ethnic groups.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are many important countries that border on it, and as
goes the Congo, so might go the stability of some of the countries
in the region,'' Rubin said. ``We want to see the people there have
a government that can help them thrive and prosper in a democratic
way. Those are our objectives.''
</P>
<P>
   He called on all sides to ``show restraint and resolve these
differences in a nonviolent way.''
</P>
<P>
   Officials noted that this insurgency began soon after Kabila
expelled the last Rwandan military advisers from the country, which
caused Congolese Tutsi ``further concerns about their diminishing
influence within the Kabila government,'' an American official
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Depending on what Kabila does with this mounting insurrection
in his military, we have to see what the Rwandans do,'' the
official said. ``It's up to Kabila to send a reassuring message to
the various elements of the society that they can work things
out.''
</P>
<P>
   Another official said that the Rwandans may not be seeking to
overthrow Kabila, but to give him a warning or to create a buffer
zone in eastern Congo.
</P>
<P>
   A White House spokesman, P.J. Crowley, said: ``The situation in
the Congo is something we are watching very carefully. We are in
touch with several governments in the region to assess what is
going on there and what we can do to prevent a widening of this
situation.''
</P>
<P>
   The officials said that the situation in Kinshasa appeared to be
calm with some scattered shooting overnight, while traffic was
moving nearly normally and the airport was open. The city of Goma
is calm, the officials said, but there are reports of continuing
clashes in Bukavu and nearby areas of south Kivu.

SPORTS COLUMN: FRANCO'S NOO YAWK, NOO YAWK  
 (JT) 
</HEADLINE>
   By DAVE ANDERSON    
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Call it the Noo Yawk syndrome. Some athletes melt
under the heat of its microscope; others thrive on it, or at least
understand it.
</P>
<P>
   As the Yankees' manager, Joe Torre, has thrived on the Noo Yawk
syndrome just as he understood it in those dreary years when he was
the Mets' manager. And because Torre has thrived, his Yankees have
thrived.
</P>
<P>
   More often than not, John Franco has thrived, too. And because
he has thrived, he now has a $6 million, two-year contract
extension that presumably will keep him in the Mets' bullpen
through the 2000 season. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   It's much more than a coincidence that both Torre and Franco
came off the Brooklyn sandlots a generation apart. It's the reason
each understands that the Noo Yawk syndrome surrounds his life in
baseball.
</P>
<P>
   ``The same people who boo you today,'' Franco, the Mets'
left-handed closer, was saying Tuesday, ``are going to cheer you
tomorrow.''
</P>
<P>
   Some ballplayers who grow up elsewhere never quite get that
after they put on a Noo Yawk uniform. Ask Kenny Rogers and Ed
Whitson. Ask Mike Piazza, who hasn't knocked in enough base runners
to convince Mets fans that he's worth the offer of $84 million for
six years from the Dodgers that he spurned.
</P>
<P>
   Franco knew all about the Noo Yawk syndrome from having attended
Mets games as a youngster.
</P>
<P>
   ``I always came to the games with my father and my brother
Jimmy, but I never booed anybody; I just enjoyed the games,'' he
said. ``But I see it when I'm watching pro football games. My
brother will say, `This guy's no good,' and I'll say: `How can you
say that? This guy's a professional athlete.' Sometimes I have to
go to another room.''
</P>
<P>
   But for what presumably will be the rest of his career, Franco
will not have to go to another team _ because he understands the
Noo Yawk syndrome.
</P>
<P>
   ``That issue,'' said Steve Phillips, the Mets' general manager,
alluding to a franchise's catcall climate, ``isn't given such
strong consideration in other cities. If you trade for a closer or
sign one as a free agent, the cost is so significant, you don't
know how they're going to handle New York.''
</P>
<P>
   One of life's oldest tenets is that the devil you know is better
than the devil you don't know. And in Noo Yawk sports, the Noo
Yawker you know is better than the non-Noo Yawker you don't know.
</P>
<P>
   Even when that Noo Yawker is a 37-year-old, left-handed relief
pitcher who is not exactly having a great year.
</P>
<P>
   He's 0-6 with 21 saves, but he has blown 5 saves. If a better
closer were to emerge from the Mets' farm system next year or the
year after, Franco could turn into a set-up reliever.
</P>
<P>
   For all of his 380 saves (third on the career list behind Lee
Smith's 478 and Dennis Eckersley's 390), Franco has never been
considered among the great closers. Durable and usually dependable,
yes. Very good, yes. But never great, never a Hall of Famer.
</P>
<P>
   If Franco were to close the World Series for the Mets, being
center stage might elevate him to Hall of Fame status, but not
necessarily.
</P>
<P>
   Only two relief pitchers are bronzed in Cooperstown: Rollie
Fingers of the Oakland A's teams that won three consecutive World
Series in the early 1970s, and Hoyt Wilhelm, the knuckleballer who
pitched in more major league games (1,070) than anybody else.
</P>
<P>
   In time, Eckersley (who is now approaching Wilhelm's record)
deserves to be a Hall of Famer, but Bruce Sutter, who also deserves
it after popularizing the split-fingered fastball, has yet to
attract anywhere near enough votes.
</P>
<P>
   Unless the Mets wake up this season, they won't even qualify for
a National League wild-card berth, much less get to the World
Series. And unless they assemble more good players, they won't get
to the World Series next year or the year after.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe that's why Mets fans don't seem to be involved in the
wild-card race yet. Maybe the fans don't believe the Mets will
overtake the Cubs and the Giants while staying ahead of the
Dodgers, Brewers and Phillies.
</P>
<P>
   Or maybe it's just too early. Maybe the fans are just waiting
until September to see if the Mets are for real.
</P>
<P>
   That's part of the Noo Yawk syndrome, too. Especially for all
those Mets fans who have been deflated in so many recent seasons.
And for all of John Franco's understanding of the Noo Yawk
syndrome, his new contract isn't enough to make believers of the
fans.

STUMP SAYS CAPITOL HERO SHOULD HAVE BEEN BARRED FROM ARLINGTON
BURIAL 
</HEADLINE>
   (For use by N.Y. Times News Service clients)  
 By ADRIANNE FLYNN  
 c.1998 The Arizona Republic  
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Rep. Bob Stump said the unthinkable: the hero who
laid down his life protecting the Capitol should have been barred
from burial in the hallowed ground of Arlington National Cemetery.
</P>
<P>
   But Stump is so popular among is peers that not a single member
of Congress has been willing to criticize the venerable House
veteran.
</P>
<P>
   Even so, nearly two weeks after a crazed gunman killed Capitol
Police officers John Gibson and Jacob Chestnut, Stump has decided
to loosen up a bit on the strict burial rules he wrote as the
chairman of the House Committee on Veterans Affairs.
</P>
<P>
   In March, Stump was able to push through the rules on a
unanimous House vote, but they were too restrictive for the
Senate's taste. Now Stump says he will rewrite the rules to allow
for the burial of future fallen heroes even though they may not
have had any military service.
</P>
<P>
   Stump, R-Ariz., says he's not backing off his contention that
Gibson should not have been buried in Arlington because he served
no time in the military. (Chestnut was an Air Force veteran and
qualified for burial).
</P>
<P>
   ``Firemen and policemen someplace in this country die every day
probably protecting somebody else's life. Now how are we going to
honor them? They can't all be buried at Arlington,'' Stump said.
</P>
<P>
   Stump is getting support for his view from veterans
organizations, including the Non-Commissioned Offers Association of
the United States of America.
</P>
<P>
   Even House leaders who sought Gibson's burial in Arlington and
stand by their decision stop short of criticizing Stump.
</P>
<P>
   Even Democrats, who would have little reason to back a
Republican colleague running for re-election, are supportive.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think (Gibson's interment) was appropriate, but I think
somebody should have asked Bob,'' said Rep. Ed Pastor, D-Ariz.
``People are undermining his efforts.'`
</P>
<P>
   Stump's popularity helped him get every GOP House member to sign
a letter in 1996 protesting Clinton's use of a law designed to
protect active-duty military personnel from civil lawsuits to try
to quash the Paula Jones sexual harassment lawsuit.
</P>
<P>
   Stump's new version of his Arlington-internment bill could find
the same favor as the original, which passed the House by a vote of
412-0 in March. That bill restricts burial in the nation's premiere
veterans' cemetery to those who retired from military service, were
killed in action, were killed on active duty, or received a Purple
Heart or Silver Star.
</P>
<P>
   Stump originally drafted the legislation to separate burial
waivers from politics after controversy over a Clinton
administration waiver that permitted the Arlington burial of the
late Ambassador Larry Lawrence, whose body was exhumed after it was
discovered that the major Democratic donor had lied about serving
in the Merchant Marine.
</P>
<P>
   To get that bill through the Senate, Stump now says he is
crafting language for a waiver that could be granted by
congressional resolution. In the event that Congress is out of
session, a waiver could also be granted by the Secretary of Defense
in consultation with the chairman and ranking member of the Senate
and House veterans committees.
</P>
<P>
   Stump said some senators were concerned that they would be
ineligible for burial in the cemetery and so were unwilling to
support his bill. The only elected official permitted burial under
Stump's legislation is the president, who is commander-in-chief of
the U.S. armed forces.
</P>
<P>
   The change to allow waivers is worth it to get the burial
criteria spelled out in the law, Stump said. Without it, the Senate
likely will let the legislation die.
</P>
<P>
   Stump said House Speaker Newt Gingrich and other congressional
leaders should have passed a resolution to permit Gibson's burial
in the cemetery at the same time it approved the officers for lying
in state in the Capitol Rotunda.
</P>
<P>
   Gingrich's office told ``Roll Call,'' the semi-weekly Capitol
Hill newspaper that first reported Stump's disapproval of the
arrangements for Gibson, that ``it was a fitting tribute to a man
who died in defense of freedom.''
</P>
<P>
   Rep. J.D. Hayworth, who serves with Stump on the House Veterans
Affairs Committee, declined to discuss the Gibson burial.

DISCOVERING THAT BALLET COULD ALSO BE FANCY-FREE  
 (FOR RELEASE SUNDAY, AUG. 9.) 
</HEADLINE>
   (af)  
 By ANNA KISSELGOFF   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Jerome Robbins was an everyday presence in my dancegoing life
from early on. I saw his three sailors on the town in ``Fancy
Free'' as a child shortly after he created this ballet, his first,
in 1944. It appealed to children and grown-ups alike.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet had already seduced me with Act II of ``Swan Lake.'' But
``Fancy Free,'' like all Robbins works, opened a door. It let me
know at a very young age that ballet had a wide horizon and was not
limited to a single type of theatrical experience.
</P>
<P>
   Ballet was fun then.
</P>
<P>
   As a young person, I may not have understood all the
psychological implications of Robbins ballets like ``Age of
Anxiety,'' but early Robbins was always fresh Robbins. The polish
of the choreography was evident. One was never bored. One was
usually enchanted, as in ``The Pied Piper,'' a 1951 piece to
Copland music that wittily embodied the New York City Ballet's
family feeling.
</P>
<P>
   Some of my most stirring memories relate to an outdoor
performance of Robbins' own short-lived troupe, Ballets: U.S.A., at
the 1959 Dubrovnik Festival in Yugoslavia.
</P>
<P>
   There, as in 1961 when I saw the young Kay Mazzo in Paris with
the group, the reception was frenzied. Robbins dancers, very
American, and seen in relief against the night sky, seemed to have
dropped in from another planet.
</P>
<P>
   Over the years, Robbins himself dropped into myriad dance and
theater performances. As much as I saw his ballets on stage, I
continued to spot him offstage, watching other dance forms _
especially from Asia.
</P>
<P>
   Personally, he could act insecure, be funny or serious. He taped
interviewers taping him. He could also joke about his mishaps in a
summer job as a teen-age busboy at the Waldorf-Astoria.
</P>
<P>
   In recent years, he said he wondered how he, like many others,
did not know about Auschwitz at the time he first entertained us
with ``Fancy Free.''

AOL'S QUARTERLY EARNINGS UP TENFOLD OVER '97, EXCEEDING ESTIMATES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By SAUL HANSELL   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Showing that a 10 percent price increase hardly dented its rapid
growth, America Online said Tuesday that its operating earnings
totaled $57.3 million for the quarter that ended June 30, a tenfold
increase over the same period a year earlier. That represents
operating income of 23 cents a share, exceeding the 19 cents that
analysts estimated.
</P>
<P>
   In a rare move, however, the company said it could not publish
its net earnings pending an agreement with the Securities and
Exchange Commission over several special charges.
</P>
<P>
   America Online said that it expected to write off most of the
$287 million it paid to acquire Mirabilis, an Internet chat
service, and the $29 million it paid for Net Channel, the maker of
a device to connect televisions to the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   Companies generally like to take the highest possible one-time
write-offs in connection with acquisitions to reduce the ongoing
drag on future earnings from the required accounting adjustments.
</P>
<P>
   America Online also expects to write off about half of the $35
million cost of settling a class action.
</P>
<P>
   Steve Case, America Online's chairman, said that whatever the
SEC decided, the company would meet its earnings forecasts for the
coming year. And in any case, he said, the operating results for
the last quarter would not change as a result of the negotiations
with the SEC.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, the company continued to show strong momentum in
nearly every aspect of its business.
</P>
<P>
   Although America Online raised the price of its unlimited
dial-up service from $19.95 to $21.95 a month on April 1, its
subscriber base increased by a net of 665,000 during the quarter,
to 12.5 million.
</P>
<P>
   ``My prediction was that we would see no member growth,'' Case
said. ``Despite a price increase and reduced marketing
expenditures, we continue to have a great relationship with the
mass market.''
</P>
<P>
   Nonetheless, the pace of subscriber growth has slowed to 5.7
percent during the most recent quarter, compared with a 7.5 percent
increase in the corresponding period in 1997.
</P>
<P>
   In the quarter, America Online also significantly pared
promotional spending, to 12 percent of revenues, compared with 21
percent a year earlier. The company said its marketing expenses
would increase, however, as it began to promote its new software
version 4.0.
</P>
<P>
   Over all, revenues increased by 67 percent, to $792 million. Of
that, the company took in $83 million from advertising and other
deals with online merchants, an increase of 87 percent from a year
earlier. Indeed, the company said it had a backlog of $510 million
in commitments for online advertising.
</P>
<P>
   Case said that as a result of huge layoffs in the Compuserve
subsidiary, that division was close to breaking even. Compuserve
will test various marketing approaches for the rest of this year,
he said, predicting that it would not realize net earnings until
more aggressive promotions begin next year.
</P>
<P>
   America Online's stock fell $5.0625, to $110.9375 in trading on
the New York Stock Exchange before the preliminary earnings were
announced. In after-hours trading, the shares jumped $7.8125, to
$118.75.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   BofA CEO May Reap $30 Million  
   
 By Peter Sinton  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Bank of America Chief Executive David Coulter could collect well
over $30 million in severance benefits after his bank merges with
NationsBank, according to documents filed with regulators
yesterday.
<TEXT>
<P>
   The two banks have stressed that their combination will be good
for shareholders. That's especially true for a handful of top
executives of the two banks who will receive stock grants and other
compensation guarantees worth well over $100 million even if they
leave voluntarily.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter has the richest parachute package, though he insists he
has no plans to bail out. He told The Chronicle that he is buying a
home in Charlotte, N.C. _ NationsBank's headquarters _ and plans to
eventually succeed NationsBank's Hugh McColl, 63, as boss of the
biggest and first coast-to-coast U.S. bank.
</P>
<P>
   Coulter, 51, will be the No. 2 executive of the combined bank
but he is guaranteed the same pay as McColl for the next five years
and a minimum annual base salary of $1.5 million. Suggesting that
the deal was more an acquisition by NationsBank than a merger of
equals, McColl received no similar guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   As part of his employment agreement, Coulter also received a
grant of 300,000 shares of stock in the new BankAmerica (worth
approximately $23 million), according to proxy materials filed
yesterday with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Stock
appreciation rights on options granted last year are worth an
additional $19.6 million.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, if Coulter leaves ``for any reason'' he will get
annual retirement benefits equal to 95 percent of his base salary
and bonus last year. That works out to about $5 million. Rounding
out his severance package are free medical and dental benefits
coverage for life for Coulter, his spouse and dependents.
</P>
<P>
   The proxy statement, which will be mailed to shareholders next
week, says it is the present intention of the board of directors of
both banks as well as McColl that Coulter becomes the next CEO.
</P>
<P>
   But some observers feel the rewards for leaving will be too
great to ignore. ``This is one of the most munificent severance
plans in the history of the universe,'' said compensation
consultant Bud Crystal. ``If Coulter stays on he should be fired
for stupidity.''
</P>
<P>
   The compensation packages also are plush for four other top
executives of both banks. These include BofA Vice Chairman and
Chief Financial Officer Michael O'Neill and his NationsBank
counterpart James H. Hance, Jr., who first discussed linking the
two banks in a mid-March phone conversation.
</P>
<P>
   This pair plus BofA corporate banking chief Michael Murray and
NationsBank retail banking chief Kenneth Lewis were granted 200,000
shares of stock worth about $15 million each. They were also
guaranteed base salaries of at least $1 million annually for three
years.
</P>
<P>
   &UR;  &LR; Murray, 54; Hance, 53; O'Neill, 51; and Lewis, 50, were
granted annual retirement benefits of at least $2 million a year.
And like Coulter, they received medical and dental benefits for
life for themselves and their dependents.
</P>
<P>
   The combined bank even agreed to reimburse the five executives
some tax payments if their employment agreements expose them to
particularly onerous tax liability.
</P>
<P>
   The investment banks who helped structure the deal will do well,
too. BankAmerica adviser Goldman Sachs will receive at least $27.5
million and NationsBank adviser Merrill Lynch will get at least
$28.3 million.
</P>
<P>
   Total merger and restructuring costs are estimated to total $1.3
billion ($800 million after taxes). But within two years the
combined bank expects to save $1.3 billion after taxes annually as
a result of reduced costs and operating efficiencies. A big chunk
of the cost cuts will come from eliminating an estimated 5,000 to
8,000 jobs out of the total of 180,000.

Amazon.com Acquires 2 Internet Firms 
 
By Jamie Beckett Amazon.com announced two acquisitions yesterday that could help
turn the online bookseller into an Internet shopping mall.
<TEXT>
<P>
   Taking advantage of its high-flying stock, Amazon.com said it
will issue 2.4 million new shares worth about $280 million to buy
two Internet firms _ Sunnyvale-based Junglee and PlanetAll of
Cambridge, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   Junglee makes the ``virtual database,'' a software program that
lets Internet surfers comparison shop.
</P>
<P>
   PlanetAll provides a Web-based address book, calendar and
reminder service to 1.5 million subscribers.
</P>
<P>
   ``The long-term vision is a person should be able to come to
Amazon.com and find any product they may want to buy,'' said David
Risher, senior vice president of marketing and product development
at the Seattle-based company.
</P>
<P>
   Wall Street seemed to like the idea. Amazon.com's shares rose
$1.63 to $109.88 on a day when most technology stocks suffered
heavy losses.
</P>
<P>
   ``Amazon.com has the ability to become an Internet mall,'' said
Mark Peabody, a research analyst at the Aberdeen Group in Boston.
Its well-known brand name can attract shoppers looking for items
other than the books and CDs it now sells, Peabody said.
</P>
<P>
   By offering more varied merchandise, such as the computer
hardware and software, clothing and gifts now offered by Junglee,
Amazon.com can attract more shoppers _ and more advertisers, said
Alexis de Planque, an analyst at the Meta Group in Waltham, Mass.
</P>
<P>
   For advertisers, ``it's not enough to just get people to the
store. It's how long they stay there,'' said de Planque. With
reminders about family birthdays and special events and other
services, PlanetAll gives Web surfers another reason to visit
Amazon's site as well as more to do there, she said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon will issue 1.6 million shares worth about $173.2 million
for Junglee and 800,000 shares valued at about $86.6 million for
PlanetAll. It also will assume the companies' options obligations.
The acquisitions will dilute Amazon's outstanding shares by about 6
percent, the company said.
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com lost $21 million on sales of $116 million in the
latest quarter, although much of the loss was due to three smaller
acquisitions announced in April.
</P>
<P>
   Privately held Junglee was founded in 1996 by a group of
Stanford students and is now available on Yahoo, Snap and other
Internet gateways. Junglee aggregates thousands of job listings and
products from dozens of merchants, including such Amazon
competitors as Barnes and Noble and Borders Books.
</P>
<P>
   Ram Shriram, Junglee president and chief operating officer, said
he expected to be able to continue carrying goods offered by Amazon
competitors.
</P>
<P>
   When the acquisition is completed, the Sunnyvale company will
move to Seattle. All 60 employees have been offered the chance to
move, said Shriram.
</P>
<P>
   By joining forces with Amazon, Junglee can extend its reach
further than it would have on its own, he said.
</P>
<P>
   PlanetAll, a privately held 40-person company, will remain in
Cambridge.

ROBBINS, THE LEGEND WHO WAS HUMAN 
</HEADLINE>
   (For release Sunday, Aug. 9.)  
(jw) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   When Jerome Robbins, dancer and choreographer extraordinaire of
ballets and Broadway shows, died recently, the dance and theater
communities responded with grief _ and stories, hundreds of them,
about a man who had become a legend in his world and beyond. There
were memories of yelling and hugs, of harsh words and gentle ones,
small moments and large. Here are some of them.
</P>
<P>
   ELIOT FELD Founder of Eliot Feld's Ballet Tech company
</P>
<P>
   Jerry always made you feel he knew something you didn't. He had
a secret. Something he was after that was special, that he felt
very much to be necessary.
</P>
<P>
   It was like being in a storm. Trust was instinctive. He was the
general. He had the plan, the reason. The work came first.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry was a very interesting mix. He was a master of the ballet
vocabulary, a European tradition. But he was also fascinated in and
engaged by the vernacular: what it felt like to be here, an
American. He explored the extremes of both. He also tried to forge
a unity with subjects that fused the venerable traditions of ballet
and the feelings he had about being in Manhattan, living in
Weehawken, N.J., being a Jew.
</P>
<P>
   You don't feel the difference in class in Jerry's ballets. In a
sense, we're all peasants in Jerry's ballets. We come from the real
world. We're not aristocrats.
</P>
<P>
   In Ballet Theater, I had choreographed two dances that became
two movements in ``Harbinger,'' my first ballet. I didn't know what
I had done. I asked Jerry to come look at it. In the studio, he was
kind of trying to get far away to see it, behind the barre, against
the wall, looking. In his presence, Erin Martin and I managed to
get through the duet for the first time. We fell on the floor
gasping and writhing. I remember Jerry laughing and laughing. He
had a wonderful laugh. He spoke to Lucia Chase, the director of
Ballet Theater, and told her that she should give me time to work.
Jerry is the reason I got to choreograph at Ballet Theater.
</P>
<P>
   HAROLD PRINCE Director and former producer
</P>
<P>
   Agnes de Mille started integrating dance as part of the
storytelling in the musicals she choreographed. However seamless
the move from book to dance was, she substituted principal dancers
for principal actor-singers. Jerry took the process a giant step
further and required his actors to dance as well as sing. In ``West
Side Story'' (Prince was a co-producer of the show), the entire
company filled all three assignments.
</P>
<P>
   From the first day of his rehearsals, Jerry put his companies in
touch with larger issues _ social and political _ surrounding the
subjects of his shows: i.e., on ``West Side Story,'' the Jets and
Sharks were isolated from each other. Newspaper and magazine
material illustrating gang life and gang warfare in the streets of
New York was plastered on the rehearsal walls and members were
encouraged not to socialize away from their respective gangs during
rehearsals and on their own time.
</P>
<P>
   On the first day of rehearsals for ``Fiddler on the Roof''
(Prince produced the musical), Jerry took the company through
exercises, two of which I remember vividly. One involved what it
would be like for a black person to purchase a book in a segregated
bookstore in the South. The other involved day-to-day living in a
concentration camp.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry stubbornly refused to have the dancing in ``Fiddler''
appear to be choreographed. Whenever possible, he wanted it to seem
like improvised natural human behavior. And he succeeded. He was
always conscious of metaphor in charting the course of a
production.
</P>
<P>
   JENNIFER TIPTON Lighting designer
</P>
<P>
   (Ms. Tipton lighted most of Robbins' ballets, beginning in the
1970s, as well as the 1989 Broadway revue ``Jerome Robbins'
Broadway.'')
</P>
<P>
   I think he made ballet American. In working with Jerry, whatever
he did, he managed to tell the story through movement. And there
are very few young choreographers who do that. In theater, he began
the whole idea of telling serious stories through movement. And I
don't think there is anybody else doing that.
</P>
<P>
   I found him remarkable. Even as he got older. For all of us, our
eyesight is not so good as we grow older. But I often found he saw
things better than I did. Without eyeglasses. I'd think, ``How can
he see that?'' But he'd be right.
</P>
<P>
   He had an uncanny sense about what things needed to be to make
them clear. We would discuss how it should be. I learned early on I
should defer to him because he was always right.
</P>
<P>
   You work with people who let you alone and people who are very
interested. He was always one of the interested ones.
</P>
<P>
   PETER MARTINS Ballet master in chief, New York City Ballet
</P>
<P>
   After ``Songs of the Auvergne'' (a ballet by Martins that
features children), Jerry came backstage and was very enthusiastic.
He thought it was wonderful: ``But, get rid of the kids.''
</P>
<P>
   He was the last of the titans in the world of dance. He will
live on through his ballets, by which the next generation will come
to know him and appreciate him as we have. He regarded New York
City Ballet as his family, and he will always remain so to us.
</P>
<P>
   TONY WALTON Stage designer and director
</P>
<P>
   He was the giant of our musical theater, as everybody from Fosse
on would admit. He was the nonpareil; incredibly complex socially,
and professionally difficult indeed, but more than worth it.
</P>
<P>
   (Walton designed the sets and costumes for the original 1962
Broadway production of ``A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the
Forum.'' The show was supposed to be directed by Robbins, but he
dropped out and George Abbott was brought in. When the musical was
trying out, Robbins came back and, uncredited, restaged some of it,
putting in the famous opening number, ``Comedy Tonight.'')
</P>
<P>
   When Jerry came in, we thought he would fire us all. He couldn't
have been more charming. And he made use of every little piece of
prop and costumes and turned it into a magical opening number. The
only difficulty: he said about the soldiers, sailors and eunuchs,
``I'm not sure we have the best costumes for them.'' A week before
we opened in New York, I said there was barely enough time to do
the costumes. He said, ``Remind me what was wrong with what we've
got.''
</P>
<P>
   With ``The Apple Tree,'' he came in at Mike Nichols' invitation.
Mike didn't think he could do anything more with it.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry watched it and said, ``I think you have everything you can
get from the show.'' But he had made some notes, so Mike said,
``Read them to the company.'' Jerry said, ``I'll give them to
you.'' Mike asked him again to read them to the company. Jerry took
out a pad and read 200 to 300 notes, beginning with, ``If Eve came
on stage carrying a brown towel and not a yellow towel, that would
get a laugh.'' Everything he said was right.
</P>

<P>
</P>
<P>
   SHELDON HARNICK Lyricist and librettist
</P>
<P>
   I think his legacy, of course, will be the extraordinary
repertory of ballets he created and some of the musicals _ ``West
Side Story'' and ``Fiddler on the Roof'' _ because he not only
directed them but helped shape them and gave them the form they
eventually assumed on stage.
</P>
<P>
   We were out on the road with ``Fiddler,'' before we came into
New York. Our star was Zero Mostel. Zero was given to embroidering
bits of business. When Zero sang ``If I Were a Rich Man,'' Jerry
gave him a bit of business: he looks up, sighs, and one arm drops
into a barrel of milk. He fishes out the sleeve and looks at it in
a melancholy way. One more thing from God to deal with. He wrings
out the sleeve.
</P>
<P>
   In three or four days, he had made a five-minute bit of business
out of what to do with a wet sleeve. The song went out the window.
The show went out the window. On the fourth or fifth night, he
looked up, dropped his arm and pulled it up startled. The sleeve
was dry. Jerry had taken the milk out of the barrel.
</P>
<P>
   MURIEL BENTLEY
</P>
<P>
   A dancer with Ballet Theater in the 1940s and with Jerome
Robbins' Ballets: USA in the 1950s
</P>
<P>
   (Ms. Bentley was particularly known for her comic gifts. She
created the part of one of the two lead female roles in Robbins'
1944 ``Fancy Free,'' his first ballet, which soon became his first
Broadway musical, ``On the Town.'' The dancers she refers to as the
first sailors are John Kriza, Harold Lang and Robbins himself.)
</P>
<P>
   If people would go to the ballet, to the theater, and keep
supporting them, that would be Jerry's legacy.
</P>
<P>
   I was his patsy in ``Fancy Free.'' He was a stickler for
perfection. He would say, ``This is what I want, this is the way I
want it.'' He needled me a lot because he knew me well and knew
what he would get out of me.
</P>
<P>
   We rehearsed from coast to coast on tour, daily, whenever Jerry
could get a ballroom or a studio.
</P>
<P>
   My role was modeled after me. The way I walked, the way I
talked. It was like patent leather, shiny and bright and crisp.
Johnny was Johnny, Harold was the little butch acrobat and Jerry
was the sleek Rudolph Valentino. Johnny was the sweet guy who would
always pay the check. Harold was devil-may-care: ``What the hell,
I'll jump off the barn into a split.'' The girls, we were friends.
</P>
<P>
   I don't think we had time to think about whether ``Fancy Free''
would be a hit or not. We were working with Jerry. It was his first
ballet. It was exciting. Until the curtain came down. It was the
most incredible thing. There were 20 curtain calls. Over and over.
Jerry would say, ``You go.'' We'd say, ``No, you go.''
</P>
<P>
   My memories of Jerry are mostly good. The bad ones we don't talk
about now. We just have to remember that he was brilliant, very
talented, confused, mixed up. All the things that talented people
are.
</P>
<P>
   When he showed ``Fancy Free'' to Sol Hurok, I made my entrance
and Jerry said: ``Please go back. You look like you're going down
the street for a salami sandwich.''
</P>
<P>
   I burst out crying. But I went back and did my entrance again.
</P>
<P>
   ROBERT WILSON Director and designer
</P>
<P>
   I was Jerry's assistant for a while in 1966 or 1967. He was
developing a project on John Kennedy's assassination. I did
research, built a model for the architectural space where it could
happen. I also developed a model space for Jerry's American Theater
Lab.
</P>
<P>
   Jerry is certainly an influence on my work. Martha Graham said
all theater is dance. I feel the same way in my theater. I learned
that from Jerry. What he did, whether ``West Side Story'' or
whatever, the whole thing is dance.
</P>
<P>
   In the late '60s I studied a Brecht project with him. He
introduced me to Noh theater. He was thinking about it in terms of
dance.
</P>
<P>
   My problem with most of the theater I see is that it is an
illustration or decoration of what I see. We haven't adequately
developed a visual book in theater.
</P>
<P>
   In Jerry's way of looking at theater, he thought of it in terms
of the architecture, the visual book. His musicals say conceived by
Jerome Robbins.
</P>
<P>
   The first time I went with Jerry to the ballet, we were talking
afterward. He was disturbed by some of the dancers. He asked me if
the dancing had seemed wrong to me. I said yes. He asked why. I
said I couldn't say, that I didn't know. ``The weight is not in the
movement,'' he said. And he said to me once: ``You have to learn to
stand on the stage. You have to learn how to walk, which you do by
walking.''
</P>
<P>
   ADOLPH GREEN Lyricist and librettist
</P>
<P>
   His legacy is so big I can't even start focusing on it. It was
really bringing the full 20th century into the world of ballet
without obscuring the ballet itself. Casting pictures of our ways
of life and behavior that became instantly a permanent picture.
And, of course, he was imbued with a fantastic gift for well-known
balletic forms, which he never looked down on. And the forms became
more and more pure.
</P>
<P>
   ``Brandenburg'' (Robbins' last ballet) was a gorgeous work, and
pure. And yet some of his most anecdotal work is just as filled
with integrity _ and never reaching for easy vaudeville and
nightclub laughter. It had a sharpness that hit you instantly and
remained. He continued that work in the theater. His ballet numbers
were mainly on the comical side. But nothing ever came out with
false whimsy. He was incapable of being cute or coy. It was never
easy laughter.
</P>
<P>
   We did five or so shows together, one way or another. We were
always thrilled, no matter what little differences there were. The
theater is made of little personality clashes. When it works out,
they are forgotten easily. When it doesn't, they are forgotten.
</P>
<P>
   CHITA RIVERA Actress, dancer and singer
</P>
<P>
   I totally trusted his love for me and he knew I loved and adored
him. I've lost a father, teacher and eternal friend. He gave me my
spirit of the theater, the freedom to find and express myself
through dance. He started my career with ``Call Me Madam'' and gave
me the icing with ``West Side Story.'' He was my first acting
teacher. His beautiful smile and contagious laugh will stay with
me. He was a genius and will always be my Big Daddy.
</P>
<P>
   HELGI TOMASSON Artistic director of the San Francisco Ballet
</P>
<P>
   (Tomasson, who was born in Iceland, credits Robbins with his
career at City Ballet. He created roles in many of Robbins'
ballets, including ``The Goldberg Variations,'' ``The Dybbuk
Variations'' and ``Chansons Madecasses.'' He was seen often in
``Dances at a Gathering'' and ``Other Dances,'' all in the 1970s.)
</P>
<P>
   I remember that Jerry always made sure that you brought the
audience into what you were doing. You did not go out to them. You
had to have a tremendous amount of concentration. And you did it
for the dance itself. He didn't want you to go out there and ``sell
it.'' And I think that shows.
</P>
<P>
   There were times when he would say, ``Trust me, trust what I'm
doing, trust my choreography.'' Sometimes dancers embellish, which
leads to changes. He didn't.
</P>
<P>
   He kept things to himself. Usually, when he was starting out
working on something, he did not want to give you images. He didn't
want to let you know too much. But with ``Dybbuk,'' I do remember
that he gave Patricia McBride, the other lead, and me the book to
read. Obviously, in this case, he wanted us to know the story.
</P>
<P>
   He was a lot of fun when you were with him socially, in a small
group having dinner. He was a wonderful person, a lot of laughs.
Everyone talks about how difficult he was. And he could be. But I
think there was a much more generous side to him that people didn't
know about.
</P>
<P>
   In 1969, when I was dancing with the Harkness Ballet, I entered
the Moscow competition. Jerry had basically brought me to the
United States on a scholarship. I asked if he would choreograph a
solo for me for the competition. He said he was too busy, but would
see what he could do. He was choreographing this ballet for City
Ballet and there were a couple of variations that might be very
suitable. He told me to come and look.
</P>
<P>
   He picked the second solo in the ballet, which was ``Dances at a
Gathering.'' I seem to remember he worked with me on it a little.
Then he told me to come down to the stage of the New York State
Theater. It was empty. For some reason he had dug up Lincoln
Kirstein. They both sat out there. I did the variation. He said:
``Good, fine. You can do that.'' I think it was the only time a
Robbins ballet was seen in a competition.
</P>
<P>
   KRISTINA FERNANDEZ Dancer
</P>
<P>
   (Ms. Fernandez, 22, danced in ``Two and Three Part Inventions,''
which Robbins made in 1994 at the School of American Ballet when
she was a student. They corresponded for a time. She now dances
with New York City Ballet.)
</P>
<P>
   Jerry taught me to trust myself and to go with my instincts and
my feelings, and not to be afraid of that. He taught me to relax,
that you don't need to try so hard; that what was more important
than anything was what comes from inside.
</P>
<P>
   You hear so much about the other things today, about the
technique. I had started to think that that was more important and
he reassured me that dance is an art. Of course, the technique is
important, but you can't forget where it comes from.

ANALYSIS: TRADING WON'T BE HALTED UNLESS DROP IS HUGE 
</HEADLINE>
  
 (subs to drop `huge' from lede)  (With MARKET-NYT) 
(bl) 
 By DAVID BARBOZA   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ What will happen when trading starts Wednesday if
investors return for a second act much like Tuesday's selloff? &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The answer: trading will not be halted, as it was last Oct. 27,
and the financial exchanges will do little to intervene in the
buying and selling of shares unless the selling reaches epic
proportions for a single session, with a drop of greater than 10
percent in the Dow Jones industrial average, something that has
occurred just twice: in October 1929 and October 1987. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   That's because regulators and the operators of the nation's
financial exchanges have decided that trading should be disrupted
only when the market suffers an extraordinarily large decline. That
view suggests that an earlier rule, adopted after the 1987 stock
market crash but revised earlier this year, was too restrictive. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   In the event of a huge decline, however, the suspension or halt
in trading is supposed to give investors a respite from panic
driven selling. So the New York Stock Exchange, the Nasdaq and
other American exchanges will remain open Wednesday unless a huge
selloff drops the Dow _ the most widely followed market barometer _
by about 10, 20 or 30 percent. Such a decline, if it were to come,
would erase more than a year's worth of gains in a single day. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Sharp selloffs of one, two or even nine percentage points over
consecutive days don't count. It's just the one big swoop that
regulators fear could be unnerving and possibly calamitous. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The New York Stock Exchange, which suspended and then halted
trading last Oct. 27 after the Dow fell 350 points and then more
than 550 points, has with regulatory approval this year instituted
new, less restrictive rules that now call for a one hour trading
suspension if the Dow falls 900 points before 2 p.m. Steeper falls
at varying times of the day would result in an array of trading
suspensions. But a drop of 2,650 points would end trading for the
day. Each quarter, the Big Board recalibrates those point figures
to approximate a 10, 20 or 30 percent drop in the Dow. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Those are the rules, and the New York Stock Exchange says it
doesn't speculate about whether they'll be triggered or not. ``We
don't comment on the ups and downs in the market,'' said Richard
Adamonis, a spokesman for the Big Board. As for the circuit
breakers, Tuesday's drop of 299.43 points was not even ``in the
woods'' as far as triggering a trading halt, he said. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   A year ago, a 350-point drop would have been sufficient for a
trading halt; now, only market mayhem would do so. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The original circuit breaker rules went into effect a year after
the stock market crash of Oct. 19, 1987, when the Dow plunged 508
points, or 22.3 percent. But until recently, the Big Board had
clung to point scales, which meant less and less in percentage
terms as the Dow climbed from its low of 1,738.41 after the 1987
crash to a record 9,337.97 set July 17. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   When the Dow fell 554 points last Oct. 27, it amounted to a
decline of about 7.2 percent. With the Dow now at 8,487.31, the
900-point trigger would push it as low as 7,587.31, a 10.6 percent
drop and a level not seen since January. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   One worrisome sign, though, is that volume on the Big Board and
the Nasdaq has been extraordinarily high, particularly for the
summer months. More than 834 million shares traded hands Tuesday on
the Big Board, the most since a record 1.2 billion shares traded on
Oct. 28, as the market soared after the big 554-point plunge. On
the Nasdaq, volume Tuesday was 913 million shares, the tenth
largest daily volume figure in the market's history. The average
daily volume has been climbing for several weeks. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Heavy and bearish trading activity has caused most of the major
stock indexes to drop nearly 10 percent from their all-time highs,
some set just weeks ago. And Tuesday's decline for the Dow and the
Standard &AMP; Poor's 500-stock index was the third consecutive day
prices on those indexes fell more than a percent, a rare occurrence
for a major market barometer. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Big Board does have trading restrictions on arbitrageurs,
which go into effect after the Dow rises or falls more than 50
points in a day, but those restrictions are put in place almost
daily, and have not prevented huge swings in prices this year,
making it one of the most volatile periods in years. &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Mutual fund companies, though, seemed less concerned about
circuit breakers, which now seem even less of a factor, and more
about being prepared for a flood of telephone calls from jittery
investors.  &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``We're not so much concerned about the circuit breakers as we
are the call volume,'' said Brian Mattes, a spokesman for the
Vanguard Group. ``There's no call out to our Swiss army,'' he said
of the extras who would help man the phone in an emergency, ``but
we'll see how things go and if we need them, we'll call them out.''

SUNBEAM REACHES DEAL WITH DUNLAP TO FIGHT LAWSUITS, SEC
INVESTIGATION 
</HEADLINE>
 (nk) 
 By DANA CANEDY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The Sunbeam Corp. and Albert J. Dunlap, who was dismissed as
chairman and chief executive of the troubled appliance maker,
reached an agreement on Tuesday to work together to fight a string
of shareholder lawsuits against the company and to cooperate in an
investigation into the company's accounting practices. Dunlap also
agreed to resign from the board.
</P>
<P>
   The agreements mark the first time since his dismissal in June
that Dunlap and the board _ which is fighting his claim to
severance _ have agreed to work together to resolve issues still
pending from his nearly two-year tenure at Sunbeam. The deal also
indicates that the two sides are now communicating in a more
cooperative fashion, which could eventually ease the way for
hammering out a settlement on the severance issue.
</P>
<P>
   ``They signed a cooperative agreement whereby Al and the company
have agreed to share information and legal strategies with respect
to all shareholder lawsuits and any ongoing investigations'' by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, said Gene Donati, a spokesman
for Dunlap.
</P>
<P>
   Dunlap has also agreed to put on hold his claim to severance,
but he will be paid for an undetermined number of weeks of accrued
vacation time, according to a person involved in the negotiations
on his behalf who spoke on the condition of anonymity. Russell
Kersh, the former Sunbeam vice chairman and chief financial officer
who was dismissed shortly after Dunlap, reached an identical
agreement with Sunbeam and will also resign from the board.
</P>
<P>
   George Sard, a spokesman for Sunbeam, declined to comment on the
deals. But a person involved in the negotiations said the company
realized it needed Dunlap's cooperation to defend the company
against the lawsuits and the SEC investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``It is obvious the company no longer felt it had a legal basis
to pursue its defenses without Al,'' this person said, adding that
Dunlap has maintained all along that he took ``arms length''
guidance from the company's auditors on the financial results that
are now in question.
</P>
<P>
   A person close to Sunbeam, however, said that the goal in
reaching an agreement was simply to remove Dunlap and Kersh from
the board.
</P>
<P>
   Sunbeam faces lawsuits by shareholders who contend they were
misled about the company's health. They point, in particular, to an
``early buy'' program under which the company sold $50-million
worth of barbecue grills last December and gave retailers until
this past June to pay for them. The shareholders say the promotion
artificially inflated the company's fourth-quarter results at the
expense of the first quarter's numbers. The company and Dunlap have
denied the allegation.
</P>
<P>
   The SEC investigation centers on various possible accounting
irregularities, including some that may be related to the grill
program. The company is doing its own investigation of its books.

 (For use by clients of the New York Times News Service)   Was Yesterday's Plunge a Dip or the Beginning of the End?  
   
 By Mark Veverka  
 c.1998 San Francisco Chronicle  
 
Was yesterday's drop in the stock market a dip or the start of a
precipitous slide?
<TEXT>
<P>
   ``I guess I view it as a tired market,'' says Dick Earnest, fund
manager of Union Bank of California's HighMark Value Momentum Fund.
</P>
<P>
   Whether tired or beaten, Asia is pounding U.S. stocks. And
``while earnings aren't falling apart, they aren't running at the
same rate that they were,'' Earnest says.
</P>
<P>
   The veteran stockpicker wasn't overly concerned with the 3.4
percent dive in the Dow, nor was he prepared to dismiss yesterday's
sell-off as a one-day event, either.
</P>
<P>
   ``Days like this are very painful. We're in for a struggle
here,'' Earnest notes.
</P>
<P>
   He's got that right. Other fund managers and market strategists
are also stepping lightly. Nobody's quite sure that it's safe to
jump back into the pool.
</P>
<P>
   Yet for those investors compelled to buy on the dip _ and who
therefore are convinced this slide is just another minor setback _
Earnest has some favorites in housing, retail, publishing and the
oil patch.
</P>
<P>
   He likes mobile home-maker Fleetwood, Federated Department
Stores, publisher McGraw-Hill and oil-field services firm Dresser
Industries, which is being bought by rival Haliburton.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think the price of oil is going to come around,'' Earnest
says.
</P>
<P>
   Spoken like an eternal optimist.
</P>
<P>
   Timing Is Everything
</P>
<P>
   It appears that privately held InsWeb, an Internet Web site
devoted to selling insurance, is moving up the timetable on when it
may go public.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps realizing that Internet madness isn't likely to remain a
permanent phenomenon in this jittery market, chief executive
Hussein Enan intimated to investors in San Francisco yesterday that
the San Mateo company may file for an IPO sooner rather than later.
In a previous column, Enan said the 3-year-old company would wait
until sometime next year.
</P>
<P>
   But time is of the essence as the IPO market is showing signs of
fatigue. One indicator that InsWeb is readying for a possible IPO
is that it has hired a new chief executive.
</P>
<P>
   Enan, told a packed room at the BancAmerica Robertson Stephens
Millenium stock conference that he's hired investment banker Steven
Robertson of Lehman Bros. for the slot. (Yes, his name drew yucks
from the crowd because it sounds like the host banking firm
backwards). Robertson has specialized in insurance at other major
investment banks as well, giving him a pedigree that should agree
with potential underwriters and investors.
</P>
<P>
   InsWeb was scheduled directly against another well-attended
presentation of a privately held firm testing the public waters:
TheStreet.com.
</P>
<P>
   Robby-Lite
</P>
<P>
   Down Highway 101 a piece, three tech companies are holding an
investor conference of their own today. Riding piggyback on the
two-day Robby Stephens affair, Excite, BroadVision and Preview
Travel hope to draw conference attendees to Redwood City where the
companies are presenting self-directed financial outlooks. (Excite
and BroadVision are neighbors in the same office park).
</P>
<P>
   And while there's nothing unusual about companies hosting such
schmooze-fests with institutional holders, it is somewhat unique
that three unrelated companies would collaborate on such an event,
says Peter Downs, head of investor relations for BroadVision.
</P>
<P>
   But then again, each of the companies hope their command
performances will get them heard above the din. Especially Excite,
which has been in the shadow of Yahoo and has been the odd-man out
lately with big media companies making headline-grabbing
investments in rivals Cnet and Infoseek.
</P>
<P>
   Still, despite yesterday's market meltdown, all three firms
should be pretty upbeat. Each of their stocks bucked the sell-off.
Excite, the search engine, closed up $2.50 at $38.50; BroadVision,
the software developer, closed up $1.875 at $19.75; and San
Francisco-based Preview Travel closed up $1.88 at $23.88.
</P>
<P>
   Talk about good timing.

PRESIDENT TRIPLE-TEAMS HIS LEWINSKY PROBLEM
</HEADLINE>
   (See also CLINTON-STARR) 
(jw) 
 By RICHARD W. STEVENSON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ For all the learned analysis and salacious gossip
about impeachment and stained dresses, for all the partisans
holding forth on the news and talk shows, it may well be that the
only people outside his family who really know what President
Clinton plans to tell a federal grand jury about his relationship
with Monica Lewinsky are three savvy lawyers. And they have kept it
all to themselves.
</P>
<P>
   As Clinton's private lawyers, David Kendall, Mickey Kantor and
Nicole Seligman are the keepers of some of the most sensitive
information in Washington. They are all described by current and
former White House officials as enjoying Clinton's total trust.
</P>
<P>
   The president's reliance on so small a group _ a marked contrast
to his usual style of reaching out to as many advisers as possible
_ has only been intensified in recent days: court rulings of late
have held that he does not enjoy the confidentiality of the
lawyer-client relationship with government employees, including
Bruce Lindsey, a deputy White House counsel who is one of his most
trusted aides.
</P>
<P>
   Just today Lanny Breuer, a special White House counsel, appeared
before the grand jury, and administration officials said it was not
out of the question that Charles Ruff, a former Watergate
prosecutor who heads the counsel's office and has been deeply
involved in many issues related to the Lewinsky case, could be
required to testify as well.
</P>
<P>
   The administration has fought vigorously to maintain the
confidentiality of a president's deliberations with his
taxpayer-paid lawyers, and White House officials said the success
on the issue enjoyed by the independent counsel could complicate
and circumscribe the roles being played by Ruff, Breuer, Lindsey
and Cheryl Mills, another lawyer in Ruff's office.
</P>
<P>
   Kendall, Kantor and Miss Seligman hold a conference call once or
twice a day with Ruff and his deputies, who in turn meet each day
with the senior White House staff. But the private lawyers and Ruff
have kept a tight lid on what Clinton has told them, and White
House officials admit that they know little about how the legal
team is operating.
</P>
<P>
   Administration officials say it is clear, though, that Kendall,
a partner at Williams and Connolly, is in charge of Clinton's
defense.
</P>
<P>
   Reserved, unpretentious and a Yale Law School colleague of Bill
Clinton and Hillary Rodham, Kendall has won the full confidence of
the Clintons over the five years he has represented them in the
Whitewater investigation, current and former administration
officials say. But there has been grumbling among political
advisers at the White House that he has been too slow to battle it
out in public with Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, and too
sanguine about the consequences of keeping the White House staff in
the dark about developments in the case, including Starr's subpoena
of the president.
</P>
<P>
   ``David Kendall's concern is the legal protection of the
president, and, although he has a better public relations sense
than he's given credit for, he would prefer to protect the
president and lose the p.r. war,'' said Mandy Grunwald, a former
aide to Clinton. ``The instinct in the White House is to win every
news cycle. David has a much more long-term view.''
</P>
<P>
   Kantor, who served Clinton as trade negotiator and then commerce
secretary before leaving the administration last year, is also a
central member of the team, although he is much less involved on a
day-to-day basis than Kendall, administration officials said. As
much a friend to the Clintons as he is a legal adviser, he helped
Clinton survive claims of an extramarital affair by Gennifer
Flowers early in the 1992 campaign and is widely assumed to be
advising the president on the politics of his current plight.
</P>
<P>
   ``The president is used to soliciting dozens of opinions, and he
enjoys listening to people with different points of view and
synthesizing different pieces of advice,'' Ms. Grunwald said. ``In
Mickey he gets somebody he personally trusts, but he also gets
political wisdom without legal risk, which is a very rare commodity
for him these days.''
</P>
<P>
   Miss Seligman, the least-well-known member of the team, cut her
teeth in Washington helping to defend Oliver North in the
Iran-Contra case, an experience that exposed her to the
rough-and-tumble of ideological politics in Washington as well as
the pressures of a high-stakes legal battle against a special
prosecutor. She is a former editor at The Asian Wall Street
Journal, a onetime law clerk at the Supreme Court for Justice
Thurgood Marshall and now, like Kendall, a partner at Williams and
Connolly.
</P>
<P>
   ``She's seen every aspect of fighting independent counsels and
won,'' said Brendan Sullivan Jr., who headed North's defense and
worked closely with Miss Seligman on the case. ``She knows what
she's doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Other lawyers, including Robert Bennett, who represented Clinton
in the lawsuit filed against him by Paula Jones, continue to play a
role behind the scenes mapping strategy. W. Neil Eggleston, a
special counsel for the White House, has argued the
administration's case on issues of executive privilege and
lawyer-client privilege. And White House officials say they assume
that Mrs. Clinton has tremendous influence over how the president
will proceed.
</P>
<P>
   So far, Kendall, Kantor and Miss Seligman appear to have worked
in relative harmony with one another and with Ruff and his staff.
</P>
<P>
   ``Like any team they have their tensions, but there's basically
a sense of all being responsible for serving one person,'' said one
senior administration official, who said each of the lawyers had a
fairly well defined role.
</P>
<P>
   ``David is the personal attorney,'' he said. ``Ruff is the key
link in the fence between the inside legal and political teams and
the outside lawyers. And Mickey is friend and counselor.''
</P>
<P>
   Kendall has often come across to the battle-hardened political
combatants in the White House as too willing to take a punch
without responding, a serious failing in a culture that prides
itself on campaign-style rapid response to every issue.
</P>
<P>
   In many ways, White House officials were more comfortable with
Bennett's street-fighting style in defending Clinton against Ms.
Jones' lawsuit. But Kendall has proved willing to go at it in some
circumstances with Starr, as when he accused the prosecutor's
office of leaking grand jury information. And Kendall's colleagues
say his equanimity will be a great advantage in a case that has
taken all kinds of unexpected twists and turns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I saw him recently in the hallway, and I thought of that old
Nixon cartoon: `Why is this man smiling?''' said Steve Umin, a
partner of Kendall at Williams and Connolly. ``I would have thought
the burdens would be tremendous. But he's got a very cheerful
disposition generally. He's not a mercurial personality. He's able
to take the ups and downs with great aplomb.''

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ After months of shrugging off bad economic news from
Asia and a slowdown in corporate profits in the United States,
investors stampeded out of stocks on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The Dow Jones industrial average plummeted nearly 300 points, or
3.41 percent, and other market gauges were down sharply. While up
7.32 percent since the beginning of the year, the Dow is now down
9.1 percent from its peak on July 17.
</P>
<P>
   The Nasdaq composite index, with its heavy weighting in
technology and financial stocks, is the only major index that can
be said to be in a correction. It has lost 11.3 percent of its
value from its July peak. Nasdaq lost more than 65 points on
Tuesday, or 3.54 percent. Even so, the index is up almost 14
percent this year.
</P>
<P>
   There was no single reason identified as the culprit behind the
market's plunge. Rather, investors seemed suddenly to give credence
to a series of red flags that had been waving for some time.
</P>
<P>
   For example, the economic meltdown in Asia has translated into a
sizable drop in demand for American products. Economic growth in
the United States slowed to a 1.4 percent gain in the second
quarter, down from the 5.5 percent reported in the first quarter.
The strong dollar has wreaked havoc on companies doing business
overseas. Uncertainty over President Clinton's future in the face
of the Monica Lewinsky matter weighed on the market as well.
</P>
<P>
   But perhaps most significant was investors' sudden recognition
that earnings growth, the engine that powers stock prices, is
deteriorating at even the biggest and best-known American
companies. Combine this with an increasingly narrow stock market
advance _ more stocks going down than up _ and the outlook for
stock prices turns decidedly bearish.
</P>
<P>
   ``Investors are finally, finally starting to realize that
earnings growth has slowed,'' said Liz Miller, portfolio manager at
Trevor, Stewart, Burton &AMP; Jacobsen in New York. ``If you have a
weakening underlying economy, profits cannot keep going up.''
</P>
<P>
   Indeed, in recent days, stock market stars such as Procter &AMP;
Gamble and Kellogg have disappointed investors with either
lower-than-expected earnings or warnings of bad news to come. When
the same blue-chip companies that have led the market to
unprecedented valuations begin to lose steam, investors sooner or
later take notice.
</P>
<P>
   There was no sense of panic reported among brokerage firms
Tuesday. Several brokers said that the feeling among their clients
was one of being resigned to a drop in stock prices. Nice though
the heady profits were, investors seemed to think that the stock
market was overdue for a fall.
</P>
<P>
   Neither did mutual fund investors appear to be crowding the
exits. Fidelity Investments, the mutual fund giant, reported that
more money went into funds across the company than left them.
``There was some small movement from equities to money-market
funds,'' said Anne Crowley, a Fidelity spokeswoman, ``but nothing
of consequence.''
</P>
<P>
   The question on everyone's minds Tuesday was where the market's
fall would end. Was this the beginning of an stock market
bloodletting or just a painful correction? A bear market is
considered to have started once stock prices have fallen more than
20 percent from their peaks.

   Volume on the New York Stock Exchange topped 800 million shares,
the largest day of trading this year and the second biggest ever.
Investors fleeing stocks sought refuge in Treasury securities,
driving up the price of the benchmark 30-year bond and depressing
the yield, to 5.63 percent. But this flight to quality was somewhat
muted: bonds traded higher, at a yield of 5.56 percent, about a
month ago.
</P>
<P>
   Only time will tell, of course, whether the market will move
into bear market territory. In recent years, investors have
ploughed back into stocks whenever they have declined, a phenomenon
known as ``buying the dips.'' Whether these investors will once
again consider Tuesday's precipitous drop in equity prices a buying
opportunity remains to be seen.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks began to slide in earnest about noon, when Ralph
Acampora, director of technical research at Prudential Securities
and a longtime bull on stocks, was quoted as saying that the Dow
Jones average could drop 15 to 20 percent from its 1998 highs.
</P>
<P>
   Stocks in all industries took a beating. Those hit hardest were
the banks, down 5.5 percent on average, followed closely by the oil
service sector which lost an average 5.3 percent. Health care
stocks fell an average 4.4 percent, and airline shares lost an
average 3.8 percent.
</P>
<P>
   Warning signs that stock prices might have gotten ahead of
themselves had been evident for weeks, if not months. Before
Tuesday's move, the S&AMP;P 500 had gained 14 percent on the year. Yet
the earnings growth reported by the stocks in the index during the
first half of 1998 came in well below that gain, at about 4
percent. Something had to bring this disparity back into line and
that something was stock prices.
</P>
<P>
   Add to this the fact that labor costs are rising at the same
time that intense competition among companies prevents them from
raising their prices to consumers and corporate profit margins look
particularly vulnerable.
</P>
<P>
   Another straw in the wind pointing to lower stock prices is the
growth in money supply, the total stock of money in the economy.
For the last 18 months, the broadest category of money supply,
known as M3, had been going straight up, reaching a 25-year peak of
8.9 percent growth came in April. Allowing money supply to grow
stimulates the economy and in turn the stock market. A slowdown in
money supply growth, if its turns out to be a long-term trend,
would have the opposite effect.
</P>
<P>
   Sharp-eyed investors may have noticed another sign that stock
prices had hit something of a ceiling. Premiums paid in corporate
takeovers had disappeared in recent months. Indeed, last week's
proposed acquisition of the GTE Corp. by Bell Atlantic offered GTE
shareholders even less than the market price.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, positive earnings surprises in the second quarter
were no longer producing outsized gains in the stocks of companies
reporting them. Indeed, companies with good news saw their stock
prices underperform the S&AMP;P 500. This was an about-face from the
same period in 1997, when companies posting unexpected earnings
gains 10 percent or more above the Wall Street consensus
outperformed the S&AMP;P 500 by 12.5 percent.
</P>
<P>
   One money manager thinks the market has simply worn itself out
moving to new highs in mid-July on a litany of bad news. ``We'd had
a big huge move relative to what had been happening,'' said William
Fleckenstein, president of Fleckenstein Capital in Seattle. ``When
you put that against the deterioration of the market itself, you
could build a case that the market has exhausted itself.''
</P>
<P>
   Painful though any fall in stock prices can be, some money
managers who had been quietly raising cash and taking stock market
profits were unsurprised by the move. To their view, such a drop
was not a matter of if, but when. And if it ratchets down the
exceedingly great expectations investors have come to look for in
stock market returns, these folks say, the market's fall will be
healthy.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were seeing valuations that were absurd relative to
corporate earnings,'' said Elaine Hahn, of Hahn Capital Management
in San Francisco. ``But nobody wanted to listen.''

ACCUSATIONS DRIVE TURBODYNE'S VALUATION DOWN $171.2 MILLION
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
BY BEN SULLIVAN  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles -- Shares in Turbodyne Technologies Inc. plunged
Tuesday, losing more than a third of their value, after a
well-known short-selling investor declared the firm grossly
overvalued and accused company officials of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   The maker of pollution-reduction equipment for automobiles saw
its market capitalization drop by 37 &UR;  &LR; percent, or $171.2 &UR;  &LR; million,
as shares dropped from $15.8125 to $10 in a day of heavy trading.
At one point Tuesday, Turbodyne shares were down 64 &UR;  &LR; percent.
</P>
<P>
   The company has lost 41 &UR;  &LR; percent of its value since Friday, when
shares closed at $17.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's drop came in response to a press release issued by
Asensio &AMP; Co., a New York-based brokerage that specializes in short
selling. Short sellers, betting that a company's stock will fall,
borrow shares, sell them and then replace the shares later with
ones they hope can be bought at a lower price. If the shares do
fall, the short seller gets to keep the difference.
</P>
<P>
   In a blistering statement, Asensio said Turbodyne management
purposely had misled investors about the value of its core
technology ``in order to defraud investors.'' Further, Asensio said
Turbodyne has raised and spent $55 &UR;  &LR; million in equity capital but
has failed to create any new products or generate significant
sales.
</P>
<P>
   ``We believe this gross overvaluation combined with Turbodyne's
complete inability to generate any earnings per share will cause
the stock to fall to well below $1 per share,'' the statement said.
</P>
<P>
   Asensio initiated coverage of Turbodyne on Tuesday with a
``strong sell'' recommendation.
</P>
<P>
   Turbodyne officials could not be reached for comment Tuesday,
although a representative said the firm would issue a response by
the end of the business day. No announcements were made.
</P>
<P>
   Turbodyne spokesman Sven Urbas told Bloomberg News that Asensio
had ``no grounds for this attack. ... This is an obvious strategy
to manipulate the market and profit from short selling.''
</P>
<P>
   Neal Kolhaas, a principal at CSK Securities in San Francisco,
said the claims against Turbodyne are unfounded. CSK manages 30,000
shares of Turbodyne stock for CSK's personal account.
</P>
<P>
   ``This guy has been campaigning against Turbodyne for a long
time,'' Kolhaas said. ``Yes, the company has yet to generate
earnings but it is on track to do so in 1999.''
</P>
<P>
   Last month John Singleton, Turbodyne's former chief operating
officer and chief financial officer, resigned from the company five
months after he started. Though the company has signed a string of
contracts with European cities recently to provide municipal-bus
retrofit equipment, it continued to lose money in the first two
quarters of 1998.
</P>
<P>
   Since October, Turbodyne's major shareholders, officers and
executives have sold several hundred thousand shares in the
company, according to the Washington Service, which tracks insider
trading.

SPOTLIGHT FINDS AN ALWAYS-MOVING CHOREOGRAPHER
</HEADLINE>
  
 (Attn.: Calif., N.Y.) (For release Sunday, Aug. 9.) 
 (jw) 
 By VALERIE GLADSTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Choreographer Donald McKayle can be as difficult to locate as he
is to classify. Instead of staying in one place, he shuttles
between New York and California. Rather than create dances for just
one medium, he regularly invents them for Broadway, television,
film and the concert stage. He loves choreographing but enjoys
teaching just as much. Moreover, these are not the only unusual
aspects of his life. When he started his modern dance company in
New York in 1951, Alvin Ailey, Arthur Mitchell, Lar Lubovitch and
Eliot Feld were among its first members.
</P>
<P>
   Although as a black choreographer and teacher, McKayle has
greatly inspired young blacks, both Ailey and Mitchell achieved
more recognition for their advancement of blacks in dance. And
Lubovitch and Feld have won more renown as choreographers. Why?
Most people in the dance world believe McKayle has not, until
recently, received due recognition because he has refused to
specialize in one medium or to be identified solely as an
African-American artist. But in making those choices he was only
being true to himself.
</P>
<P>
   Now, at 68, McKayle increasingly finds himself in the limelight.
``It's hard to keep up with all the awards and honors I receive,''
he said, sounding amused. ``Next, they'll try to bronze me.'' In
1995, he won a fellowship from the National Endowment for the Arts
to create a student dance company at the University of California
at Irvine, where he has been a professor of dance since 1989. The
next year, an award of $100,000 from the National Dance Residency
Program made it possible for him to serve as resident choreographer
of the Jose Limon Dance Company for two years. This support also
gave him time to write his autobiography, ``I Will Dance With
You,'' which Gordon and Breach Publishers will bring out next
summer.
</P>
<P>
   Now Lincoln Center Out of Doors is celebrating McKayle. On
Thursday and Friday and on Aug. 20 and 21, the Dayton Contemporary
Dance Company and the Limon Dance Company will honor him with
performances of his works. The programs feature ``Games'' and
``Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder,'' two modern-dance classics, and the
New York premiere of ``Heartbeats,'' commissioned by the Limon
company. ``He's a master and among the most humane people in
dance,'' says Jenneth Webster, the festival's producer.
</P>
<P>
   Although McKayle spends more time on the West Coast than on the
East, New York City holds warm memories for him. ``I first fell in
love with dance in the New York Public Library,'' he said. ``As a
boy, I went there to research my heritage and moved on to dance.''
Encouraged by his Jamaican parents, he continued his studies at the
Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture, where he found
photos and books on major artists of the past. ``It wasn't long
before I went to a performance,'' he said. ``That did it.
Immediately, I wanted to dance myself.'' In 1947, at the age of 17,
McKayle arrived at the midtown studios of the New Dance Group,
where he encountered some of the most innovative figures in modern
dance: Pearl Primus, Sophie Maslow, Jean Erdman, William Bales and
Hadassah were all teaching there. No one style prevailed at the New
Dance Group, so McKayle tried them all. Later he danced briefly
with the companies of Martha Graham, Anna Sokolow and Merce
Cunningham.
</P>
<P>
   These disparate experiences left an indelible impression on
McKayle. Although he often uses African-American traditions and
themes, to call him an African-American choreographer would be as
misleading as to label Balanchine a Russian one. He knows East
Indian and flamenco styles as well as he knows African, and he
incorporates all of them into his choreography. ``I've never
thought, `This is my culture, and that is your culture,' in
relation to anyone from anywhere,'' he said. ``How could I? I'm too
mixed. My middle name is Cohen, after my Jewish-English
grandfather.''
</P>
<P>
   McKayle's ``Games,'' his first major piece, set the tone for all
his works. Made for his company in 1951, it deals with children at
play in the city's streets. Calling upon his memories of the fears
that haunt urban children, he shows how danger threatens their fun.
``Long before child abuse became an everyday news story,'' said Joe
Nash, a dance historian, ``Donny made you feel its reality. He's a
master of theater.''
</P>
<P>
   His next important dance, ``Rainbow 'Round My Shoulder'' (1959),
depicts the suffering and hopes of a group of men on a chain gang.
As in many of his works, his powerful, rhythmic movements convey
the strong, archetypal emotions that drive human beings. ``These
became classics,'' said Judith Jamison, artistic director of the
Ailey company, ``because there's no dillydallying about the point.
They touch the heart.''
</P>
<P>
   McKayle didn't work in a variety of mediums simply for
self-fulfillment. As a husband and father of three children, he
felt obliged to look for economic stability outside of concert
dance, which barely sustains its members. Although his company
achieved success with works like ``Her Name Was Harriet'' (1952),
about Harriet Tubman and the Underground Railroad, and ``District
Storyville'' (1962), which chronicled the growth of jazz, he could
not support his family on its earnings. Consequently, in 1969, he
dissolved his troupe and went to California to choreograph for
several television series.
</P>
<P>
   Over the following decades McKayle also worked on films, among
them ``Bedknobs and Broomsticks'' (1971), with Angela Lansbury, and
``The Jazz Singer'' (1980), with Neil Diamond and Laurence Olivier.
At the same time, he managed to fit in Broadway, collecting Tony
nominations for ``Golden Boy'' (1964), starring Sammy Davis Jr.,
and ``Sophisticated Ladies'' (1981).
</P>
<P>
   ``First, I took on projects just for the money,'' he said. ``But
once I got involved, I discovered I liked working with actors and
singers. Every process feeds another. Frankly, being a purist would
have bored me. If I ever got fed up with people in one field, I
knew I could go someplace else.''
</P>
<P>
   His forays into television, film and theater did not cost him
his place in modern dance. He continued to choreograph for many
troupes, including the Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theater and
Lula Washington's Los Angeles Contemporary Dance Theater.
</P>
<P>
   At Lincoln Center Out of Doors, Tamica Washington, a principal
with the Washington company, will perform ``Los Angelitos Negroes''
from ``Songs of the Disinherited'' (1991). ``I love McKayle's way
of using bodies to make contours and shapes,'' she said. ``Movement
just flows from him. This piece especially affected me. It asks
artists, `Why don't you paint black angels?'''
</P>
<P>
   Although McKayle often deals with serious subjects, his works
never lack humor and romance. A passionate music lover, he came up
with a group of deeply emotional songs from many countries for
``Heartbeats.'' They convey everything from a young girl's musings
on love to the anguish of a wartime separation. ``Each song reveals
a particular way of connecting to life,'' McKayle said. ``I know so
many. I always wake with a song on my lips.''
</P>
<P>
   Fame may have arrived late for him, but apparently joie de vivre
did not.

ALLIED SIGNAL GOES AFTER AMP INC.

 By LAURA M. HOLSON and KENNETH N. GILPIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Allied Signal, a maker of aerospace and automotive products,
announced Tuesday that it was starting a $9.8 billion unsolicited
offer for AMP Inc., a 55 percent premium over Monday's closing
price.
</P>
<P>
   The offer, $44.50 a share in cash, will begin in five days if
management of AMP, a maker of electronics connectors, does not
agree to sit down and discuss a deal on friendly terms, said
Allied's chairman and chief executive, Larry Bossidy.
</P>
<P>
   Bossidy said he had made several attempts in the last week to
discuss a deal with AMP management, including two phone calls and a
letter. The move has been approved by Allied Signal's board.
</P>
<P>
   Shares in AMP rose $13.9375 after the 3:30 p.m. announcement to
close at $42.5625. Shares of Allied closed down $3.5625, to $40.
</P>
<P>
   AMP said that it was referring the offer to its board, but that
it was urging shareholders not to take any action until the board
reviewed its offer.
</P>
<P>
   AMP, based in Harrisburg, Pa., has been struggling lately,
making it an attractive target for Allied Signal, which is based in
Morris Township, N.J.
</P>
<P>
   In July, AMP said it was closing a Pennsylvania plant and would
cut 3,000 jobs in the next two years, a result of the weak economy
in Asia. That region accounted for 20 percent of AMP's 1997 sales.
The company has 48,300 workers in 53 companies, another attractive
element for Allied.
</P>
<P>
   For the most part, Wall Street analysts said a deal made sense,
assuming that Bossidy and his team from Allied Signal could change
the way AMP operates.
</P>
<P>
   ``From what we are beginning to learn about AMP, it is a nice,
undermanaged company,'' said Phua Young, an analyst with Lehman
Brothers. ``With a strong management team, a combination with
Allied Signal could lead to some nice synergies.''
</P>
<P>
   Allied Signal's offer, if accepted, would dilute Allied earnings
by 27 cents a share, said Bossidy. It would be financed by the sale
of $2 billion worth of Allied assets _ some analysts suggested in
the automotive business _ as well as a $1.5 billion equity
offering. That would offset the dilution, he said, and 1999
earnings of the combined companies would rise 13 to 17 percent. He
added that the combination would generate cash flow of $200 million
in 1999, $300 million in 2000 and an additional $100 million in
2001.
</P>
<P>
   Some analysts were skeptical of Bossidy's projections,
particularly because his management team had not inspected AMP's
books.
</P>
<P>
   Allied may also face difficulties with its hostile offer because
Pennsylvania has some of the toughest anti-takeover laws in the
country.
</P>
<P>
   As a defensive measure, Allied filed a suit in a U.S. District
Court in Pennsylvania in an attempt to insure that investors would
not be denied the opportunity to consider the offer.
</P>
<P>
   Still, analysts agreed that the rich offer would put pressure on
AMP's management to consider the bid carefully.
</P>
<P>
   ``Part of the reason the premium is as big as it is is to get
AMP shareholders in line,'' Young, the Lehman Brothers analyst,
said. ``If AMP management can't do as much as Allied Signal to get
the stock price up, they run the risk of getting sued'' by
shareholders.
</P>
<P>
   Eli Lustgarten, an analyst with Schroder &AMP; Co., said that Allied
was seeking out AMP as an addition to what he said was a growing
stable of high-growth and high-margin businesses. ``AMP is a
dominant company in a niche that has seen its market position and
profitability eroded fairly considerably,'' he said. ``But with a
little bit of management smarts you can hopefully reinvigorate the
company.''
</P>
<P>
   Lustgarten said that by going after AMP, Bossidy was seeking to
reinvigorate the company's growth early in the next century. ``With
aerospace likely to slow, you can begin to raise questions about
where they would turn for faster growth,'' he said. ``This is
pretty well thought out.''

GM WILL PARE AS MANY AS 1,000 WHITE-COLLAR JOBS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By MICHELLE KREBS   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   DETROIT _ General Motors Corp. announced a sweeping
reorganization of its internal distribution structure Tuesday that
is expected to save $200 million to $300 million a year and
eliminate as many as 1,000 white-collar jobs.
</P>
<P>
   The move follows a meeting Monday of GM's board, its first since
the auto maker settled a nearly eight-week strike by the United
Automobile Workers at two Flint, Mich., parts plants, which over
time virtually shut down North American assembly operations. The
strike, which cost the company about $3 billion in potential
profit, has increased pressure to cut expenses.
</P>
<P>
   The revamping of GM's wholesale operation is the second such
major move by company management this week. The first was GM's
announcement on Monday that it would spin off its huge parts
business, Delphi Automotive Systems.
</P>
<P>
   The changes, in the works for a year, create a single
organization, rather than one each for the Buick, Cadillac,
Chevrolet, Oldsmobile and Pontiac-GMC divisions. The new
organization closely resembles that of GM's Saturn Corporation, a
separate subsidiary established nearly a decade ago to find new
ways to build and sell cars; Saturn will remain outside the new
organization.
</P>
<P>
   Under the realignment, the United States will be divided
geographically among five market area teams, a concept used by
Saturn. The teams will be made up of sales, service, parts and
brand marketing people. They will call on GM dealers, regardless of
which brands they sell.
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, representatives from each division have
traditionally called on dealers with that franchise. The change is
intended to eliminate layers of bureaucracy and the number of
people visiting a dealer, since 65 percent of General Motors sales
are made by dealers who have more than one GM franchise.
</P>
<P>
   ``This work is all about getting faster, getting decisions and
information flow much closer to customers and dealers, and
leveraging GM's size and market power across the whole business,
instead of on a divisional basis,'' said Ronald Zarrella, vice
president in charge of GM's North American vehicle sales, service
and marketing group, at a news briefing Tuesday. Zarrella, the
company's strongest proponent of brand management, said the new
structure would also help GM better reach customer groups.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, GM will institute a pay-for-performance system, a
practice unheard of in the automotive business, to reward employees
for delivering cars and trucks to the customer through the dealer.
Details of the new compensation plan have yet to be worked out, but
as much as 25 percent of an employee's pay could be ``at risk,''
Zarrella said.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is the first significant departure from the Alfred P.
Sloan structure of GM that I can remember,'' said Frank Ursomarso,
president of Union Park Pontiac-GMC in Wilmington, Del., and the
National Automobile Dealers Association's GM representative, in a
phone interview. ``It's a step in a positive direction.''
</P>
<P>
   Ursomarso, like Zarrella, said the customer would not notice the
change, although closer information sharing without layers of
bureaucracy between the dealer and GM should result in the right
products being in the dealer's showroom.
</P>
<P>
   ``The chances of a customer finding the car or truck he or she
wants in a certain color and with certain equipment should
theoretically be here,'' Ursomarso said. And the dealer should have
the opportunity to increase business ``and penetrate market
share,'' he said, adding, ``I can't do that now with my GMC
franchise, for instance, because I can't get the right trucks here
because there's no system in place.''
</P>
<P>
   Two new positions were created Tuesday. Roy Roberts, a GM vice
president and previously general manager of the Pontiac-GMC
division, becomes general manager for field sales, service and
parts. John Middlebrook, also a vice president and formerly
Chevrolet general manager, was named general manager-vehicle brand
marketing.
</P>
<P>
   GM's other division general manager positions will be eliminated
by Jan. 1, 1999, when the revamping is completed. The general
managers, previously vice presidents of the corporation, will be
replaced with managers without vice president status, addressing
criticism that the company is top-heavy with executives.
</P>
<P>
   GM expects to realize savings by eliminating up to 20 percent of
the 5,000 jobs now in its distribution system, which will be done
through retirements and retirement incentives. In addition, the
company expects to save money by eliminating duplication and
adopting common processes and systems throughout GM, Zarrella said.

EDITORIAL: THE WAR INSIDE BILL CLINTON 
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editoril for Wednesday, August 5:
</P>
<P>
   Elected officials and their professional handlers are forever
condemning reporters and historians for focusing on politicians'
character and personality. But over time, the study of the shaping
influence of personal history has proved a reliable way to judge
fitness for office and make reasonable predictions about
performance under pressure.
</P>
<P>
   Thus the real suspense in Washington these days is not over
what, if any, indiscretions President Clinton might confess, but in
whether he can gather himself to meet his crisis.
</P>
<P>
   This mode of analysis will not appeal, of course, to those who
see Clinton as a victim. Our view is that history will depict him
as the architect of his situation in a way that illustrates how a
president's inner reality shapes his destiny.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, there is always a limit to what we can learn from
observing occupants of the Oval Office. But who can doubt that
there was something in Ronald Reagan's rootedness that let him
compensate for not being the brightest bulb in town? Similarly, it
was the dark ceremonies of Richard Nixon's psyche, not some
colossal international blunder, that destroyed a true
foreign-policy intellectual. Lyndon Johnson's idealized personality
was that of a social healer. But the part of his nature shaped by
the macho code of the frontier destroyed his legacy and millions of
lives.
</P>
<P>
   With Clinton, the drama seems of a less momentous order. But
that does not mean that the struggle within him now is not a
passionate one. Even his most dogged congressional defenders and
most loyal former aides are urging him to tell the truth, whatever
it is.
</P>
<P>
   Yet Clinton's entire public record _ on the draft, marijuana,
Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate, Monica Lewinsky _ is one of
avoiding full and factual disclosure even when that was the smart
play. This is, in sum, behavior crafted as much by the nexus of
inclination and experience as by advice of counsel.
</P>
<P>
   In its latest trash-the-critics operation, the White House has
said that the mere act of calling on the president to tell the
truth means that Clinton has been unfairly prejudged. It means
something quite different, of course. Commentators and millions of
skeptical citizens are basing their advice on six years of
observation and a longing for candor. This is a president who has
been delivered into crisis by the agency of his own evasions.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday he travels to the Capitol to meet with the House
Democrats who must defend him against any impeachment efforts. They
lack the numbers and, in some cases, the stomach for the task. They
will advise honesty in the interests of their party's fate,
Clinton's survival and repairing the presidency. Whether Clinton
agrees with that advice is a suspenseful question. Whether he could
ever act on it is an even deeper and more mysterious one.

   SAN FRANCISCO _ In a collaboration between two fierce computer
industry competitors, IBM and Sun Microsystems Inc. plan to begin
shipping the latest version of their jointly developed Java
operating system for networked computers.
</P>
<P>
   Originally posed as a fierce competitor to the Windows-based PC,
the Network Computer was conceived as a way to tap the power of the
World Wide Web to cut the cost of corporate computing. Such
computers run a Web browser and applications in the Java
programming language, which are downloaded from a central computer
each time they are used.
</P>
<P>
   In the last two years, the Network Computer movement has been
slowed as components like operating systems and low-cost hardware
have proved tardy. Now IBM and Sun appear to be broadening their
strategy.

<TEXT>
<P>
   TBILISI, Georgia _ No one here seems to know how Tbilisi's old
town avoided the devastation wreaked across the Soviet Union by
short-sighted planners who razed countless old neighborhoods to
make way for ugly concrete apartment complexes. But survive it did,
and today it is a delightful maze of cobbled streets, twisting
lanes, colorful wooden facades and marvelous architectural detail.
</P>
<P>
   Much of the old town was declared a historic district in 1975,
but although that decree has preserved much of its character,
little has been done to restore crumbling facades and interiors.
Now architectural historians are mapping the area house by house,
and hope to attract international help for a large-scale
preservation program.
</P>
<P>
   Buildings in the old town are in styles ranging from Russian and
French classical to Art Nouveau. Many could only be classified as
highly eclectic. Spiral staircases wind up along ivy-covered
facades to deep wooden balconies. Leafy parks, Persian archways,
delicate masonry patterns and courtyards shaded by spreading
mulberry trees contribute to the visitor's sense of having escaped
the modern world.
</P>
<P>
   The old town, which is spread over several hundred acres, is
home to thousands of families. Many are poor, but some are young
professionals who have begun fixing up old buildings and opening
restaurants, cafes, boutiques and art galleries. Reflecting
Georgia's history of religious tolerance, there is not only a
Georgian Orthodox cathedral but also a mosque, a synagogue, a
Russian Orthodox bell tower and an Armenian Gregorian church.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's so much history in this area, we can't let it fall
apart,'' a gallery owner said as she welcomed a group of
schoolchildren to a weekend art class. ``Unfortunately, some of the
people who have their eyes on this neighborhood just want to wreck
what makes it so interesting. We need to find a way to fix it up
without ruining it.''
</P>
<P>
   Tbilisi has been Georgia's capital since the year 458, and what
is now the old town is its traditional center. It has been
destroyed several times, most recently by Persian invaders in 1795.
Among the district's historical monuments is one commemorating the
sacrifice of the ``300 men of Aragvi,'' warriors who died while
rescuing Georgia's king during the 1795 battle.
</P>
<P>
   Georgia's location astride ancient trade routes has made it a
melting pot for Asian and European influences, and both are visible
in Tbilisi's old town.
</P>
<P>
   Many homes seem to have been built with an eye toward providing
open space on terraces or in gardens, a testament to the communal
nature of Georgian society. Georgians like to say that friends and
good company are among life's greatest pleasures, and believe that
living within one's own four walls is little more than a form of
imprisonment.
</P>
<P>
   Although street patterns in the old town are ancient, most of
its buildings date from the 19th and early 20th centuries. Some are
being defaced by tasteless renovation and poor materials, but the
greatest threat to the neighborhood is decay and neglect.
</P>
<P>
   In a 150-year-old caravansary, where Silk Road traders once
gathered, 22 families live in tiny rooms and share a single toilet.
City officials want to restore the building, perhaps turning it
into an elegant guest house. Residents say they will move only if
suitable housing can be found for them nearby. They have turned
down an offer of quarters in a Soviet-style apartment complex on
the edge of Tbilisi.
</P>
<P>
   Another caravansary nearby is so decayed that little more than a
brick shell remains. Garbage is piled in what was once the
basement.
</P>
<P>
   ``Too much shame, too much,'' lamented Maia Mania, one of the
architectural historians now plotting a strategy to rescue the old
town, as she passed by one morning. ``No words to explain.''
</P>
<P>
   Working with a grant from the World Bank, Ms. Mania and three
colleagues are trying to decide which buildings are best candidates
for careful restoration. Lack of money is her biggest challenge,
but hardly the only one. The old town is full of cracked facades,
flaking plaster, decomposing bricks and rotting beams.
</P>
<P>
   ``Tbilisi lacks a good system for controlling ground water,''
Ms. Mania said while examining the crumbling wall of a fading
caravansary now being used as a seminary. ``Dampness seeps up and
destroys more than the Soviets did.''
</P>
<P>
   While hoping for outside help, Ms. Mania and her colleagues are
drafting a plan to create ``urban islands'' of individual blocks or
buildings. ``This way we could concentrate our resources on places
that are especially beautiful or especially endangered or have
especially great potential,'' she said.
</P>
<P>
   ``Most people here understand that the old town is something
very precious. We have to go further, to show them that it is a
monument of worldwide importance and that with the right care it
could again be something truly glorious.''

JUDGE ORDERS BIDDING BE USED TO PICK LAWYERS IN BIG CLASS ACTION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By DIANA B. HENRIQUES   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   There were actions on two fronts on Tuesday in the battle
against the genteel back-scratching arrangements known as ``paying
to play,'' in which lawyers make campaign contributions to the
public officials who then hire lawyers for lucrative public work.
</P>
<P>
   In Newark, N.J., a federal judge decided to conduct a silent
auction to select the law firms that will represent several public
pension funds, including those overseen by New York state
Comptroller H. Carl McCall, in the huge shareholder lawsuit against
the Cendant Corp., whose shares plunged after accounting
irregularities were announced in April.
</P>
<P>
   The decision by Judge William Walls came after a lawyer
representing another plaintiff in the case argued that the law
firms the pension funds had selected should be disqualified because
of their substantial contributions to McCall's political campaign.
</P>
<P>
   And in Toronto, delegates of the American Bar Association voted
to instruct the association's ethics committee to prepare an ethics
rule, to be considered at next year's annual meeting, that would
prohibit lawyers from making political contributions ``for the
purpose of obtaining or being considered for a legal engagement.''
</P>
<P>
   The association also voted to urge all state and local bar
associations to ``unequivocally condemn'' any pay-to-play
arrangements and to insure that campaign contributions by lawyers
are fully disclosed. And they encouraged individual state bar
associations to take more restrictive action ``where local
circumstances warrant'' _ a clear victory for the efforts by
lawyers in New York state to enact some of the toughest pay-to-play
prohibitions in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is an enormous victory for the bar,'' said Michael
Cardozo, a partner at Proskauer Rose and former president of New
York City's bar association. The proposals under consideration in
New York would largely prevent lawyers from accepting work from
public officials to whom they have made campaign contributions.
</P>
<P>
   The Cendant case in Newark is considered by lawyers to be the
largest shareholder class-action lawsuit in history. Shareholders
lost an estimated $14 billion when Cendant's accounting problems
sent its shares plummeting 46 percent on April 16. The company has
undertaken an investigation that suggests that deliberate deception
was involved, making the shareholders' case even stronger. Legal
fees in the case are expected to be many millions of dollars.
</P>
<P>
   Federal securities laws give a leading role to shareholders who
have sustained the largest losses, which in this case would be New
York state's pension funds and two co-plaintiffs, the California
public employees retirement system, known as Calpers, and New York
City's pension funds. Those funds had hired Bernstein, Litowitz,
Berger &AMP; Grossman of New York and Barrack, Rodos &AMP; Bacine of
Philadelphia, both of which were substantial contributors to
McCall.
</P>
<P>
   That arrangement was attacked last month by Howard Sirota, a New
York lawyer seeking a spot on the legal team. Sirota argued that
the only way to eliminate the appearance of political influence
from the case was for the lawyers to be selected by competitive
bidding. Joining in his fight were two New Jersey firms.
</P>
<P>
   Walls did not specifically address the pay-to-play issues
Tuesday. But his competitive bidding process has made the issue
moot, Sirota said last night. ``It is now a level playing field. It
no longer matters who you know _ what matters now is what you know
and what you charge,'' he said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   There is a curious wrinkle to Walls' auction method: After he
has reviewed the sealed bids, which are due Sept. 17, he will give
Bernstein, Litowitz and Barrack, Rodos the opportunity to match the
low bid.
</P>
<P>
   In another unusual step, Walls also tapped the Connecticut state
pension funds, overseen by State Treasurer Paul Silvester, as one
of the lead plaintiffs for investors who purchased derivative
Cendant securities called Prides, marketed by Merrill Lynch &AMP; Co.
</P>
<P>
   According to A. Richard Ross of Carella Byrne, the judge
concluded that Calpers and its co-plaintiffs could not adequately
represent those investors because Calpers has a sizable investment
in Merrill Lynch stock.
</P>
<P>
   Here, too, Connecticut's choice of counsel will have to be the
lowest bidder to keep the legal assignment, explained Connecticut
Attorney General Richard Blumenthal.
</P>
<P>
   ``That will give the funds and the potential victims a much
bigger share of what we win,'' Blumenthal said.

BONNIE PRESSMAN OF BARNEYS IS MOVING TO LAUREN 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Bonnie Pressman, wife of Gene Pressman, whose
grandfather founded Barneys New York, said on Tuesday that she
would step down as the retailer's executive vice president and
director of women's fashion to become senior vice president and
women's fashion director at Polo Ralph Lauren Corp.
</P>
<P>
   The move is almost sure to shock many people in the fashion
industry with whom Ms. Pressman has maintained good will during the
retailer's bankruptcy proceedings, which began two years ago.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Pressman, who joined the company in 1983 as a former model
and retail novice, learned from her father-in-law, Fred Pressman,
and rose through the ranks of the business, mastering everything
from the art of buying shoes to promoting young, unheard-of
designers. Fred Pressman died in 1996.
</P>
<P>
   In Ms. Pressman's place at Barneys, Judy Collinson, the general
merchandise manager for the women's division, will take on
additional responsibilities.
</P>
<P>
   Although Gene Pressman was recently stripped of his title as
co-chief executive of the company as part of the company's attempt
to restructure and emerge from Chapter 11, Ms. Pressman said her
decision to join Lauren was based on the new job's requiring less
travel and allowing her more time with her two young children. ``I
decided I needed to be home more with them because they need more
of my support now that they are in school,'' she said.

MONMOUTH PARK BUCKS THE TREND WITH BIGGER PURSES AND BETTER
HORSES 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By JOSEPH DURSO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OCEANPORT, N.J. _ Like an oval gem lying in the dunes along the
ocean, Monmouth Park nestles on 600 acres within sight of the
Atlantic. In its 52nd year, it is aggressively trying to find and
cultivate people to replace the lost generation of horse racing
fans. And for the sixth straight year, it seems to be bucking the
national trend and succeeding.
</P>
<P>
   More to the point, Monmouth is pushing for new blood, new
pockets and new cash, and is willing to wait for them.
</P>
<P>
   ``The pitch,'' said Bob Kulina, the vice president and general
manager, ``isn't to the betting public. My hope is to walk people
through. We lost a generation of people because we didn't cater to
them. Someday, when these people have some money, they'll come
back.''
</P>
<P>
   Six years ago, Kulina and his predecessor, Hal Handel, embarked
on a plan to make Monmouth Park a playland for the family, trusting
that today's picnicking public will become tomorrow's betting
public.
</P>
<P>
   Among the additions the track has made to create that atmosphere
are picnic areas, musical entertainment, children's activities and
special events such as a classic car show. The changes have paid
off, with average attendance rising each of the past five years.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to have something to sell,'' Kulina said. ``We
realized we had to create events, and events don't happen
immediately. We started to change when we started rock music. We
weren't getting anybody young. If we get people inside, we'll
succeed. Basically, we need to educate people.''
</P>
<P>
   Monmouth makes the most of climate, summertime travel and the
Atlantic Ocean. Like Saratoga in upstate New York and Del Mar in
Southern California, it is a resort track, with picture-postcard
beauty and a neat colonial look. It can house 1,600 horses in 38
barns. And, operating from Memorial Day through Labor Day, it
thrives. Attendance runs between 10,000 and 12,000 a day; handle,
just under $2 million.
</P>
<P>
   The numbers are lagging a bit at this summer's 77-day meet,
which ends Sept. 7, but Monmouth has arranged a few short-term
solutions to keep business perking while its long-range strategy
takes hold. It is staging blockbuster events that put its basic
commodity onto the marquee: star horses.
</P>
<P>
   On July 20, it brought in Favorite Trick, the 1997 juvenile
champion and Horse of the Year, to run in the Long Branch Stakes.
An injury to the Kentucky Derby and Preakness winner, Real Quiet,
prevented a rematch of 3-year-old stars in the $1 million Haskell
Invitational on Sunday, but that race will still feature Victory
Gallop, winner of the Belmont Stakes, and Coronado's Quest, the
reformed rogue who won the Wood, the Riva Ridge and the Dwyer. And
for the Iselin Handicap on Aug. 30, Monmouth raised both the purse
and the distance to satisfy the No. 1 horse in the country, Skip
Away.
</P>
<P>
   ``You do what you have to do,'' Kulina said. ``People want to
see champions, and we're going to have a champion here again. For
so many years, we were just opening the doors. Now, we're trying to
create the marquee event. I just wish we'd been doing it for the
last 20 years.''
</P>
<P>
   But 20 years ago, or even 40, it might have been more difficult
to sell drastic changes to the founding fathers of Monmouth. But
Kulina, who is 48 years old and the son of a well-known trainer,
Joe Kulina, said they were eager to spend money to import stars
even in those days.
</P>
<P>
   ``You used to have Jimmy Jones walking the grounds when he was
an official here,'' he said, ``and the track was being run by Sonny
Werblin, Phil Iselin and Leon Hess, the men who created the New
York Jets and changed the face of pro football. They wanted things
at the track to be run perfectly. You do it right, even if you have
to spend money. Mr. Hess told us to go out and get Spectacular Bid.
We adjusted the purse and got him.
</P>
<P>
   ``This year, I thought long and hard about Skip Away.''
</P>
<P>
   He finally decided to raise the purse of the Iselin from
$250,000 to $500,000. And, more to Skip Away's liking, he
lengthened the distance from a mile and one-sixteenth to a mile and
one-eighth.
</P>
<P>
   But Kulina has drawn doubts from racing people who question the
validity of changing the distance of a race to suit one horse,
especially a champion. One person not entirely satisfied is one of
Monmouth's longtime heroes, Jimmy Croll, a trainer with
headquarters at the track for 38 years and the owner and trainer of
the retired champion Holy Bull.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a nice track,'' Croll said the other day. ``But it
bothers me that they don't have better racing. They need more
horses and better horses. I think they're seeing the light and
raising purses. But a couple of big races don't make a season.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Sonny Hine, who trains Skip Away, said he did not conspire to
get his horse a tailored distance and more money. ``There are
people under the impression that I made Monmouth do this, and
that's not true. They asked me what they could do to get Skip Away
to run, and I said, `Change the distance.' They did it, and since I
promised those people I would run my horse there if they did,
that's what I'm doing.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, Kulina ignores the controversy and presses on with his
plans.
</P>
<P>
   ``Racing is still cheaper than a Broadway show, and that's what
we're trying to sell,'' he said. ``We're trying to give people the
environment where they can bring their kids and enjoy a family
experience.''

   DOW JONES AVERAGE PLUNGES BY 300 POINTS, OR 3.41 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Investors stampeded out of stocks, and the Dow Jones industrial
average plunged nearly 300 points, or 3.41 percent. The tumble,
paced by financial and technology stocks, came after months in
which traders shrugged off bad economic news from Asia and a
slowdown in corporate profits at home.
</P>
<P>
   Still, while the Dow's point drop was the third largest in
history, in percentage terms it did not even make the top 20. And
because of the forceful bull move in stocks this year, many
investors still have considerable profits year-to-date. The Dow has
climbed 7.32 percent since January.
</P>
<P>
   The market's losses left major indexes nearly 10 percent off
their peaks, which typically signals a correction. Economists were
divided as to whether rougher times lie ahead.
</P>
<P>
   Prices of 30-year Treasury bonds increased, driving yields to
the lowest level in more than three weeks. The yield fell to 5.63
percent from 5.65 percent on Monday.

   BATTLING OVER `PAYING TO PLAY'
</P>
<P>
   There were two actions in the battle against the arrangements
known as ``paying-to-play,'' in which lawyers make campaign
contributions to the public officials who hire them for lucrative
public work. One called for an auction to select the law firms that
will represent several public pension funds in a lawsuit against
Cendant. The other was lawyers preparing an ethics rule on the
issue that will be considered next year.

   AMAZON.COM MAKES 2 ACQUISITIONS
</P>
<P>
   Amazon.com, signaling that its wants to sell far more than books
over the Internet, announced two acquisitions. Amazon.com will
exchange stock worth $187 million _ at Monday's closing price _ for
Junglee, which operates an Internet shopping service, and stock
worth $93 million for Planet All, which operates a vast Internet
address service.
</P>
<P>
   AMERICA ONLINE EARNINGS SURGE
</P>
<P>
   America Online reported a tenfold increase in operating earnings
for the second quarter, to $57.3 million, despite a 10 percent
price increase for its service. That represented operating income
of 23 cents a share, exceeding the 19 cents that analysts
estimated. The stock, which had fallen $5.0625, to $110.9375, on
the New York Stock Exchange, gained $7.8125 in after-hours trading
when the earnings were announced.
</P>
<P>
   FORD'S VEHICLE SALES FALL 4.3 PERCENT
</P>
<P>
   Ford's domestic car and truck sales fell an unexpected 4.3
percent in July. A 16.8 percent drop in car sales and fewer price
discounts offset a 5.2 percent gain in truck sales.
</P>
<P>
   LEADING INDICATORS SLIP 0.2 PERCENT

<P>
   General Motors announced a sweeping reorganization of its
internal distribution structure that is expected to save $200

   BIG TAX CUTS PROPOSED IN JAPAN

   IN FASHION ADS, '50s NOSTALGIA
</P>
<P>
   Some fashions from the 1950s are back _ at least in the cheerful
ads that have replaced the gloominess of yesteryear. Campaigns are
using images borrowed from television shows and retail catalogs
from that decade. For example, Barneys New York, the chic retailer,
which rarely finds itself behind a trend, had modeled its fall
direct marketing campaign on vintage Sears, Roebuck &AMP; Co. and
Montgomery Ward catalogs. Clothes like camel hair coats and pleated
skirts are back.

<P>
   WASHINGTON _ U.S. Chief Justice William Rehnquist rejected a
White House request Tuesday that he shield its lawyers from
testifying, permitting prosecutors investigating President
Clinton's relationship with Monica Lewinsky to question a member of
his inner circle of advisers.
</P>
<P>
   With the many threads of Starr's six-month-old investigation
abruptly intertwining, it was also disclosed Tuesday that Ms.
Lewinsky has turned over new physical evidence to prosecutors. She
has provided them with a photograph of Clinton that he had
inscribed to her, according to a lawyer knowledgeable about the
inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   She submitted the photograph last week along with a navy blue
dress and tape-recorded phone messages that she said were left by
the president.
</P>
<P>
   Lewinsky, who met again Tuesday for several hours with
prosecutors to discuss her prospective testimony, may appear before
the grand jury as soon as Thursday. Her testimony is not likely to
take more than a day or two, according to the lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   In exchange for her testimony, Ms. Lewinsky has received
immunity from prosecution for any wrongdoing she testifies about,
provided she does not commit perjury.
</P>
<P>
   Special White House counsel Lanny Breuer spent the day before
the grand jury. After his testimony late Tuesday afternoon, lawyers
from the White House and Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr's office
met for more than an hour with the presiding judge, Norma Holloway
Johnson. Invoking attorney-client privilege, White House lawyers
have repeatedly argued that Starr cannot ask about certain
conversations they have had with the president.
</P>
<P>
   The U.S. Court of Appeals in Washington ruled last week that
attorney-client privilege could not prevent a government lawyer
from testifying in a criminal investigation. But the White House
said Tuesday that it still intended to appeal that ruling to the
Supreme Court.
</P>
<P>
   Breuer has been at the center of President Clinton's
damage-control operation, processing subpoenas, gathering documents
and contacting witnesses during Starr's six-month-old
investigation. He had no comment Tuesday beyond declaring ``I'm
honored'' when asked his reaction to the hubbub surrounding his
appearance.
</P>
<P>
   The president, who met at the White House on Tuesday with his
private lawyers, is planning to testify August 17 via
closed-circuit television. He has no plans to address the public
about his testimony or his relationship with Ms. Lewinsky before
then, aides said Tuesday, but he may do so afterwards. ``It's not
on the drawing board,'' one Clinton adviser said.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Starr used a separate grand jury Tuesday to continue taking
testimony from Secret Service officers. Just three weeks ago,
Rehnquist rejected an urgent White House appeal that he block
testimony by the Secret Service. Tuesday, he did not publicly
explain his decision, issued at about 9 a.m., to permit Breuer's
testimony to go forward. The White House had wanted him to block
testimony by Breuer and other lawyers until the full Supreme Court
considered its appeal.
</P>
<P>
   For the White House, it was one more judicial setback in its
effort to establish presidential prerogatives and deflect Starr's
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   The fight over attorney-client privilege arose from prosecutors'
efforts to compel complete testimony from deputy White House
counsel Bruce Lindsey, the president's closest aide. Lindsey balked
at answering certain questions, invoking the privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Lindsey, who had back surgery last week, is still resting and
unable to testify, White House officials said. They said they
anticipate that Starr will seek to question other members of the
White House counsel's office.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, White House advisers continued to question reporters
about what they had learned about forensic tests on the navy blue
dress that Ms. Lewinsky turned over to prosecutors. Scientists at
the FBI crime laboratory have performed tests to determine whether
a stain on the dress was caused by semen, but the results are being
held under tight security. Starr is trying to learn whether the
dress was stained in a sexual encounter with Clinton.
</P>
<P>
   The president testified in the Paula Corbin Jones sexual
misconduct suit that he did not have a sexual relationship with Ms.
Lewinsky. He has also denied trying to cover up such a
relationship, another accusation that Starr is investigating.
</P>
<P>
   The White House continued to receive reassuring news Tuesday on
public opinion of the investigation. After the extraordinary
developments recently _ including Ms. Lewinsky's deal with
prosecutors and Clinton's decision to testify _ only 29 percent of
Americans surveyed late last week and into the weekend said that
they were following news of the investigation ``very closely.'' The
result was statistically indistinguishable from responses to the
same question in June and April.
</P>
<P>
   ``The reaction is no reaction,'' said Andrew Kohut, the director
of the Pew Research Center for the People and The Press, which
conducted the survey. ``It's incredible to me.''
</P>
<P>
   Sixty percent of those surveyed said that they would be
satisfied to end the matter if Clinton were to acknowledge an
affair with Ms. Lewinsky and say he lied about it to protect his
family. The poll of 1,189 adults had a margin of error of plus or
minus 3.5 percentage points.
</P>
<P>
   White House aides said that Clinton has no plan and no reason to
back away from his denials.
</P>
<P>
   Clinton has been solicitous in recent days of his support within
the Democratic Party. Monday, he attacked congressional Republicans
over their budget proposal, and Tuesday he met at the White House
with about a dozen Hispanic lawmakers. Tuesday night, he was the
star attraction at $300,000 fund-raiser to benefit Rep. Maxine
Waters, D-Calif.
</P>
<P>
   Wednesday, Clinton is scheduled to travel to Capitol Hill to sit
down with the House Democratic caucus. The White House
characterized the visit as a routine meeting to discuss the party's
agenda for the remainder of the congressional session. But some
Democrats may choose to bring up the Lewinsky investigation.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't know what they will bring up with him,'' said Barry
Toiv, a White House spokesman. ``I mean, presumably, they'll have
some give-and-take and that will be up to them.''

<P>
   NEW YORK _ It's not just that Pastrami King, a classic kosher
delicatessen that served as a Queens political clubhouse and
courthouse maven hangout for 37 years, has shuttered its doors. The
problem is that it's moving to Manhattan.
</P>
<P>
   ``I hope that Queens won't think of us as traitors, and I hope
our loyal customers will follow us to Manhattan,'' said Gary
Zinger, 33, the restaurant's manager, who spoke Tuesday as workers
carted out tables and chairs.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrami King, a landmark on the three-block strip of Queens
Boulevard that is the borough's center of power, closed Monday. It
will move from its longtime home in Kew Gardens to the Upper East
Side.
</P>
<P>
   Zinger said he was relocating because business at the 100-seat
restaurant had suffered after Family and Civil Courts moved to
Jamaica from the courthouse across the street several months ago.
</P>
<P>
   ``We felt the loss the day after the move,'' he said, estimating
that 2,000 people visited the courts daily, ``and our business was
off 35 to 40 percent.''
</P>
<P>
   Given its ``Rumpole of the Bailey'' ambiance, ``Meet you at the
Pastrami King'' was for decades the pre-lunch byword for lawyers
and politicians. Mayor Rudolph Giuliani thought enough of the
restaurant to make it more than just a routine corned-beef sandwich
stop during his 1997 re-election campaign: Pastrami King catered
his second inaugural party at the Queens Museum.
</P>
<P>
   In the 1980s, the delicatessen gained a certain notoriety as a
meet-and-greet spot for the friends and colleagues of Borough
President Donald Manes, who committed suicide in 1986 amid mounting
evidence that he had headed bribery and kickback schemes at the
Parking Violations Bureau.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess they think their business prospects are better in
Manhattan,'' said Claire Shulman, Manes' successor, who chose to be
magnanimous about the defection of Pastrami King to the archenemy
borough. ``We wish them well.'' Other politicians found the closing
a mixed blessing. ``I am saddened by the end of an era,'' said
Richard Brown, the Queens district attorney, who was partial to the
Pastrami King's brisket sandwich and recently underwent
quadruple-bypass surgery. ``But my cardiologist is thrilled.''
</P>
<P>
   These days, ``there is not a corned-beef sandwich to be found in
my district,'' lamented City Councilman John Sabini, who represents
parts of Jackson Heights, Elmhurst, Rego Park, Woodside and Corona.
``Now I can count on one hand the number of Jewish delis in the
county.''
</P>
<P>
   Pastrami King will move to 1269 Lexington Ave. between 85th and
86th Streets, and call its Manhattan incarnation the Pastrami Queen
in honor of Joy Harrison, Zinger's mother-in-law, who took over the
business four years ago. She remodeled the dim, disheveled deli,
installing black mosaic tiles and creating a chrome-and-silver
Queens Art Deco look.
</P>
<P>
   After the courts relocated, ``it wasn't the lawyers and judges
that we lost, but the people that would come to the court every day
that were our main business,'' said Ms. Harrison, 52.
</P>
<P>
   Pastrami King was famous for its rich, garlicky pastrami, made
according to a Romanian recipe. Critics praised its cedary
smokiness, which came from soaking and curing the meat over
smoldering wood for 10 to 16 days.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was a wonderful institution, like a beacon of eating on
Queens Boulevard,'' said Ed Levine, author of ``New York Eats,'' a
restaurant Baedeker. ``When their pastrami was good, it was as good
or better than any pastrami in the city, and therefore the
country.'' But Levine judged that the quality had deteriorated by
1997, when he left Pastrami King out of his sequel, ``New York Eats
More.''
</P>
<P>
   Many customers are in mourning. ``We are going crazy looking for
another place to go,'' said Aida Berke, a retired Port Authority
manager who reserved the private room at Pastrami King with as many
as 15 friends and family members ``every Friday night for close to
30 years.''
</P>
<P>
   ``The pastrami was superb,'' she said. ``There was nothing like
it.''
</P>
<P>
   She added: ``I guess we might go to Manhattan to visit them on
occasion. But it couldn't possibly be the same.''
</P>
<P>
   A Manhattan competitor seemed underwhelmed by the move. ``The
more delis here, the merrier,'' said Jeffrey Goldstein, manager of
the Carnegie Delicatessen, which has occupied its spot on Seventh
Avenue near 55th for more than 60 years. ``Being on the
opposite end of town from us, we really don't see them as
competition.''
</P>
<P>
   The borough of immigrants' champions say Queens will not suffer
irreparably from Pastrami King's flight, given all the ethnic
restaurants sprouting up. ``I still think Queens has the best and
most diverse food selection in the city,'' Sabini said. ``And I
challenge anyone who disputes that to an all-day eating fest at a
Brazilian barbecue place in Corona.''

ACCUSATIONS DRIVE TURBODYNE'S VALUATION DOWN $171.2 MILLION
</HEADLINE>

 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   Los Angeles -- Business hasn't run smoothly for Randy Cressall
in the weeks since state regulators announced they wanted to shut
down nearly two dozen Econo Lube N' Tune shops under suspicion of
fraudulent business practices.
</P>
<P>
   Cressall, a longtime owner of an Econo Lube franchise in
suburban Chatsworth, has seen the flow of customers nearly cut in
half in the weeks since the Bureau of Automotive Repair, part of
the Department of Consumer Affairs, announced it was taking action
against 18 corporate-owned shops for pressuring customers into
buying unnecessary parts and services.
</P>
<P>
   The problem is, the allegations don't apply to the 110
independently owned franchises in the state, which include
Cressall's shop. In fact, none of the shops named by the state are
in the San Fernando Valley or surrounding communities. The closest
is some 30 miles away, in Lawndale.
</P>
<P>
   ``Whatever they've heard about the other guys does not apply
directly to us _ directly or indirectly,'' said Cressall.
</P>
<P>
   Cressall said Econo Lube's corporate officials in Newport Beach
have been unhelpful since the bureau's announcement. Except for a
short note he received about a week ago acknowledging receipt of
his correspondence, Cressall has heard nothing from the office.
</P>
<P>
   ``I want to be a good franchisee for Econo Lube N' Tune,'' he
said. ``However, in this instance, I feel we need some more support
from the company.''
</P>
<P>
   Econo Lube officials did not return two telephone calls from the
Daily News on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   According to a Consumer Affairs announcement in mid-July, the 18
shops are accused of ``fraud, making false and misleading
statements and pressuring customers to purchase unnecessary parts
and service.''
</P>
<P>
   Albert Khalafyan, who also owns an Econo Lube in the San
Fernando Valley, blames media coverage of the investigation for the
shortfall.
</P>
<P>
   ``Regular customers ... they know me and they trust me and
that's it,'' he said. ``But new customers ... they see the wrong
information on TV. TV always exaggerates everything. They don't
talk about the honest people.''
</P>
<P>
   Cressall said his shop is down to about 175 customers a week,
down substantially from the normal 250 to 300 automobiles. Cressall
said that's forced him to trim his staff from 10 full-time and two
part-time workers to just seven full-timers. ``And we may end up
having to cut some of their hours,'' said Cressall, who conceded
he's struggling to bring his customers back.
</P>
<P>
   ``We're hoping we can redeem the great business we've had for 18
years.'' &UR; ! &LR;  &QL;

FRESHMEN QBS TO GET LONG LOOKS
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
<P>
   Carson Palmer or Jason Thomas at quarterback for USC?
</P>
<P>
   It's a tantalizing prospect, and it didn't lose any momentum
Tuesday, when USC football coach Paul Hackett said he intends to
use training camp to give his highly touted freshmen quarterbacks a
chance to bid for playing time or perhaps even win the starting
position.
</P>
<P>
   Although sophomore Mike Van Raaphorst was named the starting
quarterback during spring practice, Hackett said Palmer and Thomas
-- both prep All-Americans -- would be given every opportunity this
month to showcase their talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young guys have to get a shot,'' Hackett said. ``Whether
or not they will play immediately, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments are interesting, because juniors John Fox and
Quincy Woods were considered the second and third-string
quarterbacks. Fox started nine games last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had their opportunity in the spring,'' Hackett said. ``At
least heading into camp, it's for the young guys to show what they
can do. The quarterback position is a very interesting problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett did not rule out that Fox and Woods would see action
this season, but he has already promised Palmer and Thomas they
would at least be given a chance before the season.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback battle will be one of the highlights of training
camp, as the Trojans prepare for their Aug. 30 opener against
Purdue at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all sorta becoming more tense now because we are
getting closer,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett acknowledged for the first time publically Tuesday that
wide receiver R. Jay Soward has been suspended from the
season-opener against Purdue, which was originally reported in
April by the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Soward had to drop a class in the spring that he was in danger
of failing, and also was not regularly attending classes.
</P>
<P>
   However, Soward rebounded with a strong academic performance in
the summer and has also supposedly undergone an attitude change
under the strict regimen instituted by Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``His response to his suspension was sensational,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no chance Soward will be reinstated for the Purdue
game, though, Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to make it clear that I mean what I say,'' Hackett
said. ``It's only one game because of how sensational he
responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Already without Soward, USC will also be without wide receiver
Windrell Hayes, unless Hayes can plea bargain three felony counts
for writing bad checks down to a single misdemeanor charge in the
near future.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, who is not in camp, has turned down one offer by the Lodi
district attorney to reduce the charges, because he would be liable
for $15,000 in damages.
</P>
<P>
   According to sources, Hayes is trying to reduce the damages to
under $10,000. He would probably have to obtain a loan to pay off
the damages.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he believed Hayes might be able to reach an
agreement with the district attorney in the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: USC has added Chad Pierson, a 6-foot-2, 220-pound
fullback from Oxnard High School. Pierson was recruited by many
Pac-10 schools last year, but only recently passed his Scholastic
Assessment Test. He will be on scholarship. ... USC's freshmen
report today, but no workouts are planned until Thursday, and those
are expected to be light in nature. The rest of the team reports
Saturday.

PLAYERS DENY LINK TO MCIVER INJURY
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By CLARENCE E. HILL JR. c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Two Dallas Cowboys players have denied
being involved with the dormitory incident that left offensive
guard Everett McIver with a deep cut on his neck.
</P>
<P>
   WFAA/Channel 8 reported Monday night that linebacker Dexter
Coakley and defensive end Kavika Pittman also were in the
Midwestern State dorm room last Wednesday when McIver was injured.
The Cowboys, who have said they don't know when McIver will return
to the team, have declined to identify the players involved and
have instructed their players not to talk about it.
</P>
<P>
   A frustrated Coakley and Pittman both made long-distance calls
to their agents seeking help in clearing their names.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's going to be over,'' Coakley said. ``I want my name out of
it.''
</P>
<P>
   Coakley's agent, Pat Dye Jr., said: ``Dexter is upset that he
was linked to the incident and is adamant that he was no way
involved.''
</P>
<P>
   Pittman's agent, Brad Blank, said his client left a message on
his answering machine, and Blank described Pittman as ``infuriated
over the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   ``\RKavika\s called me this morning,'' Blank said. ``He said he
had nothing to do with it and wanted to know why he was linked to
it when he wasn't even there.''
</P>
<P>
   No report has been filed with the police at Midwestern State
University. Midwestern State president Lewis Rodriguez said the
campus police will not investigate the incident.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our position is that unless we get a complaint, the matter is
closed,'' Rodriguez said. ``So far we haven't received a complaint.
We are not investigating anything.''
</P>
<P>
   According to a source, the incident involved Cowboys receiver
Michael Irvin, and the wound was inflicted by scissors. Irvin
declined to comment.
</P>
<P>
   Ron Goethals, Dallas County's adult probation director, said
Tuesday that Irvin's four years' probation, received after pleading
no contest in July 1996 to felony cocaine possession, could be
revoked if a new criminal offense is shown.
</P>
<P>
   At the sentencing, state District Judge Manny Alvarez gave Irvin
a stern warning about getting in trouble during the probation,
saying he could sentence Irvin to the full range of punishment for
the crime: two to 20 years in prison.
</P>
<P>
   Under the deferred adjudication agreement, if Irvin serves his
sentence to Alvarez's satisfaction, the Dallas County district
attorney's office will drop the charges, and Irvin's record will
show no conviction.
</P>
<P>
   ``For all practical purposes, charges would have to be filed,''
Goethals said. ``Although there have been cases where some sort of
witness came forward without charges being filed.''
</P>
<P>
   There also is a lesser burden of proof for probation revocation
than in proving guilt or innocence in a criminal case, Goethals
said.
</P>
<P>
   ``The burden of proof is really only 51 percent,'' he said.
``Basically, it's somebody who comes forward and makes a
complaint.''
</P>
<P>
   Alvarez would make the final determination on whether probation
would be revoked, Goethals said.
</P>
<P>
   The injury forced McIver to miss Friday's preseason opener with
Seattle at Texas Stadium, and he did not return with the team to
training camp in Wichita Falls.
</P>
<P>
   McIver was given time off to be with his family. The Cowboys
originally thought he would rejoin the team Wednesday.
</P>
<P>
   Cowboys owner Jerry Jones, who has been in contact with McIver,
is unsure when McIver will return. As a result, his status for
Thursday's scrimmage with the Raiders in El Paso and for Saturday's
preseason game against the Raiders is unclear.
</P>
<P>
   ``He'll come back when he's physically able to play,'' Jones
said. ``We have no time frame.''
</P>
<P>
   Neither Jones nor Gailey said that McIver's absence from
practice and the possibility of him missing two preseason games is
a major setback. McIver, a five-year veteran, was signed to a
five-year, $9.5 million contract in the off-season to replace Larry
Allen at guard.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's not great (he's absent),'' Cowboys coach Chan Gailey
said, ``but we'll be able to make it up when we get him back.''

CLIPPERS CONSIDER RAMBIS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients)

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ The Clippers continue to move at their unique pace
in their search for a new coach, but Lakers assistant Kurt Rambis
has emerged as a front-runner to succeed Bill Fitch.
</P>
<P>
   Although former Seattle coach George Karl has been frequently
mentioned as a candidate, he has decided to pursue television
opportunities and is no longer a candidate. According to sources,
Karl's representatives spoke to Clippers executives, but those
talks never became serious.
</P>
<P>
   Another potential candidate is Phoenix Suns assistant Scott
Skiles, a former NBA player. Skiles' agent, Keith Glass, said
``there's been interest expressed by the Clippers,'' but there has
been no formal contact between Skiles and the club.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think he would have interest in the job,'' Glass said.
</P>
<P>
   Skiles, viewed as a rising star in the NBA coaching ranks, was
also briefly mentioned for the Bulls job. Another logical choice
might be Indiana assistant Rick Carlisle, a former Clippers
assistant. Carlisle withdrew from consideration in Chicago but
might like a less stressful environment in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Former San Antonio Spurs coach Bob Hill has also spoken with
team executives twice, but the Clippers' interest appears minimal.
Hill has received an endorsement from Shaquille O'Neal, for what
it's worth.
</P>
<P>
   ``He knows the game,'' O'Neal said from New York. ``He can
relate to today's players.''
</P>
<P>
   Hill remains a long shot.
</P>
<P>
   All of which leaves Rambis, the former Lakers forward and
current assistant coach, who would like to eventually become a head
coach.
</P>
<P>
   He's a popular local figure and could probably lure free agents
with his laid-back personality.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm highly interested in the possibility of coaching the
Clippers,'' Rambis said. ``But as of today, nothing's going on.''
</P>
<P>
   The main reason could be the lockout. ``Why pay somebody when
you don't have to?'' said a former NBA coach.
</P>
<P>
   The Clippers don't really need to hire a coach until the lockout
is resolved, and an end to the labor dispute does not appear
imminent.
</P>
<P>
   The only decision the organization has made since the June 24
draft was to not renew the contract of radio play-by-play announcer
Rory Markas.
</P>
<P>
   One thing appears clear: The boasts one club executive made
following the season that the team would be able to hire a big-name
coach and would pay more than ever before appear to be dubious
promises.
</P>
<P>
   Karl is out of the picture and former Bulls coach Phil Jackson
is not interested.
</P>
<P>
   That likely means an NBA assistant (Rambis, Skiles, Carlisle) or
perhaps a retread (Hill).

ERNEST DICKERMAN, 87, FOUGHT TO PRESERVE WILDERNESS AREAS  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By HOLCOMB B. NOBLE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   Ernest M. Dickerman, who was known by the Sierra Club as ``the
granddad of the Eastern wilderness'' for his efforts to persuade
people to defend their forests and wilderness from the power saws
and bulldozers of loggers, developers, road builders and other
commercial interests, committed suicide late on Friday or early
Saturday at his cabin in the mountains of Buffalo Gap, Va. He was
87.
</P>
<P>
   He was found under a cherry tree behind his cabin, having shot
himself, the sheriff's office reported. In a note to his family,
Dickerman said he took his own life as he had long planned to do
after the infirmities of age left him unable to ``master my own
fate in the wilds of this wild country.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerman was a well-known lobbyist for the Wilderness Society,
president of the Smoky Mountains Hiking Club and a leader of
campaigns that led to the designation of protected wildlife status
for more than 100 million acres in the United States, beginning in
1964. For several decades, he was in the forefront of efforts to
hold down development in the national parks, forests and designated
wild lands. Among his accomplishments was halting proposed oil
drilling that he said threatened the scenic highlands of Laurel
Park in the George Washington National Forest in Virginia.
</P>
<P>
   Brock Evans, former vice president for national issues of the
Audubon Society, said: ``The only way the environmental movement
ever gets anything accomplished is through endless pressure,
endlessly applied. And that was Ernie Dickerman _ always writing
letters or making calls.''
</P>
<P>
   Dickerman, by all accounts, was a tireless hiker who was said to
have had a compass in his head. He never used trails or trail maps,
often carried the backpacks of less hardy companions and plunged
onward through the wild and up the sides of mountains to what he
regarded as a greater glory. On one of his climbs to the summit of
Mount LeConte in the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in
Tennessee and North Carolina, he said: ``This is what I was looking
for on this planet,'' and instead of planting a flag he did a
handstand at the top.
</P>
<P>
   Ernest Miller Dickerman was born on Dec. 22, 1910, in Chicago.
His father, Judson C. Dickerman, was a civil engineer with the
Federal Power Commission, in Washington, D.C. His mother died when
he was 5, and he and his brother, Charles, were taken care of at
home by their sister, Virginia, who was 11, and were then sent to
boarding schools. Dickerman graduated from Gettysburg Academy in
Gettysburg, Pa., and then from Oberlin College in 1931.
</P>
<P>
   He loved the outdoors from an early age and went to work for the
Tennessee Valley Authority in Knoxville in 1933, a job in which he
hiked or biked or canoed around the poor villages of Tennessee,
telling people what it was going to be like for them when they got
electricity and trying to figure out where to put the power lines.
He left after four years and went to work in a button factory in
Knoxville.
</P>
<P>
   Soon thereafter, he joined the Smoky Mountains Hiking Club,
which was formed to help preserve the natural woodlands and
successfully pushed for three national parks, the Smokies, the
Shenandoah Valley in Virginia and Mammoth Cave in Kentucky. He
monitored the government's management and development of the
Smokies, fighting several battles on those issues with the National
Park Service.
</P>
<P>
   ``Fortunately the service decided that there would be no
commercial development, but it was unfortunate that the Civilian
Conservation Corps was allowed to put in a dozen camps,'' Dickerman
said. ``The CCC was one of the best things any government ever did
anywhere but they overdid it in the Smokies. They built endless
numbers of fire roads up every big hollow, and too damn many
automobile camps, and 650 miles of park trails. Guys like me
considered them another form of devastation.''
</P>
<P>
   After the outbreak of World War II, he served in England and
France with an Army chemical warfare unit. After the war, he found
that, ``where the Forest Service had been adding wild lands to its
system, lands were now being removed.''
</P>
<P>
   ``World War II technology made rough-terrain vehicles a
reality,'' he continued, ``and wilderness areas once thought
inaccessible could now be logged at a profit.''
</P>
<P>
   A crisis arose in the mid-1950s for Dickerman and other
conservationists when the Federal Bureau of Reclamation announced a
plan to build a dam in Echo Park in the Dinosaur National Monument
on the Utah-Colorado border. With the Wilderness Society and the
Sierra Club leading the way, the conservationist groups, acting in
concert for one of the first times, blocked the dam and persuaded
Congress to pass the Wilderness Act in 1964 to provide permanent
protection from development for wilderness areas.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, when George B. Hartzog Jr., then director of
the Park Service, announced a plan to build a second highway
through the Smokies, Dickerman quit his job at the button factory
and joined the staff of the Wilderness Society as a full-time
organizer. He traveled the country giving speeches and organizing
hikes against the highway, and the resulting overwhelming public
opposition killed the project.
</P>
<P>
   After he retired from the Wilderness Club in 1976, Dickerman was
given a number of awards from the Sierra Club and other groups for
his work in conservation and environmental protection. But he did
not slow down. He worked for years at promoting conservation from
his cabin on the farm of a nephew, C. Robert Dickerman, his only
survivor.
</P>
<P>
   As he approached his 90s, the phone in his cabin often rang with
calls from young conservationists seeking advice on how to overcome
opposition.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have to keep right on pointing out how important it is to
preserve the wild country,'' Dickerman told them. ``There is always
a lot of opposition to wilderness. People are always a lot more
interested in the short-term economic benefits rather than the
long-term quality-of-life issues.''

FORMER MANHATTAN BOROUGH PRESIDENT SUBPOENAED IN APOLLO INQUIRY 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ABBY GOODNOUGH   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Stepping up its investigation of the Apollo Theater's
tangled finances, the state attorney general's office issued a
subpoena on Tuesday to Percy Sutton, the former Manhattan borough
president, whose business relationship with the foundation that
manages the theater is the focus of the inquiry.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors issued the subpoena a day after Sutton's
company, Inner City Broadcasting, was accused by another company of
striking an illicit deal to retain the syndication rights to a
popular television show broadcast from the historic Harlem theater.
The company, which was also seeking the contract, said that the
Apollo Theater Foundation had secretly allowed Sutton to raise his
bid at the last minute.
</P>
<P>
   The attorney general's office also issued subpoenas to Sutton's
nephew, Chuck Sutton, and his son's ex-wife, Charlotte Sutton.
Chuck Sutton is an executive at Inner City Broadcasting, and
Charlotte Sutton works for the Apollo Theater Foundation, said Marc
Wurzel, a spokesman for Attorney General Dennis Vacco. Calls to
Percy Sutton and Chuck Sutton were not returned on Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   Wurzel would not reveal what investigators want to ask Percy
Sutton. But an official close to the investigation said Chuck
Sutton and Charlotte Sutton were issued subpoenas because they
oversee production of the television show, ``It's Showtime at the
Apollo.'' Inner City Broadcasting has produced the program and
controlled its syndication rights for more than five years.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton invested heavily in the Apollo Theater in the 1980s, but
it lost money, and in 1992 he turned it over to the nonprofit
foundation. But the foundation allowed him to keep control of the
television show, which became profitable in the 1995-1996 season,
under a five-year contract.
</P>
<P>
   The state investigation is focusing on whether the foundation's
board _ whose chairman is Sutton's close friend, Rep. Charles
Rangel, D-N.Y. _ allowed Inner City Broadcasting to underpay it for
control of the television show.
</P>
<P>
   State prosecutors also subpoenaed records Tuesday from the
Monday meeting at which foundation members awarded the one-year
contract to Sutton's company. They also interviewed Frank
Mercado-Valdes, whose broadcasting company, the African Heritage
Network, was the losing bidder for the contract.
</P>
<P>
   In an interview Tuesday, Mercado-Valdes said he had initially
offered the foundation $500,000 for a year's worth of syndication
rights to ``It's Showtime at the Apollo,'' a variety show that is
broadcast in more than 100 cities.
</P>
<P>
   Mercado-Valdes said that the foundation's board of directors
ignored his bid, and that he then doubled it to $1 million, which
he offered to pay up front. Then, in mid-July, Inner City
Broadcasting, which had hoped to renew its contract under the old
terms, offered $1.5 million, Mercado and state officials said.
Mercado-Valdes said he offered a final bid of $1.5 million, which
included $500,000 for renovations to the dilapidated theater, on
July 23, which he said was the deadline.
</P>
<P>
   But a week later, on July 31, the foundation allowed Inner City
Broadcasting to change its bid to $1.6 million, Mercado-Valdes and
state officials said.

WILLIAMS SHOWS OLD WAYS
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
 
By DWAIN PRICE 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   WICHITA FALLS, Texas _ Offensive tackle Erik Williams said he
has long ago regained the stature that five years ago led many to
call him the best offensive lineman in the NFL.
</P>
<P>
   Williams was involved in a serious car accident in Dallas in
October 1994. After knee surgery and rehabilitation, Williams
returned to the field 10 months later.
</P>
<P>
   Williams said the fact that he made the Pro Bowl the past two
years should let everyone know that he is back to his aggressive
ways. And he has one sure-fire way to let everyone know he is
indeed back.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's more of getting you (media) guys to say that I'm back,
instead of constantly asking me how do I feel,'' Williams said. ``I
tell you guys how I feel, and it's like it goes in one ear and
right out the other.
</P>
<P>
   ``I guess when you guys stop asking me that question, it'll be
over with. As far as I'm concerned, I was back two years ago.''
</P>
<P>
   Williams said he is trying to work through some soreness, while
coach Chan Gailey said the eight-year veteran seems to be hustling
more.
</P>
<P>
   ``All I can compare it to is what I saw on tape last year and
where he is now,'' he said. ``He's working his rear off in practice
right now, and it's making him a much better football player for
working on his technique and hustling the way he is.'' &QL; 
HENDERSON IN TOWN &QL;
</P>
<P>
   Harold Henderson, executive vice president of the NFL, was in
town yesterday to visit the Cowboys.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson goes to training camps and talks to players, coaches,
owners and club executives about various issues, including the
league's policies on drug and alcohol abuse, steroids, firearms,
violent crimes, domestic violence, gambling, player benefits,
medical plans, pensions, life insurance, savings and 401(k) plans.
</P>
<P>
   Henderson said the league is not investigating the religious
group Champions for Christ. The New York Times recently reported
that several pro athletes have been giving an inordinate amount of
money to the group.
</P>
<P>
   ``People have been tithing 10 percent of their money for 2,000
years, and people think that's OK,'' Henderson said. ``So I just
think that the league doesn't have any business getting involved in
telling the players how to spend or how to donate their money.'' &QL; 
COWBOYS SIGN TWO &QL;
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys signed defensive end Harold Gragg and defensive back
Terrell Sutton yesterday.
</P>
<P>
   Gragg, 6-foot-4, 270 pounds, played for the Frankfurt Galaxy in
NFL Europe this spring. Gragg, who played at Wake Forest, also was
in camps with the New York Giants and Jacksonville Jaguars last
year, but was released before the seasons started.
</P>
<P>
   Sutton, 6-0, 183, is a rookie free agent from Texas
A&AMP;M-Commerce. This is his first training camp.
</P>
<P>
   The Cowboys also placed linebacker Broderick Thomas on the
injured reserve list. Thomas is out for the season after tearing
the anterior cruciate ligament in his right knee during a July 19
practice. &QL; 
THEY SAID IT &QL;
</P>
<P>
   ``If I get cut and I look in the mirror, and if there's any hair
of a doubt that I did not do everything that I should have done,
then I would be disappointed with myself, and not with the Dallas
Cowboys.'' _ free-agent linebacker K.D. Williams.
</P>
<P>
   ``We have a long ways to go in preseason, so he has to maximize
every opportunity.'' _ Special-teams coach Joe Avezzano, discussing
K.D. Williams.

WORKERS REMOVING BUCKLED SCAFFOLDING IN TIMES SQUARE  
 (HLW) 
</HEADLINE>
   By CHARLES V. BAGLI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Workers are continuing the delicate task of
dismantling the giant construction scaffold that buckled and broke
in Times Square last month, killing a woman in a nearby hotel and
paralyzing traffic for several days.
</P>
<P>
   City officials said on Tuesday that workers have removed the top
three and a half floors of the 48-story, 700-foot scaffold at the
Conde Nast building at the southeast corner of 43rd Street and
Broadway. The city's buildings commissioner, Gaston Silva, said
that workers were forced to cut off sections of the twisted
aluminum beams that were so mangled that they could not be
unbolted.
</P>
<P>
   The commissioner said it was still too early to predict when the
dismantling project would be completed.
</P>
<P>
   ``We anticipate the majority of it will go quickly,'' Silva
said. ``It will slow down in particular areas, depending on the
amount of debris. And when we get to the elevator cabs, it'll be a
more gingerly operation.''
</P>
<P>
   Four different teams of forensic engineers are trying to
determine the reason for the collapse of the scaffold at the 21st
floor. A section of an elevator tower connected to the scaffolding
snapped off, with pieces falling onto the roofs of nearby buildings
and through the roof of the Woodstock Hotel, killing a woman.
</P>
<P>
   Investigators have photographed much of the scaffolding and are
tagging specific beams and bars that may shed light on the cause of
the July 21 accident. Much of their attention is focused on the
20th through 25th floors, city officials said.
</P>
<P>
   Each floor of the scaffolding is being packed into a bin and
shipped to a city pier, where individual sections may be
reassembled.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, inspectors from the Federal Occupational Safety and
Health Administration are continuing their investigation of the
incident, as well as the death of a carpenter in an earlier
accident.

UCLA PICKED TO WIN CONFERENCE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By SCOTT WOLF  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ With a Heisman Trophy candidate at quarterback and
last year's 10-game winning streak fresh in everyone's minds, UCLA
was picked to win the Pacific-10 Conference in the annual preseason
media poll released Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``You guys picked us to win the league? Thanks a lot,'' UCLA
coach Bob Toledo joked.
</P>
<P>
   But then getting serious, Toledo said, ``I think that's great.
It's exciting.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's a different football team. It's not the same team as the
one that finished fifth in the country. (But) that's what's
exciting about coaching.''
</P>
<P>
   The Bruins edged Arizona State by three points in the poll,
which has correctly picked the winner just once in the past five
years.
</P>
<P>
   UCLA returns Cade McNown, the first Bruins quarterback to throw
for more than 3,000 yards. The Bruins also return six other
starters on offense along with four on defense.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's a lot of enthusiasm, a lot of excitement at UCLA at
this particular time,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps most important, UCLA returns three starters on its
offensive line: Kris Farris, Shawn Stuart and Andy Meyers. Toledo
said they will form the core of the offensive unit.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think when you have three starters return that have played
23 games, it gives you a pretty good start,'' Toledo said.
</P>
<P>
   One factor that excited Toledo was his recruiting class. He
singled out four incoming freshmen who he believed will make an
immediate impact: tailback DeShaun Foster; linebacker Robert
Thomas, whom Toledo said could start before the end of the season;
defensive tackle Ken Kocher; and defensive back Lovell Houston.
</P>
<P>
   ``We think it's a good class,'' Toledo said. ``How good I'm not
sure.''
</P>
<P>
   UCLA opens its season Sept. 12 against Texas at the Rose Bowl.

NCAA adds penalties to Tech 
(For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By JIMMY BURCH 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   LUBBOCK, Texas _ Members of the NCAA Committee on Infractions
announced additional scholarship cutbacks, financial penalties and
an extended probation period Tuesday for a Texas Tech athletic
department that allowed at least 76 athletes in nine sports to
participate while academically ineligible between 1991-97.
</P>
<P>
   But committee members opted not to add bans on television
appearances or postseason participation to the self-imposed
sanctions enacted by Tech administrators. As a result, all Tech
athletics teams will be eligible to compete for Big 12
championships, accept bowl bids and take part in postseason
tournaments in the 1998-99 academic year.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's a breath of fresh air,'' said Tech football coach Spike
Dykes, whose 1997 football team was declared ineligible to compete
for the Big 12 title and banned from bowl considerations by school
administrators. ``Any time you have a chance to play for something,
it makes a big difference.''
</P>
<P>
   Bonnie Slatton, acting chair of the committee on infractions,
said Tech escaped additional postseason sanctions because committee
members considered it rare and commendable that school
administrators voluntarily prevented a 6-5 football team from
accepting a 1997 bowl bid and would not allow a 19-9 men's
basketball team to accept a berth in the 1997 NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are penalties that institutions rarely, if ever, would
place on themselves,'' Slatton said. ``We commend them. We thought
it showed seriousness on Tech's part. We felt that accomplished
what a TV ban would do.''
</P>
<P>
   Although committee members cited Tech's self-imposed sanctions
as ``meaningful and significant,'' they extended the school's
probation period to four years (through 2002) and recommended that
the school repay at least $380,000 in revenues from the 1996 men's
basketball tournament, as well as forfeit future distributions from
the tournament through 2002.
</P>
<P>
   Committee members also announced additional scholarship
reductions in football, men's basketball, women's basketball and
baseball. The breakdown:
</P>
<P>
   Tech lost four football scholarships for the 2000-2001 academic
year, bringing the total to 18 in a three-year period. Tech
self-imposed an eight scholarship reduction on its 1998 signing
class in February and will be able to sign a maximum of 19 and 21
players, respectively, during the next two years. In addition, Tech
can have no more than 80 players on scholarship (five below the
NCAA maximum) for the 1999 and 2000 seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Tech lost one additional scholarship in men's basketball,
bringing the total to seven during the next three years. During
that time, Tech can have no more than 11 players on scholarship
(two below the NCAA maximum) in any one season.
</P>
<P>
   Tech lost one additional scholarship in women's basketball for
the 1999-2000 academic year, bringing the total to two. Tech can
have only 14 players on scholarship (one below the NCAA maximum)
this season and next season.
</P>
<P>
   Tech lost three additional baseball scholarships for the
2001-2002 academic year, bringing the total to nine during a
three-year period. Tech can award only 8.7 scholarships per season
(three below the NCAA maximum) in each of the next three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Among the violations cited by NCAA officials were: lax academic
certification procedures that led to the widespread use of
ineligible players; special privileges given athletes by local
attorneys (including a former regent) and a local bail bondsman;
academic fraud and extra benefits provided by assistant coaches in
football and men's basketball.
</P>
<P>
   Because Tech's violations are considered major, the school is
subject to the NCAA's ``death penalty'' provision _ which allows
for the shutdown of a sports program _ if additional major
violations are discovered within a five-year period. The sports
affected include football, baseball, men's golf, men's and women's
basketball, men's track, women's soccer, volleyball and men's
tennis.
</P>
<P>
   Tech Chancellor John T. Montford said the university would not
appeal the sanctions.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA sanctions of basketball tournament money already has
cost Tech $380,000 and could wind up costing Tech approximately $1
million in lost basketball tournament revenue. Just how much Tech
will lose will be based on the NCAA's tournament revenue
distribution formula, which is based on a rolling six-year
appearance factor and varies from year to year.
</P>
<P>
   The infractions committee recommended the full penalty, 90
percent, allowed under NCAA bylaws. The committee's recommendation
must be approved by the NCAA Division I Championships/Competition
Cabinet, and that approval is expected, an NCAA source source.
</P>
<P>
   Montford, who mandated the self-imposed bans on postseason
competition in football and men's basketball in 1997, estimated
that the 20-month NCAA probe has cost Tech more than $3 million in
legal fees and lost revenues. Avoiding additional postseason
sanctions in football, he said, was significant from a financial
standpoint. Big 12 bylaws prevent schools barred from bowls from
sharing in distribution of alliance-bowl revenues, which exceeded
$16 million in 1996 and 1997.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was concerned about a multiyear bowl ban because the revenue
implications are considerable. That cost Tech more than $1 million
last year,'' Montford said. ``I am pleased to get this to closure.
I am pleased we were not given another postseason ban.''
</P>
<P>
   Montford praised the NCAA for being ``fundamentally fair''
during the investigation and in handing down Tuesday's sanctions.
He said he disagreed with suggestions that Tech ``got off light''
because the school did not receive additional postseason bans as
part of its penalties.
</P>
<P>
   ``If this were a cold case and today they announced everything
we did, plus what they did, I think everybody would have a
different reaction,'' Montford said. ``I also detected ... a
sensitivity \Rby NCAA officials\S for not having existing players
pay the price for what occurred at a time when they did not have
anything to do with it.''
</P>
<P>
   In announcing the penalties, Slatton said: ``We tried to affect
the current student-athletes as little as possible. Because of the
length of time in these penalties, we felt ... \RTech's 1997
postseason bans\S were significant and adequate in that regard.''
</P>
<P>
   Across the board, Tech administrators, coaches and athletes
expressed relief that the school's sanctions are public knowledge
and no longer a source of speculation during recruiting campaigns
or in media reports detailing worst-case scenarios.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm relieved ... we finally put this to rest,'' said Gerald
Myers, the Tech athletic director. ``It's been constantly on the
mind of everyone out here the past two years. I'm pleased there are
no further postseason sanctions . . . but these are significant and
severe sanctions we're dealing with, especially what we have to
face in scholarship reductions. That's the lifeblood of your
program.''

CRITICISM FROM PEERS PUTS FOLEY ON DEFENSIVE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By GERALD ESKENAZI   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   HEMPSTEAD, N.Y. _ Reacting with annoyance Tuesday, Glenn Foley
said he was surprised that Neil O'Donnell appeared to denigrate
Foley's ability.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell, who is battling another former Jet, Jeff Blake, for
the Cincinnati Bengals' starting job, spoke recently about the
Jets' training camp last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``I didn't think there was a better quarterback in camp than
me,'' O'Donnell said. ``I thought I proved that.''
</P>
<P>
   Describing Foley's role this season as a starter rather than a
backup, O'Donnell said: ``It's totally different when you are
taking the snaps every day. What do they say, `The best job in
America is backup quarterback, right?'''
</P>
<P>
   Foley is sensitive about the twists and turns his career has
taken. He has had to battle three quarterbacks who were considered
better than he was to reach his current status: starter for
Thursday night's preseason opener against the Philadelphia Eagles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've never been able to shake that underdog label,'' Foley
said. ``It's been tough gaining respect.''
</P>
<P>
   Four years ago, Blake put down Foley's talent after he lost a
battle with him.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday, Foley ruefully recalled Blake and O'Donnell, his former
opponents for the quarterback's job on the team.
</P>
<P>
   ``You have two guys, once they were beaten, left with negative
comments,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley remembered Blake's controversial comments that hinted at
racism as playing a role back in 1994, when the rookie Foley was
only a seventh-round selection and the Jets' final draft pick.
Blake was a sixth-round choice two years earlier. When Blake was
cut, he spoke of Foley's ``blue eyes.''
</P>
<P>
   And then, of course, there was O'Donnell, who led the Pittsburgh
Steelers to a Super Bowl and then became a Jet two years ago. But
he was benched for Foley last season and then was unceremoniously
cut by Bill Parcells in June after refusing to take a $2.2 million
pay cut.
</P>
<P>
   Of Blake's and O'Donnell's comments, Foley said he was ``totally
surprised.''
</P>
<P>
   ``They never said anything to me,'' Foley said.
</P>
<P>
   Foley's latest challenger is Vinny Testaverde, a Heisman Trophy
winner who joined the Jets in June and has been promised that if he
outplays Foley, he will start. But their relationship appears to be
good.
</P>
<P>
   Foley has an ally in Coach Bill Parcells, who addressed the
quarterback's critics and those who wondered about his ability.
</P>
<P>
   ``I told you what would happen,'' Parcells said as he considered
Foley's early camp troubles that included batted-down passes and
incomplete throws. ``I've seen better from him. I know what he can
do.''
</P>
<P>
   In last Saturday's scrimmage, Foley connected on 12 of 14
attempts and looked smart running the team.
</P>
<P>
   O'Donnell and Parcells agree on at least one area: that starting
is different from coming in off the bench. Parcells admits that
that is an unknown factor in Foley's future performance.
</P>
<P>
   But Foley is here and O'Donnell is not. As Foley put it Tuesdy:
``He was unhappy. He left unhappy.''
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   It is almost game time and BILL PARCELLS is getting testy. At
the last full workout before the exhibition opener at Philadelphia,
he counted bodies. There were only 10 on the kickoff scout team.
``Who's missing, Mike?'' he shouted across the field to the special
teams coach MIKE SWEATMAN. ``KYLE BRADY,'' Sweatman shouted back.
``Brady!'' Parcells commanded, and pointed to the far fence 60
yards away. Brady ran to the fence and back. When practice was
ending, Parcells still wasn't happy. There was an offsides. He had
the entire offense run to that fence. Finally, after practice,
Parcells made all 80 players line up in a 3-point stance. If just
one player jumped offsides before Parcells blew the whistle, the
entire unit had to start again. They did it a dozen times.
</P>
<P>
   Running back CURTIS MARTIN will be held out Thursday if he is
not over his hamstring injury. . . . The Jets will use three
quarterbacks in the game: GLENN FOLEY, VINNY TESTAVERDE and RAY
LUCAS. CHUCK CLEMENTS will get a chance to play in the club's
second exhibition, against Baltimore. . . BRYAN COX lost six pounds
in his first day with the club on Monday, Parcells said. He said he
expects the linebacker to be in shape by the season's opener.

YANKEES 10, A'S 4
</HEADLINE>
   (Eds: will be subbed with results of second game of doubleheader) 
(nk) 
 By BUSTER OLNEY   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   OAKLAND, Calif. _ Chuck Knoblauch occasionally swings with the
recklessness of a second-string lumberjack, his head jerking
violently and his eyes losing track of the baseball, as if he's
trying to hit the ball 600 feet.
</P>
<P>
   More and more, however, he is hitting the ball solidly, and good
things are happening. Knoblauch slugged his 13th home run to lead
off the game Tuesday as the Yankees beat the Oakland Athletics,
10-4, in the opener of a doubleheader.
</P>
<P>
   The victory made the Yankees 79-28 after 107 games; they have
held a lead in 97 of them.
</P>
<P>
   Ramiro Mendoza (7-2) pitched six and one-third innings and
preserved the Yankees' bullpen for the second game, which was
important, because Mike Buddie, normally a reliever who pitches an
inning or two at a time, started the second game in place of Andy
Pettitte, who is nursing a shoulder strain.
</P>
<P>
   Darryl Strawberry's limp is noticeable when he runs or jogs
around the bases, but not when he swings. Strawberry blasted a
two-run homer, his fourth home run in his last four starts and his
19th of the year, the most he has hit since getting 28 for the Los
Angeles Dodgers in 1991.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry will very likely continue to play. Chili Davis, the
designated hitter in waiting, is coming back from ankle surgery and
apparently had a setback in his rehabilitation game with Class AA
Norwich Tuesday night. Davis was removed before his full complement
of at-bats, and Yankee officials were in the process of gathering a
report from the Norwich trainers.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry is leading the Yankees in home runs, and averaging 1
for every 11.4 at-bats. He has 46 runs batted in, and if projected
over a typical 500 at-bat season, Strawberry would be on a pace to
drive in 106 runs.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch is producing runs, too, though his batting average
sank below .250 last week. Knoblauch has 78 runs scored and has
driven in 51, and his 13 home runs match a career high.
</P>
<P>
   As the game's first batter, Knoblauch fought Jay Witasick for
six pitches, fouling off a 3-2 pitch. Witasick tried blowing a
fastball past Knoblauch, and he slammed it over the left-field
wall.
</P>
<P>
   Oakland scored three runs in the second and led, 3-1, but the
Yankees stormed back in the third.
</P>
<P>
   Knoblauch reached first on an error, and Jeter walked. After
Paul O'Neill flied to center, Bernie Williams singled through the
middle, and Knoblauch sprinted homeward with the Yankees' second
run.
</P>
<P>
   Witasick _ who threw 78 pitches in the first three innings _
walked Tino Martinez, loading the bases. After Strawberry flied to
short right field, Curtis ripped a single to center, driving home
two runs. Oakland trailed, 5-3.
</P>
<P>
   Strawberry's two-run homer in the fifth put the game out of
reach.
</P>
<P>
   INSIDE PITCH
</P>
<P>
   The Yankees committed four errors in the first game, more than
they had committed in any other game this season. Third baseman
Scott Brosius was charged with three and now has 21 for the season.
First baseman Tino Martinez had the other, his ninth.

ERROR COULD COST CONGRESSWOMAN A PLACE ON BALLOT 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RAYMOND HERNANDEZ   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Two years ago, state lawmakers passed legislation
intended to sweep away a host of byzantine election requirements
that had made it extraordinarily difficult for candidates to get on
the ballot in New York.
</P>
<P>
   But Tuesday, Rep. Sue Kelly, a Westchester Republican, suddenly
found her place on November's ballot in question because she failed
to comply with one arcane rule that the 1996 law left untouched:
She did not number the pages of her ballot petitions.
</P>
<P>
   In a hearing Tuesday morning, the chairwoman of the state Board
of Elections, Carol Berman, a Democrat, recommended that Ms.
Kelly's petitions to be placed on the Republican and Conservative
lines be invalidated because of this omission. The recommendation
came in response to a complaint filed by the Democratic nominee for
Ms. Kelly's 19th District seat, Dick Collins.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, it is uncertain whether the chairwoman's
recommendation will be supported by the four-member elections
board, which is evenly divided between Democrats and Republicans.
But the episode has raised concerns among many good-government
groups that the ballot-access changes passed two years ago did not
go far enough to streamline a system that has long been considered
among the most burdensome in the nation.
</P>
<P>
   ``The ballot-access reforms that were passed in 1996 clearly
didn't solve the whole problem,'' said Gene Russianoff, a lobbyist
for the New York Public Interest Research Group. ``So now you've
got people using whatever is left in the election law to knock
people off the ballot. Old habits die hard.''
</P>
<P>
   E. Joshua Rosenkranz, an election-law expert and executive
director of the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University
Law School, agreed. ``This is so outrageous,'' he said. ``New York
has always been out of sync with the rest of the civilized world
when it came to ballot access. All that was supposed to have
changed with the new legislation. But the Sue Kelly story
demonstrates that you can change the law but the antidemocratic
culture remains.''
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Ms. Kelly, a Katonah businesswoman who was first
elected in 1994, argued that the 1996 law provides a three-day
grace period to correct technical mistakes in petitions. But Lee
Daghlian, a spokesman for the state Board of Elections, disputed
that, saying the grace period could be used only to repair the
cover sheet, not the petition pages themselves.
</P>
<P>
   Though experts agree that Daghlian's strict reading of the law
is correct, they say invalidation of Ms. Kelly's petitions over
such a minor issue violates the spirit of the legislation, which
envisioned rejecting signatures only because of fraud.
</P>
<P>
   A campaign adviser to Ms. Kelly, Jay Townsend, sharply
criticized the ballot-access rules, calling them ``restrictive and
silly.''
</P>
<P>
   He added, ``I've worked in states where you walk in, pay a $50
filing fee and then you can run.''
</P>
<P>
   The board is scheduled to vote on Ms. Kelly's case on Monday,
and the two Republican members will clearly be under immense
pressure from party leaders to block Ms. Berman's proposal. If the
vote follows party lines, and the board ties on the issue, Ms.
Kelly will be allowed on the ballot.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   The 1996 legislation was intended to eliminate technicalities
that protected incumbents by making it extraordinarily hard for
challengers within their party to get on the ballot in New York.
Lawmakers passed the measure after state Republican Party leaders
came under attack for using the ballot laws to keep challengers to
Sen. Bob Dole, the candidate favored by the state party, out of the
Republican presidential primary that year.
</P>
<P>
   Among other things, the legislation removed rules requiring
candidates to insure that signature petitions included certain
specific information, like a signer's election district and
Assembly district. Another rule that was eliminated mandated that
the petitions had to be presented on paper of a certain size and
color.
</P>
<P>
   But, election-law experts say, Ms. Kelly's case shows that the
state's ballot-access laws need to be revised further to make the
system truly open.
</P>
<P>
   ``We made a lot of changes in 1996 by eliminating a lot of the
Mickey Mouse booby traps,'' said Jerome Koenig, a former chief of
staff for the Assembly's Election Law Committee. ``But there are
still some left and it is hard to eliminate them all.''
</P>
<P>
   Blair Horner, the legislative director for the New York Public
Interest Research Group, said his organization had pressed
lawmakers in 1996 to eliminate the provision requiring that
petition sheets be numbered, as well as another one that forbids
voters from signing more than one nominating petition. The latter
proposal would have ended a longtime party practice of flooding
neighborhoods with volunteers to collect signatures from a large
number of eligible voters and thus leaving behind few to sign
challengers' petitions.
</P>
<P>
   ``We were able to knock out a lot of the ridiculous
requirements,'' he said. ``Unfortunately, a lot of them remained
even though they are petty, obscure and indefensible.''

NECK INJURY STOPS MILLER FOR SEASON, AT THE LEAST 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By BILL PENNINGTON   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   ALBANY, N.Y. _ Corey Miller, whose tenure with the New York
Giants dates to his days as a backup to Lawrence Taylor, will not
play this season and is on the verge of retirement after tests
revealed that he has a herniated disk in his neck, an injury that
caused some temporary paralysis in a practice last week.
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who has not practiced for two days, said Tuesday at
Giants training camp that his football career could continue only
if he had season-ending neck fusion surgery. But Miller, who will
turn 30 in October, suggested he is leaning toward retirement
instead.
</P>
<P>
   ``If I have the surgery,'' said Miller, a starter at linebacker
since 1992, ``who's going to sign me, a 30-year-old guy with a bad
neck? I've got to be realistic.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is my neck. I feel great, but with one shot, somebody
could be coming out to take me off the field. That's not a pretty
sight, and I'm kind of worried about it.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller said no one jarring hit had caused the injury. But he
conceded that after a routine collision in practice with running
back Tyrone Wheatley, he felt numbness and a lack of movement in
his left arm and fingers. Miller, who has started 70 games at
strongside linebacker for the Giants, regained the use of his arm
and returned to practice.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think this is an injury that's really been building over the
years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Miller did not miss a practice last week and also participated
in the Giants' full-contact scrimmage Saturday.
</P>
<P>
   On consecutive nights over the weekend, however, Miller
experienced intense pain in his neck and weakness in his left arm.
When Miller related his symptoms to Giants doctors, they set up a
series of X-rays, including two magnetic resonance imaging tests
that revealed the bulging disk between the C-6 and C-7 vertebrae.
</P>
<P>
   Giants coach Jim Fassel said Tuesday that Marcus Buckley, who
has started 13 National Football League games in a six-year career,
would take Miller's spot in the starting lineup.
</P>
<P>
   Fassel added that the team would make a more conclusive
announcement about Miller's status Wednesday after additional
medical opinions were solicited.
</P>
<P>
   Miller agreed that he was going to consult with two other neck
specialists, but he left little doubt that his 1998 season was
over.
</P>
<P>
   ``Unless some miracle makes this go away,'' he said. ``It's
unrealistic.''
</P>
<P>
   Miller, who is married and has two young sons, added that his
family responsibilities will weigh heavily on his final decision.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been a Giant for eight years, made a lot of money and
have outside businesses to fall back on,'' said Miller, who owns a
men's store and a shoe store in his hometown of Columbia, S.C.
``I'm not going to rush my decision, but I'm at peace if I can't
play.
</P>
<P>
   ``I still love the game, but it may be too dangerous for me to
be out there. I feel blessed that they found it when they did. I
could have gotten hit and been paralyzed.''
</P>
<P>
   Giants trainer Ronnie Barnes said Miller, who is taking steroids
to help shrink the bulging disk, would consult with Dr. Russell
Warren, the team physician, on Wednesday, and then visit two neck
specialists, Dr. Michael Schafer in Chicago and Dr. Craig Brigham
in Charlotte, N.C.
</P>
<P>
   Brigham operated on the former Green Bay Packers receiver
Sterling Sharpe, who had a neck injury that ended his career.
Miller and Sharpe played together at the University of South
Carolina and are friends.
</P>
<P>
   According to Miller, the surgery he may face would be similar to
the neck fusion surgery performed on Giants wide receiver Ike
Hilliard last September. Hilliard was cleared to return to the team
eight months later and has participated fully in all drills so far.
</P>
<P>
   Miller acknowledged that he still had some weakness in his left
arm and might need surgery, anyway, to regain total use of the arm.
But he said he was also told by doctors that with rest and
medication _ and without the contact of pro football _ the disk
would probably not be a problem for him in the future.
</P>
<P>
   Miller's injury at camp followed what was a tumultuous off
season for him. When the Giants signed Buckley, who was Miller's
backup last season, to a free-agent contract in February, it was
with the understanding that Buckley might soon assume the starting
job at strongside linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   During the next several months, the Giants tried to persuade
Miller to take a pay cut because he was no longer the clear-cut
starter. Miller resisted and missed most of the team's off-season
workouts, which irked Fassel.
</P>
<P>
   Finally, in June, Miller agreed to cut $600,000 from his $1.5
million salary for 1998.
</P>
<P>
   While Buckley has impressed the Giants' coaches in training
camp, he does not have Miller's experience and has not proved that
he can be effective against the run, a key skill for a strongside
linebacker.
</P>
<P>
   Buckley's backup would be the second-year player Ryan Phillips,
a converted defensive end.
</P>
<P>
   EXTRA POINTS
</P>
<P>
   _ The rookie JOE JUREVICIUS missed his second consecutive day of
practice. Jurevicius, hospitalized Monday night with what the team
called the flu, was released from an Albany-area hospital Tuesday
afternoon.
</P>
<P>
   _ TYRONE WHEATLEY is showing no effects from his hip flexor
injury last week.
</P>
<P>
   _ The Giants' offense, fresh off its undistinguished performance
in Saturday's scrimmage, looked better against the defense Tuesday,
especially the wide receivers OMAR DOUGLAS, CHRIS CALLOWAY and IKE
HILLIARD.  &QL;

FABRICE SIMON, 47, DESIGNER OF GLITTERY EVENING CLOTHES

 By ANNE-MARIE SCHIRO   c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Fabrice Simon, the fashion designer known
professionally as Fabrice, whose glittering evening wear symbolized
the glamour of the high-flying 1980s, died July 29. He was 47.
</P>
<P>
   The cause was AIDS, his family said Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   At the height of his success, Simon (pronounced see-MOHN)
dressed women in society and show business in dresses that were
elaborately beaded and jeweled and that were guaranteed to draw the
spotlight. In lightweight fabrics like georgette and crepe de
chine, and fit to cling to the body, the dresses tended to have a
sensuous look, shimmering with abstract designs that were sometimes
inspired by graffiti or modern art. He won a special Coty Fashion
Critics Award in 1981 for his beaded dresses.
</P>
<P>
   The socialite Cornelia Guest wore a Fabrice design at her
coming-out party and became a faithful client and friend. Simon
also designed special-occasion dresses for Kathleen Turner, Shirley
MacLaine, Natalie Cole, Ivana Trump, Nina Griscom and Whitney
Houston in addition to celebrity models like Iman, Beverly Johnson,
Christie Brinkley and Jerry Hall.
</P>
<P>
   He also designed formal wear for men, although it was anything
but traditional dinner suits. His designs included such items as
silk T-shirts worn with suspenders and damask or boldly checked
jackets.
</P>
<P>
   Born in Port-au-Prince, Haiti, on Jan. 29, 1951, Fabrice Simon
came to New York in 1964, graduated from Flushing High School in
Queens and studied textile design and fashion illustration at the
Fashion Institute of Technology. After working as a textile
designer for five years, he took some silks on which he had
hand-painted or air-brushed patterns, whipped them into dresses and
_ voila! _ had his first fashion collection. That was in 1976. The
dresses were bought by Henri Bendel, a 57th Street store known in
those years for showcasing unknown designers. In fact, when the
store was bought by the Limited and moved to 56th Street and Fifth
Avenue in 1991, it was still carrying Fabrice designs.
</P>
<P>
   At first he both painted and sewed all the clothes. Then a few
years later his sister, Brigitte, brought a piece of beaded
embroidery from Haiti to New York and asked him to fashion it into
a dress.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was intrigued by the idea,'' Simon was quoted as saying in a
1983 article in The New York Times, ``and I designed a very simple
blouse with a star-burst pattern and had it embroidered in Haiti in
copper beads.''
</P>
<P>
   The result pleased Simon, who then commissioned Haitian beaders
and embroiderers to execute his designs. His timing was superb. It
was 1980, and elaborately beaded clothes seemed to be just what the
newly rich were hungering for.
</P>
<P>
   Through his friendships with Ms. Guest and the models Toukie
Smith and Beverly Johnson, he also became part of the '80s scene.
His summer home on Fire Island was a meeting place for fashion
models, photographers and stylists. His sexy dresses adorned many a
magazine cover.
</P>
<P>
   Simon's early designs were mainly in black and silver, which he
called ``very sophisticated, like diamonds.'' He later broadened
his range to include colors and even some daytime clothes, often
adding beading to simple sweaters. But he rejected mass-produced
sequins-by-the-yard. Each bead had to be sewn on individually.
</P>
<P>
   ``They are my artwork,'' the designer said. ``Before I make the
dress, I draw the patterns. I make sure the design has the right
proportions for the dress.''
</P>
<P>
   He designed custom and ready-to-wear clothing until what came to
be known as the gilded decade came to an abrupt end with the stock
market decline of 1987. After that he concentrated on custom-made
designs for private clients.
</P>
<P>
   In 1994 he shuttered his business and returned to what he called
his first love: painting. The art was in many ways an extension of
his fashion design. The paintings were color-drenched abstracts
that could easily be envisioned as patterns for beadwork. His
paintings were exhibited last year in Palm Beach, Fla., and at the
Jamson Whyte gallery on Wooster Street in New York.
</P>
<P>
   He is survived by his sister, Brigitte Steibel, and a brother,
Andre Simon, both of New York.

REVERSAL OF FORTUNE IN CONGO

<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editoril for Wednesday, Aug. 5:
</P>
<P>
   Few African leaders have squandered political opportunities
faster than Congo's president, Laurent Kabila. His authoritarianism
and ineptitude have cost the Congolese people their best chance in
a generation for democracy and economic renewal. Unless he
radically changes his style of government, he now risks losing his
grip on power itself.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 15 months after sweeping the corrupt dictatorship of
Mobutu Sese Seko from power, Kabila faces a serious military
revolt. The rebels, led by some of his original supporters and
based in the same areas that nurtured his own rise to power, have
captured two eastern cities. Neighboring countries that once backed
Kabila have turned against him. Meanwhile the United States, which
has given him crucial diplomatic support, has become disenchanted
with his performance.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's plight is mainly the result of his own mistakes.
Carried to power by a military insurgency, he based his regime on a
narrow clique of supporters, made up largely of Rwandan military
men who had helped him to victory and eastern Congolese from the
Tutsi minority.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's supporters proved more interested in eliminating their
tribal enemies in eastern border areas than in establishing a
democratic political system. To shield these supporters, Kabila
obstructed U.N. efforts to investigate alleged tribal massacres. In
the course of doing so, he misled U.S. diplomats and betrayed
commitments to the United States that he would permit a fair
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Kabila's undisciplined troops never succeeded in pacifying
the eastern border region. As a result, Rwanda and Uganda, which
with Angola were once Kabila's military sponsors, withdrew their
support. After Kabila expelled Rwandan troops, Rwanda began backing
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   With the new insurgency advancing rapidly, Kabila's best hope
for rallying support lies in broadening and democratizing his rule.
But his record to date provides no basis for optimism.

U.S. team pummels 
early favorite Aussies
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By EDDIE SEFKO &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ The Australians were one of the favorites coming
into the FIBA World Championship of Basketball, but the U.S. team,
gaining confidence by the day, put the Aussies in a familiar
position _ down under, on the scoreboard at least.
</P>
<P>
   A barrage of 3-pointers and the most aggressive defense of the
tournament led the Americans to a 96-78 whacking of Australia,
eliminating it from medal contention. The runaway win Tuesday left
the United States as the No. 1 seed coming out of its group with a
5-1 record. In the quarterfinals Friday, the Americans play Italy,
which finished No. 4 in the opposite group and which the U.S. team
beat 80-75 in an exhibition two weeks ago.
</P>
<P>
   The United States needs three wins for the gold medal. Any loss
means elimination from gold-medal contention.
</P>
<P>
   If the Americans can duplicate their play of Tuesday when the
tournament resumes, they might be dangling gold medals around their
necks Sunday. Don't be confused by the relative closeness of the
score. They led Australia by 20 less than 14 minutes into the game
and widened the advantage to 89-59 late in the game before a token
rally by the Aussies closed the gap.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is exactly what we wanted, the No. 1 seed from our
group,'' said Jimmy Oliver, who poured in 18 points and nailed all
three of his 3-point attempts. ``Now we've got Italy, which was No.
4 in the other group. But we barely beat them when we played them
(in an exhibition). And they beat Yugoslavia. So it's going to be
tough for us.''
</P>
<P>
   Perhaps not, if the Americans continue to be aggressive and
shoot the ball as well as they did Tuesday. They canned 61 percent
of their shots but were even better the farther away they got,
knocking in eight of 12 3-pointers.
</P>
<P>
   Who needs the Dream Team, anyway?
</P>
<P>
   Not Shane Heal, that's for sure. The former Minnesota
Timberwolves guard poured in 31 points for Australia, but he said
the big American win was a strong argument for how good U.S.
players are.
</P>
<P>
   ``I knew they'd put together a very good team,'' he said. ``They
are the No. 1 nation in basketball in the world. Everybody in the
world, I think, knows that. But you just never know what's going to
happen when you put a team of all-stars together that obviously
doesn't have the same talent as the Dream Team. It gives everybody
else an opportunity. But then I think this shows the rest of the
world what a powerhouse American basketball really is.''
</P>
<P>
   Heal also installed the United States as one of the teams to
beat as the tournament gets serious over the weekend _ assuming it
can continue to shoot as well as it did Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   ``They shot the ball about as well as anybody I've seen,'' Heal
said. ``The USA, obviously, in this group is the favorite. I
wouldn't be surprised to see Yugoslavia and the USA play for the
gold. But obviously, on any night, any of these remaining teams can
win. And I think Greece will be tough because the Greek fans add an
extra five or 10 points.''
</P>
<P>
   Even that wouldn't have helped Heal's team, which was dominated
start to finish by the United States.
</P>
<P>
   The key to the game was the Americans didn't dawdle in the early
going. In the loss to Lithuania and the nail-biting win over Spain,
they fell behind by double-figure margins early, then had to rally.
</P>
<P>
   ``We didn't get off to the slow start like we have in some of
the other games,'' said Wendell Alexis, who had 13 points. ``We
knew that we couldn't come out and give Australia any kind of
confidence. They were kind of looking over their shoulders, so we
went out there and put it to them early.''
</P>
<P>
   The Americans have played themselves into an enviable position
with a sweep of the second round. But in reality, the tournament
starts Friday, when one loss puts you out of gold-medal contention.
It's sort of like the Elite Eight in the NCAA Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was never in the position where we were in the Elite Eight
in college,'' said Oliver, who attended Purdue. ``All I can say is
the only thing that matters is going out to win the game at all
cost. I couldn't care less who else wins as long as we do. All we
need is three more wins. It sounds simple. But it's difficult.''
</P>
<P>
   As Alexis said: ``Now, it's like the homestretch. A lot of teams
will have their backs against the wall. But we have everything to
gain. Our intention was to get the first seed. On Friday, we take
the first step as far as getting to the gold medal.''
</P>
<P>
   And after clubbing the Aussies, there's reason for the U.S.
contingent to brim with confidence.
</P>
<P>
   ``The only team that can stop us is ourselves,'' said Brad
Miller, the center who continues to provide heart and soul off the
bench.
</P>
<P>
   It's beginning to look like it's contagious. &QL;

   The New York Times said in an editoril for Wednesday, Aug. 5:
</P>
<P>
   Few African leaders have squandered political opportunities
faster than Congo's president, Laurent Kabila. His authoritarianism
and ineptitude have cost the Congolese people their best chance in
a generation for democracy and economic renewal. Unless he
radically changes his style of government, he now risks losing his
grip on power itself.
</P>
<P>
   Less than 15 months after sweeping the corrupt dictatorship of
Mobutu Sese Seko from power, Kabila faces a serious military
revolt. The rebels, led by some of his original supporters and
based in the same areas that nurtured his own rise to power, have
captured two eastern cities. Neighboring countries that once backed
Kabila have turned against him. Meanwhile the United States, which
has given him crucial diplomatic support, has become disenchanted
with his performance.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's plight is mainly the result of his own mistakes.
Carried to power by a military insurgency, he based his regime on a
narrow clique of supporters, made up largely of Rwandan military
men who had helped him to victory and eastern Congolese from the
Tutsi minority.
</P>
<P>
   Kabila's supporters proved more interested in eliminating their
tribal enemies in eastern border areas than in establishing a
democratic political system. To shield these supporters, Kabila
obstructed U.N. efforts to investigate alleged tribal massacres. In
the course of doing so, he misled U.S. diplomats and betrayed
commitments to the United States that he would permit a fair
investigation.
</P>
<P>
   But Kabila's undisciplined troops never succeeded in pacifying
the eastern border region. As a result, Rwanda and Uganda, which
with Angola were once Kabila's military sponsors, withdrew their
support. After Kabila expelled Rwandan troops, Rwanda began backing
the rebels.
</P>
<P>
   With the new insurgency advancing rapidly, Kabila's best hope
for rallying support lies in broadening and democratizing his rule.
But his record to date provides no basis for optimism.

EDITORIAL: LEAVE THE OIL RESERVE ALONE 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 5:
</P>
<P>
   Interior Secretary Bruce Babbitt will announce Thursday whether
he favors opening up an environmentally fragile corner of the
National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska to oil exploration, and if so,
under what conditions. Gov. Tony Knowles wants it opened up, as
does Alaska's congressional delegation and several big oil
companies. Babbitt should say no to all of them.
</P>
<P>
   The area was set aside as an emergency oil reserve for the Navy
in 1923, and even now is regarded under federal law as a resource
to be tapped only in compelling circumstances. With supplies
plentiful and prices low, there is no reason to drill in this
sensitive area or expend a resource that may be required later.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles, a Democrat running for re-election this year in a state
that is essentially underwritten by oil royalties and taxes, argues
that production from the Prudhoe Bay oilfields is declining and
that both he and the oil industry have already been denied an even
bigger prize _ the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, which President
Clinton declared off limits to drilling when Congress tried to open
it up in 1995. Knowles presented his case when Clinton stopped over
in Alaska in 1996. Clinton referred the matter to Babbitt, who
undertook an 18-month study to see whether and how a
4.6-million-acre corner of the 23-million-acre preserve could be
opened for leasing.
</P>
<P>
   Knowles and the oil companies have had the upper hand in this
fight, in part because the president is sympathetic to the cause of
Democratic self-preservation and in part because some environmental
groups had already weakened their case by offering exploration in
the reserve as an alternative to despoiling the refuge. With
decision day near, Babbitt is said to favor the granting of
exploratory leases on some of the 4.6 million acres.
</P>
<P>
   That would be an environmental mistake and a blemish on a record
that has often been praised in this space. The secretary would be
better advised to seek permanent wilderness protection for the two
most sensitive areas coveted by the oil companies, Teshepuk Lake
and the Colville River corridor, both home to an astounding variety
of wildlife, while holding the rest in reserve for the day when the
country really needs it.

EDITORIAL: NEW DANGER TO CAMPAIGN REFORM 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   The New York Times said in an editorial for Wednesday, Aug. 5:
</P>
<P>
   Only a day after campaign finance reform won approval in the
House on Monday, Newt Gingrich opened a threatening new
counterattack. The speaker's latest strategy is to sideline the
Shays-Meehan bill to overhaul the election fund-raising system by
getting Republicans to support another bill disguised as reform but
actually aimed at maintaining the corrupt status quo.
</P>
<P>
   If this sham legislation passes with more than the 237 votes won
by Shays-Meehan, it would become the final bill approved by the
House. We urge lawmakers not to be fooled by Gingrich's tactics and
to reject his phony substitute.
</P>
<P>
   The bill posing this threat is sponsored by a bipartisan group
of freshmen led by Tom Allen of Maine, a Democrat, and Asa
Hutchinson of Arkansas, a Republican. They had maintained that
their legislation had a better chance of passing than the
Shays-Meehan bill.
</P>
<P>
   But that argument, always dubious, is completely invalid now
that Shays-Meehan has passed convincingly. The tipoff is that
Gingrich and his whip, Tom DeLay, were working hard yesterday to
win support for the freshman bill, knowing it would gut real
reform.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill would ban unlimited ``soft money''
contributions to political parties by corporations, unions and rich
donors. The freshman bill would ban it for national parties but
allow it for state parties. Far from ending the corruption of
special-interest money, the freshman bill would merely rechannel
it.
</P>
<P>
   Unlike Shays-Meehan, the freshman bill would allow unlimited
fund-raising for campaign attack ads sponsored by single-issue
groups. Even the disclosure provisions of the freshman bill are
weaker than those of Shays-Meehan.
</P>
<P>
   In recent weeks, we have repeatedly urged moderate Republicans
to break from Gingrich and support campaign reform. We now repeat
that appeal and add a message to those Democrats who supported the
Shays-Meehan bill but now say they will vote for the freshman
substitute. They must all realize that support for the freshman
alternative undoes all the good they have accomplished. Supporting
the freshman bill simply plays into the hands of DeLay and other
rabid foes of reform.
</P>
<P>
   Richard Gephardt and other Democratic leaders have so far kept
their members lined up for reform. They must not ease up in keeping
the coalition together. In the New York region, we urge Carolyn
McCarthy of Long Island, Bill Pascrell of New Jersey and Jim
Maloney of Connecticut, all sponsors of the freshman bill, to
reject it now that the better bill can survive. Advancing a
fraudulent alternative would betray the public's desire to end
corruption in the political system.

BIG EAST TRYING TO REGAIN COMPOSURE
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By ED GUZMAN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J. _ For Michael Tranghese, being
commissioner of the Big East Conference has been a test of
endurance:
</P>
<P>
   _ Enduring criticism of having half the football teams in the
conference finish with losing records as the other half gets
outscored, 153-58, in post-season bowl appearances.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enduring rumors of possibly getting raided by other
conferences seeking to expand.
</P>
<P>
   _ Enduring the notion that Notre Dame, a member of the Big East
in every other sport, still refuses to join the eight-team football
conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It would help if some of the outside talk subsided,''
Tranghese said Tuesday at the annual Big East Conference media day
at Giants Stadium. ``People correlate your struggles on the field
with your existence. I think we've become an easy target because of
our hybrid nature and because, of the six major conferences, we're
the one that doesn't have everyone doing the same thing. But I
think a couple of wins on the field would go a long way toward
toning down some of the extremism.''
</P>
<P>
   With the Big Ten Conference thinking about expanding to include
Notre Dame, Tranghese put to rest speculation that Syracuse might
also jump ship.
</P>
<P>
   Tranghese said that Syracuse Chancellor Kenneth Shaw had
publicly acknowledged that his school had not been approached by
the Big Ten.
</P>
<P>
   ``They like the Big East, and they're one of the founding
fathers,'' Tranghese said. ``As long as we can remain healthy and
viable, I don't see why they want to go somewhere else.''
</P>
<P>
   But how healthy and viable is the Big East Conference in its
football operations? Last season, Temple finished 3-8 and Rutgers
staggered to 0-11.
</P>
<P>
   Tranghese, however, believes that the Big East can continue to
function successfully with those teams struggling, especially if
teams such as Miami can return to its former prominence.
</P>
<P>
   ``If Miami is back as a perennial top 10 or top 15 team every
year, then a lot of what is perceived to be our problems are going
to go away,'' Tranghese said. ``I think some of our major market
teams have really struggled, like Pitt, Boston College and Rutgers.
But at the top of the list is Miami getting back somewhat to where
they were. That would help us more than anything.''
</P>
<P>
   Miami Coach Butch Davis, whose team finished 5-6 last season,
feels ready to live up to that potential.
</P>
<P>
   Entering his fourth season at the helm, Davis appears relieved
to have gone through his first incident-free off season.
</P>
<P>
   ``It seemed like all you did was defend the program and defend
the issues,'' Davis said of the past three off seasons. ``You were
spending so much time talking to the media, addressing things,
flying to Kansas City to meet with the NCAA. You spent so much time
dealing with the distractions that you didn't get to spend as much
time with the players.''
</P>
<P>
   The Big East Conference will get a glimpse of how far it has
come on Sept. 5, when Boston College travels to Georgia Tech,
Syracuse plays host to Tennessee and West Virginia welcomes Ohio
State. Many of the players view it as a great opportunity to earn
the Big East Conference some respect.
</P>
<P>
   ``We want to do it for the conference,'' said John Thornton, a
West Virginia senior defensive end, of the game against Ohio State.
``The conference took a beating last year because we lost all of
our bowl games. This year, we'll be back on top.'' &QL;

LAWYER WINS THE BATTLE OF HIS CLIENT'S LIFE 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By DAVID FIRESTONE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   In another time and another courthouse, the conviction of a
defendant on four counts of first-degree murder, and the sentencing
of that defendant to life in prison without parole, would be
considered something of a loss for a defense lawyer.
</P>
<P>
   But for William Tendy Jr., last month's jury verdict of life
came as an enormous emotional relief, the lifting of a moral weight
that had burdened and nearly broken him in the two years since he
took on the case of Dalkeith McIntosh.
</P>
<P>
   Conventional wisdom in Poughkeepsie, N.Y., had it that McIntosh,
a 38-year-old black Jamaican immigrant, would be sentenced to death
in the state's second capital murder trial since the death penalty
was revived in 1995. McIntosh's life, however, was spared by an
all-white jury in conservative, prosperous Dutchess County, a
decision that contrasted sharply with a death sentence imposed on a
former jail guard by a Brooklyn jury in June. Most of those who
watched the trial say that Tendy was the main obstacle between
McIntosh and a lethal injection.
</P>
<P>
   ``A lot of people here were surprised at the verdict, but not
those of us who know Bill,'' said Jeffrey Martin, a Rhinebeck,
N.Y., lawyer. ``To have defended a person like that takes enormous
skills, which few people in this area possess. But Bill isn't a
typical lawyer _ he basically transforms himself into the person
he's representing. He's one of the best attorneys we've ever had
around here.''
</P>
<P>
   Tendy, 44, a former prosecutor in the Manhattan district
attorney's office, is the son of the longtime No. 2 man in the U.S.
attorney's office in New York, a much-admired figure in the legal
community who died in 1986. Since leaving the city in 1984, Tendy
has successfully defended several high-profile murder suspects in
the Hudson Valley, including Iris Pyne, who was acquitted last year
of murdering her husband on grounds of self-defense.
</P>
<P>
   But for most of the past two years, Tendy essentially jettisoned
all other cases and most of his personal life _ he has custody of
his two young children _to keep McIntosh from death row. The task
was made harder by the revulsion expressed throughout Dutchess
County at the crime, which occurred in August 1996. McIntosh was
accused of murdering his estranged wife and her 23-year-old
daughter, and of shooting in the mouth a 6-year-old boy, left for
dead, who lived to become the chief witness against him.
</P>
<P>
   Tendy, like almost every other lawyer in the state, had no
experience with capital murder cases, but several years earlier had
attended a seminar led by the state's new Capital Defenders Office
to prepare defense lawyers for such cases. Though he said he had no
strong feelings about the death penalty, he was asked by the office
to take on the McIntosh case because of his strong reputation as a
defense lawyer, and he accepted it for reasons he now realizes were
not fully formed.
</P>
<P>
   ``What attracted me was that this was such new ground and I
wanted to be involved in it,'' he said a few days ago, sitting in
his law office in a quiet building across from the Poughkeepsie
Galleria. ``I had an opportunity to help shape an area of the law
that was untouched. But after I got it, I realized how much more
complicated it all was.''
</P>
<P>
   Because the death penalty law is so new and has never had a
formal challenge, Tendy had to file a lengthy series of motions to
lay the groundwork for a later appeal on constitutional grounds had
his client received the maximum sentence. Nearly 5,000 county
residents had to fill out 45 pages of questions about execution,
and the entire jury selection process took months. And then there
were the facts of the case, which Tendy is still amazed did not
lead to an acquittal. There was no physical evidence connecting
McIntosh to the murders; the principal testimony against him came
from the boy.
</P>
<P>
   With only a few days to prepare for the sentencing phase, Tendy
brought in McIntosh's siblings to testify that he had been abused
as a child, and reminded the jury that his client was just a few IQ
points above that of someone who is mentally retarded. In a
religiously flavored hourlong summation, he urged them to choose
life, citing Jesus as ``the most famous victim of capital
punishment'' and one who would have urged mercy.
</P>
<P>
   ``After he lost in the guilt phase, he met the jury on their own
moral ground in the penalty phase,'' said Kevin Doyle, the state's
chief capital defender. ``He didn't start spouting elitist secular
arguments against the death penalty. He drew on their own values,
which he happened to share, on the appropriateness of mercy in this
case.''
</P>
<P>
   Tendy, who grew up in Flushing, Queens, originally moved upstate
_ to the jeers of his friends _ for a less hectic life. For more
than a year, with the assistance of a team from the Capital
Defenders Office, he spent seven days and nights every week on the
case, juggling baby-sitters and asking neighbors to help with
family duties. After becoming more emotionally invested in the case
than he ever expected, he is now hoping to have that life back,
with no plans to accept another capital case.
</P>
<P>
   ``It consumed my entire life,'' he said. ``You can never get it
out of your head that if you don't do the right job, a person could
lose their life. They could be executed. It's the most difficult
thing I've ever done, by far.''

METS SIGN FRANCO TO A TWO-YEAR EXTENSION 
</HEADLINE>
  (nk) 
 By STEVE POPPER   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ The Mets have made it a matter of policy not to
negotiate contracts during the season. But it was a matter of
common sense that pushed General Manager Steve Phillips to give
John Franco a two-year contract extension, a deal the team
announced Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The timing that brought Franco and Phillips to the podium at
Shea Stadium to announce the extension, believed to be worth $3
million a year, with incentives that could push it higher, came
less than 24 hours after other members of the Mets' bullpen had
self-destructed, wasting another strong effort by a starting
pitcher. The loss on Monday night to the Dodgers marked another in
a long line of bullpen failures that have sometimes included
Franco, but far more frequently have featured the likes of Greg
McMichael and Mel Rojas.
</P>
<P>
   So with Franco, the team's closer since 1990, set to become a
free agent at the conclusion of this season, it only made sense for
the Mets to assure themselves of re-signing him before his price
tag rose on the open market. And for the Brooklyn-born Franco, it
made sense, too, with his openly expressed desire to remain in his
hometown.
</P>
<P>
   ``I was born and raised here,'' said Franco, who is 37 years old
and lives in Staten Island. ``My family is here. Both of my
children are in school. I don't have to uproot my kids or be a
weekend dad. I think it makes everybody relaxed now, my wife and my
kids and myself. To be part of something where I grew up as a Mets
fan and I've been here nine years, the only thing missing is to be
a part of a championship organization.''
</P>
<P>
   Franco has struggled at times this season, entering Tuesday
night's game against San Francisco with an 0-6 record with 5 blown
saves in 26 attempts and a 4.35 ERA. But the scarcity of relief
help, both on the Mets' current roster and around the league, made
him too valuable to risk losing.
</P>
<P>
   ``We feel that it was appropriate to get John's situation
resolved first and then I think it sends messages to the other guys
that we are serious about keeping our free-agent players who have
done the job for us beyond this year,'' Phillips said. ``I hope
that as we broach those discussions with other players we'll be
able to move forward and get those deals done also.''
</P>
<P>
   With catcher Mike Piazza and Tuesday night's starter, Al Leiter,
also eligible to become free agents, Franco may not be the most
desirable player to possibly test the free-agent waters. But the
Mets have Todd Hundley if Piazza opts to leave and they have a
surplus of starting pitching. The lack of bullpen talent, though,
has been painfully obvious this year, making a closer of Franco's
level too valuable to let slip away.
</P>
<P>
   ``In our view John is unique in that it's not easy to find
closers to bounce back after a rough outing, particularly in New
York,'' Phillips said. ``It takes a certain type of individual and
certainly John has proven he's very capable of that.''
</P>
<P>
   Added Phillips: ``We decided that rather than take our chances
waiting until the end of the season in an open market, that we'd at
least explore it now.''
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   It doesn't hurt Franco's bargaining position that his agent, Dan
Horwits, is partners with the agent for Piazza, helping to
establish a bit of good will. But it was clearly Franco's value to
the organization, both on and off the field, that prompted Phillips
to move to get the deal done now.
</P>
<P>
   ``Steve came up to me and said he'd like to talk to my
representatives about getting something going and I said, `Fine,'''
Franco said. ``I made a promise to Steve in spring training that he
wouldn't hear a word out of me the whole year about wanting a
contract extension until the end of the season. So it kind of
caught me a little off guard.''
</P>
<P>
   Phillips was pleased, though.
</P>
<P>
   ``We know what we have in John, that he wants to play in New
York, that he wants the ball. He's proven it 380 times already.''

<P>
   Beverly Enterprises, the nation's largest nursing home operator,
Tuesday withdrew its defamation lawsuit against Kate
Bronfenbrenner, a Cornell University professor of labor relations.
The company had accused Ms. Bronfenbrenner of slandering it last
February when she called it a notorious labor law violator at a
meeting in Pittsburgh organized by members of Congress.
</P>
<P>
   In May, a federal judge dismissed the suit, concluding that Ms.
Bronfenbrenner's speech was protected because it came at a
legislative hearing. Beverly Enterprises appealed, but on Tuesday
it dropped the suit, asserting that Ms. Bronfenbrenner had
acknowledged that her research did not back up her criticisms.
</P>
<P>
   But she denied having made such an admission and called
Beverly's assertion disingenuous. Hundreds of professors around the
country criticized the lawsuit, saying it chilled free speech and
academic freedom.

LOS ANGELES CITY COUNCIL JOINS FIGHT AGAINST VOTER-APPROVED PROP.
227
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
(Will also move in the ``n'' state news file.)

<TEXT>
<P>
   Despite widespread voter approval, the Los Angeles City Council
voted Tuesday to join legal efforts to overturn Proposition 227,
the measure that all but banned bilingual education in California.
</P>
<P>
   The 11-3 vote came after a lengthy debate over whether council
members should disregard the will of the voters. Proposition 227
passed June 2 with better than 60 percent of the vote statewide and
51.8 percent support in Los Angeles.
</P>
<P>
   Four council members _ Laura Chick, John Ferraro, Mike Feuer and
Ruth Galanter _ voted to fight Proposition 227 although the
majority of voters in their own districts supported the measure's
requirement that California students be taught in English.
</P>
<P>
   Chick's west San Fernando Valley district passed the bilingual
ban by a 2-1 margin of 10,454 votes, while Feuer's Sherman
Oaks-Westside district went 4-3 for the ban, a 5,084 margin. It was
closer in Ferraro's North Hollywood-Los Feliz district and in
Galanter's Venice-Westchester district.
</P>
<P>
   ``I become concerned when a measure such as this, or Proposition
187 and 209, appear directed at a single group,'' Chick said.
``That's not something we can afford at this time.
</P>
<P>
   ``I recognize that my district voted strongly in favor of this
and I try to serve my district. But this is something that I
believe strongly in and we cannot afford further division in this
city.''
</P>
<P>
   Feuer said his personal views compelled him to disregard his
constituents.
</P>
<P>
   ``Some issues go beyond us deciding to not challenge what the
voters have approved. The issues at stake are compelling. It seems
to me we should join this lawsuit because it involves access to a
quality education,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   The only votes against the city joining the suit came from
council members Joel Wachs, Hal Bernson and Cindy Miscikowski, all
of whom represent San Fernando Valley districts.
</P>
<P>
   City officials downplayed the cost and significance of the City
Council's action since several civil rights and Latino groups
already have filed suit and the Los Angeles Unified School District
decided to implement Proposition 227 after a federal court ruled it
was constitutional.
</P>
<P>
   Councilman Richard Alatorre introduced the motion for the city,
which has no jurisdiction over the schools, to join the lawsuit as
a friend of the court, saying council members may be better
informed on the issue than voters were.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm not saying people were ignorant when they voted for
Proposition 227. I just don't think they had all the information on
how important this program is,'' Alatorre said.
</P>
<P>
   Councilwoman Jackie Goldberg said the issue goes beyond what the
majority of voters believes.
</P>
<P>
   ``There are some things that rise to a level of human rights in
a society like ours. And the right to a free, appropriate education
is right up there with basic human rights.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is a law that says students are not going to be given an
equal opportunity to get an education. We all want our children to
speak English, but we want them to learn as well.''
</P>
<P>
   Wachs and Miscikowski argued the city had no reason to get
involved in the legal action since there already is a lawsuit
pending.
</P>
<P>
   Bernson, who said he favored Proposition 227, criticized his
colleagues for casting English immersion supporters in a bad light.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those of us who supported 227 did not have ulterior motives,''
he said. ``We felt we were doing what was best for the kids. People
who supported this felt many children are being cheated by not
being taught in the language of the land.
</P>
<P>
   ``This is not directed just at those who speak Spanish. There
are other languages in this city. The future for all of them is to
speak English.''
</P>
<P>
   Proposition 227, which ends most bilingual education programs in
the state, took effect in the LAUSD on Monday at 50 year-round
schools. About 10,000 students with limited English proficiency
began semesters in sheltered English immersion programs. District
officials say the effort is going smoothly.
</P>
<P>
   To comply with the council's will, city attorneys will review
the legal arguments filed in the case, said Chief Assistant City
Attorney Pete Echeverria.
</P>
<P>
   ``If we have to, we'll prepare our own brief, but more likely we
will look at the other briefs already filed and say the city agrees
with that argument,'' Echeverria said.
</P>
<P>
   Sherri Annis of English for the Children questioned the
council's action since the LAUSD recently went to court, saying it
was ready to implement the program.
</P>
<P>
   ``They seem to disagree with the LAUSD and its lawyers,'' Annis
said. ``Also, this is just another attempt to halt the
implementation of a law that was long overdue and very popular in
California and Los Angeles.''
</P>
<P>
   Deputy City Attorney Frank Orozco said the main arguments filed
against the measure involve potential violations of the Civil
Rights Act and the Equal Education Opportunity Act.
</P>
<P>
   Several suits are challenging the law, the main one filed by the
Mexican-American Legal Defense and Education Fund, the American
Civil Liberties Union, the California Latino Civil Rights
Association, the National Council of La Raza, and the Southern
Christian Leadership Council.

UNION SETS STRIKE DEADLINE FOR BELL ATLANTIC WORKERS 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By STEVEN GREENHOUSE   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ Unions representing 85,000 workers at Bell Atlantic
have set a strike deadline for 12:01 a.m. Sunday, threatening a job
action that could inconvenience millions of consumers from Maine to
Virginia by creating delays in telephone repairs and in reaching
directory assistance.
</P>
<P>
   Leaders of the Communications Workers of America and the
International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers said Tuesday that
sizable differences remained on several issues, including Bell
Atlantic's increasing use of nonunion subsidiaries and its
requiring many employees to work extensive overtime.
</P>
<P>
   With the communication workers' board giving a go-ahead Monday
for a strike, its officials warned that there was a good chance of
a strike.
</P>
<P>
   ``As time goes on, it seems more and more certain there'll be a
strike,'' said Paul Sapienza, executive vice president of
Communications Workers Local 1705, which represents 6,000 phone
workers on Long Island and in New York City and Westchester County.
``It means that there will be no repairs, no installations, no
questions answered on your bills, no disputing charges, no
directory assistance, basically nothing, with the exception of what
managerial employees can provide.''
</P>
<P>
   But Bell Atlantic officials sounded more optimistic.
``Negotiations are continuing,'' said Steven Marcus, a company
spokesman. ``Bell Atlantic, the communications workers and the
electrical workers are working hard to reach an agreement before
the current contracts expire, and we have faith in the
collective-bargaining process.''
</P>
<P>
   One union official said the two sides were not far apart on
wages. Nonetheless, the unions, in their effort to win public
backing and shore up support among workers, have repeatedly said
Bell Atlantic should be able to provide an improved contract
because it is enjoying record profits and its stock price has
nearly doubled in three years.
</P>
<P>
   The talks, being held in New York and Virginia, are complicated
by the recent merger of Nynex and Bell Atlantic and by the fact
that workers for those two regional telephone companies had
different pay scales and work rules.
</P>
<P>
   The union asserts that Bell Atlantic went too far in cutbacks
several years ago and that as a result, far too many repair
workers, service representatives and operators are being forced to
work overtime to get all the work done. Union officials said many
employees must work 25 hours of overtime each week, adding that one
repairman in Richmond was threatened with discipline for refusing
to work on a Saturday after having worked 20 consecutive days.
</P>
<P>
   In another area of contention, the unions are demanding limits
on Bell Atlantic's growing use of subcontractors, temporary
employees and nonunion workers. The union criticized the company
for setting up a nonunion call center in Norfolk, Va., where there
are hundreds of business representatives, many of whom are hired
from temporary agencies. They receive less than $350 a week and few
benefits while unionized business representatives receive more than
twice that each week with extensive benefits.
</P>
<P>
   Union officials say much of the company's recent expansion has
been in those nonunion areas, a move that union leaders say
threatens the job security of unionized workers.
</P>
<P>
   ``We insist that the workers who have built Bell Atlantic's
extraordinary success have an opportunity to share in its growth,''
said Morton Bahr, president of the CWA. ``Bell Atlantic and other
highly profitable companies in the booming communications field
should be setting the standard for good American jobs, not adding
to the growth of a contingent work force earning low pay and no
benefits.''
</P>
<P>
   Bell Atlantic officials declined to discuss any issues under
negotiation. ``Those are all issues that we are discussing at the
bargaining table,'' Marcus, the company spokesman, said. ``That is
the appropriate place to continue discussions.''
</P>
<P>
   Other issues that the negotiators are seeking to thrash out
include pensions and the union's demands for more flexible
scheduling and for higher pay for working Sundays.
</P>
<P>
   In disputes involving many of the same issues, workers at two
other regional telephone companies have authorized strikes. About
48,000 members of the communications workers at BellSouth, which
provides service in nine states in the Southeast, have threatened
to strike when their contract expires at 12:01 a.m. this Sunday.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, 36,000 workers who work for U S West, which serves
14 Western states, have authorized a strike when the contract
expires at 12:01 a.m. Aug. 16.

   Rudy T flourishes &QL; 
going against odds
</P>
<P>
   &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
ATHENS, Greece _ You can see the light in his eyes flick on each
time one of the unfamiliar faces with the strange accents asks him
about the absence of the NBA Dream Team.
</P>
<P>
   You can hear it in his voice whenever it is suggested his merry
little band of castoffs and retreads might be adrift in the Aegean
Sea in water over its head.
</P>
<P>
   This is the World Championship of Basketball and not the NBA
playoffs, and the hurdles might come from Yugoslavia or Greece or
Italy, not Utah, Phoenix and Seattle.
</P>
<P>
   But the challenge, the task and the situation feel like the same
old hair shirt, and Rudy Tomjanovich slips into it as comfortably
as a silk smoking jacket.
</P>
<P>
   ``I've been here before,'' he said. ``Do-or-die. You know, it
tears away at your insides, and it can drive you crazy mentally. It
can keep you up at night, and it can nag at you all day long.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm like anybody else out there walking around. I don't like
the doubts. But at the same time, I understand it and it drives me.
Truth is, I love it.''
</P>
<P>
   If the folks running the show at USA Basketball wanted somebody
who could make the most out of what he has, then Rudy T is right on
track.
</P>
<P>
   Thanks to their finest performance of the tournament in a 96-78
thumping of Australia on Tuesday, the American Dreamers came out of
the second round of play with a 5-1 record, as the No. 1 seed in
their group, and head into the medal round as a team that must be
at least respected, if not feared.
</P>
<P>
   U.S. team rounds into form
</P>
<P>
   This was the game the way Tomjanovich has tried to get them to
play it _ aggressive from the start, marked by in-your-face
defense, an ability to get the ball out running and convert in the
transition game, and moving it around on offense to find the open
man.
</P>
<P>
   It was an unselfish display, yet one brimming with individual
confidence. Jimmy Oliver continued to stroke the ball well from the
outside, going 3-for-3 on treys to finish with 18 points. Jason
Sasser stopped trying to do everything himself and forcing the
action, and the result was an easier and more productive game that
turned into 15 points.
</P>
<P>
   Backup center Brad Miller ignited the best U.S. sequence of the
tournament, running down Andrew Gaze from behind to deliver a
crushing block on a fast-break layup and starting a break the other
way that wound up with a Kiwane Garris bucket.
</P>
<P>
   ``Somebody always was out there making a play, on offense or on
defense or on the boards, whenever we needed one,'' Tomjanovich
said. ``What they have learned is to take the game plan that we
give them and just follow the instructions.''
</P>
<P>
   Imagine that. A week into this tournament, and the Dreamers have
discovered this Rudy T fella doesn't have simply blind faith in
their ability to get the job done but a strategy to help them do
it.
</P>
<P>
   ``That's the fun part of all this for me,'' Tomjanovich said.
``Seeing these guys learn and watching them make progress.
Especially when they have to practically do it on the run. I mean,
this tournament goes by so fast.''
</P>
<P>
   On to the quarterfinals
</P>
<P>
   Six games in seven days, and suddenly it seems like a month ago
that the United States was taken to school in the first round by
Lithuania. That two-point loss was the low ebb, and in the four
games since the toddlers have gone from wobbly legs to at least
giving the appearance of being able to run with anybody.
</P>
<P>
   Next up in the quarterfinals Friday is Italy, a team the United
States beat in an exhibition game in Rome 80-75 on July 25. The
Italians, the No. 4 seeds in the opposite bracket, have been up and
down here but demonstrated their ability to rise by edging the
favored Yugoslavians two nights ago. Every team in the field has
lost at least once.
</P>
<P>
   It is down to a single-elimination affair. Lose, and you're out
of gold-medal contention. It will take three wins in three nights
to grab the gold, and maybe that would get them some attention back
at home.
</P>
<P>
   ``It does feel like we're playing this thing in a vacuum,''
Tomjanovich said. ``I'm hearing very, very little from home. No
calls. No messages. It's like nobody wants to admit we're here.''
</P>
<P>
   Maybe because nobody in America expected them to do anything
and, after the Dream Team experiences in Barcelona and Atlanta, did
not want to be associated with anything that could fail.
</P>
<P>
   It is an uphill climb, but they can at least glimpse the summit.
</P>
<P>
   ``Would anybody call us the favorites now?'' Rudy T said.
``Probably not. But do I think we can win three in a row when
nobody else believes in us? Hell, yes. I've done it before.''
</P>
<P>
   So they dream on.

FRESHMEN QBS TO GET LOOK

   LOS ANGELES _ Carson Palmer or Jason Thomas at quarterback for
USC?
</P>
<P>
   It's a tantalizing prospect, and it didn't lose any momentum
Tuesday, when USC football coach Paul Hackett said he intends to
use training camp to give his highly touted freshmen a chance to
bid for playing time or perhaps even win the starting position.
</P>
<P>
   Although sophomore Mike Van Raaphorst was named the starting
quarterback during spring practice, Hackett said Palmer and Thomas
_ both prep All-Americans _ would be given every opportunity this
month to showcase their talent.
</P>
<P>
   ``The young guys have to get a shot,'' Hackett said. ``Whether
or not they will play immediately, I don't know.''
</P>
<P>
   The comments are interesting, because juniors John Fox and
Quincy Woods were considered the second- and third-string
quarterbacks. Fox started nine games last season.
</P>
<P>
   ``They had their opportunity in the spring,'' Hackett said. ``At
least heading into camp, it's for the young guys to show what they
can do. The quarterback position is a very interesting problem.''
</P>
<P>
   Hackett did not rule out that Fox and Woods would see action
this season, but he has already promised Palmer and Thomas they
would at least be given a chance before the season.
</P>
<P>
   The quarterback battle will be one of the highlights of training
camp, as the Trojans prepare for their Aug. 30 opener against
Purdue at the Coliseum.
</P>
<P>
   ``We are all sorta becoming more tense now because we are
getting closer,'' Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett acknowledged for the first time publicly Tuesday that
wide receiver R. Jay Soward has been suspended from the
season-opener against Purdue, which was originally reported in
April by the Daily News.
</P>
<P>
   Soward had to drop a class in the spring that he was in danger
of failing and also was not regularly attending classes. However,
Soward rebounded with a strong academic performance in the summer
and has also supposedly undergone an attitude change under the
strict regimen instituted by Hackett.
</P>
<P>
   ``His response to his suspension was sensational,'' Hackett
said.
</P>
<P>
   There is no chance Soward will be reinstated for the Purdue
game, though, Hackett said.
</P>
<P>
   ``I have to make it clear that I mean what I say,'' Hackett
said. ``It's only one game because of how sensational he
responded.''
</P>
<P>
   Already without Soward, USC will also be without a top recruit,
wide receiver Windrell Hayes, unless Hayes can plea bargain three
felony counts for writing bad checks down to a single misdemeanor
charge in the near future.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes, who is not in camp, has turned down one offer by the Lodi
district attorney to reduce the charges, because he would be liable
for $15,000 in damages. According to sources, Hayes is trying to
reduce the damages to under $10,000. He would probably have to
obtain a loan to pay off the damages.
</P>
<P>
   Hackett said he believed Hayes might be able to reach an
agreement with the district attorney in the next 10 days.
</P>
<P>
   Notes: USC has added Chad Pierson, a 6-foot-2, 220-pound
fullback from Oxnard High. Pierson was recruited by many Pac-10
schools last year but only recently passed his Scholastic
Assessment Test. He will be on scholarship.... USC's freshmen
report today, but no workouts are planned until Thursday, and those
are expected to be light. The rest of the team reports Saturday.

<TEXT>
<P>
   Suddenly the beleaguered Kenneth Starr, perhaps the most
detested man in Washington, doesn't seem so beleaguered.
</P>
<P>
   Over the past two weeks the independent counsel has scored a
series of legal victories, and put Bill Clinton and the White House
back on the defensive.
</P>
<P>
   First the courts gave Starr permission to question Secret
Service agents about the president, rejecting the claim that this
would significantly compromise the agents' ability to protect their
boss.
</P>
<P>
   Then he won the right to put questions to Clinton's lawyer,
Bruce Lindsey, overturning the argument that the president's
conversations with Lindsey (who is paid by taxpayers) are protected
by attorney-client privilege.
</P>
<P>
   Most recently, and dramatically, he at last secured an agreement
with Monica Lewinsky: reportedly, she will tell the truth about her
relationship with the president in return for immunity from
prosecution over any lies she has told about it hitherto.
</P>
<P>
   Exactly what Lewinsky has agreed to say is a matter of dispute.
All of the unnamed sources briefing the press midweek were
convinced she would admit to a sexual relationship with the
president, which both of them have previously denied in sworn
statements.
</P>
<P>
   Some of the sources said that she would also make a more
damaging allegation: that the president and others told her to lie.
This would add suborning perjury and obstruction of justice to mere
lying under oath. Others said she would deny this had happened.
</P>
<P>
   Plainly, a lot will turn on which of these accounts is correct.
But, whatever happens next, Clinton's strategy of delay and
non-cooperation with Starr's inquiry seems to be going wrong.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel has not faded away or been hounded out
of town quite yet, though for a while it seemed he might be. He is
still there, and his questions still pose a potentially lethal
threat to Clinton's presidency.
</P>
<P>
   Is that, as most people in Washington appear to think, a
deplorable state of affairs? Received opinion has it that the
charges against Clinton are trivial. Let's say he had an affair
with Monica Lewinsky: so what? Let's say he lied about it: big
deal.
</P>
<P>
   Do mere improprieties such as this, it is asked, justify Kenneth
Starr's remarkable project _ a four-year inquiry involving dozens
of lawyers and costing more than $40 million, which has mired the
president and his aides in endless legal process, sapping their
energy and distracting their attention from matters such as running
the country?
</P>
<P>
   It all seems outrageously disproportionate. The opinion polls
sum it up: the president is hugely popular, and Starr is loathed.
Many conclude that a halt should have been called long ago to the
whole preposterous enterprise.
</P>
<P>
   This is wrong. Suppose the only charge Starr can sustain against
Clinton is that he had an affair with Lewinsky and lied about it,
first under oath (when questioned by lawyers for Paula Jones), and
later when addressing the American public on television.
</P>
<P>
   Agreed, it would be amazing if the president were impeached in
this event _ not because of what the law on impeachable acts says
(the rules are vague) but because the public mood would not stand
for it.
</P>
<P>
   Only Congress, ever mindful of public opinion, can impeach a
president. Clinton would have to bungle things badly to turn people
against him if this is all Starr can produce.
</P>
<P>
   All that's needed is a brave recanting, a fulsome apology and
judicious mitigation _ he lied to protect Monica, sweet girl; it's
been a strain, but his marriage is stronger for it; if Hillary can
forgive (bite lip), why can't America? No problem.
</P>
<P>
   In our view, that would be a pity. Public opinion is too
tolerant if it regards with equanimity a president whose friends
are obliged to draw careful distinctions between different kinds of
perjury (as in, perjury in an unsuccessful civil case is all
right).
</P>
<P>
   Having said that, to have exposed Clinton as no worse than a
recklessly immoral man _ something that was pretty well understood
in any case _ would indeed be a meager return on Starr's
expenditure of resources.
</P>
<P>
   But in this event don't just blame Starr for the cost, the delay
and the distraction from bigger things: blame the White House.
</P>
<P>
   The independent counsel is not a free agent; his actions are
regulated by the courts and open to legal challenge. Clinton and
his team have used this fact at every opportunity to delay the
inquiry, hoping that people would grow bored (as they have, up
until this week) or simply that the presidency would come to an end
before Starr did.
</P>
<P>
   Instead of being open from the start, the White House has
objected and obstructed at every stage, deliberately dragging
things out. That is one reason why the saga has gone on so long.
</P>
<P>
   The other reason, as the fuss over Lewinsky can lead one to
forget, is that Starr's inquiry has been wide-ranging, and rightly
so. He was first appointed to take over an ongoing investigation
into the Whitewater scandal and related matters.
</P>
<P>
   Received opinion emphasizes that Starr's best efforts have
failed to tie the Clintons to any Whitewater crimes _ so far,
anyway. But nobody could argue that there was no case to
investigate. Crimes were committed; friends of the Clintons have
gone to jail; Whitewater was not just Starr's fantasy.
</P>
<P>
   When Starr presents his report on all this to Congress, minds
may change. If he establishes a pattern of corruption and
dishonesty encompassing Whitewater, Lewinsky and points between,
the charge that he has crippled a fine president with a mischievous
investigation will be refuted _ and Clinton will be in the deepest
kind of trouble.
</P>
<P>
   If, on the other hand, Starr fails to tie the threads of his
inquiry together, and has nothing to show for his investigation but
petty embarrassment for the president, expect a backlash.
</P>
<P>
   Laws will be proposed to extend and entrench executive
privilege. The powers of the independent counsel will be narrowed,
if the office survives at all. Clinton's embarrassment will be spun
into glorious triumph over narrow zealots and right-wing
conspirators, terrible thought.
</P>
<P>
   The stakes are that high, and the game is not over yet. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every Sunday a group of boys from Compton, one of
the bleakest bits of South-Central Los Angeles, team up with a
handful of Irish expatriates to learn the ancient Irish sport of
hurling.
</P>
<P>
   Hurling, a frenetic mixture of lacrosse and hockey, is a hard
game to master if you insist on wearing the ludicrously baggy
clothes of street gangs. Yet the boys seem quite fearless. Hurling
holds few terrors if you grow up in the drive-by shooting capital
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, they have learned excellent ball skills from
playing the other game that fills their leisure time: cricket.
</P>
<P>
   The man responsible for this is Ted Hayes, a lanky black with
flowing dreadlocks and a greying beard. Hayes is Los Angeles's
leading campaigner for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   For years he himself lived, voluntarily, on the streets. Then he
built a village of igloo-shaped huts in the shadow of a freeway,
where the homeless can find shelter, give up drugs, and learn
everything from algebra to computer skills.
</P>
<P>
   He is also the city's leading campaigner for the spread of
cricket.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes was introduced to cricket four years ago, when a group of
British expatriates asked him to play. He liked the game so much
that he formed a team of his own consisting of homeless men and
Compton street kids.
</P>
<P>
   His team proved so successful that he led it on a cricket tour
of Britain. This is how hurling came in. Two chance meetings _ one
with Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the second with Mo
Mowlam, Britain's secretary of state for Northern Ireland _
persuaded Hayes that he should include Northern Ireland in his next
tour.
</P>
<P>
   But as he read his Irish history he concluded that cricket had
somewhat divisive connotations in the province. So he added hurling
to his team's repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hayes wants to turn Compton's baseball stadium into
America's first professional cricket ground, giving international
teams a pitch in the heart of South-Central Los Angeles. And he
plans to create America's first museum of cricket and hurling. But
all this activity is driven by his passion for ending homelessness.
</P>
<P>
   Sitting in his silver dome under the freeway, a poster of Martin
Luther King above his desk and pictures of Queen Elizabeth and the
Queen Mother above his bed, Hayes expostulates on the evils of
America's welfare system.
</P>
<P>
   Welfare handouts have reduced the poor to dependence, and
affirmative action has robbed the black community of its best
brains. Many Democrats have no wish to change any of this because
social problems are such useful weapons against the Republicans;
many civil-rights enthusiasts have no wish to change it because
their livelihood depends on the idea that blacks are helpless
victims.
</P>
<P>
   The welfare state, he argues, robs the poor of their
self-respect by teaching them that they have neither choices nor
responsibilities. Restoring a sense of self-respect is at the heart
of Hayes's campaign.
</P>
<P>
   He reckons sport is a powerful aid in preventing potential gang
members ending up in prison or on the streets, not least because it
introduces them to people who have managed to live beyond the age
of 20. But he thinks that American sports have been too
contaminated by bigheartedness and commercialism.
</P>
<P>
   Cricket, on the other hand, is all about good manners and team
spirit, a point that he underlines by habitually addressing his
fellow team members as ``gentlemen.''
</P>
<P>
   One shaven-headed gentleman admits that he was in a gang called
the Killer Society before he discovered cricket and hurling;
another shyly confesses that his ambition is to become ``the W.G.
Grace of the 21st century.''
</P>
<P>
   These sporting activities, Hayes insists, could be a valuable
source of income for his various projects. (``You need capitalist
solutions to fight capitalist problems.'')
</P>
<P>
   The Disney company is making a film about his cricket team, and
Hayes himself is shooting a video, in which break-dancers perform
in cricket gear, to promote his son's rap record about the sport.
</P>
<P>
   But even more important than the money is the publicity. Hayes
has drawn up an ambitious national plan to help the homeless
rediscover a place in society _ and he proposes to organize an
escalating campaign of civil disobedience until his plan is acted
on.
</P>
<P>
   If the authorities eventually decide to arrest him, he says,
they will be arresting America's best-known hurler and cricketer. &QL;

<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ Every Sunday a group of boys from Compton, one of
the bleakest bits of South-Central Los Angeles, team up with a
handful of Irish expatriates to learn the ancient Irish sport of
hurling.
</P>
<P>
   Hurling, a frenetic mixture of lacrosse and hockey, is a hard
game to master if you insist on wearing the ludicrously baggy
clothes of street gangs. Yet the boys seem quite fearless. Hurling
holds few terrors if you grow up in the drive-by shooting capital
of the world.
</P>
<P>
   Even better, they have learned excellent ball skills from
playing the other game that fills their leisure time: cricket.
</P>
<P>
   The man responsible for this is Ted Hayes, a lanky black with
flowing dreadlocks and a greying beard. Hayes is Los Angeles's
leading campaigner for the homeless.
</P>
<P>
   For years he himself lived, voluntarily, on the streets. Then he
built a village of igloo-shaped huts in the shadow of a freeway,
where the homeless can find shelter, give up drugs, and learn
everything from algebra to computer skills.
</P>
<P>
   He is also the city's leading campaigner for the spread of
cricket.
</P>
<P>
   Hayes was introduced to cricket four years ago, when a group of
British expatriates asked him to play. He liked the game so much
that he formed a team of his own consisting of homeless men and
Compton street kids.
</P>
<P>
   His team proved so successful that he led it on a cricket tour
of Britain. This is how hurling came in. Two chance meetings _ one
with Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the second with Mo
Mowlam, Britain's secretary of state for Northern Ireland _
persuaded Hayes that he should include Northern Ireland in his next
tour.
</P>
<P>
   But as he read his Irish history he concluded that cricket had
somewhat divisive connotations in the province. So he added hurling
to his team's repertoire.
</P>
<P>
   Now Hayes wants to turn Compton's baseball stadium into
America's first professional cricket ground, giving international

   PALACIOS, TEXAS _ Trong Van Nguyen sits cross-legged on the
floor of his shop making a shrimp net. His children sit farther
along, snipping and tying. It is two decades since Nguyen came to
the United States from a refugee camp. He has prospered.
</P>
<P>
   His net shop sits just north of Palacios in a place the locals
call ``Vietnamese village.'' Old women in large conical hats and
Vietnamese clothing sit on the steps of trailer homes, or on the
porches of the brick mansions that richer families have built next
door.
</P>
<P>
   The air is heavy with the smell of rotting fish. The Virgin Mary
and assorted Catholic saints stand outside every front door.
</P>
<P>
   The 300 or so Vietnamese living here are all devoutly Catholic.
Father Joe Pham Duc Trinh is their shepherd. People shuffle into
the Catholic chapel before dawn for his morning Mass, conducted in
Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Many of them have been with Father Pham Duc Trinh since he was
their parish priest in their fishing village back on the
southernmost tip of South Vietnam.
</P>
<P>
   Children cycle around the area with their baseball caps
reversed. The priest sighs. As time goes on, he says, the children
are forgetting Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's good, healthy they become Texans, but it still hurts us
old folk...We on the outside, they on the inside: we see America,
they live it.''
</P>
<P>
   In 1976, when they arrived in Palacios, a sleepy shrimping town
of 4,000 people halfway between Houston and Corpus Christi, the
Vietnamese had nothing except the desire to get back, one day, to a
life of fishing.
</P>
<P>
   To begin with they had to make a living in other ways. Men got
construction jobs at a nuclear power station being built on the far
side of Tres Palacios Bay. Women found work in a crab-processing
factory.
</P>
<P>
   Those were tough days. Communication was hard; at first only
Father Pham Duc Trinh spoke English. There was economic tension:
the Vietnamese found steady jobs in an economy that had (and,
amazingly for booming Texas, still has) an unemployment rate of 15
percent.
</P>
<P>
   Some ugly things happened; at places along the Gulf coast,
Vietnamese were beaten to death by white racists. By the early
1980s the Vietnamese in Palacios had saved enough to start building
small shrimp boats. They fished harder than anyone else, even
though by now there were fewer shrimps to be caught.
</P>
<P>
   The competition brought new violence: Vietnamese deckhands got
knifed, and their gear and nets were often sabotaged.
</P>
<P>
   Those days seem a long way off. Now, the harbor's best boats are
mostly Vietnamese-owned. A generation of Vietnamese kids has passed
through Palacios High School. This year, as has become the norm,
both the Valedictorian and the Salutorian of the graduating class
were Vietnamese.
</P>
<P>
   Being Catholics has helped. Vietnamese fishermen are as eager to
have their boats blessed as their Latino neighbors.
</P>
<P>
   More than a million Vietnamese came to America after the defeat
of South Vietnam in 1975. Many were middle-class people who made
for the cities (80,000 live in Houston).
</P>
<P>
   The fishermen who staked their claim in Palacios had to struggle
against the odds. But the non-Vietnamese in Palacios no longer ask
who these foreigners are. They say the Vietnamese remind them of
traditional American virtues much of the country is busy
forgetting: family, community, God, a Herculean work ethic, and a
passionate hatred of communism. &QL;

<TEXT>
<P>
   Cinema-goers in America frequently make noisy attempts to
explain the plot to each other. It is a measure of Steven
Spielberg's mastery of his art that his latest film, ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' has reduced even the most talkative of audiences to
silence.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour epic, released on July 24, has swept to the top
of the box office, taking in $30 million on its opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have hailed the film as easily Spielberg's best. It is
also a milestone for DreamWorks SKG, the studio that Spielberg
founded four years ago with Jeffrey Katzenberg, a Disney executive
credited with many of that studio's cartoon successes, and David
Geffen, a record mogul known for his close contacts with stars.
</P>
<P>
   The first new studio to be founded in 65 years, DreamWorks
rapidly raised $2.7 billion and promised to rewrite the rules of
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Amid much excited talk about ``synergy,'' the founders promised
to produce computer games, records and TV programs as well as
films.
</P>
<P>
   It confirmed a growing belief that the talent could now boss the
suits who run the big entertainment firms, relegating them to being
mere distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that did not happen. Instead, the studios poured money into
special-effects films, not just actors, and Wall Street began to
believe the entertainment conglomerates when they claimed that
content was a mere ingredient; the real value lay in distributing
it. And to cap it all, DreamWorks ran into difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   One was that its grandiose plans to set up a new studio on an
expanse of marshland north of Los Angeles International Airport got
into trouble, leaving DreamWorks embroiled in nasty rows with both
environmentalists and developers, and with premises inefficiently
scattered around the city.
</P>
<P>
   But a more serious problem was the studio's output. Its first
film, ``The Peacemaker,'' a workmanlike thriller, barely broke
even. An early TV series, ``Ink,'' starring Ted Danson, failed
miserably. And the studio's first record release, George Michael's
``Older,'' did little better.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that ``Amistad,'' Spielberg's first film for his new
studio, opened to a lukewarm reception (and a distracting lawsuit
about intellectual-property rights) at the end of 1997, DreamWorks
was said to have spent nearly $1 billion of its capital.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood began to compare the new studio to United Artists, a
company founded in 1919 by another dream team _ Charlie Chaplin,
Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D.W. Griffith _ which ended in
tears and a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' coming as soon as it does after the
DreamWorks team's success with ``Deep Impact,'' an asteroid movie
that has pulled in $138 million, has all but silenced such talk.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks will release two animated films before the end of
this year, ``Antz'' and ``The Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   It now seems safe to say that Spielberg and his colleagues have
proved that you can establish a studio _ albeit one that still
lacks a permanent home _ with little more than your reputations and
your artistic skills.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, then, the suits seem to be in retreat. The
success of ``Titanic,'' the ultimate ``anti-suit'' film (because it
went so far over budget), has given every director the feeling that
he ought to be making three-hour epics costing $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, the growing fashion for contracting out
production to small independent companies has further slimmed the
studios: almost 100,000 of the people employed in the business are
now freelance workers.
</P>
<P>
   Far from controlling the industry, the huge entertainment firms
look ever more like mere publishers, providing the talent with the
necessary money, advertising and distribution. And now Spielberg
seems to have shown them that he can do all this too.
</P>
<P>
   Two things particularly frighten the suits. The immediate one is
that costs may once again get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   When Charlie Chaplin and his colleagues founded United Artists,
a contemporary jibed that the lunatics had taken over the asylum;
there are some signs of this happening again.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the star of ``Saving Private Ryan,''
will each receive 17.5 cents of every dollar earned on the film.
</P>
<P>
   The second fear is longer-term: that technology, and
particularly the Internet, is taking the skill out of distribution,
making it easier for the talent to control things.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Saving Private Ryan'' also shows that the suits still have
some lines of defense. To begin with, the film is a co-production
with Paramount, which has the rights to release the film abroad.
</P>

<P>
   NEW AIYANSH, British Columbia _ Canada's federal government
signed a landmark treaty with west coast Indians on Tuesday, giving
a native group control for the first time of a majestic swath of
pine forest, crystal streams and towering, snowy peaks along with
the legal rights to run their own nation.
</P>
<P>
   The Canadian government had hoped the treaty _ seen as a model
for dozens of other Indian land claims _ would foster the process
of reconciliation between indigenous people and other Canadians.
But its most immediate result so far has been division, suspicion
and great uncertainty throughout British Columbia and across
Canada.
</P>
<P>
   Some Canadians argue that the treaty fundamentally alters the
constitution and endangers the country's delicate unity by allowing
the Indians a level of self-government that it has denied
French-speaking separatists in Quebec.
</P>
<P>
   The rights granted under the treaty are comparable to those of
Indian tribes in the United States, which already have the power to
govern most of what happens on their reservations, although
conflicts occasionally arise there over the extent of Indian
jurisdiction and just who is covered by Indian laws.
</P>
<P>
   The treaty signed on Tuesday in Canada carries with it
tremendous potential for conflict because it was signed so much
later than the comparable treaties in the United States _ most of
which were completed more than a century ago. Some 50 other Indian
groups in British Columbia are pursuing similar claims for
territory covering practically every square mile of the huge
province, including cities like Vancouver. If the precedent set on
Tuesday is repeated, intense clashes over questions of rights are
expected.
</P>
<P>
   Even before Canada's minister of Indian affairs and northern
development, Jane Stewart, arrived for the signing on Tuesday
morning in this remote corner of Canada, hard by Alaska, the
historic treaty with the Nisga'a (pronounced nis-GAH) people was
being attacked. Some residents of British Columbia fear the treaty
establishes a new level of government based on race, with its own
system of privileged justice and sanctioned inequality.
</P>
<P>
   Others criticized its price tag _ the equivalent of $320 million
in U.S. dollars spread out over several years _ as a giveaway.
</P>
<P>
   The commercial fishing industry and others condemned provisions
they feel give the Nisga'a unfair access to natural resources.
</P>
<P>
   But Indian claims were bolstered in December when Canada's
Supreme Court issued a landmark ruling involving the Gitxsan,
another British Columbia Indian group, that Indian claims extend to
the land's natural resources. The court also recognized Indian oral
history as having legal standing.
</P>
<P>
   Nevertheless, rival native groups within the province oppose the
treaty because it impinges on their own land claims. Even members
of one of the four bands that make up the Nisga'a nation has gone
to court to stop the treaty. Members like James H. Stevens say it
is poorly conceived and badly executed because it omits 90 percent
of the territory that the Nisga'a have traditionally claimed.
</P>
<P>
   ``It was done by a bunch of young guys on the negotiation
committee who don't even know our resources or our culture,'' said
Stevens, a 72-year-old elder of the Kincolith band of the Nisga'a.
``Maybe they were just sitting there nodding their heads.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the flood of criticism, federal negotiators and the
majority of Nisga'a leaders believe the treaty breaks new ground in
Canada's long and not always successful relationship with its
native people. ``It's time we did it,'' said Lorene Plante, a
Nisga'a woman who participated in the negotiations for the band's
first-ever treaty with the government.
</P>
<P>
   While also hopeful, Stephen Nyce was more guarded since he, like
many other Nisga'a, have not yet seen the details of the treaty.
``My grandfather told me not to celebrate until you know for sure
what you are celebrating,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Tom Molloy, the chief federal negotiator, said that, for the
first time, an Indian treaty will resolve a question of territory
while establishing the principles of self-government that can free
natives from dependency on the federal government.
</P>
<P>
   ``Today, we join Canada and British Columbia as free citizens,
full and equal participants in the social, economic and political
life of this country,'' said Joseph Gosnell Sr., president of the
Nisga'a Tribal Council. ``We intend to live here forever.''

<P>
   Cinema-goers in America frequently make noisy attempts to
explain the plot to each other. It is a measure of Steven
Spielberg's mastery of his art that his latest film, ``Saving
Private Ryan,'' has reduced even the most talkative of audiences to
silence.
</P>
<P>
   The three-hour epic, released on July 24, has swept to the top
of the box office, taking in $30 million on its opening weekend.
</P>
<P>
   Critics have hailed the film as easily Spielberg's best. It is
also a milestone for DreamWorks SKG, the studio that Spielberg
founded four years ago with Jeffrey Katzenberg, a Disney executive
credited with many of that studio's cartoon successes, and David
Geffen, a record mogul known for his close contacts with stars.
</P>
<P>
   The first new studio to be founded in 65 years, DreamWorks
rapidly raised $2.7 billion and promised to rewrite the rules of
Hollywood.
</P>
<P>
   Amid much excited talk about ``synergy,'' the founders promised
to produce computer games, records and TV programs as well as
films.
</P>
<P>
   It confirmed a growing belief that the talent could now boss the
suits who run the big entertainment firms, relegating them to being
mere distributors.
</P>
<P>
   Yet that did not happen. Instead, the studios poured money into
special-effects films, not just actors, and Wall Street began to
believe the entertainment conglomerates when they claimed that
content was a mere ingredient; the real value lay in distributing
it. And to cap it all, DreamWorks ran into difficulties.
</P>
<P>
   One was that its grandiose plans to set up a new studio on an
expanse of marshland north of Los Angeles International Airport got
into trouble, leaving DreamWorks embroiled in nasty rows with both
environmentalists and developers, and with premises inefficiently
scattered around the city.
</P>
<P>
   But a more serious problem was the studio's output. Its first
film, ``The Peacemaker,'' a workmanlike thriller, barely broke
even. An early TV series, ``Ink,'' starring Ted Danson, failed
miserably. And the studio's first record release, George Michael's
``Older,'' did little better.
</P>
<P>
   By the time that ``Amistad,'' Spielberg's first film for his new
studio, opened to a lukewarm reception (and a distracting lawsuit
about intellectual-property rights) at the end of 1997, DreamWorks
was said to have spent nearly $1 billion of its capital.
</P>
<P>
   Hollywood began to compare the new studio to United Artists, a
company founded in 1919 by another dream team _ Charlie Chaplin,
Douglas Fairbanks, Mary Pickford and D.W. Griffith _ which ended in
tears and a takeover.
</P>
<P>
   ``Saving Private Ryan,'' coming as soon as it does after the
DreamWorks team's success with ``Deep Impact,'' an asteroid movie
that has pulled in $138 million, has all but silenced such talk.
</P>
<P>
   DreamWorks will release two animated films before the end of
this year, ``Antz'' and ``The Prince of Egypt.''
</P>
<P>
   It now seems safe to say that Spielberg and his colleagues have
proved that you can establish a studio _ albeit one that still
lacks a permanent home _ with little more than your reputations and
your artistic skills.
</P>
<P>
   For the moment, then, the suits seem to be in retreat. The
success of ``Titanic,'' the ultimate ``anti-suit'' film (because it
went so far over budget), has given every director the feeling that
he ought to be making three-hour epics costing $200 million.
</P>
<P>
   More generally, the growing fashion for contracting out
production to small independent companies has further slimmed the
studios: almost 100,000 of the people employed in the business are
now freelance workers.
</P>
<P>
   Far from controlling the industry, the huge entertainment firms
look ever more like mere publishers, providing the talent with the
necessary money, advertising and distribution. And now Spielberg
seems to have shown them that he can do all this too.
</P>
<P>
   Two things particularly frighten the suits. The immediate one is
that costs may once again get out of control.
</P>
<P>
   When Charlie Chaplin and his colleagues founded United Artists,
a contemporary jibed that the lunatics had taken over the asylum;
there are some signs of this happening again.
</P>
<P>
   Spielberg and Tom Hanks, the star of ``Saving Private Ryan,''
will each receive 17.5 cents of every dollar earned on the film.
</P>
<P>
   The second fear is longer-term: that technology, and
particularly the Internet, is taking the skill out of distribution,
making it easier for the talent to control things.
</P>
<P>
   Yet ``Saving Private Ryan'' also shows that the suits still have
some lines of defense. To begin with, the film is a co-production
with Paramount, which has the rights to release the film abroad.
</P>
<P>
   And DreamWorks's distribution system is still less competent
than its filmmaking: a glitch left many cinemas without copies of
the film on the morning of its opening.
</P>
<P>
   But the best argument for the suits continuing to sleep soundly
is, ironically, Spielberg himself. Put simply, he seems to be a
one-off. Of the 16 movies he directed before ``Saving Private
Ryan,'' 13 turned a profit (normally only a third do).
</P>
<P>

suitish eye for the bottom line.

remarkably small amount for such a grandiose epic.

NEW AIYANSH, British Columbia: here forever.'' 
<TEXT>
<P>
   While Indian self-government is a new concept in Canada, most of
the more than 500 Indian tribes and councils in the United States
already govern themselves to varying degrees, and with occasional
challenges from non-natives. Jerry J. Cordova, a negotiator with
the office of self governance in the Department of the Interior,
said that, in most cases, non-Indians are not allowed to run for
office or vote in tribal elections, but there are exceptions.
</P>
<P>
   The American tribes consider themselves sovereign nations, a
view not always shared by individual states and the federal
government. The tribes often do not tax their own members or
non-natives. In some instances, their right to do so has been
challenged in court.
</P>
<P>
   The experience of the American Indians suggests that a tribe's
ability to govern itself greatly increases the chances of it
reaching economic independence. ``Tribes that do have better
control over their assets _ whether cultural assets or trust funds
_ are more successful in economic development,'' said Lela M.
Shepard, development associate with the First Nations Development
Institute, a nonprofit group that provides financial assistance to
Indian tribes like the Pauma Tribe of Southern California, which
used a $300,000 grant to improve its orange and avocado orchards.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Shepard said that the biggest problem for most tribes is
raising the money to begin projects, since many banks are reluctant
to lend them money.
</P>
<P>
   The Nisga'a treaty that was signed on Tuesday will allow the
indigenous people here to run most of the social and economic
activity in the vast area they will control _ roughly four-fifths
the size of Rhode Island. They will set and collect taxes and
determine how the revenue is spent, while agreeing to eventually
give up the exemption from some sales and income taxes they have
had.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Stewart, the Indian affairs minister, praised the treaty,
calling it ``a just and honorable settlement,'' that reinforces the
supreme court of Canada's directive that negotiation, not
litigation, is the way to settle native land claims.
</P>
<P>
   Following Tuesday's signing, the treaty proposal will be put to
a referendum among the registered members of the Nisga'a. There are
about 5,500 Nisga'a, but fewer than 2,000 live in the area that is
considered their ancestral home.
</P>
<P>
   Some British Columbia residents want a province-wide referendum
on the treaty because they say that by preventing non-Indians from
running for government offices or voting in such elections, the
treaty fundamentally changes Canada's Constitution.
</P>
<P>
   Indian leaders have rejected the idea of a provincial
referendum, calling it ``the white man's veto.'' British Columia
Premier Glen Clark said the 250-page treaty is too complicated to
be put to such a broad test. The people of British Columbia will be
able to participate, Clark said, when the treaty goes before the
provincial legislature.
</P>
<P>
   Following that, it will also be voted on by the Parliament in
Ottawa. Negotiators believe that the whole process could be
completed by next spring, although substantial objections could
delay it.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS.)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   Unlike the eastern provinces that signed land treaties with
Indian groups hundreds of years ago, British Columbia entered into
only a few such deals on Vancouver Island and in the northeastern
part of the province before abandoning the process. Small,
scattered reserves were created but the natives themselves never
surrendered claim to traditional lands.
</P>
<P>
   By all measures, Canada's more than 800,000 indigenous people
are the poorest, least educated and least healthy Canadians, which
deeply embarrasses many Canadians. The federal government has been
looking for a way to change the situation by embracing the idea of
self-rule.
</P>
<P>
   Government officials hope that by giving native groups clear
title they not only can compensate for past injustices but also
encourage forestry, mining and other activities to sustain
independence. Uncertainty over who controls the land has hampered
such efforts.
</P>
<P>
   Tuesday's treaty is considered full and final, and can only be
amended with the consent of the natives, the province and the
federal government. ``It's a done deal,'' said Jack Ebbels, the
chief negotiator for British Columbia.
</P>
<P>
   But this is not like past deals in which Indian bands were
bullied into giving away most of their land.
</P>
<P>
   The Nisga'a will become major land holders in British Columbia,
owning the land outright, just like other property holders. They
will own the rights to all the timber, except for existing leases,
and subsurface minerals, and will be able to negotiate future
contracts.
</P>
<P>
   Local government will be in the hands of the Nisga'a, who will
have the power to make laws concerning language and culture,
property, employment, traffic and most social services. The 100 or
so non-Indians living on Nisga'a land will not be allowed to run
for office or vote, although they will have the chance to do so in
elections involving education and health boards that directly
affect them.
</P>
<P>
   These restrictions have already stirred a huge controversy that
threatens to derail the ratification of the treaty. Despite the
small number of non-Indians on Nisga'a land, critics are worried
about the precedent of establishing governments on racial lines.
</P>
<P>
   ``For the first time I know of, they are entrenching inequality
in the constitution of Canada,'' said Gordon Campbell, leader of
the Liberal opposition in British Columbia. Campbell said that this
also endangers Canada's delicate national unity. ``We are giving to
the Nisga'a government something that the Quebec government asked
for a long time ago and were told: `No, you can't have it.'''
</P>
<P>
   But Ms. Stewart, the Indian minister, said the constitution
actually guarantees natives special rights simply because they were
in Canada before Europeans arrived. She said the federal government
fully supports the restrictions that the treaty places on
participation in native government.
</P>
<P>
   But that has proved to be a far more uncomfortable position for
the province. ``It was a thorny, thorny issue,'' said Ebbels, the
provincial negotiator. He suggested that the province had been
worried about non-natives being taxed by the Nisga'a without any
representation in the local government. In the end, Indian taxing
powers were restricted to natives, while non-natives will continue
paying taxes to the province.
</P>
<P>
   ``We took some comfort in that,'' Ebbels said.

   Most new head office buildings are designed to impress from the
outside: the soaring tower, the sparkling fountains, and so on. But
the newly opened corporate headquarters of British Airways, five
miles west of London's Heathrow Airport, is radically different.
</P>
<P>
   It is designed to impress the people who work inside it, chiefly
by bringing them into contact with each other as they move around
the space.
</P>
<P>
   BA is the latest company to wake up to the fact that the design
of head offices can have a marked effect on productivity.
</P>
<P>
   When Nortel, a Canadian telecoms company, decided to move from
its central, high-rise premises in Toronto to a converted factory
in the suburbs, it won over reluctant employees by turning its new
base into a self-contained town.
</P>
<P>
   It has streets, cafes, restaurants, indoor parks, even a Zen
garden. And BA is not the first airline to fall in love with indoor
streets: the head office of SAS outside Stockholm also has them,
full of shops and cafes.
</P>
<P>
   When BA decided to abandon its ancient office building beside
Heathrow's runways, Bob Ayling, its boss, made up his mind to
``move the office, change the culture.''
</P>
<P>
   Ayling (a former civil servant) has long believed that the
airline retains a bureaucratic hangover from its days in the public
sector. He wants to use the new offices to make a decisive break
with the past.
</P>
<P>
   Step inside BA's front door and you soon understand that things
have changed. After passing the receptionists, lined up like
check-in desks, you walk between two giant wheels from the
undercarriage of a jumbo jet.
</P>
<P>
   The main corridor linking six small office blocks within the
complex is a village street, complete with cobbles and wayside
trees. The core of the building deliberately tries to ape an
English village square.
</P>
<P>
   Workers arriving from the basement parking lot have to walk
across the square to get to their office space. The aim is to
ensure that people's paths cross, easing informal communications.
</P>
<P>
   John Wood is the airline's director for the Pacific Rim market.
Like other BA employees, he does not have his own office. In the
two weeks a month that he is not traveling he uses a ``touchdown''
area next to the team area where his staff work.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, BA clung to old bureaucratic norms, with bosses on a
floor to themselves far away from their staff.
</P>
<P>
   Ayling says that when he wants to talk with one of his directors
he is forced to walk through the building, meeting people on the
way and exchanging a few words. ``I learn more in a couple of days
than I used to in a month,'' he says.
</P>
<P>
   The building is more than a traditional corporate headquarters;
it also houses a training department right by the village square,
complete with a mock-up of a jumbo jet's first-class cabin.
</P>
<P>
   On any day, 500 front-line cabin crew or ground staff are there
on a course. Ayling hopes this too will break down barriers between
head office and staff in the field.
</P>
<P>
   It takes more than a world-class architect (in BA's case Niels
Torp) to make such an idea work. BA has invested K10 million ($16
million) in fancy IT; staff wander around with digital cordless
telephones that double as their desk phones. Employees can even
order groceries electronically from a local store and have them
delivered to their car in the garage before they go home.
</P>
<P>
   Liberated by technology, companies are beginning to tear down
the walls of the traditional office. Andersen Consulting in Paris
has gone furthest, with its consultants flitting through and
booking space, with no fixed abode of their own.
</P>
<P>
   The price can be seen in the occasional sad cart trundling
around with an absent consultant's personal possessions. But a
revolution is underway. A new report by IDRC, a property research
organization, concludes that companies now realize that ``team
space'' is what is needed, since one-fifth of workers in most
companies operate in teams.
</P>
<P>
   Out go rigid little compartments and vague open plans; in come
team areas, cyber-cafes, and nice places to linger. &QL;

CAN'T COUNT ANYONE OUT OF TITLE RACE
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By KEVIN MODESTI  
 c.1998 Los Angeles Daily News  
<TEXT>
<P>
   LOS ANGELES _ They held the Pacific-10 Conference football media
day, the first official event of the 1998 season, in a fancy Los
Angeles airport hotel Tuesday. They should have held it in a
7-Eleven, with coaches, players and reporters huddled around the
lottery dispenser.
</P>
<P>
   At the very least, they should have found a hotel with a casino.
Because lately, Pac-10 football seems to be a game of chance. And
just once, I'd like to watch the spin of the wheel, the roll of the
dice or the cut of the cards that determines the champion.
</P>
<P>
   In the past six years, six different schools have represented
the Pac-10 in the Rose Bowl. Even Oregon and Washington State. In
the same span, !ital!nine!off! different Pac-10 schools have ended
the season in the Associated Press top 25. Even Cal and Stanford.
</P>
<P>
   The conference slogan ought to be, ``Who's next?''
</P>
<P>
   Oregon State, of course, suspects the whole thing is rigged. But
everybody else in the league has reason for optimism with exactly a
month to go before the season begins in earnest Sept. 5.
</P>
<P>
   Usually, you laugh when last year's cellar-dwellers brag about
having most of their starters returning. And when last year's
champion smiles about how wholesale graduations have made room for
young talent. And when every single coach talks about how more of
his players than ever spent the summer in the weight room.
</P>
<P>
   In the Pac-10, you don't laugh.
</P>
<P>
   ``Our conference is very, very balanced,'' said Mike Riley, the
former USC and Cal assistant who is about to begin his second
season as Oregon State's head coach. ``Everybody's picking UCLA and
Arizona State to win it, but there's no reason somebody else in the
conference couldn't rise up.''
</P>
<P>
   Part of the media-day festivities is the release of the
preseason poll of reporters who cover the Pac-10. Thirty writers
voted this time. Sixteen picked UCLA to win. Fourteen picked ASU.
Totaling up the 1-to-10 votes, UCLA emerged as a narrow favorite
over ASU. Washington is a distant third, USC is fourth and
defending champion Washington State is seventh.
</P>
<P>
   Understand, though, that Washington State was seventh in the
poll a year ago. And that the poll has forecast the eventual winner
only once in the past five years. And that three times in the past
five years, the eventual champion was picked in the bottom half of
the poll.
</P>
<P>
   Throwing darts might be more accurate.
</P>
<P>
   You might think that's a reflection on the voters. I prefer to
think it's a reflection on the conference.
</P>
<P>
   ``It must be difficult to stay on top, because nobody's been
able to do it,'' said Bruce Snyder, who was the national coach of
the year in 1996, when he led ASU to a surprising Pac-10 title.
``I've never done it.''
</P>
<P>
   Snyder counts it as a minor victory that ASU finished third in
the conference in 1997, which is as high as any defending champion
has finished since Washington threepeated in 1990-91-92.
</P>
<P>
   The days when you could automatically pencil in USC, UCLA and
Washington at the top of the Pac-10 _ those three schools went to
21 out of 22 Rose Bowls starting in 1973 _ are long gone.
</P>
<P>
   In fact, Snyder has a simple explanation for the parity or
``flattening out'' of the Pac-10, which is not that the rest of the
league has gotten stronger but that the traditional powers haven't
recruited as effectively as they once did.
</P>
<P>
   ``Twenty years ago, the best players in Los Angeles would go to
'SC or UCLA,'' Snyder said. They're increasingly scattered across
the country.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think we're losing players to schools to the east of us. We
don't get our good ones, and they're taking our good ones,'' Snyder
said.
</P>
<P>
   Now, the Pac-10 is an annual crapshoot.
</P>
<P>
   USC and ASU can win it because they have the deepest supply of
wide receivers, the league's hottest position. UCLA can win it
because it has Cade McNown, the nation's most efficient quarterback
last season.
</P>
<P>
   Arizona can win it because you never know with a young team.
Washington can win it because Brock Huard can always find somebody
to throw to. Washington State can win it because it's so darned
quick.
</P>
<P>
   Cal can win it because, for the first time in four years, it
didn't change offensive or defensive coordinators. Stanford can win
it because it remembers the hurt of last year's underachievement.
</P>
<P>
   Oregon can win it because the league's worst defense should be
improved. And Oregon State?
</P>
<P>
   ``We have recent examples of the fact schools from a non-urban
environment can rise up and win,'' Riley said, explaining why ``I
have not wavered in my confidence in what we can get done.''
</P>
<P>
   So they plunge back into the lottery. Hey, somebody has to win. &QL;

   TEL AVIV _ They are probably the youngest self-made millionaires
in the Middle East: the four Israelis who founded Mirabilis Ltd.,
then sold the company and its ICQ software in June to America
Online Inc. for $287 million.
</P>
<P>
   Arik Vardi, Amnon Amir, Yair Goldfinger, and Sefi Vigiser, who
met after they had served their compulsory three years in the
Israeli Army, have distributed ICQ free on the Internet since 1995.
</P>
<P>
   They will receive additional payments of as much as $120 million
from AOL starting in three years, provided that certain milestones
are met.
</P>
<P>
   The success of Mirabilis provides the latest evidence that
Israel is becoming a force in the computer industry. High-tech
exports accounted for more than a third of overall Israeli exports
last year.
</P>
<P>
   ICQ (I Seek You) enables subscribers dialing into the Internet
to alert friends and acquaintances who are on-line at the same
time. Users who find each other using the program can then exchange
typed messages in real time.
</P>
<P>
   The program now has more than 12 million subscribers _ with
thousands of chat groups set up by users themselves.
</P>
<P>
   ``ICQ users are very loyal, almost like fans of a pop group or
supporters of a football club,'' said Yossi Vardi, chief executive
of Mirabilis and father of one of the founders. ``And they bring
their friends. It's incredible _ we're getting a million new users
every 19 days.''
</P>
<P>
   The Mirabilis founders took a gamble when the decided to give
away their program. ``Getting the market share was the most
important thing,'' said Vardi. ``Our long-term strategy was to
gravitate users to ICQ. We had 10 different scenarios in our head
as to how the asset would be converted into value.''
</P>
<P>
   Until AOL bought the company, it had raised $3 million through
private issues. AOL's offer included the contractual promise _
important to its founders _ to keep the company in Israel, and
retain all of its 70 employees.
</P>
<P>
   Israel, a country of 5.8 million, has sprouted hundreds of
high-tech companies that are producing cutting-edge
Internet-related technology.
</P>
<P>
   Israel has about 4,000 high-tech firms, 70 of which trade of
Wall Street with a combined market capitalization of more than $22
billion, according to the Israeli Export Institute.
</P>
<P>
   The high-tech explosion was partly fueled by the influx of
thousands of immigrants from the former Soviet Union in the early
1990s. Many of them were trained in computer programming and now
serve as the backbone of the industry.
</P>
<P>
   Another push came, ironically, from the demise of the defense
industry in Israel, which forced employees of government-run firms
into the commercial market.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, the advanced military systems Israel uses creates a
youthful, energetic high-tech work force straight out of the army.
The three founders of another success story, GEO-Interactive, met
in the Israeli Defense Forces.
</P>
<P>
   ``The IDF was, in a way, our university,'' said Eli Reifman, 28,
the vice president of marketing and sales at GEO-Interactive.
</P>
<P>
   The company makes Emblaze software, which delivers video,
animation, and sound over the Internet in real time. The software
compresses information so that it is able to move more quickly over
the Internet.
</P>
<P>
   The founders of GEO-Interactive raised money by borrowing
through credit cards and taking loans from banks _ asking their
parents to sign guarantees.
</P>
<P>
   In October 1996, GEO-Interactive made an initial public offering
on the Alternative Investment Market in London.
</P>
<P>
   The GEO-INteractive founders raised their money by themselves,
but many Israeli high-tech companies have had help from the state.
</P>
<P>
   Successive Israeli governments have poured money into start-ups,
assisting them with funds specifically for marketing and
development.
</P>
<P>
   Drew Tick, an entrepreneur from Jerusalem, quit his job to take
a gamble on his idea _ a ``virtual newspaper'' that delivers an
electronic version of print publications directly to the user's PC.
Tick wanted to produce a program that would make it look like the
original.
</P>
<P>
   Two years later, Tick's start-up company, Zebra Pushware
Solutions, produced the Infopager, which has generated interest
among newspapers and magazines all over the world, and now has a
distribution agreement with International Business Machines Corp.
(IBM).
</P>
<P>
   The stalled Mideast peace process does not seem to have had much
of a negative effect on Israel's nascent high-tech industry.
``Fortunately, people still invest here,'' Tick said.
</P>
<P>
   That is borne out by the figures. In 1997, high-tech exports
brought in $6 billion, or 34 percent of overall exports, figures
from the Israeli Export Institute show. &QL;

Postseason, TV sanctions avoided
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By DANNY ROBBINS &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
LUBBOCK _ The NCAA ended its long-running investigation of the
Texas Tech athletic program Tuesday by placing the university on
four years' probation and adding modestly to the penalties Tech
previously imposed on itself.
</P>
<P>
   In largely accepting Tech's self-imposed penalties, the NCAA
Division I Committee on Infractions provided a sense of relief for
Tech fans and officials, many of whom had feared the school's
football team would be barred from postseason play this year.
</P>
<P>
   The committee added a year of probation to the three years
imposed by Tech and cut additional scholarships in football, men's
basketball, women's basketball and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   The lack of a ban on postseason competition in football was a
bow to Tech chancellor John Montford's decision to remove the Red
Raiders from eligibility for the Big 12 Conference title game or a
bowl appearance last season. Tech also took its men's basketball
team out of consideration for the 1997 NCAA Tournament after two
players were found to have competed while ineligible.
</P>
<P>
   The Red Raiders also will not be prohibited from appearing on
television.
</P>
<P>
   The apparent leniency in sentencing did not soften the view of
the Tech athletic program articulated by the committee, which found
11 areas of major rules violations.
</P>
<P>
   Of particular significance, the committee said, was that Tech
lacked institutional control in the operation of its athletic
program as a result of a variety of factors, including
administrative mistakes that allowed at least 76 student-athletes
in eight sports to compete while ineligible from 1990-91 through
1996-97.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also concluded that Tech officials, most notably
faculty athletic representative Robert Sweazy, failed to adequately
investigate rules violations that came to their attention in 1995.
</P>
<P>
   Among the other findings were academic fraud involving
correspondence-course credit obtained by former Tech defensive
lineman Stephen Gaines and improper extra benefits for
student-athletes, including free bail bonds and legal services
provided by representatives of the university's athletic interests.
</P>
<P>
   Montford said the committee had treated Tech fairly and that the
university would not appeal any aspect of the case to the Division
I Infractions Appeals Committee.
</P>
<P>
   ``The NCAA infractions committee was evenhanded,'' he said in a
prepared statement. ``It was very fair throughout this whole
process. The university was afforded the opportunity to fully and
fairly present our case.
</P>
<P>
   ``Taken together, the sanctions that we imposed on ourselves and
the additional sanctions imposed by the NCAA show that both Tech
and the NCAA understood the seriousness of the situation.''
</P>
<P>
   He added: ``Hopefully, never again at Texas Tech will we be
required to look young athletes in the eye and tell them they
cannot participate because of administrative errors, sloppy
paperwork and inattention to details.''
</P>
<P>
   Said Tech president Donald Haragan: ``I think now we can put
this behind us and move on down the road.''
</P>
<P>
   Tech football coach Spike Dykes said he was glad to get the
case, which formally began in early 1996, behind him.
</P>
<P>
   ``The good thing about this is after today, people will talk
about something besides the NCAA,'' he said. ``This is great.
Whatever the verdict had been, we would have lived with it and said
the same thing. It's tough, but it's behind us. Let's get on with
the rest of our lives.''
</P>
<P>
   According to the committee's report, the ``culture'' at Tech
during the time of the violations did not place a high priority on
compliance with NCAA rules, and there was no clear oversight or
control of the athletic department by the university.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it's rare to have this level of a lack of monitoring,
basic procedures, and especially at a major institution like Texas
Tech,'' said Bonnie Slatton, the University of Iowa physical
education professor who served as the committee's chairperson
during the Tech case.
</P>
<P>
   Acknowledging the scope of the violations, particularly the
number of athletes who competed while ineligible, she said: ``I
don't know of another case we've had that would reach that level.''
</P>
<P>
   Despite the scope of the violations, the committee noted in its
report that ``new leadership'' at Tech, in place since March 1996,
had made the university more effective in dealing with potential
infractions and that the school had taken corrective steps to deal
with the administrative errors within the athletic department.
</P>
<P>
   March 1996 was when Robert Lawless gave up his position as Tech
president to take a similar post at the University of Tulsa. Upon
Lawless' departure, Tech regents created the position of chancellor
for Montford, the region's longtime representative in the state
Senate, and gave the school's presidency to Haragan, who had served
as Tech's executive vice president and provost.
</P>
<P>
   Bob Bockrath was Tech's athletic director from August 1993 to
June 1996, when he took charge of the athletic department at the
University of Alabama.
</P>
<P>
   The only current or former Tech employee officially sanctioned
was Rhudy Maskew, an assistant football coach for 10 years before
his resignation in 1997. The committee instituted a ``show cause''
order that will keep Maskew, currently in private business in
Corpus Christi, from working at NCAA schools for three years.
</P>
<P>
   The committee found that Maskew completed and submitted
``significant portions'' of Gaines' work on an Old Testament
correspondence course offered by Southeastern College of the
Assemblies of God during the summer of 1993. The panel also cited
Maskew for unethical conduct.
</P>
<P>
   The case in essence began four years ago with the NCAA
enforcement staff's scrutiny of the academic credentials of all
college athletes who had obtained correspondence-course credit from
Southeastern College, the Lakeland, Fla., Bible college at the
heart of the academic cheating scandal that occurred in the Baylor
University basketball program.
</P>
<P>
   As a result of issues relating to Gaines and other matters, the
NCAA initiated a preliminary inquiry of the Tech athletic program
in February 1996.
</P>
<P>
   As the probe entered its second year, investigators found
questions about the eligibility of numerous athletes. During the
1997 Big 12 tournament, it was discovered that two members of
Tech's men's basketball team, Gracen Averil and Deuce Jones, had
been improperly certified as eligible for the 1996-97 season.
</P>
<P>
   The matter caused Tech to forfeit 11 wins and pull out of
consideration for the NCAA Tournament. It also prompted Tech to
conduct the audit that ultimately showed the widespread nature of
the problem.
</P>
<P>
   Another university audit revealed that improper financial aid
had been awarded in baseball and three other sports.
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA's letter of official inquiry in the case, submitted to
Tech last October and encompassing the audits as well as 16 areas
of alleged wrongdoing developed by NCAA enforcement personnel, led
Montford to make his call removing the football team from bowl
consideration.
</P>
<P>
   Slatton cited Tech's willingness to punish itself through NCAA
Tournament and bowl bans as a key factor in the committee's
thinking.
</P>
<P>
   ``Those are penalties that institutions rarely, if ever, would
impose on themselves,'' she said. ``The committee felt that this
showed a seriousness with which the institution was moving forward.
We commend them for the steps they took.''
</P>
<P>
   Still, because of the nature of the violations, the committee
felt additional sanctions were necessary. The committee cited
Tech's lack of institutional control, the significant recruiting
and competitive advantages gained as a result of the violations,
the length of time over which the infractions occurred, and the
fact that the violations were systemic and involved multiple
sports.
</P>
<P>
   The committee reduced by four the number of initial football
scholarships Tech can give for the 2000-2001 academic year,
bringing to 18 the number of initial grants the Raiders will give
up over three years. Tech's self-imposed sanctions included a loss
of eight initial scholarships for 1998-99 and six for 1999-2000.
</P>
<P>
   The committee also added a penalty requiring Tech to limit its
total number of football players on scholarship by five during the
1999-2000 and 2000-2001 school years. Scholarships also were cut
for men's basketball and baseball.
</P>
<P>
   Montford, in an interview Tuesday, said he found no joy or
vindication in the fact that Tech avoided another bowl sanction.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't think there's anything to be proud of,'' he said.
``The important message is we need to be diligent.''

Dykes, Raiders ready to move on
<TEXT>
<P>
   &UR; By JONATHAN FEIGEN &LR;  &QL; 
 &UR; c. 1998, Houston Chronicle &LR;  &QL; 
Late Monday night, it finally rained in Lubbock. Tuesday, the dark
cloud moved on.
</P>
<P>
   Texas Tech received stiffer NCAA sanctions, deeper scholarship
cuts, and a longer probation period than it expected Tuesday. And
Tech football coach Spike Dykes had to fight the urge to celebrate.
</P>
<P>
   To Dykes, Tuesday's news was good, because it meant the end of a
long NCAA investigation and uncertainty about sanctions that
finally had come. And though the report brought additional
scholarship cuts in football, men's and women's basketball and
baseball, Dykes said with no bowl or television sanctions, Tech can
move out from under the threatening skies that have hovered above
his program.
</P>
<P>
   ``The great thing about it all is it's over,'' Dykes said. ``The
shadows that we lived in as long as we have, all we have been
through, it's really great it is over. That's wonderful. The bad
part is we've had 2{ years of black cloud over our school. It's
time to reclaim our credibility.
</P>
<P>
   ``There's no more cloud, no more maybes, no more uncertainties.
That's the great thing about it. If you only knew what the last two
years have been for our guys. They've been told everything in the
world. They expected the worst. Some of these recruits were told
that if they came here, they would never, ever be able to play in a
bowl game. You believe what people tell you. Now we can go about
business. We'll be a bigger, better, stronger university because of
this.''
</P>
<P>
   The Red Raiders have achieved the six Division I-A wins required
to play in a bowl for five consecutive seasons. But Tech last
season removed itself from postseason consideration and contention
for the Big 12 South championship.
</P>
<P>
   With a generally veteran team returning this season and an
unusually soft schedule, Tech can play on TV and should contend for
a bowl.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think it was fair,'' running back Ricky Williams said. ``If
we get a chance to go to a bowl, that is fair enough for me. I
think all of my teammates had worries and concerns if we were going
to get to play in a bowl, especially last season's freshmen.''
</P>
<P>
   With limited scholarship players coming in this fall and for two
more years _ a loss of 18 scholarships over three seasons _ visible
success this year could also be key to surviving Tuesday's hits.
</P>
<P>
   ``The hardest thing I ever had to do is tell the kids last year
they would not go to a bowl and not be considered for a chance at
the championship,'' Dykes said. ``That was bitter duty.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think what we've got is some tough sanctions, and there's no
doubt about them. But they're things we can live with. It's hard to
play anything if you can't compete for a championship. We're
afforded that chance, which is great.''
</P>
<P>
   It also could be vital. With scholarship cuts limiting Tech
recruiting for the three consecutive seasons, it would be more
important than ever that a large percentage of its recruits pan
out. The effects of scholarship cuts are often felt three or four
seasons after the actual sanctions, when recruits signed in limited
classes are juniors and seniors, potentially forcing Tech to live
with Tuesday's news through the 2004 season.
</P>
<P>
   Texas A&AMP;M coach R.C. Slocum said last season the Aggies'
relative slide the past two seasons could be traced to
investigations and sanctions when last season's seniors were
recruited. Oklahoma and Oklahoma State have spent much of the
decade trying to dig out of scholarship limits assessed in the
1980s. Alabama still cites a total scholarship limit similar to
Tech's limit of 80 for its struggles.
</P>
<P>
   ``I don't have enough foresight to know (how long Tech will feel
the result of Tuesday's sanctions),'' Dykes said. ``With all these
clouds, all that was said, written and done, we probably had two of
our best classes as far as talent back-to-back. Even this one,
being eight short (of the usual NCAA limit of 25), the ones we got
are outstanding. We feel good about that.''
</P>
<P>
   The Tech men's basketball program will have to deal with similar
long-term ramifications. The NCAA Committee on Infractions
increased Tech's self-imposed scholarship cut from six over three
years to seven. The NCAA scholarship cuts will allow Tech as few as
10 scholarship players in one of the next three seasons, barely
enough for a scrimmage of scholarship athletes.
</P>
<P>
   With such a drastically reduced margin for error, the
development of the recruits the Red Raiders do sign, especially
this season's six incoming prospects, will be crucial for much
longer than three seasons.
</P>
<P>
   Tech men's basketball coach James Dickey, working with a Big 12
all-star team in Dallas, did not return messages Tuesday.
</P>
<P>
   The sanctions also cost Tech 90 percent of revenue earned from
its 1996 Sweet 16 season and revenue from the remaining four
seasons in which that season's success would figure into the NCAA
Tournament revenue distribution formula. Tech had removed itself
from consideration for an at-large berth to the 1997 Tournament.
</P>
<P>
   But even if there could be a long-term effect, for Dykes and his
program, Tuesday's news marked the first steps past the gloom.
</P>
<P>
   ``In the back of your mind, you know it is coming, and you don't
know what is going to happen,'' quarterback Rob Peters said.
``That's the scary thing _ the fact we had no idea from anybody.
The fact that it's out and it's outlined, you can see what's
happening and what's going to happen is a great relief.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's really nice to have it over. It's a big weight off our
shoulders.''

8 MONTHS AFTER BRICKS FELL, LIVES ARE STILL BEING STITCHED BACK
TOGETHER 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By DAVID W. CHEN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ A skyscraper in midtown Manhattan rains debris on the
buildings and streets below. Emergency workers evacuate residents
and divert traffic as public officials promise action and the news
media switch into high gear. Construction crews wrap the building
with protective netting.
</P>
<P>
   This, of course, is a summary of recent events at the Conde Nast
building in Times Square, in which a temporary elevator tower
collapsed, dumping tons of steel and killing one person. It is also
what occurred in December at 540 Madison Ave., near 55th Street,
when a ton of bricks peeled off the building's facade, injuring two
people and bringing life on the block to a screeching halt.
</P>
<P>
   The difference, however, is that while city officials are still
trying to restore Times Square to normal, 540 Madison has
essentially become old news, the first of several building
accidents to dog the city since December. Yet if 540 Madison offers
a lesson for those displaced by recent, current and future mishaps,
it is that reassembling one's life after such a calamity can be
much more difficult than first imagined, well after the initial
surge of publicity and sympathy has petered out.
</P>
<P>
   ``Although you might get promises, my advice is: Do not count on
anyone,'' said Andrew Terzis, who is still reeling financially
after being forced from his business, the Persian Shop, and his
apartment, both at 534 Madison, for a month. ``Save your energy,
because you don't know how long it's going to last.''
</P>
<P>
   Though it has been eight months since the bricks fell and five
months since the last of those displaced returned to their
apartments, most of the dozen or so residents of Madison's west
side between East 54th and 55th Streets have only been reimbursed a
fraction of their out-of-pocket expenses. Many are deeply in debt.
At least two businesses have closed for good and three others have
yet to reopen.
</P>
<P>
   The impact has been more than financial. Those who were
displaced have lost time and energy, while scrambling to rebuild
the architecture of their lives.
</P>
<P>
   A couple postponed plans to adopt a child. A businessman who had
reveled as his new restaurant earned rave reviews last winter
recoiled as falling bricks forced him to close temporarily. The
Vermont Teddy Bear Store, where stuffed animals floated face down
in rainwater that had trickled down from the shattered roof, called
it quits, its momentum destroyed by the uncertainty.
</P>
<P>
   The victims felt their loss in small ways, too. Like canceling
plans for a share in a summer vacation house. Or declining,
repeatedly, to join friends for a night on the town. Losing the
will, in other words, to do anything spontaneous in a city that
breeds spontaneity.
</P>
<P>
   ``Psychologically, it's been devastating on us,'' said Wendy
Gering, a real estate agent. She and her husband, Eric, an
architect, could not return to their home and office at 536 Madison
for two months. ``It's taken an emotional and physical toll.''
</P>
<P>
   The financial hardships, at least, were supposed to be erased
quickly, but it hasn't turned out that way. While affected business
owners have sought relief from their own insurance companies, few
of the residential tenants were insured.
</P>
<P>
   In December, Harry Macklowe, the developer who has owned 540
Madison since 1996, promised residents that he would ``pick up all
the expenses they are incurring.'' Jerome Hauer, the director of
the Mayor's Office of Emergency Management, vowed that he would
hold Macklowe to his word.
</P>
<P>
   By the time the residents returned in January and February to
their apartments in the five-story brownstones at 534 and 536
Madison, they had accumulated debts of $1,000 to $40,000, for a
total of about $162,000.
</P>
<P>
   A few expenses raised eyebrows: designer clothing, expensive
meals and other items that did not seem to qualify as emergency
provisions. But in any case, the residents have received only about
$36,000 in emergency advances, in lieu of actual reimbursements.
</P>
<P>
   The explanation, Macklowe's representatives say, is that
Inter-Reco of Jericho, N.Y., Macklowe's insurer, has determined
that Macklowe is not responsible for the shoddily constructed brick
facade. As a result, Inter-Reco has solicited other companies
involved with the 28-year-old building.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's an unpleasant situation for everyone,'' said Gerald
McKelvey, a spokesman for the Macklowe Organization.
``Unfortunately for the people who are displaced, this takes
time.''
</P>
<P>
   When that time comes, each claim will be processed judiciously,
McKelvey said, with the understanding that ``any advance from the
Macklowe Organization is an admission of nothing other than,
`Here's an advance on your claim.'''
</P>
<P>
   For many New Yorkers, the amounts involved may not seem like
much. But most of the Madison Avenue residents are young
professionals in their 20s and early 30s, worker bees on Wall
Street or in midtown with little in savings and no concept of
renter's insurance.
</P>
<P>
   ``To Mr. Macklowe, it's chump change,'' said Richard Kennedy of
536 Madison, a buyer for an industrial corporation, who has been
the residents' liaison with officialdom. ``To us, it's our credit
history.''
</P>
<P>
   Inevitably, the fallout from 540 Madison has entered the legal
arena. One class-action lawsuit contends that the accident crippled
businesses on surrounding blocks during the make-or-break Christmas
season, said Kenneth Ashman, a lawyer for the merchants. Macklowe's
lawyers have moved to dismiss that suit.
</P>
<P>
   nn
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, life goes on. Sort of.
</P>
<P>
   Dr. Frederick Kahn, who has been out of his dental office at 538
Madison since December, estimates that contractors will need two
more months to repair his offices.
</P>
<P>
   In the interim, he has been toiling at a friend's office in a
bare, bathroom-size space. But referrals have plummeted, and he
said his patients missed the small touches from his old office,
like his underwater photographs of banded coral shrimp from the
Cayman Islands.
</P>
<P>
   ``Initially, all the patients were understanding,'' Kahn said.
``Now I'm seeing patients the second time around, and they're
saying, `Hey, what's happening?' There's a bit of hostility.''
</P>
<P>
   Last October, M. David Magnotta opened his cozy, ornate Caviar
Russe restaurant at 538 Madison to glowing reviews. But the
restaurant was badly damaged by the accident. Now, Labor Day is the
projected reopening date.
</P>
<P>
   Maybe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's just been so frustrating,'' Magnotta said. ``If I were to
be granted a wish, other than the fairy who grants me health and
eternal money, I would just ask to be given back Dec. 7 with no
occurrence like this.''
</P>
<P>
   Even those businesses that did reopen are suffering, especially
since the scaffolding caging the block still stands.
</P>
<P>
   Anna Antal, co-owner of Advanced Skin Care Day Spa, at 532
Madison, reopened her business in January. But the hiatus was
devastating, because it occurred during the holiday season, when
the spa anticipated selling 200 gift certificates. It sold none.
</P>
<P>
   Personal plans, meanwhile, have been scratched or held in
abeyance. Terzis and Conrad van Tienhoven, an equity research
analyst for a mutual fund, are among those who have had their
charge cards canceled by American Express.
</P>
<P>
   Barbara Spiegel, an actress, whose apartment at 534 Madison
suffered the worst damage from the falling bricks, was unable to
return home for four months. She was so distraught, she said, that
she was unable even to look for work until recently.
</P>
<P>
   ``I felt so vulnerable and threatened,'' Ms. Spiegel said. ``My
nerves were shot from this whole thing.''
</P>
<P>
   Tim Curran, whose tabby, Madison, made news in December when it
was rescued from his apartment at 536 Madison, is now faring worse
than his cat. He still owes more than $5,000 on his credit card,
and has had to put off his plans for business school.
</P>
<P>
   The Gerings had planned to adopt a child. But after the
accident, neither could work for months. Adoption went from present
to future tense.
</P>
<P>
   Some residents have pleaded their case at City Council and
Community Board 5 meetings. Some have leaned increasingly on
Hauer's Office of Emergency Management to pressure Macklowe.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's broken promises, on both parts,'' said an embittered
Kennedy about Macklowe and Hauer.
</P>
<P>
   Sunny Mindel, a spokeswoman for Hauer, said the city has worked
diligently on the matter, but that it can only do so much. ``We
can't untie the knots of red tape that Macklowe and the insurance
company have tied around their necks,'' Ms. Mindel said.
</P>
<P>
   But just last week, she added, the city filed a complaint about
540 Madison with the State Insurance Department to demand answers.
Yesterday, Allison Klimerman, a spokeswoman for the department,
said, ``We have already started to conduct a full investigation.''
</P>
<P>
   On some days, the residents don't want to hear another word
about their 40-story next-door neighbor, or about any other
building mishap, for that matter. Accident fatigue, perhaps.
</P>
<P>
   In the next two or three weeks, construction workers are
expected to start removing the south wall of 540 Madison, brick by
brick, said McKelvey, the Macklowe spokesman. Another brick facade
will then be constructed, a project that could take another six
months.
</P>
<P>
   It won't come soon enough, the residents say.
</P>
<P>
   About a month ago, several residents were awakened by a loud
thud in the small hours of the night. Was it a brick? Mass
hallucination? They never found out.
</P>
<P>
   Van Tienhoven said: ``It was almost as though someone said:
`Keep going, guys. Here's another reminder.' ``I was like, `Am I
underreacting if I play it cool and then I die? Or am I
overreacting if I get a hotel room again and I know I'm not going
to be reimbursed?'''

NCAA'S BRAND OF JUSTICE IS JUST WHAT TECH PLANNED
</HEADLINE>
 (For use by NYTimes News Service clients) 
By GIL LeBRETON 
c.1998 Fort Worth Star-Telegram 
<TEXT>
<P>
   Surely only by coincidence, ABC-TV has been promoting this week
the network debut of its summer sitcom, ``Maximum Bob.''
</P>
<P>
   In it, actor Beau Bridges stars as a Southern judge with a
penchant for meting out the maximum possible sentence, regardless
of the alleged crime.
</P>
<P>
   Now that's comedy.
</P>
<P>
   It's a TV parody, we can only assume. In the real-life world of
college sports, as Texas Tech proved again Tuesday, there is no
Maximum Bob.
</P>
<P>
   In the 18-month case of the NCAA vs. Texas Tech, the judge
proved not to be a hanging judge. Not only did the NCAA Committee
on Infractions spare the rod, it lavished the Red Raiders with some
nice parting gifts.
</P>
<P>
   The necks of their head football and basketball coaches, to name
two.
</P>
<P>
   Conspicuously, Tech also will be allowed to compete for a
football bowl bid as well as a postseason basketball berth.
</P>
<P>
   No wonder that in the Texas Tech athletic offices Tuesday, there
were hugs and congratulations all around.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'm thrilled to death,'' football coach Spike Dykes said.
</P>
<P>
   And well, Spike should be. No bowl sanctions. No TV ban. No pink
slip for being the coach-on-duty at the time of many of the
transgressions.
</P>
<P>
   Life is good.
</P>
<P>
   Where is Maximum Bob when we need him?
</P>
<P>
   In a staggering bit of logic and rhetoric, NCAA acting
infractions chairwoman Bonnie Slatton cited Texas Tech's
``commendable'' self-imposed bowl ban of a year ago. Call her
Minimum Bonnie.
</P>
<P>
   Next time you and I are nailed for speeding, let's also remind
the judge about the times we went only 10 mph through the school
zone.
</P>
<P>
   In truth, at the time that Tech announced last season that it
was removing itself from the bowl pool, it was a 4-4 team with two
road games ahead and a likely candidate to finish 5-6 and not go to
a bowl anyway.
</P>
<P>
   Tech's strategy was to let current and former employees,
including assistant coaches Greg Pinkney and Rhudy Maskew and
administrators Taylor McNeel and Ron Reeger, take the fall and then
humbly swallow the expected NCAA two-year bowl ban.
</P>
<P>
   Instead, consider the bile that has to be stirring this morning
in a place like Stillwater, Okla., where Oklahoma State has
patiently picked itself off the NCAA rock pile and built itself
back into a conference contender. Texas Tech, freed from the
shackles of a deserved second-year ban, could end up beating the
Cowboys for the Big 12 South title.
</P>
<P>
   Admittedly, there was some sloppy bookkeeping being done on the
Tech campus, and it is hard to lay that at the feet of Dykes and
basketball coach James Dickey. But parts of the NCAA sentence have
to do with academic fraud and shady recruiting, and the persons
committing those offenses worked for _ or, in one case, was trying
to work for _ Dykes and Dickey.
</P>
<P>
   I like Dykes, like every other media person in Texas. And I'm
tempted to believe that Dickey could be a winning coach anywhere in
the country.
</P>
<P>
   But how they both personally escaped the NCAA hangman in this is
a joke with an all-too-familiar punchline. The NCAA talks a good
game. It boasts a thick (579-page) rule book. But it doesn't even
make a good TV sitcom.
</P>
<P>
   ``This case is essentially about a lack of institutional
control,'' Minimum Bonnie said Tuesday, ``and a failure to monitor
the program.''
</P>
<P>
   That sounds serious. But she forgot to add, ``See you at the
Alamo Bowl.''
</P>
<P>
   The NCAA statement had all the numbers. Losing a possible 76
scholarships in nine sports will cut at the heart of those Tech
programs' future success.
</P>
<P>
   But a bowl ban is a seasonlong reminder. It runs in the daily
newspaper whenever the poll mentions teams ``ineligible to receive
votes.''
</P>
<P>
   Moreover, it has always been the time paid by teams that commit
the crime. But not by Texas Tech.
</P>
<P>
   Now, it seems, it's the inmates that get to run the NCAA
jailhouse.
</P>
<P>
   Hmm. Sounds like another sitcom.

COMMENTARY: IN CENSUS WAR, THEY DECLINE TO BE COUNTED 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ELIZABETH KOLBERT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   NEW YORK _ It is one of those questions that pit Republicans
against Democrats, Republicans against mathematicians, Republicans
against civil rights groups and, in the case of New York,
Republicans somewhat reluctantly against Republicans.
</P>
<P>
   Should the Census Bureau try to count Americans accurately or
not?
</P>
<P>
   Back in the spring, when Gov. George Pataki attended a press
breakfast that was supposed to showcase his national potential, he
was asked whether he thought the census should update its methods
or just keep missing the poor and overcounting the rich. Fairness,
the governor opined to his Washington audience, was a good idea.
</P>
<P>
   But when it came to taking a genuine position on the issue, he
pronounced himself agnostic. ``The methodology we'll leave to
Washington to determine,'' he said. He has not been heard from on
the topic since.
</P>
<P>
   Meanwhile, Sen. Alfonse D'Amato, R-N.Y., who claims to love a
good fight, has also ducked this one. Responding to a call asking
for his position, a spokeswoman for the senator, Lisette McSoud
Mondello, stated it as follows: ``Sen. D'Amato favors whatever's
best for New York.'' She declined to elaborate.
</P>
<P>
   Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, for his part, has taken a stand _ sort
of. A few months ago, he directed the city to enter a lawsuit in
support of efforts to bring the census into the 20th century. Yet
the nothing-if-not-outspoken mayor has had almost nothing to say
publicly on this subject.
</P>
<P>
   In Washington, of course, Republicans have been altogether
upfront in their opposition to what is known as statistical
sampling, a method of extrapolating census data that experts widely
agree is more accurate than relying solely on counting people door
to door. Brandishing the Constitution, the Republicans have argued
that using statistics to supplement the traditional head count
would violate the Founding Fathers' call for an ``actual
enumeration'' of the population. Even House Speaker Newt Gingrich _
Mr. Third Wave himself _ has put aside his usual enthusiasm for
futurism to play Luddite on this innovation.
</P>
<P>
   Clearly guiding the Republicans' stand _ and no doubt the
Democrats' as well _ is the assumption that conventional
census-taking methods, which tend to undercount members of minority
groups, tend to undercount Democratic voters as well. Since the
2000 census will become the basis for redistricting not only
Congress but also every state legislature, this branch of
mathematics is one all politicians know enough to care about.
</P>
<P>
   In New York state as a whole, it is assumed that a more accurate
count would not have a dramatic effect. In 1990, the average state
population, according to the Census Bureau's own estimates, was
undercounted by a net of 1.6 percent. In New York, the undercount
was 1.5 percent, meaning that the state did not, relative to its
neighbors, lose out.
</P>
<P>
   Significantly, though, almost all of the undercount occurred in
the five boroughs, meaning that New York City residents were missed
at a rate more than twice the national average. This has cost the
city both financially and politically.
</P>
<P>
   The census drives the formulas for dozens of federal programs.
Recently, the City Council looked at seven federal programs,
including Head Start, that distribute money based on the census. It
concluded that just in these programs, the city had lost more than
$400 million as a result of the 1990 undercount.
</P>
<P>
   The undercount also affects the city's representation in
Washington and Albany. Experts estimate that if all New Yorkers
were counted, the boundaries of perhaps as many as two state senate
districts would be pushed into the city. Currently, Republicans
hold only a five-seat edge in the body.
</P>
<P>
   The city has just one Republican member of Congress, Vito
Fossella of Staten Island. Fossella is clearly in an awkward
position on sampling, which is perhaps why, in defiance of a
scientific consensus, he has cast his opposition to it as a matter
of scientific concern.
</P>
<P>
   ``It's unfortunate that this has become a political issue,'' he
said through his spokesman, Craig Donner. ``But the truth of the
matter is, sampling is not nearly as reliable as enumeration.''
</P>
<P>
   By contrast, the state Senate majority leader, Joseph Bruno, has
expressed his reservations in rather less lofty and, one suspects,
more candid terms. The senator is opposed to sampling, said his
communications director, John McArdle, because, as he bluntly put
it: ``There is nothing in there for us.''

2 TOP EXECUTIVES TO QUIT RECENTLY FORMED HOTEL CHAIN 
</HEADLINE>
   (bl)  
 By EDWARD WYATT   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service    
<TEXT>
<P>
   Promus Hotel Corp., formed only eight months ago by the merger
of two of the nation's biggest hotel operators, said Tuesday night
that its two top executives would resign and that it would seek new
leadership from outside the company.
</P>
<P>
   Raymond E. Schultz, chairman and chief executive of the company,
and Richard M. Kelleher, president and chief operating officer,
will leave as soon as a new chairman and chief executive is named,
the company said.
</P>
<P>
   In addition, two directors affiliated with the two formerly
independent companies, Promus Hotel Corp. and Doubletree Corp.,
will resign from the new company's board when the new chairman and
chief executive is named. Those directors are Richard J. Ferris,
co-chairman of the former Doubletree Corp., and Michael D. Rose,
former chairman of Promus.
</P>
<P>
   The announcement clearly surprised financial analysts who follow
the hotel industry. Analysts' reports issued late last month, after
the release of the company's second-quarter earnings statement,
were generally upbeat and gave no hint of discord at the company.
</P>
<P>
   ``Everyone realized that these were culturally two very
different organizations'' headed by strong-willed leaders, said
Michael Rietbrock, a financial analyst at Salomon Smith Barney. ``I
think they had different strategic objectives that probably
manifested themselves'' as the operations of the two companies
became more integrated.
</P>
<P>
   Therefore, while the resignations are ``disappointing and
surprising,'' Rietbrock said, he did not think they had immediate
implications for the business. ``Hotel franchises are a business
that can run itself over the intermediate term,'' he said. ``The
important thing will be for them to manage their relationships with
franchisees.''
</P>
<P>
   On May 1, Schult told shareholders at the company's annual
meeting that the merger of the operations of Promus and Doubletree
was ``on plan.'' The combined company ``has all of the ingredients
necessary to be one of the dominant growth companies in the lodging
sector over the next two to three years,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   In the news release Tuesday night, however, Dale Frey, a
director and chairman of the committee that will search for a
replacement for the departing executives, said, ``Although the
merger has proceeded extremely well on the operating level, as we
looked ahead we agreed that fresh leadership would move us more
quickly into the future.''
</P>
<P>
   The company said its board had decided to seek ``an individual
from outside both the former Doubletree and Promus organizations
who would be better suited to move the company to its next stage of
profitable growth and to capitalize on the strengths of the company
without reference to past affiliations or corporate philosophies.''
</P>
<P>
   Promus operates and franchises hotels that cater to long-term
stays or budget travelers under the names of Doubletree Hotels and
Guest Suites, Embassy Suites, Homewood Suites, Hampton Inn and
Hampton Inn and Suites.
</P>
<P>
   The company announced the resignations nearly four hours after
the close of trading on the New York Stock Exchange, where the
company's shares are listed.
</P>
<P>
   Promus shares fell 75 cents, to $34.125 Tuesday, after trading
as low as $33.75, their lowest price since the merger, which was
completed in December. On March 2, the shares traded as high as
$49.625.

TESTIMONY IN 1975 MURDER RAISES HOPE OF A SOLUTION
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   HARTFORD, Conn. _ In what could be a breakthrough in the
investigation of a Greenwich teen-ager's murder almost 23 years
ago, a man who was once a suspect testified before an investigative
grand jury Tuesday in exchange for immunity, his lawyer said.
</P>
<P>
   The prosecutor's willingness to grant immunity to Kenneth
Littleton, who was living next door to the teen-ager, Martha
Moxley, when she was killed in 1975, appears to leave just two
suspects in the case: Thomas and Michael Skakel, nephews of Robert
F. Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton testified before the grand jury in Bridgeport for
about an hour and a half, said his lawyer, Eugene Riccio, who
refused to discuss the nature of the testimony.
</P>
<P>
   John Moxley, 39, Ms. Moxley's brother, who has pushed for
further investigation into his sister's killing, said Tuesday that
he was both surprised and hopeful to hear that Littleton, who had
lived in the Skakel home as a tutor, had testified.
</P>
<P>
   ``Ken was there,'' said Moxley, who now lives in New Jersey.
``He was at ground zero. He was in the Skakel house that night and
during the immediate period afterward. He knew what they were
talking about. He knew who was in the house. He had a sense of
where people were and what they were doing.''
</P>
<P>
   The news that Littleton had testified, Moxley said, ``kind of
raised the hair on the back of my neck.''
</P>
<P>
   Moxley also said the prosecutor's decision to give Littleton
immunity indicates that the prosecutor believes Littleton did not
commit the crime. ``I'm assuming that if the police are willing to
grant immunity, they knew something we don't know,'' he said.
</P>
<P>
   Ms. Moxley, 15, was killed on Oct. 30, 1975, after spending the
evening next door at the Skakel house in the gated community of
Belle Haven. When she was found under a tree near her house, her
underpants had been pulled down, but law enforcement officials have
said there was no obvious evidence of sexual assault.
</P>
<P>
   At the time, Thomas Skakel, who was 17, told the police that he
last saw her alive outside his home about 9:30 p.m. She is believed
to have been killed about 10 p.m., beaten with a golf club with
such force that the club shattered and then stabbed through the
neck with one of the pieces. Thomas Skakel now lives in
Massachusetts with his wife and their three children.
</P>
<P>
   Michael Skakel, who was 15 when Ms. Moxley was killed, is also
married and lives in Cohasset, Mass. In 1994 he began working as a
driver for his cousin Michael Kennedy.
</P>
<P>
   The golf club had belonged to Ann Reynolds Skakel, the wife of
Rushton Skakel, Ethel Kennedy's brother and the father of the
Skakel boys. Thomas and Michael Skakel have denied involvement in
the murder. Emanuel Margolis, a lawyer for Thomas Skakel, could not
be reached for comment late Tuesday evening.
</P>
<P>
   Littleton, who now lives in Massachusetts, initially refused to
testify before the grand jury, invoking his Fifth Amendment right
against self-incrimination, Riccio said. Tuesday, after
negotiations with Littleton, State's Attorney Jonathan Benedict
asked Superior Court Judge John Ronan to compel Littleton to
testify, Riccio said. The move under state law gives him immunity
from prosecution for any crime except perjury in this case.
</P>
<P>
   ``He's much relieved, and he would like to put this situation
far, far behind him,'' Riccio said of his client.
</P>
<P>
   Grand juries are unusual in Connecticut; fewer than a dozen have
been convened since 1985. This one consists of one person, George
Thim, a former judge appointed in June. He will decide whether
there is enough evidence for an indictment.
</P>
<P>
   The case received renewed attention with the publication of Mark
Fuhrman's book ``Murder in Greenwich: Who Killed Martha Moxley?''
in April. Fuhrman, a former Los Angeles police detective, achieved
notoriety after testifying in the O.J. Simpson murder trial, then
pleading no contest to perjury charges. He also wrote a book based
on his experiences, ``Murder in Brentwood.''

FEWER PEOPLE TAKE AND PASS GED TEST 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By RANDAL C. ARCHIBOLD   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   The number of people taking and passing the high school
equivalency test, or the GED, dropped last year after the minimum
passing grade was raised in an effort to keep pace with stiffening
high school and college academic standards nationwide.
</P>
<P>
   The test, the General Educational Development test, an
alternative route to a diploma for hundreds of thousands of people,
had long been criticized as out of step with the trend toward more
rigorous graduation requirements.
</P>
<P>
   The minimum passing score was raised last year and the GED
Testing Service, a branch of the American Council on Education that
administers the test, plans to replace the current exam in 2001
with a tougher test. The current test, a five-part, eight-hour exam
on English, mathematics, social studies, science and interpreting
literature and the arts, has been used since 1988.
</P>
<P>
   Last year, of the 722,461 people who took the exam in the United
States, its territories and Canada, 495,873 passed, a rate of 68.6
percent. In 1996, 544,136 out of the 758,906 people who took the
test passed, a rate of 71.7 percent. The number of people who took
the test dropped 4.8 percent from 1996 to 1997, and the number of
people who passed dropped 8.9 percent.
</P>
<P>
   The number of people who took the test in 1996 marked a record
in the exam's 55-year history. Officials at the GED Testing Service
had anticipated a drop in 1997 because of the change in grading
standards, which forced 36 states and territories to raise their
passing scores to comply with the national norm.
</P>
<P>
   Previously, students needed either a minimum grade of 40 on a
20-to-80 grading scale on each exam or an average of 45 on all
exams to receive a passing grade. That allowed someone to pass if
they earned a 50 on one exam and a 30 on another.
</P>
<P>
   Under the new grading system, participants must have a minimum
of 40 on each test and an average of 45 or above. Some states, like
New Jersey, make their requirements even tougher by mandating a
higher score on some of the exams.
</P>
<P>
   The GED Testing Service is examining further changes in the
test.

HUDSON SITE FOUND TO HAVE HIGH PCB LEVELS 
</HEADLINE>
  (mk) 
 By ANDREW C. REVKIN   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   High levels of PCBs, cancer-causing industrial chemicals, have
been found in mud at the bottom of the Hudson River near a 26-acre
toxic waste site in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York state
environmental officials say.
</P>
<P>
   The chemicals in the river mud apparently seeped from a pocket
of highly contaminated soil on the site of the former Anaconda Wire
and Cable Co. factory, which is separated from the river by
deteriorating wooden bulkheads, said John Cahill, commissioner of
the state Department of Environmental Conservation.
</P>
<P>
   He said that there was no immediate health risk to people living
near the site, but that the finding added new urgency to a
long-planned cleanup of polluted soil there. The state received the
study results last week from consultants testing the river.
</P>
<P>
   The state environmental agency and Health Department planned to
begin work immediately with Atlantic Richfield Co., a former owner
of the property, to determine the extent of the leakage into the
river and to stanch any continuing flow of the chemicals, said Gary
Sheffer, a spokesman for the DEC.
</P>
<P>
   ``Given the concentrations we found, we needed to take some
immediate action,'' Sheffer said. Samples taken from the top two
feet of the river bottom contained PCBs _ polychlorinated biphenyls
_ in concentrations of up to 5,300 parts per million, Sheffer said.
State environmental officials have set a goal of just 1 part per
million for river mud.
</P>
<P>
   At the concentration found, PCBs in the mud can easily work
their way up the food chain to fish, where they could pose a risk
to people who catch and eat the fish, said John Cronin, executive
director of Riverkeeper, a private group that has been pressing for
more than a decade for a cleanup of the factory grounds.
</P>
<P>
   Fish in the river have long been tainted by PCBs from other
sources, particularly two former General Electric factories in the
upper Hudson, above Troy. The state Health Department recommends
that children and pregnant women eat no fish from the river, with
less stringent advisories for men.
</P>
<P>
   PCBs were once commonly used as insulators in electrical
components like transformers, but have been banned since 1977. They
are known to cause cancer in laboratory animals and are considered
a probable cause of cancer and other ailments in humans.
</P>
<P>
   The former Anaconda property, part of which has been
redeveloped, sits on the east bank of the river in a prosperous
commuter hub 15 miles north of Times Square. It is likely that the
chemicals in the soil, and those in the river, came from decades of
spillage and dumping when the Anaconda plant was active, state
environmental officials said.
</P>
<P>
   The likely source of the deposits on the river bottom, according
to state officials, was an area of highly contaminated soil in the
northwest corner of the Anaconda plant site, near a newly opened
factory that makes bicycle helmets.
</P>
<P>
   The ``hot spot,'' Sheffer said, contains some buried soil with
PCBs in concentrations of 381,000 parts per million. The state has
set 10 parts per million as the threshold at which a cleanup is
ordered for this kind of site.
</P>
<P>
   Tests of air in and around the helmet factory revealed no
detectable levels of the contaminants, Sheffer said.
</P>
<P>
   In 1995, Atlantic Richfield, which bought the factory from
Anaconda in 1977, signed an agreement with the state to clean the
property. The pollution in the river was discovered in recent weeks
when mud samples were pulled from the bottom close to the shore as
part of the company's study of the site, said Kathleen Schoen, who
is managing the cleanup for Arco Environmental Remediation, a
subsidiary of the oil company.

AREA'S GOP REPRESENTATIVES REBEL ON CAMPAIGN LIMITS
</HEADLINE>
   (nk) 
 By JAMES DAO   
 c.1998 N.Y. Times News Service   
<TEXT>
<P>
   WASHINGTON _ Far more than Republicans from anywhere else in the
country, House Republicans from New York, New Jersey and
Connecticut have been bucking their party's leadership to support
legislation to overhaul the way federal elections are financed.
</P>
<P>
   Repeatedly in recent weeks, a significant majority of the 22
Republican representatives from the three states have joined with
Democrats in votes that have kept alive the most sweeping of
several campaign finance measures now before the House.
</P>
<P>
   That measure, sponsored by Reps. Christopher Shays, R-Conn., and
Martin Meehan, D-Mass., passed a pivotal test on Monday night as
the House endorsed it by a 237-to-186 vote. Though it still faces
several hurdles, the bill is expected to pass in the House later
this week and be sent to the Senate, where it is thought to have
little chance of being approved.
</P>
<P>
   In Monday night's vote, 51 Republicans defied their leaders in
voting for the bill, and 15 of those came from New York, New Jersey
and Connecticut. Only 11 Democrats voted against the bill, and none
of them came from the three states.
</P>
<P>
   The Shays-Meehan bill would effectively ban soft money, the
unlimited, unregulated donations to political parties, and restrict
so-called issue advocacy commercials by outside organizations
during the 60 days before an election.
</P>
<P>
   Political analysts and members of Congress cited several reasons
for the strong support among Republicans in the region for the
Shays-Meehan legislation, including a strong tradition of reform
politics in all three states, unwavering support for the bill among
the region's major editorial pages and concerns that Democrats
would use the issue in fall campaigns.
</P>
<P>
   ``I think in this region voters are more sensitive to this issue
than they are in other parts of the country,'' said Rep. Michael
Forbes, R-N.Y., who voted for the Shays-Meehan bill. ``It doesn't
rate high in polling. But when you say to people, `What do you say
about money in politics?' they go crazy. I think a lot of my
colleagues in the region have heard this.''
</P>
<P>
   Ann McBride, president of Common Cause, the watchdog group, also
said that many of the earliest and most stalwart Republican
supporters of the Shays-Meehan bill come from the New York region,
including Reps. Marge Roukema of New Jersey, Nancy Johnson of
Connecticut and Amo Houghton of New York.
</P>
<P>
   In interviews, almost all the Republicans from the region who
voted for the Shays-Meehan bill said they would continue to defy
their leadership and push for the bill in the coming days. Under
the rules of the House, the Shays-Meehan bill will be pitted
against several other campaign finance measures this week. The one
that receives the most votes and is reapproved by the House will be
sent to the Senate.
</P>
<P>
   ``It shows what the moderates can do when they band together,''
Houghton said.
</P>
<P>
   Houghton and other Republicans said they were not being
pressured to switch their votes by Republican leaders, who contend
that the Shays-Meehan bill would abridge citizens' First Amendment
right to contribute to campaigns and would unfairly undermine the
party's current fund-raising advantage over the Democrats.
</P>
<P>
   The Republican supporters of the Shays-Meehan bill said that one
reason the House leadership might not have been vigorously twisting
arms was that they were confident the Senate's GOP leadership would
kill the bill.
</P>
<P>
   Aides to Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott have said he does not
plan to bring the Senate version of Shays-Meehan to the floor.
</P>
<ANNOTATION>
   (STORY CAN END HERE. OPTIONAL MATERIAL FOLLOWS)
</ANNOTATION>
<P>
   But some Republicans were uncertain how they would vote right up
until the last minute on Monday, partly, it seems, because they
were concerned about alienating their leaders. New York Rep. Rick
Lazio, who is a deputy whip, did not decide to vote for the bill
until Monday afternoon, becoming one of only a handful of members
of the House Republican leadership to support it.
</P>
<P>
   Some Republicans, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said
they expected the House leadership to become more active in
opposing the Shays-Meehan bill in the coming days, mainly by
pressuring Republicans to vote for an alternative campaign finance
bill sponsored by a bipartisan group of freshmen congressmen.
</P>
<P>
   Several Republicans from the region who oppose the Shays-Meehan
bill, including two representatives from New York _ Peter King and
Vito Fossella _ said they might vote for the freshman bill whether
their leadership asked them to or not.
</P>
<P>
   ``I'll vote for it to stop Shays and Meehan,'' King said. ``I'm
being open about my cynicism. But it is the lesser of two evils.
And I haven't heard that from leadership.''
